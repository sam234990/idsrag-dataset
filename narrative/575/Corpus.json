Ann Veronica is planning to attend the dance with friends of a down-at-the-heels artistic family living nearby and has been chafing at other restrictions imposed for no apparent reason on her. After her father resorts to force to stop her from attending the ball, she leaves her home in the fictional south London suburb of Morningside Park in order to live independently in an apartment \"in a street near the Hampstead Road\" in North London. Unable to find appropriate employment, she borrows forty pounds from Mr. Ramage, an older man, without realizing she is compromising herself.\nWith this money, Ann Veronica is able to devote herself to study in the biological laboratory of the Central Imperial College (a constituent college of London University) where she meets and falls in love with Capes, the laboratory's \"demonstrator.\" But Mr. Ramage loses little time in trying to take advantage of the situation, precipitating a crisis. Distraught after Ramage tries to force himself on her, Ann Veronica temporarily abandons her studies and devotes herself to the cause of women's suffrage; she is arrested storming Parliament and spends a month in prison.\nSobered by the experience, Ann Veronica convinces herself of the necessity of compromise. She returns to her father's home and engages herself to marry an admirer she does not love, Hubert Manning. But she soon changes her mind, renounces the engagement, and boldly tells Capes she loves him.\nThough he returns Ann Veronica's love, at first the thirty-year-old Capes insists on the impossibility of the situation: he is a married (albeit separated) man with a sullied reputation because of an affair that became public. They can only be friends, he declares. But Ann Veronica is undeterred by his confession and his prudence, and finally Capes's resistance buckles: \"She stood up and held her arms toward him. 'I want you to kiss me,' she said. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. 'I want you. I want you to be my lover. I want to give myself to you. I want to be whatever I can to you.' She paused for a moment. 'Is that plain?' she asked.\"\nCapes decides to throw over his employment at the college in order to live with Ann Veronica, and they enjoy a glorious \"honeymoon\" in the Alps. A final chapter shows the happy couple four years and four months later living in London. Capes has become a successful playwright, and Ann Veronica is pregnant and has reconciled with her family.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Ann Veronica, by H. G.

She had trembled on\nthe verge of such a resolution before, but this time quite definitely\nshe made it. A crisis had been reached, and she was almost glad it had\nbeen reached. She made up her mind in the train home that it should be\na decisive crisis. It is for that reason that this novel begins with\nher there, and neither earlier nor later, for it is the history of this\ncrisis and its consequences that this novel has to tell.\n\nShe had a compartment to herself in the train from London to Morningside\nPark, and she sat with both her feet on the seat in an attitude that\nwould certainly have distressed her mother to see, and horrified her\ngrandmother beyond measure; she sat with her knees up to her chin and\nher hands clasped before them, and she was so lost in thought that\nshe discovered with a start, from a lettered lamp, that she was at\nMorningside Park, and thought she was moving out of the station, whereas\nshe was only moving in. \"Lord!\" she said. She jumped up at once,\ncaught up a leather clutch containing notebooks, a fat text-book, and\na chocolate-and-yellow-covered pamphlet, and leaped neatly from the\ncarriage, only to discover that the train was slowing down and that she\nhad to traverse the full length of the platform past it again as the\nresult of her precipitation. \"Sold again,\" she remarked. \"Idiot!\" She\nraged inwardly while she walked along with that air of self-contained\nserenity that is proper to a young lady of nearly two-and-twenty under\nthe eye of the world.\n\nShe walked down the station approach, past the neat, obtrusive offices\nof the coal merchant and the house agent, and so to the wicket-gate by\nthe butcher's shop that led to the field path to her home. Outside the\npost-office stood a no-hatted, blond young man in gray flannels, who was\nelaborately affixing a stamp to a letter. At the sight of her he became\nrigid and a singularly bright shade of pink. She made herself serenely\nunaware of his existence, though it may be it was his presence that sent\nher by the field detour instead of by the direct path up the Avenue.\n\n\"Umph!\" he said, and regarded his letter doubtfully before consigning it\nto the pillar-box. \"Here goes,\" he said. Then he hovered undecidedly for\nsome seconds with his hands in his pockets and his mouth puckered to a\nwhistle before he turned to go home by the Avenue.\n\nAnn Veronica forgot him as soon as she was through the gate, and her\nface resumed its expression of stern preoccupation. \"It's either now or\nnever,\" she said to herself....\n\nMorningside Park was a suburb that had not altogether, as people say,\ncome off. It consisted, like pre-Roman Gaul, of three parts. There was\nfirst the Avenue, which ran in a consciously elegant curve from the\nrailway station into an undeveloped wilderness of agriculture, with big,\nyellow brick villas on either side, and then there was the pavement, the\nlittle clump of shops about the post-office, and under the railway arch\nwas a congestion of workmen's dwellings. The road from Surbiton and\nEpsom ran under the arch, and, like a bright fungoid growth in the\nditch, there was now appearing a sort of fourth estate of little\nred-and-white rough-cast villas, with meretricious gables and very\nbrassy window-blinds. Behind the Avenue was a little hill, and an\niron-fenced path went over the crest of this to a stile under an\nelm-tree, and forked there, with one branch going back into the Avenue\nagain.\n\n\"It's either now or never,\" said Ann Veronica, again ascending this\nstile. \"Much as I hate rows, I've either got to make a stand or give in\naltogether.\"\n\nShe seated herself in a loose and easy attitude and surveyed the\nbacks of the Avenue houses; then her eyes wandered to where the new\nred-and-white villas peeped among the trees. She seemed to be making\nsome sort of inventory. \"Ye Gods!\" she said at last. \"WHAT a place!\n\n\"Stuffy isn't the word for it.\n\n\"I wonder what he takes me for?\"\n\nWhen presently she got down from the stile a certain note of internal\nconflict, a touch of doubt, had gone from her warm-tinted face. She had\nnow the clear and tranquil expression of one whose mind is made up. Her\nback had stiffened, and her hazel eyes looked steadfastly ahead.\n\nAs she approached the corner of the Avenue the blond, no-hatted man in\ngray flannels appeared. There was a certain air of forced fortuity in\nhis manner. He saluted awkwardly. \"Hello, Vee!\" he said.\n\n\"Hello, Teddy!\" she answered.\n\nHe hung vaguely for a moment as she passed.\n\nBut it was clear she was in no mood for Teddys. He realized that he was\ncommitted to the path across the fields, an uninteresting walk at the\nbest of times.\n\n\"Oh, dammit!\" he remarked, \"dammit!\" with great bitterness as he faced\nit.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nAnn Veronica Stanley was twenty-one and a half years old. She had black\nhair, fine eyebrows, and a clear complexion; and the forces that had\nmodelled her features had loved and lingered at their work and made them\nsubtle and fine. She was slender, and sometimes she seemed tall, and\nwalked and carried herself lightly and joyfully as one who commonly\nand habitually feels well, and sometimes she stooped a little and\nwas preoccupied. Her lips came together with an expression between\ncontentment and the faintest shadow of a smile, her manner was one of\nquiet reserve, and behind this mask she was wildly discontented and\neager for freedom and life.\n\nShe wanted to live. She was vehemently impatient--she did not clearly\nknow for what--to do, to be, to experience. And experience was slow in\ncoming. All the world about her seemed to be--how can one put it?--in\nwrappers, like a house when people leave it in the summer. The blinds\nwere all drawn, the sunlight kept out, one could not tell what\ncolors these gray swathings hid. She wanted to know. And there was no\nintimation whatever that the blinds would ever go up or the windows or\ndoors be opened, or the chandeliers, that seemed to promise such a blaze\nof fire, unveiled and furnished and lit. Dim souls flitted about her,\nnot only speaking but it would seem even thinking in undertones....\n\nDuring her school days, especially her earlier school days, the world\nhad been very explicit with her, telling her what to do, what not to do,\ngiving her lessons to learn and games to play and interests of the most\nsuitable and various kinds. Presently she woke up to the fact that there\nwas a considerable group of interests called being in love and getting\nmarried, with certain attractive and amusing subsidiary developments,\nsuch as flirtation and \"being interested\" in people of the opposite sex.\nShe approached this field with her usual liveliness of apprehension. But\nhere she met with a check. These interests her world promptly, through\nthe agency of schoolmistresses, older school-mates, her aunt, and a\nnumber of other responsible and authoritative people, assured her she\nmust on no account think about. Miss Moffatt, the history and moral\ninstruction mistress, was particularly explicit upon this score, and\nthey all agreed in indicating contempt and pity for girls whose minds\nran on such matters, and who betrayed it in their conversation or dress\nor bearing. It was, in fact, a group of interests quite unlike any\nother group, peculiar and special, and one to be thoroughly ashamed of.\nNevertheless, Ann Veronica found it a difficult matter not to think of\nthese things. However having a considerable amount of pride, she decided\nshe would disavow these undesirable topics and keep her mind away from\nthem just as far as she could, but it left her at the end of her school\ndays with that wrapped feeling I have described, and rather at loose\nends.\n\nThe world, she discovered, with these matters barred had no particular\nplace for her at all, nothing for her to do, except a functionless\nexistence varied by calls, tennis, selected novels, walks, and dusting\nin her father's house. She thought study would be better. She was a\nclever girl, the best of her year in the High School, and she made\na valiant fight for Somerville or Newnham but her father had met and\nargued with a Somerville girl at a friend's dinner-table and he thought\nthat sort of thing unsexed a woman. He said simply that he wanted her to\nlive at home. There was a certain amount of disputation, and meanwhile\nshe went on at school. They compromised at length on the science course\nat the Tredgold Women's College--she had already matriculated into\nLondon University from school--she came of age, and she bickered with\nher aunt for latch-key privileges on the strength of that and her season\nticket. Shamefaced curiosities began to come back into her mind, thinly\ndisguised as literature and art. She read voraciously, and presently,\nbecause of her aunt's censorship, she took to smuggling any books she\nthought might be prohibited instead of bringing them home openly, and\nshe went to the theatre whenever she could produce an acceptable friend\nto accompany her. She passed her general science examination with double\nhonors and specialized in science. She happened to have an acute sense\nof form and unusual mental lucidity, and she found in biology, and\nparticularly in comparative anatomy, a very considerable interest,\nalbeit the illumination it cast upon her personal life was not\naltogether direct. She dissected well, and in a year she found herself\nchafing at the limitations of the lady B. Sc. who retailed a store of\nfaded learning in the Tredgold laboratory. She had already realized that\nthis instructress was hopelessly wrong and foggy--it is the test of the\ngood comparative anatomist--upon the skull. She discovered a desire to\nenter as a student in the Imperial College at Westminster, where Russell\ntaught, and go on with her work at the fountain-head.\n\nShe had asked about that already, and her father had replied, evasively:\n\"We'll have to see about that, little Vee; we'll have to see about\nthat.\" In that posture of being seen about the matter hung until she\nseemed committed to another session at the Tredgold College, and in the\nmean time a small conflict arose and brought the latch-key question, and\nin fact the question of Ann Veronica's position generally, to an acute\nissue.\n\nIn addition to the various business men, solicitors, civil servants,\nand widow ladies who lived in the Morningside Park Avenue, there was a\ncertain family of alien sympathies and artistic quality, the Widgetts,\nwith which Ann Veronica had become very friendly. Mr. Widgett was a\njournalist and art critic, addicted to a greenish-gray tweed suit\nand \"art\" brown ties; he smoked corncob pipes in the Avenue on Sunday\nmorning, travelled third class to London by unusual trains, and openly\ndespised golf. He occupied one of the smaller houses near the station.\nHe had one son, who had been co-educated, and three daughters with\npeculiarly jolly red hair that Ann Veronica found adorable. Two of these\nhad been her particular intimates at the High School, and had done much\nto send her mind exploring beyond the limits of the available literature\nat home. It was a cheerful, irresponsible, shamelessly hard-up family in\nthe key of faded green and flattened purple, and the girls went on from\nthe High School to the Fadden Art School and a bright, eventful life of\nart student dances, Socialist meetings, theatre galleries, talking about\nwork, and even, at intervals, work; and ever and again they drew Ann\nVeronica from her sound persistent industry into the circle of these\nexperiences. They had asked her to come to the first of the two great\nannual Fadden Dances, the October one, and Ann Veronica had accepted\nwith enthusiasm. And now her father said she must not go.\n\nHe had \"put his foot down,\" and said she must not go.\n\nGoing involved two things that all Ann Veronica's tact had been\nineffectual to conceal from her aunt and father. Her usual dignified\nreserve had availed her nothing. One point was that she was to wear\nfancy dress in the likeness of a Corsair's bride, and the other was that\nshe was to spend whatever vestiges of the night remained after the dance\nwas over in London with the Widgett girls and a select party in \"quite a\ndecent little hotel\" near Fitzroy Square.\n\n\"But, my dear!\" said Ann Veronica's aunt.\n\n\"You see,\" said Ann Veronica, with the air of one who shares a\ndifficulty, \"I've promised to go. I didn't realize--I don't see how I\ncan get out of it now.\"\n\nThen it was her father issued his ultimatum. He had conveyed it to her,\nnot verbally, but by means of a letter, which seemed to her a singularly\nignoble method of prohibition. \"He couldn't look me in the face and say\nit,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"But of course it's aunt's doing really.\"\n\nAnd thus it was that as Ann Veronica neared the gates of home, she said\nto herself: \"I'll have it out with him somehow. I'll have it out with\nhim. And if he won't--\"\n\nBut she did not give even unspoken words to the alternative at that\ntime.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nAnn Veronica's father was a solicitor with a good deal of company\nbusiness: a lean, trustworthy, worried-looking, neuralgic, clean-shaven\nman of fifty-three, with a hard mouth, a sharp nose, iron-gray hair,\ngray eyes, gold-framed glasses, and a small, circular baldness at the\ncrown of his head. His name was Peter. He had had five children at\nirregular intervals, of whom Ann Veronica was the youngest, so that as\na parent he came to her perhaps a little practised and jaded and\ninattentive; and he called her his \"little Vee,\" and patted her\nunexpectedly and disconcertingly, and treated her promiscuously as of\nany age between eleven and eight-and-twenty. The City worried him a good\ndeal, and what energy he had left over he spent partly in golf, a game\nhe treated very seriously, and partly in the practices of microscopic\npetrography.\n\nHe \"went in\" for microscopy in the unphilosophical Victorian manner as\nhis \"hobby.\" A birthday present of a microscope had turned his mind to\ntechnical microscopy when he was eighteen, and a chance friendship with\na Holborn microscope dealer had confirmed that bent. He had remarkably\nskilful fingers and a love of detailed processes, and he had become one\nof the most dexterous amateur makers of rock sections in the world.\nHe spent a good deal more money and time than he could afford upon the\nlittle room at the top of the house, in producing new lapidary apparatus\nand new microscopic accessories and in rubbing down slices of rock to\na transparent thinness and mounting them in a beautiful and dignified\nmanner. He did it, he said, \"to distract his mind.\" His chief successes\nhe exhibited to the Lowndean Microscopical Society, where their high\ntechnical merit never failed to excite admiration. Their scientific\nvalue was less considerable, since he chose rocks entirely with a\nview to their difficulty of handling or their attractiveness at\nconversaziones when done. He had a great contempt for the sections the\n\"theorizers\" produced. They proved all sorts of things perhaps, but they\nwere thick, unequal, pitiful pieces of work. Yet an indiscriminating,\nwrong-headed world gave such fellows all sorts of distinctions....\n\nHe read but little, and that chiefly healthy light fiction with\nchromatic titles, The Red Sword, The Black Helmet, The Purple Robe, also\nin order \"to distract his mind.\" He read it in winter in the evening\nafter dinner, and Ann Veronica associated it with a tendency to\nmonopolize the lamp, and to spread a very worn pair of dappled fawn-skin\nslippers across the fender. She wondered occasionally why his mind\nneeded so much distraction. His favorite newspaper was the Times, which\nhe began at breakfast in the morning often with manifest irritation, and\ncarried off to finish in the train, leaving no other paper at home.\n\nIt occurred to Ann Veronica once that she had known him when he was\nyounger, but day had followed day, and each had largely obliterated the\nimpression of its predecessor. But she certainly remembered that when\nshe was a little girl he sometimes wore tennis flannels, and also rode a\nbicycle very dexterously in through the gates to the front door. And\nin those days, too, he used to help her mother with her gardening, and\nhover about her while she stood on the ladder and hammered creepers to\nthe scullery wall.\n\nIt had been Ann Veronica's lot as the youngest child to live in a home\nthat became less animated and various as she grew up. Her mother had\ndied when she was thirteen, her two much older sisters had married\noff--one submissively, one insubordinately; her two brothers had gone\nout into the world well ahead of her, and so she had made what she could\nof her father. But he was not a father one could make much of.\n\nHis ideas about girls and women were of a sentimental and modest\nquality; they were creatures, he thought, either too bad for a modern\nvocabulary, and then frequently most undesirably desirable, or too pure\nand good for life. He made this simple classification of a large and\nvarious sex to the exclusion of all intermediate kinds; he held that\nthe two classes had to be kept apart even in thought and remote from one\nanother. Women are made like the potter's vessels--either for worship\nor contumely, and are withal fragile vessels. He had never wanted\ndaughters. Each time a daughter had been born to him he had concealed\nhis chagrin with great tenderness and effusion from his wife, and had\nsworn unwontedly and with passionate sincerity in the bathroom. He was\na manly man, free from any strong maternal strain, and he had loved his\ndark-eyed, dainty bright-colored, and active little wife with a real\nvein of passion in his sentiment. But he had always felt (he had never\nallowed himself to think of it) that the promptitude of their family\nwas a little indelicate of her, and in a sense an intrusion. He had,\nhowever, planned brilliant careers for his two sons, and, with a certain\nhuman amount of warping and delay, they were pursuing these. One was\nin the Indian Civil Service and one in the rapidly developing motor\nbusiness. The daughters, he had hoped, would be their mother's care.\n\nHe had no ideas about daughters. They happen to a man.\n\nOf course a little daughter is a delightful thing enough. It runs about\ngayly, it romps, it is bright and pretty, it has enormous quantities of\nsoft hair and more power of expressing affection than its brothers. It\nis a lovely little appendage to the mother who smiles over it, and it\ndoes things quaintly like her, gestures with her very gestures. It makes\nwonderful sentences that you can repeat in the City and are good\nenough for Punch. You call it a lot of nicknames--\"Babs\" and \"Bibs\" and\n\"Viddles\" and \"Vee\"; you whack at it playfully, and it whacks you back.\nIt loves to sit on your knee. All that is jolly and as it should be.\n\nBut a little daughter is one thing and a daughter quite another. There\none comes to a relationship that Mr. Stanley had never thought out.\nWhen he found himself thinking about it, it upset him so that he at once\nresorted to distraction. The chromatic fiction with which he relieved\nhis mind glanced but slightly at this aspect of life, and never with any\nquality of guidance. Its heroes never had daughters, they borrowed other\npeople's. The one fault, indeed, of this school of fiction for him was\nthat it had rather a light way with parental rights. His instinct was in\nthe direction of considering his daughters his absolute property, bound\nto obey him, his to give away or his to keep to be a comfort in his\ndeclining years just as he thought fit. About this conception of\nownership he perceived and desired a certain sentimental glamour, he\nliked everything properly dressed, but it remained ownership. Ownership\nseemed only a reasonable return for the cares and expenses of a\ndaughter's upbringing. Daughters were not like sons. He perceived,\nhowever, that both the novels he read and the world he lived in\ndiscountenanced these assumptions. Nothing else was put in their place,\nand they remained sotto voce, as it were, in his mind. The new and\nthe old cancelled out; his daughters became quasi-independent\ndependents--which is absurd. One married as he wished and one against\nhis wishes, and now here was Ann Veronica, his little Vee, discontented\nwith her beautiful, safe, and sheltering home, going about with hatless\nfriends to Socialist meetings and art-class dances, and displaying a\ndisposition to carry her scientific ambitions to unwomanly lengths. She\nseemed to think he was merely the paymaster, handing over the means\nof her freedom. And now she insisted that she MUST leave the chastened\nsecurity of the Tredgold Women's College for Russell's unbridled\nclasses, and wanted to go to fancy dress dances in pirate costume and\nspend the residue of the night with Widgett's ramshackle girls in some\nindescribable hotel in Soho!\n\nHe had done his best not to think about her at all, but the situation\nand his sister had become altogether too urgent. He had finally put\naside The Lilac Sunbonnet, gone into his study, lit the gas fire, and\nwritten the letter that had brought these unsatisfactory relations to a\nhead.\n\n\nPart 4\n\nMY DEAR VEE, he wrote.\n\nThese daughters! He gnawed his pen and reflected, tore the sheet up, and\nbegan again.\n\n\"MY DEAR VERONICA,--Your aunt tells me you have involved yourself in\nsome arrangement with the Widgett girls about a Fancy Dress Ball in\nLondon. I gather you wish to go up in some fantastic get-up, wrapped\nabout in your opera cloak, and that after the festivities you propose to\nstay with these friends of yours, and without any older people in your\nparty, at an hotel. Now I am sorry to cross you in anything you have set\nyour heart upon, but I regret to say--\"\n\n\"H'm,\" he reflected, and crossed out the last four words.\n\n\"--but this cannot be.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, and tried again: \"but I must tell you quite definitely\nthat I feel it to be my duty to forbid any such exploit.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" he remarked at the defaced letter; and, taking a fresh sheet, he\nrecopied what he had written. A certain irritation crept into his manner\nas he did so.\n\n\"I regret that you should ever have proposed it,\" he went on.\n\nHe meditated, and began a new paragraph.\n\n\"The fact of it is, and this absurd project of yours only brings it to\na head, you have begun to get hold of some very queer ideas about what a\nyoung lady in your position may or may not venture to do. I do not think\nyou quite understand my ideals or what is becoming as between father and\ndaughter. Your attitude to me--\"\n\nHe fell into a brown study. It was so difficult to put precisely.\n\n\"--and your aunt--\"\n\nFor a time he searched for the mot juste. Then he went on:\n\n\"--and, indeed, to most of the established things in life is, frankly,\nunsatisfactory. You are restless, aggressive, critical with all\nthe crude unthinking criticism of youth. You have no grasp upon the\nessential facts of life (I pray God you never may), and in your rash\nignorance you are prepared to dash into positions that may end in\nlifelong regret. The life of a young girl is set about with prowling\npitfalls.\"\n\nHe was arrested for a moment by an indistinct picture of Veronica\nreading this last sentence. But he was now too deeply moved to trace\na certain unsatisfactoriness to its source in a mixture of metaphors.\n\"Well,\" he said, argumentatively, \"it IS. That's all about it. It's time\nshe knew.\"\n\n\"The life of a young girl is set about with prowling pitfalls, from\nwhich she must be shielded at all costs.\"\n\nHis lips tightened, and he frowned with solemn resolution.\n\n\"So long as I am your father, so long as your life is entrusted to my\ncare, I feel bound by every obligation to use my authority to check this\nodd disposition of yours toward extravagant enterprises. A day will come\nwhen you will thank me. It is not, my dear Veronica, that I think there\nis any harm in you; there is not. But a girl is soiled not only by evil\nbut by the proximity of evil, and a reputation for rashness may do\nher as serious an injury as really reprehensible conduct. So do please\nbelieve that in this matter I am acting for the best.\"\n\nHe signed his name and reflected. Then he opened the study door and\ncalled \"Mollie!\" and returned to assume an attitude of authority on the\nhearthrug, before the blue flames and orange glow of the gas fire.\n\nHis sister appeared.\n\nShe was dressed in one of those complicated dresses that are all lace\nand work and confused patternings of black and purple and cream about\nthe body, and she was in many ways a younger feminine version of the\nsame theme as himself. She had the same sharp nose--which, indeed, only\nAnn Veronica, of all the family, had escaped. She carried herself well,\nwhereas her brother slouched, and there was a certain aristocratic\ndignity about her that she had acquired through her long engagement to\na curate of family, a scion of the Wiltshire Edmondshaws. He had died\nbefore they married, and when her brother became a widower she had\ncome to his assistance and taken over much of the care of his youngest\ndaughter. But from the first her rather old-fashioned conception of life\nhad jarred with the suburban atmosphere, the High School spirit and the\nmemories of the light and little Mrs. Stanley, whose family had been by\nany reckoning inconsiderable--to use the kindliest term. Miss Stanley\nhad determined from the outset to have the warmest affection for her\nyoungest niece and to be a second mother in her life--a second and a\nbetter one; but she had found much to battle with, and there was much in\nherself that Ann Veronica failed to understand. She came in now with an\nair of reserved solicitude.\n\nMr. Stanley pointed to the letter with a pipe he had drawn from his\njacket pocket. \"What do you think of that?\" he asked.\n\nShe took it up in her many-ringed hands and read it judicially. He\nfilled his pipe slowly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said at last, \"it is firm and affectionate.\"\n\n\"I could have said more.\"\n\n\"You seem to have said just what had to be said. It seems to me exactly\nwhat is wanted. She really must not go to that affair.\"\n\nShe paused, and he waited for her to speak.\n\n\"I don't think she quite sees the harm of those people or the sort of\nlife to which they would draw her,\" she said. \"They would spoil every\nchance.\"\n\n\"She has chances?\" he said, helping her out.\n\n\"She is an extremely attractive girl,\" she said; and added, \"to some\npeople. Of course, one doesn't like to talk about things until there are\nthings to talk about.\"\n\n\"All the more reason why she shouldn't get herself talked about.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I feel.\"\n\nMr. Stanley took the letter and stood with it in his hand thoughtfully\nfor a time. \"I'd give anything,\" he remarked, \"to see our little Vee\nhappily and comfortably married.\"\n\nHe gave the note to the parlormaid the next morning in an inadvertent,\ncasual manner just as he was leaving the house to catch his London\ntrain. When Ann Veronica got it she had at first a wild, fantastic idea\nthat it contained a tip.\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nAnn Veronica's resolve to have things out with her father was not\naccomplished without difficulty.\n\nHe was not due from the City until about six, and so she went and played\nBadminton with the Widgett girls until dinner-time. The atmosphere at\ndinner was not propitious. Her aunt was blandly amiable above a certain\ntremulous undertow, and talked as if to a caller about the alarming\nspread of marigolds that summer at the end of the garden, a sort of\nYellow Peril to all the smaller hardy annuals, while her father brought\nsome papers to table and presented himself as preoccupied with them. \"It\nreally seems as if we shall have to put down marigolds altogether next\nyear,\" Aunt Molly repeated three times, \"and do away with marguerites.\nThey seed beyond all reason.\" Elizabeth, the parlormaid, kept coming in\nto hand vegetables whenever there seemed a chance of Ann Veronica asking\nfor an interview. Directly dinner was over Mr. Stanley, having pretended\nto linger to smoke, fled suddenly up-stairs to petrography, and when\nVeronica tapped he answered through the locked door, \"Go away, Vee! I'm\nbusy,\" and made a lapidary's wheel buzz loudly.\n\nBreakfast, too, was an impossible occasion. He read the Times with an\nunusually passionate intentness, and then declared suddenly for the\nearlier of the two trains he used.\n\n\"I'll come to the station,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I may as well come up by\nthis train.\"\n\n\"I may have to run,\" said her father, with an appeal to his watch.\n\n\"I'll run, too,\" she volunteered.\n\nInstead of which they walked sharply....\n\n\"I say, daddy,\" she began, and was suddenly short of breath.\n\n\"If it's about that dance project,\" he said, \"it's no good, Veronica.\nI've made up my mind.\"\n\n\"You'll make me look a fool before all my friends.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have made an engagement until you'd consulted your aunt.\"\n\n\"I thought I was old enough,\" she gasped, between laughter and crying.\n\nHer father's step quickened to a trot. \"I won't have you quarrelling and\ncrying in the Avenue,\" he said. \"Stop it!... If you've got anything\nto say, you must say it to your aunt--\"\n\n\"But look here, daddy!\"\n\nHe flapped the Times at her with an imperious gesture.\n\n\"It's settled. You're not to go. You're NOT to go.\"\n\n\"But it's about other things.\"\n\n\"I don't care. This isn't the place.\"\n\n\"Then may I come to the study to-night--after dinner?\"\n\n\"I'm--BUSY!\"\n\n\"It's important. If I can't talk anywhere else--I DO want an\nunderstanding.\"\n\nAhead of them walked a gentleman whom it was evident they must at their\npresent pace very speedily overtake. It was Ramage, the occupant of the\nbig house at the end of the Avenue. He had recently made Mr. Stanley's\nacquaintance in the train and shown him one or two trifling civilities.\nHe was an outside broker and the proprietor of a financial newspaper; he\nhad come up very rapidly in the last few years, and Mr. Stanley admired\nand detested him in almost equal measure. It was intolerable to think\nthat he might overhear words and phrases. Mr. Stanley's pace slackened.\n\n\"You've no right to badger me like this, Veronica,\" he said. \"I can't\nsee what possible benefit can come of discussing things that are\nsettled. If you want advice, your aunt is the person. However, if you\nmust air your opinions--\"\n\n\"To-night, then, daddy!\"\n\nHe made an angry but conceivably an assenting noise, and then Ramage\nglanced back and stopped, saluted elaborately, and waited for them to\ncome up. He was a square-faced man of nearly fifty, with iron-gray hair\na mobile, clean-shaven mouth and rather protuberant black eyes that now\nscrutinized Ann Veronica. He dressed rather after the fashion of the\nWest End than the City, and affected a cultured urbanity that somehow\ndisconcerted and always annoyed Ann Veronica's father extremely. He\ndid not play golf, but took his exercise on horseback, which was also\nunsympathetic.\n\n\"Stuffy these trees make the Avenue,\" said Mr. Stanley as they drew\nalongside, to account for his own ruffled and heated expression. \"They\nought to have been lopped in the spring.\"\n\n\"There's plenty of time,\" said Ramage. \"Is Miss Stanley coming up with\nus?\"\n\n\"I go second,\" she said, \"and change at Wimbledon.\"\n\n\"We'll all go second,\" said Ramage, \"if we may?\"\n\nMr. Stanley wanted to object strongly, but as he could not immediately\nthink how to put it, he contented himself with a grunt, and the motion\nwas carried. \"How's Mrs. Ramage?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very much as usual,\" said Ramage. \"She finds lying up so much very\nirksome. But, you see, she HAS to lie up.\"\n\nThe topic of his invalid wife bored him, and he turned at once to Ann\nVeronica. \"And where are YOU going?\" he said. \"Are you going on again\nthis winter with that scientific work of yours? It's an instance of\nheredity, I suppose.\" For a moment Mr. Stanley almost liked Ramage.\n\"You're a biologist, aren't you?\"\n\nHe began to talk of his own impressions of biology as a commonplace\nmagazine reader who had to get what he could from the monthly reviews,\nand was glad to meet with any information from nearer the fountainhead.\nIn a little while he and she were talking quite easily and agreeably.\nThey went on talking in the train--it seemed to her father a slight want\nof deference to him--and he listened and pretended to read the Times. He\nwas struck disagreeably by Ramage's air of gallant consideration and Ann\nVeronica's self-possessed answers. These things did not harmonize with\nhis conception of the forthcoming (if unavoidable) interview. After\nall, it came to him suddenly as a harsh discovery that she might be in\na sense regarded as grownup. He was a man who in all things classified\nwithout nuance, and for him there were in the matter of age just two\nfeminine classes and no more--girls and women. The distinction lay\nchiefly in the right to pat their heads. But here was a girl--she must\nbe a girl, since she was his daughter and pat-able--imitating the\nwoman quite remarkably and cleverly. He resumed his listening. She was\ndiscussing one of those modern advanced plays with a remarkable, with an\nextraordinary, confidence.\n\n\"His love-making,\" she remarked, \"struck me as unconvincing. He seemed\ntoo noisy.\"\n\nThe full significance of her words did not instantly appear to him. Then\nit dawned. Good heavens! She was discussing love-making. For a time he\nheard no more, and stared with stony eyes at a Book-War proclamation in\nleaded type that filled half a column of the Times that day. Could she\nunderstand what she was talking about? Luckily it was a second-class\ncarriage and the ordinary fellow-travellers were not there. Everybody,\nhe felt, must be listening behind their papers.\n\nOf course, girls repeat phrases and opinions of which they cannot\npossibly understand the meaning. But a middle-aged man like Ramage ought\nto know better than to draw out a girl, the daughter of a friend and\nneighbor....\n\nWell, after all, he seemed to be turning the subject. \"Broddick is a\nheavy man,\" he was saying, \"and the main interest of the play was the\nembezzlement.\" Thank Heaven! Mr. Stanley allowed his paper to drop\na little, and scrutinized the hats and brows of their three\nfellow-travellers.\n\nThey reached Wimbledon, and Ramage whipped out to hand Miss Stanley\nto the platform as though she had been a duchess, and she descended as\nthough such attentions from middle-aged, but still gallant, merchants\nwere a matter of course. Then, as Ramage readjusted himself in a corner,\nhe remarked: \"These young people shoot up, Stanley. It seems only\nyesterday that she was running down the Avenue, all hair and legs.\"\n\nMr. Stanley regarded him through his glasses with something approaching\nanimosity.\n\n\"Now she's all hat and ideas,\" he said, with an air of humor.\n\n\"She seems an unusually clever girl,\" said Ramage.\n\nMr. Stanley regarded his neighbor's clean-shaven face almost warily.\n\"I'm not sure whether we don't rather overdo all this higher education,\"\nhe said, with an effect of conveying profound meanings.\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nHe became quite sure, by a sort of accumulation of reflection, as the\nday wore on. He found his youngest daughter intrusive in his thoughts\nall through the morning, and still more so in the afternoon. He saw her\nyoung and graceful back as she descended from the carriage, severely\nignoring him, and recalled a glimpse he had of her face, bright and\nserene, as his train ran out of Wimbledon. He recalled with exasperating\nperplexity her clear, matter-of-fact tone as she talked about\nlove-making being unconvincing. He was really very proud of her, and\nextraordinarily angry and resentful at the innocent and audacious\nself-reliance that seemed to intimate her sense of absolute independence\nof him, her absolute security without him. After all, she only LOOKED a\nwoman. She was rash and ignorant, absolutely inexperienced. Absolutely.\nHe began to think of speeches, very firm, explicit speeches, he would\nmake.\n\nHe lunched in the Legal Club in Chancery Lane, and met Ogilvy. Daughters\nwere in the air that day. Ogilvy was full of a client's trouble in\nthat matter, a grave and even tragic trouble. He told some of the\nparticulars.\n\n\"Curious case,\" said Ogilvy, buttering his bread and cutting it up in a\nway he had. \"Curious case--and sets one thinking.\"\n\nHe resumed, after a mouthful: \"Here is a girl of sixteen or seventeen,\nseventeen and a half to be exact, running about, as one might say, in\nLondon. Schoolgirl. Her family are solid West End people, Kensington\npeople. Father--dead. She goes out and comes home. Afterward goes on to\nOxford. Twenty-one, twenty-two. Why doesn't she marry? Plenty of money\nunder her father's will. Charming girl.\"\n\nHe consumed Irish stew for some moments.\n\n\"Married already,\" he said, with his mouth full. \"Shopman.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said Mr. Stanley.\n\n\"Good-looking rascal she met at Worthing. Very romantic and all that. He\nfixed it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"He left her alone. Pure romantic nonsense on her part. Sheer\ncalculation on his. Went up to Somerset House to examine the will before\nhe did it. Yes. Nice position.\"\n\n\"She doesn't care for him now?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. What a girl of sixteen cares for is hair and a high color\nand moonlight and a tenor voice. I suppose most of our daughters would\nmarry organ-grinders if they had a chance--at that age. My son wanted\nto marry a woman of thirty in a tobacconist's shop. Only a son's another\nstory. We fixed that. Well, that's the situation. My people don't know\nwhat to do. Can't face a scandal. Can't ask the gent to go abroad and\ncondone a bigamy. He misstated her age and address; but you can't get\nhome on him for a thing like that.... There you are! Girl spoilt for\nlife. Makes one want to go back to the Oriental system!\"\n\nMr. Stanley poured wine. \"Damned Rascal!\" he said. \"Isn't there a\nbrother to kick him?\"\n\n\"Mere satisfaction,\" reflected Ogilvy. \"Mere sensuality. I rather think\nthey have kicked him, from the tone of some of the letters. Nice, of\ncourse. But it doesn't alter the situation.\"\n\n\"It's these Rascals,\" said Mr. Stanley, and paused.\n\n\"Always has been,\" said Ogilvy. \"Our interest lies in heading them off.\"\n\n\"There was a time when girls didn't get these extravagant ideas.\"\n\n\"Lydia Languish, for example. Anyhow, they didn't run about so much.\"\n\n\"Yes. That's about the beginning. It's these damned novels. All this\ntorrent of misleading, spurious stuff that pours from the press. These\nsham ideals and advanced notions. Women who Dids, and all that kind of\nthing....\"\n\nOgilvy reflected. \"This girl--she's really a very charming, frank\nperson--had had her imagination fired, so she told me, by a school\nperformance of Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\nMr. Stanley decided to treat that as irrelevant. \"There ought to be a\nCensorship of Books. We want it badly at the present time. Even WITH\nthe Censorship of Plays there's hardly a decent thing to which a man can\ntake his wife and daughters, a creeping taint of suggestion everywhere.\nWhat would it be without that safeguard?\"\n\nOgilvy pursued his own topic. \"I'm inclined to think, Stanley, myself\nthat as a matter of fact it was the expurgated Romeo and Juliet did the\nmischief. If our young person hadn't had the nurse part cut out, eh? She\nmight have known more and done less. I was curious about that. All they\nleft it was the moon and stars. And the balcony and 'My Romeo!'\"\n\n\"Shakespeare is altogether different from the modern stuff. Altogether\ndifferent. I'm not discussing Shakespeare. I don't want to Bowdlerize\nShakespeare. I'm not that sort I quite agree. But this modern miasma--\"\n\nMr. Stanley took mustard savagely.\n\n\"Well, we won't go into Shakespeare,\" said Ogilvy \"What interests me\nis that our young women nowadays are running about as free as air\npractically, with registry offices and all sorts of accommodation round\nthe corner. Nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of\ntelling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations. And in that\nrespect they stir up one another. Not my affair, of course, but I think\nwe ought to teach them more or restrain them more. One or the other.\nThey're too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom.\nThat's my point. Are you going to have any apple-tart, Stanley? The\napple-tart's been very good lately--very good!\"\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nAt the end of dinner that evening Ann Veronica began: \"Father!\"\n\nHer father looked at her over his glasses and spoke with grave\ndeliberation; \"If there is anything you want to say to me,\" he said,\n\"you must say it in the study. I am going to smoke a little here, and\nthen I shall go to the study. I don't see what you can have to say. I\nshould have thought my note cleared up everything. There are some papers\nI have to look through to-night--important papers.\"\n\n\"I won't keep you very long, daddy,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I don't see, Mollie,\" he remarked, taking a cigar from the box on\nthe table as his sister and daughter rose, \"why you and Vee shouldn't\ndiscuss this little affair--whatever it is--without bothering me.\"\n\nIt was the first time this controversy had become triangular, for all\nthree of them were shy by habit.\n\nHe stopped in mid-sentence, and Ann Veronica opened the door for her\naunt. The air was thick with feelings. Her aunt went out of the room\nwith dignity and a rustle, and up-stairs to the fastness of her own\nroom. She agreed entirely with her brother. It distressed and confused\nher that the girl should not come to her.\n\nIt seemed to show a want of affection, to be a deliberate and unmerited\ndisregard, to justify the reprisal of being hurt.\n\nWhen Ann Veronica came into the study she found every evidence of a\ncarefully foreseen grouping about the gas fire. Both arm-chairs had been\nmoved a little so as to face each other on either side of the\nfender, and in the circular glow of the green-shaded lamp there lay,\nconspicuously waiting, a thick bundle of blue and white papers tied\nwith pink tape. Her father held some printed document in his hand,\nand appeared not to observe her entry. \"Sit down,\" he said, and\nperused--\"perused\" is the word for it--for some moments. Then he put\nthe paper by. \"And what is it all about, Veronica?\" he asked, with a\ndeliberate note of irony, looking at her a little quizzically over his\nglasses.\n\nAnn Veronica looked bright and a little elated, and she disregarded\nher father's invitation to be seated. She stood on the mat instead, and\nlooked down on him. \"Look here, daddy,\" she said, in a tone of great\nreasonableness, \"I MUST go to that dance, you know.\"\n\nHer father's irony deepened. \"Why?\" he asked, suavely.\n\nHer answer was not quite ready. \"Well, because I don't see any reason\nwhy I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"You see I do.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I go?\"\n\n\"It isn't a suitable place; it isn't a suitable gathering.\"\n\n\"But, daddy, what do you know of the place and the gathering?\"\n\n\"And it's entirely out of order; it isn't right, it isn't correct;\nit's impossible for you to stay in an hotel in London--the idea is\npreposterous. I can't imagine what possessed you, Veronica.\"\n\nHe put his head on one side, pulled down the corners of his mouth, and\nlooked at her over his glasses.\n\n\"But why is it preposterous?\" asked Ann Veronica, and fiddled with a\npipe on the mantel.\n\n\"Surely!\" he remarked, with an expression of worried appeal.\n\n\"You see, daddy, I don't think it IS preposterous. That's really what\nI want to discuss. It comes to this--am I to be trusted to take care of\nmyself, or am I not?\"\n\n\"To judge from this proposal of yours, I should say not.\"\n\n\"I think I am.\"\n\n\"As long as you remain under my roof--\" he began, and paused.\n\n\"You are going to treat me as though I wasn't. Well, I don't think\nthat's fair.\"\n\n\"Your ideas of fairness--\" he remarked, and discontinued that sentence.\n\"My dear girl,\" he said, in a tone of patient reasonableness, \"you are a\nmere child. You know nothing of life, nothing of its dangers, nothing of\nits possibilities. You think everything is harmless and simple, and so\nforth. It isn't. It isn't. That's where you go wrong. In some things,\nin many things, you must trust to your elders, to those who know more of\nlife than you do. Your aunt and I have discussed all this matter. There\nit is. You can't go.\"\n\nThe conversation hung for a moment. Ann Veronica tried to keep hold of\na complicated situation and not lose her head. She had turned round\nsideways, so as to look down into the fire.\n\n\"You see, father,\" she said, \"it isn't only this affair of the dance.\nI want to go to that because it's a new experience, because I think\nit will be interesting and give me a view of things. You say I know\nnothing. That's probably true. But how am I to know of things?\"\n\n\"Some things I hope you may never know,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not so sure. I want to know--just as much as I can.\"\n\n\"Tut!\" he said, fuming, and put out his hand to the papers in the pink\ntape.\n\n\"Well, I do. It's just that I want to say. I want to be a human being;\nI want to learn about things and know about things, and not to be\nprotected as something too precious for life, cooped up in one narrow\nlittle corner.\"\n\n\"Cooped up!\" he cried. \"Did I stand in the way of your going to college?\nHave I ever prevented you going about at any reasonable hour? You've got\na bicycle!\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Ann Veronica, and then went on \"I want to be taken\nseriously. A girl--at my age--is grown-up. I want to go on with\nmy University work under proper conditions, now that I've done the\nIntermediate. It isn't as though I haven't done well. I've never muffed\nan exam yet. Roddy muffed two....\"\n\nHer father interrupted. \"Now look here, Veronica, let us be plain with\neach other. You are not going to that infidel Russell's classes. You are\nnot going anywhere but to the Tredgold College. I've thought that out,\nand you must make up your mind to it. All sorts of considerations come\nin. While you live in my house you must follow my ideas. You are wrong\neven about that man's scientific position and his standard of work.\nThere are men in the Lowndean who laugh at him--simply laugh at him.\nAnd I have seen work by his pupils myself that struck me as being--well,\nnext door to shameful. There's stories, too, about his demonstrator,\nCapes Something or other. The kind of man who isn't content with his\nscience, and writes articles in the monthly reviews. Anyhow, there it\nis: YOU ARE NOT GOING THERE.\"\n\nThe girl received this intimation in silence, but the face that looked\ndown upon the gas fire took an expression of obstinacy that brought out\na hitherto latent resemblance between parent and child. When she spoke,\nher lips twitched.\n\n\"Then I suppose when I have graduated I am to come home?\"\n\n\"It seems the natural course--\"\n\n\"And do nothing?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of things a girl can find to do at home.\"\n\n\"Until some one takes pity on me and marries me?\"\n\nHe raised his eyebrows in mild appeal. His foot tapped impatiently, and\nhe took up the papers.\n\n\"Look here, father,\" she said, with a change in her voice, \"suppose I\nwon't stand it?\"\n\nHe regarded her as though this was a new idea.\n\n\"Suppose, for example, I go to this dance?\"\n\n\"You won't.\"\n\n\"Well\"--her breath failed her for a moment. \"How would you prevent it?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"But I have forbidden it!\" he said, raising his voice.\n\n\"Yes, I know. But suppose I go?\"\n\n\"Now, Veronica! No, no. This won't do. Understand me! I forbid it. I\ndo not want to hear from you even the threat of disobedience.\" He spoke\nloudly. \"The thing is forbidden!\"\n\n\"I am ready to give up anything that you show to be wrong.\"\n\n\"You will give up anything I wish you to give up.\"\n\nThey stared at each other through a pause, and both faces were flushed\nand obstinate.\n\nShe was trying by some wonderful, secret, and motionless gymnastics to\nrestrain her tears. But when she spoke her lips quivered, and they\ncame. \"I mean to go to that dance!\" she blubbered. \"I mean to go to\nthat dance! I meant to reason with you, but you won't reason. You're\ndogmatic.\"\n\nAt the sight of her tears his expression changed to a mingling of\ntriumph and concern. He stood up, apparently intending to put an\narm about her, but she stepped back from him quickly. She produced a\nhandkerchief, and with one sweep of this and a simultaneous gulp had\nabolished her fit of weeping. His voice now had lost its ironies.\n\n\"Now, Veronica,\" he pleaded, \"Veronica, this is most unreasonable. All\nwe do is for your good. Neither your aunt nor I have any other thought\nbut what is best for you.\"\n\n\"Only you won't let me live. Only you won't let me exist!\"\n\nMr. Stanley lost patience. He bullied frankly.\n\n\"What nonsense is this? What raving! My dear child, you DO live, you\nDO exist! You have this home. You have friends, acquaintances, social\nstanding, brothers and sisters, every advantage! Instead of which, you\nwant to go to some mixed classes or other and cut up rabbits and dance\nabout at nights in wild costumes with casual art student friends and God\nknows who. That--that isn't living! You are beside yourself. You don't\nknow what you ask nor what you say. You have neither reason nor logic.\nI am sorry to seem to hurt you, but all I say is for your good. You\nMUST not, you SHALL not go. On this I am resolved. I put my foot down\nlike--like adamant. And a time will come, Veronica, mark my words, a\ntime will come when you will bless me for my firmness to-night. It goes\nto my heart to disappoint you, but this thing must not be.\"\n\nHe sidled toward her, but she recoiled from him, leaving him in\npossession of the hearth-rug.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"good-night, father.\"\n\n\"What!\" he asked; \"not a kiss?\"\n\nShe affected not to hear.\n\nThe door closed softly upon her. For a long time he remained standing\nbefore the fire, staring at the situation. Then he sat down and filled\nhis pipe slowly and thoughtfully....\n\n\"I don't see what else I could have said,\" he remarked.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\n\nANN VERONICA GATHERS POINTS OF VIEW\n\nPart 1\n\n\n\"Are you coming to the Fadden Dance, Ann Veronica?\" asked Constance\nWidgett.\n\nAnn Veronica considered her answer. \"I mean to,\" she replied.\n\n\"You are making your dress?\"\n\n\"Such as it is.\"\n\nThey were in the elder Widgett girl's bedroom; Hetty was laid up, she\nsaid, with a sprained ankle, and a miscellaneous party was gossiping\naway her tedium. It was a large, littered, self-forgetful apartment,\ndecorated with unframed charcoal sketches by various incipient masters;\nand an open bookcase, surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a\nhuman skull, displayed an odd miscellany of books--Shaw and Swinburne,\nTom Jones, Fabian Essays, Pope and Dumas, cheek by jowl. Constance\nWidgett's abundant copper-red hair was bent down over some dimly\nremunerative work--stencilling in colors upon rough, white material--at\na kitchen table she had dragged up-stairs for the purpose, while on her\nbed there was seated a slender lady of thirty or so in a dingy green\ndress, whom Constance had introduced with a wave of her hand as Miss\nMiniver. Miss Miniver looked out on the world through large emotional\nblue eyes that were further magnified by the glasses she wore, and her\nnose was pinched and pink, and her mouth was whimsically petulant. Her\nglasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face.\nShe seemed bursting with the desire to talk, and watching for her\nopportunity. On her lapel was an ivory button, bearing the words \"Votes\nfor Women.\" Ann Veronica sat at the foot of the sufferer's bed, while\nTeddy Widgett, being something of an athlete, occupied the only\nbed-room chair--a decadent piece, essentially a tripod and largely a\nformality--and smoked cigarettes, and tried to conceal the fact that\nhe was looking all the time at Ann Veronica's eyebrows. Teddy was the\nhatless young man who had turned Ann Veronica aside from the Avenue two\ndays before. He was the junior of both his sisters, co-educated and\nmuch broken in to feminine society. A bowl of roses, just brought by\nAnn Veronica, adorned the communal dressing-table, and Ann Veronica was\nparticularly trim in preparation for a call she was to make with her\naunt later in the afternoon.\n\nAnn Veronica decided to be more explicit. \"I've been,\" she said,\n\"forbidden to come.\"\n\n\"Hul-LO!\" said Hetty, turning her head on the pillow; and Teddy remarked\nwith profound emotion, \"My God!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica, \"and that complicates the situation.\"\n\n\"Auntie?\" asked Constance, who was conversant with Ann Veronica's\naffairs.\n\n\"No! My father. It's--it's a serious prohibition.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Hetty.\n\n\"That's the point. I asked him why, and he hadn't a reason.\"\n\n\"YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER FOR A REASON!\" said Miss Miniver, with great\nintensity.\n\n\"Yes. I tried to have it out with him, but he wouldn't have it out.\" Ann\nVeronica reflected for an instant \"That's why I think I ought to come.\"\n\n\"You asked your father for a reason!\" Miss Miniver repeated.\n\n\"We always have things out with OUR father, poor dear!\" said Hetty.\n\"He's got almost to like it.\"\n\n\"Men,\" said Miss Miniver, \"NEVER have a reason. Never! And they don't\nknow it! They have no idea of it. It's one of their worst traits, one of\ntheir very worst.\"\n\n\"But I say, Vee,\" said Constance, \"if you come and you are forbidden to\ncome there'll be the deuce of a row.\"\n\nAnn Veronica was deciding for further confidences. Her situation\nwas perplexing her very much, and the Widgett atmosphere was lax and\nsympathetic, and provocative of discussion. \"It isn't only the dance,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"There's the classes,\" said Constance, the well-informed.\n\n\"There's the whole situation. Apparently I'm not to exist yet. I'm not\nto study, I'm not to grow. I've got to stay at home and remain in a\nstate of suspended animation.\"\n\n\"DUSTING!\" said Miss Miniver, in a sepulchral voice.\n\n\"Until you marry, Vee,\" said Hetty.\n\n\"Well, I don't feel like standing it.\"\n\n\"Thousands of women have married merely for freedom,\" said Miss Miniver.\n\"Thousands! Ugh! And found it a worse slavery.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Constance, stencilling away at bright pink petals,\n\"it's our lot. But it's very beastly.\"\n\n\"What's our lot?\" asked her sister.\n\n\"Slavery! Downtroddenness! When I think of it I feel all over boot\nmarks--men's boots. We hide it bravely, but so it is. Damn! I've\nsplashed.\"\n\nMiss Miniver's manner became impressive. She addressed Ann Veronica\nwith an air of conveying great open secrets to her. \"As things are at\npresent,\" she said, \"it is true. We live under man-made institutions,\nand that is what they amount to. Every girl in the world practically,\nexcept a few of us who teach or type-write, and then we're underpaid and\nsweated--it's dreadful to think how we are sweated!\" She had lost her\ngeneralization, whatever it was. She hung for a moment, and then went\non, conclusively, \"Until we have the vote that is how things WILL be.\"\n\n\"I'm all for the vote,\" said Teddy.\n\n\"I suppose a girl MUST be underpaid and sweated,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I\nsuppose there's no way of getting a decent income--independently.\"\n\n\"Women have practically NO economic freedom,\" said Miss Miniver,\n\"because they have no political freedom. Men have seen to that. The one\nprofession, the one decent profession, I mean, for a woman--except the\nstage--is teaching, and there we trample on one another. Everywhere\nelse--the law, medicine, the Stock Exchange--prejudice bars us.\"\n\n\"There's art,\" said Ann Veronica, \"and writing.\"\n\n\"Every one hasn't the Gift. Even there a woman never gets a fair chance.\nMen are against her. Whatever she does is minimized. All the best\nnovels have been written by women, and yet see how men sneer at the lady\nnovelist still! There's only one way to get on for a woman, and that is\nto please men. That is what they think we are for!\"\n\n\"We're beasts,\" said Teddy. \"Beasts!\"\n\nBut Miss Miniver took no notice of his admission.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Miss Miniver--she went on in a regularly undulating\nvoice--\"we DO please men. We have that gift. We can see round them and\nbehind them and through them, and most of us use that knowledge, in the\nsilent way we have, for our great ends. Not all of us, but some of us.\nToo many. I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask aside--if\nwe really told them what WE thought of them, really showed them what WE\nwere.\" A flush of excitement crept into her cheeks.\n\n\"Maternity,\" she said, \"has been our undoing.\"\n\nFrom that she opened out into a long, confused emphatic discourse on the\nposition of women, full of wonderful statements, while Constance worked\nat her stencilling and Ann Veronica and Hetty listened, and Teddy\ncontributed sympathetic noises and consumed cheap cigarettes. As she\ntalked she made weak little gestures with her hands, and she thrust her\nface forward from her bent shoulders; and she peered sometimes at Ann\nVeronica and sometimes at a photograph of the Axenstrasse, near\nFluelen, that hung upon the wall. Ann Veronica watched her face, vaguely\nsympathizing with her, vaguely disliking her physical insufficiency and\nher convulsive movements, and the fine eyebrows were knit with a faint\nperplexity. Essentially the talk was a mixture of fragments of sentences\nheard, of passages read, or arguments indicated rather than stated, and\nall of it was served in a sauce of strange enthusiasm, thin yet\nintense. Ann Veronica had had some training at the Tredgold College in\ndisentangling threads from confused statements, and she had a curious\npersuasion that in all this fluent muddle there was something--something\nreal, something that signified. But it was very hard to follow. She did\nnot understand the note of hostility to men that ran through it all, the\nbitter vindictiveness that lit Miss Miniver's cheeks and eyes, the\nsense of some at last insupportable wrong slowly accumulated. She had no\ninkling of that insupportable wrong.\n\n\"We are the species,\" said Miss Miniver, \"men are only incidents.\nThey give themselves airs, but so it is. In all the species of animals\nthe females are more important than the males; the males have to please\nthem. Look at the cock's feathers, look at the competition there is\neverywhere, except among humans. The stags and oxen and things all\nhave to fight for us, everywhere. Only in man is the male made the\nmost important. And that happens through our maternity; it's our very\nimportance that degrades us.\n\n\"While we were minding the children they stole our rights and liberties.\nThe children made us slaves, and the men took advantage of it.\nIt's--Mrs. Shalford says--the accidental conquering the essential.\nOriginally in the first animals there were no males, none at all. It\nhas been proved. Then they appear among the lower things\"--she made\nmeticulous gestures to figure the scale of life; she seemed to be\nholding up specimens, and peering through her glasses at them--\"among\ncrustaceans and things, just as little creatures, ever so inferior to\nthe females. Mere hangers on. Things you would laugh at. And among human\nbeings, too, women to begin with were the rulers and leaders; they owned\nall the property, they invented all the arts.\n\n\"The primitive government was the Matriarchate. The Matriarchate! The\nLords of Creation just ran about and did what they were told.\"\n\n\"But is that really so?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"It has been proved,\" said Miss Miniver, and added, \"by American\nprofessors.\"\n\n\"But how did they prove it?\"\n\n\"By science,\" said Miss Miniver, and hurried on, putting out a\nrhetorical hand that showed a slash of finger through its glove. \"And\nnow, look at us! See what we have become. Toys! Delicate trifles! A sex\nof invalids. It is we who have become the parasites and toys.\"\n\nIt was, Ann Veronica felt, at once absurd and extraordinarily right.\nHetty, who had periods of lucid expression, put the thing for her\nfrom her pillow. She charged boldly into the space of Miss Miniver's\nrhetorical pause.\n\n\"It isn't quite that we're toys. Nobody toys with me. Nobody regards\nConstance or Vee as a delicate trifle.\"\n\nTeddy made some confused noise, a thoracic street row; some remark was\nassassinated by a rival in his throat and buried hastily under a cough.\n\n\"They'd better not,\" said Hetty. \"The point is we're not toys, toys\nisn't the word; we're litter. We're handfuls. We're regarded as\ninflammable litter that mustn't be left about. We are the species, and\nmaternity is our game; that's all right, but nobody wants that admitted\nfor fear we should all catch fire, and set about fulfilling the purpose\nof our beings without waiting for further explanations. As if we didn't\nknow! The practical trouble is our ages. They used to marry us off at\nseventeen, rush us into things before we had time to protest. They don't\nnow. Heaven knows why! They don't marry most of us off now until high up\nin the twenties. And the age gets higher. We have to hang about in the\ninterval. There's a great gulf opened, and nobody's got any plans what\nto do with us. So the world is choked with waste and waiting daughters.\nHanging about! And they start thinking and asking questions, and begin\nto be neither one thing nor the other. We're partly human beings and\npartly females in suspense.\"\n\nMiss Miniver followed with an expression of perplexity, her mouth shaped\nto futile expositions. The Widgett method of thought puzzled her weakly\nrhetorical mind. \"There is no remedy, girls,\" she began, breathlessly,\n\"except the Vote. Give us that--\"\n\nAnn Veronica came in with a certain disregard of Miss Miniver. \"That's\nit,\" she said. \"They have no plans for us. They have no ideas what to do\nwith us.\"\n\n\"Except,\" said Constance, surveying her work with her head on one side,\n\"to keep the matches from the litter.\"\n\n\"And they won't let us make plans for ourselves.\"\n\n\"We will,\" said Miss Miniver, refusing to be suppressed, \"if some of us\nhave to be killed to get it.\" And she pressed her lips together in white\nresolution and nodded, and she was manifestly full of that same passion\nfor conflict and self-sacrifice that has given the world martyrs since\nthe beginning of things. \"I wish I could make every woman, every girl,\nsee this as clearly as I see it--just what the Vote means to us. Just\nwhat it means....\"\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nAs Ann Veronica went back along the Avenue to her aunt she became aware\nof a light-footed pursuer running. Teddy overtook her, a little out of\nbreath, his innocent face flushed, his straw-colored hair disordered. He\nwas out of breath, and spoke in broken sentences.\n\n\"I say, Vee. Half a minute, Vee. It's like this: You want freedom. Look\nhere. You know--if you want freedom. Just an idea of mine. You know\nhow those Russian students do? In Russia. Just a formal marriage. Mere\nformality. Liberates the girl from parental control. See? You marry me.\nSimply. No further responsibility whatever. Without hindrance--present\noccupation. Why not? Quite willing. Get a license--just an idea of mine.\nDoesn't matter a bit to me. Do anything to please you, Vee. Anything.\nNot fit to be dust on your boots. Still--there you are!\"\n\nHe paused.\n\nAnn Veronica's desire to laugh unrestrainedly was checked by the\ntremendous earnestness of his expression. \"Awfully good of you, Teddy.\"\nshe said.\n\nHe nodded silently, too full for words.\n\n\"But I don't see,\" said Ann Veronica, \"just how it fits the present\nsituation.\"\n\n\"No! Well, I just suggested it. Threw it out. Of course, if at any\ntime--see reason--alter your opinion. Always at your service. No\noffence, I hope. All right! I'm off. Due to play hockey. Jackson's.\nHorrid snorters! So long, Vee! Just suggested it. See? Nothing really.\nPassing thought.\"\n\n\"Teddy,\" said Ann Veronica, \"you're a dear!\"\n\n\"Oh, quite!\" said Teddy, convulsively, and lifted an imaginary hat and\nleft her.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nThe call Ann Veronica paid with her aunt that afternoon had at first\nmuch the same relation to the Widgett conversation that a plaster statue\nof Mr. Gladstone would have to a carelessly displayed interior on a\ndissecting-room table. The Widgetts talked with a remarkable absence of\nexternal coverings; the Palsworthys found all the meanings of life on\nits surfaces. They seemed the most wrapped things in all Ann Veronica's\nwrappered world. The Widgett mental furniture was perhaps worn and\nshabby, but there it was before you, undisguised, fading visibly in an\nalmost pitiless sunlight. Lady Palsworthy was the widow of a knight\nwho had won his spurs in the wholesale coal trade, she was of good\nseventeenth-century attorney blood, a county family, and distantly\nrelated to Aunt Mollie's deceased curate. She was the social leader of\nMorningside Park, and in her superficial and euphuistic way an extremely\nkind and pleasant woman. With her lived a Mrs. Pramlay, a sister of\nthe Morningside Park doctor, and a very active and useful member of the\nCommittee of the Impoverished Gentlewomen's Aid Society. Both ladies\nwere on easy and friendly terms with all that was best in Morningside\nPark society; they had an afternoon once a month that was quite well\nattended, they sometimes gave musical evenings, they dined out and gave\na finish to people's dinners, they had a full-sized croquet lawn and\ntennis beyond, and understood the art of bringing people together.\nAnd they never talked of anything at all, never discussed, never even\nencouraged gossip. They were just nice.\n\nAnn Veronica found herself walking back down the Avenue that had just\nbeen the scene of her first proposal beside her aunt, and speculating\nfor the first time in her life about that lady's mental attitudes. Her\nprevailing effect was one of quiet and complete assurance, as though she\nknew all about everything, and was only restrained by her instinctive\ndelicacy from telling what she knew. But the restraint exercised by her\ninstinctive delicacy was very great; over and above coarse or sexual\nmatters it covered religion and politics and any mention of money\nmatters or crime, and Ann Veronica found herself wondering whether these\nexclusions represented, after all, anything more than suppressions. Was\nthere anything at all in those locked rooms of her aunt's mind? Were\nthey fully furnished and only a little dusty and cobwebby and in need of\nan airing, or were they stark vacancy except, perhaps, for a cockroach\nor so or the gnawing of a rat? What was the mental equivalent of a rat's\ngnawing? The image was going astray. But what would her aunt think of\nTeddy's recent off-hand suggestion of marriage? What would she think of\nthe Widgett conversation? Suppose she was to tell her aunt quietly\nbut firmly about the parasitic males of degraded crustacea. The girl\nsuppressed a chuckle that would have been inexplicable.\n\nThere came a wild rush of anthropological lore into her brain, a flare\nof indecorous humor. It was one of the secret troubles of her mind, this\ngrotesque twist her ideas would sometimes take, as though they rebelled\nand rioted. After all, she found herself reflecting, behind her aunt's\ncomplacent visage there was a past as lurid as any one's--not, of\ncourse, her aunt's own personal past, which was apparently just that\ncurate and almost incredibly jejune, but an ancestral past with all\nsorts of scandalous things in it: fire and slaughterings, exogamy,\nmarriage by capture, corroborees, cannibalism! Ancestresses with perhaps\ndim anticipatory likenesses to her aunt, their hair less neatly done,\nno doubt, their manners and gestures as yet undisciplined, but still\nancestresses in the direct line, must have danced through a brief and\nstirring life in the woady buff. Was there no echo anywhere in Miss\nStanley's pacified brain? Those empty rooms, if they were empty, were\nthe equivalents of astoundingly decorated predecessors. Perhaps it was\njust as well there was no inherited memory.\n\nAnn Veronica was by this time quite shocked at her own thoughts, and yet\nthey would go on with their freaks. Great vistas of history opened, and\nshe and her aunt were near reverting to the primitive and passionate and\nentirely indecorous arboreal--were swinging from branches by the\narms, and really going on quite dreadfully--when their arrival at\nthe Palsworthys' happily checked this play of fancy, and brought Ann\nVeronica back to the exigencies of the wrappered life again.\n\nLady Palsworthy liked Ann Veronica because she was never awkward,\nhad steady eyes, and an almost invariable neatness and dignity in her\nclothes. She seemed just as stiff and shy as a girl ought to be, Lady\nPalsworthy thought, neither garrulous nor unready, and free from nearly\nall the heavy aggressiveness, the overgrown, overblown quality, the\negotism and want of consideration of the typical modern girl. But then\nLady Palsworthy had never seen Ann Veronica running like the wind\nat hockey. She had never seen her sitting on tables nor heard her\ndiscussing theology, and had failed to observe that the graceful figure\nwas a natural one and not due to ably chosen stays. She took it for\ngranted Ann Veronica wore stays--mild stays, perhaps, but stays, and\nthought no more of the matter. She had seen her really only at teas,\nwith the Stanley strain in her uppermost. There are so many girls\nnowadays who are quite unpresentable at tea, with their untrimmed\nlaughs, their awful dispositions of their legs when they sit down, their\nslangy disrespect; they no longer smoke, it is true, like the girls of\nthe eighties and nineties, nevertheless to a fine intelligence they have\nthe flavor of tobacco. They have no amenities, they scratch the\nmellow surface of things almost as if they did it on purpose; and\nLady Palsworthy and Mrs. Pramlay lived for amenities and the mellowed\nsurfaces of things. Ann Veronica was one of the few young people--and\none must have young people just as one must have flowers--one could ask\nto a little gathering without the risk of a painful discord. Then the\ndistant relationship to Miss Stanley gave them a slight but pleasant\nsense of proprietorship in the girl. They had their little dreams about\nher.\n\nMrs. Pramlay received them in the pretty chintz drawing-room, which\nopened by French windows on the trim garden, with its croquet lawn, its\ntennis-net in the middle distance, and its remote rose alley lined\nwith smart dahlias and flaming sunflowers. Her eye met Miss Stanley's\nunderstandingly, and she was if anything a trifle more affectionate in\nher greeting to Ann Veronica. Then Ann Veronica passed on toward the\ntea in the garden, which was dotted with the elite of Morningside Park\nsociety, and there she was pounced upon by Lady Palsworthy and given tea\nand led about. Across the lawn and hovering indecisively, Ann Veronica\nsaw and immediately affected not to see Mr. Manning, Lady Palsworthy's\nnephew, a tall young man of seven-and-thirty with a handsome,\nthoughtful, impassive face, a full black mustache, and a certain heavy\nluxuriousness of gesture. The party resolved itself for Ann Veronica\ninto a game in which she manoeuvred unostentatiously and finally\nunsuccessfully to avoid talking alone with this gentleman.\n\nMr. Manning had shown on previous occasions that he found Ann Veronica\ninteresting and that he wished to interest her. He was a civil servant\nof some standing, and after a previous conversation upon aesthetics of\na sententious, nebulous, and sympathetic character, he had sent her a\nsmall volume, which he described as the fruits of his leisure and which\nwas as a matter of fact rather carefully finished verse. It dealt with\nfine aspects of Mr. Manning's feelings, and as Ann Veronica's mind\nwas still largely engaged with fundamentals and found no pleasure in\nmetrical forms, she had not as yet cut its pages. So that as she saw him\nshe remarked to herself very faintly but definitely, \"Oh, golly!\" and\nset up a campaign of avoidance that Mr. Manning at last broke down by\ncoming directly at her as she talked with the vicar's aunt about some of\nthe details of the alleged smell of the new church lamps. He did not so\nmuch cut into this conversation as loom over it, for he was a tall, if\nrather studiously stooping, man.\n\nThe face that looked down upon Ann Veronica was full of amiable\nintention. \"Splendid you are looking to-day, Miss Stanley,\" he said.\n\"How well and jolly you must be feeling.\"\n\nHe beamed over the effect of this and shook hands with effusion, and\nLady Palsworthy suddenly appeared as his confederate and disentangled\nthe vicar's aunt.\n\n\"I love this warm end of summer more than words can tell,\" he said.\n\"I've tried to make words tell it. It's no good. Mild, you know, and\nboon. You want music.\"\n\nAnn Veronica agreed, and tried to make the manner of her assent cover a\npossible knowledge of a probable poem.\n\n\"Splendid it must be to be a composer. Glorious! The Pastoral.\nBeethoven; he's the best of them. Don't you think? Tum, tay, tum, tay.\"\n\nAnn Veronica did.\n\n\"What have you been doing since our last talk? Still cutting up\nrabbits and probing into things? I've often thought of that talk of\nours--often.\"\n\nHe did not appear to require any answer to his question.\n\n\"Often,\" he repeated, a little heavily.\n\n\"Beautiful these autumn flowers are,\" said Ann Veronica, in a wide,\nuncomfortable pause.\n\n\"Do come and see the Michaelmas daisies at the end of the garden,\" said\nMr. Manning, \"they're a dream.\" And Ann Veronica found herself being\ncarried off to an isolation even remoter and more conspicuous than the\ncorner of the lawn, with the whole of the party aiding and abetting and\nglancing at them. \"Damn!\" said Ann Veronica to herself, rousing herself\nfor a conflict.\n\nMr. Manning told her he loved beauty, and extorted a similar admission\nfrom her; he then expatiated upon his own love of beauty. He said that\nfor him beauty justified life, that he could not imagine a good action\nthat was not a beautiful one nor any beautiful thing that could be\naltogether bad. Ann Veronica hazarded an opinion that as a matter of\nhistory some very beautiful people had, to a quite considerable extent,\nbeen bad, but Mr. Manning questioned whether when they were bad they\nwere really beautiful or when they were beautiful bad. Ann Veronica\nfound her attention wandering a little as he told her that he was not\nashamed to feel almost slavish in the presence of really beautiful\npeople, and then they came to the Michaelmas daisies. They were really\nvery fine and abundant, with a blaze of perennial sunflowers behind\nthem.\n\n\"They make me want to shout,\" said Mr. Manning, with a sweep of the arm.\n\n\"They're very good this year,\" said Ann Veronica, avoiding controversial\nmatter.\n\n\"Either I want to shout,\" said Mr. Manning, \"when I see beautiful\nthings, or else I want to weep.\" He paused and looked at her, and said,\nwith a sudden drop into a confidential undertone, \"Or else I want to\npray.\"\n\n\"When is Michaelmas Day?\" said Ann Veronica, a little abruptly.\n\n\"Heaven knows!\" said Mr. Manning; and added, \"the twenty-ninth.\"\n\n\"I thought it was earlier,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Wasn't Parliament to\nreassemble?\"\n\nHe put out his hand and leaned against a tree and crossed his legs.\n\"You're not interested in politics?\" he asked, almost with a note of\nprotest.\n\n\"Well, rather,\" said Ann Veronica. \"It seems--It's interesting.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I find my interest in that sort of thing decline and\ndecline.\"\n\n\"I'm curious. Perhaps because I don't know. I suppose an intelligent\nperson OUGHT to be interested in political affairs. They concern us\nall.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Mr. Manning, with a baffling smile.\n\n\"I think they do. After all, they're history in the making.\"\n\n\"A sort of history,\" said Mr. Manning; and repeated, \"a sort of history.\nBut look at these glorious daisies!\"\n\n\"But don't you think political questions ARE important?\"\n\n\"I don't think they are this afternoon, and I don't think they are to\nyou.\"\n\nAnn Veronica turned her back on the Michaelmas daisies, and faced toward\nthe house with an air of a duty completed.\n\n\"Just come to that seat now you are here, Miss Stanley, and look down\nthe other path; there's a vista of just the common sort. Better even\nthan these.\"\n\nAnn Veronica walked as he indicated.\n\n\"You know I'm old-fashioned, Miss Stanley. I don't think women need to\ntrouble about political questions.\"\n\n\"I want a vote,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Really!\" said Mr. Manning, in an earnest voice, and waved his hand to\nthe alley of mauve and purple. \"I wish you didn't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" She turned on him.\n\n\"It jars. It jars with all my ideas. Women to me are something so\nserene, so fine, so feminine, and politics are so dusty, so sordid,\nso wearisome and quarrelsome. It seems to me a woman's duty to be\nbeautiful, to BE beautiful and to behave beautifully, and politics\nare by their very nature ugly. You see, I--I am a woman worshipper.\nI worshipped women long before I found any woman I might ever hope\nto worship. Long ago. And--the idea of committees, of hustings, of\nagenda-papers!\"\n\n\"I don't see why the responsibility of beauty should all be shifted on\nto the women,\" said Ann Veronica, suddenly remembering a part of Miss\nMiniver's discourse.\n\n\"It rests with them by the nature of things. Why should you who are\nqueens come down from your thrones? If you can afford it, WE can't. We\ncan't afford to turn our women, our Madonnas, our Saint Catherines, our\nMona Lisas, our goddesses and angels and fairy princesses, into a sort\nof man. Womanhood is sacred to me. My politics in that matter wouldn't\nbe to give women votes. I'm a Socialist, Miss Stanley.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\" said Ann Veronica, startled.\n\n\"A Socialist of the order of John Ruskin. Indeed I am! I would make this\ncountry a collective monarchy, and all the girls and women in it should\nbe the Queen. They should never come into contact with politics or\neconomics--or any of those things. And we men would work for them and\nserve them in loyal fealty.\"\n\n\"That's rather the theory now,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Only so many men\nneglect their duties.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Manning, with an air of emerging from an elaborate\ndemonstration, \"and so each of us must, under existing conditions, being\nchivalrous indeed to all women, choose for himself his own particular\nand worshipful queen.\"\n\n\"So far as one can judge from the system in practice,\" said Ann\nVeronica, speaking in a loud, common-sense, detached tone, and beginning\nto walk slowly but resolutely toward the lawn, \"it doesn't work.\"\n\n\"Every one must be experimental,\" said Mr. Manning, and glanced round\nhastily for further horticultural points of interest in secluded\ncorners. None presented themselves to save him from that return.\n\n\"That's all very well when one isn't the material experimented upon,\"\nAnn Veronica had remarked.\n\n\"Women would--they DO have far more power than they think, as\ninfluences, as inspirations.\"\n\nAnn Veronica said nothing in answer to that.\n\n\"You say you want a vote,\" said Mr. Manning, abruptly.\n\n\"I think I ought to have one.\"\n\n\"Well, I have two,\" said Mr. Manning--\"one in Oxford University and one\nin Kensington.\" He caught up and went on with a sort of clumsiness: \"Let\nme present you with them and be your voter.\"\n\nThere followed an instant's pause, and then Ann Veronica had decided to\nmisunderstand.\n\n\"I want a vote for myself,\" she said. \"I don't see why I should take it\nsecond-hand. Though it's very kind of you. And rather unscrupulous. Have\nyou ever voted, Mr. Manning? I suppose there's a sort of place like a\nticket-office. And a ballot-box--\" Her face assumed an expression of\nintellectual conflict. \"What is a ballot-box like, exactly?\" she asked,\nas though it was very important to her.\n\nMr. Manning regarded her thoughtfully for a moment and stroked his\nmustache. \"A ballot-box, you know,\" he said, \"is very largely just a\nbox.\" He made quite a long pause, and went on, with a sigh: \"You have a\nvoting paper given you--\"\n\nThey emerged into the publicity of the lawn.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica, \"yes,\" to his explanation, and saw across\nthe lawn Lady Palsworthy talking to her aunt, and both of them staring\nfrankly across at her and Mr. Manning as they talked.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\n\nTHE MORNING OF THE CRISIS\n\nPart 1\n\nTwo days after came the day of the Crisis, the day of the Fadden Dance.\nIt would have been a crisis anyhow, but it was complicated in Ann\nVeronica's mind by the fact that a letter lay on the breakfast-table\nfrom Mr. Manning, and that her aunt focussed a brightly tactful\ndisregard upon this throughout the meal. Ann Veronica had come down\nthinking of nothing in the world but her inflexible resolution to go to\nthe dance in the teeth of all opposition. She did not know Mr. Manning's\nhandwriting, and opened his letter and read some lines before its import\nappeared. Then for a time she forgot the Fadden affair altogether.\nWith a well-simulated unconcern and a heightened color she finished her\nbreakfast.\n\nShe was not obliged to go to the Tredgold College, because as yet the\nCollege had not settled down for the session. She was supposed to be\nreading at home, and after breakfast she strolled into the vegetable\ngarden, and having taken up a position upon the staging of a disused\ngreenhouse that had the double advantage of being hidden from the\nwindows of the house and secure from the sudden appearance of any one,\nshe resumed the reading of Mr. Manning's letter.\n\nMr. Manning's handwriting had an air of being clear without being easily\nlegible; it was large and rather roundish, with a lack of definition\nabout the letters and a disposition to treat the large ones as\nliberal-minded people nowadays treat opinions, as all amounting to the\nsame thing really--a years-smoothed boyish rather than an adult hand.\nAnd it filled seven sheets of notepaper, each written only on one side.\n\n\n\"MY DEAR MISS STANLEY,\" it began,--\"I hope you will forgive my\nbothering you with a letter, but I have been thinking very much over our\nconversation at Lady Palsworthy's, and I feel there are things I want\nto say to you so much that I cannot wait until we meet again. It is the\nworst of talk under such social circumstances that it is always getting\ncut off so soon as it is beginning; and I went home that afternoon\nfeeling I had said nothing--literally nothing--of the things I had meant\nto say to you and that were coursing through my head. They were things I\nhad meant very much to talk to you about, so that I went home vexed and\ndisappointed, and only relieved myself a little by writing a few verses.\nI wonder if you will mind very much when I tell you they were suggested\nby you. You must forgive the poet's license I take. Here is one verse.\nThe metrical irregularity is intentional, because I want, as it were, to\nput you apart: to change the lilt and the mood altogether when I speak\nof you.\n\n     \"'A SONG OF LADIES AND MY LADY\n\n     \"'Saintly white and a lily is Mary,\n     Margaret's violets, sweet and shy;\n     Green and dewy is Nellie-bud fairy,\n     Forget-me-nots live in Gwendolen's eye.\n     Annabel shines like a star in the darkness,\n     Rosamund queens it a rose, deep rose;\n     But the lady I love is like sunshine in April weather,\n     She gleams and gladdens, she warms--and goes.'\n\n\"Crude, I admit. But let that verse tell my secret. All bad\nverse--originally the epigram was Lang's, I believe--is written in a\nstate of emotion.\n\n\"My dear Miss Stanley, when I talked to you the other afternoon of work\nand politics and such-like things, my mind was all the time resenting it\nbeyond measure. There we were discussing whether you should have a vote,\nand I remembered the last occasion we met it was about your prospects of\nsuccess in the medical profession or as a Government official such as a\nnumber of women now are, and all the time my heart was crying out within\nme, 'Here is the Queen of your career.' I wanted, as I have never wanted\nbefore, to take you up, to make you mine, to carry you off and set you\napart from all the strain and turmoil of life. For nothing will ever\nconvince me that it is not the man's share in life to shield, to\nprotect, to lead and toil and watch and battle with the world at large.\nI want to be your knight, your servant, your protector, your--I dare\nscarcely write the word--your husband. So I come suppliant. I am\nfive-and-thirty, and I have knocked about in the world and tasted the\nquality of life. I had a hard fight to begin with to win my way into the\nUpper Division--I was third on a list of forty-seven--and since then I\nhave found myself promoted almost yearly in a widening sphere of social\nservice. Before I met you I never met any one whom I felt I could\nlove, but you have discovered depths in my own nature I had scarcely\nsuspected. Except for a few early ebullitions of passion, natural to\na warm and romantic disposition, and leaving no harmful\nafter-effects--ebullitions that by the standards of the higher truth I\nfeel no one can justly cast a stone at, and of which I for one am by no\nmeans ashamed--I come to you a pure and unencumbered man. I love you.\nIn addition to my public salary I have a certain private property and\nfurther expectations through my aunt, so that I can offer you a life\nof wide and generous refinement, travel, books, discussion, and easy\nrelations with a circle of clever and brilliant and thoughtful people\nwith whom my literary work has brought me into contact, and of which,\nseeing me only as you have done alone in Morningside Park, you can have\nno idea. I have a certain standing not only as a singer but as a critic,\nand I belong to one of the most brilliant causerie dinner clubs of\nthe day, in which successful Bohemianism, politicians, men of affairs,\nartists, sculptors, and cultivated noblemen generally, mingle together\nin the easiest and most delightful intercourse. That is my real milieu,\nand one that I am convinced you would not only adorn but delight in.\n\n\"I find it very hard to write this letter. There are so many things\nI want to tell you, and they stand on such different levels, that\nthe effect is necessarily confusing and discordant, and I find myself\ndoubting if I am really giving you the thread of emotion that should run\nthrough all this letter. For although I must confess it reads very much\nlike an application or a testimonial or some such thing as that, I can\nassure you I am writing this in fear and trembling with a sinking heart.\nMy mind is full of ideas and images that I have been cherishing and\naccumulating--dreams of travelling side by side, of lunching quietly\ntogether in some jolly restaurant, of moonlight and music and all that\nside of life, of seeing you dressed like a queen and shining in some\nbrilliant throng--mine; of your looking at flowers in some old-world\ngarden, our garden--there are splendid places to be got down in Surrey,\nand a little runabout motor is quite within my means. You know they say,\nas, indeed, I have just quoted already, that all bad poetry is written\nin a state of emotion, but I have no doubt that this is true of bad\noffers of marriage. I have often felt before that it is only when one\nhas nothing to say that one can write easy poetry. Witness Browning. And\nhow can I get into one brief letter the complex accumulated desires of\nwhat is now, I find on reference to my diary, nearly sixteen months of\nletting my mind run on you--ever since that jolly party at Surbiton,\nwhere we raced and beat the other boat. You steered and I rowed stroke.\nMy very sentences stumble and give way. But I do not even care if I am\nabsurd. I am a resolute man, and hitherto when I have wanted a thing I\nhave got it; but I have never yet wanted anything in my life as I have\nwanted you. It isn't the same thing. I am afraid because I love you, so\nthat the mere thought of failure hurts. If I did not love you so much I\nbelieve I could win you by sheer force of character, for people tell me\nI am naturally of the dominating type. Most of my successes in life have\nbeen made with a sort of reckless vigor.\n\n\"Well, I have said what I had to say, stumblingly and badly, and baldly.\nBut I am sick of tearing up letters and hopeless of getting what I have\nto say better said. It would be easy enough for me to write an eloquent\nletter about something else. Only I do not care to write about anything\nelse. Let me put the main question to you now that I could not put the\nother afternoon. Will you marry me, Ann Veronica?\n\n\"Very sincerely yours,\n\n\"HUBERT MANNING.\"\n\n\nAnn Veronica read this letter through with grave, attentive eyes.\n\nHer interest grew as she read, a certain distaste disappeared. Twice she\nsmiled, but not unkindly. Then she went back and mixed up the sheets in\na search for particular passages. Finally she fell into reflection.\n\n\"Odd!\" she said. \"I suppose I shall have to write an answer. It's so\ndifferent from what one has been led to expect.\"\n\nShe became aware of her aunt, through the panes of the greenhouse,\nadvancing with an air of serene unconsciousness from among the raspberry\ncanes.\n\n\"No you don't!\" said Ann Veronica, and walked out at a brisk and\nbusiness-like pace toward the house.\n\n\"I'm going for a long tramp, auntie,\" she said.\n\n\"Alone, dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt. I've got a lot of things to think about.\"\n\nMiss Stanley reflected as Ann Veronica went toward the house. She\nthought her niece very hard and very self-possessed and self-confident.\nShe ought to be softened and tender and confidential at this phase of\nher life. She seemed to have no idea whatever of the emotional states\nthat were becoming to her age and position. Miss Stanley walked round\nthe garden thinking, and presently house and garden reverberated to Ann\nVeronica's slamming of the front door.\n\n\"I wonder!\" said Miss Stanley.\n\nFor a long time she surveyed a row of towering holly-hocks, as though\nthey offered an explanation. Then she went in and up-stairs, hesitated\non the landing, and finally, a little breathless and with an air of\ngreat dignity, opened the door and walked into Ann Veronica's room. It\nwas a neat, efficient-looking room, with a writing-table placed with a\nbusiness-like regard to the window, and a bookcase surmounted by a\npig's skull, a dissected frog in a sealed bottle, and a pile of\nshiny, black-covered note-books. In the corner of the room were two\nhockey-sticks and a tennis-racket, and upon the walls Ann Veronica,\nby means of autotypes, had indicated her proclivities in art. But Miss\nStanley took no notice of these things. She walked straight across to\nthe wardrobe and opened it. There, hanging among Ann Veronica's more\nnormal clothing, was a skimpy dress of red canvas, trimmed with cheap\nand tawdry braid, and short--it could hardly reach below the knee. On\nthe same peg and evidently belonging to it was a black velvet Zouave\njacket. And then! a garment that was conceivably a secondary skirt.\n\nMiss Stanley hesitated, and took first one and then another of the\nconstituents of this costume off its peg and surveyed it.\n\nThe third item she took with a trembling hand by its waistbelt. As she\nraised it, its lower portion fell apart into two baggy crimson masses.\n\n\"TROUSERS!\" she whispered.\n\nHer eyes travelled about the room as if in appeal to the very chairs.\n\nTucked under the writing-table a pair of yellow and gold Turkish\nslippers of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye. She walked\nover to them still carrying the trousers in her hands, and stooped to\nexamine them. They were ingenious disguises of gilt paper destructively\ngummed, it would seem, to Ann Veronicas' best dancing-slippers.\n\nThen she reverted to the trousers.\n\n\"How CAN I tell him?\" whispered Miss Stanley.\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nAnn Veronica carried a light but business-like walking-stick. She walked\nwith an easy quickness down the Avenue and through the proletarian\nportion of Morningside Park, and crossing these fields came into a\npretty overhung lane that led toward Caddington and the Downs. And\nthen her pace slackened. She tucked her stick under her arm and re-read\nManning's letter.\n\n\"Let me think,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I wish this hadn't turned up to-day\nof all days.\"\n\nShe found it difficult to begin thinking, and indeed she was anything\nbut clear what it was she had to think about. Practically it was most\nof the chief interests in life that she proposed to settle in this\npedestrian meditation. Primarily it was her own problem, and in\nparticular the answer she had to give to Mr. Manning's letter, but in\norder to get data for that she found that she, having a logical and\nordered mind, had to decide upon the general relations of men to women,\nthe objects and conditions of marriage and its bearing upon the\nwelfare of the race, the purpose of the race, the purpose, if any, of\neverything....\n\n\"Frightful lot of things aren't settled,\" said Ann Veronica. In\naddition, the Fadden Dance business, all out of proportion, occupied\nthe whole foreground of her thoughts and threw a color of rebellion\nover everything. She kept thinking she was thinking about Mr. Manning's\nproposal of marriage and finding she was thinking of the dance.\n\nFor a time her efforts to achieve a comprehensive concentration were\ndispersed by the passage of the village street of Caddington, the\npassing of a goggled car-load of motorists, and the struggles of a\nstable lad mounted on one recalcitrant horse and leading another. When\nshe got back to her questions again in the monotonous high-road that led\nup the hill, she found the image of Mr. Manning central in her mind.\nHe stood there, large and dark, enunciating, in his clear voice from\nbeneath his large mustache, clear flat sentences, deliberately kindly.\nHe proposed, he wanted to possess her! He loved her.\n\nAnn Veronica felt no repulsion at the prospect. That Mr. Manning loved\nher presented itself to her bloodlessly, stilled from any imaginative\nquiver or thrill of passion or disgust. The relationship seemed to have\nalmost as much to do with blood and body as a mortgage. It was something\nthat would create a mutual claim, a relationship. It was in another\nworld from that in which men will die for a kiss, and touching hands\nlights fires that burn up lives--the world of romance, the world of\npassionately beautiful things.\n\nBut that other world, in spite of her resolute exclusion of it, was\nalways looking round corners and peeping through chinks and crannies,\nand rustling and raiding into the order in which she chose to live,\nshining out of pictures at her, echoing in lyrics and music; it invaded\nher dreams, it wrote up broken and enigmatical sentences upon the\npassage walls of her mind. She was aware of it now as if it were a\nvoice shouting outside a house, shouting passionate verities in a hot\nsunlight, a voice that cries while people talk insincerely in a darkened\nroom and pretend not to hear. Its shouting now did in some occult manner\nconvey a protest that Mr. Manning would on no account do, though he\nwas tall and dark and handsome and kind, and thirty-five and adequately\nprosperous, and all that a husband should be. But there was, it\ninsisted, no mobility in his face, no movement, nothing about him that\nwarmed. If Ann Veronica could have put words to that song they\nwould have been, \"Hot-blooded marriage or none!\" but she was far too\nindistinct in this matter to frame any words at all.\n\n\"I don't love him,\" said Ann Veronica, getting a gleam. \"I don't see\nthat his being a good sort matters. That really settles about that....\nBut it means no end of a row.\"\n\nFor a time she sat on a rail before leaving the road for the downland\nturf. \"But I wish,\" she said, \"I had some idea what I was really up to.\"\n\nHer thoughts went into solution for a time, while she listened to a lark\nsinging.\n\n\"Marriage and mothering,\" said Ann Veronica, with her mind crystallizing\nout again as the lark dropped to the nest in the turf. \"And all the rest\nof it perhaps is a song.\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nHer mind got back to the Fadden Ball.\n\nShe meant to go, she meant to go, she meant to go. Nothing would stop\nher, and she was prepared to face the consequences. Suppose her father\nturned her out of doors! She did not care, she meant to go. She would\njust walk out of the house and go....\n\nShe thought of her costume in some detail and with considerable\nsatisfaction, and particularly of a very jolly property dagger with\nlarge glass jewels in the handle, that reposed in a drawer in her room.\nShe was to be a Corsair's Bride. \"Fancy stabbing a man for jealousy!\"\nshe thought. \"You'd have to think how to get in between his bones.\"\n\nShe thought of her father, and with an effort dismissed him from her\nmind.\n\nShe tried to imagine the collective effect of the Fadden Ball; she had\nnever seen a fancy-dress gathering in her life. Mr. Manning came into\nher thoughts again, an unexpected, tall, dark, self-contained presence\nat the Fadden. One might suppose him turning up; he knew a lot of clever\npeople, and some of them might belong to the class. What would he come\nas?\n\nPresently she roused herself with a guilty start from the task of\ndressing and re-dressing Mr. Manning in fancy costume, as though he\nwas a doll. She had tried him as a Crusader, in which guise he seemed\nplausible but heavy--\"There IS something heavy about him; I wonder if\nit's his mustache?\"--and as a Hussar, which made him preposterous, and\nas a Black Brunswicker, which was better, and as an Arab sheik. Also\nshe had tried him as a dragoman and as a gendarme, which seemed the most\nsuitable of all to his severely handsome, immobile profile. She felt\nhe would tell people the way, control traffic, and refuse admission\nto public buildings with invincible correctness and the very finest\nexplicit feelings possible. For each costume she had devised a suitable\nform of matrimonial refusal. \"Oh, Lord!\" she said, discovering what she\nwas up to, and dropped lightly from the fence upon the turf and went on\nher way toward the crest.\n\n\"I shall never marry,\" said Ann Veronica, resolutely; \"I'm not the sort.\nThat's why it's so important I should take my own line now.\"\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nAnn Veronica's ideas of marriage were limited and unsystematic. Her\nteachers and mistresses had done their best to stamp her mind with an\nineradicable persuasion that it was tremendously important, and on no\naccount to be thought about. Her first intimations of marriage as a fact\nof extreme significance in a woman's life had come with the marriage of\nAlice and the elopement of her second sister, Gwen.\n\nThese convulsions occurred when Ann Veronica was about twelve. There\nwas a gulf of eight years between her and the youngest of her brace of\nsisters--an impassable gulf inhabited chaotically by two noisy brothers.\nThese sisters moved in a grown-up world inaccessible to Ann Veronica's\nsympathies, and to a large extent remote from her curiosity. She got\ninto rows through meddling with their shoes and tennis-rackets, and had\nmoments of carefully concealed admiration when she was privileged to see\nthem just before her bedtime, rather radiantly dressed in white or pink\nor amber and prepared to go out with her mother. She thought Alice a bit\nof a sneak, an opinion her brothers shared, and Gwen rather a snatch\nat meals. She saw nothing of their love-making, and came home from her\nboarding-school in a state of decently suppressed curiosity for Alice's\nwedding.\n\nHer impressions of this cardinal ceremony were rich and confused,\ncomplicated by a quite transitory passion that awakened no reciprocal\nfire for a fat curly headed cousin in black velveteen and a lace\ncollar, who assisted as a page. She followed him about persistently, and\nsucceeded, after a brisk, unchivalrous struggle (in which he pinched and\nasked her to \"cheese it\"), in kissing him among the raspberries behind\nthe greenhouse. Afterward her brother Roddy, also strange in velveteen,\nfeeling rather than knowing of this relationship, punched this Adonis's\nhead.\n\nA marriage in the house proved to be exciting but extremely\ndisorganizing. Everything seemed designed to unhinge the mind and\nmake the cat wretched. All the furniture was moved, all the meals were\ndisarranged, and everybody, Ann Veronica included, appeared in new,\nbright costumes. She had to wear cream and a brown sash and a short\nfrock and her hair down, and Gwen cream and a brown sash and a long\nskirt and her hair up. And her mother, looking unusually alert and\nhectic, wore cream and brown also, made up in a more complicated manner.\n\nAnn Veronica was much impressed by a mighty trying on and altering and\nfussing about Alice's \"things\"--Alice was being re-costumed from garret\nto cellar, with a walking-dress and walking-boots to measure, and a\nbride's costume of the most ravishing description, and stockings and\nsuch like beyond the dreams of avarice--and a constant and increasing\ndripping into the house of irrelevant remarkable objects, such as--\n\nReal lace bedspread;\n\nGilt travelling clock;\n\nOrnamental pewter plaque;\n\nSalad bowl (silver mounted) and servers;\n\nMadgett's \"English Poets\" (twelve volumes), bound purple morocco;\n\nEtc., etc.\n\nThrough all this flutter of novelty there came and went a solicitous,\npreoccupied, almost depressed figure. It was Doctor Ralph, formerly\nthe partner of Doctor Stickell in the Avenue, and now with a thriving\npractice of his own in Wamblesmith. He had shaved his side-whiskers and\ncome over in flannels, but he was still indisputably the same person\nwho had attended Ann Veronica for the measles and when she swallowed\nthe fish-bone. But his role was altered, and he was now playing the\nbridegroom in this remarkable drama. Alice was going to be Mrs. Ralph.\nHe came in apologetically; all the old \"Well, and how ARE we?\" note\ngone; and once he asked Ann Veronica, almost furtively,\n\n\"How's Alice getting on, Vee?\" Finally, on the Day, he appeared like\nhis old professional self transfigured, in the most beautiful light gray\ntrousers Ann Veronica had ever seen and a new shiny silk hat with a most\nbecoming roll....\n\nIt was not simply that all the rooms were rearranged and everybody\ndressed in unusual fashions, and all the routines of life abolished and\nput away: people's tempers and emotions also seemed strangely disturbed\nand shifted about. Her father was distinctly irascible, and disposed\nmore than ever to hide away among the petrological things--the study was\nturned out. At table he carved in a gloomy but resolute manner. On the\nDay he had trumpet-like outbreaks of cordiality, varied by a watchful\npreoccupation. Gwen and Alice were fantastically friendly, which seemed\nto annoy him, and Mrs. Stanley was throughout enigmatical, with an\nanxious eye on her husband and Alice.\n\nThere was a confused impression of livery carriages and whips with white\nfavors, people fussily wanting other people to get in before them,\nand then the church. People sat in unusual pews, and a wide margin of\nhassocky emptiness intervened between the ceremony and the walls.\n\nAnn Veronica had a number of fragmentary impressions of Alice strangely\ntransfigured in bridal raiment. It seemed to make her sister downcast\nbeyond any precedent. The bridesmaids and pages got rather jumbled\nin the aisle, and she had an effect of Alice's white back and\nsloping shoulders and veiled head receding toward the altar. In some\nincomprehensible way that back view made her feel sorry for Alice. Also\nshe remembered very vividly the smell of orange blossom, and Alice,\ndrooping and spiritless, mumbling responses, facing Doctor Ralph, while\nthe Rev. Edward Bribble stood between them with an open book. Doctor\nRalph looked kind and large, and listened to Alice's responses as though\nhe was listening to symptoms and thought that on the whole she was\nprogressing favorably.\n\nAnd afterward her mother and Alice kissed long and clung to each other.\nAnd Doctor Ralph stood by looking considerate. He and her father shook\nhands manfully.\n\nAnn Veronica had got quite interested in Mr. Bribble's rendering of the\nservice--he had the sort of voice that brings out things--and was still\nteeming with ideas about it when finally a wild outburst from the organ\nmade it clear that, whatever snivelling there might be down in the\nchancel, that excellent wind instrument was, in its Mendelssohnian\nway, as glad as ever it could be. \"Pump, pump, per-um-pump, Pum, Pump,\nPer-um....\"\n\nThe wedding-breakfast was for Ann Veronica a spectacle of the unreal\nconsuming the real; she liked that part very well, until she was\ncarelessly served against her expressed wishes with mayonnaise. She\nwas caught by an uncle, whose opinion she valued, making faces at Roddy\nbecause he had exulted at this.\n\nOf the vast mass of these impressions Ann Veronica could make nothing\nat the time; there they were--Fact! She stored them away in a mind\nnaturally retentive, as a squirrel stores away nuts, for further\ndigestion. Only one thing emerged with any reasonable clarity in her\nmind at once, and that was that unless she was saved from drowning by\nan unmarried man, in which case the ceremony is unavoidable, or totally\ndestitute of under-clothing, and so driven to get a trousseau, in which\nhardship a trousseau would certainly be \"ripping,\" marriage was an\nexperience to be strenuously evaded.\n\nWhen they were going home she asked her mother why she and Gwen and\nAlice had cried.\n\n\"Ssh!\" said her mother, and then added, \"A little natural feeling,\ndear.\"\n\n\"But didn't Alice want to marry Doctor Ralph?\"\n\n\"Oh, ssh, Vee!\" said her mother, with an evasion as patent as an\nadvertisement board. \"I am sure she will be very happy indeed with\nDoctor Ralph.\"\n\nBut Ann Veronica was by no means sure of that until she went over\nto Wamblesmith and saw her sister, very remote and domestic and\nauthoritative, in a becoming tea-gown, in command of Doctor Ralph's\nhome. Doctor Ralph came in to tea and put his arm round Alice and kissed\nher, and Alice called him \"Squiggles,\" and stood in the shelter of his\narms for a moment with an expression of satisfied proprietorship. She\nHAD cried, Ann Veronica knew. There had been fusses and scenes dimly\napprehended through half-open doors. She had heard Alice talking and\ncrying at the same time, a painful noise. Perhaps marriage hurt. But now\nit was all over, and Alice was getting on well. It reminded Ann Veronica\nof having a tooth stopped.\n\nAnd after that Alice became remoter than ever, and, after a time, ill.\nThen she had a baby and became as old as any really grown-up person, or\nolder, and very dull. Then she and her husband went off to a Yorkshire\npractice, and had four more babies, none of whom photographed well, and\nso she passed beyond the sphere of Ann Veronica's sympathies altogether.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nThe Gwen affair happened when she was away at school at\nMarticombe-on-Sea, a term before she went to the High School, and was\nnever very clear to her.\n\nHer mother missed writing for a week, and then she wrote in an unusual\nkey. \"My dear,\" the letter ran, \"I have to tell you that your sister\nGwen has offended your father very much. I hope you will always love\nher, but I want you to remember she has offended your father and married\nwithout his consent. Your father is very angry, and will not have her\nname mentioned in his hearing. She has married some one he could not\napprove of, and gone right away....\"\n\nWhen the next holidays came Ann Veronica's mother was ill, and Gwen was\nin the sick-room when Ann Veronica returned home. She was in one of her\nold walking-dresses, her hair was done in an unfamiliar manner, she wore\na wedding-ring, and she looked as if she had been crying.\n\n\"Hello, Gwen!\" said Ann Veronica, trying to put every one at their ease.\n\"Been and married?... What's the name of the happy man?\"\n\nGwen owned to \"Fortescue.\"\n\n\"Got a photograph of him or anything?\" said Ann Veronica, after kissing\nher mother.\n\nGwen made an inquiry, and, directed by Mrs. Stanley, produced a portrait\nfrom its hiding-place in the jewel-drawer under the mirror. It presented\na clean-shaven face with a large Corinthian nose, hair tremendously\nwaving off the forehead and more chin and neck than is good for a man.\n\n\"LOOKS all right,\" said Ann Veronica, regarding him with her head first\non one side and then on the other, and trying to be agreeable. \"What's\nthe objection?\"\n\n\"I suppose she ought to know?\" said Gwen to her mother, trying to alter\nthe key of the conversation.\n\n\"You see, Vee,\" said Mrs. Stanley, \"Mr. Fortescue is an actor, and your\nfather does not approve of the profession.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ann Veronica. \"I thought they made knights of actors?\"\n\n\"They may of Hal some day,\" said Gwen. \"But it's a long business.\"\n\n\"I suppose this makes you an actress?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I don't know whether I shall go on,\" said Gwen, a novel note of\nlanguorous professionalism creeping into her voice. \"The other women\ndon't much like it if husband and wife work together, and I don't think\nHal would like me to act away from him.\"\n\nAnn Veronica regarded her sister with a new respect, but the traditions\nof family life are strong. \"I don't suppose you'll be able to do it\nmuch,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nLater Gwen's trouble weighed so heavily on Mrs. Stanley in her illness\nthat her husband consented to receive Mr. Fortescue in the drawing-room,\nand actually shake hands with him in an entirely hopeless manner and\nhope everything would turn out for the best.\n\nThe forgiveness and reconciliation was a cold and formal affair, and\nafterwards her father went off gloomily to his study, and Mr. Fortescue\nrambled round the garden with soft, propitiatory steps, the Corinthian\nnose upraised and his hands behind his back, pausing to look long and\nhard at the fruit-trees against the wall.\n\nAnn Veronica watched him from the dining-room window, and after some\nmoments of maidenly hesitation rambled out into the garden in a reverse\ndirection to Mr. Fortescue's steps, and encountered him with an air of\nartless surprise.\n\n\"Hello!\" said Ann Veronica, with arms akimbo and a careless, breathless\nmanner. \"You Mr. Fortescue?\"\n\n\"At your service. You Ann Veronica?\"\n\n\"Rather! I say--did you marry Gwen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nMr. Fortescue raised his eyebrows and assumed a light-comedy expression.\n\"I suppose I fell in love with her, Ann Veronica.\"\n\n\"Rum,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Have you got to keep her now?\"\n\n\"To the best of my ability,\" said Mr. Fortescue, with a bow.\n\n\"Have you much ability?\" asked Ann Veronica.\n\nMr. Fortescue tried to act embarrassment in order to conceal its\nreality, and Ann Veronica went on to ask a string of questions about\nacting, and whether her sister would act, and was she beautiful enough\nfor it, and who would make her dresses, and so on.\n\nAs a matter of fact Mr. Fortescue had not much ability to keep her\nsister, and a little while after her mother's death Ann Veronica\nmet Gwen suddenly on the staircase coming from her father's study,\nshockingly dingy in dusty mourning and tearful and resentful, and after\nthat Gwen receded from the Morningside Park world, and not even the\nbegging letters and distressful communications that her father and aunt\nreceived, but only a vague intimation of dreadfulness, a leakage of\nincidental comment, flashes of paternal anger at \"that blackguard,\" came\nto Ann Veronica's ears.\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nThese were Ann Veronica's leading cases in the question of marriage.\nThey were the only real marriages she had seen clearly. For the rest,\nshe derived her ideas of the married state from the observed behavior of\nmarried women, which impressed her in Morningside Park as being tied and\ndull and inelastic in comparison with the life of the young, and from a\nremarkably various reading among books. As a net result she had come to\nthink of all married people much as one thinks of insects that have\nlost their wings, and of her sisters as new hatched creatures who had\nscarcely for a moment had wings. She evolved a dim image of herself\ncooped up in a house under the benevolent shadow of Mr. Manning.\nWho knows?--on the analogy of \"Squiggles\" she might come to call him\n\"Mangles!\"\n\n\"I don't think I can ever marry any one,\" she said, and fell suddenly\ninto another set of considerations that perplexed her for a time. Had\nromance to be banished from life?...\n\nIt was hard to part with romance, but she had never thirsted so keenly\nto go on with her University work in her life as she did that day. She\nhad never felt so acutely the desire for free initiative, for a life\nunhampered by others. At any cost! Her brothers had it practically--at\nleast they had it far more than it seemed likely she would unless she\nexerted herself with quite exceptional vigor. Between her and the fair,\nfar prospect of freedom and self-development manoeuvred Mr. Manning, her\naunt and father, neighbors, customs, traditions, forces. They seemed to\nher that morning to be all armed with nets and prepared to throw them\nover her directly her movements became in any manner truly free.\n\nShe had a feeling as though something had dropped from her eyes, as\nthough she had just discovered herself for the first time--discovered\nherself as a sleep-walker might do, abruptly among dangers, hindrances,\nand perplexities, on the verge of a cardinal crisis.\n\nThe life of a girl presented itself to her as something happy and\nheedless and unthinking, yet really guided and controlled by others, and\ngoing on amidst unsuspected screens and concealments.\n\nAnd in its way it was very well. Then suddenly with a rush came reality,\ncame \"growing up\"; a hasty imperative appeal for seriousness, for\nsupreme seriousness. The Ralphs and Mannings and Fortescues came down\nupon the raw inexperience, upon the blinking ignorance of the newcomer;\nand before her eyes were fairly open, before she knew what had\nhappened, a new set of guides and controls, a new set of obligations and\nresponsibilities and limitations, had replaced the old. \"I want to be\na Person,\" said Ann Veronica to the downs and the open sky; \"I will not\nhave this happen to me, whatever else may happen in its place.\"\n\nAnn Veronica had three things very definitely settled by the time when,\na little after mid-day, she found herself perched up on a gate between a\nbridle-path and a field that commanded the whole wide stretch of country\nbetween Chalking and Waldersham. Firstly, she did not intend to marry at\nall, and particularly she did not mean to marry Mr. Manning; secondly,\nby some measure or other, she meant to go on with her studies, not at\nthe Tredgold Schools but at the Imperial College; and, thirdly, she was,\nas an immediate and decisive act, a symbol of just exactly where she\nstood, a declaration of free and adult initiative, going that night to\nthe Fadden Ball.\n\nBut the possible attitude of her father she had still to face. So far\nshe had the utmost difficulty in getting on to that vitally important\nmatter. The whole of that relationship persisted in remaining obscure.\nWhat would happen when next morning she returned to Morningside Park?\n\nHe couldn't turn her out of doors. But what he could do or might do she\ncould not imagine. She was not afraid of violence, but she was afraid of\nsomething mean, some secondary kind of force. Suppose he stopped all her\nallowance, made it imperative that she should either stay ineffectually\nresentful at home or earn a living for herself at once.... It\nappeared highly probable to her that he would stop her allowance.\n\nWhat can a girl do?\n\nSomewhere at this point Ann Veronica's speculations were interrupted\nand turned aside by the approach of a horse and rider. Mr. Ramage, that\niron-gray man of the world, appeared dressed in a bowler hat and a suit\nof hard gray, astride of a black horse. He pulled rein at the sight of\nher, saluted, and regarded her with his rather too protuberant eyes. The\ngirl's gaze met his in interested inquiry.\n\n\"You've got my view,\" he said, after a pensive second. \"I always get off\nhere and lean over that rail for a bit. May I do so to-day?\"\n\n\"It's your gate,\" she said, amiably; \"you got it first. It's for you to\nsay if I may sit on it.\"\n\nHe slipped off the horse. \"Let me introduce you to Caesar,\" he said;\nand she patted Caesar's neck, and remarked how soft his nose was, and\nsecretly deplored the ugliness of equine teeth. Ramage tethered the\nhorse to the farther gate-post, and Caesar blew heavily and began to\ninvestigate the hedge.\n\nRamage leaned over the gate at Ann Veronica's side, and for a moment\nthere was silence.\n\nHe made some obvious comments on the wide view warming toward its\nautumnal blaze that spread itself in hill and valley, wood and village,\nbelow.\n\n\"It's as broad as life,\" said Mr. Ramage, regarding it and putting a\nwell-booted foot up on the bottom rail.\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\n\"And what are you doing here, young lady,\" he said, looking up at her\nface, \"wandering alone so far from home?\"\n\n\"I like long walks,\" said Ann Veronica, looking down on him.\n\n\"Solitary walks?\"\n\n\"That's the point of them. I think over all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"Problems?\"\n\n\"Sometimes quite difficult problems.\"\n\n\"You're lucky to live in an age when you can do so. Your mother,\nfor instance, couldn't. She had to do her thinking at home--under\ninspection.\"\n\nShe looked down on him thoughtfully, and he let his admiration of her\nfree young poise show in his face.\n\n\"I suppose things have changed?\" she said.\n\n\"Never was such an age of transition.\"\n\nShe wondered what to. Mr. Ramage did not know. \"Sufficient unto me is\nthe change thereof,\" he said, with all the effect of an epigram.\n\n\"I must confess,\" he said, \"the New Woman and the New Girl intrigue me\nprofoundly. I am one of those people who are interested in women, more\ninterested than I am in anything else. I don't conceal it. And the\nchange, the change of attitude! The way all the old clingingness\nhas been thrown aside is amazing. And all the old--the old trick of\nshrinking up like a snail at a touch. If you had lived twenty years ago\nyou would have been called a Young Person, and it would have been your\nchief duty in life not to know, never to have heard of, and never to\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"There's quite enough still,\" said Ann Veronica, smiling, \"that one\ndoesn't understand.\"\n\n\"Quite. But your role would have been to go about saying, 'I beg your\npardon' in a reproving tone to things you understood quite well in your\nheart and saw no harm in. That terrible Young Person! she's vanished.\nLost, stolen, or strayed, the Young Person!... I hope we may never\nfind her again.\"\n\nHe rejoiced over this emancipation. \"While that lamb was about every man\nof any spirit was regarded as a dangerous wolf. We wore invisible chains\nand invisible blinkers. Now, you and I can gossip at a gate, and Honi\nsoit qui mal y pense. The change has given man one good thing he never\nhad before,\" he said. \"Girl friends. And I am coming to believe the best\nas well as the most beautiful friends a man can have are girl friends.\"\n\nHe paused, and went on, after a keen look at her:\n\n\"I had rather gossip to a really intelligent girl than to any man\nalive.\"\n\n\"I suppose we ARE more free than we were?\" said Ann Veronica, keeping\nthe question general.\n\n\"Oh, there's no doubt of it! Since the girls of the eighties broke\nbounds and sailed away on bicycles--my young days go back to the very\nbeginnings of that--it's been one triumphant relaxation.\"\n\n\"Relaxation, perhaps. But are we any more free?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I mean we've long strings to tether us, but we are bound all the same.\nA woman isn't much freer--in reality.\"\n\nMr. Ramage demurred.\n\n\"One runs about,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But it's on condition one doesn't do anything.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Oh!--anything.\"\n\nHe looked interrogation with a faint smile.\n\n\"It seems to me it comes to earning one's living in the long run,\" said\nAnn Veronica, coloring faintly. \"Until a girl can go away as a son does\nand earn her independent income, she's still on a string. It may be a\nlong string, long enough if you like to tangle up all sorts of people;\nbut there it is! If the paymaster pulls, home she must go. That's what I\nmean.\"\n\nMr. Ramage admitted the force of that. He was a little impressed by\nAnn Veronica's metaphor of the string, which, indeed, she owed to Hetty\nWidgett. \"YOU wouldn't like to be independent?\" he asked, abruptly. \"I\nmean REALLY independent. On your own. It isn't such fun as it seems.\"\n\n\"Every one wants to be independent,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Every one. Man\nor woman.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Rather!\"\n\n\"I wonder why?\"\n\n\"There's no why. It's just to feel--one owns one's self.\"\n\n\"Nobody does that,\" said Ramage, and kept silence for a moment.\n\n\"But a boy--a boy goes out into the world and presently stands on his\nown feet. He buys his own clothes, chooses his own company, makes his\nown way of living.\"\n\n\"You'd like to do that?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Would you like to be a boy?\"\n\n\"I wonder! It's out of the question, any way.\"\n\nRamage reflected. \"Why don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, it might mean rather a row.\"\n\n\"I know--\" said Ramage, with sympathy.\n\n\"And besides,\" said Ann Veronica, sweeping that aspect aside, \"what\ncould I do? A boy sails out into a trade or profession. But--it's one\nof the things I've just been thinking over. Suppose--suppose a girl\ndid want to start in life, start in life for herself--\" She looked him\nfrankly in the eyes. \"What ought she to do?\"\n\n\"Suppose you--\"\n\n\"Yes, suppose I--\"\n\nHe felt that his advice was being asked. He became a little more\npersonal and intimate. \"I wonder what you could do?\" he said. \"I should\nthink YOU could do all sorts of things....\n\n\"What ought you to do?\" He began to produce his knowledge of the world\nfor her benefit, jerkily and allusively, and with a strong, rank flavor\nof \"savoir faire.\" He took an optimist view of her chances. Ann Veronica\nlistened thoughtfully, with her eyes on the turf, and now and then she\nasked a question or looked up to discuss a point. In the meanwhile,\nas he talked, he scrutinized her face, ran his eyes over her careless,\ngracious poise, wondered hard about her. He described her privately to\nhimself as a splendid girl. It was clear she wanted to get away from\nhome, that she was impatient to get away from home. Why? While the front\nof his mind was busy warning her not to fall into the hopeless miseries\nof underpaid teaching, and explaining his idea that for women of\ninitiative, quite as much as for men, the world of business had by far\nthe best chances, the back chambers of his brain were busy with the\nproblem of that \"Why?\"\n\nHis first idea as a man of the world was to explain her unrest by a\nlover, some secret or forbidden or impossible lover. But he dismissed\nthat because then she would ask her lover and not him all these things.\nRestlessness, then, was the trouble, simple restlessness: home bored\nher. He could quite understand the daughter of Mr. Stanley being bored\nand feeling limited. But was that enough? Dim, formless suspicions\nof something more vital wandered about his mind. Was the young lady\nimpatient for experience? Was she adventurous? As a man of the world he\ndid not think it becoming to accept maidenly calm as anything more than\na mask. Warm life was behind that always, even if it slept. If it\nwas not an actual personal lover, it still might be the lover not yet\nincarnate, not yet perhaps suspected....\n\nHe had diverged only a little from the truth when he said that his\nchief interest in life was women. It wasn't so much women as Woman that\nengaged his mind. His was the Latin turn of thinking; he had fallen\nin love at thirteen, and he was still capable--he prided himself--of\nfalling in love. His invalid wife and her money had been only the thin\nthread that held his life together; beaded on that permanent relation\nhad been an inter-weaving series of other feminine experiences,\ndisturbing, absorbing, interesting, memorable affairs. Each one had\nbeen different from the others, each had had a quality all its own, a\ndistinctive freshness, a distinctive beauty. He could not understand how\nmen could live ignoring this one predominant interest, this wonderful\nresearch into personality and the possibilities of pleasing, these\ncomplex, fascinating expeditions that began in interest and mounted to\nthe supremest, most passionate intimacy. All the rest of his existence\nwas subordinate to this pursuit; he lived for it, worked for it, kept\nhimself in training for it.\n\nSo while he talked to this girl of work and freedom, his slightly\nprotuberant eyes were noting the gracious balance of her limbs and body\nacross the gate, the fine lines of her chin and neck. Her grave fine\nface, her warm clear complexion, had already aroused his curiosity as he\nhad gone to and fro in Morningside Park, and here suddenly he was\nnear to her and talking freely and intimately. He had found her in\na communicative mood, and he used the accumulated skill of years in\nturning that to account.\n\nShe was pleased and a little flattered by his interest and sympathy. She\nbecame eager to explain herself, to show herself in the right light. He\nwas manifestly exerting his mind for her, and she found herself fully\ndisposed to justify his interest.\n\nShe, perhaps, displayed herself rather consciously as a fine\nperson unduly limited. She even touched lightly on her father's\nunreasonableness.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Ramage, \"that more girls don't think as you do and want\nto strike out in the world.\"\n\nAnd then he speculated. \"I wonder if you will?\"\n\n\"Let me say one thing,\" he said. \"If ever you do and I can help you\nin any way, by advice or inquiry or recommendation--You see, I'm no\nbeliever in feminine incapacity, but I do perceive there is such a thing\nas feminine inexperience. As a sex you're a little under-trained--in\naffairs. I'd take it--forgive me if I seem a little urgent--as a sort of\nproof of friendliness. I can imagine nothing more pleasant in life than\nto help you, because I know it would pay to help you. There's something\nabout you, a little flavor of Will, I suppose, that makes one feel--good\nluck about you and success....\"\n\nAnd while he talked and watched her as he talked, she answered, and\nbehind her listening watched and thought about him. She liked the\nanimated eagerness of his manner.\n\nHis mind seemed to be a remarkably full one; his knowledge of detailed\nreality came in just where her own mind was most weakly equipped.\nThrough all he said ran one quality that pleased her--the quality of a\nman who feels that things can be done, that one need not wait for the\nworld to push one before one moved. Compared with her father and Mr.\nManning and the men in \"fixed\" positions generally that she knew,\nRamage, presented by himself, had a fine suggestion of freedom, of\npower, of deliberate and sustained adventure....\n\nShe was particularly charmed by his theory of friendship. It was really\nvery jolly to talk to a man in this way--who saw the woman in her and\ndid not treat her as a child. She was inclined to think that perhaps\nfor a girl the converse of his method was the case; an older man, a\nman beyond the range of anything \"nonsensical,\" was, perhaps, the most\ninteresting sort of friend one could meet. But in that reservation it\nmay be she went a little beyond the converse of his view....\n\nThey got on wonderfully well together. They talked for the better part\nof an hour, and at last walked together to the junction of highroad\nand the bridle-path. There, after protestations of friendliness and\nhelpfulness that were almost ardent, he mounted a little clumsily and\nrode off at an amiable pace, looking his best, making a leg with\nhis riding gaiters, smiling and saluting, while Ann Veronica turned\nnorthward and so came to Micklechesil. There, in a little tea and\nsweet-stuff shop, she bought and consumed slowly and absent-mindedly the\ninsufficient nourishment that is natural to her sex on such occasions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\n\nTHE CRISIS\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nWe left Miss Stanley with Ann Veronica's fancy dress in her hands and\nher eyes directed to Ann Veronica's pseudo-Turkish slippers.\n\nWhen Mr. Stanley came home at a quarter to six--an earlier train by\nfifteen minutes than he affected--his sister met him in the hall with\na hushed expression. \"I'm so glad you're here, Peter,\" she said. \"She\nmeans to go.\"\n\n\"Go!\" he said. \"Where?\"\n\n\"To that ball.\"\n\n\"What ball?\" The question was rhetorical. He knew.\n\n\"I believe she's dressing up-stairs--now.\"\n\n\"Then tell her to undress, confound her!\" The City had been thoroughly\nannoying that day, and he was angry from the outset.\n\nMiss Stanley reflected on this proposal for a moment.\n\n\"I don't think she will,\" she said.\n\n\"She must,\" said Mr. Stanley, and went into his study. His sister\nfollowed. \"She can't go now. She'll have to wait for dinner,\" he said,\nuncomfortably.\n\n\"She's going to have some sort of meal with the Widgetts down the\nAvenue, and go up with them.\n\n\"She told you that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"At tea.\"\n\n\"But why didn't you prohibit once for all the whole thing? How dared she\ntell you that?\"\n\n\"Out of defiance. She just sat and told me that was her arrangement.\nI've never seen her quite so sure of herself.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said, 'My dear Veronica! how can you think of such things?'\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"She had two more cups of tea and some cake, and told me of her walk.\"\n\n\"She'll meet somebody one of these days--walking about like that.\"\n\n\"She didn't say she'd met any one.\"\n\n\"But didn't you say some more about that ball?\"\n\n\"I said everything I could say as soon as I realized she was trying to\navoid the topic. I said, 'It is no use your telling me about this walk\nand pretend I've been told about the ball, because you haven't. Your\nfather has forbidden you to go!'\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"She said, 'I hate being horrid to you and father, but I feel it my duty\nto go to that ball!'\"\n\n\"Felt it her duty!\"\n\n\"'Very well,' I said, 'then I wash my hands of the whole business. Your\ndisobedience be upon your own head.'\"\n\n\"But that is flat rebellion!\" said Mr. Stanley, standing on the\nhearthrug with his back to the unlit gas-fire. \"You ought at once--you\nought at once to have told her that. What duty does a girl owe to any\none before her father? Obedience to him, that is surely the first law.\nWhat CAN she put before that?\" His voice began to rise. \"One would think\nI had said nothing about the matter. One would think I had agreed to\nher going. I suppose this is what she learns in her infernal London\ncolleges. I suppose this is the sort of damned rubbish--\"\n\n\"Oh! Ssh, Peter!\" cried Miss Stanley.\n\nHe stopped abruptly. In the pause a door could be heard opening and\nclosing on the landing up-stairs. Then light footsteps became audible,\ndescending the staircase with a certain deliberation and a faint rustle\nof skirts.\n\n\"Tell her,\" said Mr. Stanley, with an imperious gesture, \"to come in\nhere.\"\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nMiss Stanley emerged from the study and stood watching Ann Veronica\ndescend.\n\nThe girl was flushed with excitement, bright-eyed, and braced for a\nstruggle; her aunt had never seen her looking so fine or so pretty.\nHer fancy dress, save for the green-gray stockings, the pseudo-Turkish\nslippers, and baggy silk trousered ends natural to a Corsair's bride,\nwas hidden in a large black-silk-hooded opera-cloak. Beneath the hood\nit was evident that her rebellious hair was bound up with red silk, and\nfastened by some device in her ears (unless she had them pierced, which\nwas too dreadful a thing to suppose!) were long brass filigree earrings.\n\n\"I'm just off, aunt,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Your father is in the study and wishes to speak to you.\"\n\nAnn Veronica hesitated, and then stood in the open doorway and regarded\nher father's stern presence. She spoke with an entirely false note of\ncheerful off-handedness. \"I'm just in time to say good-bye before I go,\nfather. I'm going up to London with the Widgetts to that ball.\"\n\n\"Now look here, Ann Veronica,\" said Mr. Stanley, \"just a moment. You are\nNOT going to that ball!\"\n\nAnn Veronica tried a less genial, more dignified note.\n\n\"I thought we had discussed that, father.\"\n\n\"You are not going to that ball! You are not going out of this house in\nthat get-up!\"\n\nAnn Veronica tried yet more earnestly to treat him, as she would treat\nany man, with an insistence upon her due of masculine respect. \"You\nsee,\" she said, very gently, \"I AM going. I am sorry to seem to disobey\nyou, but I am. I wish\"--she found she had embarked on a bad sentence--\"I\nwish we needn't have quarrelled.\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly, and turned about toward the front door. In a\nmoment he was beside her. \"I don't think you can have heard me, Vee,\"\nhe said, with intensely controlled fury. \"I said you were\"--he\nshouted--\"NOT TO GO!\"\n\nShe made, and overdid, an immense effort to be a princess. She tossed\nher head, and, having no further words, moved toward the door. Her\nfather intercepted her, and for a moment she and he struggled with their\nhands upon the latch. A common rage flushed their faces. \"Let go!\" she\ngasped at him, a blaze of anger.\n\n\"Veronica!\" cried Miss Stanley, warningly, and, \"Peter!\"\n\nFor a moment they seemed on the verge of an altogether desperate\nscuffle. Never for a moment had violence come between these two since\nlong ago he had, in spite of her mother's protest in the background,\ncarried her kicking and squalling to the nursery for some forgotten\ncrime. With something near to horror they found themselves thus\nconfronted.\n\nThe door was fastened by a catch and a latch with an inside key, to\nwhich at night a chain and two bolts were added. Carefully abstaining\nfrom thrusting against each other, Ann Veronica and her father began an\nabsurdly desperate struggle, the one to open the door, the other to keep\nit fastened. She seized the key, and he grasped her hand and squeezed\nit roughly and painfully between the handle and the ward as she tried to\nturn it. His grip twisted her wrist. She cried out with the pain of it.\n\nA wild passion of shame and self-disgust swept over her. Her spirit\nawoke in dismay to an affection in ruins, to the immense undignified\ndisaster that had come to them.\n\nAbruptly she desisted, recoiled, and turned and fled up-stairs.\n\nShe made noises between weeping and laughter as she went. She gained her\nroom, and slammed her door and locked it as though she feared violence\nand pursuit.\n\n\"Oh God!\" she cried, \"Oh God!\" and flung aside her opera-cloak, and for\na time walked about the room--a Corsair's bride at a crisis of emotion.\n\"Why can't he reason with me,\" she said, again and again, \"instead of\ndoing this?\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nThere presently came a phase in which she said: \"I WON'T stand it even\nnow. I will go to-night.\"\n\nShe went as far as her door, then turned to the window. She opened\nthis and scrambled out--a thing she had not done for five long years of\nadolescence--upon the leaded space above the built-out bath-room on the\nfirst floor. Once upon a time she and Roddy had descended thence by the\ndrain-pipe.\n\nBut things that a girl of sixteen may do in short skirts are not\nthings to be done by a young lady of twenty-one in fancy dress and\nan opera-cloak, and just as she was coming unaided to an adequate\nrealization of this, she discovered Mr. Pragmar, the wholesale druggist,\nwho lived three gardens away, and who had been mowing his lawn to get\nan appetite for dinner, standing in a fascinated attitude beside the\nforgotten lawn-mower and watching her intently.\n\nShe found it extremely difficult to infuse an air of quiet correctitude\ninto her return through the window, and when she was safely inside she\nwaved clinched fists and executed a noiseless dance of rage.\n\nWhen she reflected that Mr. Pragmar probably knew Mr. Ramage, and might\ndescribe the affair to him, she cried \"Oh!\" with renewed vexation, and\nrepeated some steps of her dance in a new and more ecstatic measure.\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nAt eight that evening Miss Stanley tapped at Ann Veronica's bedroom\ndoor.\n\n\"I've brought you up some dinner, Vee,\" she said.\n\nAnn Veronica was lying on her bed in a darkling room staring at the\nceiling. She reflected before answering. She was frightfully hungry.\nShe had eaten little or no tea, and her mid-day meal had been worse than\nnothing.\n\nShe got up and unlocked the door.\n\nHer aunt did not object to capital punishment or war, or the industrial\nsystem or casual wards, or flogging of criminals or the Congo Free\nState, because none of these things really got hold of her imagination;\nbut she did object, she did not like, she could not bear to think of\npeople not having and enjoying their meals. It was her distinctive test\nof an emotional state, its interference with a kindly normal digestion.\nAny one very badly moved choked down a few mouthfuls; the symptom of\nsupreme distress was not to be able to touch a bit. So that the thought\nof Ann Veronica up-stairs had been extremely painful for her through all\nthe silent dinner-time that night. As soon as dinner was over she went\ninto the kitchen and devoted herself to compiling a tray--not a tray\nmerely of half-cooled dinner things, but a specially prepared \"nice\"\ntray, suitable for tempting any one. With this she now entered.\n\nAnn Veronica found herself in the presence of the most disconcerting\nfact in human experience, the kindliness of people you believe to be\nthoroughly wrong. She took the tray with both hands, gulped, and gave\nway to tears.\n\nHer aunt leaped unhappily to the thought of penitence.\n\n\"My dear,\" she began, with an affectionate hand on Ann Veronica's\nshoulder, \"I do SO wish you would realize how it grieves your father.\"\n\nAnn Veronica flung away from her hand, and the pepper-pot on the tray\nupset, sending a puff of pepper into the air and instantly filling them\nboth with an intense desire to sneeze.\n\n\"I don't think you see,\" she replied, with tears on her cheeks, and her\nbrows knitting, \"how it shames and, ah!--disgraces me--AH TISHU!\"\n\nShe put down the tray with a concussion on her toilet-table.\n\n\"But, dear, think! He is your father. SHOOH!\"\n\n\"That's no reason,\" said Ann Veronica, speaking through her handkerchief\nand stopping abruptly.\n\nNiece and aunt regarded each other for a moment over their\npocket-handkerchiefs with watery but antagonistic eyes, each far too\nprofoundly moved to see the absurdity of the position.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Miss Stanley, with dignity, and turned doorward with\nfeatures in civil warfare. \"Better state of mind,\" she gasped....\n\nAnn Veronica stood in the twilight room staring at the door that had\nslammed upon her aunt, her pocket-handkerchief rolled tightly in her\nhand. Her soul was full of the sense of disaster. She had made her first\nfight for dignity and freedom as a grown-up and independent Person, and\nthis was how the universe had treated her. It had neither succumbed\nto her nor wrathfully overwhelmed her. It had thrust her back with an\nundignified scuffle, with vulgar comedy, with an unendurable, scornful\ngrin.\n\n\"By God!\" said Ann Veronica for the first time in her life. \"But I will!\nI will!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH\n\nTHE FLIGHT TO LONDON\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nAnn Veronica had an impression that she did not sleep at all that night,\nand at any rate she got through an immense amount of feverish feeling\nand thinking.\n\nWhat was she going to do?\n\nOne main idea possessed her: she must get away from home, she must\nassert herself at once or perish. \"Very well,\" she would say, \"then I\nmust go.\" To remain, she felt, was to concede everything. And she would\nhave to go to-morrow. It was clear it must be to-morrow. If she delayed\na day she would delay two days, if she delayed two days she would delay\na week, and after a week things would be adjusted to submission forever.\n\"I'll go,\" she vowed to the night, \"or I'll die!\" She made plans and\nestimated means and resources. These and her general preparations had\nperhaps a certain disproportion. She had a gold watch, a very good gold\nwatch that had been her mother's, a pearl necklace that was also pretty\ngood, some unpretending rings, some silver bangles and a few other such\ninferior trinkets, three pounds thirteen shillings unspent of her\ndress and book allowance and a few good salable books. So equipped, she\nproposed to set up a separate establishment in the world.\n\nAnd then she would find work.\n\nFor most of a long and fluctuating night she was fairly confident that\nshe would find work; she knew herself to be strong, intelligent, and\ncapable by the standards of most of the girls she knew. She was not\nquite clear how she should find it, but she felt she would. Then\nshe would write and tell her father what she had done, and put their\nrelationship on a new footing.\n\nThat was how she projected it, and in general terms it seemed plausible\nand possible. But in between these wider phases of comparative\nconfidence were gaps of disconcerting doubt, when the universe was\npresented as making sinister and threatening faces at her, defying her\nto defy, preparing a humiliating and shameful overthrow. \"I don't care,\"\nsaid Ann Veronica to the darkness; \"I'll fight it.\"\n\nShe tried to plan her proceedings in detail. The only difficulties that\npresented themselves clearly to her were the difficulties of getting\naway from Morningside Park, and not the difficulties at the other end\nof the journey. These were so outside her experience that she found it\npossible to thrust them almost out of sight by saying they would be \"all\nright\" in confident tones to herself. But still she knew they were not\nright, and at times they became a horrible obsession as of something\nwaiting for her round the corner. She tried to imagine herself \"getting\nsomething,\" to project herself as sitting down at a desk and writing,\nor as returning after her work to some pleasantly equipped and free and\nindependent flat. For a time she furnished the flat. But even with\nthat furniture it remained extremely vague, the possible good and the\npossible evil as well!\n\nThe possible evil! \"I'll go,\" said Ann Veronica for the hundredth time.\n\"I'll go. I don't care WHAT happens.\"\n\nShe awoke out of a doze, as though she had never been sleeping. It was\ntime to get up.\n\nShe sat on the edge of her bed and looked about her, at her room, at the\nrow of black-covered books and the pig's skull. \"I must take them,\"\nshe said, to help herself over her own incredulity. \"How shall I get my\nluggage out of the house?...\"\n\nThe figure of her aunt, a little distant, a little propitiatory, behind\nthe coffee things, filled her with a sense of almost catastrophic\nadventure. Perhaps she might never come back to that breakfast-room\nagain. Never! Perhaps some day, quite soon, she might regret that\nbreakfast-room. She helped herself to the remainder of the slightly\ncongealed bacon, and reverted to the problem of getting her luggage\nout of the house. She decided to call in the help of Teddy Widgett, or,\nfailing him, of one of his sisters.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nShe found the younger generation of the Widgetts engaged in languid\nreminiscences, and all, as they expressed it, a \"bit decayed.\" Every\none became tremendously animated when they heard that Ann Veronica had\nfailed them because she had been, as she expressed it, \"locked in.\"\n\n\"My God!\" said Teddy, more impressively than ever.\n\n\"But what are you going to do?\" asked Hetty.\n\n\"What can one do?\" asked Ann Veronica. \"Would you stand it? I'm going to\nclear out.\"\n\n\"Clear out?\" cried Hetty.\n\n\"Go to London,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nShe had expected sympathetic admiration, but instead the whole Widgett\nfamily, except Teddy, expressed a common dismay. \"But how can you?\"\nasked Constance. \"Who will you stop with?\"\n\n\"I shall go on my own. Take a room!\"\n\n\"I say!\" said Constance. \"But who's going to pay for the room?\"\n\n\"I've got money,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Anything is better than this--this\nstifled life down here.\" And seeing that Hetty and Constance were\nobviously developing objections, she plunged at once into a demand for\nhelp. \"I've got nothing in the world to pack with except a toy size\nportmanteau. Can you lend me some stuff?\"\n\n\"You ARE a chap!\" said Constance, and warmed only slowly from the idea\nof dissuasion to the idea of help. But they did what they could for her.\nThey agreed to lend her their hold-all and a large, formless bag which\nthey called the communal trunk. And Teddy declared himself ready to go\nto the ends of the earth for her, and carry her luggage all the way.\n\nHetty, looking out of the window--she always smoked her after-breakfast\ncigarette at the window for the benefit of the less advanced section of\nMorningside Park society--and trying not to raise objections, saw Miss\nStanley going down toward the shops.\n\n\"If you must go on with it,\" said Hetty, \"now's your time.\" And Ann\nVeronica at once went back with the hold-all, trying not to hurry\nindecently but to keep up her dignified air of being a wronged person\ndoing the right thing at a smart trot, to pack. Teddy went round by the\ngarden backs and dropped the bag over the fence. All this was exciting\nand entertaining. Her aunt returned before the packing was done, and\nAnn Veronica lunched with an uneasy sense of bag and hold-all packed\nup-stairs and inadequately hidden from chance intruders by the valance\nof the bed. She went down, flushed and light-hearted, to the Widgetts'\nafter lunch to make some final arrangements and then, as soon as her\naunt had retired to lie down for her usual digestive hour, took the\nrisk of the servants having the enterprise to report her proceedings\nand carried her bag and hold-all to the garden gate, whence Teddy, in\na state of ecstatic service, bore them to the railway station. Then she\nwent up-stairs again, dressed herself carefully for town, put on her\nmost businesslike-looking hat, and with a wave of emotion she found it\nhard to control, walked down to catch the 3.17 up-train.\n\nTeddy handed her into the second-class compartment her season-ticket\nwarranted, and declared she was \"simply splendid.\" \"If you want\nanything,\" he said, \"or get into any trouble, wire me. I'd come back\nfrom the ends of the earth. I'd do anything, Vee. It's horrible to think\nof you!\"\n\n\"You're an awful brick, Teddy!\" she said.\n\n\"Who wouldn't be for you?\"\n\nThe train began to move. \"You're splendid!\" said Teddy, with his hair\nwild in the wind. \"Good luck! Good luck!\"\n\nShe waved from the window until the bend hid him.\n\nShe found herself alone in the train asking herself what she must do\nnext, and trying not to think of herself as cut off from home or any\nrefuge whatever from the world she had resolved to face. She felt\nsmaller and more adventurous even than she had expected to feel. \"Let\nme see,\" she said to herself, trying to control a slight sinking of the\nheart, \"I am going to take a room in a lodging-house because that is\ncheaper.... But perhaps I had better get a room in an hotel to-night\nand look round....\n\n\"It's bound to be all right,\" she said.\n\nBut her heart kept on sinking. What hotel should she go to? If she told\na cabman to drive to an hotel, any hotel, what would he do--or say? He\nmight drive to something dreadfully expensive, and not at all the quiet\nsort of thing she required. Finally she decided that even for an hotel\nshe must look round, and that meanwhile she would \"book\" her luggage at\nWaterloo. She told the porter to take it to the booking-office, and it\nwas only after a disconcerting moment or so that she found she ought to\nhave directed him to go to the cloak-room. But that was soon put right,\nand she walked out into London with a peculiar exaltation of mind, an\nexaltation that partook of panic and defiance, but was chiefly a sense\nof vast unexampled release.\n\nShe inhaled a deep breath of air--London air.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nShe dismissed the first hotels she passed, she scarcely knew why, mainly\nperhaps from the mere dread of entering them, and crossed Waterloo\nBridge at a leisurely pace. It was high afternoon, there was no great\nthrong of foot-passengers, and many an eye from omnibus and pavement\nrested gratefully on her fresh, trim presence as she passed young\nand erect, with the light of determination shining through the quiet\nself-possession of her face. She was dressed as English girls do dress\nfor town, without either coquetry or harshness: her collarless blouse\nconfessed a pretty neck, her eyes were bright and steady, and her dark\nhair waved loosely and graciously over her ears....\n\nIt seemed at first the most beautiful afternoon of all time to her,\nand perhaps the thrill of her excitement did add a distinctive and\nculminating keenness to the day. The river, the big buildings on the\nnorth bank, Westminster, and St. Paul's, were rich and wonderful with\nthe soft sunshine of London, the softest, the finest grained, the most\npenetrating and least emphatic sunshine in the world. The very carts\nand vans and cabs that Wellington Street poured out incessantly upon\nthe bridge seemed ripe and good in her eyes. A traffic of copious barges\nslumbered over the face of the river-barges either altogether stagnant\nor dreaming along in the wake of fussy tugs; and above circled, urbanely\nvoracious, the London seagulls. She had never been there before at that\nhour, in that light, and it seemed to her as if she came to it all for\nthe first time. And this great mellow place, this London, now was hers,\nto struggle with, to go where she pleased in, to overcome and live in.\n\"I am glad,\" she told herself, \"I came.\"\n\nShe marked an hotel that seemed neither opulent nor odd in a little side\nstreet opening on the Embankment, made up her mind with an effort, and,\nreturning by Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo, took a cab to this chosen\nrefuge with her two pieces of luggage. There was just a minute's\nhesitation before they gave her a room.\n\nThe young lady in the bureau said she would inquire, and Ann Veronica,\nwhile she affected to read the appeal on a hospital collecting-box upon\nthe bureau counter, had a disagreeable sense of being surveyed from\nbehind by a small, whiskered gentleman in a frock-coat, who came out of\nthe inner office and into the hall among a number of equally observant\ngreen porters to look at her and her bags. But the survey was\nsatisfactory, and she found herself presently in Room No. 47,\nstraightening her hat and waiting for her luggage to appear.\n\n\"All right so far,\" she said to herself....\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nBut presently, as she sat on the one antimacassared red silk chair\nand surveyed her hold-all and bag in that tidy, rather vacant, and\ndehumanized apartment, with its empty wardrobe and desert toilet-table\nand pictureless walls and stereotyped furnishings, a sudden blankness\ncame upon her as though she didn't matter, and had been thrust away into\nthis impersonal corner, she and her gear....\n\nShe decided to go out into the London afternoon again and get something\nto eat in an Aerated Bread shop or some such place, and perhaps find a\ncheap room for herself. Of course that was what she had to do; she had\nto find a cheap room for herself and work!\n\nThis Room No. 47 was no more than a sort of railway compartment on the\nway to that.\n\nHow does one get work?\n\nShe walked along the Strand and across Trafalgar Square, and by the\nHaymarket to Piccadilly, and so through dignified squares and palatial\nalleys to Oxford Street; and her mind was divided between a speculative\ntreatment of employment on the one hand, and breezes--zephyr breezes--of\nthe keenest appreciation for London, on the other. The jolly part of it\nwas that for the first time in her life so far as London was concerned,\nshe was not going anywhere in particular; for the first time in her life\nit seemed to her she was taking London in.\n\nShe tried to think how people get work. Ought she to walk into some\nof these places and tell them what she could do? She hesitated at the\nwindow of a shipping-office in Cockspur Street and at the Army and\nNavy Stores, but decided that perhaps there would be some special and\ncustomary hour, and that it would be better for her to find this out\nbefore she made her attempt. And, besides, she didn't just immediately\nwant to make her attempt.\n\nShe fell into a pleasant dream of positions and work. Behind every one\nof these myriad fronts she passed there must be a career or careers. Her\nideas of women's employment and a modern woman's pose in life were based\nlargely on the figure of Vivie Warren in Mrs. Warren's Profession. She\nhad seen Mrs. Warren's Profession furtively with Hetty Widgett from the\ngallery of a Stage Society performance one Monday afternoon. Most of\nit had been incomprehensible to her, or comprehensible in a way that\nchecked further curiosity, but the figure of Vivien, hard, capable,\nsuccessful, and bullying, and ordering about a veritable Teddy in the\nperson of Frank Gardner, appealed to her. She saw herself in very much\nVivie's position--managing something.\n\nHer thoughts were deflected from Vivie Warren by the peculiar behavior\nof a middle-aged gentleman in Piccadilly. He appeared suddenly from\nthe infinite in the neighborhood of the Burlington Arcade, crossing\nthe pavement toward her and with his eyes upon her. He seemed to her\nindistinguishably about her father's age. He wore a silk hat a little\ntilted, and a morning coat buttoned round a tight, contained figure;\nand a white slip gave a finish to his costume and endorsed the quiet\ndistinction of his tie. His face was a little flushed perhaps, and his\nsmall, brown eyes were bright. He stopped on the curb-stone, not facing\nher but as if he was on his way to cross the road, and spoke to her\nsuddenly over his shoulder.\n\n\"Whither away?\" he said, very distinctly in a curiously wheedling voice.\nAnn Veronica stared at his foolish, propitiatory smile, his hungry gaze,\nthrough one moment of amazement, then stepped aside and went on her way\nwith a quickened step. But her mind was ruffled, and its mirror-like\nsurface of satisfaction was not easily restored.\n\nQueer old gentleman!\n\nThe art of ignoring is one of the accomplishments of every well-bred\ngirl, so carefully instilled that at last she can even ignore her own\nthoughts and her own knowledge. Ann Veronica could at the same time ask\nherself what this queer old gentleman could have meant by speaking to\nher, and know--know in general terms, at least--what that accosting\nsignified. About her, as she had gone day by day to and from the\nTredgold College, she had seen and not seen many an incidental aspect\nof those sides of life about which girls are expected to know nothing,\naspects that were extraordinarily relevant to her own position and\noutlook on the world, and yet by convention ineffably remote. For all\nthat she was of exceptional intellectual enterprise, she had never\nyet considered these things with unaverted eyes. She had viewed them\naskance, and without exchanging ideas with any one else in the world\nabout them.\n\nShe went on her way now no longer dreaming and appreciative, but\ndisturbed and unwillingly observant behind her mask of serene\ncontentment.\n\nThat delightful sense of free, unembarrassed movement was gone.\n\nAs she neared the bottom of the dip in Piccadilly she saw a woman\napproaching her from the opposite direction--a tall woman who at the\nfirst glance seemed altogether beautiful and fine. She came along with\nthe fluttering assurance of some tall ship. Then as she drew nearer\npaint showed upon her face, and a harsh purpose behind the quiet\nexpression of her open countenance, and a sort of unreality in her\nsplendor betrayed itself for which Ann Veronica could not recall the\nright word--a word, half understood, that lurked and hid in her mind,\nthe word \"meretricious.\" Behind this woman and a little to the side\nof her, walked a man smartly dressed, with desire and appraisal in his\neyes. Something insisted that those two were mysteriously linked--that\nthe woman knew the man was there.\n\nIt was a second reminder that against her claim to go free and\nuntrammelled there was a case to be made, that after all it was true\nthat a girl does not go alone in the world unchallenged, nor ever has\ngone freely alone in the world, that evil walks abroad and dangers, and\npetty insults more irritating than dangers, lurk.\n\nIt was in the quiet streets and squares toward Oxford Street that\nit first came into her head disagreeably that she herself was being\nfollowed. She observed a man walking on the opposite side of the way and\nlooking toward her.\n\n\"Bother it all!\" she swore. \"Bother!\" and decided that this was not so,\nand would not look to right or left again.\n\nBeyond the Circus Ann Veronica went into a British Tea-Table Company\nshop to get some tea. And as she was yet waiting for her tea to come she\nsaw this man again. Either it was an unfortunate recovery of a trail, or\nhe had followed her from Mayfair. There was no mistaking his intentions\nthis time. He came down the shop looking for her quite obviously, and\ntook up a position on the other side against a mirror in which he was\nable to regard her steadfastly.\n\nBeneath the serene unconcern of Ann Veronica's face was a boiling\ntumult. She was furiously angry. She gazed with a quiet detachment\ntoward the window and the Oxford Street traffic, and in her heart she\nwas busy kicking this man to death. He HAD followed her! What had he\nfollowed her for? He must have followed her all the way from beyond\nGrosvenor Square.\n\nHe was a tall man and fair, with bluish eyes that were rather\nprotuberant, and long white hands of which he made a display. He had\nremoved his silk hat, and now sat looking at Ann Veronica over an\nuntouched cup of tea; he sat gloating upon her, trying to catch her eye.\nOnce, when he thought he had done so, he smiled an ingratiating smile.\nHe moved, after quiet intervals, with a quick little movement, and ever\nand again stroked his small mustache and coughed a self-conscious cough.\n\n\"That he should be in the same world with me!\" said Ann Veronica,\nreduced to reading the list of good things the British Tea-Table Company\nhad priced for its patrons.\n\nHeaven knows what dim and tawdry conceptions of passion and desire were\nin that blond cranium, what romance-begotten dreams of intrigue and\nadventure! but they sufficed, when presently Ann Veronica went out\ninto the darkling street again, to inspire a flitting, dogged pursuit,\nidiotic, exasperating, indecent.\n\nShe had no idea what she should do. If she spoke to a policeman she did\nnot know what would ensue. Perhaps she would have to charge this man and\nappear in a police-court next day.\n\nShe became angry with herself. She would not be driven in by this\npersistent, sneaking aggression. She would ignore him. Surely she could\nignore him. She stopped abruptly, and looked in a flower-shop window. He\npassed, and came loitering back and stood beside her, silently looking\ninto her face.\n\nThe afternoon had passed now into twilight. The shops were lighting\nup into gigantic lanterns of color, the street lamps were glowing\ninto existence, and she had lost her way. She had lost her sense of\ndirection, and was among unfamiliar streets. She went on from street to\nstreet, and all the glory of London had departed. Against the sinister,\nthe threatening, monstrous inhumanity of the limitless city, there was\nnothing now but this supreme, ugly fact of a pursuit--the pursuit of the\nundesired, persistent male.\n\nFor a second time Ann Veronica wanted to swear at the universe.\n\nThere were moments when she thought of turning upon this man and\ntalking to him. But there was something in his face at once stupid and\ninvincible that told her he would go on forcing himself upon her, that\nhe would esteem speech with her a great point gained. In the twilight\nhe had ceased to be a person one could tackle and shame; he had become\nsomething more general, a something that crawled and sneaked toward her\nand would not let her alone....\n\nThen, when the tension was getting unendurable, and she was on the verge\nof speaking to some casual passer-by and demanding help, her follower\nvanished. For a time she could scarcely believe he was gone. He had. The\nnight had swallowed him up, but his work on her was done. She had lost\nher nerve, and there was no more freedom in London for her that night.\nShe was glad to join in the stream of hurrying homeward workers that was\nnow welling out of a thousand places of employment, and to imitate their\ndriven, preoccupied haste. She had followed a bobbing white hat and gray\njacket until she reached the Euston Road corner of Tottenham Court Road,\nand there, by the name on a bus and the cries of a conductor, she made\na guess of her way. And she did not merely affect to be driven--she felt\ndriven. She was afraid people would follow her, she was afraid of the\ndark, open doorways she passed, and afraid of the blazes of light; she\nwas afraid to be alone, and she knew not what it was she feared.\n\nIt was past seven when she got back to her hotel. She thought then that\nshe had shaken off the man of the bulging blue eyes forever, but that\nnight she found he followed her into her dreams. He stalked her, he\nstared at her, he craved her, he sidled slinking and propitiatory\nand yet relentlessly toward her, until at last she awoke from the\nsuffocating nightmare nearness of his approach, and lay awake in fear\nand horror listening to the unaccustomed sounds of the hotel.\n\nShe came very near that night to resolving that she would return to\nher home next morning. But the morning brought courage again, and those\nfirst intimations of horror vanished completely from her mind.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nShe had sent her father a telegram from the East Strand post-office\nworded thus:\n\n     |   All   |    is     |   well   |   with   |   me    |\n     |---------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|\n     |   and   |   quite   |   safe   | Veronica |         |\n     -----------------------------------------------------\n\nand afterward she had dined a la carte upon a cutlet, and had then set\nherself to write an answer to Mr. Manning's proposal of marriage. But\nshe had found it very difficult.\n\n\n\"DEAR MR. MANNING,\" she had begun. So far it had been plain sailing,\nand it had seemed fairly evident to go on: \"I find it very difficult to\nanswer your letter.\"\n\nBut after that neither ideas nor phrases had come and she had fallen\nthinking of the events of the day. She had decided that she would spend\nthe next morning answering advertisements in the papers that abounded in\nthe writing-room; and so, after half an hour's perusal of back numbers\nof the Sketch in the drawing-room, she had gone to bed.\n\nShe found next morning, when she came to this advertisement answering,\nthat it was more difficult than she had supposed. In the first place\nthere were not so many suitable advertisements as she had expected.\nShe sat down by the paper-rack with a general feeling of resemblance\nto Vivie Warren, and looked through the Morning Post and Standard and\nTelegraph, and afterward the half-penny sheets. The Morning Post was\nhungry for governesses and nursery governesses, but held out no other\nhopes; the Daily Telegraph that morning seemed eager only for skirt\nhands. She went to a writing-desk and made some memoranda on a sheet of\nnote-paper, and then remembered that she had no address as yet to which\nletters could be sent.\n\nShe decided to leave this matter until the morrow and devote the morning\nto settling up with Mr. Manning. At the cost of quite a number of torn\ndrafts she succeeded in evolving this:\n\n\"DEAR MR. MANNING,--I find it very difficult to answer your letter.\nI hope you won't mind if I say first that I think it does me an\nextraordinary honor that you should think of any one like myself\nso highly and seriously, and, secondly, that I wish it had not been\nwritten.\"\n\nShe surveyed this sentence for some time before going on. \"I wonder,\"\nshe said, \"why one writes him sentences like that? It'll have to go,\"\nshe decided, \"I've written too many already.\" She went on, with a\ndesperate attempt to be easy and colloquial:\n\n\"You see, we were rather good friends, I thought, and now perhaps it\nwill be difficult for us to get back to the old friendly footing. But if\nthat can possibly be done I want it to be done. You see, the plain fact\nof the case is that I think I am too young and ignorant for marriage.\nI have been thinking these things over lately, and it seems to me that\nmarriage for a girl is just the supremest thing in life. It isn't just\none among a number of important things; for her it is the important\nthing, and until she knows far more than I know of the facts of life,\nhow is she to undertake it? So please; if you will, forget that you\nwrote that letter, and forgive this answer. I want you to think of me\njust as if I was a man, and quite outside marriage altogether.\n\n\"I do hope you will be able to do this, because I value men friends.\nI shall be very sorry if I cannot have you for a friend. I think that\nthere is no better friend for a girl than a man rather older than\nherself.\n\n\"Perhaps by this time you will have heard of the step I have taken in\nleaving my home. Very likely you will disapprove highly of what I have\ndone--I wonder? You may, perhaps, think I have done it just in a fit of\nchildish petulance because my father locked me in when I wanted to go\nto a ball of which he did not approve. But really it is much more\nthan that. At Morningside Park I feel as though all my growing up was\npresently to stop, as though I was being shut in from the light of life,\nand, as they say in botany, etiolated. I was just like a sort of dummy\nthat does things as it is told--that is to say, as the strings are\npulled. I want to be a person by myself, and to pull my own strings. I\nhad rather have trouble and hardship like that than be taken care of by\nothers. I want to be myself. I wonder if a man can quite understand that\npassionate feeling? It is quite a passionate feeling. So I am already\nno longer the girl you knew at Morningside Park. I am a young person\nseeking employment and freedom and self-development, just as in quite\nour first talk of all I said I wanted to be.\n\n\"I do hope you will see how things are, and not be offended with me or\nfrightfully shocked and distressed by what I have done.\n\n\"Very sincerely yours,\n\n\"ANN VERONICA STANLEY.\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nIn the afternoon she resumed her search for apartments. The intoxicating\nsense of novelty had given place to a more business-like mood. She\ndrifted northward from the Strand, and came on some queer and dingy\nquarters.\n\nShe had never imagined life was half so sinister as it looked to her in\nthe beginning of these investigations. She found herself again in the\npresence of some element in life about which she had been trained not\nto think, about which she was perhaps instinctively indisposed to think;\nsomething which jarred, in spite of all her mental resistance, with\nall her preconceptions of a clean and courageous girl walking out from\nMorningside Park as one walks out of a cell into a free and spacious\nworld. One or two landladies refused her with an air of conscious virtue\nthat she found hard to explain. \"We don't let to ladies,\" they said.\n\nShe drifted, via Theobald's Road, obliquely toward the region about\nTitchfield Street. Such apartments as she saw were either scandalously\ndirty or unaccountably dear, or both. And some were adorned with\nengravings that struck her as being more vulgar and undesirable than\nanything she had ever seen in her life. Ann Veronica loved beautiful\nthings, and the beauty of undraped loveliness not least among them; but\nthese were pictures that did but insist coarsely upon the roundness of\nwomen's bodies. The windows of these rooms were obscured with draperies,\ntheir floors a carpet patchwork; the china ornaments on their mantels\nwere of a class apart. After the first onset several of the women who\nhad apartments to let said she would not do for them, and in effect\ndismissed her. This also struck her as odd.\n\nAbout many of these houses hung a mysterious taint as of something\nweakly and commonly and dustily evil; the women who negotiated the rooms\nlooked out through a friendly manner as though it was a mask, with hard,\ndefiant eyes. Then one old crone, short-sighted and shaky-handed, called\nAnn Veronica \"dearie,\" and made some remark, obscure and slangy, of\nwhich the spirit rather than the words penetrated to her understanding.\n\nFor a time she looked at no more apartments, and walked through\ngaunt and ill-cleaned streets, through the sordid under side of life,\nperplexed and troubled, ashamed of her previous obtuseness.\n\nShe had something of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has been\ninto surroundings or touched something that offends his caste. She\npassed people in the streets and regarded them with a quickening\napprehension, once or twice came girls dressed in slatternly finery,\ngoing toward Regent Street from out these places. It did not occur to\nher that they at least had found a way of earning a living, and had that\nmuch economic superiority to herself. It did not occur to her that save\nfor some accidents of education and character they had souls like her\nown.\n\nFor a time Ann Veronica went on her way gauging the quality of sordid\nstreets. At last, a little way to the northward of Euston Road, the\nmoral cloud seemed to lift, the moral atmosphere to change; clean blinds\nappeared in the windows, clean doorsteps before the doors, a different\nappeal in the neatly placed cards bearing the word\n\n     --------------------------\n     |        APARTMENTS        |\n     --------------------------\n\nin the clear bright windows. At last in a street near the Hampstead Road\nshe hit upon a room that had an exceptional quality of space and order,\nand a tall woman with a kindly face to show it. \"You're a student,\nperhaps?\" said the tall woman. \"At the Tredgold Women's College,\" said\nAnn Veronica. She felt it would save explanations if she did not state\nshe had left her home and was looking for employment. The room was\npapered with green, large-patterned paper that was at worst a trifle\ndingy, and the arm-chair and the seats of the other chairs were covered\nwith the unusual brightness of a large-patterned chintz, which also\nsupplied the window-curtain. There was a round table covered, not with\nthe usual \"tapestry\" cover, but with a plain green cloth that went\npassably with the wall-paper. In the recess beside the fireplace\nwere some open bookshelves. The carpet was a quiet drugget and not\nexcessively worn, and the bed in the corner was covered by a white\nquilt. There were neither texts nor rubbish on the walls, but only a\nstirring version of Belshazzar's feast, a steel engraving in the early\nVictorian manner that had some satisfactory blacks. And the woman who\nshowed this room was tall, with an understanding eye and the quiet\nmanner of the well-trained servant.\n\nAnn Veronica brought her luggage in a cab from the hotel; she tipped the\nhotel porter sixpence and overpaid the cabman eighteenpence, unpacked\nsome of her books and possessions, and so made the room a little\nhomelike, and then sat down in a by no means uncomfortable arm-chair\nbefore the fire. She had arranged for a supper of tea, a boiled egg, and\nsome tinned peaches. She had discussed the general question of supplies\nwith the helpful landlady. \"And now,\" said Ann Veronica surveying her\napartment with an unprecedented sense of proprietorship, \"what is the\nnext step?\"\n\nShe spent the evening in writing--it was a little difficult--to her\nfather and--which was easier--to the Widgetts. She was greatly heartened\nby doing this. The necessity of defending herself and assuming a\nconfident and secure tone did much to dispell the sense of being\nexposed and indefensible in a huge dingy world that abounded in sinister\npossibilities. She addressed her letters, meditated on them for a time,\nand then took them out and posted them. Afterward she wanted to get her\nletter to her father back in order to read it over again, and, if it\ntallied with her general impression of it, re-write it.\n\nHe would know her address to-morrow. She reflected upon that with a\nthrill of terror that was also, somehow, in some faint remote way,\ngleeful.\n\n\"Dear old Daddy,\" she said, \"he'll make a fearful fuss. Well, it had to\nhappen somewhen.... Somehow. I wonder what he'll say?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH\n\nEXPOSTULATIONS\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nThe next morning opened calmly, and Ann Veronica sat in her own room,\nher very own room, and consumed an egg and marmalade, and read the\nadvertisements in the Daily Telegraph. Then began expostulations,\npreluded by a telegram and headed by her aunt. The telegram reminded\nAnn Veronica that she had no place for interviews except her\nbed-sitting-room, and she sought her landlady and negotiated hastily for\nthe use of the ground floor parlor, which very fortunately was vacant.\nShe explained she was expecting an important interview, and asked that\nher visitor should be duly shown in. Her aunt arrived about half-past\nten, in black and with an unusually thick spotted veil. She raised this\nwith the air of a conspirator unmasking, and displayed a tear-flushed\nface. For a moment she remained silent.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, when she could get her breath, \"you must come home\nat once.\"\n\nAnn Veronica closed the door quite softly and stood still.\n\n\"This has almost killed your father.... After Gwen!\"\n\n\"I sent a telegram.\"\n\n\"He cares so much for you. He did so care for you.\"\n\n\"I sent a telegram to say I was all right.\"\n\n\"All right! And I never dreamed anything of the sort was going on. I\nhad no idea!\" She sat down abruptly and threw her wrists limply upon the\ntable. \"Oh, Veronica!\" she said, \"to leave your home!\"\n\nShe had been weeping. She was weeping now. Ann Veronica was overcome by\nthis amount of emotion.\n\n\"Why did you do it?\" her aunt urged. \"Why could you not confide in us?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"What you have done.\"\n\n\"But what have I done?\"\n\n\"Elope! Go off in this way. We had no idea. We had such a pride in\nyou, such hope in you. I had no idea you were not the happiest girl.\nEverything I could do! Your father sat up all night. Until at last I\npersuaded him to go to bed. He wanted to put on his overcoat and come\nafter you and look for you--in London. We made sure it was just like\nGwen. Only Gwen left a letter on the pincushion. You didn't even do that\nVee; not even that.\"\n\n\"I sent a telegram, aunt,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Like a stab. You didn't even put the twelve words.\"\n\n\"I said I was all right.\"\n\n\"Gwen said she was happy. Before that came your father didn't even\nknow you were gone. He was just getting cross about your being late for\ndinner--you know his way--when it came. He opened it--just off-hand, and\nthen when he saw what it was he hit at the table and sent his soup spoon\nflying and splashing on to the tablecloth. 'My God!' he said, 'I'll go\nafter them and kill him. I'll go after them and kill him.' For the\nmoment I thought it was a telegram from Gwen.\"\n\n\"But what did father imagine?\"\n\n\"Of course he imagined! Any one would! 'What has happened, Peter?' I\nasked. He was standing up with the telegram crumpled in his hand. He\nused a most awful word! Then he said, 'It's Ann Veronica gone to join\nher sister!' 'Gone!' I said. 'Gone!' he said. 'Read that,' and threw the\ntelegram at me, so that it went into the tureen. He swore when I tried\nto get it out with the ladle, and told me what it said. Then he sat\ndown again in a chair and said that people who wrote novels ought to be\nstrung up. It was as much as I could do to prevent him flying out of the\nhouse there and then and coming after you. Never since I was a girl have\nI seen your father so moved. 'Oh! little Vee!' he cried, 'little Vee!'\nand put his face between his hands and sat still for a long time before\nhe broke out again.\"\n\nAnn Veronica had remained standing while her aunt spoke.\n\n\"Do you mean, aunt,\" she asked, \"that my father thought I had gone\noff--with some man?\"\n\n\"What else COULD he think? Would any one DREAM you would be so mad as to\ngo off alone?\"\n\n\"After--after what had happened the night before?\"\n\n\"Oh, why raise up old scores? If you could see him this morning, his\npoor face as white as a sheet and all cut about with shaving! He was\nfor coming up by the very first train and looking for you, but I said to\nhim, 'Wait for the letters,' and there, sure enough, was yours. He could\nhardly open the envelope, he trembled so. Then he threw the letter at\nme. 'Go and fetch her home,' he said; 'it isn't what we thought! It's\njust a practical joke of hers.' And with that he went off to the City,\nstern and silent, leaving his bacon on his plate--a great slice of bacon\nhardly touched. No breakfast, he's had no dinner, hardly a mouthful of\nsoup--since yesterday at tea.\"\n\nShe stopped. Aunt and niece regarded each other silently.\n\n\"You must come home to him at once,\" said Miss Stanley.\n\nAnn Veronica looked down at her fingers on the claret-colored\ntable-cloth. Her aunt had summoned up an altogether too vivid picture\nof her father as the masterful man, overbearing, emphatic, sentimental,\nnoisy, aimless. Why on earth couldn't he leave her to grow in her own\nway? Her pride rose at the bare thought of return.\n\n\"I don't think I CAN do that,\" she said. She looked up and said, a\nlittle breathlessly, \"I'm sorry, aunt, but I don't think I can.\"\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nThen it was the expostulations really began.\n\nFrom first to last, on this occasion, her aunt expostulated for about\ntwo hours. \"But, my dear,\" she began, \"it is Impossible! It is quite out\nof the Question. You simply can't.\" And to that, through vast rhetorical\nmeanderings, she clung. It reached her only slowly that Ann Veronica was\nstanding to her resolution. \"How will you live?\" she appealed. \"Think\nof what people will say!\" That became a refrain. \"Think of what Lady\nPalsworthy will say! Think of what\"--So-and-so--\"will say! What are we\nto tell people?\n\n\"Besides, what am I to tell your father?\"\n\nAt first it had not been at all clear to Ann Veronica that she would\nrefuse to return home; she had had some dream of a capitulation that\nshould leave her an enlarged and defined freedom, but as her aunt put\nthis aspect and that of her flight to her, as she wandered illogically\nand inconsistently from one urgent consideration to another, as she\nmingled assurances and aspects and emotions, it became clearer and\nclearer to the girl that there could be little or no change in the\nposition of things if she returned. \"And what will Mr. Manning think?\"\nsaid her aunt.\n\n\"I don't care what any one thinks,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I can't imagine what has come over you,\" said her aunt. \"I can't\nconceive what you want. You foolish girl!\"\n\nAnn Veronica took that in silence. At the back of her mind, dim and yet\ndisconcerting, was the perception that she herself did not know what she\nwanted. And yet she knew it was not fair to call her a foolish girl.\n\n\"Don't you care for Mr. Manning?\" said her aunt.\n\n\"I don't see what he has to do with my coming to London?\"\n\n\"He--he worships the ground you tread on. You don't deserve it, but he\ndoes. Or at least he did the day before yesterday. And here you are!\"\n\nHer aunt opened all the fingers of her gloved hand in a rhetorical\ngesture. \"It seems to me all madness--madness! Just because your\nfather--wouldn't let you disobey him!\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nIn the afternoon the task of expostulation was taken up by Mr. Stanley\nin person. Her father's ideas of expostulation were a little harsh and\nforcible, and over the claret-colored table-cloth and under the gas\nchandelier, with his hat and umbrella between them like the mace in\nParliament, he and his daughter contrived to have a violent quarrel. She\nhad intended to be quietly dignified, but he was in a smouldering rage\nfrom the beginning, and began by assuming, which alone was more than\nflesh and blood could stand, that the insurrection was over and that she\nwas coming home submissively. In his desire to be emphatic and to avenge\nhimself for his over-night distresses, he speedily became brutal, more\nbrutal than she had ever known him before.\n\n\"A nice time of anxiety you've given me, young lady,\" he said, as he\nentered the room. \"I hope you're satisfied.\"\n\nShe was frightened--his anger always did frighten her--and in her\nresolve to conceal her fright she carried a queen-like dignity to what\nshe felt even at the time was a preposterous pitch. She said she hoped\nshe had not distressed him by the course she had felt obliged to take,\nand he told her not to be a fool. She tried to keep her side up by\ndeclaring that he had put her into an impossible position, and he\nreplied by shouting, \"Nonsense! Nonsense! Any father in my place would\nhave done what I did.\"\n\nThen he went on to say: \"Well, you've had your little adventure, and I\nhope now you've had enough of it. So go up-stairs and get your things\ntogether while I look out for a hansom.\"\n\nTo which the only possible reply seemed to be, \"I'm not coming home.\"\n\n\"Not coming home!\"\n\n\"No!\" And, in spite of her resolve to be a Person, Ann Veronica began\nto weep with terror at herself. Apparently she was always doomed to weep\nwhen she talked to her father. But he was always forcing her to say and\ndo such unexpectedly conclusive things. She feared he might take her\ntears as a sign of weakness. So she said: \"I won't come home. I'd rather\nstarve!\"\n\nFor a moment the conversation hung upon that declaration. Then Mr.\nStanley, putting his hands on the table in the manner rather of a\nbarrister than a solicitor, and regarding her balefully through his\nglasses with quite undisguised animosity, asked, \"And may I presume to\ninquire, then, what you mean to do?--how do you propose to live?\"\n\n\"I shall live,\" sobbed Ann Veronica. \"You needn't be anxious about that!\nI shall contrive to live.\"\n\n\"But I AM anxious,\" said Mr. Stanley, \"I am anxious. Do you think it's\nnothing to me to have my daughter running about London looking for odd\njobs and disgracing herself?\"\n\n\"Sha'n't get odd jobs,\" said Ann Veronica, wiping her eyes.\n\nAnd from that point they went on to a thoroughly embittering wrangle.\nMr. Stanley used his authority, and commanded Ann Veronica to come home,\nto which, of course, she said she wouldn't; and then he warned her not\nto defy him, warned her very solemnly, and then commanded her again.\nHe then said that if she would not obey him in this course she should\n\"never darken his doors again,\" and was, indeed, frightfully abusive.\nThis threat terrified Ann Veronica so much that she declared with sobs\nand vehemence that she would never come home again, and for a time both\ntalked at once and very wildly. He asked her whether she understood what\nshe was saying, and went on to say still more precisely that she should\nnever touch a penny of his money until she came home again--not one\npenny. Ann Veronica said she didn't care.\n\nThen abruptly Mr. Stanley changed his key. \"You poor child!\" he said;\n\"don't you see the infinite folly of these proceedings? Think! Think of\nthe love and affection you abandon! Think of your aunt, a second mother\nto you. Think if your own mother was alive!\"\n\nHe paused, deeply moved.\n\n\"If my own mother was alive,\" sobbed Ann Veronica, \"she would\nunderstand.\"\n\nThe talk became more and more inconclusive and exhausting. Ann Veronica\nfound herself incompetent, undignified, and detestable, holding on\ndesperately to a hardening antagonism to her father, quarrelling with\nhim, wrangling with him, thinking of repartees--almost as if he was a\nbrother. It was horrible, but what could she do? She meant to live\nher own life, and he meant, with contempt and insults, to prevent her.\nAnything else that was said she now regarded only as an aspect of or\ndiversion from that.\n\nIn the retrospect she was amazed to think how things had gone to pieces,\nfor at the outset she had been quite prepared to go home again upon\nterms. While waiting for his coming she had stated her present\nand future relations with him with what had seemed to her the most\nsatisfactory lucidity and completeness. She had looked forward to an\nexplanation. Instead had come this storm, this shouting, this weeping,\nthis confusion of threats and irrelevant appeals. It was not only that\nher father had said all sorts of inconsistent and unreasonable things,\nbut that by some incomprehensible infection she herself had replied in\nthe same vein. He had assumed that her leaving home was the point at\nissue, that everything turned on that, and that the sole alternative was\nobedience, and she had fallen in with that assumption until rebellion\nseemed a sacred principle. Moreover, atrociously and inexorably, he\nallowed it to appear ever and again in horrible gleams that he suspected\nthere was some man in the case.... Some man!\n\nAnd to conclude it all was the figure of her father in the doorway,\ngiving her a last chance, his hat in one hand, his umbrella in the\nother, shaken at her to emphasize his point.\n\n\"You understand, then,\" he was saying, \"you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Ann Veronica, tear-wet and flushed with a\nreciprocal passion, but standing up to him with an equality that amazed\neven herself, \"I understand.\" She controlled a sob. \"Not a penny--not\none penny--and never darken your doors again!\"\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nThe next day her aunt came again and expostulated, and was just saying\nit was \"an unheard-of thing\" for a girl to leave her home as Ann\nVeronica had done, when her father arrived, and was shown in by the\npleasant-faced landlady.\n\nHer father had determined on a new line. He put down his hat and\numbrella, rested his hands on his hips, and regarded Ann Veronica\nfirmly.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, quietly, \"it's time we stopped this nonsense.\"\n\nAnn Veronica was about to reply, when he went on, with a still more\ndeadly quiet: \"I am not here to bandy words with you. Let us have no\nmore of this humbug. You are to come home.\"\n\n\"I thought I explained--\"\n\n\"I don't think you can have heard me,\" said her father; \"I have told you\nto come home.\"\n\n\"I thought I explained--\"\n\n\"Come home!\"\n\nAnn Veronica shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Very well,\" said her father.\n\n\"I think this ends the business,\" he said, turning to his sister.\n\n\"It's not for us to supplicate any more. She must learn wisdom--as God\npleases.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Peter!\" said Miss Stanley.\n\n\"No,\" said her brother, conclusively, \"it's not for a parent to go on\npersuading a child.\"\n\nMiss Stanley rose and regarded Ann Veronica fixedly. The girl stood with\nher hands behind her back, sulky, resolute, and intelligent, a strand\nof her black hair over one eye and looking more than usually\ndelicate-featured, and more than ever like an obdurate child.\n\n\"She doesn't know.\"\n\n\"She does.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine what makes you fly out against everything like this,\"\nsaid Miss Stanley to her niece.\n\n\"What is the good of talking?\" said her brother. \"She must go her own\nway. A man's children nowadays are not his own. That's the fact of the\nmatter. Their minds are turned against him.... Rubbishy novels and\npernicious rascals. We can't even protect them from themselves.\"\n\nAn immense gulf seemed to open between father and daughter as he said\nthese words.\n\n\"I don't see,\" gasped Ann Veronica, \"why parents and children...\nshouldn't be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends!\" said her father. \"When we see you going through disobedience\nto the devil! Come, Molly, she must go her own way. I've tried to use my\nauthority. And she defies me. What more is there to be said? She defies\nme!\"\n\nIt was extraordinary. Ann Veronica felt suddenly an effect of tremendous\npathos; she would have given anything to have been able to frame and\nmake some appeal, some utterance that should bridge this bottomless\nchasm that had opened between her and her father, and she could find\nnothing whatever to say that was in the least sincere and appealing.\n\n\"Father,\" she cried, \"I have to live!\"\n\nHe misunderstood her. \"That,\" he said, grimly, with his hand on the\ndoor-handle, \"must be your own affair, unless you choose to live at\nMorningside Park.\"\n\nMiss Stanley turned to her. \"Vee,\" she said, \"come home. Before it is\ntoo late.\"\n\n\"Come, Molly,\" said Mr. Stanley, at the door.\n\n\"Vee!\" said Miss Stanley, \"you hear what your father says!\"\n\nMiss Stanley struggled with emotion. She made a curious movement toward\nher niece, then suddenly, convulsively, she dabbed down something lumpy\non the table and turned to follow her brother. Ann Veronica stared for a\nmoment in amazement at this dark-green object that clashed as it was\nput down. It was a purse. She made a step forward. \"Aunt!\" she said, \"I\ncan't--\"\n\nThen she caught a wild appeal in her aunt's blue eye, halted, and the\ndoor clicked upon them.\n\nThere was a pause, and then the front door slammed....\n\nAnn Veronica realized that she was alone with the world. And this time\nthe departure had a tremendous effect of finality. She had to resist an\nimpulse of sheer terror, to run out after them and give in.\n\n\"Gods,\" she said, at last, \"I've done it this time!\"\n\n\"Well!\" She took up the neat morocco purse, opened it, and examined the\ncontents.\n\nIt contained three sovereigns, six and fourpence, two postage stamps, a\nsmall key, and her aunt's return half ticket to Morningside Park.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nAfter the interview Ann Veronica considered herself formally cut off\nfrom home. If nothing else had clinched that, the purse had.\n\nNevertheless there came a residuum of expostulations. Her brother Roddy,\nwho was in the motor line, came to expostulate; her sister Alice wrote.\nAnd Mr. Manning called.\n\nHer sister Alice seemed to have developed a religious sense away there\nin Yorkshire, and made appeals that had no meaning for Ann Veronica's\nmind. She exhorted Ann Veronica not to become one of \"those unsexed\nintellectuals, neither man nor woman.\"\n\nAnn Veronica meditated over that phrase. \"That's HIM,\" said Ann\nVeronica, in sound, idiomatic English. \"Poor old Alice!\"\n\nHer brother Roddy came to her and demanded tea, and asked her to state\na case. \"Bit thick on the old man, isn't it?\" said Roddy, who had\ndeveloped a bluff, straightforward style in the motor shop.\n\n\"Mind my smoking?\" said Roddy. \"I don't see quite what your game is,\nVee, but I suppose you've got a game on somewhere.\n\n\"Rummy lot we are!\" said Roddy. \"Alice--Alice gone dotty, and all over\nkids. Gwen--I saw Gwen the other day, and the paint's thicker than ever.\nJim is up to the neck in Mahatmas and Theosophy and Higher Thought and\nrot--writes letters worse than Alice. And now YOU'RE on the war-path. I\nbelieve I'm the only sane member of the family left. The G.V.'s as mad\nas any of you, in spite of all his respectability; not a bit of him\nstraight anywhere, not one bit.\"\n\n\"Straight?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it! He's been out after eight per cent. since the\nbeginning. Eight per cent.! He'll come a cropper one of these days,\nif you ask me. He's been near it once or twice already. That's got his\nnerves to rags. I suppose we're all human beings really, but what price\nthe sacred Institution of the Family! Us as a bundle! Eh?... I don't\nhalf disagree with you, Vee, really; only thing is, I don't see\nhow you're going to pull it off. A home MAY be a sort of cage, but\nstill--it's a home. Gives you a right to hang on to the old man until he\nbusts--practically. Jolly hard life for a girl, getting a living. Not MY\naffair.\"\n\nHe asked questions and listened to her views for a time.\n\n\"I'd chuck this lark right off if I were you, Vee,\" he said. \"I'm five\nyears older than you, and no end wiser, being a man. What you're after\nis too risky. It's a damned hard thing to do. It's all very handsome\nstarting out on your own, but it's too damned hard. That's my opinion,\nif you ask me. There's nothing a girl can do that isn't sweated to the\nbone. You square the G.V., and go home before you have to. That's my\nadvice. If you don't eat humble-pie now you may live to fare worse\nlater. _I_ can't help you a cent. Life's hard enough nowadays for an\nunprotected male. Let alone a girl. You got to take the world as it is,\nand the only possible trade for a girl that isn't sweated is to get hold\nof a man and make him do it for her. It's no good flying out at that,\nVee; _I_ didn't arrange it. It's Providence. That's how things are;\nthat's the order of the world. Like appendicitis. It isn't pretty, but\nwe're made so. Rot, no doubt; but we can't alter it. You go home and\nlive on the G.V., and get some other man to live on as soon as possible.\nIt isn't sentiment but it's horse sense. All this Woman-who-Diddery--no\ndamn good. After all, old P.--Providence, I mean--HAS arranged it so\nthat men will keep you, more or less. He made the universe on those\nlines. You've got to take what you can get.\"\n\nThat was the quintessence of her brother Roddy.\n\nHe played variations on this theme for the better part of an hour.\n\n\"You go home,\" he said, at parting; \"you go home. It's all very fine and\nall that, Vee, this freedom, but it isn't going to work. The world isn't\nready for girls to start out on their own yet; that's the plain fact of\nthe case. Babies and females have got to keep hold of somebody or go\nunder--anyhow, for the next few generations. You go home and wait a\ncentury, Vee, and then try again. Then you may have a bit of a chance.\nNow you haven't the ghost of one--not if you play the game fair.\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nIt was remarkable to Ann Veronica how completely Mr. Manning, in his\nentirely different dialect, indorsed her brother Roddy's view of things.\nHe came along, he said, just to call, with large, loud apologies,\nradiantly kind and good. Miss Stanley, it was manifest, had given him\nAnn Veronica's address. The kindly faced landlady had failed to catch\nhis name, and said he was a tall, handsome gentleman with a great black\nmustache. Ann Veronica, with a sigh at the cost of hospitality, made a\nhasty negotiation for an extra tea and for a fire in the ground-floor\napartment, and preened herself carefully for the interview. In the\nlittle apartment, under the gas chandelier, his inches and his stoop\nwere certainly very effective. In the bad light he looked at once\nmilitary and sentimental and studious, like one of Ouida's guardsmen\nrevised by Mr. Haldane and the London School of Economics and finished\nin the Keltic school.\n\n\"It's unforgivable of me to call, Miss Stanley,\" he said, shaking hands\nin a peculiar, high, fashionable manner; \"but you know you said we might\nbe friends.\"\n\n\"It's dreadful for you to be here,\" he said, indicating the yellow\npresence of the first fog of the year without, \"but your aunt told me\nsomething of what had happened. It's just like your Splendid Pride to do\nit. Quite!\"\n\nHe sat in the arm-chair and took tea, and consumed several of the\nextra cakes which she had sent out for and talked to her and expressed\nhimself, looking very earnestly at her with his deep-set eyes, and\ncarefully avoiding any crumbs on his mustache the while. Ann Veronica\nsat firelit by her tea-tray with, quite unconsciously, the air of an\nexpert hostess.\n\n\"But how is it all going to end?\" said Mr. Manning.\n\n\"Your father, of course,\" he said, \"must come to realize just how\nSplendid you are! He doesn't understand. I've seen him, and he doesn't\na bit understand. _I_ didn't understand before that letter. It makes me\nwant to be just everything I CAN be to you. You're like some splendid\nPrincess in Exile in these Dreadful Dingy apartments!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm anything but a Princess when it comes to earning a\nsalary,\" said Ann Veronica. \"But frankly, I mean to fight this through\nif I possibly can.\"\n\n\"My God!\" said Manning, in a stage-aside. \"Earning a salary!\"\n\n\"You're like a Princess in Exile!\" he repeated, overruling her. \"You\ncome into these sordid surroundings--you mustn't mind my calling them\nsordid--and it makes them seem as though they didn't matter.... I\ndon't think they do matter. I don't think any surroundings could throw a\nshadow on you.\"\n\nAnn Veronica felt a slight embarrassment. \"Won't you have some more tea,\nMr. Manning?\" she asked.\n\n\"You know--,\" said Mr. Manning, relinquishing his cup without answering\nher question, \"when I hear you talk of earning a living, it's as if I\nheard of an archangel going on the Stock Exchange--or Christ selling\ndoves.... Forgive my daring. I couldn't help the thought.\"\n\n\"It's a very good image,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I knew you wouldn't mind.\"\n\n\"But does it correspond with the facts of the case? You know, Mr.\nManning, all this sort of thing is very well as sentiment, but does it\ncorrespond with the realities? Are women truly such angelic things and\nmen so chivalrous? You men have, I know, meant to make us Queens and\nGoddesses, but in practice--well, look, for example, at the stream of\ngirls one meets going to work of a morning, round-shouldered, cheap, and\nunderfed! They aren't queens, and no one is treating them as queens.\nAnd look, again, at the women one finds letting lodgings.... I was\nlooking for rooms last week. It got on my nerves--the women I saw. Worse\nthan any man. Everywhere I went and rapped at a door I found behind it\nanother dreadful dingy woman--another fallen queen, I suppose--dingier\nthan the last, dirty, you know, in grain. Their poor hands!\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Manning, with entirely suitable emotion.\n\n\"And think of the ordinary wives and mothers, with their anxiety, their\nlimitations, their swarms of children!\"\n\nMr. Manning displayed distress. He fended these things off from him with\nthe rump of his fourth piece of cake. \"I know that our social order is\ndreadful enough,\" he said, \"and sacrifices all that is best and most\nbeautiful in life. I don't defend it.\"\n\n\"And besides, when it comes to the idea of queens,\" Ann Veronica went\non, \"there's twenty-one and a half million women to twenty million men.\nSuppose our proper place is a shrine. Still, that leaves over a million\nshrines short, not reckoning widows who re-marry. And more boys die than\ngirls, so that the real disproportion among adults is even greater.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr Manning, \"I know these Dreadful Statistics. I know\nthere's a sort of right in your impatience at the slowness of Progress.\nBut tell me one thing I don't understand--tell me one thing: How can you\nhelp it by coming down into the battle and the mire? That's the thing\nthat concerns me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not trying to help it,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I'm only arguing\nagainst your position of what a woman should be, and trying to get\nit clear in my own mind. I'm in this apartment and looking for work\nbecause--Well, what else can I do, when my father practically locks me\nup?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Manning, \"I know. Don't think I can't sympathize and\nunderstand. Still, here we are in this dingy, foggy city. Ye gods! what\na wilderness it is! Every one trying to get the better of every one,\nevery one regardless of every one--it's one of those days when every one\nbumps against you--every one pouring coal smoke into the air and making\nconfusion worse confounded, motor omnibuses clattering and smelling,\na horse down in the Tottenham Court Road, an old woman at the corner\ncoughing dreadfully--all the painful sights of a great city, and here\nyou come into it to take your chances. It's too valiant, Miss Stanley,\ntoo valiant altogether!\"\n\nAnn Veronica meditated. She had had two days of employment-seeking now.\n\"I wonder if it is.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" said Mr. Manning, \"that I mind Courage in a Woman--I love\nand admire Courage. What could be more splendid than a beautiful girl\nfacing a great, glorious tiger? Una and the Lion again, and all that!\nBut this isn't that sort of thing; this is just a great, ugly, endless\nwilderness of selfish, sweating, vulgar competition!\"\n\n\"That you want to keep me out of?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Mr. Manning.\n\n\"In a sort of beautiful garden-close--wearing lovely dresses and picking\nbeautiful flowers?\"\n\n\"Ah! If one could!\"\n\n\"While those other girls trudge to business and those other women let\nlodgings. And in reality even that magic garden-close resolves itself\ninto a villa at Morningside Park and my father being more and more\ncross and overbearing at meals--and a general feeling of insecurity and\nfutility.\"\n\nMr. Manning relinquished his cup, and looked meaningly at Ann Veronica.\n\"There,\" he said, \"you don't treat me fairly, Miss Stanley. My\ngarden-close would be a better thing than that.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH\n\nIDEALS AND A REALITY\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nAnd now for some weeks Ann Veronica was to test her market value in the\nworld. She went about in a negligent November London that had become\nvery dark and foggy and greasy and forbidding indeed, and tried to find\nthat modest but independent employment she had so rashly assumed. She\nwent about, intent-looking and self-possessed, trim and fine, concealing\nher emotions whatever they were, as the realities of her position opened\nout before her. Her little bed-sitting-room was like a lair, and she\nwent out from it into this vast, dun world, with its smoke-gray houses,\nits glaring streets of shops, its dark streets of homes, its orange-lit\nwindows, under skies of dull copper or muddy gray or black, much as an\nanimal goes out to seek food. She would come back and write letters,\ncarefully planned and written letters, or read some book she had fetched\nfrom Mudie's--she had invested a half-guinea with Mudie's--or sit over\nher fire and think.\n\nSlowly and reluctantly she came to realize that Vivie Warren was what\nis called an \"ideal.\" There were no such girls and no such positions. No\nwork that offered was at all of the quality she had vaguely postulated\nfor herself. With such qualifications as she possessed, two chief\nchannels of employment lay open, and neither attracted her, neither\nseemed really to offer a conclusive escape from that subjection to\nmankind against which, in the person of her father, she was rebelling.\nOne main avenue was for her to become a sort of salaried accessory wife\nor mother, to be a governess or an assistant schoolmistress, or a very\nhigh type of governess-nurse. The other was to go into business--into a\nphotographer's reception-room, for example, or a costumer's or hat-shop.\nThe first set of occupations seemed to her to be altogether too domestic\nand restricted; for the latter she was dreadfully handicapped by her\nwant of experience. And also she didn't like them. She didn't like the\nshops, she didn't like the other women's faces; she thought the\nsmirking men in frock-coats who dominated these establishments the\nmost intolerable persons she had ever had to face. One called her very\ndistinctly \"My dear!\"\n\nTwo secretarial posts did indeed seem to offer themselves in which, at\nleast, there was no specific exclusion of womanhood; one was under\na Radical Member of Parliament, and the other under a Harley Street\ndoctor, and both men declined her proffered services with the utmost\ncivility and admiration and terror. There was also a curious interview\nat a big hotel with a middle-aged, white-powdered woman, all covered\nwith jewels and reeking of scent, who wanted a Companion. She did not\nthink Ann Veronica would do as her companion.\n\nAnd nearly all these things were fearfully ill-paid. They carried no\nmore than bare subsistence wages; and they demanded all her time and\nenergy. She had heard of women journalists, women writers, and so\nforth; but she was not even admitted to the presence of the editors she\ndemanded to see, and by no means sure that if she had been she could\nhave done any work they might have given her. One day she desisted from\nher search and went unexpectedly to the Tredgold College. Her place\nwas not filled; she had been simply noted as absent, and she did a\ncomforting day of admirable dissection upon the tortoise. She was so\ninterested, and this was such a relief from the trudging anxiety of her\nsearch for work, that she went on for a whole week as if she was still\nliving at home. Then a third secretarial opening occurred and renewed\nher hopes again: a position as amanuensis--with which some of the\nlighter duties of a nurse were combined--to an infirm gentleman of means\nliving at Twickenham, and engaged upon a great literary research to\nprove that the \"Faery Queen\" was really a treatise upon molecular\nchemistry written in a peculiar and picturesquely handled cipher.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nNow, while Ann Veronica was taking these soundings in the industrial\nsea, and measuring herself against the world as it is, she was also\nmaking extensive explorations among the ideas and attitudes of a number\nof human beings who seemed to be largely concerned with the world as it\nought to be. She was drawn first by Miss Miniver, and then by her own\nnatural interest, into a curious stratum of people who are busied with\ndreams of world progress, of great and fundamental changes, of a New Age\nthat is to replace all the stresses and disorders of contemporary life.\n\nMiss Miniver learned of her flight and got her address from the\nWidgetts. She arrived about nine o'clock the next evening in a state of\ntremulous enthusiasm. She followed the landlady half way up-stairs, and\ncalled up to Ann Veronica, \"May I come up? It's me! You know--Nettie\nMiniver!\" She appeared before Ann Veronica could clearly recall who\nNettie Miniver might be.\n\nThere was a wild light in her eye, and her straight hair was out\ndemonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of its\nown. Her fingers were bursting through her gloves, as if to get at once\ninto touch with Ann Veronica. \"You're Glorious!\" said Miss Miniver in\ntones of rapture, holding a hand in each of hers and peering up into Ann\nVeronica's face. \"Glorious! You're so calm, dear, and so resolute, so\nserene!\n\n\"It's girls like you who will show them what We are,\" said Miss Miniver;\n\"girls whose spirits have not been broken!\"\n\nAnn Veronica sunned herself a little in this warmth.\n\n\"I was watching you at Morningside Park, dear,\" said Miss Miniver. \"I am\ngetting to watch all women. I thought then perhaps you didn't care, that\nyou were like so many of them. NOW it's just as though you had grown up\nsuddenly.\"\n\nShe stopped, and then suggested: \"I wonder--I should love--if it was\nanything _I_ said.\"\n\nShe did not wait for Ann Veronica's reply. She seemed to assume that it\nmust certainly be something she had said. \"They all catch on,\" she said.\n\"It spreads like wildfire. This is such a grand time! Such a glorious\ntime! There never was such a time as this! Everything seems so close to\nfruition, so coming on and leading on! The Insurrection of Women! They\nspring up everywhere. Tell me all that happened, one sister-woman to\nanother.\"\n\nShe chilled Ann Veronica a little by that last phrase, and yet the\nmagnetism of her fellowship and enthusiasm was very strong; and it was\npleasant to be made out a heroine after so much expostulation and so\nmany secret doubts.\n\nBut she did not listen long; she wanted to talk. She sat, crouched\ntogether, by the corner of the hearthrug under the bookcase that\nsupported the pig's skull, and looked into the fire and up at Ann\nVeronica's face, and let herself go. \"Let us put the lamp out,\" she\nsaid; \"the flames are ever so much better for talking,\" and Ann Veronica\nagreed. \"You are coming right out into life--facing it all.\"\n\nAnn Veronica sat with her chin on her hand, red-lit and saying little,\nand Miss Miniver discoursed. As she talked, the drift and significance\nof what she was saying shaped itself slowly to Ann Veronica's\napprehension. It presented itself in the likeness of a great, gray, dull\nworld--a brutal, superstitious, confused, and wrong-headed world,\nthat hurt people and limited people unaccountably. In remote times and\ncountries its evil tendencies had expressed themselves in the form of\ntyrannies, massacres, wars, and what not; but just at present in England\nthey shaped as commercialism and competition, silk hats, suburban\nmorals, the sweating system, and the subjection of women. So far the\nthing was acceptable enough. But over against the world Miss Miniver\nassembled a small but energetic minority, the Children of Light--people\nshe described as \"being in the van,\" or \"altogether in the van,\" about\nwhom Ann Veronica's mind was disposed to be more sceptical.\n\nEverything, Miss Miniver said, was \"working up,\" everything was \"coming\non\"--the Higher Thought, the Simple Life, Socialism, Humanitarianism, it\nwas all the same really. She loved to be there, taking part in it all,\nbreathing it, being it. Hitherto in the world's history there had been\nprecursors of this Progress at great intervals, voices that had spoken\nand ceased, but now it was all coming on together in a rush. She\nmentioned, with familiar respect, Christ and Buddha and Shelley and\nNietzsche and Plato. Pioneers all of them. Such names shone brightly in\nthe darkness, with black spaces of unilluminated emptiness about them,\nas stars shine in the night; but now--now it was different; now it was\ndawn--the real dawn.\n\n\"The women are taking it up,\" said Miss Miniver; \"the women and the\ncommon people, all pressing forward, all roused.\"\n\nAnn Veronica listened with her eyes on the fire.\n\n\"Everybody is taking it up,\" said Miss Miniver. \"YOU had to come in. You\ncouldn't help it. Something drew you. Something draws everybody. From\nsuburbs, from country towns--everywhere. I see all the Movements. As\nfar as I can, I belong to them all. I keep my finger on the pulse of\nthings.\"\n\nAnn Veronica said nothing.\n\n\"The dawn!\" said Miss Miniver, with her glasses reflecting the fire like\npools of blood-red flame.\n\n\"I came to London,\" said Ann Veronica, \"rather because of my own\ndifficulty. I don't know that I understand altogether.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't,\" said Miss Miniver, gesticulating triumphantly\nwith her thin hand and thinner wrist, and patting Ann Veronica's knee.\n\"Of course you don't. That's the wonder of it. But you will, you\nwill. You must let me take you to things--to meetings and things, to\nconferences and talks. Then you will begin to see. You will begin to see\nit all opening out. I am up to the ears in it all--every moment I can\nspare. I throw up work--everything! I just teach in one school, one good\nschool, three days a week. All the rest--Movements! I can live now on\nfourpence a day. Think how free that leaves me to follow things up! I\nmust take you everywhere. I must take you to the Suffrage people, and\nthe Tolstoyans, and the Fabians.\"\n\n\"I have heard of the Fabians,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"It's THE Society!\" said Miss Miniver. \"It's the centre of the\nintellectuals. Some of the meetings are wonderful! Such earnest,\nbeautiful women! Such deep-browed men!... And to think that there\nthey are making history! There they are putting together the plans of a\nnew world. Almost light-heartedly. There is Shaw, and Webb, and Wilkins\nthe author, and Toomer, and Doctor Tumpany--the most wonderful people!\nThere you see them discussing, deciding, planning! Just think--THEY ARE\nMAKING A NEW WORLD!\"\n\n\"But ARE these people going to alter everything?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"What else can happen?\" asked Miss Miniver, with a little weak gesture\nat the glow. \"What else can possibly happen--as things are going now?\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nMiss Miniver let Ann Veronica into her peculiar levels of the world\nwith so enthusiastic a generosity that it seemed ingratitude to remain\ncritical. Indeed, almost insensibly Ann Veronica became habituated to\nthe peculiar appearance and the peculiar manners of the people \"in the\nvan.\" The shock of their intellectual attitude was over, usage robbed\nit of the first quaint effect of deliberate unreason. They were in many\nrespects so right; she clung to that, and shirked more and more the\nparadoxical conviction that they were also somehow, and even in direct\nrelation to that rightness, absurd.\n\nVery central in Miss Miniver's universe were the Goopes. The Goopes were\nthe oddest little couple conceivable, following a fruitarian career upon\nan upper floor in Theobald's Road. They were childless and servantless,\nand they had reduced simple living to the finest of fine arts. Mr.\nGoopes, Ann Veronica gathered, was a mathematical tutor and visited\nschools, and his wife wrote a weekly column in New Ideas upon vegetarian\ncookery, vivisection, degeneration, the lacteal secretion, appendicitis,\nand the Higher Thought generally, and assisted in the management of\na fruit shop in the Tottenham Court Road. Their very furniture had\nmysteriously a high-browed quality, and Mr. Goopes when at home dressed\nsimply in a pajama-shaped suit of canvas sacking tied with brown\nribbons, while his wife wore a purple djibbah with a richly\nembroidered yoke. He was a small, dark, reserved man, with a large\ninflexible-looking convex forehead, and his wife was very pink and\nhigh-spirited, with one of those chins that pass insensibly into a full,\nstrong neck. Once a week, every Saturday, they had a little gathering\nfrom nine till the small hours, just talk and perhaps reading aloud and\nfruitarian refreshments--chestnut sandwiches buttered with nut tose,\nand so forth--and lemonade and unfermented wine; and to one of these\nsymposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary solicitude,\nconducted Ann Veronica.\n\nShe was introduced, perhaps a little too obviously for her taste, as\na girl who was standing out against her people, to a gathering that\nconsisted of a very old lady with an extremely wrinkled skin and a deep\nvoice who was wearing what appeared to Ann Veronica's inexperienced\neye to be an antimacassar upon her head, a shy, blond young man with a\nnarrow forehead and glasses, two undistinguished women in plain skirts\nand blouses, and a middle-aged couple, very fat and alike in black, Mr.\nand Mrs. Alderman Dunstable, of the Borough Council of Marylebone.\nThese were seated in an imperfect semicircle about a very copper-adorned\nfireplace, surmounted by a carved wood inscription:\n\n\"DO IT NOW.\"\n\nAnd to them were presently added a roguish-looking young man, with\nreddish hair, an orange tie, and a fluffy tweed suit, and others who,\nin Ann Veronica's memory, in spite of her efforts to recall details,\nremained obstinately just \"others.\"\n\nThe talk was animated, and remained always brilliant in form even when\nit ceased to be brilliant in substance. There were moments when Ann\nVeronica rather more than suspected the chief speakers to be, as\nschool-boys say, showing off at her.\n\nThey talked of a new substitute for dripping in vegetarian cookery that\nMrs. Goopes was convinced exercised an exceptionally purifying influence\non the mind. And then they talked of Anarchism and Socialism, and\nwhether the former was the exact opposite of the latter or only a higher\nform. The reddish-haired young man contributed allusions to the Hegelian\nphilosophy that momentarily confused the discussion. Then Alderman\nDunstable, who had hitherto been silent, broke out into speech and went\noff at a tangent, and gave his personal impressions of quite a number\nof his fellow-councillors. He continued to do this for the rest of the\nevening intermittently, in and out, among other topics. He addressed\nhimself chiefly to Goopes, and spoke as if in reply to long-sustained\ninquiries on the part of Goopes into the personnel of the Marylebone\nBorough Council. \"If you were to ask me,\" he would say, \"I should say\nBlinders is straight. An ordinary type, of course--\"\n\nMrs. Dunstable's contributions to the conversation were entirely in the\nform of nods; whenever Alderman Dunstable praised or blamed she nodded\ntwice or thrice, according to the requirements of his emphasis. And\nshe seemed always to keep one eye on Ann Veronica's dress. Mrs.\nGoopes disconcerted the Alderman a little by abruptly challenging the\nroguish-looking young man in the orange tie (who, it seemed, was the\nassistant editor of New Ideas) upon a critique of Nietzsche and Tolstoy\nthat had appeared in his paper, in which doubts had been cast upon the\nperfect sincerity of the latter. Everybody seemed greatly concerned\nabout the sincerity of Tolstoy.\n\nMiss Miniver said that if once she lost her faith in Tolstoy's\nsincerity, nothing she felt would really matter much any more, and she\nappealed to Ann Veronica whether she did not feel the same; and Mr.\nGoopes said that we must distinguish between sincerity and irony, which\nwas often indeed no more than sincerity at the sublimated level.\n\nAlderman Dunstable said that sincerity was often a matter of\nopportunity, and illustrated the point to the fair young man with an\nanecdote about Blinders on the Dust Destructor Committee, during which\nthe young man in the orange tie succeeded in giving the whole discussion\na daring and erotic flavor by questioning whether any one could be\nperfectly sincere in love.\n\nMiss Miniver thought that there was no true sincerity except in love,\nand appealed to Ann Veronica, but the young man in the orange tie went\non to declare that it was quite possible to be sincerely in love with\ntwo people at the same time, although perhaps on different planes with\neach individual, and deceiving them both. But that brought Mrs. Goopes\ndown on him with the lesson Titian teaches so beautifully in his \"Sacred\nand Profane Love,\" and became quite eloquent upon the impossibility of\nany deception in the former.\n\nThen they discoursed on love for a time, and Alderman Dunstable, turning\nback to the shy, blond young man and speaking in undertones of the\nutmost clearness, gave a brief and confidential account of an unfounded\nrumor of the bifurcation of the affections of Blinders that had led to a\nsituation of some unpleasantness upon the Borough Council.\n\nThe very old lady in the antimacassar touched Ann Veronica's arm\nsuddenly, and said, in a deep, arch voice:\n\n\"Talking of love again; spring again, love again. Oh! you young people!\"\n\nThe young man with the orange tie, in spite of Sisyphus-like efforts\non the part of Goopes to get the topic on to a higher plane, displayed\ngreat persistence in speculating upon the possible distribution of the\naffections of highly developed modern types.\n\nThe old lady in the antimacassar said, abruptly, \"Ah! you young people,\nyou young people, if you only knew!\" and then laughed and then mused in\na marked manner; and the young man with the narrow forehead and glasses\ncleared his throat and asked the young man in the orange tie whether he\nbelieved that Platonic love was possible. Mrs. Goopes said she believed\nin nothing else, and with that she glanced at Ann Veronica, rose a\nlittle abruptly, and directed Goopes and the shy young man in the\nhanding of refreshments.\n\nBut the young man with the orange tie remained in his place, disputing\nwhether the body had not something or other which he called its\nlegitimate claims. And from that they came back by way of the Kreutzer\nSonata and Resurrection to Tolstoy again.\n\nSo the talk went on. Goopes, who had at first been a little reserved,\nresorted presently to the Socratic method to restrain the young man with\nthe orange tie, and bent his forehead over him, and brought out at last\nvery clearly from him that the body was only illusion and everything\nnothing but just spirit and molecules of thought. It became a sort of\nduel at last between them, and all the others sat and listened--every\none, that is, except the Alderman, who had got the blond young man into\na corner by the green-stained dresser with the aluminum things, and was\nsitting with his back to every one else, holding one hand over his mouth\nfor greater privacy, and telling him, with an accent of confidential\nadmission, in whispers of the chronic struggle between the natural\nmodesty and general inoffensiveness of the Borough Council and the\nsocial evil in Marylebone.\n\nSo the talk went on, and presently they were criticising novelists, and\ncertain daring essays of Wilkins got their due share of attention,\nand then they were discussing the future of the theatre. Ann Veronica\nintervened a little in the novelist discussion with a defence of Esmond\nand a denial that the Egoist was obscure, and when she spoke every one\nelse stopped talking and listened. Then they deliberated whether Bernard\nShaw ought to go into Parliament. And that brought them to vegetarianism\nand teetotalism, and the young man in the orange tie and Mrs. Goopes\nhad a great set-to about the sincerity of Chesterton and Belloc that was\nended by Goopes showing signs of resuming the Socratic method.\n\nAnd at last Ann Veronica and Miss Miniver came down the dark staircase\nand out into the foggy spaces of the London squares, and crossed Russell\nSquare, Woburn Square, Gordon Square, making an oblique route to Ann\nVeronica's lodging. They trudged along a little hungry, because of the\nfruitarian refreshments, and mentally very active. And Miss Miniver fell\ndiscussing whether Goopes or Bernard Shaw or Tolstoy or Doctor Tumpany\nor Wilkins the author had the more powerful and perfect mind in\nexistence at the present time. She was clear there were no other minds\nlike them in all the world.\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nThen one evening Ann Veronica went with Miss Miniver into the back seats\nof the gallery at Essex Hall, and heard and saw the giant leaders of the\nFabian Society who are re-making the world: Bernard Shaw and Toomer and\nDoctor Tumpany and Wilkins the author, all displayed upon a platform.\nThe place was crowded, and the people about her were almost equally\nmade up of very good-looking and enthusiastic young people and a great\nvariety of Goopes-like types. In the discussion there was the oddest\nmixture of things that were personal and petty with an idealist devotion\nthat was fine beyond dispute. In nearly every speech she heard was the\nsame implication of great and necessary changes in the world--changes\nto be won by effort and sacrifice indeed, but surely to be won. And\nafterward she saw a very much larger and more enthusiastic gathering,\na meeting of the advanced section of the woman movement in Caxton Hall,\nwhere the same note of vast changes in progress sounded; and she went\nto a soiree of the Dress Reform Association and visited a Food Reform\nExhibition, where imminent change was made even alarmingly visible.\nThe women's meeting was much more charged with emotional force than the\nSocialists'. Ann Veronica was carried off her intellectual and critical\nfeet by it altogether, and applauded and uttered cries that subsequent\nreflection failed to endorse. \"I knew you would feel it,\" said Miss\nMiniver, as they came away flushed and heated. \"I knew you would begin\nto see how it all falls into place together.\"\n\nIt did begin to fall into place together. She became more and more\nalive, not so much to a system of ideas as to a big diffused\nimpulse toward change, to a great discontent with and criticism of\nlife as it is lived, to a clamorous confusion of ideas for\nreconstruction--reconstruction of the methods of business, of economic\ndevelopment, of the rules of property, of the status of children, of the\nclothing and feeding and teaching of every one; she developed a quite\nexaggerated consciousness of a multitude of people going about the\nswarming spaces of London with their minds full, their talk and gestures\nfull, their very clothing charged with the suggestion of the urgency of\nthis pervasive project of alteration. Some indeed carried themselves,\ndressed themselves even, rather as foreign visitors from the land\nof \"Looking Backward\" and \"News from Nowhere\" than as the indigenous\nLondoners they were. For the most part these were detached people: men\npractising the plastic arts, young writers, young men in employment, a\nvery large proportion of girls and women--self-supporting women or girls\nof the student class. They made a stratum into which Ann Veronica was\nnow plunged up to her neck; it had become her stratum.\n\nNone of the things they said and did were altogether new to Ann\nVeronica, but now she got them massed and alive, instead of by glimpses\nor in books--alive and articulate and insistent. The London backgrounds,\nin Bloomsbury and Marylebone, against which these people went to\nand fro, took on, by reason of their gray facades, their implacably\nrespectable windows and window-blinds, their reiterated unmeaning iron\nrailings, a stronger and stronger suggestion of the flavor of her father\nat his most obdurate phase, and of all that she felt herself fighting\nagainst.\n\nShe was already a little prepared by her discursive reading and\ndiscussion under the Widgett influence for ideas and \"movements,\" though\ntemperamentally perhaps she was rather disposed to resist and criticise\nthan embrace them. But the people among whom she was now thrown through\nthe social exertions of Miss Miniver and the Widgetts--for Teddy and\nHetty came up from Morningside Park and took her to an eighteen-penny\ndinner in Soho and introduced her to some art students, who were also\nSocialists, and so opened the way to an evening of meandering talk in a\nstudio--carried with them like an atmosphere this implication, not only\nthat the world was in some stupid and even obvious way WRONG, with which\nindeed she was quite prepared to agree, but that it needed only a\nfew pioneers to behave as such and be thoroughly and indiscriminately\n\"advanced,\" for the new order to achieve itself.\n\nWhen ninety per cent. out of the ten or twelve people one meets in a\nmonth not only say but feel and assume a thing, it is very hard not\nto fall into the belief that the thing is so. Imperceptibly almost Ann\nVeronica began to acquire the new attitude, even while her mind still\nresisted the felted ideas that went with it. And Miss Miniver began to\nsway her.\n\nThe very facts that Miss Miniver never stated an argument clearly, that\nshe was never embarrassed by a sense of self-contradiction, and had\nlittle more respect for consistency of statement than a washerwoman\nhas for wisps of vapor, which made Ann Veronica critical and hostile at\ntheir first encounter in Morningside Park, became at last with constant\nassociation the secret of Miss Miniver's growing influence. The brain\ntires of resistance, and when it meets again and again, incoherently\nactive, the same phrases, the same ideas that it has already slain,\nexposed and dissected and buried, it becomes less and less energetic to\nrepeat the operation. There must be something, one feels, in ideas that\nachieve persistently a successful resurrection. What Miss Miniver would\nhave called the Higher Truth supervenes.\n\nYet through these talks, these meetings and conferences, these movements\nand efforts, Ann Veronica, for all that she went with her friend, and\nat times applauded with her enthusiastically, yet went nevertheless with\neyes that grew more and more puzzled, and fine eyebrows more and more\ndisposed to knit. She was with these movements--akin to them, she felt\nit at times intensely--and yet something eluded her. Morningside Park\nhad been passive and defective; all this rushed about and was active,\nbut it was still defective. It still failed in something. It did seem\ngermane to the matter that so many of the people \"in the van\" were plain\npeople, or faded people, or tired-looking people. It did affect the\nbusiness that they all argued badly and were egotistical in their\nmanners and inconsistent in their phrases. There were moments when she\ndoubted whether the whole mass of movements and societies and gatherings\nand talks was not simply one coherent spectacle of failure protecting\nitself from abjection by the glamour of its own assertions. It happened\nthat at the extremest point of Ann Veronica's social circle from the\nWidgetts was the family of the Morningside Park horse-dealer, a company\nof extremely dressy and hilarious young women, with one equestrian\nbrother addicted to fancy waistcoats, cigars, and facial spots. These\ngirls wore hats at remarkable angles and bows to startle and kill; they\nliked to be right on the spot every time and up to everything that\nwas it from the very beginning and they rendered their conception of\nSocialists and all reformers by the words \"positively frightening\"\nand \"weird.\" Well, it was beyond dispute that these words did convey\na certain quality of the Movements in general amid which Miss Miniver\ndisported herself. They WERE weird. And yet for all that--\n\nIt got into Ann Veronica's nights at last and kept her awake, the\nperplexing contrast between the advanced thought and the advanced\nthinker. The general propositions of Socialism, for example, struck her\nas admirable, but she certainly did not extend her admiration to any\nof its exponents. She was still more stirred by the idea of the equal\ncitizenship of men and women, by the realization that a big and growing\norganization of women were giving form and a generalized expression\nto just that personal pride, that aspiration for personal freedom and\nrespect which had brought her to London; but when she heard Miss Miniver\ndiscoursing on the next step in the suffrage campaign, or read of women\nbadgering Cabinet Ministers, padlocked to railings, or getting up in a\npublic meeting to pipe out a demand for votes and be carried out kicking\nand screaming, her soul revolted. She could not part with dignity.\nSomething as yet unformulated within her kept her estranged from all\nthese practical aspects of her beliefs.\n\n\"Not for these things, O Ann Veronica, have you revolted,\" it said; \"and\nthis is not your appropriate purpose.\"\n\nIt was as if she faced a darkness in which was something very beautiful\nand wonderful as yet unimagined. The little pucker in her brows became\nmore perceptible.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nIn the beginning of December Ann Veronica began to speculate privately\nupon the procedure of pawning. She had decided that she would begin\nwith her pearl necklace. She spent a very disagreeable afternoon and\nevening--it was raining fast outside, and she had very unwisely left\nher soundest pair of boots in the boothole of her father's house in\nMorningside Park--thinking over the economic situation and planning a\ncourse of action. Her aunt had secretly sent on to Ann Veronica some new\nwarm underclothing, a dozen pairs of stockings, and her last winter's\njacket, but the dear lady had overlooked those boots.\n\nThese things illuminated her situation extremely. Finally she decided\nupon a step that had always seemed reasonable to her, but that hitherto\nshe had, from motives too faint for her to formulate, refrained from\ntaking. She resolved to go into the City to Ramage and ask for his\nadvice. And next morning she attired herself with especial care and\nneatness, found his address in the Directory at a post-office, and went\nto him.\n\nShe had to wait some minutes in an outer office, wherein three young\nmen of spirited costume and appearance regarded her with ill-concealed\ncuriosity and admiration. Then Ramage appeared with effusion, and\nushered her into his inner apartment. The three young men exchanged\nexpressive glances.\n\nThe inner apartment was rather gracefully furnished with a thick, fine\nTurkish carpet, a good brass fender, a fine old bureau, and on the walls\nwere engravings of two young girls' heads by Greuze, and of some modern\npicture of boys bathing in a sunlit pool.\n\n\"But this is a surprise!\" said Ramage. \"This is wonderful! I've been\nfeeling that you had vanished from my world. Have you been away from\nMorningside Park?\"\n\n\"I'm not interrupting you?\"\n\n\"You are. Splendidly. Business exists for such interruptions. There you\nare, the best client's chair.\"\n\nAnn Veronica sat down, and Ramage's eager eyes feasted on her.\n\n\"I've been looking out for you,\" he said. \"I confess it.\"\n\nShe had not, she reflected, remembered how prominent his eyes were.\n\n\"I want some advice,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You remember once, how we talked--at a gate on the Downs? We talked\nabout how a girl might get an independent living.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, something has happened at home.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Nothing has happened to Mr. Stanley?\"\n\n\"I've fallen out with my father. It was about--a question of what I\nmight do or might not do. He--In fact, he--he locked me in my room.\nPractically.\"\n\nHer breath left her for a moment.\n\n\"I SAY!\" said Mr. Ramage.\n\n\"I wanted to go to an art-student ball of which he disapproved.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I felt that sort of thing couldn't go on. So I packed up and came to\nLondon next day.\"\n\n\"To a friend?\"\n\n\"To lodgings--alone.\"\n\n\"I say, you know, you have some pluck. You did it on your own?\"\n\nAnn Veronica smiled. \"Quite on my own,\" she said.\n\n\"It's magnificent!\" He leaned back and regarded her with his head a\nlittle on one side. \"By Jove!\" he said, \"there is something direct about\nyou. I wonder if I should have locked you up if I'd been your father.\nLuckily I'm not. And you started out forthwith to fight the world and be\na citizen on your own basis?\" He came forward again and folded his hands\nunder him on his desk.\n\n\"How has the world taken it?\" he asked. \"If I was the world I think I\nshould have put down a crimson carpet, and asked you to say what you\nwanted, and generally walk over me. But the world didn't do that.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"It presented a large impenetrable back, and went on thinking about\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"It offered from fifteen to two-and-twenty shillings a week--for\ndrudgery.\"\n\n\"The world has no sense of what is due to youth and courage. It never\nhas had.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica. \"But the thing is, I want a job.\"\n\n\"Exactly! And so you came along to me. And you see, I don't turn my\nback, and I am looking at you and thinking about you from top to toe.\"\n\n\"And what do you think I ought to do?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" He lifted a paper-weight and dabbed it gently down again.\n\"What ought you to do?\"\n\n\"I've hunted up all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"The point to note is that fundamentally you don't want particularly to\ndo it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"You want to be free and so forth, yes. But you don't particularly\nwant to do the job that sets you free--for its own sake. I mean that it\ndoesn't interest you in itself.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"That's one of our differences. We men are like children. We can get\nabsorbed in play, in games, in the business we do. That's really why\nwe do them sometimes rather well and get on. But women--women as a rule\ndon't throw themselves into things like that. As a matter of fact it\nisn't their affair. And as a natural consequence, they don't do so well,\nand they don't get on--and so the world doesn't pay them. They don't\ncatch on to discursive interests, you see, because they are more\nserious, they are concentrated on the central reality of life, and a\nlittle impatient of its--its outer aspects. At least that, I think, is\nwhat makes a clever woman's independent career so much more difficult\nthan a clever man's.\"\n\n\"She doesn't develop a specialty.\" Ann Veronica was doing her best to\nfollow him.\n\n\"She has one, that's why. Her specialty is the central thing in life, it\nis life itself, the warmth of life, sex--and love.\"\n\nHe pronounced this with an air of profound conviction and with his\neyes on Ann Veronica's face. He had an air of having told her a deep,\npersonal secret. She winced as he thrust the fact at her, was about to\nanswer, and checked herself. She colored faintly.\n\n\"That doesn't touch the question I asked you,\" she said. \"It may be\ntrue, but it isn't quite what I have in mind.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Ramage, as one who rouses himself from deep\npreoccupations And he began to question her in a business-like way upon\nthe steps she had taken and the inquiries she had made. He displayed\nnone of the airy optimism of their previous talk over the downland gate.\nHe was helpful, but gravely dubious. \"You see,\" he said, \"from my point\nof view you're grown up--you're as old as all the goddesses and the\ncontemporary of any man alive. But from the--the economic point of view\nyou're a very young and altogether inexperienced person.\"\n\nHe returned to and developed that idea. \"You're still,\" he said, \"in the\neducational years. From the point of view of most things in the world\nof employment which a woman can do reasonably well and earn a living\nby, you're unripe and half-educated. If you had taken your degree, for\nexample.\"\n\nHe spoke of secretarial work, but even there she would need to be able\nto do typing and shorthand. He made it more and more evident to her that\nher proper course was not to earn a salary but to accumulate equipment.\n\"You see,\" he said, \"you are like an inaccessible gold-mine in all this\nsort of matter. You're splendid stuff, you know, but you've got nothing\nready to sell. That's the flat business situation.\"\n\nHe thought. Then he slapped his hand on his desk and looked up with\nthe air of a man struck by a brilliant idea. \"Look here,\" he said,\nprotruding his eyes; \"why get anything to do at all just yet? Why, if\nyou must be free, why not do the sensible thing? Make yourself worth\na decent freedom. Go on with your studies at the Imperial College,\nfor example, get a degree, and make yourself good value. Or become a\nthorough-going typist and stenographer and secretarial expert.\"\n\n\"But I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You see, if I do go home my father objects to the College, and as for\ntyping--\"\n\n\"Don't go home.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you forget; how am I to live?\"\n\n\"Easily. Easily.... Borrow.... From me.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that,\" said Ann Veronica, sharply.\n\n\"I see no reason why you shouldn't.\"\n\n\"It's impossible.\"\n\n\"As one friend to another. Men are always doing it, and if you set up to\nbe a man--\"\n\n\"No, it's absolutely out of the question, Mr. Ramage.\" And Ann\nVeronica's face was hot.\n\nRamage pursed his rather loose lips and shrugged his shoulders, with\nhis eyes fixed steadily upon her. \"Well anyhow--I don't see the force of\nyour objection, you know. That's my advice to you. Here I am. Consider\nyou've got resources deposited with me. Perhaps at the first blush--it\nstrikes you as odd. People are brought up to be so shy about money. As\nthough it was indelicate--it's just a sort of shyness. But here I am to\ndraw upon. Here I am as an alternative either to nasty work--or going\nhome.\"\n\n\"It's very kind of you--\" began Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Not a bit. Just a friendly polite suggestion. I don't suggest any\nphilanthropy. I shall charge you five per cent., you know, fair and\nsquare.\"\n\nAnn Veronica opened her lips quickly and did not speak. But the five per\ncent. certainly did seem to improve the aspect of Ramage's suggestion.\n\n\"Well, anyhow, consider it open.\" He dabbed with his paper-weight again,\nand spoke in an entirely indifferent tone. \"And now tell me, please, how\nyou eloped from Morningside Park. How did you get your luggage out of\nthe house? Wasn't it--wasn't it rather in some respects--rather a lark?\nIt's one of my regrets for my lost youth. I never ran away from anywhere\nwith anybody anywhen. And now--I suppose I should be considered too\nold. I don't feel it.... Didn't you feel rather EVENTFUL--in the\ntrain--coming up to Waterloo?\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nBefore Christmas Ann Veronica had gone to Ramage again and accepted this\noffer she had at first declined.\n\nMany little things had contributed to that decision. The chief influence\nwas her awakening sense of the need of money. She had been forced to buy\nherself that pair of boots and a walking-skirt, and the pearl necklace\nat the pawnbrokers' had yielded very disappointingly. And, also, she\nwanted to borrow that money. It did seem in so many ways exactly what\nRamage said it was--the sensible thing to do. There it was--to be\nborrowed. It would put the whole adventure on a broader and better\nfooting; it seemed, indeed, almost the only possible way in which she\nmight emerge from her rebellion with anything like success. If only for\nthe sake of her argument with her home, she wanted success. And why,\nafter all, should she not borrow money from Ramage?\n\nIt was so true what he said; middle-class people WERE ridiculously\nsqueamish about money. Why should they be?\n\nShe and Ramage were friends, very good friends. If she was in a position\nto help him she would help him; only it happened to be the other way\nround. He was in a position to help her. What was the objection?\n\nShe found it impossible to look her own diffidence in the face. So she\nwent to Ramage and came to the point almost at once.\n\n\"Can you spare me forty pounds?\" she said.\n\nMr. Ramage controlled his expression and thought very quickly.\n\n\"Agreed,\" he said, \"certainly,\" and drew a checkbook toward him.\n\n\"It's best,\" he said, \"to make it a good round sum.\n\n\"I won't give you a check though--Yes, I will. I'll give you an\nuncrossed check, and then you can get it at the bank here, quite close\nby.... You'd better not have all the money on you; you had better\nopen a small account in the post-office and draw it out a fiver at a\ntime. That won't involve references, as a bank account would--and all\nthat sort of thing. The money will last longer, and--it won't bother\nyou.\"\n\nHe stood up rather close to her and looked into her eyes. He seemed to\nbe trying to understand something very perplexing and elusive. \"It's\njolly,\" he said, \"to feel you have come to me. It's a sort of guarantee\nof confidence. Last time--you made me feel snubbed.\"\n\nHe hesitated, and went off at a tangent. \"There's no end of things I'd\nlike to talk over with you. It's just upon my lunch-time. Come and have\nlunch with me.\"\n\nAnn Veronica fenced for a moment. \"I don't want to take up your time.\"\n\n\"We won't go to any of these City places. They're just all men, and no\none is safe from scandal. But I know a little place where we'll get a\nlittle quiet talk.\"\n\nAnn Veronica for some indefinable reason did not want to lunch with him,\na reason indeed so indefinable that she dismissed it, and Ramage went\nthrough the outer office with her, alert and attentive, to the vivid\ninterest of the three clerks. The three clerks fought for the only\nwindow, and saw her whisked into a hansom. Their subsequent conversation\nis outside the scope of our story.\n\n\"Ritter's!\" said Ramage to the driver, \"Dean Street.\"\n\nIt was rare that Ann Veronica used hansoms, and to be in one was itself\neventful and exhilarating. She liked the high, easy swing of the thing\nover its big wheels, the quick clatter-patter of the horse, the passage\nof the teeming streets. She admitted her pleasure to Ramage.\n\nAnd Ritter's, too, was very amusing and foreign and discreet; a little\nrambling room with a number of small tables, with red electric light\nshades and flowers. It was an overcast day, albeit not foggy, and\nthe electric light shades glowed warmly, and an Italian waiter with\ninsufficient English took Ramage's orders, and waited with an appearance\nof affection. Ann Veronica thought the whole affair rather jolly. Ritter\nsold better food than most of his compatriots, and cooked it better, and\nRamage, with a fine perception of a feminine palate, ordered Vero Capri.\nIt was, Ann Veronica felt, as a sip or so of that remarkable blend\nwarmed her blood, just the sort of thing that her aunt would not\napprove, to be lunching thus, tete-a-tete with a man; and yet at the\nsame time it was a perfectly innocent as well as agreeable proceeding.\n\nThey talked across their meal in an easy and friendly manner about Ann\nVeronica's affairs. He was really very bright and clever, with a sort of\nconversational boldness that was just within the limits of permissible\ndaring. She described the Goopes and the Fabians to him, and gave him\na sketch of her landlady; and he talked in the most liberal and\nentertaining way of a modern young woman's outlook. He seemed to know\na great deal about life. He gave glimpses of possibilities. He roused\ncuriosities. He contrasted wonderfully with the empty showing-off of\nTeddy. His friendship seemed a thing worth having....\n\nBut when she was thinking it over in her room that evening vague and\nbaffling doubts came drifting across this conviction. She doubted how\nshe stood toward him and what the restrained gleam of his face might\nsignify. She felt that perhaps, in her desire to play an adequate part\nin the conversation, she had talked rather more freely than she ought to\nhave done, and given him a wrong impression of herself.\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nThat was two days before Christmas Eve. The next morning came a compact\nletter from her father.\n\n\n\"MY DEAR DAUGHTER,\" it ran,--\"Here, on the verge of the season\nof forgiveness I hold out a last hand to you in the hope of a\nreconciliation. I ask you, although it is not my place to ask you, to\nreturn home. This roof is still open to you. You will not be taunted\nif you return and everything that can be done will be done to make you\nhappy.\n\n\"Indeed, I must implore you to return. This adventure of yours has gone\non altogether too long; it has become a serious distress to both your\naunt and myself. We fail altogether to understand your motives in doing\nwhat you are doing, or, indeed, how you are managing to do it, or what\nyou are managing on. If you will think only of one trifling aspect--the\ninconvenience it must be to us to explain your absence--I think you may\nbegin to realize what it all means for us. I need hardly say that your\naunt joins with me very heartily in this request.\n\n\"Please come home. You will not find me unreasonable with you.\n\n\"Your affectionate\n\n\"FATHER.\"\n\n\nAnn Veronica sat over her fire with her father's note in her hand.\n\"Queer letters he writes,\" she said. \"I suppose most people's letters\nare queer. Roof open--like a Noah's Ark. I wonder if he really wants me\nto go home. It's odd how little I know of him, and of how he feels and\nwhat he feels.\"\n\n\"I wonder how he treated Gwen.\"\n\nHer mind drifted into a speculation about her sister. \"I ought to look\nup Gwen,\" she said. \"I wonder what happened.\"\n\nThen she fell to thinking about her aunt. \"I would like to go home,\" she\ncried, \"to please her. She has been a dear. Considering how little he\nlets her have.\"\n\nThe truth prevailed. \"The unaccountable thing is that I wouldn't go home\nto please her. She is, in her way, a dear. One OUGHT to want to please\nher. And I don't. I don't care. I can't even make myself care.\"\n\nPresently, as if for comparison with her father's letter, she got out\nRamage's check from the box that contained her papers. For so far she\nhad kept it uncashed. She had not even endorsed it.\n\n\"Suppose I chuck it,\" she remarked, standing with the mauve slip in her\nhand--\"suppose I chuck it, and surrender and go home! Perhaps, after\nall, Roddy was right!\n\n\"Father keeps opening the door and shutting it, but a time will come--\n\n\"I could still go home!\"\n\nShe held Ramage's check as if to tear it across. \"No,\" she said at last;\n\"I'm a human being--not a timid female. What could I do at home? The\nother's a crumple-up--just surrender. Funk! I'll see it out.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nJanuary found Ann Veronica a student in the biological laboratory of the\nCentral Imperial College that towers up from among the back streets in\nthe angle between Euston Road and Great Portland Street. She was working\nvery steadily at the Advanced Course in Comparative Anatomy, wonderfully\nrelieved to have her mind engaged upon one methodically developing theme\nin the place of the discursive uncertainties of the previous two months,\nand doing her utmost to keep right in the back of her mind and out\nof sight the facts, firstly, that she had achieved this haven of\nsatisfactory activity by incurring a debt to Ramage of forty pounds,\nand, secondly, that her present position was necessarily temporary and\nher outlook quite uncertain.\n\nThe biological laboratory had an atmosphere that was all its own.\n\nIt was at the top of the building, and looked clear over a clustering\nmass of inferior buildings toward Regent's Park. It was long and narrow,\na well-lit, well-ventilated, quiet gallery of small tables and sinks,\npervaded by a thin smell of methylated spirit and of a mitigated\nand sterilized organic decay. Along the inner side was a wonderfully\narranged series of displayed specimens that Russell himself had\nprepared. The supreme effect for Ann Veronica was its surpassing\nrelevance; it made every other atmosphere she knew seem discursive and\nconfused. The whole place and everything in it aimed at one thing--to\nillustrate, to elaborate, to criticise and illuminate, and make ever\nplainer and plainer the significance of animal and vegetable structure.\nIt dealt from floor to ceiling and end to end with the Theory of the\nForms of Life; the very duster by the blackboard was there to do its\nshare in that work, the very washers in the taps; the room was more\nsimply concentrated in aim even than a church. To that, perhaps, a\nlarge part of its satisfyingness was due. Contrasted with the confused\nmovement and presences of a Fabian meeting, or the inexplicable\nenthusiasm behind the suffrage demand, with the speeches that were\npartly egotistical displays, partly artful manoeuvres, and partly\nincoherent cries for unsoundly formulated ends, compared with the\ncomings and goings of audiences and supporters that were like the\neddy-driven drift of paper in the street, this long, quiet, methodical\nchamber shone like a star seen through clouds.\n\nDay after day for a measured hour in the lecture-theatre, with elaborate\npower and patience, Russell pieced together difficulty and suggestion,\ninstance and counter-instance, in the elaborate construction of the\nfamily tree of life. And then the students went into the long laboratory\nand followed out these facts in almost living tissue with microscope and\nscalpel, probe and microtome, and the utmost of their skill and care,\nmaking now and then a raid into the compact museum of illustration next\ndoor, in which specimens and models and directions stood in disciplined\nranks, under the direction of the demonstrator Capes. There was a couple\nof blackboards at each end of the aisle of tables, and at these Capes,\nwith quick and nervous speech that contrasted vividly with Russell's\nslow, definitive articulation, directed the dissection and made\nilluminating comments on the structures under examination. Then he\nwould come along the laboratory, sitting down by each student in\nturn, checking the work and discussing its difficulties, and answering\nquestions arising out of Russell's lecture.\n\nAnn Veronica had come to the Imperial College obsessed by the\ngreat figure of Russell, by the part he had played in the Darwinian\ncontroversies, and by the resolute effect of the grim-lipped, yellow,\nleonine face beneath the mane of silvery hair. Capes was rather a\ndiscovery. Capes was something superadded. Russell burned like a beacon,\nbut Capes illuminated by darting flashes and threw light, even if it\nwas but momentary light, into a hundred corners that Russell left\nsteadfastly in the shade.\n\nCapes was an exceptionally fair man of two or three-and-thirty, so\nruddily blond that it was a mercy he had escaped light eyelashes, and\nwith a minor but by no means contemptible reputation of his own. He\ntalked at the blackboard in a pleasant, very slightly lisping voice with\na curious spontaneity, and was sometimes very clumsy in his exposition,\nand sometimes very vivid. He dissected rather awkwardly and hurriedly,\nbut, on the whole, effectively, and drew with an impatient directness\nthat made up in significance what it lacked in precision. Across the\nblackboard the colored chalks flew like flights of variously tinted\nrockets as diagram after diagram flickered into being.\n\nThere happened that year to be an unusual proportion of girls and women\nin the advanced laboratory, perhaps because the class as a whole was an\nexceptionally small one. It numbered nine, and four of these were women\nstudents. As a consequence of its small size, it was possible to get\nalong with the work on a much easier and more colloquial footing than\na larger class would have permitted. And a custom had grown up of a\ngeneral tea at four o'clock, under the auspices of a Miss Garvice, a\ntall and graceful girl of distinguished intellectual incompetence, in\nwhom the hostess instinct seemed to be abnormally developed.\n\nCapes would come to these teas; he evidently liked to come, and he\nwould appear in the doorway of the preparation-room, a pleasing note of\nshyness in his manner, hovering for an invitation.\n\nFrom the first, Ann Veronica found him an exceptionally interesting man.\nTo begin with, he struck her as being the most variable person she had\never encountered. At times he was brilliant and masterful, talked round\nand over every one, and would have been domineering if he had not\nbeen extraordinarily kindly; at times he was almost monosyllabic, and\ndefeated Miss Garvice's most skilful attempts to draw him out. Sometimes\nhe was obviously irritable and uncomfortable and unfortunate in his\nefforts to seem at ease. And sometimes he overflowed with a peculiarly\nmalignant wit that played, with devastating effect, upon any topics that\nhad the courage to face it. Ann Veronica's experiences of men had been\namong more stable types--Teddy, who was always absurd; her father,\nwho was always authoritative and sentimental; Manning, who was always\nManning. And most of the others she had met had, she felt, the same\nsteadfastness. Goopes, she was sure was always high-browed and slow and\nSocratic. And Ramage too--about Ramage there would always be that air of\navidity, that air of knowledge and inquiry, the mixture of things in his\ntalk that were rather good with things that were rather poor. But one\ncould not count with any confidence upon Capes.\n\nThe five men students were a mixed company. There was a very white-faced\nyoungster of eighteen who brushed back his hair exactly in Russell's\nmanner, and was disposed to be uncomfortably silent when he was\nnear her, and to whom she felt it was only Christian kindness to be\nconsistently pleasant; and a lax young man of five-and-twenty in navy\nblue, who mingled Marx and Bebel with the more orthodox gods of the\nbiological pantheon. There was a short, red-faced, resolute youth who\ninherited an authoritative attitude upon bacteriology from his father;\na Japanese student of unassuming manners who drew beautifully and had\nan imperfect knowledge of English; and a dark, unwashed Scotchman\nwith complicated spectacles, who would come every morning as a sort of\nvolunteer supplementary demonstrator, look very closely at her work\nand her, tell her that her dissections were \"fairish,\" or \"very fairish\nindeed,\" or \"high above the normal female standard,\" hover as if for\nsome outbreak of passionate gratitude and with admiring retrospects\nthat made the facetted spectacles gleam like diamonds, return to his own\nplace.\n\nThe women, Ann Veronica thought, were not quite so interesting as the\nmen. There were two school-mistresses, one of whom--Miss Klegg--might\nhave been a first cousin to Miss Miniver, she had so many Miniver\ntraits; there was a preoccupied girl whose name Ann Veronica never\nlearned, but who worked remarkably well; and Miss Garvice, who began\nby attracting her very greatly--she moved so beautifully--and ended by\ngiving her the impression that moving beautifully was the beginning and\nend of her being.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nThe next few weeks were a time of the very liveliest thought and growth\nfor Ann Veronica. The crowding impressions of the previous weeks seemed\nto run together directly her mind left the chaotic search for employment\nand came into touch again with a coherent and systematic development\nof ideas. The advanced work at the Central Imperial College was in the\nclosest touch with living interests and current controversies; it drew\nits illustrations and material from Russell's two great researches--upon\nthe relation of the brachiopods to the echinodermata, and upon the\nsecondary and tertiary mammalian and pseudo-mammalian factors in the\nfree larval forms of various marine organisms. Moreover, a vigorous fire\nof mutual criticism was going on now between the Imperial College and\nthe Cambridge Mendelians and echoed in the lectures. From beginning to\nend it was first-hand stuff.\n\nBut the influence of the science radiated far beyond its own special\nfield--beyond those beautiful but highly technical problems with which\nwe do not propose for a moment to trouble the naturally terrified\nreader. Biology is an extraordinarily digestive science. It throws out a\nnumber of broad experimental generalizations, and then sets out to\nbring into harmony or relation with these an infinitely multifarious\ncollection of phenomena. The little streaks upon the germinating area\nof an egg, the nervous movements of an impatient horse, the trick of\na calculating boy, the senses of a fish, the fungus at the root of a\ngarden flower, and the slime upon a sea-wet rock--ten thousand such\nthings bear their witness and are illuminated. And not only did these\ntentacular generalizations gather all the facts of natural history and\ncomparative anatomy together, but they seemed always stretching out\nfurther and further into a world of interests that lay altogether\noutside their legitimate bounds.\n\nIt came to Ann Veronica one night after a long talk with Miss Miniver,\nas a sudden remarkable thing, as a grotesque, novel aspect, that this\nslowly elaborating biological scheme had something more than an academic\ninterest for herself. And not only so, but that it was after all, a more\nsystematic and particular method of examining just the same questions\nthat underlay the discussions of the Fabian Society, the talk of the\nWest Central Arts Club, the chatter of the studios and the deep, the\nbottomless discussions of the simple-life homes. It was the same Bios\nwhose nature and drift and ways and methods and aspects engaged\nthem all. And she, she in her own person too, was this eternal Bios,\nbeginning again its recurrent journey to selection and multiplication\nand failure or survival.\n\nBut this was but a momentary gleam of personal application, and at this\ntime she followed it up no further.\n\nAnd now Ann Veronica's evenings were also becoming very busy. She\npursued her interest in the Socialist movement and in the Suffragist\nagitation in the company of Miss Miniver. They went to various central\nand local Fabian gatherings, and to a number of suffrage meetings. Teddy\nWidgett hovered on the fringe of all these gatherings, blinking at Ann\nVeronica and occasionally making a wildly friendly dash at her, and\ncarrying her and Miss Miniver off to drink cocoa with a choice diversity\nof other youthful and congenial Fabians after the meetings. Then Mr.\nManning loomed up ever and again into her world, full of a futile\nsolicitude, and almost always declaring she was splendid, splendid, and\nwishing he could talk things out with her. Teas he contributed to the\ncommissariat of Ann Veronica's campaign--quite a number of teas. He\nwould get her to come to tea with him, usually in a pleasant tea-room\nover a fruit-shop in Tottenham Court Road, and he would discuss his own\npoint of view and hint at a thousand devotions were she but to command\nhim. And he would express various artistic sensibilities and aesthetic\nappreciations in carefully punctuated sentences and a large, clear\nvoice. At Christmas he gave her a set of a small edition of Meredith's\nnovels, very prettily bound in flexible leather, being guided in the\nchoice of an author, as he intimated, rather by her preferences than his\nown.\n\nThere was something markedly and deliberately liberal-minded in his\nmanner in all their encounters. He conveyed not only his sense of the\nextreme want of correctitude in their unsanctioned meetings, but also\nthat, so far as he was concerned, this irregularity mattered not at\nall, that he had flung--and kept on flinging--such considerations to the\nwind.\n\nAnd, in addition, she was now seeing and talking to Ramage almost\nweekly, on a theory which she took very gravely, that they were\nexceptionally friends. He would ask her to come to dinner with him in\nsome little Italian or semi-Bohemian restaurant in the district toward\nSoho, or in one of the more stylish and magnificent establishments about\nPiccadilly Circus, and for the most part she did not care to refuse.\nNor, indeed, did she want to refuse. These dinners, from their lavish\ndisplay of ambiguous hors d'oeuvre to their skimpy ices in dishes of\nfrilled paper, with their Chianti flasks and Parmesan dishes and their\npolyglot waiters and polyglot clientele, were very funny and bright;\nand she really liked Ramage, and valued his help and advice. It was\ninteresting to see how different and characteristic his mode of approach\nwas to all sorts of questions that interested her, and it was amusing to\ndiscover this other side to the life of a Morningside Park inhabitant.\nShe had thought that all Morningside Park householders came home before\nseven at the latest, as her father usually did. Ramage talked always\nabout women or some woman's concern, and very much about Ann Veronica's\nown outlook upon life. He was always drawing contrasts between a woman's\nlot and a man's, and treating her as a wonderful new departure in this\ncomparison. Ann Veronica liked their relationship all the more because\nit was an unusual one.\n\nAfter these dinners they would have a walk, usually to the Thames\nEmbankment to see the two sweeps of river on either side of Waterloo\nBridge; and then they would part at Westminster Bridge, perhaps, and\nhe would go on to Waterloo. Once he suggested they should go to a\nmusic-hall and see a wonderful new dancer, but Ann Veronica did not feel\nshe cared to see a new dancer. So, instead, they talked of dancing\nand what it might mean in a human life. Ann Veronica thought it was\na spontaneous release of energy expressive of well-being, but Ramage\nthought that by dancing, men, and such birds and animals as dance, come\nto feel and think of their bodies.\n\nThis intercourse, which had been planned to warm Ann Veronica to a\nfamiliar affection with Ramage, was certainly warming Ramage to a\nconstantly deepening interest in Ann Veronica. He felt that he was\ngetting on with her very slowly indeed, but he did not see how he could\nget on faster. He had, he felt, to create certain ideas and vivify\ncertain curiosities and feelings in her. Until that was done a certain\nexperience of life assured him that a girl is a locked coldness against\na man's approach. She had all the fascination of being absolutely\nperplexing in this respect. On the one hand, she seemed to think plainly\nand simply, and would talk serenely and freely about topics that most\nwomen have been trained either to avoid or conceal; and on the other she\nwas unconscious, or else she had an air of being unconscious--that was\nthe riddle--to all sorts of personal applications that almost any girl\nor woman, one might have thought, would have made. He was always doing\nhis best to call her attention to the fact that he was a man of spirit\nand quality and experience, and she a young and beautiful woman, and\nthat all sorts of constructions upon their relationship were possible,\ntrusting her to go on from that to the idea that all sorts of\nrelationships were possible. She responded with an unfaltering\nappearance of insensibility, and never as a young and beautiful woman\nconscious of sex; always in the character of an intelligent girl\nstudent.\n\nHis perception of her personal beauty deepened and quickened with each\nencounter. Every now and then her general presence became radiantly\ndazzling in his eyes; she would appear in the street coming toward him,\na surprise, so fine and smiling and welcoming was she, so expanded and\nilluminated and living, in contrast with his mere expectation. Or he\nwould find something--a wave in her hair, a little line in the contour\nof her brow or neck, that made an exquisite discovery.\n\nHe was beginning to think about her inordinately. He would sit in\nhis inner office and compose conversations with her, penetrating,\nilluminating, and nearly conclusive--conversations that never proved to\nbe of the slightest use at all with her when he met her face to face.\nAnd he began also at times to wake at night and think about her.\n\nHe thought of her and himself, and no longer in that vein of incidental\nadventure in which he had begun. He thought, too, of the fretful invalid\nwho lay in the next room to his, whose money had created his business\nand made his position in the world.\n\n\"I've had most of the things I wanted,\" said Ramage, in the stillness of\nthe night.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nFor a time Ann Veronica's family had desisted from direct offers of a\nfree pardon; they were evidently waiting for her resources to come to\nan end. Neither father, aunt, nor brothers made a sign, and then\none afternoon in early February her aunt came up in a state between\nexpostulation and dignified resentment, but obviously very anxious for\nAnn Veronica's welfare. \"I had a dream in the night,\" she said. \"I saw\nyou in a sort of sloping, slippery place, holding on by your hands and\nslipping. You seemed to me to be slipping and slipping, and your face\nwas white. It was really most vivid, most vivid! You seemed to be\nslipping and just going to tumble and holding on. It made me wake up,\nand there I lay thinking of you, spending your nights up here all alone,\nand no one to look after you. I wondered what you could be doing and\nwhat might be happening to you. I said to myself at once, 'Either this\nis a coincidence or the caper sauce.' But I made sure it was you. I felt\nI MUST do something anyhow, and up I came just as soon as I could to see\nyou.\"\n\nShe had spoken rather rapidly. \"I can't help saying it,\" she said, with\nthe quality of her voice altering, \"but I do NOT think it is right for\nan unprotected girl to be in London alone as you are.\"\n\n\"But I'm quite equal to taking care of myself, aunt.\"\n\n\"It must be most uncomfortable here. It is most uncomfortable for every\none concerned.\"\n\nShe spoke with a certain asperity. She felt that Ann Veronica had duped\nher in that dream, and now that she had come up to London she might as\nwell speak her mind.\n\n\"No Christmas dinner,\" she said, \"or anything nice! One doesn't even\nknow what you are doing.\"\n\n\"I'm going on working for my degree.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you do that at home?\"\n\n\"I'm working at the Imperial College. You see, aunt, it's the only\npossible way for me to get a good degree in my subjects, and father\nwon't hear of it. There'd only be endless rows if I was at home. And how\ncould I come home--when he locks me in rooms and all that?\"\n\n\"I do wish this wasn't going on,\" said Miss Stanley, after a pause. \"I\ndo wish you and your father could come to some agreement.\"\n\nAnn Veronica responded with conviction: \"I wish so, too.\"\n\n\"Can't we arrange something? Can't we make a sort of treaty?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't keep it. He would get very cross one evening and no one\nwould dare to remind him of it.\"\n\n\"How can you say such things?\"\n\n\"But he would!\"\n\n\"Still, it isn't your place to say so.\"\n\n\"It prevents a treaty.\"\n\n\"Couldn't _I_ make a treaty?\"\n\nAnn Veronica thought, and could not see any possible treaty that would\nleave it open for her to have quasi-surreptitious dinners with Ramage\nor go on walking round the London squares discussing Socialism with Miss\nMiniver toward the small hours. She had tasted freedom now, and so far\nshe had not felt the need of protection. Still, there certainly was\nsomething in the idea of a treaty.\n\n\"I don't see at all how you can be managing,\" said Miss Stanley, and Ann\nVeronica hastened to reply, \"I do on very little.\" Her mind went back to\nthat treaty.\n\n\"And aren't there fees to pay at the Imperial College?\" her aunt was\nsaying--a disagreeable question.\n\n\"There are a few fees.\"\n\n\"Then how have you managed?\"\n\n\"Bother!\" said Ann Veronica to herself, and tried not to look guilty. \"I\nwas able to borrow the money.\"\n\n\"Borrow the money! But who lent you the money?\"\n\n\"A friend,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nShe felt herself getting into a corner. She sought hastily in her mind\nfor a plausible answer to an obvious question that didn't come. Her aunt\nwent off at a tangent. \"But my dear Ann Veronica, you will be getting\ninto debt!\"\n\nAnn Veronica at once, and with a feeling of immense relief, took refuge\nin her dignity. \"I think, aunt,\" she said, \"you might trust to my\nself-respect to keep me out of that.\"\n\nFor the moment her aunt could not think of any reply to this\ncounterstroke, and Ann Veronica followed up her advantage by a sudden\ninquiry about her abandoned boots.\n\nBut in the train going home her aunt reasoned it out.\n\n\"If she is borrowing money,\" said Miss Stanley, \"she MUST be getting\ninto debt. It's all nonsense....\"\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nIt was by imperceptible degrees that Capes became important in Ann\nVeronica's thoughts. But then he began to take steps, and, at last,\nstrides to something more and more like predominance. She began by being\ninterested in his demonstrations and his biological theory, then she was\nattracted by his character, and then, in a manner, she fell in love with\nhis mind.\n\nOne day they were at tea in the laboratory and a discussion sprang up\nabout the question of women's suffrage. The movement was then in its\nearlier militant phases, and one of the women only, Miss Garvice,\nopposed it, though Ann Veronica was disposed to be lukewarm. But a man's\nopposition always inclined her to the suffrage side; she had a curious\nfeeling of loyalty in seeing the more aggressive women through. Capes\nwas irritatingly judicial in the matter, neither absurdly against, in\nwhich case one might have smashed him, or hopelessly undecided, but\ntepidly sceptical. Miss Klegg and the youngest girl made a vigorous\nattack on Miss Garvice, who had said she thought women lost something\ninfinitely precious by mingling in the conflicts of life. The discussion\nwandered, and was punctuated with bread and butter. Capes was inclined\nto support Miss Klegg until Miss Garvice cornered him by quoting him\nagainst himself, and citing a recent paper in the Nineteenth Century, in\nwhich, following Atkinson, he had made a vigorous and damaging attack\non Lester Ward's case for the primitive matriarchate and the predominant\nimportance of the female throughout the animal kingdom.\n\nAnn Veronica was not aware of this literary side of her teacher; she had\na little tinge of annoyance at Miss Garvice's advantage. Afterwards\nshe hunted up the article in question, and it seemed to her quite\ndelightfully written and argued. Capes had the gift of easy, unaffected\nwriting, coupled with very clear and logical thinking, and to follow\nhis written thought gave her the sensation of cutting things with a\nperfectly new, perfectly sharp knife. She found herself anxious to read\nmore of him, and the next Wednesday she went to the British Museum and\nhunted first among the half-crown magazines for his essays and then\nthrough various scientific quarterlies for his research papers. The\nordinary research paper, when it is not extravagant theorizing, is apt\nto be rather sawdusty in texture, and Ann Veronica was delighted to find\nthe same easy and confident luminosity that distinguished his work for\nthe general reader. She returned to these latter, and at the back of\nher mind, as she looked them over again, was a very distinct resolve\nto quote them after the manner of Miss Garvice at the very first\nopportunity.\n\nWhen she got home to her lodgings that evening she reflected with\nsomething like surprise upon her half-day's employment, and decided\nthat it showed nothing more nor less than that Capes was a really very\ninteresting person indeed.\n\nAnd then she fell into a musing about Capes. She wondered why he was so\ndistinctive, so unlike other men, and it never occurred to her for some\ntime that this might be because she was falling in love with him.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nYet Ann Veronica was thinking a very great deal about love. A dozen\nshynesses and intellectual barriers were being outflanked or broken\ndown in her mind. All the influences about her worked with her own\npredisposition and against all the traditions of her home and upbringing\nto deal with the facts of life in an unabashed manner. Ramage, by a\nhundred skilful hints had led her to realize that the problem of her own\nlife was inseparably associated with, and indeed only one special case\nof, the problems of any woman's life, and that the problem of a woman's\nlife is love.\n\n\"A young man comes into life asking how best he may place himself,\"\nRamage had said; \"a woman comes into life thinking instinctively how\nbest she may give herself.\"\n\nShe noted that as a good saying, and it germinated and spread tentacles\nof explanation through her brain. The biological laboratory, perpetually\nviewing life as pairing and breeding and selection, and again pairing\nand breeding, seemed only a translated generalization of that assertion.\nAnd all the talk of the Miniver people and the Widgett people seemed\nalways to be like a ship in adverse weather on the lee shore of love.\n\"For seven years,\" said Ann Veronica, \"I have been trying to keep myself\nfrom thinking about love....\n\n\"I have been training myself to look askance at beautiful things.\"\n\nShe gave herself permission now to look at this squarely. She made\nherself a private declaration of liberty. \"This is mere nonsense, mere\ntongue-tied fear!\" she said. \"This is the slavery of the veiled life.\nI might as well be at Morningside Park. This business of love is the\nsupreme affair in life, it is the woman's one event and crisis that\nmakes up for all her other restrictions, and I cower--as we all\ncower--with a blushing and paralyzed mind until it overtakes me!...\n\n\"I'll be hanged if I do.\"\n\nBut she could not talk freely about love, she found, for all that\nmanumission.\n\nRamage seemed always fencing about the forbidden topic, probing for\nopenings, and she wondered why she did not give him them. But something\ninstinctive prevented that, and with the finest resolve not to be\n\"silly\" and prudish she found that whenever he became at all bold\nin this matter she became severely scientific and impersonal, almost\nentomological indeed, in her method; she killed every remark as he made\nit and pinned it out for examination. In the biological laboratory that\nwas their invincible tone. But she disapproved more and more of her own\nmental austerity. Here was an experienced man of the world, her friend,\nwho evidently took a great interest in this supreme topic and was\nwilling to give her the benefit of his experiences! Why should not she\nbe at her ease with him? Why should not she know things? It is hard\nenough anyhow for a human being to learn, she decided, but it is a dozen\ntimes more difficult than it need be because of all this locking of the\nlips and thoughts.\n\nShe contrived to break down the barriers of shyness at last in one\ndirection, and talked one night of love and the facts of love with Miss\nMiniver.\n\nBut Miss Miniver was highly unsatisfactory. She repeated phrases of Mrs.\nGoopes's: \"Advanced people,\" she said, with an air of great elucidation,\n\"tend to GENERALIZE love. 'He prayeth best who loveth best--all things\nboth great and small.' For my own part I go about loving.\"\n\n\"Yes, but men;\" said Ann Veronica, plunging; \"don't you want the love of\nmen?\"\n\nFor some seconds they remained silent, both shocked by this question.\n\nMiss Miniver looked over her glasses at her friend almost balefully.\n\"NO!\" she said, at last, with something in her voice that reminded Ann\nVeronica of a sprung tennis-racket.\n\n\"I've been through all that,\" she went on, after a pause.\n\nShe spoke slowly. \"I have never yet met a man whose intellect I could\nrespect.\"\n\nAnn Veronica looked at her thoughtfully for a moment, and decided to\npersist on principle.\n\n\"But if you had?\" she said.\n\n\"I can't imagine it,\" said Miss Miniver. \"And think, think\"--her voice\nsank--\"of the horrible coarseness!\"\n\n\"What coarseness?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"My dear Vee!\" Her voice became very low. \"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"Oh! I know--\"\n\n\"Well--\" Her face was an unaccustomed pink.\n\nAnn Veronica ignored her friend's confusion.\n\n\"Don't we all rather humbug about the coarseness? All we women, I mean,\"\nsaid she. She decided to go on, after a momentary halt. \"We pretend\nbodies are ugly. Really they are the most beautiful things in the world.\nWe pretend we never think of everything that makes us what we are.\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Miss Miniver, almost vehemently. \"You are wrong! I did not\nthink you thought such things. Bodies! Bodies! Horrible things! We are\nsouls. Love lives on a higher plane. We are not animals. If ever I\ndid meet a man I could love, I should love him\"--her voice dropped\nagain--\"platonically.\"\n\nShe made her glasses glint. \"Absolutely platonically,\" she said.\n\n\"Soul to soul.\"\n\nShe turned her face to the fire, gripped her hands upon her elbows, and\ndrew her thin shoulders together in a shrug. \"Ugh!\" she said.\n\nAnn Veronica watched her and wondered about her.\n\n\"We do not want the men,\" said Miss Miniver; \"we do not want them, with\ntheir sneers and loud laughter. Empty, silly, coarse brutes. Brutes!\nThey are the brute still with us! Science some day may teach us a way\nto do without them. It is only the women matter. It is not every sort of\ncreature needs--these males. Some have no males.\"\n\n\"There's green-fly,\" admitted Ann Veronica. \"And even then--\"\n\nThe conversation hung for a thoughtful moment.\n\nAnn Veronica readjusted her chin on her hand. \"I wonder which of us is\nright,\" she said. \"I haven't a scrap--of this sort of aversion.\"\n\n\"Tolstoy is so good about this,\" said Miss Miniver, regardless of her\nfriend's attitude. \"He sees through it all. The Higher Life and the\nLower. He sees men all defiled by coarse thoughts, coarse ways of living\ncruelties. Simply because they are hardened by--by bestiality,\nand poisoned by the juices of meat slain in anger and fermented\ndrinks--fancy! drinks that have been swarmed in by thousands and\nthousands of horrible little bacteria!\"\n\n\"It's yeast,\" said Ann Veronica--\"a vegetable.\"\n\n\"It's all the same,\" said Miss Miniver. \"And then they are swollen up\nand inflamed and drunken with matter. They are blinded to all fine\nand subtle things--they look at life with bloodshot eyes and dilated\nnostrils. They are arbitrary and unjust and dogmatic and brutish and\nlustful.\"\n\n\"But do you really think men's minds are altered by the food they eat?\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Miss Miniver. \"Experte credo. When I am leading a true\nlife, a pure and simple life free of all stimulants and excitements, I\nthink--I think--oh! with pellucid clearness; but if I so much as take a\nmouthful of meat--or anything--the mirror is all blurred.\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nThen, arising she knew not how, like a new-born appetite, came a craving\nin Ann Veronica for the sight and sound of beauty.\n\nIt was as if her aesthetic sense had become inflamed. Her mind turned\nand accused itself of having been cold and hard. She began to look for\nbeauty and discover it in unexpected aspects and places. Hitherto she\nhad seen it chiefly in pictures and other works of art, incidentally,\nand as a thing taken out of life. Now the sense of beauty was spreading\nto a multitude of hitherto unsuspected aspects of the world about her.\n\nThe thought of beauty became an obsession. It interwove with her\nbiological work. She found herself asking more and more curiously, \"Why,\non the principle of the survival of the fittest, have I any sense of\nbeauty at all?\" That enabled her to go on thinking about beauty when it\nseemed to her right that she should be thinking about biology.\n\nShe was very greatly exercised by the two systems of values--the two\nseries of explanations that her comparative anatomy on the one hand and\nher sense of beauty on the other, set going in her thoughts. She could\nnot make up her mind which was the finer, more elemental thing, which\ngave its values to the other. Was it that the struggle of things\nto survive produced as a sort of necessary by-product these intense\npreferences and appreciations, or was it that some mystical outer thing,\nsome great force, drove life beautyward, even in spite of expediency,\nregardless of survival value and all the manifest discretions of life?\nShe went to Capes with that riddle and put it to him very carefully and\nclearly, and he talked well--he always talked at some length when she\ntook a difficulty to him--and sent her to a various literature upon the\nmarkings of butterflies, the incomprehensible elaboration and splendor\nof birds of Paradise and humming-birds' plumes, the patterning of\ntigers, and a leopard's spots. He was interesting and inconclusive, and\nthe original papers to which he referred her discursive were at best\nonly suggestive. Afterward, one afternoon, he hovered about her, and\ncame and sat beside her and talked of beauty and the riddle of beauty\nfor some time. He displayed a quite unprofessional vein of mysticism in\nthe matter. He contrasted with Russell, whose intellectual methods were,\nso to speak, sceptically dogmatic. Their talk drifted to the beauty of\nmusic, and they took that up again at tea-time.\n\nBut as the students sat about Miss Garvice's tea-pot and drank tea or\nsmoked cigarettes, the talk got away from Capes. The Scotchman informed\nAnn Veronica that your view of beauty necessarily depended on your\nmetaphysical premises, and the young man with the Russell-like hair\nbecame anxious to distinguish himself by telling the Japanese student\nthat Western art was symmetrical and Eastern art asymmetrical, and that\namong the higher organisms the tendency was toward an external symmetry\nveiling an internal want of balance. Ann Veronica decided she would have\nto go on with Capes another day, and, looking up, discovered him sitting\non a stool with his hands in his pockets and his head a little on one\nside, regarding her with a thoughtful expression. She met his eye for a\nmoment in curious surprise.\n\nHe turned his eyes and stared at Miss Garvice like one who wakes from\na reverie, and then got up and strolled down the laboratory toward his\nrefuge, the preparation-room.\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nThen one day a little thing happened that clothed itself in\nsignificance.\n\nShe had been working upon a ribbon of microtome sections of the\ndeveloping salamander, and he came to see what she had made of them. She\nstood up and he sat down at the microscope, and for a time he was busy\nscrutinizing one section after another. She looked down at him and saw\nthat the sunlight was gleaming from his cheeks, and that all over\nhis cheeks was a fine golden down of delicate hairs. And at the sight\nsomething leaped within her.\n\nSomething changed for her.\n\nShe became aware of his presence as she had never been aware of any\nhuman being in her life before. She became aware of the modelling of his\near, of the muscles of his neck and the textures of the hair that came\noff his brow, the soft minute curve of eyelid that she could just see\nbeyond his brow; she perceived all these familiar objects as though\nthey were acutely beautiful things. They WERE, she realized, acutely\nbeautiful things. Her sense followed the shoulders under his coat, down\nto where his flexible, sensitive-looking hand rested lightly upon the\ntable. She felt him as something solid and strong and trustworthy beyond\nmeasure. The perception of him flooded her being.\n\nHe got up. \"Here's something rather good,\" he said, and with a start and\nan effort she took his place at the microscope, while he stood beside\nher and almost leaning over her.\n\nShe found she was trembling at his nearness and full of a thrilling\ndread that he might touch her. She pulled herself together and put her\neye to the eye-piece.\n\n\"You see the pointer?\" he asked.\n\n\"I see the pointer,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like this,\" he said, and dragged a stool beside her and sat down\nwith his elbow four inches from hers and made a sketch. Then he got up\nand left her.\n\nShe had a feeling at his departure as of an immense cavity, of something\nenormously gone; she could not tell whether it was infinite regret or\ninfinite relief....\n\nBut now Ann Veronica knew what was the matter with her.\n\n\n\nPart 8\n\n\nAnd as she sat on her bed that night, musing and half-undressed, she\nbegan to run one hand down her arm and scrutinize the soft flow of\nmuscle under her skin. She thought of the marvellous beauty of skin,\nand all the delightfulness of living texture. Oh the back of her arm she\nfound the faintest down of hair in the world. \"Etherialized monkey,\" she\nsaid. She held out her arm straight before her, and turned her hand this\nway and that.\n\n\"Why should one pretend?\" she whispered. \"Why should one pretend?\n\n\"Think of all the beauty in the world that is covered up and overlaid.\"\n\nShe glanced shyly at the mirror above her dressing-table, and then about\nher at the furniture, as though it might penetrate to the thoughts that\npeeped in her mind.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Ann Veronica at last, \"if I am beautiful? I wonder if I\nshall ever shine like a light, like a translucent goddess?--\n\n\"I wonder--\n\n\"I suppose girls and women have prayed for this, have come to this--In\nBabylon, in Nineveh.\n\n\"Why shouldn't one face the facts of one's self?\"\n\nShe stood up. She posed herself before her mirror and surveyed herself\nwith gravely thoughtful, gravely critical, and yet admiring eyes. \"And,\nafter all, I am just one common person!\"\n\nShe watched the throb of the arteries in the stem of her neck, and\nput her hand at last gently and almost timidly to where her heart beat\nbeneath her breast.\n\n\n\nPart 9\n\n\nThe realization that she was in love flooded Ann Veronica's mind, and\naltered the quality of all its topics.\n\nShe began to think persistently of Capes, and it seemed to her now that\nfor some weeks at least she must have been thinking persistently of\nhim unawares. She was surprised to find how stored her mind was with\nimpressions and memories of him, how vividly she remembered his gestures\nand little things that he had said. It occurred to her that it was\nabsurd and wrong to be so continuously thinking of one engrossing topic,\nand she made a strenuous effort to force her mind to other questions.\n\nBut it was extraordinary what seemingly irrelevant things could restore\nher to the thought of Capes again. And when she went to sleep, then\nalways Capes became the novel and wonderful guest of her dreams.\n\nFor a time it really seemed all-sufficient to her that she should love.\nThat Capes should love her seemed beyond the compass of her imagination.\nIndeed, she did not want to think of him as loving her. She wanted to\nthink of him as her beloved person, to be near him and watch him,\nto have him going about, doing this and that, saying this and that,\nunconscious of her, while she too remained unconscious of herself. To\nthink of him as loving her would make all that different. Then he would\nturn his face to her, and she would have to think of herself in his\neyes. She would become defensive--what she did would be the thing that\nmattered. He would require things of her, and she would be passionately\nconcerned to meet his requirements. Loving was better than that. Loving\nwas self-forgetfulness, pure delighting in another human being. She felt\nthat with Capes near to her she would be content always to go on loving.\n\nShe went next day to the schools, and her world seemed all made of\nhappiness just worked up roughly into shapes and occasions and duties.\nShe found she could do her microscope work all the better for being in\nlove. She winced when first she heard the preparation-room door open and\nCapes came down the laboratory; but when at last he reached her she was\nself-possessed. She put a stool for him at a little distance from her\nown, and after he had seen the day's work he hesitated, and then plunged\ninto a resumption of their discussion about beauty.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"I was a little too mystical about beauty the other\nday.\"\n\n\"I like the mystical way,\" she said.\n\n\"Our business here is the right way. I've been thinking, you know--I'm\nnot sure that primarily the perception of beauty isn't just intensity\nof feeling free from pain; intensity of perception without any tissue\ndestruction.\"\n\n\"I like the mystical way better,\" said Ann Veronica, and thought.\n\n\"A number of beautiful things are not intense.\"\n\n\"But delicacy, for example, may be intensely perceived.\"\n\n\"But why is one face beautiful and another not?\" objected Ann Veronica;\n\"on your theory any two faces side by side in the sunlight ought to be\nequally beautiful. One must get them with exactly the same intensity.\"\n\nHe did not agree with that. \"I don't mean simply intensity of sensation.\nI said intensity of perception. You may perceive harmony, proportion,\nrhythm, intensely. They are things faint and slight in themselves, as\nphysical facts, but they are like the detonator of a bomb: they\nlet loose the explosive. There's the internal factor as well as the\nexternal.... I don't know if I express myself clearly. I mean that\nthe point is that vividness of perception is the essential factor of\nbeauty; but, of course, vividness may be created by a whisper.\"\n\n\"That brings us back,\" said Ann Veronica, \"to the mystery. Why should\nsome things and not others open the deeps?\"\n\n\"Well, that might, after all, be an outcome of selection--like the\npreference for blue flowers, which are not nearly so bright as yellow,\nof some insects.\"\n\n\"That doesn't explain sunsets.\"\n\n\"Not quite so easily as it explains an insect alighting on colored\npaper. But perhaps if people didn't like clear, bright, healthy\neyes--which is biologically understandable--they couldn't like precious\nstones. One thing may be a necessary collateral of the others. And,\nafter all, a fine clear sky of bright colors is the signal to come out\nof hiding and rejoice and go on with life.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Ann Veronica, and shook her head.\n\nCapes smiled cheerfully with his eyes meeting hers. \"I throw it out\nin passing,\" he said. \"What I am after is that beauty isn't a special\ninserted sort of thing; that's my idea. It's just life, pure life, life\nnascent, running clear and strong.\"\n\nHe stood up to go on to the next student.\n\n\"There's morbid beauty,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I wonder if there is!\" said Capes, and paused, and then bent down over\nthe boy who wore his hair like Russell.\n\nAnn Veronica surveyed his sloping back for a moment, and then drew her\nmicroscope toward her. Then for a time she sat very still. She felt that\nshe had passed a difficult corner, and that now she could go on talking\nwith him again, just as she had been used to do before she understood\nwhat was the matter with her....\n\nShe had one idea, she found, very clear in her mind--that she would get\na Research Scholarship, and so contrive another year in the laboratory.\n\n\"Now I see what everything means,\" said Ann Veronica to herself; and it\nreally felt for some days as though the secret of the universe, that had\nbeen wrapped and hidden from her so obstinately, was at last altogether\ndisplayed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE NINTH\n\nDISCORDS\n\nPart 1\n\nOne afternoon, soon after Ann Veronica's great discovery, a telegram\ncame into the laboratory for her. It ran:\n\n     ---------------------------------------------------\n     |   Bored  |  and      | nothing  |   to   |   do   |\n     |----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\n     |   will   |    you    |   dine   |  with  |   me   |\n     |----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\n     | to-night | somewhere |   and    |  talk  |   I    |\n     |----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\n     |  shall   |     be    | grateful | Ramage |        |\n     ---------------------------------------------------\n\nAnn Veronica was rather pleased by this. She had not seen Ramage for ten\nor eleven days, and she was quite ready for a gossip with him. And now\nher mind was so full of the thought that she was in love--in love!--that\nmarvellous state! that I really believe she had some dim idea of talking\nto him about it. At any rate, it would be good to hear him saying the\nsort of things he did--perhaps now she would grasp them better--with\nthis world-shaking secret brandishing itself about inside her head\nwithin a yard of him.\n\nShe was sorry to find Ramage a little disposed to be melancholy.\n\n\"I have made over seven hundred pounds in the last week,\" he said.\n\n\"That's exhilarating,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" he said; \"it's only a score in a game.\"\n\n\"It's a score you can buy all sorts of things with.\"\n\n\"Nothing that one wants.\"\n\nHe turned to the waiter, who held a wine-card. \"Nothing can cheer me,\"\nhe said, \"except champagne.\" He meditated. \"This,\" he said, and then:\n\"No! Is this sweeter? Very well.\"\n\n\"Everything goes well with me,\" he said, folding his arms under him and\nregarding Ann Veronica with the slightly projecting eyes wide open. \"And\nI'm not happy. I believe I'm in love.\"\n\nHe leaned back for his soup.\n\nPresently he resumed: \"I believe I must be in love.\"\n\n\"You can't be that,\" said Ann Veronica, wisely.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Well, it isn't exactly a depressing state, is it?\"\n\n\"YOU don't know.\"\n\n\"One has theories,\" said Ann Veronica, radiantly.\n\n\"Oh, theories! Being in love is a fact.\"\n\n\"It ought to make one happy.\"\n\n\"It's an unrest--a longing--What's that?\" The waiter had intervened.\n\"Parmesan--take it away!\"\n\nHe glanced at Ann Veronica's face, and it seemed to him that she really\nwas exceptionally radiant. He wondered why she thought love made people\nhappy, and began to talk of the smilax and pinks that adorned the table.\nHe filled her glass with champagne. \"You MUST,\" he said, \"because of my\ndepression.\"\n\nThey were eating quails when they returned to the topic of love. \"What\nmade you think\" he said, abruptly, with the gleam of avidity in his\nface, \"that love makes people happy?\"\n\n\"I know it must.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\nHe was, she thought, a little too insistent. \"Women know these things by\ninstinct,\" she answered.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said, \"if women do know things by instinct? I have\nmy doubts about feminine instinct. It's one of our conventional\nsuperstitions. A woman is supposed to know when a man is in love with\nher. Do you think she does?\"\n\nAnn Veronica picked among her salad with a judicial expression of face.\n\"I think she would,\" she decided.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ramage, impressively.\n\nAnn Veronica looked up at him and found him regarding her with eyes that\nwere almost woebegone, and into which, indeed, he was trying to throw\nmuch more expression than they could carry. There was a little pause\nbetween them, full for Ann Veronica of rapid elusive suspicions and\nintimations.\n\n\"Perhaps one talks nonsense about a woman's instinct,\" she said. \"It's\na way of avoiding explanations. And girls and women, perhaps, are\ndifferent. I don't know. I don't suppose a girl can tell if a man is in\nlove with her or not in love with her.\" Her mind went off to Capes. Her\nthoughts took words for themselves. \"She can't. I suppose it depends on\nher own state of mind. If one wants a thing very much, perhaps one is\ninclined to think one can't have it. I suppose if one were to love some\none, one would feel doubtful. And if one were to love some one very\nmuch, it's just so that one would be blindest, just when one wanted most\nto see.\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly, afraid that Ramage might be able to infer Capes\nfrom the things she had said, and indeed his face was very eager.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said.\n\nAnn Veronica blushed. \"That's all,\" she said \"I'm afraid I'm a little\nconfused about these things.\"\n\nRamage looked at her, and then fell into deep reflection as the waiter\ncame to paragraph their talk again.\n\n\"Have you ever been to the opera, Ann Veronica?\" said Ramage.\n\n\"Once or twice.\"\n\n\"Shall we go now?\"\n\n\"I think I would like to listen to music. What is there?\"\n\n\"Tristan.\"\n\n\"I've never heard Tristan and Isolde.\"\n\n\"That settles it. We'll go. There's sure to be a place somewhere.\"\n\n\"It's rather jolly of you,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"It's jolly of you to come,\" said Ramage.\n\nSo presently they got into a hansom together, and Ann Veronica sat back\nfeeling very luxurious and pleasant, and looked at the light and stir\nand misty glitter of the street traffic from under slightly drooping\neyelids, while Ramage sat closer to her than he need have done, and\nglanced ever and again at her face, and made to speak and said nothing.\nAnd when they got to Covent Garden Ramage secured one of the little\nupper boxes, and they came into it as the overture began.\n\nAnn Veronica took off her jacket and sat down in the corner chair, and\nleaned forward to look into the great hazy warm brown cavity of the\nhouse, and Ramage placed his chair to sit beside her and near her,\nfacing the stage. The music took hold of her slowly as her eyes wandered\nfrom the indistinct still ranks of the audience to the little busy\norchestra with its quivering violins, its methodical movements of brown\nand silver instruments, its brightly lit scores and shaded lights. She\nhad never been to the opera before except as one of a congested mass of\npeople in the cheaper seats, and with backs and heads and women's hats\nfor the frame of the spectacle; there was by contrast a fine large sense\nof space and ease in her present position. The curtain rose out of the\nconcluding bars of the overture and revealed Isolde on the prow of the\nbarbaric ship. The voice of the young seaman came floating down from the\nmasthead, and the story of the immortal lovers had begun. She knew\nthe story only imperfectly, and followed it now with a passionate and\ndeepening interest. The splendid voices sang on from phase to phase of\nlove's unfolding, the ship drove across the sea to the beating rhythm of\nthe rowers. The lovers broke into passionate knowledge of themselves and\neach other, and then, a jarring intervention, came King Mark amidst the\nshouts of the sailormen, and stood beside them.\n\nThe curtain came festooning slowly down, the music ceased, the lights\nin the auditorium glowed out, and Ann Veronica woke out of her confused\ndream of involuntary and commanding love in a glory of sound and colors\nto discover that Ramage was sitting close beside her with one hand\nresting lightly on her waist. She made a quick movement, and the hand\nfell away.\n\n\"By God! Ann Veronica,\" he said, sighing deeply. \"This stirs one.\"\n\nShe sat quite still looking at him.\n\n\"I wish you and I had drunk that love potion,\" he said.\n\nShe found no ready reply to that, and he went on: \"This music is the\nfood of love. It makes me desire life beyond measure. Life! Life and\nlove! It makes me want to be always young, always strong, always\ndevoting my life--and dying splendidly.\"\n\n\"It is very beautiful,\" said Ann Veronica in a low tone.\n\nThey said no more for a moment, and each was now acutely aware of the\nother. Ann Veronica was excited and puzzled, with a sense of a strange\nand disconcerting new light breaking over her relations with Ramage.\nShe had never thought of him at all in that way before. It did not shock\nher; it amazed her, interested her beyond measure. But also this must\nnot go on. She felt he was going to say something more--something\nstill more personal and intimate. She was curious, and at the same time\nclearly resolved she must not hear it. She felt she must get him talking\nupon some impersonal theme at any cost. She snatched about in her mind.\n\"What is the exact force of a motif?\" she asked at random. \"Before I\nheard much Wagnerian music I heard enthusiastic descriptions of it from\na mistress I didn't like at school. She gave me an impression of a sort\nof patched quilt; little bits of patterned stuff coming up again and\nagain.\"\n\nShe stopped with an air of interrogation.\n\nRamage looked at her for a long and discriminating interval without\nspeaking. He seemed to be hesitating between two courses of action. \"I\ndon't know much about the technique of music,\" he said at last, with his\neyes upon her. \"It's a matter of feeling with me.\"\n\nHe contradicted himself by plunging into an exposition of motifs.\n\nBy a tacit agreement they ignored the significant thing between them,\nignored the slipping away of the ground on which they had stood together\nhitherto....\n\nAll through the love music of the second act, until the hunting horns of\nMark break in upon the dream, Ann Veronica's consciousness was flooded\nwith the perception of a man close beside her, preparing some new thing\nto say to her, preparing, perhaps, to touch her, stretching hungry\ninvisible tentacles about her. She tried to think what she should do in\nthis eventuality or that. Her mind had been and was full of the thought\nof Capes, a huge generalized Capes-lover. And in some incomprehensible\nway, Ramage was confused with Capes; she had a grotesque disposition to\npersuade herself that this was really Capes who surrounded her, as it\nwere, with wings of desire. The fact that it was her trusted friend\nmaking illicit love to her remained, in spite of all her effort, an\ninsignificant thing in her mind. The music confused and distracted her,\nand made her struggle against a feeling of intoxication. Her head swam.\nThat was the inconvenience of it; her head was swimming. The music\nthrobbed into the warnings that preceded the king's irruption.\n\nAbruptly he gripped her wrist. \"I love you, Ann Veronica. I love\nyou--with all my heart and soul.\"\n\nShe put her face closer to his. She felt the warm nearness of his.\n\"DON'T!\" she said, and wrenched her wrist from his retaining hand.\n\n\"My God! Ann Veronica,\" he said, struggling to keep his hold upon her;\n\"my God! Tell me--tell me now--tell me you love me!\"\n\nHis expression was as it were rapaciously furtive. She answered in\nwhispers, for there was the white arm of a woman in the next box peeping\nbeyond the partition within a yard of him.\n\n\"My hand! This isn't the place.\"\n\nHe released her hand and talked in eager undertones against an auditory\nbackground of urgency and distress.\n\n\"Ann Veronica,\" he said, \"I tell you this is love. I love the soles of\nyour feet. I love your very breath. I have tried not to tell you--tried\nto be simply your friend. It is no good. I want you. I worship you. I\nwould do anything--I would give anything to make you mine.... Do you\nhear me? Do you hear what I am saying?... Love!\"\n\nHe held her arm and abandoned it again at her quick defensive movement.\nFor a long time neither spoke again.\n\nShe sat drawn together in her chair in the corner of the box, at a loss\nwhat to say or do--afraid, curious, perplexed. It seemed to her that\nit was her duty to get up and clamor to go home to her room, to protest\nagainst his advances as an insult. But she did not in the least want\nto do that. These sweeping dignities were not within the compass of her\nwill; she remembered she liked Ramage, and owed things to him, and she\nwas interested--she was profoundly interested. He was in love with\nher! She tried to grasp all the welter of values in the situation\nsimultaneously, and draw some conclusion from their disorder.\n\nHe began to talk again in quick undertones that she could not clearly\nhear.\n\n\"I have loved you,\" he was saying, \"ever since you sat on that gate and\ntalked. I have always loved you. I don't care what divides us. I don't\ncare what else there is in the world. I want you beyond measure or\nreckoning....\"\n\nHis voice rose and fell amidst the music and the singing of Tristan and\nKing Mark, like a voice heard in a badly connected telephone. She stared\nat his pleading face.\n\nShe turned to the stage, and Tristan was wounded in Kurvenal's arms,\nwith Isolde at his feet, and King Mark, the incarnation of masculine\nforce and obligation, the masculine creditor of love and beauty, stood\nover him, and the second climax was ending in wreaths and reek of\nmelodies; and then the curtain was coming down in a series of short\nrushes, the music had ended, and the people were stirring and breaking\nout into applause, and the lights of the auditorium were resuming. The\nlighting-up pierced the obscurity of the box, and Ramage stopped his\nurgent flow of words abruptly and sat back. This helped to restore Ann\nVeronica's self-command.\n\nShe turned her eyes to him again, and saw her late friend and pleasant\nand trusted companion, who had seen fit suddenly to change into a lover,\nbabbling interesting inacceptable things. He looked eager and flushed\nand troubled. His eyes caught at hers with passionate inquiries. \"Tell\nme,\" he said; \"speak to me.\" She realized it was possible to be sorry\nfor him--acutely sorry for the situation. Of course this thing was\nabsolutely impossible. But she was disturbed, mysteriously disturbed.\nShe remembered abruptly that she was really living upon his money. She\nleaned forward and addressed him.\n\n\"Mr. Ramage,\" she said, \"please don't talk like this.\"\n\nHe made to speak and did not.\n\n\"I don't want you to do it, to go on talking to me. I don't want to hear\nyou. If I had known that you had meant to talk like this I wouldn't have\ncome here.\"\n\n\"But how can I help it? How can I keep silence?\"\n\n\"Please!\" she insisted. \"Please not now.\"\n\n\"I MUST talk with you. I must say what I have to say!\"\n\n\"But not now--not here.\"\n\n\"It came,\" he said. \"I never planned it--And now I have begun--\"\n\nShe felt acutely that he was entitled to explanations, and as acutely\nthat explanations were impossible that night. She wanted to think.\n\n\"Mr. Ramage,\" she said, \"I can't--Not now. Will you please--Not now, or\nI must go.\"\n\nHe stared at her, trying to guess at the mystery of her thoughts.\n\n\"You don't want to go?\"\n\n\"No. But I must--I ought--\"\n\n\"I MUST talk about this. Indeed I must.\"\n\n\"Not now.\"\n\n\"But I love you. I love you--unendurably.\"\n\n\"Then don't talk to me now. I don't want you to talk to me now. There is\na place--This isn't the place. You have misunderstood. I can't explain--\"\n\nThey regarded one another, each blinded to the other. \"Forgive me,\" he\ndecided to say at last, and his voice had a little quiver of emotion,\nand he laid his hand on hers upon her knee. \"I am the most foolish of\nmen. I was stupid--stupid and impulsive beyond measure to burst upon\nyou in this way. I--I am a love-sick idiot, and not accountable for my\nactions. Will you forgive me--if I say no more?\"\n\nShe looked at him with perplexed, earnest eyes.\n\n\"Pretend,\" he said, \"that all I have said hasn't been said. And let us\ngo on with our evening. Why not? Imagine I've had a fit of hysteria--and\nthat I've come round.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, and abruptly she liked him enormously. She felt this\nwas the sensible way out of this oddly sinister situation.\n\nHe still watched her and questioned her.\n\n\"And let us have a talk about this--some other time. Somewhere, where we\ncan talk without interruption. Will you?\"\n\nShe thought, and it seemed to him she had never looked so\nself-disciplined and deliberate and beautiful. \"Yes,\" she said, \"that\nis what we ought to do.\" But now she doubted again of the quality of the\narmistice they had just made.\n\nHe had a wild impulse to shout. \"Agreed,\" he said with queer exaltation,\nand his grip tightened on her hand. \"And to-night we are friends?\"\n\n\"We are friends,\" said Ann Veronica, and drew her hand quickly away from\nhim.\n\n\"To-night we are as we have always been. Except that this music we have\nbeen swimming in is divine. While I have been pestering you, have you\nheard it? At least, you heard the first act. And all the third act is\nlove-sick music. Tristan dying and Isolde coming to crown his death.\nWagner had just been in love when he wrote it all. It begins with that\nqueer piccolo solo. Now I shall never hear it but what this evening will\ncome pouring back over me.\"\n\nThe lights sank, the prelude to the third act was beginning, the\nmusic rose and fell in crowded intimations of lovers separated--lovers\nseparated with scars and memories between them, and the curtain went\nreefing up to display Tristan lying wounded on his couch and the\nshepherd crouching with his pipe.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nThey had their explanations the next evening, but they were explanations\nin quite other terms than Ann Veronica had anticipated, quite other and\nmuch more startling and illuminating terms. Ramage came for her at her\nlodgings, and she met him graciously and kindly as a queen who knows she\nmust needs give sorrow to a faithful liege. She was unusually soft\nand gentle in her manner to him. He was wearing a new silk hat, with a\nslightly more generous brim than its predecessor, and it suited his type\nof face, robbed his dark eyes a little of their aggressiveness and gave\nhim a solid and dignified and benevolent air. A faint anticipation of\ntriumph showed in his manner and a subdued excitement.\n\n\"We'll go to a place where we can have a private room,\" he said.\n\"Then--then we can talk things out.\"\n\nSo they went this time to the Rococo, in Germain Street, and up-stairs\nto a landing upon which stood a bald-headed waiter with whiskers like a\nFrench admiral and discretion beyond all limits in his manner. He seemed\nto have expected them. He ushered them with an amiable flat hand into a\nminute apartment with a little gas-stove, a silk crimson-covered sofa,\nand a bright little table, gay with napery and hot-house flowers.\n\n\"Odd little room,\" said Ann Veronica, dimly apprehending that obtrusive\nsofa.\n\n\"One can talk without undertones, so to speak,\" said Ramage.\n\"It's--private.\" He stood looking at the preparations before them with\nan unusual preoccupation of manner, then roused himself to take her\njacket, a little awkwardly, and hand it to the waiter who hung it in the\ncorner of the room. It appeared he had already ordered dinner and\nwine, and the whiskered waiter waved in his subordinate with the soup\nforthwith.\n\n\"I'm going to talk of indifferent themes,\" said Ramage, a little\nfussily, \"until these interruptions of the service are over. Then--then\nwe shall be together.... How did you like Tristan?\"\n\nAnn Veronica paused the fraction of a second before her reply came.\n\n\"I thought much of it amazingly beautiful.\"\n\n\"Isn't it. And to think that man got it all out of the poorest little\nlove-story for a respectable titled lady! Have you read of it?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"It gives in a nutshell the miracle of art and the imagination. You get\nthis queer irascible musician quite impossibly and unfortunately in\nlove with a wealthy patroness, and then out of his brain comes THIS, a\ntapestry of glorious music, setting out love to lovers, lovers who love\nin spite of all that is wise and respectable and right.\"\n\nAnn Veronica thought. She did not want to seem to shrink from\nconversation, but all sorts of odd questions were running through her\nmind. \"I wonder why people in love are so defiant, so careless of other\nconsiderations?\"\n\n\"The very hares grow brave. I suppose because it IS the chief thing in\nlife.\" He stopped and said earnestly: \"It is the chief thing in\nlife, and everything else goes down before it. Everything, my dear,\neverything!... But we have got to talk upon indifferent themes until\nwe have done with this blond young gentleman from Bavaria....\"\n\nThe dinner came to an end at last, and the whiskered waiter presented\nhis bill and evacuated the apartment and closed the door behind him with\nan almost ostentatious discretion. Ramage stood up, and suddenly turned\nthe key in the door in an off-hand manner. \"Now,\" he said, \"no one can\nblunder in upon us. We are alone and we can say and do what we please.\nWe two.\" He stood still, looking at her.\n\nAnn Veronica tried to seem absolutely unconcerned. The turning of the\nkey startled her, but she did not see how she could make an objection.\nShe felt she had stepped into a world of unknown usages.\n\n\"I have waited for this,\" he said, and stood quite still, looking at her\nuntil the silence became oppressive.\n\n\"Won't you sit down,\" she said, \"and tell me what you want to say?\" Her\nvoice was flat and faint. Suddenly she had become afraid. She struggled\nnot to be afraid. After all, what could happen?\n\nHe was looking at her very hard and earnestly. \"Ann Veronica,\" he said.\n\nThen before she could say a word to arrest him he was at her side.\n\"Don't!\" she said, weakly, as he had bent down and put one arm about her\nand seized her hands with his disengaged hand and kissed her--kissed her\nalmost upon her lips. He seemed to do ten things before she could think\nto do one, to leap upon her and take possession.\n\nAnn Veronica's universe, which had never been altogether so respectful\nto her as she could have wished, gave a shout and whirled head over\nheels. Everything in the world had changed for her. If hate could kill,\nRamage would have been killed by a flash of hate. \"Mr. Ramage!\" she\ncried, and struggled to her feet.\n\n\"My darling!\" he said, clasping her resolutely in his arms, \"my\ndearest!\"\n\n\"Mr. Ramage!\" she began, and his mouth sealed hers and his breath was\nmixed with her breath. Her eye met his four inches away, and his was\nglaring, immense, and full of resolution, a stupendous monster of an\neye.\n\nShe shut her lips hard, her jaw hardened, and she set herself to\nstruggle with him. She wrenched her head away from his grip and got her\narm between his chest and hers. They began to wrestle fiercely. Each\nbecame frightfully aware of the other as a plastic energetic body,\nof the strong muscles of neck against cheek, of hands gripping\nshoulder-blade and waist. \"How dare you!\" she panted, with her world\nscreaming and grimacing insult at her. \"How dare you!\"\n\nThey were both astonished at the other's strength. Perhaps Ramage was\nthe more astonished. Ann Veronica had been an ardent hockey player and\nhad had a course of jiu-jitsu in the High School. Her defence ceased\nrapidly to be in any sense ladylike, and became vigorous and effective;\na strand of black hair that had escaped its hairpins came athwart\nRamage's eyes, and then the knuckles of a small but very hardly clinched\nfist had thrust itself with extreme effectiveness and painfulness under\nhis jawbone and ear.\n\n\"Let go!\" said Ann Veronica, through her teeth, strenuously inflicting\nagony, and he cried out sharply and let go and receded a pace.\n\n\"NOW!\" said Ann Veronica. \"Why did you dare to do that?\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nEach of them stared at the other, set in a universe that had changed its\nsystem of values with kaleidoscopic completeness. She was flushed, and\nher eyes were bright and angry; her breath came sobbing, and her hair\nwas all abroad in wandering strands of black. He too was flushed and\nruffled; one side of his collar had slipped from its stud and he held a\nhand to the corner of his jaw.\n\n\"You vixen!\" said Mr. Ramage, speaking the simplest first thought of his\nheart.\n\n\"You had no right--\" panted Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Why on earth,\" he asked, \"did you hurt me like that?\"\n\nAnn Veronica did her best to think she had not deliberately attempted to\ncause him pain. She ignored his question.\n\n\"I never dreamt!\" she said.\n\n\"What on earth did you expect me to do, then?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nInterpretation came pouring down upon her almost blindingly; she\nunderstood now the room, the waiter, the whole situation. She\nunderstood. She leaped to a world of shabby knowledge, of furtive base\nrealizations. She wanted to cry out upon herself for the uttermost fool\nin existence.\n\n\"I thought you wanted to have a talk to me,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted to make love to you.\n\n\"You knew it,\" he added, in her momentary silence.\n\n\"You said you were in love with me,\" said Ann Veronica; \"I wanted to\nexplain--\"\n\n\"I said I loved and wanted you.\" The brutality of his first astonishment\nwas evaporating. \"I am in love with you. You know I am in love with you.\nAnd then you go--and half throttle me.... I believe you've crushed a\ngland or something. It feels like it.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Ann Veronica. \"What else was I to do?\"\n\nFor some seconds she stood watching him and both were thinking very\nquickly. Her state of mind would have seemed altogether discreditable to\nher grandmother. She ought to have been disposed to faint and scream at\nall these happenings; she ought to have maintained a front of outraged\ndignity to veil the sinking of her heart. I would like to have to tell\nit so. But indeed that is not at all a good description of her attitude.\nShe was an indignant queen, no doubt she was alarmed and disgusted\nwithin limits; but she was highly excited, and there was something, some\nlow adventurous strain in her being, some element, subtle at least if\nbase, going about the rioting ways and crowded insurgent meeting-places\nof her mind declaring that the whole affair was after all--they are the\nonly words that express it--a very great lark indeed. At the bottom\nof her heart she was not a bit afraid of Ramage. She had unaccountable\ngleams of sympathy with and liking for him. And the grotesquest fact\nwas that she did not so much loathe, as experience with a quite critical\ncondemnation this strange sensation of being kissed. Never before had\nany human being kissed her lips....\n\nIt was only some hours after that these ambiguous elements evaporated\nand vanished and loathing came, and she really began to be thoroughly\nsick and ashamed of the whole disgraceful quarrel and scuffle.\n\nHe, for his part, was trying to grasp the series of unexpected reactions\nthat had so wrecked their tete-a-tete. He had meant to be master of his\nfate that evening and it had escaped him altogether. It had, as it were,\nblown up at the concussion of his first step. It dawned upon him that he\nhad been abominably used by Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"I brought you here to make love to you.\"\n\n\"I didn't understand--your idea of making love. You had better let me go\nagain.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"I do love you. I love you all the more for the\nstreak of sheer devil in you.... You are the most beautiful, the most\ndesirable thing I have ever met in this world. It was good to kiss you,\neven at the price. But, by Jove! you are fierce! You are like those\nRoman women who carry stilettos in their hair.\"\n\n\"I came here to talk reasonably, Mr. Ramage. It is abominable--\"\n\n\"What is the use of keeping up this note of indignation, Ann Veronica?\nHere I am! I am your lover, burning for you. I mean to have you! Don't\nfrown me off now. Don't go back into Victorian respectability and\npretend you don't know and you can't think and all the rest of it. One\ncomes at last to the step from dreams to reality. This is your moment.\nNo one will ever love you as I love you now. I have been dreaming of\nyour body and you night after night. I have been imaging--\"\n\n\"Mr. Ramage, I came here--I didn't suppose for one moment you would\ndare--\"\n\n\"Nonsense! That is your mistake! You are too intellectual. You want to\ndo everything with your mind. You are afraid of kisses. You are afraid\nof the warmth in your blood. It's just because all that side of your\nlife hasn't fairly begun.\"\n\nHe made a step toward her.\n\n\"Mr. Ramage,\" she said, sharply, \"I have to make it plain to you. I\ndon't think you understand. I don't love you. I don't. I can't love you.\nI love some one else. It is repulsive. It disgusts me that you should\ntouch me.\"\n\nHe stared in amazement at this new aspect of the situation. \"You love\nsome one else?\" he repeated.\n\n\"I love some one else. I could not dream of loving you.\"\n\nAnd then he flashed his whole conception of the relations of men and\nwomen upon her in one astonishing question. His hand went with an almost\ninstinctive inquiry to his jawbone again. \"Then why the devil,\" he\ndemanded, \"do you let me stand you dinners and the opera--and why do you\ncome to a cabinet particuliar with me?\"\n\nHe became radiant with anger. \"You mean to tell me\" he said, \"that you\nhave a lover? While I have been keeping you! Yes--keeping you!\"\n\nThis view of life he hurled at her as if it were an offensive missile.\nIt stunned her. She felt she must fly before it and could no longer do\nso. She did not think for one moment what interpretation he might put\nupon the word \"lover.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ramage,\" she said, clinging to her one point, \"I want to get out of\nthis horrible little room. It has all been a mistake. I have been stupid\nand foolish. Will you unlock that door?\"\n\n\"Never!\" he said. \"Confound your lover! Look here! Do you really think\nI am going to run you while he makes love to you? No fear! I never heard\nof anything so cool. If he wants you, let him get you. You're mine. I've\npaid for you and helped you, and I'm going to conquer you somehow--if\nI have to break you to do it. Hitherto you've seen only my easy, kindly\nside. But now confound it! how can you prevent it? I will kiss you.\"\n\n\"You won't!\" said Ann Veronica; with the clearest note of determination.\n\nHe seemed to be about to move toward her. She stepped back quickly, and\nher hand knocked a wine-glass from the table to smash noisily on the\nfloor. She caught at the idea. \"If you come a step nearer to me,\" she\nsaid, \"I will smash every glass on this table.\"\n\n\"Then, by God!\" he said, \"you'll be locked up!\"\n\nAnn Veronica was disconcerted for a moment. She had a vision of\npolicemen, reproving magistrates, a crowded court, public disgrace. She\nsaw her aunt in tears, her father white-faced and hard hit. \"Don't come\nnearer!\" she said.\n\nThere was a discreet knocking at the door, and Ramage's face changed.\n\n\"No,\" she said, under her breath, \"you can't face it.\" And she knew that\nshe was safe.\n\nHe went to the door. \"It's all right,\" he said, reassuringly to the\ninquirer without.\n\nAnn Veronica glanced at the mirror to discover a flushed and dishevelled\ndisorder. She began at once a hasty readjustment of her hair, while\nRamage parleyed with inaudible interrogations. \"A glass slipped from the\ntable,\" he explained.... \"Non. Fas du tout. Non.... Niente.... Bitte!...\nOui, dans la note.... Presently. Presently.\" That conversation ended and\nhe turned to her again.\n\n\"I am going,\" she said grimly, with three hairpins in her mouth.\n\nShe took her hat from the peg in the corner and began to put it on. He\nregarded that perennial miracle of pinning with wrathful eyes.\n\n\"Look here, Ann Veronica,\" he began. \"I want a plain word with you about\nall this. Do you mean to tell me you didn't understand why I wanted you\nto come here?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Ann Veronica stoutly.\n\n\"You didn't expect that I should kiss you?\"\n\n\"How was I to know that a man would--would think it was possible--when\nthere was nothing--no love?\"\n\n\"How did I know there wasn't love?\"\n\nThat silenced her for a moment. \"And what on earth,\" he said, \"do you\nthink the world is made of? Why do you think I have been doing things\nfor you? The abstract pleasure of goodness? Are you one of the members\nof that great white sisterhood that takes and does not give? The good\naccepting woman! Do you really suppose a girl is entitled to live at\nfree quarters on any man she meets without giving any return?\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said Ann Veronica, \"you were my friend.\"\n\n\"Friend! What have a man and a girl in common to make them friends? Ask\nthat lover of yours! And even with friends, would you have it all Give\non one side and all Take on the other?... Does HE know I keep you?...\nYou won't have a man's lips near you, but you'll eat out of his hand\nfast enough.\"\n\nAnn Veronica was stung to helpless anger.\n\n\"Mr. Ramage,\" she cried, \"you are outrageous! You understand nothing.\nYou are--horrible. Will you let me go out of this room?\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Ramage; \"hear me out! I'll have that satisfaction, anyhow.\nYou women, with your tricks of evasion, you're a sex of swindlers.\nYou have all the instinctive dexterity of parasites. You make yourself\ncharming for help. You climb by disappointing men. This lover of\nyours--\"\n\n\"He doesn't know!\" cried Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Well, you know.\"\n\nAnn Veronica could have wept with vexation. Indeed, a note of weeping\nbroke her voice for a moment as she burst out, \"You know as well as I do\nthat money was a loan!\"\n\n\"Loan!\"\n\n\"You yourself called it a loan!\"\n\n\"Euphuism. We both understood that.\"\n\n\"You shall have every penny of it back.\"\n\n\"I'll frame it--when I get it.\"\n\n\"I'll pay you if I have to work at shirt-making at threepence an hour.\"\n\n\"You'll never pay me. You think you will. It's your way of glossing over\nthe ethical position. It's the sort of way a woman always does gloss\nover her ethical positions. You're all dependents--all of you. By\ninstinct. Only you good ones--shirk. You shirk a straightforward and\ndecent return for what you get from us--taking refuge in purity and\ndelicacy and such-like when it comes to payment.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ramage,\" said Ann Veronica, \"I want to go--NOW!\"\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nBut she did not get away just then.\n\nRamage's bitterness passed as abruptly as his aggression. \"Oh,\nAnn Veronica!\" he cried, \"I cannot let you go like this! You don't\nunderstand. You can't possibly understand!\"\n\nHe began a confused explanation, a perplexing contradictory apology for\nhis urgency and wrath. He loved Ann Veronica, he said; he was so mad\nto have her that he defeated himself, and did crude and alarming and\nsenseless things. His vicious abusiveness vanished. He suddenly became\neloquent and plausible. He did make her perceive something of the acute,\ntormenting desire for her that had arisen in him and possessed him.\nShe stood, as it were, directed doorward, with her eyes watching every\nmovement, listening to him, repelled by him and yet dimly understanding.\n\nAt any rate he made it very clear that night that there was an\nineradicable discord in life, a jarring something that must shatter all\nher dreams of a way of living for women that would enable them to be\nfree and spacious and friendly with men, and that was the passionate\npredisposition of men to believe that the love of women can be earned\nand won and controlled and compelled.\n\nHe flung aside all his talk of help and disinterested friendship as\nthough it had never been even a disguise between them, as though\nfrom the first it was no more than a fancy dress they had put quite\nunderstandingly upon their relationship. He had set out to win her, and\nshe had let him start. And at the thought of that other lover--he was\nconvinced that that beloved person was a lover, and she found herself\nunable to say a word to explain to him that this other person, the\nperson she loved, did not even know of her love--Ramage grew angry\nand savage once more, and returned suddenly to gibe and insult. Men do\nservices for the love of women, and the woman who takes must pay. Such\nwas the simple code that displayed itself in all his thoughts. He left\nthat arid rule clear of the least mist of refinement or delicacy.\n\nThat he should pay forty pounds to help this girl who preferred another\nman was no less in his eyes than a fraud and mockery that made her\ndenial a maddening and outrageous disgrace to him. And this though he\nwas evidently passionately in love with her.\n\nFor a while he threatened her. \"You have put all your life in my hands,\"\nhe declared. \"Think of that check you endorsed. There it is--against\nyou. I defy you to explain it away. What do you think people will make\nof that? What will this lover of yours make of that?\"\n\nAt intervals Ann Veronica demanded to go, declaring her undying resolve\nto repay him at any cost, and made short movements doorward.\n\nBut at last this ordeal was over, and Ramage opened the door. She\nemerged with a white face and wide-open eyes upon a little, red-lit\nlanding. She went past three keenly observant and ostentatiously\npreoccupied waiters down the thick-carpeted staircase and out of the\nHotel Rococo, that remarkable laboratory of relationships, past a tall\nporter in blue and crimson, into a cool, clear night.\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nWhen Ann Veronica reached her little bed-sitting-room again, every nerve\nin her body was quivering with shame and self-disgust.\n\nShe threw hat and coat on the bed and sat down before the fire.\n\n\"And now,\" she said, splintering the surviving piece of coal into\nindignant flame-spurting fragments with one dexterous blow, \"what am I\nto do?\n\n\"I'm in a hole!--mess is a better word, expresses it better. I'm in a\nmess--a nasty mess! a filthy mess! Oh, no end of a mess!\n\n\"Do you hear, Ann Veronica?--you're in a nasty, filthy, unforgivable\nmess!\n\n\"Haven't I just made a silly mess of things?\n\n\"Forty pounds! I haven't got twenty!\"\n\nShe got up, stamped with her foot, and then, suddenly remembering the\nlodger below, sat down and wrenched off her boots.\n\n\"This is what comes of being a young woman up to date. By Jove! I'm\nbeginning to have my doubts about freedom!\n\n\"You silly young woman, Ann Veronica! You silly young woman! The\nsmeariness of the thing!\n\n\"The smeariness of this sort of thing!... Mauled about!\"\n\nShe fell to rubbing her insulted lips savagely with the back of her\nhand. \"Ugh!\" she said.\n\n\"The young women of Jane Austen's time didn't get into this sort of\nscrape! At least--one thinks so.... I wonder if some of them did--and\nit didn't get reported. Aunt Jane had her quiet moments. Most of\nthem didn't, anyhow. They were properly brought up, and sat still and\nstraight, and took the luck fate brought them as gentlewomen should.\nAnd they had an idea of what men were like behind all their nicety. They\nknew they were all Bogey in disguise. I didn't! I didn't! After all--\"\n\nFor a time her mind ran on daintiness and its defensive restraints\nas though it was the one desirable thing. That world of fine printed\ncambrics and escorted maidens, of delicate secondary meanings and\nrefined allusiveness, presented itself to her imagination with the\nbrightness of a lost paradise, as indeed for many women it is a lost\nparadise.\n\n\"I wonder if there is anything wrong with my manners,\" she said. \"I\nwonder if I've been properly brought up. If I had been quite quiet and\nwhite and dignified, wouldn't it have been different? Would he have\ndared?...\"\n\nFor some creditable moments in her life Ann Veronica was utterly\ndisgusted with herself; she was wrung with a passionate and belated\ndesire to move gently, to speak softly and ambiguously--to be, in\neffect, prim.\n\nHorrible details recurred to her.\n\n\"Why, among other things, did I put my knuckles in his\nneck--deliberately to hurt him?\"\n\nShe tried to sound the humorous note.\n\n\"Are you aware, Ann Veronica, you nearly throttled that gentleman?\"\n\nThen she reviled her own foolish way of putting it.\n\n\"You ass and imbecile, Ann Veronica! You female cad! Cad! Cad!... Why\naren't you folded up clean in lavender--as every young woman ought to\nbe? What have you been doing with yourself?...\"\n\nShe raked into the fire with the poker.\n\n\"All of which doesn't help me in the slightest degree to pay back that\nmoney.\"\n\nThat night was the most intolerable one that Ann Veronica had ever\nspent. She washed her face with unwonted elaboration before she went\nto bed. This time, there was no doubt, she did not sleep. The more\nshe disentangled the lines of her situation the deeper grew her\nself-disgust. Occasionally the mere fact of lying in bed became\nunendurable, and she rolled out and marched about her room and whispered\nabuse of herself--usually until she hit against some article of\nfurniture.\n\nThen she would have quiet times, in which she would say to herself, \"Now\nlook here! Let me think it all out!\"\n\nFor the first time, it seemed to her, she faced the facts of a woman's\nposition in the world--the meagre realities of such freedom as it\npermitted her, the almost unavoidable obligation to some individual man\nunder which she must labor for even a foothold in the world. She had\nflung away from her father's support with the finest assumption of\npersonal independence. And here she was--in a mess because it had\nbeen impossible for her to avoid leaning upon another man. She had\nthought--What had she thought? That this dependence of women was but\nan illusion which needed only to be denied to vanish. She had denied it\nwith vigor, and here she was!\n\nShe did not so much exhaust this general question as pass from it to her\ninsoluble individual problem again: \"What am I to do?\"\n\nShe wanted first of all to fling the forty pounds back into Ramage's\nface. But she had spent nearly half of it, and had no conception of how\nsuch a sum could be made good again. She thought of all sorts of odd and\ndesperate expedients, and with passionate petulance rejected them all.\n\nShe took refuge in beating her pillow and inventing insulting epithets\nfor herself. She got up, drew up her blind, and stared out of window at\na dawn-cold vision of chimneys for a time, and then went and sat on the\nedge of her bed. What was the alternative to going home? No alternative\nappeared in that darkness.\n\nIt seemed intolerable that she should go home and admit herself beaten.\nShe did most urgently desire to save her face in Morningside Park, and\nfor long hours she could think of no way of putting it that would not be\nin the nature of unconditional admission of defeat.\n\n\"I'd rather go as a chorus-girl,\" she said.\n\nShe was not very clear about the position and duties of a chorus-girl,\nbut it certainly had the air of being a last desperate resort.\nThere sprang from that a vague hope that perhaps she might extort a\ncapitulation from her father by a threat to seek that position, and then\nwith overwhelming clearness it came to her that whatever happened she\nwould never be able to tell her father about her debt. The completest\ncapitulation would not wipe out that trouble. And she felt that if she\nwent home it was imperative to pay. She would always be going to and fro\nup the Avenue, getting glimpses of Ramage, seeing him in trains....\n\nFor a time she promenaded the room.\n\n\"Why did I ever take that loan? An idiot girl in an asylum would have\nknown better than that!\n\n\"Vulgarity of soul and innocence of mind--the worst of all conceivable\ncombinations. I wish some one would kill Ramage by accident!...\n\n\"But then they would find that check endorsed in his bureau....\n\n\"I wonder what he will do?\" She tried to imagine situations that might\narise out of Ramage's antagonism, for he had been so bitter and savage\nthat she could not believe that he would leave things as they were.\n\nThe next morning she went out with her post-office savings bank-book,\nand telegraphed for a warrant to draw out all the money she had in the\nworld. It amounted to two-and-twenty pounds. She addressed an envelope\nto Ramage, and scrawled on a half-sheet of paper, \"The rest shall\nfollow.\" The money would be available in the afternoon, and she would\nsend him four five-pound notes. The rest she meant to keep for\nher immediate necessities. A little relieved by this step toward\nreinstatement, she went on to the Imperial College to forget her muddle\nof problems for a time, if she could, in the presence of Capes.\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nFor a time the biological laboratory was full of healing virtue. Her\nsleepless night had left her languid but not stupefied, and for an hour\nor so the work distracted her altogether from her troubles.\n\nThen, after Capes had been through her work and had gone on, it came to\nher that the fabric of this life of hers was doomed to almost immediate\ncollapse; that in a little while these studies would cease, and perhaps\nshe would never set eyes on him again. After that consolations fled.\n\nThe overnight nervous strain began to tell; she became inattentive\nto the work before her, and it did not get on. She felt sleepy and\nunusually irritable. She lunched at a creamery in Great Portland Street,\nand as the day was full of wintry sunshine, spent the rest of the\nlunch-hour in a drowsy gloom, which she imagined to be thought upon the\nproblems of her position, on a seat in Regent's Park. A girl of fifteen\nor sixteen gave her a handbill that she regarded as a tract until she\nsaw \"Votes for Women\" at the top. That turned her mind to the more\ngeneralized aspects of her perplexities again. She had never been so\ndisposed to agree that the position of women in the modern world is\nintolerable.\n\nCapes joined the students at tea, and displayed himself in an impish\nmood that sometimes possessed him. He did not notice that Ann Veronica\nwas preoccupied and heavy-eyed. Miss Klegg raised the question of\nwomen's suffrage, and he set himself to provoke a duel between her and\nMiss Garvice. The youth with the hair brushed back and the spectacled\nScotchman joined in the fray for and against the women's vote.\n\nEver and again Capes appealed to Ann Veronica. He liked to draw her in,\nand she did her best to talk. But she did not talk readily, and in\norder to say something she plunged a little, and felt she plunged.\nCapes scored back with an uncompromising vigor that was his way of\ncomplimenting her intelligence. But this afternoon it discovered an\nunusual vein of irritability in her. He had been reading Belfort Bax,\nand declared himself a convert. He contrasted the lot of women in\ngeneral with the lot of men, presented men as patient, self-immolating\nmartyrs, and women as the pampered favorites of Nature. A vein of\nconviction mingled with his burlesque.\n\nFor a time he and Miss Klegg contradicted one another.\n\nThe question ceased to be a tea-table talk, and became suddenly\ntragically real for Ann Veronica. There he sat, cheerfully friendly\nin his sex's freedom--the man she loved, the one man she cared\nshould unlock the way to the wide world for her imprisoned feminine\npossibilities, and he seemed regardless that she stifled under his eyes;\nhe made a jest of all this passionate insurgence of the souls of women\nagainst the fate of their conditions.\n\nMiss Garvice repeated again, and almost in the same words she used at\nevery discussion, her contribution to the great question.\n\nShe thought that women were not made for the struggle and turmoil of\nlife--their place was the little world, the home; that their power lay\nnot in votes but in influence over men and in making the minds of their\nchildren fine and splendid.\n\n\"Women should understand men's affairs, perhaps,\" said Miss Garvice,\n\"but to mingle in them is just to sacrifice that power of influencing\nthey can exercise now.\"\n\n\"There IS something sound in that position,\" said Capes, intervening as\nif to defend Miss Garvice against a possible attack from Ann Veronica.\n\"It may not be just and so forth, but, after all, it is how things are.\nWomen are not in the world in the same sense that men are--fighting\nindividuals in a scramble. I don't see how they can be. Every home is a\nlittle recess, a niche, out of the world of business and competition, in\nwhich women and the future shelter.\"\n\n\"A little pit!\" said Ann Veronica; \"a little prison!\"\n\n\"It's just as often a little refuge. Anyhow, that is how things are.\"\n\n\"And the man stands as the master at the mouth of the den.\"\n\n\"As sentinel. You forget all the mass of training and tradition and\ninstinct that go to make him a tolerable master. Nature is a mother; her\nsympathies have always been feminist, and she has tempered the man to\nthe shorn woman.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Ann Veronica, with sudden anger, \"that you could know\nwhat it is to live in a pit!\"\n\nShe stood up as she spoke, and put down her cup beside Miss Garvice's.\nShe addressed Capes as though she spoke to him alone.\n\n\"I can't endure it,\" she said.\n\nEvery one turned to her in astonishment.\n\nShe felt she had to go on. \"No man can realize,\" she said, \"what that\npit can be. The way--the way we are led on! We are taught to believe we\nare free in the world, to think we are queens.... Then we find out.\nWe find out no man will treat a woman fairly as man to man--no man. He\nwants you--or he doesn't; and then he helps some other woman against\nyou.... What you say is probably all true and necessary.... But\nthink of the disillusionment! Except for our sex we have minds like men,\ndesires like men. We come out into the world, some of us--\"\n\nShe paused. Her words, as she said them, seemed to her to mean nothing,\nand there was so much that struggled for expression. \"Women are mocked,\"\nshe said. \"Whenever they try to take hold of life a man intervenes.\"\n\nShe felt, with a sudden horror, that she might weep. She wished she had\nnot stood up. She wondered wildly why she had stood up. No one spoke,\nand she was impelled to flounder on. \"Think of the mockery!\" she said.\n\"Think how dumb we find ourselves and stifled! I know we seem to have\na sort of freedom.... Have you ever tried to run and jump in\npetticoats, Mr. Capes? Well, think what it must be to live in them--soul\nand mind and body! It's fun for a man to jest at our position.\"\n\n\"I wasn't jesting,\" said Capes, abruptly.\n\nShe stood face to face with him, and his voice cut across her speech\nand made her stop abruptly. She was sore and overstrung, and it was\nintolerable to her that he should stand within three yards of her\nunsuspectingly, with an incalculably vast power over her happiness. She\nwas sore with the perplexities of her preposterous position. She was\nsick of herself, of her life, of everything but him; and for him all her\nmasked and hidden being was crying out.\n\nShe stopped abruptly at the sound of his voice, and lost the thread\nof what she was saying. In the pause she realized the attention of the\nothers converged upon her, and that the tears were brimming over her\neyes. She felt a storm of emotion surging up within her. She became\naware of the Scotch student regarding her with stupendous amazement,\na tea-cup poised in one hairy hand and his faceted glasses showing a\nvarious enlargement of segments of his eye.\n\nThe door into the passage offered itself with an irresistible\ninvitation--the one alternative to a public, inexplicable passion of\nweeping.\n\nCapes flashed to an understanding of her intention, sprang to his feet,\nand opened the door for her retreat.\n\n\n\nPart 8\n\n\n\"Why should I ever come back?\" she said to herself, as she went down the\nstaircase.\n\nShe went to the post-office and drew out and sent off her money\nto Ramage. And then she came out into the street, sure only of one\nthing--that she could not return directly to her lodgings. She wanted\nair--and the distraction of having moving and changing things about her.\nThe evenings were beginning to draw out, and it would not be dark for\nan hour. She resolved to walk across the Park to the Zoological gardens,\nand so on by way of Primrose Hill to Hampstead Heath. There she would\nwander about in the kindly darkness. And think things out....\n\nPresently she became aware of footsteps hurrying after her, and glanced\nback to find Miss Klegg, a little out of breath, in pursuit.\n\nAnn Veronica halted a pace, and Miss Klegg came alongside.\n\n\"Do YOU go across the Park?\"\n\n\"Not usually. But I'm going to-day. I want a walk.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised at it. I thought Mr. Capes most trying.\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't that. I've had a headache all day.\"\n\n\"I thought Mr. Capes most unfair,\" Miss Klegg went on in a small, even\nvoice; \"MOST unfair! I'm glad you spoke out as you did.\"\n\n\"I didn't mind that little argument.\"\n\n\"You gave it him well. What you said wanted saying. After you went he\ngot up and took refuge in the preparation-room. Or else _I_ would have\nfinished him.\"\n\nAnn Veronica said nothing, and Miss Klegg went on: \"He very often\nIS--most unfair. He has a way of sitting on people. He wouldn't like it\nif people did it to him. He jumps the words out of your mouth; he takes\nhold of what you have to say before you have had time to express it\nproperly.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"I suppose he's frightfully clever,\" said Miss Klegg.\n\n\"He's a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he can't be much over thirty,\"\nsaid Miss Klegg.\n\n\"He writes very well,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"He can't be more than thirty. He must have married when he was quite a\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"Married?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Didn't you know he was married?\" asked Miss Klegg, and was struck by a\nthought that made her glance quickly at her companion.\n\nAnn Veronica had no answer for a moment. She turned her head away\nsharply. Some automaton within her produced in a quite unfamiliar voice\nthe remark, \"They're playing football.\"\n\n\"It's too far for the ball to reach us,\" said Miss Klegg.\n\n\"I didn't know Mr. Capes was married,\" said Ann Veronica, resuming the\nconversation with an entire disappearance of her former lassitude.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Miss Klegg; \"I thought every one knew.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ann Veronica, offhandedly. \"Never heard anything of it.\"\n\n\"I thought every one knew. I thought every one had heard about it.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"He's married--and, I believe, living separated from his wife. There was\na case, or something, some years ago.\"\n\n\"What case?\"\n\n\"A divorce--or something--I don't know. But I have heard that he almost\nhad to leave the schools. If it hadn't been for Professor Russell\nstanding up for him, they say he would have had to leave.\"\n\n\"Was he divorced, do you mean?\"\n\n\"No, but he got himself mixed up in a divorce case. I forget the\nparticulars, but I know it was something very disagreeable. It was among\nartistic people.\"\n\nAnn Veronica was silent for a while.\n\n\"I thought every one had heard,\" said Miss Klegg. \"Or I wouldn't have\nsaid anything about it.\"\n\n\"I suppose all men,\" said Ann Veronica, in a tone of detached criticism,\n\"get some such entanglement. And, anyhow, it doesn't matter to us.\" She\nturned abruptly at right angles to the path they followed. \"This is my\nway back to my side of the Park,\" she said.\n\n\"I thought you were coming right across the Park.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Ann Veronica; \"I have some work to do. I just wanted a\nbreath of air. And they'll shut the gates presently. It's not far from\ntwilight.\"\n\n\n\n\nPart 9\n\n\nShe was sitting brooding over her fire about ten o'clock that night when\na sealed and registered envelope was brought up to her.\n\nShe opened it and drew out a letter, and folded within it were the notes\nshe had sent off to Ramage that day. The letter began:\n\n\n\"MY DEAREST GIRL,--I cannot let you do this foolish thing--\"\n\n\nShe crumpled notes and letter together in her hand, and then with a\npassionate gesture flung them into the fire. Instantly she seized the\npoker and made a desperate effort to get them out again. But she was\nonly able to save a corner of the letter. The twenty pounds burned with\navidity.\n\nShe remained for some seconds crouching at the fender, poker in hand.\n\n\"By Jove!\" she said, standing up at last, \"that about finishes it, Ann\nVeronica!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TENTH\n\nTHE SUFFRAGETTES\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\n\"There is only one way out of all this,\" said Ann Veronica, sitting up\nin her little bed in the darkness and biting at her nails.\n\n\"I thought I was just up against Morningside Park and father, but it's\nthe whole order of things--the whole blessed order of things....\"\n\nShe shivered. She frowned and gripped her hands about her knees very\ntightly. Her mind developed into savage wrath at the present conditions\nof a woman's life.\n\n\"I suppose all life is an affair of chances. But a woman's life is all\nchance. It's artificially chance. Find your man, that's the rule. All\nthe rest is humbug and delicacy. He's the handle of life for you. He\nwill let you live if it pleases him....\n\n\"Can't it be altered?\n\n\"I suppose an actress is free?...\"\n\nShe tried to think of some altered state of affairs in which these\nmonstrous limitations would be alleviated, in which women would stand on\ntheir own feet in equal citizenship with men. For a time she brooded on\nthe ideals and suggestions of the Socialists, on the vague intimations\nof an Endowment of Motherhood, of a complete relaxation of that intense\nindividual dependence for women which is woven into the existing social\norder. At the back of her mind there seemed always one irrelevant\nqualifying spectator whose presence she sought to disregard. She would\nnot look at him, would not think of him; when her mind wavered, then\nshe muttered to herself in the darkness so as to keep hold of her\ngeneralizations.\n\n\"It is true. It is no good waiving the thing; it is true. Unless women\nare never to be free, never to be even respected, there must be a\ngeneration of martyrs.... Why shouldn't we be martyrs? There's\nnothing else for most of us, anyhow. It's a sort of blacklegging to want\nto have a life of one's own....\"\n\nShe repeated, as if she answered an objector: \"A sort of blacklegging.\n\n\"A sex of blacklegging clients.\"\n\nHer mind diverged to other aspects, and another type of womanhood.\n\n\"Poor little Miniver! What can she be but what she is?... Because\nshe states her case in a tangle, drags it through swamps of nonsense, it\ndoesn't alter the fact that she is right.\"\n\nThat phrase about dragging the truth through swamps of nonsense she\nremembered from Capes. At the recollection that it was his, she seemed\nto fall through a thin surface, as one might fall through the crust of\na lava into glowing depths. She wallowed for a time in the thought of\nCapes, unable to escape from his image and the idea of his presence in\nher life.\n\nShe let her mind run into dreams of that cloud paradise of an altered\nworld in which the Goopes and Minivers, the Fabians and reforming people\nbelieved. Across that world was written in letters of light, \"Endowment\nof Motherhood.\" Suppose in some complex yet conceivable way women were\nendowed, were no longer economically and socially dependent on men. \"If\none was free,\" she said, \"one could go to him.... This vile hovering\nto catch a man's eye!... One could go to him and tell him one loved\nhim. I want to love him. A little love from him would be enough. It\nwould hurt no one. It would not burden him with any obligation.\"\n\nShe groaned aloud and bowed her forehead to her knees. She floundered\ndeep. She wanted to kiss his feet. His feet would have the firm texture\nof his hands.\n\nThen suddenly her spirit rose in revolt. \"I will not have this slavery,\"\nshe said. \"I will not have this slavery.\"\n\nShe shook her fist ceilingward. \"Do you hear!\" she said \"whatever you\nare, wherever you are! I will not be slave to the thought of any man,\nslave to the customs of any time. Confound this slavery of sex! I am a\nman! I will get this under if I am killed in doing it!\"\n\nShe scowled into the cold blacknesses about her.\n\n\"Manning,\" she said, and contemplated a figure of inaggressive\npersistence. \"No!\" Her thoughts had turned in a new direction.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" she said, after a long interval, \"if they are\nabsurd. They mean something. They mean everything that women can\nmean--except submission. The vote is only the beginning, the necessary\nbeginning. If we do not begin--\"\n\nShe had come to a resolution. Abruptly she got out of bed, smoothed\nher sheet and straightened her pillow and lay down, and fell almost\ninstantly asleep.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nThe next morning was as dark and foggy as if it was mid-November instead\nof early March. Ann Veronica woke rather later than usual, and lay awake\nfor some minutes before she remembered a certain resolution she\nhad taken in the small hours. Then instantly she got out of bed and\nproceeded to dress.\n\nShe did not start for the Imperial College. She spent the morning up\nto ten in writing a series of unsuccessful letters to Ramage, which she\ntore up unfinished; and finally she desisted and put on her jacket and\nwent out into the lamp-lit obscurity and slimy streets. She turned a\nresolute face southward.\n\nShe followed Oxford Street into Holborn, and then she inquired for\nChancery Lane. There she sought and at last found 107A, one of those\nheterogeneous piles of offices which occupy the eastern side of the\nlane. She studied the painted names of firms and persons and enterprises\non the wall, and discovered that the Women's Bond of Freedom occupied\nseveral contiguous suites on the first floor. She went up-stairs and\nhesitated between four doors with ground-glass panes, each of which\nprofessed \"The Women's Bond of Freedom\" in neat black letters. She\nopened one and found herself in a large untidy room set with chairs that\nwere a little disarranged as if by an overnight meeting. On the walls\nwere notice-boards bearing clusters of newspaper slips, three or four\nbig posters of monster meetings, one of which Ann Veronica had attended\nwith Miss Miniver, and a series of announcements in purple copying-ink,\nand in one corner was a pile of banners. There was no one at all in this\nroom, but through the half-open door of one of the small apartments\nthat gave upon it she had a glimpse of two very young girls sitting at a\nlittered table and writing briskly.\n\nShe walked across to this apartment and, opening the door a little\nwider, discovered a press section of the movement at work.\n\n\"I want to inquire,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Next door,\" said a spectacled young person of seventeen or eighteen,\nwith an impatient indication of the direction.\n\nIn the adjacent apartment Ann Veronica found a middle-aged woman with\na tired face under the tired hat she wore, sitting at a desk opening\nletters while a dusky, untidy girl of eight-or nine-and-twenty hammered\nindustriously at a typewriter. The tired woman looked up in inquiring\nsilence at Ann Veronica's diffident entry.\n\n\"I want to know more about this movement,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Are you with us?\" said the tired woman.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Ann Veronica; \"I think I am. I want very much to do\nsomething for women. But I want to know what you are doing.\"\n\nThe tired woman sat still for a moment. \"You haven't come here to make a\nlot of difficulties?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Ann Veronica, \"but I want to know.\"\n\nThe tired woman shut her eyes tightly for a moment, and then looked with\nthem at Ann Veronica. \"What can you do?\" she asked.\n\n\"Do?\"\n\n\"Are you prepared to do things for us? Distribute bills? Write letters?\nInterrupt meetings? Canvass at elections? Face dangers?\"\n\n\"If I am satisfied--\"\n\n\"If we satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Then, if possible, I would like to go to prison.\"\n\n\"It isn't nice going to prison.\"\n\n\"It would suit me.\"\n\n\"It isn't nice getting there.\"\n\n\"That's a question of detail,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nThe tired woman looked quietly at her. \"What are your objections?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"It isn't objections exactly. I want to know what you are doing; how you\nthink this work of yours really does serve women.\"\n\n\"We are working for the equal citizenship of men and women,\" said the\ntired woman. \"Women have been and are treated as the inferiors of men,\nwe want to make them their equals.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica, \"I agree to that. But--\"\n\nThe tired woman raised her eyebrows in mild protest.\n\n\"Isn't the question more complicated than that?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"You could have a talk to Miss Kitty Brett this afternoon, if you liked.\nShall I make an appointment for you?\"\n\nMiss Kitty Brett was one of the most conspicuous leaders of the\nmovement. Ann Veronica snatched at the opportunity, and spent most\nof the intervening time in the Assyrian Court of the British Museum,\nreading and thinking over a little book upon the feminist movement the\ntired woman had made her buy. She got a bun and some cocoa in the little\nrefreshment-room, and then wandered through the galleries up-stairs,\ncrowded with Polynesian idols and Polynesian dancing-garments, and all\nthe simple immodest accessories to life in Polynesia, to a seat among\nthe mummies. She was trying to bring her problems to a head, and her\nmind insisted upon being even more discursive and atmospheric than\nusual. It generalized everything she put to it.\n\n\"Why should women be dependent on men?\" she asked; and the question was\nat once converted into a system of variations upon the theme of \"Why\nare things as they are?\"--\"Why are human beings viviparous?\"--\"Why are\npeople hungry thrice a day?\"--\"Why does one faint at danger?\"\n\nShe stood for a time looking at the dry limbs and still human face of\nthat desiccated unwrapped mummy from the very beginnings of social life.\nIt looked very patient, she thought, and a little self-satisfied. It\nlooked as if it had taken its world for granted and prospered on that\nassumption--a world in which children were trained to obey their\nelders and the wills of women over-ruled as a matter of course. It was\nwonderful to think this thing had lived, had felt and suffered. Perhaps\nonce it had desired some other human being intolerably. Perhaps some one\nhad kissed the brow that was now so cadaverous, rubbed that sunken cheek\nwith loving fingers, held that stringy neck with passionately living\nhands. But all of that was forgotten. \"In the end,\" it seemed to be\nthinking, \"they embalmed me with the utmost respect--sound spices chosen\nto endure--the best! I took my world as I found it. THINGS ARE SO!\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nAnn Veronica's first impression of Kitty Brett was that she was\naggressive and disagreeable; her next that she was a person of amazing\npersuasive power. She was perhaps three-and-twenty, and very pink and\nhealthy-looking, showing a great deal of white and rounded neck above\nher business-like but altogether feminine blouse, and a good deal of\nplump, gesticulating forearm out of her short sleeve. She had animated\ndark blue-gray eyes under her fine eyebrows, and dark brown hair that\nrolled back simply and effectively from her broad low forehead. And she\nwas about as capable of intelligent argument as a runaway steam-roller.\nShe was a trained being--trained by an implacable mother to one end.\n\nShe spoke with fluent enthusiasm. She did not so much deal with Ann\nVeronica's interpolations as dispose of them with quick and use-hardened\nrepartee, and then she went on with a fine directness to sketch the case\nfor her agitation, for that remarkable rebellion of the women that was\nthen agitating the whole world of politics and discussion. She assumed\nwith a kind of mesmeric force all the propositions that Ann Veronica\nwanted her to define.\n\n\"What do we want? What is the goal?\" asked Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Freedom! Citizenship! And the way to that--the way to everything--is\nthe Vote.\"\n\nAnn Veronica said something about a general change of ideas.\n\n\"How can you change people's ideas if you have no power?\" said Kitty\nBrett.\n\nAnn Veronica was not ready enough to deal with that counter-stroke.\n\n\"One doesn't want to turn the whole thing into a mere sex antagonism.\"\n\n\"When women get justice,\" said Kitty Brett, \"there will be no sex\nantagonism. None at all. Until then we mean to keep on hammering away.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that much of a woman's difficulties are economic.\"\n\n\"That will follow,\" said Kitty Brett--\"that will follow.\"\n\nShe interrupted as Ann Veronica was about to speak again, with a bright\ncontagious hopefulness. \"Everything will follow,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica, trying to think where they were, trying to\nget things plain again that had seemed plain enough in the quiet of the\nnight.\n\n\"Nothing was ever done,\" Miss Brett asserted, \"without a certain element\nof Faith. After we have got the Vote and are recognized as citizens,\nthen we can come to all these other things.\"\n\nEven in the glamour of Miss Brett's assurance it seemed to Ann Veronica\nthat this was, after all, no more than the gospel of Miss Miniver with\na new set of resonances. And like that gospel it meant something,\nsomething different from its phrases, something elusive, and yet\nsomething that in spite of the superficial incoherence of its phrasing,\nwas largely essentially true. There was something holding women down,\nholding women back, and if it wasn't exactly man-made law, man-made\nlaw was an aspect of it. There was something indeed holding the whole\nspecies back from the imaginable largeness of life....\n\n\"The Vote is the symbol of everything,\" said Miss Brett.\n\nShe made an abrupt personal appeal.\n\n\"Oh! please don't lose yourself in a wilderness of secondary\nconsiderations,\" she said. \"Don't ask me to tell you all that women can\ndo, all that women can be. There is a new life, different from the old\nlife of dependence, possible. If only we are not divided. If only we\nwork together. This is the one movement that brings women of different\nclasses together for a common purpose. If you could see how it gives\nthem souls, women who have taken things for granted, who have given\nthemselves up altogether to pettiness and vanity....\"\n\n\"Give me something to do,\" said Ann Veronica, interrupting her\npersuasions at last. \"It has been very kind of you to see me, but I\ndon't want to sit and talk and use your time any longer. I want to do\nsomething. I want to hammer myself against all this that pens women in.\nI feel that I shall stifle unless I can do something--and do something\nsoon.\"\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nIt was not Ann Veronica's fault that the night's work should have taken\nupon itself the forms of wild burlesque. She was in deadly earnest in\neverything she did. It seemed to her the last desperate attack upon the\nuniverse that would not let her live as she desired to live, that penned\nher in and controlled her and directed her and disapproved of her, the\nsame invincible wrappering, the same leaden tyranny of a universe that\nshe had vowed to overcome after that memorable conflict with her father\nat Morningside Park.\n\nShe was listed for the raid--she was informed it was to be a raid upon\nthe House of Commons, though no particulars were given her--and told to\ngo alone to 14, Dexter Street, Westminster, and not to ask any policeman\nto direct her. 14, Dexter Street, Westminster, she found was not a house\nbut a yard in an obscure street, with big gates and the name of Podgers\n& Carlo, Carriers and Furniture Removers, thereon. She was perplexed by\nthis, and stood for some seconds in the empty street hesitating, until\nthe appearance of another circumspect woman under the street lamp at the\ncorner reassured her. In one of the big gates was a little door, and she\nrapped at this. It was immediately opened by a man with light eyelashes\nand a manner suggestive of restrained passion. \"Come right in,\" he\nhissed under his breath, with the true conspirator's note, closed the\ndoor very softly and pointed, \"Through there!\"\n\nBy the meagre light of a gas lamp she perceived a cobbled yard with four\nlarge furniture vans standing with horses and lamps alight. A slender\nyoung man, wearing glasses, appeared from the shadow of the nearest van.\n\"Are you A, B, C, or D?\" he asked.\n\n\"They told me D,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Through there,\" he said, and pointed with the pamphlet he was carrying.\n\nAnn Veronica found herself in a little stirring crowd of excited women,\nwhispering and tittering and speaking in undertones.\n\nThe light was poor, so that she saw their gleaming faces dimly and\nindistinctly. No one spoke to her. She stood among them, watching\nthem and feeling curiously alien to them. The oblique ruddy lighting\ndistorted them oddly, made queer bars and patches of shadow upon their\nclothes. \"It's Kitty's idea,\" said one, \"we are to go in the vans.\"\n\n\"Kitty is wonderful,\" said another.\n\n\"Wonderful!\"\n\n\"I have always longed for prison service,\" said a voice, \"always.\nFrom the beginning. But it's only now I'm able to do it.\"\n\nA little blond creature close at hand suddenly gave way to a fit of\nhysterical laughter, and caught up the end of it with a sob.\n\n\"Before I took up the Suffrage,\" a firm, flat voice remarked, \"I could\nscarcely walk up-stairs without palpitations.\"\n\nSome one hidden from Ann Veronica appeared to be marshalling the\nassembly. \"We have to get in, I think,\" said a nice little old lady in\na bonnet to Ann Veronica, speaking with a voice that quavered a little.\n\"My dear, can you see in this light? I think I would like to get in.\nWhich is C?\"\n\nAnn Veronica, with a curious sinking of the heart, regarded the black\ncavities of the vans. Their doors stood open, and placards with big\nletters indicated the section assigned to each. She directed the little\nold woman and then made her way to van D. A young woman with a white\nbadge on her arm stood and counted the sections as they entered their\nvans.\n\n\"When they tap the roof,\" she said, in a voice of authority, \"you are to\ncome out. You will be opposite the big entrance in Old Palace Yard. It's\nthe public entrance. You are to make for that and get into the lobby if\nyou can, and so try and reach the floor of the House, crying 'Votes for\nWomen!' as you go.\"\n\nShe spoke like a mistress addressing school-children.\n\n\"Don't bunch too much as you come out,\" she added.\n\n\"All right?\" asked the man with the light eyelashes, suddenly appearing\nin the doorway. He waited for an instant, wasting an encouraging smile\nin the imperfect light, and then shut the doors of the van, leaving the\nwomen in darkness....\n\nThe van started with a jerk and rumbled on its way.\n\n\"It's like Troy!\" said a voice of rapture. \"It's exactly like Troy!\"\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nSo Ann Veronica, enterprising and a little dubious as ever, mingled with\nthe stream of history and wrote her Christian name upon the police-court\nrecords of the land.\n\nBut out of a belated regard for her father she wrote the surname of some\none else.\n\nSome day, when the rewards of literature permit the arduous research\nrequired, the Campaign of the Women will find its Carlyle, and the\nparticulars of that marvellous series of exploits by which Miss Brett\nand her colleagues nagged the whole Western world into the discussion of\nwomen's position become the material for the most delightful and amazing\ndescriptions. At present the world waits for that writer, and the\nconfused record of the newspapers remains the only resource of the\ncurious. When he comes he will do that raid of the pantechnicons the\njustice it deserves; he will picture the orderly evening scene about the\nImperial Legislature in convincing detail, the coming and going of cabs\nand motor-cabs and broughams through the chill, damp evening into New\nPalace Yard, the reinforced but untroubled and unsuspecting police about\nthe entries of those great buildings whose square and panelled Victorian\nGothic streams up from the glare of the lamps into the murkiness of\nthe night; Big Ben shining overhead, an unassailable beacon, and the\nincidental traffic of Westminster, cabs, carts, and glowing omnibuses\ngoing to and from the bridge. About the Abbey and Abingdon Street stood\nthe outer pickets and detachments of the police, their attention all\ndirected westward to where the women in Caxton Hall, Westminster, hummed\nlike an angry hive. Squads reached to the very portal of that centre of\ndisturbance. And through all these defences and into Old Palace\nYard, into the very vitals of the defenders' position, lumbered the\nunsuspected vans.\n\nThey travelled past the few idle sightseers who had braved the\nuninviting evening to see what the Suffragettes might be doing; they\npulled up unchallenged within thirty yards of those coveted portals.\n\nAnd then they disgorged.\n\nWere I a painter of subject pictures, I would exhaust all my skill\nin proportion and perspective and atmosphere upon the august seat\nof empire, I would present it gray and dignified and immense and\nrespectable beyond any mere verbal description, and then, in vivid\nblack and very small, I would put in those valiantly impertinent\nvans, squatting at the base of its altitudes and pouring out a swift,\nstraggling rush of ominous little black objects, minute figures of\ndetermined women at war with the universe.\n\nAnn Veronica was in their very forefront.\n\nIn an instant the expectant calm of Westminster was ended, and the very\nSpeaker in the chair blenched at the sound of the policemen's whistles.\nThe bolder members in the House left their places to go lobbyward,\ngrinning. Others pulled hats over their noses, cowered in their seats,\nand feigned that all was right with the world. In Old Palace Yard\neverybody ran. They either ran to see or ran for shelter. Even two\nCabinet Ministers took to their heels, grinning insincerely. At the\nopening of the van doors and the emergence into the fresh air Ann\nVeronica's doubt and depression gave place to the wildest exhilaration.\nThat same adventurousness that had already buoyed her through crises\nthat would have overwhelmed any normally feminine girl with shame and\nhorror now became uppermost again. Before her was a great Gothic portal.\nThrough that she had to go.\n\nPast her shot the little old lady in the bonnet, running incredibly\nfast, but otherwise still alertly respectable, and she was making a\nstrange threatening sound as she ran, such as one would use in driving\nducks out of a garden--\"B-r-r-r-r-r--!\" and pawing with black-gloved\nhands. The policemen were closing in from the sides to intervene. The\nlittle old lady struck like a projectile upon the resounding chest\nof the foremost of these, and then Ann Veronica had got past and was\nascending the steps.\n\nThen most horribly she was clasped about the waist from behind and\nlifted from the ground.\n\nAt that a new element poured into her excitement, an element of wild\ndisgust and terror. She had never experienced anything so disagreeable\nin her life as the sense of being held helplessly off her feet. She\nscreamed involuntarily--she had never in her life screamed before--and\nthen she began to wriggle and fight like a frightened animal against the\nmen who were holding her.\n\nThe affair passed at one leap from a spree to a nightmare of violence\nand disgust. Her hair got loose, her hat came over one eye, and she had\nno arm free to replace it. She felt she must suffocate if these men did\nnot put her down, and for a time they would not put her down. Then with\nan indescribable relief her feet were on the pavement, and she was\nbeing urged along by two policemen, who were gripping her wrists in an\nirresistible expert manner. She was writhing to get her hands loose\nand found herself gasping with passionate violence, \"It's\ndamnable!--damnable!\" to the manifest disgust of the fatherly policeman\non her right.\n\nThen they had released her arms and were trying to push her away.\n\n\"You be off, missie,\" said the fatherly policeman. \"This ain't no place\nfor you.\"\n\nHe pushed her a dozen yards along the greasy pavement with flat,\nwell-trained hands that there seemed to be no opposing. Before her\nstretched blank spaces, dotted with running people coming toward her,\nand below them railings and a statue. She almost submitted to this\nending of her adventure. But at the word \"home\" she turned again.\n\n\"I won't go home,\" she said; \"I won't!\" and she evaded the clutch of the\nfatherly policeman and tried to thrust herself past him in the direction\nof that big portal. \"Steady on!\" he cried.\n\nA diversion was created by the violent struggles of the little old\nlady. She seemed to be endowed with superhuman strength. A knot of\nthree policemen in conflict with her staggered toward Ann Veronica's\nattendants and distracted their attention. \"I WILL be arrested! I WON'T\ngo home!\" the little old lady was screaming over and over again. They\nput her down, and she leaped at them; she smote a helmet to the ground.\n\n\"You'll have to take her!\" shouted an inspector on horseback, and she\nechoed his cry: \"You'll have to take me!\" They seized upon her and\nlifted her, and she screamed. Ann Veronica became violently excited at\nthe sight. \"You cowards!\" said Ann Veronica, \"put her down!\" and tore\nherself from a detaining hand and battered with her fists upon the big\nred ear and blue shoulder of the policeman who held the little old lady.\n\nSo Ann Veronica also was arrested.\n\nAnd then came the vile experience of being forced and borne along the\nstreet to the police-station. Whatever anticipation Ann Veronica had\nformed of this vanished in the reality. Presently she was going through\na swaying, noisy crowd, whose faces grinned and stared pitilessly in the\nlight of the electric standards. \"Go it, miss!\" cried one. \"Kick aht at\n'em!\" though, indeed, she went now with Christian meekness, resenting\nonly the thrusting policemen's hands. Several people in the crowd seemed\nto be fighting. Insulting cries became frequent and various, but for the\nmost part she could not understand what was said. \"Who'll mind the baby\nnar?\" was one of the night's inspirations, and very frequent. A lean\nyoung man in spectacles pursued her for some time, crying \"Courage!\nCourage!\" Somebody threw a dab of mud at her, and some of it got down\nher neck. Immeasurable disgust possessed her. She felt draggled and\ninsulted beyond redemption.\n\nShe could not hide her face. She attempted by a sheer act of will to\nend the scene, to will herself out of it anywhere. She had a horrible\nglimpse of the once nice little old lady being also borne stationward,\nstill faintly battling and very muddy--one lock of grayish hair\nstraggling over her neck, her face scared, white, but triumphant. Her\nbonnet dropped off and was trampled into the gutter. A little Cockney\nrecovered it, and made ridiculous attempts to get to her and replace it.\n\n\"You must arrest me!\" she gasped, breathlessly, insisting insanely on a\npoint already carried; \"you shall!\"\n\nThe police-station at the end seemed to Ann Veronica like a refuge from\nunnamable disgraces. She hesitated about her name, and, being prompted,\ngave it at last as Ann Veronica Smith, 107A, Chancery Lane....\n\nIndignation carried her through that night, that men and the world\ncould so entreat her. The arrested women were herded in a passage of\nthe Panton Street Police-station that opened upon a cell too unclean for\noccupation, and most of them spent the night standing. Hot coffee\nand cakes were sent in to them in the morning by some intelligent\nsympathizer, or she would have starved all day. Submission to the\ninevitable carried her through the circumstances of her appearance\nbefore the magistrate.\n\nHe was no doubt doing his best to express the attitude of society toward\nthese wearily heroic defendants, but he seemed to be merely rude and\nunfair to Ann Veronica. He was not, it seemed, the proper stipendiary at\nall, and there had been some demur to his jurisdiction that had ruffled\nhim. He resented being regarded as irregular. He felt he was human\nwisdom prudentially interpolated.... \"You silly wimmin,\" he said over\nand over again throughout the hearing, plucking at his blotting-pad\nwith busy hands. \"You silly creatures! Ugh! Fie upon you!\" The court was\ncrowded with people, for the most part supporters and admirers of the\ndefendants, and the man with the light eyelashes was conspicuously\nactive and omnipresent.\n\nAnn Veronica's appearance was brief and undistinguished. She had nothing\nto say for herself. She was guided into the dock and prompted by a\nhelpful police inspector. She was aware of the body of the court,\nof clerks seated at a black table littered with papers, of policemen\nstanding about stiffly with expressions of conscious integrity, and\na murmuring background of the heads and shoulders of spectators close\nbehind her. On a high chair behind a raised counter the stipendiary's\nsubstitute regarded her malevolently over his glasses. A disagreeable\nyoung man, with red hair and a loose mouth, seated at the reporter's\ntable, was only too manifestly sketching her.\n\nShe was interested by the swearing of the witnesses. The kissing of the\nbook struck her as particularly odd, and then the policemen gave their\nevidence in staccato jerks and stereotyped phrases.\n\n\"Have you anything to ask the witness?\" asked the helpful inspector.\n\nThe ribald demons that infested the back of Ann Veronica's mind urged\nvarious facetious interrogations upon her, as, for example, where\nthe witness had acquired his prose style. She controlled herself, and\nanswered meekly, \"No.\"\n\n\"Well, Ann Veronica Smith,\" the magistrate remarked when the case was\nall before him, \"you're a good-looking, strong, respectable gell, and\nit's a pity you silly young wimmin can't find something better to do\nwith your exuberance. Two-and-twenty! I can't imagine what your parents\ncan be thinking about to let you get into these scrapes.\"\n\nAnn Veronica's mind was filled with confused unutterable replies.\n\n\"You are persuaded to come and take part in these outrageous\nproceedings--many of you, I am convinced, have no idea whatever of\ntheir nature. I don't suppose you could tell me even the derivation of\nsuffrage if I asked you. No! not even the derivation! But the fashion's\nbeen set and in it you must be.\"\n\nThe men at the reporter's table lifted their eyebrows, smiled faintly,\nand leaned back to watch how she took her scolding. One with the\nappearance of a bald little gnome yawned agonizingly. They had got all\nthis down already--they heard the substance of it now for the fourteenth\ntime. The stipendiary would have done it all very differently.\n\nShe found presently she was out of the dock and confronted with the\nalternative of being bound over in one surety for the sum of forty\npounds--whatever that might mean or a month's imprisonment.\n\n\"Second class,\" said some one, but first and second were all alike to\nher. She elected to go to prison.\n\nAt last, after a long rumbling journey in a stuffy windowless van, she\nreached Canongate Prison--for Holloway had its quota already. It was bad\nluck to go to Canongate.\n\nPrison was beastly. Prison was bleak without spaciousness, and pervaded\nby a faint, oppressive smell; and she had to wait two hours in the\nsullenly defiant company of two unclean women thieves before a cell\ncould be assigned to her. Its dreariness, like the filthiness of the\npolice cell, was a discovery for her. She had imagined that prisons\nwere white-tiled places, reeking of lime-wash and immaculately\nsanitary. Instead, they appeared to be at the hygienic level of tramps'\nlodging-houses. She was bathed in turbid water that had already been\nused. She was not allowed to bathe herself: another prisoner, with a\nprivileged manner, washed her. Conscientious objectors to that process\nare not permitted, she found, in Canongate. Her hair was washed for her\nalso. Then they dressed her in a dirty dress of coarse serge and a cap,\nand took away her own clothes. The dress came to her only too manifestly\nunwashed from its former wearer; even the under-linen they gave her\nseemed unclean. Horrible memories of things seen beneath the microscope\nof the baser forms of life crawled across her mind and set her\nshuddering with imagined irritations. She sat on the edge of the\nbed--the wardress was too busy with the flood of arrivals that day\nto discover that she had it down--and her skin was shivering from the\ncontact of these garments. She surveyed accommodation that seemed at\nfirst merely austere, and became more and more manifestly inadequate as\nthe moments fled by. She meditated profoundly through several enormous\ncold hours on all that had happened and all that she had done since the\nswirl of the suffrage movement had submerged her personal affairs....\n\nVery slowly emerging out of a phase of stupefaction, these personal\naffairs and her personal problem resumed possession of her mind. She had\nimagined she had drowned them altogether.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE ELEVENTH\n\nTHOUGHTS IN PRISON\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nThe first night in prison she found it impossible to sleep. The bed\nwas hard beyond any experience of hers, the bed-clothes coarse and\ninsufficient, the cell at once cold and stuffy. The little grating\nin the door, the sense of constant inspection, worried her. She kept\nopening her eyes and looking at it. She was fatigued physically and\nmentally, and neither mind nor body could rest. She became aware that\nat regular intervals a light flashed upon her face and a bodiless eye\nregarded her, and this, as the night wore on, became a torment....\n\nCapes came back into her mind. He haunted a state between hectic\ndreaming and mild delirium, and she found herself talking aloud to\nhim. All through the night an entirely impossible and monumental\nCapes confronted her, and she argued with him about men and women. She\nvisualized him as in a policeman's uniform and quite impassive. On some\ninsane score she fancied she had to state her case in verse. \"We are the\nmusic and you are the instrument,\" she said; \"we are verse and you are\nprose.\n\n     \"For men have reason, women rhyme\n     A man scores always, all the time.\"\n\nThis couplet sprang into her mind from nowhere, and immediately begot an\nendless series of similar couplets that she began to compose and address\nto Capes. They came teeming distressfully through her aching brain:\n\n     \"A man can kick, his skirts don't tear;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\n\n     \"His dress for no man lays a snare;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\n     For hats that fail and hats that flare;\n     Toppers their universal wear;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\n\n     \"Men's waists are neither here nor there;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\n\n     \"A man can manage without hair;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\n\n     \"There are no males at men to stare;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\n\n     \"And children must we women bear--\n\n\"Oh, damn!\" she cried, as the hundred-and-first couplet or so presented\nitself in her unwilling brain.\n\nFor a time she worried about that compulsory bath and cutaneous\ndiseases.\n\nThen she fell into a fever of remorse for the habit of bad language she\nhad acquired.\n\n     \"A man can smoke, a man can swear;\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\"\n\nShe rolled over on her face, and stuffed her fingers in her ears to shut\nout the rhythm from her mind. She lay still for a long time, and her\nmind resumed at a more tolerable pace. She found herself talking to\nCapes in an undertone of rational admission.\n\n\"There is something to be said for the lady-like theory after all,\" she\nadmitted. \"Women ought to be gentle and submissive persons, strong only\nin virtue and in resistance to evil compulsion. My dear--I can call you\nthat here, anyhow--I know that. The Victorians over-did it a little, I\nadmit. Their idea of maidenly innocence was just a blank white--the sort\nof flat white that doesn't shine. But that doesn't alter the fact\nthat there IS innocence. And I've read, and thought, and guessed, and\nlooked--until MY innocence--it's smirched.\n\n\"Smirched!...\n\n\"You see, dear, one IS passionately anxious for something--what is it?\nOne wants to be CLEAN. You want me to be clean. You would want me to be\nclean, if you gave me a thought, that is....\n\n\"I wonder if you give me a thought....\n\n\"I'm not a good woman. I don't mean I'm not a good woman--I mean that\nI'm not a GOOD woman. My poor brain is so mixed, dear, I hardly know\nwhat I am saying. I mean I'm not a good specimen of a woman. I've got a\nstreak of male. Things happen to women--proper women--and all they have\nto do is to take them well. They've just got to keep white. But I'm\nalways trying to make things happen. And I get myself dirty...\n\n\"It's all dirt that washes off, dear, but it's dirt.\n\n\"The white unaggressive woman who corrects and nurses and serves, and is\nworshipped and betrayed--the martyr-queen of men, the white mother....\nYou can't do that sort of thing unless you do it over religion, and\nthere's no religion in me--of that sort--worth a rap.\n\n\"I'm not gentle. Certainly not a gentlewoman.\n\n\"I'm not coarse--no! But I've got no purity of mind--no real purity of\nmind. A good woman's mind has angels with flaming swords at the portals\nto keep out fallen thoughts....\n\n\"I wonder if there are any good women really.\n\n\"I wish I didn't swear. I do swear. It began as a joke.... It\ndeveloped into a sort of secret and private bad manners. It's got to be\nat last like tobacco-ash over all my sayings and doings....\n\n\"'Go it, missie,' they said; \"kick aht!'\n\n\"I swore at that policeman--and disgusted him. Disgusted him!\n\n     \"For men policemen never blush;\n     A man in all things scores so much...\n\n\"Damn! Things are getting plainer. It must be the dawn creeping in.\n\n     \"Now here hath been dawning another blue day;\n     I'm just a poor woman, please take it away.\n\n\"Oh, sleep! Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!\"\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\n\"Now,\" said Ann Veronica, after the half-hour of exercise, and sitting\non the uncomfortable wooden seat without a back that was her perch by\nday, \"it's no good staying here in a sort of maze. I've got nothing to\ndo for a month but think. I may as well think. I ought to be able to\nthink things out.\n\n\"How shall I put the question? What am I? What have I got to do with\nmyself?...\n\n\"I wonder if many people HAVE thought things out?\n\n\"Are we all just seizing hold of phrases and obeying moods?\n\n\"It wasn't so with old-fashioned people, they knew right from wrong;\nthey had a clear-cut, religious faith that seemed to explain everything\nand give a rule for everything. We haven't. I haven't, anyhow. And it's\nno good pretending there is one when there isn't.... I suppose I\nbelieve in God.... Never really thought about Him--people don't..\n.. I suppose my creed is, 'I believe rather indistinctly in God the\nFather Almighty, substratum of the evolutionary process, and, in a vein\nof vague sentimentality that doesn't give a datum for anything at all,\nin Jesus Christ, His Son.'...\n\n\"It's no sort of good, Ann Veronica, pretending one does believe when\none doesn't....\n\n\"And as for praying for faith--this sort of monologue is about as near\nas any one of my sort ever gets to prayer. Aren't I asking--asking\nplainly now?...\n\n\"We've all been mixing our ideas, and we've got intellectual hot\ncoppers--every blessed one of us....\n\n\"A confusion of motives--that's what I am!...\n\n\"There is this absurd craving for Mr. Capes--the 'Capes crave,' they\nwould call it in America. Why do I want him so badly? Why do I want him,\nand think about him, and fail to get away from him?\n\n\"It isn't all of me.\n\n\"The first person you love, Ann Veronica, is yourself--get hold of that!\nThe soul you have to save is Ann Veronica's soul....\"\n\nShe knelt upon the floor of her cell and clasped her hands, and remained\nfor a long time in silence.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" she said at last, \"how I wish I had been taught to pray!\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nShe had some idea of putting these subtle and difficult issues to the\nchaplain when she was warned of his advent. But she had not reckoned\nwith the etiquette of Canongate. She got up, as she had been told to\ndo, at his appearance, and he amazed her by sitting down, according to\ncustom, on her stool. He still wore his hat, to show that the days\nof miracles and Christ being civil to sinners are over forever. She\nperceived that his countenance was only composed by a great effort, his\nfeatures severely compressed. He was ruffled, and his ears were red,\nno doubt from some adjacent controversy. He classified her as he seated\nhimself.\n\n\"Another young woman, I suppose,\" he said, \"who knows better than her\nMaker about her place in the world. Have you anything to ask me?\"\n\nAnn Veronica readjusted her mind hastily. Her back stiffened. She\nproduced from the depths of her pride the ugly investigatory note of\nthe modern district visitor. \"Are you a special sort of clergyman,\" she\nsaid, after a pause, and looking down her nose at him, \"or do you go to\nthe Universities?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said, profoundly.\n\nHe panted for a moment with unuttered replies, and then, with a scornful\ngesture, got up and left the cell.\n\nSo that Ann Veronica was not able to get the expert advice she certainly\nneeded upon her spiritual state.\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nAfter a day or so she thought more steadily. She found herself in a\nphase of violent reaction against the suffrage movement, a phase\ngreatly promoted by one of those unreasonable objections people of Ann\nVeronica's temperament take at times--to the girl in the next cell to\nher own. She was a large, resilient girl, with a foolish smile, a still\nmore foolish expression of earnestness, and a throaty contralto voice.\nShe was noisy and hilarious and enthusiastic, and her hair was always\nabominably done. In the chapel she sang with an open-lunged gusto that\nsilenced Ann Veronica altogether, and in the exercising-yard slouched\nround with carelessly dispersed feet. Ann Veronica decided that\n\"hoydenish ragger\" was the only phrase to express her. She was always\nbreaking rules, whispering asides, intimating signals. She became at\ntimes an embodiment for Ann Veronica of all that made the suffrage\nmovement defective and unsatisfying.\n\nShe was always initiating petty breaches of discipline. Her greatest\nexploit was the howling before the mid-day meal. This was an imitation\nof the noises made by the carnivora at the Zoological Gardens at\nfeeding-time; the idea was taken up by prisoner after prisoner until\nthe whole place was alive with barkings, yappings, roarings, pelican\nchatterings, and feline yowlings, interspersed with shrieks of\nhysterical laughter. To many in that crowded solitude it came as an\nextraordinary relief. It was better even than the hymn-singing. But it\nannoyed Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Idiots!\" she said, when she heard this pandemonium, and with particular\nreference to this young lady with the throaty contralto next door.\n\"Intolerable idiots!...\"\n\nIt took some days for this phase to pass, and it left some scars and\nsomething like a decision. \"Violence won't do it,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\"Begin violence, and the woman goes under....\n\n\"But all the rest of our case is right.... Yes.\"\n\nAs the long, solitary days wore on, Ann Veronica found a number of\ndefinite attitudes and conclusions in her mind.\n\nOne of these was a classification of women into women who are and women\nwho are not hostile to men. \"The real reason why I am out of place\nhere,\" she said, \"is because I like men. I can talk with them. I've\nnever found them hostile. I've got no feminine class feeling. I don't\nwant any laws or freedoms to protect me from a man like Mr. Capes. I\nknow that in my heart I would take whatever he gave....\n\n\"A woman wants a proper alliance with a man, a man who is better stuff\nthan herself. She wants that and needs it more than anything else in\nthe world. It may not be just, it may not be fair, but things are so. It\nisn't law, nor custom, nor masculine violence settled that. It is just\nhow things happen to be. She wants to be free--she wants to be legally\nand economically free, so as not to be subject to the wrong man; but\nonly God, who made the world, can alter things to prevent her being\nslave to the right one.\n\n\"And if she can't have the right one?\n\n\"We've developed such a quality of preference!\"\n\nShe rubbed her knuckles into her forehead. \"Oh, but life is difficult!\"\nshe groaned. \"When you loosen the tangle in one place you tie a knot in\nanother.... Before there is any change, any real change, I shall be\ndead--dead--dead and finished--two hundred years!...\"\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nOne afternoon, while everything was still, the wardress heard her cry\nout suddenly and alarmingly, and with great and unmistakable passion,\n\"Why in the name of goodness did I burn that twenty pounds?\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nShe sat regarding her dinner. The meat was coarse and disagreeably\nserved.\n\n\"I suppose some one makes a bit on the food,\" she said....\n\n\"One has such ridiculous ideas of the wicked common people and the\nbeautiful machinery of order that ropes them in. And here are these\nplaces, full of contagion!\n\n\"Of course, this is the real texture of life, this is what we refined\nsecure people forget. We think the whole thing is straight and noble at\nbottom, and it isn't. We think if we just defy the friends we have and\ngo out into the world everything will become easy and splendid.\nOne doesn't realize that even the sort of civilization one has at\nMorningside Park is held together with difficulty. By policemen one\nmustn't shock.\n\n\"This isn't a world for an innocent girl to walk about in. It's a world\nof dirt and skin diseases and parasites. It's a world in which the\nlaw can be a stupid pig and the police-stations dirty dens. One wants\nhelpers and protectors--and clean water.\n\n\"Am I becoming reasonable or am I being tamed?\n\n\"I'm simply discovering that life is many-sided and complex and\npuzzling. I thought one had only to take it by the throat.\n\n\"It hasn't GOT a throat!\"\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nOne day the idea of self-sacrifice came into her head, and she made, she\nthought, some important moral discoveries.\n\nIt came with an extreme effect of re-discovery, a remarkable novelty.\n\"What have I been all this time?\" she asked herself, and answered, \"Just\nstark egotism, crude assertion of Ann Veronica, without a modest rag of\nreligion or discipline or respect for authority to cover me!\"\n\nIt seemed to her as though she had at last found the touchstone of\nconduct. She perceived she had never really thought of any one but\nherself in all her acts and plans. Even Capes had been for her merely an\nexcitant to passionate love--a mere idol at whose feet one could enjoy\nimaginative wallowings. She had set out to get a beautiful life, a free,\nuntrammelled life, self-development, without counting the cost either\nfor herself or others.\n\n\"I have hurt my father,\" she said; \"I have hurt my aunt. I have hurt and\nsnubbed poor Teddy. I've made no one happy. I deserve pretty much what\nI've got....\n\n\"If only because of the way one hurts others if one kicks loose and\nfree, one has to submit....\n\n\"Broken-in people! I suppose the world is just all egotistical children\nand broken-in people.\n\n\"Your little flag of pride must flutter down with the rest of them, Ann\nVeronica....\n\n\"Compromise--and kindness.\n\n\"Compromise and kindness.\n\n\"Who are YOU that the world should lie down at your feet?\n\n\"You've got to be a decent citizen, Ann Veronica. Take your half loaf\nwith the others. You mustn't go clawing after a man that doesn't belong\nto you--that isn't even interested in you. That's one thing clear.\n\n\"You've got to take the decent reasonable way. You've got to adjust\nyourself to the people God has set about you. Every one else does.\"\n\nShe thought more and more along that line. There was no reason why\nshe shouldn't be Capes' friend. He did like her, anyhow; he was always\npleased to be with her. There was no reason why she shouldn't be his\nrestrained and dignified friend. After all, that was life. Nothing was\ngiven away, and no one came so rich to the stall as to command all that\nit had to offer. Every one has to make a deal with the world.\n\nIt would be very good to be Capes' friend.\n\nShe might be able to go on with biology, possibly even work upon the\nsame questions that he dealt with....\n\nPerhaps her granddaughter might marry his grandson....\n\nIt grew clear to her that throughout all her wild raid for independence\nshe had done nothing for anybody, and many people had done things for\nher. She thought of her aunt and that purse that was dropped on the\ntable, and of many troublesome and ill-requited kindnesses; she thought\nof the help of the Widgetts, of Teddy's admiration; she thought, with\na new-born charity, of her father, of Manning's conscientious\nunselfishness, of Miss Miniver's devotion.\n\n\"And for me it has been Pride and Pride and Pride!\n\n\"I am the prodigal daughter. I will arise and go to my father, and will\nsay unto him--\n\n\"I suppose pride and self-assertion are sin? Sinned against heaven--Yes,\nI have sinned against heaven and before thee....\n\n\"Poor old daddy! I wonder if he'll spend much on the fatted calf?...\n\n\"The wrappered life-discipline! One comes to that at last. I begin to\nunderstand Jane Austen and chintz covers and decency and refinement and\nall the rest of it. One puts gloves on one's greedy fingers. One learns\nto sit up...\n\n\"And somehow or other,\" she added, after a long interval, \"I must pay\nMr. Ramage back his forty pounds.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH\n\nANN VERONICA PUTS THINGS IN ORDER\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nAnn Veronica made a strenuous attempt to carry out her good resolutions.\nShe meditated long and carefully upon her letter to her father before\nshe wrote it, and gravely and deliberately again before she despatched\nit.\n\n\n\"MY DEAR FATHER,\" she wrote,--\"I have been thinking hard about\neverything since I was sent to this prison. All these experiences have\ntaught me a great deal about life and realities. I see that compromise\nis more necessary to life than I ignorantly supposed it to be, and I\nhave been trying to get Lord Morley's book on that subject, but it does\nnot appear to be available in the prison library, and the chaplain seems\nto regard him as an undesirable writer.\"\n\nAt this point she had perceived that she was drifting from her subject.\n\n\"I must read him when I come out. But I see very clearly that as things\nare a daughter is necessarily dependent on her father and bound while\nshe is in that position to live harmoniously with his ideals.\"\n\n\"Bit starchy,\" said Ann Veronica, and altered the key abruptly. Her\nconcluding paragraph was, on the whole, perhaps, hardly starchy enough.\n\n\"Really, daddy, I am sorry for all I have done to put you out. May I\ncome home and try to be a better daughter to you?\n\n\"ANN VERONICA.\"\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nHer aunt came to meet her outside Canongate, and, being a little\nconfused between what was official and what was merely a rebellious\nslight upon our national justice, found herself involved in a triumphal\nprocession to the Vindicator Vegetarian Restaurant, and was specifically\nand personally cheered by a small, shabby crowd outside that rendezvous.\nThey decided quite audibly, \"She's an Old Dear, anyhow. Voting wouldn't\ndo no 'arm to 'er.\" She was on the very verge of a vegetarian meal\nbefore she recovered her head again. Obeying some fine instinct, she had\ncome to the prison in a dark veil, but she had pushed this up to kiss\nAnn Veronica and never drawn it down again. Eggs were procured for her,\nand she sat out the subsequent emotions and eloquence with the dignity\nbecoming an injured lady of good family. The quiet encounter and\nhome-coming Ann Veronica and she had contemplated was entirely\ndisorganized by this misadventure; there were no adequate explanations,\nand after they had settled things at Ann Veronica's lodgings, they\nreached home in the early afternoon estranged and depressed, with\nheadaches and the trumpet voice of the indomitable Kitty Brett still\nringing in their ears.\n\n\"Dreadful women, my dear!\" said Miss Stanley. \"And some of them quite\npretty and well dressed. No need to do such things. We must never\nlet your father know we went. Why ever did you let me get into that\nwagonette?\"\n\n\"I thought we had to,\" said Ann Veronica, who had also been a little\nunder the compulsion of the marshals of the occasion. \"It was very\ntiring.\"\n\n\"We will have some tea in the drawing-room as soon as ever we can--and I\nwill take my things off. I don't think I shall ever care for this bonnet\nagain. We'll have some buttered toast. Your poor cheeks are quite sunken\nand hollow....\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nWhen Ann Veronica found herself in her father's study that evening it\nseemed to her for a moment as though all the events of the past six\nmonths had been a dream. The big gray spaces of London, the shop-lit,\ngreasy, shining streets, had become very remote; the biological\nlaboratory with its work and emotions, the meetings and discussions,\nthe rides in hansoms with Ramage, were like things in a book read and\nclosed. The study seemed absolutely unaltered, there was still the same\nlamp with a little chip out of the shade, still the same gas fire, still\nthe same bundle of blue and white papers, it seemed, with the same pink\ntape about them, at the elbow of the arm-chair, still the same father.\nHe sat in much the same attitude, and she stood just as she had stood\nwhen he told her she could not go to the Fadden Dance. Both had dropped\nthe rather elaborate politeness of the dining-room, and in their faces\nan impartial observer would have discovered little lines of obstinate\nwilfulness in common; a certain hardness--sharp, indeed, in the father\nand softly rounded in the daughter--but hardness nevertheless, that made\nevery compromise a bargain and every charity a discount.\n\n\"And so you have been thinking?\" her father began, quoting her letter\nand looking over his slanting glasses at her. \"Well, my girl, I wish you\nhad thought about all these things before these bothers began.\"\n\nAnn Veronica perceived that she must not forget to remain eminently\nreasonable.\n\n\"One has to live and learn,\" she remarked, with a passable imitation of\nher father's manner.\n\n\"So long as you learn,\" said Mr. Stanley.\n\nTheir conversation hung.\n\n\"I suppose, daddy, you've no objection to my going on with my work at\nthe Imperial College?\" she asked.\n\n\"If it will keep you busy,\" he said, with a faintly ironical smile.\n\n\"The fees are paid to the end of the session.\"\n\nHe nodded twice, with his eyes on the fire, as though that was a formal\nstatement.\n\n\"You may go on with that work,\" he said, \"so long as you keep in harmony\nwith things at home. I'm convinced that much of Russell's investigations\nare on wrong lines, unsound lines. Still--you must learn for yourself.\nYou're of age--you're of age.\"\n\n\"The work's almost essential for the B.Sc. exam.\"\n\n\"It's scandalous, but I suppose it is.\"\n\nTheir agreement so far seemed remarkable, and yet as a home-coming the\nthing was a little lacking in warmth. But Ann Veronica had still to get\nto her chief topic. They were silent for a time. \"It's a period of crude\nviews and crude work,\" said Mr. Stanley. \"Still, these Mendelian fellows\nseem likely to give Mr. Russell trouble, a good lot of trouble. Some of\ntheir specimens--wonderfully selected, wonderfully got up.\"\n\n\"Daddy,\" said Ann Veronica, \"these affairs--being away from home\nhas--cost money.\"\n\n\"I thought you would find that out.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I happen to have got a little into debt.\"\n\n\"NEVER!\"\n\nHer heart sank at the change in his expression.\n\n\"Well, lodgings and things! And I paid my fees at the College.\"\n\n\"Yes. But how could you get--Who gave you credit?\n\n\"You see,\" said Ann Veronica, \"my landlady kept on my room while I\nwas in Holloway, and the fees for the College mounted up pretty\nconsiderably.\" She spoke rather quickly, because she found her father's\nquestion the most awkward she had ever had to answer in her life.\n\n\"Molly and you settled about the rooms. She said you HAD some money.\"\n\n\"I borrowed it,\" said Ann Veronica in a casual tone, with white despair\nin her heart.\n\n\"But who could have lent you money?\"\n\n\"I pawned my pearl necklace. I got three pounds, and there's three on my\nwatch.\"\n\n\"Six pounds. H'm. Got the tickets? Yes, but then--you said you\nborrowed?\"\n\n\"I did, too,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Who from?\"\n\nShe met his eye for a second and her heart failed her. The truth\nwas impossible, indecent. If she mentioned Ramage he might have a\nfit--anything might happen. She lied. \"The Widgetts,\" she said.\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" he said. \"Really, Vee, you seem to have advertised our\nrelations pretty generally!\"\n\n\"They--they knew, of course. Because of the Dance.\"\n\n\"How much do you owe them?\"\n\nShe knew forty pounds was a quite impossible sum for their neighbors.\nShe knew, too, she must not hesitate. \"Eight pounds,\" she plunged, and\nadded foolishly, \"fifteen pounds will see me clear of everything.\" She\nmuttered some unlady-like comment upon herself under her breath and\nengaged in secret additions.\n\nMr. Stanley determined to improve the occasion. He seemed to deliberate.\n\"Well,\" he said at last slowly, \"I'll pay it. I'll pay it. But I do\nhope, Vee, I do hope--this is the end of these adventures. I hope you\nhave learned your lesson now and come to see--come to realize--how\nthings are. People, nobody, can do as they like in this world.\nEverywhere there are limitations.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Ann Veronica (fifteen pounds!). \"I have learned that. I\nmean--I mean to do what I can.\" (Fifteen pounds. Fifteen from forty is\ntwenty-five.)\n\nHe hesitated. She could think of nothing more to say.\n\n\"Well,\" she achieved at last. \"Here goes for the new life!\"\n\n\"Here goes for the new life,\" he echoed and stood up. Father and\ndaughter regarded each other warily, each more than a little insecure\nwith the other. He made a movement toward her, and then recalled the\ncircumstances of their last conversation in that study. She saw his\npurpose and his doubt hesitated also, and then went to him, took his\ncoat lapels, and kissed him on the cheek.\n\n\"Ah, Vee,\" he said, \"that's better! and kissed her back rather clumsily.\n\n\"We're going to be sensible.\"\n\nShe disengaged herself from him and went out of the room with a grave,\npreoccupied expression. (Fifteen pounds! And she wanted forty!)\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nIt was, perhaps, the natural consequence of a long and tiring and\nexciting day that Ann Veronica should pass a broken and distressful\nnight, a night in which the noble and self-subduing resolutions of\nCanongate displayed themselves for the first time in an atmosphere of\nalmost lurid dismay. Her father's peculiar stiffness of soul presented\nitself now as something altogether left out of the calculations upon\nwhich her plans were based, and, in particular, she had not anticipated\nthe difficulty she would find in borrowing the forty pounds she needed\nfor Ramage. That had taken her by surprise, and her tired wits had\nfailed her. She was to have fifteen pounds, and no more. She knew that\nto expect more now was like anticipating a gold-mine in the garden. The\nchance had gone. It became suddenly glaringly apparent to her that it\nwas impossible to return fifteen pounds or any sum less than twenty\npounds to Ramage--absolutely impossible. She realized that with a pang\nof disgust and horror.\n\nAlready she had sent him twenty pounds, and never written to explain to\nhim why it was she had not sent it back sharply directly he returned\nit. She ought to have written at once and told him exactly what had\nhappened. Now if she sent fifteen pounds the suggestion that she had\nspent a five-pound note in the meanwhile would be irresistible. No! That\nwas impossible. She would have just to keep the fifteen pounds until she\ncould make it twenty. That might happen on her birthday--in August.\n\nShe turned about, and was persecuted by visions, half memories,\nhalf dreams, of Ramage. He became ugly and monstrous, dunning her,\nthreatening her, assailing her.\n\n\"Confound sex from first to last!\" said Ann Veronica. \"Why can't we\npropagate by sexless spores, as the ferns do? We restrict each other, we\nbadger each other, friendship is poisoned and buried under it!... I\nMUST pay off that forty pounds. I MUST.\"\n\nFor a time there seemed no comfort for her even in Capes. She was to see\nCapes to-morrow, but now, in this state of misery she had achieved, she\nfelt assured he would turn his back upon her, take no notice of her at\nall. And if he didn't, what was the good of seeing him?\n\n\"I wish he was a woman,\" she said, \"then I could make him my friend. I\nwant him as my friend. I want to talk to him and go about with him. Just\ngo about with him.\"\n\nShe was silent for a time, with her nose on the pillow, and that brought\nher to: \"What's the good of pretending?\n\n\"I love him,\" she said aloud to the dim forms of her room, and repeated\nit, and went on to imagine herself doing acts of tragically dog-like\ndevotion to the biologist, who, for the purposes of the drama, remained\nentirely unconscious of and indifferent to her proceedings.\n\nAt last some anodyne formed itself from these exercises,\nand, with eyelashes wet with such feeble tears as only\nthree-o'clock-in-the-morning pathos can distil, she fell asleep.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nPursuant to some altogether private calculations she did not go up to\nthe Imperial College until after mid-day, and she found the laboratory\ndeserted, even as she desired. She went to the table under the end\nwindow at which she had been accustomed to work, and found it swept and\ngarnished with full bottles of re-agents. Everything was very neat; it\nhad evidently been straightened up and kept for her. She put down the\nsketch-books and apparatus she had brought with her, pulled out her\nstool, and sat down. As she did so the preparation-room door opened\nbehind her. She heard it open, but as she felt unable to look round in\na careless manner she pretended not to hear it. Then Capes' footsteps\napproached. She turned with an effort.\n\n\"I expected you this morning,\" he said. \"I saw--they knocked off your\nfetters yesterday.\"\n\n\"I think it is very good of me to come this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I began to be afraid you might not come at all.\"\n\n\"Afraid!\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm glad you're back for all sorts of reasons.\" He spoke a little\nnervously. \"Among other things, you know, I didn't understand quite--I\ndidn't understand that you were so keenly interested in this suffrage\nquestion. I have it on my conscience that I offended you--\"\n\n\"Offended me when?\"\n\n\"I've been haunted by the memory of you. I was rude and stupid. We were\ntalking about the suffrage--and I rather scoffed.\"\n\n\"You weren't rude,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't know you were so keen on this suffrage business.\"\n\n\"Nor I. You haven't had it on your mind all this time?\"\n\n\"I have rather. I felt somehow I'd hurt you.\"\n\n\"You didn't. I--I hurt myself.\"\n\n\"I mean--\"\n\n\"I behaved like an idiot, that's all. My nerves were in rags. I was\nworried. We're the hysterical animal, Mr. Capes. I got myself locked up\nto cool off. By a sort of instinct. As a dog eats grass. I'm right again\nnow.\"\n\n\"Because your nerves were exposed, that was no excuse for my touching\nthem. I ought to have seen--\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter a rap--if you're not disposed to resent the--the way\nI behaved.\"\n\n\"_I_ resent!\"\n\n\"I was only sorry I'd been so stupid.\"\n\n\"Well, I take it we're straight again,\" said Capes with a note of\nrelief, and assumed an easier position on the edge of her table. \"But\nif you weren't keen on the suffrage business, why on earth did you go to\nprison?\"\n\nAnn Veronica reflected. \"It was a phase,\" she said.\n\nHe smiled. \"It's a new phase in the life history,\" he remarked.\n\"Everybody seems to have it now. Everybody who's going to develop into a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"There's Miss Garvice.\"\n\n\"She's coming on,\" said Capes. \"And, you know, you're altering us all.\nI'M shaken. The campaign's a success.\" He met her questioning eye, and\nrepeated, \"Oh! it IS a success. A man is so apt to--to take women a\nlittle too lightly. Unless they remind him now and then not to....\nYOU did.\"\n\n\"Then I didn't waste my time in prison altogether?\"\n\n\"It wasn't the prison impressed me. But I liked the things you said\nhere. I felt suddenly I understood you--as an intelligent person. If\nyou'll forgive my saying that, and implying what goes with it. There's\nsomething--puppyish in a man's usual attitude to women. That is what\nI've had on my conscience.... I don't think we're altogether to blame\nif we don't take some of your lot seriously. Some of your sex, I mean.\nBut we smirk a little, I'm afraid, habitually when we talk to you. We\nsmirk, and we're a bit--furtive.\"\n\nHe paused, with his eyes studying her gravely. \"You, anyhow, don't\ndeserve it,\" he said.\n\nTheir colloquy was ended abruptly by the apparition of Miss Klegg at\nthe further door. When she saw Ann Veronica she stood for a moment as if\nentranced, and then advanced with outstretched hands. \"Veronique!\" she\ncried with a rising intonation, though never before had she called Ann\nVeronica anything but Miss Stanley, and seized her and squeezed her and\nkissed her with profound emotion. \"To think that you were going to do\nit--and never said a word! You are a little thin, but except for that\nyou look--you look better than ever. Was it VERY horrible? I tried to\nget into the police-court, but the crowd was ever so much too big, push\nas I would....\n\n\"I mean to go to prison directly the session is over,\" said Miss Klegg.\n\"Wild horses--not if they have all the mounted police in London--shan't\nkeep me out.\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nCapes lit things wonderfully for Ann Veronica all that afternoon, he was\nso friendly, so palpably interested in her, and glad to have her back\nwith him. Tea in the laboratory was a sort of suffragette reception.\nMiss Garvice assumed a quality of neutrality, professed herself almost\nwon over by Ann Veronica's example, and the Scotchman decided that if\nwomen had a distinctive sphere it was, at any rate, an enlarging sphere,\nand no one who believed in the doctrine of evolution could logically\ndeny the vote to women \"ultimately,\" however much they might be disposed\nto doubt the advisability of its immediate concession. It was a refusal\nof expediency, he said, and not an absolute refusal. The youth with his\nhair like Russell cleared his throat and said rather irrelevantly that\nhe knew a man who knew Thomas Bayard Simmons, who had rioted in the\nStrangers' Gallery, and then Capes, finding them all distinctly pro-Ann\nVeronica, if not pro-feminist, ventured to be perverse, and started a\nvein of speculation upon the Scotchman's idea--that there were still\nhopes of women evolving into something higher.\n\nHe was unusually absurd and ready, and all the time it seemed to Ann\nVeronica as a delightful possibility, as a thing not indeed to be\nentertained seriously, but to be half furtively felt, that he was being\nso agreeable because she had come back again. She returned home through\na world that was as roseate as it had been gray overnight.\n\nBut as she got out of the train at Morningside Park Station she had a\nshock. She saw, twenty yards down the platform, the shiny hat and broad\nback and inimitable swagger of Ramage. She dived at once behind the\ncover of the lamp-room and affected serious trouble with her shoe-lace\nuntil he was out of the station, and then she followed slowly and with\nextreme discretion until the bifurcation of the Avenue from the field\nway insured her escape. Ramage went up the Avenue, and she hurried\nalong the path with a beating heart and a disagreeable sense of unsolved\nproblems in her mind.\n\n\"That thing's going on,\" she told herself. \"Everything goes on, confound\nit! One doesn't change anything one has set going by making good\nresolutions.\"\n\nAnd then ahead of her she saw the radiant and welcoming figure of\nManning. He came as an agreeable diversion from an insoluble perplexity.\nShe smiled at the sight of him, and thereat his radiation increased.\n\n\"I missed the hour of your release,\" he said, \"but I was at the\nVindicator Restaurant. You did not see me, I know. I was among the\ncommon herd in the place below, but I took good care to see you.\"\n\n\"Of course you're converted?\" she said.\n\n\"To the view that all those Splendid Women in the movement ought to have\nvotes. Rather! Who could help it?\"\n\nHe towered up over her and smiled down at her in his fatherly way.\n\n\"To the view that all women ought to have votes whether they like it or\nnot.\"\n\nHe shook his head, and his eyes and the mouth under the black mustache\nwrinkled with his smile. And as he walked by her side they began a\nwrangle that was none the less pleasant to Ann Veronica because it\nserved to banish a disagreeable preoccupation. It seemed to her in her\nrestored geniality that she liked Manning extremely. The brightness\nCapes had diffused over the world glorified even his rival.\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nThe steps by which Ann Veronica determined to engage herself to marry\nManning were never very clear to her. A medley of motives warred in her,\nand it was certainly not one of the least of these that she knew herself\nto be passionately in love with Capes; at moments she had a giddy\nintimation that he was beginning to feel keenly interested in her.\nShe realized more and more the quality of the brink upon which she\nstood--the dreadful readiness with which in certain moods she\nmight plunge, the unmitigated wrongness and recklessness of such a\nself-abandonment. \"He must never know,\" she would whisper to herself,\n\"he must never know. Or else--Else it will be impossible that I can be\nhis friend.\"\n\nThat simple statement of the case was by no means all that went on in\nAnn Veronica's mind. But it was the form of her ruling determination; it\nwas the only form that she ever allowed to see daylight. What else was\nthere lurked in shadows and deep places; if in some mood of reverie it\ncame out into the light, it was presently overwhelmed and hustled back\nagain into hiding. She would never look squarely at these dream forms\nthat mocked the social order in which she lived, never admit she\nlistened to the soft whisperings in her ear. But Manning seemed more and\nmore clearly indicated as a refuge, as security. Certain simple purposes\nemerged from the disingenuous muddle of her feelings and desires. Seeing\nCapes from day to day made a bright eventfulness that hampered her in\nthe course she had resolved to follow. She vanished from the laboratory\nfor a week, a week of oddly interesting days....\n\nWhen she renewed her attendance at the Imperial College the third finger\nof her left hand was adorned with a very fine old ring with dark blue\nsapphires that had once belonged to a great-aunt of Manning's.\n\nThat ring manifestly occupied her thoughts a great deal. She kept\npausing in her work and regarding it, and when Capes came round to her,\nshe first put her hand in her lap and then rather awkwardly in front of\nhim. But men are often blind to rings. He seemed to be.\n\nIn the afternoon she had considered certain doubts very carefully,\nand decided on a more emphatic course of action. \"Are these ordinary\nsapphires?\" she said. He bent to her hand, and she slipped off the ring\nand gave it to him to examine.\n\n\"Very good,\" he said. \"Rather darker than most of them. But I'm\ngenerously ignorant of gems. Is it an old ring?\" he asked, returning it.\n\n\"I believe it is. It's an engagement ring....\" She slipped it on her\nfinger, and added, in a voice she tried to make matter-of-fact: \"It was\ngiven to me last week.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said, in a colorless tone, and with his eyes on her face.\n\n\"Yes. Last week.\"\n\nShe glanced at him, and it was suddenly apparent for one instant of\nillumination that this ring upon her finger was the crowning blunder\nof her life. It was apparent, and then it faded into the quality of an\ninevitable necessity.\n\n\"Odd!\" he remarked, rather surprisingly, after a little interval.\n\nThere was a brief pause, a crowded pause, between them.\n\nShe sat very still, and his eyes rested on that ornament for a moment,\nand then travelled slowly to her wrist and the soft lines of her\nforearm.\n\n\"I suppose I ought to congratulate you,\" he said. Their eyes met, and\nhis expressed perplexity and curiosity. \"The fact is--I don't know\nwhy--this takes me by surprise. Somehow I haven't connected the idea\nwith you. You seemed complete--without that.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know why. But this is like--like walking round a house that\nlooks square and complete and finding an unexpected long wing running\nout behind.\"\n\nShe looked up at him, and found he was watching her closely. For some\nseconds of voluminous thinking they looked at the ring between them,\nand neither spoke. Then Capes shifted his eyes to her microscope and\nthe little trays of unmounted sections beside it. \"How is that carmine\nworking?\" he asked, with a forced interest.\n\n\"Better,\" said Ann Veronica, with an unreal alacrity. \"But it still\nmisses the nucleolus.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH\n\nTHE SAPPHIRE RING\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nFor a time that ring set with sapphires seemed to be, after all, the\nsatisfactory solution of Ann Veronica's difficulties. It was like\npouring a strong acid over dulled metal. A tarnish of constraint that\nhad recently spread over her intercourse with Capes vanished again. They\nembarked upon an open and declared friendship. They even talked about\nfriendship. They went to the Zoological Gardens together one Saturday to\nsee for themselves a point of morphological interest about the toucan's\nbill--that friendly and entertaining bird--and they spent the rest of\nthe afternoon walking about and elaborating in general terms this theme\nand the superiority of intellectual fellowship to all merely passionate\nrelationships. Upon this topic Capes was heavy and conscientious, but\nthat seemed to her to be just exactly what he ought to be. He was also,\nhad she known it, more than a little insincere. \"We are only in the dawn\nof the Age of Friendship,\" he said, \"when interest, I suppose, will\ntake the place of passions. Either you have had to love people or hate\nthem--which is a sort of love, too, in its way--to get anything out of\nthem. Now, more and more, we're going to be interested in them, to be\ncurious about them and--quite mildly-experimental with them.\" He seemed\nto be elaborating ideas as he talked. They watched the chimpanzees in\nthe new apes' house, and admired the gentle humanity of their eyes--\"so\nmuch more human than human beings\"--and they watched the Agile Gibbon in\nthe next apartment doing wonderful leaps and aerial somersaults.\n\n\"I wonder which of us enjoys that most,\" said Capes--\"does he, or do\nwe?\"\n\n\"He seems to get a zest--\"\n\n\"He does it and forgets it. We remember it. These joyful bounds just\nlace into the stuff of my memories and stay there forever. Living's just\nmaterial.\"\n\n\"It's very good to be alive.\"\n\n\"It's better to know life than be life.\"\n\n\"One may do both,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nShe was in a very uncritical state that afternoon. When he said, \"Let's\ngo and see the wart-hog,\" she thought no one ever had had so quick a\nflow of good ideas as he; and when he explained that sugar and not buns\nwas the talisman of popularity among the animals, she marvelled at his\npractical omniscience.\n\nFinally, at the exit into Regent's Park, they ran against Miss Klegg.\nIt was the expression of Miss Klegg's face that put the idea into Ann\nVeronica's head of showing Manning at the College one day, an idea which\nshe didn't for some reason or other carry out for a fortnight.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nWhen at last she did so, the sapphire ring took on a new quality in the\nimagination of Capes. It ceased to be the symbol of liberty and a remote\nand quite abstracted person, and became suddenly and very disagreeably\nthe token of a large and portentous body visible and tangible.\n\nManning appeared just at the end of the afternoon's work, and the\nbiologist was going through some perplexities the Scotchman had created\nby a metaphysical treatment of the skulls of Hyrax and a young African\nelephant. He was clearing up these difficulties by tracing a partially\nobliterated suture the Scotchman had overlooked when the door from the\npassage opened, and Manning came into his universe.\n\nSeen down the length of the laboratory, Manning looked a very handsome\nand shapely gentleman indeed, and, at the sight of his eager advance to\nhis fiancee, Miss Klegg replaced one long-cherished romance about Ann\nVeronica by one more normal and simple. He carried a cane and a silk\nhat with a mourning-band in one gray-gloved hand; his frock-coat and\ntrousers were admirable; his handsome face, his black mustache, his\nprominent brow conveyed an eager solicitude.\n\n\"I want,\" he said, with a white hand outstretched, \"to take you out to\ntea.\"\n\n\"I've been clearing up,\" said Ann Veronica, brightly.\n\n\"All your dreadful scientific things?\" he said, with a smile that Miss\nKlegg thought extraordinarily kindly.\n\n\"All my dreadful scientific things,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nHe stood back, smiling with an air of proprietorship, and looking about\nhim at the business-like equipment of the room. The low ceiling made him\nseem abnormally tall. Ann Veronica wiped a scalpel, put a card over a\nwatch-glass containing thin shreds of embryonic guinea-pig swimming in\nmauve stain, and dismantled her microscope.\n\n\"I wish I understood more of biology,\" said Manning.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" said Ann Veronica, closing her microscope-box with a click,\nand looking for one brief instant up the laboratory. \"We have no airs\nand graces here, and my hat hangs from a peg in the passage.\"\n\nShe led the way to the door, and Manning passed behind her and round her\nand opened the door for her. When Capes glanced up at them for a moment,\nManning seemed to be holding his arms all about her, and there was\nnothing but quiet acquiescence in her bearing.\n\nAfter Capes had finished the Scotchman's troubles he went back into the\npreparation-room. He sat down on the sill of the open window, folded his\narms, and stared straight before him for a long time over the wilderness\nof tiles and chimney-pots into a sky that was blue and empty. He was not\naddicted to monologue, and the only audible comment he permitted himself\nat first upon a universe that was evidently anything but satisfactory to\nhim that afternoon, was one compact and entirely unassigned \"Damn!\"\n\nThe word must have had some gratifying quality, because he repeated\nit. Then he stood up and repeated it again. \"The fool I have been!\" he\ncried; and now speech was coming to him. He tried this sentence with\nexpletives. \"Ass!\" he went on, still warming. \"Muck-headed moral ass! I\nought to have done anything.\n\n\"I ought to have done anything!\n\n\"What's a man for?\n\n\"Friendship!\"\n\nHe doubled up his fist, and seemed to contemplate thrusting it through\nthe window. He turned his back on that temptation. Then suddenly he\nseized a new preparation bottle that stood upon his table and contained\nthe better part of a week's work--a displayed dissection of a snail,\nbeautifully done--and hurled it across the room, to smash resoundingly\nupon the cemented floor under the bookcase; then, without either haste\nor pause, he swept his arm along a shelf of re-agents and sent them to\nmingle with the debris on the floor. They fell in a diapason of smashes.\n\"H'm!\" he said, regarding the wreckage with a calmer visage. \"Silly!\" he\nremarked after a pause. \"One hardly knows--all the time.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his pockets, his mouth puckered to a whistle, and he\nwent to the door of the outer preparation-room and stood there, looking,\nsave for the faintest intensification of his natural ruddiness, the\nembodiment of blond serenity.\n\n\"Gellett,\" he called, \"just come and clear up a mess, will you? I've\nsmashed some things.\"\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nThere was one serious flaw in Ann Veronica's arrangements for\nself-rehabilitation, and that was Ramage. He hung over her--he and his\nloan to her and his connection with her and that terrible evening--a\nvague, disconcerting possibility of annoyance and exposure. She could\nnot see any relief from this anxiety except repayment, and repayment\nseemed impossible. The raising of twenty-five pounds was a task\naltogether beyond her powers. Her birthday was four months away, and\nthat, at its extremist point, might give her another five pounds.\n\nThe thing rankled in her mind night and day. She would wake in the night\nto repeat her bitter cry: \"Oh, why did I burn those notes?\"\n\nIt added greatly to the annoyance of the situation that she had twice\nseen Ramage in the Avenue since her return to the shelter of her\nfather's roof. He had saluted her with elaborate civility, his eyes\ndistended with indecipherable meanings.\n\nShe felt she was bound in honor to tell the whole affair to Manning\nsooner or later. Indeed, it seemed inevitable that she must clear it up\nwith his assistance, or not at all. And when Manning was not about\nthe thing seemed simple enough. She would compose extremely lucid and\nhonorable explanations. But when it came to broaching them, it proved to\nbe much more difficult than she had supposed.\n\nThey went down the great staircase of the building, and, while she\nsought in her mind for a beginning, he broke into appreciation of her\nsimple dress and self-congratulations upon their engagement.\n\n\"It makes me feel,\" he said, \"that nothing is impossible--to have you\nhere beside me. I said, that day at Surbiton, 'There's many good things\nin life, but there's only one best, and that's the wild-haired girl\nwho's pulling away at that oar. I will make her my Grail, and some day,\nperhaps, if God wills, she shall become my wife!'\"\n\nHe looked very hard before him as he said this, and his voice was full\nof deep feeling.\n\n\"Grail!\" said Ann Veronica, and then: \"Oh, yes--of course! Anything but\na holy one, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Altogether holy, Ann Veronica. Ah! but you can't imagine what you are\nto me and what you mean to me! I suppose there is something mystical and\nwonderful about all women.\"\n\n\"There is something mystical and wonderful about all human beings. I\ndon't see that men need bank it with the women.\"\n\n\"A man does,\" said Manning--\"a true man, anyhow. And for me there is\nonly one treasure-house. By Jove! When I think of it I want to leap and\nshout!\"\n\n\"It would astonish that man with the barrow.\"\n\n\"It astonishes me that I don't,\" said Manning, in a tone of intense\nself-enjoyment.\n\n\"I think,\" began Ann Veronica, \"that you don't realize--\"\n\nHe disregarded her entirely. He waved an arm and spoke with a peculiar\nresonance. \"I feel like a giant! I believe now I shall do great things.\nGods! what it must be to pour out strong, splendid verse--mighty\nlines! mighty lines! If I do, Ann Veronica, it will be you. It will be\naltogether you. I will dedicate my books to you. I will lay them all at\nyour feet.\"\n\nHe beamed upon her.\n\n\"I don't think you realize,\" Ann Veronica began again, \"that I am rather\na defective human being.\"\n\n\"I don't want to,\" said Manning. \"They say there are spots on the sun.\nNot for me. It warms me, and lights me, and fills my world with flowers.\nWhy should I peep at it through smoked glass to see things that don't\naffect me?\" He smiled his delight at his companion.\n\n\"I've got bad faults.\"\n\nHe shook his head slowly, smiling mysteriously.\n\n\"But perhaps I want to confess them.\"\n\n\"I grant you absolution.\"\n\n\"I don't want absolution. I want to make myself visible to you.\"\n\n\"I wish I could make you visible to yourself. I don't believe in the\nfaults. They're just a joyous softening of the outline--more beautiful\nthan perfection. Like the flaws of an old marble. If you talk of your\nfaults, I shall talk of your splendors.\"\n\n\"I do want to tell you things, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"We'll have, thank God! ten myriad days to tell each other things. When\nI think of it--\"\n\n\"But these are things I want to tell you now!\"\n\n\"I made a little song of it. Let me say it to you. I've no name for it\nyet. Epithalamy might do.\n\n     \"Like him who stood on Darien\n     I view uncharted sea\n     Ten thousand days, ten thousand nights\n     Before my Queen and me.\n\n\"And that only brings me up to about sixty-five!\n\n     \"A glittering wilderness of time\n     That to the sunset reaches\n     No keel as yet its waves has ploughed\n     Or gritted on its beaches.\n\n     \"And we will sail that splendor wide,\n     From day to day together,\n     From isle to isle of happiness\n     Through year's of God's own weather.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his prospective fellow-sailor, \"that's very pretty.\" She\nstopped short, full of things un-said. Pretty! Ten thousand days, ten\nthousand nights!\n\n\"You shall tell me your faults,\" said Manning. \"If they matter to you,\nthey matter.\"\n\n\"It isn't precisely faults,\" said Ann Veronica. \"It's something that\nbothers me.\" Ten thousand! Put that way it seemed so different.\n\n\"Then assuredly!\" said Manning.\n\nShe found a little difficulty in beginning. She was glad when he went\non: \"I want to be your city of refuge from every sort of bother. I want\nto stand between you and all the force and vileness of the world. I want\nto make you feel that here is a place where the crowd does not clamor\nnor ill-winds blow.\"\n\n\"That is all very well,\" said Ann Veronica, unheeded.\n\n\"That is my dream of you,\" said Manning, warming. \"I want my life to be\nbeaten gold just in order to make it a fitting setting for yours. There\nyou will be, in an inner temple. I want to enrich it with hangings and\ngladden it with verses. I want to fill it with fine and precious things.\nAnd by degrees, perhaps, that maiden distrust of yours that makes you\nshrink from my kisses, will vanish.... Forgive me if a certain\nwarmth creeps into my words! The Park is green and gray to-day, but I am\nglowing pink and gold.... It is difficult to express these things.\"\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nThey sat with tea and strawberries and cream before them at a little\ntable in front of the pavilion in Regent's Park. Her confession was\nstill unmade. Manning leaned forward on the table, talking discursively\non the probable brilliance of their married life. Ann Veronica sat back\nin an attitude of inattention, her eyes on a distant game of cricket,\nher mind perplexed and busy. She was recalling the circumstances under\nwhich she had engaged herself to Manning, and trying to understand a\ncurious development of the quality of this relationship.\n\nThe particulars of her engagement were very clear in her memory. She had\ntaken care he should have this momentous talk with her on a garden-seat\ncommanded by the windows of the house. They had been playing tennis,\nwith his manifest intention looming over her.\n\n\"Let us sit down for a moment,\" he had said. He made his speech a little\nelaborately. She plucked at the knots of her racket and heard him to the\nend, then spoke in a restrained undertone.\n\n\"You ask me to be engaged to you, Mr. Manning,\" she began.\n\n\"I want to lay all my life at your feet.\"\n\n\"Mr. Manning, I do not think I love you.... I want to be very plain\nwith you. I have nothing, nothing that can possibly be passion for you.\nI am sure. Nothing at all.\"\n\nHe was silent for some moments.\n\n\"Perhaps that is only sleeping,\" he said. \"How can you know?\"\n\n\"I think--perhaps I am rather a cold-blooded person.\"\n\nShe stopped. He remained listening attentively.\n\n\"You have been very kind to me,\" she said.\n\n\"I would give my life for you.\"\n\nHer heart had warmed toward him. It had seemed to her that life might\nbe very good indeed with his kindliness and sacrifice about her. She\nthought of him as always courteous and helpful, as realizing, indeed,\nhis ideal of protection and service, as chivalrously leaving her free to\nlive her own life, rejoicing with an infinite generosity in every detail\nof her irresponsive being. She twanged the catgut under her fingers.\n\n\"It seems so unfair,\" she said, \"to take all you offer me and give so\nlittle in return.\"\n\n\"It is all the world to me. And we are not traders looking at\nequivalents.\"\n\n\"You know, Mr. Manning, I do not really want to marry.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It seems so--so unworthy\"--she picked among her phrases \"of the noble\nlove you give--\"\n\nShe stopped, through the difficulty she found in expressing herself.\n\n\"But I am judge of that,\" said Manning.\n\n\"Would you wait for me?\"\n\nManning was silent for a space. \"As my lady wills.\"\n\n\"Would you let me go on studying for a time?\"\n\n\"If you order patience.\"\n\n\"I think, Mr. Manning... I do not know. It is so difficult. When I\nthink of the love you give me--One ought to give you back love.\"\n\n\"You like me?\"\n\n\"Yes. And I am grateful to you....\"\n\nManning tapped with his racket on the turf through some moments of\nsilence. \"You are the most perfect, the most glorious of created\nthings--tender, frank intellectual, brave, beautiful. I am your\nservitor. I am ready to wait for you, to wait your pleasure, to give all\nmy life to winning it. Let me only wear your livery. Give me but leave\nto try. You want to think for a time, to be free for a time. That is so\nlike you, Diana--Pallas Athene! (Pallas Athene is better.) You are all\nthe slender goddesses. I understand. Let me engage myself. That is all I\nask.\"\n\nShe looked at him; his face, downcast and in profile, was handsome and\nstrong. Her gratitude swelled within her.\n\n\"You are too good for me,\" she said in a low voice.\n\n\"Then you--you will?\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"It isn't fair....\"\n\n\"But will you?\"\n\n\"YES.\"\n\nFor some seconds he had remained quite still.\n\n\"If I sit here,\" he said, standing up before her abruptly, \"I shall\nhave to shout. Let us walk about. Tum, tum, tirray, tum, tum, tum,\nte-tum--that thing of Mendelssohn's! If making one human being\nabsolutely happy is any satisfaction to you--\"\n\nHe held out his hands, and she also stood up.\n\nHe drew her close up to him with a strong, steady pull. Then suddenly,\nin front of all those windows, he folded her in his arms and pressed her\nto him, and kissed her unresisting face.\n\n\"Don't!\" cried Ann Veronica, struggling faintly, and he released her.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said. \"But I am at singing-pitch.\"\n\nShe had a moment of sheer panic at the thing she had done. \"Mr.\nManning,\" she said, \"for a time--Will you tell no one? Will you keep\nthis--our secret? I'm doubtful--Will you please not even tell my aunt?\"\n\n\"As you will,\" he said. \"But if my manner tells! I cannot help it if\nthat shows. You only mean a secret for a little time?\"\n\n\"Just for a little time,\" she said; \"yes....\"\n\nBut the ring, and her aunt's triumphant eye, and a note of approval in\nher father's manner, and a novel disposition in him to praise Manning\nin a just, impartial voice had soon placed very definite qualifications\nupon that covenanted secrecy.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nAt first the quality of her relationship to Manning seemed moving and\nbeautiful to Ann Veronica. She admired and rather pitied him, and she\nwas unfeignedly grateful to him. She even thought that perhaps she might\ncome to love him, in spite of that faint indefinable flavor of absurdity\nthat pervaded his courtly bearing. She would never love him as she\nloved Capes, of course, but there are grades and qualities of love.\nFor Manning it would be a more temperate love altogether. Much more\ntemperate; the discreet and joyless love of a virtuous, reluctant,\ncondescending wife. She had been quite convinced that an engagement with\nhim and at last a marriage had exactly that quality of compromise which\ndistinguishes the ways of the wise. It would be the wrappered world\nalmost at its best. She saw herself building up a life upon that--a\nlife restrained, kindly, beautiful, a little pathetic and altogether\ndignified; a life of great disciplines and suppressions and extensive\nreserves...\n\nBut the Ramage affair needed clearing up, of course; it was a flaw upon\nthat project. She had to explain about and pay off that forty pounds....\n\nThen, quite insensibly, her queenliness had declined. She was never able\nto trace the changes her attitude had undergone, from the time when she\nbelieved herself to be the pampered Queen of Fortune, the crown of a\ngood man's love (and secretly, but nobly, worshipping some one else),\nto the time when she realized she was in fact just a mannequin for her\nlover's imagination, and that he cared no more for the realities of her\nbeing, for the things she felt and desired, for the passions and dreams\nthat might move her, than a child cares for the sawdust in its doll. She\nwas the actress his whim had chosen to play a passive part....\n\nIt was one of the most educational disillusionments in Ann Veronica's\ncareer.\n\nBut did many women get anything better?\n\nThis afternoon, when she was urgent to explain her hampering and\ntainting complication with Ramage, the realization of this alien quality\nin her relationship with Manning became acute. Hitherto it had been\nqualified by her conception of all life as a compromise, by her new\neffort to be unexacting of life. But she perceived that to tell Manning\nof her Ramage adventures as they had happened would be like tarring\nfigures upon a water-color. They were in different key, they had a\ndifferent timbre. How could she tell him what indeed already began to\npuzzle herself, why she had borrowed that money at all? The plain fact\nwas that she had grabbed a bait. She had grabbed! She became less and\nless attentive to his meditative, self-complacent fragments of talk as\nshe told herself this. Her secret thoughts made some hasty, half-hearted\nexcursions into the possibility of telling the thing in romantic\ntones--Ramage was as a black villain, she as a white, fantastically\nwhite, maiden.... She doubted if Manning would even listen to that.\nHe would refuse to listen and absolve her unshriven.\n\nThen it came to her with a shock, as an extraordinary oversight, that\nshe could never tell Manning about Ramage--never.\n\nShe dismissed the idea of doing so. But that still left the forty\npounds!...\n\nHer mind went on generalizing. So it would always be between herself and\nManning. She saw her life before her robbed of all generous illusions,\nthe wrappered life unwrappered forever, vistas of dull responses, crises\nof make-believe, years of exacting mutual disregard in a misty garden of\nfine sentiments.\n\nBut did any woman get anything better from a man? Perhaps every woman\nconceals herself from a man perforce!...\n\nShe thought of Capes. She could not help thinking of Capes. Surely\nCapes was different. Capes looked at one and not over one, spoke to one,\ntreated one as a visible concrete fact. Capes saw her, felt for her,\ncared for her greatly, even if he did not love her. Anyhow, he did not\nsentimentalize her. And she had been doubting since that walk in the\nZoological Gardens whether, indeed, he did simply care for her. Little\nthings, almost impalpable, had happened to justify that doubt; something\nin his manner had belied his words. Did he not look for her in the\nmorning when she entered--come very quickly to her? She thought of him\nas she had last seen him looking down the length of the laboratory to\nsee her go. Why had he glanced up--quite in that way?...\n\nThe thought of Capes flooded her being like long-veiled sunlight\nbreaking again through clouds. It came to her like a dear thing\nrediscovered, that she loved Capes. It came to her that to marry any\none but Capes was impossible. If she could not marry him, she would not\nmarry any one. She would end this sham with Manning. It ought never\nto have begun. It was cheating, pitiful cheating. And then if some day\nCapes wanted her--saw fit to alter his views upon friendship....\n\nDim possibilities that she would not seem to look at even to herself\ngesticulated in the twilight background of her mind.\n\nShe leaped suddenly at a desperate resolution, and in one moment had\nmade it into a new self. She flung aside every plan she had in life,\nevery discretion. Of course, why not? She would be honest, anyhow!\n\nShe turned her eyes to Manning.\n\nHe was sitting back from the table now, with one arm over the back\nof his green chair and the other resting on the little table. He was\nsmiling under his heavy mustache, and his head was a little on one side\nas he looked at her.\n\n\"And what was that dreadful confession you had to make?\" he was saying.\nHis quiet, kindly smile implied his serene disbelief in any confessible\nthing. Ann Veronica pushed aside a tea-cup and the vestiges of her\nstrawberries and cream, and put her elbows before her on the table. \"Mr.\nManning,\" she said, \"I HAVE a confession to make.\"\n\n\"I wish you would use my Christian name,\" he said.\n\nShe attended to that, and then dismissed it as unimportant.\n\nSomething in her voice and manner conveyed an effect of unwonted gravity\nto him. For the first time he seemed to wonder what it might be that she\nhad to confess. His smile faded.\n\n\"I don't think our engagement can go on,\" she plunged, and felt exactly\nthat loss of breath that comes with a dive into icy water.\n\n\"But, how,\" he said, sitting up astonished beyond measure, \"not go on?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking while you have been talking. You see--I didn't\nunderstand.\"\n\nShe stared hard at her finger-nails. \"It is hard to express one's self,\nbut I do want to be honest with you. When I promised to marry you I\nthought I could; I thought it was a possible arrangement. I did think it\ncould be done. I admired your chivalry. I was grateful.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said.\n\nShe moved her elbow nearer to him and spoke in a still lower tone. \"I\ntold you I did not love you.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Manning, nodding gravely. \"It was fine and brave of you.\"\n\n\"But there is something more.\"\n\nShe paused again.\n\n\"I--I am sorry--I didn't explain. These things are difficult. It wasn't\nclear to me that I had to explain.... I love some one else.\"\n\nThey remained looking at each other for three or four seconds. Then\nManning flopped back in his chair and dropped his chin like a man shot.\nThere was a long silence between them.\n\n\"My God!\" he said at last, with tremendous feeling, and then again, \"My\nGod!\"\n\nNow that this thing was said her mind was clear and calm. She heard this\nstandard expression of a strong soul wrung with a critical coldness that\nastonished herself. She realized dimly that there was no personal thing\nbehind his cry, that countless myriads of Mannings had \"My God!\"-ed with\nan equal gusto at situations as flatly apprehended. This mitigated\nher remorse enormously. He rested his brow on his hand and conveyed\nmagnificent tragedy by his pose.\n\n\"But why,\" he said in the gasping voice of one subduing an agony, and\nlooked at her from under a pain-wrinkled brow, \"why did you not tell me\nthis before?\"\n\n\"I didn't know--I thought I might be able to control myself.\"\n\n\"And you can't?\"\n\n\"I don't think I ought to control myself.\"\n\n\"And I have been dreaming and thinking--\"\n\n\"I am frightfully sorry....\"\n\n\"But--This bolt from the blue! My God! Ann Veronica, you don't\nunderstand. This--this shatters a world!\"\n\nShe tried to feel sorry, but her sense of his immense egotism was strong\nand clear.\n\nHe went on with intense urgency.\n\n\"Why did you ever let me love you? Why did you ever let me peep through\nthe gates of Paradise? Oh! my God! I don't begin to feel and realize\nthis yet. It seems to me just talk; it seems to me like the fancy of a\ndream. Tell me I haven't heard. This is a joke of yours.\" He made his\nvoice very low and full, and looked closely into her face.\n\nShe twisted her fingers tightly. \"It isn't a joke,\" she said. \"I feel\nshabby and disgraced.... I ought never to have thought of it. Of you,\nI mean....\"\n\nHe fell back in his chair with an expression of tremendous desolation.\n\"My God!\" he said again....\n\nThey became aware of the waitress standing over them with book and\npencil ready for their bill. \"Never mind the bill,\" said Manning\ntragically, standing up and thrusting a four-shilling piece into her\nhand, and turning a broad back on her astonishment. \"Let us walk across\nthe Park at least,\" he said to Ann Veronica. \"Just at present my mind\nsimply won't take hold of this at all.... I tell you--never mind the\nbill. Keep it! Keep it!\"\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nThey walked a long way that afternoon. They crossed the Park to the\nwestward, and then turned back and walked round the circle about the\nRoyal Botanical Gardens and then southwardly toward Waterloo. They\ntrudged and talked, and Manning struggled, as he said, to \"get the hang\nof it all.\"\n\nIt was a long, meandering talk, stupid, shameful, and unavoidable. Ann\nVeronica was apologetic to the bottom of her soul. At the same time she\nwas wildly exultant at the resolution she had taken, the end she had\nmade to her blunder. She had only to get through this, to solace Manning\nas much as she could, to put such clumsy plasterings on his wounds as\nwere possible, and then, anyhow, she would be free--free to put her fate\nto the test. She made a few protests, a few excuses for her action in\naccepting him, a few lame explanations, but he did not heed them or care\nfor them. Then she realized that it was her business to let Manning talk\nand impose his own interpretations upon the situation so far as he was\nconcerned. She did her best to do this. But about his unknown rival he\nwas acutely curious.\n\nHe made her tell him the core of the difficulty.\n\n\"I cannot say who he is,\" said Ann Veronica, \"but he is a married\nman.... No! I do not even know that he cares for me. It is no good going\ninto that. Only I just want him. I just want him, and no one else will\ndo. It is no good arguing about a thing like that.\"\n\n\"But you thought you could forget him.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must have thought so. I didn't understand. Now I do.\"\n\n\"By God!\" said Manning, making the most of the word, \"I suppose it's\nfate. Fate! You are so frank so splendid!\n\n\"I'm taking this calmly now,\" he said, almost as if he apologized,\n\"because I'm a little stunned.\"\n\nThen he asked, \"Tell me! has this man, has he DARED to make love to\nyou?\"\n\nAnn Veronica had a vicious moment. \"I wish he had,\" she said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\nThe long inconsecutive conversation by that time was getting on her\nnerves. \"When one wants a thing more than anything else in the world,\"\nshe said with outrageous frankness, \"one naturally wishes one had it.\"\n\nShe shocked him by that. She shattered the edifice he was building up\nof himself as a devoted lover, waiting only his chance to win her from a\nhopeless and consuming passion.\n\n\"Mr. Manning,\" she said, \"I warned you not to idealize me. Men ought not\nto idealize any woman. We aren't worth it. We've done nothing to deserve\nit. And it hampers us. You don't know the thoughts we have; the things\nwe can do and say. You are a sisterless man; you have never heard the\nordinary talk that goes on at a girls' boarding-school.\"\n\n\"Oh! but you ARE splendid and open and fearless! As if I couldn't allow!\nWhat are all these little things? Nothing! Nothing! You can't sully\nyourself. You can't! I tell you frankly you may break off your\nengagement to me--I shall hold myself still engaged to you, yours just\nthe same. As for this infatuation--it's like some obsession, some\nmagic thing laid upon you. It's not you--not a bit. It's a thing that's\nhappened to you. It is like some accident. I don't care. In a sense I\ndon't care. It makes no difference.... All the same, I wish I had\nthat fellow by the throat! Just the virile, unregenerate man in me\nwishes that....\n\n\"I suppose I should let go if I had.\n\n\"You know,\" he went on, \"this doesn't seem to me to end anything.\n\n\"I'm rather a persistent person. I'm the sort of dog, if you turn it out\nof the room it lies down on the mat at the door. I'm not a lovesick\nboy. I'm a man, and I know what I mean. It's a tremendous blow, of\ncourse--but it doesn't kill me. And the situation it makes!--the\nsituation!\"\n\nThus Manning, egotistical, inconsecutive, unreal. And Ann Veronica\nwalked beside him, trying in vain to soften her heart to him by the\nthought of how she had ill-used him, and all the time, as her feet and\nmind grew weary together, rejoicing more and more that at the cost\nof this one interminable walk she escaped the prospect of--what was\nit?--\"Ten thousand days, ten thousand nights\" in his company. Whatever\nhappened she need never return to that possibility.\n\n\"For me,\" Manning went on, \"this isn't final. In a sense it alters\nnothing. I shall still wear your favor--even if it is a stolen and\nforbidden favor--in my casque.... I shall still believe in you. Trust\nyou.\"\n\nHe repeated several times that he would trust her, though it remained\nobscure just exactly where the trust came in.\n\n\"Look here,\" he cried out of a silence, with a sudden flash of\nunderstanding, \"did you mean to throw me over when you came out with me\nthis afternoon?\"\n\nAnn Veronica hesitated, and with a startled mind realized the truth.\n\"No,\" she answered, reluctantly.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Manning. \"Then I don't take this as final. That's all.\nI've bored you or something.... You think you love this other man! No\ndoubt you do love him. Before you have lived--\"\n\nHe became darkly prophetic. He thrust out a rhetorical hand.\n\n\"I will MAKE you love me! Until he has faded--faded into a memory...\"\n\nHe saw her into the train at Waterloo, and stood, a tall, grave figure,\nwith hat upraised, as the carriage moved forward slowly and hid him.\nAnn Veronica sat back with a sigh of relief. Manning might go on now\nidealizing her as much as he liked. She was no longer a confederate in\nthat. He might go on as the devoted lover until he tired. She had done\nforever with the Age of Chivalry, and her own base adaptations of its\ntraditions to the compromising life. She was honest again.\n\nBut when she turned her thoughts to Morningside Park she perceived the\ntangled skein of life was now to be further complicated by his romantic\nimportunity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH\n\nTHE COLLAPSE OF THE PENITENT\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nSpring had held back that year until the dawn of May, and then spring\nand summer came with a rush together. Two days after this conversation\nbetween Manning and Ann Veronica, Capes came into the laboratory at\nlunch-time and found her alone there standing by the open window, and\nnot even pretending to be doing anything.\n\nHe came in with his hands in his trousers pockets and a general air\nof depression in his bearing. He was engaged in detesting Manning and\nhimself in almost equal measure. His face brightened at the sight of\nher, and he came toward her.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Ann Veronica, and stared over her shoulder out of the\nwindow.\n\n\"So am I.... Lassitude?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"_I_ can't work.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nPause.\n\n\"It's the spring,\" he said. \"It's the warming up of the year, the coming\nof the light mornings, the way in which everything begins to run about\nand begin new things. Work becomes distasteful; one thinks of holidays.\nThis year--I've got it badly. I want to get away. I've never wanted to\nget away so much.\"\n\n\"Where do you go?\"\n\n\"Oh!--Alps.\"\n\n\"Climbing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's rather a fine sort of holiday!\"\n\nHe made no answer for three or four seconds.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I want to get away. I feel at moments as though I could\nbolt for it.... Silly, isn't it? Undisciplined.\"\n\nHe went to the window and fidgeted with the blind, looking out to where\nthe tree-tops of Regent's Park showed distantly over the houses. He\nturned round toward her and found her looking at him and standing very\nstill.\n\n\"It's the stir of spring,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe it is.\"\n\nShe glanced out of the window, and the distant trees were a froth of\nhard spring green and almond blossom. She formed a wild resolution,\nand, lest she should waver from it, she set about at once to realize it.\n\"I've broken off my engagement,\" she said, in a matter-of-fact tone, and\nfound her heart thumping in her neck. He moved slightly, and she\nwent on, with a slight catching of her breath: \"It's a bother and\ndisturbance, but you see--\" She had to go through with it now, because\nshe could think of nothing but her preconceived words. Her voice was\nweak and flat.\n\n\"I've fallen in love.\"\n\nHe never helped her by a sound.\n\n\"I--I didn't love the man I was engaged to,\" she said. She met his eyes\nfor a moment, and could not interpret their expression. They struck her\nas cold and indifferent.\n\nHer heart failed her and her resolution became water. She remained\nstanding stiffly, unable even to move. She could not look at him through\nan interval that seemed to her a vast gulf of time. But she felt his lax\nfigure become rigid.\n\nAt last his voice came to release her tension.\n\n\"I thought you weren't keeping up to the mark. You--It's jolly of you to\nconfide in me. Still--\" Then, with incredible and obviously deliberate\nstupidity, and a voice as flat as her own, he asked, \"Who is the man?\"\n\nHer spirit raged within her at the dumbness, the paralysis that had\nfallen upon her. Grace, confidence, the power of movement even, seemed\ngone from her. A fever of shame ran through her being. Horrible doubts\nassailed her. She sat down awkwardly and helplessly on one of the little\nstools by her table and covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"Can't you SEE how things are?\" she said.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nBefore Capes could answer her in any way the door at the end of the\nlaboratory opened noisily and Miss Klegg appeared. She went to her own\ntable and sat down. At the sound of the door Ann Veronica uncovered\na tearless face, and with one swift movement assumed a conversational\nattitude. Things hung for a moment in an awkward silence.\n\n\"You see,\" said Ann Veronica, staring before her at the window-sash,\n\"that's the form my question takes at the present time.\"\n\nCapes had not quite the same power of recovery. He stood with his\nhands in his pockets looking at Miss Klegg's back. His face was white.\n\"It's--it's a difficult question.\" He appeared to be paralyzed by\nabstruse acoustic calculations. Then, very awkwardly, he took a stool\nand placed it at the end of Ann Veronica's table, and sat down. He\nglanced at Miss Klegg again, and spoke quickly and furtively, with eager\neyes on Ann Veronica's face.\n\n\"I had a faint idea once that things were as you say they are, but the\naffair of the ring--of the unexpected ring--puzzled me. Wish SHE\"--he\nindicated Miss Klegg's back with a nod--\"was at the bottom of the\nsea.... I would like to talk to you about this--soon. If you don't think\nit would be a social outrage, perhaps I might walk with you to your\nrailway station.\"\n\n\"I will wait,\" said Ann Veronica, still not looking at him, \"and we will\ngo into Regent's Park. No--you shall come with me to Waterloo.\"\n\n\"Right!\" he said, and hesitated, and then got up and went into the\npreparation-room.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nFor a time they walked in silence through the back streets that lead\nsouthward from the College. Capes bore a face of infinite perplexity.\n\n\"The thing I feel most disposed to say, Miss Stanley,\" he began at last,\n\"is that this is very sudden.\"\n\n\"It's been coming on since first I came into the laboratory.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asked, bluntly.\n\n\"You!\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nThe sense of publicity, of people coming and going about them, kept\nthem both unemotional. And neither had any of that theatricality which\ndemands gestures and facial expression.\n\n\"I suppose you know I like you tremendously?\" he pursued.\n\n\"You told me that in the Zoological Gardens.\"\n\nShe found her muscles a-tremble. But there was nothing in her bearing\nthat a passer-by would have noted, to tell of the excitement that\npossessed her.\n\n\"I\"--he seemed to have a difficulty with the word--\"I love you. I've\ntold you that practically already. But I can give it its name now. You\nneedn't be in any doubt about it. I tell you that because it puts us on\na footing....\"\n\nThey went on for a time without another word.\n\n\"But don't you know about me?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Something. Not much.\"\n\n\"I'm a married man. And my wife won't live with me for reasons that I\nthink most women would consider sound.... Or I should have made love\nto you long ago.\"\n\nThere came a silence again.\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"But if you knew anything of that--\"\n\n\"I did. It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"Why did you tell me? I thought--I thought we were going to be friends.\"\n\nHe was suddenly resentful. He seemed to charge her with the ruin of\ntheir situation. \"Why on earth did you TELL me?\" he cried.\n\n\"I couldn't help it. It was an impulse. I HAD to.\"\n\n\"But it changes things. I thought you understood.\"\n\n\"I had to,\" she repeated. \"I was sick of the make-believe. I don't care!\nI'm glad I did. I'm glad I did.\"\n\n\"Look here!\" said Capes, \"what on earth do you want? What do you think\nwe can do? Don't you know what men are, and what life is?--to come to me\nand talk to me like this!\"\n\n\"I know--something, anyhow. But I don't care; I haven't a spark of\nshame. I don't see any good in life if it hasn't got you in it. I wanted\nyou to know. And now you know. And the fences are down for good. You\ncan't look me in the eyes and say you don't care for me.\"\n\n\"I've told you,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Ann Veronica, with an air of concluding the\ndiscussion.\n\nThey walked side by side for a time.\n\n\"In that laboratory one gets to disregard these passions,\" began Capes.\n\"Men are curious animals, with a trick of falling in love readily\nwith girls about your age. One has to train one's self not to. I've\naccustomed myself to think of you--as if you were like every other\ngirl who works at the schools--as something quite outside these\npossibilities. If only out of loyalty to co-education one has to do\nthat. Apart from everything else, this meeting of ours is a breach of a\ngood rule.\"\n\n\"Rules are for every day,\" said Ann Veronica. \"This is not every day.\nThis is something above all rules.\"\n\n\"For you.\"\n\n\"Not for you?\"\n\n\"No. No; I'm going to stick to the rules.... It's odd, but nothing\nbut cliche seems to meet this case. You've placed me in a very\nexceptional position, Miss Stanley.\" The note of his own voice\nexasperated him. \"Oh, damn!\" he said.\n\nShe made no answer, and for a time he debated some problems with\nhimself.\n\n\"No!\" he said aloud at last.\n\n\"The plain common-sense of the case,\" he said, \"is that we can't\npossibly be lovers in the ordinary sense. That, I think, is manifest.\nYou know, I've done no work at all this afternoon. I've been smoking\ncigarettes in the preparation-room and thinking this out. We can't be\nlovers in the ordinary sense, but we can be great and intimate friends.\"\n\n\"We are,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"You've interested me enormously....\"\n\nHe paused with a sense of ineptitude. \"I want to be your friend,\" he\nsaid. \"I said that at the Zoo, and I mean it. Let us be friends--as near\nand close as friends can be.\"\n\nAnn Veronica gave him a pallid profile.\n\n\"What is the good of pretending?\" she said.\n\n\"We don't pretend.\"\n\n\"We do. Love is one thing and friendship quite another. Because I'm\nyounger than you.... I've got imagination.... I know what I am\ntalking about. Mr. Capes, do you think... do you think I don't know\nthe meaning of love?\"\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nCapes made no answer for a time.\n\n\"My mind is full of confused stuff,\" he said at length. \"I've been\nthinking--all the afternoon. Oh, and weeks and months of thought and\nfeeling there are bottled up too.... I feel a mixture of beast and\nuncle. I feel like a fraudulent trustee. Every rule is against me--Why\ndid I let you begin this? I might have told--\"\n\n\"I don't see that you could help--\"\n\n\"I might have helped--\"\n\n\"You couldn't.\"\n\n\"I ought to have--all the same.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said, and went off at a tangent. \"You know about my\nscandalous past?\"\n\n\"Very little. It doesn't seem to matter. Does it?\"\n\n\"I think it does. Profoundly.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"It prevents our marrying. It forbids--all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"It can't prevent our loving.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it can't. But, by Jove! it's going to make our loving a\nfiercely abstract thing.\"\n\n\"You are separated from your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, but do you know how?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Why on earth--? A man ought to be labelled. You see, I'm separated from\nmy wife. But she doesn't and won't divorce me. You don't understand\nthe fix I am in. And you don't know what led to our separation. And, in\nfact, all round the problem you don't know and I don't see how I could\npossibly have told you before. I wanted to, that day in the Zoo. But I\ntrusted to that ring of yours.\"\n\n\"Poor old ring!\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I ought never have gone to the Zoo, I suppose. I asked you to go. But\na man is a mixed creature.... I wanted the time with you. I wanted it\nbadly.\"\n\n\"Tell me about yourself,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"To begin with, I was--I was in the divorce court. I was--I was a\nco-respondent. You understand that term?\"\n\nAnn Veronica smiled faintly. \"A modern girl does understand these terms.\nShe reads novels--and history--and all sorts of things. Did you really\ndoubt if I knew?\"\n\n\"No. But I don't suppose you can understand.\"\n\n\"I don't see why I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"To know things by name is one thing; to know them by seeing them and\nfeeling them and being them quite another. That is where life takes\nadvantage of youth. You don't understand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I don't.\"\n\n\"You don't. That's the difficulty. If I told you the facts, I expect,\nsince you are in love with me, you'd explain the whole business as being\nvery fine and honorable for me--the Higher Morality, or something of\nthat sort.... It wasn't.\"\n\n\"I don't deal very much,\" said Ann Veronica, \"in the Higher Morality, or\nthe Higher Truth, or any of those things.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you don't. But a human being who is young and clean, as you\nare, is apt to ennoble--or explain away.\"\n\n\"I've had a biological training. I'm a hard young woman.\"\n\n\"Nice clean hardness, anyhow. I think you are hard. There's\nsomething--something ADULT about you. I'm talking to you now as though\nyou had all the wisdom and charity in the world. I'm going to tell you\nthings plainly. Plainly. It's best. And then you can go home and think\nthings over before we talk again. I want you to be clear what you're\nreally and truly up to, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I don't mind knowing,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"It's precious unromantic.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me.\"\n\n\"I married pretty young,\" said Capes. \"I've got--I have to tell you this\nto make myself clear--a streak of ardent animal in my composition. I\nmarried--I married a woman whom I still think one of the most beautiful\npersons in the world. She is a year or so older than I am, and she is,\nwell, of a very serene and proud and dignified temperament. If you met\nher you would, I am certain, think her as fine as I do. She has never\ndone a really ignoble thing that I know of--never. I met her when we\nwere both very young, as young as you are. I loved her and made love to\nher, and I don't think she quite loved me back in the same way.\"\n\nHe paused for a time. Ann Veronica said nothing.\n\n\"These are the sort of things that aren't supposed to happen. They leave\nthem out of novels--these incompatibilities. Young people ignore them\nuntil they find themselves up against them. My wife doesn't understand,\ndoesn't understand now. She despises me, I suppose.... We married,\nand for a time we were happy. She was fine and tender. I worshipped her\nand subdued myself.\"\n\nHe left off abruptly. \"Do you understand what I am talking about? It's\nno good if you don't.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said Ann Veronica, and colored. \"In fact, yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Do you think of these things--these matters--as belonging to our Higher\nNature or our Lower?\"\n\n\"I don't deal in Higher Things, I tell you,\" said Ann Veronica, \"or\nLower, for the matter of that. I don't classify.\" She hesitated. \"Flesh\nand flowers are all alike to me.\"\n\n\"That's the comfort of you. Well, after a time there came a fever in\nmy blood. Don't think it was anything better than fever--or a bit\nbeautiful. It wasn't. Quite soon, after we were married--it was just\nwithin a year--I formed a friendship with the wife of a friend, a woman\neight years older than myself.... It wasn't anything splendid, you\nknow. It was just a shabby, stupid, furtive business that began between\nus. Like stealing. We dressed it in a little music.... I want you to\nunderstand clearly that I was indebted to the man in many small ways. I\nwas mean to him.... It was the gratification of an immense necessity.\nWe were two people with a craving. We felt like thieves. We WERE\nthieves.... We LIKED each other well enough. Well, my friend found\nus out, and would give no quarter. He divorced her. How do you like the\nstory?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Ann Veronica, a little hoarsely, \"tell me all of it.\"\n\n\"My wife was astounded--wounded beyond measure. She thought me--filthy.\nAll her pride raged at me. One particularly humiliating thing came\nout--humiliating for me. There was a second co-respondent. I hadn't\nheard of him before the trial. I don't know why that should be so\nacutely humiliating. There's no logic in these things. It was.\"\n\n\"Poor you!\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"My wife refused absolutely to have anything more to do with me. She\ncould hardly speak to me; she insisted relentlessly upon a separation.\nShe had money of her own--much more than I have--and there was no need\nto squabble about that. She has given herself up to social work.\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"That's all. Practically all. And yet--Wait a little, you'd better have\nevery bit of it. One doesn't go about with these passions allayed simply\nbecause they have made wreckage and a scandal. There one is! The same\nstuff still! One has a craving in one's blood, a craving roused, cut off\nfrom its redeeming and guiding emotional side. A man has more freedom to\ndo evil than a woman. Irregularly, in a quite inglorious and unromantic\nway, you know, I am a vicious man. That's--that's my private life. Until\nthe last few months. It isn't what I have been but what I am. I haven't\ntaken much account of it until now. My honor has been in my scientific\nwork and public discussion and the things I write. Lots of us are like\nthat. But, you see, I'm smirched. For the sort of love-making you think\nabout. I've muddled all this business. I've had my time and lost my\nchances. I'm damaged goods. And you're as clean as fire. You come with\nthose clear eyes of yours, as valiant as an angel....\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly.\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"It's so strange to think of you--troubled by such things. I didn't\nthink--I don't know what I thought. Suddenly all this makes you human.\nMakes you real.\"\n\n\"But don't you see how I must stand to you? Don't you see how it bars us\nfrom being lovers--You can't--at first. You must think it over. It's all\noutside the world of your experience.\"\n\n\"I don't think it makes a rap of difference, except for one thing. I\nlove you more. I've wanted you--always. I didn't dream, not even in my\nwildest dreaming, that--you might have any need of me.\"\n\nHe made a little noise in his throat as if something had cried out\nwithin him, and for a time they were both too full for speech.\n\nThey were going up the slope into Waterloo Station.\n\n\"You go home and think of all this,\" he said, \"and talk about it\nto-morrow. Don't, don't say anything now, not anything. As for loving\nyou, I do. I do--with all my heart. It's no good hiding it any more.\nI could never have talked to you like this, forgetting everything that\nparts us, forgetting even your age, if I did not love you utterly. If\nI were a clean, free man--We'll have to talk of all these things. Thank\ngoodness there's plenty of opportunity! And we two can talk. Anyhow, now\nyou've begun it, there's nothing to keep us in all this from being the\nbest friends in the world. And talking of every conceivable thing. Is\nthere?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Ann Veronica, with a radiant face.\n\n\"Before this there was a sort of restraint--a make-believe. It's gone.\"\n\n\"It's gone.\"\n\n\"Friendship and love being separate things. And that confounded\nengagement!\"\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\nThey came upon a platform, and stood before her compartment.\n\nHe took her hand and looked into her eyes and spoke, divided against\nhimself, in a voice that was forced and insincere.\n\n\"I shall be very glad to have you for a friend,\" he said, \"loving\nfriend. I had never dreamed of such a friend as you.\"\n\nShe smiled, sure of herself beyond any pretending, into his troubled\neyes. Hadn't they settled that already?\n\n\"I want you as a friend,\" he persisted, almost as if he disputed\nsomething.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nThe next morning she waited in the laboratory at the lunch-hour in the\nreasonable certainty that he would come to her.\n\n\"Well, you have thought it over?\" he said, sitting down beside her.\n\n\"I've been thinking of you all night,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I don't care a rap for all these things.\"\n\nHe said nothing for a space.\n\n\"I don't see there's any getting away from the fact that you and I love\neach other,\" he said, slowly. \"So far you've got me and I you....\nYou've got me. I'm like a creature just wakened up. My eyes are open to\nyou. I keep on thinking of you. I keep on thinking of little details and\naspects of your voice, your eyes, the way you walk, the way your hair\ngoes back from the side of your forehead. I believe I have always been\nin love with you. Always. Before ever I knew you.\"\n\nShe sat motionless, with her hand tightening over the edge of the table,\nand he, too, said no more. She began to tremble violently.\n\nHe stood up abruptly and went to the window.\n\n\"We have,\" he said, \"to be the utmost friends.\"\n\nShe stood up and held her arms toward him. \"I want you to kiss me,\" she\nsaid.\n\nHe gripped the window-sill behind him.\n\n\"If I do,\" he said.... \"No! I want to do without that. I want to\ndo without that for a time. I want to give you time to think. I am a\nman--of a sort of experience. You are a girl with very little. Just sit\ndown on that stool again and let's talk of this in cold blood. People of\nyour sort--I don't want the instincts to--to rush our situation. Are you\nsure what it is you want of me?\"\n\n\"I want you. I want you to be my lover. I want to give myself to you.\nI want to be whatever I can to you.\" She paused for a moment. \"Is that\nplain?\" she asked.\n\n\"If I didn't love you better than myself,\" said Capes, \"I wouldn't fence\nlike this with you.\n\n\"I am convinced you haven't thought this out,\" he went on. \"You do not\nknow what such a relation means. We are in love. Our heads swim with\nthe thought of being together. But what can we do? Here am I, fixed to\nrespectability and this laboratory; you're living at home. It means...\njust furtive meetings.\"\n\n\"I don't care how we meet,\" she said.\n\n\"It will spoil your life.\"\n\n\"It will make it. I want you. I am clear I want you. You are different\nfrom all the world for me. You can think all round me. You are the one\nperson I can understand and feel--feel right with. I don't idealize you.\nDon't imagine that. It isn't because you're good, but because I may be\nrotten bad; and there's something--something living and understanding\nin you. Something that is born anew each time we meet, and pines when\nwe are separated. You see, I'm selfish. I'm rather scornful. I think\ntoo much about myself. You're the only person I've really given good,\nstraight, unselfish thought to. I'm making a mess of my life--unless\nyou come in and take it. I am. In you--if you can love me--there\nis salvation. Salvation. I know what I am doing better than you do.\nThink--think of that engagement!\"\n\nTheir talk had come to eloquent silences that contradicted all he had to\nsay.\n\nShe stood up before him, smiling faintly.\n\n\"I think we've exhausted this discussion,\" she said.\n\n\"I think we have,\" he answered, gravely, and took her in his arms, and\nsmoothed her hair from her forehead, and very tenderly kissed her lips.\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nThey spent the next Sunday in Richmond Park, and mingled the happy\nsensation of being together uninterruptedly through the long sunshine\nof a summer's day with the ample discussion of their position. \"This has\nall the clean freshness of spring and youth,\" said Capes; \"it is love\nwith the down on; it is like the glitter of dew in the sunlight to be\nlovers such as we are, with no more than one warm kiss between us. I\nlove everything to-day, and all of you, but I love this, this--this\ninnocence upon us most of all.\n\n\"You can't imagine,\" he said, \"what a beastly thing a furtive love\naffair can be.\n\n\"This isn't furtive,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Not a bit of it. And we won't make it so.... We mustn't make it so.\"\n\nThey loitered under trees, they sat on mossy banks they gossiped on\nfriendly benches, they came back to lunch at the \"Star and Garter,\"\nand talked their afternoon away in the garden that looks out upon the\ncrescent of the river. They had a universe to talk about--two universes.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" said Capes, with his eyes on the broad\ndistances beyond the ribbon of the river.\n\n\"I will do whatever you want,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"My first love was all blundering,\" said Capes.\n\nHe thought for a moment, and went on: \"Love is something that has to be\ntaken care of. One has to be so careful.... It's a beautiful plant,\nbut a tender one.... I didn't know. I've a dread of love dropping its\npetals, becoming mean and ugly. How can I tell you all I feel? I love\nyou beyond measure. And I'm afraid.... I'm anxious, joyfully anxious,\nlike a man when he has found a treasure.\"\n\n\"YOU know,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I just came to you and put myself in\nyour hands.\"\n\n\"That's why, in a way, I'm prudish. I've--dreads. I don't want to tear\nat you with hot, rough hands.\"\n\n\"As you will, dear lover. But for me it doesn't matter. Nothing is wrong\nthat you do. Nothing. I am quite clear about this. I know exactly what I\nam doing. I give myself to you.\"\n\n\"God send you may never repent it!\" cried Capes.\n\nShe put her hand in his to be squeezed.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"it is doubtful if we can ever marry. Very doubtful.\nI have been thinking--I will go to my wife again. I will do my utmost.\nBut for a long time, anyhow, we lovers have to be as if we were no more\nthan friends.\"\n\nHe paused. She answered slowly. \"That is as you will,\" she said.\n\n\"Why should it matter?\" he said.\n\nAnd then, as she answered nothing, \"Seeing that we are lovers.\"\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nIt was rather less than a week after that walk that Capes came and sat\ndown beside Ann Veronica for their customary talk in the lunch hour. He\ntook a handful of almonds and raisins that she held out to him--for\nboth these young people had given up the practice of going out for\nluncheon--and kept her hand for a moment to kiss her finger-tips. He did\nnot speak for a moment.\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\"I say!\" he said, without any movement. \"Let's go.\"\n\n\"Go!\" She did not understand him at first, and then her heart began to\nbeat very rapidly.\n\n\"Stop this--this humbugging,\" he explained. \"It's like the Picture and\nthe Bust. I can't stand it. Let's go. Go off and live together--until we\ncan marry. Dare you?\"\n\n\"Do you mean NOW?\"\n\n\"At the end of the session. It's the only clean way for us. Are you\nprepared to do it?\"\n\nHer hands clenched. \"Yes,\" she said, very faintly. And then: \"Of course!\nAlways. It is what I have wanted, what I have meant all along.\"\n\nShe stared before her, trying to keep back a rush of tears.\n\nCapes kept obstinately stiff, and spoke between his teeth.\n\n\"There's endless reasons, no doubt, why we shouldn't,\" he said.\n\"Endless. It's wrong in the eyes of most people. For many of them it\nwill smirch us forever.... You DO understand?\"\n\n\"Who cares for most people?\" she said, not looking at him.\n\n\"I do. It means social isolation--struggle.\"\n\n\"If you dare--I dare,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I was never so clear in all\nmy life as I have been in this business.\" She lifted steadfast eyes to\nhim. \"Dare!\" she said. The tears were welling over now, but her voice\nwas steady. \"You're not a man for me--not one of a sex, I mean. You're\njust a particular being with nothing else in the world to class with\nyou. You are just necessary to life for me. I've never met any one\nlike you. To have you is all important. Nothing else weighs against it.\nMorals only begin when that is settled. I sha'n't care a rap if we can\nnever marry. I'm not a bit afraid of anything--scandal, difficulty,\nstruggle.... I rather want them. I do want them.\"\n\n\"You'll get them,\" he said. \"This means a plunge.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Only for you! Most of my income will vanish. Even unbelieving\nbiological demonstrators must respect decorum; and besides, you see--you\nwere a student. We shall have--hardly any money.\"\n\n\"I don't care.\"\n\n\"Hardship and danger.\"\n\n\"With you!\"\n\n\"And as for your people?\"\n\n\"They don't count. That is the dreadful truth. This--all this swamps\nthem. They don't count, and I don't care.\"\n\nCapes suddenly abandoned his attitude of meditative restraint. \"By\nJove!\" he broke out, \"one tries to take a serious, sober view. I don't\nquite know why. But this is a great lark, Ann Veronica! This turns life\ninto a glorious adventure!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she cried in triumph.\n\n\"I shall have to give up biology, anyhow. I've always had a sneaking\ndesire for the writing-trade. That is what I must do. I can.\"\n\n\"Of course you can.\"\n\n\"And biology was beginning to bore me a bit. One research is very like\nanother.... Latterly I've been doing things.... Creative work\nappeals to me wonderfully. Things seem to come rather easily.... But\nthat, and that sort of thing, is just a day-dream. For a time I must do\njournalism and work hard.... What isn't a day-dream is this: that you\nand I are going to put an end to flummery--and go!\"\n\n\"Go!\" said Ann Veronica, clenching her hands.\n\n\"For better or worse.\"\n\n\"For richer or poorer.\"\n\nShe could not go on, for she was laughing and crying at the same time.\n\"We were bound to do this when you kissed me,\" she sobbed through\nher tears. \"We have been all this time--Only your queer code of\nhonor--Honor! Once you begin with love you have to see it through.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH\n\nTHE LAST DAYS AT HOME\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nThey decided to go to Switzerland at the session's end. \"We'll clean up\neverything tidy,\" said Capes....\n\nFor her pride's sake, and to save herself from long day-dreams and an\nunappeasable longing for her lover, Ann Veronica worked hard at her\nbiology during those closing weeks. She was, as Capes had said, a\nhard young woman. She was keenly resolved to do well in the school\nexamination, and not to be drowned in the seas of emotion that\nthreatened to submerge her intellectual being.\n\nNevertheless, she could not prevent a rising excitement as the dawn of\nthe new life drew near to her--a thrilling of the nerves, a secret\nand delicious exaltation above the common circumstances of\nexistence. Sometimes her straying mind would become astonishingly\nactive--embroidering bright and decorative things that she could say to\nCapes; sometimes it passed into a state of passive acquiescence, into\na radiant, formless, golden joy. She was aware of people--her aunt,\nher father, her fellow-students, friends, and neighbors--moving about\noutside this glowing secret, very much as an actor is aware of the dim\naudience beyond the barrier of the footlights. They might applaud, or\nobject, or interfere, but the drama was her very own. She was going\nthrough with that, anyhow.\n\nThe feeling of last days grew stronger with her as their number\ndiminished. She went about the familiar home with a clearer and clearer\nsense of inevitable conclusions. She became exceptionally considerate\nand affectionate with her father and aunt, and more and more concerned\nabout the coming catastrophe that she was about to precipitate upon\nthem. Her aunt had a once exasperating habit of interrupting her work\nwith demands for small household services, but now Ann Veronica rendered\nthem with a queer readiness of anticipatory propitiation. She was\ngreatly exercised by the problem of confiding in the Widgetts; they were\ndears, and she talked away two evenings with Constance without broaching\nthe topic; she made some vague intimations in letters to Miss Miniver\nthat Miss Miniver failed to mark. But she did not bother her head very\nmuch about her relations with these sympathizers.\n\nAnd at length her penultimate day in Morningside Park dawned for her.\nShe got up early, and walked about the garden in the dewy June sunshine\nand revived her childhood. She was saying good-bye to childhood and\nhome, and her making; she was going out into the great, multitudinous\nworld; this time there would be no returning. She was at the end of\ngirlhood and on the eve of a woman's crowning experience. She visited\nthe corner that had been her own little garden--her forget-me-nots and\ncandytuft had long since been elbowed into insignificance by weeds; she\nvisited the raspberry-canes that had sheltered that first love affair\nwith the little boy in velvet, and the greenhouse where she had been\nwont to read her secret letters. Here was the place behind the shed\nwhere she had used to hide from Roddy's persecutions, and here the\nborder of herbaceous perennials under whose stems was fairyland. The\nback of the house had been the Alps for climbing, and the shrubs\nin front of it a Terai. The knots and broken pale that made the\ngarden-fence scalable, and gave access to the fields behind, were still\nto be traced. And here against a wall were the plum-trees. In spite of\nGod and wasps and her father, she had stolen plums; and once because of\ndiscovered misdeeds, and once because she had realized that her mother\nwas dead, she had lain on her face in the unmown grass, beneath the\nelm-trees that came beyond the vegetables, and poured out her soul in\nweeping.\n\nRemote little Ann Veronica! She would never know the heart of that child\nagain! That child had loved fairy princes with velvet suits and golden\nlocks, and she was in love with a real man named Capes, with little\ngleams of gold on his cheek and a pleasant voice and firm and shapely\nhands. She was going to him soon and certainly, going to his strong,\nembracing arms. She was going through a new world with him side by side.\nShe had been so busy with life that, for a vast gulf of time, as it\nseemed, she had given no thought to those ancient, imagined things of\nher childhood. Now, abruptly, they were real again, though very distant,\nand she had come to say farewell to them across one sundering year.\n\nShe was unusually helpful at breakfast, and unselfish about the eggs:\nand then she went off to catch the train before her father's. She did\nthis to please him. He hated travelling second-class with her--indeed,\nhe never did--but he also disliked travelling in the same train when his\ndaughter was in an inferior class, because of the look of the thing.\nSo he liked to go by a different train. And in the Avenue she had an\nencounter with Ramage.\n\nIt was an odd little encounter, that left vague and dubitable\nimpressions in her mind. She was aware of him--a silk-hatted,\nshiny-black figure on the opposite side of the Avenue; and then,\nabruptly and startlingly, he crossed the road and saluted and spoke to\nher.\n\n\"I MUST speak to you,\" he said. \"I can't keep away from you.\"\n\nShe made some inane response. She was struck by a change in his\nappearance. His eyes looked a little bloodshot to her; his face had lost\nsomething of its ruddy freshness.\n\nHe began a jerky, broken conversation that lasted until they reached the\nstation, and left her puzzled at its drift and meaning. She quickened\nher pace, and so did he, talking at her slightly averted ear. She made\nlumpish and inadequate interruptions rather than replies. At times he\nseemed to be claiming pity from her; at times he was threatening her\nwith her check and exposure; at times he was boasting of his inflexible\nwill, and how, in the end, he always got what he wanted. He said that\nhis life was boring and stupid without her. Something or other--she\ndid not catch what--he was damned if he could stand. He was evidently\nnervous, and very anxious to be impressive; his projecting eyes sought\nto dominate. The crowning aspect of the incident, for her mind, was the\ndiscovery that he and her indiscretion with him no longer mattered very\nmuch. Its importance had vanished with her abandonment of compromise.\nEven her debt to him was a triviality now.\n\nAnd of course! She had a brilliant idea. It surprised her she hadn't\nthought of it before! She tried to explain that she was going to pay\nhim forty pounds without fail next week. She said as much to him. She\nrepeated this breathlessly.\n\n\"I was glad you did not send it back again,\" he said.\n\nHe touched a long-standing sore, and Ann Veronica found herself vainly\ntrying to explain--the inexplicable. \"It's because I mean to send it\nback altogether,\" she said.\n\nHe ignored her protests in order to pursue some impressive line of his\nown.\n\n\"Here we are, living in the same suburb,\" he began. \"We have to\nbe--modern.\"\n\nHer heart leaped within her as she caught that phrase. That knot also\nwould be cut. Modern, indeed! She was going to be as primordial as\nchipped flint.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nIn the late afternoon, as Ann Veronica was gathering flowers for the\ndinner-table, her father came strolling across the lawn toward her with\nan affectation of great deliberation.\n\n\"I want to speak to you about a little thing, Vee,\" said Mr. Stanley.\n\nAnn Veronica's tense nerves started, and she stood still with her eyes\nupon him, wondering what it might be that impended.\n\n\"You were talking to that fellow Ramage to-day--in the Avenue. Walking\nto the station with him.\"\n\nSo that was it!\n\n\"He came and talked to me.\"\n\n\"Ye--e--es.\" Mr. Stanley considered. \"Well, I don't want you to talk to\nhim,\" he said, very firmly.\n\nAnn Veronica paused before she answered. \"Don't you think I ought to?\"\nshe asked, very submissively.\n\n\"No.\" Mr. Stanley coughed and faced toward the house. \"He is not--I\ndon't like him. I think it inadvisable--I don't want an intimacy to\nspring up between you and a man of that type.\"\n\nAnn Veronica reflected. \"I HAVE--had one or two talks with him, daddy.\"\n\n\"Don't let there be any more. I--In fact, I dislike him extremely.\"\n\n\"Suppose he comes and talks to me?\"\n\n\"A girl can always keep a man at a distance if she cares to do it.\nShe--She can snub him.\"\n\nAnn Veronica picked a cornflower.\n\n\"I wouldn't make this objection,\" Mr. Stanley went on, \"but there are\nthings--there are stories about Ramage. He's--He lives in a world of\npossibilities outside your imagination. His treatment of his wife\nis most unsatisfactory. Most unsatisfactory. A bad man, in fact. A\ndissipated, loose-living man.\"\n\n\"I'll try not to see him again,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I didn't know you\nobjected to him, daddy.\"\n\n\"Strongly,\" said Mr. Stanley, \"very strongly.\"\n\nThe conversation hung. Ann Veronica wondered what her father would do if\nshe were to tell him the full story of her relations with Ramage.\n\n\"A man like that taints a girl by looking at her, by his mere\nconversation.\" He adjusted his glasses on his nose. There was another\nlittle thing he had to say. \"One has to be so careful of one's friends\nand acquaintances,\" he remarked, by way of transition. \"They mould one\ninsensibly.\" His voice assumed an easy detached tone. \"I suppose, Vee,\nyou don't see much of those Widgetts now?\"\n\n\"I go in and talk to Constance sometimes.\"\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\n\"We were great friends at school.\"\n\n\"No doubt.... Still--I don't know whether I quite like--Something\nramshackle about those people, Vee. While I am talking about your\nfriends, I feel--I think you ought to know how I look at it.\" His voice\nconveyed studied moderation. \"I don't mind, of course, your seeing\nher sometimes, still there are differences--differences in social\natmospheres. One gets drawn into things. Before you know where you\nare you find yourself in a complication. I don't want to influence you\nunduly--But--They're artistic people, Vee. That's the fact about them.\nWe're different.\"\n\n\"I suppose we are,\" said Vee, rearranging the flowers in her hand.\n\n\"Friendships that are all very well between school-girls don't always go\non into later life. It's--it's a social difference.\"\n\n\"I like Constance very much.\"\n\n\"No doubt. Still, one has to be reasonable. As you admitted to me--one\nhas to square one's self with the world. You don't know. With people\nof that sort all sorts of things may happen. We don't want things to\nhappen.\"\n\nAnn Veronica made no answer.\n\nA vague desire to justify himself ruffled her father. \"I may seem\nunduly--anxious. I can't forget about your sister. It's that has always\nmade me--SHE, you know, was drawn into a set--didn't discriminate\nPrivate theatricals.\"\n\nAnn Veronica remained anxious to hear more of her sister's story from\nher father's point of view, but he did not go on. Even so much allusion\nas this to that family shadow, she felt, was an immense recognition of\nher ripening years. She glanced at him. He stood a little anxious and\nfussy, bothered by the responsibility of her, entirely careless of what\nher life was or was likely to be, ignoring her thoughts and feelings,\nignorant of every fact of importance in her life, explaining everything\nhe could not understand in her as nonsense and perversity, concerned\nonly with a terror of bothers and undesirable situations. \"We don't want\nthings to happen!\" Never had he shown his daughter so clearly that the\nwomenkind he was persuaded he had to protect and control could please\nhim in one way, and in one way only, and that was by doing nothing\nexcept the punctual domestic duties and being nothing except restful\nappearances. He had quite enough to see to and worry about in the City\nwithout their doing things. He had no use for Ann Veronica; he had\nnever had a use for her since she had been too old to sit upon his knee.\nNothing but the constraint of social usage now linked him to her. And\nthe less \"anything\" happened the better. The less she lived, in fact,\nthe better. These realizations rushed into Ann Veronica's mind and\nhardened her heart against him. She spoke slowly. \"I may not see the\nWidgetts for some little time, father,\" she said. \"I don't think I\nshall.\"\n\n\"Some little tiff?\"\n\n\"No; but I don't think I shall see them.\"\n\nSuppose she were to add, \"I am going away!\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you say it,\" said Mr. Stanley, and was so evidently\npleased that Ann Veronica's heart smote her.\n\n\"I am very glad to hear you say it,\" he repeated, and refrained from\nfurther inquiry. \"I think we are growing sensible,\" he said. \"I think\nyou are getting to understand me better.\"\n\nHe hesitated, and walked away from her toward the house. Her eyes\nfollowed him. The curve of his shoulders, the very angle of his feet,\nexpressed relief at her apparent obedience. \"Thank goodness!\" said\nthat retreating aspect, \"that's said and over. Vee's all right. There's\nnothing happened at all!\" She didn't mean, he concluded, to give him any\nmore trouble ever, and he was free to begin a fresh chromatic novel--he\nhad just finished the Blue Lagoon, which he thought very beautiful and\ntender and absolutely irrelevant to Morningside Park--or work in peace\nat his microtome without bothering about her in the least.\n\nThe immense disillusionment that awaited him! The devastating\ndisillusionment! She had a vague desire to run after him, to state her\ncase to him, to wring some understanding from him of what life was to\nher. She felt a cheat and a sneak to his unsuspecting retreating back.\n\n\"But what can one do?\" asked Ann Veronica.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nShe dressed carefully for dinner in a black dress that her father\nliked, and that made her look serious and responsible. Dinner was quite\nuneventful. Her father read a draft prospectus warily, and her aunt\ndropped fragments of her projects for managing while the cook had a\nholiday. After dinner Ann Veronica went into the drawing-room with Miss\nStanley, and her father went up to his den for his pipe and pensive\npetrography. Later in the evening she heard him whistling, poor man!\n\nShe felt very restless and excited. She refused coffee, though she knew\nthat anyhow she was doomed to a sleepless night. She took up one of her\nfather's novels and put it down again, fretted up to her own room for\nsome work, sat on her bed and meditated upon the room that she was now\nreally abandoning forever, and returned at length with a stocking to\ndarn. Her aunt was making herself cuffs out of little slips of insertion\nunder the newly lit lamp.\n\nAnn Veronica sat down in the other arm-chair and darned badly for a\nminute or so. Then she looked at her aunt, and traced with a curious eye\nthe careful arrangement of her hair, her sharp nose, the little drooping\nlines of mouth and chin and cheek.\n\nHer thought spoke aloud. \"Were you ever in love, aunt?\" she asked.\n\nHer aunt glanced up startled, and then sat very still, with hands that\nhad ceased to work. \"What makes you ask such a question, Vee?\" she said.\n\n\"I wondered.\"\n\nHer aunt answered in a low voice: \"I was engaged to him, dear, for seven\nyears, and then he died.\"\n\nAnn Veronica made a sympathetic little murmur.\n\n\"He was in holy orders, and we were to have been married when he got a\nliving. He was a Wiltshire Edmondshaw, a very old family.\"\n\nShe sat very still.\n\nAnn Veronica hesitated with a question that had leaped up in her mind,\nand that she felt was cruel. \"Are you sorry you waited, aunt?\" she said.\n\nHer aunt was a long time before she answered. \"His stipend forbade it,\"\nshe said, and seemed to fall into a train of thought. \"It would have\nbeen rash and unwise,\" she said at the end of a meditation. \"What he had\nwas altogether insufficient.\"\n\nAnn Veronica looked at the mildly pensive gray eyes and the comfortable,\nrather refined face with a penetrating curiosity. Presently her aunt\nsighed deeply and looked at the clock. \"Time for my Patience,\" she said.\nShe got up, put the neat cuffs she had made into her work-basket,\nand went to the bureau for the little cards in the morocco case. Ann\nVeronica jumped up to get her the card-table. \"I haven't seen the new\nPatience, dear,\" she said. \"May I sit beside you?\"\n\n\"It's a very difficult one,\" said her aunt. \"Perhaps you will help me\nshuffle?\"\n\nAnn Veronica did, and also assisted nimbly with the arrangements of the\nrows of eight with which the struggle began. Then she sat watching the\nplay, sometimes offering a helpful suggestion, sometimes letting her\nattention wander to the smoothly shining arms she had folded across her\nknees just below the edge of the table. She was feeling extraordinarily\nwell that night, so that the sense of her body was a deep delight, a\nrealization of a gentle warmth and strength and elastic firmness. Then\nshe glanced at the cards again, over which her aunt's many-ringed hand\nplayed, and then at the rather weak, rather plump face that surveyed its\noperations.\n\nIt came to Ann Veronica that life was wonderful beyond measure. It\nseemed incredible that she and her aunt were, indeed, creatures of the\nsame blood, only by a birth or so different beings, and part of that\nsame broad interlacing stream of human life that has invented the fauns\nand nymphs, Astarte, Aphrodite, Freya, and all the twining beauty of\nthe gods. The love-songs of all the ages were singing in her blood, the\nscent of night stock from the garden filled the air, and the moths that\nbeat upon the closed frames of the window next the lamp set her mind\ndreaming of kisses in the dusk. Yet her aunt, with a ringed hand\nflitting to her lips and a puzzled, worried look in her eyes, deaf\nto all this riot of warmth and flitting desire, was playing\nPatience--playing Patience, as if Dionysius and her curate had died\ntogether. A faint buzz above the ceiling witnessed that petrography,\ntoo, was active. Gray and tranquil world! Amazing, passionless world! A\nworld in which days without meaning, days in which \"we don't want things\nto happen\" followed days without meaning--until the last thing happened,\nthe ultimate, unavoidable, coarse, \"disagreeable.\" It was her last\nevening in that wrappered life against which she had rebelled. Warm\nreality was now so near her she could hear it beating in her ears. Away\nin London even now Capes was packing and preparing; Capes, the magic man\nwhose touch turned one to trembling fire. What was he doing? What was he\nthinking? It was less than a day now, less than twenty hours. Seventeen\nhours, sixteen hours. She glanced at the soft-ticking clock with the\nexposed brass pendulum upon the white marble mantel, and made a rapid\ncalculation. To be exact, it was just sixteen hours and twenty minutes.\nThe slow stars circled on to the moment of their meeting. The softly\nglittering summer stars! She saw them shining over mountains of snow,\nover valleys of haze and warm darkness.... There would be no moon.\n\n\"I believe after all it's coming out!\" said Miss Stanley. \"The aces made\nit easy.\"\n\nAnn Veronica started from her reverie, sat up in her chair, became\nattentive. \"Look, dear,\" she said presently, \"you can put the ten on the\nJack.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH\n\nIN THE MOUNTAINS\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nNext day Ann Veronica and Capes felt like newborn things. It seemed\nto them they could never have been really alive before, but only\ndimly anticipating existence. They sat face to face beneath an\nexperienced-looking rucksack and a brand new portmanteau and a leather\nhandbag, in the afternoon-boat train that goes from Charing Cross to\nFolkestone for Boulogne. They tried to read illustrated papers in an\nunconcerned manner and with forced attention, lest they should catch\nthe leaping exultation in each other's eyes. And they admired Kent\nsedulously from the windows.\n\nThey crossed the Channel in sunshine and a breeze that just ruffled the\nsea to glittering scales of silver. Some of the people who watched them\nstanding side by side thought they must be newly wedded because of their\nhappy faces, and others that they were an old-established couple because\nof their easy confidence in each other.\n\nAt Boulogne they took train to Basle; next morning they breakfasted\ntogether in the buffet of that station, and thence they caught the\nInterlaken express, and so went by way of Spies to Frutigen. There was\nno railway beyond Frutigen in those days; they sent their baggage by\npost to Kandersteg, and walked along the mule path to the left of the\nstream to that queer hollow among the precipices, Blau See, where the\npetrifying branches of trees lie in the blue deeps of an icy lake, and\npine-trees clamber among gigantic boulders. A little inn flying a\nSwiss flag nestles under a great rock, and there they put aside their\nknapsacks and lunched and rested in the mid-day shadow of the gorge\nand the scent of resin. And later they paddled in a boat above the\nmysterious deeps of the See, and peered down into the green-blues and\nthe blue-greens together. By that time it seemed to them they had lived\ntogether twenty years.\n\nExcept for one memorable school excursion to Paris, Ann Veronica had\nnever yet been outside England. So that it seemed to her the whole world\nhad changed--the very light of it had changed. Instead of English villas\nand cottages there were chalets and Italian-built houses shining white;\nthere were lakes of emerald and sapphire and clustering castles, and\nsuch sweeps of hill and mountain, such shining uplands of snow, as she\nhad never seen before. Everything was fresh and bright, from the kindly\nmanners of the Frutigen cobbler, who hammered mountain nails into her\nboots, to the unfamiliar wild flowers that spangled the wayside. And\nCapes had changed into the easiest and jolliest companion in the world.\nThe mere fact that he was there in the train alongside her, helping her,\nsitting opposite to her in the dining-car, presently sleeping on a seat\nwithin a yard of her, made her heart sing until she was afraid their\nfellow passengers would hear it. It was too good to be true. She would\nnot sleep for fear of losing a moment of that sense of his proximity. To\nwalk beside him, dressed akin to him, rucksacked and companionable, was\nbliss in itself; each step she took was like stepping once more across\nthe threshold of heaven.\n\nOne trouble, however, shot its slanting bolts athwart the shining warmth\nof that opening day and marred its perfection, and that was the thought\nof her father.\n\nShe had treated him badly; she had hurt him and her aunt; she had done\nwrong by their standards, and she would never persuade them that she\nhad done right. She thought of her father in the garden, and of her aunt\nwith her Patience, as she had seen them--how many ages was it ago? Just\none day intervened. She felt as if she had struck them unawares. The\nthought of them distressed her without subtracting at all from the\noceans of happiness in which she swam. But she wished she could put the\nthing she had done in some way to them so that it would not hurt them\nso much as the truth would certainly do. The thought of their faces,\nand particularly of her aunt's, as it would meet the fact--disconcerted,\nunfriendly, condemning, pained--occurred to her again and again.\n\n\"Oh! I wish,\" she said, \"that people thought alike about these things.\"\n\nCapes watched the limpid water dripping from his oar. \"I wish they did,\"\nhe said, \"but they don't.\"\n\n\"I feel--All this is the rightest of all conceivable things. I want to\ntell every one. I want to boast myself.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I told them a lie. I told them lies. I wrote three letters yesterday\nand tore them up. It was so hopeless to put it to them. At last--I told\na story.\"\n\n\"You didn't tell them our position?\"\n\n\"I implied we had married.\"\n\n\"They'll find out. They'll know.\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Possibly--bit by bit.... But it was hopelessly hard to put. I said\nI knew he disliked and distrusted you and your work--that you shared\nall Russell's opinions: he hates Russell beyond measure--and that we\ncouldn't possibly face a conventional marriage. What else could one say?\nI left him to suppose--a registry perhaps....\"\n\nCapes let his oar smack on the water.\n\n\"Do you mind very much?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"But it makes me feel inhuman,\" he added.\n\n\"And me....\"\n\n\"It's the perpetual trouble,\" he said, \"of parent and child. They\ncan't help seeing things in the way they do. Nor can we. WE don't\nthink they're right, but they don't think we are. A deadlock. In a very\ndefinite sense we are in the wrong--hopelessly in the wrong. But--It's\njust this: who was to be hurt?\"\n\n\"I wish no one had to be hurt,\" said Ann Veronica. \"When one is happy--I\ndon't like to think of them. Last time I left home I felt as hard as\nnails. But this is all different. It is different.\"\n\n\"There's a sort of instinct of rebellion,\" said Capes. \"It isn't\nanything to do with our times particularly. People think it is, but they\nare wrong. It's to do with adolescence. Long before religion and Society\nheard of Doubt, girls were all for midnight coaches and Gretna Green.\nIt's a sort of home-leaving instinct.\"\n\nHe followed up a line of thought.\n\n\"There's another instinct, too,\" he went on, \"in a state of suppression,\nunless I'm very much mistaken; a child-expelling instinct.... I\nwonder.... There's no family uniting instinct, anyhow; it's habit\nand sentiment and material convenience hold families together after\nadolescence. There's always friction, conflict, unwilling concessions.\nAlways! I don't believe there is any strong natural affection at all\nbetween parents and growing-up children. There wasn't, I know, between\nmyself and my father. I didn't allow myself to see things as they were\nin those days; now I do. I bored him. I hated him. I suppose that\nshocks one's ideas.... It's true.... There are sentimental and\ntraditional deferences and reverences, I know, between father and\nson; but that's just exactly what prevents the development of an easy\nfriendship. Father-worshipping sons are abnormal--and they're no good.\nNo good at all. One's got to be a better man than one's father, or what\nis the good of successive generations? Life is rebellion, or nothing.\"\n\nHe rowed a stroke and watched the swirl of water from his oar broaden\nand die away. At last he took up his thoughts again: \"I wonder if, some\nday, one won't need to rebel against customs and laws? If this discord\nwill have gone? Some day, perhaps--who knows?--the old won't coddle and\nhamper the young, and the young won't need to fly in the faces of the\nold. They'll face facts as facts, and understand. Oh, to face facts!\nGods! what a world it might be if people faced facts! Understanding!\nUnderstanding! There is no other salvation. Some day older people,\nperhaps, will trouble to understand younger people, and there won't\nbe these fierce disruptions; there won't be barriers one must defy or\nperish.... That's really our choice now, defy--or futility.... The\nworld, perhaps, will be educated out of its idea of fixed standards....\nI wonder, Ann Veronica, if, when our time comes, we shall be any\nwiser?\"\n\nAnn Veronica watched a water-beetle fussing across the green depths.\n\"One can't tell. I'm a female thing at bottom. I like high tone for a\nflourish and stars and ideas; but I want my things.\"\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nCapes thought.\n\n\"It's odd--I have no doubt in my mind that what we are doing is wrong,\"\nhe said. \"And yet I do it without compunction.\"\n\n\"I never felt so absolutely right,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"You ARE a female thing at bottom,\" he admitted. \"I'm not nearly so sure\nas you. As for me, I look twice at it.... Life is two things,\nthat's how I see it; two things mixed and muddled up together. Life is\nmorality--life is adventure. Squire and master. Adventure rules, and\nmorality--looks up the trains in the Bradshaw. Morality tells you what\nis right, and adventure moves you. If morality means anything it means\nkeeping bounds, respecting implications, respecting implicit bounds. If\nindividuality means anything it means breaking bounds--adventure.\n\n\"Will you be moral and your species, or immoral and yourself? We've\ndecided to be immoral. We needn't try and give ourselves airs. We've\ndeserted the posts in which we found ourselves, cut our duties, exposed\nourselves to risks that may destroy any sort of social usefulness in\nus.... I don't know. One keeps rules in order to be one's self. One\nstudies Nature in order not to be blindly ruled by her. There's no sense\nin morality, I suppose, unless you are fundamentally immoral.\"\n\nShe watched his face as he traced his way through these speculative\nthickets.\n\n\"Look at our affair,\" he went on, looking up at her. \"No power on earth\nwill persuade me we're not two rather disreputable persons. You desert\nyour home; I throw up useful teaching, risk every hope in your career.\nHere we are absconding, pretending to be what we are not; shady, to say\nthe least of it. It's not a bit of good pretending there's any Higher\nTruth or wonderful principle in this business. There isn't. We never\nstarted out in any high-browed manner to scandalize and Shelleyfy.\nWhen first you left your home you had no idea that _I_ was the hidden\nimpulse. I wasn't. You came out like an ant for your nuptial flight. It\nwas just a chance that we in particular hit against each other--nothing\npredestined about it. We just hit against each other, and here we are\nflying off at a tangent, a little surprised at what we are doing, all\nour principles abandoned, and tremendously and quite unreasonably proud\nof ourselves. Out of all this we have struck a sort of harmony....\nAnd it's gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Glorious!\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Would YOU like us--if some one told you the bare outline of our\nstory?--and what we are doing?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"But if some one else asked your advice? If some one else said, 'Here is\nmy teacher, a jaded married man on the verge of middle age, and he and I\nhave a violent passion for one another. We propose to disregard all our\nties, all our obligations, all the established prohibitions of society,\nand begin life together afresh.' What would you tell her?\"\n\n\"If she asked advice, I should say she wasn't fit to do anything of the\nsort. I should say that having a doubt was enough to condemn it.\"\n\n\"But waive that point.\"\n\n\"It would be different all the same. It wouldn't be you.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be you either. I suppose that's the gist of the whole\nthing.\" He stared at a little eddy. \"The rule's all right, so long as\nthere isn't a case. Rules are for established things, like the pieces\nand positions of a game. Men and women are not established things;\nthey're experiments, all of them. Every human being is a new thing,\nexists to do new things. Find the thing you want to do most intensely,\nmake sure that's it, and do it with all your might. If you live, well\nand good; if you die, well and good. Your purpose is done.... Well,\nthis is OUR thing.\"\n\nHe woke the glassy water to swirling activity again, and made the\ndeep-blue shapes below writhe and shiver.\n\n\"This is MY thing,\" said Ann Veronica, softly, with thoughtful eyes upon\nhim.\n\nThen she looked up the sweep of pine-trees to the towering sunlit cliffs\nand the high heaven above and then back to his face. She drew in a deep\nbreath of the sweet mountain air. Her eyes were soft and grave, and\nthere was the faintest of smiles upon her resolute lips.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nLater they loitered along a winding path above the inn, and made love\nto one another. Their journey had made them indolent, the afternoon was\nwarm, and it seemed impossible to breathe a sweeter air. The flowers and\nturf, a wild strawberry, a rare butterfly, and suchlike little intimate\nthings had become more interesting than mountains. Their flitting hands\nwere always touching. Deep silences came between them....\n\n\"I had thought to go on to Kandersteg,\" said Capes, \"but this is a\npleasant place. There is not a soul in the inn but ourselves. Let\nus stay the night here. Then we can loiter and gossip to our heart's\ncontent.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"After all, it's our honeymoon.\"\n\n\"All we shall get,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"This place is very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Any place would be beautiful,\" said Ann Veronica, in a low voice.\n\nFor a time they walked in silence.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she began, presently, \"why I love you--and love you so\nmuch?... I know now what it is to be an abandoned female. I AM an\nabandoned female. I'm not ashamed--of the things I'm doing. I want to\nput myself into your hands. You know--I wish I could roll my little body\nup small and squeeze it into your hand and grip your fingers upon it.\nTight. I want you to hold me and have me SO.... Everything. Everything.\nIt's a pure joy of giving--giving to YOU. I have never spoken of these\nthings to any human being. Just dreamed--and ran away even from my\ndreams. It is as if my lips had been sealed about them. And now I break\nthe seals--for you. Only I wish--I wish to-day I was a thousand times,\nten thousand times more beautiful.\"\n\nCapes lifted her hand and kissed it.\n\n\"You are a thousand times more beautiful,\" he said, \"than anything else\ncould be.... You are you. You are all the beauty in the world. Beauty\ndoesn't mean, never has meant, anything--anything at all but you. It\nheralded you, promised you....\"\n\n\n\nPart 4\n\n\nThey lay side by side in a shallow nest of turf and mosses among\nbowlders and stunted bushes on a high rock, and watched the day sky\ndeepen to evening between the vast precipices overhead and looked over\nthe tree-tops down the widening gorge. A distant suggestion of chalets\nand a glimpse of the road set them talking for a time of the world they\nhad left behind.\n\nCapes spoke casually of their plans for work. \"It's a flabby,\nloose-willed world we have to face. It won't even know whether to be\nscandalized at us or forgiving. It will hold aloof, a little undecided\nwhether to pelt or not--\"\n\n\"That depends whether we carry ourselves as though we expected pelting,\"\nsaid Ann Veronica.\n\n\"We won't.\"\n\n\"No fear!\"\n\n\"Then, as we succeed, it will begin to sidle back to us. It will do its\nbest to overlook things--\"\n\n\"If we let it, poor dear.\"\n\n\"That's if we succeed. If we fail,\" said Capes, \"then--\"\n\n\"We aren't going to fail,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nLife seemed a very brave and glorious enterprise to Ann Veronica that\nday. She was quivering with the sense of Capes at her side and glowing\nwith heroic love; it seemed to her that if they put their hands jointly\nagainst the Alps and pushed they would be able to push them aside. She\nlay and nibbled at a sprig of dwarf rhododendron.\n\n\"FAIL!\" she said.\n\n\n\nPart 5\n\n\nPresently it occurred to Ann Veronica to ask about the journey he had\nplanned. He had his sections of the Siegfried map folded in his pocket,\nand he squatted up with his legs crossed like an Indian idol while\nshe lay prone beside him and followed every movement of his indicatory\nfinger.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, \"is this Blau See, and here we rest until to-morrow. I\nthink we rest here until to-morrow?\"\n\nThere was a brief silence.\n\n\"It is a very pleasant place,\" said Ann Veronica, biting a rhododendron\nstalk through, and with that faint shadow of a smile returning to her\nlips....\n\n\"And then?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Then we go on to this place, the Oeschinensee. It's a lake among\nprecipices, and there is a little inn where we can stay, and sit and eat\nour dinner at a pleasant table that looks upon the lake. For some days\nwe shall be very idle there among the trees and rocks. There are boats\non the lake and shady depths and wildernesses of pine-wood. After a day\nor so, perhaps, we will go on one or two little excursions and see how\ngood your head is--a mild scramble or so; and then up to a hut on a pass\njust here, and out upon the Blumlis-alp glacier that spreads out so and\nso.\"\n\nShe roused herself from some dream at the word. \"Glaciers?\" she said.\n\n\"Under the Wilde Frau--which was named after you.\"\n\nHe bent and kissed her hair and paused, and then forced his attention\nback to the map. \"One day,\" he resumed, \"we will start off early and\ncome down into Kandersteg and up these zigzags and here and here, and so\npast this Daubensee to a tiny inn--it won't be busy yet, though; we\nmay get it all to ourselves--on the brim of the steepest zigzag you can\nimagine, thousands of feet of zigzag; and you will sit and eat lunch\nwith me and look out across the Rhone Valley and over blue distances\nbeyond blue distances to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and a long\nregiment of sunny, snowy mountains. And when we see them we shall at\nonce want to go to them--that's the way with beautiful things--and\ndown we shall go, like flies down a wall, to Leukerbad, and so to Leuk\nStation, here, and then by train up the Rhone Valley and this little\nside valley to Stalden; and there, in the cool of the afternoon, we\nshall start off up a gorge, torrents and cliffs below us and above us,\nto sleep in a half-way inn, and go on next day to Saas Fee, Saas of\nthe Magic, Saas of the Pagan People. And there, about Saas, are ice\nand snows again, and sometimes we will loiter among the rocks and trees\nabout Saas or peep into Samuel Butler's chapels, and sometimes we will\nclimb up out of the way of the other people on to the glaciers and snow.\nAnd, for one expedition at least, we will go up this desolate valley\nhere to Mattmark, and so on to Monte Moro. There indeed you see Monte\nRosa. Almost the best of all.\"\n\n\"Is it very beautiful?\"\n\n\"When I saw it there it was very beautiful. It was wonderful. It was the\ncrowned queen of mountains in her robes of shining white. It towered up\nhigh above the level of the pass, thousands of feet, still, shining, and\nwhite, and below, thousands of feet below, was a floor of little woolly\nclouds. And then presently these clouds began to wear thin and expose\nsteep, deep slopes, going down and down, with grass and pine-trees, down\nand down, and at last, through a great rent in the clouds, bare roofs,\nshining like very minute pin-heads, and a road like a fibre of white\nsilk-Macugnana, in Italy. That will be a fine day--it will have to be,\nwhen first you set eyes on Italy.... That's as far as we go.\"\n\n\"Can't we go down into Italy?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said; \"it won't run to that now. We must wave our hands at the\nblue hills far away there and go back to London and work.\"\n\n\"But Italy--\"\n\n\"Italy's for a good girl,\" he said, and laid his hand for a moment on\nher shoulder. \"She must look forward to Italy.\"\n\n\"I say,\" she reflected, \"you ARE rather the master, you know.\"\n\nThe idea struck him as novel. \"Of course I'm manager for this\nexpedition,\" he said, after an interval of self-examination.\n\nShe slid her cheek down the tweed sleeve of his coat. \"Nice sleeve,\" she\nsaid, and came to his hand and kissed it.\n\n\"I say!\" he cried. \"Look here! Aren't you going a little too far?\nThis--this is degradation--making a fuss with sleeves. You mustn't do\nthings like that.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Free woman--and equal.\"\n\n\"I do it--of my own free will,\" said Ann Veronica, kissing his hand\nagain. \"It's nothing to what I WILL do.\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\" he said, a little doubtfully, \"it's just a phase,\" and bent\ndown and rested his hand on her shoulder for a moment, with his heart\nbeating and his nerves a-quiver. Then as she lay very still, with her\nhands clinched and her black hair tumbled about her face, he came still\ncloser and softly kissed the nape of her neck....\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\n\nMost of the things that he had planned they did. But they climbed more\nthan he had intended because Ann Veronica proved rather a good climber,\nsteady-headed and plucky, rather daring, but quite willing to be\ncautious at his command.\n\nOne of the things that most surprised him in her was her capacity for\nblind obedience. She loved to be told to do things.\n\nHe knew the circle of mountains about Saas Fee fairly well: he had been\nthere twice before, and it was fine to get away from the straggling\npedestrians into the high, lonely places, and sit and munch sandwiches\nand talk together and do things together that were just a little\ndifficult and dangerous. And they could talk, they found; and never\nonce, it seemed, did their meaning and intention hitch. They were\nenormously pleased with one another; they found each other beyond\nmeasure better than they had expected, if only because of the want of\nsubstance in mere expectation. Their conversation degenerated again\nand again into a strain of self-congratulation that would have irked an\neavesdropper.\n\n\"You're--I don't know,\" said Ann Veronica. \"You're splendid.\"\n\n\"It isn't that you're splendid or I,\" said Capes. \"But we satisfy one\nanother. Heaven alone knows why. So completely! The oddest fitness!\nWhat is it made of? Texture of skin and texture of mind? Complexion and\nvoice. I don't think I've got illusions, nor you.... If I had never\nmet anything of you at all but a scrap of your skin binding a book, Ann\nVeronica, I know I would have kept that somewhere near to me.... All\nyour faults are just jolly modelling to make you real and solid.\"\n\n\"The faults are the best part of it,\" said Ann Veronica; \"why, even our\nlittle vicious strains run the same way. Even our coarseness.\"\n\n\"Coarse?\" said Capes, \"We're not coarse.\"\n\n\"But if we were?\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I can talk to you and you to me without a scrap of effort,\" said\nCapes; \"that's the essence of it. It's made up of things as small as the\ndiameter of hairs and big as life and death.... One always dreamed\nof this and never believed it. It's the rarest luck, the wildest, most\nimpossible accident. Most people, every one I know else, seem to have\nmated with foreigners and to talk uneasily in unfamiliar tongues, to be\nafraid of the knowledge the other one has, of the other one's perpetual\nmisjudgment and misunderstandings.\n\n\"Why don't they wait?\" he added.\n\nAnn Veronica had one of her flashes of insight.\n\n\"One doesn't wait,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\nShe expanded that. \"_I_ shouldn't have waited,\" she said. \"I might have\nmuddled for a time. But it's as you say. I've had the rarest luck and\nfallen on my feet.\"\n\n\"We've both fallen on our feet! We're the rarest of mortals! The real\nthing! There's not a compromise nor a sham nor a concession between\nus. We aren't afraid; we don't bother. We don't consider each other;\nwe needn't. That wrappered life, as you call it--we've burned the\nconfounded rags! Danced out of it! We're stark!\"\n\n\"Stark!\" echoed Ann Veronica.\n\n\n\nPart 7\n\n\nAs they came back from that day's climb--it was up the Mittaghorn--they\nhad to cross a shining space of wet, steep rocks between two grass\nslopes that needed a little care. There were a few loose, broken\nfragments of rock to reckon with upon the ledges, and one place where\nhands did as much work as toes. They used the rope--not that a rope was\nat all necessary, but because Ann Veronica's exalted state of mind made\nthe fact of the rope agreeably symbolical; and, anyhow, it did insure a\njoint death in the event of some remotely possibly mischance. Capes went\nfirst, finding footholds and, where the drops in the strata-edges came\nlike long, awkward steps, placing Ann Veronica's feet. About half-way\nacross this interval, when everything seemed going well, Capes had a\nshock.\n\n\"Heavens!\" exclaimed Ann Veronica, with extraordinary passion. \"My God!\"\nand ceased to move.\n\nCapes became rigid and adhesive. Nothing ensued. \"All right?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'll have to pay it.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I've forgotten something. Oh, cuss it!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"He said I would.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That's the devil of it!\"\n\n\"Devil of what?... You DO use vile language!\"\n\n\"Forget about it like this.\"\n\n\"Forget WHAT?\"\n\n\"And I said I wouldn't. I said I'd do anything. I said I'd make shirts.\"\n\n\"Shirts?\"\n\n\"Shirts at one--and--something a dozen. Oh, goodness! Bilking! Ann\nVeronica, you're a bilker!\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"Will you tell me what all this is about?\" said Capes.\n\n\"It's about forty pounds.\"\n\nCapes waited patiently.\n\n\"G. I'm sorry.... But you've got to lend me forty pounds.\"\n\n\"It's some sort of delirium,\" said Capes. \"The rarefied air? I thought\nyou had a better head.\"\n\n\"No! I'll explain lower. It's all right. Let's go on climbing now. It's\na thing I've unaccountably overlooked. All right really. It can wait\na bit longer. I borrowed forty pounds from Mr. Ramage. Thank goodness\nyou'll understand. That's why I chucked Manning.... All right, I'm\ncoming. But all this business has driven it clean out of my head....\nThat's why he was so annoyed, you know.\"\n\n\"Who was annoyed?\"\n\n\"Mr. Ramage--about the forty pounds.\" She took a step. \"My dear,\" she\nadded, by way of afterthought, \"you DO obliterate things!\"\n\n\n\nPart 8\n\n\nThey found themselves next day talking love to one another high up on\nsome rocks above a steep bank of snow that overhung a precipice on the\neastern side of the Fee glacier. By this time Capes' hair had bleached\nnearly white, and his skin had become a skin of red copper shot with\ngold. They were now both in a state of unprecedented physical fitness.\nAnd such skirts as Ann Veronica had had when she entered the valley of\nSaas were safely packed away in the hotel, and she wore a leather belt\nand loose knickerbockers and puttees--a costume that suited the fine,\nlong lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walking-dress could\ndo. Her complexion had resisted the snow-glare wonderfully; her skin had\nonly deepened its natural warmth a little under the Alpine sun. She had\npushed aside her azure veil, taken off her snow-glasses, and sat smiling\nunder her hand at the shining glories--the lit cornices, the blue\nshadows, the softly rounded, enormous snow masses, the deep places\nfull of quivering luminosity--of the Taschhorn and Dom. The sky was\ncloudless, effulgent blue.\n\nCapes sat watching and admiring her, and then he fell praising the day\nand fortune and their love for each other.\n\n\"Here we are,\" he said, \"shining through each other like light through a\nstained-glass window. With this air in our blood, this sunlight soaking\nus.... Life is so good. Can it ever be so good again?\"\n\nAnn Veronica put out a firm hand and squeezed his arm. \"It's very good,\"\nshe said. \"It's glorious good!\"\n\n\"Suppose now--look at this long snow-slope and then that blue deep\nbeyond--do you see that round pool of color in the ice--a thousand feet\nor more below? Yes? Well, think--we've got to go but ten steps and lie\ndown and put our arms about each other. See? Down we should rush in a\nfoam--in a cloud of snow--to flight and a dream. All the rest of\nour lives would be together then, Ann Veronica. Every moment. And no\nill-chances.\"\n\n\"If you tempt me too much,\" she said, after a silence, \"I shall do\nit. I need only just jump up and throw myself upon you. I'm a desperate\nyoung woman. And then as we went down you'd try to explain. And that\nwould spoil it.... You know you don't mean it.\"\n\n\"No, I don't. But I liked to say it.\"\n\n\"Rather! But I wonder why you don't mean it?\"\n\n\"Because, I suppose, the other thing is better. What other reason could\nthere be? It's more complex, but it's better. THIS, this glissade, would\nbe damned scoundrelism. You know that, and I know that, though we might\nbe put to it to find a reason why. It would be swindling. Drawing the\npay of life and then not living. And besides--We're going to live, Ann\nVeronica! Oh, the things we'll do, the life we'll lead! There'll be\ntrouble in it at times--you and I aren't going to run without friction.\nBut we've got the brains to get over that, and tongues in our heads to\ntalk to each other. We sha'n't hang up on any misunderstanding. Not us.\nAnd we're going to fight that old world down there. That old world that\nhad shoved up that silly old hotel, and all the rest of it.... If we\ndon't live it will think we are afraid of it.... Die, indeed! We're\ngoing to do work; we're going to unfold about each other; we're going to\nhave children.\"\n\n\"Girls!\" cried Ann Veronica.\n\n\"Boys!\" said Capes.\n\n\"Both!\" said Ann Veronica. \"Lots of 'em!\"\n\nCapes chuckled. \"You delicate female!\"\n\n\"Who cares,\" said Ann Veronica, \"seeing it's you? Warm, soft little\nwonders! Of course I want them.\"\n\n\n\nPart 9\n\n\n\"All sorts of things we're going to do,\" said Capes; \"all sorts of times\nwe're going to have. Sooner or later we'll certainly do something to\nclean those prisons you told me about--limewash the underside of life.\nYou and I. We can love on a snow cornice, we can love over a pail of\nwhitewash. Love anywhere. Anywhere! Moonlight and music--pleasing, you\nknow, but quite unnecessary. We met dissecting dogfish.... Do you\nremember your first day with me?... Do you indeed remember? The smell\nof decay and cheap methylated spirit!... My dear! we've had so many\nmoments! I used to go over the times we'd had together, the things we'd\nsaid--like a rosary of beads. But now it's beads by the cask--like the\nhold of a West African trader. It feels like too much gold-dust clutched\nin one's hand. One doesn't want to lose a grain. And one must--some of\nit must slip through one's fingers.\"\n\n\"I don't care if it does,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I don't care a rap for\nremembering. I care for you. This moment couldn't be better until the\nnext moment comes. That's how it takes me. Why should WE hoard? We\naren't going out presently, like Japanese lanterns in a gale. It's the\npoor dears who do, who know they will, know they can't keep it up, who\nneed to clutch at way-side flowers. And put 'em in little books for\nremembrance. Flattened flowers aren't for the likes of us. Moments,\nindeed! We like each other fresh and fresh. It isn't illusions--for us.\nWe two just love each other--the real, identical other--all the time.\"\n\n\"The real, identical other,\" said Capes, and took and bit the tip of her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"There's no delusions, so far as I know,\" said Ann Veronica.\n\n\"I don't believe there is one. If there is, it's a mere\nwrapping--there's better underneath. It's only as if I'd begun to know\nyou the day before yesterday or there-abouts. You keep on coming truer,\nafter you have seemed to come altogether true. You... brick!\"\n\n\n\nPart 10\n\n\n\"To think,\" he cried, \"you are ten years younger than I!... There are\ntimes when you make me feel a little thing at your feet--a young, silly,\nprotected thing. Do you know, Ann Veronica, it is all a lie about your\nbirth certificate; a forgery--and fooling at that. You are one of the\nImmortals. Immortal! You were in the beginning, and all the men in the\nworld who have known what love is have worshipped at your feet. You have\nconverted me to--Lester Ward! You are my dear friend, you are a slip of\na girl, but there are moments when my head has been on your breast, when\nyour heart has been beating close to my ears, when I have known you for\nthe goddess, when I have wished myself your slave, when I have wished\nthat you could kill me for the joy of being killed by you. You are the\nHigh Priestess of Life....\"\n\n\"Your priestess,\" whispered Ann Veronica, softly. \"A silly little\npriestess who knew nothing of life at all until she came to you.\"\n\n\n\nPart 11\n\n\nThey sat for a time without speaking a word, in an enormous shining\nglobe of mutual satisfaction.\n\n\"Well,\" said Capes, at length, \"we've to go down, Ann Veronica. Life\nwaits for us.\"\n\nHe stood up and waited for her to move.\n\n\"Gods!\" cried Ann Veronica, and kept him standing. \"And to think that\nit's not a full year ago since I was a black-hearted rebel school-girl,\ndistressed, puzzled, perplexed, not understanding that this great\nforce of love was bursting its way through me! All those nameless\ndiscontents--they were no more than love's birth-pangs. I felt--I\nfelt living in a masked world. I felt as though I had bandaged eyes. I\nfelt--wrapped in thick cobwebs. They blinded me. They got in my mouth.\nAnd now--Dear! Dear! The dayspring from on high hath visited me. I love.\nI am loved. I want to shout! I want to sing! I am glad! I am glad to be\nalive because you are alive! I am glad to be a woman because you are a\nman! I am glad! I am glad! I am glad! I thank God for life and you. I\nthank God for His sunlight on your face. I thank God for the beauty\nyou love and the faults you love. I thank God for the very skin that is\npeeling from your nose, for all things great and small that make us what\nwe are. This is grace I am saying! Oh! my dear! all the joy and weeping\nof life are mixed in me now and all the gratitude. Never a new-born\ndragon-fly that spread its wings in the morning has felt as glad as I!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH\n\nIN PERSPECTIVE\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\nAbout four years and a quarter later--to be exact, it was four years and\nfour months--Mr. and Mrs. Capes stood side by side upon an old Persian\ncarpet that did duty as a hearthrug in the dining-room of their flat\nand surveyed a shining dinner-table set for four people, lit by\nskilfully-shaded electric lights, brightened by frequent gleams of\nsilver, and carefully and simply adorned with sweet-pea blossom. Capes\nhad altered scarcely at all during the interval, except for a new\nquality of smartness in the cut of his clothes, but Ann Veronica was\nnearly half an inch taller; her face was at once stronger and softer,\nher neck firmer and rounder, and her carriage definitely more womanly\nthan it had been in the days of her rebellion. She was a woman now to\nthe tips of her fingers; she had said good-bye to her girlhood in the\nold garden four years and a quarter ago. She was dressed in a simple\nevening gown of soft creamy silk, with a yoke of dark old embroidery\nthat enhanced the gentle gravity of her style, and her black hair flowed\noff her open forehead to pass under the control of a simple ribbon of\nsilver. A silver necklace enhanced the dusky beauty of her neck. Both\nhusband and wife affected an unnatural ease of manner for the benefit of\nthe efficient parlor-maid, who was putting the finishing touches to the\nsideboard arrangements.\n\n\"It looks all right,\" said Capes.\n\n\"I think everything's right,\" said Ann Veronica, with the roaming eye of\na capable but not devoted house-mistress.\n\n\"I wonder if they will seem altered,\" she remarked for the third time.\n\n\"There I can't help,\" said Capes.\n\nHe walked through a wide open archway, curtained with deep-blue\ncurtains, into the apartment that served as a reception-room. Ann\nVeronica, after a last survey of the dinner appointments, followed him,\nrustling, came to his side by the high brass fender, and touched two or\nthree ornaments on the mantel above the cheerful fireplace.\n\n\"It's still a marvel to me that we are to be forgiven,\" she said,\nturning.\n\n\"My charm of manner, I suppose. But, indeed, he's very human.\"\n\n\"Did you tell him of the registry office?\"\n\n\"No--o--certainly not so emphatically as I did about the play.\"\n\n\"It was an inspiration--your speaking to him?\"\n\n\"I felt impudent. I believe I am getting impudent. I had not been near\nthe Royal Society since--since you disgraced me. What's that?\"\n\nThey both stood listening. It was not the arrival of the guests, but\nmerely the maid moving about in the hall.\n\n\"Wonderful man!\" said Ann Veronica, reassured, and stroking his cheek\nwith her finger.\n\nCapes made a quick movement as if to bite that aggressive digit, but it\nwithdrew to Ann Veronica's side.\n\n\"I was really interested in his stuff. I WAS talking to him before I saw\nhis name on the card beside the row of microscopes. Then, naturally, I\nwent on talking. He--he has rather a poor opinion of his contemporaries.\nOf course, he had no idea who I was.\"\n\n\"But how did you tell him? You've never told me. Wasn't it--a little bit\nof a scene?\"\n\n\"Oh! let me see. I said I hadn't been at the Royal Society soiree for\nfour years, and got him to tell me about some of the fresh Mendelian\nwork. He loves the Mendelians because he hates all the big names of\nthe eighties and nineties. Then I think I remarked that science was\ndisgracefully under-endowed, and confessed I'd had to take to\nmore profitable courses. 'The fact of it is,' I said, 'I'm the new\nplaywright, Thomas More. Perhaps you've heard--?' Well, you know, he\nhad.\"\n\n\"Fame!\"\n\n\"Isn't it? 'I've not seen your play, Mr. More,' he said, 'but I'm told\nit's the most amusing thing in London at the present time. A friend\nof mine, Ogilvy'--I suppose that's Ogilvy & Ogilvy, who do so many\ndivorces, Vee?--'was speaking very highly of it--very highly!'\" He\nsmiled into her eyes.\n\n\"You are developing far too retentive a memory for praises,\" said Ann\nVeronica.\n\n\"I'm still new to them. But after that it was easy. I told him instantly\nand shamelessly that the play was going to be worth ten thousand pounds.\nHe agreed it was disgraceful. Then I assumed a rather portentous manner\nto prepare him.\"\n\n\"How? Show me.\"\n\n\"I can't be portentous, dear, when you're about. It's my other side of\nthe moon. But I was portentous, I can assure you. 'My name's NOT More,\nMr. Stanley,' I said. 'That's my pet name.'\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I think--yes, I went on in a pleasing blend of the casual and sotto\nvoce, 'The fact of it is, sir, I happen to be your son-in-law, Capes. I\ndo wish you could come and dine with us some evening. It would make my\nwife very happy.'\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"What does any one say to an invitation to dinner point-blank? One tries\nto collect one's wits. 'She is constantly thinking of you,' I said.\"\n\n\"And he accepted meekly?\"\n\n\"Practically. What else could he do? You can't kick up a scene on the\nspur of the moment in the face of such conflicting values as he\nhad before him. With me behaving as if everything was infinitely\nmatter-of-fact, what could he do? And just then Heaven sent old\nManningtree--I didn't tell you before of the fortunate intervention of\nManningtree, did I? He was looking quite infernally distinguished, with\na wide crimson ribbon across him--what IS a wide crimson ribbon? Some\nsort of knight, I suppose. He is a knight. 'Well, young man,' he said,\n'we haven't seen you lately,' and something about 'Bateson & Co.'--he's\nfrightfully anti-Mendelian--having it all their own way. So I introduced\nhim to my father-in-law like a shot. I think that WAS decision. Yes, it\nwas Manningtree really secured your father. He--\"\n\n\"Here they are!\" said Ann Veronica as the bell sounded.\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nThey received the guests in their pretty little hall with genuine\neffusion. Miss Stanley threw aside a black cloak to reveal a discreet\nand dignified arrangement of brown silk, and then embraced Ann Veronica\nwith warmth. \"So very clear and cold,\" she said. \"I feared we might\nhave a fog.\" The housemaid's presence acted as a useful restraint. Ann\nVeronica passed from her aunt to her father, and put her arms about him\nand kissed his cheek. \"Dear old daddy!\" she said, and was amazed to\nfind herself shedding tears. She veiled her emotion by taking off his\novercoat. \"And this is Mr. Capes?\" she heard her aunt saying.\n\nAll four people moved a little nervously into the drawing-room,\nmaintaining a sort of fluttered amiability of sound and movement.\n\nMr. Stanley professed a great solicitude to warm his hands. \"Quite\nunusually cold for the time of year,\" he said. \"Everything very nice,\nI am sure,\" Miss Stanley murmured to Capes as he steered her to a place\nupon the little sofa before the fire. Also she made little pussy-like\nsounds of a reassuring nature.\n\n\"And let's have a look at you, Vee!\" said Mr. Stanley, standing up with\na sudden geniality and rubbing his hands together.\n\nAnn Veronica, who knew her dress became her, dropped a curtsy to her\nfather's regard.\n\nHappily they had no one else to wait for, and it heartened her mightily\nto think that she had ordered the promptest possible service of the\ndinner. Capes stood beside Miss Stanley, who was beaming unnaturally,\nand Mr. Stanley, in his effort to seem at ease, took entire possession\nof the hearthrug.\n\n\"You found the flat easily?\" said Capes in the pause. \"The numbers are a\nlittle difficult to see in the archway. They ought to put a lamp.\"\n\nHer father declared there had been no difficulty.\n\n\"Dinner is served, m'm,\" said the efficient parlor-maid in the archway,\nand the worst was over.\n\n\"Come, daddy,\" said Ann Veronica, following her husband and Miss\nStanley; and in the fulness of her heart she gave a friendly squeeze to\nthe parental arm.\n\n\"Excellent fellow!\" he answered a little irrelevantly. \"I didn't\nunderstand, Vee.\"\n\n\"Quite charming apartments,\" Miss Stanley admired; \"charming! Everything\nis so pretty and convenient.\"\n\nThe dinner was admirable as a dinner; nothing went wrong, from the\ngolden and excellent clear soup to the delightful iced marrons\nand cream; and Miss Stanley's praises died away to an appreciative\nacquiescence. A brisk talk sprang up between Capes and Mr. Stanley, to\nwhich the two ladies subordinated themselves intelligently. The\nburning topic of the Mendelian controversy was approached on one or two\noccasions, but avoided dexterously; and they talked chiefly of letters\nand art and the censorship of the English stage. Mr. Stanley was\ninclined to think the censorship should be extended to the supply of\nwhat he styled latter-day fiction; good wholesome stories were being\nousted, he said, by \"vicious, corrupting stuff\" that \"left a bad taste\nin the mouth.\" He declared that no book could be satisfactory that left\na bad taste in the mouth, however much it seized and interested the\nreader at the time. He did not like it, he said, with a significant\nlook, to be reminded of either his books or his dinners after he had\ndone with them. Capes agreed with the utmost cordiality.\n\n\"Life is upsetting enough, without the novels taking a share,\" said Mr.\nStanley.\n\nFor a time Ann Veronica's attention was diverted by her aunt's interest\nin the salted almonds.\n\n\"Quite particularly nice,\" said her aunt. \"Exceptionally so.\"\n\nWhen Ann Veronica could attend again she found the men were discussing\nthe ethics of the depreciation of house property through the increasing\ntumult of traffic in the West End, and agreeing with each other to a\ndevastating extent. It came into her head with real emotional force that\nthis must be some particularly fantastic sort of dream. It seemed to her\nthat her father was in some inexplicable way meaner-looking than she\nhad supposed, and yet also, as unaccountably, appealing. His tie had\ndemanded a struggle; he ought to have taken a clean one after his\nfirst failure. Why was she noting things like this? Capes seemed\nself-possessed and elaborately genial and commonplace, but she knew him\nto be nervous by a little occasional clumsiness, by the faintest shadow\nof vulgarity in the urgency of his hospitality. She wished he could\nsmoke and dull his nerves a little. A gust of irrational impatience blew\nthrough her being. Well, they'd got to the pheasants, and in a little\nwhile he would smoke. What was it she had expected? Surely her moods\nwere getting a little out of hand.\n\nShe wished her father and aunt would not enjoy their dinner with such\nquiet determination. Her father and her husband, who had both been a\nlittle pale at their first encounter, were growing now just faintly\nflushed. It was a pity people had to eat food.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said her father, \"I have read at least half the novels that\nhave been at all successful during the last twenty years. Three a week\nis my allowance, and, if I get short ones, four. I change them in the\nmorning at Cannon Street, and take my book as I come down.\"\n\nIt occurred to her that she had never seen her father dining out\nbefore, never watched him critically as an equal. To Capes he was almost\ndeferential, and she had never seen him deferential in the old time,\nnever. The dinner was stranger than she had ever anticipated. It was\nas if she had grown right past her father into something older and\nof infinitely wider outlook, as if he had always been unsuspectedly a\nflattened figure, and now she had discovered him from the other side.\n\nIt was a great relief to arrive at last at that pause when she could say\nto her aunt, \"Now, dear?\" and rise and hold back the curtain through the\narchway. Capes and her father stood up, and her father made a belated\nmovement toward the curtain. She realized that he was the sort of man\none does not think much about at dinners. And Capes was thinking that\nhis wife was a supremely beautiful woman. He reached a silver cigar and\ncigarette box from the sideboard and put it before his father-in-law,\nand for a time the preliminaries of smoking occupied them both. Then\nCapes flittered to the hearthrug and poked the fire, stood up, and\nturned about. \"Ann Veronica is looking very well, don't you think?\" he\nsaid, a little awkwardly.\n\n\"Very,\" said Mr. Stanley. \"Very,\" and cracked a walnut appreciatively.\n\n\"Life--things--I don't think her prospects now--Hopeful outlook.\"\n\n\"You were in a difficult position,\" Mr. Stanley pronounced, and seemed\nto hesitate whether he had not gone too far. He looked at his port wine\nas though that tawny ruby contained the solution of the matter. \"All's\nwell that ends well,\" he said; \"and the less one says about things the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Capes, and threw a newly lit cigar into the fire\nthrough sheer nervousness. \"Have some more port wine, sir?\"\n\n\"It's a very sound wine,\" said Mr. Stanley, consenting with dignity.\n\n\"Ann Veronica has never looked quite so well, I think,\" said Capes,\nclinging, because of a preconceived plan, to the suppressed topic.\n\n\n\nPart 3\n\n\nAt last the evening was over, and Capes and his wife had gone down to\nsee Mr. Stanley and his sister into a taxicab, and had waved an amiable\nfarewell from the pavement steps.\n\n\"Great dears!\" said Capes, as the vehicle passed out of sight.\n\n\"Yes, aren't they?\" said Ann Veronica, after a thoughtful pause. And\nthen, \"They seem changed.\"\n\n\"Come in out of the cold,\" said Capes, and took her arm.\n\n\"They seem smaller, you know, even physically smaller,\" she said.\n\n\"You've grown out of them.... Your aunt liked the pheasant.\"\n\n\"She liked everything. Did you hear us through the archway, talking\ncookery?\"\n\nThey went up by the lift in silence.\n\n\"It's odd,\" said Ann Veronica, re-entering the flat.\n\n\"What's odd?\"\n\n\"Oh, everything!\"\n\nShe shivered, and went to the fire and poked it. Capes sat down in the\narm-chair beside her.\n\n\"Life's so queer,\" she said, kneeling and looking into the flames. \"I\nwonder--I wonder if we shall ever get like that.\"\n\nShe turned a firelit face to her husband. \"Did you tell him?\"\n\nCapes smiled faintly. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Well--a little clumsily.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I poured him out some port wine, and I said--let me see--oh, 'You are\ngoing to be a grandfather!'\"\n\n\"Yes. Was he pleased?\"\n\n\"Calmly! He said--you won't mind my telling you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"He said, 'Poor Alice has got no end!'\"\n\n\"Alice's are different,\" said Ann Veronica, after an interval. \"Quite\ndifferent. She didn't choose her man.... Well, I told aunt....\nHusband of mine, I think we have rather overrated the emotional capacity\nof those--those dears.\"\n\n\"What did your aunt say?\"\n\n\"She didn't even kiss me. She said\"--Ann Veronica shivered again--\"'I\nhope it won't make you uncomfortable, my dear'--like that--'and\nwhatever you do, do be careful of your hair!' I think--I judge from\nher manner--that she thought it was just a little indelicate of\nus--considering everything; but she tried to be practical and\nsympathetic and live down to our standards.\"\n\nCapes looked at his wife's unsmiling face.\n\n\"Your father,\" he said, \"remarked that all's well that ends well, and\nthat he was disposed to let bygones be bygones. He then spoke with a\ncertain fatherly kindliness of the past....\"\n\n\"And my heart has ached for him!\"\n\n\"Oh, no doubt it cut him at the time. It must have cut him.\"\n\n\"We might even have--given it up for them!\"\n\n\"I wonder if we could.\"\n\n\"I suppose all IS well that ends well. Somehow to-night--I don't know.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. I'm glad the old sore is assuaged. Very glad. But if we\nhad gone under--!\"\n\nThey regarded one another silently, and Ann Veronica had one of her\npenetrating flashes.\n\n\"We are not the sort that goes under,\" said Ann Veronica, holding her\nhands so that the red reflections vanished from her eyes. \"We settled\nlong ago--we're hard stuff. We're hard stuff!\"\n\nThen she went on: \"To think that is my father! Oh, my dear! He stood\nover me like a cliff; the thought of him nearly turned me aside from\neverything we have done. He was the social order; he was law and wisdom.\nAnd they come here, and they look at our furniture to see if it is good;\nand they are not glad, it does not stir them, that at last, at last we\ncan dare to have children.\"\n\nShe dropped back into a crouching attitude and began to weep. \"Oh,\nmy dear!\" she cried, and suddenly flung herself, kneeling, into her\nhusband's arms.\n\n\"Do you remember the mountains? Do you remember how we loved one\nanother? How intensely we loved one another! Do you remember the light\non things and the glory of things? I'm greedy, I'm greedy! I want\nchildren like the mountains and life like the sky. Oh! and love--love!\nWe've had so splendid a time, and fought our fight and won. And it's\nlike the petals falling from a flower. Oh, I've loved love, dear! I've\nloved love and you, and the glory of you; and the great time is over,\nand I have to go carefully and bear children, and--take care of my\nhair--and when I am done with that I shall be an old woman. The petals\nhave fallen--the red petals we loved so. We're hedged about with\ndiscretions--and all this furniture--and successes! We are successful\nat last! Successful! But the mountains, dear! We won't forget the\nmountains, dear, ever. That shining slope of snow, and how we talked of\ndeath! We might have died! Even when we are old, when we are rich as we\nmay be, we won't forget the tune when we cared nothing for anything but\nthe joy of one another, when we risked everything for one another, when\nall the wrappings and coverings seemed to have fallen from life and left\nit light and fire.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":575,"split":"train"}
