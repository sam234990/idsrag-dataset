{"ori_id":"5f6df6afc107cfc05dd4bfc6fe963ae89aa9ab7f","title":"David Copperfield","context":"David Copperfield\n The story follows the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, England, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years in relative happiness with his loving, childish mother and their kindly housekeeper, Peggotty. When he is seven years old his mother marries Edward Murdstone. During the marriage, partly to get him out of the way and partly because he strongly objects to the whole proceeding, David is sent to lodge with Peggotty\u2019s family in Yarmouth. Her brother, the fisherman Peggotty, lives in a houseboat with his adopted relatives Em\u2019ly and Ham, and an elderly widow, Mrs Gummidge. Little Em\u2019ly is somewhat spoilt by her fond foster father, and David is in love with her. On his return, David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Between them they tyrannise over his poor mother, making her and David\u2019s lives miserable, and when in consequence David falls behind in his studies, Murdstone attempts to thrash him \u2013 partly to further pain his mother. David bites him and soon afterwards is sent away to a boarding school, Salem House, under a ruthless headmaster, Mr. Creakle. There he befriends an older boy, James Steerforth, and Tommy Traddles. He develops an impassioned admiration for Steerforth, perceiving him as something noble, who could do great things if he would.\nDavid goes home for the holidays only to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries the local carrier, Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London \u2013 a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner. Copperfield's tragicomic landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is arrested for debt and sent to the King's Bench Prison, where he remains for several months, before being released and moving to Plymouth. No one remains to care for David in London, so he decides to run away.\nHe walks from London to Dover, where he finds his only relative, his unmarried, eccentric great-aunt Betsey Trotwood. She had come to Blunderstone at his birth, only to depart in ire upon learning that he was not a girl. However, she takes pity on him and agrees to raise him, despite Murdstone's attempt to regain custody of David, on condition that he always tries to \u2018be as like his sister, Betsey Trotwood\u2032 as he can be, meaning that he is to endeavour to emulate the prospective namesake she was disappointed of. David's great-aunt renames him \"Trotwood Copperfield\" and addresses him as \"Trot\", and it becomes one of several names which David is called by in the course of the novel.\nDavid is sent to another school by his aunt, as he calls his great-aunt. This is a far better school than the last he attended, and is run by Dr Strong, whose methods inculcate honour and self-reliance in his pupils. During term, David lodges with the lawyer Mr Wickfield, and his daughter Agnes, who becomes David\u2019s friend and confidante. Wickfield has a secretary, the 15 year-old Uriah Heep.\nBy devious means Uriah Heep gradually gains a complete ascendancy over the aging Wickfield, to Agnes\u2019 great sorrow. Heep hopes, and maliciously confides to David, that he aspires to Agnes\u2019 hand. Ultimately with the aid of Micawber, who has been employed by Heep as a secretary, his fraudulent behaviour is revealed, and Wickfield vindicated; he had been apparently instrumental in the loss of David\u2019s Aunt Trotwood\u2019s fortune, which Heep had in fact stolen. At the end of the book, David meets him in a prison, for attempting to defraud the Bank of England.\nDavid's romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, seduces and dishonours Emily, offering to marry her off to one of his servants before finally deserting her. Her uncle Peggotty manages to find her with the help of London prostitute Martha, who had grown up in their county. Ham, who had been engaged to marry her before the tragedy, died in a storm off the coast in attempting to succour a ship; Steerforth was aboard the same and also died. Peggotty takes Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by the widowed Mrs. Gummidge and the Micawbers, where all eventually find security and happiness.\nDavid marries the beautiful but na\u00efve Dora Spenlow, who dies after failing to recover from a miscarriage early in their marriage. David then searches his soul and weds the sensible Agnes, who had always loved him and with whom he finds true happiness. David and Agnes then have at least five children, including a daughter named after his great-aunt, Betsey Trotwood.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Personal History of David Copperfield, by\nCharles Dickens, Illustrated by H.

My interest\nin it, is so recent and strong; and my mind is so divided between\npleasure and regret--pleasure in the achievement of a long design,\nregret in the separation from many companions--that I am in danger of\nwearying the reader whom I love, with personal confidences, and private\nemotions.\n\nBesides which, all that I could say of the Story, to any purpose, I have\nendeavoured to say in it.\n\nIt would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how sorrowfully\nthe pen is laid down at the close of a two-years' imaginative task; or\nhow an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself\ninto the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are\ngoing from him for ever. Yet, I have nothing else to tell; unless,\nindeed, I were to confess (which might be of less moment still) that no\none can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I have\nbelieved it in the writing.\n\nInstead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I cannot close\nthis Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful glance towards\nthe time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month,\nand with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have\nfallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy.\n\n  LONDON,\n    _October_, 1850.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\n                                                               PAGE\n\n  CHAPTER I.

To begin my\nlife with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have\nbeen informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It\nwas remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry,\nsimultaneously.\n\nIn consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the\nnurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a\nlively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of\nour becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be\nunlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and\nspirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all\nunlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a\nFriday night.\n\nI need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show\nbetter than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified\nby the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark,\nthat unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still\na baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of\nhaving been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in\nthe present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.\n\nI was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the\nnewspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going\npeople were short of money about that time, or were short of faith\nand preferred cork-jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there\nwas but one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected\nwith the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and\nthe balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning\non any higher bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn\nat a dead loss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry\nwas in the market then--and ten years afterwards the caul was put\nup in a raffle down in our part of the country, to fifty members at\nhalf-a-crown a head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present\nmyself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused,\nat a part of myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I\nrecollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly,\nproduced from it the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and\ntwopence halfpenny short--as it took an immense time and a great waste\nof arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is\na fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that\nshe was never drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two.\nI have understood that it was, to the last, her proudest boast, that\nshe never had been on the water in her life, except upon a bridge; and\nthat over her tea (to which she was extremely partial) she, to the\nlast, expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others,\nwho had the presumption to go \"meandering\" about the world. It was in\nvain to represent to her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included,\nresulted from this objectionable practice. She always returned, with\ngreater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of\nher objection, \"Let us have no meandering.\"\n\nNot to meander, myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.\n\nI was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or \"thereby,\" as they say in\nScotland. I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon\nthe light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is\nsomething strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never\nsaw me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I\nhave of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in\nthe church-yard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for\nit lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlor\nwas warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house\nwere--almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes--bolted and locked\nagainst it.\n\nAn aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom I\nshall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our\nfamily. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called\nher, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable\npersonage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married to\na husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the\nsense of the homely adage, \"handsome is, that handsome does\"--for he was\nstrongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having\nonce, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined\narrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These\nevidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him\noff, and effect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with\nhis capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was\nonce seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think\nit must have been a Baboo--or a Begum. Any how, from India tidings of\nhis death reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt,\nnobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden\nname again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way\noff, established herself there as a single woman with one servant, and\nwas understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible\nretirement.\n\nMy father had once been a favorite of hers, I believe; but she was\nmortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was \"a\nwax doll.\" She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not yet\ntwenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double my\nmother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He\ndied a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came\ninto the world.\n\nThis was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what _I_ may be\nexcused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no\nclaim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to\nhave any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what\nfollows.\n\nMy mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in\nspirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about\nherself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by\nsome grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer up-stairs, to a world not at\nall excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting\nby the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and\nvery doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her,\nwhen, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she\nsaw a strange lady coming up the garden.\n\nMy mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was Miss\nBetsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the\ngarden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity\nof figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to\nnobody else.\n\nWhen she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity. My\nfather had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any\nordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and\nlooked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against\nthe glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became\nperfectly flat and white in a moment.\n\nShe gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am\nindebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.\n\nMy mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the\ncorner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and enquiringly,\nbegan on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head\nin a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown\nand a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to\ncome and open the door. My mother went.\n\n\"Mrs. David Copperfield, I _think_,\" said Miss Betsey; the emphasis\nreferring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.\n\n\"Yes,\" said my mother, faintly.\n\n\"Miss Trotwood,\" said the visitor. \"You have heard of her, I dare say?\"\n\nMy mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable\nconsciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering\npleasure.\n\n\"Now you see her,\" said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged\nher to walk in.\n\nThey went into the parlor my mother had come from, the fire in the best\nroom on the other side of the passage not being lighted--not having been\nlighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both\nseated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to\nrestrain herself, began to cry.\n\n\"Oh tut, tut, tut!\" said Miss Betsey, in a hurry. \"Don't do that! Come,\ncome!\"\n\nMy mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had\nhad her cry out.\n\n\"Take off your cap, child,\" said Miss Betsey, \"and let me see you.\"\n\nMy mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd\nrequest, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as she\nwas told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was\nluxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.\n\n\"Why, bless my heart!\" exclaimed Miss Betsey. \"You are a very Baby!\"\n\nMy mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her\nyears; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said,\nsobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and\nwould be but a childish mother if she lived. In a short pause which\nensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and\nthat with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she\nfound that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands\nfolded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire.\n\n\"In the name of Heaven,\" said Miss Betsey, suddenly, \"why Rookery?\"\n\n\"Do you mean the house, ma'am?\" asked my mother.\n\n\"Why Rookery?\" said Miss Betsey. \"Cookery would have been more to the\npurpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.\"\n\n\"The name was Mr. Copperfield's choice,\" returned my mother. \"When he\nbought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.\"\n\nThe evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old\nelm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss\nBetsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one another,\nlike giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such\nrepose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if\ntheir late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,\nsome weather-beaten ragged old rooks'-nests, burdening their higher\nbranches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.\n\n\"Where are the birds?\" asked Miss Betsey.\n\n\"The ----?\" My mother had been thinking of something else.\n\n\"The rooks--what has become of them?\" asked Miss Betsey.\n\n\"There have not been any since we have lived here,\" said my mother. \"We\nthought--Mr. Copperfield thought--it was quite a large rookery; but the\nnests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long\nwhile.\"\n\n\"David Copperfield all over!\" cried Miss Betsey. \"David Copperfield from\nhead to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there's not a rook near it,\nand takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" returned my mother, \"is dead, and if you dare to\nspeak unkindly of him to me----\"\n\nMy poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of\ncommitting an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have\nsettled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better\ntraining for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed\nwith the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very\nmeekly, and fainted.\n\nWhen she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,\nwhichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The\ntwilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they\nsaw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the\nfire.\n\n\"Well?\" said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only\nbeen taking a casual look at the prospect; \"and when do you expect----\"\n\n\"I am all in a tremble,\" faltered my mother. \"I don't know what's the\nmatter. I shall die, I am sure!\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Miss Betsey. \"Have some tea.\"\n\n\"Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?\" cried my\nmother in a helpless manner.\n\n\"Of course it will,\" said Miss Betsey. \"It's nothing but fancy. What do\nyou call your girl?\"\n\n\"I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am,\" said my mother\ninnocently.\n\n\"Bless the Baby!\" exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the\nsecond sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer up-stairs, but\napplying it to my mother instead of me, \"I don't mean that. I mean your\nservant-girl.\"\n\n\"Peggotty,\" said my mother.\n\n\"Peggotty!\" repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. \"Do you mean to\nsay, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church, and\ngot herself named Peggotty?\"\n\n\"It's her surname,\" said my mother, faintly. \"Mr. Copperfield called her\nby it, because her Christian name was the same as mine.\"\n\n\"Here! Peggotty!\" cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlor-door. \"Tea. Your\nmistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle.\"\n\nHaving issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been\na recognised authority in the house ever since it had been a house, and\nhaving looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the\npassage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut\nthe door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the\nskirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.\n\n\"You were speaking about its being a girl,\" said Miss Betsey. \"I have no\ndoubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl.\nNow child, from the moment of the birth of this girl--\"\n\n\"Perhaps boy,\" my mother took the liberty of putting in.\n\n\"I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,\" returned Miss\nBetsey. \"Don't contradict. From the moment of this girl's birth, child,\nI intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg\nyou'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes\nin life with _this_ Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with\n_her_ affections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well\nguarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not\ndeserved. I must make that _my_ care.\"\n\nThere was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,\nas if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any\nplainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,\nat least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too much\nscared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and\nbewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what\nto say.\n\n\"And was David good to you, child?\" asked Miss Betsey, when she had been\nsilent for a little while, and these motions of her head had gradually\nceased. \"Were you comfortable together?\"\n\n\"We were very happy,\" said my mother. \"Mr. Copperfield was only too good\nto me.\"\n\n\"What, he spoilt you, I suppose?\" returned Miss Betsey.\n\n\"For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world\nagain, yes, I fear he did indeed,\" sobbed my mother.\n\n\"Well! Don't cry!\" said Miss Betsey. \"You were not equally matched,\nchild--if any two people _can_ be equally matched--and so I asked the\nquestion. You were an orphan, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And a governess?\"\n\n\"I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to\nvisit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of\nnotice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed\nto me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,\" said my mother\nsimply.\n\n\"Ha! poor Baby!\" mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the\nfire. \"Do you know anything?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" faltered my mother.\n\n\"About keeping house, for instance,\" said Miss Betsey.\n\n\"Not much, I fear,\" returned my mother. \"Not so much as I could wish.\nBut Mr. Copperfield was teaching me--\"\n\n(\"Much he knew about it himself!\") said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.\n\n--\"And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, and\nhe very patient to teach, if the great misfortune of his death\"--my\nmother broke down again here, and could get no farther.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Miss Betsey.\n\n--\"I kept my housekeeping-book regularly, and balanced it with Mr.\nCopperfield every night,\" cried my mother in another burst of distress,\nand breaking down again.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Miss Betsey. \"Don't cry any more.\"\n\n--\"And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it, except\nwhen Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like\neach other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,\"\nresumed my mother in another burst, and breaking down again.\n\n\"You'll make yourself ill,\" said Miss Betsey, \"and you know that will\nnot be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You mustn't do\nit!\"\n\nThis argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her\nincreasing indisposition perhaps had a larger one. There was an interval\nof silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating \"Ha!\"\nas she sat with her feet upon the fender.\n\n\"David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,\" said\nshe, by and by. \"What did he do for you?\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" said my mother, answering with some difficulty, \"was\nso considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to\nme.\"\n\n\"How much?\" asked Miss Betsey.\n\n\"A hundred and five pounds a year,\" said my mother.\n\n\"He might have done worse,\" said my aunt.\n\nThe word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much worse that\nPeggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing at a\nglance how ill she was,--as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there\nhad been light enough,--conveyed her up-stairs to her own room with all\nspeed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been\nfor some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a\nspecial messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor.\n\nThose allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived\nwithin a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of\nportentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied\nover her left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty\nknowing nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her, she\nwas quite a mystery in the parlor; and the fact of her having a magazine\nof jewellers' cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in her ears\nin that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her presence.\n\nThe doctor having been up-stairs and come down again, and having\nsatisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this\nunknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some\nhours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of\nhis sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to\ntake up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet, and\nmore slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in modest\ndepreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody\nelse. It is nothing to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He\ncouldn't have _thrown_ a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him\none gently, or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly\nas he walked; but he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't\nhave been quick with him, for any earthly consideration.\n\nMr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt, with his head on one side, and\nmaking her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as\nhe softly touched his left ear:\n\n\"Some local irritation, ma'am?\"\n\n\"What!\" replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork.\n\nMr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness--as he told my mother\nafterwards--that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind. But\nhe repeated, sweetly:\n\n\"Some local irritation, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow.\n\nMr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,\nas she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called up-stairs again.\nAfter some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned.\n\n\"Well?\" said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him.\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Chillip, \"we are--we are progressing slowly,\nma'am.\"\n\n\"Ba--a--ah!\" said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous\ninterjection. And corked herself, as before.\n\nReally--really--as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked;\nspeaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.\nBut he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours, as\nshe sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After\nanother absence, he again returned.\n\n\"Well?\" said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Chillip, \"we are--we are progressing slowly,\nma'am.\"\n\n\"Ya--a--ah!\" said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip\nabsolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to break his\nspirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs,\nin the dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.\n\nHam Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very dragon at\nhis catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness,\nreported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlor-door an hour\nafter this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking to\nand fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make\nhis escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices\noverhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the\ncircumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on\nwhom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest.\nThat, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had\nbeen taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled\nhis hair, made light of his linen, stopped _his_ ears as if she\nconfounded them with her own, and otherwise touzled and maltreated him.\nThis was in part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half-past twelve\no'clock, soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as\nI was.\n\nThe mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if\nat any time. He sidled into the parlor as soon as he was at liberty, and\nsaid to my aunt in his meekest manner:\n\n\"Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.\"\n\n\"What upon?\" said my aunt, sharply.\n\nMr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's\nmanner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to\nmollify her.\n\n\"Mercy on the man, what's he doing!\" cried my aunt, impatiently. \"Can't\nhe speak?\"\n\n\"Be calm, my dear ma'am,\" said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.\n\"There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am. Be calm.\"\n\nIt has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn't shake\nhim, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own\nhead at him, but in a way that made him quail.\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, \"I am\nhappy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over.\"\n\nDuring the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery\nof this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.\n\n\"How is she?\" said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still tied\non one of them.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,\" returned Mr.\nChillip. \"Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be,\nunder these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any\nobjection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. It may do her good.\"\n\n\"And _she_. How is _she_?\" said my aunt, sharply.\n\nMr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my\naunt like an amiable bird.\n\n\"The baby,\" said my aunt. \"How is she?\"\n\n\"Ma'am,\" returned Mr. Chillip, \"I apprehended you had known. It's a\nboy.\"\n\nMy aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the\nmanner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put it on\nbent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented\nfairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly\nsupposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more.\n\nNo. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey\nTrotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows, the\ntremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light upon\nthe window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such\ntravellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he,\nwithout whom I had never been.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nI OBSERVE.\n\n\nThe first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look\nfar back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty\nhair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so\ndark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,\nand cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't\npeck her in preference to apples.\n\nI believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed\nto my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going\nunsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind\nwhich I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of\nPeggotty's fore-finger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its\nbeing roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.\n\nThis may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go\nfarther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe\nthe power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite\nwonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most\ngrown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety\nbe said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the\nrather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness,\nand gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an\ninheritance they have preserved from their childhood.\n\nI might have a misgiving that I am \"meandering\" in stopping to say this,\nbut that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part\nupon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear from anything\nI may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close\nobservation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I\nundoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.\n\nLooking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first\nobjects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of\nthings, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let me see.\n\nThere comes out of the cloud, our house--not new to me, but quite\nfamiliar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's\nkitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in the\ncentre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog-kennel in a corner,\nwithout any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me,\nwalking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who\ngets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as I\nlook at him through the kitchen-window, who makes me shiver, he is so\nfierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me\nwith their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at\nnight: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.\n\nHere is a long passage--what an enormous perspective I make of\nit!--leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front-door. A dark\nstore-room opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at\nnight; for I don't know what may be among those tubs and jars and old\ntea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light,\nletting a mouldy air come out at the door, in which there is the smell\nof soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then\nthere are the two parlors: the parlor in which we sit of an evening, my\nmother and I and Peggotty--for Peggotty is quite our companion, when\nher work is done and we are alone--and the best parlor where we sit\non a Sunday; grandly, but not so comfortably. There is something of a\ndoleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty has told me--I don't\nknow when, but apparently ages ago--about my father's funeral, and the\ncompany having their black cloaks put on. One Sunday night my mother\nreads to Peggotty and me in there, how Lazarus was raised up from the\ndead. And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take\nme out of bed, and shew me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom\nwindow, with the dead all lying in their graves at rest, below the\nsolemn moon.\n\nThere is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of\nthat churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so\nquiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel\nup, early in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my\nmother's room, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining on\nthe sun-dial, and think within myself, \"Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder,\nthat it can tell the time again?\"\n\n  [Illustration: Our Pew at Church.]\n\nHere is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a window\nnear it, out of which our house can be seen, and _is_ seen many times\nduring the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself as\nsure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames. But\nthough Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does, and\nfrowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the\nclergyman. But I can't always look at him--I know him without that white\nthing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps\nstopping the service to enquire--and what am I to do? It's a dreadful\nthing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but _she_\npretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and _he_ makes\nfaces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through\nthe porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don't mean a sinner, but\nmutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that if\nI looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out\nloud; and what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental\ntablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this\nparish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when\naffliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in\nvain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain;\nand if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from\nMr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a\ngood place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with\nanother boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet\ncushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes\ngradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a\ndrowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with\na crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.\n\nAnd now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed\nbedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and\nthe ragged old rooks'-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the\nbottom of the front garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond\nthe yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are--a very\npreserve of butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a\ngate and padlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and\nricher than fruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where\nmy mother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive\ngooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A great wind rises, and the\nsummer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight,\ndancing about the parlor. When my mother is out of breath and rests\nherself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round\nher fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I\ndo that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being so pretty.\n\nThat is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we\nwere both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most\nthings to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be\nso called--that I ever derived from what I saw.\n\nPeggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlor fire, alone. I\nhad been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very\nperspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for\nI remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they\nwere a sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy;\nbut having leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came\nhome from spending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather have\ndied upon my post (of course) than have gone to bed. I had reached\nthat stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow\nimmensely large. I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers,\nand looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little bit\nof wax-candle she kept for her thread--how old it looked, being so\nwrinkled in all directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof,\nwhere the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding lid, with\na view of Saint Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the\ntop; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought\nlovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything, for\na moment, I was gone.\n\n\"Peggotty,\" says I, suddenly, \"were you ever married?\"\n\n\"Lord, Master Davy,\" replied Peggotty. \"What's put marriage in your\nhead!\"\n\nShe answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she\nstopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its\nthread's length.\n\n\"But _were_ you ever married, Peggotty?\" says I. \"You are a very\nhandsome woman, an't you?\"\n\nI thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly; but of\nanother school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There was\na red velvet footstool in the best parlor, on which my mother had\npainted a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's\ncomplexion, appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was\nsmooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.\n\n\"Me handsome, Davy!\" said Peggotty. \"Lawk, no, my dear! But what put\nmarriage in your head?\"\n\n\"I don't know!--You mustn't marry more than one person at a time, may\nyou, Peggotty?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.\n\n\"But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may marry\nanother person, mayn't you, Peggotty?\"\n\n\"You MAY,\" says Peggotty, \"if you choose, my dear. That's a matter of\nopinion.\"\n\n\"But what is your opinion, Peggotty?\" said I.\n\nI asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so\ncuriously at me.\n\n\"My opinion is,\" said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little\nindecision and going on with her work, \"that I never was married myself,\nMaster Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?\" said I, after sitting\nquiet for a minute.\n\nI really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite\nmistaken: for she laid aside her work, (which was a stocking of her\nown,) and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and\ngave it a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being\nvery plump, whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed,\nsome of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recollect\ntwo bursting to the opposite side of the parlor, while she was hugging\nme.\n\n\"Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,\" said Peggotty, who\nwas not quite right in the name yet, \"for I an't heard half enough.\"\n\nI couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she was\nso ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those\nmonsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in\nthe sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled\nthem by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on\naccount of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,\nas natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in\nshort we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. _I_ did at least; but I had\nmy doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into\nvarious parts of her face and arms, all the time.\n\nWe had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when the\ngarden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my mother,\nlooking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman with\nbeautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from\nchurch last Sunday.\n\nAs my mother stooped down on the threshhold to take me in her arms and\nkiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow\nthan a monarch--or something like that; for my later understanding\ncomes, I am sensible, to my aid here.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" I asked him, over her shoulder.\n\nHe patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep\nvoice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in\ntouching me--which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.\n\n\"Oh Davy!\" remonstrated my mother.\n\n\"Dear boy!\" said the gentleman. \"I cannot wonder at his devotion!\"\n\nI never saw such a beautiful color on my mother's face before. She\ngently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl,\nturned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her\nhome. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with\nhis own, she glanced, I thought, at me.\n\n\"Let us say 'good night,' my fine boy,\" said the gentleman, when he had\nbent his head--_I_ saw him!--over my mother's little glove.\n\n\"Good night!\" said I.\n\n\"Come! Let us be the best friends in the world!\" said the gentleman,\nlaughing. \"Shake hands!\"\n\nMy right hand was in my mother's left, so I gave him the other.\n\n\"Why that's the wrong hand, Davy!\" laughed the gentleman.\n\nMy mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my former\nreason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and he\nshook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.\n\nAt this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last\nlook with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.\n\nPeggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the\nfastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlor. My mother,\ncontrary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the\nfire, remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.\n\n\"--Hope you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am,\" said Peggotty, standing\nas stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick in\nher hand.\n\n\"Much obliged to you, Peggotty,\" returned my mother, in a cheerful\nvoice, \"I have had a _very_ pleasant evening.\"\n\n\"A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,\" suggested Peggotty.\n\n\"A very agreeable change indeed,\" returned my mother.\n\nPeggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room, and\nmy mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so sound\nasleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.\nWhen I half awoke from this uncomfortable doze, I found Peggotty and my\nmother both in tears, and both talking.\n\n\"Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked,\" said\nPeggotty. \"That I say, and that I swear!\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" cried my mother. \"You'll drive me mad! Was ever any poor\ngirl so ill-used by her servants as I am! Why do I do myself the\ninjustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,\nPeggotty?\"\n\n\"God knows you have, ma'am,\" returned Peggotty.\n\n\"Then how can you dare,\" said my mother--\"you know I don't mean how can\nyou dare, Peggotty, but how can you have the heart--to make me so\nuncomfortable and say such bitter things to me, when you are well aware\nthat I haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to!\"\n\n\"The more's the reason,\" returned Peggotty, \"for saying that it won't\ndo. No! That it won't do. No! No price could make it do. No!\"--I thought\nPeggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic\nwith it.\n\n\"How can you be so aggravating,\" said my mother, shedding more tears\nthan before, \"as to talk in such an unjust manner! How can you go on as\nif it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell you over and\nover again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest civilities\nnothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I to do? If people\nare so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault? What am I to\ndo, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face, or\ndisfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something of that sort? I\ndare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you'd quite enjoy it.\"\n\nPeggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.\n\n\"And my dear boy,\" cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in which I\nwas, and caressing me, \"my own little Davy! Is it to be hinted to me\nthat I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest\nlittle fellow that ever was!\"\n\n\"Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"You did, Peggotty!\" returned my mother. \"You know you did. What else\nwas it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature, when\nyou know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I\nwouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed\nthe whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy. You know it is,\nPeggotty. You can't deny it.\" Then, turning affectionately to me, with\nher cheek against mine, \"Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy? Am I a nasty,\ncruel, selfish, bad mama? Say I am, my child; say 'yes;' dear boy, and\nPeggotty will love you, and Peggotty's love is a great deal better than\nmine, Davy. _I_ don't love you at all, do I?\"\n\nAt this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of\nthe party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite\nheartbroken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of\nwounded tenderness I called Peggotty a \"Beast.\" That honest creature\nwas in deep affliction, I remember, and must have become quite\nbuttonless on the occasion; for a little volley of those explosives\nwent off, when, after having made it up with my mother, she kneeled\ndown by the elbow-chair, and made it up with me.\n\nWe went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long\ntime; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found\nmy mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in\nher arms, after that, and slept soundly.\n\nWhether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again, or\nwhether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared, I\ncannot recal. I don't profess to be clear about dates. But there he was,\nin church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too, to\nlook at a famous geranium we had, in the parlor-window. It did not\nappear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked\nmy mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose it\nfor himself, but he refused to do that--I could not understand why--so\nshe plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would\nnever, never, part with it any more; and I thought he must be quite a\nfool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.\n\nPeggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always\nbeen. My mother deferred to her very much--more than usual, it occurred\nto me--and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different\nfrom what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among ourselves.\nSometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother's\nwearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her going\nso often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to my\nsatisfaction, make out how it was.\n\nGradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black\nwhiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy\njealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child's\ninstinctive dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make\nmuch of my mother without any help, it certainly was not _the_ reason\nthat I might have found if I had been older. No such thing came into my\nmind, or near it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were; but as\nto making a net of a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it,\nthat was, as yet, beyond me.\n\nOne autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when Mr.\nMurdstone--I knew him by that name now--came by, on horseback. He reined\nup his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to Lowestoft to\nsee some friends who were there with a yacht, and merrily proposed to\ntake me on the saddle before him if I would like the ride.\n\nThe air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the idea\nof the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the\ngarden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent up-stairs to\nPeggotty to be made spruce; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone\ndismounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm, walked\nslowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my\nmother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I\nrecollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I\nrecollect how closely they appeared to be examining the sweetbriar\nbetween them, as they strolled along; and how, from being in a perfectly\nangelic temper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair\nthe wrong way, excessively hard.\n\nMr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green turf\nby the side of the road. He held me quite easily with one arm, and I\ndon't think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my mind to\nsit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and looking up in\nhis face. He had that kind of shallow black eye--I want a better word to\nexpress an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into--which, when it\nis abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured,\nfor a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced at him,\nI observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what he was\nthinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker and\nthicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for being.\nA squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication\nof the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of the\nwax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year\nbefore. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black, and\nbrown, of his complexion--confound his complexion, and his memory!--made\nme think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very handsome man. I have no\ndoubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too.\n\nWe went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking cigars\nin a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four chairs,\nand had a large rough jacket on. In a corner was a heap of coats and\nboat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.\n\nThey both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when we\ncame in, and said \"Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were dead!\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n\n\"And who's this shaver?\" said one of the gentlemen, taking hold of me.\n\n\"That's Davy,\" returned Mr. Murdstone.\n\n\"Davy who?\" said the gentleman. \"Jones?\"\n\n\"Copperfield,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n\n\"What! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's incumbrance?\" cried the gentleman.\n\"The pretty little widow?\"\n\n\"Quinion,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \"take care, if you please. Somebody's\nsharp.\"\n\n\"Who is?\" asked the gentleman, laughing.\n\nI looked up, quickly; being curious to know.\n\n\"Only Brooks of Sheffield,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n\nI was quite relieved to find it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, at\nfirst, I really thought it was I.\n\nThere seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr.\nBrooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was\nmentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After some\nlaughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said:\n\n\"And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the\nprojected business?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at present,\"\nreplied Mr. Murdstone; \"but he is not generally favourable, I believe.\"\n\nThere was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the\nbell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did; and when\nthe wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, and, before I\ndrank it, stand up and say \"Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield!\" The toast\nwas received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that it made\nme laugh too; at which they laughed the more. In short, we quite enjoyed\nourselves.\n\nWe walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and\nlooked at things through a telescope--I could make out nothing myself\nwhen it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could--and then we came\nback to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two\ngentlemen smoked incessantly--which, I thought, if I might judge from\nthe smell of their rough coats, they must have been doing, ever since\nthe coats had first come home from the tailor's. I must not forget that\nwe went on board the yacht, where they all three descended into the\ncabin, and were busy with some papers. I saw them quite hard at work,\nwhen I looked down through the open skylight. They left me, during this\ntime, with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very\nsmall shiny hat upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat\non, with \"Skylark\" in capital letters across the chest. I thought it was\nhis name; and that as he lived on board ship and hadn't a street-door to\nput his name on, he put it there instead; but when I called him Mr.\nSkylark, he said it meant the vessel.\n\nI observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the\ntwo gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with\none another, but seldom with him. It appeared to me that he was more\nclever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with\nsomething of my own feeling. I remarked that once or twice when Mr.\nQuinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make\nsure of his not being displeased; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the\nother gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave\nhim a secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. Murdstone, who was\nsitting stern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed\nat all that day, except at the Sheffield joke--and that, by the by, was\nhis own.\n\nWe went home early in the evening. It was a very fine evening, and my\nmother and he had another stroll by the sweet-briar, while I was sent in\nto get my tea. When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the day I\nhad had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they had said\nabout her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent fellows who\ntalked nonsense--but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite as well as I\nknow it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all\nacquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered No, only she\nsupposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way.\n\nCan I say of her face--altered as I have reason to remember it, perished\nas I know it is--that it is gone, when here it comes before me at this\ninstant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a\ncrowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it\nfaded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it\nfell that night? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings\nher back to life, thus only; and, truer to its loving youth than I have\nbeen, or man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?\n\nI write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,\nand she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the\nside of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing, said:\n\n\"What was it they said, Davy? Tell me again. I can't believe it.\"\n\n\"'Bewitching----'\" I began.\n\nMy mother put her hands upon her lips to stop me.\n\n\"It was never bewitching,\" she said, laughing. \"It never could have been\nbewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't!\"\n\n\"Yes it was. 'Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield,'\" I repeated stoutly. \"And\n'pretty.'\"\n\n\"No no, it was never pretty. Not pretty,\" interposed my mother, laying\nher fingers on my lips again.\n\n\"Yes it was. 'Pretty little widow.'\"\n\n\"What foolish, impudent creatures!\" cried my mother, laughing and\ncovering her face. \"What ridiculous men! An't they? Davy dear----\"\n\n\"Well, Ma.\"\n\n\"Don't tell Peggotty; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully\nangry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know.\"\n\nI promised, of course; and we kissed one another over and over again,\nand I soon fell fast asleep.\n\nIt seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day\nwhen Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am\nabout to mention; but it was probably about two months afterwards.\n\nWe were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out as\nbefore), in company with the stocking and the yard measure, and the bit\nof wax, and the box with Saint Paul's on the lid, and the crocodile\nbook, when Peggotty, after looking at me several times, and opening her\nmouth as if she were going to speak, without doing it--which I thought\nwas merely gaping, or I should have been rather alarmed--said coaxingly:\n\n\"Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend a\nfortnight at my brother's at Yarmouth? Wouldn't _that_ be a treat?\"\n\n\"Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?\" I enquired, provisionally.\n\n\"Oh what an agreeable man he is!\" cried Peggotty, holding up her hands.\n\"Then there's the sea; and the boats and ships; and the fishermen; and\nthe beach; and Am to play with--\"\n\nPeggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter; but she\nspoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar.\n\nI was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it would\nindeed be a treat, but what would my mother say?\n\n\"Why then I'll as good as bet a guinea,\" said Peggotty, intent upon my\nface, \"that she'll let us go. I'll ask her, if you like, as soon as ever\nshe comes home. There now!\"\n\n\"But what's she to do while we're away?\" said I, putting my small elbows\non the table to argue the point. \"She can't live by herself.\"\n\nIf Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the heel of\nthat stocking, it must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth\ndarning.\n\n\"I say! Peggotty! She can't live by herself, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh bless you!\" said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. \"Don't you\nknow? She's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper. Mrs.\nGrayper's going to have a lot of company.\"\n\nOh! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the utmost\nimpatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper's (for it was\nthat identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry\nout this great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had\nexpected, my mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged\nthat night, and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid\nfor.\n\nThe day soon came for our going. It was such an early day that it came\nsoon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid\nthat an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsion\nof nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a\ncarrier's cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would\nhave given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,\nand sleep in my hat and boots.\n\nIt touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect how\neager I was to leave my happy home; to think how little I suspected what\nI did leave for ever.\n\nI am glad to recollect that when the carrier's cart was at the gate, and\nmy mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for\nthe old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am\nglad to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat\nagainst mine.\n\nI am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother\nran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she might kiss me\nonce more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which\nshe lifted up her face to mine, and did so.\n\nAs we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where she\nwas, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. I was\nlooking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business it\nwas of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side,\nseemed anything but satisfied; as the face she brought back into the\ncart denoted.\n\nI sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this\nsupposititious case: whether, if she were employed to lose me like the\nboy in the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by\nthe buttons she would shed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nI HAVE A CHANGE.\n\n\nThe carrier's horse was the laziest horse in the world, I should hope,\nand shuffled along, with his head down, as if he liked to keep the\npeople waiting to whom the packages were directed. I fancied, indeed,\nthat he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the carrier\nsaid he was only troubled with a cough.\n\nThe carrier had a way of keeping his head down, like his horse, and of\ndrooping sleepily forward as he drove, with one of his arms on each of\nhis knees. I say \"drove,\" but it struck me that the cart would have gone\nto Yarmouth quite as well without him, for the horse did all that; and\nas to conversation, he had no idea of it but whistling.\n\nPeggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would have\nlasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the same\nconveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. Peggotty always\nwent to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket, her hold of\nwhich never relaxed; and I could not have believed unless I had heard\nher do it, that one defenceless woman could have snored so much.\n\nWe made so many deviations up and down lanes, and were such a long time\ndelivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at other places,\nthat I was quite tired, and very glad, when we saw Yarmouth. It looked\nrather spongy and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye over the great\ndull waste that lay across the river; and I could not help wondering, if\nthe world were really as round as my geography-book said, how any part\nof it came to be so flat. But I reflected that Yarmouth might be\nsituated at one of the poles; which would account for it.\n\nAs we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a\nstraight low line under the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so\nmight have improved it; and also that if the land had been a little more\nseparated from the sea, and the town and the tide had not been quite so\nmuch mixed up, like toast and water, it would have been nicer. But\nPeggotty said, with greater emphasis than usual, that we must take\nthings as we found them, and that, for her part, she was proud to call\nherself a Yarmouth Bloater.\n\nWhen we got into the street (which was strange enough to me), and smelt\nthe fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors walking\nabout, and the carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt that I\nhad done so busy a place an injustice; and said as much to Peggotty, who\nheard my expressions of delight with great complacency, and told me it\nwas well known (I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born\nBloaters) that Yarmouth was, upon the whole, the finest place in the\nuniverse.\n\n\"Here's my Am!\" screamed Peggotty, \"growed out of knowledge!\"\n\nHe was waiting for us, in fact, at the public-house; and asked me how I\nfound myself, like an old acquaintance. I did not feel, at first, that I\nknew him as well as he knew me, because he had never come to our house\nsince the night I was born, and naturally he had the advantage of me.\nBut our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry\nme home. He was, now, a huge, strong fellow of six feet high, broad in\nproportion, and round-shouldered; but with a simpering boy's face and\ncurly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look. He was dressed in\na canvas jacket, and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would\nhave stood quite as well alone, without any legs in them. And you\ncouldn't so properly have said he wore a hat, as that he was covered in\na-top, like an old building, with something pitchy.\n\nHam carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm,\nand Peggotty carrying another small box of ours, we turned down lanes\nbestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand, and went past\ngas-works, rope-walks, boat-builders' yards, ship-wrights' yards,\nship-breakers' yards, caulkers' yards, riggers' lofts, smiths' forges,\nand a great litter of such places, until we came out upon the dull\nwaste I had already seen at a distance; when Ham said,\n\n\"Yon's our house, Mas'r Davy!\"\n\nI looked in all directions, as far as I could stare over the wilderness,\nand away at the sea, and away at the river, but no house could _I_ make\nout. There was a black barge, or some other kind of superannuated boat,\nnot far off, high and dry on the ground, with an iron funnel sticking\nout of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily; but nothing else in the\nway of a habitation that was visible to _me_.\n\n\"That's not it?\" said I. \"That ship-looking thing?\"\n\n\"That's it, Mas'r Davy,\" returned Ham.\n\nIf it had been Aladdin's palace, roc's egg and all, I suppose I could\nnot have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it. There\nwas a delightful door cut in the side, and it was roofed in, and there\nwere little windows in it; but the wonderful charm of it was, that it\nwas a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundreds of\ntimes, and which had never been intended to be lived in, on dry land.\nThat was the captivation of it to me. If it had ever been meant to be\nlived in, I might have thought it small, or inconvenient, or lonely; but\nnever having been designed for any such use, it became a perfect abode.\n\nIt was beautifully clean inside, and as tidy as possible. There was a\ntable, and a Dutch clock, and a chest of drawers, and on the chest of\ndrawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a\nparasol, taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a\nhoop. The tray was kept from tumbling down, by a bible; and the tray, if\nit had tumbled down, would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers\nand a teapot that were grouped around the book. On the walls there were\nsome common colored pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture subjects;\nsuch as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without seeing\nthe whole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view.\nAbraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow\ncast into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over\nthe little mantel-shelf, was a picture of the Sarah Jane lugger, built\nat Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it; a work of\nart, combining composition with carpentery, which I considered to be one\nof the most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There were\nsome hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not\ndivine then; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort,\nwhich served for seats and eked out the chairs.\n\nAll this, I saw in the first glance after I crossed the\nthreshold--childlike, according to my theory--and then Peggotty\nopened a little door and showed me my bedroom. It was the completest\nand most desirable bedroom ever seen--in the stern of the vessel;\nwith a little window, where the rudder used to go through; a little\nlooking-glass, just the right height for me, nailed against the wall,\nand framed with oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room\nenough to get into; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the\ntable. The walls were whitewashed as white as milk, and the patchwork\ncounterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness. One thing I\nparticularly noticed in this delightful house, was the smell of fish;\nwhich was so searching, that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief\nto wipe my nose, I found it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a\nlobster. On my imparting this discovery in confidence to Peggotty, she\ninformed me that her brother dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish;\nand I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures, in a state\nof wonderful conglomeration with one another, and never leaving off\npinching whatever they laid hold of, were usually to be found in a\nlittle wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept.\n\nWe were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom I had seen\ncurtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back, about a quarter of a\nmile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little girl (or I thought her so)\nwith a necklace of blue beads on, who wouldn't let me kiss her when I\noffered to, but ran away and hid herself. By and by, when we had dined\nin a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs, melted butter, and potatoes, with\na chop for me, a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home. As\nhe called Peggotty \"Lass,\" and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I\nhad no doubt, from the general propriety of her conduct, that he was her\nbrother; and so he turned out--being presently introduced to me as Mr.\nPeggotty, the master of the house.\n\n\"Glad to see you, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"You'll find us rough, sir,\nbut you'll find us ready.\"\n\n  [Illustration: I am hospitably received by Mr. Peggotty.]\n\nI thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a\ndelightful place.\n\n\"How's your Ma, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Did you leave her pretty\njolly?\"\n\nI gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could wish,\nand that she desired her compliments--which was a polite fiction on my\npart.\n\n\"I'm much obleeged to her, I'm sure,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Well sir, if\nyou can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her,\" nodding at his\nsister, \"and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your company.\"\n\nHaving done the honors of his house in this hospitable manner, Mr.\nPeggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water,\nremarking that \"cold would never get _his_ muck off.\" He soon returned,\ngreatly improved in appearance; but so rubicund, that I couldn't help\nthinking his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, and\ncrawfish,--that it went into the hot water very black, and came out\nvery red.\n\nAfter tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights\nbeing cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat\nthat the imagination of man could conceive. To hear the wind getting up\nout at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat\noutside, and to look at the fire, and think that there was no house near\nbut this one, and this one a boat, was like enchantment. Little Em'ly\nhad overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and\nleast of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just\nfitted into the chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was\nknitting on the opposite side of the fire. Peggotty at her needle-work\nwas as much at home with Saint Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if\nthey had never known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me my\nfirst lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling\nfortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of\nhis thumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe.\nI felt it was a time for conversation and confidence.\n\n\"Mr. Peggotty!\" says I.\n\n\"Sir,\" says he.\n\n\"Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort of\nark?\"\n\nMr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered:\n\n\"No, sir. I never giv him no name.\"\n\n\"Who gave him that name, then?\" said I, putting question number two of\nthe catechism to Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Why, sir, his father giv it him,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"I thought you were his father!\"\n\n\"My brother Joe was _his_ father,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Dead, Mr. Peggotty?\" I hinted, after a respectful pause.\n\n\"Drowndead,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\nI was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father, and\nbegan to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody\nelse there. I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it\nout with Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Little Em'ly,\" I said, glancing at her. \"She is your daughter, isn't\nshe, Mr. Peggotty?\"\n\n\"No, sir. My brother in law, Tom, was _her_ father.\"\n\nI couldn't help it. \"--Dead, Mr. Peggotty?\" I hinted, after another\nrespectful silence.\n\n\"Drowndead,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\nI felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the\nbottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So I said:\n\n\"Haven't you _any_ children, Mr. Peggotty?\"\n\n\"No, master,\" he answered with a short laugh. \"I'm a bacheldore.\"\n\n\"A bachelor!\" I said, astonished. \"Why, who's that, Mr. Peggotty?\"\npointing to the person in the apron who was knitting.\n\n\"That's Missis Gummidge,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?\"\n\nBut at this point Peggotty--I mean my own peculiar Peggotty--made such\nimpressive motions to me not to ask any more questions, that I could\nonly sit and look at all the silent company, until it was time to go to\nbed. Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin, she informed me that\nHam and Em'ly were an orphan nephew and niece, whom my host had at\ndifferent times adopted in their childhood, when they were left\ndestitute; and that Mrs. Gummidge was the widow of his partner in a\nboat, who had died very poor. He was but a poor man himself, said\nPeggotty, but as good as gold and as true as steel--those were her\nsimilies. The only subject, she informed me, on which he ever showed a\nviolent temper or swore an oath, was this generosity of his; and if it\nwere ever referred to, by any one of them, he struck the table a heavy\nblow with his right hand (had split it on one such occasion), and swore\na dreadful oath that he would be 'Gormed' if he didn't cut and run for\ngood, if it was ever mentioned again. It appeared, in answer to my\ninquiries, that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this\nterrible verb passive to be gormed; but that they all regarded it as\nconstituting a most solemn imprecation.\n\nI was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the\nwomen's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite\nend of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for\nthemselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious\nstate of mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. As slumber gradually stole\nupon me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the\nflat so fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep\nrising in the night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after\nall; and that a man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on\nboard if anything did happen.\n\nNothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it\nshone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out\nwith little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach.\n\n\"You're quite a sailor, I suppose?\" I said to Em'ly. I don't know that I\nsupposed any thing of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to say\nsomething; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little\nimage of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my\nhead to say this.\n\n\"No,\" replied Em'ly, shaking her head, \"I'm afraid of the sea.\"\n\n\"Afraid!\" I said, with a becoming air of boldness, and looking very big\nat the mighty ocean. \"_I_ a'nt!\"\n\n\"Ah! but it's cruel,\" said Em'ly. \"I have seen it very cruel to some of\nour men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces.\"\n\n\"I hope it wasn't the boat that----\"\n\n\"That father was drownded in?\" said Em'ly. \"No. Not that one, I never\nsee that boat.\"\n\n\"Nor him?\" I asked her.\n\nLittle Em'ly shook her head. \"Not to remember!\"\n\nHere was a coincidence! I immediately went into an explanation how I had\nnever seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always lived by\nourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and\nalways meant to live so; and how my father's grave was in the churchyard\nnear our house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I had\nwalked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning. But there were\nsome differences between Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it appeared. She\nhad lost her mother before her father; and where her father's grave was\nno one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, \"your\nfather was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father was a\nfisherman and my mother was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle Dan is\na fisherman.\"\n\n\"Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he?\" said I.\n\n\"Uncle Dan--yonder,\" answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house.\n\n\"Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think?\"\n\n\"Good?\" said Em'ly. \"If I was ever to be a lady, I'd give him a sky-blue\ncoat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a\ncocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money.\"\n\nI said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures. I\nmust acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his\nease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and\nthat I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat; but I\nkept these sentiments to myself.\n\nLittle Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of\nthese articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again,\npicking up shells and pebbles.\n\n\"You would like to be a lady?\" I said.\n\nEmily looked at me, and laughed and nodded \"yes.\"\n\n\"I should like it very much. We would all be gentlefolks together, then.\nMe, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't mind then, when\nthere come stormy weather.--Not for our own sakes, I mean. We would for\nthe poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we'd help 'em with money when they\ncome to any hurt.\"\n\nThis seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all\nimprobable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it,\nand little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,\n\n\"Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now?\"\n\nIt was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen a\nmoderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my heels,\nwith an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I said\n\"No,\" and I added, \"You don't seem to be, either, though you say you\nare;\"--for she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old\njetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon, and I was afraid of her\nfalling over.\n\n\"I'm not afraid in this way,\" said little Em'ly. \"But I wake when it\nblows, and tremble to think of uncle Dan and Ham, and believe I hear 'em\ncrying out for help. That's why I should like so much to be a lady. But\nI'm not afraid in this way. Not a bit. Look here!\"\n\nShe started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which protruded\nfrom the place we stood upon, and overhung the deep water at some\nheight, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed on my\nremembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form here, I\ndaresay, accurately as it was that day, and little Em'ly springing\nforward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), with a look that I\nhave never forgotten, directed far out to sea.\n\nThe light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to\nme, and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered;\nfruitlessly in any case, for there was no one near. But there have been\ntimes since, in my manhood, many times there have been, when I have\nthought, Is it possible, among the possibilities of hidden things, that\nin the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there\nwas any merciful attraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards\nhim permitted on the part of her dead father, that her life might have a\nchance of ending that day. There has been a time since when I have\nwondered whether, if the life before her could have been revealed to me\nat a glance, and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it,\nand if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I\nought to have held it up to save her. There has been a time since--I do\nnot say it lasted long, but it has been--when I have asked myself the\nquestion, would it have been better for little Em'ly to have had the\nwaters close above her head that morning in my sight; and when I have\nanswered Yes, it would have been.\n\nThis may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. But let it\nstand.\n\nWe strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that we\nthought curious, and put some stranded star-fish carefully back into\nthe water--I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite\ncertain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so, or\nthe reverse--and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty's dwelling. We\nstopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to exchange an innocent\nkiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure.\n\n\"Like two young mavishes,\" Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant, in our\nlocal dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a compliment.\n\nOf course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure I loved that baby\nquite as truly, quite as tenderly, with greater purity, and more\ndisinterestedness, than can enter into the best love of a later time of\nlife, high and ennobling as it is. I am sure my fancy raised up\nsomething round that blue-eyed mite of a child, which etherealised, and\nmade a very angel of her. If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread a\nlittle pair of wings and flown away before my eyes, I don't think I\nshould have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect.\n\nWe used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving manner,\nhours and hours. The days sported by us, as if Time had not grown up\nhimself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. I told Em'ly I\nadored her, and that unless she confessed she adored me I should be\nreduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword. She said she\ndid, and I have no doubt she did.\n\nAs to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty in\nour way, little Em'ly and I had no such trouble, because we had no\nfuture. We made no more provision for growing older, than we did for\ngrowing younger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty,\nwho used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little\nlocker side by side, \"Lor! wasn't it beautiful!\" Mr. Peggotty smiled at\nus from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing\nelse. They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose, that\nthey might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the Colosseum.\n\nI soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so\nagreeable as she might have been expected to do, under the circumstances\nof her residence with Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was rather a fretful\ndisposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for\nother parties in so small an establishment. I was very sorry for her;\nbut there were moments when it would have been more agreeable, I\nthought, if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to\nretire to, and had stopped there until her spirits revived.\n\nMr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public house called The Willing\nMind. I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third evening\nof our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge's looking up at the dutch clock,\nbetween eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, what was\nmore, she had known in the morning he would go there.\n\nMrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day, and had burst into tears\nin the forenoon, when the fire smoked. \"I am a lone lorn creetur',\" were\nMrs. Gummidge's words, when that unpleasant occurrence took place, \"and\neverythink goes contrairy with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll soon leave off,\" said Peggotty--I again mean our\nPeggotty--\"and besides, you know, it's not more disagreeable to you than\nto us.\"\n\n\"I feel it more,\" said Mrs. Gummidge.\n\nIt was a very cold day, with cutting blasts of wind. Mrs. Gummidge's\npeculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and\nsnuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but it\ndidn't suit her that day at all. She was constantly complaining of the\ncold, and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called\n\"the creeps.\" At last she shed tears on that subject, and said again\nthat she was \"a lone lorn creetur' and everythink went contrairy with\nher.\"\n\n\"It is certainly very cold,\" said Peggotty. \"Everybody must feel it so.\"\n\n\"I feel it more than other people,\" said Mrs. Gummidge.\n\nSo at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately after me,\nto whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction. The fish\nwere small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. We all\nacknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; but Mrs.\nGummidge said she felt it more than we did, and shed tears again, and\nmade that former declaration with great bitterness.\n\nAccordingly, when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock, this\nunfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner in a very wretched\nand miserable condition. Peggotty had been working cheerfully. Ham had\nbeen patching up a great pair of water-boots; and I, with little Em'ly\nby my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never made any\nother remark than a forlorn sigh, and had never raised her eyes since\ntea.\n\n\"Well, Mates,\" said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, \"and how are you?\"\n\nWe all said something, or looked something, to welcome him, except Mrs.\nGummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting.\n\n\"What's amiss,\" said Mr. Peggotty, with a clap of his hands. \"Cheer up,\nold Mawther!\" (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.)\n\nMrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took out an old\nblack silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but instead of putting it in\nher pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out,\nready for use.\n\n\"What's amiss, dame!\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Nothing,\" returned Mrs. Gummidge. \"You've come from The Willing Mind,\nDan'l?\"\n\n\"Why yes, I've took a short spell at The Willing Mind to-night,\" said\nMr. Peggotty.\n\n\"I'm sorry I should drive you there,\" said Mrs. Gummidge.\n\n\"Drive! I don't want no driving,\" returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest\nlaugh. \"I only go too ready.\"\n\n\"Very ready,\" said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her eyes.\n\"Yes, yes, very ready. I am sorry it should be along of me that you're\nso ready.\"\n\n\"Along o' you? It an't along o' you!\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Don't ye\nbelieve a bit on it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is,\" cried Mrs. Gummidge. \"I know what I am. I know that\nI'm a lone lorn creetur, and not only that everythink goes contrairy\nwith me, but that I go contrairy with everybody. Yes, yes. I feel more\nthan other people do, and I show it more. It's my misfortun'.\"\n\nI really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the\nmisfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs.\nGummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only answering with\nanother entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up.\n\n\"I an't what I could wish myself to be,\" said Mrs. Gummidge. \"I am far\nfrom it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrairy. I feel my\ntroubles, and they make me contrairy. I wish I didn't feel 'em, but I\ndo. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I make the house\nuncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your sister so all day,\nand Master Davy.\"\n\nHere I was suddenly melted, and roared out \"No, you haven't, Mrs.\nGummidge,\" in great mental distress.\n\n\"It's far from right that I should do it,\" said Mrs. Gummidge. \"It an't\na fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I am a lone lorn\ncreetur, and had much better not make myself contrairy here. If thinks\nmust go contrairy with me, and I must go contrairy myself, let me go\ncontrairy in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into the house, and die and\nbe a riddance!\"\n\nMrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed. When\nshe was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling\nbut the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, and nodding his head\nwith a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face,\nsaid in a whisper:\n\n\"She's been thinking of the old 'un!\"\n\nI did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed to\nhave fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me to bed, explained\nthat it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that her brother always took that\nfor a received truth on such occasions, and that it always had a moving\neffect upon him. Some time after he was in his hammock that night, I\nheard him myself repeat to Ham, \"Poor thing! She's been thinking of the\nold 'un!\" And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner\nduring the remainder of our stay (which happened some few times), he\nalways said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance, and\nalways with the tenderest commiseration.\n\nSo the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of\nthe tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in,\nand altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed, he\nsometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships, and once or\ntwice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of\nimpressions should be more particularly associated with a place than\nanother, though I believe this obtains with most people, in reference\nespecially to the associations of their childhood. I never hear the\nname, or read the name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain\nSunday morning on the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly\nleaning on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and\nthe sun, away at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing\nus the ships, like their own shadows.\n\nAt last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation\nfrom Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving\nlittle Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where\nthe carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write to her. (I\nredeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger than those in\nwhich apartments are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let).\nWe were greatly overcome at parting; and if ever, in my life, I have had\na void made in my heart, I had one made that day.\n\nNow, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my\nhome again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no\nsooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed to\npoint that way with a steady finger; and I felt, all the more for the\nsinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that my mother was my\ncomforter and friend.\n\nThis gained upon me as we went along; so that the nearer we drew, and\nthe more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more excited I\nwas to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty, instead of\nsharing in these transports, tried to check them (though very kindly),\nand looked confused and out of sorts.\n\nBlunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the\ncarrier's horse pleased--and did. How well I recollect it, on a cold\ngrey afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain!\n\nThe door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my\npleasant agitation, for my mother. It was not she, but a strange\nservant.\n\n\"Why, Peggotty!\" I said, ruefully, \"isn't she come home!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Master Davy,\" said Peggotty. \"She's come home. Wait a bit,\nMaster Davy, and I'll--I'll tell you something.\"\n\nBetween her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the\ncart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself, but I\nfelt too blank and strange to tell her so. When she had got down, she\ntook me by the hand; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the\ndoor.\n\n\"Peggotty!\" said I, quite frightened. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master Davy dear!\" she answered,\nassuming an air of sprightliness.\n\n\"Something's the matter, I'm sure. Where's mama?\"\n\n\"Where's mama, Master Davy?\" repeated Peggotty.\n\n\"Yes. Why hasn't she come out to the gate, and what have we come in here\nfor? Oh, Peggotty!\" My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were going to\ntumble down.\n\n\"Bless the precious boy!\" cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. \"What is\nit? Speak, my pet!\"\n\n\"Not dead, too! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty?\"\n\nPeggotty cried out No! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then sat\ndown, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn.\n\nI gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn in\nthe right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in\nanxious inquiry.\n\n\"You see, dear, I should have told you before now,\" said Peggotty, \"but\nI hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, but I\ncouldn't azackly\"--that was always the substitute for exactly, in\nPeggotty's militia of words--\"bring my mind to it.\"\n\n\"Go on, Peggotty,\" said I, more frightened than before.\n\n\"Master Davy,\" said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking hand,\nand speaking in a breathless sort of way. \"What do you think? You have\ngot a Pa!\"\n\nI trembled, and turned white. Something--I don't know what, or\nhow--connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the\ndead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind.\n\n\"A new one,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"A new one?\" I repeated.\n\nPeggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that was very\nhard, and, putting out her hand, said:\n\n\"Come and see him.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see him.\"\n\n--\"And your mamma,\" said Peggotty.\n\nI ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlor, where\nshe left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the other, Mr.\nMurdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but timidly\nI thought.\n\n\"Now, Clara my dear,\" said Mr. Murdstone. \"Recollect! controul yourself,\nalways controul yourself! Davy boy, how do you do?\"\n\nI gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed my\nmother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down\nagain to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him, I\nknew quite well that he was looking at us both; and I turned to the\nwindow and looked out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their\nheads in the cold.\n\nAs soon as I could creep away, I crept up-stairs. My old dear bedroom\nwas changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled down-stairs\nto find anything that was like itself, so altered it all seemed; and\nroamed into the yard. I very soon started back from there, for the\nempty dog-kennel was filled up with a great dog--deep mouthed and\nblack-haired like Him--and he was very angry at the sight of me, and\nsprung out to get at me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nI FALL INTO DISGRACE.\n\n\nIf the room to which my bed was removed, were a sentient thing that\ncould give evidence, I might appeal to it at this day--who sleeps there\nnow, I wonder!--to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to\nit. I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the\nway while I climbed the stairs; and, looking as blank and strange upon\nthe room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands\ncrossed, and thought.\n\nI thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of the\ncracks in the ceiling, of the paper on the wall, of the flaws in\nthe window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of\nthe washing-stand being ricketty on its three legs, and having a\ndiscontented something about it, which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge\nunder the influence of the old one. I was crying all the time, but,\nexcept that I was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure I\nnever thought why I cried. At last in my desolation I began to consider\nthat I was dreadfully in love with little Em'ly, and had been torn away\nfrom her to come here where no one seemed to want me, or to care about\nme, half as much as she did. This made such a very miserable piece of\nbusiness of it, that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane,\nand cried myself to sleep.\n\nI was awoke by somebody saying \"Here he is!\" and uncovering my hot head.\nMy mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was one of them\nwho had done it.\n\n\"Davy,\" said my mother. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nI thought it very strange that she should ask me, and answered,\n\"Nothing.\" I turned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling\nlip, which answered her with greater truth.\n\n\"Davy,\" said my mother. \"Davy, my child!\"\n\nI dare say no words she could have uttered, would have affected me so\nmuch, then, as her calling me her child. I hid my tears in the\nbedclothes, and pressed her from me with my hand, when she would have\nraised me up.\n\n\"This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!\" said my mother. \"I have\nno doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I\nwonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is\ndear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty?\"\n\nPoor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, in a sort\nof paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, \"Lord\nforgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what you have said this minute,\nmay you never be truly sorry!\"\n\n\"It's enough to distract me,\" cried my mother. \"In my honeymoon, too,\nwhen my most inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, and not\nenvy me a little peace of mind and happiness. Davy, you naughty boy!\nPeggotty, you savage creature! Oh, dear me!\" cried my mother, turning\nfrom one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful manner, \"what a\ntroublesome world this is, when one has the most right to expect it to\nbe as agreeable as possible!\"\n\nI felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither her's nor Peggotty's,\nand slipped to my feet at the bed-side. It was Mr. Murdstone's hand, and\nhe kept it on my arm as he said:\n\n\"What's this? Clara, my love, have you forgotten?--Firmness, my dear!\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, Edward,\" said my mother. \"I meant to be very good, but\nI am so uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" he answered. \"That's a bad hearing, so soon, Clara.\"\n\n\"I say it's very hard I should be made so now,\" returned my mother,\npouting; \"and it is--very hard--isn't it?\"\n\nHe drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her. I knew as\nwell, when I saw my mother's head lean down upon his shoulder, and her\narm touch his neck--I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature\ninto any form he chose, as I know, now, that he did it.\n\n\"Go you below, my love,\" said Mr. Murdstone. \"David and I will come\ndown, together. My friend,\" turning a darkening face on Peggotty, when\nhe had watched my mother out, and dismissed her with a nod and a smile:\n\"do you know your mistress's name?\"\n\n\"She has been my mistress a long time, sir,\" answered Peggotty. \"I ought\nto it.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" he answered. \"But I thought I heard you, as I came\nup-stairs, address her by a name that is not hers. She has taken mine,\nyou know. Will you remember that?\"\n\nPeggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the\nroom without replying; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go,\nand had no excuse for remaining. When we two were left alone, he shut\nthe door, and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing before him,\nlooked steadily into my eyes. I felt my own attracted, no less steadily,\nto his. As I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again\nto hear my heart beat fast and high.\n\n\"David,\" he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together, \"if I\nhave an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think I do?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I beat him.\"\n\nI had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in my\nsilence, that my breath was shorter now.\n\n\"I make him wince, and smart. I say to myself, 'I'll conquer that\nfellow;' and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I should do\nit. What is that upon your face?\"\n\n\"Dirt,\" I said.\n\nHe knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had asked the\nquestion twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I believe my baby\nheart would have burst before I would have told him so.\n\n\"You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow,\" he said,\nwith a grave smile that belonged to him, \"and you understood me very\nwell, I see. Wash that face, sir, and come down with me.\"\n\nHe pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like Mrs.\nGummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I had\nlittle doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would have knocked\nme down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated.\n\n\"Clara, my dear,\" he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked me\ninto the parlor, with his hand still on my arm; \"you will not be made\nuncomfortable any more, I hope. We shall soon improve our youthful\nhumours.\"\n\nGod help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I might have\nbeen made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that\nseason. A word of encouragement and explanation, of pity for my childish\nignorance, of welcome home, of reassurance to me that it _was_ home,\nmight have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth, instead of in\nmy hypocritical outside, and might have made me respect instead of hate\nhim. I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so\nscared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a chair, she\nfollowed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still--missing, perhaps, some\nfreedom in my childish tread--but the word was not spoken, and the time\nfor it was gone.\n\nWe dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond of my\nmother--I am afraid I liked him none the better for that--and she was\nvery fond of him. I gathered from what they said, that an elder sister\nof his was coming to stay with them, and that she was expected that\nevening. I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards,\nthat, without being actively concerned in any business, he had some\nshare in, or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant's\nhouse in London, with which his family had been connected from his\ngreat-grandfather's time, and in which his sister had a similar\ninterest; but I may mention it in this place, whether or no.\n\nAfter dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating\nan escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away,\nlest it should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up to\nthe garden-gate, and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother\nfollowed him. I was timidly following her, when she turned round at the\nparlor-door, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as she had been\nused to do, whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him.\nShe did this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly;\nand, putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came\nnear to where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and\ndrew her's through his arm.\n\nIt was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady she\nwas; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face and\nvoice; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose,\nas if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers,\nshe had carried them to that account. She brought with her, two\nuncompromising hard black boxes, with her initials on the lids in hard\nbrass nails. When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard\nsteel purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung\nupon her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite. I had never, at\nthat time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.\n\nShe was brought into the parlor with many tokens of welcome, and there\nformally recognised my mother as a new and near relation. Then she\nlooked at me, and said:\n\n\"Is that your boy, sister-in-law?\"\n\nMy mother acknowledged me.\n\n\"Generally speaking,\" said Miss Murdstone, \"I don't like boys. How d' ye\ndo, boy?\"\n\nUnder these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well,\nand that I hoped she was the same; with such an indifferent grace, that\nMiss Murdstone disposed of me in two words:\n\n\"Wants manner!\"\n\nHaving uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favor of\nbeing shewn to her room, which became to me from that time forth a place\nof awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or\nknown to be left unlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when\nshe was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss\nMurdstone embellished herself when she was dressed, generally hung upon\nthe looking-glass in formidable array.\n\nAs well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no\nintention of ever going again. She began to \"help\" my mother next\nmorning, and was in and out of the store-closet all day, putting things\nto rights, and making havoc in the old arrangements. Almost the first\nremarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was, her being constantly\nhaunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere\non the premises. Under the influence of this delusion, she dived into\nthe coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever opened\nthe door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief\nthat she had got him.\n\nThough there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a\nperfect Lark in point of getting up. She was up (and, as I believe to\nthis hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the house was\nstirring. Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one\neye open; but I could not concur in this idea; for I tried it myself\nafter hearing the suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.\n\nOn the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her\nbell at cock-crow. When my mother came down to breakfast and was going\nto make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek,\nwhich was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said:\n\n\"Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you of all\nthe trouble I can. You're much too pretty and thoughtless\"--my mother\nblushed but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this character--\"to have\nany duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me. If you'll be\nso good as give me your keys, my dear, I'll attend to all this sort of\nthing in future.\"\n\nFrom that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all\nday, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do\nwith them than I had.\n\nMy mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow\nof protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing certain\nhousehold plans to her brother, of which he signified his approbation,\nmy mother suddenly began to cry, and said she thought she might have\nbeen consulted.\n\n\"Clara!\" said Mr. Murdstone sternly. \"Clara! I wonder at you.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward!\" cried my mother, \"and\nit's very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't like it\nyourself.\"\n\nFirmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and\nMiss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed my\ncomprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, I\nnevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was another\nname for tyranny; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil's humour,\nthat was in them both. The creed, as I should state it now, was this.\nMr. Murdstone was firm; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr.\nMurdstone; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody\nwas to be bent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception. She\nmight be firm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior and\ntributary degree. My mother was another exception. She might be firm,\nand must be; but only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing\nthere was no other firmness upon earth.\n\n\"It's very hard,\" said my mother, \"that in my own house--\"\n\n\"_My_ own house?\" repeated Mr. Murdstone. \"Clara!\"\n\n\"_Our_ own house, I mean,\" faltered my mother, evidently frightened--\"I\nhope you must know what I mean, Edward--it's very hard that in _your_\nown house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters. I am sure\nI managed very well before we were married. There's evidence,\" said my\nmother, sobbing; \"ask Peggotty if I didn't do very well when I wasn't\ninterfered with!\"\n\n\"Edward,\" said Miss Murdstone, \"let there be an end of this. I go\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Jane Murdstone,\" said her brother, \"be silent! How dare you to\ninsinuate that you don't know my character better than your words\nimply?\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" my poor mother went on, at a grievous disadvantage, and\nwith many tears, \"I don't want anybody to go. I should be very miserable\nand unhappy if anybody was to go. I don't ask much. I am not\nunreasonable. I only want to be consulted sometimes. I am very much\nobliged to anybody who assists me, and I only want to be consulted as a\nmere form, sometimes. I thought you were pleased, once, with my being a\nlittle inexperienced and girlish, Edward--I am sure you said so--but you\nseem to hate me for it now, you are so severe.\"\n\n\"Edward,\" said Miss Murdstone, again, \"let there be an end of this. I go\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Jane Murdstone,\" thundered Mr. Murdstone. \"Will you be silent? How dare\nyou?\"\n\nMiss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, and held\nit before her eyes.\n\n\"Clara,\" he continued, looking at my mother, \"you surprise me! You\nastound me! Yes, I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an\ninexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, and\ninfusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it\nstood in need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my\nassistance in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition\nsomething like a housekeeper's, and when she meets with a base return--\"\n\n\"Oh, pray, pray, Edward,\" cried my mother, \"don't accuse me of being\nungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. No one ever said I was,\nbefore. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear!\"\n\n\"When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,\" he went on, after waiting until my\nmother was silent, \"with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled\nand altered.\"\n\n\"Don't, my love, say that!\" implored my mother, very piteously. \"Oh,\ndon't, Edward! I can't bear to hear it. Whatever I am, I am\naffectionate. I know I am affectionate. I wouldn't say it, if I wasn't\ncertain that I am. Ask Peggotty. I am sure she'll tell you I'm\naffectionate.\"\n\n\"There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara,\" said Mr. Murdstone in\nreply, \"that can have the least weight with me. You lose breath.\"\n\n\"Pray let us be friends,\" said my mother, \"I couldn't live under\ncoldness or unkindness. I am so sorry. I have a great many defects, I\nknow, and it's very good of you, Edward, with your strength of mind, to\nendeavour to correct them for me. Jane, I don't object to anything. I\nshould be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving--\" My mother\nwas too much overcome to go on.\n\n\"Jane Murdstone,\" said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, \"any harsh words\nbetween us are, I hope, uncommon. It is not my fault that so unusual an\noccurrence has taken place to-night. I was betrayed into it by another.\nNor is it your fault. You were betrayed into it by another. Let us both\ntry to forget it. And as this,\" he added, after these magnanimous words,\n\"is not a fit scene for the boy--David, go to bed!\"\n\nI could hardly find the door, through the tears that stood in my eyes. I\nwas so sorry for my mother's distress; but I groped my way out, and\ngroped my way up to my room in the dark, without even having the heart\nto say good night to Peggotty, or to get a candle from her. When her\ncoming up to look for me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me, she said\nthat my mother had gone to bed poorly, and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone\nwere sitting alone.\n\nGoing down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside the\nparlor-door, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly and\nhumbly entreating Miss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted, and\na perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew my mother afterwards\nto give an opinion on any matter, without first appealing to Miss\nMurdstone, or without having first ascertained, by some sure means, what\nMiss Murdstone's opinion was; and I never saw Miss Murdstone, when out\nof temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards her bag as if\nshe were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my\nmother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright.\n\nThe gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the Murdstone\nreligion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought, since, that\nits assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr.\nMurdstone's firmness, which wouldn't allow him to let any body off from\nthe utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse\nfor. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with\nwhich we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again,\nthe dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first, like\na guarded captive brought to a condemned service. Again, Miss Murdstone,\nin a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made out of a pall,\nfollows close upon me; then my mother; then her husband. There is no\nPeggotty now, as in the old time. Again, I listen to Miss Murdstone\nmumbling the responses, and emphasising all the dread words with a cruel\nrelish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says\n\"miserable sinners,\" as if she were calling all the congregation names.\nAgain, I catch rare glimpses of my mother, moving her lips timidly\nbetween the two, with one of them muttering at each ear like low\nthunder. Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that\nour good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone right,\nand that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels. Again, if I\nmove a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone pokes me with\nher prayer-book, and makes my side ache.\n\nYes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my\nmother, and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on arm-in-arm,\nand I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder if\nmy mother's step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the\ngaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder\nwhether any of the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to walk\nhome together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the\ndreary dismal day.\n\nThere had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school.\nMr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had of course\nagreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the subject yet. In\nthe meantime, I learnt lessons at home.\n\nShall I ever forget those lessons! They were presided over nominally\nby my mother, but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were\nalways present, and found them a favourable occasion for giving my\nmother lessons in that miscalled firmness, which was the bane of both\nour lives. I believe I was kept at home, for that purpose. I had been\napt enough to learn, and willing enough, when my mother and I had\nlived alone together. I can faintly remember learning the alphabet at\nher knee. To this day, when I look upon the fat black letters in the\nprimer, the puzzling novelty of their shapes, and the easy good-nature\nof O and Q and S, seem to present themselves again before me as they\nused to do. But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance. On\nthe contrary, I seem to have walked along a path of flowers as far\nas the crocodile-book, and to have been cheered by the gentleness of\nmy mother's voice and manner all the way. But these solemn lessons\nwhich succeeded those, I remember as the death-blow at my peace, and a\ngrievous daily drudgery and misery. They were very long, very numerous,\nvery hard--perfectly unintelligible, some of them, to me--and I was\ngenerally as much bewildered by them as I believe my poor mother was\nherself.\n\nLet me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back again.\n\nI come into the second-best parlor after breakfast, with my books,\nand an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her\nwriting-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair\nby the window (though he pretends to be reading a book), or as Miss\nMurdstone, sitting near my mother stringing steel beads. The very sight\nof these two has such an influence over me, that I begin to feel the\nwords I have been at infinite pains to get into my head, all sliding\naway, and going I don't know where. I wonder where they _do_ go,\nby-the-by?\n\nI hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps a\nhistory, or geography. I take a last drowning look at the page as I give\nit into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have got\nit fresh. I trip over a word. Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip over\nanother word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, tumble over\nhalf-a-dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would show me the book\nif she dared, but she does not dare, and she says softly:\n\n\"Oh, Davy, Davy!\"\n\n\"Now, Clara,\" says Mr. Murdstone, \"be firm with the boy. Don't say 'Oh,\nDavy, Davy!' That's childish. He knows his lesson, or he does not know\nit.\"\n\n\"He does _not_ know it,\" Miss Murdstone interposes awfully.\n\n\"I am really afraid he does not,\" says my mother.\n\n\"Then you see, Clara,\" returns Miss Murdstone, \"you should just give him\nthe book back, and make him know it.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" says my mother; \"that is what I intend to do, my dear\nJane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don't be stupid.\"\n\nI obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am\nnot so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down\nbefore I get to the old place, at a point where I was all right before,\nand stop to think. But I can't think about the lesson. I think of the\nnumber of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of the price of Mr.\nMurdstone's dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I have no\nbusiness with, and don't want to have anything at all to do with. Mr.\nMurdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been expecting for\na long time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother glances\nsubmissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to be\nworked out when my other tasks are done.\n\nThere is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling\nsnowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid _I_ get. The case is so\nhopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that\nI give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The\ndespairing way in which my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder\non, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect in these miserable\nlessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries to\ngive me the cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss\nMurdstone, who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says\nin a deep warning voice:\n\n\"Clara!\"\n\nMy mother starts, colors, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes out of\nhis chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with it, and\nturns me out of the room by the shoulders.\n\nEven when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in the shape\nof an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered to me orally\nby Mr. Murdstone, and begins, \"If I go into a cheesemonger's shop, and\nbuy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each,\npresent payment\"--at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed. I\npore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until\ndinner-time; when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt\nof the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice of bread to help\nme out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace for the rest of\nthe evening.\n\nIt seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies\ngenerally took this course. I could have done very well if I had been\nwithout the Murdstones; but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was\nlike the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird. Even when I\ndid get through the morning with tolerable credit, there was not much\ngained but dinner; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me\nuntasked, and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed, called her\nbrother's attention to me by saying, \"Clara, my dear, there's nothing\nlike work--give your boy an exercise;\" which caused me to be clapped\ndown to some new labor, there and then. As to any recreation with other\nchildren of my age, I had very little of that; for the gloomy theology\nof the Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers\n(though there _was_ a child once set in the midst of the Disciples), and\nheld that they contaminated one another.\n\nThe natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for some six\nmonths or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. I was not made\nthe less so, by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and\nalienated from my mother. I believe I should have been almost stupified\nbut for one circumstance.\n\nIt was this. My father had left a small collection of books in a little\nroom up-stairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my own) and which\nnobody else in our house ever troubled. From that blessed little room,\nRoderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, The\nVicar of Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and Robinson Crusoe, came\nout, a glorious host, to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and\nmy hope of something beyond that place and time,--they, and the Arabian\nNights, and the Tales of the Genii,--and did me no harm; for whatever\nharm was in some of them was not there for me; _I_ knew nothing of it.\nIt is astonishing to me now, how I found time, in the midst of my\nporings and blunderings over heavier themes, to read those books as I\ndid. It is curious to me how I could ever have consoled myself under my\nsmall troubles (which were great troubles to me), by impersonating my\nfavorite characters in them--as I did--and by putting Mr. and Miss\nMurdstone into all the bad ones--which I did too. I have been Tom Jones\n(a child's Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a week together. I have\nsustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I\nverily believe. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and\nTravels--I forget what, now--that were on those shelves; and for days\nand days I can remember to have gone about my region of our house, armed\nwith the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees--the perfect\nrealisation of Captain Somebody, of the Royal British Navy, in danger of\nbeing beset by savages, and resolved to sell his life at a great price.\nThe Captain never lost dignity, from having his ears boxed with the\nLatin Grammar. I did; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero, in\ndespite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world, dead or\nalive.\n\nThis was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the\npicture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play\nin the churchyard, and I sitting on my bed, reading as if for life.\nEvery barn in the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every\nfoot of the churchyard, had some association of its own, in my mind,\nconnected with these books, and stood for some locality made famous in\nthem. I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple; I have\nwatched Strap, with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself\nupon the wicket-gate; and I _know_ that Commodore Trunnion held that\nclub with Mr. Pickle, in the parlor of our little village alehouse.\n\nThe reader now understands as well as I do, what I was when I came to\nthat point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again.\n\nOne morning when I went into the parlor with my books, I found my mother\nlooking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr. Murdstone binding\nsomething round the bottom of a cane--a lithe and limber cane, which he\nleft off binding when I came in, and poised and switched in the air.\n\n\"I tell you, Clara,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \"I have been often flogged\nmyself.\"\n\n\"To be sure; of course,\" said Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"Certainly, my dear Jane,\" faltered my mother, meekly. \"But--but do you\nthink it did Edward good?\"\n\n\"Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?\" asked Mr. Murdstone, gravely.\n\n\"That's the point!\" said his sister.\n\nTo this my mother returned, \"Certainly, my dear Jane,\" and said no more.\n\nI felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue,\nand sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.\n\n\"Now, David,\" he said--and I saw that cast again, as he said it--\"you\nmust be far more careful to-day than usual.\" He gave the cane another\npoise, and another switch; and having finished his preparation of it,\nlaid it down beside him, with an expressive look, and took up his book.\n\nThis was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. I felt\nthe words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line,\nbut by the entire page. I tried to lay hold of them; but they seemed, if\nI may so express it, to have put skates on, and to skim away from me\nwith a smoothness there was no checking.\n\nWe began badly, and went on worse. I had come in, with an idea of\ndistinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared;\nbut it turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after book was added to\nthe heap of failures, Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the\ntime. And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses (canes he\nmade it that day, I remember), my mother burst out crying.\n\n\"Clara!\" said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice.\n\n\"I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,\" said my mother.\n\nI saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, taking up\nthe cane:\n\n\"Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness,\nthe worry and torment that David has occasioned her to-day. That would\nbe stoical. Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, but we can\nhardly expect so much from her. David, you and I will go up-stairs,\nboy.\"\n\nAs he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss Murdstone\nsaid, \"Clara! are you a perfect fool?\" and interfered. I saw my mother\nstop her ears then, and I heard her crying.\n\nHe walked me up to my room slowly and gravely--I am certain he had a\ndelight in that formal parade of executing justice--and when we got\nthere, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.\n\n\"Mr. Murdstone! Sir!\" I cried to him. \"Don't! Pray don't beat me! I have\ntried to learn, sir, but I can't learn while you and Miss Murdstone are\nby. I can't indeed!\"\n\n\"Can't you, indeed, David?\" he said. \"We'll try that.\"\n\nHe had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and stopped\nhim for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. It was only for a\nmoment that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards,\nand in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my\nmouth, between my teeth, and bit it through. It sets my teeth on edge to\nthink of it.\n\nHe beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above all the\nnoise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out--I\nheard my mother crying out--and Peggotty. Then he was gone; and the door\nwas locked outside; and I was lying, fevered and hot, and torn, and\nsore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor.\n\nHow well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural stillness\nseemed to reign through the whole house! How well I remember, when my\nsmart and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel!\n\nI sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled\nup from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and\nugly, that it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and\nmade me cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I\nfelt. It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious\ncriminal, I dare say.\n\nIt had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (I had been lying,\nfor the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,\nand looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone\ncame in with some bread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon the\ntable without a word, glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness,\nand then retired, locking the door after her.\n\nLong after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else would\ncome. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed, and\nwent to bed; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be done\nto me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed? Whether I\nshould be taken into custody, and sent to prison? Whether I was at all\nin danger of being hanged?\n\nI never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and\nfresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale\nand dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared before I\nwas out of bed; told me, in so many words, that I was free to walk in\nthe garden for half an hour and no longer; and retired, leaving the door\nopen, that I might avail myself of that permission.\n\nI did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five\ndays. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone down on\nmy knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss\nMurdstone excepted, during the whole time--except at evening prayers in\nthe parlor; to which I was escorted by Miss Murdstone after everybody\nelse was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, all alone by\nmyself near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by my jailer,\nbefore anyone arose from the devotional posture. I only observed that my\nmother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept her face another\nway so that I never saw it; and that Mr. Murdstone's hand was bound up\nin a large linen wrapper.\n\nThe length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one. They\noccupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in which I listened\nto all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me;\nthe ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the murmuring\nof voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing, whistling, or\nsinging, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in\nmy solitude and disgrace--the uncertain pace of the hours, especially at\nnight, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and find that the\nfamily were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of night had\nyet to come--the depressed dreams and nightmares I had--the return of\nday, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the churchyard,\nand I watched them from a distance within the room, being ashamed to\nshow myself at the window lest they should know I was a prisoner--the\nstrange sensation of never hearing myself speak--the fleeting intervals\nof something like cheerfulness, which came with eating and drinking, and\nwent away with it--the setting in of rain one evening, with a fresh\nsmell, and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church,\nuntil it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom, and fear, and\nremorse--all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead\nof days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance.\n\nOn the last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own name\nspoken in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out my arms in the\ndark, said:\n\n\"Is that you, Peggotty?\"\n\nThere was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again, in a\ntone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone into\na fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the\nkeyhole.\n\nI groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,\nwhispered:\n\n\"Is that you, Peggotty, dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, my own precious Davy,\" she replied. \"Be as soft as a mouse, or the\nCat'll hear us.\"\n\nI understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the\nurgency of the case; her room being close by.\n\n\"How's mama, dear Peggotty? Is she very angry with me?\"\n\nI could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was\ndoing on mine, before she answered. \"No. Not very.\"\n\n\"What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear? Do you know?\"\n\n\"School. Near London,\" was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get her\nto repeat it, for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat, in\nconsequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the\nkeyhole and put my ear there; and though her words tickled me a good\ndeal, I didn't hear them.\n\n\"When, Peggotty?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\n\"Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my\ndrawers?\" which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Peggotty. \"Box.\"\n\n\"Shan't I see mama?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Peggotty. \"Morning.\"\n\nThen Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered these\nwords through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has\never been the medium of communicating, I will venture to assert:\nshooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of\nits own.\n\n\"Davy, dear. If I ain't ben azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I\nused to be. It ain't because I don't love you. Just as well and more, my\npretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for you. And for some\none else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening? Can you hear?\"\n\n\"Ye--ye--ye--yes, Peggotty!\" I sobbed.\n\n\"My own!\" said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. \"What I want to say,\nis. That you must never forget me. For I'll never forget you. And I'll\ntake as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took of you. And I won't\nleave her. The day may come when she'll be glad to lay her poor head. On\nher stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. And I'll write to you, my\ndear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I'll--I'll--\" Peggotty fell to\nkissing the keyhole, as she couldn't kiss me.\n\n\"Thank you, dear Peggotty!\" said I. \"Oh, thank you! Thank you! Will you\npromise me one thing, Peggotty? Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and\nlittle Em'ly and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham, that I am not so bad as they\nmight suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love--especially to little\nEm'ly? Will you, if you please, Peggotty?\"\n\nThe kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the\ngreatest affection--I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had\nbeen her honest face--and parted. From that night there grew up in my\nbreast, a feeling for Peggotty, which I cannot very well define. She did\nnot replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a vacancy\nin my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her something I\nhave never felt for any other human being. It was a sort of comical\naffection too; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should\nhave done, or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been\nto me.\n\nIn the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was going\nto school; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed. She\nalso informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come down-stairs into\nthe parlor, and have my breakfast. There, I found my mother, very pale\nand with red eyes: into whose arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my\nsuffering soul.\n\n\"Oh, Davy!\" she said. \"That you could hurt any one I love! Try to be\nbetter, pray to be better! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy,\nthat you should have such bad passions in your heart.\"\n\nThey had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more\nsorry for that, than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat\nmy parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter, and\ntrickled into my tea. I saw my mother look at me sometimes, and then\nglance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and then look down, or look away.\n\n\"Master Copperfield's box there!\" said Miss Murdstone, when wheels were\nheard at the gate.\n\nI looked for Peggotty, but it was not she; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone\nappeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door; the box\nwas taken out to his cart, and lifted in.\n\n\"Clara!\" said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.\n\n\"Ready, my dear Jane,\" returned my mother. \"Good bye, Davy. You are\ngoing for your own good. Good bye, my child. You will come home in the\nholidays, and be a better boy.\"\n\n\"Clara!\" Miss Murdstone repeated.\n\n\"Certainly, my dear Jane,\" replied my mother, who was holding me. \"I\nforgive you, my dear boy. God bless you!\"\n\n\"Clara!\" Miss Murdstone repeated.\n\nMiss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to say on\nthe way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad end; and\nthen I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nI AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME.\n\n\nWe might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was\nquite wet through, when the carrier stopped short.\n\nLooking out to ascertain what for, I saw, to my amazement, Peggotty\nburst from a hedge and climb into the cart. She took me in both her\narms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was\nextremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I\nfound it very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing\none of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought\nout some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a\npurse which she put into my hand, but not one word did she say. After\nanother and a final squeeze with both arms, she got down from the cart\nand ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, without a solitary\nbutton on her gown. I picked up one, of several that were rolling about,\nand treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.\n\nThe carrier looked at me, as if to enquire if she were coming back. I\nshook my head, and said I thought not. \"Then come up,\" said the carrier\nto the lazy horse; who came up accordingly.\n\nHaving by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think\nit was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random,\nnor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could\nremember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this\nresolution, proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon\nthe horse's back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly\nsmall it looked, under those circumstances.\n\nI had now leisure to examine the purse. It was a stiff leather purse,\nwith a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had\nevidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But its\nmost precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit of\npaper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, \"For Davy. With my\nlove.\" I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good\nas reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thought I had\nbetter do without it; and I thought I really had; so I wiped my eyes on\nmy sleeve and stopped myself.\n\nFor good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was\nstill occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for\nsome little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.\n\n\"All the way where?\" enquired the carrier.\n\n\"There,\" I said.\n\n\"Where's there?\" enquired the carrier.\n\n\"Near London?\" I said.\n\n\"Why that horse,\" said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out,\n\"would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.\"\n\n\"Are you only going to Yarmouth then?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's about it,\" said the carrier. \"And there I shall take you to the\nstage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that'll take you to--wherever it is.\"\n\nAs this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis) to\nsay--he being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic\ntemperament, and not at all conversational--I offered him a cake as a\nmark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant,\nand which made no more impression on his big face than it would have\ndone on an elephant's.\n\n\"Did _she_ make 'em, now?\" said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, in\nhis slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each\nknee.\n\n\"Peggotty, do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Barkis. \"Her.\"\n\n\"Yes. She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.\"\n\n\"Do she though?\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\nHe made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he didn't whistle. He sat\nlooking at the horse's ears, as if he saw something new there; and sat\nso, for a considerable time. By-and-by, he said:\n\n\"No sweethearts, I b'lieve?\"\n\n\"Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?\" For I thought he wanted something\nelse to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of\nrefreshment.\n\n\"Hearts,\" said Mr. Barkis. \"Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!\"\n\n\"With Peggotty?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"Her.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart.\"\n\n\"Didn't she though!\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\nAgain he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle, but\nsat looking at the horse's ears.\n\n\"So she makes,\" said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection,\n\"all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?\"\n\nI replied that such was the fact.\n\n\"Well. I'll tell you what,\" said Mr. Barkis. \"P'raps you might be\nwritin' to her?\"\n\n\"I shall certainly write to her,\" I rejoined.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. \"Well! If you was\nwritin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin';\nwould you.\"\n\n\"That Barkis is willing,\" I repeated, innocently. \"Is that all the\nmessage?\"\n\n\"Ye--es,\" he said, considering. \"Ye--es. Barkis is willin'.\"\n\n\"But you will be at Blunderstone again to-morrow, Mr. Barkis,\" I said,\nfaltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, \"and\ncould give your own message so much better.\"\n\nAs he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head,\nand once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound\ngravity, \"Barkis is willin'. That's the message,\" I readily undertook\nits transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel\nat Yarmouth that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and\nan inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty which ran thus: \"My dear\nPeggotty. I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama.\nYours affectionately. P. S. He says he particularly wants you to\nknow--_Barkis is willing_.\"\n\nWhen I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis\nrelapsed into perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn out by all that\nhad happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I\nslept soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which was so entirely new and\nstrange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once\nabandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's\nfamily there, perhaps even with little Em'ly herself.\n\nThe coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without any\nhorses to it as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more\nunlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and\nwondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis had\nput down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up the yard\nto turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me, when a\nlady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were\nhanging up, and said:\n\n\"Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said.\n\n\"What name?\" enquired the lady.\n\n\"Copperfield, ma'am,\" I said.\n\n\"That won't do,\" returned the lady. \"Nobody's dinner is paid for here,\nin that name.\"\n\n\"Is it Murdstone, ma'am?\" I said.\n\n\"If you're Master Murdstone,\" said the lady, \"why do you go and give\nanother name, first?\"\n\nI explained to the lady how it was, who then rang a bell, and called\nout, \"William! show the coffee-room!\" upon which a waiter came running\nout of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it, and seemed\na good deal surprised when he found he was only to show it to me.\n\nIt was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I could\nhave felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and\nI cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to sit\ndown, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the\ndoor; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set\nof castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.\n\nHe brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in\nsuch a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some\noffence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at\nthe table, and saying, very affably, \"Now, six-foot! come on!\"\n\nI thanked him, and took my seat at the board; but found it extremely\ndifficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity, or\nto avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing\nopposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful\nmanner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second\nchop, he said:\n\n\"There's half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?\"\n\nI thanked him, and said \"Yes.\" Upon which he poured it out of a jug into\na large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look\nbeautiful.\n\n\"My eye!\" he said. \"It seems a good deal, don't it?\"\n\n\"It does seem a good deal,\" I answered with a smile. For it was quite\ndelightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed,\npimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and\nas he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with\nthe other hand, he looked quite friendly.\n\n\"There was a gentleman here, yesterday,\" he said--\"a stout gentleman, by\nthe name of Topsawyer--perhaps you know him!\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I don't think----\"\n\n\"In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled\nchoaker,\" said the waiter.\n\n\"No,\" I said bashfully, \"I haven't the pleasure----\"\n\n\"He came in here,\" said the waiter, looking at the light through the\ntumbler, \"ordered a glass of this ale--_would_ order it--I told him\nnot--drank it, and fell dead. It was too old for him. It oughtn't to be\ndrawn; that's the fact.\"\n\nI was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I\nthought I had better have some water.\n\n\"Why you see,\" said the waiter, still looking at the light through the\ntumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, \"our people don't like things\nbeing ordered and left. It offends 'em. But _I_'ll drink it, if you\nlike. I'm used to it, and use is everything. I don't think it'll hurt\nme, if I throw my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I?\"\n\n  [Illustration: The friendly Waiter and I.]\n\nI replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he\ncould do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his\nhead back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess, of\nseeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall\nlifeless on the carpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I\nthought he seemed the fresher for it.\n\n\"What have we got here?\" he said, putting a fork into my dish. \"Not\nchops?\"\n\n\"Chops,\" I said.\n\n\"Lord bless my soul!\" he exclaimed, \"I didn't know they were chops. Why,\na chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer! Ain't\nit lucky?\"\n\nSo he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other,\nand ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. He\nafterwards took another chop, and another potato; and after that,\nanother chop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me a\npudding, and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become\nabsent in his mind for some moments.\n\n\"How's the pie?\" he said, rousing himself.\n\n\"It's a pudding,\" I made answer.\n\n\"Pudding!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, bless me, so it is! What!\" looking at it\nnearer. \"You don't mean to say it's a batter-pudding!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is indeed.\"\n\n\"Why, a batter-pudding,\" he said, taking up a table-spoon, \"is my\nfavorite pudding! Ain't that lucky? Come on, little 'un, and let's see\nwho'll get most.\"\n\nThe waiter certainly got most. He entreated me more than once to come in\nand win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his dispatch to\nmy dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far behind at\nthe first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw any one\nenjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was all gone,\nas if his enjoyment of it lasted still.\n\nFinding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I asked\nfor the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He not only brought\nit immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the\nletter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going to school.\n\nI said, \"Near London,\" which was all I knew.\n\n\"Oh, my eye!\" he said, looking very low-spirited, \"I am sorry for that.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" he said, shaking his head, \"that's the school where they\nbroke the boy's ribs--two ribs--a little boy he was. I should say he\nwas--let me see--how old are you, about?\"\n\nI told him between eight and nine.\n\n\"That's just his age,\" he said. \"He was eight years and six months old\nwhen they broke his first rib; eight years and eight months old when\nthey broke his second, and did for him.\"\n\nI could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an\nuncomfortable coincidence, and enquired how it was done. His answer was\nnot cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, \"With\nwhopping.\"\n\nThe blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,\nwhich made me get up and hesitatingly enquire, in the mingled pride and\ndiffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there\nwere anything to pay.\n\n\"There's a sheet of letter-paper,\" he returned. \"Did you ever buy a\nsheet of letter-paper?\"\n\nI could not remember that I ever had.\n\n\"It's dear,\" he said, \"on account of the duty. Threepence. That's the\nway we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except the\nwaiter. Never mind the ink. _I_ lose by that.\"\n\n\"What should you--what should I--how much ought I to--what would it be\nright to pay the waiter, if you please?\" I stammered, blushing.\n\n\"If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock,\" said the\nwaiter, \"I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged pairint,\nand a lovely sister,\"--here the waiter was greatly agitated--\"I wouldn't\ntake a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I\nshould beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live\non broken wittles--and I sleep on the coals\"--here the waiter burst into\ntears.\n\nI was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any\nrecognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of\nheart. Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he\nreceived with much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb,\ndirectly afterwards, to try the goodness of.\n\nIt was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up\nbehind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner\nwithout any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in\nthe bow-window, say to the guard, \"Take care of that child, George, or\nhe'll burst!\" and from observing that the women-servants who were about\nthe place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My\nunfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did\nnot appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration\nwithout being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this\nhalf-awakened it; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple\nconfidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon superior\nyears (qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change\nfor worldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole, even\nthen.\n\nI felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the\nsubject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing\nheavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater\nexpediency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite\ngetting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it\nlikewise; and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school, as\ntwo brothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon\nthe regular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it\nwas, that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an\nopportunity offered, and that, after a rather light dinner, I should\nremain hungry all night--for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel,\nin my hurry. My apprehensions were realised. When we stopped for supper\nI couldn't muster courage to take any, though I should have liked it\nvery much, but sat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did\nnot save me from more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a\nrough face, who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the\nway, except when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a\nboa constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time;\nafter which, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled\nbeef.\n\nWe had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and we\nwere due in London about eight next morning. It was Midsummer weather,\nand the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through a village, I\npictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and what\nthe inhabitants were about; and when boys came running after us, and got\nup behind and swung there for a little way, I wondered whether their\nfathers were alive, and whether they were happy at home. I had plenty to\nthink of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kind of\nplace I was going to--which was an awful speculation. Sometimes, I\nremember, I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty; and to\nendeavouring, in a confused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and\nwhat sort of boy I used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone: which I\ncouldn't satisfy myself about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him\nin such a remote antiquity.\n\nThe night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; and\nbeing put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to\nprevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their\nfalling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard\nsometimes, that I could not help crying out, \"Oh! If you please!\"--which\nthey didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was an\nelderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a\nhaystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady had\na basket with her, and she hadn't known what to do with it, for a long\ntime, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could\ngo underneath me. It cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly\nmiserable; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was in the\nbasket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave me\nthe cruellest poke with her foot, and said, \"Come, don't _you_ fidget.\n_Your_ bones are young enough, _I_'m sure!\"\n\nAt last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep easier. The\ndifficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had\nfound utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be\nconceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so\nthey gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being very much surprised\nby the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at all,\nand by the uncommon indignation with which every one repelled the\ncharge. I labor under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having\ninvariably observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our\ncommon nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is\nthe weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.\n\nWhat an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance,\nand how I believed all the adventures of all my favorite heroes to be\nconstantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it out\nin my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the\ncities of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by\ndegrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district,\nfor which we were bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the\nBlue Boar; but I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness\nwas painted up on the back of the coach.\n\nThe guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he said at the\nbooking-office door:\n\n\"Is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of Murdstone,\nfrom Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for?\"\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\"Try Copperfield, if you please, sir,\" said I, looking helplessly down.\n\n\"Is there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of Murdstone,\nfrom Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield, to\nbe left till called for?\" said the guard. \"Come! _Is_ there anybody?\"\n\nNo. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the enquiry made no\nimpression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters, with\none eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my\nneck, and tie me up in the stable.\n\nA ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was like a\nhaystack: not daring to stir, until her basket was removed. The coach\nwas clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared\nout, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach\nitself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way.\nStill, nobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone,\nSuffolk.\n\nMore solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at him and\nsee that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by\ninvitation of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, and sat down\non the scale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, as I sat looking\nat the parcels, packages, and books, and inhaling the smell of stables\n(ever since associated with that morning), a procession of most\ntremendous considerations began to march through my mind. Supposing\nnobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me\nthere? Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings? Should I\nsleep at night in one of those wooden binns with the other luggage, and\nwash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning; or should I be\nturned out every night, and expected to come again to be left till\ncalled for, when the office opened next day? Supposing there was no\nmistake in the case, and Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid\nof me, what should I do? If they allowed me to remain there until my\nseven shillings were spent, I couldn't hope to remain there when I began\nto starve. That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the\ncustomers, besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of\nfuneral expenses. If I started off at once, and tried to walk back home,\nhow could I ever find my way, how could I ever hope to walk so far, how\ncould I make sure of any one but Peggotty, even if I got back? If I\nfound out the nearest proper authorities, and offered myself to go for a\nsoldier, or a sailor, I was such a little fellow that it was most likely\nthey wouldn't take me in. These thoughts, and a hundred other such\nthoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me giddy with apprehension and\ndismay. I was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered\nto the clerk, who presently slanted me off the scale, and pushed me over\nto him, as if I were weighed, bought, delivered, and paid for.\n\nAs I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance,\nI stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow\ncheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone's; but there the\nlikeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead\nof being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a suit of black\nclothes which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the\nsleeves and legs; and he had a white neck-kerchief on that was not\nover-clean. I did not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was\nall the linen he wore, but it was all he showed or gave any hint of.\n\n\"You're the new boy?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\nI supposed I was. I didn't know.\n\n\"I'm one of the masters at Salem House,\" _he_ said.\n\nI made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed to allude\nto a common-place thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at Salem\nHouse, that we had gone some little distance from the yard before I had\nthe hardihood to mention it. We turned back, on my humbly insinuating\nthat it might be useful to me hereafter; and he told the clerk that the\ncarrier had instructions to call for it at noon.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" I said, when we had accomplished about the same\ndistance as before, \"is it far?\"\n\n\"It's down by Blackheath,\" he said.\n\n\"Is _that_ far, sir?\" I diffidently asked.\n\n\"It's a good step,\" he said. \"We shall go by the stage-coach. It's about\nsix miles.\"\n\nI was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles\nmore, was too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I had had\nnothing all night, and that if he would allow me to buy something to\neat, I should be very much obliged to him. He appeared surprised at\nthis--I see him stop and look at me now--and after considering for a\nfew moments, said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not\nfar off, and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread, or\nwhatever I liked best that was wholesome, and make my breakfast at her\nhouse, where we could get some milk.\n\nAccordingly we looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a\nseries of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and\nhe had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little\nloaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop,\nwe bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon; which still left what I\nthought a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright\nshillings, and made me consider London a very cheap place. These\nprovisions laid in, we went on through a great noise and uproar that\nconfused my weary head beyond description, and over a bridge which, no\ndoubt, was London Bridge (indeed I think he told me so, but I was half\nasleep), until we came to the poor person's house, which was a part of\nsome alms-houses, as I knew by their look, and by an inscription on a\nstone over the gate, which said they were established for twenty-five\npoor women.\n\nThe Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little\nblack doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned\nwindow on one side, and another little diamond-paned window above; and\nwe went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was\nblowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil. On seeing the master\nenter, the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said\nsomething that I thought sounded like \"My Charley!\" but on seeing me\ncome in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of\nhalf curtsey.\n\n\"Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please?\"\nsaid the Master at Salem House.\n\n\"Can I?\" said the old woman. \"Yes can I, sure!\"\n\n\"How's Mrs. Fibbitson to-day?\" said the Master, looking at another old\nwoman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of clothes\nthat I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by\nmistake.\n\n\"Ah, she's poorly,\" said the first old woman. \"It's one of her bad days.\nIf the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe she'd\ngo out too, and never come to life again.\"\n\nAs they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm day,\nshe seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous\neven of the saucepan on it; and I have reason to know that she took its\nimpressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in\ndudgeon; for I saw her, with my own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at\nme once, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else\nwas looking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with\nher own back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the\nfire as if she were sedulously keeping _it_ warm, instead of it keeping\nher warm, and watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion\nof the preparations for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her\nsuch extreme joy that she laughed aloud--and a very unmelodious laugh\nshe had, I must say.\n\nI sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a\nbason of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While I was yet\nin the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the\nMaster:\n\n\"Have you got your flute with you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he returned.\n\n\"Have a blow at it,\" said the old woman, coaxingly. \"Do!\"\n\nThe Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat,\nand brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together,\nand began immediately to play. My impression is, after many years of\nconsideration, that there never can have been anybody in the world\nwho played worse. He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard\nproduced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the\ntunes were--if there were such things in the performance at all, which\nI doubt--but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make\nme think of all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back;\nthen to take away my appetite; and lastly to make me so sleepy that\nI couldn't keep my eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin\nto nod, as the recollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little\nroom with its open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and\nits angular little staircase leading to the room above, and its three\npeacock's feathers displayed over the mantelpiece--I remember wondering\nwhen I first went in, what that peacock would have thought if he had\nknown what his finery was doomed to come to--fades from before me, and\nI nod, and sleep. The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach\nare heard instead, and I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with\na start, and the flute has come back again, and the Master at Salem\nHouse is sitting with his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the\nold woman of the house looks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and\nhe fades, and all fades, and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem\nHouse, no David Copperfield, no anything but heavy sleep.\n\nI dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal\nflute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him\nin her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave\nhim an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing\nfor a moment. I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking,\neither then or immediately afterwards; for, as he resumed--it was a real\nfact that he had stopped playing--I saw and heard the same old woman ask\nMrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs.\nFibbitson replied, \"Ay, ay! Yes!\" and nodded at the fire: to which, I am\npersuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.\n\n  [Illustration: My musical breakfast.]\n\nWhen I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem\nHouse unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before,\nand took me away. We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon the\nroof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to take\nup somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers, and\nwhere I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace up\na steep hill among green leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come to\nits destination.\n\nA short walk brought us--I mean the Master and me--to Salem House, which\nwas enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull. Over a door\nin this wall was a board with SALEM HOUSE upon it; and through a grating\nin this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face,\nwhich I found, on the door being opened, belonged to a stout man with a\nbull-neck, a wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut close all\nround his head.\n\n\"The new boy,\" said the Master.\n\nThe man with the wooden leg eyed me all over--it didn't take long, for\nthere was not much of me--and locked the gate behind us, and took out\nthe key. We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy trees,\nwhen he called after my conductor.\n\n\"Hallo!\"\n\nWe looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where\nhe lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.\n\n\"Here! The cobbler's been,\" he said, \"since you've been out, Mr. Mell,\nand he says he can't mend 'em any more. He says there an't a bit of the\noriginal boot left, and he wonders you expect it.\"\n\nWith these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back a\nfew paces to pick them up, and looked at them (very disconsolately, I\nwas afraid), as we went on together. I observed then, for the first\ntime, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear, and\nthat his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud.\n\nSalem House was a square brick building with wings; of a bare and\nunfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said\nto Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out; but he seemed surprised\nat my not knowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were\nat their several homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down\nby the sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle; and that I was sent in\nholiday-time as a punishment for my misdoing, all of which he explained\nto me as we went along.\n\nI gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most forlorn\nand desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room with three\nlong rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling all round with pegs\nfor hats and slates. Scraps of old copybooks and exercises, litter the\ndirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made of the same materials, are\nscattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind\nby their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of\npasteboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes for\nanything to eat. A bird, in a cage a very little bigger than himself,\nmakes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches\nhigh, or dropping from it; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a\nstrange unwholesome smell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet\napples wanting air, and rotten books. There could not well be more ink\nsplashed about it, if it had been roofless from its first construction,\nand the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the\nvarying seasons of the year.\n\nMr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots up-stairs, I\nwent softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept\nalong. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written,\nwhich was lying on the desk, and bore these words--\"_Take care of him.\nHe bites._\"\n\nI got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog\nunderneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could\nsee nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell\ncame back, and asked me what I did up there.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" says I, \"if you please, I'm looking for the\ndog.\"\n\n\"Dog?\" says he. \"What dog?\"\n\n\"Isn't it a dog, sir?\"\n\n\"Isn't what a dog?\"\n\n\"That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites.\"\n\n\"No, Copperfield,\" says he gravely, \"that's not a dog. That's a boy. My\ninstructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am\nsorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it.\"\n\nWith that, he took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly\nconstructed for the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and\nwherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it.\n\nWhat I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether it was\npossible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that somebody was\nreading it. It was no relief to turn round and find nobody; for wherever\nmy back was, there I imagined somebody always to be. That cruel man with\nthe wooden leg, aggravated my sufferings. He was in authority; and if he\never saw me leaning against a tree, or a wall, or the house, he roared\nout from his lodge-door in a stupendous voice, \"Hallo, you sir! You\nCopperfield! Show that badge conspicuous, or I'll report you!\" The\nplayground was a bare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house\nand the offices; and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher\nread it, and the baker read it; that everybody, in a word, who came\nbackwards and forwards to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to\nwalk there, read that I was to be taken care of, for I bit. I recollect\nthat I positively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy\nwho did bite.\n\nThere was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had a custom\nof carving their names. It was completely covered with such\ninscriptions. In my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming\nback, I could not read a boy's name, without enquiring in what tone and\nwith what emphasis _he_ would read, \"Take care of him. He bites.\" There\nwas one boy--a certain J. Steerforth--who cut his name very deep and\nvery often, who, I conceived, would read it in a rather strong voice,\nand afterwards pull my hair. There was another boy, one Tommy Traddles,\nwho I dreaded would make game of it, and pretend to be dreadfully\nfrightened of me. There was a third, George Demple, who I fancied would\nsing it. I have looked, a little shrinking creature, at that door, until\nthe owners of all the names--there were five-and-forty of them in the\nschool then, Mr. Mell said--seemed to send me to Coventry by general\nacclamation, and to cry out, each in his own way, \"Take care of him. He\nbites!\"\n\nIt was the same with the places at the desks and forms. It was the same\nwith the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to, and\nwhen I was in, my own bed. I remember dreaming night after night, of\nbeing with my mother as she used to be, or of going to a party at Mr.\nPeggotty's, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, or of dining again\nwith my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in all these circumstances\nmaking people scream and stare, by the unhappy disclosure that I had\nnothing on but my little night-shirt, and that placard.\n\nIn the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of the\nreopening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction! I had\nlong tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being no\nMr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace.\nBefore, and after them, I walked about--supervised, as I have mentioned,\nby the man with the wooden leg. How vividly I call to mind the damp\nabout the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky\nwater-butt, and the discolored trunks of some of the grim trees, which\nseemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to have\nblown less in the sun! At one we dined, Mr. Mell and I, at the upper end\nof a long bare dining-room, full of deal tables, and smelling of fat.\nThen, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue\nteacup, and I out of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven or eight\nin the evening, Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the schoolroom,\nworked hard with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing-paper, making out\nthe bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put up his things\nfor the night he took out his flute, and blew at it, until I almost\nthought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at\nthe top, and ooze away at the keys.\n\nI picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with my head\nupon my hand, listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and\nconning to-morrow's lessons. I picture myself with my books shut up,\nstill listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening\nthrough it to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind on\nYarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. I picture myself\ngoing up to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side\ncrying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. I picture myself coming\ndown stairs in the morning, and looking through a long ghastly gash of a\nstaircase-window, at the school-bell hanging on the top of an outhouse,\nwith a weathercock above it; and dreading the time when it shall ring J.\nSteerforth and the rest to work: which is only second, in my foreboding\napprehensions, to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock\nthe rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle. I cannot\nthink I was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects, but in\nall of them I carried the same warning on my back.\n\nMr. Mell never said much to me, but he was never harsh to me. I suppose\nwe were company to each other, without talking. I forgot to mention that\nhe would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and clench his fist, and\ngrind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner. But he\nhad these peculiarities: and at first they frightened me, though I soon\ngot used to them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nI ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE.\n\n\nI had led this life about a month, when the man with the wooden leg\nbegan to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water, from which I\ninferred that preparations were making to receive Mr. Creakle and the\nboys. I was not mistaken; for the mop came into the schoolroom before\nlong, and turned out Mr. Mell and me, who lived where we could, and got\non how we could, for some days, during which we were always in the way\nof two or three young women, who had rarely shown themselves before, and\nwere so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost as much\nas if Salem House had been a great snuff-box.\n\nOne day I was informed by Mr. Mell, that Mr. Creakle would be home that\nevening. In the evening, after tea, I heard that he was come. Before\nbed-time, I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear before\nhim.\n\nMr. Creakle's part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than\nours, and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the\ndusty playground, which was such a desert in miniature, that I thought\nno one but a camel, or a dromedary, could have felt at home in it. It\nseemed to me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked\ncomfortable, as I went on my way, trembling, to Mr. Creakle's presence:\nwhich so abashed me, when I was ushered into it, that I hardly saw Mrs.\nCreakle or Miss Creakle (who were both there, in the parlor), or\nanything but Mr. Creakle, a stout gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain\nand seals, in an arm-chair, with a tumbler and bottle beside him.\n\n\"So!\" said Mr. Creakle. \"This is the young gentleman whose teeth are to\nbe filed! Turn him round.\"\n\nThe wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard; and\nhaving afforded time for a full survey of it, turned me about again,\nwith my face to Mr. Creakle, and posted himself at Mr. Creakle's side.\nMr. Creakle's face was fiery, and his eyes were small, and deep in his\nhead; he had thick veins in his forehead, a little nose, and a large\nchin. He was bald on the top of his head; and had some thin wet-looking\nhair that was just turning grey, brushed across each temple, so that the\ntwo sides interlaced on his forehead. But the circumstance about him\nwhich impressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a\nwhisper. The exertion this cost him, or the consciousness of talking in\nthat feeble way, made his angry face so much more angry, and his thick\nveins so much thicker, when he spoke, that I am not surprised, on\nlooking back, at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one.\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Creakle. \"What's the report of this boy?\"\n\n\"There's nothing against him yet,\" returned the man with the wooden leg.\n\"There has been no opportunity.\"\n\nI thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed. I thought Mrs. and Miss Creakle\n(at whom I now glanced for the first time, and who were, both, thin and\nquiet) were not disappointed.\n\n\"Come here, sir!\" said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me.\n\n\"Come here!\" said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the gesture.\n\n\"I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law,\" whispered Mr.\nCreakle, taking me by the ear; \"and a worthy man he is, and a man of a\nstrong character. He knows me, and I know him. Do _you_ know me? Hey?\"\nsaid Mr. Creakle, pinching my ear with ferocious playfulness.\n\n\"Not yet, sir,\" I said, flinching with the pain.\n\n\"Not yet? Hey?\" repeated Mr. Creakle. \"But you will soon. Hey?\"\n\n\"You will soon. Hey?\" repeated the man with the wooden leg. I afterwards\nfound that he generally acted, with his strong voice, as Mr. Creakle's\ninterpreter to the boys.\n\nI was very much frightened, and said, I hoped so, if he pleased. I felt,\nall this while, as if my ear were blazing; he pinched it so hard.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I am,\" whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last,\nwith a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes. \"I'm a\nTartar.\"\n\n\"A Tartar,\" said the man with the wooden leg.\n\n\"When I say I'll do a thing, I do it,\" said Mr. Creakle; \"and when I say\nI will have a thing done, I will have it done.\"\n\n\"--Will have a thing done, I will have it done,\" repeated the man with\nthe wooden leg.\n\n\"I am a determined character,\" said Mr. Creakle. \"That's what I am. I do\nmy duty. That's what _I_ do. My flesh and blood\"--he looked at Mrs.\nCreakle as he said this--\"when it rises against me, is not my flesh and\nblood. I discard it. Has that fellow,\" to the man with the wooden leg,\n\"been here again?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the answer.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Creakle. \"He knows better. He knows me. Let him keep\naway. I say let him keep away,\" said Mr. Creakle, striking his hand upon\nthe table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, \"for he knows me. Now you have\nbegun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go. Take him away.\"\n\nI was very glad to be ordered away, for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were both\nwiping their eyes, and I felt as uncomfortable for them, as I did for\nmyself. But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so nearly,\nthat I couldn't help saying, though I wondered at my own courage:\n\n\"If you please, sir----\"\n\nMr. Creakle whispered, \"Hah? What's this?\" and bent his eyes upon me, as\nif he would have burnt me up with them.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" I faltered, \"if I might be allowed (I am very\nsorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, before the\nboys come back----\"\n\nWhether Mr. Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it to\nfrighten me I don't know, but he made a burst out of his chair, before\nwhich I precipitately retreated, without waiting for the escort of the\nman with the wooden leg, and never once stopped until I reached my own\nbedroom, where, finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as it was\ntime, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours.\n\nNext morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp was the first master,\nand superior to Mr. Mell. Mr. Mell took his meals with the boys, but\nMr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a limp,\ndelicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of nose, and a\nway of carrying his head on one side, as if it were a little too heavy\nfor him. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but I was informed by the\nvery first boy who came back that it was a wig (a second-hand one _he_\nsaid), and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it\ncurled.\n\nIt was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of\nintelligence. He was the first boy who returned. He introduced himself\nby informing me that I should find his name on the right-hand corner of\nthe gate, over the top bolt; upon that I said, \"Traddles?\" to which he\nreplied, \"The same,\" and then he asked me for a full account of myself\nand family.\n\nIt was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. He\nenjoyed my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of\neither disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other boy\nwho came back, great or small, immediately on his arrival, in this form\nof introduction, \"Look here! Here's a game!\" Happily, too, the greater\npart of the boys came back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at\nmy expense as I had expected. Some of them certainly did dance about me\nlike wild Indians, and the greater part could not resist the temptation\nof pretending that I was a dog, and patting and smoothing me lest I\nshould bite, and saying, \"Lie down, sir!\" and calling me Towzer. This\nwas naturally confusing, among so many strangers, and cost me some\ntears, but on the whole it was much better than I had anticipated.\n\nI was not considered as being formally received into the school,\nhowever, until J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was reputed\nto be a great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least\nhalf-a-dozen years my senior, I was carried as before a magistrate. He\nenquired, under a shed in the playground, into the particulars of my\npunishment, and was pleased to express his opinion that it was \"a jolly\nshame;\" for which I became bound to him ever afterwards.\n\n\"What money have you got, Copperfield?\" he said, walking aside with me\nwhen he had disposed of my affair in these terms.\n\nI told him seven shillings.\n\n\"You had better give it to me to take care of,\" he said. \"At least, you\ncan if you like. You needn't if you don't like.\"\n\nI hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and opening\nPeggotty's purse, turned it upside down into his hand.\n\n\"Do you want to spend anything now?\" he asked me.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" I replied.\n\n\"You can if you like, you know,\" said Steerforth. \"Say the word.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, sir,\" I repeated.\n\n\"Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of\ncurrant wine by-and-by, up in the bedroom?\" said Steerforth. \"You belong\nto my bedroom, I find.\"\n\nIt certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, I should\nlike that.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Steerforth. \"You'll be glad to spend another shilling\nor so, in almond cakes, I dare say?\"\n\nI said, Yes, I should like that, too.\n\n\"And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh?\" said\nSteerforth. \"I say, young Copperfield, you're going it!\"\n\nI smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my mind, too.\n\n\"Well!\" said Steerforth. \"We must make it stretch as far as we can;\nthat's all. I'll do the best in my power for you. I can go out when I\nlike, and I'll smuggle the prog in.\" With these words he put the money\nin his pocket, and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy; he would\ntake care it should be all right.\n\nHe was as good as his word, if that were all right which I had a secret\nmisgiving was nearly all wrong--for I feared it was a waste of my\nmother's two half-crowns--though I had preserved the piece of paper they\nwere wrapped in: which was a precious saving. When we went up-stairs to\nbed, he produced the whole seven shillings' worth, and laid it out on my\nbed in the moonlight, saying:\n\n\"There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you've got!\"\n\nI couldn't think of doing the honors of the feast, at my time of life,\nwhile he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. I begged him\nto do me the favor of presiding; and my request being seconded by the\nother boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and sat upon my\npillow, handing round the viands--with perfect fairness, I must say--and\ndispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was\nhis own property. As to me, I sat on his left hand, and the rest were\ngrouped about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.\n\nHow well I recollect our sitting there, talking in whispers; or their\ntalking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather to say; the\nmoonlight falling a little way into the room, through the window,\npainting a pale window on the floor, and the greater part of us in\nshadow, except when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorous-box,\nwhen he wanted to look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare\nover us that was gone directly! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent\non the darkness, the secresy of the revel, and the whisper in which\neverything was said, steals over me again, and I listen to all they tell\nme with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that\nthey are all so near, and frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when\nTraddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner.\n\nI heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it. I\nheard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar\nwithout reason; that he was the sternest and most severe of masters;\nthat he laid about him, right and left, every day of his life, charging\nin among the boys like a trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully. That\nhe knew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being more ignorant\n(J. Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that he had\nbeen, a good many years ago, a small hop-dealer in the Borough, and had\ntaken to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops, and making\naway with Mrs. Creakle's money. With a good deal more of that sort,\nwhich I wondered how they knew.\n\nI heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay, was an\nobstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business, but\nhad come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence, as\nwas supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr.\nCreakle's service, and having done a deal of dishonest work for him, and\nknowing his secrets. I heard that with the single exception of Mr.\nCreakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment, masters and boys, as\nhis natural enemies, and that the only delight of his life was to be\nsour and malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had not been\nTungay's friend, and who, assisting in the school, had once held some\nremonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very\ncruelly exercised, and was supposed, besides, to have protested against\nhis father's usage of his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned\nhim out of doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had\nbeen in a sad way, ever since.\n\nBut the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being one\nboy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that boy\nbeing J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was\nstated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it. On being\nasked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if he did begin to see\nhim do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorous-box on purpose to shed\na glare over his reply, and said he would commence by knocking him down\nwith a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that\nwas always on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some time,\nbreathless.\n\nI heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both supposed to be wretchedly\npaid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at Mr.\nCreakle's table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold;\nwhich was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlor-boarder.\nI heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; and that he needn't be so\n\"bounceable\"--somebody else said \"bumptious\"--about it, because his own\nred hair was very plainly to be seen behind.\n\nI heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as a set-off\nagainst the coal-bill, and was called on that account \"Exchange or\nBarter\"--a name selected from the arithmetic-book as expressing this\narrangement. I heard that the table-beer was a robbery of parents, and\nthe pudding an imposition. I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the\nschool in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I\nsat in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his\neasy manner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard\nthat Mr. Mell was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to\nbless himself with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his\nmother, was as poor as Job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had\nsounded like \"My Charley!\" but I was, I am glad to remember, as mute as\na mouse about it.\n\nThe hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet\nsome time. The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the\neating and drinking were over; and we, who had remained whispering and\nlistening half undressed, at last betook ourselves to bed, too.\n\n\"Good night, young Copperfield,\" said Steerforth, \"I'll take care of\nyou.\"\n\n\"You're very kind,\" I gratefully returned. \"I am very much obliged to\nyou.\"\n\n\"You haven't got a sister, have you?\" said Steerforth, yawning.\n\n\"No,\" I answered.\n\n\"That's a pity,\" said Steerforth. \"If you had had one, I should think\nshe would have been a pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort of girl. I\nshould have liked to know her. Good night, young Copperfield.\"\n\n\"Good night, sir,\" I replied.\n\nI thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I\nrecollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his\nhandsome face turned up, and his head reclining easily on his arm. He\nwas a person of great power in my eyes; that was of course the reason of\nmy mind running on him. No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the\nmoonbeams. There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, in the garden\nthat I dreamed of walking in all night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nMY \"FIRST HALF\" AT SALEM HOUSE.\n\n\nSchool began in earnest next day. A profound impression was made upon\nme, I remember, by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly\nbecoming hushed as death when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast, and\nstood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story-book\nsurveying his captives.\n\nTungay stood at Mr. Creakle's elbow. He had no occasion, I thought, to\ncry out \"Silence!\" so ferociously, for the boys were all struck\nspeechless and motionless.\n\nMr. Creakle was seen to speak, and Tungay was heard, to this effect.\n\n\"Now, boys, this is a new half. Take care what you're about, in this new\nhalf. Come fresh up to the lessons, I advise you, for I come fresh up to\nthe punishment. I won't flinch. It will be of no use your rubbing\nyourselves; you won't rub the marks out that I shall give you. Now get\nto work, every boy!\"\n\nWhen this dreadful exordium was over, and Tungay had stumped out again,\nMr. Creakle came to where I sat, and told me that if I were famous for\nbiting, he was famous for biting, too. He then showed me the cane, and\nasked me what I thought of _that_, for a tooth? Was it a sharp tooth,\nhey? Was it a double tooth, hey? Had it a deep prong, hey? Did it bite,\nhey? Did it bite? At every question he gave me a fleshy cut with it that\nmade me writhe; so I was very soon made free of Salem House (as\nSteerforth said), and very soon in tears also.\n\nNot that I mean to say these were special marks of distinction, which\nonly I received. On the contrary, a large majority of the boys\n(especially the smaller ones) were visited with similar instances of\nnotice, as Mr. Creakle made the round of the schoolroom. Half the\nestablishment was writhing and crying, before the day's work began; and\nhow much of it had writhed and cried before the day's work was over, I\nam really afraid to recollect, lest I should seem to exaggerate.\n\nI should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his\nprofession more than Mr. Creakle did. He had a delight in cutting at the\nboys, which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite. I am\nconfident that he couldn't resist a chubby boy, especially; that there\nwas a fascination in such a subject, which made him restless in his\nmind, until he had scored and marked him for the day. I was chubby\nmyself, and ought to know. I am sure when I think of the fellow now, my\nblood rises against him with the disinterested indignation I should feel\nif I could have known all about him without having ever been in his\npower; but it rises hotly, because I know him to have been an incapable\nbrute, who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held,\nthan to be Lord High Admiral, or Commander-in-chief: in either of which\ncapacities, it is probable that he would have done infinitely less\nmischief.\n\nMiserable little propitiators of a remorseless Idol, how abject we were\nto him! What a launch in life I think it now, on looking back, to be so\nmean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions!\n\nHere I sit at the desk again, watching his eye--humbly watching his eye,\nas he rules a cyphering-book for another victim whose hands have just\nbeen flattened by that identical ruler, and who is trying to wipe the\nsting out with a pocket-handkerchief. I have plenty to do. I don't watch\nhis eye in idleness, but because I am morbidly attracted to it, in a\ndread desire to know what he will do next, and whether it will be my\nturn to suffer, or somebody else's. A lane of small boys beyond me, with\nthe same interest in his eye, watch it too. I think he knows it, though\nhe pretends he don't. He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the\ncyphering-book; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane, and we\nall droop over our books and tremble. A moment afterwards we are again\neyeing him. An unhappy culprit, found guilty of imperfect exercise,\napproaches at his command. The culprit falters excuses, and professes a\ndetermination to do better to-morrow. Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he\nbeats him, and we laugh at it,--miserable little dogs, we laugh, with\nour visages as white as ashes, and our hearts sinking into our boots.\n\nHere I sit at the desk again, on a drowsy summer afternoon. A buzz and\nhum go up around me, as if the boys were so many blue-bottles. A cloggy\nsensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me (we dined an hour or\ntwo ago), and my head is as heavy as so much lead. I would give the\nworld to go to sleep. I sit with my eye on Mr. Creakle, blinking at him\nlike a young owl; when sleep overpowers me for a minute, he still looms\nthrough my slumber, ruling those cyphering-books; until he softly comes\nbehind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him, with a red ridge\nacross my back.\n\nHere I am in the playground, with my eye still fascinated by him, though\nI can't see him. The window at a little distance from which I know he is\nhaving his dinner, stands for him, and I eye that instead. If he shows\nhis face near it, mine assumes an imploring and submissive expression.\nIf he looks out through the glass, the boldest boy (Steerforth excepted)\nstops in the middle of a shout or yell, and becomes contemplative. One\nday, Traddles (the most unfortunate boy in the world) breaks that window\naccidentally, with a ball. I shudder at this moment with the tremendous\nsensation of seeing it done, and feeling that the ball has bounded on to\nMr. Creakle's sacred head.\n\nPoor Traddles! In a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs like\nGerman sausages, or roly-poly puddings, he was the merriest and most\nmiserable of all the boys. He was always being caned--I think he was\ncaned every day that half-year, except one holiday Monday when he was\nonly ruler'd on both hands--and was always going to write to his uncle\nabout it, and never did. After laying his head on the desk for a little\nwhile, he would cheer up, somehow, begin to laugh again, and draw\nskeletons all over his slate, before his eyes were dry. I used at first\nto wonder what comfort Traddles found in drawing skeletons; and for some\ntime looked upon him as a sort of hermit, who reminded himself by those\nsymbols of mortality that caning couldn't last for ever. But I believe\nhe only did it because they were easy, and didn't want any features.\n\nHe was very honorable, Traddles was; and held it as a solemn duty in the\nboys to stand by one another. He suffered for this on several occasions;\nand particularly once, when Steerforth laughed in church, and the Beadle\nthought it was Traddles, and took him out. I see him now, going away in\ncustody, despised by the congregation. He never said who was the real\noffender, though he smarted for it next day, and was imprisoned so many\nhours that he came forth with a whole churchyard-full of skeletons\nswarming all over his Latin Dictionary. But he had his reward.\nSteerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in Traddles, and we all\nfelt that to be the highest praise. For my part, I could have gone\nthrough a good deal (though I was much less brave than Traddles, and\nnothing like so old) to have won such a recompense.\n\nTo see Steerforth walk to church before us, arm-in-arm with Miss\nCreakle, was one of the great sights of my life. I didn't think Miss\nCreakle equal to little Em'ly in point of beauty, and I didn't love her\n(I didn't dare); but I thought her a young lady of extraordinary\nattractions, and in point of gentility not to be surpassed. When\nSteerforth, in white trousers, carried her parasol for her, I felt proud\nto know him; and believed that she could not choose but adore him with\nall her heart. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both notable personages in my\neyes; but Steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars.\n\n  [Illustration: Steerforth and Mr. Mell.]\n\nSteerforth continued his protection of me, and proved a very useful\nfriend; since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honored with his\ncountenance. He couldn't--or at all events, he didn't--defend me from\nMr. Creakle, who was very severe with me; but whenever I had been\ntreated worse than usual, he always told me that I wanted a little of\nhis pluck, and that he wouldn't have stood it himself; which I felt he\nintended for encouragement, and considered to be very kind of him. There\nwas one advantage, and only one that I know of, in Mr. Creakle's\nseverity. He found my placard in his way, when he came up or down behind\nthe form on which I sat, and wanted to make a cut at me in passing; for\nthis reason it was soon taken off, and I saw it no more.\n\nAn accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between Steerforth and\nme, in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction,\nthough it sometimes led to inconvenience. It happened on one occasion,\nwhen he was doing me the honor of talking to me in the playground,\nthat I hazarded the observation that something or somebody--I forget\nwhat now--was like something or somebody in Peregrine Pickle. He said\nnothing at the time; but when I was going to bed at night, asked me if\nI had got that book.\n\nI told him no, and explained how it was that I had read it, and all\nthose other books of which I have made mention.\n\n\"And do you recollect them?\" Steerforth said.\n\nOh yes, I replied; I had a good memory, and I believed I recollected\nthem very well.\n\n\"Then I tell you what, young Copperfield,\" said Steerforth, \"you shall\ntell 'em to me. I can't get to sleep very early at night, and I\ngenerally wake rather early in the morning. We'll go over 'em one after\nanother. We'll make some regular Arabian Nights of it.\"\n\nI felt extremely flattered by this arrangement, and we commenced\ncarrying it into execution that very evening. What ravages I committed\non my favorite authors in the course of my interpretation of them, I am\nnot in a condition to say, and should be very unwilling to know; but I\nhad a profound faith in them, and I had, to the best of my belief, a\nsimple, earnest manner of narrating what I did narrate; and these\nqualities went a long way.\n\nThe drawback was, that I was often sleepy at night, or out of spirits\nand indisposed to resume the story; and then it was rather hard work,\nand it must be done; for to disappoint or displease Steerforth was of\ncourse out of the question. In the morning, too, when I felt weary and\nshould have enjoyed another hour's repose very much, it was a tiresome\nthing to be roused, like the Sultana Scheherazade, and forced into a\nlong story before the getting-up bell rang; but Steerforth was resolute;\nand as he explained to me, in return, my sums and exercises, and\nanything in my tasks that was too hard for me, I was no loser by the\ntransaction. Let me do myself justice, however. I was moved by no\ninterested or selfish motive, nor was I moved by fear of him. I admired\nand loved him, and his approval was return enough. It was so precious to\nme that I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart.\n\nSteerforth was considerate, too; and showed his consideration, in one\nparticular instance, in an unflinching manner that was a little\ntantalising, I suspect, to poor Traddles and the rest. Peggotty's\npromised letter--what a comfortable letter it was!--arrived before \"the\nhalf\" was many weeks old; and with it a cake in a perfect nest of\noranges, and two bottles of cowslip wine. This treasure, as in duty\nbound, I laid at the feet of Steerforth, and begged him to dispense.\n\n\"Now, I'll tell you what, young Copperfield,\" said he: \"the wine shall\nbe kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling.\"\n\nI blushed at the idea, and begged him, in my modesty, not to think of\nit. But he said he had observed I was sometimes hoarse--a little roopy\nwas his exact expression--and it should be, every drop, devoted to the\npurpose he had mentioned. Accordingly, it was locked up in his box, and\ndrawn off by himself in a phial, and administered to me through a piece\nof quill in the cork, when I was supposed to be in want of a\nrestorative. Sometimes, to make it a more sovereign specific, he was so\nkind as to squeeze orange juice into it, or to stir it up with ginger,\nor dissolve a peppermint drop in it; and although I cannot assert that\nthe flavour was improved by these experiments, or that it was exactly\nthe compound one would have chosen for a stomachic, the last thing at\nnight and the first thing in the morning, I drank it gratefully and was\nvery sensible of his attention.\n\nWe seem, to me, to have been months over Peregrine, and months more over\nthe other stories. The institution never flagged for want of a story, I\nam certain; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter. Poor\nTraddles--I never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to\nlaugh, and with tears in my eyes--was a sort of chorus, in general; and\naffected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts, and to be\novercome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character\nin the narrative. This rather put me out, very often. It was a great\njest of his, I recollect, to pretend that he couldn't keep his teeth\nfrom chattering, whenever mention was made of an Alguazil in connexion\nwith the adventures of Gil Blas; and I remember, when Gil Blas met the\ncaptain of the robbers in Madrid, this unlucky joker counterfeited such\nan ague of terror, that he was overheard by Mr. Creakle, who was\nprowling about the passage, and handsomely flogged for disorderly\nconduct in the bedroom.\n\nWhatever I had within me that was romantic and dreamy, was encouraged by\nso much story-telling in the dark; and in that respect the pursuit may\nnot have been very profitable to me. But the being cherished as a kind\nof plaything in my room, and the consciousness that this accomplishment\nof mine was bruited about among the boys, and attracted a good deal of\nnotice to me though I was the youngest there, stimulated me to exertion.\nIn a school carried on by sheer cruelty, whether it is presided over by\na dunce or not, there is not likely to be much learnt. I believe our\nboys were, generally, as ignorant a set as any schoolboys in existence;\nthey were too much troubled and knocked about to learn; they could no\nmore do that to advantage, than any one can do anything to advantage in\na life of constant misfortune, torment, and worry. But my little vanity,\nand Steerforth's help, urged me on somehow; and without saving me from\nmuch, if anything, in the way of punishment, made me, for the time I was\nthere, an exception to the general body, insomuch that I did steadily\npick up some crumbs of knowledge.\n\nIn this I was much assisted by Mr. Mell, who had a liking for me that I\nam grateful to remember. It always gave me pain to observe that\nSteerforth treated him with systematic disparagement, and seldom lost an\noccasion of wounding his feelings, or inducing others to do so. This\ntroubled me the more for a long time, because I had soon told\nSteerforth, from whom I could no more keep such a secret, than I could\nkeep a cake or any other tangible possession, about the two old women\nMr. Mell had taken me to see; and I was always afraid that Steerforth\nwould let it out, and twit him with it.\n\nWe little thought any one of us, I dare say, when I ate my breakfast\nthat first morning, and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock's\nfeathers to the sound of the flute, what consequences would come of the\nintroduction into those alms-houses of my insignificant person. But the\nvisit had its unforeseen consequences; and of a serious sort, too, in\ntheir way.\n\nOne day when Mr. Creakle kept the house from indisposition, which\nnaturally diffused a lively joy through the school, there was a good\ndeal of noise in the course of the morning's work. The great relief and\nsatisfaction experienced by the boys made them difficult to manage; and\nthough the dreaded Tungay brought his wooden leg in twice or thrice, and\ntook notes of the principal offenders' names, no great impression was\nmade by it, as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble to-morrow\ndo what they would, and thought it wise, no doubt, to enjoy themselves\nto-day.\n\nIt was, properly, a half-holiday; being Saturday. But as the noise in\nthe playground would have disturbed Mr. Creakle, and the weather was not\nfavorable for going out walking, we were ordered into school in the\nafternoon, and set some lighter tasks than usual, which were made for\nthe occasion. It was the day of the week on which Mr. Sharp went out to\nget his wig curled; so Mr. Mell, who always did the drudgery, whatever\nit was, kept school by himself.\n\nIf I could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with any one so mild\nas Mr. Mell, I should think of him, in connexion with that afternoon\nwhen the uproar was at its height, as of one of those animals, baited by\na thousand dogs. I recall him bending his aching head, supported on his\nbony hand, over the book on his desk, and wretchedly endeavouring to get\non with his tiresome work, amidst an uproar that might have made the\nSpeaker of the House of Commons giddy. Boys started in and out of their\nplaces, playing at puss in the corner with other boys; there were\nlaughing boys, singing boys, talking boys, dancing boys, howling boys;\nboys shuffled with their feet, boys whirled about him, grinning, making\nfaces, mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes: mimicking his\npoverty, his boots, his coat, his mother, everything belonging to him\nthat they should have had consideration for.\n\n\"Silence!\" cried Mr. Mell, suddenly rising up, and striking his desk\nwith the book. \"What does this mean! It's impossible to bear it. It's\nmaddening. How can you do it to me, boys?\"\n\nIt was my book that he struck his desk with; and as I stood beside him,\nfollowing his eye as it glanced round the room, I saw the boys all stop,\nsome suddenly surprised, some half afraid, and some sorry perhaps.\n\nSteerforth's place was at the bottom of the school, at the opposite end\nof the long room. He was lounging with his back against the wall, and\nhis hands in his pockets, and looked at Mr. Mell with his mouth shut up\nas if he were whistling, when Mr. Mell looked at him.\n\n\"Silence, Mr. Steerforth!\" said Mr. Mell.\n\n\"Silence yourself,\" said Steerforth, turning red. \"Whom are you talking\nto?\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Mr. Mell.\n\n\"Sit down yourself,\" said Steerforth, \"and mind your business.\"\n\nThere was a titter, and some applause; but Mr. Mell was so white, that\nsilence immediately succeeded; and one boy, who had darted out behind\nhim to imitate his mother again, changed his mind, and pretended to want\na pen mended.\n\n\"If you think, Steerforth,\" said Mr. Mell, \"that I am not acquainted\nwith the power you can establish over any mind here\"--he laid his hand,\nwithout considering what he did (as I supposed), upon my head--\"or that\nI have not observed you, within a few minutes, urging your juniors on to\nevery sort of outrage against me, you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"I don't give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you,\" said\nSteerforth, coolly; \"so I'm not mistaken, as it happens.\"\n\n\"And when you make use of your position of favoritism here, sir,\"\npursued Mr. Mell, with his lip trembling very much, \"to insult a\ngentleman--\"\n\n\"A what?--where is he?\" said Steerforth.\n\nHere somebody cried out, \"Shame, J. Steerforth! Too bad!\" It was\nTraddles; whom Mr. Mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his\ntongue.\n\n--\"To insult one who is not fortunate in life, sir, and who never gave\nyou the least offence, and the many reasons for not insulting whom you\nare old enough and wise enough to understand,\" said Mr. Mell, with his\nlip trembling more and more, \"you commit a mean and base action. You can\nsit down or stand up as you please, sir. Copperfield, go on.\"\n\n\"Young Copperfield,\" said Steerforth, coming forward up the room, \"stop\na bit. I tell you what, Mr. Mell, once for all. When you take the\nliberty of calling me mean or base, or anything of that sort, you are an\nimpudent beggar. You are always a beggar, you know; but when you do\nthat, you are an impudent beggar.\"\n\nI am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell, or Mr. Mell was\ngoing to strike him, or there was any such intention on either side. I\nsaw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned\ninto stone, and found Mr. Creakle in the midst of us, with Tungay at his\nside, and Mrs. and Miss Creakle looking in at the door as if they were\nfrightened. Mr. Mell, with his elbows on his desk and his face in his\nhands, sat, for some moments, quite still.\n\n\"Mr. Mell,\" said Mr. Creakle, shaking him by the arm; and his whisper\nwas so audible now, that Tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words;\n\"you have not forgotten yourself, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, sir, no,\" returned the Master, showing his face, and shaking his\nhead, and rubbing his hands in great agitation. \"No, sir. No. I have\nremembered myself, I--no, Mr. Creakle, I have not forgotten myself, I--I\nhave remembered myself, sir. I--I--could wish you had remembered me a\nlittle sooner, Mr. Creakle. It--it--would have been more kind, sir, more\njust, sir. It would have saved me something, sir.\"\n\nMr. Creakle, looking hard at Mr. Mell, put his hand on Tungay's\nshoulder, and got his feet upon the form close by, and sat upon the\ndesk. After still looking hard at Mr. Mell from this throne, as he shook\nhis head, and rubbed his hands, and remained in the same state of\nagitation, Mr. Creakle turned to Steerforth, and said:\n\n\"Now, sir, as he don't condescend to tell me, what _is_ this?\"\n\nSteerforth evaded the question for a little while; looking in scorn and\nanger on his opponent, and remaining silent. I could not help thinking\neven in that interval, I remember, what a noble fellow he was in\nappearance, and how homely and plain Mr. Mell looked opposed to him.\n\n\"What did he mean by talking about favorites, then!\" said Steerforth at\nlength.\n\n\"Favorites?\" repeated Mr. Creakle, with the veins in his forehead\nswelling quickly. \"Who talked about favorites?\"\n\n\"He did,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"And pray, what did you mean by that, sir?\" demanded Mr. Creakle,\nturning angrily on his assistant.\n\n\"I meant, Mr. Creakle,\" he returned in a low voice, \"as I said; that no\npupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favoritism to\ndegrade me.\"\n\n\"To degrade _you_?\" said Mr. Creakle. \"My stars! But give me leave to\nask you, Mr. What's-your-name;\" and here Mr. Creakle folded his arms,\ncane and all, upon his chest, and made such a knot of his brows that his\nlittle eyes were hardly visible below them; \"whether, when you talk\nabout favorites, you showed proper respect to me? To me, sir,\" said Mr.\nCreakle, darting his head at him suddenly, and drawing it back again,\n\"the principal of this establishment, and your employer.\"\n\n\"It was not judicious, sir, I am willing to admit,\" said Mr. Mell. \"I\nshould not have done so, if I had been cool.\"\n\nHere Steerforth struck in.\n\n\"Then he said I was mean, and then he said I was base, and then I called\nhim a beggar. If _I_ had been cool, perhaps I shouldn't have called him\na beggar. But I did, and I am ready to take the consequences of it.\"\n\nWithout considering, perhaps, whether there were any consequences to be\ntaken, I felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech. It made an\nimpression on the boys too, for there was a low stir among them, though\nno one spoke a word.\n\n\"I am surprised, Steerforth--although your candor does you honor,\" said\nMr. Creakle, \"does you honor, certainly--I am surprised, Steerforth, I\nmust say, that you should attach such an epithet to any person employed\nand paid in Salem House, sir.\"\n\nSteerforth gave a short laugh.\n\n\"That's not an answer, sir,\" said Mr. Creakle, \"to my remark. I expect\nmore than that, from you, Steerforth.\"\n\nIf Mr. Mell looked homely, in my eyes, before the handsome boy, it would\nbe quite impossible to say how homely Mr. Creakle looked.\n\n\"Let him deny it,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Deny that he is a beggar, Steerforth?\" cried Mr. Creakle. \"Why, where\ndoes he go a begging?\"\n\n\"If he is not a beggar himself, his near relation's one,\" said\nSteerforth. \"It's all the same.\"\n\nHe glanced at me, and Mr. Mell's hand gently patted me upon the\nshoulder. I looked up, with a flush upon my face and remorse in my\nheart, but Mr. Mell's eyes were fixed on Steerforth. He continued to pat\nme kindly on the shoulder, but he looked at him.\n\n\"Since you expect me, Mr. Creakle, to justify myself,\" said Steerforth,\n\"and to say what I mean,--what I have to say is, that his mother lives\non charity in an alms-house.\"\n\nMr. Mell still looked at him, and still patted me kindly on the\nshoulder, and said to himself, in a whisper, if I heard right: \"Yes, I\nthought so.\"\n\nMr. Creakle turned to his assistant, with a severe frown and labored\npoliteness.\n\n\"Now, you hear what this gentleman says, Mr. Mell. Have the goodness, if\nyou please, to set him right before the assembled school.\"\n\n\"He is right, sir, without correction,\" returned Mr. Mell, in the midst\nof a dead silence; \"what he has said, is true.\"\n\n\"Be so good then as declare publicly, will you,\" said Mr. Creakle,\nputting his head on one side, and rolling his eyes round the school,\n\"whether it ever came to my knowledge until this moment?\"\n\n\"I believe not directly,\" he returned.\n\n\"Why, you know not,\" said Mr. Creakle. \"Don't you, man?\"\n\n\"I apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be very\ngood,\" replied the assistant. \"You know what my position is, and always\nhas been, here.\"\n\n\"I apprehend, if you come to that,\" said Mr. Creakle, with his veins\nswelling again bigger than ever, \"that you've been in a wrong position\naltogether, and mistook this for a charity school. Mr. Mell, we'll part\nif you please. The sooner the better.\"\n\n\"There is no time,\" answered Mr. Mell, rising, \"like the present.\"\n\n\"Sir, to you!\" said Mr. Creakle.\n\n\"I take my leave of you, Mr. Creakle, and of all of you,\" said Mr. Mell,\nglancing round the room, and again patting me gently on the shoulder.\n\"James Steerforth, the best wish I can leave you is that you may come to\nbe ashamed of what you have done to-day. At present I would prefer to\nsee you anything rather than a friend, to me, or to any one in whom I\nfeel an interest.\"\n\nOnce more he laid his hand upon my shoulder; and then taking his flute\nand a few books from his desk, and leaving the key in it for his\nsuccessor, he went out of the school, with his property under his arm.\nMr. Creakle then made a speech, through Tungay, in which he thanked\nSteerforth for asserting (though perhaps too warmly) the independence\nand respectability of Salem House; and which he wound up by shaking\nhands with Steerforth, while we gave three cheers--I did not quite know\nwhat for, but I supposed for Steerforth, and so joined in them ardently,\nthough I felt miserable. Mr. Creakle then caned Tommy Traddles for being\ndiscovered in tears, instead of cheers, on account of Mr. Mell's\ndeparture; and went back to his sofa, or his bed, or wherever he had\ncome from.\n\nWe were left to ourselves now, and looked very blank, I recollect, on\none another. For myself, I felt so much self-reproach and contrition for\nmy part in what had happened, that nothing would have enabled me to keep\nback my tears but the fear that Steerforth, who often looked at me, I\nsaw, might think it unfriendly--or, I should rather say, considering our\nrelative ages, and the feeling with which I regarded him, undutiful--if\nI showed the emotion which distressed me. He was very angry with\nTraddles, and said he was glad he had caught it.\n\nPoor Traddles, who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the\ndesk, and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons, said\nhe didn't care. Mr. Mell was ill-used.\n\n\"Who has ill-used him, you girl?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Why, you have,\" returned Traddles.\n\n\"What have I done?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"What have you done?\" retorted Traddles. \"Hurt his feelings, and lost\nhim his situation.\"\n\n\"His feelings!\" repeated Steerforth disdainfully. \"His feelings will\nsoon get the better of it, I'll be bound. His feelings are not like\nyours, Miss Traddles. As to his situation--which was a precious one,\nwasn't it?--do you suppose I am not going to write home, and take care\nthat he gets some money? Polly?\"\n\nWe thought this intention very noble in Steerforth, whose mother was a\nwidow, and rich, and would do almost anything, it was said, that he\nasked her. We were all extremely glad to see Traddles so put down, and\nexalted Steerforth to the skies: especially when he told us, as he\ncondescended to do, that what he had done had been done expressly for\nus, and for our cause; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by\nunselfishly doing it.\n\nBut I must say that when I was going on with a story in the dark that\nnight, Mr. Mell's old flute seemed more than once to sound mournfully in\nmy ears; and that when at last Steerforth was tired, and I lay down in\nmy bed, I fancied it playing so sorrowfully somewhere, that I was quite\nwretched.\n\nI soon forgot him in the contemplation of Steerforth, who, in an easy\namateur way, and without any book (he seemed to me to know everything by\nheart), took some of his classes until a new master was found. The new\nmaster came from a grammar-school; and before he entered on his duties,\ndined in the parlor one day to be introduced to Steerforth. Steerforth\napproved of him highly, and told us he was a Brick. Without exactly\nunderstanding what learned distinction was meant by this, I respected\nhim greatly for it, and had no doubt whatever of his superior knowledge:\nthough he never took the pains with me--not that _I_ was anybody--that\nMr. Mell had taken.\n\nThere was only one other event in this half-year, out of the daily\nschool-life, that made an impression on me which still survives. It\nsurvives for many reasons.\n\nOne afternoon, when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion,\nand Mr. Creakle was laying about him dreadfully, Tungay came in, and\ncalled out in his usual strong way: \"Visitors for Copperfield!\"\n\nA few words were interchanged between him and Mr. Creakle, as, who the\nvisitors were, and what room they were to be shown into; and then I, who\nhad, according to custom, stood up on the announcement being made, and\nfelt quite faint with astonishment, was told to go by the back stairs\nand get a clean frill on, before I repaired to the dining-room. These\norders I obeyed, in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as I\nhad never known before; and when I got to the parlor-door, and the\nthought came into my head that it might be my mother--I had only thought\nof Mr. or Miss Murdstone until then--I drew back my hand from the lock,\nand stopped to have a sob before I went in.\n\nAt first I saw nobody; but feeling a pressure against the door, I\nlooked round it, and there, to my amazement, were Mr. Peggotty and Ham,\nducking at me with their hats, and squeezing one another against the\nwall. I could not help laughing; but it was much more in the pleasure\nof seeing them, than at the appearance they made. We shook hands in\na very cordial way; and I laughed and laughed, until I pulled out my\npocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes.\n\nMr. Peggotty (who never shut his mouth once, I remember, during the\nvisit) showed great concern when he saw me do this, and nudged Ham to\nsay something.\n\n\"Cheer up, Mas'r Davy bor'!\" said Ham, in his simpering way. \"Why, how\nyou have growed!\"\n\n\"Am I grown?\" I said, drying my eyes. I was not crying at anything\nparticular that I know of; but somehow it made me cry to see old\nfriends.\n\n\"Growed, Mas'r Davy bor'? Ain't he growed!\" said Ham.\n\n\"Ain't he growed!\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\nThey made me laugh again by laughing at each other, and then we all\nthree laughed until I was in danger of crying again.\n\n\"Do you know how mama is, Mr. Peggotty?\" I said. \"And how my dear, dear,\nold Peggotty is?\"\n\n\"Oncommon,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"And little Em'ly, and Mrs. Gummidge?\"\n\n\"On--common,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\nThere was a silence. Mr. Peggotty, to relieve it, took two prodigious\nlobsters, and an enormous crab, and a large canvas bag of shrimps, out\nof his pockets, and piled them up in Ham's arms.\n\n\"You see,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"knowing as you was partial to a little\nrelish with your wittles when you was along with us, we took the\nliberty. The old Mawther biled 'em, she did. Mrs. Gummidge biled 'em.\nYes,\" said Mr. Peggotty slowly, who I thought appeared to stick to the\nsubject on account of having no other subject ready, \"Mrs. Gummidge, I\ndo assure you, she biled 'em.\"\n\nI expressed my thanks; and Mr. Peggotty, after looking at Ham, who stood\nsmiling sheepishly over the shell-fish, without making any attempt to\nhelp him, said:\n\n\"We come, you see, the wind and tide making in our favor, in one of\nour Yarmouth lugs to Gravesen'. My sister she wrote to me the name\nof this here place, and wrote to me as if ever I chanced to come to\nGravesen', I was to come over and enquire for Mas'r Davy and give her\ndooty, humbly wishing him well and reporting of the fam'ly as they was\noncommon toe-be-sure. Little Em'ly, you see, she'll write to my sister\nwhen I go back, as I see you and as you was similarly oncommon, and so\nwe make it quite a merry-go-rounder.\"\n\nI was obliged to consider a little before I understood what Mr. Peggotty\nmeant by this figure, expressive of a complete circle of intelligence. I\nthen thanked him heartily; and said, with a consciousness of reddening,\nthat I supposed Little Em'ly was altered too, since we used to pick up\nshells and pebbles on the beach?\n\n\"She's getting to be a woman, that's wot she's getting to be,\" said Mr.\nPeggotty. \"Ask him.\"\n\nHe meant Ham, who beamed with delight and assent over the bag of\nshrimps.\n\n\"Her pretty face!\" said Mr. Peggotty, with his own shining like a light.\n\n\"Her learning!\" said Ham.\n\n\"Her writing!\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Why, it's as black as jet! And so\nlarge it is, you might see it anywheres.\"\n\nIt was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm Mr. Peggotty\nbecame inspired when he thought of his little favorite. He stands before\nme again, his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride,\nfor which I can find no description. His honest eyes fire up, and\nsparkle, as if their depths were stirred by something bright. His broad\nchest heaves with pleasure. His strong loose hands clench themselves, in\nhis earnestness; and he emphasises what he says with a right arm that\nshows, in my pigmy view, like a sledge hammer.\n\nHam was quite as earnest as he. I dare say they would have said much\nmore about her, if they had not been abashed by the unexpected coming in\nof Steerforth, who, seeing me in a corner speaking with two strangers,\nstopped in a song he was singing, and said: \"I didn't know you were\nhere, young Copperfield!\" (for it was not the usual visiting room), and\ncrossed by us on his way out.\n\nI am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as\nSteerforth, or in the desire to explain to him how I came to have such a\nfriend as Mr. Peggotty, that I called to him as he was going away. But I\nsaid, modestly--Good Heaven, how it all comes back to me this long time\nafterwards!--\n\n\"Don't go, Steerforth, if you please. These are two Yarmouth\nboatmen--very kind, good people--who are relations of my nurse, and\nhave come from Gravesend to see me.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye?\" said Steerforth, returning. \"I am glad to see them. How are\nyou both?\"\n\nThere was an ease in his manner--a gay and light manner it was, but not\nswaggering--which I still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment\nwith it. I still believe him, in virtue of this carriage, his animal\nspirits, his delightful voice, his handsome face and figure, and, for\naught I know, of some inborn power of attraction besides (which I think\na few people possess), to have carried a spell with him to which it was\na natural weakness to yield, and which not many persons could withstand.\nI could not but see how pleased they were with him, and how they seemed\nto open their hearts to him in a moment.\n\n\"You must let them know at home, if you please, Mr. Peggotty,\" I said,\n\"when that letter is sent, that Mr. Steerforth is very kind to me, and\nthat I don't know what I should ever do here without him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Steerforth, laughing. \"You mustn't tell them anything\nof the sort.\"\n\n\"And if Mr. Steerforth ever comes into Norfolk or Suffolk, Mr.\nPeggotty,\" I said, \"while I am there, you may depend upon it I shall\nbring him to Yarmouth, if he will let me, to see your house. You never\nsaw such a good house, Steerforth. It's made out of a boat!\"\n\n\"Made out of a boat, is it?\" said Steerforth. \"It's the right sort of\nhouse for such a thorough-built boatman.\"\n\n\"So 'tis, sir, so 'tis, sir,\" said Ham, grinning. \"You're right, young\ngen'lm'n. Mas'r Davy bor', gen'lm'n 's right. A thorough-built boatman!\nHor, hor! That's what he is, too!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew, though his modesty\nforbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, bowing and chuckling, and tucking in the ends of\nhis neckerchief at his breast, \"I thankee, sir, I thankee! I do my\nendeavours in my line of life, sir.\"\n\n\"The best of men can do no more, Mr. Peggotty,\" said Steerforth. He had\ngot his name already.\n\n\"I'll pound it, it's wot you do yourself, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty,\nshaking his head, \"and wot you do well--right well! I thankee, sir. I'm\nobleeged to you, sir, for your welcoming manner of me. I'm rough, sir,\nbut I'm ready--least ways, I _hope_ I'm ready, you understand. My house\nain't much for to see, sir, but it's hearty at your service if ever you\nshould come along with Mas'r Davy to see it. I'm a reg'lar Dodman, I\nam,\" said Mr. Peggotty; by which he meant snail, and this was in\nallusion to his being slow to go, for he had attempted to go after every\nsentence, and had somehow or other come back again; \"but I wish you both\nwell, and I wish you happy!\"\n\nHam echoed this sentiment, and we parted with them in the heartiest\nmanner. I was almost tempted that evening to tell Steerforth about\npretty little Em'ly, but I was too timid of mentioning her name, and too\nmuch afraid of his laughing at me. I remember that I thought a good\ndeal, and in an uneasy sort of way, about Mr. Peggotty having said that\nshe was getting on to be a woman; but I decided that was nonsense.\n\nWe transported the shell-fish, or the \"relish\" as Mr. Peggotty had\nmodestly called it, up into our room unobserved, and made a great supper\nthat evening. But Traddles couldn't get happily out of it. He was too\nunfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else. He was\ntaken ill in the night--quite prostrate he was--in consequence of Crab;\nand after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills, to an extent\nwhich Demple (whose father was a doctor) said was enough to undermine a\nhorse's constitution, received a caning and six chapters of Greek\nTestament for refusing to confess.\n\nThe rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the\ndaily strife and struggle of our lives; of the waning summer and the\nchanging season; of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed,\nand the cold, cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into\nbed again; of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently\nwarmed, and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great\nshivering-machine; of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef,\nand boiled mutton with roast mutton; of clods of bread-and-butter,\ndog's-eared lesson-books, cracked slates, tear-blotted copy-books,\ncanings, rulerings, hair-cuttings, rainy Sundays, suet puddings, and a\ndirty atmosphere of ink surrounding all.\n\nI well remember though, how the distant idea of the holidays, after\nseeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck, began to come\ntowards us, and to grow and grow. How, from counting months, we came to\nweeks, and then to days; and how I then began to be afraid that I should\nnot be sent for, and, when I learnt from Steerforth that I _had_ been\nsent for and was certainly to go home, had dim forebodings that I might\nbreak my leg first. How the breaking-up day changed its place fast, at\nlast, from the week after next to next week, this week, the day after\nto-morrow, to-morrow, to-day, to-night--when I was inside the Yarmouth\nmail, and going home.\n\nI had many a broken sleep inside the Yarmouth mail, and many an\nincoherent dream of all these things. But when I awoke at intervals, the\nground outside the window was not the playground of Salem House, and the\nsound in my ears was not the sound of Mr. Creakle giving it to Traddles,\nbut the sound of the coachman touching up the horses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nMY HOLIDAYS. ESPECIALLY ONE HAPPY AFTERNOON.\n\n\nWhen we arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped, which was\nnot the inn where my friend the waiter lived, I was shown up to a nice\nlittle bedroom, with DOLPHIN painted on the door. Very cold I was I\nknow, notwithstanding the hot tea they had given me before a large fire\ndown-stairs; and very glad I was to turn into the Dolphin's bed, pull\nthe Dolphin's blankets round my head, and go to sleep.\n\nMr. Barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine\no'clock. I got up at eight, a little giddy from the shortness of my\nnight's rest, and was ready for him before the appointed time. He\nreceived me exactly as if not five minutes had elapsed since we were\nlast together, and I had only been into the hotel to get change for\nsixpence, or something of that sort.\n\nAs soon as I and my box were in the cart, and the carrier seated, the\nlazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace.\n\n\"You look very well, Mr. Barkis,\" I said, thinking he would like to know\nit.\n\nMr. Barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff, and then looked at his cuff\nas if he expected to find some of the bloom upon it; but made no other\nacknowledgment of the compliment.\n\n\"I gave your message, Mr. Barkis,\" I said; \"I wrote to Peggotty.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\nMr. Barkis seemed gruff, and answered drily.\n\n\"Wasn't it right, Mr. Barkis?\" I asked, after a little hesitation.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\n\"Not the message?\"\n\n\"The message was right enough, perhaps,\" said Mr. Barkis; \"but it come\nto an end there.\"\n\nNot understanding what he meant, I repeated inquisitively: \"Came to an\nend, Mr. Barkis?\"\n\n\"Nothing come of it,\" he explained, looking at me sideways. \"No answer.\"\n\n\"There was an answer expected, was there, Mr. Barkis?\" said I, opening\nmy eyes. For this was a new light to me.\n\n\"When a man says he's willin',\" said Mr. Barkis, turning his glance\nslowly on me again, \"it's as much as to say, that man's a waitin' for a\nanswer.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Barkis?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Barkis, carrying his eyes back to his horse's ears;\n\"that man's been a waitin' for a answer ever since.\"\n\n\"Have you told her so, Mr. Barkis?\"\n\n\"N--no,\" growled Mr. Barkis, reflecting about it. \"I ain't got no call\nto go and tell her so. I never said six words to her myself. _I_ ain't a\ngoin' to tell her so.\"\n\n\"Would you like me to do it, Mr. Barkis?\" said I, doubtfully.\n\n\"You might tell her, if you would,\" said Mr. Barkis, with another slow\nlook at me, \"that Barkis was a waitin' for a answer. Says you--what name\nis it?\"\n\n\"Her name?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Barkis, with a nod of his head.\n\n\"Peggotty.\"\n\n\"Chrisen name? Or nat'ral name?\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\n\"Oh, it's not her Christian name. Her Christian name is Clara.\"\n\n\"Is it though!\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\nHe seemed to find an immense fund of reflection in this circumstance,\nand sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time.\n\n\"Well!\" he resumed at length. \"Says you, 'Peggotty! Barkis is a waitin'\nfor a answer.' Says she, perhaps, 'Answer to what?' Says you, 'To what I\ntold you.' 'What is that?' says she. 'Barkis is willin',' says you.\"\n\nThis extremely artful suggestion, Mr. Barkis accompanied with a nudge of\nhis elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side. After that, he\nslouched over his horse in his usual manner; and made no other reference\nto the subject except, half an hour afterwards, taking a piece of chalk\nfrom his pocket, and writing up, inside the tilt of the cart, \"Clara\nPeggotty\"--apparently as a private memorandum.\n\nAh, what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not home,\nand to find that every object I looked at, reminded me of the happy old\nhome, which was like a dream I could never dream again! The days when my\nmother and I and Peggotty were all in all to one another, and there was\nno one to come between us, rose up before me so sorrowfully on the road,\nthat I am not sure I was glad to be there--not sure but that I would\nrather have remained away, and forgotten it in Steerforth's company. But\nthere I was; and soon I was at our house, where the bare old elm trees\nwrung their many hands in the bleak wintry air, and shreds of the old\nrooks' nests drifted away upon the wind.\n\nThe carrier put my box down at the garden gate, and left me. I walked\nalong the path towards the house, glancing at the windows, and fearing\nat every step to see Mr. Murdstone or Miss Murdstone lowering out of one\nof them. No face appeared, however; and being come to the house, and\nknowing how to open the door, before dark, without knocking, I went in\nwith a quiet, timid step.\n\nGod knows how infantine the memory may have been, that was awakened\nwithin me by the sound of my mother's voice in the old parlor, when I\nset foot in the hall. She was singing in a low tone. I think I must have\nlain in her arms, and heard her singing so to me when I was but a baby.\nThe strain was new to me, and yet it was so old that it filled my heart\nbrim-full; like a friend come back from a long absence.\n\nI believed, from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother\nmurmured her song, that she was alone. And I went softly into the room.\nShe was sitting by the fire, suckling an infant, whose tiny hand she\nheld against her neck. Her eyes were looking down upon its face, and she\nsat singing to it. I was so far right, that she had no other companion.\n\n  [Illustration: Changes at Home.]\n\nI spoke to her, and she started, and cried out. But seeing me, she\ncalled me her dear Davy, her own boy! and coming half across the room to\nmeet me, kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me, and laid my head\ndown on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there, and\nput its hand up to my lips.\n\nI wish I had died. I wish I had died then, with that feeling in my\nheart! I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been\nsince.\n\n\"He is your brother,\" said my mother, fondling me. \"Davy, my pretty boy!\nMy poor child!\" Then she kissed me more and more, and clasped me round\nthe neck. This she was doing when Peggotty came running in, and bounced\ndown on the ground beside us, and went mad about us both for a quarter\nof an hour.\n\nIt seemed that I had not been expected so soon, the carrier being much\nbefore his usual time. It seemed, too, that Mr. and Miss Murdstone had\ngone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood, and would not return before\nnight. I had never hoped for this. I had never thought it possible that\nwe three could be together undisturbed, once more; and I felt, for the\ntime, as if the old days were come back.\n\nWe dined together by the fireside. Peggotty was in attendance to wait\nupon us, but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with\nus. I had my own old plate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full\nsail upon it, which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had\nbeen away, and would not have had broken, she said, for a hundred\npounds. I had my own old mug with David on it, and my own old little\nknife and fork that wouldn't cut.\n\nWhile we were at table, I thought it a favorable occasion to tell\nPeggotty about Mr. Barkis, who, before I had finished what I had to tell\nher, began to laugh, and threw her apron over her face.\n\n\"Peggotty!\" said my mother. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nPeggotty only laughed the more, and held her apron tight over her face\nwhen my mother tried to pull it away, and sat as if her head were in a\nbag.\n\n\"What are you doing, you stupid creature?\" said my mother, laughing.\n\n\"Oh, drat the man!\" cried Peggotty. \"He wants to marry me.\"\n\n\"It would be a very good match for you; wouldn't it?\" said my mother.\n\n\"Oh! I don't know,\" said Peggotty. \"Don't ask me. I wouldn't have him if\nhe was made of gold. Nor I wouldn't have anybody.\"\n\n\"Then, why don't you tell him so, you ridiculous thing?\" said my mother.\n\n\"Tell him so,\" retorted Peggotty, looking out of her apron. \"He has\nnever said a word to me about it. He knows better. If he was to make so\nbold as say a word to me, I should slap his face.\"\n\nHer own was as red as ever I saw it, or any other face, I think; but she\nonly covered it again, for a few moments at a time, when she was taken\nwith a violent fit of laughter; and after two or three of those attacks,\nwent on with her dinner.\n\nI remarked that my mother, though she smiled when Peggotty looked at\nher, became more serious and thoughtful. I had seen at first that she\nwas changed. Her face was very pretty still, but it looked careworn, and\ntoo delicate; and her hand was so thin and white that it seemed to me to\nbe almost transparent. But the change to which I now refer was\nsuperadded to this: it was in her manner, which became anxious and\nfluttered. At last she said, putting out her hand, and laying it\naffectionately on the hand of her old servant,\n\n\"Peggotty, dear, you are not going to be married?\"\n\n\"Me, ma'am?\" returned Peggotty, staring. \"Lord bless you, no!\"\n\n\"Not just yet?\" said my mother, tenderly.\n\n\"Never!\" cried Peggotty.\n\nMy mother took her hand, and said:\n\n\"Don't leave me, Peggotty. Stay with me. It will not be for long,\nperhaps. What should I ever do without you!\"\n\n\"Me leave you, my precious!\" cried Peggotty. \"Not for all the world and\nhis wife. Why, what's put that in your silly little head?\"--For Peggotty\nhad been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child.\n\nBut my mother made no answer, except to thank her, and Peggotty went\nrunning on in her own fashion.\n\n\"Me leave you? I think I see myself. Peggotty go away from you? I should\nlike to catch her at it! No, no, no,\" said Peggotty, shaking her head,\nand folding her arms; \"not she, my dear. It isn't that there ain't some\nCats that would be well enough pleased if she did, but they shan't be\npleased. They shall be aggravated. I'll stay with you till I am a cross\ncranky old woman. And when I'm too deaf, and too lame, and too blind,\nand too mumbly for want of teeth, to be of any use at all, even to be\nfound fault with, then I shall go to my Davy, and ask him to take me\nin.\"\n\n\"And, Peggotty,\" says I, \"I shall be glad to see you, and I'll make you\nas welcome as a queen.\"\n\n\"Bless your dear heart!\" cried Peggotty. \"I know you will!\" And she\nkissed me beforehand, in grateful acknowledgment of my hospitality.\nAfter that, she covered her head up with her apron again, and had\nanother laugh about Mr. Barkis. After that, she took the baby out\nof its little cradle, and nursed it. After that, she cleared the\ndinner-table; after that, came in with another cap on, and her\nwork-box, and the yard-measure, and the bit of wax candle, all just the\nsame as ever.\n\nWe sat round the fire, and talked delightfully. I told them what a\nhard master Mr. Creakle was, and they pitied me very much. I told them\nwhat a fine fellow Steerforth was, and what a patron of mine, and\nPeggotty said she would walk a score of miles to see him. I took the\nlittle baby in my arms when it was awake, and nursed it lovingly. When\nit was asleep again, I crept close to my mother's side according to\nmy old custom, broken now a long time, and sat with my arms embracing\nher waist, and my little red cheek on her shoulder, and once more felt\nher beautiful hair drooping over me--like an angel's wing as I used to\nthink, I recollect--and was very happy indeed.\n\nWhile I sat thus, looking at the fire, and seeing pictures in the\nred-hot coals, I almost believed that I had never been away; that Mr.\nand Miss Murdstone were such pictures, and would vanish when the fire\ngot low; and that there was nothing real in all that I remembered, save\nmy mother, Peggotty, and I.\n\nPeggotty darned away at a stocking as long as she could see, and then\nsat with it drawn on her left hand like a glove, and her needle in her\nright, ready to take another stitch whenever there was a blaze. I cannot\nconceive whose stockings they can have been that Peggotty was always\ndarning, or where such an unfailing supply of stockings in want of\ndarning can have come from. From my earliest infancy she seems to have\nbeen always employed in that class of needlework, and never by any\nchance in any other.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Peggotty, who was sometimes seized with a fit of\nwondering on some most unexpected topic, \"what's become of Davy's\ngreat-aunt?\"\n\n\"Lor, Peggotty!\" observed my mother, rousing herself from a reverie,\n\"what nonsense you talk!\"\n\n\"Well, but I really do wonder, ma'am,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"What can have put such a person in your head?\" inquired my mother. \"Is\nthere nobody else in the world to come there?\"\n\n\"I don't know how it is,\" said Peggotty, \"unless it's on account of\nbeing stupid, but my head never can pick and choose its people. They\ncome and they go, and they don't come and they don't go, just as they\nlike. I wonder what's become of her?\"\n\n\"How absurd you are, Peggotty,\" returned my mother. \"One would suppose\nyou wanted a second visit from her.\"\n\n\"Lord forbid!\" cried Peggotty.\n\n\"Well then, don't talk about such uncomfortable things, there's a good\nsoul,\" said my mother. \"Miss Betsey is shut up in her cottage by the\nsea, no doubt, and will remain there. At all events, she is not likely\never to trouble us again.\"\n\n\"No!\" mused Peggotty. \"No, that ain't likely at all.--I wonder, if she\nwas to die, whether she'd leave Davy anything?\"\n\n\"Good gracious me, Peggotty,\" returned my mother, \"what a nonsensical\nwoman you are! when you know that she took offence at the poor dear\nboy's ever being born at all!\"\n\n\"I suppose she wouldn't be inclined to forgive him now,\" hinted\nPeggotty.\n\n\"Why should she be inclined to forgive him now?\" said my mother, rather\nsharply.\n\n\"Now that he's got a brother, I mean,\" said Peggotty.\n\nMy mother immediately began to cry, and wondered how Peggotty dared to\nsay such a thing.\n\n\"As if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to\nyou or anybody else, you jealous thing!\" said she. \"You had much better\ngo and marry Mr. Barkis, the carrier. Why don't you?\"\n\n\"I should make Miss Murdstone happy, if I was to,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"What a bad disposition you have, Peggotty!\" returned my mother. \"You\nare as jealous of Miss Murdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous\ncreature to be. You want to keep the keys yourself, and give out all the\nthings, I suppose? I shouldn't be surprised if you did. When you know\nthat she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions! You know\nshe does, Peggotty--you know it well.\"\n\nPeggotty muttered something to the effect of \"Bother the best\nintentions!\" and something else to the effect that there was a little\ntoo much of the best intentions going on.\n\n\"I know what you mean, you cross thing,\" said my mother. \"I understand\nyou, Peggotty, perfectly. You know I do, and I wonder you don't color\nup like fire. But one point at a time. Miss Murdstone is the point\nnow, Peggotty, and you sha'n't escape from it. Haven't you heard her\nsay, over and over again, that she thinks I am too thoughtless and\ntoo--a--a--\"\n\n\"Pretty,\" suggested Peggotty.\n\n\"Well,\" returned my mother, half laughing, \"and if she is so silly as to\nsay so, can I be blamed for it?\"\n\n\"No one says you can,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"No, I should hope not, indeed!\" returned my mother. \"Haven't you heard\nher say, over and over again, that on this account she wishes to spare\nme a great deal of trouble, which she thinks I am not suited for, and\nwhich I really don't know myself that I _am_ suited for; and isn't she\nup early and late, and going to and fro continually--and doesn't she do\nall sorts of things, and grope into all sorts of places, coal-holes and\npantries and I don't know where, that can't be very agreeable--and do\nyou mean to insinuate that there is not a sort of devotion in that?\"\n\n\"I don't insinuate at all,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"You do, Peggotty,\" returned my mother. \"You never do anything else,\nexcept your work. You are always insinuating. You revel in it. And when\nyou talk of Mr. Murdstone's good intentions--\"\n\n\"I never talked of 'em,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"No, Peggotty,\" returned my mother, \"but you insinuated. That's what I\ntold you just now. That's the worst of you. You _will_ insinuate. I\nsaid, at the moment, that I understood you, and you see I did. When you\ntalk of Mr. Murdstone's good intentions, and pretend to slight them (for\nI don't believe you really do, in your heart, Peggotty), you must be as\nwell convinced as I am how good they are, and how they actuate him in\neverything. If he seems to have been at all stern with a certain person,\nPeggotty--you understand, and so I am sure does Davy, that I am not\nalluding to any body present--it is solely because he is satisfied that\nit is for a certain person's benefit. He naturally loves a certain\nperson, on my account; and acts solely for a certain person's good. He\nis better able to judge of it than I am; for I very well know that I am\na weak, light, girlish creature, and that he is a firm, grave, serious\nman. And he takes,\" said my mother, with the tears which were engendered\nin her affectionate nature, stealing down her face, \"he takes great\npains with me; and I ought to be very thankful to him, and very\nsubmissive to him even in my thoughts; and when I am not, Peggotty, I\nworry and condemn myself, and feel doubtful of my own heart, and don't\nknow what to do.\"\n\nPeggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking, looking silently\nat the fire.\n\n\"There, Peggotty,\" said my mother, changing her tone, \"don't let us fall\nout with one another, for I couldn't bear it. You are my true friend, I\nknow, if I have any in the world. When I call you a ridiculous creature,\nor a vexatious thing, or anything of that sort, Peggotty, I only mean\nthat you are my true friend, and always have been, ever since the night\nwhen Mr. Copperfield first brought me home here, and you came out to the\ngate to meet me.\"\n\nPeggotty was not slow to respond, and ratified the treaty of friendship\nby giving me one of her best hugs. I think I had some glimpses of the\nreal character of this conversation at the time; but I am sure, now,\nthat the good creature originated it, and took her part in it, merely\nthat my mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory\nsummary in which she had indulged. The design was efficacious; for I\nremember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the\nevening, and that Peggotty observed her less.\n\nWhen we had had our tea, and the ashes were thrown up, and the candles\nsnuffed, I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile Book, in\nremembrance of old times--she took it out of her pocket: I don't know\nwhether she had kept it there ever since--and then we talked about Salem\nHouse, which brought me round again to Steerforth, who was my great\nsubject. We were very happy; and that evening, as the last of its race,\nand destined evermore to close that volume of my life, will never pass\nout of my memory.\n\nIt was almost ten o'clock before we heard the sound of wheels. We all\ngot up then; and my mother said hurriedly that, as it was so late, and\nMr. and Miss Murdstone approved of early hours for young people, perhaps\nI had better go to bed. I kissed her, and went up-stairs with my candle\ndirectly, before they came in. It appeared to my childish fancy, as I\nascended to the bedroom where I had been imprisoned, that they brought a\ncold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar\nfeeling like a feather.\n\nI felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning, as I\nhad never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I committed my\nmemorable offence. However, as it must be done, I went down, after two\nor three false starts half-way, and as many runs back on tiptoe to my\nown room, and presented myself in the parlor.\n\nHe was standing before the fire with his back to it, while Miss\nMurdstone made the tea. He looked at me steadily as I entered, but made\nno sign of recognition whatever.\n\nI went up to him, after a moment of confusion, and said: \"I beg your\npardon, sir. I am very sorry for what I did, and I hope you will forgive\nme.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you are sorry, David,\" he replied.\n\nThe hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten. I could not restrain my\neye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it; but it was not so\nred as I turned, when I met that sinister expression in his face.\n\n\"How do you do, ma'am,\" I said to Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"Ah, dear me!\" sighed Miss Murdstone, giving me the tea-caddy scoop\ninstead of her fingers. \"How long are the holidays?\"\n\n\"A month, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Counting from when?\"\n\n\"From to-day, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Miss Murdstone. \"Then here's _one_ day off.\"\n\nShe kept a calendar of the holidays in this way, and every morning\nchecked a day off in exactly the same manner. She did it gloomily until\nshe came to ten, but when she got into two figures she became more\nhopeful, and, as the time advanced, even jocular.\n\nIt was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her,\nthough she was not subject to such weaknesses in general, into a state\nof violent consternation. I came into the room where she and my mother\nwere sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on my\nmother's lap, I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss\nMurdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it.\n\n\"My dear Jane!\" cried my mother.\n\n\"Good heavens, Clara, do you see?\" exclaimed Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"See what, my dear Jane?\" said my mother; \"where?\"\n\n\"He's got it!\" cried Miss Murdstone. \"The boy has got the baby!\"\n\nShe was limp with horror; but stiffened herself to make a dart at me,\nand take it out of my arms. Then, she turned faint; and was so very ill,\nthat they were obliged to give her cherry-brandy. I was solemnly\ninterdicted by her, on her recovery, from touching my brother any more\non any pretence whatever; and my poor mother, who, I could see, wished\notherwise, meekly confirmed the interdict, by saying: \"No doubt you are\nright, my dear Jane.\"\n\nOn another occasion, when we three were together, this same dear\nbaby--it was truly dear to me, for our mother's sake--was the innocent\noccasion of Miss Murdstone's going into a passion. My mother, who had\nbeen looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap, said:\n\n\"Davy! come here!\" and looked at mine.\n\nI saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down.\n\n\"I declare,\" said my mother, gently, \"they are exactly alike. I suppose\nthey are mine. I think they are the color of mine. But they are\nwonderfully alike.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Clara?\" said Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"My dear Jane,\" faltered my mother, a little abashed by the harsh tone\nof this inquiry, \"I find that the baby's eyes and Davy's are exactly\nalike.\"\n\n\"Clara!\" said Miss Murdstone, rising angrily, \"you are a positive fool\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"My dear Jane,\" remonstrated my mother.\n\n\"A positive fool,\" said Miss Murdstone. \"Who else could compare my\nbrother's baby with your boy? They are not at all alike. They are\nexactly unlike. They are utterly dissimilar in all respects. I hope they\nwill ever remain so. I will not sit here, and hear such comparisons\nmade.\" With that she stalked out, and made the door bang after her.\n\nIn short, I was not a favorite with Miss Murdstone. In short, I was not\na favorite there with anybody, not even with myself; for those who did\nlike me could not show it, and those who did not, showed it so plainly\nthat I had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained,\nboorish, and dull.\n\nI felt that I made them as uncomfortable as they made me. If I came\ninto the room where they were, and they were talking together and my\nmother seemed cheerful, an anxious cloud would steal over her face from\nthe moment of my entrance. If Mr. Murdstone were in his best humor,\nI checked him. If Miss Murdstone were in her worst, I intensified\nit. I had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim\nalways; that she was afraid to speak to me or be kind to me, lest she\nshould give them some offence by her manner of doing so, and receive a\nlecture afterwards; that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own\noffending, but of my offending, and uneasily watched their looks if I\nonly moved. Therefore I resolved to keep myself as much out of their\nway as I could; and many a wintry hour did I hear the church-clock\nstrike, when I was sitting in my cheerless bedroom, wrapped in my\nlittle great-coat, poring over a book.\n\nIn the evening, sometimes, I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen.\nThere I was comfortable, and not afraid of being myself. But neither of\nthese resources was approved of in the parlor. The tormenting humor\nwhich was dominant there stopped them both. I was still held to be\nnecessary to my poor mother's training, and, as one of her trials, could\nnot be suffered to absent myself.\n\n\"David,\" said Mr. Murdstone, one day after dinner when I was going to\nleave the room as usual; \"I am sorry to observe that you are of a sullen\ndisposition.\"\n\n\"As sulky as a bear!\" said Miss Murdstone.\n\nI stood still, and hung my head.\n\n\"Now, David,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \"a sullen obdurate disposition is, of\nall tempers, the worst.\"\n\n\"And the boy's is, of all such dispositions that ever I have seen,\"\nremarked his sister, \"the most confirmed and stubborn. I think, my dear\nClara, even you must observe it?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Jane,\" said my mother, \"but are you quite\nsure--I am certain you'll excuse me, my dear Jane--that you understand\nDavy?\"\n\n\"I should be somewhat ashamed of myself, Clara,\" returned Miss\nMurdstone, \"if I could not understand the boy, or any boy. I don't\nprofess to be profound; but I do lay claim to common sense.\"\n\n\"No doubt, my dear Jane,\" returned my mother, \"your understanding is\nvery vigorous--\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no! Pray don't say that, Clara,\" interposed Miss Murdstone,\nangrily.\n\n\"But I am sure it is,\" resumed my mother; \"and everybody knows it is. I\nprofit so much by it myself, in many ways--at least I ought to--that no\none can be more convinced of it than myself; and therefore I speak with\ngreat diffidence, my dear Jane, I assure you.\"\n\n\"We'll say I don't understand the boy, Clara,\" returned Miss Murdstone,\narranging the little fetters on her wrists. \"We'll agree, if you please,\nthat I don't understand him at all. He is much too deep for me. But\nperhaps my brother's penetration may enable him to have some insight\ninto his character. And I believe my brother was speaking on the subject\nwhen we--not very decently--interrupted him.\"\n\n\"I think, Clara,\" said Mr. Murdstone, in a low, grave voice, \"that there\nmay be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than\nyou.\"\n\n\"Edward,\" replied my mother, timidly, \"you are a far better judge of all\nquestions than I pretend to be. Both you and Jane are. I only said--\"\n\n\"You only said something weak and inconsiderate,\" he replied. \"Try not\nto do it again, my dear Clara, and keep a watch upon yourself.\"\n\nMy mother's lips moved, as if she answered \"Yes, my dear Edward,\" but\nshe said nothing aloud.\n\n\"I was sorry, David, I remarked,\" said Mr. Murdstone, turning his head\nand his eyes stiffly towards me, \"to observe that you are of a sullen\ndisposition. This is not a character that I can suffer to develop itself\nbeneath my eyes without an effort at improvement. You must endeavour,\nsir, to change it. We must endeavour to change it for you.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" I faltered. \"I have never meant to be sullen\nsince I came back.\"\n\n\"Don't take refuge in a lie, sir!\" he returned so fiercely, that I saw\nmy mother involuntarily put out her trembling hand as if to interpose\nbetween us. \"You have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own\nroom. You have kept your own room when you ought to have been here. You\nknow now, once for all, that I require you to be here, and not there.\nFurther, that I require you to bring obedience here. You know me, David.\nI will have it done.\"\n\nMiss Murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle.\n\n\"I will have a respectful, prompt, and ready bearing towards myself,\" he\ncontinued, \"and towards Jane Murdstone, and towards your mother. I will\nnot have this room shunned as if it were infected, at the pleasure of a\nchild. Sit down.\"\n\nHe ordered me like a dog, and I obeyed like a dog.\n\n\"One thing more,\" he said. \"I observe that you have an attachment to low\nand common company. You are not to associate with servants. The kitchen\nwill not improve you, in the many respects in which you need\nimprovement. Of the woman who abets you, I say nothing--since you,\nClara,\" addressing my mother in a lower voice, \"from old associations\nand long-established fancies, have a weakness respecting her which is\nnot yet overcome.\"\n\n\"A most unaccountable delusion it is!\" cried Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"I only say,\" he resumed, addressing me, \"that I disapprove of your\npreferring such company as Mistress Peggotty, and that it is to be\nabandoned. Now, David, you understand me, and you know what will be the\nconsequence if you fail to obey me to the letter.\"\n\nI knew well--better perhaps than he thought, as far as my poor mother\nwas concerned--and I obeyed him to the letter. I retreated to my own\nroom no more; I took refuge with Peggotty no more; but sat wearily in\nthe parlor day after day, looking forward to night, and bedtime.\n\nWhat irksome constraint I underwent, sitting in the same attitude hours\nupon hours, afraid to move an arm or a leg lest Miss Murdstone should\ncomplain (as she did on the least pretence) of my restlessness, and\nafraid to move an eye lest it should light on some look of dislike or\nscrutiny that would find new cause for complaint in mine! What\nintolerable dulness to sit listening to the ticking of the clock; and\nwatching Miss Murdstone's little shiny steel beads as she strung them;\nand wondering whether she would ever be married, and if so, to what sort\nof unhappy man; and counting the divisions in the moulding on the\nchimney-piece; and wandering away, with my eyes, to the ceiling, among\nthe curls and corkscrews in the paper on the wall!\n\nWhat walks I took alone, down muddy lanes, in the bad winter weather,\ncarrying that parlor, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone in it, everywhere: a\nmonstrous load that I was obliged to bear, a daymare that there was no\npossibility of breaking in, a weight that brooded on my wits, and\nblunted them!\n\nWhat meals I had in silence and embarrassment, always feeling that there\nwere a knife and fork too many, and that mine; an appetite too many, and\nthat mine; a plate and chair too many, and those mine; a somebody too\nmany, and that I!\n\nWhat evenings, when the candles came, and I was expected to employ\nmyself, but, not daring to read an entertaining book, pored over some\nhard-headed, harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic; when the tables of\nweights and measures set themselves to tunes, as Rule Britannia, or Away\nwith Melancholy; and wouldn't stand still to be learnt, but would go\nthreading my grandmother's needle through my unfortunate head, in at one\near and out at the other!\n\nWhat yawns and dozes I lapsed into, in spite of all my care; what starts\nI came out of concealed sleeps with; what answers I never got, to little\nobservations that I rarely made; what a blank space I seemed, which\neverybody overlooked, and yet was in everybody's way; what a heavy\nrelief it was to hear Miss Murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at\nnight, and order me to bed!\n\nThus the holidays lagged away, until the morning came when Miss\nMurdstone said: \"Here's the last day off!\" and gave me the closing cup\nof tea of the vacation.\n\nI was not sorry to go. I had lapsed into a stupid state; but I was\nrecovering a little and looking forward to Steerforth, albeit Mr.\nCreakle loomed behind him. Again Mr. Barkis appeared at the gate, and\nagain Miss Murdstone in her warning voice said: \"Clara!\" when my mother\nbent over me, to bid me farewell.\n\nI kissed her, and my baby brother, and was very sorry then; but not\nsorry to go away, for the gulf between us was there, and the parting was\nthere, every day. And it is not so much the embrace she gave me, that\nlives in my mind, though it was as fervent as could be, as what followed\nthe embrace.\n\nI was in the carrier's cart when I heard her calling to me. I looked\nout, and she stood at the garden-gate alone, holding her baby up in her\narms for me to see. It was cold still weather; and not a hair of her\nhead, or a fold of her dress, was stirred, as she looked intently at me,\nholding up her child.\n\nSo I lost her. So I saw her afterwards, in my sleep at school--a silent\npresence near my bed--looking at me with the same intent face--holding\nup her baby in her arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nI HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY.\n\n\nI pass over all that happened at school, until the anniversary of my\nbirthday came round in March. Except that Steerforth was more to be\nadmired than ever, I remember nothing. He was going away at the end of\nthe half-year, if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than\nbefore in my eyes, and therefore more engaging than before; but beyond\nthis I remember nothing. The great remembrance by which that time is\nmarked in my mind, seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections,\nand to exist alone.\n\nIt is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two\nmonths between my return to Salem House and the arrival of that\nbirthday. I can only understand that the fact was so, because I know it\nmust have been so; otherwise I should feel convinced that there was no\ninterval, and that the one occasion trod upon the other's heels.\n\nHow well I recollect the kind of day it was! I smell the fog that hung\nabout the place; I see the hoar frost, ghostly, through it; I feel my\nrimy hair fall clammy on my cheek; I look along the dim perspective of\nthe schoolroom, with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the\nfoggy morning, and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the\nraw cold as they blow upon their fingers, and tap their feet upon the\nfloor.\n\nIt was after breakfast, and we had been summoned in from the playground,\nwhen Mr. Sharp entered and said:\n\n\"David Copperfield is to go into the parlor.\"\n\nI expected a hamper from Peggotty, and brightened at the order. Some of\nthe boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the\ndistribution of the good things, as I got out of my seat with great\nalacrity.\n\n\"Don't hurry, David,\" said Mr. Sharp. \"There's time enough, my boy,\ndon't hurry.\"\n\nI might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke, if I\nhad given it a thought; but I gave it none until afterwards. I hurried\naway to the parlor; and there I found Mr. Creakle sitting at his\nbreakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him, and Mrs. Creakle\nwith an opened letter in her hand. But no hamper.\n\n\"David Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Creakle, leading me to a sofa, and\nsitting down beside me. \"I want to speak to you very particularly. I\nhave something to tell you, my child.\"\n\nMr. Creakle, at whom of course I looked, shook his head without looking\nat me, and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast.\n\n\"You are too young to know how the world changes every day,\" said Mrs.\nCreakle, \"and how the people in it pass away. But we all have to learn\nit, David; some of us when we are young, some of us when we are old,\nsome of us at all times of our lives.\"\n\nI looked at her earnestly.\n\n\"When you came away from home at the end of the vacation,\" said Mrs.\nCreakle, after a pause, \"were they all well?\" After another pause, \"Was\nyour mama well?\"\n\nI trembled without distinctly knowing why, and still looked at her\nearnestly, making no attempt to answer.\n\n\"Because,\" said she, \"I grieve to tell you that I hear this morning your\nmama is very ill.\"\n\nA mist arose between Mrs. Creakle and me, and her figure seemed to move\nin it for an instant. Then I felt the burning tears run down my face,\nand it was steady again.\n\n\"She is very dangerously ill,\" she added.\n\nI knew all now.\n\n\"She is dead.\"\n\nThere was no need to tell me so. I had already broken out into a\ndesolate cry, and felt an orphan in the wide world.\n\nShe was very kind to me. She kept me there all day, and left me alone\nsometimes; and I cried, and wore myself to sleep, and awoke and cried\nagain. When I could cry no more, I began to think; and then the\noppression on my breast was heaviest, and my grief a dull pain that\nthere was no ease for.\n\nAnd yet my thoughts were idle; not intent on the calamity that weighed\nupon my heart, but idly loitering near it. I thought of our house shut\nup and hushed. I thought of the little baby, who, Mrs. Creakle said, had\nbeen pining away for some time, and who, they believed, would die too. I\nthought of my father's grave in the churchyard, by our house, and of my\nmother lying there beneath the tree I knew so well. I stood upon a chair\nwhen I was left alone, and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes\nwere, and how sorrowful my face. I considered, after some hours were\ngone, if my tears were really hard to flow now, as they seemed to be,\nwhat, in connexion with my loss, it would affect me most to think of\nwhen I drew near home--for I was going home to the funeral. I am\nsensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of\nthe boys, and that I was important in my affliction.\n\nIf ever child were stricken with sincere grief, I was. But I remember\nthat this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me, when I walked in\nthe playground that afternoon while the boys were in school. When I saw\nthem glancing at me out of the windows, as they went up to their\nclasses, I felt distinguished, and looked more melancholy, and walked\nslower. When school was over, and they came out and spoke to me, I felt\nit rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them, and to take\nexactly the same notice of them all, as before.\n\nI was to go home next night; not by the mail, but by the heavy\nnight-coach, which was called the Farmer, and was principally used by\ncountry-people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road.\nWe had no story-telling that evening, and Traddles insisted on lending\nme his pillow. I don't know what good he thought it would do me, for I\nhad one of my own: but it was all he had to lend, poor fellow, except\na sheet of letter-paper full of skeletons; and that he gave me at\nparting, as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of\nmind.\n\nI left Salem House upon the morrow afternoon. I little thought then that\nI left it, never to return. We travelled very slowly all night, and did\nnot get into Yarmouth before nine or ten o'clock in the morning. I\nlooked out for Mr. Barkis, but he was not there; and instead of him a\nfat, short-winded, merry-looking, little old man in black, with rusty\nlittle bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches, black stockings,\nand a broad-brimmed hat, came puffing up to the coach window, and said:\n\n\"Master Copperfield?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you come with me, young sir, if you please,\" he said, opening the\ndoor, \"and I shall have the pleasure of taking you home.\"\n\nI put my hand in his, wondering who he was, and we walked away to a\nshop in a narrow street, on which was written OMER, DRAPER, TAILOR,\nHABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &c. It was a close and stifling little\nshop; full of all sorts of clothing, made and unmade, including\none window full of beaver-hats and bonnets. We went into a little\nback-parlor behind the shop, where we found three young women at work\non a quantity of black materials, which were heaped upon the table, and\nlittle bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor.\nThere was a good fire in the room, and a breathless smell of warm black\ncrape--I did not know what the smell was then, but I know now.\n\nThe three young women, who appeared to be very industrious and\ncomfortable, raised their heads to look at me, and then went on with\ntheir work. Stitch, stitch, stitch. At the same time there came from\na workshop across a little yard outside the window, a regular sound\nof hammering that kept a kind of tune: RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat,\nRAT--tat-tat, without any variation.\n\n\"Well!\" said my conductor to one of the three young women. \"How do you\nget on, Minnie?\"\n\n\"We shall be ready by the trying-on time,\" she replied gaily, without\nlooking up. \"Don't you be afraid, father.\"\n\nMr. Omer took off his broad-brimmed hat, and sat down and panted. He was\nso fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say:\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Father!\" said Minnie, playfully. \"What a porpoise you do grow!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know how it is, my dear,\" he replied, considering about\nit. \"I _am_ rather so.\"\n\n\"You are such a comfortable man, you see,\" said Minnie. \"You take things\nso easy.\"\n\n\"No use taking 'em otherwise, my dear,\" said Mr. Omer.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" returned his daughter. \"We are all pretty gay here, thank\nHeaven! Ain't we, father?\"\n\n\"I hope so, my dear,\" said Mr. Omer. \"As I have got my breath now, I\nthink I'll measure this young scholar. Would you walk into the shop,\nMaster Copperfield?\"\n\nI preceded Mr. Omer, in compliance with his request; and after showing\nme a roll of cloth which he said was extra super, and too good mourning\nfor anything short of parents, he took my various dimensions, and put\nthem down in a book. While he was recording them he called my attention\nto his stock in trade, and to certain fashions which he said had \"just\ncome up,\" and to certain other fashions which he said had \"just gone\nout.\"\n\n\"And by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money,\"\nsaid Mr. Omer. \"But fashions are like human beings. They come in, nobody\nknows when, why, or how; and they go out, nobody knows when, why, or\nhow. Everything is like life, in my opinion, if you look at it in that\npoint of view.\"\n\nI was too sorrowful to discuss the question, which would possibly have\nbeen beyond me under any circumstances; and Mr. Omer took me back into\nthe parlor, breathing with some difficulty on the way.\n\nHe then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a door:\n\"Bring up that tea and bread-and-butter!\" which, after some time, during\nwhich I sat looking about me and thinking, and listening to the\nstitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across the\nyard, appeared on a tray, and turned out to be for me.\n\n\"I have been acquainted with you,\" said Mr. Omer, after watching me for\nsome minutes, during which I had not made much impression on the\nbreakfast, for the black things destroyed my appetite, \"I have been\nacquainted with you a long time, my young friend.\"\n\n\"Have you, sir?\"\n\n\"All your life,\" said Mr. Omer. \"I may say before it. I knew your father\nbefore you. He was five foot nine and a half, and he lays in five and\ntwen-ty foot of ground.\"\n\n\"RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat,\" across the yard.\n\n\"He lays in five and twen-ty foot of ground, if he lays in a fraction,\"\nsaid Mr. Omer, pleasantly. \"It was either his request or her direction,\nI forget which.\"\n\n\"Do you know how my little brother is, sir?\" I inquired.\n\nMr. Omer shook his head.\n\n\"RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat.\"\n\n\"He is in his mother's arms,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, poor little fellow! Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Don't mind it more than you can help,\" said Mr. Omer. \"Yes. The baby's\ndead.\"\n\nMy wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence. I left the\nscarcely-tasted breakfast, and went and rested my head on another table\nin a corner of the little room, which Minnie hastily cleared, lest I\nshould spot the mourning that was lying there with my tears. She was a\npretty good-natured girl, and put my hair away from my eyes with a soft\nkind touch; but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished her\nwork and being in good time, and was so different from me!\n\nPresently the tune left off, and a good-looking young fellow came across\nthe yard into the room. He had a hammer in his hand, and his mouth was\nfull of little nails, which he was obliged to take out before he could\nspeak.\n\n\"Well, Joram!\" said Mr. Omer. \"How do _you_ get on?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Joram. \"Done, sir.\"\n\nMinnie colored a little, and the other two girls smiled at one another.\n\n\"What! you were at it by candle-light last night, when I was at the\nclub, then? Were you?\" said Mr. Omer, shutting up one eye.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joram. \"As you said we could make a little trip of it, and\ngo over together, if it was done, Minnie and me--and you.\"\n\n\"Oh! I thought you were going to leave me out altogether,\" said Mr.\nOmer, laughing till he coughed.\n\n\"--As you was so good as to say that,\" resumed the young man, \"why I\nturned to with a will, you see. Will you give me your opinion of it?\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Mr. Omer, rising. \"My dear;\" and he stopped and turned to\nme; \"would you like to see your----\"\n\n\"No, father,\" Minnie interposed.\n\n\"I thought it might be agreeable, my dear,\" said Mr. Omer. \"But perhaps\nyou're right.\"\n\nI can't say how I knew it was my dear, dear mother's coffin that they\nwent to look at. I had never heard one making; I had never seen one that\nI know of: but it came into my mind what the noise was, while it was\ngoing on; and when the young man entered, I am sure I knew what he had\nbeen doing.\n\nThe work being now finished, the two girls, whose names I had not heard,\nbrushed the shreds and threads from their dresses, and went into the\nshop to put that to rights, and wait for customers. Minnie stayed behind\nto fold up what they had made, and pack it in two baskets. This she did\nupon her knees, humming a lively little tune the while. Joram, who I had\nno doubt was her lover, came in and stole a kiss from her while she was\nbusy (he didn't appear to mind me, at all), and said her father was gone\nfor the chaise, and he must make haste and get himself ready. Then he\nwent out again; and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket,\nand stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her\ngown, and put on her outer clothing smartly, at a little glass behind\nthe door, in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face.\n\nAll this I observed, sitting at the table in the corner with my head\nleaning on my hand, and my thoughts running on very different things.\nThe chaise soon came round to the front of the shop, and the baskets\nbeing put in first, I was put in next, and those three followed. I\nremember it as a kind of half chaise-cart, half piano-forte van, painted\nof a sombre color, and drawn by a black horse with a long tail. There\nwas plenty of room for us all.\n\nI do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life\n(I am wiser now, perhaps) as that of being with them, remembering how\nthey had been employed, and seeing them enjoy the ride. I was not angry\nwith them; I was more afraid of them, as if I were cast away among\ncreatures with whom I had no community of nature. They were very\ncheerful. The old man sat in front to drive, and the two young people\nsat behind him, and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward, the one on\none side of his chubby face and the other on the other, and made a great\ndeal of him. They would have talked to me too, but I held back, and\nmoped in my corner; scared by their love-making and hilarity, though it\nwas far from boisterous, and almost wondering that no judgment came upon\nthem for their hardness of heart.\n\nSo, when they stopped to bait the horse, and ate and drank and enjoyed\nthemselves, I could touch nothing that they touched, but kept my fast\nunbroken. So, when we reached home, I dropped out of the chaise behind,\nas quickly as possible, that I might not be in their company before\nthose solemn windows, looking blindly on me like closed eyes once\nbright. And oh, how little need I had had to think what would move me to\ntears when I came back--seeing the window of my mother's room, and next\nit that which, in the better time, was mine!\n\nI was in Peggotty's arms before I got to the door, and she took me into\nthe house. Her grief burst out when she first saw me; but she controuled\nit soon, and spoke in whispers, and walked softly, as if the dead could\nbe disturbed. She had not been in bed, I found, for a long time. She sat\nup at night still, and watched. As long as her poor dear pretty was\nabove the ground, she said, she would never desert her.\n\nMr. Murdstone took no heed of me when I went into the parlor where he\nwas, but sat by the fireside, weeping silently, and pondering in his\nelbow-chair. Miss Murdstone, who was busy at her writing-desk, which was\ncovered with letters and papers, gave me her cold finger-nails, and\nasked me, in an iron whisper, if I had been measured for my mourning.\n\nI said: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And your shirts,\" said Miss Murdstone; \"have you brought 'em home?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. I have brought home all my clothes.\"\n\nThis was all the consolation that her firmness administered to me. I do\nnot doubt that she had a choice pleasure in exhibiting what she called\nher self-command, and her firmness, and her strength of mind, and her\ncommon sense, and the whole diabolical catalogue of her unamiable\nqualities, on such an occasion. She was particularly proud of her turn\nfor business; and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and\nink, and being moved by nothing. All the rest of that day, and from\nmorning to night afterwards, she sat at that desk; scratching composedly\nwith a hard pen, speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to\neverybody; never relaxing a muscle of her face, or softening a tone of\nher voice, or appearing with an atom of her dress astray.\n\nHer brother took a book sometimes, but never read it that I saw. He\nwould open it and look at it as if he were reading, but would remain for\na whole hour without turning the leaf, and then put it down and walk to\nand fro in the room. I used to sit with folded hands watching him, and\ncounting his footsteps, hour after hour. He very seldom spoke to her,\nand never to me. He seemed to be the only restless thing, except the\nclocks, in the whole motionless house.\n\nIn these days before the funeral, I saw but little of Peggotty, except\nthat, in passing up or down stairs, I always found her close to the room\nwhere my mother and her baby lay, and except that she came to me every\nnight, and sat by my bed's head while I went to sleep. A day or two\nbefore the burial--I think it was a day or two before, but I am\nconscious of confusion in my mind about that heavy time, with nothing to\nmark its progress--she took me into the room. I only recollect that\nunderneath some white covering on the bed, with a beautiful cleanliness\nand freshness all around it, there seemed to me to lie embodied the\nsolemn stillness that was in the house; and that when she would have\nturned the cover gently back, I cried: \"Oh no! oh no!\" and held her\nhand.\n\nIf the funeral had been yesterday, I could not recollect it better. The\nvery air of the best parlor, when I went in at the door, the bright\ncondition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the\npatterns of the glasses and plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the\nodour of Miss Murdstone's dress, and our black clothes. Mr. Chillip is\nin the room, and comes to speak to me.\n\n\"And how is Master David?\" he says, kindly.\n\nI cannot tell him very well. I give him my hand, which he holds in his.\n\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Chillip, meekly smiling, with something shining in\nhis eye. \"Our little friends grow up around us. They grow out of our\nknowledge, ma'am?\"\n\nThis is to Miss Murdstone, who makes no reply.\n\n\"There is a great improvement here, ma'am?\" says Mr. Chillip.\n\nMiss Murdstone merely answers with a frown and a formal bend; Mr.\nChillip, discomfited, goes into a corner, keeping me with him, and opens\nhis mouth no more.\n\nI remark this, because I remark everything that happens, not because I\ncare about myself, or have done since I came home. And now the bell\nbegins to sound, and Mr. Omer and another come to make us ready. As\nPeggotty was wont to tell me, long ago, the followers of my father to\nthe same grave were made ready in the same room.\n\nThere are Mr. Murdstone, our neighbour Mr. Grayper, Mr. Chillip, and I.\nWhen we go out to the door, the Bearers and their load are in the\ngarden; and they move before us down the path, and past the elms, and\nthrough the gate, and into the church-yard where I have so often heard\nthe birds sing on a summer morning.\n\nWe stand around the grave. The day seems different to me from every\nother day, and the light not of the same color--of a sadder color. Now\nthere is a solemn hush, which we have brought from home with what is\nresting in the mould; and while we stand bare-headed, I hear the voice\nof the clergyman, sounding remote in the open air, and yet distinct and\nplain, saying: \"I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord!\"\nThen I hear sobs; and, standing apart among the lookers-on, I see that\ngood and faithful servant, whom of all the people upon earth I love the\nbest, and unto whom my childish heart is certain that the Lord will one\nday say: \"Well done.\"\n\nThere are many faces that I know, among the little crowd; faces that I\nknew in church, when mine was always wondering there; faces that first\nsaw my mother, when she came to the village in her youthful bloom. I do\nnot mind them--I mind nothing but my grief--and yet I see and know them\nall; and even in the background, far away, see Minnie looking on, and\nher eye glancing on her sweetheart, who is near me.\n\nIt is over, and the earth is filled in, and we turn to come away. Before\nus stands our house, so pretty and unchanged, so linked in my mind with\nthe young idea of what is gone, that all my sorrow has been nothing to\nthe sorrow it calls forth. But they take me on; and Mr. Chillip talks to\nme; and when we get home, puts some water to my lips; and when I ask his\nleave to go up to my room, dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman.\n\nAll this, I say, is yesterday's event. Events of later date have floated\nfrom me to the shore where all forgotten things will reappear, but this\nstands like a high rock in the ocean.\n\nI knew that Peggotty would come to me in my room. The Sabbath stillness\nof the time (the day was so like Sunday! I have forgotten that) was\nsuited to us both. She sat down by my side upon my little bed; and\nholding my hand, and sometimes putting it to her lips, and sometimes\nsmoothing it with hers, as she might have comforted my little brother,\ntold me, in her way, all that she had to tell concerning what had\nhappened.\n\n                                 * * *\n\n\"She was never well,\" said Peggotty, \"for a long time. She was uncertain\nin her mind, and not happy. When her baby was born, I thought at first\nshe would get better, but she was more delicate, and sunk a little every\nday. She used to like to sit alone before her baby came, and then she\ncried; but afterwards she used to sing to it--so soft, that I once\nthought, when I heard her, it was like a voice up in the air, that was\nrising away.\n\n\"I think she got to be more timid, and more frightened-like, of late;\nand that a hard word was like a blow to her. But she was always the same\nto me. She never changed to her foolish Peggotty, didn't my sweet girl.\"\n\nHere Peggotty stopped, and softly beat upon my hand a little while.\n\n\"The last time that I saw her like her own old self, was the night when\nyou came home, my dear. The day you went away, she said to me, 'I never\nshall see my pretty darling again. Something tells me so, that tells the\ntruth, I know.'\n\n\"She tried to hold up after that; and many a time, when they told her\nshe was thoughtless and light-hearted, made believe to be so; but it was\nall a bygone then. She never told her husband what she had told me--she\nwas afraid of saying it to anybody else--till one night, a little more\nthan a week before it happened, when she said to him: 'My dear, I think\nI am dying.'\n\n\"'It's off my mind now, Peggotty,' she told me, when I laid her in her\nbed that night. 'He will believe it more and more, poor fellow, every\nday for a few days to come; and then it will be past. I am very tired.\nIf this is sleep, sit by me while I sleep: don't leave me. God bless\nboth my children! God protect and keep my fatherless boy!'\n\n\"I never left her afterwards,\" said Peggotty. \"She often talked to them\ntwo down stairs--for she loved them; she couldn't bear not to love any\none who was about her--but when they went away from her bedside, she\nalways turned to me, as if there was rest where Peggotty was, and never\nfell asleep in any other way.\n\n\"On the last night, in the evening, she kissed me, and said: 'If my baby\nshould die too, Peggotty, please let them lay him in my arms, and bury\nus together.' (It was done; for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond\nher.) 'Let my dearest boy go with us to our resting-place,' she said,\n'and tell him that his mother, when she lay here, blessed him not once,\nbut a thousand times.'\"\n\nAnother silence followed this, and another gentle beating on my hand.\n\n\"It was pretty far in the night,\" said Peggotty, \"when she asked me for\nsome drink; and when she had taken it, gave me such a patient smile, the\ndear!--so beautiful!--\n\n\"Daybreak had come, and the sun was rising, when she said to me, how\nkind and considerate Mr. Copperfield had always been to her, and how he\nhad borne with her, and told her, when she doubted herself, that a\nloving heart was better and stronger than wisdom, and that he was a\nhappy man in hers. 'Peggotty, my dear,' she said then, 'put me nearer to\nyou,' for she was very weak. 'Lay your good arm underneath my neck,' she\nsaid, 'and turn me to you, for your face is going far off, and I want it\nto be near.' I put it as she asked; and oh Davy! the time had come when\nmy first parting words to you were true--when she was glad to lay her\npoor head on her stupid cross old Peggotty's arm--and she died like a\nchild that had gone to sleep!\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nThus ended Peggotty's narration. From the moment of my knowing of the\ndeath of my mother, the idea of her as she had been of late had vanished\nfrom me. I remembered her, from that instant, only as the young mother\nof my earliest impressions, who had been used to wind her bright curls\nround and round her finger, and to dance with me at twilight in the\nparlor. What Peggotty had told me now, was so far from bringing me back\nto the later period, that it rooted the earlier image in my mind. It may\nbe curious, but it is true. In her death she winged her way back to her\ncalm untroubled youth, and cancelled all the rest.\n\nThe mother who lay in the grave, was the mother of my infancy; the\nlittle creature in her arms, was myself, as I had once been, hushed for\never on her bosom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nI BECOME NEGLECTED, AND AM PROVIDED FOR.\n\n\nThe first act of business Miss Murdstone performed when the day of the\nsolemnity was over, and light was freely admitted into the house, was to\ngive Peggotty a month's warning. Much as Peggotty would have disliked\nsuch a service, I believe she would have retained it, for my sake, in\npreference to the best upon earth. She told me we must part, and told me\nwhy; and we condoled with one another, in all sincerity.\n\nAs to me or my future, not a word was said, or a step taken. Happy they\nwould have been, I dare say, if they could have dismissed me at a\nmonth's warning too. I mustered courage once, to ask Miss Murdstone when\nI was going back to school; and she answered dryly, she believed I was\nnot going back at all. I was told nothing more. I was very anxious to\nknow what was going to be done with me, and so was Peggotty; but neither\nshe nor I could pick up any information on the subject.\n\nThere was one change in my condition, which, while it relieved me of a\ngreat deal of present uneasiness, might have made me, if I had been\ncapable of considering it closely, yet more uncomfortable about the\nfuture. It was this. The constraint that had been put upon me, was quite\nabandoned. I was so far from being required to keep my dull post in the\nparlor, that on several occasions, when I took my seat there, Miss\nMurdstone frowned to me to go away. I was so far from being warned off\nfrom Peggotty's society, that, provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone's, I\nwas never sought out or inquired for. At first I was in daily dread of\nhis taking my education in hand again, or of Miss Murdstone's devoting\nherself to it; but I soon began to think that such fears were\ngroundless, and that all I had to anticipate was neglect.\n\nI do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then. I was\nstill giddy with the shock of my mother's death, and in a kind of\nstunned state as to all tributary things. I can recollect, indeed, to\nhave speculated, at odd times, on the possibility of my not being taught\nany more, or cared for any more; and growing up to be a shabby moody\nman, lounging an idle life away, about the village; as well as on the\nfeasibility of my getting rid of this picture by going away somewhere,\nlike the hero in a story, to seek my fortune: but these were transient\nvisions, day dreams I sat looking at sometimes, as if they were faintly\npainted or written on the wall of my room, and which, as they melted\naway, left the wall blank again.\n\n\"Peggotty,\" I said in a thoughtful whisper, one evening, when I was\nwarming my hands at the kitchen fire, \"Mr. Murdstone likes me less than\nhe used to. He never liked me much, Peggotty; but he would rather not\neven see me now, if he can help it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's his sorrow,\" said Peggotty, stroking my hair.\n\n\"I am sure, Peggotty, I am sorry too. If I believed it was his sorrow, I\nshould not think of it at all. But it's not that; oh, no, it's not\nthat.\"\n\n\"How do you know it's not that?\" said Peggotty, after a silence.\n\n\"Oh, his sorrow is another and quite a different thing. He is sorry at\nthis moment, sitting by the fireside with Miss Murdstone; but if I was\nto go in, Peggotty, he would be something besides.\"\n\n\"What would he be?\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"Angry,\" I answered, with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown.\n\"If he was only sorry, he wouldn't look at me as he does. _I_ am only\nsorry, and it makes me feel kinder.\"\n\nPeggotty said nothing for a little while; and I warmed my hands, as\nsilent as she.\n\n\"Davy,\" she said at length.\n\n\"Yes, Peggotty?\"\n\n\"I have tried, my dear, all ways I could think of--all the ways there\nare, and all the ways there ain't, in short--to get a suitable service\nhere, in Blunderstone; but there's no such a thing, my love.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean to do, Peggotty?\" says I, wistfully. \"Do you mean\nto go and seek your fortune?\"\n\n\"I expect I shall be forced to go to Yarmouth,\" replied Peggotty, \"and\nlive there.\"\n\n\"You might have gone farther off,\" I said, brightening a little, \"and\nbeen as bad as lost. I shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty,\nthere. You won't be quite at the other end of the world, will you?\"\n\n\"Contrary ways, please God!\" cried Peggotty, with great animation. \"As\nlong as you are here, my pet, I shall come over every week of my life to\nsee you. One day, every week of my life!\"\n\nI felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise; but even this\nwas not all, for Peggotty went on to say:\n\n\"I'm a going, Davy, you see, to my brother's, first, for another\nfortnight's visit--just till I have had time to look about me, and get\nto be something like myself again. Now, I have been thinking, that\nperhaps, as they don't want you here at present, you might be let to go\nalong with me.\"\n\nIf anything, short of being in a different relation to every one about\nme, Peggotty excepted, could have given me a sense of pleasure at that\ntime, it would have been this project of all others. The idea of being\nagain surrounded by those honest faces, shining welcome on me; of\nrenewing the peacefulness of the sweet Sunday morning, when the bells\nwere ringing, the stones dropping in the water, and the shadowy ships\nbreaking through the mist; of roaming up and down with little Em'ly,\ntelling her my troubles, and finding charms against them in the shells\nand pebbles on the beach; made a calm in my heart. It was ruffled next\nmoment, to be sure, by a doubt of Miss Murdstone's giving her consent;\nbut even that was set at rest soon, for she came out to take an evening\ngrope in the store-closet while we were yet in conversation, and\nPeggotty, with a boldness that amazed me, broached the topic on the\nspot.\n\n\"The boy will be idle there,\" said Miss Murdstone, looking into a\npickle-jar, \"and idleness is the root of all evil. But, to be sure, he\nwould be idle here--or anywhere, in my opinion.\"\n\nPeggotty had an angry answer ready, I could see; but she swallowed it\nfor my sake, and remained silent.\n\n\"Humph!\" said Miss Murdstone, still keeping her eye on the pickles;\n\"it is of more importance than anything else--it is of paramount\nimportance--that my brother should not be disturbed or made\nuncomfortable. I suppose I had better say yes.\"\n\nI thanked her, without making any demonstration of joy, lest it should\ninduce her to withdraw her assent. Nor could I help thinking this a\nprudent course, when she looked at me out of the pickle-jar, with as\ngreat an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its\ncontents. However, the permission was given, and was never retracted;\nfor when the month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart.\n\nMr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty's boxes. I had never known\nhim to pass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came into\nthe house. And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and\nwent out, which I thought had meaning in it, if meaning could ever be\nsaid to find its way into Mr. Barkis's visage.\n\nPeggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home\nso many years, and where the two strong attachments of her life--for my\nmother and myself--had been formed. She had been walking in the\nchurchyard, too, very early; and she got into the cart, and sat in it\nwith her handkerchief at her eyes.\n\nSo long as she remained in this condition, Mr. Barkis gave no sign of\nlife whatever. He sat in his usual place and attitude, like a great\nstuffed figure. But when she began to look about her, and to speak to\nme, he nodded his head and grinned several times. I have not the least\nnotion at whom, or what he meant by it.\n\n\"It's a beautiful day, Mr. Barkis!\" I said, as an act of politeness.\n\n\"It ain't bad,\" said Mr. Barkis, who generally qualified his speech, and\nrarely committed himself.\n\n\"Peggotty is quite comfortable now, Mr. Barkis,\" I remarked, for his\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Is she, though!\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\nAfter reflecting about it, with a sagacious air, Mr. Barkis eyed her,\nand said:\n\n\"_Are_ you pretty comfortable?\"\n\nPeggotty laughed, and answered in the affirmative.\n\n\"But really and truly, you know. Are you?\" growled Mr. Barkis, sliding\nnearer to her on the seat, and nudging her with his elbow. \"Are you?\nReally and truly pretty comfortable? Are you? Eh?\" At each of these\ninquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her, and gave her another nudge;\nso that at last we were all crowded together in the left-hand corner of\nthe cart, and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it.\n\nPeggotty calling his attention to my sufferings, Mr. Barkis gave me a\nlittle more room at once, and got away by degrees. But I could not help\nobserving that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient\nfor expressing himself in a neat, agreeable, and pointed manner, without\nthe inconvenience of inventing conversation. He manifestly chuckled over\nit for some time. By-and-by he turned to Peggotty again, and repeating,\n\"Are you pretty comfortable though?\" bore down upon us as before, until\nthe breath was nearly wedged out of my body. By-and-by he made another\ndescent upon us with the same inquiry, and the same result. At length, I\ngot up whenever I saw him coming, and standing on the footboard,\npretended to look at the prospect; after which I did very well.\n\nHe was so polite as to stop at a public-house, expressly on our account,\nand entertain us with broiled mutton and beer. Even when Peggotty was in\nthe act of drinking, he was seized with one of those approaches, and\nalmost choked her. But as we drew nearer to the end of our journey, he\nhad more to do and less time for gallantry; and when we got on Yarmouth\npavement, we were all too much shaken and jolted, I apprehend, to have\nany leisure for any thing else.\n\nMr. Peggotty and Ham waited for us at the old place. They received me\nand Peggotty in an affectionate manner, and shook hands with Mr. Barkis,\nwho, with his hat on the very back of his head, and a shame-faced leer\nupon his countenance, and pervading his very legs, presented but a\nvacant appearance, I thought. They each took one of Peggotty's trunks,\nand we were going away, when Mr. Barkis solemnly made a sign to me with\nhis forefinger to come under an archway.\n\n\"I say,\" growled Mr. Barkis, \"it was all right.\"\n\nI looked up into his face, and answered, with an attempt to be very\nprofound: \"Oh!\"\n\n\"It didn't come to a end there,\" said Mr. Barkis, nodding\nconfidentially. \"It was all right.\"\n\nAgain I answered: \"Oh!\"\n\n\"You know who was willin',\" said my friend. \"It was Barkis, and Barkis\nonly.\"\n\nI nodded assent.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Mr. Barkis, shaking hands; \"I'm a friend of\nyour'n. You made it all right, first. It's all right.\"\n\nIn his attempts to be particularly lucid, Mr. Barkis was so extremely\nmysterious, that I might have stood looking in his face for an hour, and\nmost assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of\nthe face of a clock that had stopped, but for Peggotty's calling me\naway. As we were going along, she asked me what he had said; and I told\nher he had said it was all right.\n\n\"Like his impudence,\" said Peggotty, \"but I don't mind that! Davy dear,\nwhat should you think if I was to think of being married?\"\n\n\"Why--I suppose you would like me as much then, Peggotty, as you do\nnow?\" I returned, after a little consideration.\n\nGreatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street, as well as\nof her relations going on before, the good soul was obliged to stop and\nembrace me on the spot, with many protestations of her unalterable love.\n\n\"Tell me what should you say, darling?\" she asked again, when this was\nover, and we were walking on.\n\n\"If you were thinking of being married--to Mr. Barkis, Peggotty?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"I should think it would be a very good thing. For then you know,\nPeggotty, you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to\nsee me, and could come for nothing, and be sure of coming.\"\n\n\"The sense of the dear!\" cried Peggotty. \"What I have been thinking of,\nthis month back! Yes, my precious; and I think I should be more\nindependent altogether, you see; let alone my working with a better\nheart in my own house, than I could in anybody else's now. I don't know\nwhat I might be fit for, now, as a servant to a stranger. And I shall be\nalways near my pretty's resting-place,\" said Peggotty musing, \"and able\nto see it when I like; and when _I_ lie down to rest, I may be laid not\nfar off from my darling girl!\"\n\nWe neither of us said anything for a little while.\n\n\"But I wouldn't so much as give it another thought,\" said Peggotty,\ncheerily, \"if my Davy was anyways against it--not if I had been asked in\nchurch thirty times three times over, and was wearing out the ring in my\npocket.\"\n\n\"Look at me, Peggotty,\" I replied; \"and see if I am not really glad, and\ndon't truly wish it!\" As indeed I did, with all my heart.\n\n\"Well, my life,\" said Peggotty, giving me a squeeze, \"I have thought of\nit night and day, every way I can, and I hope the right way; but I'll\nthink of it again, and speak to my brother about it, and in the meantime\nwe'll keep it to ourselves, Davy, you and me. Barkis is a good plain\ncreetur',\" said Peggotty, \"and if I tried to do my duty by him, I think\nit would be my fault if I wasn't--if I wasn't pretty comfortable,\" said\nPeggotty, laughing heartily.\n\nThis quotation from Mr. Barkis was so appropriate, and tickled us both\nso much, that we laughed again and again, and were quite in a pleasant\nhumour when we came within view of Mr. Peggotty's cottage.\n\nIt looked just the same, except that it may, perhaps, have shrunk a\nlittle in my eyes; and Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at the door as if she\nhad stood there ever since. All within was the same, down to the seaweed\nin the blue mug in my bedroom. I went into the out-house to look about\nme; and the very same lobsters, crabs, and crawfish possessed by the\nsame desire to pinch the world in general, appeared to be in the same\nstate of conglomeration in the same old corner.\n\nBut there was no little Em'ly to be seen, so I asked Mr. Peggotty where\nshe was.\n\n\"She's at school, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty, wiping the heat consequent on\nthe porterage of Peggotty's box from his forehead; \"she'll be home,\"\nlooking at the Dutch clock, \"in from twenty minutes to half-an-hour's\ntime. We all on us feel the loss of her, bless ye!\"\n\nMrs. Gummidge moaned.\n\n\"Cheer up, Mawther!\" cried Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"I feel it more than anybody else,\" said Mrs. Gummidge; \"I'm a lone lorn\ncreetur', and she used to be a'most the only think that didn't go\ncontrairy with me.\"\n\nMrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking her head, applied herself to\nblowing the fire. Mr. Peggotty, looking round upon us while she was so\nengaged, said in a low voice, which he shaded with his hand: \"The old\n'un!\" From this I rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken\nplace since my last visit in the state of Mrs. Gummidge's spirits.\n\nNow, the whole place was, or it should have been, quite as delightful a\nplace as ever; and yet it did not impress me in the same way. I felt\nrather disappointed with it. Perhaps it was because little Em'ly was not\nat home. I knew the way by which she would come, and presently found\nmyself strolling along the path to meet her.\n\nA figure appeared in the distance before long, and I soon knew it to be\nEm'ly, who was a little creature still in stature, though she was grown.\nBut when she drew nearer, and I saw her blue eyes looking bluer, and her\ndimpled face looking brighter, and her whole self prettier and gayer, a\ncurious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her, and\npass by as if I were looking at something a long way off. I have done\nsuch a thing since in later life, or I am mistaken.\n\nLittle Em'ly didn't care a bit. She saw me well enough; but instead of\nturning round and calling after me, ran away laughing. This obliged me\nto run after her, and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage\nbefore I caught her.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" said little Em'ly.\n\n\"Why, you knew who it was, Em'ly,\" said I.\n\n\"And didn't _you_ know who it was?\" said Em'ly. I was going to kiss her,\nbut she covered her cherry lips with her hands, and said she wasn't a\nbaby now, and ran away, laughing more than ever, into the house.\n\nShe seemed to delight in teasing me, which was a change in her I\nwondered at very much. The tea-table was ready, and our little locker\nwas put out in its old place, but instead of coming to sit by me, she\nwent and bestowed her company upon that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge: and on\nMr. Peggotty's inquiring why, rumpled her hair all over her face to hide\nit, and would do nothing but laugh.\n\n\"A little puss, it is!\" said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with his great\nhand.\n\n\"So sh' is! so sh' is!\" cried Ham. \"Mas'r Davy bor', so sh'is!\" and he\nsat and chuckled at her for some time, in a state of mingled admiration\nand delight, that made his face a burning red.\n\nLittle Em'ly was spoiled by them all, in fact; and by no one more than\nMr. Peggotty himself, whom she could have coaxed into anything, by only\ngoing and laying her cheek against his rough whisker. That was my\nopinion, at least, when I saw her do it; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be\nthoroughly in the right. But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured,\nand had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once, that\nshe captivated me more than ever.\n\nShe was tender-hearted, too; for when, as we sat round the fire after\ntea, an allusion was made by Mr. Peggotty over his pipe to the loss I\nhad sustained, the tears stood in her eyes, and she looked at me so\nkindly across the table, that I felt quite thankful to her.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Peggotty, taking up her curls, and running them over his\nhand like water, \"here's another orphan, you see, sir. And here,\" said\nMr. Peggotty, giving Ham a back-handed knock in the chest, \"is another\nof 'em, though he don't look much like it.\"\n\n\"If I had you for my guardian, Mr. Peggotty,\" said I, shaking my head,\n\"I don't think I should _feel_ much like it.\"\n\n\"Well said, Mas'r Davy bor'!\" cried Ham, in an ecstasy. \"Hoorah! Well\nsaid! Nor more you wouldn't! Hor! Hor!\"--Here he returned Mr. Peggotty's\nback-hander, and little Em'ly got up and kissed Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"And how's your friend, sir?\" said Mr. Peggotty to me.\n\n\"Steerforth?\" said I.\n\n\"That's the name!\" cried Mr. Peggotty, turning to Ham. \"I knowed it was\nsomething in our way.\"\n\n\"You said it was Rudderford,\" observed Ham, laughing.\n\n\"Well?\" retorted Mr. Peggotty. \"And ye steer with a rudder, don't ye? It\nain't fur off. How is he, sir?\"\n\n\"He was very well indeed when I came away, Mr. Peggotty.\"\n\n\"There's a friend!\" said Mr. Peggotty, stretching out his pipe. \"There's\na friend, if you talk of friends! Why, Lord love my heart alive, if it\nain't a treat to look at him!\"\n\n\"He is very handsome, is he not?\" said I, my heart warming with this\npraise.\n\n\"Handsome!\" cried Mr. Peggotty. \"He stands up to you like--like a--why,\nI don't know what he _don't_ stand up to you like. He's so bold!\"\n\n\"Yes! That's just his character,\" said I. \"He's as brave as a lion, and\nyou can't think how frank he is, Mr. Peggotty.\"\n\n\"And I do suppose, now,\" said Mr. Peggotty, looking at me through the\nsmoke of his pipe, \"that in the way of book-learning he'd take the wind\nout of a'most anything.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, delighted; \"he knows everything. He is astonishingly\nclever.\"\n\n\"There's a friend!\" murmured Mr. Peggotty, with a grave toss of his\nhead.\n\n\"Nothing seems to cost him any trouble,\" said I. \"He knows a task if he\nonly looks at it. He is the best cricketer you ever saw. He will give\nyou almost as many men as you like at draughts, and beat you easily.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: \"Of course\nhe will.\"\n\n\"He is such a speaker,\" I pursued, \"that he can win anybody over; and I\ndon't know what you'd say if you were to hear him sing, Mr. Peggotty.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: \"I have no\ndoubt of it.\"\n\n\"Then, he's such a generous, fine, noble fellow,\" said I, quite carried\naway by my favorite theme, \"that it's hardly possible to give him as\nmuch praise as he deserves. I am sure I can never feel thankful enough\nfor the generosity with which he has protected me, so much younger and\nlower in the school than himself.\"\n\nI was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little\nEm'ly's face, which was bent forward over the table, listening with the\ndeepest attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels,\nand the color mantling in her cheeks. She looked so extraordinarily\nearnest and pretty, that I stopped in a sort of wonder; and they all\nobserved her at the same time, for, as I stopped, they laughed and\nlooked at her.\n\n\"Em'ly is like me,\" said Peggotty, \"and would like to see him.\"\n\nEm'ly was confused by our all observing her, and hung down her head, and\nher face was covered with blushes. Glancing up presently through her\nstray curls, and seeing that we were all looking at her still (I am\nsure, I, for one, could have looked at her for hours), she ran away, and\nkept away till it was nearly bedtime.\n\nI lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat, and the wind\ncame moaning on across the flat as it had done before. But I could not\nhelp fancying, now, that it moaned of those who were gone; and instead\nof thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat\naway, I thought of the sea that had risen, since I last heard those\nsounds, and drowned my happy home. I recollect, as the wind and water\nbegan to sound fainter in my ears, putting a short clause into my\nprayers, petitioning that I might grow up to marry little Em'ly, and so\ndropping lovingly asleep.\n\nThe days passed pretty much as they had passed before, except--it was a\ngreat exception--that little Em'ly and I seldom wandered on the beach\nnow. She had tasks to learn, and needle-work to do; and was absent\nduring a great part of each day. But I felt that we should not have had\nthose old wanderings, even if it had been otherwise. Wild and full of\nchildish whims as Em'ly was, she was more of a little woman than I had\nsupposed. She seemed to have got a great distance away from me, in\nlittle more than a year. She liked me, but she laughed at me, and\ntormented me; and when I went to meet her, stole home another way, and\nwas laughing at the door when I came back, disappointed. The best times\nwere when she sat quietly at work in the doorway, and I sat on the\nwooden step at her feet, reading to her. It seems to me, at this hour,\nthat I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April\nafternoons; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used\nto see, sitting in the doorway of the old boat; that I have never beheld\nsuch sky, such water, such glorified ships sailing away into golden air.\n\nOn the very first evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared in an\nexceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle of oranges\ntied up in a handkerchief. As he made no allusion of any kind to this\nproperty, he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when he\nwent away; until Ham, running after him to restore it, came back with\nthe information that it was intended for Peggotty. After that occasion\nhe appeared every evening at exactly the same hour, and always with a\nlittle bundle, to which he never alluded, and which he regularly put\nbehind the door, and left there. These offerings of affection were of a\nmost various and eccentric description. Among them I remember a double\nset of pig's trotters, a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of\napples, a pair of jet earrings, some Spanish onions, a box of dominoes,\na canary bird and cage, and a leg of pickled pork.\n\nMr. Barkis's wooing, as I remember it, was altogether of a peculiar\nkind. He very seldom said anything; but would sit by the fire in much\nthe same attitude as he sat in, in his cart, and stare heavily at\nPeggotty, who was opposite. One night, being, as I suppose, inspired by\nlove, he made a dart at the bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread,\nand put it in his waistcoat-pocket and carried it off. After that, his\ngreat delight was to produce it when it was wanted, sticking to the\nlining of his pocket, in a partially-melted state, and pocket it again\nwhen it was done with. He seemed to enjoy himself very much, and not to\nfeel at all called upon to talk. Even when he took Peggotty out for a\nwalk on the flats, he had no uneasiness on that head, I believe;\ncontenting himself with now and then asking her if she was pretty\ncomfortable; and I remember that sometimes, after he was gone, Peggotty\nwould throw her apron over her face, and laugh for half-an-hour. Indeed,\nwe were all more or less amused, except that miserable Mrs. Gummidge,\nwhose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature,\nshe was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one.\n\nAt length, when the term of my visit was nearly expired, it was given\nout that Peggotty and Mr. Barkis were going to make a day's holiday\ntogether, and that little Em'ly and I were to accompany them. I had but\na broken sleep the night before, in anticipation of the pleasure of a\nwhole day with Em'ly. We were all astir betimes in the morning; and\nwhile we were yet at breakfast, Mr. Barkis appeared in the distance,\ndriving a chaise-cart towards the object of his affections.\n\nPeggotty was drest as usual, in her neat and quiet mourning; but Mr.\nBarkis bloomed in a new blue coat, of which the tailor had given him\nsuch good measure, that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary\nin the coldest weather, while the collar was so high that it pushed his\nhair up on end on the top of his head. His bright buttons, too, were of\nthe largest size. Rendered complete by drab pantaloons and a buff\nwaistcoat, I thought Mr. Barkis a phenomenon of respectability.\n\nWhen we were all in a bustle outside the door, I found that Mr. Peggotty\nwas prepared with an old shoe, which was to be thrown after us for luck,\nand which he offered to Mrs. Gummidge for that purpose.\n\n\"No. It had better be done by somebody else, Dan'l,\" said Mrs. Gummidge.\n\"I'm a lone lorn creetur' myself, and everythink that reminds me of\ncreetur's that ain't lone and lorn, goes contrairy with me.\"\n\n\"Come, old gal!\" cried Mr. Peggotty. \"Take and heave it!\"\n\n\"No, Dan'l,\" returned Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking her head.\n\"If I felt less, I could do more. You don't feel like me, Dan'l; thinks\ndon't go contrairy with you, nor you with them; you had better do it\nyourself.\"\n\nBut here Peggotty, who had been going about from one to another in a\nhurried way, kissing everybody, called out from the cart, in which we\nall were by this time (Em'ly and I on two little chairs, side by side),\nthat Mrs. Gummidge must do it. So Mrs. Gummidge did it; and, I am sorry\nto relate, cast a damp upon the festive character of our departure, by\nimmediately bursting into tears, and sinking subdued into the arms of\nHam, with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden, and had\nbetter be carried to the House at once. Which I really thought was a\nsensible idea, that Ham might have acted on.\n\n  [Illustration: Mrs. Gummidge casts a damp on our departure.]\n\nAway we went, however, on our holiday excursion; and the first thing we\ndid was to stop at a church, where Mr. Barkis tied the horse to some\nrails, and went in with Peggotty, leaving little Em'ly and me alone in\nthe chaise. I took that occasion to put my arm round Em'ly's waist, and\npropose that as I was going away so very soon now, we should determine\nto be very affectionate to one another, and very happy, all day. Little\nEm'ly consenting, and allowing me to kiss her, I became desperate;\ninforming her, I recollect, that I never could love another, and that I\nwas prepared to shed the blood of anybody who should aspire to her\naffections.\n\nHow merry little Em'ly made herself about it! With what a demure\nassumption of being immensely older and wiser than I, the fairy little\nwoman said I was \"a silly boy;\" and then laughed so charmingly that I\nforgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name, in the\npleasure of looking at her.\n\nMr. Barkis and Peggotty were a good while in the church, but came out at\nlast, and then we drove away into the country. As we were going along,\nMr. Barkis turned to me, and said, with a wink,--by-the-by, I should\nhardly have thought, before, that he _could_ wink:\n\n\"What name was it as I wrote up in the cart?\"\n\n\"Clara Peggotty,\" I answered.\n\n\"What name would it be as I should write up now, if there was a tilt\nhere?\"\n\n\"Clara Peggotty, again?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Clara Peggotty BARKIS!\" he returned, and burst into a roar of laughter\nthat shook the chaise.\n\nIn a word, they were married, and had gone into the church for no other\npurpose. Peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly done; and the\nclerk had given her away, and there had been no witnesses of the\nceremony. She was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made this abrupt\nannouncement of their union, and could not hug me enough in token of her\nunimpaired affection; but she soon became herself again, and said she\nwas very glad it was over.\n\nWe drove to a little inn in a bye road, where we were expected, and\nwhere we had a very comfortable dinner, and passed the day with great\nsatisfaction. If Peggotty had been married every day for the last ten\nyears, she could hardly have been more at her ease about it; it made no\nsort of difference in her: she was just the same as ever, and went out\nfor a stroll with little Em'ly and me before tea, while Mr. Barkis\nphilosophically smoked his pipe, and enjoyed himself, I suppose, with\nthe contemplation of his happiness. If so, it sharpened his appetite;\nfor I distinctly call to mind that, although he had eaten a good deal of\npork and greens at dinner, and had finished off with a fowl or two, he\nwas obliged to have cold boiled bacon for tea, and disposed of a large\nquantity without any emotion.\n\nI have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind\nof wedding it must have been! We got into the chaise again soon after\ndark, and drove cosily back, looking up at the stars, and talking about\nthem. I was their chief exponent, and opened Mr. Barkis's mind to an\namazing extent. I told him all I knew, but he would have believed\nanything I might have taken it into my head to impart to him; for he had\na profound veneration for my abilities, and informed his wife in my\nhearing, on that very occasion, that I was \"a young Roeshus\"--by which I\nthink he meant, prodigy.\n\nWhen we had exhausted the subject of the stars, or rather when I had\nexhausted the mental faculties of Mr. Barkis, little Em'ly and I made a\ncloak of an old wrapper, and sat under it for the rest of the journey.\nAh, how I loved her! What happiness (I thought) if we were married, and\nwere going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields,\nnever growing older, never growing wiser, children ever, rambling hand\nin hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows, laying down our\nheads on moss at night, in a sweet sleep of purity and peace, and buried\nby the birds when we were dead! Some such picture, with no real world in\nit, bright with the light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar\noff, was in my mind all the way. I am glad to think there were two such\nguileless hearts at Peggotty's marriage as little Em'ly's and mine. I am\nglad to think the Loves and Graces took such airy forms in its homely\nprocession.\n\nWell, we came to the old boat again in good time at night; and there Mr.\nand Mrs. Barkis bade us good-bye, and drove away snugly to their own\nhome. I felt then, for the first time, that I had lost Peggotty. I\nshould have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof\nbut that which sheltered little Em'ly's head.\n\nMr. Peggotty and Ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as I did, and\nwere ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive it away.\nLittle Em'ly came and sat beside me on the locker, for the only time in\nall that visit; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful\nday.\n\nIt was a night tide; and soon after we went to bed, Mr. Peggotty and Ham\nwent out to fish. I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary\nhouse, the protector of Em'ly and Mrs. Gummidge, and only wished that a\nlion or a serpent, or any ill-disposed monster, would make an attack\nupon us, that I might destroy him, and cover myself with glory. But as\nnothing of the sort happened to be walking about on Yarmouth flats that\nnight, I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons\nuntil morning.\n\nWith morning came Peggotty; who called to me, as usual, under my window\nas if Mr. Barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream too.\nAfter breakfast she took me to her own home, and a beautiful little home\nit was. Of all the moveables in it, I must have been most impressed by a\ncertain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlor (the tile-floored\nkitchen was the general sitting-room), with a retreating top which\nopened, let down, and became a desk, within which, was a large quarto\nedition of Fox's Book of Martyrs. This precious volume, of which I do\nnot recollect one word, I immediately discovered and immediately applied\nmyself to; and I never visited the house afterwards, but I kneeled on a\nchair, opened the casket where this gem was enshrined, spread my arms\nover the desk, and fell to devouring the book afresh. I was chiefly\nedified, I am afraid, by the pictures, which were numerous, and\nrepresented all kinds of dismal horrors; but the Martyrs and Peggotty's\nhouse have been inseparable in my mind ever since, and are now.\n\nI took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and little\nEm'ly, that day; and passed the night at Peggotty's, in a little room in\nthe roof (with the crocodile-book on a shelf by the bed's head) which\nwas to be always mine, Peggotty said, and should always be kept for me\nin exactly the same state.\n\n\"Young or old, Davy dear, as long as I am alive and have this house over\nmy head,\" said Peggotty, \"you shall find it as if I expected you here\ndirectly minute. I shall keep it every day, as I used to keep your old\nlittle room, my darling; and if you was to go to China, you might think\nof it as being kept just the same, all the time you were away.\"\n\nI felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse, with all my heart,\nand thanked her as well as I could. That was not very well, for she\nspoke to me thus, with her arms round my neck, in the morning, and I was\ngoing home in the morning, and I went home in the morning, with herself\nand Mr. Barkis in the cart. They left me at the gate, not easily or\nlightly; and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on, taking\nPeggotty away, and leaving me under the old elm-trees looking at the\nhouse, in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking\nany more.\n\nAnd now I fell into a state of neglect, which I cannot look back upon\nwithout compassion. I fell at once into a solitary condition,--apart\nfrom all friendly notice, apart from the society of all other boys\nof my own age, apart from all companionship but my own spiritless\nthoughts,--which seems to cast its gloom upon this paper as I write.\n\nWhat would I have given, to have been sent to the hardest school that\never was kept!--to have been taught something, anyhow, anywhere! No such\nhope dawned upon me. They disliked me; and they sullenly, sternly,\nsteadily, overlooked me. I think Mr. Murdstone's means were straitened\nat about this time; but it is little to the purpose. He could not bear\nme; and in putting me from him he tried, as I believe, to put away the\nnotion that I had any claim upon him--and succeeded.\n\nI was not actively ill-used. I was not beaten, or starved; but the wrong\nthat was done to me had no intervals of relenting, and was done in a\nsystematic, passionless manner. Day after day, week after week, month\nafter month, I was coldly neglected. I wonder sometimes, when I think of\nit, what they would have done if I had been taken with an illness;\nwhether I should have lain down in my lonely room, and languished\nthrough it in my usual solitary way, or whether anybody would have\nhelped me out.\n\nWhen Mr. and Miss Murdstone were at home, I took my meals with them; in\ntheir absence, I ate and drank by myself. At all times I lounged about\nthe house and neighbourhood quite disregarded, except that they were\njealous of my making any friends: thinking, perhaps, that, if I did, I\nmight complain to some one. For this reason, though Mr. Chillip often\nasked me to go and see him (he was a widower, having, some years before\nthat, lost a little small light-haired wife, whom I can just remember\nconnecting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoise-shell cat), it was\nbut seldom that I enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his\ncloset of a surgery; reading some book that was new to me, with the\nsmell of the whole pharmacopoeia coming up my nose, or pounding something\nin a mortar under his mild directions.\n\nFor the same reason, added no doubt to the old dislike of her, I was\nseldom allowed to visit Peggotty. Faithful to her promise, she either\ncame to see me, or met me somewhere near, once every week, and never\nempty-handed; but many and bitter were the disappointments I had, in\nbeing refused permission to pay a visit to her at her house. Some few\ntimes, however, at long intervals, I was allowed to go there; and then I\nfound out that Mr. Barkis was something of a miser, or as Peggotty\ndutifully expressed it, was \"a little near,\" and kept a heap of money in\na box under his bed, which he pretended was only full of coats and\ntrousers. In this coffer, his riches hid themselves with such a\ntenacious modesty, that the smallest instalments could only be tempted\nout by artifice; so that Peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate\nscheme, a very Gunpowder Plot, for every Saturday's expenses.\n\nAll this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise I had\ngiven, and of my being utterly neglected, that I should have been\nperfectly miserable, I have no doubt, but for the old books. They were\nmy only comfort; and I was as true to them as they were to me, and read\nthem over and over I don't know how many times more.\n\nI now approach a period of my life, which I can never lose the\nremembrance of, while I remember any thing; and the recollection of\nwhich has often, without my invocation, come before me like a ghost, and\nhaunted happier times.\n\nI had been out, one day, loitering somewhere, in the listless,\nmeditative manner that my way of life engendered, when, turning the\ncorner of a lane near our house, I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking with\na gentleman. I was confused, and was going by them, when the gentleman\ncried:\n\n\"What! Brooks!\"\n\n\"No, sir, David Copperfield,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't tell me. You are Brooks,\" said the gentleman. \"You are Brooks of\nSheffield. That's your name.\"\n\nAt these words, I observed the gentleman more attentively. His laugh\ncoming to my remembrance too, I knew him to be Mr. Quinion, whom I had\ngone over to Lowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see, before--it is no\nmatter--I need not recall when.\n\n\"And how do you get on, and where are you being educated, Brooks?\" said\nMr. Quinion.\n\nHe had put his hand upon my shoulder, and turned me about, to walk with\nthem. I did not know what to reply, and glanced dubiously at Mr.\nMurdstone.\n\n\"He is at home at present,\" said the latter. \"He is not being educated\nanywhere. I don't know what to do with him. He is a difficult subject.\"\n\nThat old, double look was on me for a moment; and then his eye darkened\nwith a frown, as it turned, in its aversion, elsewhere.\n\n\"Humph!\" said Mr. Quinion, looking at us both, I thought. \"Fine\nweather!\"\n\nSilence ensued, and I was considering how I could best disengage my\nshoulder from his hand, and go away, when he said:\n\n\"I suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still? Eh, Brooks?\"\n\n\"Aye! He is sharp enough,\" said Mr. Murdstone, impatiently. \"You had\nbetter let him go. He will not thank you for troubling him.\"\n\nOn this hint, Mr. Quinion released me, and I made the best of my way\nhome. Looking back as I turned into the front garden, I saw Mr.\nMurdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard, and Mr. Quinion\ntalking to him. They were both looking after me, and I felt that they\nwere speaking of me.\n\nMr. Quinion lay at our house that night. After breakfast, the next\nmorning, I had put my chair away, and was going out of the room, when\nMr. Murdstone called me back. He then gravely repaired to another table,\nwhere his sister sat herself at her desk. Mr. Quinion, with his hands in\nhis pockets, stood looking out of window; and I stood looking at them\nall.\n\n\"David,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \"to the young this is a world for action;\nnot for moping and droning in.\"\n\n--\"As you do,\" added his sister.\n\n\"Jane Murdstone, leave it to me, if you please. I say, David, to the\nyoung this is a world for action, and not for moping and droning in. It\nis especially so for a young boy of your disposition, which requires a\ngreat deal of correcting; and to which no greater service can be done\nthan to force it to conform to the ways of the working world, and to\nbend it and break it.\"\n\n\"For stubbornness won't do here,\" said his sister. \"What it wants, is,\nto be crushed. And crushed it must be. Shall be, too!\"\n\nHe gave her a look, half in remonstrance, half in approval, and went on:\n\n\"I suppose you know, David, that I am not rich. At any rate, you know it\nnow. You have received some considerable education already. Education is\ncostly; and even if it were not, and I could afford it, I am of opinion\nthat it would not be at all advantageous to you to be kept at a school.\nWhat is before you, is a fight with the world; and the sooner you begin\nit, the better.\"\n\nI think it occurred to me that I had already begun it, in my poor way:\nbut it occurs to me now, whether or no.\n\n\"You have heard 'the counting-house' mentioned sometimes,\" said Mr.\nMurdstone.\n\n\"The counting-house, sir?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Of Murdstone and Grinby, in the wine trade,\" he replied.\n\nI suppose I looked uncertain, for he went on hastily:\n\n\"You have heard the 'counting-house' mentioned, or the business, or the\ncellars, or the wharf, or something about it.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard the business mentioned, sir,\" I said, remembering\nwhat I vaguely knew of his and his sister's resources. \"But I don't know\nwhen.\"\n\n\"It does not matter when,\" he returned. \"Mr. Quinion manages that\nbusiness.\"\n\nI glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out of window.\n\n\"Mr. Quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other boys, and\nthat he sees no reason why it shouldn't, on the same terms, give\nemployment to you.\"\n\n\"He having,\" Mr. Quinion observed in a low voice, and half turning\nround, \"no other prospect, Murdstone.\"\n\nMr. Murdstone, with an impatient, even an angry gesture, resumed,\nwithout noticing what he had said:\n\n\"Those terms are, that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for\nyour eating and drinking, and pocket-money. Your lodging (which I have\narranged for) will be paid by me. So will your washing--\"\n\n\"--Which will be kept down to my estimate,\" said his sister.\n\n\"Your clothes will be looked after for you, too,\" said Mr. Murdstone;\n\"as you will not be able, yet awhile, to get them for yourself. So you\nare now going to London, David, with Mr. Quinion, to begin the world on\nyour own account.\"\n\n\"In short, you are provided for,\" observed his sister; \"and will please\nto do your duty.\"\n\nThough I quite understood that the purpose of this announcement was to\nget rid of me, I have no distinct remembrance whether it pleased or\nfrightened me. My impression is, that I was in a state of confusion\nabout it, and, oscillating between the two points, touched neither. Nor\nhad I much time for the clearing of my thoughts, as Mr. Quinion was to\ngo upon the morrow.\n\nBehold me, on the morrow, in a much-worn little white hat, with a black\ncrape round it for my mother, a black jacket, and a pair of hard stiff\ncorduroy trousers--which Miss Murdstone considered the best armour for\nthe legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off: behold\nme so attired, and with my little worldly all before me in a small\ntrunk, sitting, a lone lorn child (as Mrs. Gummidge might have said), in\nthe postchaise that was carrying Mr. Quinion to the London coach at\nYarmouth! See, how our house and church are lessening in the distance;\nhow the grave beneath the tree is blotted out by intervening objects;\nhow the spire points upward from my old playground no more, and the sky\nis empty!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nI BEGIN LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT, AND DON'T LIKE IT.\n\n\nI know enough of the world now, to have almost lost the capacity of\nbeing much surprised by anything; but it is matter of some surprise to\nme, even now, that I can have been so easily thrown away at such an age.\nA child of excellent abilities, and with strong powers of observation,\nquick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt bodily or mentally, it seems\nwonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf. But\nnone was made; and I became, at ten years old, a little labouring hind\nin the service of Murdstone and Grinby.\n\nMurdstone and Grinby's warehouse was at the water side. It was down in\nBlackfriars. Modern improvements have altered the place; but it was the\nlast house at the bottom of a narrow street, curving down hill to the\nriver, with some stairs at the end, where people took boat. It was a\ncrazy old house with a wharf of its own, abutting on the water when the\ntide was in, and on the mud when the tide was out, and literally overrun\nwith rats. Its panelled rooms, discolored with the dirt and smoke of a\nhundred years, I dare say; its decaying floors and staircase; the\nsqueaking and scuffling of the old grey rats down in the cellars; and\nthe dirt and rottenness of the place; are things, not of many years ago,\nin my mind, but of the present instant. They are all before me, just as\nthey were in the evil hour when I went among them for the first time,\nwith my trembling hand in Mr. Quinion's.\n\nMurdstone and Grinby's trade was among a good many kinds of people, but\nan important branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to certain\npacket ships. I forget now where they chiefly went, but I think there\nwere some among them that made voyages both to the East and West Indies.\nI know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of\nthis traffic, and that certain men and boys were employed to examine\nthem against the light, and reject those that were flawed, and to rinse\nand wash them. When the empty bottles ran short, there were labels to be\npasted on full ones, or corks to be fitted to them, or seals to be put\nupon the corks, or finished bottles to be packed in casks. All this work\nwas my work, and of the boys employed upon it I was one.\n\nThere were three or four of us, counting me. My working place was\nestablished in a corner of the warehouse, where Mr. Quinion could see\nme, when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the\ncounting-house, and look at me through a window above the desk. Hither,\non the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own\naccount, the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my\nbusiness. His name was Mick Walker, and he wore a ragged apron and a\npaper cap. He informed me that his father was a bargeman, and walked, in\na black velvet head-dress, in the Lord Mayor's Show. He also informed me\nthat our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by\nthe--to me--extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however,\nthat this youth had not been christened by that name, but that it had\nbeen bestowed upon him in the warehouse, on account of his complexion,\nwhich was pale or mealy. Mealy's father was a waterman, who had the\nadditional distinction of being a fireman, and was engaged as such at\none of the large theatres; where some young relation of Mealy's--I think\nhis little sister--did Imps in the Pantomimes.\n\nNo words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this\ncompanionship; compared these henceforth every-day associates with those\nof my happier childhood--not to say with Steerforth, Traddles, and the\nrest of those boys; and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and\ndistinguished man, crushed in my bosom. The deep remembrance of the\nsense I had, of being utterly without hope now; of the shame I felt in\nmy position; of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day\nby day what I had learned, and thought, and delighted in, and raised my\nfancy and my emulation up by, would pass away from me, little by little,\nnever to be brought back any more; cannot be written. As often as Mick\nWalker went away in the course of that forenoon, I mingled my tears with\nthe water in which I was washing the bottles; and sobbed as if there\nwere a flaw in my own breast, and it were in danger of bursting.\n\nThe counting-house clock was at half-past twelve, and there was general\npreparation for going to dinner, when Mr. Quinion tapped at the\ncounting-house window, and beckoned to me to go in. I went in, and found\nthere a stoutish, middle-aged person, in a brown surtout and black\ntights and shoes, with no more hair upon his head (which was a large\none, and very shining) than there is upon an egg, and with a very\nextensive face, which he turned full upon me. His clothes were shabby,\nbut he had an imposing shirt-collar on. He carried a jaunty sort of a\nstick, with a large pair of rusty tassels to it; and a quizzing-glass\nhung outside his coat,--for ornament, I afterwards found, as he very\nseldom looked through it, and couldn't see anything when he did.\n\n\"This,\" said Mr. Quinion, in allusion to myself, \"is he.\"\n\n\"This,\" said the stranger, with a certain condescending roll in his\nvoice, and a certain indescribable air of doing something genteel, which\nimpressed me very much, \"is Master Copperfield. I hope I see you well,\nsir?\"\n\nI said I was very well, and hoped he was. I was sufficiently ill at\nease, Heaven knows; but it was not in my nature to complain much at that\ntime of my life, so I said I was very well, and hoped he was.\n\n\"I am,\" said the stranger, \"thank Heaven, quite well. I have received\na letter from Mr. Murdstone, in which he mentions that he would desire\nme to receive into an apartment in the rear of my house, which is\nat present unoccupied--and is, in short, to be let as a--in short,\"\nsaid the stranger, with a smile and in a burst of confidence, \"as a\nbed-room--the young beginner whom I have now the pleasure to--\" and the\nstranger waved his hand, and settled his chin in his shirt collar.\n\n\"This is Mr. Micawber,\" said Mr. Quinion to me.\n\n\"Ahem!\" said the stranger, \"that is my name.\"\n\n\"Mr. Micawber,\" said Mr. Quinion, \"is known to Mr. Murdstone. He takes\norders for us on commission, when he can get any. He has been written to\nby Mr. Murdstone, on the subject of your lodgings, and he will receive\nyou as a lodger.\"\n\n\"My address,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"is Windsor Terrace, City Road. I--in\nshort,\" said Mr. Micawber, with the same genteel air, and in another\nburst of confidence--\"I live there.\"\n\nI made him a bow.\n\n\"Under the impression,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"that your peregrinations in\nthis metropolis have not as yet been extensive, and that you might have\nsome difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the Modern Babylon in the\ndirection of the City Road--in short,\" said Mr. Micawber, in another\nburst of confidence, \"that you might lose yourself--I shall be happy to\ncall this evening, and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way.\"\n\nI thanked him with all my heart, for it was friendly in him to offer to\ntake that trouble.\n\n\"At what hour,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"shall I--\"\n\n\"At about eight,\" said Mr. Quinion.\n\n\"At about eight,\" said Mr. Micawber. \"I beg to wish you good day, Mr.\nQuinion. I will intrude no longer.\"\n\nSo he put on his hat, and went out with his cane under his arm: very\nupright, and humming a tune when he was clear of the counting-house.\n\nMr. Quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as I could in the\nwarehouse of Murdstone and Grinby, at a salary, I think, of six\nshillings a week. I am not clear whether it was six or seven. I am\ninclined to believe, from my uncertainty on this head, that it was six\nat first and seven afterwards. He paid me a week down (from his own\npocket, I believe), and I gave Mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk\ncarried to Windsor Terrace at night: it being too heavy for my strength,\nsmall as it was. I paid sixpence more for my dinner, which was a meat\npie and a turn at a neighbouring pump; and passed the hour which was\nallowed for that meal, in walking about the streets.\n\nAt the appointed time in the evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared. I washed\nmy hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, and we\nwalked to our house, as I suppose I must now call it, together; Mr.\nMicawber impressing the names of streets, and the shapes of corner\nhouses upon me, as we went along, that I might find my way back, easily,\nin the morning.\n\nArrived at his house in Windsor Terrace (which I noticed was shabby like\nhimself, but also, like himself, made all the show it could), he\npresented me to Mrs. Micawber, a thin and faded lady, not at all young,\nwho was sitting in the parlor (the first floor was altogether\nunfurnished, and the blinds were kept down to delude the neighbours),\nwith a baby at her breast. This baby was one of twins; and I may remark\nhere that I hardly ever, in all my experience of the family, saw both\nthe twins detached from Mrs. Micawber at the same time. One of them was\nalways taking refreshment.\n\nThere were two other children; Master Micawber, aged about four, and\nMiss Micawber, aged about three. These, and a dark-complexioned young\nwoman, with a habit of snorting, who was servant to the family, and\ninformed me, before half-an-hour had expired, that she was \"a Orfling,\"\nand came from St. Luke's workhouse, in the neighbourhood, completed the\nestablishment. My room was at the top of the house, at the back: a close\nchamber; stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination\nrepresented as a blue muffin; and very scantily furnished.\n\n\"I never thought,\" said Mrs. Micawber, when she came up, twin and all,\nto show me the apartment, and sat down to take breath, \"before I was\nmarried, when I lived with papa and mama, that I should ever find it\nnecessary to take a lodger. But Mr. Micawber being in difficulties, all\nconsiderations of private feeling must give way.\"\n\nI said: \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Mr. Micawber's difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present,\"\nsaid Mrs. Micawber; \"and whether it is possible to bring him through\nthem, I don't know. When I lived at home with papa and mama, I really\nshould have hardly understood what the word meant, in the sense in which\nI now employ it, but experientia does it--as papa used to say.\"\n\nI cannot satisfy myself whether she told me that Mr. Micawber had been\nan officer in the Marines, or whether I have imagined it. I only know\nthat I believe to this hour that he _was_ in the Marines once upon a\ntime, without knowing why. He was a sort of town traveller for a number\nof miscellaneous houses, now; but made little or nothing of it, I am\nafraid.\n\n\"If Mr. Micawber's creditors _will not_ give him time,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, \"they must take the consequences; and the sooner they bring it\nto an issue the better. Blood cannot be obtained from a stone, neither\ncan anything on account be obtained at present (not to mention law\nexpenses) from Mr. Micawber.\"\n\nI never can quite understand whether my precocious self-dependence\nconfused Mrs. Micawber in reference to my age, or whether she was so\nfull of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very\ntwins if there had been nobody else to communicate with, but this was\nthe strain in which she began, and she went on accordingly all the time\nI knew her.\n\nPoor Mrs. Micawber! She said she had tried to exert herself; and so, I\nhave no doubt, she had. The centre of the street-door was perfectly\ncovered with a great brass-plate, on which was engraved \"Mrs. Micawber's\nBoarding Establishment for Young Ladies:\" but I never found that any\nyoung lady had ever been to school there; or that any young lady ever\ncame, or proposed to come; or that the least preparation was ever made\nto receive any young lady. The only visitors I ever saw or heard of,\nwere creditors. _They_ used to come at all hours, and some of them were\nquite ferocious. One dirty-faced man, I think he was a bootmaker, used\nto edge himself into the passage as early as seven o'clock in the\nmorning, and call up the stairs to Mr. Micawber--\"Come! You ain't out\nyet, you know. Pay us, will you? Don't hide, you know; that's mean. I\nwouldn't be mean if I was you. Pay us, will you? You just pay us, d'ye\nhear? Come!\" Receiving no answer to these taunts, he would mount in his\nwrath to the words \"swindlers\" and \"robbers;\" and these being\nineffectual too, would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the\nstreet, and roaring up at the windows of the second floor, where he knew\nMr. Micawber was. At these times, Mr. Micawber would be transported with\ngrief and mortification, even to the length (as I was once made aware by\na scream from his wife) of making motions at himself with a razor; but\nwithin half an hour afterwards, he would polish up his shoes with\nextraordinary pains, and go out, humming a tune with a greater air of\ngentility than ever. Mrs. Micawber was quite as elastic. I have known\nher to be thrown into fainting fits by the king's taxes at three\no'clock, and to eat lamb-chops, breaded, and drink warm ale (paid for\nwith two tea-spoons that had gone to the pawnbroker's) at four. On one\noccasion, when an execution had just been put in, coming home through\nsome chance as early as six o'clock, I saw her lying (of course with a\ntwin) under the grate in a swoon, with her hair all torn about her face;\nbut I never knew her more cheerful than she was, that very same night,\nover a veal-cutlet before the kitchen fire, telling me stories about her\npapa and mama, and the company they used to keep.\n\nIn this house, and with this family, I passed my leisure time. My own\nexclusive breakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk, I provided\nmyself. I kept another small loaf, and a modicum of cheese, on a\nparticular shelf of a particular cupboard, to make my supper on when I\ncame back at night. This made a hole in the six or seven shillings, I\nknow well; and I was out at the warehouse all day, and had to support\nmyself on that money all the week. From Monday morning until Saturday\nnight, I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no\nassistance, no support, of any kind, from any one, that I can call to\nmind, as I hope to go to heaven!\n\nI was so young and childish, and so little qualified--how could I be\notherwise?--to undertake the whole charge of my own existence, that\noften, in going to Murdstone and Grinby's, of a morning, I could\nnot resist the stale pastry put out for sale at half-price at the\npastrycook's doors, and spent in that, the money I should have kept\nfor my dinner. Then, I went without my dinner, or bought a roll or a\nslice of pudding. I remember two pudding-shops, between which I was\ndivided, according to my finances. One was in a court close to St.\nMartin's Church--at the back of the church,--which is now removed\naltogether. The pudding at that shop was made of currants, and was\nrather a special pudding, but was dear, twopennyworth not being larger\nthan a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding. A good shop for the latter\nwas in the Strand--somewhere in that part which has been rebuilt since.\nIt was a stout pale pudding, heavy and flabby, and with great flat\nraisins in it, stuck in whole at wide distances apart. It came up hot\nat about my time every day, and many a day did I dine off it. When I\ndined regularly and handsomely, I had a saveloy and a penny-loaf, or a\nfourpenny plate of red beef from a cook's shop; or a plate of bread and\ncheese and a glass of beer, from a miserable old public-house opposite\nour place of business, called the Lion, or the Lion and something else\nthat I have forgotten. Once, I remember carrying my own bread (which I\nhad brought from home in the morning) under my arm, wrapped in a piece\nof paper, like a book, and going to a famous alamode beef-house near\nDrury Lane, and ordering a \"small plate\" of that delicacy to eat with\nit. What the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition coming\nin all alone, I don't know; but I can see him now, staring at me as I\nate my dinner, and bringing up the other waiter to look. I gave him a\nhalfpenny for himself, and I wish he hadn't taken it.\n\nWe had half-an-hour, I think, for tea. When I had money enough, I\nused to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread\nand butter. When I had none, I used to look at a venison-shop in\nFleet-street; or I have strolled, at such a time, as far as Covent\nGarden Market, and stared at the pine-apples. I was fond of wandering\nabout the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those dark\narches. I see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches, on\na little public-house close to the river, with an open space before it,\nwhere some coal-heavers were dancing; to look at whom, I sat down upon\na bench. I wonder what they thought of me!\n\nI was such a child, and so little, that frequently when I went into the\nbar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter, to moisten\nwhat I had had for dinner, they were afraid to give it me. I remember\none hot evening I went into the bar of a public-house, and said to the\nlandlord:\n\n\"What is your best--your _very best_--ale a glass?\" For it was a special\noccasion. I don't know what. It may have been my birth-day.\n\n\"Twopence-halfpenny,\" says the landlord, \"is the price of the Genuine\nStunning ale.\"\n\n\"Then,\" says I, producing the money, \"just draw me a glass of the\nGenuine Stunning, if you please, with a good head to it.\"\n\n  [Illustration: My magnificent order at the public-house.]\n\nThe landlord looked at me in return over the bar, from head to foot,\nwith a strange smile on his face; and instead of drawing the beer,\nlooked round the screen and said something to his wife. She came out\nfrom behind it, with her work in her hand, and joined him in surveying\nme. Here we stand, all three, before me now. The landlord in his shirt\nsleeves, leaning against the bar window-frame; his wife looking over the\nlittle half-door; and I, in some confusion, looking up at them from\noutside the partition. They asked me a good many questions; as, what my\nname was, how old I was, where I lived, how I was employed, and how I\ncame there. To all of which, that I might commit nobody, I invented, I\nam afraid, appropriate answers. They served me with the ale, though I\nsuspect it was not the Genuine Stunning; and the landlord's wife,\nopening the little half-door of the bar, and bending down, gave me my\nmoney back, and gave me a kiss that was half admiring and half\ncompassionate, but all womanly and good, I am sure.\n\nI know I do not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally, the\nscantiness of my resources or the difficulties of my life. I know that\nif a shilling were given me by Mr. Quinion at any time, I spent it in a\ndinner or a tea. I know that I worked, from morning until night, with\ncommon men and boys, a shabby child. I know that I lounged about the\nstreets, insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, but for\nthe mercy of God, I might easily have been, for any care that was taken\nof me, a little robber or a little vagabond.\n\nYet I held some station at Murdstone and Grinby's too. Besides that Mr.\nQuinion did what a careless man so occupied, and dealing with a thing so\nanomalous, could, to treat me as one upon a different footing from the\nrest, I never said, to man or boy, how it was that I came to be there,\nor gave the least indication of being sorry that I was there. That I\nsuffered in secret, and that I suffered exquisitely, no one ever knew\nbut I. How much I suffered, it is, as I have said already, utterly\nbeyond my power to tell. But I kept my own counsel, and I did my work. I\nknew from the first, that, if I could not do my work as well as any of\nthe rest, I could not hold myself above slight and contempt. I soon\nbecame at least as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other\nboys. Though perfectly familiar with them, my conduct and manner were\ndifferent enough from theirs to place a space between us. They and the\nmen generally spoke of me as \"the little gent,\" or \"the young\nSuffolker.\" A certain man named Gregory, who was foreman of the packers,\nand another named Tipp, who was the carman, and wore a red jacket, used\nto address me sometimes as \"David:\" but I think it was mostly when we\nwere very confidential, and when I had made some efforts to entertain\nthem, over our work, with some results of the old readings; which were\nfast perishing out of my remembrance. Mealy Potatoes uprose once, and\nrebelled against my being so distinguished; but Mick Walker settled him\nin no time.\n\nMy rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless, and\nabandoned, as such, altogether. I am solemnly convinced that I never for\none hour was reconciled to it, or was otherwise than miserably unhappy;\nbut I bore it; and even to Peggotty, partly for the love of her and\npartly for shame, never in any letter (though many passed between us)\nrevealed the truth.\n\nMr. Micawber's difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of\nmy mind. In my forlorn state I became quite attached to the family, and\nused to walk about, busy with Mrs. Micawber's calculations of ways and\nmeans, and heavy with the weight of Mr. Micawber's debts. On a Saturday\nnight, which was my grand treat,--partly because it was a great thing to\nwalk home with six or seven shillings in my pocket, looking into the\nshops and thinking what such a sum would buy, and partly because I went\nhome early,--Mrs. Micawber would make the most heart-rending confidences\nto me; also on a Sunday morning, when I mixed the portion of tea or\ncoffee I had bought over-night, in a little shaving pot, and sat late at\nmy breakfast. It was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob\nviolently at the beginning of one of these Saturday night conversations,\nand sing about Jack's delight being his lovely Nan, towards the end of\nit. I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears, and a\ndeclaration that nothing was now left but a jail; and go to bed making a\ncalculation of the expense of putting bow-windows to the house, \"in case\nanything turned up,\" which was his favourite expression. And Mrs.\nMicawber was just the same.\n\nA curious equality of friendship, originating, I suppose, in our\nrespective circumstances, sprung up between me and these people,\nnotwithstanding the ludicrous disparity in our years. But I never\nallowed myself to be prevailed upon to accept any invitation to eat and\ndrink with them out of their stock (knowing that they got on badly with\nthe butcher and baker, and had often not too much for themselves), until\nMrs. Micawber took me into her entire confidence. This she did one\nevening as follows:\n\n\"Master Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"I make no stranger of you,\nand therefore do not hesitate to say that Mr. Micawber's difficulties\nare coming to a crisis.\"\n\nIt made me very miserable to hear it, and I looked at Mrs. Micawber's\nred eyes with the utmost sympathy.\n\n\"With the exception of the heel of a Dutch cheese--which is not adapted\nto the wants of a young family\"--said Mrs. Micawber, \"there is really\nnot a scrap of anything in the larder. I was accustomed to speak of the\nlarder when I lived with papa and mama, and I use the word almost\nunconsciously. What I mean to express, is, that there is nothing to eat\nin the house.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" I said, in great concern.\n\nI had two or three shillings of my week's money in my pocket--from which\nI presume that it must have been on a Wednesday night when we held this\nconversation--and I hastily produced them, and with heartfelt emotion\nbegged Mrs. Micawber to accept of them as a loan. But that lady, kissing\nme, and making me put them back in my pocket, replied that she couldn't\nthink of it.\n\n\"No, my dear Master Copperfield,\" said she, \"far be it from my thoughts!\nBut you have a discretion beyond your years, and can render me another\nkind of service, if you will; and a service I will thankfully accept\nof.\"\n\nI begged Mrs. Micawber to name it.\n\n\"I have parted with the plate myself,\" said Mrs. Micawber. \"Six tea, two\nsalt, and a pair of sugars, I have at different times borrowed money on,\nin secret, with my own hands. But the twins are a great tie; and to me,\nwith my recollections of papa and mama, these transactions are very\npainful. There are still a few trifles that we could part with. Mr.\nMicawber's feelings would never allow _him_ to dispose of them; and\nClickett\"--this was the girl from the workhouse--\"being of a vulgar\nmind, would take painful liberties if so much confidence was reposed in\nher. Master Copperfield, if I might ask you\"--\n\nI understood Mrs. Micawber now, and begged her to make use of me to any\nextent. I began to dispose of the more portable articles of property\nthat very evening; and went out on a similar expedition almost every\nmorning, before I went to Murdstone and Grinby's.\n\nMr. Micawber had a few books on a little chiffonier, which he called the\nlibrary; and those went first. I carried them, one after another, to a\nbookstall in the City Road--one part of which, near our house, was\nalmost all bookstalls and bird-shops then--and sold them for whatever\nthey would bring, The keeper of this bookstall, who lived in a little\nhouse behind it, used to get tipsy every night, and to be violently\nscolded by his wife every morning. More than once, when I went there\nearly, I had audience of him in a turn-up bedstead, with a cut in his\nforehead or a black eye, bearing witness to his excesses over night (I\nam afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink), and he, with a shaking hand,\nendeavouring to find the needful shillings in one or other of the\npockets of his clothes, which lay upon the floor, while his wife, with a\nbaby in her arms and her shoes down at heel, never left off rating him.\nSometimes he had lost his money, and then he would ask me to call again;\nbut his wife had always got some--had taken his, I dare say, while he\nwas drunk--and secretly completed the bargain on the stairs, as we went\ndown together.\n\nAt the pawnbroker's shop, too, I began to be very well known. The\nprincipal gentleman who officiated behind the counter, took a good deal\nof notice of me; and often got me, I recollect, to decline a Latin noun\nor adjective, or to conjugate a Latin verb, in his ear, while he\ntransacted my business. After all these occasions Mrs. Micawber made a\nlittle treat, which was generally a supper; and there was a peculiar\nrelish in these meals which I well remember.\n\nAt last Mr. Micawber's difficulties came to a crisis, and he was\narrested early one morning, and carried over to the King's Bench Prison\nin the Borough. He told me, as he went out of the house, that the God of\nday had now gone down upon him--and I really thought his heart was\nbroken and mine too. But I heard, afterwards, that he was seen to play a\nlively game at skittles, before noon.\n\nOn the first Sunday after he was taken there, I was to go and see him,\nand have dinner with him. I was to ask my way to such a place, and just\nshort of that place I should see such another place, and just short of\nthat I should see a yard, which I was to cross, and keep straight on\nuntil I saw a turnkey. All this I did; and when at last I did see a\nturnkey (poor little fellow that I was!), and thought how, when Roderick\nRandom was in a debtor's prison, there was a man there with nothing on\nhim but an old rug, the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my\nbeating heart.\n\nMr. Micawber was waiting for me within the gate, and we went up to his\nroom (top story but one), and cried very much. He solemnly conjured me,\nI remember, to take warning by his fate; and to observe that if a man\nhad twenty pounds a-year for his income, and spent nineteen pounds\nnineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be happy, but that if he spent\ntwenty pounds one he would be miserable. After which he borrowed a\nshilling of me for porter, gave me a written order on Mrs. Micawber for\nthe amount, and put away his pocket-handkerchief, and cheered up.\n\nWe sat before a little fire, with two bricks put within the rusted\ngrate, one on each side, to prevent its burning too many coals; until\nanother debtor, who shared the room with Mr. Micawber, came in from the\nbakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our joint-stock repast. Then\nI was sent up to \"Captain Hopkins\" in the room overhead, with Mr.\nMicawber's compliments, and I was his young friend, and would Captain\nHopkins lend me a knife and fork.\n\nCaptain Hopkins lent me the knife and fork, with his compliments to Mr.\nMicawber. There was a very dirty lady in his little room, and two wan\ngirls, his daughters, with shock heads of hair. I thought it was better\nto borrow Captain Hopkins's knife and fork, than Captain Hopkins's comb.\nThe Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness, with large\nwhiskers, and an old, old brown great-coat with no other coat below it.\nI saw his bed rolled up in a corner; and what plates and dishes and pots\nhe had, on a shelf; and I divined (God knows how) that though the two\ngirls with the shock heads of hair were Captain Hopkins's children, the\ndirty lady was not married to Captain Hopkins. My timid station on his\nthreshhold was not occupied more than a couple of minutes at most; but I\ncame down again with all this in my knowledge, as surely as the knife\nand fork were in my hand.\n\nThere was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner, after all. I\ntook back Captain Hopkins's knife and fork early in the afternoon, and\nwent home to comfort Mrs. Micawber with an account of my visit. She\nfainted when she saw me return, and made a little jug of egg-hot\nafterwards to console us while we talked it over.\n\nI don't know how the household furniture came to be sold for the family\nbenefit, or who sold it, except that _I_ did not. Sold it was, however,\nand carried away in a van; except the bed, a few chairs, and the\nkitchen-table. With these possessions we encamped, as it were, in the\ntwo parlors of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, the\nchildren, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those rooms night and\nday. I have no idea for how long, though it seems to me for a long time.\nAt last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr.\nMicawber had now secured a room to himself. So I took the key of the\nhouse to the landlord, who was very glad to get it; and the beds were\nsent over to the King's Bench, except mine, for which a little room was\nhired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution, very\nmuch to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had become too used\nto one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewise\naccommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine\nwas a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant\nprospect of a timber-yard; and when I took possession of it, with the\nreflection that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I\nthought it quite a paradise.\n\nAll this time I was working at Murdstone and Grinby's in the same common\nway, and with the same common companions, and with the same sense of\nunmerited degradation as at first. But I never, happily for me no doubt,\nmade a single acquaintance, or spoke to any of the many boys whom I saw\ndaily in going to the warehouse, in coming from it, and in prowling\nabout the streets at meal-times. I led the same secretly unhappy life;\nbut I led it in the same lonely, self-reliant manner. The only changes I\nam conscious of are, firstly, that I had grown more shabby, and\nsecondly, that I was now relieved of much of the weight of Mr. and Mrs.\nMicawber's cares; for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them\nat their present pass, and they lived more comfortably in the prison\nthan they had lived for a long while out of it. I used to breakfast with\nthem now, in virtue of some arrangement, of which I have forgotten the\ndetails. I forget, too, at what hour the gates were opened in the\nmorning, admitting of my going in; but I know that I was often up at six\no'clock, and that my favorite lounging-place in the interval was old\nLondon Bridge, where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses,\nwatching the people going by, or to look over the balustrades at the sun\nshining in the water, and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the\nMonument. The Orfling met me here sometimes, to be told some astonishing\nfictions respecting the wharves and the Tower; of which I can say no\nmore than that I hope I believed them myself. In the evening I used to\ngo back to the prison, and walk up and down the parade with Mr.\nMicawber; or play casino with Mrs. Micawber, and hear reminiscences of\nher papa and mama. Whether Mr. Murdstone knew where I was, I am unable\nto say. I never told them at Murdstone and Grinby's.\n\nMr. Micawber's affairs, although past their crisis, were very much\ninvolved by reason of a certain \"Deed,\" of which I used to hear a great\ndeal, and which I suppose, now, to have been some former composition\nwith his creditors, though I was so far from being clear about it then,\nthat I am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal\nparchments which are held to have, once upon a time, obtained to a great\nextent in Germany. At last this document appeared to be got out of the\nway, somehow; at all events it ceased to be the rock-ahead it had been;\nand Mrs. Micawber informed me that \"her family\" had decided that Mr.\nMicawber should apply for his release under the Insolvent Debtors Act,\nwhich would set him free, she expected, in about six weeks.\n\n\"And then,\" said Mr. Micawber, who was present, \"I have no doubt I\nshall, please Heaven, begin to be beforehand with the world, and to live\nin a perfectly new manner, if--in short, if anything turns up.\"\n\nBy way of going in for anything that might be on the cards, I call to\nmind that Mr. Micawber, about this time, composed a petition to the\nHouse of Commons, praying for an alteration in the law of imprisonment\nfor debt. I set down this remembrance here, because it is an instance to\nmyself of the manner in which I fitted my old books to my altered life,\nand made stories for myself, out of the streets, and out of men and\nwomen; and how some main points in the character I shall unconsciously\ndevelope, I suppose, in writing my life, were gradually forming all this\nwhile.\n\nThere was a club in the prison, in which Mr. Micawber, as a gentleman,\nwas a great authority. Mr. Micawber had stated his idea of this petition\nto the club, and the club had strongly approved of the same. Wherefore\nMr. Micawber (who was a thoroughly good-natured man, and as active a\ncreature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed, and never\nso happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any\nprofit to him) set to work at the petition, invented it, engrossed it on\nan immense sheet of paper, spread it out on a table, and appointed a\ntime for all the club, and all within the walls if they chose, to come\nup to his room and sign it.\n\nWhen I heard of this approaching ceremony, I was so anxious to see them\nall come in, one after another, though I knew the greater part of them\nalready, and they me, that I got an hour's leave of absence from\nMurdstone and Grinby's, and established myself in a corner for that\npurpose. As many of the principal members of the club as could be got\ninto the small room without filling it, supported Mr. Micawber in front\nof the petition, while my old friend Captain Hopkins (who had washed\nhimself, to do honor to so solemn an occasion) stationed himself close\nto it, to read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents. The\ndoor was then thrown open, and the general population began to come in,\nin a long file: several waiting outside, while one entered, affixed his\nsignature, and went out. To everybody in succession, Captain Hopkins\nsaid: \"Have you read it?\"--\"No.\"--\"Would you like to hear it read?\" If\nhe weakly showed the least disposition to hear it, Captain Hopkins, in a\nloud sonorous voice, gave him every word of it. The Captain would have\nread it twenty thousand times, if twenty thousand people would have\nheard him, one by one. I remember a certain luscious roll he gave to\nsuch phrases as \"The people's representatives in Parliament assembled,\"\n\"Your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honorable house,\" \"His\ngracious Majesty's unfortunate subjects,\" as if the words were something\nreal in his mouth, and delicious to taste; Mr. Micawber, meanwhile,\nlistening with a little of an author's vanity, and contemplating (not\nseverely) the spikes on the opposite wall.\n\nAs I walked to and fro daily between Southwark and Blackfriars, and\nlounged about at meal-times in obscure streets, the stones of which may,\nfor anything I know, be worn at this moment by my childish feet, I\nwonder how many of these people were wanting in the crowd that used to\ncome filing before me in review again, to the echo of Captain Hopkins's\nvoice! When my thoughts go back, now, to that slow agony of my youth, I\nwonder how much of the histories I invented for such people hangs like a\nmist of fancy over well-remembered facts! When I tread the old ground, I\ndo not wonder that I seem to see and pity, going on before me, an\ninnocent romantic boy, making his imaginative world out of such strange\nexperiences and sordid things!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nLIKING LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT NO BETTER, I FORM A GREAT RESOLUTION.\n\n\nIn due time, Mr. Micawber's petition was ripe for hearing; and that\ngentleman was ordered to be discharged under the act, to my great joy.\nHis creditors were not implacable; and Mrs. Micawber informed me that\neven the revengeful bootmaker had declared in open court that he bore\nhim no malice, but that when money was owing to him he liked to be paid.\nHe said he thought it was human nature.\n\nMr. Micawber returned to the King's Bench when his case was over, as\nsome fees were to be settled, and some formalities observed, before he\ncould be actually released. The club received him with transport, and\nheld an harmonic meeting that evening in his honor; while Mrs. Micawber\nand I had a lamb's fry in private, surrounded by the sleeping family.\n\n\"On such an occasion I will give you, Master Copperfield,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, \"in a little more flip,\" for we had been having some already,\n\"the memory of my papa and mama.\"\n\n\"Are they dead, ma'am?\" I enquired, after drinking the toast in a\nwine-glass.\n\n\"My mama departed this life,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"before Mr. Micawber's\ndifficulties commenced, or at least before they became pressing. My papa\nlived to bail Mr. Micawber several times, and then expired, regretted by\na numerous circle.\"\n\nMrs. Micawber shook her head, and dropped a pious tear upon the twin who\nhappened to be in hand.\n\nAs I could hardly hope for a more favourable opportunity of putting a\nquestion in which I had a near interest, I said to Mrs. Micawber:\n\n\"May I ask, ma'am, what you and Mr. Micawber intend to do, now that Mr.\nMicawber is out of his difficulties, and at liberty? Have you settled\nyet?\"\n\n\"My family,\" said Mrs. Micawber, who always said those two words with an\nair, though I never could discover who came under the denomination, \"my\nfamily are of opinion that Mr. Micawber should quit London, and exert\nhis talents in the country. Mr. Micawber is a man of great talent,\nMaster Copperfield.\"\n\nI said I was sure of that.\n\n\"Of great talent,\" repeated Mrs. Micawber. \"My family are of opinion,\nthat, with a little interest, something might be done for a man of his\nability in the Custom House. The influence of my family being local, it\nis their wish that Mr. Micawber should go down to Plymouth. They think\nit indispensable that he should be upon the spot.\"\n\n\"That he may be ready?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Exactly,\" returned Mrs. Micawber. \"That he may be ready--in case of\nanything turning up.\"\n\n\"And do you go too, ma'am?\"\n\nThe events of the day, in combination with the twins, if not with the\nflip, had made Mrs. Micawber hysterical, and she shed tears as she\nreplied:\n\n\"I never will desert Mr. Micawber. Mr. Micawber may have concealed his\ndifficulties from me in the first instance, but his sanguine temper may\nhave led him to expect that he would overcome them. The pearl necklace\nand bracelets which I inherited from mama, have been disposed of for\nless than half their value; and the set of coral, which was the wedding\ngift of my papa, has been actually thrown away for nothing. But I never\nwill desert Mr. Micawber. No!\" cried Mrs. Micawber, more affected than\nbefore, \"I never will do it! It's of no use asking me!\"\n\nI felt quite uncomfortable--as if Mrs. Micawber supposed I had asked her\nto do anything of the sort!--and sat looking at her in alarm.\n\n\"Mr. Micawber has his faults. I do not deny that he is improvident. I do\nnot deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his\nliabilities, both,\" she went on, looking at the wall; \"but I never will\ndesert Mr. Micawber!\"\n\nMrs. Micawber having now raised her voice into a perfect scream, I was\nso frightened that I ran off to the club-room, and disturbed Mr.\nMicawber in the act of presiding at a long table, and leading the chorus\nof\n\n    Gee up, Dobbin,\n    Gee ho, Dobbin,\n    Gee up, Dobbin,\n    Gee up, and gee ho--o--o!\n\n--with the tidings that Mrs. Micawber was in an alarming state, upon\nwhich he immediately burst into tears, and came away with me with his\nwaistcoat full of the heads and tails of shrimps, of which he had been\npartaking.\n\n\"Emma, my angel!\" cried Mr. Micawber, running into the room; \"what is\nthe matter?\"\n\n\"I never will desert you, Micawber!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"My life!\" said Mr. Micawber, taking her in his arms. \"I am perfectly\naware of it.\"\n\n\"He is the parent of my children! He is the father of my twins! He is\nthe husband of my affections,\" cried Mrs. Micawber, struggling; \"and I\nne--ver--will--desert Mr. Micawber!\"\n\nMr. Micawber was so deeply affected by this proof of her devotion (as to\nme, I was dissolved in tears), that he hung over her in a passionate\nmanner, imploring her to look up, and to be calm. But the more he asked\nMrs. Micawber to look up, the more she fixed her eyes on nothing; and\nthe more he asked her to compose herself, the more she wouldn't.\nConsequently Mr. Micawber was soon so overcome, that he mingled his\ntears with hers and mine; until he begged me to do him the favor of\ntaking a chair on the staircase, while he got her into bed. I would have\ntaken my leave for the night, but he would not hear of my doing that\nuntil the strangers' bell should ring. So I sat at the staircase window,\nuntil he came out with another chair and joined me.\n\n\"How is Mrs. Micawber now, sir?\" I said.\n\n\"Very low,\" said Mr. Micawber, shaking his head; \"re-action. Ah, this\nhas been a dreadful day! We stand alone now--everything is gone from\nus!\"\n\nMr. Micawber pressed my hand, and groaned, and afterwards shed tears. I\nwas greatly touched, and disappointed too, for I had expected that we\nshould be quite gay on this happy and long-looked for occasion. But Mr.\nand Mrs. Micawber were so used to their old difficulties, I think, that\nthey felt quite shipwrecked when they came to consider that they were\nreleased from them. All their elasticity was departed, and I never saw\nthem half so wretched as on this night; insomuch that when the bell\nrang, and Mr. Micawber walked with me to the lodge, and parted from me\nthere with a blessing, I felt quite afraid to leave him by himself, he\nwas so profoundly miserable.\n\nBut through all the confusion and lowness of spirits in which we had\nbeen, so unexpectedly to me, involved, I plainly discerned that Mr. and\nMrs. Micawber and their family were going away from London, and that a\nparting between us was near at hand. It was in my walk home that night,\nand in the sleepless hours which followed when I lay in bed, that the\nthought first occurred to me--though I don't know how it came into my\nhead--which afterwards shaped itself into a settled resolution.\n\nI had grown to be so accustomed to the Micawbers, and had been so\nintimate with them in their distresses, and was so utterly friendless\nwithout them, that the prospect of being thrown upon some new shift for\na lodging, and going once more among unknown people, was like being that\nmoment turned adrift into my present life, with such a knowledge of it\nready made, as experience had given me. All the sensitive feelings it\nwounded so cruelly, all the shame and misery it kept alive within my\nbreast, became more poignant as I thought of this; and I determined that\nthe life was unendurable.\n\nThat there was no hope of escape from it, unless the escape was my own\nact, I knew quite well. I rarely heard from Miss Murdstone, and never\nfrom Mr. Murdstone: but two or three parcels of made or mended clothes\nhad come up for me, consigned to Mr. Quinion, and in each there was a\nscrap of paper to the effect that J. M. trusted D. C. was applying\nhimself to business, and devoting himself wholly to his duties--not the\nleast hint of my ever being any thing else than the common drudge into\nwhich I was fast settling down.\n\nThe very next day showed me, while my mind was in the first agitation of\nwhat it had conceived, that Mrs. Micawber had not spoken of their going\naway without warrant. They took a lodging in the house where I lived,\nfor a week; at the expiration of which time they were to start for\nPlymouth. Mr. Micawber himself came down to the counting-house, in the\nafternoon, to tell Mr. Quinion that he must relinquish me on the day of\nhis departure, and to give me a high character, which I am sure I\ndeserved. And Mr. Quinion, calling in Tipp the carman, who was a married\nman, and had a room to let, quartered me prospectively on him--by our\nmutual consent, as he had every reason to think; for I said nothing,\nthough my resolution was now taken.\n\nI passed my evenings with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, during the remaining\nterm of our residence under the same roof; and I think we became fonder\nof one another as the time went on. On the last Sunday, they invited me\nto dinner; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce, and a pudding. I\nhad bought a spotted wooden horse over-night as a parting gift to little\nWilkins Micawber--that was the boy--and a doll for little Emma. I had\nalso bestowed a shilling on the Orfling, who was about to be disbanded.\n\nWe had a very pleasant day, though we were all in a tender state about\nour approaching separation.\n\n\"I shall never, Master Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"revert to the\nperiod when Mr. Micawber was in difficulties, without thinking of you.\nYour conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging\ndescription. You have never been a lodger. You have been a friend.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber; \"Copperfield,\" for so he had been\naccustomed to call me, of late, \"has a heart to feel for the distresses\nof his fellow creatures when they are behind a cloud, and a head to\nplan, and a hand to----in short, a general ability to dispose of such\navailable property as could be made away with.\"\n\nI expressed my sense of this commendation, and said I was very sorry we\nwere going to lose one another.\n\n\"My dear young friend,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"I am older than you; a man\nof some experience in life, and--and of some experience, in short, in\ndifficulties, generally speaking. At present, and until something turns\nup (which I am, I may say, hourly expecting), I have nothing to bestow\nbut advice. Still my advice is so far worth taking, that--in short, that\nI have never taken it myself, and am the\"--here Mr. Micawber, who had\nbeen beaming and smiling, all over his head and face, up to the present\nmoment, checked himself and frowned--\"the miserable wretch you behold.\"\n\n\"My dear Micawber!\" urged his wife.\n\n\"I say,\" returned Mr. Micawber, quite forgetting himself, and smiling\nagain, \"the miserable wretch you behold. My advice is, never do\nto-morrow what you can do to-day. Procrastination is the thief of time.\nCollar him!\"\n\n\"My poor papa's maxim,\" Mrs. Micawber observed.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"your papa was very well in his way, and\nHeaven forbid that I should disparage him. Take him for all in all, we\nne'er shall--in short, make the acquaintance, probably, of anybody else\npossessing, at his time of life, the same legs for gaiters, and able to\nread the same description of print, without spectacles. But he applied\nthat maxim to our marriage, my dear; and that was so far prematurely\nentered into, in consequence, that I never recovered the expence.\"\n\nMr. Micawber looked aside at Mrs. Micawber, and added: \"Not that I am\nsorry for it. Quite the contrary, my love.\" After which, he was grave\nfor a minute or so.\n\n\"My other piece of advice, Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"you know.\nAnnual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six,\nresult happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty\npounds ought and six, result misery. The blossom is blighted, the leaf\nis withered, the god of day goes down upon the dreary scene, and--and in\nshort you are for ever floored. As I am!\"\n\nTo make his example the more impressive, Mr. Micawber drank a glass of\npunch with an air of great enjoyment and satisfaction, and whistled the\nCollege Hornpipe.\n\nI did not fail to assure him that I would store these precepts in\nmy mind, though indeed I had no need to do so, for, at the time,\nthey affected me visibly. Next morning I met the whole family at the\ncoach-office, and saw them, with a desolate heart, take their places\noutside, at the back.\n\n\"Master Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"God bless you! I never can\nforget all that, you know, and I never would if I could.\"\n\n\"Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"farewell! Every happiness and\nprosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade\nmyself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel\nthat I had not occupied another man's place in existence altogether in\nvain. In case of anything turning up (of which I am rather confident), I\nshall be extremely happy if it should be in my power to improve your\nprospects.\"\n\nI think, as Mrs. Micawber sat at the back of the coach, with the\nchildren, and I stood in the road looking wistfully at them, a mist\ncleared from her eyes, and she saw what a little creature I really was.\nI think so, because she beckoned to me to climb up, with quite a new and\nmotherly expression in her face, and put her arm round my neck, and gave\nme just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy. I had barely\ntime to get down again before the coach started, and I could hardly see\nthe family for the handkerchiefs they waved. It was gone in a minute.\nThe Orfling and I stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of\nthe road, and then shook hands and said good bye; she going back, I\nsuppose, to Saint Luke's workhouse, as I went to begin my weary day at\nMurdstone and Grinby's.\n\nBut with no intention of passing many more weary days there. No. I had\nresolved to run away.--To go, by some means or other, down into the\ncountry, to the only relation I had in the world, and tell my story to\nmy aunt, Miss Betsey.\n\nI have already observed that I don't know how this desperate idea came\ninto my brain. But, once there, it remained there; and hardened into a\npurpose than which I have never entertained a more determined purpose in\nmy life. I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful\nin it, but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into\nexecution.\n\nAgain, and again, and a hundred times again, since the night when the\nthought had first occurred to me and banished sleep, I had gone over\nthat old story of my poor mother's about my birth, which it had been one\nof my great delights in the old time to hear her tell, and which I knew\nby heart. My aunt walked into that story, and walked out of it, a dread\nand awful personage; but there was one little trait in her behaviour\nwhich I liked to dwell on, and which gave me some faint shadow of\nencouragement. I could not forget how my mother had thought that she\nfelt her touch her pretty hair with no ungentle hand; and though it\nmight have been altogether my mother's fancy, and might have had no\nfoundation whatever in fact, I made a little picture, out of it, of my\nterrible aunt relenting towards the girlish beauty that I recollected so\nwell and loved so much, which softened the whole narrative. It is very\npossible that it had been in my mind a long time, and had gradually\nengendered my determination.\n\nAs I did not even know where Miss Betsey lived, I wrote a long letter to\nPeggotty, and asked her, incidentally, if she remembered; pretending\nthat I had heard of such a lady living at a certain place I named at\nrandom, and had a curiosity to know if it were the same. In the course\nof that letter, I told Peggotty that I had a particular occasion for\nhalf a guinea; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could\nrepay it, I should be very much obliged to her, and would tell her\nafterwards what I had wanted it for.\n\nPeggotty's answer soon arrived, and was, as usual, full of affectionate\ndevotion. She enclosed the half guinea (I was afraid she must have had a\nworld of trouble to get it out of Mr. Barkis's box), and told me that\nMiss Betsey lived near Dover, but whether at Dover itself, at Hythe,\nSandgate, or Folkstone, she could not say. One of our men, however,\ninforming me on my asking him about these places, that they were all\nclose together, I deemed this enough for my object, and resolved to set\nout at the end of that week.\n\nBeing a very honest little creature, and unwilling to disgrace the\nmemory I was going to leave behind me at Murdstone and Grinby's, I\nconsidered myself bound to remain until Saturday night; and, as I had\nbeen paid a week's wages in advance when I first came there, not to\npresent myself in the counting-house at the usual hour, to receive my\nstipend. For this express reason, I had borrowed the half-guinea, that I\nmight not be without a fund for my travelling-expenses. Accordingly,\nwhen the Saturday night came, and we were all waiting in the warehouse\nto be paid, and Tipp the carman, who always took precedence, went in\nfirst to draw his money, I shook Mick Walker by the hand; asked him when\nit came to his turn to be paid, to say to Mr. Quinion that I had gone to\nmove my box to Tipp's; and, bidding a last good night to Mealy Potatoes,\nran away.\n\nMy box was at my old lodging, over the water, and I had written a\ndirection for it on the back of one of our address cards that we nailed\non the casks: \"Master David, to be left till called for, at the Coach\nOffice, Dover.\" This I had in my pocket ready to put on the box, after I\nshould have got it out of the house; and as I went towards my lodging, I\nlooked about me for some one who would help me to carry it to the\nbooking-office.\n\nThere was a long-legged young man with a very little empty donkey-cart,\nstanding near the Obelisk, in the Blackfriars Road, whose eye I caught\nas I was going by, and who, addressing me as \"Sixpenn'orth of bad\nha'pence,\" hoped \"I should know him agin to swear to\"--in allusion, I\nhave no doubt, to my staring at him. I stopped to assure him that I had\nnot done so in bad manners, but uncertain whether he might or might not\nlike a job.\n\n\"Wot job?\" said the long-legged young man.\n\n\"To move a box,\" I answered.\n\n\"Wot box?\" said the long-legged young man.\n\nI told him mine, which was down that street there, and which I wanted\nhim to take to the Dover coach-office for sixpence.\n\n\"Done with you for a tanner!\" said the long-legged young man, and\ndirectly got upon his cart, which was nothing but a large wooden-tray on\nwheels, and rattled away at such a rate, that it was as much as I could\ndo to keep pace with the donkey.\n\nThere was a defiant manner about this young man, and particularly about\nthe way in which he chewed straw as he spoke to me, that I did not much\nlike; as the bargain was made, however, I took him up-stairs to the room\nI was leaving, and we brought the box down, and put it on his cart. Now,\nI was unwilling to put the direction-card on there, lest any of my\nlandlord's family should fathom what I was doing, and detain me; so I\nsaid to the young man that I would be glad if he would stop for a\nminute, when he came to the dead-wall of the King's Bench prison. The\nwords were no sooner out of my mouth, than he rattled away as if he, my\nbox, the cart, and the donkey, were all equally mad; and I was quite out\nof breath with running and calling after him, when I caught him at the\nplace appointed.\n\nBeing much flushed and excited, I tumbled my half-guinea out of my\npocket in pulling the card out. I put it in my mouth for safety, and\nthough my hands trembled a good deal, had just tied the card on very\nmuch to my satisfaction, when I felt myself violently chucked under the\nchin by the long-legged young man, and saw my half-guinea fly out of my\nmouth into his hand.\n\n\"Wot!\" said the young man, seizing me by my jacket collar, with a\nfrightful grin. \"This is a pollis case, is it? You're a going to bolt,\nare you? Come to the pollis, you young warmin, come to the pollis!\"\n\n\"You give me my money back, if you please,\" said I, very much\nfrightened; \"and leave me alone.\"\n\n\"Come to the pollis!\" said the young man. \"You shall prove it yourn to\nthe pollis.\"\n\n\"Give me my box and money, will you,\" I cried, bursting into tears.\n\nThe young man still replied: \"Come to the pollis!\" and was dragging me\nagainst the donkey in a violent manner, as if there were any affinity\nbetween that animal and a magistrate, when he changed his mind, jumped\ninto the cart, sat upon my box, and, exclaiming that he would drive to\nthe pollis straight, rattled away harder than ever.\n\nI ran after him as fast as I could, but I had no breath to call out\nwith, and should not have dared to call out, now, if I had. I narrowly\nescaped being run over, twenty times at least, in half a mile. Now I\nlost him, now I saw him, now I lost him, now I was cut at with a whip,\nnow shouted at, now down in the mud, now up again, now running into\nsomebody's arms, now running headlong at a post. At length, confused by\nfright and heat, and doubting whether half London might not by this time\nbe turning out for my apprehension, I left the young man to go where he\nwould with my box and money; and, panting and crying, but never\nstopping, faced about for Greenwich, which I had understood was on the\nDover Road: taking very little more out of the world, towards the\nretreat of my aunt, Miss Betsey, than I had brought into it, on the\nnight when my arrival gave her so much umbrage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE SEQUEL OF MY RESOLUTION.\n\n\nFor anything I know, I may have had some wild idea of running all the\nway to Dover, when I gave up the pursuit of the young man with the\ndonkey cart, and started for Greenwich. My scattered senses were soon\ncollected as to that point, if I had; for I came to a stop in the\nKent Road, at a terrace with a piece of water before it, and a great\nfoolish image in the middle, blowing a dry shell. Here I sat down on\na door-step, quite spent and exhausted with the efforts I had already\nmade, and with hardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and\nhalf-guinea.\n\nIt was by this time dark; I heard the clocks strike ten, as I sat\nresting. But it was a summer night, fortunately, and fine weather. When\nI had recovered my breath, and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my\nthroat, I rose up and went on. In the midst of my distress, I had no\nnotion of going back. I doubt if I should have had any, though there had\nbeen a Swiss snow-drift in the Kent Road.\n\nBut my standing possessed of only three-halfpence in the world (and I am\nsure I wonder how _they_ came to be left in my pocket on a Saturday\nnight!) troubled me none the less because I went on. I began to picture\nto myself, as a scrap of newspaper intelligence, my being found dead in\na day or two, under some hedge; and I trudged on miserably, though as\nfast as I could, until I happened to pass a little shop, where it was\nwritten up that ladies' and gentlemen's wardrobes were bought, and that\nthe best price was given for rags, bones, and kitchen-stuff. The master\nof this shop was sitting at the door in his shirt sleeves, smoking; and\nas there were a great many coats and pairs of trowsers dangling from the\nlow ceiling, and only two feeble candles burning inside to show what\nthey were, I fancied that he looked like a man of a revengeful\ndisposition, who had hung all his enemies, and was enjoying himself.\n\nMy late experiences with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber suggested to me that here\nmight be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while. I went up\nthe next bye-street, took off my waistcoat, rolled it neatly under my\narm, and came back to the shop-door. \"If you please, sir,\" I said, \"I am\nto sell this for a fair price.\"\n\nMr. Dolloby--Dolloby was the name over the shop-door, at least--took the\nwaistcoat, stood his pipe on its head against the door-post, went into\nthe shop, followed by me, snuffed the two candles with his fingers,\nspread the waistcoat on the counter, and looked at it there, held it up\nagainst the light, and looked at it there, and ultimately said:\n\n\"What do you call a price, now, for this here little weskit?\"\n\n\"Oh! you know best, sir,\" I returned, modestly.\n\n\"I can't be buyer and seller too,\" said Mr. Dolloby. \"Put a price on\nthis here little weskit.\"\n\n\"Would eighteenpence be\"--I hinted, after some hesitation.\n\nMr. Dolloby rolled it up again, and gave it me back. \"I should rob my\nfamily,\" he said, \"if I was to offer ninepence for it.\"\n\nThis was a disagreeable way of putting the business; because it imposed\nupon me, a perfect stranger, the unpleasantness of asking Mr. Dolloby to\nrob his family on my account. My circumstances being so very pressing,\nhowever, I said I would take ninepence for it, if he pleased. Mr.\nDolloby, not without some grumbling, gave ninepence. I wished him good\nnight, and walked out of the shop, the richer by that sum, and the\npoorer by a waistcoat. But when I buttoned my jacket, that was not much.\n\nIndeed, I foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next, and that\nI should have to make the best of my way to Dover in a shirt and a pair\nof trowsers, and might deem myself lucky if I got there even in that\ntrim. But my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed.\nBeyond a general impression of the distance before me, and of the young\nman with the donkey-cart having used me cruelly, I think I had no very\nurgent sense of my difficulties when I once again set off with my\nninepence in my pocket.\n\nA plan had occurred to me for passing the night, which I was going to\ncarry into execution. This was, to lie behind the wall at the back of my\nold school, in a corner where there used to be a haystack. I imagined it\nwould be a kind of company to have the boys, and the bed-room where I\nused to tell the stories, so near me: although the boys would know\nnothing of my being there, and the bed-room would yield me no shelter.\n\nI had had a hard day's work, and was pretty well jaded when I came\nclimbing out, at last, upon the level of Blackheath. It cost me some\ntrouble to find out Salem House; but I found it, and I found a haystack\nin the corner, and I lay down by it; having first walked round the wall,\nand looked up at the windows, and seen that all was dark and silent\nwithin. Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down,\nwithout a roof above my head!\n\nSleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts, against whom\nhouse-doors were locked, and house-dogs barked, that night--and I\ndreamed of lying on my old school-bed, talking to the boys in my room;\nand found myself sitting upright, with Steerforth's name upon my lips,\nlooking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above\nme. When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour, a feeling stole\nupon me that made me get up, afraid of I don't know what, and walk\nabout. But the fainter glimmering of the stars, and the pale light in\nthe sky where the day was coming, reassured me: and my eyes being very\nheavy, I lay down again, and slept--though with a knowledge in my sleep\nthat it was cold--until the warm beams of the sun, and the ringing of\nthe getting-up bell at Salem House, awoke me. If I could have hoped that\nSteerforth was there, I would have lurked about until he came out alone;\nbut I knew he must have left long since. Traddles still remained,\nperhaps, but it was very doubtful; and I had not sufficient confidence\nin his discretion or good luck, however strong my reliance was on his\ngood-nature, to wish to trust him with my situation. So I crept away\nfrom the wall as Mr. Creakle's boys were getting up, and struck into the\nlong dusty track which I had first known to be the Dover road when I was\none of them, and when I little expected that any eyes would ever see me\nthe wayfarer I was now, upon it.\n\nWhat a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at Yarmouth!\nIn due time I heard the church-bells ringing, as I plodded on; and I met\npeople who were going to church; and I passed a church or two where the\ncongregation were inside, and the sound of singing came out into the\nsun-shine, while the beadle sat and cooled himself in the shade of the\nporch, or stood beneath the yew-tree, with his hand to his forehead,\nglowering at me going by. But the peace and rest of the old Sunday\nmorning were on everything, except me. That was the difference. I felt\nquite wicked in my dirt and dust, and with my tangled hair. But for the\nquiet picture I had conjured up, of my mother in her youth and beauty,\nweeping by the fire, and my aunt relenting to her, I hardly think I\nshould have had courage to go on until next day. But it always went\nbefore me, and I followed.\n\nI got, that Sunday, through three-and-twenty miles on the straight road,\nthough not very easily, for I was new to that kind of toil. I see\nmyself, as evening closes in, coming over the bridge at Rochester,\nfootsore and tired, and eating bread that I had bought for supper. One\nor two little houses, with the notice, \"Lodgings for Travellers,\"\nhanging out, had tempted me; but I was afraid of spending the few pence\nI had, and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers I\nhad met or overtaken. I sought no shelter, therefore, but the sky; and\ntoiling into Chatham,--which, in that night's aspect, is a mere dream of\nchalk, and drawbridges, and mastless ships in a muddy river, roofed like\nNoah's arks,--crept, at last, upon a sort of grass-grown battery\noverhanging a lane, where a sentry was walking to and fro. Here I lay\ndown, near a cannon; and, happy in the society of the sentry's\nfootsteps, though he knew no more of my being above him than the boys at\nSalem House had known of my lying by the wall, slept soundly until\nmorning.\n\nVery stiff and sore of foot I was in the morning, and quite dazed by the\nbeating of drums and marching of troops, which seemed to hem me in on\nevery side when I went down towards the long narrow street. Feeling that\nI could go but a very little way that day, if I were to reserve any\nstrength for getting to my journey's end, I resolved to make the sale of\nmy jacket its principal business. Accordingly, I took the jacket off,\nthat I might learn to do without it; and carrying it under my arm, began\na tour of inspection of the various slop-shops.\n\nIt was a likely place to sell a jacket in; for the dealers in\nsecond-hand clothes were numerous, and were, generally speaking, on the\nlook-out for customers at their shop-doors. But as most of them had,\nhanging up among their stock, an officer's coat or two, epaulettes and\nall, I was rendered timid by the costly nature of their dealings, and\nwalked about for a long time without offering my merchandize to any one.\n\nThis modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops,\nand such shops as Mr. Dolloby's, in preference to the regular dealers.\nAt last I found one that I thought looked promising, at the corner of a\ndirty lane, ending in an inclosure full of stinging nettles, against the\npalings of which some second-hand sailors' clothes, that seemed to have\noverflowed the shop, were fluttering among some cots, and rusty guns,\nand oilskin hats, and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of so\nmany sizes that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the\nworld.\n\nInto this shop, which was low and small, and which was darkened rather\nthan lighted by a little window, overhung with clothes, and was\ndescended into by some steps, I went with a palpitating heart; which was\nnot relieved when an ugly old man, with the lower part of his face all\ncovered with a stubbly grey beard, rushed out of a dirty den behind it,\nand seized me by the hair of my head. He was a dreadful old man to look\nat, in a filthy flannel waistcoat, and smelling terribly of rum. His\nbedstead, covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork, was in\nthe den he had come from, where another little window showed a prospect\nof more stinging nettles, and a lame donkey.\n\n\"Oh, what do you want?\" grinned this old man, in a fierce, monotonous\nwhine. \"Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want? Oh, my lungs, and\nliver, what do you want? Oh, goroo, goroo!\"\n\nI was so much dismayed by these words, and particularly by the\nrepetition of the last unknown one, which was a kind of rattle in his\nthroat, that I could make no answer; hereupon the old man, still holding\nme by the hair, repeated:\n\n\"Oh, what do you want? Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want? Oh, my\nlungs and liver, what do you want! Oh, goroo!\"--which he screwed out of\nhimself, with an energy that made his eyes start in his head.\n\n\"I wanted to know,\" I said, trembling, \"if you would buy a jacket.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's see the jacket!\" cried the old man. \"Oh, my heart on fire,\nshow the jacket to us! Oh, my eyes and limbs, bring the jacket out!\"\n\nWith that he took his trembling hands, which were like the claws of a\ngreat bird, out of my hair; and put on a pair of spectacles, not at all\nornamental to his inflamed eyes.\n\n\"Oh, how much for the jacket?\" cried the old man, after examining it.\n\"Oh--goroo!--how much for the jacket?\"\n\n\"Half-a-crown,\" I answered, recovering myself.\n\n\"Oh, my lungs and liver,\" cried the old man, \"no! Oh, my eyes, no! Oh,\nmy limbs, no! Eighteenpence. Goroo!\"\n\nEvery time he uttered this ejaculation, his eyes seemed to be in danger\nof starting out; and every sentence he spoke, he delivered in a sort of\ntune, always exactly the same, and more like a gust of wind, which\nbegins low, mounts up high, and falls again, than any other comparison I\ncan find for it.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, glad to have closed the bargain, \"I'll take\neighteenpence.\"\n\n\"Oh, my liver!\" cried the old man, throwing the jacket on a shelf. \"Get\nout of the shop! Oh, my lungs, get out of the shop! Oh, my eyes and\nlimbs--goroo!--don't ask for money; make it an exchange.\"\n\nI never was so frightened in my life, before or since; but I told him\nhumbly that I wanted money, and that nothing else was of any use to me,\nbut that I would wait for it, as he desired, outside, and had no wish to\nhurry him. So I went outside, and sat down in the shade in a corner. And\nI sat there so many hours, that the shade became sunlight, and the\nsunlight became shade again, and still I sat there waiting for the\nmoney.\n\nThere never was such another drunken madman in that line of business, I\nhope. That he was well known in the neighbourhood, and enjoyed the\nreputation of having sold himself to the devil, I soon understood from\nthe visits he received from the boys, who continually came skirmishing\nabout the shop, shouting that legend, and calling to him to bring out\nhis gold. \"You ain't poor, you know, Charley, as you pretend. Bring out\nyour gold. Bring out some of the gold you sold yourself to the devil\nfor. Come! It's in the lining of the mattress, Charley. Rip it open and\nlet's have some!\" This, and many offers to lend him a knife for the\npurpose, exasperated him to such a degree, that the whole day was a\nsuccession of rushes on his part, and flights on the part of the boys.\nSometimes in his rage he would take me for one of them, and come at me,\nmouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces; then, remembering me,\njust in time, would dive into the shop, and lie upon his bed, as I\nthought from the sound of his voice, yelling in a frantic way, to his\nown windy tune, the Death of Nelson; with an Oh! before every line, and\ninnumerable Goroos interspersed. As if this were not bad enough for me,\nthe boys, connecting me with the establishment, on account of the\npatience and perseverance with which I sat outside, half-dressed, pelted\nme, and used me very ill all day.\n\nHe made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange; at one\ntime coming out with a fishing-rod, at another with a fiddle, at another\nwith a cocked hat, at another with a flute. But I resisted all these\novertures, and sat there in desperation; each time asking him, with\ntears in my eyes, for my money or my jacket. At last he began to pay me\nin halfpence at a time; and was full two hours getting by easy stages to\na shilling.\n\n\"Oh, my eyes and limbs!\" he then cried, peeping hideously out of the\nshop, after a long pause, \"will you go for twopence more?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" I said; \"I shall be starved.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lungs and liver, will you go for threepence?\"\n\n\"I would go for nothing, if I could,\" I said, \"but I want the money\nbadly.\"\n\n\"Oh, go--roo!\" (it is really impossible to express how he twisted this\nejaculation out of himself, as he peeped round the doorpost at me,\nshowing nothing but his crafty old head); \"will you go for fourpence?\"\n\nI was so faint and weary that I closed with this offer; and taking the\nmoney out of his claw, not without trembling, went away more hungry and\nthirsty than I had ever been, a little before sunset. But at an expense\nof threepence I soon refreshed myself completely; and, being in better\nspirits then, limped seven miles upon my road.\n\nMy bed at night was under another haystack, where I rested comfortably,\nafter having washed my blistered feet in a stream, and dressed them as\nwell as I was able, with some cool leaves. When I took the road again\nnext morning, I found that it lay through a succession of hop-grounds\nand orchards. It was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to\nbe ruddy with ripe apples; and in a few places the hop-pickers were\nalready at work. I thought it all extremely beautiful, and made up my\nmind to sleep among the hops that night: imagining some cheerful\ncompanionship in the long perspectives of poles, with the graceful\nleaves twining round them.\n\nThe trampers were worse than ever that day, and inspired me with a\ndread that is yet quite fresh in my mind. Some of them were most\nferocious-looking ruffians, who stared at me as I went by; and\nstopped, perhaps, and called after me to come back and speak to them;\nand when I took to my heels, stoned me. I recollect one young fellow--a\ntinker, I suppose, from his wallet and brazier--who had a woman with\nhim, and who faced about and stared at me thus; and then roared to me\nin such a tremendous voice to come back, that I halted and looked round.\n\n\"Come here, when you're called,\" said the tinker, \"or I'll rip your\nyoung body open.\"\n\nI thought it best to go back. As I drew nearer to them, trying to\npropitiate the tinker by my looks, I observed that the woman had a black\neye.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" said the tinker, griping the bosom of my shirt\nwith his blackened hand.\n\n\"I am going to Dover,\" I said.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\" asked the tinker, giving his hand another turn\nin my shirt, to hold me more securely.\n\n\"I come from London,\" I said.\n\n\"What lay are you upon?\" asked the tinker. \"Are you a prig?\"\n\n\"N--no,\" I said.\n\n\"Ain't you, by G--? If you make a brag of your honesty to me,\" said the\ntinker, \"I'll knock your brains out.\"\n\nWith his disengaged hand he made a menace of striking me, and then\nlooked at me from head to foot.\n\n\"Have you got the price of a pint of beer about you?\" said the tinker.\n\"If you have, out with it, afore I take it away!\"\n\nI should certainly have produced it, but that I met the woman's look,\nand saw her very slightly shake her head, and form \"No!\" with her lips.\n\n\"I am very poor,\" I said, attempting to smile, \"and have got no money.\"\n\n\"Why, what do you mean?\" said the tinker, looking so sternly at me, that\nI almost feared he saw the money in my pocket.\n\n\"Sir!\" I stammered.\n\n\"What do you mean,\" said the tinker, \"by wearing my brother's silk\nhankercher? Give it over here!\" And he had mine off my neck in a moment,\nand tossed it to the woman.\n\nThe woman burst into a fit of laughter, as if she thought this a joke,\nand tossing it back to me, nodded once, as slightly as before, and made\nthe word \"Go!\" with her lips. Before I could obey, however, the tinker\nseized the handkerchief out of my hand with a roughness that threw me\naway like a feather, and putting it loosely round his own neck, turned\nupon the woman with an oath, and knocked her down. I never shall forget\nseeing her fall backward on the hard road, and lie there with her bonnet\ntumbled off, and her hair all whitened in the dust; nor, when I looked\nback from a distance, seeing her sitting on the pathway, which was a\nbank by the roadside, wiping the blood from her face with a corner of\nher shawl, while he went on ahead.\n\nThis adventure frightened me so, that, afterwards, when I saw any of\nthese people coming, I turned back until I could find a hiding-place,\nwhere I remained until they had gone out of sight; which happened so\noften, that I was very seriously delayed. But under this difficulty, as\nunder all the other difficulties of my journey, I seemed to be sustained\nand led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth, before I\ncame into the world. It always kept me company. It was there, among the\nhops, when I lay down to sleep; it was with me on my waking in the\nmorning; it went before me all day. I have associated it, ever since,\nwith the sunny street of Canterbury, dozing as it were in the hot light;\nand with the sight of its old houses and gateways, and the stately, grey\nCathedral, with the rooks sailing round the towers. When I came, at\nlast, upon the bare, wide downs near Dover, it relieved the solitary\naspect of the scene with hope; and not until I reached that first great\naim of my journey, and actually set foot in the town itself, on the\nsixth day of my flight, did it desert me. But then, strange to say, when\nI stood with my ragged shoes, and my dusty, sunburnt, half-clothed\nfigure, in the place so long desired, it seemed to vanish like a dream,\nand to leave me helpless and dispirited.\n\nI inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first, and received various\nanswers. One said she lived in the South Foreland Light, and had singed\nher whiskers by doing so; another, that she was made fast to the great\nbuoy outside the harbor, and could only be visited at half-tide; a\nthird, that she was locked up in Maidstone Jail for child-stealing; a\nfourth, that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind, and\nmake direct for Calais. The fly-drivers, among whom I inquired next,\nwere equally jocose and equally disrespectful; and the shopkeepers, not\nliking my appearance, generally replied, without hearing what I had to\nsay, that they had got nothing for me. I felt more miserable and\ndestitute than I had done at any period of my running away. My money was\nall gone, I had nothing left to dispose of; I was hungry, thirsty, and\nworn out; and seemed as distant from my end as if I had remained in\nLondon.\n\nThe morning had worn away in these inquiries, and I was sitting on the\nstep of an empty shop at a street corner, near the market-place,\ndeliberating upon wandering towards those other places which had been\nmentioned, when a fly-driver, coming by with his carriage, dropped a\nhorsecloth. Something good-natured in the man's face, as I handed it up,\nencouraged me to ask him if he could tell me where Miss Trotwood lived;\nthough I had asked the question so often, that it almost died upon my\nlips.\n\n\"Trotwood,\" said he. \"Let me see. I know the name, too. Old lady?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"rather.\"\n\n\"Pretty stiff in the back?\" said he, making himself upright.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I should think it very likely.\"\n\n\"Carries a bag?\" said he--\"bag with a good deal of room in it--is\ngruffish, and comes down upon you, sharp?\"\n\nMy heart sank within me as I acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of this\ndescription.\n\n\"Why then, I tell you what,\" said he. \"If you go up there,\" pointing\nwith his whip towards the heights, \"and keep right on till you come to\nsome houses facing the sea, I think you'll hear of her. My opinion is\nshe won't stand anything, so here's a penny for you.\"\n\nI accepted the gift thankfully, and bought a loaf with it. Dispatching\nthis refreshment by the way, I went in the direction my friend had\nindicated, and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he\nhad mentioned. At length I saw some before me; and approaching them,\nwent into a little shop (it was what we used to call a general shop, at\nhome), and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where\nMiss Trotwood lived. I addressed myself to a man behind the counter, who\nwas weighing some rice for a young woman; but the latter, taking the\ninquiry to herself, turned round quickly.\n\n\"My mistress?\" she said. \"What do you want with her, boy?\"\n\n\"I want,\" I replied, \"to speak to her, if you please.\"\n\n\"To beg of her, you mean,\" retorted the damsel.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"indeed.\" But suddenly remembering that in truth I came\nfor no other purpose, I held my peace in confusion, and felt my face\nburn.\n\nMy aunt's handmaid, as I supposed she was from what she had said, put\nher rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop; telling me that\nI could follow her, if I wanted to know where Miss Trotwood lived. I\nneeded no second permission; though I was by this time in such a state\nof consternation and agitation, that my legs shook under me. I followed\nthe young woman, and we soon came to a very neat little cottage with\ncheerful bow-windows: in front of it, a small square gravelled court or\ngarden full of flowers, carefully tended, and smelling deliciously.\n\n\"This is Miss Trotwood's,\" said the young woman. \"Now you know; and\nthat's all I have got to say.\" With which words she hurried into the\nhouse, as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance; and left\nme standing at the garden-gate, looking disconsolately over the top of\nit towards the parlor-window, where a muslin curtain partly undrawn\nin the middle, a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the\nwindow-sill, a small table, and a great chair, suggested to me that my\naunt might be at that moment seated in awful state.\n\nMy shoes were by this time in a woeful condition. The soles had shed\nthemselves bit by bit, and the upper leathers had broken and burst until\nthe very shape and form of shoes had departed from them. My hat (which\nhad served me for a night-cap, too) was so crushed and bent, that no old\nbattered handle-less saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to\nvie with it. My shirt and trowsers, stained with heat, dew, grass, and\nthe Kentish soil on which I had slept--and torn besides--might have\nfrightened the birds from my aunt's garden, as I stood at the gate. My\nhair had known no comb or brush since I left London. My face, neck, and\nhands, from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun, were burnt to a\nberry-brown. From head to foot I was powdered almost as white with chalk\nand dust, as if I had come out of a lime-kiln. In this plight, and with\na strong consciousness of it, I waited to introduce myself to, and make\nmy first impression on, my formidable aunt.\n\nThe unbroken stillness of the parlor-window leading me to infer, after\na-while, that she was not there, I lifted up my eyes to the window above\nit, where I saw a florid, pleasant-looking gentleman, with a grey head,\nwho shut up one eye in a grotesque manner, nodded his head at me several\ntimes, shook it at me as often, laughed, and went away.\n\nI had been discomposed enough before; but I was so much the more\ndiscomposed by this unexpected behaviour, that I was on the point of\nslinking off, to think how I had best proceed, when there came out of\nthe house a lady with a handkerchief tied over her cap, and a pair of\ngardening gloves on her hands, wearing a gardening pocket like a\ntollman's apron, and carrying a great knife. I knew her immediately to\nbe Miss Betsey, for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my\npoor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at\nBlunderstone Rookery.\n\n\"Go away!\" said Miss Betsey, shaking her head, and making a distant chop\nin the air with her knife. \"Go along! No boys here!\"\n\nI watched her, with my heart at my lips, as she marched to a corner of\nher garden, and stooped to dig up some little root there. Then, without\na scrap of courage, but with a great deal of desperation, I went softly\nin and stood beside her, touching her with my finger.\n\n\"If you please, ma'am,\" I began.\n\nShe started, and looked up.\n\n\"If you please, aunt.\"\n\n\"EH?\" exclaimed Miss Betsey, in a tone of amazement I have never heard\napproached.\n\n\"If you please, aunt, I am your nephew.\"\n\n  [Illustration: I make myself known to my Aunt.]\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" said my aunt. And sat flat down in the garden-path.\n\n\"I am David Copperfield, of Blunderstone, in Suffolk--where you came,\non the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama. I have been very\nunhappy since she died. I have been slighted, and taught nothing, and\nthrown upon myself, and put to work not fit for me. It made me run away\nto you. I was robbed at first setting out, and have walked all the\nway, and have never slept in a bed since I began the journey.\" Here my\nself-support gave way all at once; and with a movement of my hands,\nintended to show her my ragged state, and call it to witness that I had\nsuffered something, I broke into a passion of crying, which I suppose\nhad been pent up within me all the week.\n\nMy aunt, with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her\ncountenance, sat on the gravel, staring at me, until I began to cry;\nwhen she got up in a great hurry, collared me, and took me into the\nparlor. Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press, bring out\nseveral bottles, and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth. I\nthink they must have been taken out at random, for I am sure I tasted\naniseed water, anchovy sauce, and salad dressing. When she had\nadministered these restoratives, as I was still quite hysterical, and\nunable to controul my sobs, she put me on the sofa, with a shawl under\nmy head, and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet, lest I\nshould sully the cover; and then, sitting herself down behind the green\nfan or screen I have already mentioned, so that I could not see her\nface, ejaculated at intervals, \"Mercy on us!\" letting those exclamations\noff like minute guns.\n\nAfter a time she rang the bell. \"Janet,\" said my aunt, when her servant\ncame in. \"Go up stairs, give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and say I wish\nto speak to him.\"\n\nJanet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa (I\nwas afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt), but went\non her errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, walked up and down\nthe room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper\nwindow came in laughing.\n\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said my aunt, \"don't be a fool, because nobody can be more\ndiscreet than you can, when you choose. We all know that. So don't be a\nfool, whatever you are.\"\n\nThe gentleman was serious immediately, and looked at me, I thought, as\nif he would entreat me to say nothing about the window.\n\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said my aunt, \"you have heard me mention David Copperfield?\nNow don't pretend not to have a memory, because you and I know better.\"\n\n\"David Copperfield?\" said Mr. Dick, who did not appear to me to remember\nmuch about it. \"_David_ Copperfield? Oh yes, to be sure. David,\ncertainly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said my aunt, \"this is his boy--his son. He would be as like his\nfather as it's possible to be, if he was not so like his mother, too.\"\n\n\"His son?\" said Mr. Dick. \"David's son? Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" pursued my aunt, \"and he has done a pretty piece of business. He\nhas run away. Ah! His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would have run\naway.\" My aunt shook her head firmly, confident in the character and\nbehaviour of the girl who never was born.\n\n\"Oh! you think she wouldn't have run away?\" said Mr. Dick.\n\n\"Bless and save the man,\" exclaimed my aunt, sharply, \"how he talks!\nDon't I know she wouldn't? She would have lived with her god-mother, and\nwe should have been devoted to one another. Where, in the name of\nwonder, should his sister, Betsey Trotwood, have run from, or to?\"\n\n\"Nowhere,\" said Mr. Dick.\n\n\"Well then,\" returned my aunt, softened by the reply, \"how can you\npretend to be wool-gathering, Dick, when you are as sharp as a surgeon's\nlancet? Now, here you see young David Copperfield, and the question I\nput to you is, what shall I do with him?\"\n\n\"What shall you do with him?\" said Mr. Dick, feebly, scratching his\nhead. \"Oh! do with him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my aunt, with a grave look and her forefinger held up.\n\"Come! I want some very sound advice.\"\n\n\"Why, if I was you,\" said Mr. Dick, considering, and looking vacantly at\nme, \"I should--\" The contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a\nsudden idea, and he added, briskly, \"I should wash him!\"\n\n\"Janet,\" said my aunt, turning round with a quiet triumph, which I did\nnot then understand, \"Mr. Dick sets us all right. Heat the bath!\"\n\nAlthough I was deeply interested in this dialogue, I could not help\nobserving my aunt, Mr. Dick, and Janet, while it was in progress, and\ncompleting a survey I had already been engaged in making of the room.\n\nMy aunt was a tall, hard-featured lady, but by no means ill-looking.\nThere was an inflexibility in her face, in her voice, in her gait and\ncarriage, amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a\ngentle creature like my mother; but her features were rather handsome\nthan otherwise, though unbending and austere. I particularly noticed\nthat she had a very quick, bright eye. Her hair, which was grey, was\narranged in two plain divisions, under what I believe would be called a\nmob-cap: I mean a cap, much more common then than now, with side-pieces\nfastening under the chin. Her dress was of a lavender color, and\nperfectly neat; but scantily made, as if she desired to be as little\nencumbered as possible. I remember that I thought it, in form, more like\na riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off, than anything else.\nShe wore at her side a gentleman's gold watch, if I might judge from its\nsize and make, with an appropriate chain and seals; she had some linen\nat her throat not unlike a shirt-collar, and things at her wrists like\nlittle shirt-wristbands.\n\nMr. Dick, as I have already said, was grey-headed, and florid: I should\nhave said all about him, in saying so, had not his head been curiously\nbowed--not by age; it reminded me of one of Mr. Creakle's boys' heads\nafter a beating--and his grey eyes prominent and large, with a strange\nkind of watery brightness in them that made me, in combination with his\nvacant manner, his submission to my aunt, and his childish delight when\nshe praised him, suspect him of being a little mad; though, if he were\nmad, how he came to be there puzzled me extremely. He was dressed like\nany other ordinary gentleman, in a loose grey morning coat and\nwaistcoat, and white trowsers; and had his watch in his fob, and his\nmoney in his pockets: which he rattled as if he were very proud of it.\n\nJanet was a pretty blooming girl, of about nineteen or twenty, and a\nperfect picture of neatness. Though I made no further observation of her\nat the moment, I may mention here what I did not discover until\nafterwards, namely, that she was one of a series of prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9es whom my\naunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a renouncement\nof mankind, and who had generally completed their abjuration by marrying\nthe baker.\n\nThe room was as neat as Janet or my aunt. As I laid down my pen,\na moment since, to think of it, the air from the sea came blowing\nin again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers; and I saw the\nold-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished, my aunt's\ninviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bow-window,\nthe drugget-covered carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two\ncanaries, the old china, the punch-bowl full of dried rose leaves, the\ntall press guarding all sorts of bottles and pots, and, wonderfully out\nof keeping with the rest, my dusty self upon the sofa, taking note of\neverything.\n\nJanet had gone away to get the bath ready, when my aunt, to my great\nalarm, became in one moment rigid with indignation, and had hardly voice\nto cry out, \"Janet! Donkies!\"\n\nUpon which, Janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in\nflames, darted out on a little piece of green in front, and warned off\ntwo saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, that had presumed to set hoof upon it;\nwhile my aunt, rushing out of the house, seized the bridle of a third\nanimal laden with a bestriding child, turned him, led him forth from\nthose sacred precincts, and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchin in\nattendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground.\n\nTo this hour I don't know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way\nover that patch of green; but she had settled it in her own mind that\nshe had, and it was all the same to her. The one great outrage of her\nlife, demanding to be constantly avenged, was the passage of a donkey\nover that immaculate spot. In whatever occupation she was engaged,\nhowever interesting to her the conversation in which she was taking\npart, a donkey turned the current of her ideas in a moment, and she\nwas upon him straight. Jugs of water, and watering pots, were kept in\nsecret places ready to be discharged on the offending boys; sticks\nwere laid in ambush behind the door; sallies were made at all hours;\nand incessant war prevailed. Perhaps this was an agreeable excitement\nto the donkey-boys; or perhaps the more sagacious of the donkeys,\nunderstanding how the case stood, delighted with constitutional\nobstinacy in coming that way. I only know that there were three alarms\nbefore the bath was ready; and that on the occasion of the last and\nmost desperate of all, I saw my aunt engage, single-handed, with a\nsandy-headed lad of fifteen, and bump his sandy head against her\nown gate, before he seemed to comprehend what was the matter. These\ninterruptions were the more ridiculous to me, because she was giving me\nbroth out of a table-spoon at the time (having firmly persuaded herself\nthat I was actually starving, and must receive nourishment at first in\nvery small quantities), and, while my mouth was yet open to receive the\nspoon, she would put it back into the basin, cry \"Janet! Donkies!\" and\ngo out to the assault.\n\nThe bath was a great comfort. For I began to be sensible of acute pains\nin my limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and low\nthat I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together. When I\nhad bathed, they (I mean my aunt and Janet) enrobed me in a shirt and a\npair of trowsers belonging to Mr. Dick, and tied me up in two or three\ngreat shawls. What sort of bundle I looked like, I don't know, but I\nfelt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint and drowsy, I soon lay down\non the sofa again and fell asleep.\n\nIt might have been a dream, originating in the fancy which had occupied\nmy mind so long, but I awoke with the impression that my aunt had come\nand bent over me, and had put my hair away from my face, and laid my\nhead more comfortably, and had then stood looking at me. The words,\n\"Pretty fellow,\" or \"Poor fellow,\" seemed to be in my ears, too; but\ncertainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, to lead me to believe\nthat they had been uttered by my aunt, who sat in the bow-window gazing\nat the sea from behind the green fan, which was mounted on a kind of\nswivel, and turned any way.\n\nWe dined soon after I awoke, off a roast fowl and a pudding; I sitting\nat table, not unlike a trussed bird myself, and moving my arms with\nconsiderable difficulty. But as my aunt had swathed me up, I made no\ncomplaint of being inconvenienced. All this time, I was deeply anxious\nto know what she was going to do with me; but she took her dinner in\nprofound silence, except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me\nsitting opposite, and said, \"Mercy upon us!\" which did not by any means\nrelieve my anxiety.\n\nThe cloth being drawn, and some sherry put upon the table (of which I\nhad a glass), my aunt sent up for Mr. Dick again, who joined us, and\nlooked as wise as he could when she requested him to attend to my story,\nwhich she elicited from me, gradually, by a course of questions. During\nmy recital, she kept her eyes on Mr. Dick, who I thought would have gone\nto sleep but for that, and who, whensoever he lapsed into a smile, was\nchecked by a frown from my aunt.\n\n\"Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate Baby, that she must go and be\nmarried again,\" said my aunt, when I had finished, \"_I_ can't conceive.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband,\" Mr. Dick suggested.\n\n\"Fell in love!\" repeated my aunt, \"What do you mean? What business had\nshe to do it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Mr. Dick simpered, after thinking a little, \"she did it for\npleasure.\"\n\n\"Pleasure, indeed!\" replied my aunt. \"A mighty pleasure for the poor\nbaby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow, certain to\nill-use her in some way or other. What did she propose to herself,\nI should like to know! She had had one husband. She had seen David\nCopperfield out of the world, who was always running after wax dolls\nfrom his cradle. She had got a baby--oh, there were a pair of babies\nwhen she gave birth to this child sitting here, that Friday night!--and\nwhat more did she want?\"\n\nMr. Dick secretly shook his head at me, as if he thought there was no\ngetting over this.\n\n\"She couldn't even have a baby like anybody else,\" said my aunt, \"Where\nwas this child's sister, Betsey Trotwood! Not forthcoming. Don't tell\nme!\"\n\nMr. Dick seemed quite frightened.\n\n\"That little man of a doctor, with his head on one side,\" said my aunt,\n\"Jellips, or whatever his name was, what was _he_ about? All he could\ndo, was to say to me, like a robin redbreast--as he _is_--'It's a boy.'\nA boy! Yah, the imbecility of the whole set of 'em!\"\n\nThe heartiness of the ejaculation startled Mr. Dick exceedingly; and me,\ntoo, if I am to tell the truth.\n\n\"And then, as if this was not enough, and she had not stood sufficiently\nin the light of this child's sister, Betsey Trotwood,\" said my aunt,\n\"she marries a second time--goes and marries a Murderer--or a man with a\nname like it--and stands in _this_ child's light! And the natural\nconsequence is, as anybody but a baby might have foreseen, that he\nprowls and wanders. He's as like Cain before he was grown up, as he can\nbe.\"\n\nMr. Dick looked hard at me, as if to identify me in this character.\n\n\"And then there's that woman with the Pagan name,\" said my aunt, \"that\nPeggotty, _she_ goes and gets married next. Because she has not seen\nenough of the evil attending such things, _she_ goes and gets married\nnext, as the child relates. I only hope,\" said my aunt, shaking her\nhead, \"that her husband is one of those Poker husbands who abound in the\nnewspapers, and will beat her well with one.\"\n\nI could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried, and made the subject\nof such a wish. I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken. That\nPeggotty was the best, the truest, the most faithful, most devoted, and\nmost self-denying friend and servant in the world; who had ever loved me\ndearly, who had ever loved my mother dearly; who had held my mother's\ndying head upon her arm, on whose face my mother had imprinted her last\ngrateful kiss. And my remembrance of them both, choking me, I broke down\nas I was trying to say that her home was my home, and that all she had\nwas mine, and that I would have gone to her for shelter, but for her\nhumble station, which made me fear that I might bring some trouble on\nher--I broke down, I say, as I was trying to say so, and laid my face in\nmy hands upon the table.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said my aunt, \"the child is right to stand by those who\nhave stood by him--Janet! Donkies!\"\n\nI thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkies, we should\nhave come to a good understanding; for my aunt had laid her hand on my\nshoulder, and the impulse was upon me, thus emboldened, to embrace her\nand beseech her protection. But the interruption, and the disorder she\nwas thrown into by the struggle outside, put an end to all softer ideas\nfor the present; and kept my aunt indignantly declaiming to Mr. Dick\nabout her determination to appeal for redress to the laws of her\ncountry, and to bring actions for trespass against the whole donkey\nproprietorship of Dover, until tea-time.\n\nAfter tea, we sat at the window--on the look-out, as I imagined, from my\naunt's sharp expression of face, for more invaders--until dusk, when\nJanet set candles, and a backgammon-board, on the table, and pulled down\nthe blinds.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Dick,\" said my aunt, with her grave look, and her forefinger\nup as before, \"I am going to ask you another question. Look at this\nchild.\"\n\n\"David's son?\" said Mr. Dick, with an attentive, puzzled face.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" returned my aunt. \"What would you do with him, now?\"\n\n\"Do with David's son?\" said Mr. Dick.\n\n\"Ay,\" replied my aunt, \"with David's son.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Dick. \"Yes. Do with--I should put him to bed.\"\n\n\"Janet!\" cried my aunt, with the same complacent triumph that I had\nremarked before. \"Mr. Dick sets us all right. If the bed is ready, we'll\ntake him up to it.\"\n\nJanet reporting it to be quite ready, I was taken up to it; kindly, but\nin some sort like a prisoner; my aunt going in front and Janet bringing\nup the rear. The only circumstance which gave me any new hope, was my\naunt's stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was\nprevalent there; and Janet's replying that she had been making tinder\ndown in the kitchen, of my old shirt. But there were no other clothes in\nmy room than the odd heap of things I wore; and when I was left there,\nwith a little taper which my aunt forewarned me would burn exactly five\nminutes, I heard them lock my door on the outside. Turning these things\nover in my mind, I deemed it possible that my aunt, who could know\nnothing of me, might suspect I had a habit of running away, and took\nprecautions, on that account, to have me in safe keeping.\n\nThe room was a pleasant one, at the top of the house, overlooking the\nsea, on which the moon was shining brilliantly. After I had said my\nprayers, and the candle had burnt out, I remember how I still sat\nlooking at the moonlight on the water, as if I could hope to read my\nfortune in it, as in a bright book; or to see my mother with her child,\ncoming from Heaven, along that shining path, to look upon me as she had\nlooked when I last saw her sweet face. I remember how the solemn feeling\nwith which at length I turned my eyes away, yielded to the sensation of\ngratitude and rest which the sight of the white-curtained bed--and how\nmuch more the lying softly down upon it, nestling in the snow-white\nsheets!--inspired. I remember how I thought of all the solitary places\nunder the night sky where I had slept, and how I prayed that I never\nmight be houseless any more, and never might forget the houseless. I\nremember how I seemed to float, then, down the melancholy glory of that\ntrack upon the sea, away into the world of dreams.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME.\n\n\nOn going down in the morning, I found my aunt musing so profoundly over\nthe breakfast-table, with her elbow on the tray, that the contents of\nthe urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole table-cloth\nunder water, when my entrance put her meditations to flight. I felt sure\nthat I had been the subject of her reflections, and was more than ever\nanxious to know her intentions towards me. Yet I dared not express my\nanxiety, lest it should give her offence.\n\nMy eyes, however, not being so much under controul as my tongue, were\nattracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast. I never could\nlook at her for a few moments together but I found her looking at me--in\nan odd thoughtful manner, as if I were an immense way off, instead of\nbeing on the other side of the small round table. When she had finished\nher breakfast, my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her chair,\nknitted her brows, folded her arms, and contemplated me at her leisure,\nwith such a fixedness of attention that I was quite overpowered by\nembarrassment. Not having as yet finished my own breakfast, I attempted\nto hide my confusion by proceeding with it; but my knife tumbled over my\nfork, my fork tripped up my knife, I chipped bits of bacon a surprising\nheight into the air instead of cutting them for my own eating, and\nchoked myself with my tea which persisted in going the wrong way instead\nof the right one, until I gave in altogether, and sat blushing under my\naunt's close scrutiny.\n\n\"Hallo!\" said my aunt, after a long time.\n\nI looked up, and met her sharp bright glance respectfully.\n\n\"I have written to him,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"To--?\"\n\n\"To your father-in-law,\" said my aunt. \"I have sent him a letter that\nI'll trouble him to attend to, or he and I will fall out, I can tell\nhim!\"\n\n\"Does he know where I am, aunt?\" I inquired, alarmed.\n\n\"I have told him,\" said my aunt, with a nod.\n\n\"Shall I--be--given up to him?\" I faltered.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said my aunt. \"We shall see.\"\n\n\"Oh! I can't think what I shall do,\" I exclaimed, \"if I have to go back\nto Mr. Murdstone!\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" said my aunt, shaking her head. \"I\ncan't say, I am sure. We shall see.\"\n\nMy spirits sank under these words, and I became very downcast and heavy\nof heart. My aunt, without appearing to take much heed of me, put on a\ncoarse apron with a bib, which she took out of the press; washed up the\nteacups with her own hands; and, when everything was washed and set in\nthe tray again, and the cloth folded and put on the top of the whole,\nrang for Janet to remove it. She next swept up the crumbs with a little\nbroom (putting on a pair of gloves first), until there did not appear to\nbe one microscopic speck left on the carpet; next dusted and arranged\nthe room, which was dusted and arranged to a hair's breadth already.\nWhen all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction, she took off\nthe gloves and apron, folded them up, put them in the particular corner\nof the press from which they had been taken, brought out her work-box to\nher own table in the open window, and sat down, with the green fan\nbetween her and the light, to work.\n\n\"I wish you'd go up stairs,\" said my aunt, as she threaded her needle,\n\"and give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and I'll be glad to know how he\ngets on with his Memorial.\"\n\nI rose with all alacrity, to acquit myself of this commission.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said my aunt, eyeing me as narrowly as she had eyed the\nneedle in threading it, \"you think Mr. Dick a short name, eh?\"\n\n\"I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday,\" I confessed.\n\n\"You are not to suppose that he hasn't got a longer name, if he chose\nto use it,\" said my aunt, with a loftier air. \"Babley--Mr. Richard\nBabley--that's the gentleman's true name.\"\n\nI was going to suggest, with a modest sense of my youth and the\nfamiliarity I had been already guilty of, that I had better give him the\nfull benefit of that name, when my aunt went on to say:\n\n\"But don't you call him by it, whatever you do. He can't bear his name.\nThat's a peculiarity of his. Though I don't know that it's much of a\npeculiarity, either; for he has been ill-used enough, by some that bear\nit, to have a mortal antipathy for it, Heaven knows. Mr. Dick is his\nname here, and everywhere else, now--if he ever went anywhere else,\nwhich he don't. So take care, child, you don't call him anything _but_\nMr. Dick.\"\n\nI promised to obey, and went up-stairs with my message; thinking, as I\nwent, that if Mr. Dick had been working at his Memorial long, at the\nsame rate as I had seen him working at it, through the open door, when I\ncame down, he was probably getting on very well indeed. I found him\nstill driving at it with a long pen, and his head almost laid upon the\npaper. He was so intent upon it, that I had ample leisure to observe the\nlarge paper kite in a corner, the confusion of bundles of manuscript,\nthe number of pens, and, above all, the quantity of ink (which he seemed\nto have in, in half-gallon jars by the dozen), before he observed my\nbeing present.\n\n\"Ha! Phoebus!\" said Mr. Dick, laying down his pen. \"How does the world\ngo! I'll tell you what,\" he added, in a lower tone, \"I shouldn't wish it\nto be mentioned, but it's a--\" here he beckoned to me, and put his lips\nclose to my ear--\"it's a mad world. Mad as Bedlam, boy!\" said Mr. Dick,\ntaking snuff from a round box on the table, and laughing heartily.\n\nWithout presuming to give my opinion on this question, I delivered my\nmessage.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Dick, in answer, \"my compliments to her, and I--I\nbelieve I have made a start. I think I have made a start,\" said Mr.\nDick, passing his hand among his grey hair, and casting anything but a\nconfident look at his manuscript. \"You have been to school?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I answered; \"for a short time.\"\n\n\"Do you recollect the date,\" said Mr. Dick, looking earnestly at me, and\ntaking up his pen to note it down, \"when King Charles the First had his\nhead cut off?\"\n\nI said I believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and\nforty-nine.\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Dick, scratching his ear with his pen, and looking\ndubiously at me. \"So the books say; but I don't see how that can be.\nBecause, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made\nthat mistake of putting some of the trouble out of _his_ head, after it\nwas taken off, into _mine_?\"\n\nI was very much surprised by the inquiry; but could give no information\non this point.\n\n\"It's very strange,\" said Mr. Dick, with a despondent look upon his\npapers, and with his hand among his hair again, \"that I never can get\nthat quite right. I never can make that perfectly clear. But no matter,\nno matter!\" he said cheerfully, and rousing himself, \"there's time\nenough! My compliments to Miss Trotwood, I am getting on very well\nindeed.\"\n\nI was going away, when he directed my attention to the kite.\n\n\"What do you think of that for a kite?\" he said.\n\nI answered that it was a beautiful one. I should think it must have been\nas much as seven feet high.\n\n\"I made it. We'll go and fly it, you and I,\" said Mr. Dick. \"Do you see\nthis?\"\n\nHe showed me that it was covered with manuscript, very closely and\nlaboriously written; but so plainly, that as I looked along the lines, I\nthought I saw some allusion to King Charles the First's head again, in\none or two places.\n\n\"There's plenty of string,\" said Mr. Dick, \"and when it flies high, it\ntakes the facts a long way. That's my manner of diffusing 'em. I don't\nknow where they may come down. It's according to circumstances, and the\nwind, and so forth; but I take my chance of that.\"\n\nHis face was so very mild and pleasant, and had something so reverend in\nit, though it was hale and hearty, that I was not sure but that he was\nhaving a good-humoured jest with me. So I laughed, and he laughed, and\nwe parted the best friends possible.\n\n\"Well, child,\" said my aunt, when I went down stairs. \"And what of Mr.\nDick, this morning?\"\n\nI informed her that he sent his compliments, and was getting on very\nwell indeed.\n\n\"What do you think of him?\" said my aunt.\n\nI had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question, by\nreplying that I thought him a very nice gentleman; but my aunt was not\nto be so put off, for she laid her work down in her lap, and said,\nfolding her hands upon it:\n\n\"Come! Your sister Betsey Trotwood would have told me what she thought\nof any one, directly. Be as like your sister as you can, and speak out!\"\n\n\"Is he--is Mr. Dick--I ask because I don't know, aunt--is he at all out\nof his mind, then?\" I stammered; for I felt I was on dangerous ground.\n\n\"Not a morsel,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" I observed faintly.\n\n\"If there is anything in the world,\" said my aunt, with great decision\nand force of manner, \"that Mr. Dick is not, it's that.\"\n\nI had nothing better to offer, than another timid \"Oh, indeed!\"\n\n\"He has been _called_ mad,\" said my aunt. \"I have a selfish pleasure in\nsaying he has been called mad, or I should not have had the benefit of\nhis society and advice for these last ten years and upwards--in fact,\never since your sister, Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me.\"\n\n\"So long as that?\" I said.\n\n\"And nice people they were, who had the audacity to call him mad,\"\npursued my aunt. \"Mr. Dick is a sort of distant connexion of mine--it\ndoesn't matter how; I needn't enter into that. If it hadn't been for me,\nhis own brother would have shut him up for life. That's all.\"\n\nI am afraid it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt\nstrongly on the subject, I tried to look as if I felt strongly too.\n\n\"A proud fool!\" said my aunt. \"Because his brother was a little\neccentric--though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people--he\ndidn't like to have him visible about his house, and sent him away to\nsome private asylum-place; though he had been left to his particular\ncare by their deceased father, who thought him almost a natural. And a\nwise man _he_ must have been to think so! Mad himself, no doubt.\"\n\nAgain, as my aunt looked quite convinced, I endeavoured to look quite\nconvinced also.\n\n\"So I stepped in,\" said my aunt, \"and made him an offer. I said, Your\nbrother's sane--a great deal more sane than you are, or ever will be, it\nis to be hoped. Let him have his little income, and come and live with\nme. _I_ am not afraid of him, _I_ am not proud, _I_ am ready to take\ncare of him, and shall not ill-treat him as some people (besides the\nasylum folks) have done. After a good deal of squabbling,\" said my aunt,\n\"I got him; and he has been here ever since. He is the most friendly and\namenable creature in existence; and as for advice!--But nobody knows\nwhat that man's mind is, except myself.\"\n\nMy aunt smoothed her dress and shook her head, as if she smoothed\ndefiance of the whole world out of the one, and shook it out of the\nother.\n\n\"He had a favorite sister,\" said my aunt, \"a good creature, and very\nkind to him. But she did what they all do--took a husband. And _he_ did\nwhat they all do--made her wretched. It had such an effect upon the mind\nof Mr. Dick (_that's_ not madness I hope!) that, combined with his fear\nof his brother, and his sense of his unkindness, it threw him into a\nfever. That was before he came to me, but the recollection of it is\noppressive to him even now. Did he say anything to you about King\nCharles the First, child?\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said my aunt, rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed.\n\"That's his allegorical way of expressing it. He connects his illness\nwith great disturbance and agitation, naturally, and that's the figure,\nor the simile, or whatever it's called, which he chooses to use. And why\nshouldn't he, if he thinks proper!\"\n\nI said: \"Certainly, aunt.\"\n\n\"It's not a business-like way of speaking,\" said my aunt, \"nor a worldly\nway. I am aware of that; and that's the reason why I insist upon it,\nthat there shan't be a word about it in his Memorial.\"\n\n\"Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing, aunt?\"\n\n\"Yes, child,\" said my aunt, rubbing her nose again. \"He is memorialising\nthe Lord Chancellor, or the Lord Somebody or other--one of those people,\nat all events, who are paid to _be_ memorialised--about his affairs. I\nsuppose it will go in, one of these days. He hasn't been able to draw it\nup yet, without introducing that mode of expressing himself; but it\ndon't signify; it keeps him employed.\"\n\nIn fact, I found out afterwards that Mr. Dick had been for upwards of\nten years endeavouring to keep King Charles the First out of the\nMemorial; but he had been constantly getting into it, and was there now.\n\n\"I say again,\" said my aunt, \"nobody knows what that man's mind is\nexcept myself; and he's the most amenable and friendly creature in\nexistence. If he likes to fly a kite sometimes, what of that! Franklin\nused to fly a kite. He was a Quaker, or something of that sort, if I am\nnot mistaken. And a Quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous\nobject than anybody else.\"\n\nIf I could have supposed that my aunt had recounted these particulars\nfor my especial behoof, and as a piece of confidence in me, I should\nhave felt very much distinguished, and should have augured favourably\nfrom such a mark of her good opinion. But I could hardly help observing\nthat she had launched into them, chiefly because the question was raised\nin her own mind, and with very little reference to me, though she had\naddressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else.\n\nAt the same time, I must say that the generosity of her championship of\npoor harmless Mr. Dick, not only inspired my young breast with some\nselfish hope for myself, but warmed it unselfishly towards her. I\nbelieve that I began to know that there was something about my aunt,\nnotwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours, to be honored\nand trusted in. Though she was just as sharp that day, as on the day\nbefore, and was in and out about the donkeys just as often, and was\nthrown into a tremendous state of indignation, when a young man, going\nby, ogled Janet at a window (which was one of the gravest misdemeanors\nthat could be committed against my aunt's dignity), she seemed to me to\ncommand more of my respect, if not less of my fear.\n\nThe anxiety I underwent, in the interval which necessarily elapsed\nbefore a reply could be received to her letter to Mr. Murdstone, was\nextreme; but I made an endeavour to suppress it, and to be as agreeable\nas I could in a quiet way, both to my aunt and Mr. Dick. The latter and\nI would have gone out to fly the great kite; but that I had still no\nother clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which I had\nbeen decorated on the first day, and which confined me to the house,\nexcept for an hour after dark, when my aunt, for my health's sake,\nparaded me up and down on the cliff outside, before going to bed. At\nlength the reply from Mr. Murdstone came, and my aunt informed me, to my\ninfinite terror, that he was coming to speak to her himself on the next\nday. On the next day, still bundled up in my curious habiliments, I sat\ncounting the time, flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes\nand rising fears within me; and waiting to be startled by the sight of\nthe gloomy face, whose non-arrival startled me every minute.\n\nMy aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual, but I observed\nno other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much\ndreaded by me. She sat at work in the window, and I sat by, with my\nthoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of Mr.\nMurdstone's visit, until pretty late in the afternoon. Our dinner had\nbeen indefinitely postponed; but it was growing so late, that my aunt\nhad ordered it to be got ready, when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys,\nand to my consternation and amazement, I beheld Miss Murdstone, on a\nside-saddle, ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green, and stop\nin front of the house, looking about her.\n\n\"Go along with you!\" cried my aunt, shaking her head and her fist at the\nwindow. \"You have no business there. How dare you trespass? Go along!\nOh, you bold-faced thing!\"\n\nMy aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which Miss Murdstone\nlooked about her, that I really believe she was motionless, and unable\nfor the moment to dart out according to custom. I seized the opportunity\nto inform her who it was; and that the gentleman now coming near the\noffender (for the way up was very steep, and he had dropped behind), was\nMr. Murdstone himself.\n\n\"I don't care who it is!\" cried my aunt, still shaking her head, and\ngesticulating anything but welcome from the bow-window. \"I won't be\ntrespassed upon. I won't allow it. Go away! Janet, turn him round.\nLead him off!\" and I saw, from behind my aunt, a sort of hurried\nbattle-piece, in which the donkey stood resisting everybody, with all\nhis four legs planted different ways, while Janet tried to pull him\nround by the bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on, Miss Murdstone\nstruck at Janet with a parasol, and several boys, who had come to see\nthe engagement, shouted vigorously. But my aunt, suddenly descrying\namong them the young malefactor who was the donkey's guardian, and who\nwas one of the most inveterate offenders against her, though hardly\nin his teens, rushed out to the scene of action, pounced upon him,\ncaptured him, dragged him, with his jacket over his head, and his heels\ngrinding the ground, into the garden, and, calling upon Janet to fetch\nthe constables and justices that he might be taken, tried, and executed\non the spot, held him at bay there. This part of the business, however,\ndid not last long; for the young rascal, being expert at a variety\nof feints and dodges, of which my aunt had no conception, soon went\nwhooping away, leaving some deep impressions of his nailed boots in the\nflower-beds, and taking his donkey in triumph with him.\n\nMiss Murdstone, during the latter portion of the contest, had\ndismounted, and was now waiting with her brother at the bottom of the\nsteps, until my aunt should be at leisure to receive them. My aunt, a\nlittle ruffled by the combat, marched past them into the house, with\ngreat dignity, and took no notice of their presence, until they were\nannounced by Janet.\n\n\"Shall I go away, aunt?\" I asked, trembling.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said my aunt. \"Certainly not!\" With which she pushed me into\na corner near her, and fenced me in with a chair, as if it were a prison\nor a bar of justice. This position I continued to occupy during the\nwhole interview, and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the\nroom.\n\n  [Illustration: The momentous interview.]\n\n\"Oh!\" said my aunt, \"I was not aware at first to whom I had the pleasure\nof objecting. But I don't allow anybody to ride over that turf. I make\nno exceptions. I don't allow anybody to do it.\"\n\n\"Your regulation is rather awkward to strangers,\" said Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"Is it!\" said my aunt.\n\nMr. Murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities, and interposing\nbegan:\n\n\"Miss Trotwood!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" observed my aunt with a keen look. \"You are the Mr.\nMurdstone who married the widow of my late nephew, David Copperfield, of\nBlunderstone Rookery?--Though why Rookery, _I_ don't know!\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n\n\"You'll excuse my saying, sir,\" returned my aunt, \"that I think it would\nhave been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor\nchild alone.\"\n\n\"I so far agree with what Miss Trotwood has remarked,\" observed Miss\nMurdstone, bridling, \"that I consider our lamented Clara to have been,\nin all essential respects, a mere child.\"\n\n\"It is a comfort to you and me, ma'am,\" said my aunt, \"who are getting\non in life, and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal\nattractions, that nobody can say the same of us.\"\n\n\"No doubt!\" returned Miss Murdstone, though, I thought, not with a very\nready or gracious assent. \"And it certainly might have been, as you say,\na better and happier thing for my brother if he had never entered into\nsuch a marriage. I have always been of that opinion.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you have,\" said my aunt. \"Janet,\" ringing the bell, \"my\ncompliments to Mr. Dick, and beg him to come down.\"\n\nUntil he came, my aunt sat perfectly upright and stiff, frowning at the\nwall. When he came, my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction.\n\n\"Mr. Dick. An old and intimate friend. On whose judgment,\" said my aunt,\nwith emphasis, as an admonition to Mr. Dick, who was biting his\nforefinger and looking rather foolish, \"I rely.\"\n\nMr. Dick took his finger out of his mouth, on this hint, and stood among\nthe group, with a grave and attentive expression of face. My aunt\ninclined her head to Mr. Murdstone, who went on:\n\n\"Miss Trotwood: on the receipt of your letter, I considered it an act of\ngreater justice to myself, and perhaps of more respect to you--\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said my aunt, still eyeing him keenly. \"You needn't mind\nme.\"\n\n\"To answer it in person, however inconvenient the journey,\" pursued Mr.\nMurdstone, \"rather than by letter. This unhappy boy who has run away\nfrom his friends and his occupation--\"\n\n\"And whose appearance,\" interposed his sister, directing general\nattention to me in my indefinable costume, \"is perfectly scandalous and\ndisgraceful.\"\n\n\"Jane Murdstone,\" said her brother, \"have the goodness not to interrupt\nme. This unhappy boy, Miss Trotwood, has been the occasion of much\ndomestic trouble and uneasiness; both during the lifetime of my late\ndear wife, and since. He has a sullen, rebellious spirit; a violent\ntemper; and an untoward, intractable disposition. Both my sister and\nmyself have endeavoured to correct his vices, but ineffectually. And I\nhave felt--we both have felt, I may say; my sister being fully in my\nconfidence--that it is right you should receive this grave and\ndispassionate assurance from our lips.\"\n\n\"It can hardly be necessary for me to confirm anything stated by my\nbrother,\" said Miss Murdstone; \"but I beg to observe, that, of all the\nboys in the world, I believe this is the worst boy.\"\n\n\"Strong!\" said my aunt, shortly.\n\n\"But not at all too strong for the facts,\" returned Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"Ha!\" said my aunt. \"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"I have my own opinions,\" resumed Mr. Murdstone, whose face darkened\nmore and more, the more he and my aunt observed each other, which they\ndid very narrowly, \"as to the best mode of bringing him up; they are\nfounded, in part, on my knowledge of him, and in part on my knowledge of\nmy own means and resources. I am responsible for them to myself, I act\nupon them, and I say no more about them. It is enough that I place this\nboy under the eye of a friend of my own, in a respectable business; that\nit does not please him; that he runs away from it; makes himself a\ncommon vagabond about the country; and comes here, in rags, to appeal to\nyou, Miss Trotwood. I wish to set before you, honorably, the exact\nconsequences--so far as they are within my knowledge--of your abetting\nhim in this appeal.\"\n\n\"But about the respectable business first,\" said my aunt. \"If he had\nbeen your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"If he had been my brother's own boy,\" returned Miss Murdstone, striking\nin, \"his character, I trust, would have been altogether different.\"\n\n\"Or if the poor child, his mother, had been alive, he would still have\ngone into the respectable business, would he?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"I believe,\" said Mr. Murdstone, with an inclination of his head, \"that\nClara would have disputed nothing, which myself and my sister Jane\nMurdstone were agreed was for the best.\"\n\nMiss Murdstone confirmed this, with an audible murmur.\n\n\"Humph!\" said my aunt. \"Unfortunate baby!\"\n\nMr. Dick, who had been rattling his money all this time, was rattling it\nso loudly now, that my aunt felt it necessary to check him with a look,\nbefore saying:\n\n\"The poor child's annuity died with her?\"\n\n\"Died with her,\" replied Mr. Murdstone.\n\n\"And there was no settlement of the little property--the house and\ngarden--the what's-its-name Rookery without any rooks in it--upon her\nboy?\"\n\n\"It had been left to her, unconditionally, by her first husband,\" Mr.\nMurdstone began, when my aunt caught him up with the greatest\nirascibility and impatience.\n\n\"Good Lord, man, there's no occasion to say that. Left to her\nunconditionally! I think I see David Copperfield looking forward to any\ncondition of any sort or kind, though it stared him point-blank in the\nface! Of course it was left to her unconditionally. But when she married\nagain--when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you, in\nshort,\" said my aunt, \"to be plain--did no one put in a word for the boy\nat that time?\"\n\n\"My late wife loved her second husband, madam,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \"and\ntrusted implicitly in him.\"\n\n\"Your late wife, sir, was a most unworldly, most unhappy, most\nunfortunate baby,\" returned my aunt, shaking her head at him. \"That's\nwhat _she_ was. And now, what have you got to say next?\"\n\n\"Merely this, Miss Trotwood,\" he returned. \"I am here to take David\nback--to take him back unconditionally, to dispose of him as I think\nproper, and to deal with him as I think right. I am not here to make\nany promise, or give any pledge to anybody. You may possibly have some\nidea, Miss Trotwood, of abetting him in his running away, and in his\ncomplaints to you. Your manner, which I must say does not seem intended\nto propitiate, induces me to think it possible. Now I must caution you\nthat if you abet him once, you abet him for good and all; if you step\nin between him and me, now, you must step in, Miss Trotwood, for ever.\nI cannot trifle, or be trifled with. I am here, for the first and last\ntime, to take him away. Is he ready to go? If he is not--and you tell\nme he is not; on any pretence; it is indifferent to me what--my doors\nare shut against him henceforth, and yours, I take it for granted, are\nopen to him.\"\n\nTo this address, my aunt had listened with the closest attention,\nsitting perfectly upright, with her hands folded on one knee, and\nlooking grimly on the speaker. When he had finished, she turned her eyes\nso as to command Miss Murdstone, without otherwise disturbing her\nattitude, and said:\n\n\"Well, ma'am, have _you_ got anything to remark?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Miss Trotwood,\" said Miss Murdstone, \"all that I could say has\nbeen so well said by my brother, and all that I know to be the fact has\nbeen so plainly stated by him, that I have nothing to add except my\nthanks for your politeness. For your very great politeness, I am sure,\"\nsaid Miss Murdstone; with an irony which no more affected my aunt, than\nit discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham.\n\n\"And what does the boy say?\" said my aunt. \"Are you ready to go, David?\"\n\nI answered no, and entreated her not to let me go. I said that neither\nMr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever liked me, or had ever been kind to me.\nThat they had made my mama, who always loved me dearly, unhappy about\nme, and that I knew it well, and that Peggotty knew it. I said that I\nhad been more miserable than I thought anybody could believe, who only\nknew how young I was. And I begged and prayed my aunt--I forget in what\nterms now, but I remember that they affected me very much then--to\nbefriend and protect me, for my father's sake.\n\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said my aunt, \"what shall I do with this child?\"\n\nMr. Dick considered, hesitated, brightened, and rejoined, \"Have him\nmeasured for a suit of clothes directly.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said my aunt, triumphantly, \"give me your hand, for your\ncommon sense is invaluable.\" Having shaken it with great cordiality, she\npulled me towards her, and said to Mr. Murdstone:\n\n\"You can go when you like; I'll take my chance with the boy. If he's all\nyou say he is, at least I can do as much for him then, as you have done.\nBut I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"Miss Trotwood,\" rejoined Mr. Murdstone, shrugging his shoulders, as he\nrose, \"if you were a gentleman----\"\n\n\"Bah! stuff and nonsense!\" said my aunt. \"Don't talk to me!\"\n\n\"How exquisitely polite!\" exclaimed Miss Murdstone, rising.\n\"Overpowering, really!\"\n\n\"Do you think I don't know,\" said my aunt, turning a deaf ear to the\nsister, and continuing to address the brother, and to shake her head at\nhim with infinite expression, \"what kind of life you must have led that\npoor, unhappy, misdirected baby? Do you think I don't know what a woeful\nday it was for the soft little creature, when _you_ first came in her\nway--smirking and making great eyes at her, I'll be bound, as if you\ncouldn't say boh! to a goose!\"\n\n\"I never heard anything so elegant!\" said Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"Do you think I can't understand you as well as if I had seen you,\"\npursued my aunt, \"now that I _do_ see and hear you--which, I tell you\ncandidly, is anything but a pleasure to me? Oh yes, bless us! who so\nsmooth and silky as Mr. Murdstone at first! The poor, benighted innocent\nhad never seen such a man. He was made of sweetness. He worshipped her.\nHe doted on her boy--tenderly doted on him! He was to be another father\nto him, and they were all to live together in a garden of roses, weren't\nthey? Ugh! Get along with you, do!\" said my aunt.\n\n\"I never heard anything like this person in my life!\" exclaimed Miss\nMurdstone.\n\n\"And when you had made sure of the poor little fool,\" said my aunt--\"God\nforgive me that I should call her so, and she gone where _you_ won't go\nin a hurry--because you had not done wrong enough to her and hers, you\nmust begin to train her, must you? begin to break her, like a poor caged\nbird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to sing _your_\nnotes?\"\n\n\"This is either insanity or intoxication,\" said Miss Murdstone, in a\nperfect agony at not being able to turn the current of my aunt's address\ntowards herself; \"and my suspicion is, that it's intoxication.\"\n\nMiss Betsey, without taking the least notice of the interruption,\ncontinued to address herself to Mr. Murdstone as if there had been no\nsuch thing.\n\n\"Mr. Murdstone,\" she said, shaking her finger at him, \"you were a tyrant\nto the simple baby, and you broke her heart. She was a loving baby--I\nknow that; I knew it, years before _you_ ever saw her--and through the\nbest part of her weakness, you gave her the wounds she died of. There is\nthe truth for your comfort, however you like it. And you and your\ninstruments may make the most of it.\"\n\n\"Allow me to inquire, Miss Trotwood,\" interposed Miss Murdstone, \"whom\nyou are pleased to call, in a choice of words in which I am not\nexperienced, my brother's instruments?\"\n\nStill stone-deaf to the voice, and utterly unmoved by it, Miss Betsey\npursued her discourse.\n\n\"It was clear enough, as I have told you, years before _you_ ever saw\nher--and why, in the mysterious dispensations of Providence, you ever\ndid see her, is more than humanity can comprehend--it was clear enough\nthat the poor soft little thing would marry somebody, at some time or\nother; but I did hope it wouldn't have been as bad as it has turned out.\nThat was the time, Mr. Murdstone, when she gave birth to her boy here,\"\nsaid my aunt; \"to the poor child you sometimes tormented her through\nafterwards, which is a disagreeable remembrance, and makes the sight of\nhim odious now. Aye, aye! you needn't wince!\" said my aunt, \"I know it's\ntrue without that.\"\n\nHe had stood by the door, all this while, observant of her with a smile\nupon his face, though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted. I\nremarked now, that, though the smile was on his face still, his colour\nhad gone in a moment, and he seemed to breathe as if he had been\nrunning.\n\n\"Good day, sir!\" said my aunt, \"and good bye! Good day to you too,\nma'am,\" said my aunt, turning suddenly upon his sister. \"Let me see you\nride a donkey over _my_ green again, and as sure as you have a head upon\nyour shoulders, I'll knock your bonnet off, and tread upon it!\"\n\nIt would require a painter, and no common painter too, to depict my\naunt's face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment,\nand Miss Murdstone's face as she heard it. But the manner of the speech,\nno less than the matter, was so fiery, that Miss Murdstone, without a\nword in answer, discreetly put her arm through her brother's, and walked\nhaughtily out of the cottage; my aunt remaining in the window looking\nafter them; prepared, I have no doubt, in case of the donkey's\nreappearance, to carry her threat into instant execution.\n\nNo attempt at defiance being made, however, her face gradually relaxed,\nand became so pleasant, that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her;\nwhich I did with great heartiness, and with both my arms clasped round\nher neck. I then shook hands with Mr. Dick, who shook hands with me a\ngreat many times, and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with\nrepeated bursts of laughter.\n\n\"You'll consider yourself guardian, jointly with me, of this child, Mr.\nDick,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"I shall be delighted,\" said Mr. Dick, \"to be the guardian of David's\nson.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" returned my aunt, \"_that's_ settled. I have been thinking,\ndo you know, Mr. Dick, that I might call him Trotwood?\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly. Call him Trotwood, certainly,\" said Mr. Dick.\n\"David's son's Trotwood.\"\n\n\"Trotwood Copperfield, you mean,\" returned my aunt.\n\n\"Yes, to be sure. Yes. Trotwood Copperfield,\" said Mr. Dick, a little\nabashed.\n\nMy aunt took so kindly to the notion, that some ready-made clothes,\nwhich were purchased for me that afternoon, were marked \"Trotwood\nCopperfield,\" in her own handwriting, and in indelible marking-ink,\nbefore I put them on; and it was settled that all the other clothes\nwhich were ordered to be made for me (a complete outfit was bespoke that\nafternoon) should be marked in the same way.\n\nThus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about\nme. Now that the state of doubt was over, I felt, for many days, like\none in a dream. I never thought that I had a curious couple of\nguardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I never thought of anything about\nmyself, distinctly. The two things clearest in my mind were, that a\nremoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life--which seemed to lie\nin the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a curtain had for ever\nfallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby's. No one has ever raised that\ncurtain since. I have lifted it for a moment, even in this narrative,\nwith a reluctant hand, and dropped it gladly. The remembrance of that\nlife is fraught with so much pain to me, with so much mental suffering\nand want of hope, that I have never had the courage even to examine how\nlong I was doomed to lead it. Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or\nless, I do not know. I only know that it was, and ceased to be; and that\nI have written, and there I leave it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nI MAKE ANOTHER BEGINNING.\n\n\nMr. Dick and I soon became the best of friends, and very often, when his\nday's work was done, went out together to fly the great kite. Every day\nof his life he had a long sitting at the Memorial, which never made the\nleast progress, however hard he labored, for King Charles the First\nalways strayed into it, sooner or later, and then it was thrown aside,\nand another one begun. The patience and hope with which he bore these\nperpetual disappointments, the mild perception he had that there was\nsomething wrong about King Charles the First, the feeble efforts he made\nto keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled\nthe Memorial out of all shape, made a deep impression on me. What Mr.\nDick supposed would come of the Memorial, if it were completed; where he\nthought it was to go, or what he thought it was to do; he knew no more\nthan anybody else, I believe. Nor was it at all necessary that he should\ntrouble himself with such questions, for if anything were certain under\nthe sun, it was certain that the Memorial never would be finished.\n\nIt was quite an affecting sight, I used to think, to see him with the\nkite when it was up a great height in the air. What he had told me, in\nhis room, about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on\nit, which were nothing but old leaves of abortive Memorials, might have\nbeen a fancy with him sometimes; but not when he was out, looking up at\nthe kite in the sky, and feeling it pull and tug at his hand. He never\nlooked so serene as he did then. I used to fancy, as I sat by him of an\nevening, on a green slope, and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet\nair, that it lifted his mind out of its confusion, and bore it (such was\nmy boyish thought) into the skies. As he wound the string in, and it\ncame lower and lower down out of the beautiful light, until it fluttered\nto the ground, and lay there like a dead thing, he seemed to wake\ngradually out of a dream; and I remember to have seen him take it up,\nand look about him in a lost way, as if they had both come down\ntogether, so that I pitied him with all my heart.\n\nWhile I advanced in friendship and intimacy with Mr. Dick, I did not go\nbackward in the favor of his staunch friend, my aunt. She took so kindly\nto me, that, in the course of a few weeks, she shortened my adopted name\nof Trotwood into Trot; and even encouraged me to hope that if I went on\nas I had begun, I might take equal rank in her affections with my sister\nBetsey Trotwood.\n\n\"Trot,\" said my aunt one evening, when the backgammon-board was placed\nas usual for herself and Mr. Dick, \"we must not forget your education.\"\n\nThis was my only subject of anxiety, and I felt quite delighted by her\nreferring to it.\n\n\"Should you like to go to school at Canterbury?\" said my aunt.\n\nI replied that I should like it very much, as it was so near her.\n\n\"Good,\" said my aunt. \"Should you like to go to-morrow?\"\n\nBeing already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunt's\nevolutions, I was not surprised by the suddenness of the proposal, and\nsaid: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said my aunt again. \"Janet, hire the grey pony and chaise\nto-morrow morning at ten o'clock, and pack up Master Trotwood's clothes\nto-night.\"\n\nI was greatly elated by these orders; but my heart smote me for my\nselfishness, when I witnessed their effect on Mr. Dick, who was so\nlow-spirited at the prospect of our separation, and played so ill in\nconsequence, that my aunt, after giving him several admonitory raps on\nthe knuckles with her dice-box, shut up the board, and declined to play\nwith him any more. But, on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes\ncome over on a Saturday, and that he could sometimes come and see me\non a Wednesday, he revived; and vowed to make another kite for those\noccasions, of proportions greatly surpassing the present one. In the\nmorning he was downhearted again, and would have sustained himself by\ngiving me all the money he had in his possession, gold and silver too,\nif my aunt had not interposed, and limited the gift to five shillings,\nwhich, at his earnest petition, were afterwards increased to ten. We\nparted at the garden-gate in a most affectionate manner, and Mr. Dick\ndid not go into the house until my aunt had driven me out of sight of\nit.\n\nMy aunt, who was perfectly indifferent to public opinion, drove the grey\npony through Dover in a masterly manner; sitting high and stiff like a\nstate coachman, keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went, and\nmaking a point of not letting him have his own way in any respect. When\nwe came into the country road, she permitted him to relax a little,\nhowever; and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side,\nasked me whether I was happy.\n\n\"Very happy indeed, thank you, aunt,\" I said.\n\nShe was much gratified; and both her hands being occupied, patted me on\nthe head with her whip.\n\n\"Is it a large school, aunt?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, I don't know,\" said my aunt. \"We are going to Mr. Wickfield's\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Does _he_ keep a school?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, Trot,\" said my aunt. \"He keeps an office.\"\n\nI asked for no more information about Mr. Wickfield, as she offered\nnone, and we conversed on other subjects until we came to Canterbury,\nwhere, as it was market-day, my aunt had a great opportunity of\ninsinuating the grey pony among carts, baskets, vegetables, and\nhuckster's goods. The hair-breadth turns and twists we made, drew down\nupon us a variety of speeches from the people standing about, which were\nnot always complimentary; but my aunt drove on with perfect\nindifference, and I dare say would have taken her own way with as much\ncoolness through an enemy's country.\n\nAt length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road;\na house with long low lattice-windows bulging out still farther, and\nbeams with carved heads on the ends bulging out too, so that I fancied\nthe whole house was leaning forward, trying to see who was passing on\nthe narrow pavement below. It was quite spotless in its cleanliness. The\nold-fashioned brass knocker on the low arched door, ornamented with\ncarved garlands of fruit and flowers, twinkled like a star; the two\nstone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been\ncovered with fair linen; and all the angles and corners, and carvings\nand mouldings, and quaint little panes of glass, and quainter little\nwindows, though as old as the hills, were as pure as any snow that ever\nfell upon the hills.\n\nWhen the pony-chaise stopped at the door, and my eyes were intent upon\nthe house, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the\nground floor (in a little round tower that formed one side of the\nhouse), and quickly disappear. The low arched door then opened, and the\nface came out. It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the\nwindow, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is\nsometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people. It belonged\nto a red-haired person--a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but\nlooking much older--whose hair was cropped as close as the closest\nstubble; who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a\nred-brown; so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he\nwent to sleep. He was high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black,\nwith a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a\nlong, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as\nhe stood at the pony's head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at\nus in the chaise.\n\n\"Is Mr. Wickfield at home, Uriah Heep?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Mr. Wickfield's at home, ma'am,\" said Uriah Heep, \"if you'll please to\nwalk in there\"--pointing with his long hand to the room he meant.\n\nWe got out; and leaving him to hold the pony, went into a long low\nparlor looking towards the street, from the window of which I caught a\nglimpse, as I went in, of Uriah Heep breathing into the pony's nostrils,\nand immediately covering them with his hand, as if he were putting some\nspell upon him. Opposite to the tall old chimney-piece, were two\nportraits: one of a gentleman with grey hair (though not by any means an\nold man) and black eyebrows, who was looking over some papers tied\ntogether with red tape; the other, of a lady, with a very placid and\nsweet expression of face, who was looking at me.\n\nI believe I was turning about in search of Uriah's picture, when, a door\nat the farther end of the room opening, a gentleman entered, at sight of\nwhom I turned to the first-mentioned portrait again, to make quite sure\nthat it had not come out of its frame. But it was stationary; and as the\ngentleman advanced into the light, I saw that he was some years older\nthan when he had had his picture painted.\n\n\"Miss Betsey Trotwood,\" said the gentleman, \"pray walk in. I was engaged\nfor the moment, but you'll excuse my being busy. You know my motive. I\nhave but one in life.\"\n\nMiss Betsey thanked him, and we went into his room, which was furnished\nas an office, with books, papers, tin boxes, and so forth. It looked\ninto a garden, and had an iron safe let into the wall; so immediately\nover the mantel-shelf, that I wondered, as I sat down, how the sweeps\ngot round it when they swept the chimney.\n\n\"Well, Miss Trotwood,\" said Mr. Wickfield; for I soon found that it was\nhe, and that he was a lawyer, and steward of the estates of a rich\ngentleman of the county; \"what wind blows you here? Not an ill wind, I\nhope?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied my aunt, \"I have not come for any law.\"\n\n\"That's right, ma'am,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"You had better come for\nanything else.\"\n\nHis hair was quite white now, though his eyebrows were still black. He\nhad a very agreeable face, and, I thought, was handsome. There was a\ncertain richness in his complexion, which I had been long accustomed,\nunder Peggotty's tuition, to connect with port wine; and I fancied it\nwas in his voice too, and referred his growing corpulency to the same\ncause. He was very cleanly dressed, in a blue coat, striped waistcoat,\nand nankeen trowsers; and his fine frilled shirt and cambric neckcloth\nlooked unusually soft and white, reminding my strolling fancy (I call to\nmind) of the plumage on the breast of a swan.\n\n\"This is my nephew,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Wasn't aware you had one, Miss Trotwood,\" said Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"My grand-nephew, that is to say,\" observed my aunt.\n\n\"Wasn't aware you had a grand-nephew, I give you my word,\" said Mr.\nWickfield.\n\n\"I have adopted him,\" said my aunt, with a wave of her hand, importing\nthat his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her, \"and I have\nbrought him here, to put him to a school where he may be thoroughly well\ntaught, and well treated. Now tell me where that school is, and what it\nis, and all about it.\"\n\n\"Before I can advise you properly,\" said Mr. Wickfield,--\"the old\nquestion, you know. What's your motive in this?\"\n\n\"Deuce take the man!\" exclaimed my aunt. \"Always fishing for motives,\nwhen they're on the surface! Why, to make the child happy and useful.\"\n\n\"It must be a mixed motive, I think,\" said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his\nhead and smiling incredulously.\n\n\"A mixed fiddlestick!\" returned my aunt. \"You claim to have one plain\nmotive in all you do yourself. You don't suppose, I hope, that you are\nthe only plain dealer in the world?\"\n\n\"Ay, but I have only one motive in life, Miss Trotwood,\" he rejoined,\nsmiling. \"Other people have dozens, scores, hundreds. I have only one.\nThere's the difference. However, that's beside the question. The best\nschool? Whatever the motive, you want the best?\"\n\nMy aunt nodded assent.\n\n\"At the best we have,\" said Mr. Wickfield, considering, \"your nephew\ncouldn't board just now.\"\n\n\"But he could board somewhere else, I suppose?\" suggested my aunt.\n\nMr. Wickfield thought I could. After a little discussion, he proposed to\ntake my aunt to the school, that she might see it and judge for herself;\nalso, to take her, with the same object, to two or three houses where he\nthought I could be boarded. My aunt embracing the proposal, we were all\nthree going out together, when he stopped and said:\n\n\"Our little friend here might have some motive, perhaps, for objecting\nto the arrangements. I think we had better leave him behind?\"\n\nMy aunt seemed disposed to contest the point; but to facilitate matters\nI said I would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into\nMr. Wickfield's office, where I sat down again, in the chair I had first\noccupied, to await their return.\n\nIt so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage, which\nended in the little circular room where I had seen Uriah Heep's\npale face looking out of window. Uriah, having taken the pony to a\nneighbouring stable, was at work at a desk in this room, which had a\nbrass frame on the top to hang papers upon, and on which the writing\nhe was making a copy of was then hanging. Though his face was towards\nme, I thought, for some time, the writing being between us, that he\ncould not see me; but looking that way more attentively, it made me\nuncomfortable to observe that, every now and then, his sleepless eyes\nwould come below the writing, like two red suns, and stealthily stare\nat me for I dare say a whole minute at a time, during which his pen\nwent, or pretended to go, as cleverly as ever. I made several attempts\nto get out of their way--such as standing on a chair to look at a map\non the other side of the room, and poring over the columns of a Kentish\nnewspaper--but they always attracted me back again; and whenever I\nlooked towards those two red suns, I was sure to find them, either just\nrising or just setting.\n\nAt length, much to my relief, my aunt and Mr. Wickfield came back, after\na pretty long absence. They were not so successful as I could have\nwished; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable, my aunt\nhad not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me.\n\n\"It's very unfortunate,\" said my aunt. \"I don't know what to do, Trot.\"\n\n\"It _does_ happen unfortunately,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"But I'll tell you\nwhat you can do, Miss Trotwood.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" inquired my aunt.\n\n\"Leave your nephew here, for the present. He's a quiet fellow. He won't\ndisturb me at all. It's a capital house for study. As quiet as a\nmonastery, and almost as roomy. Leave him here.\"\n\nMy aunt evidently liked the offer, though she was delicate of accepting\nit. So did I.\n\n\"Come, Miss Trotwood,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"This is the way out of the\ndifficulty. It's only a temporary arrangement, you know. If it don't act\nwell, or don't quite accord with our mutual convenience, he can easily\ngo to the right about. There will be time to find some better place for\nhim in the meanwhile. You had better determine to leave him here for the\npresent!\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said my aunt; \"and so is he, I see;\nbut--\"\n\n\"Come! I know what you mean,\" cried Mr. Wickfield. \"You shall not be\noppressed by the receipt of favors, Miss Trotwood. You may pay for him\nif you like. We won't be hard about terms, but you shall pay if you\nwill.\"\n\n\"On that understanding,\" said my aunt, \"though it doesn't lessen the\nreal obligation, I shall be very glad to leave him.\"\n\n\"Then come and see my little housekeeper,\" said Mr. Wickfield.\n\nWe accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase; with a balustrade so\nbroad that we might have gone up that, almost as easily; and into a\nshady old drawing-room, lighted by some three or four of the quaint\nwindows I had looked up at from the street: which had old oak seats in\nthem, that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak\nfloor, and the great beams in the ceiling. It was a prettily furnished\nroom, with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green, and some\nflowers. It seemed to be all old nooks and corners; and in every nook\nand corner there was some queer little table, or cupboard, or bookcase,\nor seat, or something or other, that made me think there was not such\nanother good corner in the room; until I looked at the next one, and\nfound it equal to it, if not better. On everything there was the same\nair of retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside.\n\nMr. Wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panneled wall, and a\ngirl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him. On her face, I\nsaw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose\npicture had looked at me down-stairs. It seemed to my imagination as if\nthe portrait had grown womanly, and the original remained a child.\nAlthough her face was quite bright and happy, there was a tranquillity\nabout it, and about her--a quiet, good, calm spirit--that I never have\nforgotten; that I never shall forget.\n\nThis was his little housekeeper, his daughter Agnes, Mr. Wickfield said.\nWhen I heard how he said it, and saw how he held her hand, I guessed\nwhat the one motive of his life was.\n\nShe had a little basket-trifle hanging at her side, with keys in it; and\nlooked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could\nhave. She listened to her father as he told her about me, with a\npleasant face; and when he had concluded, proposed to my aunt that we\nshould go up-stairs and see my room. We all went together; she before\nus: and a glorious old room it was, with more oak beams, and diamond\npanes; and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it.\n\nI cannot call to mind where or when, in my childhood, I had seen a\nstained glass window in a church. Nor do I recollect its subject. But I\nknow that when I saw her turn round, in the grave light of the old\nstaircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and that I\nassociated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield\never afterwards.\n\nMy aunt was as happy as I was, in the arrangement made for me; and we\nwent down to the drawing-room again, well pleased and gratified. As she\nwould not hear of staying to dinner, lest she should by any chance fail\nto arrive at home with the grey pony before dark; and as I apprehend Mr.\nWickfield knew her too well, to argue any point with her; some lunch was\nprovided for her there, and Agnes went back to her governess, and Mr.\nWickfield to his office. So we were left to take leave of one another\nwithout any restraint.\n\nShe told me that everything would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield,\nand that I should want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words and\nthe best advice.\n\n\"Trot,\" said my aunt in conclusion, \"be a credit to yourself, to me, and\nMr. Dick, and Heaven be with you!\"\n\nI was greatly overcome, and could only thank her, again and again, and\nsend my love to Mr. Dick.\n\n\"Never,\" said my aunt, \"be mean in anything; never be false; never be\ncruel. Avoid those three vices, Trot, and I can always be hopeful of\nyou.\"\n\nI promised, as well as I could, that I would not abuse her kindness or\nforget her admonition.\n\n\"The pony's at the door,\" said my aunt, \"and I am off! Stay here.\"\n\nWith these words she embraced me hastily, and went out of the room,\nshutting the door after her. At first I was startled by so abrupt a\ndeparture, and almost feared I had displeased her; but when I looked\ninto the street, and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise, and\ndrove away without looking up, I understood her better, and did not do\nher that injustice.\n\nBy five o'clock, which was Mr. Wickfield's dinner hour, I had mustered\nup my spirits again, and was ready for my knife and fork. The cloth was\nonly laid for us two; but Agnes was waiting in the drawing-room before\ndinner, went down with her father, and sat opposite to him at table. I\ndoubted whether he could have dined without her.\n\nWe did not stay there, after dinner, but came up-stairs into the\ndrawing-room again: in one snug corner of which, Agnes set glasses for\nher father, and a decanter of port wine. I thought he would have missed\nits usual flavor, if it had been put there for him by any other hands.\n\nThere he sat, taking his wine, and taking a good deal of it, for two\nhours; while Agnes played on the piano, worked, and talked to him and\nme. He was, for the most part, gay and cheerful with us; but sometimes\nhis eyes rested on her, and he fell into a brooding state, and was\nsilent. She always observed this quickly, as I thought, and always\nroused him with a question or caress. Then he came out of his\nmeditation, and drank more wine.\n\nAgnes made the tea, and presided over it; and the time passed away after\nit, as after dinner, until she went to bed; when her father took her in\nhis arms and kissed her, and, she being gone, ordered candles in his\noffice. Then I went to bed too.\n\nBut in the course of the evening I had rambled down to the door, and a\nlittle way along the street, that I might have another peep at the old\nhouses, and the grey Cathedral; and might think of my coming through\nthat old city on my journey, and of my passing the very house I lived\nin, without knowing it. As I came back, I saw Uriah Heep shutting up the\noffice; and feeling friendly towards everybody, went in and spoke to\nhim, and at parting, gave him my hand. But oh, what a clammy hand his\nwas! as ghostly to the touch as to the sight! I rubbed mine afterwards,\nto warm it, _and to rub his off_.\n\nIt was such an uncomfortable hand, that, when I went to my room, it was\nstill cold and wet upon my memory. Leaning out of window, and seeing one\nof the faces on the beam-ends looking at me sideways, I fancied it was\nUriah Heep got up there somehow, and shut him out in a hurry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nI AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE.\n\n\nNext morning, after breakfast, I entered on school life again. I went,\naccompanied by Mr. Wickfield, to the scene of my future studies--a grave\nbuilding in a court-yard, with a learned air about it that seemed very\nwell suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the\nCathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grass-plot--and\nwas introduced to my new master, Doctor Strong.\n\nDoctor Strong looked almost as rusty, to my thinking, as the tall iron\nrails and gates outside the house; and almost as stiff and heavy as the\ngreat stone urns that flanked them, and were set up, on the top of the\nred-brick wall, at regular distances all round the court, like\nsublimated skittles, for Time to play at. He was in his library (I mean\nDoctor Strong was), with his clothes not particularly well brushed, and\nhis hair not particularly well combed; his knee-smalls unbraced; his\nlong black gaiters unbuttoned; and his shoes yawning like two caverns on\nthe hearth-rug. Turning upon me a lustreless eye, that reminded me of a\nlong-forgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass, and\ntumble over the graves, in Blunderstone churchyard, he said he was glad\nto see me: and then he gave me his hand; which I didn't know what to do\nwith, as it did nothing for itself.\n\nBut, sitting at work, not far off from Doctor Strong, was a very\npretty young lady--whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter,\nI supposed--who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put\nDoctor Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did with\ngreat cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, and we\nwere going out to the school-room, I was much surprised to hear Mr.\nWickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as \"Mrs. Strong;\"\nand I was wondering could she be Doctor Strong's son's wife, or could\nshe be Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously\nenlightened me.\n\n\"By the bye, Wickfield,\" he said, stopping in a passage with his hand on\nmy shoulder; \"you have not found any suitable provision for my wife's\ncousin yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"No. Not yet.\"\n\n\"I could wish it done as soon as it _can_ be done, Wickfield,\" said\nDoctor Strong, \"for Jack Maldon is needy, and idle; and of those two bad\nthings, worse things sometimes come. What does Doctor Watts say,\" he\nadded, looking at me, and moving his head to the time of his quotation,\n\"'Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do.'\"\n\n\"Egad, doctor,\" returned Mr. Wickfield, \"if Doctor Watts knew mankind,\nhe might have written, with as much truth, 'Satan finds some mischief\nstill, for busy hands to do.' The busy people achieve their full share\nof mischief in the world, you may rely upon it. What have the people\nbeen about, who have been the busiest in getting money, and in getting\npower, this century or two? No mischief?\"\n\n\"Jack Maldon will never be very busy in getting either, I expect,\" said\nDoctor Strong, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Mr. Wickfield; \"and you bring me back to the\nquestion, with an apology for digressing. No, I have not been able to\ndispose of Mr. Jack Maldon yet. I believe,\" he said this with some\nhesitation, \"I penetrate your motive, and it makes the thing more\ndifficult.\"\n\n\"My motive,\" returned Dr. Strong, \"is to make some suitable provision\nfor a cousin, and an old playfellow, of Annie's.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mr. Wickfield; \"at home or abroad.\"\n\n\"Aye!\" replied the Doctor, apparently wondering why he emphasised those\nwords so much. \"At home or abroad.\"\n\n\"Your own expression, you know,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"Or abroad.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" the Doctor answered. \"Surely. One or other.\"\n\n\"One or other? Have you no choice?\" asked Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"No,\" returned the Doctor.\n\n\"No?\" with astonishment.\n\n\"Not the least.\"\n\n\"No motive,\" said Mr. Wickfield, \"for meaning abroad, and not at home?\"\n\n\"No,\" returned the Doctor.\n\n\"I am bound to believe you, and of course I do believe you,\" said Mr.\nWickfield. \"It might have simplified my office very much, if I had known\nit before. But I confess I entertained another impression.\"\n\nDoctor Strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look, which\nalmost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great\nencouragement; for it was full of amiability and sweetness, and there\nwas a simplicity in it, and indeed in his whole manner, when the\nstudious, pondering frost upon it was got through, very attractive and\nhopeful to a young scholar like me. Repeating \"no,\" and \"not the least,\"\nand other short assurances to the same purport, Doctor Strong jogged on\nbefore us, at a queer, uneven pace; and we followed: Mr. Wickfield\nlooking grave, I observed, and shaking his head to himself, without\nknowing that I saw him.\n\nThe school-room was a pretty large hall, on the quietest side of the\nhouse, confronted by the stately stare of some half-dozen of the great\nurns, and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden belonging to the\nDoctor, where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall. There\nwere two great aloes, in tubs, on the turf outside the windows; the\nbroad hard leaves of which plant (looking as if they were made of\npainted tin) have ever since, by association, been symbolical to me of\nsilence and retirement. About five-and-twenty boys were studiously\nengaged at their books when we went in, but they rose to give the Doctor\ngood morning, and remained standing when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me.\n\n\"A new boy, young gentlemen,\" said the Doctor; \"Trotwood Copperfield.\"\n\nOne Adams, who was the head-boy, then stepped out of his place and\nwelcomed me. He looked like a young clergyman, in his white cravat, but\nhe was very affable and good-humored; and he showed me my place, and\npresented me to the masters, in a gentlemanly way that would have put me\nat my ease, if anything could.\n\nIt seemed to me so long, however, since I had been among such boys, or\namong any companions of my own age, except Mick Walker and Mealey\nPotatoes, that I felt as strange as ever I have done in all my life. I\nwas so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could\nhave no knowledge, and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age,\nappearance, and condition, as one of them, that I half believed it was\nan imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy. I had\nbecome, in the Murdstone and Grinby time, however short or long it may\nhave been, so unused to the sports and games of boys, that I knew I was\nawkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them.\nWhatever I had learnt, had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares\nof my life from day to night, that now, when I was examined about what I\nknew, I knew nothing, and was put into the lowest form of the school.\nBut, troubled as I was, by my want of boyish skill, and of book-learning\ntoo, I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration,\nthat, in what I did know, I was much farther removed from my companions\nthan in what I did not. My mind ran upon what they would think, if they\nknew of my familiar acquaintance with the King's Bench Prison? Was there\nanything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with\nthe Micawber family--all those pawnings, and sellings, and suppers--in\nspite of myself? Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through\nCanterbury, wayworn and ragged, and should find me out? What would they\nsay, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my\nhalfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my\nslices of pudding? How would it affect them, who were so innocent of\nLondon life, and London streets, to discover how knowing I was (and was\nashamed to be) in some of the meanest phases of both? All this ran in my\nhead so much, on that first day at Doctor Strong's, that I felt\ndistrustful of my slightest look and gesture; shrunk within myself\nwhensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows; and hurried\noff the minute school was over, afraid of committing myself in my\nresponse to any friendly notice or advance.\n\nBut there was such an influence in Mr. Wickfield's old house, that when\nI knocked at it, with my new school-books under my arm, I began to feel\nmy uneasiness softening away. As I went up to my airy old room, the\ngrave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and fears,\nand to make the past more indistinct. I sat there, sturdily conning my\nbooks, until dinner time (we were out of school for good at three); and\nwent down, hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet.\n\nAgnes was in the drawing-room, waiting for her father, who was detained\nby some one in his office. She met me with her pleasant smile, and asked\nme how I liked the school. I told her I should like it very much, I\nhoped; but I was a little strange to it at first.\n\n\"_You_ have never been to school,\" I said, \"have you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Every day.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?\"\n\n\"Papa couldn't spare me to go anywhere else,\" she answered, smiling and\nshaking her head. \"His housekeeper must be in his house, you know.\"\n\n\"He is very fond of you, I am sure,\" I said.\n\nShe nodded \"Yes,\" and went to the door to listen for his coming up, that\nshe might meet him on the stairs. But, as he was not there, she came\nback again.\n\n\"Mama has been dead ever since I was born,\" she said, in her quiet way.\n\"I only know her picture, down stairs. I saw you looking at it\nyesterday. Did you think whose it was?\"\n\nI told her yes, because it was so like herself.\n\n\"Papa says so, too,\" said Agnes, pleased. \"Hark! That's papa now!\"\n\nHer bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to meet him,\nand as they came in, hand in hand. He greeted me cordially; and told me\nI should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong, who was one of the\ngentlest of men.\n\n\"There may be some, perhaps--I don't know that there are--who abuse his\nkindness,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"Never be one of those, Trotwood, in\nanything. He is the least suspicious of mankind; and whether that's a\nmerit, or whether it's a blemish, it deserves consideration in all\ndealings with the Doctor, great or small.\"\n\nHe spoke, I thought, as if he were weary, or dissatisfied with\nsomething; but I did not pursue the question in my mind, for dinner was\njust then announced, and we went down and took the same seats as before.\n\nWe had scarcely done so, when Uriah Heep put in his red head and his\nlank hand at the door, and said:\n\n\"Here's Mr. Maldon begs the favor of a word, sir.\"\n\n\"I am but this moment quit of Mr. Maldon,\" said his master.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned Uriah; \"but Mr. Maldon has come back, and he begs\nthe favor of a word.\"\n\nAs he held the door open with his hand, Uriah looked at me, and looked\nat Agnes, and looked at the dishes, and looked at the plates, and looked\nat every object in the room, I thought,--yet seemed to look at nothing;\nhe made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes\ndutifully on his master.\n\n\"I beg your pardon. It's only to say, on reflection,\" observed a voice\nbehind Uriah, as Uriah's head was pushed away, and the speaker's\nsubstituted--\"pray excuse me for this intrusion--that as it seems I have\nno choice in the matter, the sooner I go abroad, the better. My cousin\nAnnie did say, when we talked of it, that she liked to have her friends\nwithin reach rather than to have them banished, and the old Doctor--\"\n\n\"Doctor Strong, was that?\" Mr. Wickfield interposed, gravely.\n\n\"Doctor Strong of course,\" returned the other; \"I call him the old\nDoctor--it's all the same, you know.\"\n\n\"I _don't_ know,\" returned Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"Well, Doctor Strong,\" said the other--\"Doctor Strong was of the same\nmind, I believed. But as it appears from the course you take with me\nthat he has changed his mind, why there's no more to be said, except\nthat the sooner I am off, the better. Therefore, I thought I'd come back\nand say, that the sooner I am off, the better. When a plunge is to be\nmade into the water, it's of no use lingering on the bank.\"\n\n\"There shall be as little lingering as possible, in your case, Mr.\nMaldon, you may depend upon it,\" said Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"Thank'ee,\" said the other. \"Much obliged. I don't want to look\na gift-horse in the mouth, which is not a gracious thing to do;\notherwise, I dare say, my cousin Annie could easily arrange it in her\nown way. I suppose Annie would only have to say to the old Doctor--\"\n\n\"Meaning that Mrs. Strong would only have to say to her husband--do I\nfollow you?\" said Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"Quite so,\" returned the other, \"--would only have to say, that she\nwanted such and such a thing to be so and so; and it would be so and so,\nas a matter of course.\"\n\n\"And why as a matter of course, Mr. Maldon?\" asked Mr. Wickfield,\nsedately eating his dinner.\n\n\"Why, because Annie's a charming young girl, and the old Doctor--Doctor\nStrong, I mean--is not quite a charming young boy,\" said Mr. Jack\nMaldon, laughing. \"No offence to anybody, Mr. Wickfield. I only mean\nthat I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable, in that sort of\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Compensation to the lady, sir?\" asked Mr. Wickfield gravely.\n\n\"To the lady, sir,\" Mr. Jack Maldon answered, laughing. But appearing to\nremark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate,\nimmoveable manner, and that there was no hope of making him relax a\nmuscle of his face, he added:\n\n\"However, I have said what I came back to say, and, with another apology\nfor this intrusion, I may take myself off. Of course I shall observe\nyour directions, in considering the matter as one to be arranged between\nyou and me solely, and not to be referred to, up at the Doctor's.\"\n\n\"Have you dined?\" asked Mr. Wickfield, with a motion of his hand towards\nthe table.\n\n\"Thank'ee. I am going to dine,\" said Mr. Maldon, \"with my cousin Annie.\nGood bye!\"\n\nMr. Wickfield, without rising, looked after him thoughtfully as he went\nout. He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, I thought, with a\nhandsome face, a rapid utterance, and a confident, bold air. And this\nwas the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon; whom I had not expected to\nsee so soon, when I heard the Doctor speak of him that morning.\n\nWhen we had dined, we went up-stairs again, where everything went on\nexactly as on the previous day. Agnes set the glasses and decanters in\nthe same corner, and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink, and drank a good\ndeal. Agnes played the piano to him, sat by him, and worked and talked,\nand played some games at dominoes with me. In good time she made tea;\nand afterwards, when I brought down my books, looked into them, and\nshowed me what she knew of them (which was no slight matter, though\nshe said it was), and what was the best way to learn and understand\nthem. I see her, with her modest, orderly, placid manner, and I hear\nher beautiful calm voice, as I write these words. The influence for\nall good, which she came to exercise over me at a later time, begins\nalready to descend upon my breast. I love little Em'ly, and I don't\nlove Agnes--no, not at all in that way--but I feel that there are\ngoodness, peace, and truth, wherever Agnes is; and that the soft light\nof the colored window in the church, seen long ago, falls on her\nalways, and on me when I am near her, and on every thing around.\n\nThe time having come for her withdrawal for the night, and she having\nleft us, I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand, preparatory to going away myself.\nBut he checked me and said: \"Should you like to stay with us, Trotwood,\nor to go elsewhere?\"\n\n\"To stay\" I answered, quickly.\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"If you please. If I may!\"\n\n\"Why, it's but a dull life that we lead here, boy, I am afraid,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Not more dull for me than Agnes, sir. Not dull at all!\"\n\n\"Than Agnes,\" he repeated, walking slowly to the great chimney-piece,\nand leaning against it. \"Than Agnes!\"\n\nHe had drank wine that evening (or I fancied it), until his eyes were\nbloodshot. Not that I could see them now, for they were cast down, and\nshaded by his hand; but I had noticed them a little while before.\n\n\"Now I wonder,\" he muttered, \"whether my Agnes tires of me. When should\nI ever tire of her! But that's different--that's quite different.\"\n\nHe was musing--not speaking to me; so I remained quiet.\n\n\"A dull old house,\" he said, \"and a monotonous life; but I must have her\nnear me. I must keep her near me. If the thought that I may die and\nleave my darling, or that my darling may die and leave me, comes, like a\nspectre, to distress my happiest hours, and is only to be drowned\nin----\"\n\nHe did not supply the word; but pacing slowly to the place where he had\nsat, and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from the\nempty decanter, set it down and paced back again.\n\n\"If it is miserable to bear, when she is here,\" he said, \"what would it\nbe, and she away? No, no, no. I cannot try that.\"\n\nHe leaned against the chimney-piece, brooding so long that I could not\ndecide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going, or to remain\nquietly where I was, until he should come out of his reverie. At length\nhe aroused himself, and looked about the room until his eyes encountered\nmine.\n\n\"Stay with us, Trotwood, eh?\" he said, in his usual manner, and as if he\nwere answering something I had just said. \"I am glad of it. You are\ncompany to us both. It is wholesome to have you here. Wholesome for me,\nwholesome for Agnes, wholesome perhaps for all of us.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is for me, sir,\" I said. \"I am so glad to be here.\"\n\n\"That's a fine fellow!\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"As long as you are glad\nto be here, you shall stay here.\" He shook hands with me upon it, and\nclapped me on the back; and told me that when I had anything to do at\nnight after Agnes had left us, or when I wished to read for my own\npleasure, I was free to come down to his room, if he were there and if\nI desired it for company's sake, and to sit with him. I thanked him\nfor his consideration; and, as he went down soon afterwards, and I was\nnot tired, went down too, with a book in my hand, to avail myself, for\nhalf-an-hour, of his permission.\n\nBut, seeing a light in the little round office, and immediately feeling\nmyself attracted towards Uriah Heep, who had a sort of fascination for\nme, I went in there instead. I found Uriah reading a great fat book,\nwith such demonstrative attention, that his lank fore-finger followed up\nevery line as he read, and made clammy tracks along the page (or so I\nfully believed) like a snail.\n\n\"You are working late to-night, Uriah,\" says I.\n\n\"Yes, Master Copperfield,\" says Uriah.\n\nAs I was getting on the stool opposite, to talk to him more\nconveniently, I observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about\nhim, and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases\ndown his cheeks, one on each side, to stand for one.\n\n\"I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah.\n\n\"What work, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am improving my legal knowledge, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah. \"I\nam going through Tidd's Practice. Oh, what a writer Mr. Tidd is, Master\nCopperfield!\"\n\nMy stool was such a tower of observation, that as I watched him reading\non again, after this rapturous exclamation, and following up the lines\nwith his fore-finger, I observed that his nostrils, which were thin and\npointed, with sharp dints in them, had a singular and most uncomfortable\nway of expanding and contracting themselves--that they seemed to\ntwinkle, instead of his eyes, which hardly ever twinkled at all.\n\n\"I suppose you are quite a great lawyer?\" I said, after looking at him\nfor some time.\n\n\"Me, Master Copperfield?\" said Uriah. \"Oh, no! I'm a very umble person.\"\n\nIt was no fancy of mine about his hands, I observed; for he\nfrequently ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them\ndry and warm, besides often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his\npocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"I am well aware that I am the umblest person going,\" said Uriah Heep,\nmodestly; \"let the other be where he may. My mother is likewise a very\numble person. We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield, but have\nmuch to be thankful for. My father's former calling was umble. He was a\nsexton.\"\n\n\"What is he now?\" I asked.\n\n\"He is a partaker of glory at present, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah\nHeep. \"But we have much to be thankful for. How much have I to be\nthankful for, in living with Mr. Wickfield!\"\n\nI asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long?\n\n\"I have been with him, going on four year, Master Copperfield,\" said\nUriah; shutting up his book, after carefully marking the place where he\nhad left off. \"Since a year after my father's death. How much have I to\nbe thankful for, in that! How much have I to be thankful for, in Mr.\nWickfield's kind intention to give me my articles, which would otherwise\nnot lay within the umble means of mother and self!\"\n\n\"Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I\nsuppose?\" said I.\n\n\"With the blessing of Providence, Master Copperfield,\" returned Uriah.\n\n\"Perhaps you'll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield's business, one of these\ndays,\" I said, to make myself agreeable; \"and it will be Wickfield and\nHeep, or Heep late Wickfield.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Master Copperfield,\" returned Uriah, shaking his head, \"I am\nmuch too umble for that!\"\n\nHe certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the beam\noutside my window, as he sat, in his humility, eyeing me sideways, with\nhis mouth widened, and the creases in his cheeks.\n\n\"Mr. Wickfield is a most excellent man, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah.\n\"If you have known him long, you know it, I am sure, much better than I\ncan inform you.\"\n\nI replied that I was certain he was; but that I had not known him long\nmyself, though he was a friend of my aunt's.\n\n\"Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah. \"Your aunt is a sweet\nlady, Master Copperfield!\"\n\nHe had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm, which was\nvery ugly; and which diverted my attention from the compliment he had\npaid my relation, to the snaky twistings of his throat and body.\n\n\"A sweet lady, Master Copperfield!\" said Uriah Heep. \"She has a great\nadmiration for Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield, I believe?\"\n\nI said \"Yes,\" boldly; not that I knew anything about it, Heaven forgive\nme!\n\n\"I hope you have, too, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah. \"But I am sure\nyou must have.\"\n\n\"Everybody must have,\" I returned.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah Heep, \"for that remark!\nIt is so true! Umble as I am, I know it is _so_ true! Oh, thank you,\nMaster Copperfield!\"\n\nHe writhed himself quite off his stool in the excitement of his\nfeelings, and, being off, began to make arrangements for going home.\n\n\"Mother will be expecting me,\" he said, referring to a pale,\ninexpressive-faced watch in his pocket, \"and getting uneasy; for though\nwe are very umble, Master Copperfield, we are much attached to one\nanother. If you would come and see us, any afternoon, and take a cup of\ntea at our lowly dwelling, mother would be as proud of your company as I\nshould be.\"\n\nI said I should be glad to come.\n\n\"Thank you, Master Copperfield,\" returned Uriah, putting his book away\nupon a shelf.--\"I suppose you stop here, some time, Master Copperfield?\"\n\nI said I was going to be brought up there, I believed, as long as I\nremained at school.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed Uriah. \"I should think _you_ would come into the\nbusiness at last, Master Copperfield!\"\n\nI protested that I had no views of that sort, and that no such scheme\nwas entertained in my behalf by anybody; but Uriah insisted on blandly\nreplying to all my assurances, \"Oh, yes, Master Copperfield, I should\nthink you would, indeed!\" and, \"Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield, I should\nthink you would, certainly!\" over and over again. Being, at last, ready\nto leave the office for the night, he asked me if it would suit my\nconvenience to have the light put out; and on my answering \"Yes,\"\ninstantly extinguished it. After shaking hands with me--his hand felt\nlike a fish, in the dark--he opened the door into the street a very\nlittle, and crept out, and shut it, leaving me to grope my way back into\nthe house: which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool. This\nwas the proximate cause, I suppose, of my dreaming about him, for what\nappeared to me to be half the night; and dreaming, among other things,\nthat he had launched Mr. Peggotty's house on a piratical expedition,\nwith a black flag at the mast-head, bearing the inscription \"Tidd's\nPractice,\" under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little\nEm'ly to the Spanish Main, to be drowned.\n\nI got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school next\nday, and a good deal the better next day, and so shook it off by degrees\nthat in less than a fortnight I was quite at home, and happy, among my\nnew companions. I was awkward enough in their games, and backward enough\nin their studies; but custom would improve me in the first respect, I\nhoped, and hard work in the second. Accordingly, I went to work very\nhard, both in play and in earnest, and gained great commendation. And,\nin a very little while, the Murdstone and Grinby life became so strange\nto me that I hardly believed in it, while my present life grew so\nfamiliar, that I seemed to have been leading it a long time.\n\nDoctor Strong's was an excellent school; as different from Mr. Creakle's\nas good is from evil. It was very gravely and decorously ordered, and on\na sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to the honour and good\nfaith of the boys, and an avowed intention to rely on their possession\nof those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it, which\nworked wonders. We all felt that we had a part in the management of the\nplace, and in sustaining its character and dignity. Hence, we soon\nbecame warmly attached to it--I am sure I did for one, and I never knew,\nin all my time, of any other boy being otherwise--and learnt with a good\nwill, desiring to do it credit. We had noble games out of hours, and\nplenty of liberty; but even then, as I remember, we were well spoken of\nin the town, and rarely did any disgrace, by our appearance or manner,\nto the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong's boys.\n\nSome of the higher scholars boarded in the Doctor's house, and through\nthem I learnt, at second hand, some particulars of the Doctor's\nhistory--as how he had not yet been married twelve months to the\nbeautiful young lady I had seen in the study, whom he had married for\nlove; as she had not a sixpence, and had a world of poor relations (so\nour fellows said) ready to swarm the Doctor out of house and home.\nAlso, how the Doctor's cogitating manner was attributable to his being\nalways engaged in looking out for Greek roots; which, in my innocence\nand ignorance, I supposed to be a botanical furor on the Doctor's\npart, especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked\nabout--until I understood that they were roots of words, with a view to\na new Dictionary, which he had in contemplation. Adams, our head-boy,\nwho had a turn for mathematics, had made a calculation, I was informed,\nof the time this Dictionary would take in completing, on the Doctor's\nplan, and at the Doctor's rate of going. He considered that it might be\ndone in one thousand six hundred and forty-nine years, counting from\nthe Doctor's last, or sixty-second, birthday.\n\nBut the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and it must\nhave been a badly composed school if he had been anything else, for he\nwas the kindest of men; with a simple faith in him that might have\ntouched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall. As he walked up\nand down that part of the court-yard which was at the side of the house,\nwith the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads\ncocked slyly, as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly\naffairs than he, if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to\nhis creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of\ndistress, that vagabond was made for the next two days. It was so\nnotorious in the house, that the masters and head-boys took pains to cut\nthese marauders off at angles, and to get out of windows, and turn them\nout of the court-yard, before they could make the Doctor aware of their\npresence; which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of\nhim, without his knowing anything of the matter, as he jogged to and\nfro. Outside his own domain, and unprotected, he was a very sheep for\nthe shearers. He would have taken his gaiters off his legs, to give\naway. In fact, there was a story current among us (I have no idea, and\nnever had, on what authority, but I have believed it for so many years\nthat I feel quite certain it is true), that on a frosty day, one winter\ntime, he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar-woman, who\noccasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant\nfrom door to door, wrapped in those garments, which were universally\nrecognised, being as well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral. The\nlegend added that the only person who did not identify them was the\nDoctor himself, who, when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the\ndoor of a little second-hand shop of no very good repute, where such\nthings were taken in exchange for gin, was more than once observed to\nhandle them approvingly, as if admiring some curious novelty in the\npattern, and considering them an improvement on his own.\n\nIt was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young wife. He\nhad a fatherly, benignant way of showing his fondness for her, which\nseemed in itself to express a good man. I often saw them walking in the\ngarden where the peaches were, and I sometimes had a nearer observation\nof them in the study or the parlor. She appeared to me to take great\ncare of the Doctor, and to like him very much, though I never thought\nher vitally interested in the Dictionary: some cumbrous fragments of\nwhich work the Doctor always carried in his pockets, and in the lining\nof his hat, and generally seemed to be expounding to her as they walked\nabout.\n\nI saw a good deal of Mrs. Strong, both because she had taken a liking\nfor me on the morning of my introduction to the Doctor, and was always\nafterwards kind to me, and interested in me; and because she was very\nfond of Agnes, and was often backwards and forwards at our house. There\nwas a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield, I thought (of\nwhom she seemed to be afraid), that never wore off. When she came there\nof an evening, she always shrunk from accepting his escort home, and ran\naway with me instead. And sometimes, as we were running gaily across the\nCathedral yard together, expecting to meet nobody, we would meet Mr.\nJack Maldon, who was always surprised to see us.\n\nMrs. Strong's mama was a lady I took great delight in. Her name was Mrs.\nMarkleham; but our boys used to call her the Old Soldier, on account of\nher generalship, and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of\nrelations against the Doctor. She was a little, sharp-eyed woman, who\nused to wear, when she was dressed, one unchangeable cap, ornamented\nwith some artificial flowers, and two artificial butterflies supposed to\nbe hovering above the flowers. There was a superstition among us that\nthis cap had come from France, and could only originate in the\nworkmanship of that ingenious nation: but all I certainly know about it,\nis, that it always made its appearance of an evening, wheresoever Mrs.\nMarkleham made _her_ appearance; that it was carried about to friendly\nmeetings in a Hindoo basket; that the butterflies had the gift of\ntrembling constantly; and that they improved the shining hours at Doctor\nStrong's expense, like busy bees.\n\nI observed the Old Soldier--not to adopt the name disrespectfully--to\npretty good advantage, on a night which is made memorable to me by\nsomething else I shall relate. It was the night of a little party at the\nDoctor's, which was given on the occasion of Mr. Jack Maldon's departure\nfor India, whither he was going as a cadet, or something of that kind:\nMr. Wickfield having at length arranged the business. It happened to be\nthe Doctor's birthday, too. We had had a holiday, had made presents to\nhim in the morning, had made a speech to him through the head-boy, and\nhad cheered him until we were hoarse, and until he had shed tears. And\nnow, in the evening, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, and I, went to have tea with\nhim in his private capacity.\n\nMr. Jack Maldon was there, before us. Mrs. Strong, dressed in white,\nwith cherry-colored ribbons, was playing the piano, when we went in; and\nhe was leaning over her to turn the leaves. The clear red and white of\nher complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual, I thought,\nwhen she turned round; but she looked very pretty, wonderfully pretty.\n\n\"I have forgotten, Doctor,\" said Mrs. Strong's mama, when we were\nseated, \"to pay you the compliments of the day--though they are, as you\nmay suppose, very far from being mere compliments in my case. Allow me\nto wish you many happy returns.\"\n\n\"I thank you, ma'am,\" replied the Doctor.\n\n\"Many, many, many, happy returns,\" said the Old Soldier. \"Not only for\nyour own sake, but for Annie's, and John Maldon's, and many other\npeoples'. It seems but yesterday to me, John, when you were a little\ncreature, a head shorter than Master Copperfield, making baby love to\nAnnie behind the gooseberry bushes in the back-garden.\"\n\n\"My dear mama,\" said Mrs. Strong, \"never mind that now.\"\n\n\"Annie, don't be absurd,\" returned her mother. \"If you are to blush to\nhear of such things, now you are an old married woman, when are you not\nto blush to hear of them?\"\n\n\"Old?\" exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon. \"Annie? Come!\"\n\n\"Yes, John,\" returned the Soldier. \"Virtually, an old married woman.\nAlthough not old by years--for when did you ever hear me say, or who has\never heard me say, that a girl of twenty was old by years!--your cousin\nis the wife of the Doctor, and, as such, what I have described her. It\nis well for you, John, that your cousin is the wife of the Doctor. You\nhave found in him an influential and kind friend, who will be kinder\nyet, I venture to predict, if you deserve it. I have no false pride. I\nnever hesitate to admit, frankly, that there are some members of our\nfamily who want a friend. You were one yourself, before your cousin's\ninfluence raised up one for you.\"\n\nThe Doctor, in the goodness of his heart, waved his hand as if to make\nlight of it, and save Mr. Jack Maldon from any further reminder. But\nMrs. Markleham changed her chair for one next the Doctor's, and putting\nher fan on his coat-sleeve, said:\n\n\"No, really, my dear Doctor, you must excuse me if I appear to dwell on\nthis rather, because I feel so very strongly. I call it quite my\nmonomania, it is such a subject of mine. You are a blessing to us. You\nreally are a Boon, you know.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense,\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"No, no, I beg your pardon,\" retorted the Old Soldier. \"With nobody\npresent, but our dear and confidential friend Mr. Wickfield, I cannot\nconsent to be put down. I shall begin to assert the privileges of a\nmother-in-law, if you go on like that, and scold you. I am perfectly\nhonest and outspoken. What I am saying, is what I said when you first\noverpowered me with surprise--you remember how surprised I was?--by\nproposing for Annie. Not that there was anything so very much out of the\nway, in the mere act of the proposal--it would be ridiculous to say\nthat!--but because, you having known her poor father, and having known\nher from a baby six months old, I hadn't thought of you in such a light\nat all, or indeed as a marrying man in any way,--simply that, you know.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" returned the Doctor, good-humoredly. \"Never mind.\"\n\n\"But I _do_ mind,\" said the Old Soldier, laying her fan upon his lips.\n\"I mind very much. I recal these things that I may be contradicted if I\nam wrong. Well! Then I spoke to Annie, and I told her what had happened.\nI said, 'My dear, here's Doctor Strong has positively been and made you\nthe subject of a handsome declaration and an offer.' Did I press it in\nthe least? No. I said, 'Now, Annie, tell me the truth this moment; is\nyour heart free?' 'Mama,' she said, crying, 'I am extremely\nyoung'--which was perfectly true--'and I hardly know if I have a heart\nat all.' 'Then, my dear,' I said, 'you may rely upon it, it's free. At\nall events, my love,' said I, 'Doctor Strong is in an agitated state of\nmind, and must be answered. He cannot be kept in his present state of\nsuspense.' 'Mama,' said Annie, still crying, 'would he be unhappy\nwithout me? If he would, I honor and respect him so much, that I think I\nwill have him.' So it was settled. And then, and not till then, I said\nto Annie, 'Annie, Doctor Strong will not only be your husband, but he\nwill represent your late father: he will represent the head of our\nfamily, he will represent the wisdom and station, and I may say the\nmeans, of our family; and will be, in short, a Boon to it.' I used the\nword at the time, and I have used it again, to-day. If I have any merit,\nit is consistency.\"\n\nThe daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech, with her\neyes fixed on the ground; her cousin standing near her, and looking on\nthe ground too. She now said very softly, in a trembling voice:\n\n\"Mama, I hope you have finished?\"\n\n\"No, my dear Annie,\" returned the Soldier, \"I have not quite finished.\nSince you ask me, my love, I reply that I have _not_. I complain that\nyou really are a little unnatural towards your own family; and, as it is\nof no use complaining to you, I mean to complain to your husband. Now,\nmy dear Doctor, do look at that silly wife of yours.\"\n\nAs the Doctor turned his kind face, with its smile of simplicity and\ngentleness, towards her, she drooped her head more. I noticed that Mr.\nWickfield looked at her steadily.\n\n\"When I happened to say to that naughty thing, the other day,\" pursued\nher mother, shaking her head and her fan at her, playfully, \"that there\nwas a family circumstance she might mention to you--indeed, I think, was\nbound to mention--she said, that to mention it was to ask a favor; and\nthat, as you were too generous, and as for her to ask was always to\nhave, she wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Annie, my dear,\" said the Doctor. \"That was wrong. It robbed me of a\npleasure.\"\n\n\"Almost the very words I said to her!\" exclaimed her mother. \"Now\nreally, another time, when I know what she would tell you but for this\nreason, and won't, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, to tell you\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad if you will,\" returned the Doctor.\n\n\"Shall I?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will!\" said the Old Soldier. \"That's a bargain.\" And\nhaving, I suppose, carried her point, she tapped the Doctor's hand\nseveral times with her fan (which she kissed first), and returned\ntriumphantly to her former station.\n\nSome more company coming in, among whom were the two masters and Adams,\nthe talk became general; and it naturally turned on Mr. Jack Maldon, and\nhis voyage, and the country he was going to, and his various plans and\nprospects. He was to leave that night, after supper, in a postchaise,\nfor Gravesend; where the ship, in which he was to make the voyage, lay;\nand was to be gone--unless he came home on leave, or for his health--I\ndon't know how many years. I recollect it was settled by general consent\nthat India was quite a misrepresented country, and had nothing\nobjectionable in it, but a tiger or two, and a little heat in the warm\npart of the day. For my own part, I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon as a\nmodern Sinbad, and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in\nthe east, sitting under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes--a mile\nlong, if they could be straightened out.\n\nMrs. Strong was a very pretty singer: as I knew, who often heard her\nsinging by herself. But, whether she was afraid of singing before\npeople, or was out of voice that evening, it was certain that she\ncouldn't sing at all. She tried a duet, once, with her cousin Maldon,\nbut could not so much as begin; and afterwards, when she tried to sing\nby herself, although she began sweetly, her voice died away on a sudden,\nand left her quite distressed, with her head hanging down over the keys.\nThe good Doctor said she was nervous, and, to relieve her, proposed a\nround game at cards; of which he knew as much as of the art of playing\nthe trombone. But I remarked that the Old Soldier took him into custody\ndirectly, for her partner; and instructed him, as the first preliminary\nof initiation, to give her all the silver he had in his pocket.\n\nWe had a merry game, not made the less merry by the Doctor's mistakes,\nof which he committed an innumerable quantity, in spite of the\nwatchfulness of the butterflies, and to their great aggravation. Mrs.\nStrong had declined to play, on the ground of not feeling very well; and\nher cousin Maldon had excused himself because he had some packing to do.\nWhen he had done it, however, he returned, and they sat together,\ntalking, on the sofa. From time to time she came and looked over the\nDoctor's hand, and told him what to play. She was very pale, as she bent\nover him, and I thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the\ncards; but the Doctor was quite happy in her attention, and took no\nnotice of this, if it were so.\n\nAt supper, we were hardly so gay. Every one appeared to feel that a\nparting of that sort was an awkward thing, and that the nearer it\napproached, the more awkward it was. Mr. Jack Maldon tried to be very\ntalkative, but was not at his ease, and made matters worse. And they\nwere not improved, as it appeared to me, by the Old Soldier: who\ncontinually recalled passages of Mr. Jack Maldon's youth.\n\nThe Doctor, however, who felt, I am sure, that he was making everybody\nhappy, was well pleased, and had no suspicion, but that we were all at\nthe utmost height of enjoyment.\n\n\"Annie, my dear,\" said he, looking at his watch, and filling his glass,\n\"it is past your cousin Jack's time, and we must not detain him, since\ntime and tide--both concerned in this case--wait for no man. Mr. Jack\nMaldon, you have a long voyage, and a strange country, before you; but\nmany men have had both, and many men will have both, to the end of time.\nThe winds you are going to tempt, have wafted thousands upon thousands\nto fortune, and brought thousands upon thousands happily back.\"\n\n\"It's an affecting thing,\" said Mrs. Markleham--\"however it's viewed,\nit's affecting--to see a fine young man one has known from an infant,\ngoing away to the other end of the world, leaving all he knows behind,\nand not knowing what's before him. A young man really well deserves\nconstant support and patronage,\" looking at the Doctor, \"who makes such\nsacrifices.\"\n\n\"Time will go fast with you, Mr. Jack Maldon,\" pursued the Doctor, \"and\nfast with all of us. Some of us can hardly expect, perhaps, in the\nnatural course of things, to greet you on your return. The next best\nthing is to hope to do it, and that's my case. I shall not weary you\nwith good advice. You have long had a good model before you, in your\ncousin Annie. Imitate her virtues as nearly as you can.\"\n\nMrs. Markleham fanned herself, and shook her head.\n\n\"Farewell, Mr. Jack,\" said the Doctor, standing up; on which we all\nstood up. \"A prosperous voyage out, a thriving career abroad, and a\nhappy return home!\"\n\nWe all drank the toast, and all shook hands with Mr. Jack Maldon; after\nwhich he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there, and hurried to\nthe door, where he was received, as he got into the chaise, with a\ntremendous broadside of cheers discharged by our boys, who had assembled\non the lawn for the purpose. Running in among them to swell the ranks, I\nwas very near the chaise when it rolled away; and I had a lively\nimpression made upon me, in the midst of the noise and dust, of having\nseen Mr. Jack Maldon rattle past with an agitated face, and something\ncherry-colored in his hand.\n\nAfter another broadside for the Doctor, and another for the Doctor's\nwife, the boys dispersed, and I went back into the house, where I found\nthe guests all standing in a group about the Doctor, discussing how Mr.\nJack Maldon had gone away, and how he had borne it, and how he had felt\nit, and all the rest of it. In the midst of these remarks, Mrs.\nMarkleham cried: \"Where's Annie!\"\n\nNo Annie was there; and when they called to her, no Annie replied. But\nall pressing out of the room, in a crowd, to see what was the matter, we\nfound her lying on the hall floor. There was great alarm at first, until\nit was found that she was in a swoon, and that the swoon was yielding to\nthe usual means of recovery; when the Doctor, who had lifted her head\nupon his knee, put her curls aside with his hand, and said, looking\naround:\n\n\"Poor Annie! She's so faithful and tender-hearted! It's the parting from\nher old playfellow and friend--her favorite cousin--that has done this.\nAh! It's a pity! I am very sorry!\"\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, and saw where she was, and that we were all\nstanding about her, she arose with assistance: turning her head, as she\ndid so, to lay it on the Doctor's shoulder--or to hide it, I don't know\nwhich. We went into the drawing-room, to leave her with the Doctor and\nher mother; but she said, it seemed, that she was better than she had\nbeen since morning, and that she would rather be brought among us; so\nthey brought her in, looking very white and weak, I thought, and sat her\non a sofa.\n\n\"Annie, my dear,\" said her mother, doing something to her dress. \"See\nhere! You have lost a bow. Will anybody be so good as find a ribbon; a\ncherry-colored ribbon?\"\n\nIt was the one she had worn at her bosom. We all looked for it--I myself\nlooked everywhere, I am certain--but nobody could find it.\n\n\"Do you recollect where you had it last, Annie?\" said her mother.\n\nI wondered how I could have thought she looked white, or anything but\nburning red, when she answered that she had had it safe, a little while\nago, she thought, but it was not worth looking for.\n\nNevertheless, it was looked for again, and still not found. She\nentreated that there might be no more searching; but it was still sought\nfor, in a desultory way, until she was quite well, and the company took\ntheir departure.\n\nWe walked very slowly home, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, and I--Agnes and I\nadmiring the moonlight, and Mr. Wickfield scarcely raising his eyes from\nthe ground. When we, at last, reached our own door, Agnes discovered\nthat she had left her little reticule behind. Delighted to be of any\nservice to her, I ran back to fetch it.\n\nI went into the supper-room where it had been left, which was deserted\nand dark. But a door of communication between that and the Doctor's\nstudy, where there was a light, being open, I passed on there, to say\nwhat I wanted, and to get a candle.\n\nThe Doctor was sitting in his easy chair by the fireside, and his young\nwife was on a stool at his feet. The Doctor, with a complacent smile,\nwas reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement of a theory\nout of that interminable Dictionary, and she was looking up at him. But,\nwith such a face as I never saw. It was so beautiful in its form, it was\nso ashy pale, it was so fixed in its abstraction, it was so full of a\nwild, sleep-walking, dreamy horror of I don't know what. The eyes were\nwide open, and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her\nshoulders, and on her white dress, disordered by the want of the lost\nribbon. Distinctly as I recollect her look, I cannot say of what it was\nexpressive. I cannot even say of what it is expressive to me now, rising\nagain before my older judgment. Penitence, humiliation, shame, pride,\nlove, and trustfulness--I see them all; and in them all, I see that\nhorror of I don't know what.\n\n  [Illustration: I return to the Doctor's after the party.]\n\nMy entrance, and my saying what I wanted, roused her. It disturbed the\nDoctor too, for when I went back to replace the candle I had taken from\nthe table, he was patting her head, in his fatherly way, and saying he\nwas a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on; and he would\nhave her go to bed.\n\nBut she asked him, in a rapid, urgent manner, to let her stay--to let\nher feel assured (I heard her murmur some broken words to this effect)\nthat she was in his confidence that night. And, as she turned again\ntowards him, after glancing at me as I left the room and went out at the\ndoor, I saw her cross her hands upon his knee, and look up at him with\nthe same face, something quieted, as he resumed his reading.\n\nIt made a great impression on me, and I remembered it a long time\nafterwards; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nSOMEBODY TURNS UP.\n\n\nIt has not occurred to me to mention Peggotty since I ran away; but, of\ncourse, I wrote her a letter almost as soon as I was housed at Dover,\nand another, and a longer letter, containing all particulars fully\nrelated, when my aunt took me formally under her protection. On my being\nsettled at Doctor Strong's I wrote to her again, detailing my happy\ncondition and prospects. I never could have derived anything like the\npleasure from spending the money Mr. Dick had given me, that I felt in\nsending a gold half-guinea to Peggotty, per post, inclosed in this last\nletter, to discharge the sum I had borrowed of her: in which epistle,\nnot before, I mentioned about the young man with the donkey-cart.\n\nTo these communications Peggotty replied as promptly, if not as\nconcisely, as a merchant's clerk. Her utmost powers of expression (which\nwere certainly not great in ink) were exhausted in the attempt to write\nwhat she felt on the subject of my journey. Four sides of incoherent and\ninterjectional beginnings of sentences, that had no end, except blots,\nwere inadequate to afford her any relief. But the blots were more\nexpressive to me than the best composition; for they showed me that\nPeggotty had been crying all over the paper, and what could I have\ndesired more?\n\nI made out, without much difficulty, that she could not take quite\nkindly to my aunt yet. The notice was too short after so long a\nprepossession the other way. We never knew a person, she wrote; but to\nthink that Miss Betsey should seem to be so different from what she had\nbeen thought to be, was a Moral!--that was her word. She was evidently\nstill afraid of Miss Betsey, for she sent her grateful duty to her but\ntimidly; and she was evidently afraid of me, too, and entertained the\nprobability of my running away again soon: if I might judge from the\nrepeated hints she threw out, that the coach-fare to Yarmouth was always\nto be had of her for the asking.\n\nShe gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much,\nnamely, that there had been a sale of the furniture at our old home, and\nthat Mr. and Miss Murdstone were gone away, and the house was shut up,\nto be let or sold. God knows I had had no part in it while they remained\nthere, but it pained me to think of the dear old place as altogether\nabandoned; of the weeds growing tall in the garden, and the fallen\nleaves lying thick and wet upon the paths. I imagined how the winds of\nwinter would howl round it, how the cold rain would beat upon the\nwindow-glass, how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the empty\nrooms, watching their solitude all night. I thought afresh of the grave\nin the churchyard, underneath the tree: and it seemed as if the house\nwere dead too, now, and all connected with my father and mother were\nfaded away.\n\nThere was no other news in Peggotty's letters. Mr. Barkis was an\nexcellent husband, she said, though still a little near; but we all had\nour faults, and she had plenty (though I am sure I don't know what they\nwere); and he sent his duty, and my little bedroom was always ready for\nme. Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, and Mrs. Gummidge was but\npoorly, and little Em'ly wouldn't send her love, but said that Peggotty\nmight send it, if she liked.\n\nAll this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt, only reserving to\nmyself the mention of little Em'ly, to whom I instinctively felt that\nshe would not very tenderly incline. While I was yet new at Doctor\nStrong's, she made several excursions over to Canterbury to see me, and\nalways at unseasonable hours: with the view, I suppose, of taking me by\nsurprise. But, finding me well employed, and bearing a good character,\nand hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school, she soon\ndiscontinued these visits. I saw her on a Saturday, every third or\nfourth week, when I went over to Dover for a treat; and I saw Mr. Dick\nevery alternate Wednesday, when he arrived by stage-coach at noon, to\nstay until next morning.\n\nOn these occasions Mr. Dick never travelled without a leathern\nwriting-desk, containing a supply of stationery and the Memorial; in\nrelation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to\npress now, and that it really must be got out of hand.\n\nMr. Dick was very partial to gingerbread. To render his visits the\nmore agreeable, my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at\na cake-shop, which was hampered with the stipulation that he should\nnot be served with more than one shilling's-worth in the course of any\none day. This, and the reference of all his little bills at the county\ninn where he slept, to my aunt, before they were paid, induced me to\nsuspect that he was only allowed to rattle his money, and not to spend\nit. I found on further investigation that this was so, or at least\nthere was an agreement between him and my aunt that he should account\nto her for all his disbursements. As he had no idea of deceiving her,\nand always desired to please her, he was thus made chary of launching\ninto expense. On this point, as well as on all other possible points,\nMr. Dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful\nof women; as he repeatedly told me with infinite secresy, and always in\na whisper.\n\n\"Trotwood,\" said Mr. Dick, with an air of mystery, after imparting this\nconfidence to me, one Wednesday; \"who's the man that hides near our\nhouse and frightens her.\"\n\n\"Frightens my aunt, sir?\"\n\nMr. Dick nodded. \"I thought nothing would have frightened her,\" he said,\n\"for she's--\" here he whispered softly, \"don't mention it--the wisest\nand most wonderful of women.\" Having said which, he drew back, to\nobserve the effect which this description of her made upon me.\n\n\"The first time he came,\" said Mr. Dick, \"was--let me see--sixteen\nhundred and forty-nine was the date of King Charles's execution. I think\nyou said sixteen hundred and forty-nine?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't know how it can be,\" said Mr. Dick, sorely puzzled and shaking\nhis head. \"I don't think I am as old as that.\"\n\n\"Was it in that year that the man appeared, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, really,\" said Mr. Dick, \"I don't see how it can have been in that\nyear, Trotwood. Did you get that date out of history?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I suppose history never lies, does it?\" said Mr. Dick, with a gleam of\nhope.\n\n\"Oh dear, no, sir!\" I replied, most decisively. I was ingenuous and\nyoung, and I thought so.\n\n\"I can't make it out,\" said Mr. Dick, shaking his head. \"There's\nsomething wrong, somewhere. However, it was very soon after the mistake\nwas made of putting some of the trouble out of King Charles's head into\nmy head, that the man first came. I was walking out with Miss Trotwood\nafter tea, just at dark, and there he was, close to our house.\"\n\n\"Walking about?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Walking about?\" repeated Mr. Dick. \"Let me see. I must recollect a bit.\nN--no, no; he was not walking about.\"\n\nI asked, as the shortest way to get at it, what he _was_ doing.\n\n\"Well, he wasn't there at all,\" said Mr. Dick, \"until he came up behind\nher, and whispered. Then she turned round and fainted, and I stood still\nand looked at him, and he walked away; but that he should have been\nhiding ever since (in the ground or somewhere), is the most\nextraordinary thing!\"\n\n\"_Has_ he been hiding ever since?\" I asked.\n\n\"To be sure he has,\" retorted Mr. Dick, nodding his head gravely. \"Never\ncame out, till last night! We were walking last night, and he came up\nbehind her again, and I knew him again.\"\n\n\"And did he frighten my aunt again?\"\n\n\"All of a shiver,\" said Mr. Dick, counterfeiting that affection and\nmaking his teeth chatter. \"Held by the palings. Cried. But Trotwood,\ncome here,\" getting me close to him, that he might whisper very softly;\n\"why did she give him money, boy, in the moonlight?\"\n\n\"He was a beggar, perhaps.\"\n\nMr. Dick shook his head, as utterly renouncing the suggestion; and\nhaving replied a great many times, and with great confidence, \"No\nbeggar, no beggar, no beggar, sir!\" went on to say, that from his\nwindow he had afterwards, and late at night, seen my aunt give this\nperson money outside the garden rails in the moonlight, who then slunk\naway--into the ground again, as he thought probable--and was seen no\nmore: while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house,\nand had, even that morning, been quite different from her usual self;\nwhich preyed on Mr. Dick's mind.\n\nI had not the least belief, in the outset of this story, that the\nunknown was anything but a delusion of Mr. Dick's, and one of the line\nof that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty; but\nafter some reflection I began to entertain the question whether an\nattempt, or threat of an attempt, might have been twice made to take\npoor Mr. Dick himself from under my aunt's protection, and whether my\naunt, the strength of whose kind feeling towards him I knew from\nherself, might have been induced to pay a price for his peace and quiet.\nAs I was already much attached to Mr. Dick, and very solicitous for his\nwelfare, my fears favored this supposition; and for a long time his\nWednesday hardly ever came round, without my entertaining a misgiving\nthat he would not be on the coach-box as usual. There he always\nappeared, however, grey-headed, laughing, and happy; and he never had\nanything more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt.\n\nThese Wednesdays were the happiest days of Mr. Dick's life; they\nwere far from being the least happy of mine. He soon became known to\nevery boy in the school; and though he never took an active part\nin any game but kite-flying, was as deeply interested in all our\nsports as any one among us. How often have I seen him, intent upon\na match at marbles or pegtop, looking on with a face of unutterable\ninterest, and hardly breathing at the critical times! How often, at\nhare and hounds, have I seen him mounted on a little knoll, cheering\nthe whole field on to action, and waving his hat above his grey head,\noblivious of King Charles the Martyr's head, and all belonging to it!\nHow many a summer-hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him\nin the cricket-field! How many winter days have I seen him, standing\nblue-nosed in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down\nthe long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture!\n\nHe was an universal favorite, and his ingenuity in little things was\ntranscendant. He could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had\nan idea of. He could make a boat out of anything, from a skewer upwards.\nHe could turn crampbones into chessmen; fashion Roman chariots from old\ncourt cards; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels, and birdcages of\nold wire. But he was greatest of all, perhaps, in the articles of string\nand straw; with which we were all persuaded he could do anything that\ncould be done by hands.\n\nMr. Dick's renown was not long confined to us. After a few Wednesdays,\nDoctor Strong himself made some inquiries of me about him, and I told\nhim all my aunt had told me; which interested the Doctor so much that he\nrequested, on the occasion of his next visit, to be presented to him.\nThis ceremony I performed; and the Doctor begging Mr. Dick, whensoever\nhe should not find me at the coach-office, to come on there, and rest\nhimself until our morning's work was over, it soon passed into a custom\nfor Mr. Dick to come on as a matter of course, and, if we were a little\nlate, as often happened on a Wednesday, to walk about the courtyard,\nwaiting for me. Here he made the acquaintance of the Doctor's beautiful\nyoung wife (paler than formerly, all this time; more rarely seen by me\nor any one, I think; and not so gay, but not less beautiful), and so\nbecame more and more familiar by degrees, until, at last, he would come\ninto the school and wait. He always sat in a particular corner, on a\nparticular stool, which was called \"Dick,\" after him; here he would sit,\nwith his grey head bent forward, attentively listening to whatever might\nbe going on, with a profound veneration for the learning he had never\nbeen able to acquire.\n\nThis veneration Mr. Dick extended to the Doctor, whom he thought the\nmost subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age. It was long before\nMr. Dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bare-headed; and even when he\nand the Doctor had struck up quite a friendship, and would walk together\nby the hour, on that side of the courtyard which was known among us as\nThe Doctor's Walk, Mr. Dick would pull off his hat at intervals to show\nhis respect for wisdom and knowledge. How it ever came about, that the\nDoctor began to read out scraps of the famous Dictionary, in these\nwalks, I never knew; perhaps he felt it all the same, at first, as\nreading to himself. However, it passed into a custom too; and Mr. Dick,\nlistening with a face shining with pride and pleasure, in his heart of\nhearts believed the Dictionary to be the most delightful book in the\nworld.\n\nAs I think of them going up and down before those school-room\nwindows--the Doctor reading with his complacent smile, an occasional\nflourish of the manuscript, or grave motion of his head; and Mr. Dick\nlistening, enchained by interest, with his poor wits calmly wandering\nGod knows where, upon the wings of hard words--I think of it as one of\nthe pleasantest things, in a quiet way, that I have ever seen. I feel\nas if they might go walking to and fro for ever, and the world might\nsomehow be the better for it--as if a thousand things it makes a noise\nabout, were not one-half so good for it, or me.\n\nAgnes was one of Mr. Dick's friends, very soon; and in often coming to\nthe house, he made acquaintance with Uriah. The friendship between\nhimself and me increased continually, and it was maintained on this odd\nfooting: that, while Mr. Dick came professedly to look after me as my\nguardian, he always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that\narose, and invariably guided himself by my advice; not only having a\nhigh respect for my native sagacity, but considering that I inherited a\ngood deal from my aunt.\n\nOne Thursday morning, when I was about to walk with Mr. Dick from the\nhotel to the coach-office before going back to school (for we had an\nhour's school before breakfast), I met Uriah in the street, who reminded\nme of the promise I had made to take tea with himself and his mother:\nadding, with a writhe, \"But I didn't expect you to keep it, Master\nCopperfield, we're so very umble.\"\n\nI really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah\nor detested him; and I was very doubtful about it still, as I stood\nlooking him in the face in the street. But I felt it quite an affront to\nbe supposed proud, and said I only wanted to be asked.\n\n\"Oh, if that's all, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah, \"and it really\nisn't our umbleness that prevents you, will you come this evening? But\nif it is our umbleness, I hope you won't mind owning to it, Master\nCopperfield; for we are well aware of our condition.\"\n\nI said I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield, and if he approved, as I had\nno doubt he would, I would come with pleasure. So, at six o'clock that\nevening, which was one of the early office evenings, I announced myself\nas ready, to Uriah.\n\n\"Mother will be proud indeed,\" he said, as we walked away together. \"Or\nshe would be proud, if it wasn't sinful, Master Copperfield.\"\n\n\"Yet you didn't mind supposing _I_ was proud this morning,\" I returned.\n\n\"Oh dear no, Master Copperfield!\" returned Uriah. \"Oh, believe me, no!\nSuch a thought never came into my head! I shouldn't have deemed it at\nall proud if you had thought _us_ too umble for you. Because we are so\nvery umble.\"\n\n\"Have you been studying much law lately?\" I asked, to change the\nsubject.\n\n\"Oh, Master Copperfield,\" he said, with an air of self-denial, \"my\nreading is hardly to be called study. I have passed an hour or two in\nthe evening, sometimes, with Mr. Tidd.\"\n\n\"Rather hard, I suppose?\" said I.\n\n\"He is hard to _me_ sometimes,\" returned Uriah. \"But I don't know what\nhe might be, to a gifted person.\"\n\nAfter beating a little tune on his chin as we walked on, with the two\nfore-fingers of his skeleton right hand, he added:\n\n\"There are expressions, you see, Master Copperfield--Latin words and\nterms--in Mr. Tidd, that are trying to a reader of my umble\nattainments.\"\n\n\"Would you like to be taught Latin?\" I said, briskly. \"I will teach it\nyou with pleasure, as I learn it.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,\" he answered, shaking his head. \"I\nam sure it's very kind of you to make the offer, but I am much too umble\nto accept it.\"\n\n\"What nonsense, Uriah!\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed you must excuse me, Master Copperfield! I am greatly\nobliged, and I should like it of all things, I assure you; but I am far\ntoo umble. There are people enough to tread upon me in my lowly state,\nwithout my doing outrage to their feelings by possessing learning.\nLearning ain't for me. A person like myself had better not aspire. If he\nis to get on in life, he must get on umbly, Master Copperfield.\"\n\nI never saw his mouth so wide, or the creases in his cheeks so deep, as\nwhen he delivered himself of these sentiments: shaking his head all the\ntime, and writhing modestly.\n\n\"I think you are wrong, Uriah,\" I said. \"I dare say there are several\nthings that I could teach you, if you would like to learn them.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't doubt that, Master Copperfield,\" he answered; \"not in the\nleast. But not being umble yourself, you don't judge well, perhaps, for\nthem that are. I won't provoke my betters with knowledge, thank you. I'm\nmuch too umble. Here is my umble dwelling, Master Copperfield!\"\n\nWe entered a low, old-fashioned room, walked straight into from the\nstreet, and found there, Mrs. Heep, who was the dead image of Uriah,\nonly short. She received me with the utmost humility, and apologised to\nme for giving her son a kiss, observing that, lowly as they were, they\nhad their natural affections, which they hoped would give no offence to\nany one. It was a perfectly decent room, half parlor and half kitchen,\nbut not at all a snug room. The tea-things were set upon the table, and\nthe kettle was boiling on the hob. There was a chest of drawers with an\nescrutoire top, for Uriah to read or write at of an evening; there was\nUriah's blue bag lying down and vomiting papers; there was a company of\nUriah's books, commanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard; and\nthere were the usual articles of furniture. I don't remember that any\nindividual object had a bare, pinched, spare look; but I do remember\nthat the whole place had.\n\nIt was perhaps a part of Mrs. Heep's humility, that she still wore\nweeds. Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since Mr.\nHeep's decease, she still wore weeds. I think there was some compromise\nin the cap; but otherwise she was as weedy as in the early days of her\nmourning.\n\n\"This is a day to be remembered, my Uriah, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Heep,\nmaking the tea, \"when Master Copperfield pays us a visit.\"\n\n\"I said you'd think so, mother,\" said Uriah.\n\n\"If I could have wished father to remain among us for any reason,\" said\nMrs. Heep, \"it would have been, that he might have known his company\nthis afternoon.\"\n\nI felt embarrassed by these compliments; but I was sensible, too, of\nbeing entertained as an honored guest, and I thought Mrs. Heep an\nagreeable woman.\n\n\"My Uriah,\" said Mrs. Heep, \"has looked forward to this, sir, a long\nwhile. He had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way, and I\njoined in them myself. Umble we are, umble we have been, umble we shall\never be,\" said Mrs. Heep.\n\n\"I am sure you have no occasion to be so, ma'am,\" I said, \"unless you\nlike.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" retorted Mrs. Heep. \"We know our station and are\nthankful in it.\"\n\nI found that Mrs. Heep gradually got nearer to me, and that Uriah\ngradually got opposite to me, and that they respectfully plied me with\nthe choicest of the eatables on the table. There was nothing\nparticularly choice there, to be sure; but I took the will for the deed,\nand felt that they were very attentive. Presently they began to talk\nabout aunts, and then I told them about mine; and about fathers and\nmothers, and then I told them about mine; and then Mrs. Heep began to\ntalk about fathers-in-law, and then I began to tell her about mine--but\nstopped, because my aunt had advised me to observe a silence on that\nsubject. A tender young cork, however, would have had no more chance\nagainst a pair of corkscrews, or a tender young tooth against a pair of\ndentists, or a little shuttlecock against two battledores, than I had\nagainst Uriah and Mrs. Heep. They did just what they liked with me; and\nwormed things out of me that I had no desire to tell, with a certainty I\nblush to think of: the more especially as, in my juvenile frankness, I\ntook some credit to myself for being so confidential, and felt that I\nwas quite the patron of my two respectful entertainers.\n\nThey were very fond of one another: that was certain. I take it that had\nits effect upon me, as a touch of nature; but the skill with which the\none followed up whatever the other said, was a touch of art which I was\nstill less proof against. When there was nothing more to be got out of\nme about myself (for on the Murdstone and Grinby life, and on my\njourney, I was dumb), they began about Mr. Wickfield and Agnes. Uriah\nthrew the ball to Mrs. Heep, Mrs. Heep caught it and threw it back to\nUriah, Uriah kept it up a little while, then sent it back to Mrs. Heep,\nand so they went on tossing it about until I had no idea who had got it,\nand was quite bewildered. The ball itself was always changing too. Now\nit was Mr. Wickfield, now Agnes, now the excellence of Mr. Wickfield,\nnow my admiration of Agnes; now the extent of Mr. Wickfield's business\nand resources, now our domestic life after dinner; now, the wine that\nMr. Wickfield took, the reason why he took it, and the pity that it was\nhe took so much; now one thing, now another, then everything at once;\nand all the time, without appearing to speak very often, or to do\nanything but sometimes encourage them a little, for fear they should be\novercome by their humility and the honor of my company, I found myself\nperpetually letting out something or other that I had no business to let\nout, and seeing the effect of it in the twinkling of Uriah's dinted\nnostrils.\n\nI had begun to be a little uncomfortable, and to wish myself well out of\nthe visit, when a figure coming down the street passed the door--it\nstood open to air the room, which was warm, the weather being close for\nthe time of year--came back again, looked in, and walked in, exclaiming\nloudly, \"Copperfield! Is it possible!\"\n\n  [Illustration: Somebody turns up.]\n\nIt was Mr. Micawber! It was Mr. Micawber, with his eye-glass, and his\nwalking-stick, and his shirt-collar, and his genteel air, and the\ncondescending roll in his voice, all complete!\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, putting out his hand, \"this is\nindeed a meeting which is calculated to impress the mind with a sense of\nthe instability and uncertainty of all human--in short, it is a most\nextraordinary meeting. Walking along the street, reflecting upon the\nprobability of something turning up (of which I am at present rather\nsanguine), I find a young, but valued friend turn up, who is connected\nwith the most eventful period of my life; I may say, with the turning\npoint of my existence. Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?\"\n\nI cannot say--I really can_not_ say--that I was glad to see Mr. Micawber\nthere; but I was glad to see him too, and shook hands with him heartily,\ninquiring how Mrs. Micawber was.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Micawber, waving his hand as of old, and settling\nhis chin in his shirt-collar. \"She is tolerably convalescent. The twins\nno longer derive their sustenance from Nature's founts--in short,\" said\nMr. Micawber, in one of his bursts of confidence, \"they are weaned--and\nMrs. Micawber is, at present, my travelling companion. She will be\nrejoiced, Copperfield, to renew her acquaintance with one who has proved\nhimself in all respects a worthy minister at the sacred altar of\nfriendship.\"\n\nI said I should be delighted to see her.\n\n\"You are very good,\" said Mr. Micawber.\n\nMr. Micawber then smiled, settled his chin again, and looked about him.\n\n\"I have discovered my friend Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber genteelly,\nand without addressing himself particularly to any one, \"not in\nsolitude, but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady,\nand one who is apparently her offspring--in short,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nin another of his bursts of confidence, \"her son. I shall esteem it an\nhonor to be presented.\"\n\nI could do no less, under these circumstances, than make Mr. Micawber\nknown to Uriah Heep and his mother; which I accordingly did. As they\nabased themselves before him, Mr. Micawber took a seat, and waved his\nhand in his most courtly manner.\n\n\"Any friend of my friend Copperfield's,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"has a\npersonal claim upon myself.\"\n\n\"We are too umble, sir,\" said Mrs. Heep, \"my son and me, to be the\nfriends of Master Copperfield. He has been so good as take his tea with\nus, and we are thankful to him for his company; also to you, sir, for\nyour notice.\"\n\n\"Ma'am,\" returned Mr. Micawber, with a bow, \"you are very obliging: and\nwhat are you doing, Copperfield? Still in the wine trade?\"\n\nI was excessively anxious to get Mr. Micawber away; and replied, with my\nhat in my hand, and a very red face I have no doubt, that I was a pupil\nat Doctor Strong's.\n\n\"A pupil?\" said Mr. Micawber, raising his eyebrows. \"I am extremely\nhappy to hear it. Although a mind like my friend Copperfield's\"--to\nUriah and Mrs. Heep--\"does not require that cultivation which, without\nhis knowledge of men and things, it would require, still it is a rich\nsoil teeming with latent vegetation--in short,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nsmiling, in another burst of confidence, \"it is an intellect capable of\ngetting up the classics to any extent.\"\n\nUriah, with his long hands slowly twining over one another, made a\nghastly writhe from the waist upwards, to express his concurrence in\nthis estimation of me.\n\n\"Shall we go and see Mrs. Micawber, sir?\" I said, to get Mr. Micawber\naway.\n\n\"If you will do her that favor, Copperfield,\" replied Mr. Micawber,\nrising. \"I have no scruple in saying, in the presence of our friends\nhere, that I am a man who has, for some years, contended against the\npressure of pecuniary difficulties,\" I knew he was certain to say\nsomething of this kind; he always would be so boastful about his\ndifficulties. \"Sometimes I have risen superior to my difficulties.\nSometimes my difficulties have--in short, have floored me. There have\nbeen times when I have administered a succession of facers to them;\nthere have been times when they have been too many for me, and I have\ngiven in, and said to Mrs. Micawber in the words of Cato, 'Plato, thou\nreasonest well. It's all up now. I can show fight no more.' But at no\ntime of my life,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"have I enjoyed a higher degree of\nsatisfaction than in pouring my griefs (if I may describe difficulties,\nchiefly arising out of warrants of attorney and promissory notes at two\nand four months, by that word) into the bosom of my friend Copperfield.\"\n\nMr. Micawber closed this handsome tribute by saying, \"Mr. Heep! Good\nevening. Mrs. Heep! Your servant,\" and then walking out with me in his\nmost fashionable manner, making a good deal of noise on the pavement\nwith his shoes, and humming a tune as we went.\n\nIt was a little inn where Mr. Micawber put up, and he occupied a little\nroom in it, partitioned off from the commercial room, and strongly\nflavored with tobacco smoke. I think it was over the kitchen, because a\nwarm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor,\nand there was a flabby perspiration on the walls. I know it was near the\nbar, on account of the smell of spirits and gingling of glasses. Here,\nrecumbent on a small sofa, underneath a picture of a race-horse, with\nher head close to the fire, and her feet pushing the mustard off the\ndumb-waiter at the other end of the room, was Mrs. Micawber, to whom Mr.\nMicawber entered first, saying, \"My dear, allow me to introduce to you a\npupil of Doctor Strong's.\"\n\nI noticed, by-the-by, that although Mr. Micawber was just as much\nconfused as ever about my age and standing, he always remembered, as a\ngenteel thing, that I was a pupil of Doctor Strong's.\n\nMrs. Micawber was amazed, but very glad to see me. I was very glad to\nsee her too, and after an affectionate greeting on both sides, sat down\non the small sofa near her.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"if you will mention to Copperfield what\nour present position is, which I have no doubt he will like to know, I\nwill go and look at the paper the while, and see whether any thing turns\nup among the advertisements.\"\n\n\"I thought you were at Plymouth, ma'am,\" I said to Mrs. Micawber, as he\nwent out.\n\n\"My dear Master Copperfield,\" she replied, \"we went to Plymouth.\"\n\n\"To be on the spot,\" I hinted.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mrs. Micawber. \"To be on the spot. But, the truth is,\ntalent is not wanted in the Custom House. The local influence of my\nfamily was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department,\nfor a man of Mr. Micawber's abilities. They would rather _not_ have a\nman of Mr. Micawber's abilities. He would only show the deficiency of\nthe others. Apart from which,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"I will not disguise\nfrom you, my dear Master Copperfield, that when that branch of my family\nwhich is settled in Plymouth became aware that Mr. Micawber was\naccompanied by myself, and by little Wilkins and his sister, and by the\ntwins, they did not receive him with that ardor which he might have\nexpected, being so newly released from captivity. In fact,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, lowering her voice,--\"this is between ourselves--our reception\nwas cool.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Micawber. \"It is truly painful to contemplate mankind\nin such an aspect, Master Copperfield, but our reception was, decidedly,\ncool. There is no doubt about it. In fact, that branch of my family\nwhich is settled in Plymouth became quite personal to Mr. Micawber,\nbefore we had been there a week.\"\n\nI said, and thought, that they ought to be ashamed of themselves.\n\n\"Still, so it was,\" continued Mrs. Micawber. \"Under such circumstances,\nwhat could a man of Mr. Micawber's spirit do? But one obvious course was\nleft. To borrow, of that branch of my family, the money to return to\nLondon, and to return at any sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Then you all came back again, ma'am?\" I said.\n\n\"We all came back again,\" replied Mrs. Micawber. \"Since then, I have\nconsulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most\nexpedient for Mr. Micawber to take--for I maintain that he must take\nsome course, Master Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, argumentatively.\n\"It is clear that a family of six, not including a domestic, cannot live\nupon air.\"\n\n\"Certainly, ma'am,\" said I.\n\n\"The opinion of those other branches of my family,\" pursued Mrs.\nMicawber, \"is, that Mr. Micawber should immediately turn his attention\nto coals.\"\n\n\"To what, ma'am?\"\n\n\"To coals,\" said Mrs. Micawber. \"To the coal trade. Mr. Micawber was\ninduced to think, on inquiry, that there might be an opening for a man\nof his talent in the Medway Coal Trade. Then, as Mr. Micawber very\nproperly said, the first step to be taken clearly was, to come and _see_\nthe Medway. Which we came and saw. I say 'we,' Master Copperfield; for I\nnever will,\" said Mrs. Micawber with emotion, \"I never will desert Mr.\nMicawber.\"\n\nI murmured my admiration and approbation.\n\n\"We came,\" repeated Mrs. Micawber, \"and saw the Medway. My opinion of\nthe coal trade on that river, is, that it may require talent, but that\nit certainly requires capital. Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr.\nMicawber has not. We saw, I think, the greater part of the Medway; and\nthat is my individual conclusion. Being so near here, Mr. Micawber was\nof opinion that it would be rash not to come on, and see the Cathedral.\nFirstly, on account of its being so well worth seeing, and our never\nhaving seen it; and secondly, on account of the great probability of\nsomething turning up in a cathedral town. We have been here,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, \"three days. Nothing has, as yet, turned up; and it may not\nsurprise you, my dear Master Copperfield, so much as it would a\nstranger, to know that we are at present waiting for a remittance from\nLondon, to discharge our pecuniary obligations at this hotel. Until the\narrival of that remittance,\" said Mrs. Micawber, with much feeling, \"I\nam cut off from my home (I allude to lodgings in Pentonville), from my\nboy and girl, and from my twins.\"\n\nI felt the utmost sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in this anxious\nextremity, and said as much to Mr. Micawber, who now returned: adding\nthat I only wished I had money enough, to lend them the amount they\nneeded. Mr. Micawber's answer expressed the disturbance of his mind. He\nsaid, shaking hands with me, \"Copperfield, you are a true friend; but\nwhen the worst comes to the worst, no man is without a friend who is\npossessed of shaving materials.\" At this dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber\nthrew her arms round Mr. Micawber's neck and entreated him to be calm.\nHe wept; but so far recovered, almost immediately, as to ring the bell\nfor the waiter, and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps\nfor breakfast in the morning.\n\nWhen I took my leave of them, they both pressed me so much to come and\ndine before they went away, that I could not refuse. But, as I knew I\ncould not come next day, when I should have a good deal to prepare in\nthe evening, Mr. Micawber arranged that he would call at Doctor Strong's\nin the course of the morning (having a presentiment that the remittance\nwould arrive by that post), and propose the day after, if it would suit\nme better. Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon, and\nfound Mr. Micawber in the parlor; who had called to say that the dinner\nwould take place as proposed. When I asked him if the remittance had\ncome, he pressed my hand and departed.\n\nAs I was looking out of window that same evening, it surprised me, and\nmade me rather uneasy, to see Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walk past, arm\nin arm: Uriah humbly sensible of the honor that was done him, and Mr.\nMicawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to Uriah. But\nI was still more surprised, when I went to the little hotel next day at\nthe appointed dinner hour, which was four o'clock, to find, from what\nMr. Micawber said, that he had gone home with Uriah, and had drunk\nbrandy-and-water at Mrs. Heep's.\n\n\"And I'll tell you what, my dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"your\nfriend Heep is a young fellow who might be attorney-general. If I had\nknown that young man, at the period when my difficulties came to a\ncrisis, all I can say is, that I believe my creditors would have been a\ngreat deal better managed than they were.\"\n\nI hardly understood how this could have been, seeing that Mr. Micawber\nhad paid them nothing at all as it was; but I did not like to ask.\nNeither did I like to say, that I hoped he had not been too\ncommunicative to Uriah; or to inquire if they had talked much about me.\nI was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber's feelings, or, at all events, Mrs.\nMicawber's, she being very sensitive; but I was uncomfortable about it,\ntoo, and often thought about it afterwards.\n\nWe had a beautiful little dinner. Quite an elegant dish of fish; the\nkidney-end of a loin of veal, roasted; fried sausage-meat; a partridge,\nand a pudding. There was wine, and there was strong ale; and after\ndinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands.\n\nMr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial. I never saw him such good\ncompany. He made his face shine with the punch, so that it looked as if\nit had been varnished all over. He got cheerfully sentimental about the\ntown, and proposed success to it; observing, that Mrs. Micawber and\nhimself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there, and that he\nnever should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in Canterbury.\nHe proposed me afterwards; and he, and Mrs. Micawber, and I, took a\nreview of our past acquaintance, in the course of which we sold the\nproperty all over again. Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber; or, at least,\nsaid, modestly, \"If you'll allow me, Mrs. Micawber, I shall now have the\npleasure of drinking _your_ health, ma'am.\" On which Mr. Micawber\ndelivered an eulogium on Mrs. Micawber's character, and said she had\never been his guide, philosopher, and friend, and that he would\nrecommend me, when I came to a marrying time of life, to marry such\nanother woman, if such another woman could be found.\n\nAs the punch disappeared, Mr. Micawber became still more friendly and\nconvivial. Mrs. Micawber's spirits becoming elevated, too, we sang \"Auld\nLang Syne.\" When we came to \"Here's a hand, my trusty frere,\" we all\njoined hands round the table; and when we declared we would \"take a\nright gude Willie Waught,\" and hadn't the least idea what it meant, we\nwere really affected.\n\nIn a word, I never saw any body so thoroughly jovial as Mr. Micawber\nwas, down to the very last moment of the evening, when I took a hearty\nfarewell of himself and his amiable wife. Consequently, I was not\nprepared, at seven o'clock next morning, to receive the following\ncommunication, dated half-past nine in the evening; a quarter of an hour\nafter I had left him.\n\n     \"MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND,\n\n     \"The die is cast--all is over. Hiding the ravages of care with a\n     sickly mask of mirth, I have not informed you, this evening, that\n     there is no hope of the remittance! Under these circumstances,\n     alike humiliating to endure, humiliating to contemplate, and\n     humiliating to relate, I have discharged the pecuniary liability\n     contracted at this establishment, by giving a note of hand, made\n     payable fourteen days after date, at my residence, Pentonville,\n     London. When it becomes due, it will not be taken up. The result\n     is destruction. The bolt is impending, and the tree must fall.\n\n     \"Let the wretched man who now addresses you, my dear Copperfield,\n     be a beacon to you through life. He writes with that intention,\n     and in that hope. If he could think himself of so much use, one\n     gleam of day might, by possibility, penetrate into the cheerless\n     dungeon of his remaining existence--though his longevity is, at\n     present (to say the least of it), extremely problematical.\n\n     \"This is the last communication, my dear Copperfield, you will\n     ever receive\n                              \"From\n                                  \"The\n                                     \"Beggared Outcast,\n                                                \"WILKINS MICAWBER.\"\n\nI was so shocked by the contents of this heart-rending letter, that I\nran off directly towards the little hotel with the intention of taking\nit on my way to Doctor Strong's, and trying to soothe Mr. Micawber with\na word of comfort. But, half-way there, I met the London coach with Mr.\nand Mrs. Micawber up behind; Mr. Micawber, the very picture of tranquil\nenjoyment, smiling at Mrs. Micawber's conversation, eating walnuts out\nof a paper bag, with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket. As\nthey did not see me, I thought it best, all things considered, not to\nsee them. So, with a great weight taken off my mind, I turned into a\nby-street that was the nearest way to school, and felt, upon the whole,\nrelieved that they were gone; though I still liked them very much,\nnevertheless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nA RETROSPECT.\n\n\nMy school-days! The silent gliding on of my existence--the unseen,\nunfelt progress of my life--from childhood up to youth! Let me think, as\nI look back upon that flowing water, now a dry channel overgrown with\nleaves, whether there are any marks along its course, by which I can\nremember how it ran.\n\nA moment, and I occupy my place in the Cathedral, where we all went\ntogether, every Sunday morning, assembling first at school for that\npurpose. The earthy smell, the sunless air, the sensation of the world\nbeing shut out, the resounding of the organ through the black and white\narched galleries and aisles, are wings that take me back, and hold me\nhovering above those days, in a half-sleeping and half-waking dream.\n\nI am not the last boy in the school. I have risen, in a few months, over\nseveral heads. But the first boy seems to me a mighty creature, dwelling\nafar off, whose giddy height is unattainable. Agnes says \"No,\" but I say\n\"Yes,\" and tell her that she little thinks what stores of knowledge have\nbeen mastered by the wonderful Being, at whose place she thinks I, even\nI, weak aspirant, may arrive in time. He is not my private friend and\npublic patron, as Steerforth was, but I hold him in a reverential\nrespect. I chiefly wonder what he'll be, when he leaves Doctor Strong's,\nand what mankind will do to maintain any place against him.\n\nBut who is this that breaks upon me? This is Miss Shepherd, whom I love.\n\nMiss Shepherd is a boarder at the Misses Nettingalls' establishment. I\nadore Miss Shepherd. She is a little girl, in a spencer, with a round\nface and curly flaxen hair. The Misses Nettingalls' young ladies come to\nthe Cathedral too. I cannot look upon my book, for I must look upon Miss\nShepherd. When the choristers chaunt, I hear Miss Shepherd. In the\nservice I mentally insert Miss Shepherd's name--I put her in among the\nRoyal Family. At home, in my own room, I am sometimes moved to cry out,\n\"Oh, Miss Shepherd!\" in a transport of love.\n\nFor some time, I am doubtful of Miss Shepherd's feelings, but, at\nlength, Fate being propitious, we meet at the dancing-school. I have\nMiss Shepherd for my partner. I touch Miss Shepherd's glove, and feel a\nthrill go up the right arm of my jacket, and come out at my hair. I say\nnothing tender to Miss Shepherd, but we understand each other. Miss\nShepherd and myself live but to be united.\n\nWhy do I secretly give Miss Shepherd twelve Brazil nuts for a present, I\nwonder? They are not expressive of affection, they are difficult to pack\ninto a parcel of any regular shape, they are hard to crack, even in room\ndoors, and they are oily when cracked; yet I feel that they are\nappropriate to Miss Shepherd. Soft, seedy biscuits, also, I bestow upon\nMiss Shepherd; and oranges innumerable. Once, I kiss Miss Shepherd in\nthe cloak room. Ecstacy! What are my agony and indignation next day,\nwhen I hear a flying rumour that the Misses Nettingall have stood Miss\nShepherd in the stocks for turning in her toes!\n\nMiss Shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life, how\ndo I ever come to break with her? I can't conceive. And yet a coolness\ngrows between Miss Shepherd and myself. Whispers reach me of Miss\nShepherd having said she wished I wouldn't stare so, and having avowed a\npreference for Master Jones--for Jones! a boy of no merit whatever! The\ngulf between me and Miss Shepherd widens. At last, one day, I meet the\nMisses Nettingalls' establishment out walking. Miss Shepherd makes a\nface as she goes by, and laughs to her companion. All is over. The\ndevotion of a life--it seems a life, it is all the same--is at an end;\nMiss Shepherd comes out of the morning service, and the Royal Family\nknow her no more.\n\nI am higher in the school, and no one breaks my peace. I am not at all\npolite, now, to the Misses Nettingalls' young ladies, and shouldn't dote\non any of them, if they were twice as many and twenty times as\nbeautiful. I think the dancing-school a tiresome affair, and wonder why\nthe girls can't dance by themselves and leave us alone. I am growing\ngreat in Latin verses, and neglect the laces of my boots. Doctor Strong\nrefers to me in public as a promising young scholar. Mr. Dick is wild\nwith joy, and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post.\n\nThe shade of a young butcher rises, like the apparition of an armed head\nin Macbeth. Who is this young butcher? He is the terror of the youth of\nCanterbury. There is a vague belief abroad, that the beef suet with\nwhich he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength, and that he is a\nmatch for a man. He is a broad-faced, bull-necked young butcher, with\nrough red cheeks, an ill-conditioned mind, and an injurious tongue. His\nmain use of this tongue, is, to disparage Doctor Strong's young\ngentlemen. He says, publicly, that if they want anything he'll give it\n'em. He names individuals among them (myself included), whom he could\nundertake to settle with one hand, and the other tied behind him. He\nwaylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads, and calls\nchallenges after me in the open streets. For these sufficient reasons I\nresolve to fight the butcher.\n\nIt is a summer evening, down in a green hollow, at the corner of a wall.\nI meet the butcher by appointment. I am attended by a select body of our\nboys; the butcher, by two other butchers, a young publican, and a sweep.\nThe preliminaries are adjusted, and the butcher and myself stand face to\nface. In a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of my left\neyebrow. In another moment, I don't know where the wall is, or where I\nam, or where anybody is. I hardly know which is myself and which the\nbutcher, we are always in such a tangle and tustle, knocking about upon\nthe trodden grass. Sometimes I see the butcher, bloody but confident;\nsometimes I see nothing, and sit gasping on my second's knee; sometimes\nI go in at the butcher madly, and cut my knuckles open against his face,\nwithout appearing to discompose him at all. At last I awake, very queer\nabout the head, as from a giddy sleep, and see the butcher walking off,\ncongratulated by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican, and\nputting on his coat as he goes; from which I augur, justly, that the\nvictory is his.\n\nI am taken home in a sad plight, and I have beef-steaks put to my eyes,\nand am rubbed with vinegar and brandy, and find a great white puffy\nplace bursting out on my upper lip, which swells immoderately. For three\nor four days I remain at home, a very ill-looking subject, with a green\nshade over my eyes; and I should be very dull, but that Agnes is a\nsister to me, and condoles with me, and reads to me, and makes the time\nlight and happy. Agnes has my confidence completely, always; I tell her\nall about the butcher, and the wrongs he has heaped upon me; and she\nthinks I couldn't have done otherwise than fight the butcher, while she\nshrinks and trembles at my having fought him.\n\nTime has stolen on unobserved, for Adams is not the head-boy in the days\nthat are come now, nor has he been this many and many a day. Adams has\nleft the school so long, that when he comes back, on a visit to Doctor\nStrong, there are not many there, besides myself, who know him. Adams is\ngoing to be called to the bar almost directly, and is to be an advocate,\nand to wear a wig. I am surprised to find him a meeker man than I had\nthought, and less imposing in appearance. He has not staggered the world\nyet, either; for it goes on (as well as I can make out) pretty much the\nsame as if he had never joined it.\n\nA blank, through which the warriors of poetry and history march on in\nstately hosts that seem to have no end--and what comes next! _I_ am the\nhead boy, now; and look down on the line of boys below me, with a\ncondescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy I was\nmyself, when I first came there. That little fellow seems to be no part\nof me; I remember him as something left behind upon the road of life--as\nsomething I have passed, rather than have actually been--and almost\nthink of him as of some one else.\n\nAnd the little girl I saw on that first day at Mr. Wickfield's, where\nis she? Gone also. In her stead, the perfect likeness of the picture,\na child likeness no more, moves about the house; and Agnes--my sweet\nsister, as I call her in my thoughts, my counsellor and friend, the\nbetter angel of the lives of all who come within her calm, good,\nself-denying influence--is quite a woman.\n\nWhat other changes have come upon me, besides the changes in my growth\nand looks, and in the knowledge I have garnered all this while? I wear a\ngold watch and chain, a ring upon my little finger, and a long-tailed\ncoat; and I use a great deal of bear's grease--which, taken in\nconjunction with the ring, looks bad. Am I in love again? I am. I\nworship the eldest Miss Larkins.\n\nThe eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl. She is a tall, dark,\nblack-eyed, fine figure of a woman. The eldest Miss Larkins is not a\nchicken; for the youngest Miss Larkins is not that, and the eldest must\nbe three or four years older. Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be\nabout thirty. My passion for her is beyond all bounds.\n\nThe eldest Miss Larkins knows officers. It is an awful thing to bear. I\nsee them speaking to her in the street. I see them cross the way to meet\nher, when her bonnet (she has a bright taste in bonnets) is seen coming\ndown the pavement, accompanied by her sister's bonnet. She laughs and\ntalks, and seems to like it. I spend a good deal of my own spare time in\nwalking up and down to meet her. If I can bow to her once in the day (I\nknow her to bow to, knowing Mr. Larkins), I am happier. I deserve a bow\nnow and then. The raging agonies I suffer on the night of the Race Ball,\nwhere I know the eldest Miss Larkins will be dancing with the military,\nought to have some compensation, if there be even-handed justice in the\nworld.\n\nMy passion takes away my appetite, and makes me wear my newest silk\nneck-kerchief continually. I have no relief but in putting on my best\nclothes, and having my boots cleaned over and over again. I seem, then,\nto be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins. Everything that belongs to\nher, or is connected with her, is precious to me. Mr. Larkins (a gruff\nold gentleman with a double chin, and one of his eyes immoveable in his\nhead) is fraught with interest to me. When I can't meet his daughter, I\ngo where I am likely to meet him. To say \"How do you do, Mr. Larkins?\nAre the young ladies and all the family quite well?\" seems so pointed,\nthat I blush.\n\nI think continually about my age. Say I am seventeen, and say that\nseventeen is young for the eldest Miss Larkins, what of that? Besides, I\nshall be one-and-twenty in no time almost. I regularly take walks\noutside Mr. Larkins's house in the evening, though it cuts me to the\nheart to see the officers go in, or to hear them up in the drawing-room,\nwhere the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp. I even walk, on two or\nthree occasions, in a sickly, spoony manner, round and round the house\nafter the family are gone to bed, wondering which is the eldest Miss\nLarkins's chamber (and pitching, I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins's\ninstead); wishing that a fire would burst out; that the assembled crowd\nwould stand appalled; that I, dashing through them with a ladder, might\nrear it against her window, save her in my arms, go back for something\nshe had left behind, and perish in the flames. For I am generally\ndisinterested in my love, and think I could be content to make a figure\nbefore Miss Larkins, and expire.\n\n--Generally, but not always. Sometimes brighter visions rise before me.\nWhen I dress (the occupation of two hours), for a great ball given at\nthe Larkins's (the anticipation of three weeks), I indulge my fancy with\npleasing images. I picture myself taking courage to make a declaration\nto Miss Larkins. I picture Miss Larkins sinking her head upon my\nshoulder, and saying, \"Oh, Mr. Copperfield, can I believe my ears!\" I\npicture Mr. Larkins waiting on me next morning, and saying, \"My dear\nCopperfield, my daughter has told me all. Youth is no objection. Here\nare twenty thousand pounds. Be happy!\" I picture my aunt relenting, and\nblessing us; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong being present at the\nmarriage ceremony. I am a sensible fellow, I believe--I believe, on\nlooking back, I mean--and modest I am sure; but all this goes on\nnotwithstanding.\n\nI repair to the enchanted house, where there are lights, chattering,\nmusic, flowers, officers (I am sorry to see), and the eldest Miss\nLarkins, a blaze of beauty. She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers\nin her hair--forget-me-nots--as if _she_ had any need to wear\nforget-me-nots! It is the first really grown-up party that I have ever\nbeen invited to, and I am a little uncomfortable; for I appear not\nto belong to anybody, and nobody appears to have anything to say to\nme, except Mr. Larkins, who asks me how my schoolfellows are, which\nhe needn't do, as I have not come there to be insulted. But after I\nhave stood in the doorway for some time, and feasted my eyes upon\nthe goddess of my heart, she approaches me--she, the eldest Miss\nLarkins!--and asks me, pleasantly, if I dance.\n\nI stammer, with a bow, \"With you, Miss Larkins.\"\n\n\"With no one else?\" enquires Miss Larkins.\n\n\"I should have no pleasure in dancing with any one else.\"\n\nMiss Larkins laughs and blushes (or I think she blushes), and says,\n\"Next time but one, I shall be very glad.\"\n\nThe time arrives. \"It is a waltz, I think,\" Miss Larkins doubtfully\nobserves, when I present myself. \"Do you waltz? If not, Captain\nBailey--\"\n\nBut I do waltz (pretty well, too, as it happens), and I take Miss\nLarkins out. I take her sternly from the side of Captain Bailey. He is\nwretched, I have no doubt; but he is nothing to me. I have been\nwretched, too. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins! I don't know where,\namong whom, or how long. I only know that I swim about in space, with a\nblue angel, in a state of blissful delirium, until I find myself alone\nwith her in a little room, resting on a sofa. She admires a flower (pink\ncamelia japonica, price half-a-crown), in my button hole. I give it her,\nand say:\n\n\"I ask an inestimable price for it, Miss Larkins.\"\n\n\"Indeed! What is that?\" returns Miss Larkins.\n\n\"A flower of yours, that I may treasure it as a miser does gold.\"\n\n\"You're a bold boy,\" says Miss Larkins. \"There.\"\n\nShe gives it me, not displeased; and I put it to my lips, and then into\nmy breast. Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her hand through my arm, and\nsays, \"Now take me back to Captain Bailey.\"\n\nI am lost in the recollection of this delicious interview, and the\nwaltz, when she comes to me again, with a plain elderly gentleman, who\nhas been playing whist all night, upon her arm, and says:\n\n\"Oh! here is my bold friend! Mr. Chestle wants to know you, Mr.\nCopperfield.\"\n\nI feel at once that he is a friend of the family, and am much gratified.\n\n\"I admire your taste, sir,\" says Mr. Chestle. \"It does you credit.\nI suppose you don't take much interest in hops; but I am a pretty\nlarge grower myself; and if you ever like to come over to our\nneighbourhood--neighbourhood of Ashford--and take a run about our\nplace, we shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like.\"\n\nI thank Mr. Chestle warmly, and shake hands. I think I am in a happy\ndream. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again--she says I waltz\nso well! I go home in a state of unspeakable bliss, and waltz in\nimagination, all night long, with my arm round the blue waist of my dear\ndivinity. For some days afterwards, I am lost in rapturous reflections;\nbut I neither see her in the street, nor when I call. I am imperfectly\nconsoled for this disappointment by the sacred pledge, the perished\nflower.\n\n\"Trotwood,\" says Agnes, one day after dinner. \"Who do you think is going\nto be married to-morrow? Some one you admire.\"\n\n\"Not you, I suppose, Agnes?\"\n\n\"Not me!\" raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying. \"Do\nyou hear him, Papa?--The eldest Miss Larkins.\"\n\n\"To--to Captain Bailey?\" I have just power enough to ask.\n\n\"No; to no Captain. To Mr. Chestle, a hop-grower.\"\n\nI am terribly dejected for about a week or two. I take off my ring, I\nwear my worst clothes, I use no bear's grease, and I frequently lament\nover the late Miss Larkins's faded flower. Being, by that time, rather\ntired of this kind of life, and having received new provocation from the\nbutcher, I throw the flower away, go out with the butcher, and\ngloriously defeat him.\n\nThis, and the resumption of my ring, as well as of the bear's grease in\nmoderation, are the last marks I can discern, now, in my progress to\nseventeen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nI LOOK ABOUT ME, AND MAKE A DISCOVERY.\n\n\nI am doubtful whether I was at heart glad or sorry, when my school-days\ndrew to an end, and the time came for my leaving Doctor Strong's. I had\nbeen very happy there, I had a great attachment for the Doctor, and I\nwas eminent and distinguished in that little world. For these reasons I\nwas sorry to go; but for other reasons, unsubstantial enough, I was\nglad. Misty ideas of being a young man at my own disposal, of the\nimportance attaching to a young man at his own disposal, of the\nwonderful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal, and the\nwonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society, lured me away.\nSo powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind, that\nI seem, according to my present way of thinking, to have left school\nwithout natural regret. The separation has not made the impression on\nme, that other separations have. I try in vain to recal how I felt about\nit, and what its circumstances were; but it is not momentous in my\nrecollection. I suppose the opening prospect confused me. I know that my\njuvenile experiences went for little or nothing then; and that life was\nmore like a great fairy story, which I was just about to begin to read,\nthan anything else.\n\nMy aunt and I had held many grave deliberations on the calling to which\nI should be devoted. For a year or more I had endeavoured to find a\nsatisfactory answer to her often-repeated question, \"What I would like\nto be?\" But I had no particular liking, that I could discover, for\nanything. If I could have been inspired with a knowledge of the science\nof navigation, taken the command of a fast-sailing expedition, and gone\nround the world on a triumphant voyage of discovery, I think I might\nhave considered myself completely suited. But, in the absence of any\nsuch miraculous provision, my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit\nthat would not lie too heavily upon her purse; and to do my duty in it,\nwhatever it might be.\n\nMr. Dick had regularly assisted at our councils, with a meditative and\nsage demeanour. He never made a suggestion but once; and on that\noccasion (I don't know what put it in his head), he suddenly proposed\nthat I should be \"a Brazier.\" My aunt received this proposal so very\nungraciously, that he never ventured on a second; but ever afterwards\nconfined himself to looking watchfully at her for her suggestions, and\nrattling his money.\n\n\"Trot, I tell you what, my dear,\" said my aunt, one morning in the\nChristmas season when I left school; \"as this knotty point is still\nunsettled, and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can\nhelp it, I think we had better take a little breathing-time. In the\nmeanwhile, you must try to look at it from a new point of view, and not\nas a schoolboy.\"\n\n\"I will, aunt.\"\n\n\"It has occurred to me,\" pursued my aunt, \"that a little change, and a\nglimpse of life out of doors, may be useful, in helping you to know your\nown mind, and form a cooler judgment. Suppose you were to take a little\njourney now. Suppose you were to go down into the old part of the\ncountry again, for instance, and see that--that out-of-the-way woman\nwith the savagest of names,\" said my aunt, rubbing her nose, for she\ncould never thoroughly forgive Peggotty for being so called.\n\n\"Of all things in the world, aunt, I should like it best!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said my aunt, \"that's lucky, for I should like it too. But it's\nnatural and rational that you should like it. And I am very well\npersuaded that whatever you do, Trot, will always be natural and\nrational.\"\n\n\"I hope so, aunt.\"\n\n\"Your sister, Betsey Trotwood,\" said my aunt, \"would have been as\nnatural and rational a girl as ever breathed. You'll be worthy of her,\nwon't you?\"\n\n\"I hope I shall be worthy of _you_, aunt. That will be enough for me.\"\n\n\"It's a mercy that poor dear baby of a mother of yours didn't live,\"\nsaid my aunt, looking at me approvingly, \"or she'd have been so vain of\nher boy by this time, that her soft little head would have been\ncompletely turned, if there was anything of it left to turn.\" (My aunt\nalways excused any weakness of her own in my behalf, by transferring it\nin this way to my poor mother.) \"Bless me, Trotwood, how you do remind\nme of her!\"\n\n\"Pleasantly, I hope, aunt?\" said I.\n\n\"He's as like her, Dick,\" said my aunt, emphatically, \"he's as like her,\nas she was that afternoon, before she began to fret--bless my heart,\nhe's as like her, as he can look at me out of his two eyes!\"\n\n\"Is he indeed?\" said Mr. Dick.\n\n\"And he's like David, too,\" said my aunt, decisively.\n\n\"He is very like David!\" said Mr. Dick.\n\n\"But what I want you to be, Trot,\" resumed my aunt \"--I don't mean\nphysically, but morally; you are very well physically--is, a firm\nfellow. A fine firm fellow, with a will of your own. With resolution,\"\nsaid my aunt, shaking her cap at me, and clenching her hand. \"With\ndetermination. With character, Trot--with strength of character that is\nnot to be influenced, except on good reason, by anybody, or by anything.\nThat's what I want you to be. That's what your father and mother might\nboth have been, Heaven knows, and been the better for it.\"\n\nI intimated that I hoped I should be what she described.\n\n\"That you may begin, in a small way, to have a reliance upon yourself,\nand to act for yourself,\" said my aunt, \"I shall send you upon your\ntrip, alone. I did think, once, of Mr. Dick's going with you; but, on\nsecond thoughts, I shall keep him to take care of me.\"\n\nMr. Dick, for a moment, looked a little disappointed; until the honor\nand dignity of having to take care of the most wonderful woman in the\nworld, restored the sunshine to his face.\n\n\"Besides,\" said my aunt, \"there's the Memorial--\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Mr. Dick, in a hurry, \"I intend, Trotwood, to get\nthat done immediately--it really must be done immediately! And then it\nwill go in, you know--and then--,\" said Mr. Dick, after checking\nhimself, and pausing a long time, \"there'll be a pretty kettle of fish!\"\n\nIn pursuance of my aunt's kind scheme, I was shortly afterwards fitted\nout with a handsome purse of money, and a portmanteau, and tenderly\ndismissed upon my expedition. At parting, my aunt gave me some good\nadvice, and a good many kisses; and said that as her object was that I\nshould look about me, and should think a little, she would recommend me\nto stay a few days in London, if I liked it, either on my way down into\nSuffolk, or in coming back. In a word, I was at liberty to do what I\nwould, for three weeks or a month; and no other conditions were imposed\nupon my freedom than the before-mentioned thinking and looking about me,\nand a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself.\n\nI went to Canterbury first, that I might take leave of Agnes and Mr.\nWickfield (my old room in whose house I had not yet relinquished), and\nalso of the good Doctor. Agnes was very glad to see me, and told me that\nthe house had not been like itself since I had left it.\n\n\"I am sure I am not like myself when I am away,\" said I. \"I seem to want\nmy right hand, when I miss you. Though that's not saying much; for\nthere's no head in my right hand, and no heart. Every one who knows you,\nconsults with you, and is guided by you, Agnes.\"\n\n\"Every one who knows me, spoils me, I believe,\" she answered, smiling.\n\n\"No. It's because you are like no one else. You are so good, and so\nsweet-tempered. You have such a gentle nature, and you are always\nright.\"\n\n\"You talk,\" said Agnes, breaking into a pleasant laugh, as she sat at\nwork, \"as if I were the late Miss Larkins.\"\n\n\"Come! It's not fair to abuse my confidence,\" I answered, reddening\nat the recollection of my blue enslaver. \"But I shall confide in you,\njust the same, Agnes. I can never grow out of that. Whenever I fall\ninto trouble, or fall in love, I shall always tell you, if you'll let\nme--even when I come to fall in love in earnest.\"\n\n\"Why, you have always been in earnest!\" said Agnes, laughing again.\n\n\"Oh! that was as a child, or a school-boy,\" said I, laughing in my turn,\nnot without being a little shame-faced. \"Times are altering now, and I\nsuppose I shall be in a terrible state of earnestness one day or other.\nMy wonder is, that you are not in earnest yourself, by this time,\nAgnes.\"\n\nAgnes laughed again, and shook her head.\n\n\"Oh, I know you are not!\" said I, \"because if you had been, you would\nhave told me. Or at least\"--for I saw a faint blush in her face, \"you\nwould have let me find it out for myself. But there is no one that I\nknow of, who deserves to love _you_, Agnes. Some one of a nobler\ncharacter, and more worthy altogether than any one I have ever seen\nhere, must rise up, before I give _my_ consent. In the time to come, I\nshall have a wary eye on all admirers; and shall exact a great deal from\nthe successful one, I assure you.\"\n\nWe had gone on, so far, in a mixture of confidential jest and earnest,\nthat had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations, begun as\nmere children. But Agnes, now suddenly lifting up her eyes to mine, and\nspeaking in a different manner, said:\n\n\"Trotwood, there is something that I want to ask you, and that I may not\nhave another opportunity of asking for a long time, perhaps--something I\nwould ask, I think, of no one else. Have you observed any gradual\nalteration in Papa?\"\n\nI had observed it, and had often wondered whether she had too. I must\nhave shown as much, now, in my face; for her eyes were in a moment cast\ndown, and I saw tears in them.\n\n\"Tell me what it is,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n\"I think--shall I be quite plain, Agnes, liking him so much?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"I think he does himself no good by the habit that has increased upon\nhim since I first came here. He is often very nervous--or I fancy so.\"\n\n\"It is not fancy,\" said Agnes, shaking her head.\n\n\"His hand trembles, his speech is not plain, and his eyes look wild. I\nhave remarked that at those times, and when he is least like himself, he\nis most certain to be wanted on some business.\"\n\n\"By Uriah,\" said Agnes.\n\n\"Yes; and the sense of being unfit for it, or of not having understood\nit, or of having shown his condition in spite of himself, seems to make\nhim so uneasy, that next day he is worse, and next day worse, and so he\nbecomes jaded and haggard. Do not be alarmed by what I say, Agnes, but\nin this state I saw him, only the other evening, lay down his head upon\nhis desk, and shed tears like a child.\"\n\nHer hand passed softly before my lips while I was yet speaking, and in a\nmoment she had met her father at the door of the room, and was hanging\non his shoulder. The expression of her face, as they both looked towards\nme, I felt to be very touching. There was such deep fondness for him,\nand gratitude to him for all his love and care, in her beautiful look;\nand there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal tenderly by him, even\nin my inmost thoughts, and to let no harsh construction find any place\nagainst him; she was, at once, so proud of him and devoted to him, yet\nso compassionate and sorry, and so reliant upon me to be so, too; that\nnothing she could have said would have expressed more to me, or moved me\nmore.\n\nWe were to drink tea at the Doctor's. We went there at the usual hour;\nand round the study-fireside found the Doctor, and his young wife, and\nher mother. The Doctor, who made as much of my going away as if I were\ngoing to China, received me as an honored guest; and called for a log of\nwood to be thrown on the fire, that he might see the face of his old\npupil reddening in the blaze.\n\n\"I shall not see many more new faces in Trotwood's stead, Wickfield,\"\nsaid the Doctor, warming his hands; \"I am getting lazy, and want ease. I\nshall relinquish all my young people in another six months, and lead a\nquieter life.\"\n\n\"You have said so, any time these ten years, Doctor,\" Mr. Wickfield\nanswered.\n\n\"But now I mean to do it,\" returned the Doctor. \"My first master will\nsucceed me--I am in earnest at last--so you'll soon have to arrange our\ncontracts, and to bind us firmly to them, like a couple of knaves.\"\n\n\"And to take care,\" said Mr. Wickfield, \"that you're not imposed on,\neh?--as you certainly would be, in any contract you should make for\nyourself. Well! I am ready. There are worse tasks than that, in my\ncalling.\"\n\n\"I shall have nothing to think of then,\" said the Doctor, with a smile,\n\"but my Dictionary; and this other contract-bargain--Annie.\"\n\nAs Mr. Wickfield glanced towards her, sitting at the tea-table by Agnes,\nshe seemed to me to avoid his look with such unwonted hesitation and\ntimidity, that his attention became fixed upon her, as if something were\nsuggested to his thoughts.\n\n\"There is a post come in from India, I observe,\" he said, after a short\nsilence.\n\n\"By-the-by! and letters from Mr. Jack Maldon!\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Poor dear Jack!\" said Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head. \"That trying\nclimate!--like living, they tell me, on a sand-heap, underneath a\nburning-glass! He looked strong, but he wasn't. My dear Doctor, it was\nhis spirit, not his constitution, that he ventured on so boldly. Annie,\nmy dear, I am sure you must perfectly recollect that your cousin never\nwas strong--not what can be called _robust_, you know,\" said Mrs.\nMarkleham, with emphasis, and looking round upon us generally \"--from\nthe time when my daughter and himself were children together, and\nwalking about, arm in arm, the livelong day.\"\n\nAnnie, thus addressed, made no reply.\n\n\"Do I gather from what you say, ma'am, that Mr. Maldon is ill?\" asked\nMr. Wickfield.\n\n\"Ill!\" replied the Old Soldier. \"My dear sir, he is all sorts of\nthings.\"\n\n\"Except well?\" said Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"Except well, indeed!\" said the Old Soldier. \"He has had dreadful\nstrokes of the sun, no doubt, and jungle fevers and agues, and every\nkind of thing you can mention. As to his liver,\" said the Old Soldier\nresignedly, \"that, of course, he gave up altogether, when he first went\nout!\"\n\n\"Does he say all this?\" asked Mr. Wickfield.\n\n\"Say? My dear sir,\" returned Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head and her\nfan, \"you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you ask that question.\nSay? Not he. You might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first.\"\n\n\"Mama!\" said Mrs. Strong.\n\n\"Annie, my dear,\" returned her mother, \"once for all, I must really beg\nthat you will not interfere with me, unless it is to confirm what I say.\nYou know as well as I do, that your cousin Maldon would be dragged at\nthe heels of any number of wild horses--why should I confine myself to\nfour! I _won't_ confine myself to four--eight, sixteen, two-and-thirty,\nrather than say anything calculated to overturn the Doctor's plans.\"\n\n\"Wickfield's plans,\" said the Doctor, stroking his face, and looking\npenitently at his adviser. \"That is to say, our joint plans for him. I\nsaid myself, abroad or at home.\"\n\n\"And I said,\" added Mr. Wickfield gravely, \"abroad. I was the means of\nsending him abroad. It's my responsibility.\"\n\n\"Oh! Responsibility!\" said the Old Soldier. \"Every thing was done for\nthe best, my dear Mr. Wickfield; every thing was done for the kindest\nand best, we know. But if the dear fellow can't live there, he can't\nlive there. And if he can't live there, he'll die there, sooner than\nhe'll overturn the Doctor's plans. I know him,\" said the Old Soldier,\nfanning herself, in a sort of calm prophetic agony, \"and I know he'll\ndie there, sooner than he'll overturn the Doctor's plans.\"\n\n\"Well, well, ma'am,\" said the Doctor, cheerfully, \"I am not bigoted to\nmy plans, and I can overturn them myself. I can substitute some other\nplans. If Mr. Jack Maldon comes home on account of ill health, he must\nnot be allowed to go back, and we must endeavour to make some more\nsuitable and fortunate provision for him in this country.\"\n\nMrs. Markleham was so overcome by this generous speech--which, I need\nnot say, she had not at all expected or led up to--that she could only\ntell the Doctor it was like himself, and go several times through that\noperation of kissing the sticks of her fan, and then tapping his hand\nwith it. After which she gently chid her daughter Annie, for not being\nmore demonstrative when such kindnesses were showered, for her sake, on\nher old playfellow; and entertained us with some particulars concerning\nother deserving members of her family, whom it was desirable to set on\ntheir deserving legs.\n\nAll this time, her daughter Annie never once spoke, or lifted up her\neyes. All this time, Mr. Wickfield had his glance upon her as she sat by\nhis own daughter's side. It appeared to me that he never thought of\nbeing observed by any one; but was so intent upon her, and upon his own\nthoughts in connexion with her, as to be quite absorbed. He now asked\nwhat Mr. Jack Maldon had actually written in reference to himself, and\nto whom he had written it?\n\n\"Why, here,\" said Mrs. Markleham, taking a letter from the\nchimney-piece above the Doctor's head, \"the dear fellow says to the\nDoctor himself--where is it? Oh!--'I am sorry to inform you that\nmy health is suffering severely, and that I fear I may be reduced\nto the necessity of returning home for a time, as the only hope of\nrestoration.' That's pretty plain, poor fellow! His only hope of\nrestoration! But Annie's letter is plainer still. Annie, show me that\nletter again.\"\n\n\"Not now, mama,\" she pleaded in a low tone.\n\n\"My dear, you absolutely are, on some subjects, one of the most\nridiculous persons in the world,\" returned her mother, \"and perhaps the\nmost unnatural to the claims of your own family. We never should have\nheard of the letter at all, I believe, unless I had asked for it myself.\nDo you call that confidence, my love, towards Doctor Strong? I am\nsurprised. You ought to know better.\"\n\nThe letter was reluctantly produced; and as I handed it to the old lady,\nI saw how the unwilling hand from which I took it, trembled.\n\n\"Now let us see,\" said Mrs. Markleham, putting her glass to her eye,\n\"where the passage is. 'The remembrance of old times, my dearest\nAnnie'--and so forth--it's not there. 'The amiable old Proctor'--who's\nhe? Dear me, Annie, how illegibly your cousin Maldon writes, and how\nstupid I am! 'Doctor,' of course. Ah! amiable indeed!\" Here she left\noff, to kiss her fan again, and shake it at the Doctor, who was looking\nat us in a state of placid satisfaction. \"Now I have found it. '_You_\nmay not be surprised to hear, Annie'--no, to be sure, knowing that he\nnever was really strong; what did I say just now?--'that I have\nundergone so much in this distant place, as to have decided to leave it\nat all hazards; on sick leave, if I can; on total resignation, if that\nis not to be obtained. What I have endured, and do endure here, is\ninsupportable.' And but for the promptitude of that best of creatures,\"\nsaid Mrs. Markleham, telegraphing the Doctor as before, and refolding\nthe letter, \"it would be insupportable to me to think of.\"\n\nMr. Wickfield said not one word, though the old lady looked to him as if\nfor his commentary on this intelligence; but sat severely silent, with\nhis eyes fixed on the ground. Long after the subject was dismissed, and\nother topics occupied us, he remained so; seldom raising his eyes,\nunless to rest them for a moment, with a thoughtful frown, upon the\nDoctor, or his wife, or both.\n\nThe Doctor was very fond of music. Agnes sang with great sweetness and\nexpression, and so did Mrs. Strong. They sang together, and played duets\ntogether, and we had quite a little concert. But I remarked two things:\nfirst, that though Annie soon recovered her composure, and was quite\nherself, there was a blank between her and Mr. Wickfield which separated\nthem wholly from each other; secondly, that Mr. Wickfield seemed to\ndislike the intimacy between her and Agnes, and to watch it with\nuneasiness. And now, I must confess, the recollection of what I had seen\non that night when Mr. Maldon went away, first began to return upon me\nwith a meaning it had never had, and to trouble me. The innocent beauty\nof her face was not as innocent to me as it had been; I mistrusted the\nnatural grace and charm of her manner; and when I looked at Agnes by her\nside, and thought how good and true Agnes was, suspicions arose within\nme that it was an ill-assorted friendship.\n\nShe was so happy in it herself, however, and the other was so happy too,\nthat they made the evening fly away as if it were but an hour. It closed\nin an incident which I well remember. They were taking leave of each\nother, and Agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her, when Mr.\nWickfield stepped between them, as if by accident, and drew Agnes\nquickly away. Then I saw, as though all the intervening time had been\ncancelled, and I were still standing in the doorway on the night of the\ndeparture, the expression of that night in the face of Mrs. Strong, as\nit confronted his.\n\nI cannot say what an impression this made upon me, or how impossible I\nfound it, when I thought of her afterwards, to separate her from this\nlook, and remember her face in its innocent loveliness again. It haunted\nme when I got home. I seemed to have left the Doctor's roof with a dark\ncloud lowering on it. The reverence that I had for his grey head, was\nmingled with commiseration for his faith in those who were treacherous\nto him, and with resentment against those who injured him. The impending\nshadow of a great affliction, and a great disgrace that had no distinct\nform in it yet, fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had\nworked and played as a boy, and did it a cruel wrong. I had no pleasure\nin thinking, any more, of the grave old broad-leaved aloe-trees which\nremained shut up in themselves a hundred years together, and of the trim\nsmooth grass-plot, and the stone urns, and the Doctor's walk, and the\ncongenial sound of the Cathedral bell hovering above them all. It was as\nif the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face,\nand its peace and honor given to the winds.\n\nBut morning brought with it my parting from the old house, which Agnes\nhad filled with her influence; and that occupied my mind sufficiently.\nI should be there again soon, no doubt; I might sleep again--perhaps\noften--in my old room; but the days of my inhabiting there were gone,\nand the old time was past. I was heavier at heart when I packed up such\nof my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to Dover,\nthan I cared to show to Uriah Heep: who was so officious to help me,\nthat I uncharitably thought him mighty glad that I was going.\n\nI got away from Agnes and her father, somehow, with an indifferent show\nof being very manly, and took my seat upon the box of the London coach.\nI was so softened and forgiving, going through the town, that I had half\na mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher, and throw him five shillings\nto drink. But he looked such a very obdurate butcher as he stood\nscraping the great block in the shop, and moreover, his appearance was\nso little improved by the loss of a front tooth which I had knocked out,\nthat I thought it best to make no advances.\n\nThe main object on my mind, I remember, when we got fairly on the road,\nwas to appear as old as possible to the coachman, and to speak extremely\ngruff. The latter point I achieved at great personal inconvenience; but\nI stuck to it, because I felt it was a grown-up sort of thing.\n\n\"You are going through, sir?\" said the coachman.\n\n\"Yes, William,\" I said, condescendingly (I knew him); \"I am going to\nLondon. I shall go down into Suffolk afterwards.\"\n\n\"Shooting, sir?\" said the coachman.\n\nHe knew as well as I did that it was just as likely, at that time of\nyear, I was going down there whaling; but I felt complimented, too.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said, pretending to be undecided, \"whether I shall\ntake a shot or not.\"\n\n\"Birds is got wery shy, I'm told,\" said William.\n\n\"So I understand,\" said I.\n\n\"Is Suffolk your county, sir?\" asked William.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, with some importance, \"Suffolk's my county.\"\n\n\"I'm told the dumplings is uncommon fine down there,\" said William.\n\nI was not aware of it myself, but I felt it necessary to uphold the\ninstitutions of my county, and to evince a familiarity with them; so I\nshook my head, as much as to say \"I believe you!\"\n\n\"And the Punches,\" said William. \"There's cattle! A Suffolk Punch, when\nhe's a good un, is worth his weight in gold. Did you ever breed any\nSuffolk Punches yourself, sir?\"\n\n\"N--no,\" I said, \"not exactly.\"\n\n\"Here's a gen'lm'n behind me, I'll pound it,\" said William, \"as has bred\n'em by wholesale.\"\n\nThe gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint,\nand a prominent chin, who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat\nbrim, and whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way\nup outside his legs from his boots to his hips. His chin was cocked over\nthe coachman's shoulder, so near to me, that his breath quite tickled\nthe back of my head; and as I looked round at him, he leered at the\nleaders with the eye with which he didn't squint, in a very knowing\nmanner.\n\n\"Ain't you?\" said William.\n\n\"Ain't I what?\" asked the gentleman behind.\n\n\"Bred them Suffolk Punches by wholesale?\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" said the gentleman. \"There ain't no sort of\norse that I ain't bred, and no sort of dorg. Orses and dorgs is some\nmen's fancy. They're wittles and drink to me--lodging, wife, and\nchildren--reading, writing, and 'rithmetic--snuff, tobacker, and sleep.\"\n\n\"That ain't a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box, is it\nthough?\" said William in my ear, as he handled the reins.\n\nI construed this remark into an indication of a wish that he should have\nmy place, so I blushingly offered to resign it.\n\n\"Well, if you don't mind, sir,\" said William, \"I think it _would_ be\nmore correct.\"\n\nI have always considered this as the first fall I had in life. When I\nbooked my place at the coach-office, I had had \"Box Seat\" written\nagainst the entry, and had given the book-keeper half-a-crown. I was got\nup in a special great coat and shawl, expressly to do honor to that\ndistinguished eminence; had glorified myself upon it a good deal; and\nhad felt that I was a credit to the coach. And here, in the very first\nstage, I was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint, who had no other\nmerit than smelling like a livery-stables, and being able to walk across\nme, more like a fly than a human being, while the horses were at a\ncanter!\n\n  [Illustration: My first fall in life.]\n\nA distrust of myself, which has often beset me in life on small\noccasions, when it would have been better away, was assuredly not\nstopped in its growth by this little incident outside the Canterbury\ncoach. It was in vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech. I spoke\nfrom the pit of my stomach for the rest of the journey, but I felt\ncompletely extinguished, and dreadfully young.\n\nIt was curious and interesting, nevertheless, to be sitting up there,\nbehind four horses: well educated, well dressed, and with plenty of\nmoney in my pocket: and to look out for the places where I had slept on\nmy weary journey. I had abundant occupation for my thoughts, in every\nconspicuous landmark on the road. When I looked down at the trampers\nwhom we passed, and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up, I\nfelt as if the tinker's blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt\nagain. When we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham, and I\ncaught a glimpse, in passing, of the lane where the old monster lived\nwho had bought my jacket, I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the\nplace where I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my\nmoney. When we came, at last, within a stage of London, and passed the\nveritable Salem House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy\nhand, I would have given all I had, for lawful permission to get down\nand thrash him, and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows.\n\nWe went to the Golden Cross at Charing Cross, then a mouldy sort of\nestablishment in a close neighbourhood. A waiter showed me into the\ncoffee-room; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber,\nwhich smelt like a hackney-coach, and was shut up like a family vault. I\nwas still painfully conscious of my youth, for nobody stood in any awe\nof me at all: the chambermaid being utterly indifferent to my opinions\non any subject, and the waiter being familiar with me, and offering\nadvice to my inexperience.\n\n\"Well now,\" said the waiter, in a tone of confidence, \"what would you\nlike for dinner? Young gentlemen likes poultry in general, have a fowl!\"\n\nI told him, as majestically as I could, that I wasn't in the humour for\na fowl.\n\n\"Ain't you!\" said the waiter. \"Young gentlemen is generally tired of\nbeef and mutton, have a weal cutlet!\"\n\nI assented to this proposal, in default of being able to suggest\nanything else.\n\n\"Do you care for taters?\" said the waiter, with an insinuating smile,\nand his head on one side. \"Young gentlemen generally has been overdosed\nwith taters.\"\n\nI commanded him, in my deepest voice, to order a veal cutlet and\npotatoes, and all things fitting; and to inquire at the bar if there\nwere any letters for Trotwood Copperfield, Esquire--which I knew there\nwere not, and couldn't be, but thought it manly to appear to expect.\n\nHe soon came back to say that there were none (at which I was much\nsurprised), and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the\nfire. While he was so engaged, he asked me what I would take with it;\nand on my replying \"Half a pint of sherry,\" thought it a favourable\nopportunity, I am afraid, to extract that measure of wine from the stale\nleavings at the bottoms of several small decanters. I am of this\nopinion, because, while I was reading the newspaper, I observed him\nbehind a low wooden partition, which was his private apartment, very\nbusy pouring out of a number of those vessels into one, like a chemist\nand druggist making up a prescription. When the wine came, too, I\nthought it flat; and it certainly had more English crumbs in it, than\nwere to be expected in a foreign wine in anything like a pure state; but\nI was bashful enough to drink it, and say nothing.\n\nBeing, then, in a pleasant frame of mind (from which I infer that\npoisoning is not always disagreeable in some stages of the process), I\nresolved to go to the play. It was Covent Garden Theatre that I chose;\nand there, from the back of a centre box, I saw Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar and the\nnew Pantomime. To have all those noble Romans alive before me, and\nwalking in and out for my entertainment, instead of being the stern\ntaskmasters they had been at school, was a most novel and delightful\neffect. But the mingled reality and mystery of the whole show, the\ninfluence upon me of the poetry, the lights, the music, the company,\nthe smooth stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery, were\nso dazzling, and opened up such illimitable regions of delight, that\nwhen I came out into the rainy street, at twelve o'clock at night,\nI felt as if I had come from the clouds, where I had been leading\na romantic life for ages, to a bawling, splashing, link-lighted,\numbrella-struggling, hackney-coach-jostling, patten-clinking, muddy,\nmiserable world.\n\nI had emerged by another door, and stood in the street for a little\nwhile, as if I really were a stranger upon earth: but the unceremonious\npushing and hustling that I received, soon recalled me to myself, and\nput me in the road back to the hotel; whither I went, revolving the\nglorious vision all the way; and where, after some porter and oysters,\nI sat revolving it still, at past one o'clock, with my eyes on the\ncoffee-room fire.\n\nI was so filled with the play, and with the past--for it was, in a\nmanner, like a shining transparency, through which I saw my earlier\nlife moving along--that I don't know when the figure of a handsome\nwell-formed young man, dressed with a tasteful easy negligence which\nI have reason to remember very well, became a real presence to me. But\nI recollect being conscious of his company without having noticed his\ncoming in--and my still sitting, musing, over the coffee-room fire.\n\nAt last I rose to go to bed, much to the relief of the sleepy waiter,\nwho had got the fidgets in his legs, and was twisting them, and hitting\nthem, and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small\npantry. In going towards the door, I passed the person who had come in,\nand saw him plainly. I turned directly, came back, and looked again. He\ndid not know me, but I knew him in a moment.\n\nAt another time I might have wanted the confidence or the decision to\nspeak to him, and might have put it off until next day, and might have\nlost him. But, in the then condition of my mind, where the play was\nstill running high, his former protection of me appeared so deserving of\nmy gratitude, and my old love for him overflowed my breast so freshly\nand spontaneously, that I went up to him at once, with a fast-beating\nheart, and said:\n\n\"Steerforth! won't you speak to me?\"\n\nHe looked at me--just as he used to look, sometimes--but I saw no\nrecognition in his face.\n\n\"You don't remember me, I am afraid,\" said I.\n\n\"My God!\" he suddenly exclaimed. \"It's little Copperfield!\"\n\nI grasped him by both hands, and could not let them go. But for very\nshame, and the fear that it might displease him, I could have held him\nround the neck and cried.\n\n\"I never, never, never was so glad! My dear Steerforth, I am so\noverjoyed to see you!\"\n\n\"And I am rejoiced to see you, too!\" he said, shaking my hands heartily.\n\"Why, Copperfield, old boy, don't be overpowered!\" And yet he was glad,\ntoo, I thought, to see how the delight I had in meeting him affected me.\n\nI brushed away the tears that my utmost resolution had not been able to\nkeep back, and I made a clumsy laugh of it, and we sat down together,\nside by side.\n\n\"Why, how do you come to be here?\" said Steerforth, clapping me on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"I came here by the Canterbury coach, to-day. I have been adopted by an\naunt down in that part of the country, and have just finished my\neducation there. How do _you_ come to be here, Steerforth?\"\n\n\"Well, I am what they call an Oxford man,\" he returned; \"that is to say,\nI get bored to death down there, periodically--and I am on my way now to\nmy mother's. You're a devilish amiable-looking fellow, Copperfield. Just\nwhat you used to be, now I look at you! Not altered in the least!\"\n\n\"I knew _you_ immediately,\" I said; \"but you are more easily\nremembered.\"\n\nHe laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair,\nand said gaily:\n\n\"Yes, I am on an expedition of duty. My mother lives a little way out of\ntown; and the roads being in a beastly condition, and our house tedious\nenough, I remained here to-night instead of going on. I have not been in\ntown half-a-dozen hours, and those I have been dozing and grumbling away\nat the play.\"\n\n\"I have been at the play, too,\" said I. \"At Covent Garden. What a\ndelightful and magnificent entertainment, Steerforth!\"\n\nSteerforth laughed heartily.\n\n--\"My dear young Davy,\" he said, clapping me on the shoulder again, \"you\nare a very Daisy. The daisy of the field, at sunrise, is not fresher\nthan you are! I have been at Covent Garden, too, and there never was a\nmore miserable business.--Holloa, you sir!\"\n\nThis was addressed to the waiter, who had been very attentive to our\nrecognition, at a distance, and now came forward deferentially.\n\n\"Where have you put my friend, Mr. Copperfield?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Beg your pardon, sir?\"\n\n\"Where does he sleep? What's his number? You know what I mean,\" said\nSteerforth.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the waiter, with an apologetic air. \"Mr. Copperfield\nis at present in forty-four, sir.\"\n\n\"And what the devil do you mean,\" retorted Steerforth, \"by putting Mr.\nCopperfield into a little loft over a stable?\"\n\n\"Why, you see we wasn't aware, sir,\" returned the waiter, still\napologetically, \"as Mr. Copperfield was anyways particular. We can give\nMr. Copperfield seventy-two, sir, if it would be preferred. Next you,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Of course it would be preferred,\" said Steerforth. \"And do it at once.\"\n\nThe waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange. Steerforth, very\nmuch amused at my having been put into forty-four, laughed again, and\nclapped me on the shoulder again, and invited me to breakfast with him\nnext morning at ten o'clock--an invitation I was only too proud and\nhappy to accept. It being now pretty late, we took our candles and went\nup-stairs, where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door, and\nwhere I found my new room a great improvement on my old one, it not\nbeing at all musty, and having an immense four-post bedstead in it,\nwhich was quite a little landed estate. Here, among pillows enough for\nsix, I soon fell asleep in a blissful condition, and dreamed of ancient\nRome, Steerforth, and friendship, until the early morning coaches,\nrumbling out of the archway underneath, made me dream of thunder and the\ngods.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nSTEERFORTH'S HOME.\n\n\nWhen the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o'clock, and informed me\nthat my shaving-water was outside, I felt severely the having no\noccasion for it, and blushed in my bed. The suspicion that she laughed\ntoo, when she said it, preyed upon my mind all the time I was dressing;\nand gave me, I was conscious, a sneaking and guilty air when I passed\nher on the staircase, as I was going down to breakfast. I was so\nsensitively aware, indeed, of being younger than I could have wished,\nthat for some time I could not make up my mind to pass her at all, under\nthe ignoble circumstances of the case; but, hearing her there with a\nbroom, stood peeping out of window at King Charles on horseback,\nsurrounded by a maze of hackney-coaches and looking anything but regal\nin a drizzling rain and a dark-brown fog, until I was admonished by the\nwaiter that the gentleman was waiting for me.\n\nIt was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting me, but\nin a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where\nthe fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table\ncovered with a clean cloth; and a cheerful miniature of the room, the\nfire, the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little\nround mirror over the sideboard. I was rather bashful at first,\nSteerforth being so self-possessed, and elegant, and superior to me in\nall respects (age included); but his easy patronage soon put that to\nrights, and made me quite at home. I could not enough admire the change\nhe had wrought in the Golden Cross; or compare the dull forlorn state I\nhad held yesterday, with this morning's comfort and this morning's\nentertainment. As to the waiter's familiarity, it was quenched as if it\nhad never been. He attended on us, as I may say, in sackcloth and ashes.\n\n\"Now, Copperfield,\" said Steerforth, when we were alone, \"I should like\nto hear what you are doing, and where you are going, and all about you.\nI feel as if you were my property.\"\n\nGlowing with pleasure to find that he had still this interest in me, I\ntold him how my aunt had proposed the little expedition that I had\nbefore me, and whither it tended.\n\n\"As you are in no hurry, then,\" said Steerforth, \"come home with me to\nHighgate, and stay a day or two. You will be pleased with my mother--she\nis a little vain and prosy about me, but that you can forgive her--and\nshe will be pleased with you.\"\n\n\"I should like to be as sure of that, as you are kind enough to say you\nare,\" I answered, smiling.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Steerforth, \"every one who likes me, has a claim on her that\nis sure to be acknowledged.\"\n\n\"Then I think I shall be a favorite,\" said I.\n\n\"Good!\" said Steerforth. \"Come and prove it. We will go and see the\nlions for an hour or two--it's something to have a fresh fellow like you\nto show them to, Copperfield--and then we'll journey out to Highgate by\nthe coach.\"\n\nI could hardly believe but that I was in a dream, and that I should wake\npresently in number forty-four, to the solitary box in the coffee-room\nand the familiar waiter again. After I had written to my aunt and told\nher of my fortunate meeting with my admired old schoolfellow, and my\nacceptance of his invitation, we went out in a hackney-chariot, and saw\na Panorama and some other sights, and took a walk through the Museum,\nwhere I could not help observing how much Steerforth knew, on an\ninfinite variety of subjects, and of how little account he seemed to\nmake his knowledge.\n\n\"You'll take a high degree at college, Steerforth,\" said I, \"if you have\nnot done so already; and they will have good reason to be proud of you.\"\n\n\"_I_ take a degree!\" cried Steerforth. \"Not I! my dear Daisy--will you\nmind my calling you Daisy?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\n\n\"That's a good fellow! My dear Daisy,\" said Steerforth, laughing, \"I\nhave not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that\nway. I have done quite sufficient for my purpose. I find that I am heavy\ncompany enough for myself, as I am.\"\n\n\"But the fame----\" I was beginning.\n\n\"You romantic Daisy!\" said Steerforth, laughing still more heartily;\n\"why should I trouble myself, that a parcel of heavy-headed fellows may\ngape and hold up their hands? Let them do it at some other man. There's\nfame for him, and he's welcome to it.\"\n\nI was abashed at having made so great a mistake, and was glad to change\nthe subject. Fortunately it was not difficult to do, for Steerforth\ncould always pass from one subject to another with a carelessness and\nlightness that were his own.\n\nLunch succeeded to our sight-seeing, and the short winter day wore away\nso fast, that it was dusk when the stage-coach stopped with us at an old\nbrick house at Highgate on the summit of the hill. An elderly lady,\nthough not very far advanced in years, with a proud carriage and a\nhandsome face, was in the doorway as we alighted; and greeting\nSteerforth as \"My dearest James,\" folded him in her arms. To this lady\nhe presented me as his mother, and she gave me a stately welcome.\n\nIt was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly. From the\nwindows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great\nvapour, with here and there some lights twinkling through it. I had only\ntime, in dressing, to glance at the solid furniture, the framed pieces\nof work (done, I supposed, by Steerforth's mother when she was a girl),\nand some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair and boddices,\ncoming and going on the walls, as the newly-kindled fire crackled and\nsputtered, when I was called to dinner.\n\nThere was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short figure,\ndark, and not agreeable to look at, but with some appearance of good\nlooks too, who attracted my attention: perhaps because I had not\nexpected to see her; perhaps because I found myself sitting opposite\nto her; perhaps because of something really remarkable in her. She had\nblack hair and eager black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon her\nlip. It was an old scar--I should rather call it, seam, for it was not\ndiscolored, and had healed years ago--which had once cut through her\nmouth, downward towards the chin, but was now barely visible across\nthe table, except above and on her upper lip, the shape of which it\nhad altered. I concluded in my own mind that she was about thirty\nyears of age, and that she wished to be married. She was a little\ndilapidated--like a house--with having been so long to let; yet had, as\nI have said, an appearance of good looks. Her thinness seemed to be the\neffect of some wasting fire within her, which found a vent in her gaunt\neyes.\n\nShe was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother\ncalled her Rosa. I found that she lived there, and had been for a long\ntime Mrs. Steerforth's companion. It appeared to me that she never said\nanything she wanted to say, outright; but hinted it, and made a great\ndeal more of it by this practice. For example, when Mrs. Steerforth\nobserved, more in jest than earnest, that she feared her son led but a\nwild life at college, Miss Dartle put in thus:\n\n\"Oh, really? You know how ignorant I am, and that I only ask for\ninformation, but isn't it always so? I thought that kind of life was on\nall hands understood to be--eh?\"\n\n\"It is education for a very grave profession, if you mean that, Rosa,\"\nMrs. Steerforth answered with some coldness.\n\n\"Oh! Yes! That's very true,\" returned Miss Dartle. \"But isn't it,\nthough?--I want to be put right if I am wrong--isn't it really?\"\n\n\"Really what?\" said Mrs. Steerforth.\n\n\"Oh! You mean it's _not_!\" returned Miss Dartle. \"Well, I'm very glad to\nhear it! Now, I know what to do. That's the advantage of asking. I shall\nnever allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy,\nand so forth, in connection with that life, any more.\"\n\n\"And you will be right,\" said Mrs. Steerforth. \"My son's tutor is a\nconscientious gentleman; and if I had not implicit reliance on my son, I\nshould have reliance on him.\"\n\n\"Should you?\" said Miss Dartle. \"Dear me! Conscientious, is he? Really\nconscientious, now?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am convinced of it,\" said Mrs. Steerforth.\n\n\"How very nice!\" exclaimed Miss Dartle. \"What a comfort! Really\nconscientious? Then he's not--but of course he can't be, if he's really\nconscientious. Well, I shall be quite happy in my opinion of him, from\nthis time. You can't think how it elevates him in my opinion, to know\nfor certain that he's really conscientious!\"\n\nHer own views of every question, and her correction of everything that\nwas said to which she was opposed, Miss Dartle insinuated in the same\nway: sometimes, I could not conceal from myself, with great power,\nthough in contradiction even of Steerforth. An instance happened before\ndinner was done. Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention of\ngoing down into Suffolk, I said at hazard how glad I should be, if\nSteerforth would only go there with me; and explaining to him that I was\ngoing to see my old nurse, and Mr. Peggotty's family, I reminded him of\nthe boatman whom he had seen at school.\n\n\"Oh! That bluff fellow!\" said Steerforth. \"He had a son with him, hadn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"No. That was his nephew,\" I replied; \"whom he adopted, though, as a\nson. He has a very pretty little niece too, whom he adopted as a\ndaughter. In short, his house (or rather his boat, for he lives in one,\non dry land) is full of people who are objects of his generosity and\nkindness. You would be delighted to see that household.\"\n\n\"Should I?\" said Steerforth. \"Well, I think I should. I must see what\ncan be done. It would be worth a journey--not to mention the pleasure of\na journey with you, Daisy,--to see that sort of people together, and to\nmake one of 'em.\"\n\nMy heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure. But it was in reference to\nthe tone in which he had spoken of \"that sort of people,\" that Miss\nDartle, whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us, now broke in\nagain.\n\n\"Oh, but, really? Do tell me. Are they, though?\" she said.\n\n\"Are they what? And are who what?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"That sort of people.--Are they really animals and clods, and beings of\nanother order? I want to know _so_ much.\"\n\n\"Why, there's a pretty wide separation between them and us,\" said\nSteerforth, with indifference. \"They are not to be expected to be as\nsensitive as we are. Their delicacy is not to be shocked, or hurt very\neasily. They are wonderfully virtuous, I dare say--some people contend\nfor that, at least; and I am sure I don't want to contradict them--but\nthey have not very fine natures, and they may be thankful that, like\ntheir coarse rough skins, they are not easily wounded.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Miss Dartle. \"Well, I don't know, now, when I have been\nbetter pleased than to hear that. It's so consoling! It's such a delight\nto know that, when they suffer, they don't feel! Sometimes I have been\nquite uneasy for that sort of people; but now I shall just dismiss the\nidea of them, altogether. Live and learn. I had my doubts, I confess,\nbut now they're cleared up. I didn't know, and now I do know; and that\nshows the advantage of asking--don't it?\"\n\nI believed that Steerforth had said what he had, in jest, or to draw\nMiss Dartle out; and I expected him to say as much when she was gone,\nand we two were sitting before the fire. But he merely asked me what I\nthought of her.\n\n\"She is very clever, is she not?\" I asked.\n\n\"Clever! She brings everything to a grindstone,\" said Steerforth, \"and\nsharpens it, as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years\npast. She has worn herself away by constant sharpening. She is all\nedge.\"\n\n\"What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip!\" I said.\n\nSteerforth's face fell, and he paused a moment.\n\n\"Why, the fact is,\" he returned, \"--_I_ did that.\"\n\n\"By an unfortunate accident!\"\n\n\"No. I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a hammer at\nher. A promising young angel I must have been!\"\n\nI was deeply sorry to have touched on such a painful theme, but that was\nuseless now.\n\n\"She has borne the mark ever since, as you see,\" said Steerforth; \"and\nshe'll bear it to her grave, if she ever rests in one--though I can\nhardly believe she will ever rest anywhere. She was the motherless child\nof a sort of cousin of my father's. He died one day. My mother, who was\nthen a widow, brought her here to be company to her. She has a couple of\nthousand pounds of her own, and saves the interest of it every year, to\nadd to the principal. There's the history of Miss Rosa Dartle for you.\"\n\n\"And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?\" said I.\n\n\"Humph!\" retorted Steerforth, looking at the fire. \"Some brothers are\nnot loved over much; and some love--but help yourself, Copperfield!\nWe'll drink the daisies of the field, in compliment to you; and the\nlilies of the valley that toil not, neither do they spin, in compliment\nto me--the more shame for me!\" A moody smile that had overspread his\nfeatures cleared off as he said this merrily, and he was his own frank,\nwinning self again.\n\nI could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest when we\nwent in to tea. It was not long before I observed that it was the most\nsusceptible part of her face, and that, when she turned pale, that mark\naltered first, and became a dull, lead-colored streak, lengthening out\nto its full extent, like a mark in invisible ink brought to the fire.\nThere was a little altercation between her and Steerforth about a cast\nof the dice at backgammon--when I thought her, for one moment, in a\nstorm of rage; and then I saw it start forth like the old writing on the\nwall.\n\nIt was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to\nher son. She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else.\nShe showed me his picture as an infant, in a locket, with some of his\nbaby-hair in it; she showed me his picture as he had been when I first\nknew him; and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now. All\nthe letters he had ever written to her, she kept in a cabinet near her\nown chair by the fire; and she would have read me some of them, and I\nshould have been very glad to hear them too, if he had not interposed,\nand coaxed her out of the design.\n\n\"It was at Mr. Creakle's, my son tells me, that you first became\nacquainted,\" said Mrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at one\ntable, while they played backgammon at another. \"Indeed, I recollect his\nspeaking, at that time, of a pupil younger than himself who had taken\nhis fancy there; but your name, as you may suppose, has not lived in my\nmemory.\"\n\n\"He was very generous and noble to me in those days, I assure you,\nma'am,\" said I, \"and I stood in need of such a friend. I should have\nbeen quite crushed without him.\"\n\n\"He is always generous and noble,\" said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly.\n\nI subscribed to this with all my heart, God knows. She knew I did; for\nthe stateliness of her manner already abated towards me, except when she\nspoke in praise of him, and then her air was always lofty.\n\n\"It was not a fit school generally for my son,\" said she; \"far from it;\nbut there were particular circumstances to be considered at the time, of\nmore importance even than that selection. My son's high spirit made it\ndesirable that he should be placed with some man who felt its\nsuperiority, and would be content to bow himself before it; and we found\nsuch a man there.\"\n\nI knew that, knowing the fellow. And yet I did not despise him the more\nfor it, but thought it a redeeming quality in him--if he could be\nallowed any grace for not resisting one so irresistible as Steerforth.\n\n\"My son's great capacity was tempted on, there, by a feeling of\nvoluntary emulation and conscious pride,\" the fond lady went on to say.\n\"He would have risen against all constraint; but he found himself the\nmonarch of the place, and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his\nstation. It was like himself.\"\n\nI echoed, with all my heart and soul, that it was like himself.\n\n\"So my son took, of his own will, and on no compulsion, to the course in\nwhich he can always, when it is his pleasure, outstrip every\ncompetitor,\" she pursued. \"My son informs me, Mr. Copperfield, that you\nwere quite devoted to him, and that when you met yesterday you made\nyourself known to him with tears of joy. I should be an affected woman\nif I made any pretence of being surprised by my son's inspiring such\nemotions; but I cannot be indifferent to any one who is so sensible of\nhis merit, and I am very glad to see you here, and can assure you that\nhe feels an unusual friendship for you, and that you may rely on his\nprotection.\"\n\nMiss Dartle played backgammon as eagerly as she did everything else. If\nI had seen her, first, at the board, I should have fancied that her\nfigure had got thin, and her eyes had got large, over that pursuit, and\nno other in the world. But I am very much mistaken if she missed a word\nof this, or lost a look of mine as I received it with the utmost\npleasure, and, honored by Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, felt older than\nI had done since I left Canterbury.\n\nWhen the evening was pretty far spent, and a tray of glasses and\ndecanters came in, Steerforth promised, over the fire, that he would\nseriously think of going down into the country with me. There was no\nhurry, he said; a week hence would do; and his mother hospitably said\nthe same. While we were talking, he more than once called me Daisy;\nwhich brought Miss Dartle out again.\n\n\"But really, Mr. Copperfield,\" she asked, \"is it a nick-name? And why\ndoes he give it you? Is it--eh?--because he thinks you young and\ninnocent? I am so stupid in these things.\"\n\nI colored in replying that I believed it was.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Miss Dartle. \"Now I am glad to know that! I ask for\ninformation, and I am glad to know it. He thinks you young and innocent;\nand so you are his friend. Well, that's quite delightful!\"\n\nShe went to bed soon after this, and Mrs. Steerforth retired too.\nSteerforth and I, after lingering for half an hour over the fire,\ntalking about Traddles and all the rest of them at old Salem House, went\nup-stairs together. Steerforth's room was next to mine, and I went in to\nlook at it. It was a picture of comfort, full of easy chairs, cushions\nand footstools, worked by his mother's hand, and with no sort of thing\nomitted that could help to render it complete. Finally, her handsome\nfeatures looked down on her darling from a portrait on the wall, as if\nit were even something to her that her likeness should watch him while\nhe slept.\n\nI found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time, and the\ncurtains drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a very\nsnug appearance. I sat down in a great chair upon the hearth to meditate\non my happiness; and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some time,\nwhen I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking eagerly at me from above\nthe chimney-piece.\n\nIt was a startling likeness, and necessarily had a startling look. The\npainter hadn't made the scar, but _I_ made it; and there it was, coming\nand going: now confined to the upper lip as I had seen it at dinner, and\nnow showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer, as I\nhad seen it when she was passionate.\n\nI wondered peevishly why they couldn't put her anywhere else instead of\nquartering her on me. To get rid of her, I undressed quickly,\nextinguished my light, and went to bed. But, as I fell asleep, I could\nnot forget that she was still there looking, \"Is it really, though? I\nwant to know;\" and when I awoke in the night, I found that I was\nuneasily asking all sorts of people in my dreams whether it really was\nor not--without knowing what I meant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nLITTLE EM'LY.\n\n\nThere was a servant in that house, a man who, I understood, was usually\nwith Steerforth, and had come into his service at the University, who\nwas in appearance a pattern of respectability. I believe there never\nexisted in his station a more respectable-looking man. He was taciturn,\nsoft-footed, very quiet in his manner, deferential, observant, always at\nhand when wanted, and never near when not wanted; but his great claim to\nconsideration was his respectability. He had not a pliant face, he had\nrather a stiff neck, rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging\nto it at the sides, a soft way of speaking, with a peculiar habit of\nwhispering the letter S so distinctly, that he seemed to use it oftener\nthan any other man; but every peculiarity that he had he made\nrespectable. If his nose had been upside-down, he would have made that\nrespectable. He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability,\nand walked secure in it. It would have been next to impossible to\nsuspect him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable. Nobody\ncould have thought of putting him in a livery, he was so highly\nrespectable. To have imposed any derogatory work upon him, would have\nbeen to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable\nman. And of this, I noticed the women-servants in the household were so\nintuitively conscious, that they always did such work themselves, and\ngenerally while he read the paper by the pantry fire.\n\nSuch a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as in every\nother he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable. Even the\nfact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his\nrespectability. Nothing could be objected against his surname Littimer,\nby which he was known. Peter might have been hanged, or Tom transported;\nbut Littimer was perfectly respectable.\n\nIt was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability\nin the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence.\nHow old he was himself I could not guess--and that again went to his\ncredit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might\nhave numbered fifty years as well as thirty.\n\nLittimer was in my room in the morning before I was up, to bring me that\nreproachful shaving-water, and to put out my clothes. When I undrew the\ncurtains and looked out of bed, I saw him, in an equable temperature of\nrespectability, unaffected by the east wind of January, and not even\nbreathing frostily, standing my boots right and left in the first\ndancing position, and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it\ndown like a baby.\n\nI gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was. He took out\nof his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and\npreventing the spring with his thumb from opening far, looked in at the\nface as if he were consulting an oracular oyster, shut it up again, and\nsaid, if I pleased, it was halfpast eight.\n\n\"Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said I, \"very well indeed. Is Mr. Steerforth quite well?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, Mr. Steerforth is tolerably well.\" Another of his\ncharacteristics,--no use of superlatives. A cool calm medium always.\n\n\"Is there anything more I can have the honor of doing for you, sir? The\nwarning-bell will ring at nine; the family take breakfast at halfpast\nnine.\"\n\n\"Nothing, I thank you.\"\n\n\"I thank _you_, sir, if you please;\" and with that, and with a little\ninclination of his head when he passed the bedside, as an apology for\ncorrecting me, he went out, shutting the door as delicately as if I had\njust fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depended.\n\nEvery morning we held exactly this conversation: never any more, and\nnever any less: and yet, invariably, however far I might have been\nlifted out of myself over-night, and advanced towards maturer years, by\nSteerforth's companionship, or Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, or Miss\nDartle's conversation, in the presence of this most respectable man I\nbecame, as our smaller poets sing, \"a boy again.\"\n\nHe got horses for us; and Steerforth, who knew every thing, gave me\nlessons in riding. He provided foils for us, and Steerforth gave me\nlessons in fencing--gloves, and I began, of the same master, to improve\nin boxing. It gave me no manner of concern that Steerforth should find\nme a novice in these sciences, but I never could bear to show my want of\nskill before the respectable Littimer. I had no reason to believe that\nLittimer understood such arts himself; he never led me to suppose\nanything of the kind, by so much as the vibration of one of his\nrespectable eyelashes; yet whenever he was by, while we were practising,\nI felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals.\n\nI am particular about this man, because he made a particular effect on\nme at that time, and because of what took place thereafter.\n\nThe week passed away in a most delightful manner. It passed rapidly, as\nmay be supposed, to one entranced as I was; and yet it gave me so many\noccasions for knowing Steerforth better, and admiring him more in a\nthousand respects, that at its close I seemed to have been with him for\na much longer time. A dashing way he had of treating me like a\nplaything, was more agreeable to me than any behaviour he could have\nadopted. It reminded me of our old acquaintance; it seemed the natural\nsequel of it; it showed me that he was unchanged; it relieved me of any\nuneasiness I might have felt, in comparing my merits with his, and\nmeasuring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard; above\nall, it was a familiar, unrestrained, affectionate demeanor that he used\ntowards no one else. As he had treated me at school differently from all\nthe rest, I joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike any\nother friend he had. I believed that I was nearer to his heart than any\nother friend, and my own heart warmed with attachment to him.\n\nHe made up his mind to go with me into the country, and the day arrived\nfor our departure. He had been doubtful at first whether to take\nLittimer or not, but decided to leave him at home. The respectable\ncreature, satisfied with his lot whatever it was, arranged our\nportmanteaus on the little carriage that was to take us into London, as\nif they were intended to defy the shocks of ages; and received my\nmodestly proffered donation with perfect tranquillity.\n\nWe bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, with many thanks on my\npart, and much kindness on the devoted mother's. The last thing I saw\nwas Littimer's unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent\nconviction that I was very young indeed.\n\nWhat I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places, I\nshall not endeavour to describe. We went down by the Mail. I was so\nconcerned, I recollect, even for the honor of Yarmouth, that when\nSteerforth said, as we drove through its dark streets to the inn, that,\nas well as he could make out, it was a good, queer, out-of-the-way kind\nof hole, I was highly pleased. We went to bed on our arrival (I observed\na pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the\nDolphin as we passed that door), and breakfasted late in the morning.\nSteerforth, who was in great spirits, had been strolling about the beach\nbefore I was up, and had made acquaintance, he said, with half the\nboatmen in the place. Moreover he had seen, in the distance, what he was\nsure must be the identical house of Mr. Peggotty, with smoke coming out\nof the chimney; and had had a great mind, he told me, to walk in and\nswear he was myself grown out of knowledge.\n\n\"When do you propose to introduce me there, Daisy?\" he said. \"I am at\nyour disposal. Make your own arrangements.\"\n\n\"Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, Steerforth,\nwhen they are all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it\nwhen it's snug, it's such a curious place.\"\n\n\"So be it!\" returned Steerforth. \"This evening.\"\n\n\"I shall not give them any notice that we are here, you know,\" said I,\ndelighted. \"We must take them by surprise.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course! It's no fun,\" said Steerforth, \"unless we take them by\nsurprise. Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition.\"\n\n\"Though they _are_ that sort of people that you mentioned,\" I returned.\n\n\"Aha! What! you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?\" he exclaimed\nwith a quick look. \"Confound the girl, I am half afraid of her. She's\nlike a goblin to me. But never mind her. Now what are you going to do?\nYou are going to see your nurse, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" I said, \"I must see Peggotty first of all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Steerforth, looking at his watch. \"Suppose I deliver you\nup to be cried over for a couple of hours. Is that long enough?\"\n\nI answered, laughing, that I thought we might get through it in that\ntime, but that he must come also; for he would find that his renown had\npreceded him, and that he was almost as great a personage as I was.\n\n\"I'll come anywhere you like,\" said Steerforth, \"or do anything you\nlike. Tell me where to come to; and in two hours I'll produce myself in\nany state you please, sentimental or comical.\"\n\nI gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis,\ncarrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere, and, on this understanding, went\nout alone. There was a sharp bracing air; the ground was dry; the sea\nwas crisp and clear; the sun was diffusing abundance of light, if not\nmuch warmth; and everything was fresh and lively. I was so fresh and\nlively myself, in the pleasure of being there, that I could have stopped\nthe people in the streets and shaken hands with them.\n\nThe streets looked small, of course. The streets that we have only seen\nas children, always do, I believe, when we go back to them. But I had\nforgotten nothing in them, and found nothing changed, until I came to\nMr. Omer's shop. OMER AND JORAM was now written up, where OMER used to\nbe; but the inscription, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER,\n&C., remained as it was.\n\nMy footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop-door, after I had\nread these words from over the way, that I went across the road and\nlooked in. There was a pretty woman at the back of the shop, dancing a\nlittle child in her arms, while another little fellow clung to her\napron. I had no difficulty in recognising either Minnie or Minnie's\nchildren. The glass-door of the parlor was not open; but in the workshop\nacross the yard I could faintly hear the old tune playing, as if it had\nnever left off.\n\n\"Is Mr. Omer at home?\" said I, entering. \"I should like to see him, for\na moment, if he is.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir, he is at home,\" said Minnie; \"this weather don't suit his\nasthma out of doors. Joe, call your grandfather!\"\n\nThe little fellow, who was holding her apron, gave such a lusty shout,\nthat the sound of it made him bashful, and he buried his face in her\nskirts, to her great admiration. I heard a heavy puffing and blowing\ncoming towards us, and soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded than of yore, but\nnot much older-looking, stood before me.\n\n\"Servant, sir,\" said Mr. Omer. \"What can I do for you, sir?\"\n\n\"You can shake hands with me, Mr. Omer, if you please,\" said I, putting\nout my own. \"You were very good-natured to me once, when I am afraid I\ndidn't show that I thought so.\"\n\n\"Was I though?\" returned the old man. \"I'm glad to hear it, but I don't\nremember when. Are you sure it was me?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"I think my memory has got as short as my breath,\" said Mr. Omer,\nlooking at me and shaking his head; \"for I don't remember you.\"\n\n\"Don't you remember your coming to the coach to meet me, and my having\nbreakfast here, and our riding out to Blunderstone together: you, and I,\nand Mrs. Joram, and Mr. Joram too--who wasn't her husband then?\"\n\n\"Why, Lord bless my soul!\" exclaimed Mr. Omer, after being thrown by his\nsurprise into a fit of coughing, \"you don't say so! Minnie, my dear, you\nrecollect? Dear me, yes--the party was a lady, I think?\"\n\n\"My mother,\" I rejoined.\n\n\"To--be--sure,\" said Mr. Omer, touching my waistcoat with his\nforefinger, \"and there was a little child too! There was two parties.\nThe little party was laid along with the other party. Over at\nBlunderstone it was, of course. Dear me! And how have you been since?\"\n\nVery well, I thanked him, as I hoped he had been too.\n\n\"Oh! nothing to grumble at, you know,\" said Mr. Omer. \"I find my breath\ngets short, but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older. I take it as\nit comes, and make the most of it. That's the best way, ain't it?\"\n\nMr. Omer coughed again, in consequence of laughing, and was assisted out\nof his fit by his daughter, who now stood close beside us, dancing her\nsmallest child on the counter.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Omer. \"Yes, to be sure. Two parties! Why, in that\nvery ride, if you'll believe me, the day was named for my Minnie to\nmarry Joram. 'Do name it, sir,' says Joram. 'Yes, do, father,' says\nMinnie. And now he's come into the business. And look here! The\nyoungest!\"\n\nMinnie laughed, and stroked her banded hair upon her temples, as her\nfather put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was\ndancing on the counter.\n\n\"Two parties, of course!\" said Mr. Omer, nodding his head\nretrospectively. \"Ex-actly so! And Joram's at work, at this minute, on a\ngrey one with silver nails, not this measurement\"--the measurement of\nthe dancing child upon the counter--\"by a good two inches.--Will you\ntake something?\"\n\nI thanked him, but declined.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said Mr. Omer. \"Barkis's the carrier's wife--Peggotty's\nthe boatman's sister--she had something to do with your family? She was\nin service there, sure?\"\n\nMy answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction.\n\n\"I believe my breath will get long next, my memory's getting so much\nso,\" said Mr. Omer. \"Well, sir, we've got a young relation of hers here,\nunder articles to us, that has as elegant a taste in the dressmaking\nbusiness--I assure you I don't believe there's a Duchess in England can\ntouch her.\"\n\n\"Not little Em'ly?\" said I, involuntarily.\n\n\"Em'ly's her name,\" said Mr. Omer, \"and she's little too. But if you'll\nbelieve me, she has such a face of her own that half the women in this\ntown are mad against her.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, father!\" cried Minnie.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Omer, \"I don't say it's the case with you,\" winking\nat me, \"but I say that half the women in Yarmouth--ah! and in five mile\nround--are mad against that girl.\"\n\n\"Then she should have kept to her own station in life, father,\" said\nMinnie, \"and not have given them any hold to talk about her, and then\nthey couldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"Couldn't have done it, my dear!\" retorted Mr. Omer. \"Couldn't have done\nit! Is that _your_ knowledge of life? What is there that any woman\ncouldn't do, that she shouldn't do--especially on the subject of another\nwoman's good looks?\"\n\nI really thought it was all over with Mr. Omer, after he had uttered\nthis libellous pleasantry. He coughed to that extent, and his breath\neluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy, that I fully\nexpected to see his head go down behind the counter, and his little\nblack breeches, with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees,\ncome quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle. At length, however, he\ngot better, though he still panted hard, and was so exhausted that he\nwas obliged to sit on the stool of the shop-desk.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, wiping his head, and breathing with difficulty, \"she\nhasn't taken much to any companions here; she hasn't taken kindly to any\nparticular acquaintances and friends, not to mention sweethearts. In\nconsequence, an ill-natured story got about, that Em'ly wanted to be a\nlady. Now my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on\naccount of her sometimes saying, at the school, that if she was a lady\nshe would like to do so and so for her uncle--don't you see?--and buy\nhim such and such fine things.\"\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Omer, she has said so to me,\" I returned eagerly,\n\"when we were both children.\"\n\nMr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin. \"Just so. Then out of a\nvery little, she could dress herself, you see, better than most others\ncould out of a deal, and _that_ made things unpleasant. Moreover, she\nwas rather what might be called wayward--I'll go so far as to say what I\nshould call wayward myself,\" said Mr. Omer, \"--didn't know her own mind\nquite--a little spoiled--and couldn't, at first, exactly bind herself\ndown. No more than that was ever said against her, Minnie?\"\n\n\"No, father,\" said Mrs. Joram. \"That's the worst, I believe.\"\n\n\"So when she got a situation,\" said Mr. Omer, \"to keep a fractious old\nlady company, they didn't very well agree, and she didn't stop. At last\nshe came here, apprenticed for three years. Nearly two of 'em are over,\nand she has been as good a girl as ever was. Worth any six! Minnie, is\nshe worth any six, now?\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" replied Minnie. \"Never say _I_ detracted from her!\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Mr. Omer. \"That's right. And so, young gentleman,\" he\nadded, after a few moments' further rubbing of his chin, \"that you may\nnot consider me long-winded as well as short-breathed, I believe that's\nall about it.\"\n\nAs they had spoken in a subdued tone, while speaking of Em'ly, I had no\ndoubt that she was near. On my asking now, if that were not so, Mr. Omer\nnodded yes, and nodded towards the door of the parlor. My hurried\ninquiry if I might peep in, was answered with a free permission; and,\nlooking through the glass, I saw her sitting at her work. I saw her, a\nmost beautiful little creature, with the cloudless blue eyes, that had\nlooked into my childish heart, turned laughingly upon another child of\nMinnie's who was playing near her; with enough of wilfulness in her\nbright face to justify what I had heard; with much of the old capricious\ncoyness lurking in it; but with nothing in her pretty looks, I am sure,\nbut what was meant for goodness and for happiness, and what was on a\ngood and happy course.\n\nThe tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left off--alas!\nit was the tune that never _does_ leave off--was beating, softly, all\nthe while.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to step in,\" said Mr. Omer, \"and speak to her? Walk\nin and speak to her, sir! Make yourself at home!\"\n\nI was too bashful to do so then--I was afraid of confusing her, and I\nwas no less afraid of confusing myself: but I informed myself of the\nhour at which she left of an evening, in order that our visit might be\ntimed accordingly; and taking leave of Mr. Omer, and his pretty\ndaughter, and her little children, went away to my dear old Peggotty's.\n\nHere she was, in the tiled kitchen, cooking dinner! The moment I knocked\nat the door she opened it, and asked me what I pleased to want. I looked\nat her with a smile, but she gave me no smile in return. I had never\nceased to write to her, but it must have been seven years since we had\nmet.\n\n\"Is Mr. Barkis at home, ma'am?\" I said, feigning to speak roughly to\nher.\n\n\"He's at home, sir,\" returned Peggotty, \"but he's bad abed with the\nrheumatics.\"\n\n\"Don't he go over to Blunderstone now?\" I asked.\n\n\"When he's well, he do,\" she answered.\n\n\"Do _you_ ever go there, Mrs. Barkis?\"\n\nShe looked at me more attentively, and I noticed a quick movement of her\nhands towards each other.\n\n\"Because I want to ask a question about a house there, that they call\nthe--what is it?--the Rookery,\" said I.\n\nShe took a step backward, and put out her hands in an undecided\nfrightened way, as if to keep me off.\n\n\"Peggotty!\" I cried to her.\n\nShe cried, \"My darling boy!\" and we both burst into tears, and were\nlocked in one another's arms.\n\nWhat extravagancies she committed; what laughing and crying over me;\nwhat pride she showed, what joy, what sorrow that she whose pride and\njoy I might have been, could never hold me in a fond embrace; I have not\nthe heart to tell. I was troubled with no misgiving that it was young in\nme to respond to her emotions. I had never laughed and cried in all my\nlife, I dare say--not even to her--more freely than I did that morning.\n\n\"Barkis will be so glad,\" said Peggotty, wiping her eyes with her apron,\n\"that it'll do him more good than pints of liniment. May I go and tell\nhim you are here? Will you come up and see him, my dear?\"\n\nOf course I would. But Peggotty could not get out of the room as easily\nas she meant to, for as often as she got to the door and looked round at\nme, she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my\nshoulder. At last, to make the matter easier, I went up-stairs with her;\nand having waited outside for a minute, while she said a word of\npreparation to Mr. Barkis, presented myself before that invalid.\n\nHe received me with absolute enthusiasm. He was too rheumatic to be\nshaken hands with, but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of\nhis nightcap, which I did most cordially. When I sat down by the side of\nthe bed, he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was\ndriving me on the Blunderstone road again. As he lay in bed, face\nupward, and so covered, with that exception, that he seemed to be\nnothing but a face--like a conventional cherubim,--he looked the\nqueerest object I ever beheld.\n\n\"What name was it, as I wrote up, in the cart, sir?\" said Mr. Barkis,\nwith a slow rheumatic smile.\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Barkis, we had some grave talks about that matter, hadn't we?\"\n\n\"I was willin' a long time, sir?\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\n\"A long time,\" said I.\n\n\"And I don't regret it,\" said Mr. Barkis. \"Do you remember what you told\nme once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the\ncooking?\"\n\n\"Yes, very well,\" I returned.\n\n\"It was as true,\" said Mr. Barkis, \"as turnips is. It was as true,\" said\nMr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap, which was his only means of emphasis,\n\"as taxes is. And nothing's truer than them.\"\n\nMr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me, as if for my assent to this result\nof his reflections in bed; and I gave it.\n\n\"Nothing's truer than them,\" repeated Mr. Barkis; \"a man as poor as I am\nfinds that out in his mind when he's laid up. I'm a very poor man, sir.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis.\"\n\n\"A very poor man, indeed I am,\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\nHere his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes,\nand with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was\nloosely tied to the side of the bed. After some poking about with this\ninstrument, in the course of which his face assumed a variety of\ndistracted expressions, Mr. Barkis poked it against a box, an end of\nwhich had been visible to me all the time. Then his face became\ncomposed.\n\n\"Old clothes,\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\n\"Oh!\" said I.\n\n\"I wish it was Money, sir,\" said Mr. Barkis.\n\n\"I wish it was, indeed,\" said I.\n\n\"But it AIN'T,\" said Mr. Barkis, opening both his eyes as wide as he\npossibly could.\n\nI expressed myself quite sure of that, and Mr. Barkis, turning his eyes\nmore gently to his wife, said:\n\n\"She's the usefullest and best of women, C. P. Barkis. All the praise\nthat any one can give to C. P. Barkis, she deserves, and more! My dear,\nyou'll get a dinner to-day, for company; something good to eat and\ndrink, will you?\"\n\nI should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my\nhonor, but that I saw Peggotty, on the opposite side of the bed,\nextremely anxious I should not. So I held my peace.\n\n\"I have got a trifle of money somewhere about me, my dear,\" said Mr.\nBarkis, \"but I'm a little tired. If you and Mr. David will leave me for\na short nap, I'll try and find it when I wake.\"\n\nWe left the room, in compliance with this request. When we got outside\nthe door, Peggotty informed me that Mr. Barkis, being now \"a little\nnearer\" than he used to be, always resorted to this same device before\nproducing a single coin from his store; and that he endured unheard-of\nagonies in crawling out of bed alone, and taking it from that unlucky\nbox. In effect, we presently heard him uttering suppressed groans of the\nmost dismal nature, as this magpie proceeding racked him in every joint;\nbut while Peggotty's eyes were full of compassion for him, she said his\ngenerous impulse would do him good, and it was better not to check it.\nSo he groaned on, until he had got into bed again, suffering, I have no\ndoubt, a martyrdom; and then called us in, pretending to have just woke\nup from a refreshing sleep, and to produce a guinea from under his\npillow. His satisfaction in which happy imposition on us, and in having\npreserved the impenetrable secret of the box, appeared to be a\nsufficient compensation to him for all his tortures.\n\nI prepared Peggotty for Steerforth's arrival, and it was not long before\nhe came. I am persuaded she knew no difference between his having been a\npersonal benefactor of hers, and a kind friend to me, and that she would\nhave received him with the utmost gratitude and devotion in any case.\nBut his easy, spirited, good humour; his genial manner, his handsome\nlooks, his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased,\nand making direct, when he cared to do it, to the main point of interest\nin anybody's heart; bound her to him wholly in five minutes. His manner\nto me, alone, would have won her. But, through all these causes\ncombined, I sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him before\nhe left the house that night.\n\nHe stayed there with me to dinner--if I were to say willingly, I should\nnot half express how readily and gaily. He went into Mr. Barkis's room\nlike light and air, brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy\nweather. There was no noise, no effort, no consciousness, in anything he\ndid; but in everything an indescribable lightness, a seeming\nimpossibility of doing anything else, or doing anything better, which\nwas so graceful, so natural, and agreeable, that it overcomes me, even\nnow, in the remembrance.\n\nWe made merry in the little parlor, where the Book of Martyrs, unthumbed\nsince my time, was laid out upon the desk as of old, and where I now\nturned over its terrific pictures, remembering the old sensations they\nhad awakened, but not feeling them. When Peggotty spoke of what she\ncalled my room, and of its being ready for me at night, and of her\nhoping I would occupy it, before I could so much as look at Steerforth,\nhesitating, he was possessed of the whole case.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said. \"You'll sleep here, while we stay, and I shall\nsleep at the hotel.\"\n\n\"But to bring you so far,\" I returned, \"and to separate, seems bad\ncompanionship, Steerforth.\"\n\n\"Why, in the name of Heaven, where do you naturally belong!\" he said.\n\"What is 'seems,' compared to that!\" It was settled at once.\n\nHe maintained all his delightful qualities to the last, until we started\nforth, at eight o'clock, for Mr. Peggotty's boat. Indeed, they were more\nand more brightly exhibited as the hours went on; for I thought even\nthen, and I have no doubt now, that the consciousness of success in his\ndetermination to please, inspired him with a new delicacy of perception,\nand made it, subtle as it was, more easy to him. If any one had told me,\nthen, that all this was a brilliant game, played for the excitement of\nthe moment, for the employment of high spirits, in the thoughtless love\nof superiority, in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was\nworthless to him, and next minute thrown away--I say, if any one had\ntold me such a lie that night, I wonder in what manner of receiving it\nmy indignation would have found a vent!\n\nProbably only in an increase, had that been possible, of the romantic\nfeelings of fidelity and friendship with which I walked beside him, over\nthe dark wintry sands, towards the old boat; the wind sighing around us\neven more mournfully, than it had sighed and moaned upon the night when\nI first darkened Mr. Peggotty's door.\n\n\"This is a wild kind of place, Steerforth, is it not?\"\n\n\"Dismal enough in the dark,\" he said; \"and the sea roars as if it were\nhungry for us. Is that the boat, where I see a light yonder?\"\n\n\"That's the boat,\" said I.\n\n\"And it's the same I saw this morning,\" he returned. \"I came straight to\nit, by instinct, I suppose.\"\n\nWe said no more as we approached the light, but made softly for the\ndoor. I laid my hand upon the latch; and whispering Steerforth to keep\nclose to me, went in.\n\nA murmur of voices had been audible on the outside, and, at the moment\nof our entrance, a clapping of hands: which latter noise, I was\nsurprised to see, proceeded from the generally disconsolate Mrs.\nGummidge. But Mrs. Gummidge was not the only person there, who was\nunusually excited. Mr. Peggotty, his face lighted up with uncommon\nsatisfaction, and laughing with all his might, held his rough arms wide\nopen, as if for little Em'ly to run into them; Ham, with a mixed\nexpression in his face of admiration, exultation, and a lumbering sort\nof bashfulness that sat upon him very well, held little Em'ly by the\nhand, as if he were presenting her to Mr. Peggotty; little Em'ly\nherself, blushing and shy, but delighted with Mr. Peggotty's delight, as\nher joyous eyes expressed, was stopped by our entrance (for she saw us\nfirst) in the very act of springing from Ham to nestle in Mr. Peggotty's\nembrace. In the first glimpse we had of them all, and at the moment of\nour passing from the dark cold night into the warm light room, this was\nthe way in which they were all employed: Mrs. Gummidge in the back\nground, clapping her hands like a madwoman.\n\n  [Illustration: We arrive unexpectedly at Mr. Peggotty's fireside.]\n\nThe little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in,\nthat one might have doubted whether it had ever been. I was in the midst\nof the astonished family, face to face with Mr. Peggotty, and holding\nout my hand to him, when Ham shouted:\n\n\"Mas'r Davy! It's Mas'r Davy!\"\n\nIn a moment we were all shaking hands with one another, and asking one\nanother how we did, and telling one another how glad we were to meet,\nand all talking at once. Mr. Peggotty was so proud and overjoyed to see\nus, that he did not know what to say or do, but kept over and over again\nshaking hands with me, and then with Steerforth, and then with me, and\nthen ruffling his shaggy hair all over his head, and laughing with such\nglee and triumph, that it was a treat to see him.\n\n\"Why, that you two gent'lmen--gent'lmen growed--should come to this here\nroof to-night, of all nights in my life,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"is such a\nthing as never happened afore, I do rightly believe! Em'ly, my darling,\ncome here! Come here, my little witch! There's Mas'r Davy's friend, my\ndear! There's the gent'lman as you've heerd on, Em'ly. He comes to see\nyou, along with Mas'r Davy, on the brightest night of your uncle's life\nas ever was or will be, Gorm the t'other one, and horroar for it!\"\n\nAfter delivering this speech all in a breath, and with extraordinary\nanimation and pleasure, Mr. Peggotty put one of his large hands\nrapturously on each side of his niece's face, and kissing it a dozen\ntimes, laid it with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest, and\npatted it as if his hand had been a lady's. Then he let her go; and as\nshe ran into the little chamber where I used to sleep, looked round upon\nus, quite hot and out of breath with his uncommon satisfaction.\n\n\"If you two gent'lmen--gent'lmen growed now, and such gent'lmen--\" said\nMr. Peggotty.\n\n\"So th'are, so th'are!\" cried Ham. \"Well said! So th'are. Mas'r Davy\nbor--gent'lmen growed--so th'are!\"\n\n\"If you two gent'lmen, gent'lmen growed,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"don't\nexcuse me for being in a state of mind, when you understand matters,\nI'll arks your pardon. Em'ly, my dear!--She knows I'm a going to tell,\"\nhere his delight broke out again, \"and has made off. Would you be so\ngood as look arter her, Mawther, for a minute?\"\n\nMrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared.\n\n\"If this ain't,\" said Mr. Peggotty, sitting down among us by the fire,\n\"the brightest night o' my life, I'm a shellfish--biled too--and more I\ncan't say. This here little Em'ly, sir,\" in a low voice to Steerforth,\n\"--her as you see a blushing here just now--\"\n\nSteerforth only nodded; but with such a pleased expression of interest,\nand of participation in Mr. Peggotty's feelings, that the latter\nanswered him as if he had spoken.\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"That's her, and so she is. Thankee,\nsir.\"\n\nHam nodded to me several times, as if he would have said so too.\n\n\"This here little Em'ly of ours,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"has been, in our\nhouse, what I suppose (I'm a ignorant man, but that's my belief) no one\nbut a little bright-eyed creetur _can_ be in a house. She ain't my\nchild; I never had one; but I couldn't love her more. You understand! I\ncouldn't do it!\"\n\n\"I quite understand,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"I know you do, sir,\" returned Mr. Peggotty, \"and thankee again. Mas'r\nDavy, he can remember what she was; you may judge for your own self what\nshe is; but neither of you can't fully know what she has been, is, and\nwill be, to my loving art. I am rough, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"I am as\nrough as a Sea Porkypine; but no one, unless, mayhap, it is a woman, can\nknow, I think, what our little Em'ly is to me. And betwixt ourselves,\"\nsinking his voice lower yet, \"_that_ woman's name ain't Missis Gummidge\nneither, though she has a world of merits.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again with both hands, as a further\npreparation for what he was going to say, and went on with a hand upon\neach of his knees.\n\n\"There was a certain person as had know'd our Em'ly, from the time when\nher father was drownded; as had seen her constant; when a babby, when a\nyoung gal, when a woman. Not much of a person to look at, he warn't,\"\nsaid Mr. Peggotty, \"something o' my own build--rough--a good deal o' the\nsou'-wester in him--wery salt--but, on the whole, a honest sort of a\nchap, with his art in the right place.\"\n\nI thought I had never seen Ham grin to anything like the extent to which\nhe sat grinning at us now.\n\n\"What does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do,\" said Mr. Peggotty,\nwith his face one high noon of enjoyment, \"but he loses that there art\nof his to our little Em'ly. He follers her about, he makes hisself a\nsort o' servant to her, he loses in a great measure his relish for his\nwittles, and in the long run he makes it clear to me wot's amiss. Now I\ncould wish myself, you see, that our little Em'ly was in a fair way of\nbeing married. I could wish to see her, at all ewents, under articles to\na honest man as had a right to defend her. I don't know how long I may\nlive, or how soon I may die; but I know that if I was capsized, any\nnight, in a gale of wind in Yarmouth Roads here, and was to see the\ntown-lights shining for the last time over the rollers as I couldn't\nmake no head against, I could go down quieter for thinking 'There's a\nman ashore there, iron-true to my little Em'ly, God bless her, and no\nwrong can touch my Em'ly while so be as that man lives!'\"\n\nMr. Peggotty, in simple earnestness, waved his right arm, as if he were\nwaving it at the town-lights for the last time, and then, exchanging a\nnod with Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded as before.\n\n\"Well! I counsels him to speak to Em'ly. He's big enough, but he's\nbashfuller than a little un, and he don't like. So _I_ speak. 'What!\n_Him!_' says Em'ly. '_Him_ that I've know'd so intimate so many years,\nand like so much! Oh, Uncle! I never can have _him_. He's such a good\nfellow!' I gives her a kiss, and I says no more to her than 'My dear,\nyou're right to speak out, you're to choose for yourself, you're as\nfree as a little bird.' Then I aways to him, and I says, 'I wish it\ncould have been so, but it can't. But you can both be as you was, and\nwot I say to you is, Be as you was with her, like a man.' He says to\nme, a shaking of my hand, 'I will!' he says. And he was--honorable and\nmanful--for two year going on, and we was just the same at home here as\nafore.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty's face, which had varied in its expression with the various\nstages of his narrative, now resumed all its former triumphant delight,\nas he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon Steerforth's (previously\nwetting them both, for the greater emphasis of the action), and divided\nthe following speech between us:\n\n\"All of a sudden, one evening--as it might be to-night--comes little\nEm'ly from her work, and him with her! There ain't so much in _that_,\nyou'll say. No, because he takes care on her, like a brother, arter\ndark, and indeed afore dark, and at all times. But this tarpaulin chap,\nhe takes hold of her hand, and he cries out to me, joyful, 'Look here!\nThis is to be my little wife!' And she says, half bold and half shy, and\nhalf a laughing and half a crying, 'Yes, uncle! If you please.'--If I\nplease!\" cried Mr. Peggotty, rolling his head in an ecstacy at the idea;\n\"Lord, as if I should do anythink else!--'If you please, I am steadier\nnow, and I have thought better of it, and I'll be as good a little wife\nas I can to him, for he's a dear, good fellow!' Then Missis Gummidge,\nshe claps her hands like a play, and you come in. There! the murder's\nout!\" said Mr. Peggotty--\"You come in! It took place this here present\nhour; and here's the man that'll marry her, the minute she's out of her\ntime.\"\n\nHam staggered, as well he might, under the blow Mr. Peggotty dealt him\nin his unbounded joy, as a mark of confidence and friendship; but\nfeeling called upon to say something to us, he said, with much faltering\nand great difficulty:\n\n\"She warn't no higher than you was, Mas'r Davy--when you\nfirst come--when I thought what she'd grow up to be. I see her\ngrow up--gent'lmen--like a flower. I'd lay down my life for\nher--Mas'r Davy--Oh! most content and cheerful! She's more to\nme--gent'lmen--than--she's all to me that ever I can want, and more\nthan ever I--than ever I could say. I--I love her true. There ain't\na gent'lman in all the land--nor yet sailing upon all the sea--that\ncan love his lady more than I love her, though there's many a common\nman--would say better--what he meant.\"\n\nI thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was now,\ntrembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature\nwho had won his heart. I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by\nMr. Peggotty and by himself, was, in itself, affecting. I was affected\nby the story altogether. How far my emotions were influenced by the\nrecollections of my childhood, I don't know. Whether I had come there\nwith any lingering fancy that I was still to love little Em'ly, I don't\nknow. I know that I was filled with pleasure by all this; but, at first,\nwith an indescribably sensitive pleasure, that a very little would have\nchanged to pain.\n\nTherefore, if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord\namong them with any skill, I should have made a poor hand of it. But it\ndepended upon Steerforth; and he did it with such address, that in a few\nminutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be.\n\n\"Mr. Peggotty,\" he said, \"you are a thoroughly good fellow, and deserve\nto be as happy as you are to-night. My hand upon it! Ham, I give you\njoy, my boy. My hand upon that, too! Daisy, stir the fire, and make it a\nbrisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless you can induce your gentle niece to\ncome back (for whom I vacate this seat in the corner), I shall go. Any\ngap at your fireside on such a night--such a gap least of all--I\nwouldn't make, for the wealth of the Indies!\"\n\nSo Mr. Peggotty went into my old room to fetch little Em'ly. At first\nlittle Em'ly didn't like to come, and then Ham went. Presently they\nbrought her to the fireside, very much confused, and very shy,--but she\nsoon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully\nSteerforth spoke to her; how skilfully he avoided anything that would\nembarrass her; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats, and ships, and\ntides, and fish; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen\nMr. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted he was with the boat and all\nbelonging to it; how lightly and easily he carried on, until he brought\nus, by degrees, into a charmed circle, and we were all talking away\nwithout any reserve.\n\nEm'ly, indeed, said little all the evening; but she looked, and\nlistened, and her face got animated, and she was charming. Steerforth\ntold a story of a dismal shipwreck (which arose out of his talk with Mr.\nPeggotty), as if he saw it all before him--and little Em'ly's eyes were\nfastened on him all the time, as if she saw it too. He told us a merry\nadventure of his own, as a relief to that, with as much gaiety as if the\nnarrative were as fresh to him as it was to us--and little Em'ly laughed\nuntil the boat rang with the musical sounds, and we all laughed\n(Steerforth too), in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and\nlight-hearted. He got Mr. Peggotty to sing, or rather to roar, \"When the\nstormy winds do blow, do blow, do blow;\" and he sang a sailor's song\nhimself, so pathetically and beautifully, that I could have almost\nfancied that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house, and\nmurmuring low through our unbroken silence, was there to listen.\n\nAs to Mrs. Gummidge, he roused that victim of despondency with a success\nnever attained by any one else (so Mr. Peggotty informed me) since the\ndecease of the old one. He left her so little leisure for being\nmiserable that she said next day she thought she must have been\nbewitched.\n\nBut he set up no monopoly of the general attention, or the conversation.\nWhen little Em'ly grew more courageous, and talked (but still bashfully)\nacross the fire to me, of our old wanderings upon the beach, to pick up\nshells and pebbles; and when I asked her if she recollected how I used\nto be devoted to her; and when we both laughed and reddened, casting\nthese looks back on the pleasant old times, so unreal to look at now; he\nwas silent and attentive, and observed us thoughtfully. She sat, at this\ntime, and all the evening, on the old locker in her old little corner by\nthe fire--Ham beside her, where I used to sit. I could not satisfy\nmyself whether it was in her own little tormenting way, or in a maidenly\nreserve before us, that she kept quite close to the wall, and away from\nhim; but I observed that she did so, all the evening.\n\nAs I remember, it was almost midnight when we took our leave. We had had\nsome biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had produced from\nhis pocket a full flask of Hollands, which we men (I may say we men,\nnow, without a blush) had emptied. We parted merrily; and as they all\nstood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our\nroad, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em'ly peeping after us, from\nbehind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we\nwent.\n\n\"A most engaging little Beauty!\" said Steerforth, taking my arm. \"Well!\nIt's a quaint place, and they are quaint company, and it's quite a new\nsensation to mix with them.\"\n\n\"How fortunate we are, too,\" I returned, \"to have arrived to witness\ntheir happiness in that intended marriage! I never saw people so happy.\nHow delightful to see it, and to be made the sharers in their honest\njoy, as we have been!\"\n\n\"That's rather a chuckle-headed fellow for the girl; isn't he?\" said\nSteerforth.\n\nHe had been so hearty with him, and with them all, that I felt a shock\nin this unexpected and cold reply. But turning quickly upon him, and\nseeing a laugh in his eyes, I answered, much relieved:\n\n\"Ah, Steerforth! It's well for you to joke about the poor! You may\nskirmish with Miss Dartle, or try to hide your sympathies in jest from\nme, but I know better. When I see how perfectly you understand them, how\nexquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain fisherman's, or\nhumour a love like my old nurse's, I know that there is not a joy or\nsorrow, not an emotion, of such people, that can be indifferent to you.\nAnd I admire and love you for it, Steerforth, twenty times the more!\"\n\nHe stopped, and, looking in my face, said, \"Daisy, I believe you are in\nearnest, and are good. I wish we all were!\" Next moment he was gaily\nsinging Mr. Peggotty's song, as we walked at a round pace back to\nYarmouth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nSOME OLD SCENES, AND SOME NEW PEOPLE.\n\n\nSteerforth and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the\ncountry. We were very much together, I need not say; but occasionally we\nwere asunder for some hours at a time. He was a good sailor, and I was\nbut an indifferent one; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty,\nwhich was a favorite amusement of his, I generally remained ashore. My\noccupation of Peggotty's spare-room put a constraint upon me, from which\nhe was free: for, knowing how assiduously she attended on Mr. Barkis all\nday, I did not like to remain out late at night; whereas Steerforth,\nlying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour. Thus it\ncame about, that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen\nat Mr. Peggotty's house of call, \"The Willing Mind,\" after I was in bed,\nand of his being afloat, wrapped in fisherman's clothes, whole moonlight\nnights, and coming back when the morning tide was at flood. By this\ntime, however, I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits\ndelighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather, as in any other\nmeans of excitement that presented itself freshly to him; so none of his\nproceedings surprised me.\n\nAnother cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally an\ninterest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar\nscenes of my childhood; while Steerforth, after being there once, had\nnaturally no great interest in going there again. Hence, on three or\nfour days that I can at once recal, we went our several ways after an\nearly breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. I had no idea how he\nemployed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he\nwas very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively\ndiverting himself where another man might not have found one.\n\nFor my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recal\nevery yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old\nspots, of which I never tired. I haunted them, as my memory had often\ndone, and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I\nwas far away. The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay--on\nwhich I had looked out, when it was my father's only, with such curious\nfeelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it\nwas opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby--the grave which\nPeggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden\nof, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the church-yard\npath, in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names\nupon the stone as I walked to and fro, startled by the sound of the\nchurch-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to\nme. My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure\nI was to make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do. My\nechoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as\nif I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother's\nside.\n\nThere were great changes in my old home. The ragged nests, so long\ndeserted by the rooks, were gone; and the trees were lopped and topped\nout of their remembered shapes. The garden had run wild, and half the\nwindows of the house were shut up. It was occupied, but only by a poor\nlunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him. He was always\nsitting at my little window, looking out into the church-yard; and I\nwondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies\nthat used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that\nsame little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly\nfeeding in the light of the rising sun.\n\nOur old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America,\nand the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house,\nand stained the outer walls. Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall,\nraw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a\nheavy head that it couldn't hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with\nwhich it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born.\n\nIt was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to\nlinger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished\nme that it was time to start on my returning walk. But, when the place\nwas left behind, and especially when Steerforth and I were happily\nseated over our dinner by a blazing fire, it was delicious to think\nof having been there. So it was, though in a softened degree, when\nI went to my neat room at night; and, turning over the leaves of\nthe crocodile-book (which was always there, upon a little table),\nremembered with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a\nfriend as Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty, and such a substitute\nfor what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt.\n\nMy nearest way to Yarmouth, in coming back from these long walks, was by\na ferry. It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea, which I\ncould make straight across, and so save myself a considerable circuit by\nthe high road. Mr. Peggotty's house being on that waste-place, and not a\nhundred yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by.\nSteerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me, and we went on\ntogether through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling\nlights of the town.\n\nOne dark evening, when I was later than usual--for I had, that day, been\nmaking my parting visit to Blunderstone, as we were now about to return\nhome--I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty's house, sitting thoughtfully\nbefore the fire. He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was\nquite unconscious of my approach. This, indeed, he might easily have\nbeen if he had been less absorbed, for footsteps fell noiselessly on the\nsandy ground outside; but even my entrance failed to rouse him. I was\nstanding close to him, looking at him; and still, with a heavy brow, he\nwas lost in his meditations.\n\nHe gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder, that he made\nme start too.\n\n\"You come upon me,\" he said, almost angrily, \"like a reproachful ghost!\"\n\n\"I was obliged to announce myself somehow,\" I replied. \"Have I called\nyou down from the stars?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"No.\"\n\n\"Up from anywhere, then?\" said I, taking my seat near him.\n\n\"I was looking at the pictures in the fire,\" he returned.\n\n\"But you are spoiling them for me,\" said I, as he stirred it quickly\nwith a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot\nsparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into\nthe air.\n\n\"You would not have seen them,\" he returned. \"I detest this mongrel\ntime, neither day nor night. How late you are! Where have you been?\"\n\n\"I have been taking leave of my usual walk,\" said I.\n\n\"And I have been sitting here,\" said Steerforth, glancing round the\nroom, \"thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of\nour coming down, might--to judge from the present wasted air of the\nplace--be dispersed, or dead, or come to I don't know what harm. David,\nI wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years!\"\n\n\"My dear Steerforth, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"I wish with all my soul I had been better guided!\" he exclaimed. \"I\nwish with all my soul I could guide myself better!\"\n\nThere was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me. He\nwas more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible.\n\n\"It would be better to be this poor Peggotty, or his lout of a nephew,\"\nhe said, getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece, with\nhis face towards the fire, \"than to be myself, twenty times richer and\ntwenty times wiser, and be the torment to myself that I have been, in\nthis Devil's bark of a boat, within the last half-hour!\"\n\nI was so confounded by the alteration in him, that at first I could only\nobserve him in silence, as he stood leaning his head upon his hand, and\nlooking gloomily down at the fire. At length I begged him, with all the\nearnestness I felt, to tell me what had occurred to cross him so\nunusually, and to let me sympathise with him, if I could not hope to\nadvise him. Before I had well concluded, he began to laugh--fretfully at\nfirst, but soon with returning gaiety.\n\n\"Tut, it's nothing, Daisy! nothing!\" he replied. \"I told you, at the inn\nin London, I am heavy company for myself, sometimes. I have been a\nnightmare to myself, just now--must have had one, I think. At odd dull\ntimes, nursery tales come up into the memory, unrecognised for what they\nare. I believe I have been confounding myself with the bad boy who\n'didn't care,' and became food for lions--a grander kind of going to the\ndogs, I suppose. What old women call the horrors, have been creeping\nover me from head to foot. I have been afraid of myself.\"\n\n\"You are afraid of nothing else, I think,\" said I.\n\n\"Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too,\" he answered.\n\"Well! So it goes by! I am not about to be hipped again, David; but I\ntell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have been well for me\n(and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!\"\n\nHis face was always full of expression, but I never saw it express such\na dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words, with his glance\nbent on the fire.\n\n\"So much for that!\" he said, making as if he tossed something light into\nthe air, with his hand.\n\n                 \"'Why, being gone, I am a man again,'\n\nlike Macbeth. And now for dinner! If I have not (Macbeth-like) broken up\nthe feast with most admired disorder, Daisy.\"\n\n\"But where are they all, I wonder!\" said I.\n\n\"God knows,\" said Steerforth. \"After strolling to the ferry looking for\nyou, I strolled in here and found the place deserted. That set me\nthinking, and you found me thinking.\"\n\nThe advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket, explained how the house had\nhappened to be empty. She had hurried out to buy something that was\nneeded, against Mr. Peggotty's return with the tide; and had left the\ndoor open in the meanwhile, lest Ham and little Em'ly, with whom it was\nan early night, should come home while she was gone. Steerforth, after\nvery much improving Mrs. Gummidge's spirits by a cheerful salutation,\nand a jocose embrace, took my arm, and hurried me away.\n\nHe had improved his own spirits, no less than Mrs. Gummidge's, for they\nwere again at their usual flow, and he was full of vivacious\nconversation as we went along.\n\n\"And so,\" he said, gaily, \"we abandon this buccaneer life to-morrow, do\nwe?\"\n\n\"So we agreed,\" I returned. \"And our places by the coach are taken, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Ay! there's no help for it, I suppose,\" said Steerforth. \"I have almost\nforgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out\ntossing on the sea here. I wish there was not.\"\n\n\"As long as the novelty should last,\" said I, laughing.\n\n\"Like enough,\" he returned; \"though there's a sarcastic meaning in that\nobservation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend.\nWell! I dare say I am a capricious fellow, David. I know I am; but while\nthe iron is hot, I can strike it vigorously too. I could pass a\nreasonably good examination already, as a pilot in these waters, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Mr. Peggotty says you are a wonder,\" I returned.\n\n\"A nautical phenomenon, eh?\" laughed Steerforth.\n\n\"Indeed he does, and you know how truly; knowing how ardent you are in\nany pursuit you follow, and how easily you can master it. And that\namazes me most in you, Steerforth--that you should be contented with\nsuch fitful uses of your powers.\"\n\n\"Contented?\" he answered, merrily. \"I am never contented, except with\nyour freshness, my gentle Daisy. As to fitfulness, I have never learnt\nthe art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the Ixions of\nthese days are turning round and round. I missed it somehow in a bad\napprenticeship, and now don't care about it.--You know I have bought a\nboat down here?\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary fellow you are, Steerforth!\" I exclaimed,\nstopping--for this was the first I had heard of it. \"When you may never\ncare to come near the place again!\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" he returned. \"I have taken a fancy to the place. At\nall events,\" walking me briskly on, \"I have bought a boat that was for\nsale--a clipper, Mr. Peggotty says; and so she is--and Mr. Peggotty will\nbe master of her in my absence.\"\n\n\"Now I understand you, Steerforth!\" said I, exultingly. \"You pretend to\nhave bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a\nbenefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you. My\ndear kind Steerforth, how can I tell you what I think of your\ngenerosity?\"\n\n\"Tush!\" he answered, turning red. \"The less said, the better.\"\n\n\"Didn't I know?\" cried I, \"didn't I say that there was not a joy, or\nsorrow, or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to\nyou?\"\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" he answered, \"you told me all that. There let it rest. We\nhave said enough!\"\n\nAfraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of\nit, I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker\npace than before.\n\n\"She must be newly rigged,\" said Steerforth, \"and I shall leave Littimer\nbehind to see it done, that I may know she is quite complete. Did I tell\nyou Littimer had come down?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! came down this morning, with a letter from my mother.\"\n\nAs our looks met, I observed that he was pale even to his lips, though\nhe looked very steadily at me. I feared that some difference between him\nand his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which\nI had found him at the solitary fireside. I hinted so.\n\n\"Oh no!\" he said, shaking his head, and giving a slight laugh. \"Nothing\nof the sort! Yes. He is come down, that man of mine.\"\n\n\"The same as ever?\" said I.\n\n\"The same as ever,\" said Steerforth. \"Distant and quiet as the North\nPole. He shall see to the boat being fresh named. She's the Stormy\nPetrel now. What does Mr. Peggotty care for Stormy Petrels! I'll have\nher christened again.\"\n\n\"By what name?\" I asked.\n\n\"The Little Em'ly.\"\n\nAs he had continued to look steadily at me, I took it as a reminder that\nhe objected to being extolled for his consideration. I could not help\nshowing in my face how much it pleased me, but I said little, and he\nresumed his usual smile, and seemed relieved.\n\n\"But see here,\" he said, looking before us, \"where the original little\nEm'ly comes! And that fellow with her, eh? Upon my soul, he's a true\nknight. He never leaves her!\"\n\nHam was a boat-builder in these days, having improved a natural\ningenuity in that handicraft, until he had become a skilled workman. He\nwas in his working-dress, and looked rugged enough, but manly withal,\nand a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side.\nIndeed, there was a frankness in his face, an honesty, and an\nundisguised show of his pride in her, and his love for her, which were,\nto me, the best of good looks. I thought, as they came towards us, that\nthey were well matched even in that particular.\n\nShe withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to\nthem, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me. When they\npassed on, after we had exchanged a few words, she did not like to\nreplace that hand, but, still appearing timid and constrained, walked by\nherself. I thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth\nseemed to think so too, as we looked after them fading away in the light\nof a young moon.\n\nSuddenly there passed us--evidently following them--a young woman whose\napproach we had not observed, but whose face I saw as she went by, and\nthought I had a faint remembrance of. She was lightly dressed; looked\nbold, and haggard, and flaunting, and poor; but seemed, for the time, to\nhave given all that to the wind which was blowing, and to have nothing\nin her mind but going after them. As the dark distant level, absorbing\ntheir figures into itself, left but itself visible between us and the\nsea and clouds, her figure disappeared in like manner, still no nearer\nto them than before.\n\n\"That is a black shadow to be following the girl,\" said Steerforth,\nstanding still; \"what does it mean?\"\n\nHe spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to me.\n\n\"She must have it in her mind to beg of them, I think,\" said I.\n\n\"A beggar would be no novelty,\" said Steerforth, \"but it is a strange\nthing that the beggar should take that shape to-night.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked him.\n\n\"For no better reason, truly, than because I was thinking,\" he said,\nafter a pause, \"of something like it, when it came by. Where the Devil\ndid it come from, I wonder!\"\n\n\"From the shadow of this wall, I think,\" said I, as we emerged upon a\nroad on which a wall abutted.\n\n\"It's gone!\" he returned, looking over his shoulder. \"And all ill go\nwith it. Now for our dinner!\"\n\nBut, he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering\nafar off; and yet again. And he wondered about it, in some broken\nexpressions, several times, in the short remainder of our walk; and only\nseemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us,\nseated warm and merry, at table.\n\nLittimer was there, and had his usual effect upon me. When I said to him\nthat I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well, he answered\nrespectfully (and of course respectably), that they were tolerably well,\nhe thanked me, and had sent their compliments. This was all, and yet he\nseemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say: \"You are very young,\nsir; you are exceedingly young.\"\n\nWe had almost finished dinner, when taking a step or two towards the\ntable, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me,\nas I felt, he said to his master:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. Miss Mowcher is down here.\"\n\n\"Who?\" cried Steerforth, much astonished.\n\n\"Miss Mowcher, sir.\"\n\n\"Why, what on earth does _she_ do here?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"It appears to be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me\nthat she makes one of her professional visits here, every year, sir. I\nmet her in the street this afternoon, and she wished to know if she\nmight have the honor of waiting on you after dinner, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you know the Giantess in question, Daisy?\" inquired Steerforth.\n\nI was obliged to confess--I felt ashamed, even of being at this\ndisadvantage before Littimer--that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly\nunacquainted.\n\n\"Then you shall know her,\" said Steerforth, \"for she is one of the seven\nwonders of the world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in.\"\n\nI felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady, especially as\nSteerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her, and\npositively refused to answer any question of which I made her the\nsubject. I remained, therefore, in a state of considerable expectation\nuntil the cloth had been removed some half an hour, and we were sitting\nover our decanter of wine before the fire, when the door opened, and\nLittimer, with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced:\n\n\"Miss Mowcher!\"\n\nI looked at the doorway and saw nothing. I was still looking at the\ndoorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her\nappearance, when, to my infinite astonishment, there came waddling round\na sofa which stood between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or\nforty-five, with a very large head and face, a pair of roguish grey\neyes, and such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself to lay a\nfinger archly against her snub nose, as she ogled Steerforth, she was\nobliged to meet the finger half-way, and lay her nose against it. Her\nchin, which was what is called a double-chin, was so fat that it\nentirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet, bow and all. Throat she\nhad none; waist she had none; legs she had none, worth mentioning; for\nthough she was more than full-sized down to where her waist would have\nbeen, if she had had any, and though she terminated, as human beings\ngenerally do, in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a\ncommon-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on the seat.\nThis lady; dressed in an off-hand, easy style; bringing her nose and her\nforefinger together, with the difficulty I have described; standing with\nher head necessarily on one side, and, with one of her sharp eyes shut\nup, making an uncommonly knowing face; after ogling Steerforth for a few\nmoments, broke into a torrent of words.\n\n\"What! My flower!\" she pleasantly began, shaking her large head at him.\n\"You're there, are you! Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you\ndo so far away from home? Up to mischief, I'll be bound. Oh, you're a\ndowny fellow, Steerforth, so you are, and I'm another, ain't I? Ha, ha,\nha! You'd have betted a hundred pound to five, now, that you wouldn't\nhave seen me here, wouldn't you? Bless you, man alive, I'm everywhere.\nI'm here and there, and where not, like the conjuror's half-crown\nin the lady's handkercher. Talking of hankerchers--_and_ talking of\nladies--what a comfort you are to your blessed mother, ain't you, my\ndear boy, over one of my shoulders, and I don't say which!\"\n\nMiss Mowcher untied her bonnet, at this passage of her discourse, threw\nback the strings, and sat down, panting, on a footstool in front of the\nfire--making a kind of arbor of the dining-table, which spread its\nmahogany shelter above her head.\n\n\"Oh my stars and what's-their-names!\" she went on, clapping a hand on\neach of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, \"I'm of too full\na habit, that's the fact, Steerforth. After a flight of stairs, it gives\nme as much trouble to draw every breath I want, as if it was a bucket of\nwater. If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you'd think I was a\nfine woman, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I should think that, wherever I saw you,\" replied Steerforth.\n\n\"Go along, you dog, do!\" cried the little creature, making a whisk at\nhim with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face, \"and don't\nbe impudent! But I give you my word and honor I was at Lady Mithers's\nlast week--_there's_ a woman! How _she_ wears!--and Mithers himself came\ninto the room where I was waiting for her--_there's_ a man! How _he_\nwears! and his wig too, for he's had it these ten years--and he went on\nat that rate in the complimentary line, that I began to think I should\nbe obliged to ring the bell. Ha! ha! ha! He's a pleasant wretch, but he\nwants principle.\"\n\n\"What were you doing for Lady Mithers?\" asked Steerforth.\n\n\"That's tellings, my blessed infant,\" she retorted, tapping her nose\nagain, screwing up her face, and twinkling her eyes like an imp of\nsupernatural intelligence. \"Never _you_ mind! You'd like to know\nwhether I stop her hair from falling off, or dye it, or touch up her\ncomplexion, or improve her eyebrows, wouldn't you? And so you shall, my\ndarling--when I tell you! Do you know what my great grandfather's name\nwas?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"It was Walker, my sweet pet,\" replied Miss Mowcher, \"and he came of a\nlong line of Walkers, that I inherit all the Hookey estates from.\"\n\nI never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher's wink, except Miss\nMowcher's self-possession. She had a wonderful way too, when listening\nto what was said to her, or when waiting for an answer to what she had\nsaid herself, of pausing with her head cunningly on one side, and one\neye turned up like a magpie's. Altogether I was lost in amazement, and\nsat staring at her, quite oblivious, I am afraid, of the laws of\npoliteness.\n\nShe had by this time drawn the chair to her side, and was busily engaged\nin producing from the bag (plunging in her short arm to the shoulder, at\nevery dive) a number of small bottles, sponges, combs, brushes, bits of\nflannel, little pairs of curling irons, and other instruments, which she\ntumbled in a heap upon the chair. From this employment she suddenly\ndesisted, and said to Steerforth, much to my confusion:\n\n\"Who's your friend?\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" said Steerforth; \"he wants to know you.\"\n\n\"Well, then, he shall! I thought he looked as if he did!\" returned Miss\nMowcher, waddling up to me, bag in hand, and laughing on me as she came.\n\"Face like a peach!\" standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat.\n\"Quite tempting! I'm very fond of peaches. Happy to make your\nacquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I'm sure.\"\n\nI said that I congratulated myself on having the honor to make hers, and\nthat the happiness was mutual.\n\n  [Illustration: I make the acquaintance of Miss Mowcher.]\n\n\"Oh my goodness, how polite we are!\" exclaimed Miss Mowcher, making a\npreposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand.\n\"What a world of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain't it!\"\n\nThis was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a hand\ncame away from the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag\nagain.\n\n\"What do you mean, Miss Mowcher?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! What a refreshing set of humbugs we are, to be sure, ain't\nwe, my sweet child?\" replied that morsel of a woman, feeling in the bag\nwith her head on one side, and her eye in the air. \"Look here!\" taking\nsomething out. \"Scraps of the Russian Prince's nails! Prince Alphabet\nturned topsy-turvy, _I_ call him, for his name's got all the letters in\nit, higgledy-piggledy.\"\n\n\"The Russian Prince is a client of yours, is he?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"I believe you, my pet,\" replied Miss Mowcher. \"I keep his nails in\norder for him. Twice a week! Fingers _and_ toes!\"\n\n\"He pays well, I hope?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Pays as he speaks, my dear child--through the nose,\" replied Miss\nMowcher. \"None of your close shavers the Prince ain't. You'd say so, if\nyou saw his moustachios. Red by nature, black by art.\"\n\n\"By your art, of course,\" said Steerforth.\n\nMiss Mowcher winked assent. \"Forced to send for me. Couldn't help it.\nThe climate affected _his_ dye; it did very well in Russia, but it was\nno go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as\nhe was. Like old iron!\"\n\n\"Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?\" inquired Steerforth.\n\n\"Oh, you're a broth of a boy, ain't you?\" returned Miss Mowcher, shaking\nher head violently. \"I said, what a set of humbugs we were in general,\nand I showed you the scraps of the Prince's nails to prove it. The\nPrince's nails do more for me, in private families of the genteel sort,\nthan all my talents put together. I always carry 'em about. They're the\nbest introduction. If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince's nails, she _must_\nbe all right. I give 'em away to the young ladies. They put 'em in\nalbums, I believe. Ha! ha! ha! Upon my life, 'the whole social system'\n(as the men call it when they make speeches in Parliament) is a system\nof Prince's nails!\" said this least of women, trying to fold her short\narms, and nodding her large head.\n\nSteerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too. Miss Mowcher continuing\nall the time to shake her head (which was very much on one side), and to\nlook into the air with one eye, and to wink with the other.\n\n\"Well, well!\" she said, smiting her small knees, and rising, \"this is\nnot business. Come, Steerforth, let's explore the polar regions, and\nhave it over.\"\n\nShe then selected two or three of the little instruments, and a little\nbottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear. On\nSteerforth's replying in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it,\nand begging the assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the\ntop, as if it were a stage.\n\n\"If either of you saw my ankles,\" she said, when she was safely\nelevated, \"say so, and I'll go home and destroy myself.\"\n\n\"_I_ did not,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"_I_ did not,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried Miss Mowcher, \"I'll consent to live. Now, ducky,\nducky, ducky, come to Mrs. Bond and be killed!\"\n\nThis was an invocation to Steerforth to place himself under her hands;\nwho, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table, and his\nlaughing face towards me, and submitted his head to her inspection,\nevidently for no other purpose than our entertainment. To see Miss\nMowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown hair\nthrough a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her\npocket, was a most amazing spectacle.\n\n\"_You're_ a pretty fellow!\" said Miss Mowcher, after a brief inspection.\n\"You'd be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months,\nbut for me. Just half-a-minute, my young friend, and we'll give you a\npolishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years!\"\n\nWith this, she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to\none of the little bits of flannel, and, again imparting some of the\nvirtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes, began rubbing\nand scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth's head in the\nbusiest manner I ever witnessed, talking all the time.\n\n\"There's Charley Pyegrave, the duke's son,\" she said. \"You know\nCharley?\" peeping round into his face.\n\n\"A little,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"What a man _he_ is! _There's_ a whisker! As to Charley's legs, if they\nwere only a pair (which they ain't), they'd defy competition. Would you\nbelieve he tried to do without me--in the Life-Guards, too?\"\n\n\"Mad!\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"It looks like it. However, mad or sane, he tried,\" returned Miss\nMowcher. \"What does he do, but, lo and behold you, he goes into a\nperfumer's shop, and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid.\"\n\n\"Charley does?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Charley does. But they haven't got any of the Madagascar Liquid.\"\n\n\"What is it? Something to drink?\" asked Steerforth.\n\n\"To drink?\" returned Miss Mowcher, stopping to slap his cheek. \"To\ndoctor his own moustachios with, you _know_. There was a woman in the\nshop--elderly female--quite a Griffin--who had never even heard of it\nby name. 'Begging pardon, sir,' said the Griffin to Charley, 'it's\nnot--not--not ROUGE, is it?' 'Rouge,' said Charley to the Griffin.\n'What the unmentionable to ears polite, do you think I want with\nrouge?' 'No offence, sir,' said the Griffin; 'we have it asked for by\nso many names, I thought it might be.' Now that, my child,\" continued\nMiss Mowcher, rubbing all the time as busily as ever, \"is another\ninstance of the refreshing humbug I was speaking of. _I_ do something\nin that way myself--perhaps a good deal--perhaps a little--sharp's the\nword, my dear boy--never mind!\"\n\n\"In what way do you mean? In the rouge way?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Put this and that together, my tender pupil,\" returned the wary\nMowcher, touching her nose, \"work it by the rule of Secrets in all\ntrades, and the product will give you the desired result. I say _I_ do a\nlittle in that way myself. One Dowager, _she_ calls it lip-salve.\nAnother, _she_ calls it gloves. Another, _she_ calls it tucker-edging.\nAnother, _she_ calls it a fan. _I_ call it whatever _they_ call it. I\nsupply it for 'em, but we keep up the trick so, to one another, and make\nbelieve with such a face, that they'd as soon think of laying it on,\nbefore a whole drawing-room, as before me. And when I wait upon 'em,\nthey'll say to me sometimes--_with it on_--thick, and no mistake--'How\nam I looking, Mowcher? Am I pale?' Ha! ha! ha! ha! Isn't _that_\nrefreshing, my young friend!\"\n\nI never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon\nthe dining-table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at\nSteerforth's head, and winking at me over it.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said. \"Such things are not much in demand hereabouts. That\nsets me off again! I haven't seen a pretty woman since I've been here,\nJemmy.\"\n\n\"No?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Not the ghost of one,\" replied Miss Mowcher.\n\n\"We could show her the substance of one, I think?\" said Steerforth,\naddressing his eyes to mine. \"Eh, Daisy?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said I.\n\n\"Aha?\" cried the little creature, glancing sharply at my face, and then\npeeping round at Steerforth's. \"Umph?\"\n\nThe first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us, and the\nsecond like a question put to Steerforth only. She seemed to have found\nno answer to either, but continued to rub, with her head on one side and\nher eye turned up, as if she were looking for an answer in the air, and\nwere confident of its appearing presently.\n\n\"A sister of yours, Mr. Copperfield?\" she cried, after a pause, and\nstill keeping the same look out. \"Aye, aye?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Steerforth, before I could reply. \"Nothing of the sort. On\nthe contrary, Mr. Copperfield used--or I am much mistaken--to have a\ngreat admiration for her.\"\n\n\"Why, hasn't he now?\" returned Miss Mowcher. \"Is he fickle? oh, for\nshame! Did he sip every flower, and change every hour, until Polly his\npassion requited?--Is her name Polly?\"\n\nThe Elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question,\nand a searching look, quite disconcerted me for a moment.\n\n\"No, Miss Mowcher,\" I replied. \"Her name is Emily.\"\n\n\"Aha?\" she cried exactly as before. \"Umph? What a rattle I am! Mr.\nCopperfield, ain't I volatile?\"\n\nHer tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in\nconnexion with the subject. So I said, in a graver manner than any of us\nhad yet assumed:\n\n\"She is as virtuous as she is pretty. She is engaged to be married to a\nmost worthy and deserving man in her own station of life. I esteem her\nfor her good sense, as much as I admire her for her good looks.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" cried Steerforth. \"Hear, hear, hear! Now, I'll quench the\ncuriosity of this little Fatima, my dear Daisy, by leaving her nothing\nto guess at. She is at present apprenticed, Miss Mowcher, or articled,\nor whatever it may be, to Omer and Joram, Haberdashers, Milliners, and\nso forth, in this town. Do you observe? Omer and Joram. The promise of\nwhich my friend has spoken, is made and entered into with her cousin;\nChristian name, Ham; surname, Peggotty; occupation, boat-builder; also\nof this town. She lives with a relative; Christian name, unknown;\nsurname, Peggotty; occupation, seafaring; also of this town. She is the\nprettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world. I admire her--as\nmy friend does--exceedingly. If it were not that I might appear to\ndisparage her Intended, which I know my friend would not like, I would\nadd, that to _me_ she seems to be throwing herself away; that I am sure\nshe might do better; and that I swear she was born to be a lady.\"\n\nMiss Mowcher listened to these words, which were very slowly and\ndistinctly spoken, with her head on one side, and her eye in the air as\nif she were still looking for that answer. When he ceased, she became\nbrisk again in an instant, and rattled away with surprising volubility.\n\n\"Oh! And that's all about it, is it?\" she exclaimed, trimming his\nwhiskers with a little restless pair of scissors, that went glancing\nround his head in all directions. \"Very well: _very_ well! Quite a long\nstory. Ought to end, 'and they lived happy ever afterwards;' oughtn't\nit? Ah! What's that game at forfeits? I love my love with an E, because\nshe's enticing; I hate her with an E, because she's engaged. I took her\nto the sign of the exquisite, and treated her with an elopement, her\nname's Emily, and she lives in the east? Ha! ha! ha! Mr. Copperfield,\nain't I volatile?\"\n\nMerely looking at me with extravagant slyness, and not waiting for any\nreply, she continued, without drawing breath:\n\n\"There! If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection,\nyou are, Steerforth. If I understand any noddle in the world, I\nunderstand yours. Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling? I\nunderstand yours,\" peeping down into his face. \"Now you may mizzle,\nJemmy (as we say at Court), and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair\nI'll operate on him.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Daisy?\" inquired Steerforth, laughing, and resigning\nhis seat. \"Will you be improved?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Mowcher, not this evening.\"\n\n\"Don't say no,\" returned the little woman, looking at me with the aspect\nof a connoisseur; \"a little bit more eyebrow?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I returned, \"some other time.\"\n\n\"Have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple,\" said\nMiss Mowcher. \"We can do it in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"No, I thank you. Not at present.\"\n\n\"Go in for a tip,\" she urged. \"No? Let's get the scaffolding up, then,\nfor a pair of whiskers. Come!\"\n\nI could not help blushing as I declined, for I felt we were on my weak\npoint, now. But Miss Mowcher, finding that I was not at present disposed\nfor any decoration within the range of her art, and that I was, for the\ntime being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which\nshe held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions, said we would\nmake a beginning on an early day, and requested the aid of my hand to\ndescend from her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with\nmuch agility, and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet.\n\n\"The fee,\" said Steerforth, \"is----\"\n\n\"Five bob,\" replied Miss Mowcher, \"and dirt-cheap, my chicken. Ain't I\nvolatile, Mr. Copperfield?\"\n\nI replied politely: \"Not at all.\" But I thought she was rather so, when\nshe tossed up his two half-crowns like a goblin pieman, caught them,\ndropped them in her pocket, and gave it a loud slap.\n\n\"That's the Till!\" observed Miss Mowcher, standing at the chair again,\nand replacing in the bag the miscellaneous collection of little objects\nshe had emptied out of it. \"Have I got all my traps? It seems so. It\nwon't do to be like long Ned Beadwood, when they took him to church 'to\nmarry him to somebody,' as he says, and left the bride behind. Ha! ha!\nha! A wicked rascal, Ned, but droll! Now, I know I'm going to break your\nhearts, but I am forced to leave you. You must call up all your\nfortitude, and try to bear it. Good bye, Mr. Copperfield! Take care of\nyourself, Jockey of Norfolk! How I _have_ been rattling on! It's all the\nfault of you two wretches. _I_ forgive you! 'Bob swore!'--as the\nEnglishman said for 'Good night,' when he first learnt French, and\nthought it so like English. 'Bob swore,' my ducks!\"\n\nWith the bag slung over her arm, and rattling as she waddled away, she\nwaddled to the door; where she stopped to inquire if she should leave us\na lock of her hair. \"Ain't I volatile?\" she added, as a commentary on\nthis offer, and, with her finger on her nose, departed.\n\nSteerforth laughed to that degree, that it was impossible for me to help\nlaughing too; though I am not sure I should have done so, but for this\ninducement. When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after some\ntime, he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion, and\nmade herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways. Some\npeople trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as\nshrewdly and sharply observant as any one he knew, and as long-headed as\nshe was short-armed. He told me that what she had said of being here,\nand there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts\ninto the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to\nknow everybody. I asked him what her disposition was: whether it was at\nall mischievous, and if her sympathies were generally on the right side\nof things: but, not succeeding in attracting his attention to these\nquestions after two or three attempts, I forbore or forgot to repeat\nthem. He told me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her\nskill, and her profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I\nshould ever have occasion for her services in that capacity.\n\nShe was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening: and\nwhen we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the\nbannisters, \"Bob swore!\" as I went down stairs.\n\nI was surprised, when I came to Mr. Barkis's house to find Ham walking\nup and down in front of it, and still more surprised to learn from him\nthat little Em'ly was inside. I naturally inquired why he was not there\ntoo, instead of pacing the street by himself?\n\n\"Why, you see, Mas'r Davy,\" he rejoined, in a hesitating manner, \"Em'ly,\nshe's talking to some 'un in here.\"\n\n\"I should have thought,\" said I, smiling, \"that that was a reason for\nyour being in here too, Ham.\"\n\n\"Well, Mas'r Davy, in a general way, so 't would be,\" he returned; \"but\nlook'ee here, Mas'r Davy,\" lowering his voice, and speaking very\ngravely. \"It's a young woman, sir--a young woman, that Em'ly knowed\nonce, and doen't ought to know no more.\"\n\nWhen I heard these words, a light began to fall upon the figure I had\nseen following them, some hours ago.\n\n\"It's a poor wurem, Mas'r Davy,\" said Ham, \"as is trod under foot by all\nthe town. Up street and down street. The mowld o' the churchyard don't\nhold any that the folk shrink away from, more.\"\n\n\"Did I see her to-night, Ham, on the sands, after we met you?\"\n\n\"Keeping us in sight?\" said Ham. \"It's like you did, Mas'r Davy. Not\nthat I know'd, then, she was theer, sir, but along of her creeping soon\narterwards under Em'ly's little winder, when she see the light come, and\nwhisp'ring 'Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake have a woman's heart towards\nme. I was once like you!' Those was solemn words, Mas'r Davy, fur to\nhear!\"\n\n\"They were indeed, Ham. What did Em'ly do?\"\n\n\"Says Em'ly, 'Martha, is it you? Oh, Martha, can it be you!'--for they\nhad sat at work together, many a day, at Mr. Omer's.\"\n\n\"I recollect her now!\" cried I, recalling one of the two girls I had\nseen when I first went there. \"I recollect her quite well!\"\n\n\"Martha Endell,\" said Ham. \"Two or three year older than Em'ly, but was\nat the school with her.\"\n\n\"I never heard her name,\" said I. \"I didn't mean to interrupt you.\"\n\n\"For the matter o' that, Mas'r Davy,\" replied Ham, \"all's told a'most in\nthem words, 'Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake have a woman's heart\ntowards me. I was once like you!' She wanted to speak to Em'ly. Em'ly\ncouldn't speak to her theer, for her loving uncle was come home, and he\nwouldn't--no, Mas'r Davy,\" said Ham, with great earnestness, \"he\ncouldn't, kind-natur'd, tender-hearted as he is, see them two together,\nside by side, for all the treasures that's wrecked in the sea.\"\n\nI felt how true this was. I knew it, on the instant, quite as well as\nHam.\n\n\"So Em'ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper,\" he pursued, \"and gives it\nto her out o' winder to bring here. 'Show that,' she says, 'to my aunt,\nMrs. Barkis, and she'll set you down by her fire, for the love of me,\ntill uncle is gone out, and I can come.' By-and-by she tells me what I\ntell you, Mas'r Davy, and asks me to bring her. What can I do? She\ndoen't ought to know any such, but I can't deny her, when the tears is\non her face.\"\n\nHe put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket, and took out with\ngreat care a pretty little purse.\n\n\"And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face, Mas'r Davy,\"\nsaid Ham, tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand, \"how\ncould I deny her when she give me this to carry for her--knowing what\nshe brought it for? Such a toy as it is!\" said Ham, thoughtfully looking\non it. \"With such a little money in it, Em'ly my dear!\"\n\nI shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away again--for\nthat was more satisfactory to me than saying anything--and we walked\nup and down, for a minute or two, in silence. The door opened then,\nand Peggotty appeared, beckoning to Ham to come in. I would have kept\naway, but she came after me, entreating me to come in too. Even then, I\nwould have avoided the room where they all were, but for its being the\nneat-tiled kitchen I have mentioned more than once. The door opening\nimmediately into it, I found myself among them, before I considered\nwhither I was going.\n\nThe girl--the same I had seen upon the sands--was near the fire. She was\nsitting on the ground, with her head and one arm lying on a chair. I\nfancied, from the disposition of her figure, that Em'ly had but newly\nrisen from the chair, and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been\nlying on her lap. I saw but little of the girl's face, over which her\nhair fell loose and scattered, as if she had been disordering it with\nher own hands; but I saw that she was young, and of a fair complexion.\nPeggotty had been crying. So had little Em'ly. Not a word was spoken\nwhen we first went in; and the Dutch clock by the dresser seemed, in the\nsilence, to tick twice as loud as usual.\n\nEm'ly spoke first.\n\n\"Martha wants,\" she said to Ham, \"to go to London.\"\n\n\"Why to London?\" returned Ham.\n\nHe stood between them, looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of\ncompassion for her, and of jealousy of her holding any companionship\nwith her whom he loved so well, which I have always remembered\ndistinctly. They both spoke as if she were ill; in a soft, suppressed\ntone that was plainly heard, although it hardly rose above a whisper.\n\n  [Illustration: Martha.]\n\n\"Better there than here,\" said a third voice aloud--Martha's, though she\ndid not move. \"No one knows me there. Everybody knows me here.\"\n\n\"What will she do there?\" inquired Ham.\n\nShe lifted up her head, and looked darkly round at him for a moment;\nthen laid it down again, and curved her right arm about her neck, as a\nwoman in a fever, or in an agony of pain from a shot, might twist\nherself.\n\n\"She will try to do well,\" said little Em'ly. \"You don't know what she\nhas said to us. Does he--do they--aunt?\"\n\nPeggotty shook her head compassionately.\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Martha, \"if you'll help me away. I never can do worse\nthan I have done here. I may do better. Oh!\" with a dreadful shiver,\n\"take me out of these streets, where the whole town knows me from a\nchild!\"\n\nAs Em'ly held out her hand to Ham, I saw him put in it a little canvas\nbag. She took it, as if she thought it were her purse, and made a step\nor two forward; but finding her mistake, came back to where he had\nretired near me, and showed it to him.\n\n\"It's all yourn, Em'ly,\" I could hear him say. \"I haven't nowt in all\nthe wureld that ain't yourn, my dear. It ain't of no delight to me,\nexcept for you!\"\n\nThe tears rose freshly in her eyes, but she turned away, and went to\nMartha. What she gave her, I don't know. I saw her stooping over her,\nand putting money in her bosom. She whispered something, and asked was\nthat enough? \"More than enough,\" the other said, and took her hand and\nkissed it.\n\nThen Martha arose, and gathering her shawl about her, covering her face\nwith it, and weeping aloud, went slowly to the door. She stopped a\nmoment before going out, as if she would have uttered something or\nturned back; but no word passed her lips. Making the same low, dreary,\nwretched moaning in her shawl, she went away.\n\nAs the door closed, little Em'ly looked at us three in a hurried manner,\nand then hid her face in her hands, and fell to sobbing.\n\n\"Doen't, Em'ly!\" said Ham, tapping her gently on the shoulder. \"Doen't,\nmy dear! You doen't ought to cry so, pretty!\"\n\n\"Oh, Ham!\" she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, \"I am not as good a\ngirl as I ought to be! I know I have not the thankful heart, sometimes,\nI ought to have!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you have, I'm sure,\" said Ham.\n\n\"No! no! no!\" cried little Em'ly, sobbing, and shaking her head. \"I am\nnot as good a girl as I ought to be. Not near! not near!\"\n\nAnd still she cried, as if her heart would break.\n\n\"I try your love too much. I know I do!\" she sobbed. \"I'm often cross to\nyou, and changeable with you, when I ought to be far different. You are\nnever so to me. Why am I ever so to you, when I should think of nothing\nbut how to be grateful, and to make you happy!\"\n\n\"You always make me so,\" said Ham, \"my dear! I am happy in the sight of\nyou. I am happy, all day long, in the thoughts of you.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's not enough!\" she cried. \"That is because you are good; not\nbecause I am! Oh, my dear, it might have been a better fortune for you,\nif you had been fond of some one else--of some one steadier and much\nworthier than me, who was all bound up in you, and never vain and\nchangeable like me!\"\n\n\"Poor little tender-heart,\" said Ham, in a low voice. \"Martha has\noverset her, altogether.\"\n\n\"Please, aunt,\" sobbed Em'ly, \"come here, and let me lay my head upon\nyou. Oh, I am very miserable to-night, aunt! Oh, I am not as good a girl\nas I ought to be. I am not, I know!\"\n\nPeggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire. Em'ly, with her arms\naround her neck, kneeled by her, looking up most earnestly into her\nface.\n\n\"Oh, pray, aunt, try to help me! Ham, dear, try to help me! Mr. David,\nfor the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me! I want to be a\nbetter girl than I am. I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than\nI do. I want to feel more, what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of\na good man, and to lead a peaceful life. Oh me, oh me! Oh, my heart, my\nheart!\"\n\nShe dropped her face on my old nurse's breast, and, ceasing this\nsupplication, which in its agony and grief was half a woman's, half a\nchild's, as all her manner was (being, in that, more natural, and better\nsuited to her beauty, as I thought, than any other manner could have\nbeen), wept silently, while my old nurse hushed her like an infant.\n\nShe got calmer by degrees, and then we soothed her; now talking\nencouragingly, and now jesting a little with her, until she began to\nraise her head and speak to us. So we got on, until she was able to\nsmile, and then to laugh, and then to sit up, half ashamed; while\nPeggotty recalled her stray ringlets, dried her eyes, and made her neat\nagain, lest her uncle should wonder, when she got home, why his darling\nhad been crying.\n\nI saw her do, that night, what I had never seen her do before. I saw her\ninnocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek, and creep close to his\nbluff form as if it were her best support. When they went away together,\nin the waning moonlight, and I looked after them, comparing their\ndeparture in my mind with Martha's, I saw that she held his arm with\nboth her hands, and still kept close to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nI CORROBORATE MR. DICK, AND CHOOSE A PROFESSION.\n\n\nWhen I awoke in the morning I thought very much of little Em'ly, and her\nemotion last night, after Martha had left. I felt as if I had come into\nthe knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and tendernesses in a sacred\nconfidence, and that to disclose them, even to Steerforth, would be\nwrong. I had no gentler feeling towards any one than towards the pretty\ncreature who had been my playmate, and whom I have always been\npersuaded, and shall always be persuaded, to my dying day, I then\ndevotedly loved. The repetition to any ears--even to Steerforth's--of\nwhat she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open to me by an\naccident, I felt would be a rough deed, unworthy of myself, unworthy of\nthe light of our pure childhood, which I always saw encircling her head.\nI made a resolution, therefore, to keep it in my own breast; and there\nit gave her image a new grace.\n\nWhile we were at breakfast, a letter was delivered to me from my aunt.\nAs it contained matter on which I thought Steerforth could advise me as\nwell as any one, and on which I knew I should be delighted to consult\nhim, I resolved to make it a subject of discussion on our journey home.\nFor the present we had enough to do, in taking leave of all our friends.\nMr. Barkis was far from being the last among them, in his regret at our\ndeparture; and I believe would even have opened the box again, and\nsacrificed another guinea, if it would have kept us eight-and-forty\nhours in Yarmouth. Peggotty, and all her family, were full of grief at\nour going. The whole house of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good\nbye; and there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on\nSteerforth, when our portmanteaus went to the coach, that if we had had\nthe baggage of a regiment with us, we should hardly have wanted porters\nto carry it. In a word, we departed to the regret and admiration of all\nconcerned, and left a great many people very sorry behind us.\n\n\"Do you stay long here, Littimer?\" said I, as he stood waiting to see\nthe coach start.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he replied; \"probably not very long, sir.\"\n\n\"He can hardly say just now,\" observed Steerforth, carelessly. \"He knows\nwhat he has to do, and he'll do it.\"\n\n\"That I am sure he will,\" said I.\n\nLittimer touched his hat in acknowledgment of my good opinion, and I\nfelt about eight years old. He touched it once more, wishing us a good\njourney; and we left him standing on the pavement, as respectable a\nmystery as any pyramid in Egypt.\n\nFor some little time we held no conversation, Steerforth being unusually\nsilent, and I being sufficiently engaged in wondering, within myself,\nwhen I should see the old places again, and what new changes might\nhappen to me or them in the meanwhile. At length Steerforth, becoming\ngay and talkative in a moment, as he could become anything he liked at\nany moment, pulled me by the arm:\n\n\"Find a voice, David. What about the letter you were speaking of at\nbreakfast?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said I, taking it out of my pocket. \"It's from my aunt.\"\n\n\"And what does she say, requiring consideration!\"\n\n\"Why, she reminds me, Steerforth,\" said I, \"that I came out on this\nexpedition to look about me, and to think a little.\"\n\n\"Which, of course, you have done?\"\n\n\"Indeed I can't say I have, particularly. To tell you the truth, I am\nafraid I had forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Well! look about you now, and make up for your negligence,\" said\nSteerforth. \"Look to the right, and you'll see a flat country, with a\ngood deal of marsh in it; look to the left, and you'll see the same.\nLook to the front, and you'll find no difference; look to the rear, and\nthere it is still.\"\n\nI laughed, and replied that I saw no suitable profession in the whole\nprospect; which was perhaps to be attributed to its flatness.\n\n\"What says our aunt on the subject?\" inquired Steerforth, glancing at\nthe letter in my hand. \"Does she suggest anything?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said I. \"She asks me, here, if I think I should like to be a\nproctor? What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" replied Steerforth, coolly. \"You may as well do\nthat as anything else, I suppose.\"\n\nI could not help laughing again, at his balancing all callings and\nprofessions so equally; and I told him so.\n\n\"What _is_ a proctor, Steerforth?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, he is a sort of monkish attorney,\" replied Steerforth. \"He is,\nto some faded courts held in Doctors' Commons--a lazy old nook near\nSt. Paul's Churchyard--what solicitors are to the courts of law and\nequity. He is a functionary whose existence, in the natural course of\nthings, would have terminated about two hundred years ago. I can tell\nyou best what he is, by telling you what Doctors' Commons is. It's\na little out-of-the-way place, where they administer what is called\necclesiastical law, and play all kinds of tricks with obsolete old\nmonsters of acts of Parliament, which three-fourths of the world know\nnothing about, and the other fourth supposes to have been dug up, in\na fossil state, in the days of the Edwards. It's a place that has an\nancient monopoly in suits about people's wills and people's marriages,\nand disputes among ships and boats.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Steerforth!\" I exclaimed. \"You don't mean to say that there\nis any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters?\"\n\n\"I don't, indeed, my dear boy,\" he returned; \"but I mean to say that\nthey are managed and decided by the same set of people, down in that\nsame Doctors' Commons. You shall go there one day, and find them\nblundering through half the nautical terms in Young's Dictionary,\napropos of the 'Nancy' having run down the 'Sarah Jane,' or Mr. Peggotty\nand the Yarmouth boatmen having put off in a gale of wind with an anchor\nand cable to the 'Nelson' Indiaman in distress; and you shall go there\nanother day, and find them deep in the evidence, pro and con, respecting\na clergyman who has misbehaved himself; and you shall find the judge in\nthe nautical case, the advocate in the clergyman case, or contrariwise.\nThey are like actors: now a man's a judge, and now he is not a judge;\nnow he's one thing, now he's another; now he's something else, change\nand change about; but it's always a very pleasant profitable little\naffair of private theatricals, presented to an uncommonly select\naudience.\"\n\n\"But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?\" said I, a little\npuzzled. \"Are they?\"\n\n\"No,\" returned Steerforth, \"the advocates are civilians--men who have\ntaken a doctor's degree at college--which is the first reason of my\nknowing anything about it. The proctors employ the advocates. Both get\nvery comfortable fees, and altogether they make a mighty snug little\nparty. On the whole, I would recommend you to take to Doctors' Commons\nkindly, David. They plume themselves on their gentility there, I can\ntell you, if that's any satisfaction.\"\n\nI made allowance for Steerforth's light way of treating the subject,\nand, considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and\nantiquity which I associated with that \"lazy old nook near St. Paul's\nChurchyard,\" did not feel indisposed towards my aunt's suggestion; which\nshe left to my free decision, making no scruple of telling me that it\nhad occurred to her, on her lately visiting her own proctor in Doctors'\nCommons for the purpose of settling her will in my favor.\n\n\"That's a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt, at all events,\"\nsaid Steerforth, when I mentioned it; \"and one deserving of all\nencouragement. Daisy, my advice is that you take kindly to Doctors'\nCommons.\"\n\nI quite made up my mind to do so. I then told Steerforth that my aunt\nwas in town awaiting me (as I found from her letter), and that she had\ntaken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel in Lincoln's Inn\nFields, where there was a stone staircase, and a convenient door in the\nroof; my aunt being firmly persuaded that every house in London was\ngoing to be burnt down every night.\n\nWe achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to\nDoctors' Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a\nproctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and\nwhimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our journey's\nend, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but one; and I\ndrove to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I found my aunt up, and waiting\nsupper.\n\nIf I had been round the world since we parted, we could hardly have been\nbetter pleased to meet again. My aunt cried outright as she embraced me;\nand said, pretending to laugh, that if my poor mother had been alive,\nthat silly little creature would have shed tears, she had no doubt.\n\n\"So you have left Mr. Dick behind, aunt?\" said I. \"I am sorry for that.\nAh, Janet, how do you do?\"\n\nAs Janet curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt's visage\nlengthen very much.\n\n\"I am sorry for it, too,\" said my aunt, rubbing her nose. \"I have had no\npeace of mind, Trot, since I have been here.\"\n\nBefore I could ask why, she told me.\n\n\"I am convinced,\" said my aunt; laying her hand with melancholy firmness\non the table, \"that Dick's character is not a character to keep the\ndonkies off. I am confident he wants strength of purpose. I ought to\nhave left Janet at home, instead, and then my mind might perhaps have\nbeen at ease. If ever there was a donkey trespassing on my green,\" said\nmy aunt, with emphasis, \"there was one this afternoon at four o'clock. A\ncold feeling came over me from head to foot, and I _know_ it was a\ndonkey!\"\n\nI tried to comfort her on this point, but she rejected consolation.\n\n\"It was a donkey,\" said my aunt; \"and it was the one with the stumpy\ntail which that Murdering sister of a woman rode, when she came to my\nhouse.\" This had been, ever since, the only name my aunt knew for Miss\nMurdstone. \"If there is any donkey in Dover, whose audacity it is harder\nto me to bear than another's, that,\" said my aunt, striking the table,\n\"is the animal!\"\n\nJanet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself\nunnecessarily, and that she believed the donkey in question was then\nengaged in the sand and gravel line of business, and was not available\nfor purposes of trespass. But my aunt wouldn't hear of it.\n\nSupper was comfortably served and hot, though my aunt's rooms were very\nhigh up--whether that she might have more stone stairs for her money, or\nmight be nearer to the door in the roof, I don't know--and consisted of\na roast fowl, a steak, and some vegetables, to all of which I did ample\njustice, and which were all excellent. But my aunt had her own ideas\nconcerning London provision, and ate but little.\n\n\"I suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a cellar,\"\nsaid my aunt, \"and never took the air except on a hackney coach-stand. I\n_hope_ the steak may be beef, but I don't believe it. Nothing's genuine\nin the place, in my opinion, but the dirt.\"\n\n\"Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?\" I\nhinted.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" returned my aunt. \"It would be no pleasure to a London\ntradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was.\"\n\nI did not venture to controvert this opinion, but I made a good supper,\nwhich it greatly satisfied her to see me do. When the table was cleared,\nJanet assisted her to arrange her hair, to put on her nightcap, which\nwas of a smarter construction than usual (\"in case of fire,\" my aunt\nsaid), and to fold her gown back over her knees, these being her usual\npreparations for warming herself before going to bed. I then made her,\naccording to certain established regulations from which no deviation,\nhowever slight, could ever be permitted, a glass of hot white wine and\nwater, and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips. With these\naccompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening, my aunt sitting\nopposite to me drinking her wine and water; soaking her strips of toast\nin it, one by one, before eating them; and looking benignantly on me,\nfrom among the borders of her nightcap.\n\n\"Well, Trot,\" she began, \"what do you think of the proctor plan? Or have\nyou not begun to think about it yet?\"\n\n\"I have thought a good deal about it, my dear aunt, and I have talked a\ngood deal about it with Steerforth. I like it very much indeed. I like\nit exceedingly.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said my aunt. \"That's cheering!\"\n\n\"I have only one difficulty, aunt.\"\n\n\"Say what it is, Trot,\" she returned.\n\n\"Why, I want to ask, aunt, as this seems, from what I understand, to be\na limited profession, whether my entrance into it would not be very\nexpensive?\"\n\n\"It will cost,\" returned my aunt, \"to article you, just a thousand\npounds.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear aunt,\" said I, drawing my chair nearer, \"I am uneasy in my\nmind about that. It's a large sum of money. You have expended a great\ndeal on my education, and have always been as liberal to me in all\nthings, as it was possible to be. You have been the soul of generosity.\nSurely there are some ways in which I might begin life with hardly any\noutlay, and yet begin with a good hope of getting on by resolution and\nexertion. Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course?\nAre you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that\nit is right it should be so expended? I only ask you, my second mother,\nto consider. Are you certain?\"\n\nMy aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then\nengaged, looking me full in the face all the while; and then setting her\nglass on the chimney-piece, and folding her hands upon her folded\nskirts, replied as follows:\n\n\"Trot, my child, if I have any object in life, it is to provide for your\nbeing a good, a sensible, and a happy man. I am bent upon it--so is\nDick. I should like some people that I know to hear Dick's conversation\non the subject. Its sagacity is wonderful. But no one knows the\nresources of that man's intellect, except myself!\"\n\nShe stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went on:\n\n\"It's in vain, Trot, to recall the past, unless it works some influence\nupon the present. Perhaps I might have been better friends with your\npoor father. Perhaps I might have been better friends with that poor\nchild your mother, even after your sister Betsey Trotwood disappointed\nme. When you came to me, a little runaway boy, all dusty and wayworn,\nperhaps I thought so. From that time until now, Trot, you have ever been\na credit to me and a pride and pleasure. I have no other claim upon my\nmeans; at least\"--here to my surprise she hesitated, and was\nconfused--\"no, I have _no_ other claim upon my means--and you are my\nadopted child. Only be a loving child to me in my age, and bear with my\nwhims and fancies; and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of\nlife was not so happy or conciliating as it might have been, than ever\nthat old woman did for you.\"\n\nIt was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history.\nThere was a magnanimity in her quiet way of doing so, and of dismissing\nit, which would have exalted her in my respect and affection, if any\nthing could.\n\n\"All is agreed and understood between us now, Trot,\" said my aunt, \"and\nwe need talk of this no more. Give me a kiss, and we'll go to the\nCommons after breakfast to-morrow.\"\n\nWe had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed. I slept in a room\non the same floor with my aunt's, and was a little disturbed in the\ncourse of the night by her knocking at my door, as often as she was\nagitated by a distant sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts, and\ninquiring \"if I heard the engines?\" But towards morning she slept\nbetter, and suffered me to do so too.\n\nAt about mid-day, we set out for the offices of Messrs. Spenlow and\nJorkins in Doctors' Commons. My aunt, who had this other general opinion\nin reference to London, that every man she saw was a pickpocket, gave me\nher purse to carry for her, which had ten guineas in it and some silver.\n\nWe made a pause at the toy-shop in Fleet-street, to see the giants of\nSaint Dunstan's strike upon the bells--we had timed our going, so as to\ncatch them at it, at twelve o'clock--and then went on towards Ludgate\nHill, and St. Paul's Churchyard. We were crossing to the former place,\nwhen I found that my aunt greatly accelerated her speed, and looked\nfrightened. I observed, at the same time, that a lowering ill-dressed\nman who had stopped and stared at us in passing, a little before, was\ncoming so close after us, as to brush against her.\n\n\"Trot! My dear Trot!\" cried my aunt, in a terrified whisper, and\npressing my arm. \"I don't know what I am to do.\"\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" said I. \"There's nothing to be afraid of. Step into\na shop, and I'll soon get rid of this fellow.\"\n\n\"No, no, child!\" she returned. \"Don't speak to him for the world. I\nentreat, I order you!\"\n\n\"Good Heaven, aunt!\" said I. \"He is nothing but a sturdy beggar.\"\n\n\"You don't know what he is!\" replied my aunt. \"You don't know who he is!\nYou don't know what you say!\"\n\nWe had stopped in an empty doorway, while this was passing, and he had\nstopped too.\n\n\"Don't look at him!\" said my aunt, as I turned my head indignantly, \"but\nget me a coach, my dear, and wait for me in St. Paul's Churchyard.\"\n\n\"Wait for you?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes,\" rejoined my aunt, \"I must go alone. I must go with him.\"\n\n\"With him, aunt? This man?\"\n\n\"I am in my senses,\" she replied, \"and I tell you I _must_. Get me a\ncoach!\"\n\nHowever much astonished I might be, I was sensible that I had no right\nto refuse compliance with such a peremptory command. I hurried away a\nfew paces, and called a hackney chariot which was passing empty. Almost\nbefore I could let down the steps, my aunt sprang in, I don't know how,\nand the man followed. She waved her hand to me to go away, so earnestly,\nthat, all confounded as I was, I turned from them at once. In doing so I\nheard her say to the coachman, \"Drive anywhere! Drive straight on!\" and\npresently the chariot passed me, going up the hill.\n\nWhat Mr. Dick had told me, and what I had supposed to be a delusion of\nhis, now came into my mind. I could not doubt that this person was the\nperson of whom he had made such mysterious mention, though what the\nnature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be, I was quite unable to\nimagine. After half an hour's cooling in the churchyard, I saw the\nchariot coming back. The driver stopped beside me, and my aunt was\nsitting in it alone.\n\nShe had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite\nprepared for the visit we had to make. She desired me to get into the\nchariot, and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little\nwhile. She said no more, except, \"My dear child, never ask me what it\nwas, and don't refer to it,\" until she had perfectly regained her\ncomposure, when she told me she was quite herself now, and we might get\nout. On her giving me her purse, to pay the driver, I found that all the\nguineas were gone, and only the loose silver remained.\n\nDoctors' Commons was approached by a little low archway. Before we had\ntaken many paces down the street beyond it, the noise of the city seemed\nto melt, as if by magic, into a softened distance. A few dull courts,\nand narrow ways, brought us to the sky-lighted offices of Spenlow and\nJorkins; in the vestibule of which temple, accessible to pilgrims\nwithout the ceremony of knocking, three or four clerks were at work as\ncopyists. One of these, a little dry man, sitting by himself, who wore a\nstiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to\nreceive my aunt, and show us into Mr. Spenlow's room.\n\n\"Mr. Spenlow's in Court, ma'am,\" said the dry man; \"it's an Arches day;\nbut it's close by, and I'll send for him directly.\"\n\nAs we were left to look about us while Mr. Spenlow was fetched, I\navailed myself of the opportunity. The furniture of the room was\nold-fashioned and dusty; and the green baize on the top of the\nwriting-table had lost all its color, and was as withered and pale as\nan old pauper. There were a great many bundles of papers on it, some\nindorsed as Allegations, and some (to my surprise) as Libels, and\nsome as being in the Consistory Court, and some in the Arches Court,\nand some in the Prerogative Court, and some in the Admiralty Court,\nand some in the Delegates' Court; giving me occasion to wonder much,\nhow many Courts there might be in the gross, and how long it would\ntake to understand them all. Besides these, there were sundry immense\nmanuscript Books of Evidence taken on affidavit, strongly bound, and\ntied together in massive sets, a set to each cause, as if every cause\nwere a history in ten or twenty volumes. All this looked tolerably\nexpensive, I thought, and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor's\nbusiness. I was casting my eyes with increasing complacency over these\nand many similar objects, when hasty footsteps were heard in the room\noutside, and Mr. Spenlow, in a black gown trimmed with white fur, came\nhurrying in, taking off his hat as he came.\n\nHe was a little light-haired gentleman, with undeniable boots, and the\nstiffest of white cravats and shirt-collars. He was buttoned up, mighty\ntrim and tight, and must have taken a great deal of pains with his\nwhiskers, which were accurately curled. His gold watch-chain was so\nmassive, that a fancy came across me, that he ought to have a sinewy\ngolden arm, to draw it out with, like those which are put up over the\ngold-beaters' shops. He was got up with such care, and was so stiff,\nthat he could hardly bend himself; being obliged, when he glanced at\nsome papers on his desk, after sitting down in his chair, to move his\nwhole body, from the bottom of his spine, like Punch.\n\nI had previously been presented by my aunt, and had been courteously\nreceived. He now said:\n\n\"And so, Mr. Copperfield, you think of entering into our profession?\nI casually mentioned to Miss Trotwood, when I had the pleasure of an\ninterview with her the other day,\"--with another inclination of his\nbody--Punch again--\"that there was a vacancy here. Miss Trotwood was\ngood enough to mention that she had a nephew who was her peculiar care,\nand for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly in life. That nephew,\nI believe, I have now the pleasure of\"--Punch again.\n\nI bowed my acknowledgments, and said, my aunt had mentioned to me that\nthere was that opening, and that I believed I should like it very much.\nThat I was strongly inclined to like it, and had taken immediately to\nthe proposal. That I could not absolutely pledge myself to like it,\nuntil I knew something more about it. That although it was little else\nthan a matter of form, I presumed I should have an opportunity of trying\nhow I liked it, before I bound myself to it irrevocably.\n\n\"Oh surely! surely!\" said Mr. Spenlow. \"We always, in this house,\npropose a month--an initiatory month. I should be happy, myself, to\npropose two months--three--an indefinite period, in fact--but I have a\npartner. Mr. Jorkins.\"\n\n\"And the premium, sir,\" I returned, \"is a thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"And the premium, Stamp included, is a thousand pounds,\" said Mr.\nSpenlow. \"As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood, I am actuated by no\nmercenary considerations; few men are less so, I believe; but Mr.\nJorkins has his opinions on these subjects, and I am bound to respect\nMr. Jorkins's opinions. Mr. Jorkins thinks a thousand pounds too little,\nin short.\"\n\n\"I suppose, sir,\" said I, still desiring to spare my aunt, \"that it is\nnot the custom here, if an articled clerk were particularly useful, and\nmade himself a perfect master of his profession--\" I could not help\nblushing, this looked so like praising myself--\"I suppose it is not the\ncustom, in the later years of his time, to allow him any--\"\n\nMr. Spenlow, by a great effort, just lifted his head far enough out of\nhis cravat to shake it, and answered, anticipating the word \"salary:\"\n\n\"No. I will not say what consideration I might give to that point\nmyself, Mr. Copperfield, if I were unfettered. Mr. Jorkins is\nimmovable.\"\n\nI was quite dismayed by the idea of this terrible Jorkins. But I found\nout afterwards that he was a mild man, of a heavy temperament, whose\nplace in the business was to keep himself in the back-ground, and be\nconstantly exhibited by name as the most obdurate and ruthless of men.\nIf a clerk wanted his salary raised, Mr. Jorkins wouldn't listen to such\na proposition. If a client were slow to settle his bill of costs, Mr.\nJorkins was resolved to have it paid; and however painful these things\nmight be (and always were) to the feelings of Mr. Spenlow, Mr. Jorkins\nwould have his bond. The heart and hand of the good angel Spenlow would\nhave been always open, but for the restraining demon Jorkins. As I have\ngrown older, I think I have had experience of some other houses doing\nbusiness on the principle of Spenlow and Jorkins!\n\nIt was settled that I should begin my month's probation as soon as I\npleased, and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return at its\nexpiration, as the articles of agreement, of which I was to be the\nsubject, could easily be sent to her at home for her signature. When we\nhad got so far, Mr. Spenlow offered to take me into Court then and\nthere, and show me what sort of place it was. As I was willing enough to\nknow, we went out with this object, leaving my aunt behind; who would\ntrust herself, she said, in no such place, and who, I think, regarded\nall Courts of Law as a sort of powder-mills that might blow up at any\ntime.\n\nMr. Spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave\nbrick houses, which I inferred, from the Doctors' names upon the\ndoors, to be the official abiding-places of the learned advocates of\nwhom Steerforth had told me; and into a large dull room, not unlike\na chapel to my thinking, on the left hand. The upper part of this\nroom was fenced off from the rest; and there, on the two sides of a\nraised platform of the horse-shoe form, sitting on easy old-fashioned\ndining-room chairs, were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs,\nwhom I found to be the Doctors aforesaid. Blinking over a little\ndesk like a pulpit-desk, in the curve of the horse-shoe, was an old\ngentleman, whom, if I had seen him in an aviary, I should certainly\nhave taken for an owl, but who I learned was the presiding judge. In\nthe space within the horse-shoe, lower than these, that is to say,\non about the level of the floor, were sundry other gentlemen, of Mr.\nSpenlow's rank, and dressed like him in black gowns with white fur upon\nthem, sitting at a long green table. Their cravats were in general\nstiff, I thought, and their looks haughty; but in this last respect I\npresently conceived I had done them an injustice, for when two or three\nof them had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary,\nI never saw anything more sheepish. The public, represented by a boy\nwith a comforter, and a shabby-genteel man secretly eating crumbs out\nof his coat pockets, was warming itself at a stove in the centre of\nthe Court. The languid stillness of the place was only broken by the\nchirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors, who was\nwandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence, and stopping to\nput up, from time to time, at little roadside inns of argument on the\njourney. Altogether, I have never, on any occasion, made one at such\na cosey, dosey, old-fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little\nfamily-party in all my life; and I felt it would be quite a soothing\nopiate to belong to it in any character--except perhaps as a suitor.\n\nVery well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat, I informed\nMr. Spenlow that I had seen enough for that time, and we rejoined my\naunt; in company with whom I presently departed from the Commons,\nfeeling very young when I went out of Spenlow and Jorkins's, on account\nof the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out.\n\nWe arrived at Lincoln's Inn Fields without any new adventures, except\nencountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger's cart, who suggested\npainful associations to my aunt. We had another long talk about my\nplans, when we were safely housed; and as I knew she was anxious to get\nhome, and, between fire, food, and pickpockets, could never be\nconsidered at her ease for half-an-hour in London, I urged her not to be\nuncomfortable on my account, but to leave me to take care of myself.\n\n\"I have not been here a week to-morrow, without considering that too, my\ndear,\" she returned. \"There is a furnished little set of chambers to be\nlet in the Adelphi, Trot, which ought to suit you to a marvel.\"\n\nWith this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an\nadvertisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in\nBuckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let, furnished, with a\nview of the river, a singularly desirable, and compact set of chambers,\nforming a genteel residence for a young gentleman, a member of one of\nthe Inns of Court, or otherwise, with immediate possession. Terms\nmoderate, and could be taken for a month only if required.\n\n\"Why, this is the very thing, aunt!\" said I, flushed with the possible\ndignity of living in chambers.\n\n\"Then come,\" replied my aunt, immediately resuming the bonnet she had a\nminute before laid aside. \"We'll go and look at 'em.\"\n\nAway we went. The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs. Crupp on\nthe premises, and we rung the area bell, which we supposed to\ncommunicate with Mrs. Crupp. It was not until we had rung three or four\ntimes that we could prevail on Mrs. Crupp to communicate with us, but at\nlast she appeared, being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel\npetticoat below a nankeen gown.\n\n\"Let us see these chambers of yours, if you please, ma'am,\" said my\naunt.\n\n\"For this gentleman?\" said Mrs. Crupp, feeling in her pocket for her\nkeys.\n\n\"Yes, for my nephew,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"And a sweet set they is for sich!\" said Mrs. Crupp.\n\nSo we went up-stairs.\n\nThey were on the top of the house--a great point with my aunt, being\nnear the fire-escape--and consisted of a little half-blind entry where\nyou could see hardly anything, a little stone-blind pantry where you\ncould see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bed-room. The furniture\nwas rather faded, but quite good enough for me; and, sure enough, the\nriver was outside the windows.\n\nAs I was delighted with the place, my aunt and Mrs. Crupp withdrew into\nthe pantry to discuss the terms, while I remained on the sitting-room\nsofa, hardly daring to think it possible that I could be destined to\nlive in such a noble residence. After a single combat of some duration\nthey returned, and I saw, to my joy, both in Mrs. Crupp's countenance\nand in my aunt's, that the deed was done.\n\n\"Is it the last occupant's furniture?\" inquired my aunt.\n\n\"Yes it is, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Crupp.\n\n\"What's become of him?\" asked my aunt.\n\nMrs. Crupp was taken with a troublesome cough, in the midst of which\nshe articulated with much difficulty. \"He was took ill here, ma'am,\nand--ugh! ugh! ugh! dear me!--and he died.\"\n\n\"Hey! What did he die of?\" asked my aunt.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, he died of drink,\" said Mrs. Crupp in confidence. \"And\nsmoke.\"\n\n\"Smoke? You don't mean chimneys?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" returned Mrs. Crupp. \"Cigars and pipes.\"\n\n\"_That's_ not catching, Trot, at any rate,\" remarked my aunt, turning to\nme.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said I.\n\nIn short, my aunt, seeing how enraptured I was with the premises, took\nthem for a month, with leave to remain for twelve months when that time\nwas out. Mrs. Crupp was to find linen, and to cook; every other\nnecessary was already provided; and Mrs. Crupp expressly intimated that\nshe should always yearn towards me as a son. I was to take possession\nthe day after to-morrow, and Mrs. Crupp said thank Heaven she had now\nfound summun she could care for!\n\nOn our way back, my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that\nthe life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant, which\nwas all I wanted. She repeated this several times next day, in the\nintervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books\nfrom Mr. Wickfield's; relative to which, and to all my late holiday, I\nwrote a long letter to Agnes, of which my aunt took charge, as she was\nto leave on the succeeding day. Not to lengthen these particulars, I\nneed only add, that she made a handsome provision for all my possible\nwants during my month of trial; that Steerforth, to my great\ndisappointment and hers too, did not make his appearance before she went\naway; that I saw her safely seated in the Dover coach, exulting in the\ncoming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys, with Janet at her side; and\nthat when the coach was gone, I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering\non the old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and\non the happy changes which had brought me to the surface.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nMY FIRST DISSIPATION.\n\n\nIt was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself, and\nto feel, when I shut my outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, when he had\ngot into his fortification, and pulled his ladder up after him. It was a\nwonderfully fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in my\npocket, and to know that I could ask any fellow to come home, and make\nquite sure of its being inconvenient to nobody, if it were not so to me.\nIt was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out, and to come\nand go without a word to any one, and to ring Mrs. Crupp up, gasping,\nfrom the depths of the earth, when I wanted her--and when she was\ndisposed to come. All this, I say, was wonderfully fine; but I must say,\ntoo, that there were times when it was very dreary.\n\nIt was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings. It looked\na very fresh, free life, by daylight: still fresher, and more free, by\nsunlight. But as the day declined, the life seemed to go down too. I\ndon't know how it was; it seldom looked well by candle-light. I wanted\nsomebody to talk to, then. I missed Agnes. I found a tremendous blank,\nin the place of that smiling repository of my confidence. Mrs. Crupp\nappeared to be a long way off. I thought about my predecessor, who had\ndied of drink and smoke; and I could have wished he had been so good as\nto live, and not bother me with his decease.\n\nAfter two days and nights, I felt as if I had lived there for a year,\nand yet I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented by my\nown youthfulness as ever.\n\nSteerforth not yet appearing, which induced me to apprehend that he must\nbe ill, I left the Commons early on the third day, and walked out to\nHighgate. Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me, and said that he had\ngone away with one of his Oxford friends to see another who lived near\nSt. Albans, but that she expected him to return to-morrow. I was so fond\nof him, that I felt quite jealous of his Oxford friends.\n\nAs she pressed me to stay to dinner, I remained, and I believe we talked\nabout nothing but him all day. I told her how much the people liked him\nat Yarmouth, and what a delightful companion he had been. Miss Dartle\nwas full of hints and mysterious questions, but took a great interest in\nall our proceedings there, and said, \"Was it really, though?\" and so\nforth, so often, that she got everything out of me she wanted to know.\nHer appearance was exactly what I have described it, when I first saw\nher; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable, and came so\nnatural to me, that I felt myself falling a little in love with her. I\ncould not help thinking, several times in the course of the evening, and\nparticularly when I walked home at night, what delightful company she\nwould be in Buckingham Street.\n\nI was taking my coffee and roll in the morning, before going to the\nCommons--and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how much\ncoffee Mrs. Crupp used, and how weak it was, considering--when\nSteerforth himself walked in, to my unbounded joy.\n\n\"My dear Steerforth,\" cried I, \"I began to think I should never see you\nagain!\"\n\n\"I was carried off, by force of arms,\" said Steerforth, \"the very next\nmorning after I got home. Why, Daisy, what a rare old bachelor you are\nhere!\"\n\nI showed him over the establishment, not omitting the pantry, with no\nlittle pride, and he commended it highly. \"I tell you what, old boy,\" he\nadded, \"I shall make quite a town-house of this place, unless you give\nme notice to quit.\"\n\nThis was a delightful hearing. I told him if he waited for that, he\nwould have to wait till doomsday.\n\n\"But you shall have some breakfast!\" said I, with my hand on the\nbell-rope, \"and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee, and I'll\ntoast you some bacon in a bachelor's Dutch-oven that I have got here.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Steerforth. \"Don't ring! I can't! I am going to breakfast\nwith one of these fellows who is at the Piazza Hotel, in Covent Garden.\"\n\n\"But you'll come back to dinner?\" said I.\n\n\"I can't, upon my life. There's nothing I should like better, but I\n_must_ remain with these two fellows. We are all three off together\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Then bring them here to dinner,\" I returned. \"Do you think they would\ncome?\"\n\n\"Oh! they would come fast enough,\" said Steerforth; \"but we should\ninconvenience you. You had better come and dine with us somewhere.\"\n\nI would not by any means consent to this, for it occurred to me that I\nreally ought to have a little housewarming, and that there never could\nbe a better opportunity. I had a new pride in my rooms after his\napproval of them, and burned with a desire to develop their utmost\nresources. I therefore made him promise positively in the names of his\ntwo friends, and we appointed six o'clock as the dinner-hour.\n\nWhen he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with my\ndesperate design. Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course it\nwas well known she couldn't be expected to wait, but she knew a handy\nyoung man, who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it, and whose\nterms would be five shillings, and what I pleased. I said, certainly we\nwould have him. Next, Mrs. Crupp said it was clear she couldn't be in\ntwo places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that \"a young\ngal\" stationed in the pantry with a bed-room candle, there never to\ndesist from washing plates, would be indispensable. I said, what would\nbe the expense of this young female, and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed\neighteen-pence would neither make me nor break me. I said I supposed\nnot; and _that_ was settled. Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now about the dinner.\n\nIt was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of\nthe ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp's kitchen fire-place, that it\nwas capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes. As to a\nfish-kittle, Mrs. Crupp said, well! would I only come and look at the\nrange. She couldn't say fairer than that. Would I come and look at it?\nAs I should not have been much the wiser if I _had_ looked at it, I\ndeclined, and said, \"Never mind fish.\" But Mrs. Crupp said, Don't say\nthat; oysters was in, and why not them? So _that_ was settled. Mrs.\nCrupp then said what she would recommend would be this. A pair of\nhot roast fowls--from the pastry-cook's; a dish of stewed beef, with\nvegetables--from the pastry-cook's; two little corner things, as a\nraised pie and a dish of kidneys--from the pastry-cook's; a tart, and\n(if I liked) a shape of jelly--from the pastry-cook's. This, Mrs. Crupp\nsaid, would leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind on the\npotatoes, and to serve up the cheese and celery as she could wish to\nsee it done.\n\nI acted on Mrs. Crupp's opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook's\nmyself. Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard\nmottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled\nmarble, but was labelled \"Mock Turtle,\" I went in and bought a slab of\nit, which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for\nfifteen people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, after some difficulty,\nconsented to warm up; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state, that we\nfound it what Steerforth called \"rather a tight fit\" for four.\n\nThese preparations happily completed, I bought a little dessert in\nCovent Garden Market, and gave a rather extensive order at a retail\nwine-merchant's in that vicinity. When I came home in the afternoon, and\nsaw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry-floor, they looked so\nnumerous (though there were two missing, which made Mrs. Crupp very\nuncomfortable), that I was absolutely frightened at them.\n\nOne of Steerforth's friends was named Grainger, and the other Markham.\nThey were both very gay and lively fellows; Grainger, something older\nthan Steerforth; Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say not more\nthan twenty. I observed that the latter always spoke of himself\nindefinitely, as \"a man,\" and seldom or never in the first person\nsingular.\n\n\"A man might get on very well here, Mr. Copperfield,\" said\nMarkham--meaning himself.\n\n\"It's not a bad situation,\" said I, \"and the rooms are really\ncommodious.\"\n\n\"I hope you have both brought appetites with you?\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Upon my honour,\" returned Markham, \"town seems to sharpen a man's\nappetite. A man is hungry all day long. A man is perpetually eating.\"\n\nBeing a little embarrassed at first, and feeling much too young to\npreside, I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was\nannounced, and seated myself opposite to him. Everything was very good;\nwe did not spare the wine; and he exerted himself so brilliantly to make\nthe thing pass off well, that there was no pause in our festivity. I was\nnot quite such good company during dinner, as I could have wished to be,\nfor my chair was opposite the door, and my attention was distracted by\nobserving that the handy young man went out of the room very often, and\nthat his shadow always presented itself, immediately afterwards, on the\nwall of the entry, with a bottle at its mouth. The \"young gal\" likewise\noccasioned me some uneasiness: not so much by neglecting to wash the\nplates, as by breaking them. For being of an inquisitive disposition,\nand unable to confine herself (as her positive instructions were) to the\npantry, she was constantly peering in at us, and constantly imagining\nherself detected; in which belief, she several times retired upon the\nplates (with which she had carefully paved the floor), and did a great\ndeal of destruction.\n\nThese, however, were small drawbacks, and easily forgotten when the\ncloth was cleared, and the dessert put on the table; at which period of\nthe entertainment the handy young man was discovered to be speechless.\nGiving him private directions to seek the society of Mrs. Crupp, and to\nremove the \"young gal\" to the basement also, I abandoned myself to\nenjoyment.\n\nI began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all sorts of\nhalf-forgotten things to talk about, came rushing into my mind, and made\nme hold forth in a most unwonted manner. I laughed heartily at my own\njokes, and everybody else's; called Steerforth to order for not passing\nthe wine; made several engagements to go to Oxford; announced that I\nmeant to have a dinner party exactly like that, once a week until\nfurther notice; and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger's box, that\nI was obliged to go into the pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing\nten minutes long.\n\nI went on, by passing the wine faster and faster yet, and continually\nstarting up with a corkscrew to open more wine, long before any was\nneeded. I proposed Steerforth's health. I said he was my dearest\nfriend, the protector of my boyhood, and the companion of my prime.\nI said I was delighted to propose his health. I said I owed him\nmore obligations than I could ever repay, and held him in a higher\nadmiration than I could ever express. I finished by saying, \"I'll give\nyou Steerforth! God bless him! Hurrah!\" We gave him three times three,\nand another, and a good one to finish with. I broke my glass in going\nround the table to shake hands with him, and I said (in two words)\n\"Steerforthyou'retheguidingstarofmyexist ence.\"\n\nI went on, by finding suddenly that somebody was in the middle of a\nsong. Markham was the singer, and he sang \"When the heart of a man is\ndepressed with care.\" He said, when he had sung it, he would give us\n\"Woman!\" I took objection to that, and I couldn't allow it. I said it\nwas not a respectful way of proposing the toast, and I would never\npermit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as \"The\nLadies!\" I was very high with him, mainly I think because I saw\nSteerforth and Grainger laughing at me--or at him--or at both of us. He\nsaid a man was not to be dictated to. I said a man _was_. He said a man\nwas not to be insulted, then. I said he was right there--never under my\nroof, where the Lares were sacred, and the laws of hospitality\nparamount. He said it was no derogation from a man's dignity to confess\nthat I was a devilish good fellow. I instantly proposed his health.\n\nSomebody was smoking. We were all smoking. _I_ was smoking, and trying\nto suppress a rising tendency to shudder. Steerforth had made a speech\nabout me, in the course of which I had been affected almost to tears.\nI returned thanks, and hoped the present company would dine with me\nto-morrow, and the day after--each day at five o'clock, that we might\nenjoy the pleasures of conversation and society through a long evening.\nI felt called upon to propose an individual. I would give them my aunt.\nMiss Betsey Trotwood, the best of her sex!\n\nSomebody was leaning out of my bed-room window, refreshing his forehead\nagainst the cool stone of the parapet, and feeling the air upon his\nface. It was myself. I was addressing myself as \"Copperfield,\" and\nsaying, \"Why did you try to smoke? You might have known you couldn't\ndo it.\" Now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the\nlooking-glass. That was I too. I was very pale in the looking-glass;\nmy eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair--only my hair, nothing\nelse--looked drunk.\n\nSomebody said to me, \"Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield!\" There was\nno bed-room before me, but again the jingling table covered with\nglasses; the lamp; Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my left, and\nSteerforth opposite--all sitting in a mist, and a long way off. The\ntheatre? To be sure. The very thing. Come along! But they must excuse me\nif I saw everybody out first, and turned the lamp off--in case of fire.\n\nOwing to some confusion in the dark, the door was gone. I was feeling\nfor it in the window-curtains, when Steerforth, laughing, took me by the\narm and led me out. We went down-stairs, one behind another. Near the\nbottom, somebody fell, and rolled down. Somebody else said it was\nCopperfield. I was angry at that false report, until, finding myself on\nmy back in the passage, I began to think there might be some foundation\nfor it.\n\nA very foggy night, with great rings round the lamps in the streets!\nThere was an indistinct talk of its being wet. _I_ considered it frosty.\nSteerforth dusted me under a lamp-post, and put my hat into shape, which\nsomebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary manner, for I\nhadn't had it on before. Steerforth then said, \"You are all right,\nCopperfield, are you not?\" and I told him, \"Neverberrer.\"\n\nA man, sitting in a pigeon-hole-place, looked out of the fog, and took\nmoney from somebody, inquiring if I was one of the gentlemen paid for,\nand appearing rather doubtful (as I remember in the glimpse I had of\nhim) whether to take the money for me or not. Shortly afterwards, we\nwere very high up in a very hot theatre, looking down into a large pit,\nthat seemed to me to smoke; the people with whom it was crammed were so\nindistinct. There was a great stage, too, looking very clean and smooth\nafter the streets; and there were people upon it, talking about\nsomething or other, but not at all intelligibly. There was an abundance\nof bright lights, and there was music, and there were ladies down in the\nboxes, and I don't know what more. The whole building looked to me, as\nif it were learning to swim; it conducted itself in such an\nunaccountable manner, when I tried to steady it.\n\nOn somebody's motion, we resolved to go down-stairs to the dress-boxes,\nwhere the ladies were. A gentleman lounging, full dressed, on a sofa,\nwith an opera-glass in his hand, passed before my view, and also my own\nfigure at full length in a glass. Then I was being ushered into one of\nthese boxes, and found myself saying something as I sat down, and people\nabout me crying \"Silence!\" to somebody, and ladies casting indignant\nglances at me, and--what! yes!--Agnes, sitting on the seat before me, in\nthe same box, with a lady and gentleman beside her, whom I didn't know.\nI see her face now, better than I did then I dare say, with its\nindelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me.\n\n\"Agnes!\" I said, thickly, \"Lorblessmer! Agnes!\"\n\n\"Hush! Pray!\" she answered, I could not conceive why. \"You disturb the\ncompany. Look at the stage!\"\n\nI tried, on her injunction, to fix it, and to hear something of what was\ngoing on there, but quite in vain. I looked at her again by-and-by, and\nsaw her shrink into her corner, and put her gloved hand to her forehead.\n\n\"Agnes!\" I said. \"I'mafraidyou'renorwell.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Do not mind me, Trotwood,\" she returned. \"Listen! Are you\ngoing away soon?\"\n\n\"Amigoarawaysoo?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI had a stupid intention of replying that I was going to wait, to hand\nher down-stairs. I suppose I expressed it, somehow; for after she had\nlooked at me attentively for a little while, she appeared to understand,\nand replied in a low tone:\n\n\"I know you will do as I ask you, if I tell you I am very earnest in it.\nGo away now, Trotwood, for my sake, and ask your friends to take you\nhome.\"\n\nShe had so far improved me, for the time, that though I was angry with\nher, I felt ashamed, and with a short \"Goori!\" (which I intended for\n\"Good night!\") got up and went away. They followed, and I stepped at\nonce out of the box-door into my bedroom, where only Steerforth was with\nme, helping me to undress, and where I was by turns telling him that\nAgnes was my sister, and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew, that I\nmight open another bottle of wine.\n\nHow somebody, lying in my bed, lay saying and doing all this over again,\nat cross purposes, in a feverish dream all night--the bed a rocking sea\nthat was never still! How, as that somebody slowly settled down into\nmyself, did I begin to parch, and feel as if my outer covering of skin\nwere a hard board; my tongue the bottom of an empty kettle, furred with\nlong service, and burning up over a slow fire; the palms of my hands,\nhot plates of metal which no ice could cool!\n\nBut the agony of mind, the remorse, and shame I felt, when I became\nconscious next day! My horror of having committed a thousand offences\nI had forgotten, and which nothing could ever expiate--my recollection\nof that indelible look which Agnes had given me--the torturing\nimpossibility of communicating with her, not knowing, Beast that I\nwas, how she came to be in London, or where she stayed--my disgust of\nthe very sight of the room where the revel had been held--my racking\nhead--the smell of smoke, the sight of glasses, the impossibility of\ngoing out, or even getting up! Oh, what a day it was!\n\nOh, what an evening, when I sat down by my fire to a basin of mutton\nbroth, dimpled all over with fat, and thought I was going the way of\nmy predecessor, and should succeed to his dismal story as well as\nto his chambers, and had half a mind to rush express to Dover and\nreveal all! What an evening, when Mrs. Crupp, coming in to take away\nthe broth-basin, produced one kidney on a cheese-plate as the entire\nremains of yesterday's feast, and I was really inclined to fall upon\nher nankeen breast, and say, in heartfelt penitence, \"Oh, Mrs. Crupp,\nMrs. Crupp, never mind the broken meats! I am very miserable!\"--only\nthat I doubted, even at that pass, if Mrs. Crupp were quite the sort of\nwoman to confide in!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nGOOD AND BAD ANGELS.\n\n\nI was going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day of\nheadache, sickness, and repentance, with an odd confusion in my mind\nrelative to the date of my dinner-party, as if a body of Titans had\ntaken an enormous lever and pushed the day before yesterday some months\nback, when I saw a ticket-porter coming up-stairs, with a letter in his\nhand. He was taking his time about his errand, then; but when he saw me\non the top of the staircase, looking at him over the bannisters, he\nswung into a trot, and came up panting as if he had run himself into a\nstate of exhaustion.\n\n\"T. Copperfield, Esquire,\" said the ticket-porter, touching his hat with\nhis little cane.\n\nI could scarcely lay claim to the name: I was so disturbed by the\nconviction that the letter came from Agnes. However, I told him I was T.\nCopperfield, Esquire, and he believed it, and gave me the letter, which\nhe said required an answer. I shut him out on the landing to wait for\nthe answer, and went into my chambers again, in such a nervous state\nthat I was fain to lay the letter down on my breakfast-table, and\nfamiliarise myself with the outside of it a little, before I could\nresolve to break the seal.\n\nI found, when I did open it, that it was a very kind note, containing no\nreference to my condition at the theatre. All it said, was, \"My dear\nTrotwood. I am staying at the house of papa's agent, Mr. Waterbrook, in\nEly-place, Holborn. Will you come and see me to-day, at any time you\nlike to appoint? Ever yours affectionately, AGNES.\"\n\nIt took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my\nsatisfaction, that I don't know what the ticket-porter can have thought,\nunless he thought I was learning to write. I must have written half a\ndozen answers at least. I began one, \"How can I ever hope, my dear\nAgnes, to efface from your remembrance the disgusting impression\"--there\nI didn't like it, and then I tore it up. I began another, \"Shakspeare\nhas observed, my dear Agnes, how strange it is that a man should put an\nenemy into his mouth\"--that reminded me of Markham, and it got no\nfarther. I even tried poetry. I began one note, in a six-syllable line,\n\"Oh do not remember\"--but that associated itself with the fifth of\nNovember, and became an absurdity. After many attempts, I wrote, \"My\ndear Agnes. Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that\nwould be higher praise than that? I will come at four o'clock.\nAffectionately and sorrowfully, T. C.\" With this missive (which I was in\ntwenty minds at once about recalling, as soon as it was out of my\nhands), the ticket-porter at last departed.\n\nIf the day were half as tremendous to any other professional gentleman\nin Doctors' Commons as it was to me, I sincerely believe he made some\nexpiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese.\nAlthough I left the office at half-past three, and was prowling about\nthe place of appointment within a few minutes afterwards, the appointed\ntime was exceeded by a full quarter of an hour, according to the\nclock of St. Andrew's, Holborn, before I could muster up sufficient\ndesperation to pull the private bell-handle let into the left-hand\ndoor-post of Mr. Waterbrook's house.\n\nThe professional business of Mr. Waterbrook's establishment was done on\nthe ground-floor, and the genteel business (of which there was a good\ndeal) in the upper part of the building. I was shown into a pretty but\nrather close drawing-room, and there sat Agnes, netting a purse.\n\nShe looked so quiet and good, and reminded me so strongly of my airy\nfresh school days at Canterbury, and the sodden, smoky, stupid wretch\nI had been the other night, that, nobody being by, I yielded to my\nself-reproach and shame, and--in short, made a fool of myself. I cannot\ndeny that I shed tears. To this hour I am undecided whether it was upon\nthe whole the wisest thing I could have done, or the most ridiculous.\n\n\"If it had been any one but you, Agnes,\" said I, turning away my head,\n\"I should not have minded it half so much. But that it should have been\nyou who saw me! I almost wish I had been dead, first.\"\n\nShe put her hand--its touch was like no other hand--upon my arm for a\nmoment; and I felt so befriended and comforted, that I could not help\nmoving it to my lips, and gratefully kissing it.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Agnes, cheerfully. \"Don't be unhappy, Trotwood. If you\ncannot confidently trust me, whom will you trust?\"\n\n\"Ah, Agnes!\" I returned. \"You are my good Angel!\"\n\nShe smiled rather sadly, I thought, and shook her head.\n\n\"Yes, Agnes, my good Angel! Always my good Angel!\"\n\n\"If I were, indeed, Trotwood,\" she returned, \"there is one thing that I\nshould set my heart on very much.\"\n\nI looked at her inquiringly; but already with a foreknowledge of her\nmeaning.\n\n\"On warning you,\" said Agnes, with a steady glance, \"against your bad\nAngel.\"\n\n\"My dear Agnes,\" I began, \"if you mean Steerforth--\"\n\n\"I do, Trotwood,\" she returned.\n\n\"Then, Agnes, you wrong him very much. He my bad Angel, or anyone's! He,\nanything but a guide, a support, and a friend to me! My dear Agnes! Now,\nis it not unjust, and unlike you, to judge him from what you saw of me\nthe other night?\"\n\n\"I do not judge him from what I saw of you the other night,\" she quietly\nreplied.\n\n\"From what, then?\"\n\n\"From many things--trifles in themselves, but they do not seem to me to\nbe so, when they are put together. I judge him, partly from your account\nof him, Trotwood, and your character, and the influence he has over\nyou.\"\n\nThere was always something in her modest voice that seemed to touch a\nchord within me, answering to that sound alone. It was always earnest;\nbut when it was very earnest, as it was now, there was a thrill in it\nthat quite subdued me. I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on\nher work; I sat seeming still to listen to her; and Steerforth, in spite\nof all my attachment to him, darkened in that tone.\n\n\"It is very bold in me,\" said Agnes, looking up again, \"who have lived\nin such seclusion, and can know so little of the world, to give you my\nadvice so confidently, or even to have this strong opinion. But I know\nin what it is engendered, Trotwood,--in how true a remembrance of our\nhaving grown up together, and in how true an interest in all relating to\nyou. It is that which makes me bold. I am certain that what I say is\nright. I am quite sure it is. I feel as if it were some one else\nspeaking to you, and not I, when I caution you that you have made a\ndangerous friend.\"\n\nAgain I looked at her, again I listened to her after she was silent, and\nagain his image, though it was still fixed in my heart, darkened.\n\n\"I am not so unreasonable as to expect,\" said Agnes, resuming her usual\ntone, after a little while, \"that you will, or that you can, at once,\nchange any sentiment that has become a conviction to you; least of all a\nsentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition. You ought not\nhastily to do that. I only ask you, Trotwood, if you ever think of me--I\nmean\" with a quiet smile, for I was going to interrupt her, and she knew\nwhy \"as often as you think of me--to think of what I have said. Do you\nforgive me for all this?\"\n\n\"I will forgive you, Agnes,\" I replied, \"when you come to do Steerforth\njustice, and to like him as well as I do.\"\n\n\"Not until then?\" said Agnes.\n\nI saw a passing shadow on her face when I made this mention of him, but\nshe returned my smile, and we were again as unreserved in our mutual\nconfidence as of old.\n\n\"And when, Agnes,\" said I, \"will you forgive me the other night?\"\n\n\"When I recall it,\" said Agnes.\n\nShe would have dismissed the subject so, but I was too full of it to\nallow that, and insisted on telling her how it happened that I had\ndisgraced myself, and what chain of accidental circumstances had had the\ntheatre for its final link. It was a great relief to me to do this, and\nto enlarge on the obligation that I owed to Steerforth for his care of\nme when I was unable to take care of myself.\n\n\"You must not forget,\" said Agnes, calmly changing the conversation as\nsoon as I had concluded, \"that you are always to tell me, not only when\nyou fall into trouble, but when you fall in love. Who has succeeded to\nMiss Larkins, Trotwood?\"\n\n\"No one, Agnes.\"\n\n\"Some one, Trotwood,\" said Agnes, laughing, and holding up her finger.\n\n\"No, Agnes, upon my word! There is a lady, certainly, at Mrs.\nSteerforth's house, who is very clever, and whom I like to talk to--Miss\nDartle--but I don't adore her.\"\n\nAgnes laughed again at her own penetration, and told me that if I were\nfaithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little\nregister of my violent attachments, with the date, duration, and\ntermination of each, like the table of the reigns of the kings and\nqueens, in the History of England. Then she asked me if I had seen\nUriah.\n\n\"Uriah Heep?\" said I. \"No. Is he in London?\"\n\n\"He comes to the office down-stairs, every day,\" returned Agnes. \"He was\nin London a week before me. I am afraid on disagreeable business,\nTrotwood.\"\n\n\"On some business that makes you uneasy, Agnes, I see,\" said I. \"What\ncan that be?\"\n\nAgnes laid aside her work, and replied, folding her hands upon one\nanother, and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of\nhers:\n\n\"I believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa.\"\n\n\"What? Uriah? That mean, fawning fellow, worm himself into such\npromotion?\" I cried, indignantly. \"Have you made no remonstrance about\nit, Agnes? Consider what a connexion it is likely to be. You must speak\nout. You must not allow your father to take such a mad step. You must\nprevent it, Agnes, while there's time.\"\n\nStill looking at me, Agnes shook her head while I was speaking, with a\nfaint smile at my warmth: and then replied:\n\n\"You remember our last conversation about papa? It was not long after\nthat--not more than two or three days--when he gave me the first\nintimation of what I tell you. It was sad to see him struggling between\nhis desire to represent it to me as a matter of choice on his part, and\nhis inability to conceal that it was forced upon him. I felt very\nsorry.\"\n\n\"Forced upon him, Agnes! Who forces it upon him?\"\n\n\"Uriah,\" she replied, after a moment's hesitation, \"has made himself\nindispensable to papa. He is subtle and watchful. He has mastered papa's\nweaknesses, fostered them, and taken advantage of them, until--to say\nall that I mean in a word, Trotwood, until papa is afraid of him.\"\n\nThere was more that she might have said; more that she knew, or that she\nsuspected; I clearly saw. I could not give her pain by asking what it\nwas, for I knew that she withheld it from me, to spare her father. It\nhad long been going on to this, I was sensible: yes, I could not but\nfeel, on the least reflection, that it had been going on to this for a\nlong time. I remained silent.\n\n\"His ascendancy over papa,\" said Agnes, \"is very great. He professes\nhumility and gratitude--with truth, perhaps: I hope so--but his position\nis really one of power, and I fear he makes a hard use of his power.\"\n\nI said he was a hound, which, at the moment, was a great satisfaction to\nme.\n\n\"At the time I speak of, as the time when papa spoke to me,\" pursued\nAgnes, \"he had told papa that he was going away; that he was very sorry,\nand unwilling to leave, but that he had better prospects. Papa was very\nmuch depressed then, and more bowed down by care than ever you or I have\nseen him; but he seemed relieved by this expedient of the partnership,\nthough at the same time he seemed hurt by it and ashamed of it.\"\n\n\"And how did you receive it, Agnes?\"\n\n\"I did, Trotwood,\" she replied, \"what I hope was right. Feeling sure\nthat it was necessary for papa's peace that the sacrifice should be\nmade, I entreated him to make it. I said it would lighten the load of\nhis life--I hope it will!--and that it would give me increased\nopportunities of being his companion. Oh, Trotwood!\" cried Agnes,\nputting her hands before her face, as her tears started on it, \"I almost\nfeel as if I had been papa's enemy, instead of his loving child. For I\nknow how he has altered, in his devotion to me. I know how he has\nnarrowed the circle of his sympathies and duties, in the concentration\nof his whole mind upon me. I know what a multitude of things he has shut\nout for my sake, and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his\nlife, and weakened his strength and energy, by turning them always upon\none idea. If I could ever set this right! If I could ever work out his\nrestoration, as I have so innocently been the cause of his decline!\"\n\nI had never before seen Agnes cry. I had seen tears in her eyes when I\nhad brought new honours home from school, and I had seen them there when\nwe last spoke about her father, and I had seen her turn her gentle head\naside when we took leave of one another; but I had never seen her grieve\nlike this. It made me so sorry that I could only say, in a foolish,\nhelpless manner, \"Pray, Agnes, don't! Don't, my dear sister!\"\n\nBut Agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose, as I know\nwell now, whatever I might know or not know then, to be long in need of\nmy entreaties. The beautiful, calm manner, which makes her so different\nin my remembrance from everybody else, came back again, as if a cloud\nhad passed from a serene sky.\n\n\"We are not likely to remain alone much longer,\" said Agnes, \"and while\nI have an opportunity, let me earnestly entreat you, Trotwood, to be\nfriendly to Uriah. Don't repel him. Don't resent (as I think you have a\ngeneral disposition to do) what may be uncongenial to you in him. He may\nnot deserve it, for we know no certain ill of him. In any case, think\nfirst of papa and me!\"\n\nAgnes had no time to say more, for the room-door opened, and Mrs.\nWaterbrook, who was a large lady--or who wore a large dress: I don't\nexactly know which, for I don't know which was dress and which was\nlady--came sailing in. I had a dim recollection of having seen her at\nthe theatre, as if I had seen her in a pale magic lantern; but she\nappeared to remember me perfectly, and still to suspect me of being in\na state of intoxication.\n\nFinding by degrees, however, that I was sober, and (I hope) that I was a\nmodest young gentleman, Mrs. Waterbrook softened towards me\nconsiderably, and inquired, firstly, if I went much into the parks, and\nsecondly, if I went much into society. On my replying to both these\nquestions in the negative, it occurred to me that I fell again in her\ngood opinion; but she concealed the fact gracefully, and invited me to\ndinner next day. I accepted the invitation, and took my leave; making a\ncall on Uriah in the office as I went out, and leaving a card for him in\nhis absence.\n\nWhen I went to dinner next day, and, on the street-door being opened,\nplunged into a vapour-bath of haunch of mutton, I divined that I was not\nthe only guest; for I immediately identified the ticket-porter in\ndisguise, assisting the family servant, and waiting at the foot of the\nstairs to carry up my name. He looked, to the best of his ability, when\nhe asked me for it confidentially, as if he had never seen me before;\nbut well did I know him, and well did he know me. Conscience made\ncowards of us both.\n\nI found Mr. Waterbrook to be a middle-aged gentleman, with a short\nthroat, and a good deal of shirt-collar, who only wanted a black nose to\nbe the portrait of a pug-dog. He told me he was happy to have the honour\nof making my acquaintance; and when I had paid my homage to Mrs.\nWaterbrook, presented me, with much ceremony, to a very awful lady in a\nblack velvet dress, and a great black velvet hat, whom I remember as\nlooking like a near relation of Hamlet's--say his aunt.\n\nMrs. Henry Spiker was this lady's name; and her husband was there too:\nso cold a man, that his head, instead of being grey, seemed to be\nsprinkled with hoar-frost. Immense deference was shown to the Henry\nSpikers, male and female; which Agnes told me was on account of Mr.\nHenry Spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody, I forget what\nor which, remotely connected with the Treasury.\n\nI found Uriah Heep among the company, in a suit of black, and in deep\nhumility. He told me, when I shook hands with him, that he was proud to\nbe noticed by me, and that he really felt obliged to me for my\ncondescension. I could have wished he had been less obliged to me, for\nhe hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening; and\nwhenever I said a word to Agnes, was sure, with his shadowless eyes and\ncadaverous face, to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind.\n\n  [Illustration: Uriah persists in hovering near us, at the dinner\n  party.]\n\nThere were other guests--all iced for the occasion, as it struck me,\nlike the wine. But, there was one who attracted my attention before he\ncame in, on account of my hearing him announced as Mr. Traddles! My mind\nflew back to Salem House; and could it be Tommy, I thought, who used to\ndraw the skeletons!\n\nI looked for Mr. Traddles with unusual interest. He was a sober,\nsteady-looking young man of retiring manners, with a comic head of\nhair, and eyes that were rather wide open; and he got into an obscure\ncorner so soon, that I had some difficulty in making him out. At length\nI had a good view of him, and either my vision deceived me, or it was\nthe old unfortunate Tommy.\n\nI made my way to Mr. Waterbrook, and said, that I believed I had the\npleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Waterbrook, surprised. \"You are too young to have\nbeen at school with Mr. Henry Spiker?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean him!\" I returned. \"I mean the gentleman named\nTraddles.\"\n\n\"Oh! Aye, aye! Indeed!\" said my host, with much diminished interest.\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"If it's really the same person,\" said I, glancing towards him, \"it was\nat a place called Salem House where we were together, and he was an\nexcellent fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Traddles is a good fellow,\" returned my host, nodding his head\nwith an air of toleration. \"Traddles is quite a good fellow.\"\n\n\"It's a curious coincidence,\" said I.\n\n\"It is really,\" returned my host, \"quite a coincidence, that Traddles\nshould be here at all: as Traddles was only invited this morning, when\nthe place at table, intended to be occupied by Mrs. Henry Spiker's\nbrother, became vacant, in consequence of his indisposition. A very\ngentlemanly man, Mrs. Henry Spiker's brother, Mr. Copperfield.\"\n\nI murmured an assent, which was full of feeling, considering that I knew\nnothing at all about him; and I inquired what Mr. Traddles was by\nprofession.\n\n\"Traddles,\" returned Mr. Waterbrook, \"is a young man reading for the\nbar. Yes. He is quite a good fellow--nobody's enemy but his own.\"\n\n\"Is he his own enemy?\" said I, sorry to hear this.\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Waterbrook, pursing up his mouth, and playing with\nhis watch-chain, in a comfortable, prosperous sort of way. \"I should say\nhe was one of those men who stand in their own light. Yes, I should say\nhe would never, for example, be worth five hundred pound. Traddles was\nrecommended to me, by a professional friend. Oh yes. Yes. He has a kind\nof talent, for drawing briefs, and stating a case in writing, plainly. I\nam able to throw something in Traddles's way, in the course of the year;\nsomething--for him--considerable. Oh yes. Yes.\"\n\nI was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied manner,\nin which Mr. Waterbrook delivered himself of this little word \"Yes,\"\nevery now and then. There was wonderful expression in it. It completely\nconveyed the idea of a man who had been born, not to say with a silver\nspoon, but with a scaling-ladder, and had gone on mounting all the\nheights of life one after another, until now he looked, from the top of\nthe fortifications, with the eye of a philosopher and a patron, on the\npeople down in the trenches.\n\nMy reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was\nannounced. Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet's aunt. Mr. Henry Spiker\ntook Mrs. Waterbrook. Agnes, whom I should have liked to take myself,\nwas given to a simpering fellow with weak legs. Uriah, Traddles, and I,\nas the junior part of the company, went down last, how we could. I was\nnot so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been since it gave me an\nopportunity of making myself known to Traddles on the stairs, who\ngreeted me with great fervor: while Uriah writhed with such obtrusive\nsatisfaction and self-abasement, that I could gladly have pitched him\nover the bannisters.\n\nTraddles and I were separated at table, being billeted in two remote\ncorners: he in the glare of a red velvet lady; I, in the gloom of\nHamlet's aunt. The dinner was very long, and the conversation was about\nthe Aristocracy--and Blood. Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us, that if\nshe had a weakness, it was Blood.\n\nIt occurred to me several times that we should have got on better, if we\nhad not been quite so genteel. We were so exceedingly genteel, that our\nscope was very limited. A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party, who\nhad something to do at second-hand (at least, Mr. Gulpidge had) with the\nlaw business of the Bank; and what with the Bank, and what with the\nTreasury, we were as exclusive as the Court Circular. To mend the\nmatter, Hamlet's aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy,\nand held forth in a desultory manner, by herself, on every topic that\nwas introduced. These were few enough, to be sure; but as we always fell\nback upon Blood, she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her\nnephew himself.\n\nWe might have been a party of Ogres, the conversation assumed such a\nsanguine complexion.\n\n\"I confess I am of Mrs. Waterbrook's opinion,\" said Mr. Waterbrook, with\nhis wine-glass at his eye. \"Other things are all very well in their way,\nbut give me Blood!\"\n\n\"Oh! There is nothing,\" observed Hamlet's aunt, \"so satisfactory to one!\nThere is nothing that is so much one's _beau-ideal_ of--of all that sort\nof thing, speaking generally. There are some low minds (not many, I am\nhappy to believe, but there are _some_) that would prefer to do what _I_\nshould call bow down before idols. Positively Idols! Before services,\nintellect, and so on. But these are intangible points. Blood is not so.\nWe see Blood in a nose, and we know it. We meet with it in a chin, and\nwe say, 'There it is! That's Blood!' It is an actual matter of fact. We\npoint it out. It admits of no doubt.\"\n\nThe simpering fellow with the weak legs, who had taken Agnes down,\nstated the question more decisively yet, I thought.\n\n\"Oh, you know, deuce take it,\" said this gentleman, looking round the\nboard with an imbecile smile, \"we can't forego Blood, you know. We must\nhave Blood, you know. Some young fellows, you know, may be a little\nbehind their station, perhaps, in point of education and behaviour, and\nmay go a little wrong, you know, and get themselves and other people\ninto a variety of fixes--and all that--but deuce take it, it's\ndelightful to reflect that they've got Blood in 'em! Myself, I'd rather\nat any time be knocked down by a man who had got Blood in him, than I'd\nbe picked up by a man who hadn't!\"\n\nThis sentiment, as compressing the general question into a nutshell,\ngave the utmost satisfaction, and brought the gentleman into great\nnotice until the ladies retired. After that, I observed that Mr.\nGulpidge and Mr. Henry Spiker, who had hitherto been very distant,\nentered into a defensive alliance against us, the common enemy, and\nexchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat and\noverthrow.\n\n\"That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has\nnot taken the course that was expected, Gulpidge,\" said Mr. Henry\nSpiker.\n\n\"Do you mean the D. of A.'s?\" said Mr. Spiker.\n\n\"The C. of B.'s?\" said Mr. Gulpidge.\n\nMr. Spiker raised his eye-brows, and looked much concerned.\n\n\"When the question was referred to Lord--I needn't name him,\" said Mr.\nGulpidge, checking himself--\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mr. Spiker, \"N.\"\n\nMr. Gulpidge darkly nodded--\"was referred to him, his answer was,\n'Money, or no release.'\"\n\n\"Lord bless my soul!\" cried Mr. Spiker.\n\n\"'Money, or no release,'\" repeated Mr. Gulpidge firmly. \"The next in\nreversion--you understand me?\"\n\n\"K.\" said Mr. Spiker, with an ominous look.\n\n\"--K. then positively refused to sign. He was attended at Newmarket for\nthat purpose, and he point-blank refused to do it.\"\n\nMr. Spiker was so interested, that he became quite stony.\n\n\"So the matter rests at this hour,\" said Mr. Gulpidge, throwing himself\nback in his chair. \"Our friend Waterbrook will excuse me if I forbear to\nexplain myself generally, on account of the magnitude of the interests\ninvolved.\"\n\nMr. Waterbrook was only too happy, as it appeared to me, to have such\ninterests, and such names, even hinted at, across his table. He assumed\nan expression of gloomy intelligence (though I am persuaded he knew no\nmore about the discussion than I did), and highly approved of the\ndiscretion that had been observed. Mr. Spiker, after the receipt of such\na confidence, naturally desired to favor his friend with a confidence of\nhis own; therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another, in\nwhich it was Mr. Gulpidge's turn to be surprised, and that by another in\nwhich the surprise came round to Mr. Spiker's turn again, and so on,\nturn and turn about. All this time we, the outsiders, remained oppressed\nby the tremendous interests involved in the conversation; and our host\nregarded us with pride, as the victims of a salutary awe and\nastonishment.\n\nI was very glad indeed to get up-stairs to Agnes, and to talk with her\nin a corner, and to introduce Traddles to her, who was shy, but\nagreeable, and the same good-natured creature still. As he was obliged\nto leave early, on account of going away next morning for a month, I had\nnot nearly so much conversation with him as I could have wished; but we\nexchanged addresses, and promised ourselves the pleasure of another\nmeeting when he should come back to town. He was greatly interested to\nhear that I knew Steerforth, and spoke of him with such warmth that I\nmade him tell Agnes what he thought of him. But Agnes only looked at me\nthe while, and very slightly shook her head when only I observed her.\n\nAs she was not among people with whom I believed she could be very much\nat home, I was almost glad to hear that she was going away within a few\ndays, though I was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again so\nsoon. This caused me to remain until all the company were gone.\nConversing with her, and hearing her sing, was such a delightful\nreminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so\nbeautiful, that I could have remained there half the night; but, having\nno excuse for staying any longer, when the lights of Mr. Waterbrook's\nsociety were all snuffed out, I took my leave very much against my\ninclination. I felt then, more than ever, that she was my better Angel;\nand if I thought of her sweet face and placid smile, as though they had\nshone on me from some removed being, like an Angel, I hope I thought no\nharm.\n\nI have said that the company were all gone; but I ought to have excepted\nUriah, whom I don't include in that denomination, and who had never\nceased to hover near us. He was close behind me when I went down-stairs.\nHe was close beside me, when I walked away from the house, slowly\nfitting his long skeleton fingers into the still longer fingers of a\ngreat Guy Fawkes pair of gloves.\n\nIt was in no disposition for Uriah's company, but in remembrance of the\nentreaty Agnes had made to me, that I asked him if he would come home to\nmy rooms, and have some coffee.\n\n\"Oh, really, Master Copperfield,\" he rejoined,--\"I beg your pardon,\nMister Copperfield, but the other comes so natural,--I don't like that\nyou should put a constraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like me\nto your ouse.\"\n\n\"There is no constraint in the case,\" said I. \"Will you come?\"\n\n\"I should like to, very much,\" replied Uriah, with a writhe.\n\n\"Well, then, come along!\" said I.\n\nI could not help being rather short with him, but he appeared not to\nmind it. We went the nearest way, without conversing much upon the road;\nand he was so humble in respect of those scarecrow gloves, that he was\nstill putting them on, and seemed to have made no advance in that\nlabour, when we got to my place.\n\nI led him up the dark stairs, to prevent his knocking his head against\nanything, and really his damp cold hand felt so like a frog in mine,\nthat I was tempted to drop it and run away. Agnes and hospitality\nprevailed, however, and I conducted him to my fireside. When I lighted\nmy candles, he fell into meek transports with the room that was revealed\nto him; and when I heated the coffee in an unassuming block-tin vessel,\nin which Mrs. Crupp delighted to prepare it (chiefly, I believe, because\nit was not intended for the purpose, being a shaving-pot, and because\nthere was a patent invention of great price mouldering away in the\npantry), he professed so much emotion, that I could joyfully have\nscalded him.\n\n\"Oh, really, Master Copperfield,--I mean Mister Copperfield,\" said\nUriah, \"to see you waiting upon me is what I never could have expected!\nBut, one way and another, so many things happen to me which I never\ncould have expected, I am sure, in my umble station, that it seems to\nrain blessings on my ed. You have heard something, I des-say, of a\nchange in my expectations, Master Copperfield,--_I_ should say, Mister\nCopperfield?\"\n\nAs he sat on my sofa, with his long knees drawn up under his coffee-cup,\nhis hat and gloves upon the ground close to him, his spoon going softly\nround and round, his shadowless red eyes, which looked as if they had\nscorched their lashes off, turned towards me without looking at me, the\ndisagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming and\ngoing with his breath, and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from\nhis chin to his boots, I decided in my own mind that I disliked him\nintensely. It made me very uncomfortable to have him for a guest, for I\nwas young then, and unused to disguise what I so strongly felt.\n\n\"You have heard something, I des-say, of a change in my expectations,\nMaster Copperfield,--I should say, Mister Copperfield?\" observed Uriah.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"something.\"\n\n\"Ah! I thought Miss Agnes would know of it!\" he quietly returned. \"I'm\nglad to find Miss Agnes knows of it. Oh, thank you, Master--Mister\nCopperfield!\"\n\nI could have thrown my bootjack at him (it lay ready on the rug), for\nhaving entrapped me into the disclosure of anything concerning Agnes,\nhowever immaterial. But I only drank my coffee.\n\n\"What a prophet you have shown yourself, Mister Copperfield!\" pursued\nUriah. \"Dear me, what a prophet you have proved yourself to be! Don't\nyou remember saying to me once, that perhaps I should be a partner in\nMr. Wickfield's business, and perhaps it might be Wickfield and Heep!\n_You_ may not recollect it; but when a person is umble, Master\nCopperfield, a person treasures such things up!\"\n\n\"I recollect talking about it,\" said I, \"though I certainly did not\nthink it very likely then.\"\n\n\"Oh! who _would_ have thought it likely, Mister Copperfield!\" returned\nUriah, enthusiastically, \"I am sure I didn't myself. I recollect saying\nwith my own lips that I was much too umble. So I considered myself\nreally and truly.\"\n\nHe sat, with that carved grin on his face, looking at the fire, as I\nlooked at him.\n\n\"But the umblest persons, Master Copperfield,\" he presently resumed,\n\"may be the instruments of good. I am glad to think I have been the\ninstrument of good to Mr. Wickfield, and that I may be more so. Oh what\na worthy man he is, Mister Copperfield, but how imprudent he has been!\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it,\" said I. I could not help adding, rather\npointedly, \"on all accounts.\"\n\n\"Decidedly so, Mister Copperfield,\" replied Uriah. \"On all accounts.\nMiss Agnes's above all! You don't remember your own eloquent\nexpressions, Master Copperfield; but _I_ remember how you said one day\nthat everybody must admire her, and how I thanked you for it! You have\nforgot that, I have no doubt, Master Copperfield?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, drily.\n\n\"Oh how glad I am, you have not!\" exclaimed Uriah. \"To think that you\nshould be the first to kindle the sparks of ambition in my umble breast,\nand that you've not forgot it! Oh!--Would you excuse me asking for a cup\nmore coffee?\"\n\nSomething in the emphasis he laid upon the kindling of those sparks, and\nsomething in the glance he directed at me as he said it, had made me\nstart as if I had seen him illuminated by a blaze of light. Recalled by\nhis request, preferred in quite another tone of voice, I did the honors\nof the shaving-pot; but I did them with an unsteadiness of hand, a\nsudden sense of being no match for him, and a perplexed suspicious\nanxiety as to what he might be going to say next, which I felt could not\nescape his observation.\n\nHe said nothing at all. He stirred his coffee round and round, he sipped\nit, he felt his chin softly with his grisly hand, he looked at the fire,\nhe looked about the room, he gasped rather than smiled at me, he writhed\nand undulated about, in his deferential servility, he stirred and sipped\nagain, but he left the renewal of the conversation to me.\n\n\"So, Mr. Wickfield,\" said I, at last, \"who is worth five hundred of\nyou--or me;\" for my life, I think I could not have helped dividing that\npart of the sentence with an awkward jerk; \"has been imprudent, has he,\nMr. Heep?\"\n\n\"Oh very imprudent indeed, Master Copperfield,\" returned Uriah, sighing\nmodestly. \"Oh very much so! But I wish you'd call me Uriah, if you\nplease. It's like old times.\"\n\n\"Well! Uriah,\" said I, bolting it out with some difficulty.\n\n\"Thank you!\" he returned, with fervor. \"Thank you, Master Copperfield!\nIt's like the blowing of old breezes or the ringing of old bellses to\nhear _you_ say Uriah. I beg your pardon. Was I making any observation?\"\n\n\"About Mr. Wickfield,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Oh! Yes, truly,\" said Uriah. \"Ah! Great imprudence, Master Copperfield.\nIt's a topic that I wouldn't touch upon, to any soul but you. Even to\nyou I can only touch upon it, and no more. If any one else had been in\nmy place during the last few years, by this time he would have had Mr.\nWickfield (oh, what a worthy man he is, Master Copperfield, too!) under\nhis thumb. Un--der--his thumb,\" said Uriah, very slowly, as he stretched\nout his cruel-looking hand above my table, and pressed his own thumb\ndown upon it, until it shook, and shook the room.\n\nIf I had been obliged to look at him with his splay foot on Mr.\nWickfield's head, I think I could scarcely have hated him more.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes, Master Copperfield,\" he proceeded, in a soft voice, most\nremarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb, which did not\ndiminish its hard pressure in the least degree, \"there's no doubt of it.\nThere would have been loss, disgrace, I don't know what all. Mr.\nWickfield knows it. I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him, and\nhe puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach. How\nthankful should I be!\" With his face turned towards me, as he finished,\nbut without looking at me, he took his crooked thumb off the spot where\nhe had planted it, and slowly and thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw with\nit, as if he were shaving himself.\n\nI recollect well how indignantly my heart beat, as I saw his crafty\nface, with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it, preparing\nfor something else.\n\n\"Master Copperfield,\" he began--\"but am I keeping you up?\"\n\n\"You are not keeping me up. I generally go to bed late.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Master Copperfield! I have risen from my umble station since\nfirst you used to address me, it is true; but I am umble still. I hope I\nnever shall be otherwise than umble. You will not think the worse of my\numbleness, if I make a little confidence to you, Master Copperfield?\nWill you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said I, with an effort.\n\n\"Thank you!\" He took out his pocket-handkerchief, and began wiping the\npalms of his hands. \"Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield--\"\n\n\"Well, Uriah?\"\n\n\"Oh, how pleasant to be called Uriah, spontaneously!\" he cried; and gave\nhimself a jerk, like a convulsive fish. \"You thought her looking very\nbeautiful to-night, Master Copperfield?\"\n\n\"I thought her looking as she always does: superior, in all respects, to\nevery one around her,\" I returned.\n\n\"Oh, thank you! It's so true!\" he cried. \"Oh, thank you very much for\nthat!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" I said, loftily. \"There is no reason why you should thank\nme.\"\n\n\"Why that, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah, \"is, in fact, the confidence\nthat I am going to take the liberty of reposing. Umble as I am,\" he\nwiped his hands harder, and looked at them and at the fire by turns,\n\"umble as my mother is, and lowly as our poor but honest roof has ever\nbeen, the image of Miss Agnes (I don't mind trusting you with my secret,\nMaster Copperfield, for I have always overflowed towards you since the\nfirst moment I had the pleasure of beholding you in a poney-shay) has\nbeen in my breast for years. Oh, Master Copperfield, with what a pure\naffection do I love the ground my Agnes walks on!\"\n\nI believe I had a delirious idea of seizing the red-hot poker out of the\nfire, and running him through with it. It went from me with a shock,\nlike a ball fired from a rifle: but the image of Agnes, outraged by so\nmuch as a thought of this red-headed animal's, remained in my mind when\nI looked at him, sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body,\nand made me giddy. He seemed to swell and grow before my eyes; the room\nseemed full of the echoes of his voice; and the strange feeling (to\nwhich, perhaps, no one is quite a stranger) that all this had occurred\nbefore, at some indefinite time, and that I knew what he was going to\nsay next, took possession of me.\n\nA timely observation of the sense of power that there was in his face,\ndid more to bring back to my remembrance the entreaty of Agnes, in its\nfull force, than any effort I could have made. I asked him, with a\nbetter appearance of composure than I could have thought possible a\nminute before, whether he had made his feelings known to Agnes.\n\n\"Oh, no, Master Copperfield!\" he returned; \"oh dear, no! Not to any one\nbut you. You see I am only just emerging from my lowly station. I rest a\ngood deal of hope on her observing how useful I am to her father (for I\ntrust to be very useful to him, indeed, Master Copperfield), and how I\nsmooth the way for him, and keep him straight. She's so much attached to\nher father, Master Copperfield (oh what a lovely thing it is in a\ndaughter!), that I think she may come, on his account, to be kind to\nme.\"\n\nI fathomed the depth of the rascal's whole scheme, and understood why he\nlaid it bare.\n\n\"If you'll have the goodness to keep my secret, Master Copperfield,\" he\npursued, \"and not, in general, to go against me, I shall take it as a\nparticular favor. You wouldn't wish to make unpleasantness. I know what\na friendly heart you've got; but having only known me on my umble\nfooting (on my umblest, I should say, for I am very umble still), you\nmight, unbeknown, go against me rather, with my Agnes. I call her mine,\nyou see, Master Copperfield. There's a song that says, 'I'd crowns\nresign, to call her mine!' I hope to do it, one of these days.\"\n\nDear Agnes! So much too loving and too good for any one that I could\nthink of, was it possible that she was reserved to be the wife of such a\nwretch as this!\n\n\"There's no hurry at present, you know, Master Copperfield,\" Uriah\nproceeded, in his slimy way, as I sat gazing at him, with this thought\nin my mind. \"My Agnes is very young still; and mother and me will have\nto work our way upards, and make a good many new arrangements, before it\nwould be quite convenient. So I shall have time gradually to make her\nfamiliar with my hopes, as opportunities offer. Oh, I'm so much obliged\nto you for this confidence! Oh, it's such a relief, you can't think, to\nknow that you understand our situation, and are certain (as you wouldn't\nwish to make unpleasantness in the family) not to go against me!\"\n\nHe took the hand which I dared not withhold, and having given it a damp\nsqueeze, referred to his pale-faced watch.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he said, \"it's past one. The moments slip away so, in the\nconfidence of old times, Master Copperfield, that it's almost half-past\none!\"\n\nI answered that I had thought it was later. Not that I had really\nthought so, but because my conversational powers were effectually\nscattered.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he said, considering. \"The ouse that I am stopping at--a sort\nof a private hotel and boarding ouse, Master Copperfield, near the New\nRiver ed--will have gone to bed these two hours.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" I returned, \"that there is only one bed here, and that\nI--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't think of mentioning beds, Master Copperfield!\" he rejoined\necstatically, drawing up one leg. \"But _would_ you have any objections\nto my laying down before the fire?\"\n\n\"If it comes to that,\" I said, \"pray take my bed, and I'll lie down\nbefore the fire.\"\n\nHis repudiation of this offer was almost shrill enough, in the excess of\nits surprise and humility, to have penetrated to the ears of Mrs. Crupp,\nthen sleeping, I suppose, in a distant chamber, situated at about the\nlevel of low water mark, soothed in her slumbers by the ticking of an\nincorrigible clock, to which she always referred me when we had any\nlittle difference on the score of punctuality, and which was never less\nthan three quarters of an hour too slow, and had always been put right\nin the morning by the best authorities. As no arguments I could urge, in\nmy bewildered condition, had the least effect upon his modesty in\ninducing him to accept my bed-room, I was obliged to make the best\narrangements I could, for his repose before the fire. The mattress of\nthe sofa (which was a great deal too short for his lank figure), the\nsofa pillows, a blanket, the table-cover, a clean breakfast-cloth, and a\ngreat coat, made him a bed and covering, for which he was more than\nthankful. Having lent him a nightcap, which he put on at once, and in\nwhich he made such an awful figure that I have never worn one since, I\nleft him to his rest.\n\nI never shall forget that night. I never shall forget how I turned and\ntumbled; how I wearied myself with thinking about Agnes and this\ncreature; how I considered what could I do, and what ought I to do; how\nI could come to no other conclusion than that the best course for her\npeace, was to do nothing, and to keep to myself what I had heard. If I\nwent to sleep for a few moments, the image of Agnes with her tender\neyes, and of her father looking fondly on her, as I had so often seen\nhim look, arose before me with appealing faces, and filled me with vague\nterrors. When I awoke, the recollection that Uriah was lying in the next\nroom sat heavy on me like a waking night-mare; and oppressed me with a\nleaden dread, as if I had had some meaner quality of devil for a lodger.\n\nThe poker got into my dozing thoughts besides, and wouldn't come out. I\nthought, between sleeping and waking, that it was still red hot, and I\nhad snatched it out of the fire, and run him through the body. I was so\nhaunted at last by the idea, though I knew there was nothing in it, that\nI stole into the next room to look at him. There I saw him, lying on his\nback, with his legs extending to I don't know where, gurglings taking\nplace in his throat, stoppages in his nose, and his mouth open like a\npost-office. He was so much worse in reality than in my distempered\nfancy, that afterwards I was attracted to him in very repulsion, and\ncould not help wandering in and out every half hour or so, and taking\nanother look at him. Still, the long, long night seemed heavy and\nhopeless as ever, and no promise of day was in the murky sky.\n\nWhen I saw him going down stairs early in the morning (for, thank\nHeaven! he would not stay to breakfast), it appeared to me as if the\nnight was going away in his person. When I went out to the Commons, I\ncharged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open,\nthat my sitting-room might be aired, and purged of his presence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nI FALL INTO CAPTIVITY.\n\n\nI saw no more of Uriah Heep, until the day when Agnes left town. I was\nat the coach-office to take leave of her and see her go; and there was\nhe, returning to Canterbury by the same conveyance. It was some small\nsatisfaction to me to observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered,\nmulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, in company with an umbrella\nlike a small tent, on the edge of the back seat on the roof, while Agnes\nwas, of course, inside; but what I underwent in my efforts to be\nfriendly with him, while Agnes looked on, perhaps deserved that little\nrecompense. At the coach-window, as at the dinner-party, he hovered\nabout us without a moment's intermission, like a great vulture: gorging\nhimself on every syllable that I said to Agnes, or Agnes said to me.\n\nIn the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown\nme, I had thought very much of the words Agnes had used in reference to\nthe partnership. \"I did what I hope was right. Feeling sure that it was\nnecessary for papa's peace that the sacrifice should be made, I\nentreated him to make it.\" A miserable foreboding that she would yield\nto, and sustain herself by, the same feeling in reference to any\nsacrifice for his sake, had oppressed me ever since. I knew how she\nloved him. I knew what the devotion of her nature was. I knew from her\nown lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors,\nand as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay. I had no\nconsolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus\nwith the mulberry-coloured great-coat, for I felt that in the very\ndifference between them, in the self-denial of her pure soul and the\nsordid baseness of his, the greatest danger lay. All this, doubtless, he\nknew thoroughly, and had, in his cunning, considered well.\n\nYet, I was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off,\nmust destroy the happiness of Agnes; and I was so sure, from her manner,\nof its being unseen by her then, and having cast no shadow on her yet;\nthat I could as soon have injured her, as given her any warning of what\nimpended. Thus it was that we parted without explanation: she waving her\nhand and smiling farewell from the coach-window; her evil genius\nwrithing on the roof, as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed.\n\nI could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time. When\nAgnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when I\nsaw her going away. Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this\nsubject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be\nredoubled. Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it. It became a\npart of my life, and as inseparable from my life as my own head.\n\nI had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness: for Steerforth was at\nOxford, as he wrote to me, and when I was not at the Commons, I was very\nmuch alone. I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of\nSteerforth. I wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his, but I\nthink I was glad, upon the whole, that he could not come to London just\nthen. I suspect the truth to be, that the influence of Agnes was upon\nme, undisturbed by the sight of him; and that it was the more powerful\nwith me, because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest.\n\nIn the meantime, days and weeks slipped away. I was articled to Spenlow\nand Jorkins. I had ninety pounds a year (exclusive of my house-rent and\nsundry collateral matters) from my aunt. My rooms were engaged for\ntwelve months certain: and though I still found them dreary of an\nevening, and the evenings long, I could settle down into a state of\nequable low spirits, and resign myself to coffee; which I seem, on\nlooking back, to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my\nexistence. At about this time, too, I made three discoveries: first,\nthat Mrs. Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called \"the\nspazzums,\" which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the\nnose, and required to be constantly treated with peppermint; secondly,\nthat something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry, made the\nbrandy-bottles burst; thirdly, that I was alone in the world, and much\ngiven to record that circumstance in fragments of English versification.\n\nOn the day when I was articled, no festivity took place, beyond my\nhaving sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks, and going\nalone to the theatre at night. I went to see \"The Stranger\" as a\nDoctors' Commons sort of play, and was so dreadfully cut up, that I\nhardly knew myself in my own glass when I got home. Mr. Spenlow\nremarked, on this occasion, when we concluded our business, that he\nshould have been happy to have seen me at his house at Norwood to\ncelebrate our becoming connected, but for his domestic arrangements\nbeing in some disorder, on account of the expected return of his\ndaughter from finishing her education at Paris. But, he intimated that\nwhen she came home he should hope to have the pleasure of entertaining\nme. I knew that he was a widower with one daughter, and expressed my\nacknowledgments.\n\nMr. Spenlow was as good as his word. In a week or two, he referred to\nthis engagement, and said, that if I would do him the favor to come down\nnext Saturday, and stay till Monday, he would be extremely happy. Of\ncourse I said I _would_ do him the favor; and he was to drive me down in\nhis phaeton, and to bring me back.\n\nWhen the day arrived, my very carpet-bag was an object of veneration to\nthe stipendiary clerks, to whom the house at Norwood was a sacred\nmystery. One of them informed me that he had heard that Mr. Spenlow ate\nentirely off plate and china; and another hinted at champagne being\nconstantly on draught, after the usual custom of table beer. The old\nclerk with the wig, whose name was Mr. Tiffey, had been down on business\nseveral times in the course of his career, and had on each occasion\npenetrated to the breakfast-parlor. He described it as an apartment of\nthe most sumptuous nature, and said that he had drunk brown East India\nsherry there, of a quality so precious as to make a man wink.\n\nWe had an adjourned cause in the Consistory that day--about\nexcommunicating a baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a\npaving-rate--and as the evidence was just twice the length of Robinson\nCrusoe, according to a calculation I made, it was rather late in the\nday before we finished. However, we got him excommunicated for six\nweeks, and sentenced in no end of costs; and then the baker's proctor,\nand the judge, and the advocates on both sides (who were all nearly\nrelated), went out of town together, and Mr. Spenlow and I drove away\nin the phaeton.\n\nThe phaeton was a very handsome affair; the horses arched their necks\nand lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors'\nCommons. There was a good deal of competition in the Commons on all\npoints of display, and it turned out some very choice equipages then;\nthough I always have considered, and always shall consider, that in my\ntime the great article of competition there was starch: which I think\nwas worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature\nof man to bear.\n\nWe were very pleasant, going down, and Mr. Spenlow gave me some hints in\nreference to my profession. He said it was the genteelest profession in\nthe world, and must on no account be confounded with the profession of a\nsolicitor: being quite another sort of thing, infinitely more exclusive,\nless mechanical, and more profitable. We took things much more easily in\nthe Commons than they could be taken anywhere else, he observed, and\nthat set us, as a privileged class, apart. He said it was impossible to\nconceal the disagreeable fact, that we were chiefly employed by\nsolicitors; but he gave me to understand that they were an inferior race\nof men, universally looked down upon by all proctors of any pretensions.\n\nI asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional\nbusiness? He replied, that a good case of a disputed will, where there\nwas a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds, was,\nperhaps, the best of all. In such a case, he said, not only were there\nvery pretty pickings in the way of arguments at every stage of the\nproceedings, and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory\nand counter-interrogatory (to say nothing of an appeal lying, first to\nthe Delegates, and then to the Lords); but, the costs being pretty sure\nto come out of the estate at last, both sides went at it in a lively and\nspirited manner, and expense was no consideration. Then, he launched\ninto a general eulogium on the Commons. What was to be particularly\nadmired (he said) in the Commons, was its compactness. It was the most\nconveniently organised place in the world. It was the complete idea of\nsnugness. It lay in a nut-shell. For example: You brought a divorce\ncase, or a restitution case, into the Consistory. Very good. You tried\nit in the Consistory. You made a quiet little round game of it, among a\nfamily group, and you played it out at leisure. Suppose you were not\nsatisfied with the Consistory, what did you do then? Why, you went into\nthe Arches. What was the Arches? The same court, in the same room, with\nthe same bar, and the same practitioners, but another judge, for there\nthe Consistory judge could plead any court-day as an advocate. Well, you\nplayed your round game out again. Still you were not satisfied. Very\ngood. What did you do then? Why, you went to the Delegates. Who were the\nDelegates? Why, the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without\nany business, who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in\nboth courts, and had seen the cards shuffled, and cut, and played, and\nhad talked to all the players about it, and now came fresh, as judges,\nto settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody! Discontented\npeople might talk of corruption in the Commons, closeness in the\nCommons, and the necessity of reforming the Commons, said Mr. Spenlow\nsolemnly, in conclusion; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been\nhighest, the Commons had been busiest; and a man might lay his hand upon\nhis heart, and say this to the whole world,--\"Touch the Commons, and\ndown comes the country!\"\n\nI listened to all this with attention; and though, I must say, I had my\ndoubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the Commons as\nMr. Spenlow made out, I respectfully deferred to his opinion. That about\nthe price of wheat per bushel, I modestly felt was too much for my\nstrength, and quite settled the question. I have never, to this hour,\ngot the better of that bushel of wheat. It has re-appeared to annihilate\nme, all through my life, in connexion with all kinds of subjects. I\ndon't know now, exactly, what it has to do with me, or what right it has\nto crush me, on an infinite variety of occasions; but whenever I see my\nold friend the bushel brought in by the head and shoulders (as he always\nis, I observe), I give up a subject for lost.\n\nThis is a digression. _I_ was not the man to touch the Commons, and\nbring down the country. I submissively expressed, by my silence, my\nacquiescence in all I had heard from my superior in years and knowledge;\nand we talked about \"The Stranger\" and the Drama, and the pair of\nhorses, until we came to Mr. Spenlow's gate.\n\nThere was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow's house; and though that was\nnot the best time of the year for seeing a garden, it was so beautifully\nkept, that I was quite enchanted. There was a charming lawn, there were\nclusters of trees, and there were perspective walks that I could just\ndistinguish in the dark, arched over with trellis-work, on which shrubs\nand flowers grew in the growing season. \"Here Miss Spenlow walks by\nherself,\" I thought. \"Dear me!\"\n\nWe went into the house, which was cheerfully lighted up, and into a hall\nwhere there were all sorts of hats, caps, great-coats, plaids, gloves,\nwhips, and walking-sticks. \"Where is Miss Dora?\" said Mr. Spenlow to the\nservant. \"Dora!\" I thought. \"What a beautiful name!\"\n\nWe turned into a room near at hand (I think it was the identical\nbreakfast-room, made memorable by the brown East Indian Sherry), and I\nheard a voice say, \"Mr. Copperfield, my daughter Dora, and my daughter\nDora's confidential friend!\" It was, no doubt, Mr. Spenlow's voice, but\nI didn't know it, and I didn't care whose it was. All was over in a\nmoment. I had fulfilled my destiny. I was a captive and a slave. I loved\nDora Spenlow to distraction!\n\n  [Illustration: I fall into captivity.]\n\nShe was more than human to me. She was a Fairy, a Sylph, I don't know\nwhat she was--any thing that no one ever saw, and every thing that every\nbody ever wanted. I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant.\nThere was no pausing on the brink; no looking down, or looking back; I\nwas gone, headlong, before I had sense to say a word to her.\n\n\"_I_,\" observed a well-remembered voice, when I had bowed and murmured\nsomething, \"have seen Mr. Copperfield before.\"\n\nThe speaker was not Dora. No; the confidential friend. Miss Murdstone!\n\nI don't think I was much astonished. To the best of my judgment, no\ncapacity of astonishment was left in me. There was nothing worth\nmentioning in the material world, but Dora Spenlow, to be astonished\nabout. I said, \"How do you do, Miss Murdstone? I hope you are well.\" She\nanswered, \"Very well.\" I said, \"How is Mr. Murdstone?\" She replied, \"My\nbrother is robust, I am obliged to you.\"\n\nMr. Spenlow, who, I suppose, had been surprised to see us recognise each\nother, then put in his word.\n\n\"I am glad to find,\" he said, \"Copperfield, that you and Miss Murdstone\nare already acquainted.\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield and myself,\" said Miss Murdstone, with severe\ncomposure, \"are connexions. We were once slightly acquainted. It was in\nhis childish days. Circumstances have separated us since. I should not\nhave known him.\"\n\nI replied that I should have known her, any where. Which was true\nenough.\n\n\"Miss Murdstone has had the goodness,\" said Mr. Spenlow to me, \"to\naccept the office--if I may so describe it--of my daughter Dora's\nconfidential friend. My daughter Dora having, unhappily, no mother, Miss\nMurdstone is obliging enough to become her companion and protector.\"\n\nA passing thought occurred to me that Miss Murdstone, like the pocket\ninstrument called a life-preserver, was not so much designed for\npurposes of protection as of assault. But as I had none but passing\nthoughts for any subject save Dora, I glanced at her, directly\nafterwards, and was thinking that I saw, in her prettily pettish manner,\nthat she was not very much inclined to be particularly confidential to\nher companion and protector, when a bell rang, which Mr. Spenlow said\nwas the first dinner-bell, and so carried me off to dress.\n\nThe idea of dressing one's self, or doing any thing in the way of\naction, in that state of love, was a little too ridiculous. I could only\nsit down before my fire, biting the key of my carpet-bag, and think of\nthe captivating, girlish, bright-eyed lovely Dora. What a form she had,\nwhat a face she had, what a graceful, variable, enchanting manner!\n\nThe bell rang again so soon that I made a mere scramble of my dressing,\ninstead of the careful operation I could have wished under the\ncircumstances, and went down-stairs. There was some company. Dora was\ntalking to an old gentleman with a grey head. Grey as he was--and a\ngreat-grandfather into the bargain, for he said so--I was madly jealous\nof him.\n\nWhat a state of mind I was in! I was jealous of everybody. I couldn't\nbear the idea of anybody knowing Mr. Spenlow better than I did. It was\ntorturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no\nshare. When a most amiable person, with a highly polished bald head,\nasked me across the dinner-table, if that were the first occasion of my\nseeing the grounds, I could have done anything to him that was savage\nand revengeful.\n\nI don't remember who was there, except Dora. I have not the least idea\nwhat we had for dinner, besides Dora. My impression is, that I dined off\nDora, entirely, and sent away half-a-dozen plates untouched. I sat next\nto her. I talked to her. She had the most delightful little voice, the\ngayest little laugh, the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways,\nthat ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery. She was rather\ndiminutive altogether. So much the more precious, I thought.\n\nWhen she went out of the room with Miss Murdstone (no other ladies were\nof the party), I fell into a reverie, only disturbed by the cruel\napprehension that Miss Murdstone would disparage me to her. The amiable\ncreature with the polished head told me a long story, which I think was\nabout gardening. I think I heard him say, \"my gardener,\" several times.\nI seemed to pay the deepest attention to him, but I was wandering in a\ngarden of Eden all the while, with Dora.\n\nMy apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing\naffection were revived when we went into the drawing-room, by the grim\nand distant aspect of Miss Murdstone. But I was relieved of them in an\nunexpected manner.\n\n\"David Copperfield,\" said Miss Murdstone, beckoning me aside into a\nwindow. \"A word.\"\n\nI confronted Miss Murdstone alone.\n\n\"David Copperfield,\" said Miss Murdstone, \"I need not enlarge upon\nfamily circumstances. They are not a tempting subject.\"\n\n\"Far from it, ma'am,\" I returned.\n\n\"Far from it,\" assented Miss Murdstone. \"I do not wish to revive the\nmemory of past differences, or of past outrages. I have received\noutrages from a person--a female I am sorry to say, for the credit of my\nsex--who is not to be mentioned without scorn and disgust; and therefore\nI would rather not mention her.\"\n\nI felt very fiery on my aunt's account; but I said it would certainly be\nbetter, if Miss Murdstone pleased, _not_ to mention her. I could not\nhear her disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing my\nopinion in a decided tone.\n\nMiss Murdstone shut her eyes, and disdainfully inclined her head; then,\nslowly opening her eyes, resumed:\n\n\"David Copperfield, I shall not attempt to disguise the fact, that I\nformed an unfavorable opinion of you in your childhood. It may have been\na mistaken one, or you may have ceased to justify it. That is not in\nquestion between us now. I belong to a family remarkable, I believe, for\nsome firmness; and I am not the creature of circumstance or change. I\nmay have my opinion of you. You may have your opinion of me.\"\n\nI inclined my head, in my turn.\n\n\"But it is not necessary,\" said Miss Murdstone, \"that these opinions\nshould come into collision here. Under existing circumstances, it is as\nwell on all accounts that they should not. As the chances of life have\nbrought us together again, and may bring us together on other occasions,\nI would say let us meet here as distant acquaintances. Family\ncircumstances are a sufficient reason for our only meeting on that\nfooting, and it is quite unnecessary that either of us should make the\nother the subject of remark. Do you approve of this?\"\n\n\"Miss Murdstone,\" I returned, \"I think you and Mr. Murdstone used me\nvery cruelly, and treated my mother with great unkindness. I shall\nalways think so, as long as I live. But I quite agree in what you\npropose.\"\n\nMiss Murdstone shut her eyes again, and bent her head. Then, just\ntouching the back of my hand with the tips of her cold, stiff fingers,\nshe walked away, arranging the little fetters on her wrists and round\nher neck: which seemed to be the same set, in exactly the same state, as\nwhen I had seen her last. These reminded me, in reference to Miss\nMurdstone's nature, of the fetters over a jail-door; suggesting on the\noutside, to all beholders, what was to be expected within.\n\nAll I know of the rest of the evening is, that I heard the empress of my\nheart sing enchanted ballads in the French language, generally to the\neffect that, whatever was the matter, we ought always to dance, Ta ra\nla, Ta ra la! accompanying herself on a glorified instrument, resembling\na guitar. That I was lost in blissful delirium. That I refused\nrefreshment. That my soul recoiled from punch particularly. That when\nMiss Murdstone took her into custody and led her away, she smiled and\ngave me her delicious hand. That I caught a view of myself in a mirror,\nlooking perfectly imbecile and idiotic. That I retired to bed in a most\nmaudlin state of mind, and got up in a crisis of feeble infatuation.\n\nIt was a fine morning, and early, and I thought I would go and take a\nstroll down one of those wire-arched walks, and indulge my passion by\ndwelling on her image. On my way through the hall, I encountered her\nlittle dog, who was called Jip--short for Gipsy. I approached him\ntenderly, for I loved even him; but he showed his whole set of teeth,\ngot under a chair expressly to snarl, and wouldn't hear of the least\nfamiliarity.\n\nThe garden was cool and solitary. I walked about, wondering what my\nfeelings of happiness would be, if I could ever become engaged to this\ndear wonder. As to marriage, and fortune, and all that, I believe I was\nalmost as innocently undesigning then, as when I loved little Em'ly. To\nbe allowed to call her \"Dora,\" to write to her, to dote upon and worship\nher, to have reason to think that when she was with other people she was\nyet mindful of me, seemed to me the summit of human ambition--I am sure\nit was the summit of mine. There is no doubt whatever that I was a\nlackadaisical young spooney; but there was a purity of heart in all this\nstill, that prevents my having quite a contemptuous recollection of it,\nlet me laugh as I may.\n\nI had not been walking long, when I turned a corner, and met her. I\ntingle again from head to foot as my recollection turns that corner, and\nmy pen shakes in my hand.\n\n\"You--are--out early, Miss Spenlow,\" said I.\n\n\"It's so stupid at home,\" she replied, \"and Miss Murdstone is so absurd!\nShe talks such nonsense about its being necessary for the day to be\naired, before I come out. Aired!\" (She laughed, here, in the most\nmelodious manner). \"On a Sunday morning, when I don't practise, I must\ndo something. So I told papa last night I _must_ come out. Besides, it's\nthe brightest time of the whole day. Don't you think so?\"\n\nI hazarded a bold flight, and said (not without stammering) that it was\nvery bright to me then, though it had been very dark to me a minute\nbefore.\n\n\"Do you mean a compliment?\" said Dora, \"or that the weather has really\nchanged?\"\n\nI stammered worse than before, in replying that I meant no compliment,\nbut the plain truth; though I was not aware of any change having taken\nplace in the weather. It was in the state of my own feelings, I added\nbashfully: to clench the explanation.\n\nI never saw such curls--how could I, for there never were such\ncurls!--as those she shook out to hide her blushes. As to the straw\nhat and blue ribbons which was on the top of the curls, if I could\nonly have hung it up in my room in Buckingham Street, what a priceless\npossession it would have been!\n\n\"You have just come home from Paris,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"Have you ever been there?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh! I hope you'll go soon. You would like it so much!\"\n\nTraces of deep-seated anguish appeared in my countenance. That she\nshould hope I would go, that she should think it possible I _could_ go,\nwas insupportable. I depreciated Paris; I depreciated France. I said I\nwouldn't leave England, under existing circumstances, for any earthly\nconsideration. Nothing should induce me. In short, she was shaking the\ncurls again, when the little dog came running along the walk to our\nrelief.\n\nHe was mortally jealous of me, and persisted in barking at me. She took\nhim up in her arms--oh my goodness!--and caressed him, but he insisted\nupon barking still. He wouldn't let me touch him, when I tried; and then\nshe beat him. It increased my sufferings greatly to see the pats she\ngave him for punishment on the bridge of his blunt nose, while he winked\nhis eyes, and licked her hand, and still growled within himself like a\nlittle double-bass. At length he was quiet--well he might be with her\ndimpled chin upon his head!--and we walked away to look at a greenhouse.\n\n\"You are not very intimate with Miss Murdstone, are you?\" said\nDora.--\"My pet!\"\n\n(The two last words were to the dog. Oh if they had only been to me!)\n\n\"No,\" I replied. \"Not at all so.\"\n\n\"She is a tiresome creature,\" said Dora pouting. \"I can't think what\npapa can have been about, when he chose such a vexatious thing to be my\ncompanion. Who wants a protector! I am sure _I_ don't want a protector.\nJip can protect me a great deal better than Miss Murdstone,--can't you,\nJip dear?\"\n\nHe only winked lazily, when she kissed his ball of a head.\n\n\"Papa calls her my confidential friend, but I am sure she is no such\nthing--is she, Jip? We are not going to confide in any such cross\npeople, Jip and I. We mean to bestow our confidence where we like,\nand to find out our own friends, instead of having them found out for\nus--don't we, Jip?\"\n\nJip made a comfortable noise, in answer, a little like a tea-kettle when\nit sings. As for me, every word was a new heap of fetters, rivetted\nabove the last.\n\n\"It is very hard, because we have not a kind Mama, that we are to have,\ninstead, a sulky, gloomy old thing like Miss Murdstone, always following\nus about--isn't it, Jip? Never mind, Jip. We won't be confidential, and\nwe'll make ourselves as happy as we can in spite of her, and we'll teaze\nher, and not please her,--won't we, Jip?\"\n\nIf it had lasted any longer, I think I must have gone down on my knees\non the gravel, with the probability before me of grazing them, and of\nbeing presently ejected from the premises besides. But, by good fortune\nthe greenhouse was not far off, and these words brought us to it.\n\nIt contained quite a show of beautiful geraniums. We loitered along in\nfront of them, and Dora often stopped to admire this one or that one,\nand I stopped to admire the same one, and Dora, laughing, held the dog\nup childishly, to smell the flowers; and if we were not all three in\nFairyland, certainly _I_ was. The scent of a geranium leaf, at this day,\nstrikes me with a half comical half serious wonder as to what change has\ncome over me in a moment; and then I see a straw hat and blue ribbons,\nand a quantity of curls, and a little black dog being held up, in two\nslender arms, against a bank of blossoms and bright leaves.\n\nMiss Murdstone had been looking for us. She found us here; and\npresented her uncongenial cheek, the little wrinkles in it filled with\nhair-powder, to Dora to be kissed. Then she took Dora's arm in hers,\nand marched us in to breakfast as if it were a soldier's funeral.\n\nHow many cups of tea I drank, because Dora made it, I don't know. But,\nI perfectly remember that I sat swilling tea until my whole nervous\nsystem, if I had had any in those days, must have gone by the board.\nBy-and-by we went to church. Miss Murdstone was between Dora and me in\nthe pew; but I heard her sing, and the congregation vanished. A sermon\nwas delivered--about Dora, of course--and I am afraid that is all I\nknow of the service.\n\nWe had a quiet day. No company, a walk, a family dinner of four, and an\nevening of looking over books and pictures; Miss Murdstone with a homily\nbefore her, and her eye upon us, keeping guard vigilantly. Ah! little\ndid Mr. Spenlow imagine, when he sat opposite to me after dinner that\nday, with his pocket-handkerchief over his head, how fervently I was\nembracing him, in my fancy, as his son-in-law! Little did he think, when\nI took leave of him at night, that he had just given his full consent to\nmy being engaged to Dora, and that I was invoking blessings on his head!\n\nWe departed early in the morning, for we had a Salvage case coming on in\nthe Admiralty Court, requiring a rather accurate knowledge of the whole\nscience of navigation, in which (as we couldn't be expected to know much\nabout those matters in the Commons) the judge had entreated two old\nTrinity Masters, for charity's sake, to come and help him out. Dora was\nat the breakfast-table to make the tea again, however; and I had the\nmelancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton, as she\nstood on the door-step with Jip in her arms.\n\nWhat the Admiralty was to me that day; what nonsense I made of our case\nin my mind, as I listened to it; how I saw \"DORA\" engraved upon the\nblade of the silver oar which they lay upon the table, as the emblem of\nthat high jurisdiction; and how I felt, when Mr. Spenlow went home\nwithout me (I had had an insane hope that he might take me back again),\nas if I were a mariner myself, and the ship to which I belonged had\nsailed away and left me on a desert island; I shall make no fruitless\neffort to describe. If that sleepy old court could rouse itself, and\npresent in any visible form the day dreams I have had in it about Dora,\nit would reveal my truth.\n\nI don't mean the dreams that I dreamed on that day alone, but day after\nday, from week to week, and term to term. I went there, not to attend\nto what was going on, but to think about Dora. If I ever bestowed a\nthought upon the cases, as they dragged their slow length before me, it\nwas only to wonder, in the matrimonial cases (remembering Dora), how\nit was that married people could ever be otherwise than happy; and, in\nthe Prerogative cases, to consider, if the money in question had been\nleft to me, what were the foremost steps I should immediately have\ntaken in regard to Dora. Within the first week of my passion, I bought\nfour sumptuous waistcoats--not for myself; _I_ had no pride in them;\nfor Dora--and took to wearing straw-colored kid gloves in the streets,\nand laid the foundations of all the corns I have ever had. If the boots\nI wore at that period could only be produced and compared with the\nnatural size of my feet, they would show what the state of my heart\nwas, in a most affecting manner.\n\nAnd yet, wretched cripple as I made myself by this act of homage to\nDora, I walked miles upon miles daily in the hope of seeing her. Not\nonly was I soon as well known on the Norwood Road as the postmen on that\nbeat, but I pervaded London likewise. I walked about the streets where\nthe best shops for ladies were, I haunted the Bazaar like an unquiet\nspirit, I fagged through the Park again and again, long after I was\nquite knocked up. Sometimes, at long intervals and on rare occasions, I\nsaw her. Perhaps I saw her glove waved in a carriage window; perhaps I\nmet her, walked with her and Miss Murdstone a little way, and spoke to\nher. In the latter case I was always very miserable afterwards, to think\nthat I had said nothing to the purpose; or that she had no idea of the\nextent of my devotion, or that she cared nothing about me. I was always\nlooking out, as may be supposed, for another invitation to Mr. Spenlow's\nhouse. I was always being disappointed, for I got none.\n\nMrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration; for when this\nattachment was but a few weeks old, and I had not had the courage to\nwrite more explicitly even to Agnes, than that I had been to Mr.\nSpenlow's house, \"whose family,\" I added, \"consists of one daughter;\"--I\nsay Mrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration, for, even in that\nearly stage, she found it out. She came up to me one evening, when I was\nvery low, to ask (she being then afflicted with the disorder I have\nmentioned) if I could oblige her with a little tincture of cardamums\nmixed with rhubarb, and flavored with seven drops of the essence of\ncloves, which was the best remedy for her complaint;--or, if I had not\nsuch a thing by me, with a little brandy, which was the next best. It\nwas not, she remarked, so palatable to her, but it was the next best. As\nI had never even heard of the first remedy, and always had the second in\nthe closet, I gave Mrs. Crupp a glass of the second, which (that I might\nhave no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use) she began to\ntake in my presence.\n\n\"Cheer up, sir,\" said Mrs. Crupp, \"I can't abear to see you so, sir, I'm\na mother myself.\"\n\nI did not quite perceive the application of this fact to _my_self, but I\nsmiled on Mrs. Crupp, as benignly as was in my power.\n\n\"Come, sir,\" said Mrs. Crupp. \"Excuse me. I know what it is, sir.\nThere's a young lady in the case.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Crupp?\" I returned, reddening.\n\n\"Oh, bless you! Keep a good heart, sir!\" said Mrs. Crupp, nodding\nencouragement. \"Never say die, sir! If She don't smile upon you, there's\na many as will. You're a young gentleman to _be_ smiled on, Mr.\nCopperfull, and you must learn your walue, sir.\"\n\nMrs. Crupp always called me Mr. Copperfull: firstly, no doubt, because\nit was not my name; and secondly, I am inclined to think, in some\nindistinct association with a washing-day.\n\n\"What makes you suppose there is any young lady in the case, Mrs.\nCrupp?\" said I.\n\n\"Mr. Copperfull,\" said Mrs. Crupp, with a great deal of feeling, \"I'm a\nmother myself.\"\n\nFor some time Mrs. Crupp could only lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom,\nand fortify herself against returning pain with sips of her medicine. At\nlength she spoke again.\n\n\"When the present set were took for you by your dear aunt, Mr.\nCopperfull,\" said Mrs. Crupp, \"my remark were, I had now found summun I\ncould care for. 'Thank Ev'in!' were the expression, 'I have now found\nsummun I can care for!'--You don't eat enough, sir, nor yet drink.\"\n\n\"Is that what you found your supposition on, Mrs. Crupp?\" said I.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mrs. Crupp, in a tone approaching to severity, \"I've\nlaundressed other young gentlemen besides yourself. A young gentleman\nmay be over-careful of himself, or he may be under-careful of himself.\nHe may brush his hair too regular, or too unregular. He may wear his\nboots much too large for him, or much too small. That is according as\nthe young gentleman has his original character formed. But let him go to\nwhich extreme he may, sir, there's a young lady in both of 'em.\"\n\nMrs. Crupp shook her head in such a determined manner, that I had not an\ninch of 'vantage ground left.\n\n\"It was but the gentleman which died here before yourself,\" said Mrs.\nCrupp, \"that fell in love--with a barmaid--and had his waistcoats took\nin directly, though much swelled by drinking.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Crupp,\" said I, \"I must beg you not to connect the young lady in\nmy case with a barmaid, or anything of that sort, if you please.\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfull,\" returned Mrs. Crupp, \"I'm a mother myself, and not\nlikely. I ask your pardon, sir, if I intrude. I should never wish to\nintrude where I were not welcome. But you are a young gentleman, Mr.\nCopperfull, and my adwice to you is, to cheer up, sir, to keep a good\nheart, and to know your own walue. If you was to take to something,\nsir,\" said Mrs. Crupp, \"if you was to take to skittles, now, which is\nhealthy, you might find it divert your mind, and do you good.\"\n\nWith these words, Mrs. Crupp, affecting to be very careful of the\nbrandy--which it was all gone--thanked me with a majestic curtsey, and\nretired. As her figure disappeared into the gloom of the entry, this\ncounsel certainly presented itself to my mind in the light of a slight\nliberty on Mrs. Crupp's part; but, at the same time, I was content to\nreceive it, in another point of view, as a word to the wise, and a\nwarning in future to keep my secret better.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nTOMMY TRADDLES.\n\n\nIt may have been in consequence of Mrs. Crupp's advice, and, perhaps,\nfor no better reason than because there was a certain similarity in the\nsound of the words skittles and Traddles, that it came into my head,\nnext day, to go and look after Traddles. The time he had mentioned was\nmore than out, and he lived in a little street near the Veterinary\nCollege at Camden Town, which was principally tenanted, as one of our\nclerks who lived in that direction informed me, by gentlemen students,\nwho bought live donkeys, and made experiments on those quadrupeds in\ntheir private apartments. Having obtained from this clerk a direction to\nthe academic grove in question, I set out, the same afternoon, to visit\nmy old schoolfellow.\n\nI found that the street was not as desirable a one as I could have\nwished it to be, for the sake of Traddles. The inhabitants appeared to\nhave a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of,\ninto the road: which not only made it rank and sloppy, but untidy too,\non account of the cabbage-leaves. The refuse was not wholly vegetable\neither, for I myself saw a shoe, a doubled-up saucepan, a black bonnet,\nand an umbrella, in various stages of decomposition, as I was looking\nout for the number I wanted.\n\nThe general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when I\nlived with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. An indescribable character of faded\ngentility that attached to the house I sought, and made it unlike all\nthe other houses in the street--though they were all built on one\nmonotonous pattern, and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy\nwho was learning to make houses, and had not yet got out of his cramped\nbrick and mortar pothooks--reminded me still more of Mr. and Mrs.\nMicawber. Happening to arrive at the door as it was opened to the\nafternoon milkman, I was reminded of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber more forcibly\nyet.\n\n\"Now,\" said the milkman to a very youthful servant girl. \"Has that there\nlittle bill of mine been heerd on?\"\n\n\"Oh master says he'll attend to it immediate,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Because,\" said the milkman, going on as if he had received no answer,\nand speaking, as I judged from his tone, rather for the edification of\nsomebody within the house, than of the youthful servant--an impression\nwhich was strengthened by his manner of glaring down the\npassage--\"Because that there little bill has been running so long, that\nI begin to believe it's run away altogether, and never won't be heerd\nof. Now, I'm not a going to stand it, you know!\" said the milkman, still\nthrowing his voice into the house, and glaring down the passage.\n\nAs to his dealing in the mild article of milk, by-the-by, there never\nwas a greater anomaly. His deportment would have been fierce in a\nbutcher or a brandy merchant.\n\nThe voice of the youthful servant became faint, but she seemed to me,\nfrom the action of her lips, again to murmur that it would be attended\nto immediate.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" said the milkman, looking hard at her for the first\ntime, and taking her by the chin, \"are you fond of milk?\"\n\n\"Yes, I likes it,\" she replied.\n\n\"Good,\" said the milkman. \"Then you won't have none to-morrow. D'ye\nhear? Not a fragment of milk you won't have to-morrow.\"\n\nI thought she seemed, upon the whole, relieved, by the prospect of\nhaving any to-day. The milkman, after shaking his head at her, darkly,\nreleased her chin, and with any thing rather than good will opened his\ncan, and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug. This done, he\nwent away, muttering, and uttered the cry of his trade next door, in a\nvindictive shriek.\n\n\"Does Mr. Traddles live here?\" I then enquired.\n\nA mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied \"Yes.\" Upon which\nthe youthful servant replied \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is he at home?\" said I.\n\nAgain the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative, and again the\nservant echoed it. Upon this, I walked in, and in pursuance of the\nservant's directions walked up-stairs; conscious, as I passed the back\nparlor-door, that I was surveyed by a mysterious eye, probably belonging\nto the mysterious voice.\n\nWhen I got to the top of the stairs--the house was only a story high\nabove the ground floor--Traddles was on the landing to meet me. He was\ndelighted to see me, and gave me welcome, with great heartiness, to his\nlittle room. It was in the front of the house, and extremely neat,\nthough sparely furnished. It was his only room, I saw; for there was a\nsofa-bedstead in it, and his blacking-brushes and blacking were among\nhis books--on the top shelf, behind a dictionary. His table was covered\nwith papers, and he was hard at work in an old coat. I looked at\nnothing, that I know of, but I saw everything, even to the prospect of a\nchurch upon his china inkstand, as I sat down--and this, too, was a\nfaculty confirmed in me in the old Micawber times. Various ingenious\narrangements he had made, for the disguise of his chest of drawers, and\nthe accommodation of his boots, his shaving-glass, and so forth,\nparticularly impressed themselves upon me, as evidences of the same\nTraddles who used to make models of elephant's dens in writing paper to\nput flies in; and to comfort himself, under ill usage, with the\nmemorable works of art I have so often mentioned.\n\nIn a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large\nwhite cloth. I could not make out what that was.\n\n\"Traddles,\" said I, shaking hands with him again, after I had sat down.\n\"I am delighted to see you.\"\n\n\"I am delighted to see _you_, Copperfield,\" he returned. \"I am very glad\nindeed to see you. It was because I was thoroughly glad to see you when\nwe met in Ely Place, and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see me,\nthat I gave you this address instead of my address at chambers.\"\n\n\"Oh! You have chambers?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, I have the fourth of a room and a passage, and the fourth of a\nclerk,\" returned Traddles. \"Three others and myself unite to have a set\nof chambers--to look business-like--and we quarter the clerk too.\nHalf-a-crown a week he costs me.\"\n\nHis old simple character and good temper, and something of his old\nunlucky fortune also, I thought, smiled at me in the smile with which he\nmade this explanation.\n\n\"It's not because I have the least pride, Copperfield, you understand,\"\nsaid Traddles, \"that I don't usually give my address here. It's only on\naccount of those who come to me, who might not like to come here. For\nmyself, I am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties, and\nit would be ridiculous if I made a pretence of doing any thing else.\"\n\n\"You are reading for the bar, Mr. Waterbrook informed me?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Traddles, rubbing his hands, slowly over one another,\n\"I am reading for the bar. The fact is, I have just begun to keep my\nterms, after rather a long delay. It's some time since I was articled,\nbut the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull. A great pull!\"\nsaid Traddles, with a wince, as if he had had a tooth out.\n\n\"Do you know what I can't help thinking of, Traddles, as I sit here\nlooking at you?\" I asked him.\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\n\"That sky-blue suit you used to wear.\"\n\n\"Lord, to be sure!\" cried Traddles, laughing. \"Tight in the arms and\nlegs, you know? Dear me! Well! Those were happy times, weren't they?\"\n\n\"I think our schoolmaster might have made them happier, without doing\nany harm to any of us, I acknowledge,\" I returned.\n\n\"Perhaps he might,\" said Traddles. \"But dear me, there was a good deal\nof fun going on. Do you remember the nights in the bed-room? When we\nused to have the suppers? And when you used to tell the stories? Ha, ha,\nha! And do you remember when I got caned for crying about Mr. Mell? Old\nCreakle! I should like to see him again, too!\"\n\n\"He was a brute to you, Traddles,\" said I, indignantly; for his good\nhumour made me feel as if I had seen him beaten but yesterday.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" returned Traddles. \"Really? Perhaps he was, rather.\nBut it's all over, a long while. Old Creakle!\"\n\n\"You were brought up by an uncle, then?\" said I.\n\n\"Of course I was!\" said Traddles. \"The one I was always going to write\nto. And always didn't, eh! Ha, ha, ha! Yes, I had an uncle then. He died\nsoon after I left school.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes. He was a retired--what do you call\nit!--draper--cloth-merchant--and had made me his heir. But he didn't\nlike me when I grew up.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean that?\" said I. He was so composed, that I fancied he\nmust have some other meaning.\n\n\"O dear yes, Copperfield! I mean it,\" replied Traddles. \"It was an\nunfortunate thing, but he didn't like me at all. He said I wasn't at all\nwhat he expected, and so he married his housekeeper.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I didn't do anything in particular,\" said Traddles. \"I lived with them,\nwaiting to be put out in the world, until his gout unfortunately flew to\nhis stomach--and so he died, and so she married a young man, and so I\nwasn't provided for.\"\n\n\"Did you get nothing, Traddles, after all?\"\n\n\"Oh dear yes!\" said Traddles. \"I got fifty pounds. I had never been\nbrought up to any profession, and at first I was at a loss what to do\nfor myself. However, I began, with the assistance of the son of a\nprofessional man, who had been to Salem House--Yawler, with his nose on\none side. Do you recollect him?\"\n\nNo. He had not been there with me; all the noses were straight, in my\nday.\n\n\"It don't matter,\" said Traddles. \"I began, by means of his assistance,\nto copy law writings. That didn't answer very well; and then I began to\nstate cases for them, and make abstracts, and do that sort of work. For\nI am a plodding kind of fellow, Copperfield, and had learnt the way of\ndoing such things pithily. Well! That put it in my head to enter myself\nas a law student; and that ran away with all that was left of the fifty\npounds. Yawler recommended me to one or two other offices, however--Mr.\nWaterbrook's for one--and I got a good many jobs. I was fortunate\nenough, too, to become acquainted with a person in the publishing way,\nwho was getting up an Encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia, and he set me to work; and, indeed\"\n(glancing at his table), \"I am at work for him at this minute. I am not\na bad compiler, Copperfield,\" said Traddles, preserving the same air of\ncheerful confidence in all he said, \"but I have no invention at all; not\na particle. I suppose there never was a young man with less originality\nthan I have.\"\n\nAs Traddles seemed to expect that I should assent to this as a matter of\ncourse, I nodded; and he went on, with the same sprightly patience--I\ncan find no better expression--as before.\n\n\"So, by little and little, and not living high, I managed to scrape up\nthe hundred pounds at last,\" said Traddles; \"and thank Heaven that's\npaid--though it was--though it certainly was,\" said Traddles, wincing\nagain as if he had had another tooth out, \"a pull. I am living by the\nsort of work I have mentioned, still, and I hope, one of these days, to\nget connected with some newspaper: which would almost be the making of\nmy fortune. Now, Copperfield, you are so exactly what you used to be,\nwith that agreeable face, and it's so pleasant to see you, that I\nsha'n't conceal anything. Therefore you must know that I am engaged.\"\n\nEngaged! Oh Dora!\n\n\"She is a curate's daughter,\" said Traddles; \"one of ten, down in\nDevonshire. Yes!\" For he saw me glance, involuntarily, at the prospect\non the inkstand. \"That's the church! You come round here, to the left,\nout of this gate,\" tracing his finger along the inkstand, \"and exactly\nwhere I hold this pen, there stands the house--facing, you understand,\ntowards the church.\"\n\nThe delight with which he entered into these particulars, did not fully\npresent itself to me until afterwards; for my selfish thoughts were\nmaking a ground-plan of Mr. Spenlow's house and garden at the same\nmoment.\n\n\"She is such a dear girl!\" said Traddles; \"a little older than me, but\nthe dearest girl! I told you I was going out of town? I have been down\nthere. I walked there, and I walked back, and I had the most delightful\ntime! I dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement, but our\nmotto is 'Wait and hope!' We always say that. 'Wait and hope,' we always\nsay. And she would wait, Copperfield, till she was sixty--any age you\ncan mention--for me!\"\n\nTraddles rose from his chair, and, with a triumphant smile, put his hand\nupon the white cloth I had observed.\n\n\"However,\" he said, \"it's not that we haven't made a beginning towards\nhousekeeping. No, no; we have begun. We must get on by degrees, but we\nhave begun. Here,\" drawing the cloth off with great pride and care, \"are\ntwo pieces of furniture to commence with. This flower-pot and stand, she\nbought herself. You put that in a parlor-window,\" said Traddles, falling\na little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration, \"with a\nplant in it, and--and there you are! This little round table with the\nmarble top (it's two feet ten in circumference), _I_ bought. You want to\nlay a book down, you know, or somebody comes to see you or your wife,\nand wants a place to stand a cup of tea upon, and--and there you are\nagain!\" said Traddles. \"It's an admirable piece of workmanship--firm as\na rock!\"\n\nI praised them both, highly, and Traddles replaced the covering as\ncarefully as he had removed it.\n\n\"It's not a great deal towards the furnishing,\" said Traddles, \"but\nit's something. The table-cloths and pillow-cases, and articles\nof that kind, are what discourage me most, Copperfield. So does\nthe ironmongery--candle-boxes, and gridirons, and that sort of\nnecessaries--because those things tell, and mount up. However, 'wait\nand hope!' And I assure you she's the dearest girl!\"\n\n\"I am quite certain of it,\" said I.\n\n\"In the mean time,\" said Traddles, coming back to his chair; \"and this\nis the end of my prosing about myself, I get on as well as I can. I\ndon't make much, but I don't spend much. In general, I board with the\npeople down-stairs, who are very agreeable people indeed. Both Mr. and\nMrs. Micawber have seen a good deal of life, and are excellent company.\"\n\n\"My dear Traddles!\" I quickly exclaimed. \"What are you talking about!\"\n\nTraddles looked at me, as if he wondered what _I_ was talking about.\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Micawber!\" I repeated. \"Why, I am intimately acquainted\nwith them!\"\n\nAn opportune double knock at the door, which I knew well from old\nexperience in Windsor Terrace, and which nobody but Mr. Micawber could\never have knocked at that door, resolved any doubt in my mind as to\ntheir being my old friends. I begged Traddles to ask his landlord to\nwalk up. Traddles accordingly did so, over the bannister; and Mr.\nMicawber, not a bit changed--his tights, his stick, his shirt-collar,\nand his eye-glass, all the same as ever--came into the room with a\ngenteel and youthful air.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Traddles,\" said Mr. Micawber, with the old roll\nin his voice, as he checked himself in humming a soft tune. \"I was not\naware that there was any individual, alien to this tenement, in your\nsanctum.\"\n\nMr. Micawber slightly bowed to me, and pulled up his shirt-collar.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Micawber?\" said I.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"you are exceedingly obliging. I am _in statu\nquo_.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Micawber?\" I pursued.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"she is also, thank God, _in statu quo_.\"\n\n\"And the children, Mr. Micawber?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"I rejoice to reply that they are, likewise,\nin the enjoyment of salubrity.\"\n\nAll this time, Mr. Micawber had not known me in the least, though he had\nstood face to face with me. But, now, seeing me smile, he examined my\nfeatures with more attention, fell back, cried, \"Is it possible! Have I\nthe pleasure of again beholding Copperfield!\" and shook me by both hands\nwith the utmost fervor.\n\n\"Good Heaven, Mr. Traddles!\" said Mr. Micawber, \"to think that I should\nfind you acquainted with the friend of my youth, the companion of\nearlier days! My dear!\" calling over the bannisters to Mrs. Micawber,\nwhile Traddles looked (with reason) not a little amazed at this\ndescription of me. \"Here is a gentleman in Mr. Traddles's apartment,\nwhom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you, my love!\"\n\nMr. Micawber immediately reappeared, and shook hands with me again.\n\n\"And how is our good friend the Doctor, Copperfield?\" said Mr. Micawber,\n\"and all the circle at Canterbury?\"\n\n\"I have none but good accounts of them,\" said I.\n\n\"I am most delighted to hear it,\" said Mr. Micawber. \"It was at\nCanterbury where we last met. Within the shadow, I may figuratively say,\nof that religious edifice, immortalized by Chaucer, which was anciently\nthe resort of Pilgrims from the remotest corners of--in short,\" said Mr.\nMicawber, \"in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cathedral.\"\n\nI replied that it was. Mr. Micawber continued talking as volubly as he\ncould; but not, I thought, without showing, by some marks of concern in\nhis countenance, that he was sensible of sounds in the next room, as of\nMrs. Micawber washing her hands, and hurriedly opening and shutting\ndrawers that were uneasy in their action.\n\n\"You find us, Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, with one eye on Traddles,\n\"at present established, on what may be designated as a small and\nunassuming scale; but, you are aware that I have, in the course of my\ncareer, surmounted difficulties, and conquered obstacles. You are no\nstranger to the fact, that there have been periods of my life, when it\nhas been requisite that I should pause, until certain expected events\nshould turn up; when it has been necessary that I should fall back,\nbefore making what I trust I shall not be accused of presumption in\nterming--a spring. The present is one of those momentous stages in the\nlife of man. You find me, fallen back, _for_ a spring; and I have every\nreason to believe that a vigorous leap will shortly be the result.\"\n\nI was expressing my satisfaction, when Mrs. Micawber came in; a little\nmore slatternly than she used to be, or so she seemed now, to my\nunaccustomed eyes, but still with some preparation of herself for\ncompany, and with a pair of brown gloves on.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber, leading her towards me. \"Here is a\ngentleman of the name of Copperfield, who wishes to renew his\nacquaintance with you.\"\n\nIt would have been better, as it turned out, to have led gently up\nto his announcement, for Mrs. Micawber, being in a delicate state of\nhealth, was overcome by it, and was taken so unwell, that Mr. Micawber\nwas obliged, in great trepidation, to run down to the water-butt\nin the back yard, and draw a basinful to lave her brow with. She\npresently revived, however, and was really pleased to see me. We had\nhalf-an-hour's talk, all together; and I asked her about the twins,\nwho, she said, were \"grown great creatures;\" and after Master and Miss\nMicawber, whom she described as \"absolute giants,\" but they were not\nproduced on that occasion.\n\nMr. Micawber was very anxious that I should stay to dinner. I should not\nhave been averse to do so, but that I imagined I detected trouble, and\ncalculation relative to the extent of the cold meat, in Mrs. Micawber's\neye. I therefore pleaded another engagement; and observing that Mrs.\nMicawber's spirits were immediately lightened, I resisted all persuasion\nto forego it.\n\nBut I told Traddles, and Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, that before I could\nthink of leaving, they must appoint a day when they would come and dine\nwith me. The occupations to which Traddles stood pledged, rendered it\nnecessary to fix a somewhat distant one; but an appointment was made for\nthe purpose, that suited us all, and then I took my leave.\n\nMr. Micawber, under pretence of showing me a nearer way than that by\nwhich I had come, accompanied me to the corner of the street; being\nanxious (he explained to me) to say a few words to an old friend, in\nconfidence.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"I need hardly tell you that\nto have beneath our roof, under existing circumstances, a mind like that\nwhich gleams--if I may be allowed the expression--which gleams--in your\nfriend Traddles, is an unspeakable comfort. With a washerwoman, who\nexposes hard-bake for sale in her parlor-window, dwelling next door, and\na Bow-street officer residing over the way, you may imagine that his\nsociety is a source of consolation to myself and to Mrs. Micawber. I am\nat present, my dear Copperfield, engaged in the sale of corn upon\ncommission. It is not an avocation of a remunerative description--in\nother words it does _not_ pay--and some temporary embarrassments of a\npecuniary nature have been the consequence. I am, however, delighted to\nadd that I have now an immediate prospect of something turning up (I am\nnot at liberty to say in what direction), which I trust will enable me\nto provide, permanently, both for myself and for your friend Traddles,\nin whom I have an unaffected interest. You may, perhaps, be prepared to\nhear that Mrs. Micawber is in a state of health which renders it not\nwholly improbable that an addition may be ultimately made to those\npledges of affection which--in short, to the infantine group. Mrs.\nMicawber's family have been so good as to express their dissatisfaction\nwith this state of things. I have merely to observe, that I am not aware\nit is any business of theirs, and that I repel that exhibition of\nfeeling with scorn, and with defiance!\"\n\nMr. Micawber then shook hands with me again, and left me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nMR. MICAWBER'S GAUNTLET.\n\n\nUntil the day arrived on which I was to entertain my newly-found old\nfriends, I lived principally on Dora and coffee. In my love-lorn\ncondition, my appetite languished; and I was glad of it, for I felt as\nthough it would have been an act of perfidy towards Dora to have a\nnatural relish for my dinner. The quantity of walking exercise I took,\nwas not in this respect attended with its usual consequence, as the\ndisappointment counteracted the fresh air. I have my doubts, too,\nfounded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life,\nwhether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in\nany human subject who is always in torment from tight boots. I think the\nextremities require to be at peace before the stomach will conduct\nitself with vigour.\n\nOn the occasion of this domestic little party, I did not repeat my\nformer extensive preparations. I merely provided a pair of soles, a\nsmall leg of mutton, and a pigeon-pie. Mrs. Crupp broke out into\nrebellion on my first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of the\nfish and joint, and said, with a dignified sense of injury, \"No! No,\nsir! You will not ask me sich a thing, for you are better acquainted\nwith me than to suppose me capable of doing what I cannot do with ampial\nsatisfaction to my own feelings!\" But, in the end, a compromise was\neffected; and Mrs. Crupp consented to achieve this feat, on condition\nthat I dined from home for a fortnight afterwards.\n\nAnd here I may remark, that what I underwent from Mrs. Crupp, in\nconsequence of the tyranny she established over me, was dreadful. I\nnever was so much afraid of any one. We made a compromise of everything.\nIf I hesitated, she was taken with that wonderful disorder which was\nalways lying in ambush in her system, ready, at the shortest notice, to\nprey upon her vitals. If I rang the bell impatiently, after half-a-dozen\nunavailing modest pulls, and she appeared at last--which was not by any\nmeans to be relied upon--she would appear with a reproachful aspect,\nsink breathless on a chair near the door, lay her hand upon her nankeen\nbosom, and become so ill, that I was glad, at any sacrifice of brandy or\nanything else, to get rid of her. If I objected to having my bed made at\nfive o'clock in the afternoon--which I _do_ still think an uncomfortable\narrangement--one motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region of\nwounded sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology. In short, I\nwould have done anything in an honorable way rather than give Mrs. Crupp\noffence; and she was the terror of my life.\n\nI bought a second-hand dumb-waiter for this dinner-party, in preference\nto re-engaging the handy young man; against whom I had conceived a\nprejudice, in consequence of meeting him in the Strand, one Sunday\nmorning, in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine, which had been\nmissing since the former occasion. The \"young gal\" was re-engaged; but\non the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes, and then\nwithdraw to the landing-place, beyond the outer door; where a habit of\nsniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests, and where her\nretiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility.\n\nHaving laid in the materials for a bowl of punch, to be compounded by\nMr. Micawber; having provided a bottle of lavender-water, two wax\ncandles, a paper of mixed pins, and a pincushion, to assist Mrs.\nMicawber in her toilette, at my dressing-table; having also caused the\nfire in my bed-room to be lighted for Mrs. Micawber's convenience; and\nhaving laid the cloth with my own hands, I awaited the result with\ncomposure.\n\nAt the appointed time, my three visitors arrived together. Mr. Micawber\nwith more shirt-collar than usual, and a new ribbon to his eye-glass;\nMrs. Micawber with her cap in a whitey-brown paper parcel; Traddles\ncarrying the parcel, and supporting Mrs. Micawber on his arm. They were\nall delighted with my residence. When I conducted Mrs. Micawber to my\ndressing-table, and she saw the scale on which it was prepared for her,\nshe was in such raptures, that she called Mr. Micawber to come in and\nlook.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"this is luxurious. This is a\nway of life which reminds me of the period when I was myself in a state\nof celibacy, and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her\nfaith at the Hymeneal altar.\"\n\n\"He means, solicited by him, Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber\narchly. \"He cannot answer for others.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness, \"I have no\ndesire to answer for others. I am too well aware that when, in the\ninscrutable decrees of Fate, you were reserved for me, it is possible\nyou may have been reserved for one, destined, after a protracted\nstruggle, at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a\ncomplicated nature. I understand your allusion, my love. I regret it,\nbut I can bear it.\"\n\n\"Micawber!\" exclaimed Mrs. Micawber, in tears. \"Have I deserved this! I,\nwho never have deserted you; who never _will_ desert you, Micawber!\"\n\n\"My love,\" said Mr. Micawber, much affected, \"you will forgive, and our\nold and tried friend Copperfield will, I am sure, forgive, the momentary\nlaceration of a wounded spirit, made sensitive by a recent collision\nwith the Minion of Power--in other words, with a ribald Turncock\nattached to the water-works--and will pity, not condemn, its excesses.\"\n\nMr. Micawber then embraced Mrs. Micawber, and pressed my hand; leaving\nme to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water\nhad been cut off that afternoon, in consequence of default in the\npayment of the company's rates.\n\nTo divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject, I informed Mr.\nMicawber that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch, and led him to the\nlemons. His recent despondency, not to say despair, was gone in a\nmoment. I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance\nof lemon-peel and sugar, the odor of burning rum, and the steam of\nboiling water, as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon. It was wonderful to\nsee his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate fumes,\nas he stirred, and mixed, and tasted, and looked as if he were making,\ninstead of punch, a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity.\nAs to Mrs. Micawber, I don't know whether it was the effect of the cap,\nor the lavender-water, or the pins, or the fire, or the wax candles, but\nshe came out of my room, comparatively speaking, lovely. And the lark\nwas never gayer than that excellent woman.\n\nI suppose--I never ventured to inquire, but I suppose--that Mrs.\nCrupp, after frying the soles, was taken ill. Because we broke down\nat that point. The leg of mutton came up very red within, and very\npale without: besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature\nsprinkled over it, as if it had had a fall into the ashes of that\nremarkable kitchen fire-place. But we were not in a condition to judge\nof this fact from the appearance of the gravy, forasmuch as the \"young\ngal\" had dropped it all upon the stairs--where it remained, by-the-by,\nin a long train, until it was worn out. The pigeon-pie was not bad,\nbut it was a delusive pie: the crust being like a disappointing head,\nphrenologically speaking: full of lumps and bumps, with nothing\nparticular underneath. In short, the banquet was such a failure that I\nshould have been quite unhappy--about the failure, I mean, for I was\nalways unhappy about Dora--if I had not been relieved by the great\ngood-humour of my company, and by a bright suggestion from Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"My dear friend Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"accidents will occur\nin the best regulated families; and in families not regulated by that\npervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances the--a--I would\nsay, in short, by the influence of Woman, in the lofty character of\nWife, they may be expected with confidence, and must be borne with\nphilosophy. If you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that\nthere are few comestibles better, in their way, than a Devil, and that I\nbelieve, with a little division of labor, we could accomplish a good one\nif the young person in attendance could produce a gridiron, I would put\nit to you, that this little misfortune may be easily repaired.\"\n\nThere was a gridiron in the pantry, on which my morning rasher of bacon\nwas cooked. We had it in, in a twinkling, and immediately applied\nourselves to carrying Mr. Micawber's idea into effect. The division of\nlabor to which he had referred was this:--Traddles cut the mutton into\nslices; Mr. Micawber (who could do anything of this sort to perfection)\ncovered them with pepper, mustard, salt, and cayenne; I put them on the\ngridiron, turned them with a fork, and took them off, under Mr.\nMicawber's directions; and Mrs. Micawber heated, and continually\nstirred, some mushroom ketchup in a little saucepan. When we had slices\nenough done to begin upon, we fell-to, with our sleeves still tucked up\nat the wrists, more slices sputtering and blazing on the fire, and our\nattention divided between the mutton on our plates, and the mutton then\npreparing.\n\nWhat with the novelty of this cookery, the excellence of it, the bustle\nof it, the frequent starting up to look after it, the frequent sitting\ndown to dispose of it as the crisp slices came off the gridiron hot and\nhot, the being so busy, so flushed with the fire, so amused, and in the\nmidst of such a tempting noise and savor, we reduced the leg of mutton\nto the bone. My own appetite came back miraculously. I am ashamed to\nrecord it, but I really believe I forgot Dora for a little while. I am\nsatisfied that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber could not have enjoyed the feast\nmore if they had sold a bed to provide it. Traddles laughed as heartily,\nalmost the whole time, as he ate and worked. Indeed we all did, all at\nonce; and I dare say there never was a greater success.\n\nWe were at the height of our enjoyment, and were all busily engaged, in\nour several departments, endeavouring to bring the last batch of slices\nto a state of perfection that should crown the feast, when I was aware\nof a strange presence in the room, and my eyes encountered those of the\nstaid Littimer, standing hat in hand before me.\n\n  [Illustration: We are disturbed in our cookery.]\n\n\"What's the matter!\" I involuntarily asked.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, I was directed to come in. Is my master not\nhere, sir?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you not seen him, sir?\"\n\n\"No; don't you come from him?\"\n\n\"Not immediately so, sir.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you you would find him here?\"\n\n\"Not exactly so, sir. But I should think he might be here to-morrow, as\nhe has not been here to-day.\"\n\n\"Is he coming up from Oxford?\"\n\n\"I beg, sir,\" he returned respectfully, \"that you will be seated, and\nallow me to do this.\" With which he took the fork from my unresisting\nhand, and bent over the gridiron, as if his whole attention were\nconcentrated on it.\n\nWe should not have been much discomposed, I dare say, by the appearance\nof Steerforth himself, but we became in a moment the meekest of the\nmeek before his respectable serving-man. Mr. Micawber, humming a tune,\nto show that he was quite at ease, subsided into his chair, with the\nhandle of a hastily-concealed fork sticking out of the bosom of his\ncoat, as if he had stabbed himself. Mrs. Micawber put on her brown\ngloves, and assumed a genteel languor. Traddles ran his greasy hands\nthrough his hair, and stood it bolt upright, and stared in confusion at\nthe table-cloth. As for me, I was a mere infant at the head of my own\ntable; and hardly ventured to glance at the respectable phenomenon, who\nhad come from Heaven knows where, to put my establishment to rights.\n\nMeanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron, and gravely handed it\nround. We all took some, but our appreciation of it was gone, and we\nmerely made a show of eating it. As we severally pushed away our plates,\nhe noiselessly removed them, and set on the cheese. He took that off,\ntoo, when it was done with; cleared the table; piled everything on the\ndumb-waiter; gave us our wine-glasses; and, of his own accord, wheeled\nthe dumb-waiter into the pantry. All this was done in a perfect manner,\nand he never raised his eyes from what he was about. Yet, his very\nelbows, when he had his back towards me, seemed to teem with the\nexpression of his fixed opinion that I was extremely young.\n\n\"Can I do anything more, sir?\"\n\nI thanked him and said, No; but would he take no dinner himself?\n\n\"None, I am obliged to you, sir.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford?\"\n\n\"I should imagine that he might be here to-morrow, sir. I rather thought\nhe might have been here to-day, sir. The mistake is mine, no doubt,\nsir.\"\n\n\"If you should see him first--\" said I.\n\n\"If you'll excuse me, sir, I don't think I shall see him first.\"\n\n\"In case you do,\" said I, \"pray say that I am sorry he was not here\nto-day, as an old schoolfellow of his was here.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir!\" and he divided a bow between me and Traddles, with a\nglance at the latter.\n\nHe was moving softly to the door, when, in a forlorn hope of saying\nsomething naturally--which I never could, to this man--I said:\n\n\"Oh! Littimer!\"\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"Did you remain long at Yarmouth, that time?\"\n\n\"Not particularly so, sir.\"\n\n\"You saw the boat completed?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I remained behind on purpose to see the boat completed.\"\n\n\"I know!\" He raised his eyes to mine respectfully. \"Mr. Steerforth has\nnot seen it yet, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I really can't say, sir. I think--but I really can't say, sir. I wish\nyou good night, sir.\"\n\nHe comprehended everybody present, in the respectful bow with which he\nfollowed these words, and disappeared. My visitors seemed to breathe\nmore freely when he was gone; but my own relief was very great, for\nbesides the constraint, arising from that extraordinary sense of being\nat a disadvantage which I always had in this man's presence, my\nconscience had embarrassed me with whispers that I had mistrusted his\nmaster, and I could not repress a vague uneasy dread that he might find\nit out. How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I\nalways _did_ feel as if this man were finding me out?\n\nMr. Micawber roused me from this reflection, which was blended with a\ncertain remorseful apprehension of seeing Steerforth himself, by\nbestowing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable\nfellow, and a thoroughly admirable servant. Mr. Micawber, I may remark,\nhad taken his full share of the general bow, and had received it with\ninfinite condescension.\n\n\"But punch, my dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, tasting it, \"like\ntime and tide, waits for no man. Ah! it is at the present moment in high\nflavor. My love, will you give me your opinion?\"\n\nMrs. Micawber pronounced it excellent.\n\n\"Then I will drink,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"if my friend Copperfield will\npermit me to take that social liberty, to the days when my friend\nCopperfield and myself were younger, and fought our way in the world\nside by side. I may say, of myself and Copperfield, in words we have\nsung together before now, that\n\n                    We twa' hae run about the braes\n                    And pu'd the gowans fine\n\n--in a figurative point of view--on several occasions. I am not exactly\naware,\" said Mr. Micawber, with the old roll in his voice, and the old\nindescribable air of saying something genteel, \"what gowans may be, but\nI have no doubt that Copperfield and myself would frequently have taken\na pull at them, if it had been feasible.\"\n\nMr. Micawber, at the then present moment, took a pull at his punch. So\nwe all did: Traddles evidently lost in wondering at what distant time\nMr. Micawber and I could possibly have been comrades in the battle of\nthe world.\n\n\"Ahem!\" said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat, and warming with the\npunch and with the fire. \"My dear, another glass?\"\n\nMrs. Micawber said it must be very little, but we couldn't allow that,\nso it was a glassful.\n\n\"As we are quite confidential here, Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, sipping her punch, \"Mr. Traddles being a part of our\ndomesticity, I should much like to have your opinion on Mr. Micawber's\nprospects. For corn,\" said Mrs. Micawber argumentatively, \"as I have\nrepeatedly said to Mr. Micawber, may be gentlemanly, but it is not\nremunerative. Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a\nfortnight cannot, however limited our ideas, be considered\nremunerative.\"\n\nWe were all agreed upon that.\n\n\"Then,\" said Mrs. Micawber, who prided herself on taking a clear view of\nthings, and keeping Mr. Micawber straight by her woman's wisdom, when he\nmight otherwise go a little crooked, \"then I ask myself this question.\nIf corn is not to be relied upon, what is? Are coals to be relied upon?\nNot at all. We have turned our attention to that experiment, on the\nsuggestion of my family, and we find it fallacious.\"\n\nMr. Micawber, leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets,\neyed us aside, and nodded his head, as much as to say that the case was\nvery clearly put.\n\n\"The articles of corn and coals,\" said Mrs. Micawber, still more\nargumentatively, \"being equally out of the question, Mr. Copperfield, I\nnaturally look round the world, and say, 'What is there in which a\nperson of Mr. Micawber's talent is likely to succeed?' And I exclude the\ndoing anything on commission, because commission is not a certainty.\nWhat is best suited to a person of Mr. Micawber's peculiar temperament,\nis, I am convinced, a certainty.\"\n\nTraddles and I both expressed, by a feeling murmur, that this great\ndiscovery was no doubt true of Mr. Micawber, and that it did him much\ncredit.\n\n\"I will not conceal from you, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, \"that _I_ have long felt the Brewing business to be\nparticularly adapted to Mr. Micawber. Look at Barclay and Perkins! Look\nat Truman, Hanbury, and Buxton! It is on that extensive footing that Mr.\nMicawber, I know from my own knowledge of him, is calculated to shine;\nand the profits, I am told, are e-NOR--mous! But if Mr. Micawber cannot\nget into those firms--which decline to answer his letters, when he\noffers his services even in an inferior capacity--what is the use of\ndwelling upon that idea? None. I may have a conviction that Mr.\nMicawber's manners\"--\n\n\"Hem! Really, my dear,\" interposed Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"My love, be silent,\" said Mrs. Micawber, laying her brown glove on his\nhand. \"I may have a conviction, Mr. Copperfield, that Mr. Micawber's\nmanners peculiarly qualify him for the Banking business. I may argue\nwithin myself, that if _I_ had a deposit at a banking-house, the\nmanners of Mr. Micawber, as representing that banking-house, would\ninspire confidence, and must extend the connexion. But if the various\nbanking-houses refuse to avail themselves of Mr. Micawber's abilities,\nor receive the offer of them with contumely, what is the use of\ndwelling upon _that_ idea? None. As to originating a banking-business,\nI may know that there are members of my family who, if they chose to\nplace their money in Mr. Micawber's hands, might found an establishment\nof that description. But if they do _not_ choose to place their money\nin Mr. Micawber's hands--which they don't--what is the use of that?\nAgain I contend that we are no farther advanced than we were before.\"\n\nI shook my head, and said, \"Not a bit.\" Traddles also shook his head,\nand said, \"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"What do I deduce from this?\" Mrs. Micawber went on to say, still with\nthe same air of putting a case lucidly. \"What is the conclusion, my dear\nMr. Copperfield, to which I am irresistibly brought? Am I wrong in\nsaying, it is clear that we must live?\"\n\nI answered, \"Not at all!\" and Traddles answered, \"Not at all!\" and I\nfound myself afterwards sagely adding, alone, that a person must either\nlive or die.\n\n\"Just so,\" returned Mrs. Micawber. \"It is precisely that. And the fact\nis, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that we can _not_ live without something\nwidely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up. Now I\nam convinced, myself, and this I have pointed out to Mr. Micawber\nseveral times of late, that things cannot be expected to turn up of\nthemselves. We must, in a measure, assist to turn them up. I may be\nwrong, but I have formed that opinion.\"\n\nBoth Traddles and I applauded it highly.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Micawber. \"Then what do I recommend? Here is Mr.\nMicawber, with a variety of qualifications--with great talent--\"\n\n\"Really, my love,\" said Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"Pray, my dear, allow me to conclude. Here is Mr. Micawber, with a\nvariety of qualifications, with great talent--_I_ should say, with\ngenius, but that may be the partiality of a wife--\"\n\nTraddles and I both murmured \"No.\"\n\n\"And here is Mr. Micawber without any suitable position or employment.\nWhere does that responsibility rest? Clearly on society. Then I would\nmake a fact so disgraceful known, and boldly challenge society to set it\nright. It appears to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber,\nforcibly, \"that what Mr. Micawber has to do, is to throw down the\ngauntlet to society, and say, in effect, 'Show me who will take that up.\nLet the party immediately step forward.'\"\n\nI ventured to ask Mrs. Micawber how this was to be done.\n\n\"By advertising,\" said Mrs. Micawber--\"in all the papers. It appears to\nme, that what Mr. Micawber has to do, in justice to himself, in justice\nto his family, and I will even go so far as to say in justice to\nsociety, by which he has been hitherto overlooked, is to advertise in\nall the papers; to describe himself plainly as so and so, with such and\nsuch qualifications, and to put it thus: '_Now_ employ me, on\nremunerative terms, and address, post-paid, to _W. M._, Post Office,\nCamden Town.'\"\n\n\"This idea of Mrs. Micawber's, my dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nmaking his shirt-collar meet in front of his chin, and glancing at me\nsideways, \"is, in fact, the Leap to which I alluded, when I last had the\npleasure of seeing you.\"\n\n\"Advertising is rather expensive,\" I remarked, dubiously.\n\n\"Exactly so!\" said Mrs. Micawber, preserving the same logical air.\n\"Quite true, my dear Mr. Copperfield! I have made the identical\nobservation to Mr. Micawber. It is for that reason especially, that I\nthink Mr. Micawber ought (as I have already said, in justice to himself,\nin justice to his family, and in justice to society) to raise a certain\nsum of money--on a bill.\"\n\nMr. Micawber, leaning back in his chair, trifled with his eye-glass, and\ncast his eyes up at the ceiling; but I thought him observant of Traddles\ntoo, who was looking at the fire.\n\n\"If no member of my family,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"is possessed of\nsufficient natural feeling to negotiate that bill--I believe there is a\nbetter business-term to express what I mean--\"\n\nMr. Micawber, with his eyes still cast up at the ceiling, suggested\n\"Discount.\"\n\n\"To discount that bill,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"then my opinion is, that\nMr. Micawber should go into the City, should take that bill into the\nMoney Market, and should dispose of it for what he can get. If the\nindividuals in the Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber to sustain a great\nsacrifice, that is between themselves and their consciences. I view it,\nsteadily, as an investment. I recommend Mr. Micawber, my dear Mr.\nCopperfield, to do the same; to regard it as an investment which is sure\nof return, and to make up his mind to _any_ sacrifice.\"\n\nI felt, but I am sure I don't know why, that this was self-denying and\ndevoted in Mrs. Micawber, and I uttered a murmur to that effect.\nTraddles, who took his tone from me, did likewise, still looking at the\nfire.\n\n\"I will not,\" said Mrs. Micawber, finishing her punch, and gathering her\nscarf about her shoulders, preparatory to her withdrawal to my bedroom:\n\"I will not protract these remarks on the subject of Mr. Micawber's\npecuniary affairs. At your fireside, my dear Mr. Copperfield, and in the\npresence of Mr. Traddles, who, though not so old a friend, is quite one\nof ourselves, I could not refrain from making you acquainted with the\ncourse _I_ advise Mr. Micawber to take. I feel that the time is arrived\nwhen Mr. Micawber should exert himself and--I will add--assert himself,\nand it appears to me that these are the means. I am aware that I am\nmerely a female, and that a masculine judgment is usually considered\nmore competent to the discussion of such questions; still I must not\nforget that, when I lived at home with my papa and mama, my papa was in\nthe habit of saying, 'Emma's form is fragile, but her grasp of a subject\nis inferior to none.' That my papa was too partial, I well know; but\nthat he was an observer of character in some degree, my duty and my\nreason equally forbid me to doubt.\"\n\nWith these words, and resisting our entreaties that she would grace\nthe remaining circulation of the punch with her presence, Mrs. Micawber\nretired to my bed-room. And really I felt that she was a noble\nwoman--the sort of woman who might have been a Roman matron, and done\nall manner of heroic things, in times of public trouble.\n\nIn the fervor of this impression, I congratulated Mr. Micawber on the\ntreasure he possessed. So did Traddles. Mr. Micawber extended his\nhand to each of us in succession, and then covered his face with his\npocket-handkerchief, which I think had more snuff upon it than he\nwas aware of. He then returned to the punch, in the highest state of\nexhilaration.\n\nHe was full of eloquence. He gave us to understand that in our children\nwe lived again, and that, under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties,\nany accession to their number was doubly welcome. He said that Mrs.\nMicawber had latterly had her doubts on this point, but that he had\ndispelled them, and reassured her. As to her family, they were totally\nunworthy of her, and their sentiments were utterly indifferent to him,\nand they might--I quote his own expression--go to the Devil.\n\nMr. Micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on Traddles. He said\nTraddles's was a character, to the steady virtues of which he (Mr.\nMicawber) could lay no claim, but which, he thanked Heaven, he could\nadmire. He feelingly alluded to the young lady, unknown, whom Traddles\nhad honored with his affection, and who had reciprocated that affection\nby honoring and blessing Traddles with _her_ affection. Mr. Micawber\npledged her. So did I. Traddles thanked us both, by saying, with a\nsimplicity and honesty I had sense enough to be quite charmed with, \"I\nam very much obliged to you indeed. And I do assure you, she's the\ndearest girl!--\"\n\nMr. Micawber took an early opportunity, after that, of hinting, with the\nutmost delicacy and ceremony, at the state of _my_ affections. Nothing\nbut the serious assurance of his friend Copperfield to the contrary, he\nobserved, could deprive him of the impression that his friend\nCopperfield loved and was beloved. After feeling very hot and\nuncomfortable for some time, and after a good deal of blushing,\nstammering, and denying, I said, having my glass in my hand, \"Well! I\nwould give them D.!\" which so excited and gratified Mr. Micawber, that\nhe ran with a glass of punch into my bed-room, in order that Mrs.\nMicawber might drink D., who drank it with enthusiasm, crying from\nwithin, in a shrill voice, \"Hear, hear! My dear Mr. Copperfield, I am\ndelighted. Hear!\" and tapping at the wall, by way of applause.\n\nOur conversation, afterwards, took a more worldly turn; Mr. Micawber\ntelling us that he found Camden Town inconvenient, and that the first\nthing he contemplated doing, when the advertisement should have been the\ncause of something satisfactory turning up, was to move. He mentioned a\nterrace at the western end of Oxford Street, fronting Hyde Park, on\nwhich he had always had his eye, but which he did not expect to attain\nimmediately, as it would require a large establishment. There would\nprobably be an interval, he explained, in which he should content\nhimself with the upper part of a house, over some respectable place of\nbusiness,--say in Piccadilly,--which would be a cheerful situation for\nMrs. Micawber; and where, by throwing out a bow window, or carrying up\nthe roof another story, or making some little alteration of that sort,\nthey might live, comfortably and reputably, for a few years. Whatever\nwas reserved for him, he expressly said, or wherever his abode might be,\nwe might rely on this--there would always be a room for Traddles, and a\nknife and fork for me. We acknowledged his kindness; and he begged us to\nforgive his having launched into these practical and business-like\ndetails, and to excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely new\narrangements in life.\n\nMrs. Micawber, tapping at the wall again, to know if tea were ready,\nbroke up this particular phase of our friendly conversation. She made\ntea for us in a most agreeable manner; and, whenever I went near her, in\nhanding about the tea-cups and bread-and-butter, asked me, in a whisper,\nwhether D. was fair, or dark, or whether she was short, or tall: or\nsomething of that kind; which I think I liked. After tea, we discussed a\nvariety of topics before the fire; and Mrs. Micawber was good enough to\nsing us (in a small, thin, flat voice, which I remember to have\nconsidered, when I first knew her, the very table-beer of acoustics) the\nfavorite ballads of \"The Dashing White Serjeant,\" and \"Little Tafflin.\"\nFor both of these songs Mrs. Micawber had been famous when she lived at\nhome with her papa and mama. Mr. Micawber told us, that when he heard\nher sing the first one, on the first occasion of his seeing her beneath\nthe parental roof, she had attracted his attention in an extraordinary\ndegree; but that when it came to Little Tafflin, he had resolved to win\nthat woman or perish in the attempt.\n\nIt was between ten and eleven o'clock when Mrs. Micawber rose to replace\nher cap in the whitey-brown paper parcel, and to put on her bonnet. Mr.\nMicawber took the opportunity of Traddles putting on his great coat, to\nslip a letter into my hand, with a whispered request that I would read\nit at my leisure. I also took the opportunity of my holding a candle\nover the bannisters to light them down, when Mr. Micawber was going\nfirst, leading Mrs. Micawber, and Traddles was following with the cap,\nto detain Traddles for a moment on the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Traddles,\" said I, \"Mr. Micawber don't mean any harm, poor fellow; but,\nif I were you, I wouldn't lend him anything.\"\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" returned Traddles, smiling, \"I haven't got\nanything to lend.\"\n\n\"You have got a name, you know,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh! You call _that_ something to lend?\" returned Traddles, with a\nthoughtful look.\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Traddles. \"Yes, to be sure! I am very much obliged to you,\nCopperfield; but--I am afraid I have lent him that already.\"\n\n\"For the bill that is to be a certain investment?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No,\" said Traddles. \"Not for that one. This is the first I have heard\nof that one. I have been thinking that he will most likely propose that\none, on the way home. Mine's another.\"\n\n\"I hope there will be nothing wrong about it,\" said I.\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Traddles. \"I should think not, though, because he\ntold me, only the other day, that it was provided for. That was Mr.\nMicawber's expression. 'Provided for.'\"\n\nMr. Micawber looking up at this juncture to where we were standing, I\nhad only time to repeat my caution. Traddles thanked me, and descended.\nBut I was much afraid, when I observed the good-natured manner in which\nhe went down with the cap in his hand, and gave Mrs. Micawber his arm,\nthat he would be carried into the Money Market neck and heels.\n\nI returned to my fireside, and was musing, half gravely and half\nlaughing, on the character of Mr. Micawber and the old relations between\nus, when I heard a quick step ascending the stairs. At first, I thought\nit was Traddles coming back for something Mrs. Micawber had left behind;\nbut as the step approached, I knew it, and felt my heart beat high, and\nthe blood rush to my face, for it was Steerforth's.\n\nI was never unmindful of Agnes, and she never left that sanctuary in my\nthoughts--if I may call it so--where I had placed her from the first.\nBut when he entered, and stood before me with his hand out, the darkness\nthat had fallen on him changed to light, and I felt confounded and\nashamed of having doubted one I loved so heartily. I loved her none the\nless; I thought of her as the same benignant, gentle angel in my life; I\nreproached myself, not her, with having done him an injury; and I would\nhave made him any atonement if I had known what to make, and how to make\nit.\n\n\"Why, Daisy, old boy, dumb-foundered!\" laughed Steerforth, shaking my\nhand heartily, and throwing it gaily away. \"Have I detected you in\nanother feast, you Sybarite! These Doctors' Commons fellows are the\ngayest men in town, I believe, and beat us sober Oxford people all to\nnothing!\" His bright glance went merrily round the room, as he took the\nseat on the sofa opposite to me, which Mrs. Micawber had recently\nvacated, and stirred the fire into a blaze.\n\n\"I was so surprised at first,\" said I, giving him welcome with all the\ncordiality I felt, \"that I had hardly breath to greet you with,\nSteerforth.\"\n\n\"Well, the sight of me _is_ good for sore eyes, as the Scotch say,\"\nreplied Steerforth, \"and so is the sight of you, Daisy, in full bloom.\nHow are you, my Bacchanal?\"\n\n\"I am very well,\" said I; \"and not at all Bacchanalian to-night, though\nI confess to another party of three.\"\n\n\"All of whom I met in the street, talking loud in your praise,\" returned\nSteerforth. \"Who's our friend in the tights?\"\n\nI gave him the best idea I could, in a few words, of Mr. Micawber. He\nlaughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman, and said he\nwas a man to know, and he must know him.\n\n\"But who do you suppose our other friend is?\" said I, in my turn.\n\n\"Heaven knows,\" said Steerforth. \"Not a bore, I hope? I thought he\nlooked a little like one.\"\n\n\"Traddles!\" I replied, triumphantly.\n\n\"Who's he?\" asked Steerforth, in his careless way.\n\n\"Don't you remember Traddles? Traddles in our room at Salem House?\"\n\n\"Oh! That fellow!\" said Steerforth, beating a lump of coal on the top of\nthe fire, with the poker. \"Is he as soft as ever? And where the deuce\ndid you pick _him_ up?\"\n\nI extolled Traddles in reply, as highly as I could; for I felt that\nSteerforth rather slighted him. Steerforth, dismissing the subject with\na light nod, and a smile, and the remark that he would be glad to see\nthe old fellow too, for he had always been an odd fish, inquired if I\ncould give him anything to eat? During most of this short dialogue, when\nhe had not been speaking in a wild vivacious manner, he had sat idly\nbeating on the lump of coal with the poker. I observed that he did the\nsame thing while I was getting out the remains of the pigeon-pie, and so\nforth.\n\n\"Why, Daisy, here's a supper for a king!\" he exclaimed, starting out of\nhis silence with a burst, and taking his seat at the table. \"I shall do\nit justice, for I have come from Yarmouth.\"\n\n\"I thought you came from Oxford?\" I returned.\n\n\"Not I,\" said Steerforth. \"I have been seafaring--better employed.\"\n\n\"Littimer was here to-day, to inquire for you,\" I remarked, \"and I\nunderstood him that you were at Oxford; though, now I think of it, he\ncertainly did not say so.\"\n\n\"Littimer is a greater fool than I thought him, to have been inquiring\nfor me at all,\" said Steerforth, jovially pouring out a glass of wine,\nand drinking to me. \"As to understanding him, you are a cleverer fellow\nthan most of us, Daisy, if you can do that.\"\n\n\"That's true, indeed,\" said I, moving my chair to the table. \"So you\nhave been at Yarmouth, Steerforth!\" interested to know all about it.\n\"Have you been there long?\"\n\n\"No,\" he returned. \"An _escapade_ of a week or so.\"\n\n\"And how are they all? Of course, little Emily is not married yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Going to be, I believe--in so many weeks, or months, or\nsomething or other. I have not seen much of 'em. By-the-by;\" he laid\ndown his knife and fork, which he had been using with great diligence,\nand began feeling in his pockets; \"I have a letter for you.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"Why, from your old nurse,\" he returned, taking some papers out of\nhis breast pocket. \"'J. Steerforth, Esquire, debtor, to the Willing\nMind;' that's not it. Patience, and we'll find it presently. Old\nwhat's-his-name's in a bad way, and it's about that, I believe.\"\n\n\"Barkis, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" still feeling in his pockets, and looking over their contents:\n\"it's all over with poor Barkis, I am afraid. I saw a little apothecary\nthere--surgeon, or whatever he is--who brought your worship into the\nworld. He was mighty learned about the case, to me; but the upshot of\nhis opinion was, that the carrier was making his last journey rather\nfast.--Put your hand into the breast pocket of my great coat on the\nchair yonder, and I think you'll find the letter. Is it there?\"\n\n\"Here it is!\" said I.\n\n\"That's right!\"\n\nIt was from Peggotty; something less legible than usual, and brief. It\ninformed me of her husband's hopeless state, and hinted at his being \"a\nlittle nearer\" than heretofore, and consequently more difficult to\nmanage for his own comfort. It said nothing of her weariness and\nwatching, and praised him highly. It was written with a plain,\nunaffected, homely piety that I knew to be genuine, and ended with \"my\nduty to my ever darling\"--meaning myself.\n\nWhile I deciphered it, Steerforth continued to eat and drink.\n\n\"It's a bad job,\" he said, when I had done; \"but the sun sets every day,\nand people die every minute, and we mustn't be scared by the common lot.\nIf we failed to hold our own, because that equal foot at all men's doors\nwas heard knocking somewhere, every object in this world would slip from\nus. No! Ride on! Rough-shod if need be, smooth-shod if that will do, but\nride on! Ride over all obstacles, and win the race!\"\n\n\"And win what race?\" said I.\n\n\"The race that one has started in,\" said he. \"Ride on!\"\n\nI noticed, I remember, as he paused, looking at me with his handsome\nhead a little thrown back, and his glass raised in his hand, that,\nthough the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face, and it was ruddy,\nthere were traces in it, made since I last saw it, as if he had applied\nhimself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which, when\nroused, was so passionately roused within him. I had it in my thoughts\nto remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy\nthat he took--such as this buffetting of rough seas, and braving of hard\nweather, for example--when my mind glanced off to the immediate subject\nof our conversation again, and pursued that instead.\n\n\"I tell you what, Steerforth,\" said I, \"if your high spirits will listen\nto me\"--\n\n\"They are potent spirits, and will do whatever you like,\" he answered,\nmoving from the table to the fireside again.\n\n\"Then I tell you what, Steerforth. I think I will go down and see my old\nnurse. It is not that I can do her any good, or render her any real\nservice; but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much\neffect on her, as if I could do both. She will take it so kindly that it\nwill be a comfort and support to her. It is no great effort to make, I\nam sure, for such a friend as she has been to me. Wouldn't you go a\nday's journey, if you were in my place?\"\n\nHis face was thoughtful, and he sat considering a little before he\nanswered, in a low voice, \"Well! Go. You can do no harm.\"\n\n\"You have just come back,\" said I, \"and it would be in vain to ask you\nto go with me?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" he returned. \"I am for Highgate to-night. I have not seen\nmy mother this long time, and it lies upon my conscience, for\nit's something to be loved as she loves her prodigal son.--Bah!\nNonsense!--You mean to go to-morrow, I suppose?\" he said, holding me\nout at arm's length, with a hand on each of my shoulders.\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"Well, then, don't go till next day. I wanted you to come and stay a few\ndays with us. Here I am, on purpose to bid you, and you fly off to\nYarmouth!\"\n\n\"You are a nice fellow to talk of flying off, Steerforth, who are always\nrunning wild on some unknown expedition or other!\"\n\nHe looked at me for a moment without speaking, and then rejoined, still\nholding me as before, and giving me a shake:\n\n\"Come! Say the next day, and pass as much of to-morrow as you can with\nus! Who knows when we may meet again, else? Come! Say the next day! I\nwant you to stand between Rosa Dartle and me, and keep us asunder.\"\n\n\"Would you love each other too much, without me?\"\n\n\"Yes; or hate,\" laughed Steerforth; \"no matter which. Come! Say the next\nday!\"\n\nI said the next day; and he put on his great-coat, and lighted his\ncigar, and set off to walk home. Finding him in this intention, I put on\nmy own great-coat (but did not light my own cigar, having had enough of\nthat for one while) and walked with him as far as the open road: a dull\nroad, then, at night. He was in great spirits all the way; and when we\nparted, and I looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward, I\nthought of his saying, \"Ride on over all obstacles, and win the race!\"\nand wished, for the first time, that he had some worthy race to run.\n\nI was undressing in my own room, when Mr. Micawber's letter tumbled on\nthe floor. Thus reminded of it, I broke the seal and read as follows. It\nwas dated an hour and a half before dinner. I am not sure whether I have\nmentioned that, when Mr. Micawber was at any particularly desperate\ncrisis, he used a sort of legal phraseology: which he seemed to think\nequivalent to winding up his affairs.\n\n     \"Sir--for I dare not say, my dear Copperfield,\n\n     \"It is expedient that I should inform you that the undersigned\n     is Crushed. Some flickering efforts to spare you the premature\n     knowledge of his calamitous position, you may observe in him this\n     day; but hope has sunk beneath the horizon, and the undersigned is\n     Crushed.\n\n     \"The present communication is penned within the personal range (I\n     cannot call it the society) of an individual, in a state closely\n     bordering on intoxication, employed by a broker. That individual\n     is in legal possession of the premises, under a distress for rent.\n     His inventory includes, not only the chattels and effects of every\n     description belonging to the undersigned, as yearly tenant of this\n     habitation, but also those appertaining to Mr. Thomas Traddles,\n     lodger, a member of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple.\n\n     \"If any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup, which\n     is now 'commended' (in the language of an immortal Writer) to\n     the lips of the undersigned, it would be found in the fact,\n     that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned, by the\n     before-mentioned Mr. Thomas Traddles, for the sum of \u00c2\u00a323 4_s._\n     9\u00c2\u00bd_d._ is over due, and is NOT provided for.

I knew enough of Mr. Micawber by this time, to foresee\nthat _he_ might be expected to recover the blow; but my night's rest was\nsorely distressed by thoughts of Traddles, and of the curate's daughter,\nwho was one of ten, down in Devonshire, and who was such a dear girl,\nand who would wait for Traddles (ominous praise!) until she was sixty,\nor any age that could be mentioned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nI VISIT STEERFORTH AT HIS HOME, AGAIN.\n\n\nI mentioned to Mr. Spenlow in the morning, that I wanted leave of\nabsence for a short time; and as I was not in the receipt of any salary,\nand consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable Jorkins, there was\nno difficulty about it. I took that opportunity, with my voice sticking\nin my throat, and my sight failing as I uttered the words, to express my\nhope that Miss Spenlow was quite well; to which Mr. Spenlow replied,\nwith no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human\nbeing, that he was much obliged to me, and she was very well.\n\nWe articled clerks, as germs of the patrician order of proctors, were\ntreated with so much consideration, that I was almost my own master at\nall times. As I did not care, however, to get to Highgate before one or\ntwo o'clock in the day, and as we had another little excommunication\ncase in court that morning, which was called The office of the Judge\npromoted by Tipkins against Bullock for his soul's correction, I passed\nan hour or two in attendance on it with Mr. Spenlow very agreeably. It\narose out of a scuffle between two churchwardens, one of whom was\nalleged to have pushed the other against a pump; the handle of which\npump projecting into a school-house, which school-house was under a\ngable of the church-roof, made the push an ecclesiastical offence. It\nwas an amusing case; and sent me up to Highgate, on the box of the\nstage-coach, thinking about the Commons, and what Mr. Spenlow had said\nabout touching the Commons and bringing down the country.\n\nMrs. Steerforth was pleased to see me, and so was Rosa Dartle. I was\nagreeably surprised to find that Littimer was not there, and that we\nwere attended by a modest little parlor-maid, with blue ribbons in her\ncap, whose eye it was much more pleasant, and much less disconcerting,\nto catch by accident, than the eye of that respectable man. But what I\nparticularly observed, before I had been half-an-hour in the house, was\nthe close and attentive watch Miss Dartle kept upon me; and the lurking\nmanner in which she seemed to compare my face with Steerforth's, and\nSteerforth's with mine, and to lie in wait for something to come out\nbetween the two. So surely as I looked towards her, did I see that eager\nvisage, with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow, intent on mine; or\npassing suddenly from mine to Steerforth's; or comprehending both of us\nat once. In this lynx-like scrutiny she was so far from faltering when\nshe saw I observed it, that at such a time she only fixed her piercing\nlook upon me with a more intent expression still. Blameless as I was,\nand knew that I was, in reference to any wrong she could possibly\nsuspect me of, I shrunk before her strange eyes, quite unable to endure\ntheir hungry lustre.\n\nAll day, she seemed to pervade the whole house. If I talked to\nSteerforth in his room, I heard her dress rustle in the little gallery\noutside. When he and I engaged in some of our old exercises on the lawn\nbehind the house, I saw her face pass from window to window, like a\nwandering light, until it fixed itself in one, and watched us. When we\nall four went out walking in the afternoon, she closed her thin hand on\nmy arm like a spring, to keep me back, while Steerforth and his mother\nwent on out of hearing: and then spoke to me.\n\n\"You have been a long time,\" she said, \"without coming here. Is your\nprofession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole\nattention? I ask because I always want to be informed, when I am\nignorant. Is it really, though?\"\n\nI replied that I liked it well enough, but that I certainly could not\nclaim so much for it.\n\n\"Oh! I am glad to know that, because I always like to be put right when\nI am wrong,\" said Rosa Dartle. \"You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?\"\n\nWell, I replied; perhaps it _was_ a little dry.\n\n\"Oh! and that's a reason why you want relief and change--excitement, and\nall that?\" said she. \"Ah! very true! But isn't it a little----Eh?--for\nhim; I don't mean you?\"\n\nA quick glance of her eye towards the spot where Steerforth was walking,\nwith his mother leaning on his arm, showed me whom she meant; but beyond\nthat, I was quite lost. And I looked so, I have no doubt.\n\n\"Don't it--I don't say that it _does_, mind I want to know--don't it\nrather engross him? Don't it make him, perhaps, a little more remiss\nthan usual in his visits to his blindly doting--eh?\" With another quick\nglance at them, and such a glance at me as seemed to look into my\ninnermost thoughts.\n\n\"Miss Dartle,\" I returned, \"pray do not think--\"\n\n\"I don't!\" she said. \"Oh, dear me, don't suppose that I think anything!\nI am not suspicious. I only ask a question. I don't state any opinion. I\nwant to found an opinion on what you tell me. Then, it's not so? Well! I\nam very glad to know it.\"\n\n\"It certainly is not the fact,\" said I, perplexed, \"that I am\naccountable for Steerforth's having been away from home longer than\nusual--if he has been: which I really don't know at this moment, unless\nI understand it from you. I have not seen him this long while, until\nlast night.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Miss Dartle, no!\"\n\nAs she looked full at me, I saw her face grow sharper and paler, and the\nmarks of the old wound lengthen out until it cut through the disfigured\nlip, and deep into the nether lip, and slanted down the face. There was\nsomething positively awful to me in this, and in the brightness of her\neyes, as she said, looking fixedly at me:\n\n\"What is he doing?\"\n\nI repeated the words, more to myself than her, being so amazed.\n\n\"What is he doing?\" she said, with an eagerness that seemed enough to\nconsume her like a fire. \"In what is that man assisting him, who never\nlooks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes? If you are\nhonorable and faithful, I don't ask you to betray your friend. I ask you\nonly to tell me, is it anger, is it hatred, is it pride, is it\nrestlessness, is it some wild fancy, is it love, _what is it_, that is\nleading him?\"\n\n\"Miss Dartle,\" I returned, \"how shall I tell you, so that you will\nbelieve me, that I know of nothing in Steerforth different from what\nthere was when I first came here. I can think of nothing. I firmly\nbelieve there is nothing. I hardly understand, even, what you mean.\"\n\nAs she still looked fixedly at me, a twitching or throbbing, from which\nI could not dissociate the idea of pain, came into that cruel mark; and\nlifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn, or with a pity that\ndespised its object. She put her hand upon it hurriedly--a hand so thin\nand delicate, that when I had seen her hold it up before the fire to\nshade her face, I had compared it in my thoughts to fine porcelain--and\nsaying, in a quick, fierce, passionate way, \"I swear you to secresy\nabout this!\" said not a word more.\n\nMrs. Steerforth was particularly happy in her son's society, and\nSteerforth was, on this occasion, particularly attentive and respectful\nto her. It was very interesting to me to see them together, not only on\naccount of their mutual affection, but because of the strong personal\nresemblance between them, and the manner in which what was haughty or\nimpetuous in him was softened by age and sex, in her, to a gracious\ndignity. I thought, more than once, that it was well no serious cause of\ndivision had ever come between them; or two such natures--I ought rather\nto express it, two such shades of the same nature--might have been\nharder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation. The\nidea did not originate in my own discernment, I am bound to confess, but\nin a speech of Rosa Dartle's.\n\nShe said at dinner:\n\n\"Oh, but do tell me, though, somebody, because I have been thinking\nabout it all day, and I want to know.\"\n\n\"You want to know what, Rosa?\" returned Mrs. Steerforth. \"Pray, pray,\nRosa, do not be mysterious.\"\n\n\"Mysterious!\" she cried. \"Oh! really? Do you consider me so?\"\n\n\"Do I constantly entreat you,\" said Mrs. Steerforth, \"to speak plainly,\nin your own natural manner?\"\n\n\"Oh! then, this is _not_ my natural manner?\" she rejoined. \"Now you must\nreally bear with me, because I ask for information. We never know\nourselves.\"\n\n\"It has become a second nature,\" said Mrs. Steerforth, without any\ndispleasure; \"but I remember,--and so must you, I think,--when your\nmanner was different, Rosa; when it was not so guarded, and was more\ntrustful.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are right,\" she returned; \"and so it is that bad habits\ngrow upon one! Really? Less guarded and more trustful? How _can_ I,\nimperceptibly, have changed, I wonder! Well, that's very odd! I must\nstudy to regain my former self.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" said Mrs. Steerforth, with a smile.\n\n\"Oh! I really will, you know!\" she answered. \"I will learn frankness\nfrom--let me see--from James.\"\n\n\"You cannot learn frankness, Rosa,\" said Mrs. Steerforth, quickly--for\nthere was always some effect of sarcasm in what Rosa Dartle said, though\nit was said, as this was, in the most unconscious manner in the\nworld--\"in a better school.\"\n\n\"That I am sure of,\" she answered, with uncommon fervour. \"If I am sure\nof anything, of course, you know, I am sure of that.\"\n\nMrs. Steerforth appeared to me to regret having been a little nettled;\nfor she presently said, in a kind tone:\n\n\"Well, my dear Rosa, we have not heard what it is that you want to be\nsatisfied about?\"\n\n\"That I want to be satisfied about?\" she replied, with provoking\ncoldness. \"Oh! It was only whether people, who are like each other in\ntheir moral constitution--is that the phrase?\"\n\n\"It's as good a phrase as another,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Thank you:--whether people, who are like each other in their moral\nconstitution, are in greater danger than people not so circumstanced,\nsupposing any serious cause of variance to arise between them, of being\ndivided angrily and deeply?\"\n\n\"I should say yes,\" said Steerforth.\n\n\"Should you?\" she retorted. \"Dear me! Supposing then, for instance,--any\nunlikely thing will do for a supposition--that you and your mother were\nto have a serious quarrel.\"\n\n\"My dear Rosa,\" interposed Mrs. Steerforth, laughing good-naturedly,\n\"suggest some other supposition! James and I know our duty to each other\nbetter, I pray Heaven!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Miss Dartle, nodding her head thoughtfully. \"To be sure.\n_That_ would prevent it? Why, of course it would. Ex-actly. Now, I am\nglad I have been so foolish as to put the case, for it is so very good\nto know that your duty to each other would prevent it! Thank you very\nmuch.\"\n\nOne other little circumstance connected with Miss Dartle I must not\nomit; for I had reason to remember it thereafter, when all the\nirremediable past was rendered plain. During the whole of this day, but\nespecially from this period of it, Steerforth exerted himself with his\nutmost skill, and that was with his utmost ease, to charm this singular\ncreature into a pleasant and pleased companion. That he should succeed,\nwas no matter of surprise to me. That she should struggle against the\nfascinating influence of his delightful art--delightful nature I thought\nit then--did not surprise me either; for I knew that she was sometimes\njaundiced and perverse. I saw her features and her manner slowly change;\nI saw her look at him with growing admiration; I saw her try, more and\nmore faintly, but always angrily, as if she condemned a weakness in\nherself, to resist the captivating power that he possessed; and finally\nI saw her sharp glance soften, and her smile become quite gentle, and I\nceased to be afraid of her as I had really been all day, and we all sat\nabout the fire, talking and laughing together, with as little reserve as\nif we had been children.\n\nWhether it was because we had sat there so long, or because Steerforth\nwas resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained, I do not know; but\nwe did not remain in the dining-room more than five minutes after her\ndeparture. \"She is playing her harp,\" said Steerforth, softly, at the\ndrawing-room door, \"and nobody but my mother has heard her do that, I\nbelieve, these three years.\" He said it with a curious smile, which was\ngone directly; and we went into the room and found her alone.\n\n\"Don't get up!\" said Steerforth (which she had already done); \"my dear\nRosa, don't! Be kind for once, and sing us an Irish song.\"\n\n\"What do you care for an Irish song?\" she returned.\n\n\"Much!\" said Steerforth. \"Much more than for any other. Here is Daisy,\ntoo, loves music from his soul. Sing us an Irish song, Rosa! and let me\nsit and listen as I used to do.\"\n\nHe did not touch her, or the chair from which she had risen, but sat\nhimself near the harp. She stood beside it for some little while, in a\ncurious way, going through the motion of playing it with her right hand,\nbut not sounding it. At length she sat down, and drew it to her with one\nsudden action, and played and sang.\n\nI don't know what it was, in her touch or voice, that made that song the\nmost unearthly I have ever heard in my life, or can imagine. There was\nsomething fearful in the reality of it. It was as if it had never been\nwritten, or set to music, but sprung out of the passion within her;\nwhich found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice, and\ncrouched again when all was still. I was dumb when she leaned beside the\nharp again, playing it, but not sounding it, with her right hand.\n\nA minute more, and this had roused me from my trance:--Steerforth had\nleft his seat, and gone to her, and had put his arm laughingly about\nher, and had said, \"Come, Rosa, for the future we will love each other\nvery much!\" And she had struck him, and had thrown him off with the fury\nof a wild cat, and had burst out of the room.\n\n\"What is the matter with Rosa?\" said Mrs. Steerforth, coming in.\n\n\"She has been an angel, mother,\" returned Steerforth, \"for a little\nwhile; and has run into the opposite extreme, since, by way of\ncompensation.\"\n\n\"You should be careful not to irritate her, James. Her temper has been\nsoured, remember, and ought not to be tried.\"\n\nRosa did not come back; and no other mention was made of her, until I\nwent with Steerforth into his room to say Good night. Then he laughed\nabout her, and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of\nincomprehensibility.\n\nI expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of\nexpression, and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken\nso much amiss, so suddenly.\n\n\"Oh, Heaven knows,\" said Steerforth. \"Any thing you like--or nothing! I\ntold you she took every thing, herself included, to a grindstone, and\nsharpened it. She is an edge-tool, and requires great care in dealing\nwith. She is always dangerous. Good night!\"\n\n\"Good night!\" said I, \"my dear Steerforth! I shall be gone before you\nwake in the morning. Good night!\"\n\nHe was unwilling to let me go; and stood, holding me out, with a hand on\neach of my shoulders, as he had done in my own room.\n\n\"Daisy,\" he said, with a smile--\"for though that's not the name your\nGodfathers and Godmothers gave you, it's the name I like best to call\nyou by--and I wish, I wish, I wish, you could give it to me!\"\n\n\"Why so I can, if I choose,\" said I.\n\n\"Daisy, if anything should ever separate us, you must think of me at my\nbest, old boy. Come! Let us make that bargain. Think of me at my best,\nif circumstances should ever part us!\"\n\n\"You have no best to me, Steerforth,\" said I, \"and no worst. You are\nalways equally loved, and cherished in my heart.\"\n\nSo much compunction for having ever wronged him, even by a shapeless\nthought, did I feel within me, that the confession of having done so was\nrising to my lips. But for the reluctance I had, to betray the\nconfidence of Agnes, but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject\nwith no risk of doing so, it would have reached them before he said,\n\"God bless you, Daisy, and good night!\" In my doubt, it did _not_ reach\nthem; and we shook hands, and we parted.\n\nI was up with the dull dawn, and, having dressed as quietly as I could,\nlooked into his room. He was fast asleep; lying, easily, with his head\nupon his arm, as I had often seen him lie at school.\n\nThe time came in its season, and that was very soon, when I almost\nwondered that nothing troubled his repose, as I looked at him. But he\nslept--let me think of him so again--as I had often seen him sleep at\nschool; and thus, in this silent hour, I left him.\n\n--Never more, oh God forgive you, Steerforth! to touch that passive hand\nin love and friendship. Never, never, more!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nA LOSS.\n\n\nI got down to Yarmouth in the evening, and went to the inn. I knew that\nPeggotty's spare room--my room--was likely to have occupation enough in\na little while, if that great Visitor, before whose presence all the\nliving must give place, were not already in the house; so I betook\nmyself to the inn, and dined there, and engaged my bed.\n\nIt was ten o'clock when I went out. Many of the shops were shut, and the\ntown was dull. When I came to Omer and Joram's, I found the shutters up,\nbut the shop door standing open. As I could obtain a perspective view of\nMr. Omer inside, smoking his pipe by the parlor-door, I entered, and\nasked him how he was.\n\n\"Why, bless my life and soul!\" said Mr. Omer, \"how do you find yourself?\nTake a seat.--Smoke not disagreeable, I hope?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said I. \"I like it--in somebody else's pipe.\"\n\n\"What, not in your own, eh?\" Mr. Omer returned, laughing. \"All the\nbetter, sir. Bad habit for a young man. Take a seat. I smoke, myself,\nfor the asthma.\"\n\nMr. Omer had made room for me, and placed a chair. He now sat down\nagain, very much out of breath, gasping at his pipe as if it contained a\nsupply of that necessary, without which he must perish.\n\n\"I am sorry to have heard bad news of Mr. Barkis,\" said I.\n\nMr. Omer looked at me, with a steady countenance, and shook his head.\n\n\"Do you know how he is to-night?\" I asked.\n\n\"The very question I should have put to you, sir,\" returned Mr. Omer,\n\"but on account of delicacy. It's one of the drawbacks of our line of\nbusiness. When a party's ill, we _can't_ ask how the party is.\"\n\nThe difficulty had not occurred to me; though I had had my apprehensions\ntoo, when I went in, of hearing the old tune. On its being mentioned, I\nrecognised it, however, and said as much.\n\n\"Yes, yes, you understand,\" said Mr. Omer, nodding his head. \"We\ndurstn't do it. Bless you, it would be a shock that the generality of\nparties mightn't recover, to say 'Omer and Jorams's compliments, and how\ndo you find yourself this morning'--or this afternoon--as it may be.\"\n\nMr. Omer and I nodded at each other, and Mr. Omer recruited his wind by\nthe aid of his pipe.\n\n\"It's one of the things that cut the trade off from attentions they\ncould often wish to show,\" said Mr. Omer. \"Take myself. If I have known\nBarkis a year, to move to as he went by, I have known him forty year.\nBut _I_ can't go and say 'how is he?'\"\n\nI felt it was rather hard on Mr. Omer, and I told him so.\n\n\"I'm not more self-interested, I hope, than another man,\" said Mr. Omer.\n\"Look at me! My wind may fail me at any moment, and it ain't likely\nthat, to my own knowledge, I'd be self-interested under such\ncircumstances. I say it ain't likely, in a man who knows his wind will\ngo, when it _does_ go, as if a pair of bellows was cut open; and that\nman a grandfather,\" said Mr. Omer.\n\nI said, \"Not at all.\"\n\n\"It ain't that I complain of my line of business,\" said Mr. Omer. \"It\nain't that. Some good and some bad goes, no doubt, to all callings. What\nI wish, is, that parties were brought up stronger-minded.\"\n\nMr. Omer, with a very complacent and amiable face, took several puffs in\nsilence; and then said, resuming his first point.\n\n\"Accordingly we're obleeged, in ascertaining how Barkis goes on, to\nlimit ourselves to Em'ly. She knows what our real objects are, and she\ndon't have any more alarms or suspicions about us, than if we was so\nmany lambs. Minnie and Joram have just stepped down to the house, in\nfact (she's there, after hours, helping her aunt a bit), to ask her how\nhe is to-night; and if you was to please to wait till they come back,\nthey'd give you full partic'lers. Will you take something? A glass of\nsrub and water, now? I smoke on srub and water, myself,\" said Mr. Omer,\ntaking up his glass, \"because it's considered softening to the passages,\nby which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action. But, Lord\nbless you,\" said Mr. Omer, huskily, \"it ain't the passages that's out of\norder! 'Give me breath enough,' says I to my daughter Minnie, 'and\n_I_'ll find passages, my dear.'\"\n\nHe really had no breath to spare, and it was very alarming to see him\nlaugh. When he was again in a condition to be talked to, I thanked him\nfor the proffered refreshment, which I declined, as I had just had\ndinner; and, observing that I would wait, since he was so good as to\ninvite me, until his daughter and his son-in-law came back, I inquired\nhow little Emily was?\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Omer, removing his pipe, that he might rub his\nchin; \"I tell you truly, I shall be glad when her marriage has taken\nplace.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Well, she's unsettled at present,\" said Mr. Omer. \"It ain't that she's\nnot as pretty as ever, for she's prettier--I do assure you, she is\nprettier. It ain't that she don't work as well as ever, for she does.\nShe _was_ worth any six, and she _is_ worth any six. But somehow she\nwants heart. If you understand,\" said Mr. Omer, after rubbing his chin\nagain, and smoking a little, \"what I mean in a general way by the\nexpression, 'A long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull altogether, my\nhearties, hurrah!' I should say to you, that _that_ was--in a general\nway--what I miss in Em'ly.\"\n\nMr. Omer's face and manner went for so much, that I could\nconscientiously nod my head, as divining his meaning. My quickness of\napprehension seemed to please him, and he went on:\n\n\"Now, I consider this is principally on account of her being in an\nunsettled state, you see. We have talked it over a good deal, her uncle\nand myself, and her sweetheart and myself, after business; and I\nconsider it is principally on account of her being unsettled. You must\nalways recollect of Em'ly,\" said Mr. Omer, shaking his head gently,\n\"that she's a most extraordinary affectionate little thing. The proverb\nsays, 'You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.' Well, I don't\nknow about that. I rather think you may, if you begin early in life. She\nhas made a home out of that old boat, sir, that stone and marble\ncouldn't beat.\"\n\n\"I am sure she has!\" said I.\n\n\"To see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle,\" said Mr.\nOmer; \"to see the way she holds on to him, tighter and tighter, and\ncloser and closer, every day, is to see a sight. Now, you know, there's\na struggle going on when that's the case. Why should it be made a longer\none than is needful?\"\n\nI listened attentively to the good old fellow, and acquiesced, with all\nmy heart, in what he said.\n\n\"Therefore, I mentioned to them,\" said Mr. Omer, in a comfortable,\neasy-going tone, \"this. I said, 'Now, don't consider Em'ly nailed down\nin point of time, at all. Make it your own time. Her services have been\nmore valuable than was supposed; her learning has been quicker than was\nsupposed; Omer and Joram can run their pen through what remains; and\nshe's free when you wish. If she likes to make any little arrangement,\nafterwards, in the way of doing any little thing for us at home,\nvery well. If she don't, very well still. We're no losers, anyhow.'\nFor--don't you see,\" said Mr. Omer, touching me with his pipe, \"it\nain't likely that a man so short of breath as myself, and a grandfather\ntoo, would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed\nblossom, like _her_?\"\n\n\"Not at all, I am certain,\" said I.\n\n\"Not at all! You're right!\" said Mr. Omer. \"Well, sir, her cousin--you\nknow it's a cousin she's going to be married to?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" I replied. \"I know him well.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" said Mr. Omer. \"Well, sir! Her cousin being, as it\nappears, in good work, and well to do, thanked me in a very manly sort\nof manner for this (conducting himself altogether, I must say, in a way\nthat gives me a high opinion of him), and went and took as comfortable a\nlittle house as you or I could wish to clap eyes on. That little house\nis now furnished, right through, as neat and complete as a doll's\nparlor; and but for Barkis's illness having taken this bad turn, poor\nfellow, they would have been man and wife--I dare say, by this time. As\nit is, there's a postponement.\"\n\n\"And Emily, Mr. Omer?\" I inquired. \"Has she become more settled?\"\n\n\"Why that, you know,\" he returned, rubbing his double chin again, \"can't\nnaturally be expected. The prospect of the change and separation, and\nall that, is, as one may say, close to her and far away from her, both\nat once. Barkis's death needn't put it off much, but his lingering\nmight. Anyway, it's an uncertain state of matters, you see.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said I.\n\n\"Consequently,\" pursued Mr. Omer, \"Em'ly's still a little down, and a\nlittle fluttered; perhaps, upon the whole, she's more so than she was.\nEvery day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle, and more loth\nto part from all of us. A kind word from me brings the tears into her\neyes; and if you was to see her with my daughter Minnie's little girl,\nyou'd never forget it. Bless my heart alive!\" said Mr. Omer, pondering,\n\"how she loves that child!\"\n\nHaving so favourable an opportunity, it occurred to me to ask Mr. Omer,\nbefore our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his\ndaughter and her husband, whether he knew anything of Martha.\n\n\"Ah!\" he rejoined, shaking his head, and looking very much dejected. \"No\ngood. A sad story, sir, however you come to know it. I never thought\nthere was harm in the girl. I wouldn't wish to mention it before my\ndaughter Minnie--for she'd take me up directly--but I never did. None of\nus ever did.\"\n\nMr. Omer, hearing his daughter's footstep before I heard it, touched me\nwith his pipe, and shut up one eye, as a caution. She and her husband\ncame in immediately afterwards.\n\nTheir report was, that Mr. Barkis was \"as bad as bad could be;\" that he\nwas quite unconscious; and that Mr. Chillip had mournfully said in the\nkitchen, on going away just now, that the College of Physicians, the\nCollege of Surgeons, and Apothecaries' Hall, if they were all called in\ntogether, couldn't help him. He was past both Colleges, Mr. Chillip\nsaid, and the Hall could only poison him.\n\nHearing this, and learning that Mr. Peggotty was there, I determined to\ngo to the house at once. I bade good night to Mr. Omer, and to Mr. and\nMrs. Joram; and directed my steps thither, with a solemn feeling, which\nmade Mr. Barkis quite a new and different creature.\n\nMy low tap at the door was answered by Mr. Peggotty. He was not so much\nsurprised to see me as I had expected. I remarked this in Peggotty, too,\nwhen she came down; and I have seen it since; and I think, in the\nexpectation of that dread surprise, all other changes and surprises\ndwindle into nothing.\n\nI shook hands with Mr. Peggotty, and passed into the kitchen, while he\nsoftly closed the door. Little Emily was sitting by the fire, with her\nhands before her face. Ham was standing near her.\n\nWe spoke in whispers; listening, between whiles, for any sound in the\nroom above. I had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit,\nbut how strange it was to me now, to miss Mr. Barkis out of the kitchen!\n\n\"This is very kind of you, Mas'r Davy,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"It is oncommon kind,\" said Ham.\n\n\"Em'ly, my dear,\" cried Mr. Peggotty. \"See here! Here's Mas'r Davy come!\nWhat, cheer up, pretty! Not a wured to Mas'r Davy?\"\n\nThere was a trembling upon her, that I can see now. The coldness of her\nhand when I touched it, I can feel yet. Its only sign of animation was\nto shrink from mine; and then she glided from the chair, and, creeping\nto the other side of her uncle, bowed herself, silently and trembling\nstill, upon his breast.\n\n\"It's such a loving art,\" said Mr. Peggotty, smoothing her rich hair\nwith his great hard hand, \"that it can't abear the sorrer of this. It's\nnat'ral in young folk, Mas'r Davy, when they're new to these here\ntrials, and timid, like my little bird,--it's nat'ral.\"\n\nShe clung the closer to him, but neither lifted up her face, nor spoke a\nword.\n\n\"It's getting late, my dear,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"and here's Ham come\nfur to take you home. Theer! Go along with t'other loving art! What,\nEm'ly? Eh, my pretty?\"\n\nThe sound of her voice had not reached me, but he bent his head as if he\nlistened to her, and then said:\n\n\"Let you stay with your uncle? Why, you doen't mean to ask me that! Stay\nwith your uncle, Moppet? When your husband that'll be so soon, is here\nfur to take you home? Now a person wouldn't think it, fur to see this\nlittle thing alongside a rough-weather chap like me,\" said Mr. Peggotty,\nlooking round at both of us, with infinite pride; \"but the sea ain't\nmore salt in it than she has fondness in her for her uncle--a foolish\nlittle Em'ly!\"\n\n\"Em'ly's in the right in that, Mas'r Davy!\" said Ham. \"Lookee here! As\nEm'ly wishes of it, and as she's hurried and frightened, like, besides,\nI'll leave her till morning. Let me stay too!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"You doen't ought--a married man like\nyou--or what's as good--to take and hull away a day's work. And you\ndoen't ought to watch and work both. That won't do. You go home and\nturn in. You ain't afeerd of Em'ly not being took good care on, _I_\nknow.\"\n\nHam yielded to this persuasion, and took his hat to go. Even when he\nkissed her,--and I never saw him approach her, but I felt that nature\nhad given him the soul of a gentleman,--she seemed to cling closer to\nher uncle, even to the avoidance of her chosen husband. I shut the door\nafter him, that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that\nprevailed; and when I turned back, I found Mr. Peggotty still talking to\nher.\n\n\"Now, I'm a going up-stairs to tell your aunt as Mas'r Davy's here, and\nthat'll cheer her up a bit,\" he said. \"Sit ye down by the fire, the\nwhile, my dear, and warm these mortal cold hands. You doen't need to be\nso fearsome, and take on so much. What? You'll go along with me?--Well!\ncome along with me--come! If her uncle was turned out of house and home,\nand forced to lay down in a dyke, Mas'r Davy,\" said Mr. Peggotty, with\nno less pride than before, \"it's my belief she'd go along with him, now!\nBut there'll be some one else, soon,--some one else, soon, Em'ly!\"\n\nAfterwards, when I went up-stairs, as I passed the door of my little\nchamber, which was dark, I had an indistinct impression of her being\nwithin it, cast down upon the floor. But, whether it was really she, or\nwhether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room, I don't know now.\n\nI had leisure to think, before the kitchen-fire, of pretty little\nEm'ly's dread of death--which, added to what Mr. Omer had told me, I\ntook to be the cause of her being so unlike herself--and I had leisure,\nbefore Peggotty came down, even to think more leniently of the weakness\nof it: as I sat counting the ticking of the clock, and deepening my\nsense of the solemn hush around me. Peggotty took me in her arms, and\nblessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to\nher (that was what she said) in her distress. She then entreated me to\ncome up-stairs, sobbing that Mr. Barkis had always liked me and admired\nme; that he had often talked of me, before he fell into a stupor; and\nthat she believed, in case of his coming to himself again, he would\nbrighten up at sight of me, if he could brighten up at any earthly\nthing.\n\nThe probability of his ever doing so, appeared to me, when I saw him, to\nbe very small. He was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed, in\nan uncomfortable attitude, half resting on the box which had cost him so\nmuch pain and trouble. I learned, that, when he was past creeping out of\nbed to open it, and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the\ndivining rod I had seen him use, he had required to have it placed on\nthe chair at the bed-side, where he had ever since embraced it, night\nand day. His arm lay on it now. Time and the world were slipping from\nbeneath him, but the box was there; and the last words he had uttered\nwere (in an explanatory tone) \"Old clothes!\"\n\n\"Barkis, my dear!\" said Peggotty, almost cheerfully: bending over him,\nwhile her brother and I stood at the bed's foot. \"Here's my dear boy--my\ndear boy, Master Davy, who brought us together, Barkis! That you sent\nmessages by, you know! Won't you speak to Master Davy?\"\n\nHe was as mute and senseless as the box, from which his form derived the\nonly expression it had.\n\n\"He's a going out with the tide,\" said Mr. Peggotty to me, behind his\nhand.\n\nMy eyes were dim, and so were Mr. Peggotty's; but I repeated in a\nwhisper, \"With the tide?\"\n\n  [Illustration: I find Mr. Barkis \"going out with the tide.\"]\n\n\"People can't die, along the coast,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"except when\nthe tide's pretty nigh out. They can't be born, unless it's pretty nigh\nin--not properly born, till flood. He's a going out with the tide. It's\nebb at half arter three, slack water half-an-hour. If he lives 'till it\nturns, he'll hold his own till past the flood, and go out with the next\ntide.\"\n\nWe remained there, watching him, a long time--hours. What mysterious\ninfluence my presence had upon him in that state of his senses, I shall\nnot pretend to say; but when he at last began to wander feebly, it is\ncertain he was muttering about driving me to school.\n\n\"He's coming to himself,\" said Peggotty.\n\nMr. Peggotty touched me, and whispered with much awe and reverence,\n\"They are both a going out fast.\"\n\n\"Barkis, my dear!\" said Peggotty.\n\n\"C. P. Barkis,\" he cried, faintly. \"No better woman anywhere!\"\n\n\"Look! Here's Master Davy!\" said Peggotty. For he now opened his eyes.\n\nI was on the point of asking him if he knew me, when he tried to stretch\nout his arm, and said to me, distinctly, with a pleasant smile:\n\n\"Barkis is willin'!\"\n\nAnd, it being low water, he went out with the tide.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nA GREATER LOSS.\n\n\nIt was not difficult for me, on Peggotty's solicitation, to resolve to\nstay where I was, until after the remains of the poor carrier should\nhave made their last journey to Blunderstone. She had long ago bought,\nout of her own savings, a little piece of ground in our old churchyard\nnear the grave \"of her sweet girl,\" as she always called my mother; and\nthere they were to rest.\n\nIn keeping Peggotty company, and doing all I could for her (little\nenough at the utmost), I was as grateful, I rejoice to think, as even\nnow I could wish myself to have been. But I am afraid I had a supreme\nsatisfaction, of a personal and professional nature, in taking charge of\nMr. Barkis's will, and expounding its contents.\n\nI may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the\nwill should be looked for in the box. After some search, it was found\nin the box, at the bottom of a horse's nose-bag; wherein (besides hay)\nthere was discovered an old gold watch, with chain and seals, which\nMr. Barkis had worn on his wedding-day, and which had never been seen\nbefore or since; a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg; an\nimitation lemon, full of minute cups and saucers, which I have some\nidea Mr. Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a\nchild, and afterwards found himself unable to part with; eighty-seven\nguineas and a half, in guineas and half guineas; two hundred and ten\npounds, in perfectly clean Bank notes; certain receipts for Bank of\nEngland stock; an old horse-shoe, a bad shilling, a piece of camphor,\nand an oyster-shell. From the circumstance of the latter article having\nbeen much polished, and displaying prismatic colours on the inside, I\nconclude that Mr. Barkis had some general ideas about pearls, which\nnever resolved themselves into anything definite.\n\nFor years and years, Mr. Barkis had carried this box, on all his\njourneys, every day. That it might the better escape notice, he had\ninvented a fiction that it belonged to \"Mr. Blackboy,\" and was \"to be\nleft with Barkis till called for;\" a fable he had elaborately written on\nthe lid, in characters now scarcely legible.\n\nHe had hoarded, all these years, I found, to good purpose. His property\nin money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds. Of this he bequeathed\nthe interest of one thousand to Mr. Peggotty for his life; on his\ndecease, the principal to be equally divided between Peggotty, little\nEmily, and me, or the survivor or survivors of us, share and share\nalike. All the rest he died possessed of, he bequeathed to Peggotty;\nwhom he left residuary legatee, and sole executrix of that his last will\nand testament.\n\nI felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all\npossible ceremony, and set forth its provisions, any number of times, to\nthose whom they concerned. I began to think there was more in the\nCommons than I had supposed. I examined the will with the deepest\nattention, pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects, made a\npencil-mark or so in the margin, and thought it rather extraordinary\nthat I knew so much.\n\nIn this abstruse pursuit; in making an account for, Peggotty, of all the\nproperty into which she had come; in arranging all the affairs in an\norderly manner; and in being her referee and adviser on every point, to\nour joint delight; I passed the week before the funeral. I did not see\nlittle Emily in that interval, but they told me she was to be quietly\nmarried in a fortnight.\n\nI did not attend the funeral in character, if I may venture to say so. I\nmean I was not dressed up in a black cloak and a streamer, to frighten\nthe birds; but I walked over to Blunderstone early in the morning, and\nwas in the churchyard when it came, attended only by Peggotty and her\nbrother. The mad gentleman looked on, out of my little window; Mr.\nChillip's baby wagged its heavy head, and rolled its goggle eyes, at the\nclergyman, over its nurse's shoulder; Mr. Omer breathed short in the\nbackground; no one else was there; and it was very quiet. We walked\nabout the churchyard for an hour, after all was over; and pulled some\nyoung leaves from the tree above my mother's grave.\n\nA dread falls on me here. A cloud is lowering on the distant town,\ntowards which I retraced my solitary steps. I fear to approach it. I\ncannot bear to think of what did come, upon that memorable night; of\nwhat must come again, if I go on.\n\nIt is no worse, because I write of it. It would be no better, if I\nstopped my most unwilling hand. It is done. Nothing can undo it; nothing\ncan make it otherwise than as it was.\n\nMy old nurse was to go to London with me next day, on the business of\nthe will. Little Emily was passing that day at Mr. Omer's. We were all\nto meet in the old boathouse that night. Ham would bring Emily at the\nusual hour. I would walk back at my leisure. The brother and sister\nwould return as they had come, and be expecting us, when the day closed\nin, at the fireside.\n\nI parted from them at the wicket-gate, where visionary Straps had rested\nwith Roderick Random's knapsack in the days of yore; and, instead of\ngoing straight back, walked a little distance on the road to Lowestoft.\nThen I turned, and walked back towards Yarmouth. I stayed to dine at a\ndecent alehouse, some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned\nbefore; and thus the day wore away, and it was evening when I reached\nit. Rain was falling heavily by that time, and it was a wild night; but\nthere was a moon behind the clouds, and it was not dark.\n\nI was soon within sight of Mr. Peggotty's house, and of the light within\nit shining through the window. A little floundering across the sand,\nwhich was heavy, brought me to the door, and I went in.\n\nIt looked very comfortable, indeed. Mr. Peggotty had smoked his evening\npipe, and there were preparations for some supper by-and-by. The fire\nwas bright, the ashes were thrown up, the locker was ready for little\nEmily in her old place. In her own old place sat Peggotty, once more,\nlooking (but for her dress) as if she had never left it. She had fallen\nback, already, on the society of the work-box with Saint Paul's upon the\nlid, the yard-measure in the cottage, and the bit of wax candle: and\nthere they all were, just as if they had never been disturbed. Mrs.\nGummidge appeared to be fretting a little, in her old corner; and\nconsequently looked quite natural, too.\n\n\"You're first of the lot, Mas'r Davy!\" said Mr. Peggotty, with a happy\nface. \"Doen't keep in that coat, sir, if it's wet.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Peggotty,\" said I, giving him my outer coat to hang up.\n\"It's quite dry.\"\n\n\"So 'tis!\" said Mr. Peggotty, feeling my shoulders. \"As a chip! Sit ye\ndown, sir. It ain't o' no use saying welcome to you, but you're welcome,\nkind and hearty.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Peggotty, I am sure of that. Well, Peggotty!\" said I,\ngiving her a kiss. \"And how are you, old woman?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Peggotty, sitting down beside us, and rubbing his\nhands in his sense of relief from recent trouble, and in the genuine\nheartiness of his nature; \"there's not a woman in the wureld, sir--as\nI tell her--that need to feel more easy in her mind than her! She done\nher dooty by the departed, and the departed know'd it; and the departed\ndone what was right by her, as she done what was right by the departed;\nand--and--and it's _all_ right!\"\n\nMrs. Gummidge groaned.\n\n\"Cheer up, my pretty mawther!\" said Mr. Peggotty. (But he shook his head\naside at us, evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences\nto recal the memory of the old one.) \"Doen't be down! Cheer up, for your\nown self, on'y a little bit, and see if a good deal more doen't come\nnat'ral!\"\n\n\"Not to me, Dan'l,\" returned Mrs. Gummidge. \"Nothink's nat'ral to me but\nto be lone and lorn.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Peggotty, soothing her sorrows.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Dan'l!\" said Mrs. Gummidge. \"I ain't a person to live with\nthem as has had money left. Thinks go too contrairy with me. I had\nbetter be a riddance.\"\n\n\"Why, how should I ever spend it without you?\" said Mr. Peggotty, with\nan air of serious remonstrance. \"What are you a talking on? Doen't I\nwant you more now, than ever I did?\"\n\n\"I know'd I was never wanted before!\" cried Mrs. Gummidge, with a\npitiable whimper, \"and now I'm told so! How could I expect to be wanted,\nbeing so lone and lorn, and so contrairy!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty seemed very much shocked at himself for having made a\nspeech capable of this unfeeling construction, but was prevented from\nreplying, by Peggotty's pulling his sleeve, and shaking her head. After\nlooking at Mrs. Gummidge for some moments, in sore distress of mind, he\nglanced at the Dutch clock, rose, snuffed the candle, and put it in the\nwindow.\n\n\"Theer!\" said Mr. Peggotty, cheerily. \"Theer we are, Missis Gummidge!\"\nMrs. Gummidge slightly groaned. \"Lighted up, accordin' to custom! You're\na wonderin' what that's fur, sir! Well, it's fur our little Em'ly. You\nsee, the path ain't over light or cheerful arter dark; and when I'm here\nat the hour as she's a comin' home, I puts the light in the winder.\nThat, you see,\" said Mr. Peggotty, bending over me with great glee,\n\"meets two objects. She says, says Em'ly, 'Theer's home!' she says. And\nlikewise, says Em'ly, 'My uncle's theer!' Fur if I ain't theer, I never\nhave no light showed.\"\n\n\"You're a baby!\" said Peggotty; very fond of him for it, if she thought\nso.\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Peggotty, standing with his legs pretty wide apart,\nand rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satisfaction,\nas he looked alternately at us and at the fire, \"I doen't know but I am.\nNot, you see, to look at.\"\n\n\"Not azackly,\" observed Peggotty.\n\n\"No,\" laughed Mr. Peggotty, \"not to look at, but to--to consider on, you\nknow. _I_ doen't care, bless you! Now I tell you. When I go a looking\nand looking about that theer pritty house of our Em'ly's, I'm--I'm\nGormed,\" said Mr. Peggotty, with sudden emphasis--\"theer! I can't say\nmore--if I doen't feel as if the littlest things was her, a'most. I\ntakes 'em up and I puts 'em down, and I touches of 'em as delicate as if\nthey was our Em'ly. So 'tis with her little bonnets and that. I couldn't\nsee one on 'em rough used a purpose--not fur the whole wureld. There's a\nbabby fur you, in the form of a great Sea Porkypine!\" said Mr. Peggotty,\nrelieving his earnestness with a roar of laughter.\n\nPeggotty and I both laughed, but not so loud.\n\n\"It's my opinion, you see,\" said Mr. Peggotty, with a delighted face,\nafter some further rubbing of his legs, \"as this is along of my havin'\nplayed with her so much, and made believe as we was Turks, and French,\nand sharks, and every wariety of forinners--bless you, yes; and lions\nand whales, and I don't know what all!--when she warn't no higher than\nmy knee. I've got into the way on it, you know. Why, this here candle,\nnow!\" said Mr. Peggotty, gleefully holding out his hand towards it, \"_I_\nknow wery well that arter she's married and gone, I shall put that\ncandle theer, just the same as now. I know wery well that when I'm here\no' nights (and where else should _I_ live, bless your arts, whatever\nfortun' I come into!) and she ain't here, or I ain't theer, I shall put\nthe candle in the winder, and sit afore the fire, pretending I'm\nexpecting of her, like I'm a doing now. _There's_ a babby for you,\" said\nMr. Peggotty, with another roar, \"in the form of a Sea Porkypine! Why,\nat the present minute, when I see the candle sparkle up, I says to\nmyself, 'She's a looking at it! Em'ly's a coming!' _There's_ a babby for\nyou, in the form of a Sea Porkypine! Right for all that,\" said Mr.\nPeggotty, stopping in his roar, and smiting his hands together; \"fur\nhere she is!\"\n\nIt was only Ham. The night should have turned more wet since I came in,\nfor he had a large sou'wester hat on, slouched over his face.\n\n\"Where's Em'ly?\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\nHam made a motion with his head, as if she were outside. Mr. Peggotty\ntook the light from the window, trimmed it, put it on the table, and was\nbusily stirring the fire, when Ham, who had not moved, said:\n\n\"Mas'r Davy, will you come out a minute, and see what Em'ly and me has\ngot to show you?\"\n\nWe went out. As I passed him at the door, I saw, to my astonishment and\nfright, that he was deadly pale. He pushed me hastily into the open air,\nand closed the door upon us. Only upon us two.\n\n\"Ham! what's the matter!\"\n\n\"Mas'r Davy!--\" Oh, for his broken heart, how dreadfully he wept!\n\nI was paralyzed by the sight of such grief. I don't know what I thought,\nor what I dreaded. I could only look at him.\n\n\"Ham! Poor good fellow! For Heaven's sake tell me what's the matter!\"\n\n\"My love, Mas'r Davy--the pride and hope of my art--her that I'd have\ndied for, and would die for now--she's gone!\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"Em'ly's run away! Oh, Mas'r Davy, think _how_ she's run away, when I\npray my good and gracious God to kill her (her that is so dear above all\nthings) sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace!\"\n\nThe face he turned up to the troubled sky, the quivering of his clasped\nhands, the agony of his figure, remain associated with that lonely\nwaste, in my remembrance, to this hour. It is always night there, and he\nis the only object in the scene.\n\n\"You're a scholar,\" he said, hurriedly, \"and know what's right and best.\nWhat am I to say, in-doors? How am I ever to break it to him, Mas'r\nDavy?\"\n\nI saw the door move, and instinctively tried to hold the latch on the\noutside, to gain a moment's time. It was too late. Mr. Peggotty thrust\nforth his face; and never could I forget the change that came upon it\nwhen he saw us, if I were to live five hundred years.\n\nI remember a great wail and cry, and the women hanging about him, and we\nall standing in the room; I with a paper in my hand, which Ham had given\nme; Mr. Peggotty, with his vest torn open, his hair wild, his face and\nlips quite white, and blood trickling down his bosom (it had sprung from\nhis mouth, I think), looking fixedly at me.\n\n\"Read it, sir,\" he said, in a low shivering voice. \"Slow, please. I\ndoen't know as I can understand.\"\n\nIn the midst of the silence of death, I read thus, from a blotted\nletter.\n\n     \"'When you, who love me so much better than I ever have deserved,\n     even when my mind was innocent, see this, I shall be far away.'\"\n\n\"I shall be fur away,\" he repeated slowly. \"Stop! Em'ly fur away. Well!\"\n\n     'When I leave my dear home--my dear home--oh, my dear home!--in\n     the morning,'\n\nthe letter bore date on the previous night:\n\n     '--it will be never to come back, unless he brings me back a lady.\n     This will be found at night, many hours after, instead of me.\n     Oh, if you knew how my heart is torn. If even you, that I have\n     wronged so much, that never can forgive me, could only know what\n     I suffer! I am too wicked to write about myself. Oh, take comfort\n     in thinking that I am so bad. Oh, for mercy's sake, tell uncle\n     that I never loved him half so dear as now. Oh, don't remember how\n     affectionate and kind you have all been to me--don't remember we\n     were ever to be married--but try to think as if I died when I was\n     little, and was buried somewhere. Pray Heaven that I am going away\n     from, have compassion on my uncle! Tell him that I never loved him\n     half so dear. Be his comfort. Love some good girl, that will be\n     what I was once to uncle, and be true to you, and worthy of you,\n     and know no shame but me. God bless all! I'll pray for all, often,\n     on my knees. If he don't bring me back a lady, and I don't pray\n     for my own self, I'll pray for all. My parting love to uncle. My\n     last tears, and my last thanks, for uncle!'\"\n\nThat was all.\n\nHe stood, long after I had ceased to read, still looking at me. At\nlength I ventured to take his hand, and to entreat him, as well as I\ncould, to endeavour to get some command of himself. He replied, \"I\nthankee, sir, I thankee!\" without moving.\n\nHam spoke to him. Mr. Peggotty was so far sensible of _his_ affliction,\nthat he wrung his hand; but, otherwise, he remained in the same state,\nand no one dared to disturb him.\n\nSlowly, at last, he moved his eyes from my face, as if he were waking\nfrom a vision, and cast them round the room. Then he said, in a low\nvoice:\n\n\"Who's the man? I want to know his name.\"\n\nHam glanced at me, and suddenly I felt a shock that struck me back.\n\n\"There's a man suspected,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Mas'r Davy!\" implored Ham. \"Go out a bit, and let me tell him what I\nmust. You doen't ought to hear it, sir.\"\n\nI felt the shock again. I sank down in a chair, and tried to utter some\nreply; but my tongue was fettered, and my sight was weak.\n\n\"I want to know his name!\" I heard said, once more.\n\n\"For some time past,\" Ham faltered, \"there's been a servant about here,\nat odd times. There's been a gen'lm'n too. Both of 'em belonged to one\nanother.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty stood fixed as before, but now looking at him.\n\n\"The servant,\" pursued Ham, \"was seen along with--our poor girl--last\nnight. He's been in hiding about here, this week or over. He was thought\nto have gone, but he was hiding. Doen't stay, Mas'r Davy, doen't!\"\n\nI felt Peggotty's arm round my neck, but I could not have moved if the\nhouse had been about to fall upon me.\n\n\"A strange chay and horses was outside town, this morning, on the\nNorwich road, a'most afore the day broke,\" Ham went on. \"The servant\nwent to it, and come from it, and went to it again. When he went to it\nagain, Em'ly was nigh him. The t'other was inside. He's the man.\"\n\n\"For the Lord's love,\" said Mr. Peggotty, falling back, and putting out\nhis hand, as if to keep off what he dreaded. \"Doen't tell me his name's\nSteerforth!\"\n\n\"Mas'r Davy,\" exclaimed Ham, in a broken voice, \"it ain't no fault of\nyourn--and I am far from laying of it to you--but his name is\nSteerforth, and he's a damned villain!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty uttered no cry, and shed no tear, and moved no more, until\nhe seemed to wake again, all at once, and pulled down his rough coat\nfrom its peg in a corner.\n\n\"Bear a hand with this! I'm struck of a heap, and can't do it,\" he said,\nimpatiently. \"Bear a hand, and help me. Well!\" when somebody had done\nso. \"Now give me that theer hat!\"\n\nHam asked him whither he was going.\n\n\"I'm a going to seek my niece. I'm a going to seek my Em'ly. I'm a\ngoing, first, to stave in that theer boat, and sink it where I would\nhave drownded _him_, as I'm a livin' soul, if I had had one thought of\nwhat was in him! As he sat afore me,\" he said, wildly, holding out his\nclenched right hand, \"as he sat afore me, face to face, strike me down\ndead, but I'd have drownded him, and thought it right!--I'm a going to\nseek my niece.\"\n\n\"Where?\" cried Ham, interposing himself before the door.\n\n\"Anywhere! I'm a going to seek my niece through the wureld. I'm a going\nto find my poor niece in her shame, and bring her back. No one stop me!\nI tell you I'm a going to seek my niece!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Mrs. Gummidge, coming between them, in a fit of crying.\n\"No, no, Dan'l, not as you are now. Seek her in a little while, my lone\nlorn Dan'l, and that'll be but right; but not as you are now. Sit ye\ndown, and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you,\nDan'l--what have _my_ contrairies ever been to this!--and let us speak a\nword about them times when she was first an orphan, and when Ham was\ntoo, and when I was a poor widder woman, and you took me in. It'll\nsoften your poor heart, Dan'l,\" laying her head upon his shoulder, \"and\nyou'll bear your sorrow better; for you know the promise, Dan'l, 'As you\nhave done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto me';\nand that can never fail under this roof, that's been our shelter for so\nmany, many year!\"\n\nHe was quite passive now; and when I heard him crying, the impulse that\nhad been upon me to go down upon my knees, and ask their pardon for the\ndesolation I had caused, and curse Steerforth, yielded to a better\nfeeling. My overcharged heart found the same relief, and I cried too.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY.\n\n\nWhat is natural in me, is natural in many other men, I infer, and so I\nam not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth better than\nwhen the ties that bound me to him were broken. In the keen distress of\nthe discovery of his unworthiness, I thought more of all that was\nbrilliant in him, I softened more towards all that was good in him, I\ndid more justice to the qualities that might have made him a man of a\nnoble nature and a great name, than ever I had done in the height of my\ndevotion to him. Deeply as I felt my own unconscious part in his\npollution of an honest home, I believe that if I had been brought face\nto face with him, I could not have uttered one reproach. I should have\nloved him so well still--though he fascinated me no longer--I should\nhave held in so much tenderness the memory of my affection for him, that\nI think I should have been as weak as a spirit-wounded child, in all but\nthe entertainment of a thought that we could ever be re-united. That\nthought I never had. I felt, as he had felt, that all was at an end\nbetween us. What his remembrances of me were, I have never known--they\nwere light enough, perhaps, and easily dismissed--but mine of him were\nas the remembrances of a cherished friend, who was dead.\n\nYes, Steerforth, long removed from the scenes of this poor history! My\nsorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the Judgment Throne;\nbut my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will, I know!\n\nThe news of what had happened soon spread through the town; insomuch\nthat as I passed along the streets next morning, I overheard the people\nspeaking of it at their doors. Many were hard upon her, some few were\nhard upon him, but towards her second father and her lover there was but\none sentiment. Among all kinds of people a respect for them in their\ndistress prevailed, which was full of gentleness and delicacy. The\nseafaring men kept apart, when those two were seen early, walking with\nslow steps on the beach; and stood in knots, talking compassionately\namong themselves.\n\nIt was on the beach, close down by the sea, that I found them. It would\nhave been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night, even\nif Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left\nthem, when it was broad day. They looked worn; and I thought Mr.\nPeggotty's head was bowed in one night more than in all the years I had\nknown him. But they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself:\nthen lying beneath a dark sky, waveless--yet with a heavy roll upon it,\nas if it breathed in its rest--and touched, on the horizon, with a strip\nof silvery light from the unseen sun.\n\n\"We have had a mort of talk, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty to me, when we had\nall three walked a little while in silence, \"of what we ought and doen't\nought to do. But we see our course now.\"\n\nI happened to glance at Ham, then looking out to sea upon the distant\nlight, and a frightful thought came into my mind--not that his face was\nangry, for it was not; I recal nothing but an expression of stern\ndetermination in it--that if ever he encountered Steerforth, he would\nkill him.\n\n\"My dooty here, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"is done. I'm a going to seek\nmy--\" he stopped, and went on in a firmer voice: \"I'm a going to seek\nher. That's my dooty evermore.\"\n\nHe shook his head when I asked him where he would seek her, and inquired\nif I were going to London to-morrow? I told him I had not gone to-day,\nfearing to lose the chance of being of any service to him; but that I\nwas ready to go when he would.\n\n\"I'll go along with you, sir,\" he rejoined, \"if you're agreeable,\nto-morrow.\"\n\nWe walked again, for a while, in silence.\n\n\"Ham,\" he presently resumed, \"he'll hold to his present work, and go and\nlive along with my sister. The old boat yonder--\"\n\n\"Will you desert the old boat, Mr. Peggotty?\" I gently interposed.\n\n\"My station, Mas'r Davy,\" he returned, \"ain't there no longer; and if\never a boat foundered, since there was darkness on the face of the deep,\nthat one's gone down. But no, sir, no; I doen't mean as it should be\ndeserted. Fur from that.\"\n\nWe walked again for a while, as before, until he explained:\n\n\"My wishes is, sir, as it shall look, day and night, winter and summer,\nas it has always looked, since she first know'd it. If ever she should\ncome a wandering back, I wouldn't have the old place seem to cast her\noff, you understand, but seem to tempt her to draw nigher to 't, and to\npeep in, maybe, like a ghost, out of the wind and rain, through the old\nwinder, at the old seat by the fire. Then, maybe, Mas'r Davy, seein'\nnone but Missis Gummidge there, she might take heart to creep in,\ntrembling; and might come to be laid down in her old bed, and rest her\nweary head where it was once so gay.\"\n\nI could not speak to him in reply, though I tried.\n\n\"Every night,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"as reg'lar as the night comes, the\ncandle must be stood in its old pane of glass, that if ever she should\nsee it, it may seem to say 'Come back, my child, come back!' If ever\nthere's a knock, Ham (partic'ler a soft knock), arter dark, at your\naunt's door, doen't you go nigh it. Let it be her--not you--that sees my\nfallen child!\"\n\nHe walked a little in front of us, and kept before us for some minutes.\nDuring this interval, I glanced at Ham again, and observing the same\nexpression on his face, and his eyes still directed to the distant\nlight, I touched his arm.\n\nTwice I called him by his name, in the tone in which I might have tried\nto rouse a sleeper, before he heeded me. When I at last inquired on what\nhis thoughts were so bent, he replied:\n\n\"On what's afore me, Mas'r Davy; and over yon.\"\n\n\"On the life before you, do you mean?\" He had pointed confusedly out to\nsea.\n\n\"Ay, Mas'r Davy. I doen't rightly know how 'tis, but from over yon there\nseemed to me to come--the end of it like;\" looking at me as if he were\nwaking, but with the same determined face.\n\n\"What end?\" I asked, possessed by my former fear.\n\n\"I doen't know,\" he said thoughtfully; \"I was calling to mind that the\nbeginning of it all did take place here--and then the end come. But it's\ngone! Mas'r Davy,\" he added; answering, as I think, my look; \"you han't\nno call to be afeerd of me: but I'm kiender muddled; I doen't fare to\nfeel no matters,\"--which was as much as to say that he was not himself,\nand quite confounded.\n\nMr. Peggotty stopping for us to join him: we did so, and said no more.\nThe remembrance of this, in connexion with my former thought, however,\nhaunted me at intervals, even until the inexorable end came at its\nappointed time.\n\nWe insensibly approached the old boat, and entered. Mrs. Gummidge, no\nlonger moping in her especial corner, was busy preparing breakfast. She\ntook Mr. Peggotty's hat, and placed his seat for him, and spoke so\ncomfortably and softly, that I hardly knew her.\n\n\"Dan'l, my good man,\" said she, \"you must eat and drink, and keep up\nyour strength, for without it you'll do nowt. Try, that's a dear soul!\nAnd if I disturb you with my clicketten,\" she meant her chattering,\n\"tell me so, Dan'l, and I won't.\"\n\nWhen she had served us all, she withdrew to the window, where she\nsedulously employed herself in repairing some shirts and other clothes\nbelonging to Mr. Peggotty, and neatly folding and packing them in an old\noilskin bag, such as sailors carry. Meanwhile, she continued talking, in\nthe same quiet manner:\n\n\"All times and seasons, you know, Dan'l,\" said Mrs. Gummidge, \"I shall\nbe allus here, and every think will look accordin' to your wishes. I'm a\npoor scholar, but I shall write to you, odd times, when you're away, and\nsend my letters to Mas'r Davy. Maybe you'll write to me too, Dan'l, odd\ntimes, and tell me how you fare to feel upon your lone lorn journies.\"\n\n\"You'll be a solitary woman heer, I'm afeerd!\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"No, no, Dan'l,\" she returned, \"I shan't be that. Doen't you mind me. I\nshall have enough to do to keep a Beein for you\" (Mrs. Gummidge meant a\nhome), \"again you come back--to keep a Beein here for any that may hap\nto come back, Dan'l. In the fine time, I shall set outside the door as I\nused to do. If any _should_ come nigh, they shall see the old widder\nwoman true to 'em, a long way off.\"\n\nWhat a change in Mrs. Gummidge in a little time! She was another woman.\nShe was so devoted, she had such a quick perception of what it would\nbe well to say, and what it would be well to leave unsaid, she was so\nforgetful of herself, and so regardful of the sorrow about her, that\nI held her in a sort of veneration. The work she did that day! There\nwere many things to be brought up from the beach and stored in the\nouthouse--as oars, nets, sails, cordage, spars, lobster-pots, bags of\nballast, and the like; and though there was abundance of assistance\nrendered, there being not a pair of working hands on all that shore\nbut would have labored hard for Mr. Peggotty, and been well paid in\nbeing asked to do it, yet she persisted, all day long, in toiling under\nweights that she was quite unequal to, and fagging to and fro on all\nsorts of unnecessary errands. As to deploring her misfortunes, she\nappeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any.\nShe preserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy,\nwhich was not the least astonishing part of the change that had come\nover her. Querulousness was out of the question. I did not even observe\nher voice to falter, or a tear to escape from her eyes, the whole day\nthrough, until twilight; when she and I and Mr. Peggotty being alone\ntogether, and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion, she broke\ninto a half-suppressed fit of sobbing and crying, and taking me to\nthe door, said, \"Ever bless you, Mas'r Davy, be a friend to him, poor\ndear!\" Then, she immediately ran out of the house to wash her face,\nin order that she might sit quietly beside him, and be found at work\nthere, when he should awake. In short I left her, when I went away at\nnight, the prop and staff of Mr. Peggotty's affliction; and I could not\nmeditate enough upon the lesson that I read in Mrs. Gummidge, and the\nnew experience she unfolded to me.\n\nIt was between nine and ten o'clock when, strolling in a melancholy\nmanner through the town, I stopped at Mr. Omer's door. Mr. Omer had\ntaken it so much to heart, his daughter told me, that he had been very\nlow and poorly all day, and had gone to bed without his pipe.\n\n\"A deceitful, bad-hearted girl,\" said Mrs. Joram. \"There was no good in\nher, ever!\"\n\n\"Don't say so,\" I returned. \"You don't think so.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do!\" cried Mrs. Joram, angrily.\n\n\"No, no,\" said I.\n\nMrs. Joram tossed her head, endeavouring to be very stern and cross; but\nshe could not command her softer self, and began to cry. I was young, to\nbe sure; but I thought much the better of her for this sympathy, and\nfancied it became her, as a virtuous wife and mother, very well indeed.\n\n\"What will she ever do!\" sobbed Minnie. \"Where will she go! What will\nbecome of her! Oh, how could she be so cruel, to herself and him!\"\n\nI remembered the time when Minnie was a young and pretty girl; and I was\nglad that she remembered it too, so feelingly.\n\n\"My little Minnie,\" said Mrs. Joram, \"has only just now been got to\nsleep. Even in her sleep she is sobbing for Em'ly. All day long, little\nMinnie has cried for her, and asked me, over and over again, whether\nEm'ly was wicked? What can I say to her, when Em'ly tied a ribbon off\nher own neck round little Minnie's the last night she was here, and laid\nher head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep! The\nribbon's round my little Minnie's neck now. It ought not to be, perhaps,\nbut what can I do? Em'ly is very bad, but they were fond of one another.\nAnd the child knows nothing!\"\n\nMrs. Joram was so unhappy, that her husband came out to take care of\nher. Leaving them together, I went home to Peggotty's; more melancholy\nmyself, if possible, than I had been yet.\n\nThat good creature--I mean Peggotty--all untired by her late anxieties\nand sleepless nights, was at her brother's, where she meant to stay till\nmorning. An old woman, who had been employed about the house for some\nweeks past, while Peggotty had been unable to attend to it, was the\nhouse's only other occupant besides myself. As I had no occasion for her\nservices, I sent her to bed, by no means against her will; and sat down\nbefore the kitchen fire a little while, to think about all this.\n\nI was blending it with the deathbed of the late Mr. Barkis, and was\ndriving out with the tide towards the distance at which Ham had looked\nso singularly in the morning, when I was recalled from my wanderings by\na knock at the door. There was a knocker upon the door, but it was not\nthat which made the sound. The tap was from a hand, and low down upon\nthe door, as if it were given by a child.\n\nIt made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman to a\nperson of distinction. I opened the door; and at first looked down, to\nmy amazement, on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be\nwalking about of itself. But presently I discovered underneath it, Miss\nMowcher.\n\nI might not have been prepared to give the little creature a very kind\nreception, if, on her removing the umbrella, which her utmost efforts\nwere unable to shut up, she had shown me the \"volatile\" expression of\nface which had made so great an impression on me at our first and last\nmeeting. But her face, as she turned it up to mine, was so earnest; and\nwhen I relieved her of the umbrella (which would have been an\ninconvenient one for the Irish Giant), she wrung her little hands in\nsuch an afflicted manner; that I rather inclined towards her.\n\n\"Miss Mowcher!\" said I, after glancing up and down the empty street,\nwithout distinctly knowing what I expected to see besides; \"how do you\ncome here? What is the matter?\"\n\nShe motioned to me, with her short right arm, to shut the umbrella for\nher; and passing me hurriedly, went into the kitchen. When I had closed\nthe door, and followed, with the umbrella in my hand, I found her\nsitting on the corner of the fender--it was a low iron one, with two\nflat bars at top to stand plates upon--in the shadow of the boiler,\nswaying herself backwards and forwards, and chafing her hands upon her\nknees like a person in pain.\n\nQuite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit, and\nthe only spectator of this portentous behaviour, I exclaimed again:\n\"Pray tell me, Miss Mowcher, what is the matter! are you ill?\"\n\n\"My dear young soul,\" returned Miss Mowcher, squeezing her hands upon\nher heart one over the other. \"I am ill here, I am very ill. To think\nthat it should come to this, when I might have known it and perhaps\nprevented it, if I hadn't been a thoughtless fool!\"\n\nAgain her large bonnet (very disproportionate to her figure) went\nbackwards and forwards, in her swaying of her little body to and fro;\nwhile a most gigantic bonnet rocked, in unison with it, upon the wall.\n\n\"I am surprised,\" I began, \"to see you so distressed and serious\"--when\nshe interrupted me.\n\n\"Yes, it's always so!\" she said. \"They are all surprised, these\ninconsiderate young people, fairly and full grown, to see any natural\nfeeling in a little thing like me! They make a plaything of me, use me\nfor their amusement, throw me away when they are tired, and wonder that\nI feel more than a toy horse or a wooden soldier! Yes, yes, that's the\nway. The old way!\"\n\n\"It may be, with others,\" I returned, \"but I do assure you it is not\nwith me. Perhaps I ought not to be at all surprised to see you as you\nare now: I know so little of you. I said, without consideration, what I\nthought.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" returned the little woman, standing up, and holding out\nher arms to show herself. \"See! What I am, my father was; and my sister\nis; and my brother is. I have worked for sister and brother these many\nyears--hard, Mr. Copperfield--all day. I must live. I do no harm. If\nthere are people so unreflecting or so cruel, as to make a jest of me,\nwhat is left for me to do but to make a jest of myself, them, and every\nthing? If I do so, for the time, whose fault is that? Mine?\"\n\nNo. Not Miss Mowcher's, I perceived.\n\n\"If I had shown myself a sensitive dwarf to your false friend,\" pursued\nthe little woman, shaking her head at me, with reproachful earnestness,\n\"how much of his help or good will do you think _I_ should ever have\nhad? If little Mowcher (who had no hand, young gentleman, in the making\nof herself) addressed herself to him, or the like of him, because of her\nmisfortunes, when do you suppose her small voice would have been heard?\nLittle Mowcher would have as much need to live, if she was the bitterest\nand dullest of pigmies; but she couldn't do it. No. She might whistle\nfor her bread and butter till she died of Air!\"\n\nMiss Mowcher sat down on the fender again, and took out her\nhandkerchief, and wiped her eyes.\n\n\"Be thankful for me, if you have a kind heart as I think you have,\" she\nsaid, \"that while I know well what I am, I can be cheerful and endure it\nall. I am thankful for myself, at any rate, that I can find my tiny way\nthrough the world, without being beholden to any one; and that in return\nfor all that is thrown at me, in folly or vanity, as I go along, I can\nthrow bubbles back. If I don't brood over all I want, it is the better\nfor me, and not the worse for any one. If I am a plaything for you\ngiants, be gentle with me.\"\n\nMiss Mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket, looking at me with\nvery intent expression all the while, and pursued:\n\n\"I saw you in the street just now. You may suppose I am not able to walk\nas fast as you, with my short legs and short breath, and I couldn't\novertake you; but I guessed where you came, and came after you. I have\nbeen here before, to-day, but the good woman wasn't at home.\"\n\n\"Do you know her?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I know _of_ her, and about her,\" she replied, \"from Omer and Joram. I\nwas there at seven o'clock this morning. Do you remember what Steerforth\nsaid to me about this unfortunate girl, that time when I saw you both at\nthe inn?\"\n\nThe great bonnet on Miss Mowcher's head, and the greater bonnet on the\nwall, began to go backwards and forwards again when she asked this\nquestion.\n\nI remembered very well what she referred to, having had it in my\nthoughts many times that day. I told her so.\n\n\"May the Father of all Evil confound him,\" said the little woman,\nholding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes, \"and ten\ntimes more confound that wicked servant; but I believed it was _you_ who\nhad a boyish passion for her!\"\n\n\"I?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Child, child! In the name of blind ill-fortune,\" cried Miss Mowcher,\nwringing her hands impatiently, as she went to and fro again upon the\nfender, \"why did you praise her so, and blush, and look disturbed?\"\n\nI could not conceal from myself that I had done this, though for a\nreason very different from her supposition.\n\n\"What did I know?\" said Miss Mowcher, taking out her handkerchief again,\nand giving one little stamp on the ground whenever, at short intervals,\nshe applied it to her eyes with both hands at once. \"He was crossing you\nand wheedling you, I saw; and you were soft wax in his hands, I saw. Had\nI left the room a minute, when his man told me that 'Young Innocence'\n(so he called you, and you may call him 'Old Guilt' all the days of your\nlife) had set his heart upon her, and she was giddy and liked him, but\nhis master was resolved that no harm should come of it--more for your\nsake than for hers--and that that was their business here? How could I\n_but_ believe him? I saw Steerforth soothe and please you by his praise\nof her! You were the first to mention her name. You owned to an old\nadmiration of her. You were hot and cold, and red and white, all at once\nwhen I spoke to you of her. What could I think--what _did_ I think--but\nthat you were a young libertine in everything but experience, and had\nfallen into hands that had experience enough, and could manage you\n(having the fancy) for your own good? Oh! oh! oh! They were afraid of my\nfinding out the truth,\" exclaimed Miss Mowcher, getting off the fender,\nand trotting up and down the kitchen with her two short arms\ndistressfully lifted up, \"because I am a sharp little thing--I need be,\nto get through the world at all!--and they deceived me altogether, and I\ngave the poor unfortunate girl a letter, which I fully believe was the\nbeginning of her ever speaking to Littimer, who was left behind on\npurpose!\"\n\nI stood amazed at the revelation of all this perfidy, looking at Miss\nMowcher as she walked up and down the kitchen until she was out of\nbreath: when she sat upon the fender again, and, drying her face with\nher handkerchief, shook her head for a long time, without otherwise\nmoving, and without breaking silence.\n\n\"My country rounds,\" she added at length, \"brought me to Norwich, Mr.\nCopperfield, the night before last. What I happened to find out there,\nabout their secret way of coming and going, without you--which was\nstrange--led to my suspecting something wrong. I got into the coach from\nLondon last night, as it came through Norwich, and was here this\nmorning. Oh, oh, oh! too late!\"\n\nPoor little Mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and fretting,\nthat she turned round on the fender, putting her poor little wet feet in\namong the ashes to warm them, and sat looking at the fire, like a large\ndoll. I sat in a chair on the other side of the hearth, lost in unhappy\nreflections, and looking at the fire too, and sometimes at her.\n\n\"I must go,\" she said at last, rising as she spoke. \"It's late. You\ndon't mistrust me?\"\n\nMeeting her sharp glance, which was as sharp as ever when she asked me,\nI could not on that short challenge answer no, quite frankly.\n\n\"Come!\" said she, accepting the offer of my hand to help her over the\nfender, and looking wistfully up into my face, \"you know you wouldn't\nmistrust me, if I was a full-sized woman!\"\n\nI felt that there was much truth in this; and I felt rather ashamed of\nmyself.\n\n\"You are a young man,\" she said, nodding. \"Take a word of advice, even\nfrom three foot nothing. Try not to associate bodily defects with\nmental, my good friend, except for a solid reason.\"\n\nShe had got over the fender now, and I had got over my suspicion. I told\nher that I believed she had given me a faithful account of herself, and\nthat we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands. She\nthanked me, and said I was a good fellow.\n\n\"Now, mind!\" she exclaimed, turning back on her way to the door, and\nlooking shrewdly at me, with her forefinger up again. \"I have some\nreason to suspect, from what I have heard--my ears are always open; I\ncan't afford to spare what powers I have--that they are gone abroad. But\nif ever they return, if ever any one of them returns, while I am alive,\nI am more likely than another, going about as I do, to find it out soon.\nWhatever I know, you shall know. If ever I can do anything to serve the\npoor betrayed girl, I will do it faithfully, please Heaven! And Littimer\nhad better have a bloodhound at his back, than little Mowcher!\"\n\nI placed implicit faith in this last statement, when I marked the look\nwith which it was accompanied.\n\n\"Trust me no more, but trust me no less, than you would trust a\nfull-sized woman,\" said the little creature, touching me appealingly on\nthe wrist. \"If ever you see me again, unlike what I am now, and like\nwhat I was when you first saw me, observe what company I am in. Call to\nmind that I am a very helpless and defenceless little thing. Think of\nme at home with my brother like myself and sister like myself, when my\nday's work is done. Perhaps you won't, then, be very hard upon me, or\nsurprised if I can be distressed and serious. Good night!\"\n\nI gave Miss Mowcher my hand, with a very different opinion of her from\nthat which I had hitherto entertained, and opened the door to let her\nout. It was not a trifling business to get the great umbrella up, and\nproperly balanced in her grasp; but at last I successfully accomplished\nthis, and saw it go bobbing down the street through the rain, without\nthe least appearance of having anybody underneath it, except when a\nheavier fall than usual from some overcharged water-spout sent it\ntoppling over, on one side, and discovered Miss Mowcher struggling\nviolently to get it right. After making one or two sallies to her\nrelief, which were rendered futile by the umbrella's hopping on again,\nlike an immense bird, before I could reach it, I came in, went to bed,\nand slept till morning.\n\nIn the morning I was joined by Mr. Peggotty and by my old nurse, and we\nwent at an early hour to the coach office, where Mrs. Gummidge and Ham\nwere waiting to take leave of us.\n\n\"Mas'r Davy,\" Ham whispered, drawing me aside, while Mr. Peggotty was\nstowing his bag among the luggage, \"his life is quite broke up. He\ndoen't know wheer he's going; he doen't know what's afore him; he's\nbound upon a voyage that'll last, on and off, all the rest of his days,\ntake my wured for't, unless he finds what he's a seeking of. I am sure\nyou'll be a friend to him, Mas'r Davy?\"\n\n\"Trust me, I will indeed,\" said I, shaking hands with Ham earnestly.\n\n\"Thankee. Thankee, very kind, sir. One thing furder. I'm in good employ,\nyou know, Mas'r Davy, and I han't no way now of spending what I gets.\nMoney's of no use to me no more, except to live. If you can lay it out\nfor him, I shall do my work with a better art. Though as to that, sir,\"\nand he spoke very steadily and mildly, \"you're not to think but I shall\nwork at all times, like a man, and act the best that lays in my power!\"\n\nI told him I was well convinced of it; and I hinted that I hoped the\ntime might even come, when he would cease to lead the lonely life he\nnaturally contemplated now.\n\n\"No sir,\" he said, shaking his head, \"all that's past and over with me,\nsir. No one can never fill the place that's empty. But you'll bear in\nmind about the money, as theer's at all times some laying by for him?\"\n\nReminding him of the fact, that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady,\nthough certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late\nbrother-in-law, I promised to do so. We then took leave of each other.\nI cannot leave him, even now, without remembering with a pang, at once\nhis modest fortitude and his great sorrow.\n\nAs to Mrs. Gummidge, if I were to endeavour to describe how she ran down\nthe street by the side of the coach, seeing nothing but Mr. Peggotty on\nthe roof, through the tears she tried to repress, and dashing herself\nagainst the people who were coming in the opposite direction, I should\nenter on a task of some difficulty. Therefore I had better leave her\nsitting on a baker's door-step, out of breath, with no shape at all\nremaining in her bonnet, and one of her shoes off, lying on the pavement\nat a considerable distance.\n\nWhen we got to our journey's end, our first pursuit was to look about\nfor a little lodging for Peggotty, where her brother could have a\nbed. We were so fortunate as to find one, of a very clean and cheap\ndescription, over a chandler's shop, only two streets removed from\nme. When we had engaged this domicile, I bought some cold meat at an\neating-house, and took my fellow-travellers home to tea; a proceeding,\nI regret to state, which did not meet with Mrs. Crupp's approval, but\nquite the contrary. I ought to observe, however, in explanation of that\nlady's state of mind, that she was much offended by Peggotty's tucking\nup her widow's gown before she had been ten minutes in the place, and\nsetting to work to dust my bed-room. This Mrs. Crupp regarded in the\nlight of a liberty, and a liberty, she said, was a thing she never\nallowed.\n\nMr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London, for\nwhich I was not unprepared. It was, that he purposed first seeing Mrs.\nSteerforth. As I felt bound to assist him in this, and also to mediate\nbetween them; with the view of sparing the mother's feelings as much as\npossible, I wrote to her that night. I told her as mildly as I could\nwhat his wrong was, and what my own share in his injury. I said he was a\nman in very common life, but of a most gentle and upright character; and\nthat I ventured to express a hope that she would not refuse to see him\nin his heavy trouble. I mentioned two o'clock in the afternoon as the\nhour of our coming, and I sent the letter myself by the first coach in\nthe morning.\n\nAt the appointed time, we stood at the door--the door of that house\nwhere I had been, a few days since, so happy: where my youthful\nconfidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely: which was\nclosed against me henceforth: which was now a waste, a ruin.\n\nNo Littimer appeared. The pleasanter face which had replaced his, on the\noccasion of my last visit, answered to our summons, and went before us\nto the drawing-room. Mrs. Steerforth was sitting there. Rosa Dartle\nglided, as we went in, from another part of the room, and stood behind\nher chair.\n\n  [Illustration: Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Steerforth.]\n\nI saw, directly, in his mother's face, that she knew from himself what\nhe had done. It was very pale; and bore the traces of deeper emotion\nthan my letter alone, weakened by the doubts her fondness would have\nraised upon it, would have been likely to create. I thought her more\nlike him than ever I had thought her; and I felt, rather than saw, that\nthe resemblance was not lost on my companion.\n\nShe sat upright in her arm-chair, with a stately, immoveable,\npassionless air, that it seemed as if nothing could disturb. She looked\nvery stedfastly at Mr. Peggotty when he stood before her; and he looked,\nquite as stedfastly, at her. Rosa Dartle's keen glance comprehended all\nof us. For some moments not a word was spoken.\n\nShe motioned to Mr. Peggotty to be seated. He said, in a low voice, \"I\nshouldn't feel it nat'ral, ma'am, to sit down in this house. I'd sooner\nstand.\" And this was succeeded by another silence, which she broke thus:\n\n\"I know, with deep regret, what has brought you here. What do you want\nof me? What do you ask me to do?\"\n\nHe put his hat under his arm, and feeling in his breast for Emily's\nletter, took it out, unfolded it, and gave it to her.\n\n\"Please to read that, ma'am. That's my niece's hand!\"\n\nShe read it, in the same stately and impassive way,--untouched by its\ncontents, as far as I could see,--and returned it to him.\n\n\"'Unless he brings me back a lady,'\" said Mr. Peggotty, tracing out that\npart with his finger. \"I come to know, ma'am, whether he will keep his\nwured?\"\n\n\"No,\" she returned.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"It is impossible. He would disgrace himself. You cannot fail to know\nthat she is far below him.\"\n\n\"Raise her up!\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"She is uneducated and ignorant.\"\n\n\"Maybe she's not; maybe she is,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"_I_ think not,\nma'am; but I'm no judge of them things. Teach her better!\"\n\n\"Since you oblige me to speak more plainly, which I am very unwilling to\ndo, her humble connexions would render such a thing impossible, if\nnothing else did.\"\n\n\"Hark to this, ma'am,\" he returned, slowly and quietly. \"You know what\nit is to love your child. So do I. If she was a hundred times my child,\nI couldn't love her more. You doen't know what it is to lose your child.\nI do. All the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me (if they\nwas mine) to buy her back! But, save her from this disgrace, and she\nshall never be disgraced by us. Not one of us that she's growed up\namong, not one of us that's lived along with her, and had her for their\nall in all, these many year, will ever look upon her pritty face again.\nWe'll be content to let her be; we'll be content to think of her, far\noff, as if she was underneath another sun and sky; we'll be content to\ntrust her to her husband,--to her little children p'raps,--and bide the\ntime when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our God!\"\n\nThe rugged eloquence with which he spoke, was not devoid of all effect.\nShe still preserved her proud manner, but there was a touch of softness\nin her voice, as she answered:\n\n\"I justify nothing. I make no counter-accusations. But I am sorry to\nrepeat, it is impossible. Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my\nson's career, and ruin his prospects. Nothing is more certain than that\nit never can take place, and never will. If there is any other\ncompensation--\"\n\n\"I am looking at the likeness of the face,\" interrupted Mr. Peggotty,\nwith a steady but a kindling eye, \"that has looked at me, in my home, at\nmy fireside, in my boat--wheer not?--smiling and friendly, when it was\nso treacherous, that I go half wild when I think of it. If the likeness\nof that face don't turn to burning fire, at the thought of offering\nmoney to me for my child's blight and ruin, it's as bad. I doen't know,\nbeing a lady's, but what it's worse.\"\n\nShe changed now, in a moment. An angry flush overspread her features;\nand she said, in an intolerant manner, grasping the arm-chair tightly\nwith her hands:\n\n\"What compensation can you make to _me_ for opening such a pit between\nme and my son? What is your love to mine? What is your separation to\nours?\"\n\nMiss Dartle softly touched her, and bent down her head to whisper, but\nshe would not hear a word.\n\n\"No, Rosa, not a word! Let the man listen to what I say! My son, who has\nbeen the object of my life, to whom its every thought has been devoted,\nwhom I have gratified from a child in every wish, from whom I have had\nno separate existence since his birth,--to take up in a moment with a\nmiserable girl, and avoid me! To repay my confidence with systematic\ndeception, for her sake, and quit me for her! To set this wretched\nfancy, against his mother's claims upon his duty, love, respect,\ngratitude--claims that every day and hour of his life should have\nstrengthened into ties that nothing could be proof against! Is this no\ninjury?\"\n\nAgain Rosa Dartle tried to soothe her; again ineffectually.\n\n\"I say, Rosa, not a word! If he can stake his all upon the lightest\nobject, I can stake my all upon a greater purpose. Let him go where he\nwill, with the means that my love has secured to him! Does he think to\nreduce me by long absence? He knows his mother very little if he does.\nLet him put away his whim now, and he is welcome back. Let him not put\nher away now, and he never shall come near me, living or dying, while I\ncan raise my hand to make a sign against it, unless, being rid of her\nfor ever, he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness. This is my\nright. This is the acknowledgment I _will have_. This is the separation\nthat there is between us! And is this,\" she added, looking at her\nvisitor with the proud intolerant air with which she had begun, \"no\ninjury?\"\n\nWhile I heard and saw the mother as she said these words, I seemed to\nhear and see the son, defying them. All that I had ever seen in him of\nan unyielding, wilful spirit, I saw in her. All the understanding that I\nhad now of his misdirected energy, became an understanding of her\ncharacter too, and a perception that it was, in its strongest springs,\nthe same.\n\nShe now observed to me, aloud, resuming her former restraint, that it\nwas useless to hear more, or to say more, and that she begged to put an\nend to the interview. She rose with an air of dignity to leave the room,\nwhen Mr. Peggotty signified that it was needless.\n\n\"Doen't fear me being any hindrance to you, I have no more to say,\nma'am,\" he remarked, as he moved towards the door. \"I come heer with no\nhope, and I take away no hope. I have done what I thowt should be done,\nbut I never looked fur any good to come of my stan'ning where I do. This\nhas been too evil a house fur me and mine, fur me to be in my right\nsenses and expect it.\"\n\nWith this, we departed; leaving her standing by her elbow chair, a\npicture of a noble presence and a handsome face.\n\nWe had, on our way out, to cross a paved hall, with glass sides and\nroof, over which a vine was trained. Its leaves and shoots were green\nthen, and the day being sunny, a pair of glass doors leading to the\ngarden were thrown open. Rosa Dartle, entering this way with a noiseless\nstep, when we were close to them, addressed herself to me:\n\n\"You do well,\" she said, \"indeed, to bring this fellow here!\"\n\nSuch a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face, and flashed\nin her jet-black eyes, I could not have thought compressible even into\nthat face. The scar made by the hammer was, as usual in this excited\nstate of her features, strongly marked. When the throbbing I had seen\nbefore, came into it as I looked at her, she absolutely lifted up her\nhand, and struck it.\n\n\"This is a fellow,\" she said, \"to champion and bring here, is he not?\nYou are a true man!\"\n\n\"Miss Dartle,\" I returned, \"you are surely not so unjust as to condemn\n_me_!\"\n\n\"Why do you bring division between these two mad creatures?\" she\nreturned. \"Don't you know that they are both mad with their own\nself-will and pride?\"\n\n\"Is it my doing?\" I returned.\n\n\"Is it your doing!\" she retorted. \"Why do you bring this man here?\"\n\n\"He is a deeply-injured man, Miss Dartle,\" I replied. \"You may not know\nit.\"\n\n\"I know that James Steerforth,\" she said, with her hand on her bosom, as\nif to prevent the storm that was raging there, from being loud, \"has a\nfalse, corrupt heart, and is a traitor. But what need I know or care\nabout this fellow, and his common niece?\"\n\n\"Miss Dartle,\" I returned, \"you deepen the injury. It is sufficient\nalready. I will only say, at parting, that you do him a great wrong.\"\n\n\"I do him no wrong,\" she returned. \"They are a depraved worthless set. I\nwould have her whipped!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty passed on, without a word, and went out at the door.\n\n\"Oh, shame, Miss Dartle! shame!\" I said indignantly. \"How can you bear\nto trample on his undeserved affliction!\"\n\n\"I would trample on them all,\" she answered. \"I would have his house\npulled down. I would have her branded on the face, drest in rags, and\ncast out in the streets to starve. If I had the power to sit in judgment\non her, I would see it done. See it done? I would do it! I detest her.\nIf I ever could reproach her with her infamous condition, I would go\nanywhere to do so. If I could hunt her to her grave, I would. If there\nwas any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour,\nand only I possessed it, I wouldn't part with it for Life itself.\"\n\nThe mere vehemence of her words can convey, I am sensible, but a weak\nimpression of the passion by which she was possessed, and which made\nitself articulate in her whole figure, though her voice, instead of\nbeing raised, was lower than usual. No description I could give of her\nwould do justice to my recollection of her, or to her entire deliverance\nof herself to her anger. I have seen passion in many forms, but I have\nnever seen it in such a form as that.\n\nWhen I joined Mr. Peggotty, he was walking slowly and thoughtfully down\nthe hill. He told me, as soon as I came up with him, that having now\ndischarged his mind of what he had purposed doing in London, he meant\n\"to set out on his travels,\" that night. I asked him where he meant to\ngo? He only answered, \"I'm a going, sir, to seek my niece.\"\n\nWe went back to the little lodging over the chandler's shop, and there I\nfound an opportunity of repeating to Peggotty what he had said to me.\nShe informed me, in return, that he had said the same to her that\nmorning. She knew no more than I did, where he was going, but she\nthought he had some project shaped out in his mind.\n\nI did not like to leave him, under such circumstances, and we all three\ndined together off a beefsteak pie--which was one of the many good\nthings for which Peggotty was famous--and which was curiously flavoured\non this occasion, I recollect well, by a miscellaneous taste of tea,\ncoffee, butter, bacon, cheese, new loaves, firewood, candles, and walnut\nketchup, continually ascending from the shop. After dinner we sat for an\nhour or so near the window, without talking much; and then Mr. Peggotty\ngot up, and brought his oilskin bag and his stout stick, and laid them\non the table.\n\nHe accepted, from his sister's stock of ready money, a small sum on\naccount of his legacy; barely enough, I should have thought, to keep him\nfor a month. He promised to communicate with me, when anything befel\nhim; and he slung his bag about him, took his hat and stick, and bade us\nboth \"Good bye!\"\n\n\"All good attend you, dear old woman,\" he said, embracing Peggotty, \"and\nyou too, Mas'r Davy!\" shaking hands with me. \"I'm a going to seek her,\nfur and wide. If she should come home while I'm away,--but ah, that\nain't like to be!--or if I should bring her back, my meaning is, that\nshe and me shall live and die where no one can't reproach her. If any\nhurt should come to me, remember that the last words I left for her was,\n'My unchanged love is with my darling child, and I forgive her!'\"\n\nHe said this solemnly, bare-headed; then, putting on his hat, he went\ndown the stairs, and away. We followed to the door. It was a warm, dusty\nevening, just the time when, in the great main thoroughfare out of which\nthat bye-way turned, there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread of\nfeet upon the pavement, and a strong red sunshine. He turned, alone, at\nthe corner of our shady street, into a glow of light, in which we lost\nhim.\n\nRarely did that hour of the evening come, rarely did I wake at night,\nrarely did I look up at the moon, or stars, or watch the falling rain,\nor hear the wind, but I thought of his solitary figure toiling on, poor\npilgrim, and recalled the words:\n\n\"I'm a going to seek her, fur and wide. If any hurt should come to me,\nremember that the last words I left for her was, 'My unchanged love is\nwith my darling child, and I forgive her!'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nBLISSFUL.\n\n\nAll this time, I had gone on loving Dora, harder than ever. Her idea was\nmy refuge in disappointment and distress, and made some amends to me,\neven for the loss of my friend. The more I pitied myself, or pitied\nothers, the more I sought for consolation in the image of Dora. The\ngreater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world, the\nbrighter and the purer shone the star of Dora high above the world. I\ndon't think I had any definite idea where Dora came from, or in what\ndegree she was related to a higher order of beings; but I am quite sure\nI should have scouted the notion of her being simply human, like any\nother young lady, with indignation and contempt.\n\nIf I may so express it, I was steeped in Dora. I was not merely over\nhead and ears in love with her, but I was saturated through and through.\nEnough love might have been wrung out of me, metaphorically speaking, to\ndrown anybody in; and yet there would have remained enough within me,\nand all over me, to pervade my entire existence.\n\nThe first thing I did, on my own account, when I came back, was to take\na night-walk to Norwood, and, like the subject of a venerable riddle of\nmy childhood to go \"round and round the house, without ever touching the\nhouse,\" thinking about Dora. I believe the theme of this\nincomprehensible conundrum was the moon. No matter what it was, I, the\nmoon-struck slave of Dora, perambulated round and round the house and\ngarden for two hours, looking through crevices in the palings, getting\nmy chin by dint of violent exertion above the rusty nails on the top,\nblowing kisses at the lights in the windows, and romantically calling on\nthe night, at intervals, to shield my Dora--I don't exactly know what\nfrom, I suppose from fire. Perhaps from mice, to which she had a great\nobjection.\n\nMy love was so much on my mind, and it was so natural to me to confide\nin Peggotty, when I found her again by my side of an evening with the\nold set of industrial implements, busily making the tour of my wardrobe,\nthat I imparted to her, in a sufficiently roundabout way, my great\nsecret. Peggotty was strongly interested, but I could not get her into\nmy view of the case at all. She was audaciously prejudiced in my favour,\nand quite unable to understand why I should have any misgivings, or be\nlow-spirited about it. 'The young lady might think herself well off,'\nshe observed, 'to have such a beau. And as to her Pa,' she said, 'what\n_did_ the gentleman expect, for gracious sake!'\n\nI observed, however, that Mr. Spenlow's Proctorial gown and stiff cravat\ntook Peggotty down a little, and inspired her with a greater reverence\nfor the man who was gradually becoming more and more etherealized in my\neyes every day, and about whom a reflected radiance seemed to me to beam\nwhen he sat erect in Court among his papers, like a little light-house\nin a sea of stationery. And by-the-by, it used to be uncommonly strange\nto me to consider, I remember, as I sat in Court too, how those dim old\njudges and doctors wouldn't have cared for Dora, if they had known her;\nhow they wouldn't have gone out of their senses with rapture, if\nmarriage with Dora had been proposed to them; how Dora might have sung,\nand played upon that glorified guitar, until she led _me_ to the verge\nof madness, yet not have tempted one of those slow-goers an inch out of\nhis road!\n\nI despised them, to a man. Frozen-out old gardeners in the flower-beds\nof the heart, I took a personal offence against them all. The Bench was\nnothing to me but an insensible blunderer. The Bar had no more\ntenderness or poetry in it, than the Bar of a public-house.\n\nTaking the management of Peggotty's affairs into my own hands, with no\nlittle pride, I proved the will, and came to a settlement with the\nLegacy Duty-office, and took her to the Bank, and soon got everything\ninto an orderly train. We varied the legal character of these\nproceedings by going to see some perspiring Wax-work, in Fleet Street\n(melted, I should hope, these twenty years); and by visiting Miss\nLinwood's Exhibition, which I remember as a Mausoleum of needlework,\nfavorable to self-examination and repentance; and by inspecting the\nTower of London; and going to the top of St. Paul's. All these wonders\nafforded Peggotty as much pleasure as she was able to enjoy, under\nexisting circumstances: except, I think, St. Paul's, which, from her\nlong attachment to her workbox, became a rival of the picture on the\nlid, and was, in some particulars, vanquished, she considered, by that\nwork of art.\n\nPeggotty's business, which was what we used to call \"common form\nbusiness\" in the Commons (and very light and lucrative the common-form\nbusiness was), being settled, I took her down to the office one morning\nto pay her bill. Mr. Spenlow had stepped out, old Tiffey said, to get\na gentleman sworn for a marriage license; but as I knew he would be\nback directly, our place lying close to the Surrogate's, and to the\nVicar-General's office too, I told Peggotty to wait.\n\nWe were a little like undertakers, in the Commons, as regarded Probate\ntransactions; generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up,\nwhen we had to deal with clients in mourning. In a similar feeling of\ndelicacy, we were always blithe and light-hearted with the license\nclients. Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find Mr. Spenlow\nmuch recovered from the shock of Mr. Barkis's decease; and indeed he\ncame in like a bridegroom.\n\nBut neither Peggotty nor I had eyes for him, when we saw, in company\nwith him, Mr. Murdstone. He was very little changed. His hair looked as\nthick, and was certainly as black, as ever; and his glance was as little\nto be trusted as of old.\n\n\"Ah, Copperfield?\" said Mr. Spenlow. \"You know this gentleman, I\nbelieve?\"\n\nI made my gentleman a distant bow, and Peggotty barely recognised him.\nHe was, at first, somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together; but\nquickly decided what to do, and came up to me.\n\n\"I hope,\" he said, \"that you are doing well?\"\n\n\"It can hardly be interesting to you,\" said I. \"Yes, if you wish to\nknow.\"\n\nWe looked at each other, and he addressed himself to Peggotty.\n\n\"And you,\" said he. \"I am sorry to observe that you have lost your\nhusband.\"\n\n\"It's not the first loss I have had in my life, Mr. Murdstone,\" replied\nPeggotty, trembling from head to foot. \"I am glad to hope that there is\nnobody to blame for this one,--nobody to answer for it.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said he; \"that's a comfortable reflection. You have done your\nduty?\"\n\n\"I have not worn any body's life away,\" said Peggotty, \"I am thankful to\nthink! No, Mr. Murdstone, I have not worrited and frightened any sweet\ncreetur to an early grave!\"\n\nHe eyed her gloomily--remorsefully I thought--for an instant; and said,\nturning his head towards me, but looking at my feet instead of my face:\n\n\"We are not likely to encounter soon again;--a source of satisfaction to\nus both, no doubt, for such meetings as this can never be agreeable. I\ndo not expect that you, who always rebelled against my just authority,\nexerted for your benefit and reformation, should owe me any good will\nnow. There is an antipathy between us----\"\n\n\"An old one, I believe?\" said I, interrupting him.\n\nHe smiled, and shot as evil a glance at me as could come from his dark\neyes.\n\n\"It rankled in your baby breast,\" he said. \"It embittered the life of\nyour poor mother. You are right. I hope you may do better, yet; I hope\nyou may correct yourself.\"\n\nHere he ended the dialogue, which had been carried on in a low voice, in\na corner of the outer office, by passing into Mr. Spenlow's room, and\nsaying aloud, in his smoothest manner:\n\n\"Gentlemen of Mr. Spenlow's profession are accustomed to family\ndifferences, and know how complicated and difficult they always are!\"\nWith that, he paid the money for his license; and, receiving it neatly\nfolded from Mr. Spenlow, together with a shake of the hand, and a polite\nwish for his happiness and the lady's, went out of the office.\n\nI might have had more difficulty in constraining myself to be silent\nunder his words, if I had had less difficulty in impressing upon\nPeggotty (who was only angry on my account, good creature!) that we were\nnot in a place for recrimination, and that I besought her to hold her\npeace. She was so unusually roused, that I was glad to compound for an\naffectionate hug, elicited by this revival in her mind of our old\ninjuries, and to make the best I could of it, before Mr. Spenlow and the\nclerks.\n\nMr. Spenlow did not appear to know what the connexion between Mr.\nMurdstone and myself was; which I was glad of, for I could not bear to\nacknowledge him, even in my own breast, remembering what I did of the\nhistory of my poor mother. Mr. Spenlow seemed to think, if he thought\nanything about the matter, that my aunt was the leader of the state\nparty in our family, and that there was a rebel party commanded by\nsomebody else--so I gathered at least from what he said, while we were\nwaiting for Mr. Tiffey to make out Peggotty's bill of costs.\n\n\"Miss Trotwood,\" he remarked, \"is very firm, no doubt, and not likely to\ngive way to opposition. I have an admiration for her character, and I\nmay congratulate you, Copperfield, on being on the right side.\nDifferences between relations are much to be deplored--but they are\nextremely general--and the great thing is, to be on the right side:\"\nmeaning, I take it, on the side of the moneyed interest.\n\n\"Rather a good marriage this, I believe?\" said Mr. Spenlow.\n\nI explained that I knew nothing about it.\n\n\"Indeed!\" he said. \"Speaking from the few words Mr. Murdstone\ndropped--as a man frequently does on these occasions--and from what\nMiss Murdstone let fall, I should say it was rather a good marriage.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that there is money, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Spenlow, \"I understand there's money. Beauty too, I am\ntold.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Is his new wife young?\"\n\n\"Just of age,\" said Mr. Spenlow. \"So lately, that I should think they\nhad been waiting for that.\"\n\n\"Lord deliver her!\" said Peggotty. So very emphatically and\nunexpectedly, that we were all three discomposed; until Tiffey came in\nwith the bill.\n\nOld Tiffey soon appeared, however, and handed it to Mr. Spenlow, to look\nover. Mr. Spenlow, settling his chin in his cravat and rubbing it\nsoftly, went over the items with a deprecatory air--as if it were all\nJorkins's doing--and handed it back to Tiffey with a bland sigh.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That's right. Quite right. I should have been extremely\nhappy, Copperfield, to have limited these charges to the actual\nexpenditure out of pocket; but it is an irksome incident in my\nprofessional life, that I am not at liberty to consult my own wishes. I\nhave a partner--Mr. Jorkins.\"\n\nAs he said this with a gentle melancholy, which was the next thing to\nmaking no charge at all, I expressed my acknowledgments on Peggotty's\nbehalf, and paid Tiffey in bank notes. Peggotty then retired to\nher lodging, and Mr. Spenlow and I went into Court, where we had a\ndivorce-suit coming on, under an ingenious little statute (repealed\nnow, I believe, but in virtue of which I have seen several marriages\nannulled), of which the merits were these. The husband, whose name\nwas Thomas Benjamin, had taken out his marriage license as Thomas\nonly; suppressing the Benjamin, in case he should not find himself as\ncomfortable as he expected. _Not_ finding himself as comfortable as he\nexpected, or being a little fatigued with his wife, poor fellow, he\nnow came forward by a friend, after being married a year or two, and\ndeclared that his name was Thomas Benjamin, and therefore he was not\nmarried at all. Which the Court confirmed, to his great satisfaction.\n\nI must say that I had my doubts about the strict justice of this, and\nwas not even frightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which\nreconciles all anomalies. But Mr. Spenlow argued the matter with me. He\nsaid, Look at the world, there was good and evil in that; look at the\necclesiastical law, there was good and evil in _that_. It was all part\nof a system. Very good. There you were!\n\nI had not the hardihood to suggest to Dora's father that possibly we\nmight even improve the world a little, if we got up early in the\nmorning, and took off our coats to the work; but I confessed that I\nthought we might improve the Commons. Mr. Spenlow replied that he would\nparticularly advise me to dismiss that idea from my mind, as not being\nworthy of my gentlemanly character; but that he would be glad to hear\nfrom me of what improvement I thought the Commons susceptible?\n\nTaking that part of the Commons which happened to be nearest to us--for\nour man was unmarried by this time, and we were out of Court, and\nstrolling past the Prerogative Office--I submitted that I thought the\nPrerogative Office rather a queerly managed institution. Mr. Spenlow\ninquired in what respect? I replied, with all due deference to his\nexperience (but with more deference, I am afraid, to his being Dora's\nfather), that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of\nthat Court, containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects\nwithin the immense province of Canterbury, for three whole centuries,\nshould be an accidental building, never designed for the purpose, leased\nby the registrars for their own private emolument, unsafe, not even\nascertained to be fire-proof, choked with the important documents it\nheld, and positively, from the roof to the basement, a mercenary\nspeculation of the registrars, who took great fees from the public, and\ncrammed the public's wills away anyhow and anywhere, having no other\nobject than to get rid of them cheaply. That, perhaps, it was a little\nunreasonable that these registrars in the receipt of profits amounting\nto eight or nine thousand pounds a year (to say nothing of the profits\nof the deputy registrars, and clerks of seats), should not be obliged to\nspend a little of that money, in finding a reasonably safe place for the\nimportant documents which all classes of people were compelled to hand\nover to them, whether they would or no. That, perhaps, it was a little\nunjust that all the great offices in this great office, should be\nmagnificent sinecures, while the unfortunate working-clerks in the cold\ndark room up-stairs were the worst rewarded, and the least considered\nmen, doing important services, in London. That perhaps it was a little\nindecent that the principal registrar of all, whose duty it was to find\nthe public, constantly resorting to this place, all needful\naccommodation, should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post\n(and might be, besides, a clergyman, a pluralist, the holder of a stall\nin a cathedral, and what not),--while the public was put to the\ninconvenience of which we had a specimen every afternoon when the office\nwas busy, and which we knew to be quite monstrous. That, perhaps, in\nshort, this Prerogative Office of the diocese of Canterbury was\naltogether such a pestilent job, and such a pernicious absurdity, that\nbut for its being squeezed away, in a corner of Saint Paul's Churchyard,\nwhich few people knew, it must have been turned completely inside out,\nand upside down, long ago.\n\nMr. Spenlow smiled as I became modestly warm on the subject, and then\nargued this question with me as he had argued the other. He said, what\nwas it after all? It was a question of feeling. If the public felt that\ntheir wills were in safe keeping, and took it for granted that the\noffice was not to be made better, who was the worse for it? Nobody? Who\nwas the better for it? All the Sinecurists. Very well. Then the good\npredominated. It might not be a perfect system; nothing _was_ perfect;\nbut what he objected to, was, the insertion of the wedge. Under the\nPrerogative Office, the country had been glorious. Insert the wedge into\nthe Prerogative Office, and the country would cease to be glorious. He\nconsidered it the principle of a gentleman to take things as he found\nthem; and he had no doubt the Prerogative Office would last our time. I\ndeferred to his opinion, though I had great doubts of it myself. I find\nhe was right, however; for it has not only lasted to the present moment,\nbut has done so in the teeth of a great parliamentary report made (not\ntoo willingly) eighteen years ago, when all these objections of mine\nwere set forth in detail, and when the existing stowage for wills was\ndescribed as equal to the accumulation of only two years and a half\nmore. What they have done with them since; whether they have lost many,\nor whether they sell any, now and then, to the butter shops; I don't\nknow. I am glad mine is not there, and I hope it may not go there, yet\nawhile.\n\nI have set all this down, in my present blissful chapter, because here\nit comes into its natural place. Mr. Spenlow and I falling into this\nconversation, prolonged it and our saunter to and fro, until we diverged\ninto general topics. And so it came about, in the end, that Mr. Spenlow\ntold me this day week was Dora's birthday, and he would be glad if I\nwould come down and join a little pic-nic on the occasion. I went out of\nmy senses immediately; became a mere driveller next day, on receipt of a\nlittle lace-edged sheet of note paper, \"Favoured by papa. To remind;\"\nand passed the intervening period in a state of dotage.\n\nI think I committed every possible absurdity, in the way of preparation\nfor this blessed event. I turn hot when I remember the cravat I bought.\nMy boots might be placed in any collection of instruments of torture. I\nprovided, and sent down by the Norwood coach the night before, a\ndelicate little hamper, amounting in itself, I thought, almost to a\ndeclaration. There were crackers in it with the tenderest mottos that\ncould be got for money. At six in the morning, I was in Covent Garden\nMarket, buying a bouquet for Dora. At ten I was on horseback (I hired a\ngallant grey, for the occasion), with the bouquet in my hat, to keep it\nfresh, trotting down to Norwood.\n\nI suppose that when I saw Dora in the garden and pretended not to see\nher, and rode past the house pretending to be anxiously looking for it,\nI committed two small fooleries which other young gentlemen in my\ncircumstances might have committed--because they came so very natural to\nme. But oh! when I _did_ find the house, and _did_ dismount at the\ngarden gate, and drag those stoney-hearted boots across the lawn to Dora\nsitting on a garden seat under a lilac tree, what a spectacle she was,\nupon that beautiful morning, among the butterflies, in a white chip\nbonnet and a dress of celestial blue!\n\nThere was a young lady with her--comparatively stricken in years--almost\ntwenty, I should say. Her name was Miss Mills, and Dora called her\nJulia. She was the bosom friend of Dora. Happy Miss Mills!\n\nJip was there, and Jip _would_ bark at me again. When I presented my\nbouquet, he gnashed his teeth with jealousy. Well he might. If he had\nthe least idea how I adored his mistress, well he might!\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Mr. Copperfield! What dear flowers!\" said Dora.\n\nI had had an intention of saying (and had been studying the best form of\nwords for three miles) that I thought them beautiful before I saw them\nso near _her_. But I couldn't manage it. She was too bewildering. To see\nher lay the flowers against her little dimpled chin, was to lose all\npresence of mind and power of language in a feeble ecstacy. I wonder I\ndidn't say, \"Kill me, if you have a heart, Miss Mills. Let me die here!\"\n\nThen Dora held my flowers to Jip to smell. Then Jip growled, and\nwouldn't smell them. Then Dora laughed, and held them a little closer to\nJip, to make him. Then Jip laid hold of a bit of geranium with his\nteeth, and worried imaginary cats in it. Then Dora beat him, and pouted,\nand said, \"My poor beautiful flowers!\" as compassionately, I thought, as\nif Jip had laid hold of me. I wished he had!\n\n\"You'll be so glad to hear, Mr. Copperfield,\" said Dora, \"that that\ncross Miss Murdstone is not here. She has gone to her brother's\nmarriage, and will be away at least three weeks. Isn't that delightful?\"\n\nI said I was sure it must be delightful to her, and all that was\ndelightful to her was delightful to me. Miss Mills, with an air of\nsuperior wisdom and benevolence, smiled upon us.\n\n\"She is the most disagreeable thing I ever saw,\" said Dora. \"You can't\nbelieve how ill-tempered and shocking she is, Julia.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can, my dear!\" said Julia.\n\n\"_You_ can, perhaps, love,\" returned Dora, with her hand on Julia's.\n\"Forgive my not excepting you, my dear, at first.\"\n\nI learnt, from this, that Miss Mills had had her trials in the course of\na chequered existence; and that to these, perhaps, I might refer that\nwise benignity of manner which I had already noticed. I found, in the\ncourse of the day, that this was the case: Miss Mills having been\nunhappy in a misplaced affection, and being understood to have retired\nfrom the world on her awful stock of experience, but still to take a\ncalm interest in the unblighted hopes and loves of youth.\n\nBut now Mr. Spenlow came out of the house, and Dora went to him, saying,\n\"Look, papa, what beautiful flowers!\" And Miss Mills smiled\nthoughtfully, as who should say, \"Ye May-flies, enjoy your brief\nexistence in the bright morning of life!\" And we all walked from the\nlawn towards the carriage, which was getting ready.\n\nI shall never have such a ride again. I have never had such another.\nThere were only those three, their hamper, my hamper, and the\nguitar-case, in the phaeton; and, of course, the phaeton was open; and\nI rode behind it, and Dora sat with her back to the horses, looking\ntowards me. She kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion, and\nwouldn't allow Jip to sit on that side of her at all, for fear he\nshould crush it. She often carried it in her hand, often refreshed\nherself with its fragrance. Our eyes at those times often met; and my\ngreat astonishment is that I didn't go over the head of my gallant grey\ninto the carriage.\n\nThere was dust, I believe. There was a good deal of dust, I believe. I\nhave a faint impression that Mr. Spenlow remonstrated with me for riding\nin it; but I knew of none. I was sensible of a mist of love and beauty\nabout Dora, but of nothing else. He stood up sometimes, and asked me\nwhat I thought of the prospect. I said it was delightful, and I daresay\nit was; but it was all Dora to me. The sun shone Dora, and the birds\nsang Dora. The south wind blew Dora, and the wild flowers in the hedges\nwere all Doras, to a bud. My comfort is, Miss Mills understood me. Miss\nMills alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly.\n\nI don't know how long we were going, and to this hour I know as little\nwhere we went. Perhaps it was near Guildford. Perhaps some Arabian-night\nmagician, opened up the place for the day, and shut it for ever when we\ncame away. It was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with soft turf.\nThere were shady trees, and heather, and, as far as the eye could see, a\nrich landscape.\n\nIt was a trying thing to find people here, waiting for us; and my\njealousy, even of the ladies, knew no bounds. But all of my own\nsex--especially one impostor, three or four years my elder, with a\nred whisker, on which he established an amount of presumption not be\nendured--were my mortal foes.\n\nWe all unpacked our baskets, and employed ourselves in getting dinner\nready. Red Whisker pretended he could make a salad (which I don't\nbelieve), and obtruded himself on public notice. Some of the young\nladies washed the lettuces for him, and sliced them under his\ndirections. Dora was among these. I felt that fate had pitted me against\nthis man, and one of us must fall.\n\nRed Whisker made his salad (I wondered how they could eat it. Nothing\nshould have induced _me_ to touch it!) and voted himself into the charge\nof the wine-cellar, which he constructed, being an ingenious beast, in\nthe hollow trunk of a tree. By-and-by I saw him, with the majority of a\nlobster on his plate, eating his dinner at the feet of Dora!\n\nI have but an indistinct idea of what happened for some time after this\nbaleful object presented itself to my view. I was very merry, I know;\nbut it was hollow merriment. I attached myself to a young creature in\npink, with little eyes, and flirted with her desperately. She received\nmy attentions with favour; but whether on my account solely, or because\nshe had any designs on Red Whisker, I can't say. Dora's health was\ndrunk. When I drank it, I affected to interrupt my conversation for that\npurpose, and to resume it immediately afterwards. I caught Dora's eye as\nI bowed to her, and I thought it looked appealing. But it looked at me\nover the head of Red Whisker, and I was adamant.\n\nThe young creature in pink had a mother in green; and I rather think the\nlatter separated us from motives of policy. Howbeit, there was a general\nbreaking up of the party, while the remnants of the dinner were being\nput away; and I strolled off by myself among the trees, in a raging and\nremorseful state. I was debating whether I should pretend that I was not\nwell, and fly--I don't know where--upon my gallant grey, when Dora and\nMiss Mills met me.\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" said Miss Mills, \"you are dull.\"\n\nI begged her pardon. Not at all.\n\n\"And, Dora,\" said Miss Mills, \"_you_ are dull.\"\n\nOh dear no! Not in the least.\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield and Dora,\" said Miss Mills, with an almost venerable\nair. \"Enough of this. Do not allow a trivial misunderstanding to wither\nthe blossoms of spring, which, once put forth and blighted, can not be\nrenewed. I speak,\" said Miss Mills, \"from experience of the past--the\nremote irrevocable past. The gushing fountains which sparkle in the sun,\nmust not be stopped in mere caprice; the oasis in the desert of Sahara,\nmust not be plucked up idly.\"\n\nI hardly knew what I did, I was burning all over to that extraordinary\nextent; but I took Dora's little hand and kissed it--and she let me! I\nkissed Miss Mills's hand; and we all seemed, to my thinking, to go\nstraight up to the seventh heaven.\n\nWe did not come down again. We stayed up there all the evening. At first\nwe strayed to and fro among the trees: I with Dora's shy arm drawn\nthrough mine: and Heaven knows, folly as it all was, it would have been\na happy fate to have been struck immortal with those foolish feelings,\nand have strayed among the trees for ever!\n\nBut, much too soon, we heard the others laughing and talking, and\ncalling \"where's Dora!\" So we went back, and they wanted Dora to sing.\nRed Whisker would have got the guitar-case out of the carriage, but Dora\ntold him nobody knew where it was, but I. So Red Whisker was done for in\na moment; and _I_ got it, and _I_ unlocked it, and _I_ took the guitar\nout, and _I_ sat by her, and _I_ held her handkerchief and gloves, and\n_I_ drank in every note of her dear voice, and she sang to _me_ who\nloved her, and all the others might applaud as much as they liked, but\nthey had nothing to do with it!\n\nI was intoxicated with joy. I was afraid it was too happy to be real,\nand that I should wake in Buckingham Street presently, and hear Mrs.\nCrupp clinking the teacups in getting breakfast ready. But Dora sang,\nand others sang, and Miss Mills sang--about the slumbering echoes in the\ncaverns of Memory; as if she were a hundred years old--and the evening\ncame on; and we had tea, with a kettle boiling gipsy-fashion; and I was\nstill as happy as ever.\n\nI was happier than ever when the party broke up, and the other people,\ndefeated Red Whisker and all, went their several ways, and we went\nours through the still evening and the dying light, with sweet scents\nrising up around us. Mr. Spenlow being a little drowsy after the\nchampagne--honour to the soil that grew the grape, to the grape that\nmade the wine, to the sun that ripened it, and to the merchant who\nadulterated it!--and being fast asleep in a corner of the carriage, I\nrode by the side, and talked to Dora. She admired my horse and patted\nhim--oh, what a dear little hand it looked upon a horse!--and her shawl\nwould not keep right, and now and then I drew it round her with my arm;\nand I even fancied that Jip began to see how it was, and to understand\nthat he must make up his mind to be friends with me.\n\nThat sagacious Miss Mills, too; that amiable, though quite used up,\nrecluse; that little patriarch of something less than twenty, who had\ndone with the world, and mustn't on any account have the slumbering\nechoes in the caverns of Memory awakened; what a kind thing she did!\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" said Miss Mills, \"come to this side of the carriage a\nmoment--if you can spare a moment. I want to speak to you.\"\n\nBehold me, on my gallant grey, bending at the side of Miss Mills, with\nmy hand upon the carriage-door!\n\n\"Dora is coming to stay with me. She is coming home with me the day\nafter to-morrow. If you would like to call, I am sure papa would be\nhappy to see you.\"\n\nWhat could I do but invoke a silent blessing on Miss Mills's head, and\nstore Miss Mills's address in the securest corner of my memory! What\ncould I do but tell Miss Mills, with grateful looks and fervent words,\nhow much I appreciated her good offices, and what an inestimable value I\nset upon her friendship!\n\nThen Miss Mills benignantly dismissed me, saying, \"Go back to Dora!\" and\nI went; and Dora leaned out of the carriage to talk to me, and we talked\nall the rest of the way; and I rode my gallant grey so close to the\nwheel that I grazed his near fore leg against it, and \"took the bark\noff,\" as his owner told me, \"to the tune of three pun' sivin\"--which I\npaid, and thought extremely cheap for so much joy. What time Miss Mills\nsat looking at the moon, murmuring verses and recalling, I suppose, the\nancient days when she and earth had anything in common.\n\nNorwood was many miles too near, and we reached it many hours too soon;\nbut Mr. Spenlow came to himself a little short of it, and said, \"You\nmust come in, Copperfield, and rest!\" and I consenting, we had\nsandwiches and wine-and-water. In the light room, Dora blushing looked\nso lovely, that I could not tear myself away, but sat there staring, in\na dream, until the snoring of Mr. Spenlow inspired me with sufficient\nconsciousness to take my leave. So we parted; I riding all the way to\nLondon with the farewell touch of Dora's hand still light on mine,\nrecalling every incident and word ten thousand times; lying down in my\nown bed at last, as enraptured a young noodle as ever was carried out of\nhis five wits by love.\n\nWhen I awoke next morning, I was resolute to declare my passion to Dora,\nand know my fate. Happiness or misery was now the question. There was no\nother question that I knew of in the world, and only Dora could give the\nanswer to it. I passed three days in a luxury of wretchedness, torturing\nmyself by putting every conceivable variety of discouraging construction\non all that ever had taken place between Dora and me. At last, arrayed\nfor the purpose at a vast expense, I went to Miss Mills's, fraught with\na declaration.\n\nHow many times I went up and down the street, and round the\nsquare--painfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle\nthan the original one--before I could persuade myself to go up the\nsteps and knock, is no matter now. Even when, at last, I had knocked,\nand was waiting at the door, I had some flurried thought of asking if\nthat were Mr. Blackboy's (in imitation of poor Barkis), begging pardon,\nand retreating. But I kept my ground.\n\nMr. Mills was not at home. I did not expect he would be. Nobody wanted\n_him_. Miss Mills was at home. Miss Mills would do.\n\nI was shown into a room upstairs, where Miss Mills and Dora were. Jip\nwas there. Miss Mills was copying music (I recollect, it was a new song,\ncalled Affection's Dirge), and Dora was painting flowers. What were my\nfeelings, when I recognised my own flowers; the identical Covent Garden\nMarket purchase! I cannot say that they were very like, or that they\nparticularly resembled any flowers that have ever come under my\nobservation; but I knew from the paper round them, which was accurately\ncopied, what the composition was.\n\nMiss Mills was very glad to see me, and very sorry her Papa was not at\nhome: though I thought we all bore that with fortitude. Miss Mills was\nconversational for a few minutes, and then, laying down her pen upon\nAffection's Dirge, got up, and left the room.\n\nI began to think I would put it off till to-morrow.\n\n\"I hope your poor horse was not tired, when he got home at night,\" said\nDora, lifting up her beautiful eyes. \"It was a long way for him.\"\n\nI began to think I would do it to-day.\n\n\"It was a long way for _him_,\" said I, \"for _he_ had nothing to uphold\nhim on the journey.\"\n\n\"Wasn't he fed, poor thing?\" asked Dora.\n\nI began to think I would put it off till to-morrow.\n\n\"Ye--yes,\" I said, \"he was well taken care of. I mean he had not the\nunutterable happiness that I had in being so near you.\"\n\nDora bent her head over her drawing, and said, after a little while--I\nhad sat, in the interval, in a burning fever, and with my legs in a very\nrigid state--\n\n\"You didn't seem to be sensible of that happiness yourself, at one time\nof the day.\"\n\nI saw now that I was in for it, and it must be done on the spot.\n\n\"You didn't care for that happiness in the least,\" said Dora, slightly\nraising her eyebrows, and shaking her head, \"when you were sitting by\nMiss Kitt.\"\n\nKitt, I should observe, was the name of the creature in pink, with the\nlittle eyes.\n\n\"Though certainly I don't know why you should,\" said Dora, \"or why you\nshould call it a happiness at all. But of course you don't mean what you\nsay. And I am sure no one doubts your being at liberty to do what-ever\nyou like. Jip, you naughty boy, come here!\"\n\nI don't know how I did it. I did it in a moment. I intercepted Jip. I\nhad Dora in my arms. I was full of eloquence. I never stopped for a\nword. I told her how I loved her. I told her I should die without her. I\ntold her that I idolised and worshipped her. Jip barked madly all the\ntime.\n\nWhen Dora hung her head and cried, and trembled, my eloquence increased\nso much the more. If she would like me to die for her, she had but to\nsay the word, and I was ready. Life without Dora's love was not a thing\nto have on any terms. I couldn't bear it, and I wouldn't. I had loved\nher every minute, day and night, since I first saw her. I loved her at\nthat minute to distraction. I should always love her, every minute, to\ndistraction. Lovers had loved before, and lovers would love again; but\nno lover had ever loved, might, could, would, or should ever love, as I\nloved Dora. The more I raved, the more Jip barked. Each of us, in his\nown way, got more mad every moment.\n\nWell, well! Dora and I were sitting on the sofa by-and-by, quiet enough,\nand Jip was lying in her lap, winking peacefully at me. It was off my\nmind. I was in a state of perfect rapture. Dora and I were engaged.\n\nI suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage. We must\nhave had some, because Dora stipulated that we were never to be married\nwithout her papa's consent. But, in our youthful ecstacy, I don't think\nthat we really looked before us or behind us; or had any aspiration\nbeyond the ignorant present. We were to keep our secret from Mr.\nSpenlow; but I am sure the idea never entered my head, then, that there\nwas anything dishonorable in that.\n\nMiss Mills was more than usually pensive when Dora, going to find her,\nbrought her back;--I apprehend, because there was a tendency in what had\npassed to awaken the slumbering echoes in the caverns of memory. But she\ngave us her blessing, and the assurance of her lasting friendship, and\nspoke to us, generally, as became a Voice from the Cloister.\n\nWhat an idle time it was! What an unsubstantial, happy, foolish time it\nwas!\n\nWhen I measured Dora's finger for a ring that was to be made of\nForget-me-nots, and when the jeweller, to whom I took the measure,\nfound me out, and laughed over his order book, and charged me anything\nhe liked, for the pretty little toy, with its blue stones--so\nassociated in my remembrance with Dora's hand, that yesterday, when I\nsaw such another, by chance, on the finger of my own daughter, there\nwas a momentary stirring in my heart, like pain!\n\nWhen I walked about, exalted with my secret, and full of my own\ninterest, and felt the dignity of loving Dora, and of being beloved, so\nmuch, that if I had walked the air, I could not have been more above the\npeople not so situated, who were creeping on the earth!\n\nWhen we had those meetings in the garden of the square, and sat within\nthe dingy summer-house, so happy, that I love the London sparrows to\nthis hour, for nothing else, and see the plumage of the tropics in their\nsmoky feathers!\n\nWhen we had our first great quarrel (within a week of our betrothal),\nand when Dora sent me back the ring, enclosed in a despairing cocked-hat\nnote, wherein she used the terrible expression that \"our love had begun\nin folly, and ended in madness!\" which dreadful words occasioned me to\ntear my hair, and cry that all was over!\n\nWhen, under cover of the night, I flew to Miss Mills, whom I saw by\nstealth in a back kitchen where there was a mangle, and implored Miss\nMills to interpose between us and avert insanity. When Miss Mills\nundertook the office and returned with Dora, exhorting us, from the\npulpit of her own bitter youth, to mutual concession, and the avoidance\nof the Desert of Sahara!\n\nWhen we cried, and made it up, and were so blest again, that the\nback-kitchen, mangle and all, changed to Love's own temple, where\nwe arranged a plan of correspondence through Miss Mills, always to\ncomprehend at least one letter on each side every day!\n\nWhat an idle time! What an unsubstantial, happy, foolish time! Of all\nthe times of mine that Time has in his grip, there is none that in one\nretrospection I can smile at half so much, and think of half so\ntenderly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nMY AUNT ASTONISHES ME.\n\n\nI wrote to Agnes as soon as Dora and I were engaged. I wrote her a long\nletter, in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest I was, and\nwhat a darling Dora was. I entreated Agnes not to regard this as a\nthoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other, or had the\nleast resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about. I\nassured her that its profundity was quite unfathomable, and expressed my\nbelief that nothing like it had ever been known.\n\nSomehow, as I wrote to Agnes on a fine evening by my open window, and\nthe remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing\nover me, it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation\nin which I had been living lately, and of which my very happiness\npartook in some degree, that it soothed me into tears. I remember that I\nsat resting my head upon my hand, when the letter was half done,\ncherishing a general fancy as if Agnes were one of the elements of my\nnatural home. As if, in the retirement of the house made almost sacred\nto me by her presence, Dora and I must be happier than anywhere. As if,\nin love, joy, sorrow, hope, or disappointment; in all emotions; my heart\nturned naturally there, and found its refuge and best friend.\n\nOf Steerforth, I said nothing. I only told her there had been sad grief\nat Yarmouth, on account of Emily's flight; and that on me it made a\ndouble wound, by reason of the circumstances attending it. I knew how\nquick she always was to divine the truth, and that she would never be\nthe first to breathe his name.\n\nTo this letter, I received an answer by return of post. As I read it, I\nseemed to hear Agnes speaking to me. It was like her cordial voice in my\nears. What can I say more!\n\nWhile I had been away from home lately, Traddles had called twice or\nthrice. Finding Peggotty within, and being informed by Peggotty (who\nalways volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it),\nthat she was my old nurse, he had established a good-humoured\nacquaintance with her, and had stayed to have a little chat with her\nabout me. So Peggotty said; but I am afraid the chat was all on her own\nside, and of immoderate length, as she was very difficult indeed to\nstop, God bless her! when she had me for her theme.\n\nThis reminds me, not only that I expected Traddles on a certain\nafternoon of his own appointing, which was now come, but that Mrs. Crupp\nhad resigned everything appertaining to her office (the salary excepted)\nuntil Peggotty should cease to present herself. Mrs. Crupp, after\nholding divers conversations respecting Peggotty, in a very high pitched\nvoice, on the staircase--with some invisible Familiar it would appear,\nfor corporeally speaking she was quite alone at those times--addressed a\nletter to me, developing her views. Beginning it with that statement of\nuniversal application, which fitted every occurrence of her life,\nnamely, that she was a mother herself, she went on to inform me that she\nhad once seen very different days, but that at all periods of her\nexistence she had had a constitutional objection to spies, intruders,\nand informers. She named no names, she said; let them the cap fitted,\nwear it; but spies, intruders, and informers, especially in widders'\nweeds (this clause was underlined), she had ever accustomed herself to\nlook down upon. If a gentleman was the victim of spies, intruders, and\ninformers (but still naming no names), that was his own pleasure. He had\na right to please himself; so let him do. All that she, Mrs. Crupp,\nstipulated for, was, that she should not be \"brought in contract\" with\nsuch persons. Therefore she begged to be excused from any further\nattendance on the top set, until things was as they formerly was, and as\nthey could be wished to be; and further mentioned that her little book\nwould be found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning, when she\nrequested an immediate settlement of the same, with the benevolent view\nof saving trouble, \"and an ill-conwenience\" to all parties.\n\nAfter this, Mrs. Crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the\nstairs, principally with pitchers, and endeavouring to delude Peggotty\ninto breaking her legs. I found it rather harassing to live in this\nstate of siege, but was too much afraid of Mrs. Crupp to see any way out\nof it.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" cried Traddles, punctually appearing at my door,\nin spite of all these obstacles, \"how do you do?\"\n\n\"My dear Traddles,\" said I, \"I am delighted to see you at last, and very\nsorry I have not been at home before. But I have been so much\nengaged----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" said Traddles, \"of course. Yours lives in London, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"She--excuse me--Miss D., you know,\" said Traddles, colouring in his\ngreat delicacy, \"lives in London, I believe?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Near London.\"\n\n\"Mine, perhaps you recollect,\" said Traddles, with a serious look,\n\"lives down in Devonshire--one of ten. Consequently, I am not so much\nengaged as you--in that sense.\"\n\n\"I wonder you can bear,\" I returned, \"to see her so seldom.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" said Traddles, thoughtfully. \"It does seem a wonder. I suppose it\nis, Copperfield, because there's no help for it?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" I replied, with a smile, and not without a blush. \"And\nbecause you have so much constancy and patience, Traddles.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Traddles, considering about it, \"do I strike you in that\nway, Copperfield? Really I didn't know that I had. But she is such an\nextraordinarily dear girl herself, that it's possible she may have\nimparted something of those virtues to me. Now you mention it,\nCopperfield, I shouldn't wonder at all. I assure you she is always\nforgetting herself, and taking care of the other nine.\"\n\n\"Is she the eldest?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said Traddles. \"The eldest is a Beauty.\"\n\nHe saw, I suppose, that I could not help smiling at the simplicity of\nthis reply; and added, with a smile upon his own ingenuous face:\n\n\"Not, of course, but that my Sophy--pretty name, Copperfield, I always\nthink?\"\n\n\"Very pretty!\" said I.\n\n\"Not, of course, but that Sophy is beautiful too, in my eyes, and would\nbe one of the dearest girls that ever was, in anybody's eyes (I should\nthink). But when I say the eldest is a Beauty, I mean she really is a--\"\nhe seemed to be describing clouds about himself, with both hands:\n\"Splendid, you know,\" said Traddles, energetically.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, I assure you,\" said Traddles, \"something very uncommon, indeed!\nThen, you know, being formed for society and admiration, and not being\nable to enjoy much of it, in consequence of their limited means, she\nnaturally gets a little irritable and exacting, sometimes. Sophy puts\nher in good humour!\"\n\n\"Is Sophy the youngest?\" I hazarded.\n\n\"Oh dear, no!\" said Traddles, stroking his chin. \"The two youngest are\nonly nine and ten. Sophy educates 'em.\"\n\n\"The second daughter, perhaps?\" I hazarded.\n\n\"No,\" said Traddles. \"Sarah's the second. Sarah has something the matter\nwith her spine, poor girl. The malady will wear out by-and-by, the\ndoctors say, but in the meantime she has to lie down for a twelvemonth.\nSophy nurses her. Sophy's the fourth.\"\n\n\"Is the mother living?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Traddles, \"she is alive. She is a very superior woman,\nindeed, but the damp country is not adapted to her constitution, and--in\nfact, she has lost the use of her limbs.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said I.\n\n\"Very sad, is it not?\" returned Traddles. \"But in a merely domestic view\nit is not so bad as it might be, because Sophy takes her place. She is\nquite as much a mother _to_ her mother, as she is to the other nine.\"\n\nI felt the greatest admiration for the virtues of this young lady; and,\nhonestly with the view of doing my best to prevent the good-nature of\nTraddles from being imposed upon, to the detriment of their joint\nprospects in life, inquired how Mr. Micawber was?\n\n\"He is quite well, Copperfield, thank you,\" said Traddles. \"I am not\nliving with him at present.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No. You see the truth is,\" said Traddles, in a whisper, \"he has changed\nhis name to Mortimer, in consequence of his temporary embarrassments;\nand he don't come out till after dark--and then in spectacles. There was\nan execution put into our house, for rent. Mrs. Micawber was in such a\ndreadful state that I really couldn't resist giving my name to that\nsecond bill we spoke of here. You may imagine how delightful it was to\nmy feelings, Copperfield, to see the matter settled with it, and Mrs.\nMicawber recover her spirits.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said I.\n\n\"Not that her happiness was of long duration,\" pursued Traddles, \"for,\nunfortunately, within a week another execution came in. It broke up the\nestablishment. I have been living in a furnished apartment since then,\nand the Mortimers have been very private indeed. I hope you won't think\nit selfish, Copperfield, if I mention that the broker carried off my\nlittle round table with the marble top, and Sophy's flower-pot and\nstand?\"\n\n\"What a hard thing!\" I exclaimed indignantly.\n\n\"It was a----it was a pull,\" said Traddles, with his usual wince at that\nexpression. \"I don't mention it reproachfully, however, but with a\nmotive. The fact is, Copperfield, I was unable to repurchase them at the\ntime of their seizure; in the first place, because the broker, having an\nidea that I wanted them, ran the price up to an extravagant extent; and,\nin the second place, because I--hadn't any money. Now, I have kept my\neye since, upon the broker's shop,\" said Traddles, with a great\nenjoyment of his mystery, \"which is up at the top of Tottenham Court\nRoad, and, at last, to-day I find them put out for sale. I have only\nnoticed them from over the way, because if the broker saw _me_, bless\nyou, he'd ask any price for them! What has occurred to me, having now\nthe money, is, that perhaps you wouldn't object to ask that good nurse\nof yours to come with me to the shop--I can show it her from round the\ncorner of the next street--and make the best bargain for them, as if\nthey were for herself, that she can!\"\n\nThe delight with which Traddles propounded this plan to me, and the\nsense he had of its uncommon artfulness, are among the freshest things\nin my remembrance.\n\nI told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him, and that\nwe would all three take the field together, but on one condition. That\ncondition was, that he should make a solemn resolution to grant no more\nloans of his name, or anything else, to Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Traddles, \"I have already done so, because I\nbegin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate, but that I have\nbeen positively unjust to Sophy. My word being passed to myself, there\nis no longer any apprehension; but I pledge it to you, too, with the\ngreatest readiness. That first unlucky obligation, I have paid. I have\nno doubt Mr. Micawber would have paid it if he could, but he could not.\nOne thing I ought to mention, which I like very much in Mr. Micawber,\nCopperfield. It refers to the second obligation, which is not yet due.\nHe don't tell me that it _is_ provided for, but he says it _will be_.\nNow, I think there is something very fair and honest about that!\"\n\nI was unwilling to damp my good friend's confidence, and therefore\nassented. After a little further conversation, we went round to the\nchandler's shop, to enlist Peggotty; Traddles declining to pass the\nevening with me, both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions\nthat his property would be bought by somebody else before he could\nre-purchase it, and because it was the evening he always devoted to\nwriting to the dearest girl in the world.\n\nI never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street in\nTottenham Court Road, while Peggotty was bargaining for the precious\narticles; or his agitation when she came slowly towards us after vainly\noffering a price, and was hailed by the relenting broker, and went back\nagain. The end of the negotiation was, that she bought the property on\ntolerably easy terms, and Traddles was transported with pleasure.\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, indeed,\" said Traddles, on hearing it\nwas to be sent to where he lived, that night. \"If I might ask one other\nfavor, I hope you wouldn't think it absurd, Copperfield?\"\n\nI said beforehand, certainly not.\n\n\"Then if you _would_ be good enough,\" said Traddles to Peggotty, \"to\nget the flower-pot now, I think I should like (it being Sophy's,\nCopperfield) to carry it home myself!\"\n\nPeggotty was glad to get it for him, and he overwhelmed her with thanks,\nand went his way up Tottenham Court Road, carrying the flower-pot\naffectionately in his arms, with one of the most delighted expressions\nof countenance I ever saw.\n\nWe then turned back towards my chambers. As the shops had charms for\nPeggotty which I never knew them possess in the same degree for anybody\nelse, I sauntered easily along, amused by her staring in at the windows,\nand waiting for her as often as she chose. We were thus a good while in\ngetting to the Adelphi.\n\nOn our way upstairs, I called her attention to the sudden disappearance\nof Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps. We\nwere both very much surprised, coming higher up, to find my outer door\nstanding open (which I had shut), and to hear voices inside.\n\nWe looked at one another, without knowing what to make of this, and went\ninto the sitting-room. What was my amazement to find, of all people upon\nearth, my aunt there, and Mr. Dick! My aunt sitting on a quantity of\nluggage, with her two birds before her, and her cat on her knee, like a\nfemale Robinson Crusoe, drinking tea. Mr. Dick leaning thoughtfully on a\ngreat kite, such as we had often been out together to fly, with more\nluggage piled about him!\n\n  [Illustration: My Aunt astonishes me.]\n\n\"My dear aunt!\" cried I. \"Why, what an unexpected pleasure!\"\n\nWe cordially embraced; and Mr. Dick and I cordially shook hands; and\nMrs. Crupp, who was busy making tea, and could not be too attentive,\ncordially said she had knowed well as Mr. Copperfull would have his\nheart in his mouth, when he see his dear relations.\n\n\"Halloa!\" said my aunt to Peggotty, who quailed before her awful\npresence. \"How are _you_?\"\n\n\"You remember my aunt, Peggotty?\" said I.\n\n\"For the love of goodness, child,\" exclaimed my aunt, \"don't call the\nwoman by that South Sea Island name! If she married and got rid of it,\nwhich was the best thing she could do, why don't you give her the\nbenefit of the change? What's your name now,--P?\" said my aunt, as a\ncompromise for the obnoxious appellation.\n\n\"Barkis, ma'am,\" said Peggotty, with a curtsey.\n\n\"Well! that's human,\" said my aunt. \"It sounds less as if you wanted a\nMissionary. How d' ye do, Barkis? I hope you're well?\"\n\nEncouraged by these gracious words, and by my aunt's extending her hand,\nBarkis came forward, and took the hand, and curtseyed her\nacknowledgments.\n\n\"We are older than we were, I see,\" said my aunt. \"We have only met each\nother once before, you know. A nice business we made of it then! Trot,\nmy dear, another cup.\"\n\nI handed it dutifully to my aunt, who was in her usual inflexible state\nof figure; and ventured a remonstrance with her on the subject of her\nsitting on a box.\n\n\"Let me draw the sofa here, or the easy chair, aunt,\" said I. \"Why\nshould you be so uncomfortable?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Trot,\" replied my aunt, \"I prefer to sit upon my property.\"\nHere my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp, and observed, \"We needn't\ntrouble you to wait, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?\" said Mrs.\nCrupp.\n\n\"No, I thank you, ma'am,\" replied my aunt.\n\n\"Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?\" said Mrs. Crupp.\n\"Or would you be persuaded to try a new-laid hegg? or should I brile a\nrasher? Ain't there nothing I could do for your dear aunt, Mr.\nCopperfull?\"\n\n\"Nothing, ma'am,\" returned my aunt. \"I shall do very well, I thank you.\"\n\nMrs. Crupp, who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper,\nand incessantly holding her head on one side, to express a general\nfeebleness of constitution, and incessantly rubbing her hands, to\nexpress a desire to be of service to all deserving objects, gradually\nsmiled herself, one-sided herself, and rubbed herself, out of the room.\n\n\"Dick!\" said my aunt. \"You know what I told you about time-servers and\nwealth-worshippers?\"\n\nMr. Dick--with rather a scared look, as if he had forgotten it--returned\na hasty answer in the affirmative.\n\n\"Mrs. Crupp is one of them,\" said my aunt. \"Barkis, I'll trouble you to\nlook after the tea, and let me have another cup, for I don't fancy that\nwoman's pouring-out!\"\n\nI knew my aunt sufficiently well to know that she had something of\nimportance on her mind, and that there was far more matter in this\narrival than a stranger might have supposed. I noticed how her eye\nlighted on me, when she thought my attention otherwise occupied; and\nwhat a curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on within her,\nwhile she preserved her outward stiffness and composure. I began to\nreflect whether I had done anything to offend her; and my conscience\nwhispered me that I had not yet told her about Dora. Could it by any\nmeans be that, I wondered!\n\nAs I knew she would only speak in her own good time, I sat down near\nher, and spoke to the birds, and played with the cat, and was as easy as\nI could be. But I was very far from being really easy; and I should\nstill have been so, even if Mr. Dick, leaning over the great kite behind\nmy aunt, had not taken every secret opportunity of shaking his head\ndarkly at me, and pointing at her.\n\n\"Trot,\" said my aunt at last, when she had finished her tea, and\ncarefully smoothed down her dress, and wiped her lips--\"you needn't go,\nBarkis!--Trot, have you got to be firm, and self-reliant?\"\n\n\"I hope so, aunt.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" inquired Miss Betsey.\n\n\"I think so, aunt.\"\n\n\"Then why, my love,\" said my aunt, looking earnestly at me, \"why do you\nthink I prefer to sit upon this property of mine to-night?\"\n\nI shook my head, unable to guess.\n\n\"Because,\" said my aunt, \"it's all I have. Because I'm ruined, my dear!\"\n\nIf the house, and every one of us, had tumbled out into the river\ntogether, I could hardly have received a greater shock.\n\n\"Dick knows it,\" said my aunt, laying her hand calmly on my shoulder. \"I\nam ruined, my dear Trot! All I have in the world is in this room, except\nthe cottage; and that I have left Janet to let. Barkis, I want to get a\nbed for this gentleman to-night. To save expense, perhaps you can make\nup something here for myself. Anything will do. It's only for to-night.\nWe'll talk about this, more, to-morrow.\"\n\nI was roused from my amazement, and concern for her--I am sure, for\nher--by her falling on my neck, for a moment, and crying that she only\ngrieved for me. In another moment, she suppressed this emotion; and\nsaid with an aspect more triumphant than dejected:\n\n\"We must meet reverses boldly, and not suffer them to frighten us, my\ndear. We must learn to act the play out. We must live misfortune down,\nTrot!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nDEPRESSION.\n\n\nAs soon as I could recover my presence of mind, which quite deserted me\nin the first overpowering shock of my aunt's intelligence, I proposed to\nMr. Dick to come round to the chandler's shop, and take possession of\nthe bed which Mr. Peggotty had lately vacated. The chandler's shop being\nin Hungerford Market, and Hungerford Market being a very different place\nin those days, there was a low wooden colonnade before the door (not\nvery unlike that before the house where the little man and woman used to\nlive, in the old weather-glass), which pleased Mr. Dick mightily. The\nglory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him, I dare\nsay, for many inconveniences; but, as there were really few to bear,\nbeyond the compound of flavors I have already mentioned, and perhaps the\nwant of a little more elbow-room, he was perfectly charmed with his\naccommodation. Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that there wasn't\nroom to swing a cat there; but, as Mr. Dick justly observed to me,\nsitting down on the foot of the bed, nursing his leg, \"You know,\nTrotwood, I don't want to swing a cat. I never do swing a cat.\nTherefore, what does that signify to _me_!\"\n\nI tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the\ncauses of this sudden and great change in my aunt's affairs. As I might\nhave expected, he had none at all. The only account he could give of it,\nwas, that my aunt had said to him, the day before yesterday, \"Now, Dick,\nare you really and truly the philosopher I take you for?\" That then he\nhad said, Yes, he hoped so. That then my aunt had said, \"Dick, I am\nruined.\" That then he had said \"Oh, indeed!\" That then my aunt had\npraised him highly, which he was very glad of. And that then they had\ncome to me, and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road.\n\nMr. Dick was so very complacent, sitting on the foot of the bed, nursing\nhis leg, and telling me this, with his eyes wide open and a surprised\nsmile, that I am sorry to say I was provoked into explaining to him that\nruin meant distress, want, and starvation; but, I was soon bitterly\nreproved for this harshness, by seeing his face turn pale, and tears\ncourse down his lengthened cheeks, while he fixed upon me a look of such\nunutterable woe, that it might have softened a far harder heart than\nmine. I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had\ntaken to depress him; and I soon understood (as I ought to have known at\nfirst) that he had been so confident, merely because of his faith in the\nwisest and most wonderful of women, and his unbounded reliance on my\nintellectual resources. The latter, I believe, he considered a match for\nany kind of disaster not absolutely mortal.\n\n\"What can we do, Trotwood?\" said Mr. Dick. \"There's the Memorial--\"\n\n\"To be sure there is,\" said I. \"But all we can do just now, Mr. Dick, is\nto keep a cheerful countenance, and not let my aunt see that we are\nthinking about it.\"\n\nHe assented to this in the most earnest manner; and implored me, if I\nshould see him wandering an inch out of the right course, to recal him\nby some of those superior methods which were always at my command. But I\nregret to state that the fright I had given him proved too much for his\nbest attempts at concealment. All the evening his eyes wandered to my\naunt's face, with an expression of the most dismal apprehension, as if\nhe saw her growing thin on the spot. He was conscious of this, and put a\nconstraint upon his head; but his keeping that immovable, and sitting\nrolling his eyes like a piece of machinery, did not mend the matter at\nall. I saw him look at the loaf at supper (which happened to be a small\none), as if nothing else stood between us and famine; and when my aunt\ninsisted on his making his customary repast, I detected him in the act\nof pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese; I have no doubt for the\npurpose of reviving us with those savings, when we should have reached\nan advanced stage of attenuation.\n\nMy aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which was a\nlesson to all of us--to me, I am sure. She was extremely gracious to\nPeggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by that name; and,\nstrange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite at home. She was to\nhave my bed, and I was to lie in the sitting-room, to keep guard over\nher. She made a great point of being so near the river, in case of a\nconflagration; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in that\ncircumstance.\n\n\"Trot, my dear,\" said my aunt, when she saw me making preparations for\ncompounding her usual night-draught, \"No!\"\n\n\"Nothing, aunt?\"\n\n\"Not wine, my dear. Ale.\"\n\n\"But there is wine here, aunt. And you always have it made of wine.\"\n\n\"Keep that, in case of sickness,\" said my aunt. \"We mustn't use it\ncarelessly, Trot. Ale for me. Half a pint.\"\n\nI thought Mr. Dick would have fallen, insensible. My aunt being\nresolute, I went out and got the ale myself. As it was growing late,\nPeggotty and Mr. Dick took that opportunity of repairing to the\nchandler's shop together. I parted from him, poor fellow, at the corner\nof the street, with his great kite at his back, a very monument of human\nmisery.\n\nMy aunt was walking up and down the room when I returned, crimping the\nborders of her nightcap with her fingers. I warmed the ale and made the\ntoast on the usual infallible principles. When it was ready for her, she\nwas ready for it, with her nightcap on, and the skirt of her gown turned\nback on her knees.\n\n\"My dear,\" said my aunt, after taking a spoonful of it; \"it's a great\ndeal better than wine. Not half so bilious.\"\n\nI suppose I looked doubtful, for she added:\n\n\"Tut, tut, child. If nothing worse than Ale happens to us, we are well\noff.\"\n\n\"I should think so myself, aunt, I am sure,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, then, why _don't_ you think so?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Because you and I are very different people,\" I returned.\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense, Trot!\" replied my aunt.\n\nMy aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment, in which there was very little\naffectation, if any; drinking the warm ale with a teaspoon, and soaking\nher strips of toast in it.\n\n\"Trot,\" said she, \"I don't care for strange faces in general, but I\nrather like that Barkis of yours, do you know!\"\n\n\"It's better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so!\" said I.\n\n\"It's a most extraordinary world,\" observed my aunt, rubbing her nose;\n\"how that woman ever got into it with that name, is unaccountable to me.\nIt would be much more easy to be born a Jackson, or something of that\nsort, one would think.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she thinks so, too; it's not her fault,\" said I.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" returned my aunt, rather grudging the admission; \"but\nit's very aggravating. However, she's Barkis _now_. That's some comfort.\nBarkis is uncommonly fond of you, Trot.\"\n\n\"There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it,\" said I.\n\n\"Nothing, I believe,\" returned my aunt. \"Here, the poor fool has been\nbegging and praying about handing over some of her money--because she\nhas got too much of it! A simpleton!\"\n\nMy aunt's tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the warm\nale.\n\n\"She's the most ridiculous creature that ever was born,\" said my aunt.\n\"I knew, from the first moment when I saw her with that poor dear\nblessed baby of a mother of yours, that she was the most ridiculous of\nmortals. But there are good points in Barkis!\"\n\nAffecting to laugh, she got an opportunity of putting her hand to her\neyes. Having availed herself of it, she resumed her toast and her\ndiscourse together.\n\n\"Ah! Mercy upon us!\" sighed my aunt. \"I know all about it, Trot! Barkis\nand myself had quite a gossip while you were out with Dick. I know all\nabout it. I don't know where these wretched girls expect to go to, for\nmy part. I wonder they don't knock out their brains against--against\nmantelpieces,\" said my aunt; an idea which was probably suggested to her\nby her contemplation of mine.\n\n\"Poor Emily!\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, don't talk to me about poor,\" returned my aunt. \"She should have\nthought of that, before she caused so much misery! Give me a kiss, Trot.\nI am sorry for your early experience.\"\n\nAs I bent forward, she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Oh, Trot, Trot! And so you fancy yourself in love! Do you?\"\n\n\"Fancy, aunt!\" I exclaimed, as red as I could be. \"I adore her with my\nwhole soul!\"\n\n\"Dora, indeed!\" returned my aunt. \"And you mean to say the little thing\nis very fascinating, I suppose?\"\n\n\"My dear aunt,\" I replied, \"no one can form the least idea what she is!\"\n\n\"Ah! And not silly?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Silly, aunt!\"\n\nI seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single\nmoment, to consider whether she was or not. I resented the idea, of\ncourse; but I was in a manner struck by it, as a new one altogether.\n\n\"Not light-headed?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Light-headed, aunt!\" I could only repeat this daring speculation with\nthe same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding\nquestion.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said my aunt. \"I only ask. I don't depreciate her. Poor\nlittle couple! And so you think you were formed for one another, and are\nto go through a party-supper-table kind of life, like two pretty pieces\nof confectionary, do you, Trot?\"\n\nShe asked me this so kindly, and with such a gentle air, half playful\nand half sorrowful, that I was quite touched.\n\n\"We are young and inexperienced, aunt, I know,\" I replied; \"and I dare\nsay we say and think a good deal that is rather foolish. But we love one\nanother truly, I am sure. If I thought Dora could ever love anybody\nelse, or cease to love me; or that I could ever love anybody else, or\ncease to love her; I don't know what I should do--go out of my mind, I\nthink!\"\n\n\"Ah, Trot!\" said my aunt, shaking her head, and smiling gravely; \"blind,\nblind, blind!\"\n\n\"Some one that I know, Trot,\" my aunt pursued, after a pause, \"though of\na very pliant disposition, has an earnestness of affection in him that\nreminds me of poor Baby. Earnestness is what that Somebody must look\nfor, to sustain him and improve him, Trot. Deep, downright, faithful\nearnestness.\"\n\n\"If you only knew the earnestness of Dora, aunt!\" I cried.\n\n\"Oh, Trot!\" she said again; \"blind, blind!\" and without knowing why, I\nfelt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow me like a\ncloud.\n\n\"However,\" said my aunt, \"I don't want to put two young creatures out of\nconceit with themselves, or to make them unhappy; so, though it is a\ngirl and boy attachment, and girl and boy attachments very often--mind!\nI don't say always!--come to nothing, still we'll be serious about it,\nand hope for a prosperous issue one of these days. There's time enough\nfor it to come to anything!\"\n\nThis was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover; but I\nwas glad to have my aunt in my confidence, and I was mindful of her\nbeing fatigued. So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her\naffection, and for all her other kindnesses towards me; and after a\ntender good night, she took her nightcap into my bedroom.\n\nHow miserable I was, when I lay down! How I thought and thought about my\nbeing poor, in Mr. Spenlow's eyes; about my not being what I thought I\nwas, when I proposed to Dora; about the chivalrous necessity of telling\nDora what my worldly condition was, and releasing her from her\nengagement if she thought fit; about how I should contrive to live,\nduring the long term of my articles, when I was earning nothing; about\ndoing something to assist my aunt, and seeing no way of doing anything;\nabout coming down to have no money in my pocket, and to wear a shabby\ncoat, and to be able to carry Dora no little presents, and to ride no\ngallant greys, and to show myself in no agreeable light! Sordid and\nselfish as I knew it was, and as I tortured myself by knowing that it\nwas, to let my mind run on my own distress so much, I was so devoted to\nDora that I could not help it. I knew that it was base in me not to\nthink more of my aunt, and less of myself; but, so far, selfishness was\ninseparable from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side for any\nmortal creature. How exceedingly miserable I was, that night!\n\nAs to sleep, I had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes, but I\nseemed to dream without the previous ceremony of going to sleep. Now I\nwas ragged, wanting to sell Dora matches, six bundles for a halfpenny;\nnow I was at the office in a nightgown and boots, remonstrated with by\nMr. Spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire; now I\nwas hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell from old Tiffey's daily\nbiscuit, regularly eaten when Saint Paul's struck one; now I was\nhopelessly endeavouring to get a license to marry Dora, having nothing\nbut one of Uriah Heep's gloves to offer in exchange, which the whole\nCommons rejected; and still, more or less conscious of my own room, I\nwas always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes.\n\nMy aunt was restless, too, for I frequently heard her walking to and\nfro. Two or three times in the course of the night, attired in a long\nflannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high, she appeared, like\na disturbed ghost, in my room, and came to the side of the sofa on which\nI lay. On the first occasion I started up in alarm, to learn that she\ninferred from a particular light in the sky, that Westminster Abbey was\non fire; and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its\nigniting Buckingham Street, in case the wind changed. Lying still, after\nthat, I found that she sat down near me, whispering to herself \"Poor\nboy!\" And then it made me twenty times more wretched, to know how\nunselfishly mindful she was of me, and how selfishly mindful I was of\nmyself.\n\nIt was difficult to believe that a night so long to me, could be short\nto anybody else. This consideration set me thinking and thinking of an\nimaginary party where people were dancing the hours away, until that\nbecame a dream too, and I heard the music incessantly playing one tune,\nand saw Dora incessantly dancing one dance, without taking the least\nnotice of me. The man who had been playing the harp all night, was\ntrying in vain to cover it with an ordinary sized nightcap, when I\nawoke; or I should rather say, when I left off trying to go to sleep,\nand saw the sun shining in through the window at last.\n\nThere was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the\nstreets out of the Strand--it may be there still--in which I have had\nmany a cold plunge. Dressing myself as quietly as I could, and leaving\nPeggotty to look after my aunt, I tumbled head foremost into it, and\nthen went for a walk to Hampstead. I had a hope that this brisk\ntreatment might freshen my wits a little; and I think it did them good,\nfor I soon came to the conclusion that the first step I ought to take\nwas, to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered.\nI got some breakfast on the Heath, and walked back to Doctors' Commons,\nalong the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers,\ngrowing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters' heads, intent on\nthis first effort to meet our altered circumstances.\n\nI arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's\nloitering about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first,\nappeared with his key. Then I sat down in my shady corner, looking up at\nthe sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking about Dora;\nuntil Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly.\n\n\"How are you, Copperfield?\" said he. \"Fine morning!\"\n\n\"Beautiful morning, sir,\" said I. \"Could I say a word to you before you\ngo into Court?\"\n\n\"By all means,\" said he. \"Come into my room.\"\n\nI followed him into his room, and he began putting on his gown, and\ntouching himself up before a little glass he had, hanging inside a\ncloset door.\n\n\"I am sorry to say,\" said I, \"that I have some rather disheartening\nintelligence from my aunt.\"\n\n\"No!\" said he. \"Dear me! Not paralysis, I hope?\"\n\n\"It has no reference to her health, sir,\" I replied. \"She has met with\nsome large losses. In fact, she has very little left, indeed.\"\n\n\"You as-tound me, Copperfield!\" cried Mr. Spenlow.\n\nI shook my head. \"Indeed, sir,\" said I, \"her affairs are so changed,\nthat I wished to ask you whether it would be possible--at a sacrifice on\nour part of some portion of the premium, of course,\" I put in this, on\nthe spur of the moment, warned by the blank expression of his face--\"to\ncancel my articles?\"\n\nWhat it cost me to make this proposal, nobody knows. It was like asking,\nas a favor, to be sentenced to transportation from Dora.\n\n\"To cancel your articles, Copperfield? Cancel?\"\n\nI explained with tolerable firmness, that I really did not know where my\nmeans of subsistence were to come from, unless I could earn them for\nmyself. I had no fear for the future, I said--and I laid great emphasis\non that, as if to imply that I should still be decidedly eligible for a\nson-in-law one of these days--but, for the present, I was thrown upon my\nown resources.\n\n\"I am extremely sorry to hear this, Copperfield,\" said Mr. Spenlow.\n\"Extremely sorry. It is not usual to cancel articles for any such\nreason. It is not a professional course of proceeding. It is not a\nconvenient precedent at all. Far from it. At the same time\"--\n\n\"You are very good, sir,\" I murmured, anticipating a concession.\n\n\"Not at all. Don't mention it,\" said Mr. Spenlow. \"At the same time, I\nwas going to say, if it had been my lot to have my hands unfettered--if\nI had not a partner--Mr. Jorkins\"--\n\nMy hopes were dashed in a moment, but I made another effort.\n\n\"Do you think, sir,\" said I, \"if I were to mention it to Mr. Jorkins--\"\n\nMr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly. \"Heaven forbid, Copperfield,\"\nhe replied, \"that I should do any man an injustice; still less, Mr.\nJorkins. But I know my partner, Copperfield. Mr. Jorkins is _not_ a man\nto respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature. Mr. Jorkins is very\ndifficult to move from the beaten track. You know what he is!\"\n\nI am sure I knew nothing about him, except that he had originally been\nalone in the business, and now lived by himself in a house near Montagu\nSquare, which was fearfully in want of painting; that he came very late\nof a day, and went away very early; that he never appeared to be\nconsulted about anything; and that he had a dingy little black-hole of\nhis own up-stairs, where no business was ever done, and where there was\na yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon his desk, unsoiled by ink, and\nreported to be twenty years of age.\n\n\"Would you object to my mentioning it to him, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"By no means,\" said Mr. Spenlow. \"But I have some experience of Mr.\nJorkins, Copperfield. I wish it were otherwise, for I should be happy to\nmeet your views in any respect. I cannot have the least objection to\nyour mentioning it to Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield, if you think it worth\nwhile.\"\n\nAvailing myself of this permission, which was given with a warm shake of\nthe hand, I sat thinking about Dora, and looking at the sunlight\nstealing from the chimney-pots down the wall of the opposite house,\nuntil Mr. Jorkins came. I then went up to Mr. Jorkins's room, and\nevidently astonished Mr. Jorkins very much by making my appearance\nthere.\n\n\"Come in, Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mr. Jorkins. \"Come in!\"\n\nI went in, and sat down; and stated my case to Mr. Jorkins pretty much\nas I had stated it to Mr. Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins was not by any means the\nawful creature one might have expected, but a large, mild, smooth-faced\nman of sixty, who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the\nCommons that he lived principally on that stimulant, having little room\nin his system for any other article of diet.\n\n\"You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?\" said Mr. Jorkins;\nwhen he had heard me, very restlessly, to an end.\n\nI answered Yes, and told him that Mr. Spenlow had introduced his name.\n\n\"He said I should object?\" asked Mr. Jorkins.\n\nI was obliged to admit that Mr. Spenlow had considered it probable.\n\n\"I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can't advance your object,\" said\nMr. Jorkins, nervously. \"The fact is--but I have an appointment at the\nBank, if you'll have the goodness to excuse me.\"\n\nWith that he rose in a great hurry, and was going out of the room, when\nI made bold to say that I feared, then, there was no way of arranging\nthe matter?\n\n\"No!\" said Mr. Jorkins, stopping at the door to shake his head. \"Oh, no!\nI object, you know,\" which he said very rapidly, and went out. \"You must\nbe aware, Mr. Copperfield,\" he added, looking restlessly in at the door\nagain, \"if Mr. Spenlow objects----\"\n\n\"Personally, he does not object, sir,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh! Personally!\" repeated Mr. Jorkins, in an impatient manner. \"I\nassure you there's an objection, Mr. Copperfield. Hopeless! What you\nwish to be done, can't be done. I--I really have got an appointment at\nthe Bank.\" With that he fairly ran away; and to the best of my\nknowledge, it was three days before he showed himself in the Commons\nagain.\n\nBeing very anxious to leave no stone unturned, I waited until Mr.\nSpenlow came in, and then described what had passed; giving him to\nunderstand that I was not hopeless of his being able to soften the\nadamantine Jorkins, if he would undertake that task.\n\n\"Copperfield,\" returned Mr. Spenlow, with a sagacious smile, \"you have\nnot known my partner, Mr. Jorkins, as long as I have. Nothing is farther\nfrom my thoughts than to attribute any degree of artifice to Mr.\nJorkins. But Mr. Jorkins has a way of stating his objections which often\ndeceives people. No, Copperfield!\" shaking his head. \"Mr. Jorkins is not\nto be moved, believe me!\"\n\nI was completely bewildered between Mr. Spenlow and Mr. Jorkins, as to\nwhich of them really was the objecting partner; but I saw with\nsufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm, and\nthat the recovery of my aunt's thousand pounds was out of the question.\nIn a state of despondency, which I remember with anything but\nsatisfaction, for I know it still had too much reference to myself\n(though always in connexion with Dora), I left the office, and went\nhomeward.\n\nI was trying to familiarise my mind with the worst, and to present to\nmyself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their\nsternest aspect, when a hackney chariot coming after me, and stopping at\nmy very feet, occasioned me to look up. A fair hand was stretched forth\nto me from the window; and the face I had never seen without a feeling\nof serenity and happiness, from the moment when it first turned back on\nthe old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade, and when I\nassociated its softened beauty with the stained glass window in the\nchurch, was smiling on me.\n\n\"Agnes!\" I joyfully exclaimed. \"Oh, my dear Agnes, of all people in the\nworld, what a pleasure to see you!\"\n\n\"Is it, indeed?\" she said, in her cordial voice.\n\n\"I want to talk to you so much!\" said I. \"It's such a lightening of my\nheart, only to look at you! If I had had a conjuror's cap, there is no\none I should have wished for but you!\"\n\n\"What?\" returned Agnes.\n\n\"Well! perhaps Dora, first,\" I admitted, with a blush.\n\n\"Certainly, Dora first, I hope,\" said Agnes, laughing.\n\n\"But you next!\" said I. \"Where are you going?\"\n\nShe was going to my rooms to see my aunt. The day being very fine, she\nwas glad to come out of the chariot, which smelt (I had my head in it\nall this time) like a stable put under a cucumber-frame. I dismissed the\ncoachman, and she took my arm, and we walked on together. She was like\nHope embodied, to me. How different I felt in one short minute, having\nAgnes at my side!\n\nMy aunt had written her one of the odd, abrupt notes--very little longer\nthan a Bank note--to which her epistolary efforts were usually limited.\nShe had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity, and was\nleaving Dover for good, but had quite made up her mind to it, and was so\nwell that nobody need be uncomfortable about her. Agnes had come to\nLondon to see my aunt, between whom and herself there had been a mutual\nliking these many years: indeed, it dated from the time of my taking up\nmy residence in Mr. Wickfield's house. She was not alone, she said. Her\npapa was with her--and Uriah Heep.\n\n\"And now they are partners,\" said I. \"Confound him!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Agnes. \"They have some business here; and I took advantage\nof their coming, to come too. You must not think my visit all friendly\nand disinterested, Trotwood, for--I am afraid I may be cruelly\nprejudiced--I do not like to let papa go away alone, with him.\"\n\n\"Does he exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still, Agnes?\"\n\nAgnes shook her head. \"There is such a change at home,\" said she, \"that\nyou would scarcely know the dear old house. They live with us now.\"\n\n\"They?\" said I.\n\n\"Mr. Heep and his mother. He sleeps in your old room,\" said Agnes,\nlooking up into my face.\n\n\"I wish I had the ordering of his dreams,\" said I. \"He wouldn't sleep\nthere long.\"\n\n\"I keep my own little room,\" said Agnes, \"where I used to learn my\nlessons. How the time goes! You remember? The little panelled room that\nopens from the drawing-room?\"\n\n\"Remember, Agnes? When I saw you, for the first time, coming out at the\ndoor, with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side?\"\n\n\"It is just the same,\" said Agnes, smiling. \"I am glad you think of it\nso pleasantly. We were very happy.\"\n\n\"We were, indeed,\" said I.\n\n\"I keep that room to myself still; but I cannot always desert Mrs. Heep,\nyou know. And so,\" said Agnes quietly, \"I feel obliged to bear her\ncompany, when I might prefer to be alone. But I have no other reason to\ncomplain of her. If she tires me, sometimes, by her praises of her son,\nit is only natural in a mother. He is a very good son to her.\"\n\nI looked at Agnes when she said these words, without detecting in her\nany consciousness of Uriah's design. Her mild but earnest eyes met mine\nwith their own beautiful frankness, and there was no change in her\ngentle face.\n\n\"The chief evil of their presence in the house,\" said Agnes, \"is that I\ncannot be as near papa as I could wish--Uriah Heep being so much between\nus--and cannot watch over him, if that is not too bold a thing to say,\nas closely as I would. But, if any fraud or treachery is practising\nagainst him, I hope that simple love and truth will be stronger, in the\nend. I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any\nevil or misfortune in the world.\"\n\nA certain bright smile which I never saw on any other face, died away,\neven while I thought how good it was, and how familiar it had once been\nto me; and she asked me, with a quick change of expression (we were\ndrawing very near my street), if I knew how the reverse in my aunt's\ncircumstances had been brought about. On my replying no, she had not\ntold me yet, Agnes became thoughtful, and I fancied I felt her arm\ntremble in mine.\n\nWe found my aunt alone, in a state of some excitement. A difference of\nopinion had arisen between herself and Mrs. Crupp, on an abstract\nquestion (the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex);\nand my aunt, utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp,\nhad cut the dispute short, by informing that lady that she smelt of my\nbrandy, and that she would trouble her to walk out. Both of these\nexpressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable, and had expressed her\nintention of bringing before a \"British Judy\"--meaning, it was supposed,\nthe bulwark of our national liberties.\n\nMy aunt, however, having had time to cool, while Peggotty was out\nshowing Mr. Dick the soldiers at the Horse Guards--and being, besides,\ngreatly pleased to see Agnes--rather plumed herself on the affair than\notherwise, and received us with unimpaired good humour. When Agnes laid\nher bonnet on the table, and sat down beside her, I could not but think,\nlooking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead, how natural it seemed\nto have her there; how trustfully, although she was so young and\ninexperienced, my aunt confided in her; how strong she was, indeed, in\nsimple love and truth.\n\nWe began to talk about my aunt's losses, and I told them what I had\ntried to do that morning.\n\n\"Which was injudicious, Trot,\" said my aunt, \"but well meant. You are a\ngenerous boy--I suppose I must say, young man, now--and I am proud of\nyou, my dear. So far, so good. Now, Trot and Agnes, let us look the case\nof Betsey Trotwood in the face, and see how it stands.\"\n\nI observed Agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my aunt.\nMy aunt, patting her cat, looked very attentively at Agnes.\n\n\"Betsey Trotwood,\" said my aunt, who had always kept her money matters\nto herself: \"--I don't mean your sister, Trot, my dear, but myself--had\na certain property. It don't matter how much; enough to live on. More;\nfor she had saved a little, and added to it. Betsey funded her property\nfor some time, and then, by the advice of her man of business, laid\nit out on landed security. That did very well, and returned very good\ninterest, till Betsey was paid off. I am talking of Betsey as if she\nwas a man-of-war. Well! Then, Betsey had to look about her, for a new\ninvestment. She thought she was wiser, now, than her man of business,\nwho was not such a good man of business by this time, as he used to\nbe--I am alluding to your father, Agnes--and she took it into her head\nto lay it out for herself. So she took her pigs,\" said my aunt, \"to a\nforeign market; and a very bad market it turned out to be. First, she\nlost in the mining way, and then she lost in the diving way--fishing up\ntreasure, or some such Tom Tidler nonsense,\" explained my aunt, rubbing\nher nose; \"and then she lost in the mining way again, and, last of all,\nto set the thing entirely to rights, she lost in the banking way. I\ndon't know what the Bank shares were worth for a little while,\" said my\naunt; \"cent per cent was the lowest of it, I believe; but the Bank was\nat the other end of the world, and tumbled into space, for what I know;\nanyhow, it fell to pieces, and never will and never can pay sixpence;\nand Betsey's sixpences were all there, and there's an end of them.\nLeast said, soonest mended!\"\n\nMy aunt concluded this philosophical summary, by fixing her eyes with a\nkind of triumph on Agnes, whose color was gradually returning.\n\n\"Dear Miss Trotwood, is that all the history?\" said Agnes.\n\n\"I hope it's enough, child,\" said my aunt. \"If there had been more money\nto lose, it wouldn't have been all, I dare say. Betsey would have\ncontrived to throw that after the rest, and make another chapter, I have\nlittle doubt. But, there was no more money, and there's no more story.\"\n\nAgnes had listened at first with suspended breath. Her color still came\nand went, but she breathed more freely. I thought I knew why. I thought\nshe had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to\nblame for what had happened. My aunt took her hand in hers, and laughed.\n\n\"Is that all?\" repeated my aunt. \"Why, yes, that's all, except, 'And she\nlived happy ever afterwards.' Perhaps I may add that of Betsey yet, one\nof these days. Now, Agnes, you have a wise head. So have you, Trot, in\nsome things, though I can't compliment you always;\" and here my aunt\nshook her own at me, with an energy peculiar to herself. \"What's to be\ndone? Here's the cottage, taking one time with another, will produce,\nsay seventy pounds a-year. I think we may safely put it down at that.\nWell!--That's all we've got,\" said my aunt; with whom it was an\nidiosyncrasy, as it is with some horses, to stop very short when she\nappeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while.\n\n\"Then,\" said my aunt, after a rest, \"there's Dick. He's good for a\nhundred a-year, but of course that must be expended on himself. I would\nsooner send him away, though I know I am the only person who appreciates\nhim, than have him, and not spend his money on himself. How can Trot and\nI do best, upon our means? What do you say, Agnes?\"\n\n\"_I_ say, aunt,\" I interposed, \"that I must do something!\"\n\n\"Go for a soldier, do you mean?\" returned my aunt, alarmed; \"or go to\nsea? I won't hear of it. You are to be a proctor. We're not going to\nhave any knockings on the head in _this_ family, if you please, sir.\"\n\nI was about to explain that I was not desirous of introducing that mode\nof provision into the family, when Agnes inquired if my rooms were held\nfor any long term?\n\n\"You come to the point, my dear,\" said my aunt. \"They are not to be got\nrid of, for six months at least, unless they could be underlet, and that\nI don't believe. The last man died here. Five people out of six _would_\ndie--of course--of that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat. I\nhave a little ready money; and I agree with you, the best thing we can\ndo, is, to live the term out here, and get Dick a bed-room hard by.\"\n\nI thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain,\nfrom living in a continual state of guerilla warfare with Mrs. Crupp;\nbut she disposed of that objection summarily by declaring, that, on the\nfirst demonstration of hostilities, she was prepared to astonish Mrs.\nCrupp for the whole remainder of her natural life.\n\n\"I have been thinking, Trotwood,\" said Agnes, diffidently, \"that if you\nhad time--\"\n\n\"I have a good deal of time, Agnes. I am always disengaged after four or\nfive o'clock, and I have time early in the morning. In one way and\nanother,\" said I, conscious of reddening a little as I thought of the\nhours and hours I had devoted to fagging about town, and to and fro upon\nthe Norwood Road, \"I have abundance of time.\"\n\n\"I know you would not mind,\" said Agnes, coming to me, and speaking in a\nlow voice, so full of sweet and hopeful consideration that I hear it\nnow, \"the duties of a secretary.\"\n\n\"Mind, my dear Agnes?\"\n\n\"Because,\" continued Agnes, \"Doctor Strong has acted on his intention of\nretiring, and has come to live in London; and he asked papa, I know, if\nhe could recommend him one. Don't you think he would rather have his\nfavorite old pupil near him, than anybody else?\"\n\n\"Dear Agnes!\" said I. \"What should I do without you! You are always my\ngood angel. I told you so. I never think of you in any other light.\"\n\nAgnes answered with her pleasant laugh, that one good angel (meaning\nDora) was enough; and went on to remind me that the Doctor had been\nused to occupy himself in his study, early in the morning, and in the\nevening--and that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very\nwell. I was scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my\nown bread, than with the hope of earning it under my old master; in\nshort, acting on the advice of Agnes, I sat down and wrote a letter\nto the Doctor, stating my object, and appointing to call on him next\nday at ten in the forenoon. This I addressed to Highgate--for in that\nplace, so memorable to me, he lived--and went out and posted, myself,\nwithout losing a minute.\n\nWherever Agnes was, some agreeable token of her noiseless presence\nseemed inseparable from the place. When I came back, I found my aunt's\nbirds hanging, just as they had hung so long in the parlor window of the\ncottage; and my easy chair imitating my aunt's much easier chair in its\nposition at the open window; and even the round green fan, which my aunt\nhad brought away with her, screwed on to the window-sill. I knew who had\ndone all this, by its seeming to have quietly done itself; and I should\nhave known in a moment who had arranged my neglected books in the old\norder of my school days, even if I had supposed Agnes to be miles away,\ninstead of seeing her busy with them, and smiling at the disorder into\nwhich they had fallen.\n\nMy aunt was quite gracious on the subject of the Thames (it really did\nlook very well with the sun upon it, though not like the sea before the\ncottage), but she could not relent towards the London smoke, which, she\nsaid, \"peppered everything.\" A complete revolution, in which Peggotty\nbore a prominent part, was being effected in every corner of my rooms,\nin regard of this pepper; and I was looking on, thinking how little even\nPeggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle, and how much Agnes did\nwithout any bustle at all, when a knock came at the door.\n\n\"I think,\" said Agnes, turning pale, \"it's papa. He promised me that he\nwould come.\"\n\nI opened the door, and admitted, not only Mr. Wickfield, but Uriah Heep.\nI had not seen Mr. Wickfield for some time. I was prepared for a great\nchange in him, after what I had heard from Agnes, but his appearance\nshocked me.\n\n  [Illustration: Mr. Wickfield and his partner wait upon my Aunt.]\n\nIt was not that he looked many years older, though still dressed with\nthe old scrupulous cleanliness; or that there was an unwholesome\nruddiness upon his face; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot; or\nthat there was a nervous trembling in his hand, the cause of which I\nknew, and had for some years seen at work. It was not that he had lost\nhis good looks, or his old bearing of a gentleman--for that he had\nnot--but the thing that struck me most, was, that with the evidences\nof his native superiority still upon him, he should submit himself to\nthat crawling impersonation of meanness, Uriah Heep. The reversal of\nthe two natures, in their relative positions, Uriah's of power and Mr.\nWickfield's of dependence, was a sight more painful to me than I can\nexpress. If I had seen an Ape taking command of a Man, I should hardly\nhave thought it a more degrading spectacle.\n\nHe appeared to be only too conscious of it himself. When he came in,\nhe stood still; and with his head bowed, as if he felt it. This was\nonly for a moment; for Agnes softly said to him, \"Papa! Here is Miss\nTrotwood--and Trotwood, whom you have not seen for a long while!\" and\nthen he approached, and constrainedly gave my aunt his hand, and shook\nhands more cordially with me. In the moment's pause I speak of, I saw\nUriah's countenance form itself into a most ill-favored smile. Agnes\nsaw it too, I think, for she shrank from him.\n\nWhat my aunt saw, or did not see, I defy the science of physiognomy to\nhave made out, without her own consent. I believe there never was\nanybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose. Her face\nmight have been a dead wall on the occasion in question, for any light\nit threw upon her thoughts; until she broke silence with her usual\nabruptness.\n\n\"Well, Wickfield!\" said my aunt; and he looked up at her for the first\ntime. \"I have been telling your daughter how well I have been disposing\nof my money for myself, because I couldn't trust it to you, as you were\ngrowing rusty in business matters. We have been taking counsel together,\nand getting on very well, all things considered. Agnes is worth the\nwhole firm, in my opinion.\"\n\n\"If I may umbly make the remark,\" said Uriah Heep, with a writhe, \"I\nfully agree with Miss Betsey Trotwood, and should be only too appy if\nMiss Agnes was a partner.\"\n\n\"You're a partner yourself, you know,\" returned my aunt, \"and that's\nabout enough for you, I expect. How do you find yourself, sir?\"\n\nIn acknowledgment of this question, addressed to him with extraordinary\ncurtness, Mr. Heep, uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried,\nreplied that he was pretty well, he thanked my aunt, and hoped she was\nthe same.\n\n\"And you, Master--I should say, Mister Copperfield,\" pursued Uriah. \"I\nhope I see you well! I am rejoiced to see you, Mister Copperfield, even\nunder present circumstances.\" I believed that; for he seemed to relish\nthem very much. \"Present circumstances is not what your friends would\nwish for you, Mister Copperfield, but it isn't money makes the man:\nit's--I am really unequal with my umble powers to express what it is,\"\nsaid Uriah, with a fawning jerk, \"but it isn't money!\"\n\nHere he shook hands with me: not in the common way, but standing at a\ngood distance from me, and lifting my hand up and down like a pump\nhandle, that he was a little afraid of.\n\n\"And how do you think we are looking, Master Copperfield,--I should say,\nMister?\" fawned Uriah. \"Don't you find Mr. Wickfield blooming, sir?\nYears don't tell much in our firm, Master Copperfield, except in raising\nup the umble, namely, mother and self--and in developing,\" he added as\nan after-thought, \"the beautiful, namely Miss Agnes.\"\n\nHe jerked himself about, after this compliment, in such an intolerable\nmanner, that my aunt, who had sat looking straight at him, lost all\npatience.\n\n\"Deuce take the man!\" said my aunt, sternly, \"what's he about? Don't be\ngalvanic, sir!\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon, Miss Trotwood,\" returned Uriah; \"I'm aware you're\nnervous.\"\n\n\"Go along with you, sir!\" said my aunt, anything but appeased. \"Don't\npresume to say so! I am nothing of the sort. If you're an eel, sir,\nconduct yourself like one. If you're a man, control your limbs, sir!\nGood God!\" said my aunt, with great indignation, \"I am not going to be\nserpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses!\"\n\nMr. Heep was rather abashed, as most people might have been, by this\nexplosion; which derived great additional force from the indignant\nmanner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair, and shook her\nhead as if she were making snaps or bounces at him. But, he said to me\naside in a meek voice:\n\n\"I am well aware, Master Copperfield, that Miss Trotwood, though an\nexcellent lady, has a quick temper (indeed I think I had the pleasure of\nknowing her, when I was a numble clerk, before you did, Master\nCopperfield), and it's only natural, I am sure, that it should be made\nquicker by present circumstances. The wonder is, that it isn't much\nworse! I only called to say that if there was anything we could do, in\npresent circumstances, mother or self, or Wickfield and Heep, we should\nbe really glad. I may go so far?\" said Uriah, with a sickly smile at his\npartner.\n\n\"Uriah Heep,\" said Mr. Wickfield, in a monotonous forced way, \"is active\nin the business, Trotwood. What he says, I quite concur in. You know I\nhad an old interest in you. Apart from that, what Uriah says I quite\nconcur in!\"\n\n\"Oh, what a reward it is,\" said Uriah, drawing up one leg, at the risk\nof bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt, \"to be so\ntrusted in! But I hope I am able to do something to relieve him from the\nfatigues of business, Master Copperfield!\"\n\n\"Uriah Heep is a great relief to me,\" said Mr. Wickfield, in the same\ndull voice. \"It's a load off my mind, Trotwood, to have such a partner.\"\n\nThe red fox made him say all this, I knew, to exhibit him to me in the\nlight he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest. I saw the\nsame ill-favored smile upon his face again, and saw how he watched me.\n\n\"You are not going, papa?\" said Agnes, anxiously. \"Will you not walk\nback with Trotwood and me?\"\n\nHe would have looked to Uriah, I believe, before replying, if that\nworthy had not anticipated him.\n\n\"I am bespoke myself,\" said Uriah, \"on business; otherwise I should have\nbeen appy to have kept with my friends. But I leave my partner to\nrepresent the firm. Miss Agnes, ever yours! I wish you good-day, Master\nCopperfield, and leave my umble respects for Miss Betsey Trotwood.\"\n\nWith those words, he retired, kissing his great hand, and leering at us\nlike a mask.\n\nWe sat there, talking about our pleasant old Canterbury days, an hour or\ntwo. Mr. Wickfield, left to Agnes, soon became more like his former\nself; though there was a settled depression upon him, which he never\nshook off. For all that, he brightened; and had an evident pleasure in\nhearing us recall the little incidents of our old life, many of which he\nremembered very well. He said it was like those times, to be alone with\nAgnes and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed. I am\nsure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes, and in the very\ntouch of her hand upon his arm, that did wonders for him.\n\nMy aunt (who was busy nearly all this while with Peggotty, in the inner\nroom) would not accompany us to the place where they were staying, but\ninsisted on my going; and I went. We dined together. After dinner, Agnes\nsat beside him, as of old, and poured out his wine. He took what she\ngave him, and no more--like a child--and we all three sat together at a\nwindow as the evening gathered in. When it was almost dark, he lay down\non a sofa, Agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little while;\nand when she came back to the window, it was not so dark but I could see\ntears glittering in her eyes.\n\nI pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and\ntruth, at that time of my life; for if I should, I must be drawing near\nthe end, and then I would desire to remember her best! She filled my\nheart with such good resolutions, strengthened my weakness so, by her\nexample, so directed--I know not how, she was too modest and gentle to\nadvise me in many words--the wandering ardor and unsettled purpose\nwithin me, that all the little good I have done, and all the harm I have\nforborne, I solemnly believe I may refer to her.\n\nAnd how she spoke to me of Dora, sitting at the window in the dark;\nlistened to my praises of her; praised again; and round the little\nfairy-figure shed some glimpses of her own pure light, that made it yet\nmore precious and more innocent to me! Oh, Agnes, sister of my boyhood,\nif I had known then, what I knew long afterwards!--\n\nThere was a beggar in the street, when I went down; and as I turned my\nhead towards the window, thinking of her calm, seraphic eyes, he made me\nstart by muttering, as if he were an echo of the morning:\n\n\"Blind! Blind! Blind!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nENTHUSIASM.\n\n\nI began the next day with another dive into the Roman bath, and then\nstarted for Highgate. I was not dispirited now. I was not afraid of the\nshabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys. My whole manner\nof thinking of our late misfortune was changed. What I had to do, was,\nto show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on\nan insensible, ungrateful object. What I had to do, was, to turn the\npainful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with\na resolute and steady heart. What I had to do, was, to take my woodman's\naxe in my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty,\nby cutting down the trees until I came to Dora. And I went on at a\nmighty rate, as if it could be done by walking.\n\nWhen I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such a\ndifferent errand from that old one of pleasure, with which it was\nassociated, it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life.\nBut that did not discourage me. With the new life, came new purpose, new\nintention. Great was the labor; priceless the reward. Dora was the\nreward, and Dora must be won.\n\nI got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a\nlittle shabby already. I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the\nforest of difficulty, under circumstances that should prove my strength.\nI had a good mind to ask an old man, in wire spectacles, who was\nbreaking stones upon the road, to lend me his hammer for a little while,\nand let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite. I stimulated\nmyself into such a heat, and got so out of breath, that I felt as if I\nhad been earning I don't know how much. In this state, I went into a\ncottage that I saw was to let, and examined it narrowly,--for I felt it\nnecessary to be practical. It would do for me and Dora admirably: with a\nlittle front garden for Jip to run about in, and bark at the\ntradespeople through the railings, and a capital room up-stairs for my\naunt. I came out again, hotter and faster than ever, and dashed up to\nHighgate, at such a rate that I was there an hour too early; and, though\nI had not been, should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself,\nbefore I was at all presentable.\n\nMy first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of\npreparation, was to find the Doctor's house. It was not in that part of\nHighgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived, but quite on the opposite side of\nthe little town. When I had made this discovery, I went back, in an\nattraction I could not resist, to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth's, and\nlooked over the corner of the garden wall. His room was shut up close.\nThe conservatory doors were standing open, and Rosa Dartle was walking,\nbareheaded, with a quick, impetuous step, up and down a gravel walk on\none side of the lawn. She gave me the idea of some fierce thing, that\nwas dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track, and\nwearing its heart out.\n\nI came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding that part\nof the neighbourhood, and wishing I had not gone near it, strolled about\nuntil it was ten o'clock. The church with the slender spire, that stands\non the top of the hill now, was not there then to tell me the time. An\nold red-brick mansion, used as a school, was in its place; and a fine\nold house it must have been to go to school at, as I recollect it.\n\nWhen I approached the Doctor's cottage--a pretty old place, on which he\nseemed to have expended some money, if I might judge from the\nembellishments and repairs that had the look of being just completed--I\nsaw him walking in the garden at the side, gaiters and all, as if he had\nnever left off walking since the days of my pupilage. He had his old\ncompanions about him, too; for there were plenty of high trees in the\nneighbourhood, and two or three rooks were on the grass, looking after\nhim, as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks,\nand were observing him closely in consequence.\n\nKnowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that\ndistance, I made bold to open the gate, and walk after him, so as to\nmeet him when he should turn round. When he did, and came towards me, he\nlooked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, evidently without thinking\nabout me at all; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary\npleasure, and he took me by both hands.\n\n\"Why, my dear Copperfield,\" said the Doctor; \"you are a man! How do you\ndo? I am delighted to see you. My dear Copperfield, how very much you\nhave improved! You are quite--yes--dear me!\"\n\nI hoped he was well, and Mrs. Strong too.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes!\" said the Doctor; \"Annie's quite well, and she'll be\ndelighted to see you. You were always her favorite. She said so, last\nnight, when I showed her your letter. And--yes to be sure--you recollect\nMr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Doctor. \"To be sure. _He's_ pretty well, too.\"\n\n\"Has he come home, sir?\" I inquired.\n\n\"From India?\" said the Doctor. \"Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon couldn't bear the\nclimate, my dear. Mrs. Markleham--you have not forgotten Mrs.\nMarkleham?\"\n\nForgotten the Old Soldier! And in that short time!\n\n\"Mrs. Markleham,\" said the Doctor, \"was quite vexed about him, poor\nthing; so we have got him at home again; and we have bought him a little\nPatent place, which agrees with him much better.\"\n\nI knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that it\nwas a place where there was not much to do, and which was pretty well\npaid. The Doctor, walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder, and\nhis kind face turned encouragingly to mine, went on:\n\n\"Now, my dear Copperfield, in reference to this proposal of yours. It's\nvery gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but don't you think you\ncould do better? You achieved distinction, you know, when you were with\nus. You are qualified for many good things. You have laid a foundation\nthat any edifice may be raised upon; and is it not a pity that you\nshould devote the spring-time of your life to such a poor pursuit as I\ncan offer?\"\n\nI became very glowing again, and, expressing myself in a rhapsodical\nstyle, I am afraid, urged my request strongly; reminding the Doctor that\nI had already a profession.\n\n\"Well, well,\" returned the Doctor, \"that's true. Certainly, your having\na profession, and being actually engaged in studying it, makes a\ndifference. But, my good young friend, what's seventy pounds a-year?\"\n\n\"It doubles our income, Doctor Strong,\" said I.\n\n\"Dear me!\" replied the Doctor. \"To think of that! Not that I mean to say\nit's rigidly limited to seventy pounds a-year, because I have always\ncontemplated making any young friend I might thus employ, a present too.\nUndoubtedly,\" said the Doctor, still walking me up and down with his\nhand on my shoulder, \"I have always taken an annual present into\naccount.\"\n\n\"My dear tutor,\" said I (now, really, without any nonsense), \"to whom I\nowe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" interposed the Doctor. \"Pardon me!\"\n\n\"If you will take such time as I have, and that is my mornings and\nevenings, and can think it worth seventy pounds a-year, you will do me\nsuch a service as I cannot express.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the Doctor, innocently. \"To think that so little should\ngo for so much! Dear, dear! And when you can do better, you will? On\nyour word, now?\" said the Doctor,--which he had always made a very grave\nappeal to the honor of us boys.\n\n\"On my word, sir!\" I returned, answering in our old school manner.\n\n\"Then be it so!\" said the Doctor, clapping me on the shoulder, and still\nkeeping his hand there, as we still walked up and down.\n\n\"And I shall be twenty times happier, sir,\" said I, with a little--I\nhope innocent--flattery, \"if my employment is to be on the Dictionary.\"\n\nThe Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again, and\nexclaimed, with a triumph most delightful to behold, as if I had\npenetrated to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity, \"My dear young\nfriend, you have hit it. It IS the Dictionary!\"\n\nHow could it be anything else! His pockets were as full of it as his\nhead. It was sticking out of him in all directions. He told me that\nsince his retirement from scholastic life, he had been advancing with it\nwonderfully; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed\narrangements for morning and evening work, as it was his custom to walk\nabout in the day-time with his considering cap on. His papers were in a\nlittle confusion, in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having lately\nproffered his occasional services as an amanuensis, and not being\naccustomed to that occupation; but we should soon put right what was\namiss, and go on swimmingly. Afterwards, when we were fairly at our\nwork, I found Mr. Jack Maldon's efforts more troublesome to me than I\nhad expected, as he had not confined himself to making numerous\nmistakes, but had sketched so many soldiers, and ladies' heads, over the\nDoctor's manuscript, that I often became involved in labyrinths of\nobscurity.\n\nThe Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together\non that wonderful performance, and we settled to begin next morning at\nseven o'clock. We were to work two hours every morning, and two or three\nhours every night, except on Saturdays, when I was to rest. On Sundays,\nof course, I was to rest also, and I considered these very easy terms.\n\nOur plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the Doctor\ntook me into the house to present me to Mrs. Strong, whom we found in\nthe Doctor's new study, dusting his books,--a freedom which he never\npermitted anybody else to take with those sacred favorites.\n\nThey had postponed their breakfast on my account, and we sat down to\ntable together. We had not been seated long, when I saw an approaching\narrival in Mrs. Strong's face, before I heard any sound of it. A\ngentleman on horseback came to the gate, and, leading his horse into the\nlittle court, with the bridle over his arm, as if he were quite at home,\ntied him to a ring in the empty coach-house wall, and came into the\nbreakfast parlor, whip in hand. It was Mr. Jack Maldon; and Mr. Jack\nMaldon was not at all improved by India, I thought. I was in a state of\nferocious virtue, however, as to young men who were not cutting down the\ntrees in the forest of difficulty; and my impression must be received\nwith due allowance.\n\n\"Mr. Jack!\" said the Doctor, \"Copperfield!\"\n\nMr. Jack Maldon shook hands with me; but not very warmly, I believed;\nand with an air of languid patronage, at which I secretly took great\numbrage. But his languor altogether was quite a wonderful sight; except\nwhen he addressed himself to his cousin Annie.\n\n\"Have you breakfasted this morning, Mr. Jack?\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"I hardly ever take breakfast, sir,\" he replied, with his head thrown\nback in an easy chair. \"I find it bores me.\"\n\n\"Is there any news to-day?\" inquired the Doctor.\n\n\"Nothing at all, sir,\" replied Mr. Maldon. \"There's an account about the\npeople being hungry and discontented down in the North, but they are\nalways being hungry and discontented somewhere.\"\n\nThe Doctor looked grave, and said, as though he wished to change the\nsubject, \"Then there's no news at all; and no news, they say, is good\nnews.\"\n\n\"There's a long statement in the papers, sir, about a murder,\" observed\nMr. Maldon. \"But somebody is always being murdered, and I didn't read\nit.\"\n\nA display of indifference to all the actions and passions of mankind was\nnot supposed to be such a distinguished quality at that time, I think,\nas I have observed it to be considered since. I have known it very\nfashionable indeed. I have seen it displayed with such success, that I\nhave encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have\nbeen born caterpillars. Perhaps it impressed me the more then, because\nit was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of,\nor to strengthen my confidence in, Mr. Jack Maldon.\n\n\"I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the opera\nto-night,\" said Mr. Maldon, turning to her. \"It's the last good night\nthere will be, this season; and there's a singer there, whom she really\nought to hear. She is perfectly exquisite. Besides which, she is so\ncharmingly ugly,\" relapsing into languor.\n\nThe Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife,\nturned to her and said:\n\n\"You must go, Annie. You must go.\"\n\n\"I would rather not,\" she said to the Doctor. \"I prefer to remain at\nhome. I would much rather remain at home.\"\n\nWithout looking at her cousin, she then addressed me, and asked me about\nAgnes, and whether she should see her, and whether she was not likely to\ncome that day; and was so much disturbed, that I wondered how even the\nDoctor, buttering his toast, could be blind to what was so obvious.\n\nBut he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, that she was young and\nought to be amused and entertained, and must not allow herself to be\nmade dull by a dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, he wanted to hear her\nsing all the new singer's songs to him; and how could she do that well,\nunless she went? So the Doctor persisted in making the engagement for\nher, and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come back to dinner. This concluded, he\nwent to his Patent place, I suppose; but at all events went away on his\nhorse, looking very idle.\n\nI was curious to find out next morning, whether she had been. She had\nnot, but had sent into London to put her cousin off; and had gone out in\nthe afternoon to see Agnes, and had prevailed upon the Doctor to go with\nher; and they had walked home by the fields, the Doctor told me, the\nevening being delightful. I wondered then, whether she would have gone\nif Agnes had not been in town, and whether Agnes had some good influence\nover her too!\n\nShe did not look very happy, I thought; but it was a good face, or a\nvery false one. I often glanced at it, for she sat in the window all the\ntime we were at work; and made our breakfast, which we took by snatches\nas we were employed. When I left, at nine o'clock, she was kneeling on\nthe ground at the Doctor's feet, putting on his shoes and gaiters for\nhim. There was a softened shade upon her face, thrown from some green\nleaves overhanging the open window of the low room; and I thought all\nthe way to Doctors' Commons, of the night when I had seen it looking at\nhim as he read.\n\nI was pretty busy now; up at five in the morning, and home at nine or\nten at night. But I had infinite satisfaction in being so closely\nengaged, and never walked slowly on any account, and felt\nenthusiastically that the more I tired myself, the more I was doing to\ndeserve Dora. I had not revealed myself in my altered character to Dora\nyet, because she was coming to see Miss Mills in a few days, and I\ndeferred all I had to tell her until then; merely informing her in my\nletters (all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss\nMills), that I had much to tell her. In the meantime, I put myself on a\nshort allowance of bear's grease, wholly abandoned scented soap and\nlavender water, and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice,\nas being too luxurious for my stern career.\n\nNot satisfied with all these proceedings, but burning with impatience to\ndo something more, I went to see Traddles, now lodging up behind the\nparapet of a house in Castle Street, Holborn. Mr. Dick, who had been\nwith me to Highgate twice already, and had resumed his companionship\nwith the Doctor, I took with me.\n\nI took Mr. Dick with me, because, acutely sensitive to my aunt's\nreverses, and sincerely believing that no galley-slave or convict worked\nas I did, he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits and\nappetite, as having nothing useful to do. In this condition, he felt\nmore incapable of finishing the Memorial than ever; and the harder he\nworked at it, the oftener that unlucky head of King Charles the First\ngot into it. Seriously apprehending that his malady would increase,\nunless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe\nthat he was useful, or unless we could put him in the way of being\nreally useful (which would be better), I made up my mind to try if\nTraddles could help us. Before we went, I wrote Traddles a full\nstatement of all that had happened, and Traddles wrote me back a capital\nanswer, expressive of his sympathy and friendship.\n\nWe found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers, refreshed by the\nsight of the flowerpot-stand and the little round table in a corner of\nthe small apartment. He received us cordially, and made friends with Mr.\nDick in a moment. Mr. Dick professed an absolute certainty of having\nseen him before, and we both said, \"Very likely.\"\n\nThe first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this.--I had\nheard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by\nreporting the debates in Parliament. Traddles having mentioned\nnewspapers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two things\ntogether, and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I\ncould qualify myself for this pursuit. Traddles now informed me, as the\nresult of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary,\nexcept in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, that is to say, a\nperfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and\nreading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages;\nand that it might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the\ncourse of a few years. Traddles reasonably supposed that this would\nsettle the business; but I, only feeling that here indeed were a few\ntall trees to be hewn down, immediately resolved to work my way on to\nDora through this thicket, axe in hand.\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, my dear Traddles!\" said I. \"I'll begin\nto-morrow.\"\n\nTraddles looked astonished, as he well might; but he had no notion as\nyet of my rapturous condition.\n\n\"I'll buy a book,\" said I, \"with a good scheme of this art in it; I'll\nwork at it at the Commons, where I haven't half enough to do; I'll take\ndown the speeches in our court for practice--Traddles, my dear fellow,\nI'll master it!\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Traddles, opening his eyes, \"I had no idea you were such\na determined character, Copperfield!\"\n\nI don't know how he should have had, for it was new enough to me. I\npassed that off, and brought Mr. Dick on the carpet.\n\n\"You see,\" said Mr. Dick, wistfully, \"if I could exert myself, Mr.\nTraddles--if I could beat a drum--or blow anything!\"\n\nPoor fellow! I have little doubt he would have preferred such an\nemployment in his heart to all others. Traddles, who would not have\nsmiled for the world, replied composedly:\n\n\"But you are a very good penman, sir. You told me so, Copperfield?\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said I. And indeed he was. He wrote with extraordinary\nneatness.\n\n\"Don't you think,\" said Traddles, \"you could copy writings, sir, if I\ngot them for you?\"\n\nMr. Dick looked doubtfully at me. \"Eh, Trotwood?\"\n\nI shook my head. Mr. Dick shook his, and sighed. \"Tell him about the\nMemorial,\" said Mr. Dick.\n\nI explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King\nCharles the First out of Mr. Dick's manuscripts; Mr. Dick in the\nmeanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles, and\nsucking his thumb.\n\n\"But these writings, you know, that I speak of, are already drawn up and\nfinished,\" said Traddles after a little consideration. \"Mr. Dick has\nnothing to do with them. Wouldn't that make a difference, Copperfield?\nAt all events wouldn't it be well to try?\"\n\nThis gave us new hope. Traddles and I laying our heads together apart,\nwhile Mr. Dick anxiously watched us from his chair, we concocted a\nscheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day, with triumphant\nsuccess.\n\nOn a table by the window in Buckingham Street, we set out the work\nTraddles procured for him--which was to make, I forget how many copies\nof a legal document about some right of way--and on another table we\nspread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial. Our\ninstructions to Mr. Dick were that he should copy exactly what he had\nbefore him, without the least departure from the original; and that when\nhe felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the\nFirst, he should fly to the Memorial. We exhorted him to be resolute in\nthis, and left my aunt to observe him. My aunt reported to us,\nafterwards, that, at first, he was like a man playing the kettle-drums,\nand constantly divided his attentions between the two; but that, finding\nthis confuse and fatigue him, and having his copy there, plainly before\nhis eyes, he soon sat at it in an orderly business-like manner, and\npostponed the Memorial to a more convenient time. In a word, although we\ntook great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him,\nand although he did not begin with the beginning of a week, he earned by\nthe following Saturday night ten shillings and nine pence; and never,\nwhile I live, shall I forget his going about to all the shops in the\nneighbourhood to change this treasure into sixpences, or his bringing\nthem to my aunt arranged in the form of a heart upon a waiter, with\ntears of joy and pride in his eyes. He was like one under the propitious\ninfluence of a charm, from the moment of his being usefully employed;\nand if there were a happy man in the world, that Saturday night, it was\nthe grateful creature who thought my aunt the most wonderful woman in\nexistence, and me the most wonderful young man.\n\n\"No starving now, Trotwood,\" said Mr. Dick, shaking hands with me in a\ncorner. \"I'll provide for her, sir!\" and he flourished his ten fingers\nin the air, as if they were ten banks.\n\nI hardly know which was the better pleased, Traddles or I. \"It really,\"\nsaid Traddles, suddenly, taking a letter out of his pocket, and giving\nit to me, \"put Mr. Micawber quite out of my head!\"\n\nThe letter (Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of\nwriting a letter) was addressed to me, \"By the kindness of T. Traddles,\nEsquire, of the Inner Temple.\" It ran thus:--\n\n     \"MY DEAR COPPERFIELD,\n\n     \"You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that\n     something has turned up. I may have mentioned to you on a former\n     occasion that I was in expectation of such an event.\n\n     \"I am about to establish myself in one of the provincial towns of\n     our favored island, (where the society may be described as a happy\n     admixture of the agricultural and the clerical), in immediate\n     connexion with one of the learned professions. Mrs. Micawber and\n     our offspring will accompany me. Our ashes, at a future period,\n     will probably be found commingled in the cemetery attached to a\n     venerable pile, for which the spot to which I refer, has acquired\n     a reputation, shall I say from China to Peru?\n\n     \"In bidding adieu to the modern Babylon, where we have undergone\n     many vicissitudes, I trust not ignobly, Mrs. Micawber and myself\n     cannot disguise from our minds that we part, it may be for years\n     and it may be for ever, with an individual linked by strong\n     associations to the altar of our domestic life. If, on the eve of\n     such a departure, you will accompany our mutual friend, Mr. Thomas\n     Traddles, to our present abode, and there reciprocate the wishes\n     natural to the occasion, you will confer a Boon\n\n                           \"On\n                             \"One\n                               \"Who\n                                 \"Is\n                                    \"Ever yours,\n                                                \"WILKINS MICAWBER.\"\n\nI was glad to find that Mr. Micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes,\nand that something really had turned up at last. Learning from Traddles\nthat the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away, I\nexpressed my readiness to do honor to it; and we went off together to\nthe lodging which Mr. Micawber occupied as Mr. Mortimer, and which was\nsituated near the top of the Gray's Inn Road.\n\nThe resources of this lodging were so limited, that we found the twins,\nnow some eight or nine years old, reposing in a turn-up bedstead\nin the family sitting-room, where Mr. Micawber had prepared, in a\nwash-hand-stand jug, what he called \"a Brew\" of the agreeable beverage\nfor which he was famous. I had the pleasure, on this occasion, of\nrenewing the acquaintance of Master Micawber, whom I found a promising\nboy of about twelve or thirteen, very subject to that restlessness of\nlimb which is not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths of his age. I also\nbecame once more known to his sister, Miss Micawber, in whom, as Mr.\nMicawber told us, \"her mother renewed her youth, like the Phoenix.\"\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"yourself and Mr. Traddles\nfind us on the brink of migration, and will excuse any little\ndiscomforts incidental to that position.\"\n\nGlancing round as I made a suitable reply, I observed that the family\neffects were already packed, and that the amount of luggage was by no\nmeans overwhelming. I congratulated Mrs. Micawber on the approaching\nchange.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"of your friendly\ninterest in all our affairs, I am well assured. My family may consider\nit banishment, if they please; but I am a wife and mother, and I never\nwill desert Mr. Micawber.\"\n\nTraddles, appealed to, by Mrs. Micawber's eye, feelingly acquiesced.\n\n\"That,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"that, at least, is my view, my dear Mr.\nCopperfield and Mr. Traddles, of the obligation which I took upon myself\nwhen I repeated the irrevocable words, 'I, Emma, take thee, Wilkins.' I\nread the service over with a flat-candle on the previous night, and the\nconclusion I derived from it was, that I never could desert Mr.\nMicawber. And,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"though it is possible I may be\nmistaken in my view of the ceremony, I never will!\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber, a little impatiently, \"I am not conscious\nthat you are expected to do any thing of the sort.\"\n\n\"I am aware, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\" pursued Mrs. Micawber, \"that I am\nnow about to cast my lot among strangers; and I am also aware that the\nvarious members of my family, to whom Mr. Micawber has written in the\nmost gentlemanly terms, announcing that fact, have not taken the least\nnotice of Mr. Micawber's communication. Indeed I may be superstitious,\"\nsaid Mrs. Micawber, \"but it appears to me that Mr. Micawber is destined\nnever to receive any answers whatever to the great majority of the\ncommunications he writes. I may augur, from the silence of my family,\nthat they object to the resolution I have taken; but I should not allow\nmyself to be swerved from the path of duty, Mr. Copperfield, even by my\npapa and mama, were they still living.\"\n\nI expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction.\n\n\"It may be a sacrifice,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"to immure one's-self in a\nCathedral town; but surely, Mr. Copperfield, if it is a sacrifice in me,\nit is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr. Micawber's abilities.\"\n\n\"Oh! You are going to a Cathedral town?\" said I.\n\nMr. Micawber, who had been helping us all, out of the wash-hand-stand\njug, replied:\n\n\"To Canterbury. In fact, my dear Copperfield, I have entered into\narrangements, by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted to our\nfriend Heep, to assist and serve him in the capacity of--and to be--his\nconfidential clerk.\"\n\nI stared at Mr. Micawber, who greatly enjoyed my surprise.\n\n\"I am bound to state to you,\" he said, with an official air, \"that the\nbusiness habits, and the prudent suggestions, of Mrs. Micawber, have in\na great measure conduced to this result. The gauntlet, to which Mrs.\nMicawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the form\nof an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a mutual\nrecognition. Of my friend Heep,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"who is a man of\nremarkable shrewdness, I desire to speak with all possible respect. My\nfriend Heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a\nfigure, but he has made a great deal, in the way of extrication from the\npressure of pecuniary difficulties, contingent on the value of my\nservices; and on the value of those services I pin my faith. Such\naddress and intelligence as I chance to possess,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nboastfully disparaging himself, with the old genteel air, \"will be\ndevoted to my friend Heep's service. I have already some acquaintance\nwith the law--as a defendant on civil process--and I shall immediately\napply myself to the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and\nremarkable of our English Jurists. I believe it is unnecessary to add\nthat I allude to Mr. Justice Blackstone.\"\n\nThese observations, and indeed the greater part of the observations made\nthat evening, were interrupted by Mrs. Micawber's discovering that\nMaster Micawber was sitting on his boots, or holding his head on with\nboth arms as if he felt it loose, or accidentally kicking Traddles under\nthe table, or shuffling his feet over one another, or producing them at\ndistances from himself apparently outrageous to nature, or lying\nsideways with his hair among the wine-glasses, or developing his\nrestlessness of limb in some other form incompatible with the general\ninterests of society; and by Master Micawber's receiving those\ndiscoveries in a resentful spirit. I sat all the while, amazed by Mr.\nMicawber's disclosure, and wondering what it meant; until Mrs. Micawber\nresumed the thread of the discourse, and claimed my attention.\n\n\"What I particularly request Mr. Micawber to be careful of, is,\" said\nMrs. Micawber, \"that he does not, my dear Mr. Copperfield, in applying\nhimself to this subordinate branch of the law, place it out of his power\nto rise, ultimately, to the top of the tree. I am convinced that Mr.\nMicawber, giving his mind to a profession so adapted to his fertile\nresources, and his flow of language, _must_ distinguish himself. Now,\nfor example, Mr. Traddles,\" said Mrs. Micawber, assuming a profound air,\n\"a Judge, or even say a Chancellor. Does an individual place himself\nbeyond the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as\nMr. Micawber has accepted?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" observed Mr. Micawber--but glancing inquisitively at\nTraddles, too; \"we have time enough before us, for the consideration of\nthose questions.\"\n\n\"Micawber,\" she returned, \"no! Your mistake in life is, that you do not\nlook forward far enough. You are bound, in justice to your family, if\nnot to yourself, to take in at a comprehensive glance the extremest\npoint in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you.\"\n\nMr. Micawber coughed, and drank his punch with an air of exceeding\nsatisfaction--still glancing at Traddles, as if he desired to have his\nopinion.\n\n\"Why, the plain state of the case, Mrs. Micawber,\" said Traddles, mildly\nbreaking the truth to her, \"I mean the real prosaic fact, you know--\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"my dear Mr. Traddles, I wish to be as\nprosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much importance.\"\n\n\"--Is,\" said Traddles, \"that this branch of the law, even if Mr.\nMicawber were a regular solicitor--\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" returned Mrs. Micawber. (\"Wilkins, you are squinting, and\nwill not be able to get your eyes back.\")\n\n\"--Has nothing,\" pursued Traddles, \"to do with that. Only a barrister is\neligible for such preferments; and Mr. Micawber could not be a\nbarrister, without being entered at an inn of court as a student, for\nfive years.\"\n\n\"Do I follow you?\" said Mrs. Micawber, with her most affable air of\nbusiness. \"Do I understand, my dear Mr. Traddles, that, at the\nexpiration of that period, Mr. Micawber would be eligible as a Judge or\nChancellor?\"\n\n\"He would be _eligible_,\" returned Traddles, with a strong emphasis on\nthat word.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Micawber. \"That is quite sufficient. If such is\nthe case, and Mr. Micawber forfeits no privilege by entering on these\nduties, my anxiety is set at rest. I speak,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"as a\nfemale, necessarily; but I have always been of opinion that Mr. Micawber\npossesses what I have heard my papa call, when I lived at home, the\njudicial mind; and I hope Mr. Micawber is now entering on a field where\nthat mind will develope itself, and take a commanding station.\"\n\nI quite believe that Mr. Micawber saw himself, in his judicial mind's\neye, on the woolsack. He passed his hand complacently over his bald\nhead, and said with ostentatious resignation:\n\n\"My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune. If I am\nreserved to wear a wig, I am at least prepared, externally,\" in allusion\nto his baldness, \"for that distinction. I do not,\" said Mr. Micawber,\n\"regret my hair, and I may have been deprived of it for a specific\npurpose. I cannot say. It is my intention, my dear Copperfield, to\neducate my son for the Church; I will not deny that I should be happy,\non his account, to attain to eminence.\"\n\n\"For the Church?\" said I, still pondering, betweenwhiles, on Uriah Heep.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Micawber. \"He has a remarkable head-voice, and will\ncommence as a chorister. Our residence at Canterbury, and our local\nconnexion, will, no doubt, enable him to take advantage of any vacancy\nthat may arise in the Cathedral corps.\"\n\nOn looking at Master Micawber again, I saw that he had a certain\nexpression of face, as if his voice were behind his eyebrows; where it\npresently appeared to be, on his singing us (as an alternative between\nthat and bed) \"The Wood-Pecker tapping.\" After many compliments on this\nperformance, we fell into some general conversation; and as I was too\nfull of my desperate intentions to keep my altered circumstances to\nmyself, I made them known to Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. I cannot express how\nextremely delighted they both were, by the idea of my aunt's being in\ndifficulties; and how comfortable and friendly it made them.\n\nWhen we were nearly come to the last round of the punch, I addressed\nmyself to Traddles, and reminded him that we must not separate, without\nwishing our friends health, happiness, and success in their new career.\nI begged Mr. Micawber to fill us bumpers, and proposed the toast in due\nform: shaking hands with him across the table, and kissing Mrs.\nMicawber, to commemorate that eventful occasion. Traddles imitated me in\nthe first particular, but did not consider himself a sufficiently old\nfriend to venture on the second.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, rising with one of his thumbs\nin each of his waistcoat pockets, \"the companion of my youth: if I\nmay be allowed the expression--and my esteemed friend Traddles: if I\nmay be permitted to call him so--will allow me, on the part of Mrs.\nMicawber, myself, and our offspring, to thank them in the warmest and\nmost uncompromising terms for their good wishes. It may be expected\nthat on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly\nnew existence,\" Mr. Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred\nthousand miles, \"I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such\nfriends as I see before me. But all that I have to say in this way, I\nhave said. Whatever station in society I may attain, through the medium\nof the learned profession of which I am about to become an unworthy\nmember, I shall endeavour not to disgrace, and Mrs. Micawber will be\nsafe to adorn. Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities,\ncontracted with a view to their immediate liquidation, but remaining\nunliquidated through a combination of circumstances, I have been under\nthe necessity of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts\nrecoil--I allude to spectacles--and possessing myself of a cognomen, to\nwhich I can establish no legitimate pretensions. All I have to say on\nthat score is, that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene, and the\nGod of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops. On Monday next, on\nthe arrival of the four o'clock afternoon coach at Canterbury, my foot\nwill be on my native heath--my name, Micawber!\"\n\n  [Illustration: Mr. Micawber delivers some valedictory remarks.]\n\nMr. Micawber resumed his seat on the close of these remarks, and drank\ntwo glasses of punch in grave succession. He then said with much\nsolemnity:\n\n\"One thing more I have to do, before this separation is complete, and\nthat is to perform an act of justice. My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles has,\non two several occasions, 'put his name,' if I may use a common\nexpression, to bills of exchange for my accommodation. On the first\noccasion Mr. Thomas Traddles was left--let me say, in short, in the\nlurch. The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived. The amount of\nthe first obligation,\" here Mr. Micawber carefully referred to papers,\n\"was, I believe, twenty-three, four, nine and a half; of the second,\naccording to my entry of that transaction, eighteen, six, two. These\nsums, united, make a total, if my calculation is correct, amounting to\nforty-one, ten, eleven and a half. My friend Copperfield will perhaps do\nme the favor to check that total?\"\n\nI did so and found it correct.\n\n\"To leave this metropolis,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"and my friend Mr. Thomas\nTraddles, without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this\nobligation, would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent. I have,\ntherefore, prepared for my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, and I now hold in\nmy hand, a document, which accomplishes the desired object. I beg to\nhand to my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles my I. O. U. for forty-one, ten,\neleven and a half; and I am happy to recover my moral dignity, and to\nknow that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man!\"\n\nWith this introduction (which greatly affected him), Mr. Micawber placed\nhis I. O. U. in the hands of Traddles, and said he wished him well in\nevery relation of life. I am persuaded, not only that this was quite the\nsame to Mr. Micawber as paying the money, but that Traddles himself\nhardly knew the difference until he had had time to think about it.\n\nMr. Micawber walked so erect before his fellow man, on the strength of\nthis virtuous action, that his chest looked half as broad again when he\nlighted us down stairs. We parted with great heartiness on both sides;\nand when I had seen Traddles to his own door, and was going home alone,\nI thought, among the other odd and contradictory things I mused upon,\nthat, slippery as Mr. Micawber was, I was probably indebted to some\ncompassionate recollection he retained of me as his boy-lodger, for\nnever having been asked by him for money. I certainly should not have\nhad the moral courage to refuse it; and I have no doubt he knew that (to\nhis credit be it written), quite as well as I did.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA LITTLE COLD WATER.\n\n\nMy new life had lasted for more than a week, and I was stronger than\never in those tremendous practical resolutions that I felt the crisis\nrequired. I continued to walk extremely fast, and to have a general idea\nthat I was getting on. I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as\nI possibly could, in my way of doing everything to which I applied my\nenergies. I made a perfect victim of myself. I even entertained some\nidea of putting myself on a vegetable diet, vaguely conceiving that, in\nbecoming a graminivorous animal, I should sacrifice to Dora.\n\nAs yet, little Dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness,\notherwise than as my letters darkly shadowed it forth. But, another\nSaturday came, and on that Saturday evening she was to be at Miss\nMills's; and when Mr. Mills had gone to his whist-club (telegraphed to\nme in the street, by a bird-cage in the drawing-room middle window), I\nwas to go there to tea.\n\nBy this time, we were quite settled down in Buckingham Street, where Mr.\nDick continued his copying in a state of absolute felicity. My aunt had\nobtained a signal victory over Mrs. Crupp, by paying her off, throwing\nthe first pitcher she planted on the stairs out of window, and\nprotecting in person, up and down the staircase, a supernumerary whom\nshe engaged from the outer world. These vigorous measures struck such\nterror to the breast of Mrs. Crupp, that she subsided into her own\nkitchen, under the impression that my aunt was mad. My aunt being\nsupremely indifferent to Mrs. Crupp's opinion and everybody else's, and\nrather favoring than discouraging the idea, Mrs. Crupp, of late the\nbold, became within a few days so faint-hearted, that rather than\nencounter my aunt upon the staircase, she would endeavour to hide her\nportly form behind doors--leaving visible, however, a wide margin of\nflannel petticoat--or would shrink into dark corners. This gave my aunt\nsuch unspeakable satisfaction, that I believe she took a delight in\nprowling up and down, with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her\nhead, at times when Mrs. Crupp was likely to be in the way.\n\nMy aunt, being uncommonly neat and ingenious, made so many little\nimprovements in our domestic arrangements, that I seemed to be richer\ninstead of poorer. Among the rest, she converted the pantry into a\ndressing-room for me; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my\noccupation, which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime, as a\nbedstead could. I was the object of her constant solicitude; and my poor\nmother herself could not have loved me better, or studied more how to\nmake me happy.\n\nPeggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed to\nparticipate in these labors; and, although she still retained something\nof her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt, had received so\nmany marks of encouragement and confidence, that they were the best\nfriends possible. But the time had now come (I am speaking of the\nSaturday when I was to take tea at Miss Mills's) when it was necessary\nfor her to return home, and enter on the discharge of the duties she had\nundertaken in behalf of Ham. \"So good bye, Barkis,\" said my aunt, \"and\ntake care of yourself! I am sure I never thought I could be sorry to\nlose you!\"\n\nI took Peggotty to the coach-office, and saw her off. She cried at\nparting, and confided her brother to my friendship as Ham had done. We\nhad heard nothing of him since he went away, that sunny afternoon.\n\n\"And now, my own dear Davy,\" said Peggotty, \"if, while you're a\nprentice, you should want any money to spend; or if, when you're out of\nyour time, my dear, you should want any to set you up (and you must do\none or other, or both, my darling); who has such a good right to ask\nleave to lend it you, as my sweet girl's own old stupid me!\"\n\nI was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply, but that\nif ever I borrowed money of anyone, I would borrow it of her. Next to\naccepting a large sum on the spot, I believe this gave Peggotty more\ncomfort than anything I could have done.\n\n\"And, my dear!\" whispered Peggotty, \"tell the pretty little angel that I\nshould so have liked to see her, only for a minute! And tell her that\nbefore she marries my boy, I'll come and make your house so beautiful\nfor you, if you'll let me!\"\n\nI declared that nobody else should touch it; and this gave Peggotty such\ndelight that she went away in good spirits.\n\nI fatigued myself as much as I possibly could in the Commons all day, by\na variety of devices, and at the appointed time in the evening repaired\nto Mr. Mills's street. Mr. Mills, who was a terrible fellow to fall\nasleep after dinner, had not yet gone out, and there was no birdcage in\nthe middle window.\n\nHe kept me waiting so long, that I fervently hoped the Club would fine\nhim for being late. At last he came out; and then I saw my own Dora hang\nup the birdcage, and peep into the balcony to look for me, and run in\nagain when she saw I was there, while Jip remained behind, to bark\ninjuriously at an immense butcher's dog in the street, who could have\ntaken him like a pill.\n\nDora came to the drawing-room door to meet me; and Jip came scrambling\nout, tumbling over his own growls, under the impression that I was a\nBandit; and we all three went in, as happy and loving as could be. I\nsoon carried desolation into the bosom of our joys--not that I meant to\ndo it, but that I was so full of the subject--by asking Dora, without\nthe smallest preparation, if she could love a beggar?\n\nMy pretty, little, startled Dora! Her only association with the word was\na yellow face and a nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or a wooden leg, or\na dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or something of that kind; and\nshe stared at me with the most delightful wonder.\n\n\"How can you ask me anything so foolish!\" pouted Dora. \"Love a beggar!\"\n\n\"Dora, my own dearest!\" said I. \"_I_ am a beggar!\"\n\n\"How can you be such a silly thing,\" replied Dora, slapping my hand, \"as\nto sit there, telling such stories? I'll make Jip bite you!\"\n\nHer childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me, but it\nwas necessary to be explicit, and I solemnly repeated:\n\n\"Dora, my own life, I am your ruined David!\"\n\n\"I declare I'll make Jip bite you!\" said Dora, shaking her curls, \"if\nyou are so ridiculous.\"\n\nBut I looked so serious, that Dora left off shaking her curls, and laid\nher trembling little hand upon my shoulder, and first looked scared and\nanxious, then began to cry. That was dreadful. I fell upon my knees\nbefore the sofa, caressing her, and imploring her not to rend my heart;\nbut, for some time, poor little Dora did nothing but exclaim Oh dear! oh\ndear! And oh, she was so frightened! And where was Julia Mills! And oh,\ntake her to Julia Mills, and go away, please! until I was almost beside\nmyself.\n\nAt last, after an agony of supplication and protestation, I got Dora to\nlook at me, with a horrified expression of face, which I gradually\nsoothed until it was only loving, and her soft, pretty cheek was lying\nagainst mine. Then I told her, with my arms clasped round her, how I\nloved her, so dearly, and so dearly; how I felt it right to offer to\nrelease her from her engagement, because now I was poor; how I never\ncould bear it, or recover it, if I lost her; how I had no fears of\npoverty, if she had none, my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by\nher; how I was already working with a courage such as none but lovers\nknew; how I had begun to be practical, and to look into the future; how\na crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited; and much\nmore to the same purpose, which I delivered in a burst of passionate\neloquence quite surprising to myself, though I had been thinking about\nit, day and night, ever since my aunt had astonished me.\n\n\"Is your heart mine still, dear Dora?\" said I, rapturously, for I knew\nby her clinging to me that it was.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried Dora. \"Oh, yes, it's all yours. Oh, don't be dreadful!\"\n\n_I_ dreadful! To Dora!\n\n\"Don't talk about being poor, and working hard!\" said Dora, nestling\ncloser to me. \"Oh, don't, don't!\"\n\n\"My dearest love,\" said I, \"the crust well-earned--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but I don't want to hear any more about crusts!\" said Dora.\n\"And Jip must have a mutton-chop every-day at twelve, or he'll die!\"\n\nI was charmed with her childish, winning way. I fondly explained\nto Dora that Jip should have his mutton-chop with his accustomed\nregularity. I drew a picture of our frugal home, made independent by\nmy labor--sketching-in the little house I had seen at Highgate, and my\naunt in her room up-stairs.\n\n\"I am not dreadful now, Dora?\" said I, tenderly.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" cried Dora. \"But I hope your aunt will keep in her own\nroom a good deal! And I hope she's not a scolding old thing!\"\n\nIf it were possible for me to love Dora more than ever, I am sure I did.\nBut I felt she was a little impracticable. It damped my new-born ardor,\nto find that ardor so difficult of communication to her. I made another\ntrial. When she was quite herself again, and was curling Jip's ears, as\nhe lay upon her lap, I became grave, and said:\n\n\"My own! May I mention something?\"\n\n\"Oh, please don't be practical!\" said Dora, coaxingly. \"Because it\nfrightens me so!\"\n\n\"Sweet heart!\" I returned; \"there is nothing to alarm you in all this. I\nwant you to think of it quite differently. I want to make it nerve you,\nand inspire you, Dora!\"\n\n\"Oh, but that's so shocking!\" cried Dora.\n\n\"My love, no. Perseverance and strength of character will enable us to\nbear much worse things.\"\n\n\"But I haven't got any strength at all,\" said Dora, shaking her curls.\n\"Have I, Jip? Oh, do kiss Jip, and be agreeable!\"\n\nIt was impossible to resist kissing Jip, when she held him up to me for\nthat purpose, putting her own bright, rosy little mouth into kissing\nform, as she directed the operation, which she insisted should be\nperformed symmetrically, on the centre of his nose. I did as she bade\nme--rewarding myself afterwards for my obedience--and she charmed me\nout of my graver character for I don't know how long.\n\n\"But, Dora, my beloved!\" said I, at last resuming it; \"I was going to\nmention something.\"\n\nThe Judge of the Prerogative Court might have fallen in love with her,\nto see her fold her little hands and hold them up, begging and praying\nme not to be dreadful any more.\n\n\"Indeed I am not going to be, my darling!\" I assured her. \"But, Dora, my\nlove, if you will sometimes think,--not despondingly, you know; far from\nthat!--but if you will sometimes think--just to encourage yourself--that\nyou are engaged to a poor man--\"\n\n\"Don't, don't! Pray don't!\" cried Dora. \"It's so very dreadful!\"\n\n\"My soul, not at all!\" said I, cheerfully. \"If you will sometimes think\nof that, and look about now and then at your papa's housekeeping, and\nendeavour to acquire a little habit--of accounts, for instance--\"\n\nPoor little Dora received this suggestion with something that was half a\nsob and half a scream.\n\n\"--It will be so useful to us afterwards,\" I went on. \"And if you would\npromise me to read a little--a little Cookery Book that I would send\nyou, it would be so excellent for both of us. For our path in life, my\nDora,\" said I, warming with the subject, \"is stony and rugged now, and\nit rests with us to smooth it. We must fight our way onward. We must be\nbrave. There are obstacles to be met, and we must meet, and crush them!\"\n\nI was going on at a great rate, with a clenched hand, and a most\nenthusiastic countenance; but it was quite unnecessary to proceed.\nI had said enough. I had done it again. Oh, she was so frightened!\nOh, where was Julia Mills! Oh, take her to Julia Mills, and go away,\nplease! So that, in short, I was quite distracted, and raved about the\ndrawing-room.\n\nI thought I had killed her, this time. I sprinkled water on her face.\nI went down on my knees. I plucked at my hair. I denounced myself as\na remorseless brute and a ruthless beast. I implored her forgiveness.\nI besought her to look up. I ravaged Miss Mills's work-box for a\nsmelling-bottle, and in my agony of mind applied an ivory needle-case\ninstead, and dropped all the needles over Dora. I shook my fists at\nJip, who was as frantic as myself. I did every wild extravagance that\ncould be done, and was a long way beyond the end of my wits when Miss\nMills came into the room.\n\n\"Who has done this!\" exclaimed Miss Mills, succouring her friend.\n\nI replied, \"_I_, Miss Mills! _I_ have done it! Behold the\ndestroyer!\"--or words to that effect--and hid my face from the light, in\nthe sofa cushion.\n\nAt first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel, and that we were verging\non the Desert of Sahara; but she soon found out how matters stood, for\nmy dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began exclaiming that I\nwas \"a poor laborer;\" and then cried for me, and embraced me, and asked\nme would I let her give me all her money to keep, and then fell on Miss\nMills's neck, sobbing as if her tender heart were broken.\n\nMiss Mills must have been born to be a blessing to us. She ascertained\nfrom me in a few words what it was all about, comforted Dora, and\ngradually convinced her that I was not a laborer--from my manner of\nstating the case I believe Dora concluded that I was a navigator,\nand went balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a\nwheelbarrow--and so brought us together in peace. When we were quite\ncomposed, and Dora had gone up-stairs to put some rose-water to her\neyes, Miss Mills rang for tea. In the ensuing interval, I told Miss\nMills that she was evermore my friend, and that my heart must cease to\nvibrate ere I could forget her sympathy.\n\nI then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured, so very\nunsuccessfully, to expound to Dora. Miss Mills replied, on general\nprinciples, that the Cottage of content was better than the Palace of\ncold splendour, and that where love was, all was.\n\nI said to Miss Mills that this was very true, and who should know it\nbetter than I, who loved Dora with a love that never mortal had\nexperienced yet. But on Miss Mills observing, with despondency, that it\nwere well indeed for some hearts if this were so, I explained that I\nbegged leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine\ngender.\n\nI then put it to Miss Mills, to say whether she considered that there\nwas or was not any practical merit in the suggestion I had been anxious\nto make, concerning the accounts, the housekeeping, and the Cookery\nBook?\n\nMiss Mills, after some consideration, thus replied:\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield, I will be plain with you. Mental suffering and trial\nsupply, in some natures, the place of years, and I will be as plain with\nyou as if I were a Lady Abbess. No. The suggestion is not appropriate to\nour Dora. Our dearest Dora is a favorite child of nature. She is a thing\nof light, and airiness, and joy. I am free to confess that if it could\nbe done, it might be well, but--\" And Miss Mills shook her head.\n\nI was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss Mills to\nask her, whether, for Dora's sake, if she had any opportunity of luring\nher attention to such preparations for an earnest life, she would avail\nherself of it? Miss Mills replied in the affirmative so readily, that I\nfurther asked her if she would take charge of the Cookery Book; and, if\nshe ever could insinuate it upon Dora's acceptance, without frightening\nher, undertake to do me that crowning service. Miss Mills accepted this\ntrust, too; but was not sanguine.\n\nAnd Dora returned, looking such a lovely little creature, that I really\ndoubted whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary. And\nshe loved me so much, and was so captivating (particularly when she made\nJip stand on his hind legs for toast, and when she pretended to hold\nthat nose of his against the hot tea-pot for punishment because he\nwouldn't), that I felt like a sort of Monster who had got into a Fairy's\nbower, when I thought of having frightened her, and made her cry.\n\nAfter tea we had the guitar; and Dora sang those same dear old French\nsongs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving off\ndancing, La ra la, La ra la, until I felt a much greater Monster than\nbefore.\n\nWe had only one check to our pleasure, and that happened a little while\nbefore I took my leave, when, Miss Mills chancing to make some allusion\nto to-morrow morning, I unluckily let out that being obliged to exert\nmyself now, I got up at five o'clock. Whether Dora had any idea that I\nwas a Private Watchman, I am unable to say; but it made a great\nimpression on her, and she neither played nor sang any more.\n\nIt was still on her mind when I bade her adieu; and she said to me, in\nher pretty coaxing way--as if I were a doll, I used to think!\n\n\"Now don't get up at five o'clock, you naughty boy. It's so\nnonsensical!\"\n\n\"My love,\" said I, \"I have work to do.\"\n\n\"But don't do it!\" returned Dora. \"Why should you?\"\n\nIt was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face, otherwise\nthan lightly and playfully, that we must work, to live.\n\n\"Oh! How ridiculous!\" cried Dora.\n\n\"How shall we live without, Dora?\" said I.\n\n\"How? Any how!\" said Dora.\n\nShe seemed to think she had quite settled the question, and gave me such\na triumphant little kiss, direct from her innocent heart, that I would\nhardly have put her out of conceit with her answer, for a fortune.\n\nWell! I loved her, and I went on loving her, most absorbingly, entirely,\nand completely. But going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily\nkeeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire, I would sit\nsometimes of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how I had frightened\nDora that time, and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case\nthrough the forest of difficulty, until I used to fancy that my head was\nturning quite grey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nA DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP.\n\n\nI did not allow my resolution, with respect to the Parliamentary\nDebates, to cool. It was one of the irons I began to heat immediately,\nand one of the irons I kept hot, and hammered at, with a perseverance I\nmay honestly admire. I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and\nmystery of stenography (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged\ninto a sea of perplexity that brought me, in a few weeks, to the\nconfines of distraction. The changes that were rung upon dots, which in\nsuch a position meant such a thing, and in such another position\nsomething else, entirely different; the wonderful vagaries that were\nplayed by circles; the unaccountable consequences that resulted from\nmarks like flies' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong\nplace; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before me in my\nsleep. When I had groped my way, blindly, through these difficulties,\nand had mastered the alphabet, which was an Egyptian Temple in itself,\nthere then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary\ncharacters; the most despotic characters I have ever known; who\ninsisted, for instance, that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb,\nmeant expectation, and that a pen and ink sky-rocket stood for\ndisadvantageous. When I had fixed these wretches in my mind, I found\nthat they had driven everything else out of it; then, beginning again, I\nforgot them; while I was picking them up, I dropped the other fragments\nof the system; in short, it was almost heart-breaking.\n\nIt might have been quite heart-breaking, but for Dora, who was the stay\nand anchor of my tempest-driven bark. Every scratch in the scheme was a\ngnarled oak in the forest of difficulty, and I went on cutting them\ndown, one after another, with such vigour, that in three or four months\nI was in a condition to make an experiment on one of our crack speakers\nin the Commons. Shall I ever forget how the crack speaker walked off\nfrom me before I began, and left my imbecile pencil staggering about the\npaper as if it were in a fit!\n\nThis would not do, it was quite clear. I was flying too high, and should\nnever get on, so. I resorted to Traddles for advice; who suggested that\nhe should dictate speeches to me, at a pace, and with occasional\nstoppages, adapted to my weakness. Very grateful for this friendly aid,\nI accepted the proposal; and night after night, almost every night, for\na long time, we had a sort of private Parliament in Buckingham Street,\nafter I came home from the Doctor's.\n\nI should like to see such a Parliament anywhere else! My aunt and Mr.\nDick represented the Government or the Opposition (as the case might\nbe), and Traddles, with the assistance of Enfield's Speaker or a volume\nof parliamentary orations, thundered astonishing invectives against\nthem. Standing by the table, with his finger in the page to keep the\nplace, and his right arm flourishing above his head, Traddles, as Mr.\nPitt, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord Castlereagh, Viscount\nSidmouth, or Mr. Canning, would work himself into the most violent\nheats, and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy\nand corruption of my aunt and Mr. Dick; while I used to sit, at a little\ndistance, with my note-book on my knee, fagging after him with all my\nmight and main. The inconsistency and recklessness of Traddles were not\nto be exceeded by any real politician. He was for any description of\npolicy, in the compass of a week; and nailed all sorts of colours to\nevery denomination of mast. My aunt, looking very like an immoveable\nChancellor of the Exchequer, would occasionally throw in an interruption\nor two, as \"Hear!\" or \"No!\" or \"Oh!\" when the text seemed to require it:\nwhich was always a signal to Mr. Dick (a perfect country gentleman) to\nfollow lustily with the same cry. But Mr. Dick got taxed with such\nthings in the course of his Parliamentary career, and was made\nresponsible for such awful consequences, that he became uncomfortable in\nhis mind sometimes. I believe he actually began to be afraid he really\nhad been doing something, tending to the annihilation of the British\nconstitution, and the ruin of the country.\n\n  [Illustration: Traddles makes a figure in parliament, and I report\n  him.]\n\nOften and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to\nmidnight, and the candles were burning down. The result of so much good\npractice was, that by-and-by I began to keep pace with Traddles pretty\nwell, and should have been quite triumphant if I had had the least idea\nwhat my notes were about. But, as to reading them after I had got them,\nI might as well have copied the Chinese inscriptions on an immense\ncollection of tea-chests, or the golden characters on all the great red\nand green bottles in the chemists' shops!\n\nThere was nothing for it, but to turn back and begin all over again. It\nwas very hard, but I turned back, though with a heavy heart, and began\nlaboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a\nsnail's pace; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way, on\nall sides, and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive\ncharacters by sight wherever I met them. I was always punctual at the\noffice; at the Doctor's too: and I really did work, as the common\nexpression is, like a cart-horse.\n\nOne day, when I went to the Commons as usual, I found Mr. Spenlow in the\ndoorway looking extremely grave, and talking to himself. As he was in\nthe habit of complaining of pains in his head--he had naturally a short\nthroat, and I do seriously believe he overstarched himself--I was at\nfirst alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction;\nbut he soon relieved my uneasiness.\n\nInstead of returning my \"Good morning\" with his usual affability, he\nlooked at me in a distant, ceremonious manner, and coldly requested me\nto accompany him to a certain coffee-house, which, in those days, had a\ndoor opening into the Commons, just within the little archway in St.\nPaul's churchyard. I complied, in a very uncomfortable state, and with a\nwarm shooting all over me, as if my apprehensions were breaking out into\nbuds. When I allowed him to go on a little before, on account of the\nnarrowness of the way, I observed that he carried his head with a lofty\nair that was particularly unpromising; and my mind misgave me that he\nhad found out about my darling Dora.\n\nIf I had not guessed this, on the way to the coffee-house, I could\nhardly have failed to know what was the matter when I followed him into\nan up-stairs room, and found Miss Murdstone there, supported by a\nbackground of sideboard, on which were several inverted tumblers\nsustaining lemons, and two of those extraordinary boxes, all corners and\nflutings, for sticking knives and forks in, which, happily for mankind,\nare now obsolete.\n\nMiss Murdstone gave me her chilly finger-nails, and sat severely rigid.\nMr. Spenlow shut the door, motioned me to a chair, and stood on the\nhearth-rug in front of the fireplace.\n\n\"Have the goodness to show Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mr. Spenlow, \"what you\nhave in your reticule, Miss Murdstone.\"\n\nI believe it was the old identical steel-clasped reticule of my\nchildhood, that shut up like a bite. Compressing her lips, in sympathy\nwith the snap, Miss Murdstone opened it--opening her mouth a little at\nthe same time--and produced my last letter to Dora, teeming with\nexpressions of devoted affection.\n\n\"I believe that is your writing, Mr. Copperfield?\" said Mr. Spenlow.\n\nI was very hot, and the voice I heard was very unlike mine, when I said,\n\"It is sir!\"\n\n\"If I am not mistaken,\" said Mr. Spenlow, as Miss Murdstone brought a\nparcel of letters out of her reticule, tied round with the dearest bit\nof blue ribbon, \"those are also from your pen, Mr. Copperfield?\"\n\nI took them from her with a most desolate sensation; and, glancing at\nsuch phrases at the top, as \"My ever dearest and own Dora,\" \"My best\nbeloved angel,\" \"My blessed one for ever,\" and the like, blushed deeply,\nand inclined my head.\n\n\"No, thank you!\" said Mr. Spenlow coldly, as I mechanically offered them\nback to him. \"I will not deprive you of them. Miss Murdstone, be so good\nas to proceed!\"\n\nThat gentle creature, after a moment's thoughtful survey of the carpet,\ndelivered herself with much dry unction as follows.\n\n\"I must confess to having entertained my suspicions of Miss Spenlow, in\nreference to David Copperfield, for some time. I observed Miss Spenlow\nand David Copperfield, when they first met; and the impression made upon\nme then was not agreeable. The depravity of the human heart is such----\"\n\n\"You will oblige me, ma'am,\" interrupted Mr. Spenlow, \"by confining\nyourself to facts.\"\n\nMiss Murdstone cast down her eyes, shook her head as if protesting\nagainst this unseemly interruption, and with frowning dignity resumed:\n\n\"Since I am to confine myself to facts, I will state them as dryly as I\ncan. Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding.\nI have already said, sir, that I have had my suspicions of Miss Spenlow,\nin reference to David Copperfield, for some time. I have frequently\nendeavoured to find decisive corroboration of those suspicions, but\nwithout effect. I have therefore forborne to mention them to Miss\nSpenlow's father;\" looking severely at him; \"knowing how little\ndisposition there usually is in such cases, to acknowledge the\nconscientious discharge of duty.\"\n\nMr. Spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of Miss\nMurdstone's manner, and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory\nlittle wave of his hand.\n\n\"On my return to Norwood, after the period of absence occasioned by my\nbrother's marriage,\" pursued Miss Murdstone in a disdainful voice, \"and\non the return of Miss Spenlow from her visit to her friend Miss Mills, I\nimagined that the manner of Miss Spenlow gave me greater occasion for\nsuspicion than before. Therefore I watched Miss Spenlow closely.\"\n\nDear, tender little Dora, so unconscious of this Dragon's eye!\n\n\"Still,\" resumed Miss Murdstone, \"I found no proof until last night. It\nappeared to me that Miss Spenlow received too many letters from her\nfriend Miss Mills; but Miss Mills being her friend with her father's\nfull concurrence,\" another telling blow at Mr. Spenlow, \"it was not for\nme to interfere. If I may not be permitted to allude to the natural\ndepravity of the human heart, at least I may--I must--be permitted, so\nfar to refer to misplaced confidence.\"\n\nMr. Spenlow apologetically murmured his assent.\n\n\"Last evening after tea,\" pursued Miss Murdstone, \"I observed the little\ndog starting, rolling, and growling about the drawing-room, worrying\nsomething. I said to Miss Spenlow, 'Dora, what is that the dog has in\nhis mouth? It's paper.' Miss Spenlow immediately put her hand to her\nfrock, gave a sudden cry, and ran to the dog. I interposed, and said\n'Dora my love, you must permit me.'\"\n\nOh Jip, miserable Spaniel, this wretchedness, then, was your work!\n\n\"Miss Spenlow endeavoured\" said Miss Murdstone \"to bribe me with kisses,\nwork-boxes, and small articles of jewellery--that, of course, I pass\nover. The little dog retreated under the sofa on my approaching him, and\nwas with great difficulty dislodged by the fire-irons. Even when\ndislodged, he still kept the letter in his mouth; and on my endeavouring\nto take it from him, at the imminent risk of being bitten, he kept it\nbetween his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself to be held\nsuspended in the air by means of the document. At length I obtained\npossession of it. After perusing it, I taxed Miss Spenlow with having\nmany such letters in her possession; and ultimately obtained from her,\nthe packet which is now in David Copperfield's hand.\"\n\nHere she ceased; and snapping her reticule again, and shutting her\nmouth, looked as if she might be broken, but could never be bent.\n\n\"You have heard Miss Murdstone,\" said Mr. Spenlow, turning to me. \"I beg\nto ask, Mr. Copperfield, if you have anything to say in reply?\"\n\nThe picture I had before me, of the beautiful little treasure of my\nheart, sobbing and crying all night--of her being alone, frightened,\nand wretched, then--of her having so piteously begged and prayed that\nstony-hearted woman to forgive her--of her having vainly offered her\nthose kisses, work-boxes, and trinkets--of her being in such grievous\ndistress, and all for me--very much impaired the little dignity I had\nbeen able to muster. I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a\nminute or so, though I did my best to disguise it.\n\n\"There is nothing I can say, sir,\" I returned, \"except that all the\nblame is mine. Dora--\"\n\n\"Miss Spenlow, if you please,\" said her father, majestically.\n\n\"--was induced and persuaded by me,\" I went on, swallowing that colder\ndesignation, \"to consent to this concealment, and I bitterly regret it.\"\n\n\"You are very much to blame, sir,\" said Mr. Spenlow, walking to and fro\nupon the hearth-rug, and emphasizing what he said with his whole body\ninstead of his head, on account of the stiffness of his cravat and\nspine. \"You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action, Mr. Copperfield.\nWhen I take a gentleman to my house, no matter whether he is nineteen,\ntwenty-nine, or ninety, I take him there in a spirit of confidence. If\nhe abuses my confidence, he commits a dishonourable action, Mr.\nCopperfield.\"\n\n\"I feel it, sir, I assure you,\" I returned. \"But I never thought so,\nbefore. Sincerely, honestly, indeed, Mr. Spenlow, I never thought so,\nbefore. I love Miss Spenlow to that extent--\"\n\n\"Pooh! nonsense!\" said Mr. Spenlow, reddening. \"Pray don't tell me to my\nface that you love my daughter, Mr. Copperfield!\"\n\n\"Could I defend my conduct if I did not, sir?\" I returned, with all\nhumility.\n\n\"Can you defend your conduct if you do, sir?\" said Mr. Spenlow, stopping\nshort upon the hearth-rug. \"Have you considered your years, and my\ndaughter's years, Mr. Copperfield? Have you considered what it is to\nundermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and\nmyself? Have you considered my daughter's station in life, the projects\nI may contemplate for her advancement, the testamentary intentions I may\nhave with reference to her? Have you considered anything, Mr.\nCopperfield?\"\n\n\"Very little, sir, I am afraid;\" I answered, speaking to him as\nrespectfully and sorrowfully as I felt; \"but pray believe me, I have\nconsidered my own worldly position. When I explained it to you, we were\nalready engaged--\"\n\n\"I BEG,\" said Mr. Spenlow, more like Punch than I had ever seen him, as\nhe energetically struck one hand upon the other--I could not help\nnoticing that even in my despair; \"that you will NOT talk to me of\nengagements, Mr. Copperfield!\"\n\nThe otherwise immoveable Miss Murdstone laughed contemptuously in one\nshort syllable.\n\n\"When I explained my altered position to you, sir,\" I began again,\nsubstituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to\nhim, \"this concealment, into which I am so unhappy as to have led Miss\nSpenlow, had begun. Since I have been in that altered position, I have\nstrained every nerve, I have exerted every energy, to improve it. I am\nsure I shall improve it in time. Will you grant me time--any length of\ntime? We are both so young, sir,--\"\n\n\"You are right,\" interrupted Mr. Spenlow, nodding his head a great many\ntimes, and frowning very much, \"you are both very young. It's all\nnonsense. Let there be an end of the nonsense. Take away those letters,\nand throw them in the fire. Give me Miss Spenlow's letters to throw in\nthe fire; and although our future intercourse must, you are aware, be\nrestricted to the Commons here, we will agree to make no further mention\nof the past. Come, Mr. Copperfield, you don't want sense; and this is\nthe sensible course.\"\n\nNo. I couldn't think of agreeing to it. I was very sorry, but there was\na higher consideration than sense. Love was above all earthly\nconsiderations, and I loved Dora to idolatry, and Dora loved me. I\ndidn't exactly say so; I softened it down as much as I could; but I\nimplied it, and I was resolute upon it. I don't think I made myself very\nridiculous, but I know I was resolute.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mr. Spenlow, \"I must try my influence\nwith my daughter.\"\n\nMiss Murdstone, by an expressive sound, a long drawn respiration, which\nwas neither a sigh nor a moan, but was like both, gave it as her opinion\nthat he should have done this at first.\n\n\"I must try,\" said Mr. Spenlow, confirmed by this support, \"my influence\nwith my daughter. Do you decline to take those letters, Mr.\nCopperfield?\" For I had laid them on the table.\n\nYes. I told him I hoped he would not think it wrong, but I couldn't\npossibly take them from Miss Murdstone.\n\n\"Nor from me?\" said Mr. Spenlow.\n\nNo, I replied with the profoundest respect; nor from him.\n\n\"Very well!\" said Mr. Spenlow.\n\nA silence succeeding, I was undecided whether to go or stay. At length I\nwas moving quietly towards the door, with the intention of saying that\nperhaps I should consult his feelings best by withdrawing: when he said,\nwith his hands in his coat pockets, into which it was as much as he\ncould do to get them; and with what I should call, upon the whole, a\ndecidedly pious air:\n\n\"You are probably aware, Mr. Copperfield, that I am not altogether\ndestitute of worldly possessions, and that my daughter is my nearest and\ndearest relative?\"\n\nI hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into\nwhich I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not\ninduce him to think me mercenary too?\n\n\"I don't allude to the matter in that light,\" said Mr. Spenlow. \"It\nwould be better for yourself, and all of us, if you _were_ mercenary,\nMr. Copperfield--I mean, if you were more discreet and less influenced\nby all this youthful nonsense. No. I merely say, with quite another\nview, you are probably aware I have some property to bequeath to my\nchild?\"\n\nI certainly supposed so.\n\n\"And you can hardly think,\" said Mr. Spenlow, \"having experience of what\nwe see, in the Commons here, every day, of the various unaccountable and\nnegligent proceedings of men, in respect of their testamentary\narrangements--of all subjects, the one on which perhaps the strangest\nrevelations of human inconsistency are to be met with--but that mine are\nmade?\"\n\nI inclined my head in acquiescence.\n\n\"I should not allow,\" said Mr. Spenlow, with an evident increase of\npious sentiment, and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon\nhis toes and heels alternately, \"my suitable provision for my child to\nbe influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present. It is mere\nfolly. Mere nonsense. In a little while, it will weigh lighter than any\nfeather. But I might--I might--if this silly business were not\ncompletely relinquished altogether, be induced in some anxious moment to\nguard her from, and surround her with protections against, the\nconsequences of, any foolish step in the way of marriage. Now, Mr.\nCopperfield, I hope that you will not render it necessary for me to\nopen, even for a quarter of an hour, that closed page in the book of\nlife, and unsettle, even for a quarter of an hour, grave affairs long\nsince composed.\"\n\nThere was a serenity, a tranquillity, a calm-sunset air about him, which\nquite affected me. He was so peaceful and resigned--clearly had his\naffairs in such perfect train, and so systematically wound up--that he\nwas a man to feel touched in the contemplation of. I really think I saw\ntears rise to his eyes, from the depth of his own feeling of all this.\n\nBut what could I do? I could not deny Dora and my own heart. When he\ntold me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said, how\ncould I say I wouldn't take a week, yet how could I fail to know that no\namount of weeks could influence such love as mine?\n\n\"In the meantime, confer with Miss Trotwood, or with any person with any\nknowledge of life,\" said Mr. Spenlow, adjusting his cravat with both\nhands. \"Take a week, Mr. Copperfield.\"\n\nI submitted; and, with a countenance as expressive as I was able to\nmake it of dejected and despairing constancy, came out of the room.\nMiss Murdstone's heavy eyebrows followed me to the door--I say her\neyebrows rather than her eyes, because they were much more important\nin her face--and she looked so exactly as she used to look, at about\nthat hour of the morning, in our parlour at Blunderstone, that I could\nhave fancied I had been breaking down in my lessons again, and that\nthe dead weight on my mind was that horrible old spelling-book, with\noval woodcuts, shaped, to my youthful fancy, like the glasses out of\nspectacles.\n\nWhen I got to the office, and, shutting out old Tiffey and the rest of\nthem with my hands, sat at my desk, in my own particular nook, thinking\nof this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly, and in the\nbitterness of my spirit cursing Jip, I fell into such a state of torment\nabout Dora, that I wonder I did not take up my hat and rush insanely to\nNorwood. The idea of their frightening her, and making her cry, and of\nmy not being there to comfort her, was so excruciating, that it impelled\nme to write a wild letter to Mr. Spenlow, beseeching him not to visit\nupon her the consequences of my awful destiny. I implored him to spare\nher gentle nature--not to crush a fragile flower--and addressed him\ngenerally, to the best of my remembrance, as if, instead of being her\nfather, he had been an Ogre, or the Dragon of Wantley. This letter I\nsealed and laid upon his desk before he returned; and when he came in, I\nsaw him, through the half-opened door of his room, take it up and read\nit.\n\nHe said nothing about it all the morning; but before he went away in the\nafternoon he called me in, and told me that I need not make myself at\nall uneasy about his daughter's happiness. He had assured her, he said,\nthat it was all nonsense; and he had nothing more to say to her. He\nbelieved he was an indulgent father (as indeed he was), and I might\nspare myself any solicitude on her account.\n\n\"You may make it necessary, if you are foolish or obstinate, Mr.\nCopperfield,\" he observed, \"for me to send my daughter abroad again, for\na term; but I have a better opinion of you. I hope you will be wiser\nthan that, in a few days. As to Miss Murdstone,\" for I had alluded to\nher in the letter, \"I respect that lady's vigilance, and feel obliged to\nher; but she has strict charge to avoid the subject. All I desire, Mr.\nCopperfield, is, that it should be forgotten. All you have got to do,\nMr. Copperfield, is, to forget it.\"\n\nAll! In the note I wrote to Miss Mills, I bitterly quoted this\nsentiment. All I had to do, I said, with gloomy sarcasm, was to forget\nDora. That was all, and what was that! I entreated Miss Mills to see me,\nthat evening. If it could not be done with Mr. Mills's sanction and\nconcurrence, I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen\nwhere the Mangle was. I informed her that my reason was tottering on its\nthrone, and only she, Miss Mills, could prevent its being deposed. I\nsigned myself, hers distractedly; and I couldn't help feeling, when I\nread this composition over, before sending it by a porter, that it was\nsomething in the style of Mr. Micawber.\n\nHowever, I sent it. At night I repaired to Miss Mills's street, and\nwalked up and down, until I was stealthily fetched in by Miss Mills's\nmaid, and taken the area way to the back kitchen. I have since seen\nreason to believe that there was nothing on earth to prevent my going in\nat the front door, and being shown up into the drawing-room, except Miss\nMills's love of the romantic and mysterious.\n\nIn the back kitchen, I raved as became me. I went there, I suppose, to\nmake a fool of myself, and I am quite sure I did it. Miss Mills had\nreceived a hasty note from Dora, telling her that all was discovered,\nand saying, \"Oh pray come to me, Julia, do, do!\" But Miss Mills,\nmistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers, had\nnot yet gone; and we were all benighted in the Desert of Sahara.\n\nMiss Mills had a wonderful flow of words, and liked to pour them out. I\ncould not help feeling, though she mingled her tears with mine, that she\nhad a dreadful luxury in our afflictions. She petted them, as I may say,\nand made the most of them. A deep gulf, she observed, had opened between\nDora and me, and Love could only span it with its rainbow. Love must\nsuffer in this stern world; it ever had been so, it ever would be so. No\nmatter, Miss Mills remarked. Hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at\nlast, and then Love was avenged.\n\nThis was small consolation, but Miss Mills wouldn't encourage fallacious\nhopes. She made me much more wretched than I was before, and I felt (and\ntold her with the deepest gratitude) that she was indeed a friend. We\nresolved that she should go to Dora the first thing in the morning, and\nfind some means of assuring her, either by looks or words, of my\ndevotion and misery. We parted, overwhelmed with grief; and I think Miss\nMills enjoyed herself completely.\n\nI confided all to my aunt when I got home; and in spite of all she could\nsay to me, went to bed despairing. I got up despairing, and went out\ndespairing. It was Saturday morning, and I went straight to the Commons.\n\nI was surprised, when I came within sight of our office-door, to see the\nticket-porters standing outside talking together, and some half dozen\nstragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up. I quickened my\npace, and, passing among them, wondering at their looks, went hurriedly\nin.\n\nThe clerks were there, but nobody was doing anything. Old Tiffey, for\nthe first time in his life I should think, was sitting on somebody\nelse's stool, and had not hung up his hat.\n\n\"This is a dreadful calamity, Mr. Copperfield,\" said he, as I entered.\n\n\"What is?\" I exclaimed. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\" cried Tiffey, and all the rest of them, coming round\nme.\n\n\"No!\" said I, looking from face to face.\n\n\"Mr. Spenlow,\" said Tiffey.\n\n\"What about him!\"\n\n\"Dead!\"\n\nI thought it was the office reeling, and not I, as one of the clerks\ncaught hold of me. They sat me down in a chair, untied my neckcloth, and\nbrought me some water. I have no idea whether this took any time.\n\n\"Dead?\" said I.\n\n\"He dined in town yesterday, and drove down in the phaeton by himself,\"\nsaid Tiffey, \"having sent his own groom home by the coach, as he\nsometimes did, you know----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The phaeton went home without him. The horses stopped at the stable\ngate. The man went out with a lantern. Nobody in the carriage.\"\n\n\"Had they run away?\"\n\n\"They were not hot,\" said Tiffey, putting on his glasses; \"no hotter, I\nunderstand, than they would have been, going down at the usual pace. The\nreins were broken, but they had been dragging on the ground. The house\nwas roused up directly, and three of them went out along the road. They\nfound him a mile off.\"\n\n\"More than a mile off, Mr. Tiffey,\" interposed a junior.\n\n\"Was it? I believe you are right,\" said Tiffey,--\"_more_ than a mile\noff--not far from the church--lying partly on the road-side, and partly\non the path, upon his face. Whether he fell out in a fit, or got out,\nfeeling ill before the fit came on--or even whether he was quite dead\nthen, though there is no doubt he was quite insensible--no one appears\nto know. If he breathed, certainly he never spoke. Medical assistance\nwas got as soon as possible, but it was quite useless.\"\n\nI cannot describe the state of mind into which I was thrown by this\nintelligence. The shock of such an event happening so suddenly, and\nhappening to one with whom I had been in any respect at variance--the\nappalling vacancy in the room he had occupied so lately, where his chair\nand table seemed to wait for him, and his handwriting of yesterday was\nlike a ghost--the indefinable impossibility of separating him from the\nplace, and feeling, when the door opened, as if he might come in--the\nlazy hush and rest there was in the office, and the insatiable relish\nwith which our people talked about it, and other people came in and out\nall day, and gorged themselves with the subject--this is easily\nintelligible to any one. What I cannot describe is, how, in the\ninnermost recesses of my own heart, I had a lurking jealousy even of\nDeath. How I felt as if its might would push me from my ground in Dora's\nthoughts. How I was, in a grudging way I have no words for, envious of\nher grief. How it made me restless to think of her weeping to others, or\nbeing consoled by others. How I had a grasping, avaricious wish to shut\nout everybody from her but myself, and to be all in all to her, at that\nunseasonable time of all times.\n\nIn the trouble of this state of mind--not exclusively my own, I hope,\nbut known to others--I went down to Norwood that night; and finding from\none of the servants, when I made my inquiries at the door, that Miss\nMills was there, got my aunt to direct a letter to her, which I wrote. I\ndeplored the untimely death of Mr. Spenlow most sincerely, and shed\ntears in doing so. I entreated her to tell Dora, if Dora were in a state\nto hear it, that he had spoken to me with the utmost kindness and\nconsideration; and had coupled nothing but tenderness, not a single or\nreproachful word, with her name. I know I did this selfishly, to have my\nname brought before her; but I tried to believe it was an act of justice\nto his memory. Perhaps I did believe it.\n\nMy aunt received a few lines next day in reply; addressed, outside, to\nher; within, to me. Dora was overcome by grief; and when her friend had\nasked her should she send her love to me, had only cried, as she was\nalways crying, \"Oh, dear papa! oh, poor papa!\" But she had not said No,\nand that I made the most of.\n\nMr. Jorkins, who had been at Norwood since the occurrence, came to the\noffice a few days afterwards. He and Tiffey were closeted together for\nsome few moments, and then Tiffey looked out at the door and beckoned me\nin.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Jorkins. \"Mr. Tiffey and myself, Mr. Copperfield, are\nabout to examine the desk, the drawers, and other such repositories of\nthe deceased, with the view of sealing up his private papers, and\nsearching for a Will. There is no trace of any, elsewhere. It may be as\nwell for you to assist us, if you please.\"\n\nI had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances\nin which my Dora would be placed--as, in whose guardianship, and so\nforth--and this was something towards it. We began the search at once;\nMr. Jorkins unlocking the drawers and desks, and we all taking out the\npapers. The office-papers we placed on one side, and the private papers\n(which were not numerous) on the other. We were very grave; and when we\ncame to a stray seal, or pencil-case, or ring, or any little article of\nthat kind which we associated personally with him, we spoke very low.\n\nWe had sealed up several packets; and were still going on dustily and\nquietly, when Mr. Jorkins said to us, applying exactly the same words to\nhis late partner as his late partner had applied to him:\n\n\"Mr. Spenlow was very difficult to move from the beaten track. You know\nwhat he was! I am disposed to think he had made no will.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know he had!\" said I.\n\nThey both stopped and looked at me.\n\n\"On the very day when I last saw him,\" said I, \"he told me that he had,\nand that his affairs were long since settled.\"\n\nMr. Jorkins and old Tiffey shook their heads with one accord.\n\n\"That looks unpromising,\" said Tiffey.\n\n\"Very unpromising,\" said Mr. Jorkins.\n\n\"Surely you don't doubt--\" I began.\n\n\"My good Mr. Copperfield!\" said Tiffey, laying his hand upon my arm, and\nshutting up both his eyes as he shook his head: \"if you had been in the\nCommons as long as I have, you would know that there is no subject on\nwhich men are so inconsistent, and so little to be trusted.\"\n\n\"Why, bless my soul, he made that very remark!\" I replied persistently.\n\n\"I should call that almost final,\" observed Tiffey. \"My opinion is--no\nwill.\"\n\nIt appeared a wonderful thing to me, but it turned out that there _was_\nno will. He had never so much as thought of making one, so far as his\npapers afforded any evidence; for there was no kind of hint, sketch, or\nmemorandum, of any testamentary intention whatever. What was scarcely\nless astonishing to me, was, that his affairs were in a most disordered\nstate. It was extremely difficult, I heard, to make out what he owed, or\nwhat he had paid, or of what he died possessed. It was considered likely\nthat for years he could have had no clear opinion on these subjects\nhimself. By little and little it came out, that, in the competition on\nall points of appearance and gentility then running high in the Commons,\nhe had spent more than his professional income, which was not a very\nlarge one, and had reduced his private means, if they ever had been\ngreat (which was exceedingly doubtful), to a very low ebb indeed. There\nwas a sale of the furniture and lease, at Norwood; and Tiffey told me,\nlittle thinking how interested I was in the story, that, paying all the\njust debts of the deceased, and deducting his share of outstanding bad\nand doubtful debts due to the firm, he wouldn't give a thousand pounds\nfor all the assets remaining.\n\nThis was at the expiration of about six weeks. I had suffered tortures\nall the time; and thought I really must have laid violent hands upon\nmyself, when Miss Mills still reported to me, that my broken-hearted\nlittle Dora would say nothing, when I was mentioned, but \"Oh, poor papa!\nOh, dear papa!\" Also, that she had no other relations than two aunts,\nmaiden sisters of Mr. Spenlow, who lived at Putney, and who had not held\nany other than chance communication with their brother for many years.\nNot that they had ever quarrelled (Miss Mills informed me); but that\nhaving been, on the occasion of Dora's christening, invited to tea, when\nthey considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner, they had\nexpressed their opinion in writing, that it was \"better for the\nhappiness of all parties\" that they should stay away. Since which they\nhad gone their road, and their brother had gone his.\n\nThese two ladies now emerged from their retirement, and proposed to take\nDora to live at Putney. Dora, clinging to them both, and weeping,\nexclaimed, \"O yes, aunts! Please take Julia Mills and me and Jip to\nPutney!\" So they went, very soon after the funeral.\n\nHow I found time to haunt Putney, I am sure I don't know; but I\ncontrived, by some means or other, to prowl about the neighbourhood\npretty often. Miss Mills, for the more exact discharge of the duties of\nfriendship, kept a journal; and she used to meet me sometimes, on the\nCommon, and read it, or (if she had not time to do that) lend it to me.\nHow I treasured up the entries, of which I subjoin a sample!\n\n\"Monday. My sweet D. still much depressed. Headache. Called attention to\nJ. as being beautifully sleek. D. fondled J. Associations thus awakened,\nopened floodgates of sorrow. Rush of grief admitted. (Are tears the\ndewdrops of the heart? J. M.)\n\n\"Tuesday. D. weak and nervous. Beautiful in pallor. (Do we not remark\nthis in moon likewise? J. M.) D. J. M. and J. took airing in carriage.\nJ. looking out of window, and barking violently at dustman, occasioned\nsmile to overspread features of D. (Of such slight links is chain of\nlife composed! J. M.)\n\n\"Wednesday. D. comparatively cheerful. Sang to her, as congenial melody,\nEvening Bells. Effect not soothing, but reverse. D. inexpressibly\naffected. Found sobbing afterwards, in own room. Quoted verses\nrespecting self and young Gazelle. Ineffectually. Also referred to\nPatience on Monument. (Qy. Why on monument? J. M.)\n\n\"Thursday. D. certainly improved. Better night. Slight tinge of damask\nrevisiting cheek. Resolved to mention name of D. C. Introduced same,\ncautiously, in course of airing. D. immediately overcome. 'Oh, dear,\ndear Julia! Oh, I have been a naughty and undutiful child!' Soothed and\ncaressed. Drew ideal picture of D. C. on verge of tomb. D. again\novercome. 'Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do? Oh, take me somewhere!'\nMuch alarmed. Fainting of D. and glass of water from public-house.\n(Poetical affinity. Chequered sign on door-post; chequered human life.\nAlas! J. M.)\n\n\"Friday. Day of incident. Man appears in kitchen, with blue bag, 'for\nlady's boots left out to heel.' Cook replies, 'No such orders.' Man\nargues point. Cook withdraws to inquire, leaving man alone with J. On\nCook's return, man still argues point, but ultimately goes. J. missing.\nD. distracted. Information sent to police. Man to be identified by broad\nnose, and legs like balustrades of bridge. Search made in every\ndirection. No J. D. weeping bitterly, and inconsolable. Renewed\nreference to young Gazelle. Appropriate, but unavailing. Towards\nevening, strange boy calls. Brought into parlour. Broad nose, but no\nbalustrades. Says he wants a pound, and knows a dog. Declines to explain\nfurther, though much pressed. Pound being produced by D. takes Cook to\nlittle house, where J. alone tied up to leg of table. Joy of D. who\ndances round J. while he eats his supper. Emboldened by this happy\nchange, mention D. C. upstairs. D. weeps afresh, cries piteously. 'Oh,\ndon't, don't, don't. It is so wicked to think of anything but poor\npapa!'--embraces J. and sobs herself to sleep. (Must not D. C. confide\nhimself to the broad pinions of Time? J. M.)\"\n\nMiss Mills and her journal were my sole consolation at this period. To\nsee her, who had seen Dora but a little while before--to trace the\ninitial letter of Dora's name through her sympathetic pages--to be made\nmore and more miserable by her--were my only comforts. I felt as if I\nhad been living in a palace of cards, which had tumbled down, leaving\nonly Miss Mills and me among the ruins; as if some grim enchanter had\ndrawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart, which\nnothing indeed but those same strong pinions, capable of carrying so\nmany people over so much, would enable me to enter!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nWICKFIELD AND HEEP.\n\n\nMy aunt, beginning, I imagine, to be made seriously uncomfortable by my\nprolonged dejection, made a pretence of being anxious that I should go\nto Dover, to see that all was working well at the cottage, which was\nlet; and to conclude an agreement, with the same tenant, for a longer\nterm of occupation. Janet was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong,\nwhere I saw her every day. She had been undecided, on leaving Dover,\nwhether or no to give the finishing touch to that renunciation of\nmankind in which she had been educated, by marrying a pilot; but she\ndecided against that venture. Not so much for the sake of principle, I\nbelieve, as because she happened not to like him.\n\nAlthough it required an effort to leave Miss Mills, I fell rather\nwillingly into my aunt's pretence, as a means of enabling me to pass a\nfew tranquil hours with Agnes. I consulted the good Doctor relative to\nan absence of three days; and the Doctor wishing me to take that\nrelaxation,--he wished me to take more; but my energy could not bear\nthat,--I made up my mind to go.\n\nAs to the Commons, I had no great occasion to be particular about my\nduties in that quarter. To say the truth, we were getting in no very\ngood odour among the tip-top proctors, and were rapidly sliding down to\nbut a doubtful position. The business had been indifferent under Mr.\nJorkins, before Mr. Spenlow's time; and although it had been quickened\nby the infusion of new blood, and by the display which Mr. Spenlow made,\nstill it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear,\nwithout being shaken, such a blow as the sudden loss of its active\nmanager. It fell off very much. Mr. Jorkins, notwithstanding his\nreputation in the firm, was an easy-going, incapable, sort of man, whose\nreputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up. I was turned\nover to him now, and when I saw him take his snuff and let the business\ngo, I regretted my aunt's thousand pounds more than ever.\n\nBut this was not the worst of it. There were a number of hangers-on and\noutsiders about the Commons, who, without being proctors themselves,\ndabbled in common-form business, and got it done by real proctors, who\nlent their names in consideration of a share in the spoil;--and there\nwere a good many of these too. As our house now wanted business on any\nterms, we joined this noble band; and threw out lures to the hangers-on\nand outsiders, to bring their business to us. Marriage licenses and\nsmall probates were what we all looked for, and what paid us best; and\nthe competition for these, ran very high indeed. Kidnappers and\ninveiglers were planted in all the avenues of entrance to the Commons,\nwith instructions to do their utmost to cut off all persons in mourning,\nand all gentlemen with anything bashful in their appearance, and entice\nthem to the offices in which their respective employers were interested;\nwhich instructions were so well observed, that I myself, before I was\nknown by sight, was twice hustled into the premises of our principal\nopponent. The conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of\na nature to irritate their feelings, personal collisions took place; and\nthe Commons was even scandalised by our principal inveigler (who had\nformerly been in the wine trade, and afterwards in the sworn brokery\nline) walking about for some days with a black eye. Any one of these\nscouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black\nout of a vehicle, killing any proctor whom she inquired for,\nrepresenting his employer as the lawful successor and representative of\nthat proctor, and bearing the old lady off (sometimes greatly affected)\nto his employer's office. Many captives were brought to me in this way.\nAs to marriage licenses, the competition rose to such a pitch, that a\nshy gentleman in want of one, had nothing to do but submit himself to\nthe first inveigler, or be fought for, and become the prey of the\nstrongest. One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, in the height\nof this contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might be ready to rush\nout and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in. The\nsystem of inveigling continues, I believe, to this day. The last time I\nwas in the Commons, a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced\nout upon me from a doorway, and whispering the word \"Marriage-license\"\nin my ear, was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his\narms and lifting me into a proctor's.\n\nFrom this digression, let me proceed to Dover.\n\nI found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage; and was\nenabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant\ninherited her feud, and waged incessant war against donkies. Having\nsettled the little business I had to transact there, and slept there one\nnight, I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning. It was now winter\nagain; and the fresh, cold windy day, and the sweeping downland,\nbrightened up my hopes a little.\n\nComing into Canterbury, I loitered through the old streets with a sober\npleasure that calmed my spirits, and eased my heart. There were the old\nsigns, the old names over the shops, the old people serving in them. It\nappeared so long, since I had been a schoolboy there, that I wondered\nthe place was so little changed, until I reflected how little I was\nchanged myself. Strange to say, that quiet influence which was\ninseparable in my mind from Agnes, seemed to pervade even the city where\nshe dwelt. The venerable cathedral towers, and the old jackdaws and\nrooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence\nwould have done; the battered gateways, once stuck full with statues,\nlong thrown down, and crumbled away, like the reverential pilgrims who\nhad gazed upon them; the still nooks, where the ivied growth of\ncenturies crept over gabled ends and ruined walls; the ancient houses,\nthe pastoral landscape of field, orchard, and garden; everywhere--on\neverything--I felt the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful,\nsoftening spirit.\n\nArrived at Mr. Wickfield's house, I found, in the little lower-room on\nthe ground floor, where Uriah Heep had been of old accustomed to sit,\nMr. Micawber plying his pen with great assiduity. He was dressed in a\nlegal-looking suit of black, and loomed, burly and large, in that small\noffice.\n\nMr. Micawber was extremely glad to see me, but a little confused too. He\nwould have conducted me immediately into the presence of Uriah, but I\ndeclined.\n\n\"I know the house of old, you recollect,\" said I, \"and will find my way\nup stairs. How do you like the law, Mr. Micawber?\"\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" he replied. \"To a man possessed of the higher\nimaginative powers, the objection to legal studies is the amount of\ndetail which they involve. Even in our professional correspondence,\"\nsaid Mr. Micawber, glancing at some letters he was writing, \"the mind is\nnot at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression. Still, it is a\ngreat pursuit. A great pursuit!\"\n\nHe then told me that he had become the tenant of Uriah Heep's old house;\nand that Mrs. Micawber would be delighted to receive me, once more,\nunder her own roof.\n\n\"It is humble,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"--to quote a favourite expression of\nmy friend Heep; but it may prove the stepping-stone to more ambitious\ndomiciliary accommodation.\"\n\nI asked him whether he had reason, so far, to be satisfied with his\nfriend Heep's treatment of him? He got up to ascertain if the door were\nclose shut, before he replied, in a lower voice:\n\n\"My dear Copperfield, a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary\nembarrassments, is, with the generality of people, at a disadvantage.\nThat disadvantage is not diminished, when that pressure necessitates the\ndrawing of stipendiary emoluments, before those emoluments are strictly\ndue and payable. All I can say is, that my friend Heep has responded to\nappeals to which I need not more particularly refer, in a manner\ncalculated to redound equally to the honour of his head, and of his\nheart.\"\n\n\"I should not have supposed him to be very free with his money either,\"\nI observed.\n\n\"Pardon me!\" said Mr. Micawber, with an air of constraint, \"I speak of\nmy friend Heep as I have experience.\"\n\n\"I am glad your experience is so favourable,\" I returned.\n\n\"You are very obliging, my dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber; and\nhummed a tune.\n\n\"Do you see much of Mr. Wickfield?\" I asked, to change the subject.\n\n\"Not much,\" said Mr. Micawber, slightingly. \"Mr. Wickfield is, I dare\nsay, a man of very excellent intentions; but he is--in short, he is\nobsolete.\"\n\n\"I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so,\" said I.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield!\" returned Mr. Micawber, after some uneasy\nevolutions on his stool, \"allow me to offer a remark! I am here, in\na capacity of confidence. I am here, in a position of trust. The\ndiscussion of some topics, even with Mrs. Micawber herself (so long\nthe partner of my various vicissitudes, and a woman of a remarkable\nlucidity of intellect), is, I am led to consider, incompatible with\nthe functions now devolving on me. I would therefore take the liberty\nof suggesting that in our friendly intercourse--which I trust will\nnever be disturbed!--we draw a line. On one side of this line,\" said\nMr. Micawber, representing it on the desk with the office ruler, \"is\nthe whole range of the human intellect, with a trifling exception; on\nthe other, _is_ that exception; that is to say, the affairs of Messrs.\nWickfield and Heep, with all belonging and appertaining thereunto. I\ntrust I give no offence to the companion of my youth, in submitting\nthis proposition to his cooler judgment?\"\n\nThough I saw an uneasy change in Mr. Micawber, which sat tightly on him,\nas if his new duties were a misfit, I felt I had no right to be\noffended. My telling him so, appeared to relieve him; and he shook hands\nwith me.\n\n\"I am charmed, Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"let me assure you, with\nMiss Wickfield. She is a very superior young lady, of very remarkable\nattractions, graces, and virtues. Upon my honour,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nindefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air, \"I do\nHomage to Miss Wickfield! Hem!\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, at least,\" said I.\n\n\"If you had not assured us, my dear Copperfield, on the occasion of that\nagreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with you, that D was\nyour favourite letter,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"I should unquestionably have\nsupposed that A had been so.\"\n\nWe have all some experience of a feeling, that comes over us\noccasionally, of what we are saying and doing having been said and done\nbefore, in a remote time--of our having been surrounded, dim ages ago,\nby the same faces, objects, and circumstances--of our knowing perfectly\nwhat will be said next, as if we suddenly remembered it! I never had\nthis mysterious impression more strongly in my life, than before he\nuttered those words.\n\nI took my leave of Mr. Micawber, for the time, charging him with my best\nremembrances to all at home. As I left him, resuming his stool and his\npen, and rolling his head in his stock, to get it into easier writing\norder, I clearly perceived that there was something interposed between\nhim and me, since he had come into his new functions which prevented our\ngetting at each other as we used to do, and quite altered the character\nof our intercourse.\n\nThere was no one in the quaint old drawing-room, though it presented\ntokens of Mrs. Heep's whereabout. I looked into the room still belonging\nto Agnes, and saw her sitting by the fire, at a pretty old fashioned\ndesk she had, writing.\n\nMy darkening the light made her look up. What a pleasure to be the cause\nof that bright change in her attentive face, and the object of that\nsweet regard and welcome!\n\n\"Ah, Agnes!\" said I, when we were sitting together, side by side; \"I\nhave missed you so much, lately!\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" she replied. \"Again! And so soon?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I don't know how it is, Agnes; I seem to want some faculty of mind that\nI ought to have. You were so much in the habit of thinking for me, in\nthe happy old days here, and I came so naturally to you for counsel and\nsupport, that I really think I have missed acquiring it?\"\n\n\"And what is it?\" said Agnes, cheerfully.\n\n\"I don't know what to call it,\" I replied. \"I think I am earnest and\npersevering?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" said Agnes.\n\n\"And patient, Agnes?\" I enquired, with a little hesitation.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Agnes, laughing. \"Pretty well.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said I, \"I get so miserable and worried, and am so unsteady\nand irresolute in my power of assuring myself, that I know I must\nwant--shall I call it--reliance, of some kind?\"\n\n\"Call it so, if you will,\" said Agnes.\n\n\"Well!\" I returned. \"See here! You come to London, I rely on you, and I\nhave an object and a course at once. I am driven out of it, I come here,\nand in a moment I feel an altered person. The circumstances that\ndistressed me are not changed, since I came into this room; but an\ninfluence comes over me in that short interval that alters me, oh, how\nmuch for the better! What is it? What is your secret, Agnes?\"\n\nHer head was bent down, looking at the fire.\n\n\"It's the old story,\" said I. \"Don't laugh, when I say it was always the\nsame in little things as it is in greater ones. My old troubles were\nnonsense, and now they are serious; but whenever I have gone away from\nmy adopted sister--\"\n\nAgnes looked up--with such a Heavenly face!--and gave me her hand, which\nI kissed.\n\n\"Whenever I have not had you, Agnes, to advise and approve in the\nbeginning, I have seemed to go wild, and to get into all sorts of\ndifficulty. When I have come to you, at last (as I have always done), I\nhave come to peace and happiness. I come home, now, like a tired\ntraveller, and find such a blessed sense of rest!\"\n\nI felt so deeply what I said, it affected me so sincerely, that my voice\nfailed, and I covered my face with my hand, and broke into tears. I\nwrite the truth. Whatever contradictions and inconsistencies there were\nwithin me, as there are within so many of us; whatever might have been\nso different, and so much better; whatever I had done, in which I had\nperversely wandered away from the voice of my own heart; I knew nothing\nof. I only knew that I was fervently in earnest, when I felt the rest\nand peace of having Agnes near me.\n\nIn her placid sisterly manner; with her beaming eyes; with her tender\nvoice; and with that sweet composure, which had long ago made the house\nthat held her quite a sacred place to me; she soon won me from this\nweakness, and led me on to tell all that had happened since our last\nmeeting.\n\n\"And there is not another word to tell, Agnes,\" said I, when I had made\nan end of my confidence. \"Now, my reliance is on you.\"\n\n\"But it must not be on me, Trotwood,\" returned Agnes, with a pleasant\nsmile. \"It must be on some one else.\"\n\n\"On Dora?\" said I.\n\n\"Assuredly.\"\n\n\"Why, I have not mentioned, Agnes,\" said I, a little embarrassed, \"that\nDora is rather difficult to--I would not, for the world, say, to rely\nupon, because she is the soul of purity and truth--but rather difficult\nto--I hardly know how to express it, really, Agnes. She is a timid\nlittle thing, and easily disturbed and frightened. Some time ago, before\nher father's death, when I thought it right to mention to her--but I'll\ntell you, if you will bear with me, how it was.\"\n\nAccordingly, I told Agnes about my declaration of poverty, about the\ncookery-book, the housekeeping accounts, and all the rest of it.\n\n\"Oh, Trotwood!\" she remonstrated, with a smile. \"Just your old headlong\nway! You might have been in earnest in striving to get on in the world,\nwithout being so very sudden with a timid, loving, inexperienced girl.\nPoor Dora!\"\n\nI never heard such sweet forbearing kindness expressed in a voice, as\nshe expressed in making this reply. It was as if I had seen her\nadmiringly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, by her\nconsiderate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that little\nheart. It was as if I had seen Dora, in all her fascinating artlessness,\ncaressing Agnes, and thanking her, and coaxingly appealing against me,\nand loving me with all her childish innocence.\n\nI felt so grateful to Agnes, and admired her so! I saw those two\ntogether, in a bright perspective, such well-associated friends, each\nadorning the other so much!\n\n\"What ought I to do then, Agnes?\" I inquired, after looking at the fire\na little while. \"What would it be right to do?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Agnes, \"that the honourable course to take, would be to\nwrite to those two ladies. Don't you think that any secret course is an\nunworthy one?\"\n\n\"Yes. If _you_ think so,\" said I.\n\n\"I am poorly qualified to judge of such matters,\" replied Agnes, with a\nmodest hesitation, \"but I certainly feel--in short, I feel that your\nbeing secret and clandestine, is not being like yourself.\"\n\n\"Like myself, in the too high opinion you have of me, Agnes, I am\nafraid,\" said I.\n\n\"Like yourself in the candour of your nature,\" she returned; \"and\ntherefore I would write to those two ladies. I would relate, as plainly\nand as openly as possible, all that has taken place; and I would ask\ntheir permission to visit sometimes, at their house. Considering that\nyou are young, and striving for a place in life, I think it would be\nwell to say that you would readily abide by any conditions they might\nimpose upon you. I would entreat them not to dismiss your request,\nwithout a reference to Dora; and to discuss it with her when they should\nthink the time suitable. I would not be too vehement,\" said Agnes,\ngently, \"or propose too much. I would trust to my fidelity and\nperseverance--and to Dora.\"\n\n\"But if they were to frighten Dora again, Agnes, by speaking to her,\"\nsaid I. \"And if Dora were to cry, and say nothing about me!\"\n\n\"Is that likely?\" inquired Agnes, with the same sweet consideration in\nher face.\n\n\"God bless her, she is as easily scared as a bird,\" said I. \"It might\nbe! Or if the two Miss Spenlows (elderly ladies of that sort are odd\ncharacters sometimes) should not be likely persons to address in that\nway!\"\n\n\"I don't think, Trotwood,\" returned Agnes, raising her soft eyes to\nmine, \"I would consider that. Perhaps it would be better only to\nconsider whether it is right to do this; and, if it is, to do it.\"\n\nI had no longer any doubt on the subject. With a lightened heart, though\nwith a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task, I devoted\nthe whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of this letter; for\nwhich great purpose, Agnes relinquished her desk to me. But first I went\ndown stairs to see Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep.\n\nI found Uriah in possession of a new, plaster-smelling office, built out\nin the garden; looking extraordinarily mean, in the midst of a quantity\nof books and papers. He received me in his usual fawning way, and\npretended not to have heard of my arrival from Mr. Micawber; a pretence\nI took the liberty of disbelieving. He accompanied me into Mr.\nWickfield's room, which was the shadow of its former self--having been\ndivested of a variety of conveniences, for the accommodation of the new\npartner--and stood before the fire, warming his back, and shaving his\nchin with his bony hand, while Mr. Wickfield and I exchanged greetings.\n\n\"You stay with us, Trotwood, while you remain in Canterbury?\" said Mr.\nWickfield, not without a glance at Uriah for his approval.\n\n\"Is there room for me?\" said I.\n\n\"I am sure, Master Copperfield--I should say Mister, but the other comes\nso natural,\" said Uriah,--\"I would turn out of your old room with\npleasure, if it would be agreeable.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"Why should _you_ be inconvenienced?\nThere's another room. There's another room.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you know,\" returned Uriah, with a grin, \"I should really be\ndelighted!\"\n\nTo cut the matter short, I said I would have the other room or none at\nall; so it was settled that I should have the other room: and, taking my\nleave of the firm until dinner, I went up stairs again.\n\nI had hoped, to have no other companion than Agnes. But Mrs. Heep had\nasked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the fire,\nin that room; on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable\nfor her rheumatics, as the wind then was, than the drawing-room or\ndining-parlour. Though I could almost have consigned her to the mercies\nof the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral, without remorse,\nI made a virtue of necessity, and gave her a friendly salutation.\n\n\"I'm umbly thankful to you, sir,\" said Mrs. Heep, in acknowledgment of\nmy inquiries concerning her health, \"but I'm only pretty well. I haven't\nmuch to boast of. If I could see my Uriah well settled in life, I\ncouldn't expect much more I think. How do you think my Ury looking,\nsir?\"\n\nI thought him looking as villanous as ever, and I replied that I saw no\nchange in him.\n\n\"Oh, don't you think he's changed?\" said Mrs. Heep. \"There I must umbly\nbeg leave to differ from you. Don't you see a thinness in him?\"\n\n\"Not more than usual,\" I replied.\n\n\"_Don't_ you though!\" said Mrs. Heep. \"But you don't take notice of him\nwith a mother's eye!\"\n\nHis mother's eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world, I thought as\nit met mine, howsoever affectionate to him; and I believe she and her\nson were devoted to one another. It passed me, and went on to Agnes.\n\n\"Don't _you_ see a wasting and a wearing in him, Miss Wickfield?\"\ninquired Mrs. Heep.\n\n\"No,\" said Agnes, quietly pursuing the work on which she was engaged.\n\"You are too solicitous about him. He is very well.\"\n\nMrs. Heep, with a prodigious sniff, resumed her knitting.\n\nShe never left off, or left us for a moment. I had arrived early in the\nday, and we had still three or four hours before dinner; but she sat\nthere, plying her knitting-needles as monotonously as an hour-glass\nmight have poured out its sands. She sat on one side of the fire; I sat\nat the desk in front of it; a little beyond me, on the other side, sat\nAgnes. Whensoever, slowly pondering over my letter, I lifted up my eyes,\nand meeting the thoughtful face of Agnes, saw it clear, and beam\nencouragement upon me, with its own angelic expression, I was conscious\npresently of the evil eye passing me, and going on to her, and coming\nback to me again, and dropping furtively upon the knitting. What the\nknitting was, I don't know, not being learned in that art; but it looked\nlike a net; and as she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of\nknitting-needles, she showed in the firelight like an ill-looking\nenchantress, baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite, but\ngetting ready for a cast of her net by-and-by.\n\nAt dinner she maintained her watch, with the same unwinking eyes. After\ndinner, her son took his turn; and when Mr. Wickfield, himself, and I\nwere left alone together, leered at me, and writhed until I could hardly\nbear it. In the drawing-room, there was the mother knitting and watching\nagain. All the time that Agnes sang and played, the mother sat at the\npiano. Once she asked for a particular ballad, which she said her Ury\n(who was yawning in a great chair) doted on; and at intervals she looked\nround at him, and reported to Agnes that he was in raptures with the\nmusic. But she hardly ever spoke--I question if she ever did--without\nmaking some mention of him. It was evident to me that this was the duty\nassigned to her.\n\nThis lasted until bedtime. To have seen the mother and son, like two\ngreat bats hanging over the whole house, and darkening it with their\nugly forms, made me so uncomfortable, that I would rather have remained\ndown stairs, knitting and all, than gone to bed. I hardly got any sleep.\nNext day the knitting and watching began again, and lasted all day.\n\nI had not an opportunity of speaking to Agnes, for ten minutes. I could\nbarely show her my letter. I proposed to her to walk out with me; but\nMrs. Heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse, Agnes charitably\nremained within, to bear her company. Towards the twilight I went out by\nmyself, musing on what I ought to do, and whether I was justified in\nwithholding from Agnes, any longer, what Uriah Heep had told me in\nLondon; for that began to trouble me again, very much.\n\nI had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town, upon the\nRamsgate road, where there was a good path, when I was hailed, through\nthe dusk, by somebody behind me. The shambling figure, and the scanty\ngreat coat, were not to be mistaken. I stopped, and Uriah Heep came up.\n\n\"Well?\" said I.\n\n\"How fast you walk!\" said he. \"My legs are pretty long, but you've given\n'em quite a job.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" said I.\n\n\"I am coming with you, Master Copperfield, if you'll allow me the\npleasure of a walk with an old acquaintance.\" Saying this, with a jerk\nof his body, which might have been either propitiatory or derisive, he\nfell into step beside me.\n\n\"Uriah!\" said I, as civilly as I could, after a silence.\n\n\"Master Copperfield!\" said Uriah.\n\n\"To tell you the truth (at which you will not be offended), I came out\nto walk alone, because I have had so much company.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways, and said with his hardest grin, \"You mean\nmother?\"\n\n\"Why yes, I do,\" said I.\n\n\"Ah! But you know we're so very umble,\" he returned. \"And having such a\nknowledge of our own umbleness, we must really take care that we're not\npushed to the wall by them as isn't umble. All stratagems are fair in\nlove, sir.\"\n\nRaising his great hands until they touched his chin, he rubbed them\nsoftly, and softly chuckled; looking as like a malevolent baboon, I\nthought, as anything human could look.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, still hugging himself in that unpleasant way, and\nshaking his head at me, \"you're quite a dangerous rival, Master\nCopperfield. You always was, you know.\"\n\n\"Do you set a watch upon Miss Wickfield, and make her home no home,\nbecause of me?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh! Master Copperfield! Those are very arsh words,\" he replied.\n\n\"Put my meaning into any words you like,\" said I. \"You know what it is,\nUriah, as well as I do.\"\n\n\"Oh no! You must put it into words,\" he said. \"Oh, really! I couldn't\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose,\" said I, constraining myself to be very temperate and\nquiet with him, on account of Agnes, \"that I regard Miss Wickfield\notherwise than as a very dear sister?\"\n\n\"Well, Master Copperfield,\" he replied, \"you perceive I am not bound to\nanswer that question. You may not, you know. But then, you see, you\nmay!\"\n\nAnything to equal the low cunning of his visage, and of his shadowless\neyes without the ghost of an eyelash, I never saw.\n\n\"Come, then!\" said I. \"For the sake of Miss Wickfield----\"\n\n\"My Agnes!\" he exclaimed, with a sickly, angular contortion of himself.\n\"Would you be so good as call her Agnes, Master Copperfield!\"\n\n\"For the sake of Agnes Wickfield--Heaven bless her!\"\n\n\"Thank you for that blessing, Master Copperfield!\" he interposed.\n\n\"I will tell you what I should, under any other circumstances, as soon\nhave thought of telling to--Jack Ketch.\"\n\n\"To who, sir?\" said Uriah, stretching out his neck, and shading his ear\nwith his hand.\n\n\"To the hangman,\" I returned. \"The most unlikely person I could think\nof,\"--though his own face had suggested the allusion quite as a natural\nsequence. \"I am engaged to another young lady. I hope that contents\nyou.\"\n\n\"Upon your soul?\" said Uriah.\n\nI was about indignantly to give my assertion the confirmation he\nrequired, when he caught hold of my hand, and gave it a squeeze.\n\n\"Oh, Master Copperfield!\" he said. \"If you had only had the\ncondescension to return my confidence when I poured out the fulness of\nmy art, the night I put you so much out of the way by sleeping before\nyour sitting-room fire, I never should have doubted you. As it is, I'm\nsure I'll take off mother directly, and only too appy. I know you'll\nexcuse the precautions of affection, won't you? What a pity, Master\nCopperfield, that you didn't condescend to return my confidence! I'm\nsure I gave you every opportunity. But you never have condescended to\nme, as much as I could have wished. I know you have never liked me, as I\nhave liked you!\"\n\nAll this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishey fingers,\nwhile I made every effort I decently could to get it away. But I was\nquite unsuccessful. He drew it under the sleeve of his mulberry-colored\ngreat coat, and I walked on, almost upon compulsion, arm in arm with\nhim.\n\n\"Shall we turn?\" said Uriah, by-and-by wheeling me face about towards\nthe town, on which the early moon was now shining, silvering the distant\nwindows.\n\n\"Before we leave the subject, you ought to understand,\" said I, breaking\na pretty long silence, \"that I believe Agnes Wickfield to be as far\nabove _you_, and as far removed from all _your_ aspirations, as that\nmoon herself!\"\n\n\"Peaceful! Ain't she!\" said Uriah. \"Very! Now confess, Master\nCopperfield, that you haven't liked me quite as I have liked you. All\nalong you've thought me too umble now, I shouldn't wonder?\"\n\n\"I am not fond of professions of humility,\" I returned, \"or professions\nof anything else.\"\n\n\"There now!\" said Uriah, looking flabby and lead-coloured in the\nmoonlight. \"Didn't I know it! But how little you think of the rightful\numbleness of a person in my station, Master Copperfield! Father and me\nwas both brought up at a foundation school for boys; and mother, she was\nlikewise brought up at a public, sort of charitable, establishment. They\ntaught us all a deal of umbleness--not much else that I know of, from\nmorning to night. We was to be umble to this person, and umble to that;\nand to pull off our caps here, and to make bows there; and always to\nknow our place, and abase ourselves before our betters. And we had such\na lot of betters! Father got the monitor-medal by being umble. So did I.\nFather got made a sexton by being umble. He had the character, among the\ngentlefolks, of being such a well-behaved man, that they were determined\nto bring him in. 'Be umble, Uriah,' says father to me, 'and you'll get\non. It was what was always being dinned into you and me at school; it's\nwhat goes down best. Be umble,' says father, 'and you'll do!' And really\nit ain't done bad!\"\n\nIt was the first time it had ever occurred to me, that this detestable\ncant of false humility might have originated out of the Heep family. I\nhad seen the harvest, but had never thought of the seed.\n\n\"When I was quite a young boy,\" said Uriah, \"I got to know what\numbleness did, and I took to it. I ate umble pie with an appetite. I\nstopped at the umble point of my learning, and says I, 'Hold hard!' When\nyou offered to teach me Latin, I knew better. 'People like to be above\nyou,' says father, 'keep yourself down.' I am very umble to the present\nmoment, Master Copperfield, but I've got a little power!\"\n\nAnd he said all this--I knew, as I saw his face in the moonlight--that I\nmight understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using his\npower. I had never doubted his meanness, his craft and malice; but I\nfully comprehended now, for the first time, what a base, unrelenting,\nand revengeful spirit, must have been engendered by this early, and this\nlong, suppression.\n\nHis account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result,\nthat it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have\nanother hug of himself under the chin. Once apart from him, I was\ndetermined to keep apart; and we walked back, side by side, saying very\nlittle more by the way.\n\nWhether his spirits were elevated by the communication I had made to\nhim, or by his having indulged in this retrospect, I don't know; but\nthey were raised by some influence. He talked more at dinner than\nwas usual with him; asked his mother (off duty, from the moment of\nour re-entering the house), whether he was not growing too old for a\nbachelor; and once looked at Agnes so, that I would have given all I\nhad, for leave to knock him down.\n\nWhen we three males were left alone after dinner, he got into a more\nadventurous state. He had taken little or no wine; and I presume it was\nthe mere insolence of triumph that was upon him, flushed perhaps by the\ntemptation my presence furnished to its exhibition.\n\nI had observed yesterday, that he tried to entice Mr. Wickfield to\ndrink; and, interpreting the look which Agnes had given me as she went\nout, had limited myself to one glass, and then proposed that we should\nfollow her. I would have done so again to-day; but Uriah was too quick\nfor me.\n\n\"We seldom see our present visitor, sir,\" he said, addressing Mr.\nWickfield, sitting, such a contrast to him, at the end of the table,\n\"and I should propose to give him welcome in another glass or two of\nwine, if you have no objections. Mr. Copperfield, your elth and\nappiness!\"\n\nI was obliged to make a show of taking the hand he stretched across to\nme; and then, with very different emotions, I took the hand of the\nbroken gentleman, his partner.\n\n\"Come, fellow partner,\" said Uriah, \"if I may take the liberty,--now,\nsuppose you give us something or another appropriate to Copperfield!\"\n\nI pass over Mr. Wickfield's proposing my aunt, his proposing Mr. Dick,\nhis proposing Doctor's Commons, his proposing Uriah, his drinking\neverything twice; his consciousness of his own weakness, the ineffectual\neffort that he made against it; the struggle between his shame in\nUriah's deportment, and his desire to conciliate him; the manifest\nexultation with which Uriah twisted and turned, and held him up before\nme. It made me sick at heart to see, and my hand recoils from writing\nit.\n\n\"Come, fellow partner!\" said Uriah, at last, \"_I_'ll give you another\none, and I umbly ask for bumpers, seeing I intend to make it the\ndivinest of her sex.\"\n\nHer father had his empty glass in his hand. I saw him set it down, look\nat the picture she was so like, put his hand to his forehead, and shrink\nback in his elbow chair.\n\n\"I'm an umble individual to give you her elth,\" proceeded Uriah, \"but I\nadmire--adore her.\"\n\nNo physical pain that her father's grey head could have borne, I think\ncould have been more terrible to me, than the mental endurance I saw\ncompressed now within both his hands.\n\n\"Agnes,\" said Uriah, either not regarding him, or not knowing what the\nnature of his action was, \"Agnes Wickfield is, I am safe to say, the\ndivinest of her sex. May I speak out, among friends? To be her father is\na proud distinction, but to be her usband--\"\n\nSpare me from ever again hearing such a cry, as that with which her\nfather rose up from the table!\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Uriah, turning of a deadly colour. \"You are\nnot gone mad, after all, Mr. Wickfield, I hope? If I say, I've an\nambition to make your Agnes my Agnes, I have as good a right to it as\nanother man. I have a better right to it than any other man!\"\n\nI had my arms round Mr. Wickfield, imploring him by everything that I\ncould think of, oftenest of all by his love for Agnes, to calm himself a\nlittle. He was mad for the moment; tearing out his hair, beating his\nhead, trying to force me from him and to force himself from me, not\nanswering a word, not looking at or seeing any one; blindly striving for\nhe knew not what, his face all staring and distorted--a frightful\nspectacle.\n\nI conjured him, incoherently, but in the most impassioned manner, not to\nabandon himself to this wildness, but to hear me. I besought him to\nthink of Agnes, to connect me with Agnes, to recollect how Agnes and I\nhad grown up together, how I honored her and loved her, how she was his\npride and joy. I tried to bring her idea before him in any form; I even\nreproached him with not having firmness to spare her the knowledge of\nsuch a scene as this. I may have effected something, or his wildness may\nhave spent itself; but by degrees he struggled less, and began to look\nat me--strangely at first, then with recognition in his eyes. At length\nhe said, \"I know, Trotwood! My darling child and you--I know! But look\nat him!\"\n\nHe pointed to Uriah, pale and glowering in a corner, evidently very much\nout in his calculations, and taken by surprise.\n\n\"Look at my torturer,\" he replied. \"Before him I have step by step\nabandoned name and reputation, peace and quiet, house and home.\"\n\n\"I have kept your name and reputation for you, and your peace and quiet,\nand your house and home too,\" said Uriah, with a sulky, hurried,\ndefeated air of compromise. \"Don't be foolish, Mr. Wickfield. If I have\ngone a little beyond what you were prepared for, I can go back I\nsuppose? There's no harm done.\"\n\n\"I looked for single motives in every one,\" said Mr. Wickfield, \"and I\nwas satisfied I had bound him to me by motives of interest. But see what\nhe is--oh, see what he is!\"\n\n\"You had better stop him, Copperfield, if you can,\" cried Uriah,\nwith his long fore-finger pointing towards me. \"He'll say something\npresently--mind you!--he'll be sorry to have said afterwards, and\nyou'll be sorry to have heard!\"\n\n\"I'll say anything!\" cried Mr. Wickfield, with a desperate air. \"Why\nshould I not be in all the world's power if I am in yours!\"\n\n\"Mind! I tell you!\" said Uriah, continuing to warn me. \"If you don't\nstop his mouth, you're not his friend! Why shouldn't you be in all the\nworld's power, Mr. Wickfield? Because you have got a daughter. You and\nme know what we know, don't we? Let sleeping dogs lie--who wants to\nrouse 'em? I don't. Can't you see I am as umble as I can be? I tell you,\nif I've gone too far, I'm sorry. What would you have, sir?\"\n\n\"Oh, Trotwood, Trotwood!\" exclaimed Mr. Wickfield, wringing his hands.\n\"What I have come down to be, since I first saw you in this house! I was\non my downward way then, but the dreary, dreary, road I have traversed\nsince! Weak indulgence has ruined me. Indulgence in remembrance, and\nindulgence in forgetfulness. My natural grief for my child's mother\nturned to disease; my natural love for my child turned to disease. I\nhave infected everything I touched. I have brought misery on what I\ndearly love, I know--_You_ know! I thought it possible that I could\ntruly love one creature in the world, and not love the rest; I thought\nit possible that I could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the\nworld, and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned. Thus the\nlessons of my life have been perverted! I have preyed on my own morbid\ncoward heart, and it has preyed on me. Sordid in my grief, sordid in my\nlove, sordid in my miserable escape from the darker side of both, oh see\nthe ruin I am, and hate me, shun me!\"\n\nHe dropped into a chair, and weakly sobbed. The excitement into which he\nhad been roused was leaving him. Uriah came out of his corner.\n\n\"I don't know all I have done, in my fatuity,\" said Mr. Wickfield,\nputting out his hands, as if to deprecate my condemnation. \"_He_ knows\nbest,\" meaning Uriah Heep, \"for he has always been at my elbow,\nwhispering me. You see the millstone that he is about my neck. You find\nhim in my house, you find him in my business. You heard him, but a\nlittle time ago. What need have I to say more!\"\n\n\"You haven't need to say so much, nor half so much, nor anything at\nall,\" observed Uriah, half defiant, and half fawning. \"You wouldn't have\ntook it up so, if it hadn't been for the wine. You'll think better of it\nto-morrow, sir. If I have said too much, or more than I meant, what of\nit? I haven't stood by it!\"\n\nThe door opened, and Agnes, gliding in, without a vestige of colour in\nher face, put her arm round his neck, and steadily said, \"Papa, you are\nnot well. Come with me!\" He laid his head upon her shoulder, as if he\nwere oppressed with heavy shame, and went out with her. Her eyes met\nmine for but an instant, yet I saw how much she knew of what had passed.\n\n\"I didn't expect he'd cut up so rough, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah.\n\"But it's nothing. I'll be friends with him to-morrow. It's for his\ngood. I'm umbly anxious for his good.\"\n\nI gave him no answer, and went upstairs into the quiet room where Agnes\nhad so often sat beside me at my books. Nobody came near me until late\nat night. I took up a book, and tried to read. I heard the clocks strike\ntwelve, and was still reading, without knowing what I read, when Agnes\ntouched me.\n\n\"You will be going early in the morning, Trotwood. Let us say good bye,\nnow!\"\n\nShe had been weeping, but her face then was so calm and beautiful!\n\n\"Heaven bless you!\" she said, giving me her hand.\n\n\"Dearest Agnes!\" I returned, \"I see you ask me not to speak of\nto-night--but is there nothing to be done?\"\n\n\"There is God to trust in!\" she replied.\n\n\"Can _I_ do nothing--_I_, who come to you with _my_ poor sorrows?\"\n\n\"And make mine so much lighter,\" she replied. \"Dear Trotwood, no!\"\n\n\"Dear Agnes,\" I said, \"it is presumptuous for me, who am so poor in all\nin which you are so rich--goodness, resolution, all noble qualities--to\ndoubt or direct you; but you know how much I love you, and how much I\nowe you. You will never sacrifice yourself to a mistaken sense of duty,\nAgnes?\"\n\nMore agitated for a moment than I had ever seen her, she took her hand\nfrom me, and moved a step back.\n\n\"Say you have no such thought, dear Agnes! Much more than sister! Think\nof the priceless gift of such a heart as yours, of such a love as\nyours!\"\n\nOh! long, long afterwards, I saw that face rise up before me, with its\nmomentary look, not wondering, not accusing, not regretting. Oh, long,\nlong afterwards, I saw that look subside, as it did now, into the lovely\nsmile, with which she told me she had no fear for herself--I need have\nnone for her--and parted from me by the name of Brother, and was gone!\n\nIt was dark in the morning, when I got upon the coach at the inn door.\nThe day was just breaking when we were about to start, and then, as I\nsat thinking of her, came struggling up the coach side, through the\nmingled day and night, Uriah's head.\n\n\"Copperfield!\" said he, in a croaking whisper, as he hung by the iron on\nthe roof, \"I thought you'd be glad to hear before you went off, that\nthere are no squares broke between us. I've been into his room already,\nand we've made it all smooth. Why, though I'm umble, I'm useful to him,\nyou know; and he understands his interest when he isn't in liquor! What\nan agreeable man he is, after all, Master Copperfield!\"\n\nI obliged myself to say that I was glad he had made his apology.\n\n\"Oh, to be sure!\" said Uriah. \"When a person's umble, you know, what's\nan apology? So easy! I say! I suppose,\" with a jerk, \"you have sometimes\nplucked a pear before it was ripe, Master Copperfield?\"\n\n\"I suppose I have,\" I replied.\n\n\"_I_ did that last night,\" said Uriah; \"but it'll ripen yet! It only\nwants attending to. I can wait!\"\n\nProfuse in his farewells, he got down again as the coachman got up. For\nanything I know, he was eating something to keep the raw morning air\nout; but, he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe\nalready, and he were smacking his lips over it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nTHE WANDERER.\n\n\nWe had a very serious conversation in Buckingham Street that night,\nabout the domestic occurrences I have detailed in the last chapter. My\naunt was deeply interested in them, and walked up and down the room with\nher arms folded, for more than two hours afterwards. Whenever she was\nparticularly discomposed, she always performed one of these pedestrian\nfeats; and the amount of her discomposure might always be estimated by\nthe duration of her walk. On this occasion she was so much disturbed in\nmind as to find it necessary to open the bed-room door, and make a\ncourse for herself, comprising the full extent of the bed-rooms from\nwall to wall; and while Mr. Dick and I sat quietly by the fire, she kept\npassing in and out, along this measured track, at an unchanging pace,\nwith the regularity of a clock-pendulum.\n\nWhen my aunt and I were left to ourselves by Mr. Dick's going out to\nbed, I sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies. By that time\nshe was tired of walking, and sat by the fire with her dress tucked up\nas usual. But instead of sitting in her usual manner, holding her glass\nupon her knee, she suffered it to stand neglected on the chimney-piece;\nand, resting her left elbow on her right arm, and her chin on her left\nhand, looked thoughtfully at me. As often as I raised my eyes from what\nI was about, I met hers. \"I am in the lovingest of tempers, my dear,\"\nshe would assure me with a nod, \"but I am fidgetted and sorry!\"\n\nI had been too busy to observe, until after she was gone to bed, that\nshe had left her night-mixture, as she always called it, untasted on the\nchimney-piece. She came to her door, with even more than her usual\naffection of manner, when I knocked to acquaint her with this discovery;\nbut only said, \"I have not the heart to take it, Trot, to-night,\" and\nshook her head, and went in again.\n\nShe read my letter to the two old ladies, in the morning, and approved\nof it. I posted it, and had nothing to do then, but wait, as patiently\nas I could, for the reply. I was still in this state of expectation, and\nhad been, for nearly a week; when I left the Doctor's one snowy night,\nto walk home.\n\nIt had been a bitter day, and a cutting north-east wind had blown for\nsome time. The wind had gone down with the light, and so the snow had\ncome on. It was a heavy, settled fall, I recollect, in great flakes; and\nit lay thick. The noise of wheels and tread of people were as hushed, as\nif the streets had been strewn that depth with feathers.\n\nMy shortest way home,--and I naturally took the shortest way on such a\nnight--was through Saint Martin's Lane. Now, the church which gives its\nname to the lane, stood in a less free situation at that time; there\nbeing no open space before it, and the lane winding down to the Strand.\nAs I passed the steps of the portico, I encountered, at the corner, a\nwoman's face. It looked in mine, passed across the narrow lane, and\ndisappeared. I knew it. I had seen it somewhere. But I could not\nremember where. I had some association with it, that struck upon my\nheart directly; but I was thinking of anything else when it came upon\nme, and was confused.\n\nOn the steps of the church, there was the stooping figure of a man, who\nhad put down some burden on the smooth snow, to adjust it; my seeing the\nface, and my seeing him, were simultaneous. I don't think I had stopped\nin my surprise; but, in any case, as I went on, he rose, turned, and\ncame down towards me. I stood face to face with Mr. Peggotty!\n\nThen I remembered the woman. It was Martha, to whom Emily had given the\nmoney that night in the kitchen. Martha Endell--side by side with whom,\nhe would not have seen his dear niece, Ham had told me, for all the\ntreasures wrecked in the sea.\n\nWe shook hands heartily. At first neither of us could speak a word.\n\n\"Mas'r Davy!\" he said, griping me tight, \"it do my art good to see you,\nsir. Well met, well met!\"\n\n\"Well met, my dear old friend!\" said I.\n\n\"I had my thowts o' coming to make inquiration for you, sir, to-night,\"\nhe said, \"but knowing as your aunt was living along wi' you--for I've\nbeen down yonder--Yarmouth way--I was afeerd it was too late. I should\nhave come early in the morning, sir, afore going away.\"\n\n\"Again?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied, patiently shaking his head, \"I'm away\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Where were you going now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well!\" he replied, shaking the snow out of his long hair, \"I was a\ngoing to turn in somewheers.\"\n\nIn those days there was a side-entrance to the stable-yard of the Golden\nCross, the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune,\nnearly opposite to where we stood. I pointed out the gateway, put my arm\nthrough his, and we went across. Two or three public-rooms opened out of\nthe stable-yard; and looking into one of them, and finding it empty, and\na good fire burning, I took him in there.\n\nWhen I saw him in the light, I observed, not only that his hair was long\nand ragged, but that his face was burnt dark by the sun. He was greyer,\nthe lines in his face and forehead were deeper, and he had every\nappearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of\nweather; but he looked very strong, and like a man upheld by\nstedfastness of purpose, whom nothing could tire out. He shook the snow\nfrom his hat and clothes, and brushed it away from his face, while I was\ninwardly making these remarks. As he sate down opposite to me at a\ntable, with his back to the door by which we had entered, he put out his\nrough hand again, and grasped mine warmly.\n\n  [Illustration: The Wanderer.]\n\n\"I'll tell you, Mas'r Davy,\" he said,--\"wheer all I've been, and\nwhat-all we've heerd. I've been fur, and we've heerd little; but I'll\ntell you!\"\n\nI rang the bell for something hot to drink. He would have nothing\nyounger than ale; and while it was being brought, and being warmed at\nthe fire, he sat thinking. There was a fine, massive gravity in his\nface, I did not venture to disturb.\n\n\"When she was a child,\" he said, lifting up his head soon after we were\nleft alone, \"she used to talk to me a deal about the sea, and about them\ncoasts where the sea got to be dark blue, and to lay a shining and a\nshining in the sun. I thowt, odd times, as her father being drownded\nmade her think on it so much. I doen't know, you see, but maybe she\nbelieved--or hoped--he had drifted out to them parts, where the flowers\nis always a blowing, and the country bright.\"\n\n\"It is likely to have been a childish fancy,\" I replied.\n\n\"When she was--lost,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"I know'd in my mind, as he\nwould take her to them countries. I know'd in my mind, as he'd have told\nher wonders of 'em, and how she was to be a lady theer, and how he got\nher listen to him first, along o'sech like. When we see his mother, I\nknow'd quite well as I was right. I went across-channel to France, and\nlanded theer, as if I'd fell down from the sky.\"\n\nI saw the door move, and the snow drift in. I saw it move a little more,\nand a hand softly interpose to keep it open.\n\n\"I found out a English gentleman as was in authority,\" said Mr.\nPeggotty, \"and told him I was a going to seek my niece. He got me them\npapers as I wanted fur to carry me through--I doen't rightly know how\nthey're called--and he would have give me money, but that I was thankful\nto have no need on. I thank him kind, for all he done, I'm sure! 'I've\nwrote afore you,' he says to me, 'and I shall speak to many as will come\nthat way, and many will know you, fur distant from here, when you're a\ntravelling alone.' I told him, best as I was able, what my gratitoode\nwas, and went away through France.\"\n\n\"Alone, and on foot?\" said I.\n\n\"Mostly a-foot,\" he rejoined; \"sometimes in carts along with people\ngoing to market; sometimes in empty coaches. Many mile a day a-foot, and\noften with some poor soldier or another, travelling to see his friends.\nI couldn't talk to him,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"nor he to me; but we was\ncompany for one another, too, along the dusty roads.\"\n\nI should have known that by his friendly tone.\n\n\"When I come to any town,\" he pursued, \"I found the inn, and waited\nabout the yard till some one turned up (some one mostly did) as know'd\nEnglish. Then I told how that I was on my way to seek my niece, and they\ntold me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house, and I waited to see\nany as seemed like her, going in or out. When it warn't Em'ly, I went on\nagen. By little and little, when I come to a new village or that, among\nthe poor people, I found they know'd about me. They would set me down at\ntheir cottage doors, and give me what-not fur to eat and drink, and show\nme where to sleep; and many a woman, Mas'r Davy, as has had a daughter\nof about Em'ly's age, I've found a-waiting for me, at Our Saviour's\nCross outside the village, fur to do me sim'lar kindnesses. Some has had\ndaughters as was dead. And God only knows how good them mothers was to\nme!\"\n\nIt was Martha at the door. I saw her haggard, listening face distinctly.\nMy dread was lest he should turn his head, and see her too.\n\n\"They would often put their children--partic'lar their little girls,\"\nsaid Mr. Peggotty, \"upon my knee; and many a time you might have seen me\nsitting at their doors, when night was coming on, a'most as if they'd\nbeen my Darling's children. Oh, my Darling!\"\n\nOverpowered by sudden grief, he sobbed aloud. I laid my trembling hand\nupon the hand he put before his face. \"Thankee, sir,\" he said, \"don't\ntake no notice.\"\n\nIn a very little while he took his hand away and put it in his breast,\nand went on with his story.\n\n\"They often walked with me,\" he said, \"in the morning, maybe a mile or\ntwo upon my road; and when we parted, and I said, 'I'm very thankful to\nyou! God bless you!' they always seemed to understand, and answered\npleasant. At last I come to the sea. It warn't hard, you may suppose,\nfor a seafaring man like me to work his way over to Italy. When I got\ntheer, I wandered on as I had done afore. The people was just as good to\nme, and I should have gone from town to town, maybe the country through,\nbut that I got news of her being seen among them Swiss mountains yonder.\nOne as know'd his servant see 'em there, all three, and told me how they\ntravelled, and where they was. I made for them mountains, Mas'r Davy,\nday and night. Ever so fur as I went, ever so fur the mountains seemed\nto shift away from me. But I come up with 'em, and I crossed 'em. When I\ngot nigh the place as I had been told of, I began to think within my own\nself, 'What shall I do when I see her?'\"\n\nThe listening face, insensible to the inclement night, still drooped at\nthe door, and the hands begged me--prayed me--not to cast it forth.\n\n\"I never doubted her,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"No! not a bit! On'y let her\nsee my face--on'y let her heer my voice--on'y let my stanning still\nafore her bring to her thoughts the home she had fled away from, and the\nchild she had been--and if she had growed to be a royal lady, she'd have\nfell down at my feet! I know'd it well! Many a time in my sleep had I\nheerd her cry out, 'Uncle!' and seen her fall like death afore me. Many\na time in my sleep had I raised her up, and whispered to her, 'Em'ly my\ndear, I am come fur to bring forgiveness, and to take you home!'\"\n\nHe stopped and shook his head, and went on with a sigh.\n\n\"_He_ was nowt to me now. Em'ly was all. I bought a country dress to put\nupon her; and I know'd that, once found, she would walk beside me over\nthem stony roads, go where I would, and never, never, leave me more. To\nput that dress upon her, and to cast off what she wore--to take her on\nmy arm again, and wander towards home--to stop sometimes upon the road,\nand heal her bruised feet and her worse-bruised heart--was all that I\nthowt of now. I doen't believe I should have done so much as look at\nhim. But, Mas'r Davy, it warn't to be--not yet! I was too late, and they\nwas gone. Wheer, I couldn't learn. Some said heer, some said theer. I\ntravelled heer, and I travelled theer, but I found no Em'ly, and I\ntravelled home.\"\n\n\"How long ago?\" I asked.\n\n\"A matter o' fower days,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"I sighted the old boat\narter dark, and the light a shining in the winder. When I come nigh and\nlooked in through the glass, I see the faithful creetur Missis Gummidge\nsittin' by the fire, as we had fixed upon, alone. I called out, 'Doen't\nbe afeerd! It's Dan'l!' and I went in. I never could have thowt the old\nboat would have been so strange!\"\n\nFrom some pocket in his breast, he took out, with a very careful hand, a\nsmall paper bundle containing two or three letters or little packets,\nwhich he laid upon the table.\n\n\"This first one come,\" he said, selecting it from the rest, \"afore I had\nbeen gone a week. A fifty pound Bank note, in a sheet of paper, directed\nto me, and put underneath the door in the night. She tried to hide her\nwriting, but she couldn't hide it from Me!\"\n\nHe folded up the note again, with great patience and care, in exactly\nthe same form, and laid it on one side.\n\n\"This come to Missis Gummidge,\" he said, opening another, \"two or three\nmonths ago.\" After looking at it for some moments, he gave it to me, and\nadded in a low voice, \"Be so good as read it, sir.\"\n\nI read as follows:\n\n     \"Oh what will you feel when you see this writing, and know it\n     comes from my wicked hand! But try, try--not for my sake, but for\n     uncle's goodness, try to let your heart soften to me, only for a\n     little little time! Try, pray do, to relent towards a miserable\n     girl, and write down on a bit of paper whether he is well, and\n     what he said about me before you left off ever naming me among\n     yourselves--and whether, of a night, when it is my old time of\n     coming home, you ever see him look as if he thought of one he used\n     to love so dear. Oh, my heart is breaking when I think about it! I\n     am kneeling down to you, begging and praying you not to be as hard\n     with me as I deserve--as I well, well, know I deserve--but to be\n     so gentle and so good, as to write down something of him, and to\n     send it to me. You need not call me Little, you need not call me\n     by the name I have disgraced; but oh, listen to my agony, and have\n     mercy on me so far as to write me some word of uncle, never, never\n     to be seen in this world by my eyes again!\n\n     \"Dear, if your heart is hard towards me--justly hard, I know--but,\n     Listen, if it is hard, dear, ask him I have wronged the most--him\n     whose wife I was to have been--before you quite decide against my\n     poor poor prayer! If he should be so compassionate as to say that\n     you might write something for me to read--I think he would, oh, I\n     think he would, if you would only ask him, for he always was so\n     brave and so forgiving--tell him then (but not else), that when\n     I hear the wind blowing at night, I feel as if it was passing\n     angrily from seeing him and uncle, and was going up to God against\n     me. Tell him that if I was to die to-morrow (and oh, if I was fit,\n     I would be so glad to die!) I would bless him and uncle with my\n     last words, and pray for his happy home with my last breath!\"\n\nSome money was inclosed in this letter also. Five pounds. It was\nuntouched like the previous sum, and he refolded it in the same way.\nDetailed instructions were added relative to the address of a reply,\nwhich, although they betrayed the intervention of several hands, and\nmade it difficult to arrive at any very probable conclusion in reference\nto her place of concealment, made it at least not unlikely that she had\nwritten from that spot where she was stated to have been seen.\n\n\"What answer was sent?\" I inquired of Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Missis Gummidge,\" he returned, \"not being a good scholar, sir, Ham\nkindly drawed it out, and she made a copy on it. They told her I was\ngone to seek her, and what my parting words was.\"\n\n\"Is that another letter in your hand?\" said I.\n\n\"It's money, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty, unfolding it a little way. \"Ten\npound, you see. And wrote inside, 'From a true friend,' like the first.\nBut the first was put underneath the door, and this come by the post,\nday afore yesterday. I'm a going to seek her at the post-mark.\"\n\nHe showed it to me. It was a town on the Upper Rhine. He had found out,\nat Yarmouth, some foreign dealers who knew that country, and they had\ndrawn him a rude map on paper, which he could very well understand. He\nlaid it between us on the table; and, with his chin resting on one hand,\ntracked his course upon it with the other.\n\nI asked him how Ham was? He shook his head.\n\n\"He works,\" he said, \"as bold as a man can. His name's as good, in all\nthat part, as any man's is, anywheres in the wureld. Anyone's hand is\nready to help him, you understand, and his is ready to help them. He's\nnever been heerd fur to complain. But my sister's belief is ('twixt\nourselves) as it has cut him deep.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow, I can believe it!\"\n\n\"He ain't no care, Mas'r Davy,\" said Mr. Peggotty in a solemn\nwhisper--\"keinder no care no-how for his life. When a man's wanted for\nrough service in rough weather, he's theer. When there's hard duty to be\ndone with danger in it, he steps forward afore all his mates. And yet\nhe's as gentle as any child. There ain't a child in Yarmouth that doen't\nknow him.\"\n\nHe gathered up the letters thoughtfully, smoothing them with his hand;\nput them into their little bundle; and placed it tenderly in his breast\nagain. The face was gone from the door. I still saw the snow drifting\nin; but nothing else was there.\n\n\"Well!\" he said, looking to his bag, \"having seen you to-night, Mas'r\nDavy (and that doos me good!) I shall away betimes to-morrow morning.\nYou have seen what I've got heer;\" putting his hand on where the little\npacket lay; \"all that troubles me is, to think that any harm might come\nto me, afore that money was give back. If I was to die, and it was lost,\nor stole, or elseways made away with, and it was never knowed by him but\nwhat I'd took it, I believe the t'other wureld wouldn't hold me! I\nbelieve I must come back!\"\n\nHe rose, and I rose too; we grasped each other by the hand again, before\ngoing out.\n\n\"I'd go ten thousand mile,\" he said, \"I'd go till I dropped dead, to lay\nthat money down afore him. If I do that, and find my Em'ly, I'm content.\nIf I doen't find her, maybe she'll come to hear, sometime, as her loving\nuncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life; and if I\nknow her, even that will turn her home at last!\"\n\nAs we went out into the rigorous night, I saw the lonely figure flit\naway before us. I turned him hastily on some pretence, and held him in\nconversation until it was gone.\n\nHe spoke of a traveller's house on the Dover road, where he knew he\ncould find a clean, plain lodging for the night. I went with him over\nWestminster Bridge, and parted from him on the Surrey shore. Everything\nseemed, to my imagination, to be hushed in reverence for him, as he\nresumed his solitary journey through the snow.\n\nI returned to the inn yard, and, impressed by my remembrance of the\nface, looked awfully around for it. It was not there. The snow had\ncovered our late footprints; my new track was the only one to be seen;\nand even that began to die away (it snowed so fast) as I looked back\nover my shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nDORA'S AUNTS.\n\n\nAt last, an answer came from the two old ladies. They presented their\ncompliments to Mr. Copperfield, and informed him that they had given his\nletter their best consideration, \"with a view to the happiness of both\nparties\"--which I thought rather an alarming expression, not only\nbecause of the use they had made of it in relation to the family\ndifference before-mentioned, but because I had (and have all my life)\nobserved that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks, easily let\noff, and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colors not at all\nsuggested by their original form. The Misses Spenlow added that they\nbegged to forbear expressing, \"through the medium of correspondence,\" an\nopinion on the subject of Mr. Copperfield's communication; but that if\nMr. Copperfield would do them the favor to call, upon a certain day,\n(accompanied, if he thought proper, by a confidential friend), they\nwould be happy to hold some conversation on the subject.\n\nTo this favor, Mr. Copperfield immediately replied, with his respectful\ncompliments, that he would have the honor of waiting on the Misses\nSpenlow, at the time appointed; accompanied, in accordance with their\nkind permission, by his friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple.\nHaving dispatched which missive, Mr. Copperfield fell into a condition\nof strong nervous agitation; and so remained until the day arrived.\n\nIt was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved, at this\neventful crisis, of the inestimable services of Miss Mills. But Mr.\nMills, who was always doing something or other to annoy me--or I felt as\nif he were, which was the same thing--had brought his conduct to a\nclimax, by taking it into his head that he would go to India. Why should\nhe go to India, except to harass me? To be sure he had nothing to do\nwith any other part of the world, and had a good deal to do with that\npart; being entirely in the India trade, whatever that was (I had\nfloating dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephant's teeth);\nhaving been at Calcutta in his youth; and designing now to go out there\nagain, in the capacity of resident partner. But this was nothing to me.\nHowever, it was so much to him that for India he was bound, and Julia\nwith him; and Julia went into the country to take leave of her\nrelations; and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills,\nannouncing that it was to be let or sold, and that the furniture (Mangle\nand all) was to be taken at a valuation. So, here was another earthquake\nof which I became the sport, before I had recovered from the shock of\nits predecessor!\n\nI was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day; being\ndivided between my desire to appear to advantage, and my apprehensions\nof putting on anything that might impair my severely practical\ncharacter in the eyes of the Misses Spenlow. I endeavoured to hit a\nhappy medium between these two extremes; my aunt approved the result;\nand Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles and me, for luck,\nas we went down-stairs.\n\nExcellent fellow as I knew Traddles to be, and warmly attached to him\nas I was, I could not help wishing, on that delicate occasion, that he\nhad never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright.\nIt gave him a surprised look--not to say a hearth-broomy kind of\nexpression--which, my apprehensions whispered, might be fatal to us.\n\nI took the liberty of mentioning it to Traddles, as we were walking to\nPutney; and saying that if he _would_ smooth it down a little--\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Traddles, lifting off his hat, and rubbing\nhis hair all kinds of ways, \"nothing would give me greater pleasure. But\nit won't.\"\n\n\"Won't be smoothed down?\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" said Traddles. \"Nothing will induce it. If I was to carry a\nhalf-hundred-weight upon it, all the way to Putney, it would be up\nagain the moment the weight was taken off. You have no idea what\nobstinate hair mine is, Copperfield. I am quite a fretful porcupine.\"\n\nI was a little disappointed, I must confess, but thoroughly charmed by\nhis good-nature too. I told him how I esteemed his good-nature; and said\nthat his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character,\nfor _he_ had none.\n\n\"Oh!\" returned Traddles, laughing, \"I assure you, it's quite an old\nstory, my unfortunate hair. My uncle's wife couldn't bear it. She said\nit exasperated her. It stood very much in my way, too, when I first fell\nin love with Sophy. Very much!\"\n\n\"Did she object to it?\"\n\n\"_She_ didn't,\" rejoined Traddles; \"but her eldest sister--the one\nthat's the Beauty--quite made game of it, I understand. In fact, all the\nsisters laugh at it.\"\n\n\"Agreeable!\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Traddles with perfect innocence, \"it's a joke for us.\nThey pretend that Sophy has a lock of it in her desk, and is obliged to\nshut it in a clasped book, to keep it down. We laugh about it.\"\n\n\"By-the-bye, my dear Traddles,\" said I, \"your experience may suggest\nsomething to me. When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have\njust mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family? Was there\nanything like--what we are going through to-day, for instance?\" I added,\nnervously.\n\n\"Why,\" replied Traddles, on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had\nstolen, \"it was rather a painful transaction, Copperfield, in my case.\nYou see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could\nendure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite\nsettled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they\ncalled her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the\ngreatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler--\"\n\n\"The mamma?\" said I.\n\n\"The mamma,\" said Traddles--\"Reverend Horace Crewler--when I mentioned\nit with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her\nwas such that she gave a scream and became insensible. I couldn't\napproach the subject again, for months.\"\n\n\"You did at last?\" said I.\n\n\"Well, the Reverend Horace did,\" said Traddles. \"He is an excellent man,\nmost exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought,\nas a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it\nwas so uncertain), and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me. As to\nmyself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey\ntowards the family.\"\n\n\"The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?\"\n\n\"Why, I can't say they did,\" he returned. \"When we had comparatively\nreconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You\nrecollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter\nwith her spine?\"\n\n\"Perfectly!\"\n\n\"She clenched both her hands,\" said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;\n\"shut her eyes; turned lead-color; became perfectly stiff; and took\nnothing for two days, but toast-and-water administered with a teaspoon.\"\n\n\"What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!\" I remarked.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!\" said Traddles. \"She is a very\ncharming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all\nhave. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent\nwhile she was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I know\nit must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which were\nlike a criminal's. After Sarah was restored, we still had to break it to\nthe other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most\npathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Sophy educates, have only\njust left off de-testing me.\"\n\n\"At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?\" said I.\n\n\"Ye--yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it,\" said\nTraddles, doubtfully. \"The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject; and\nmy unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great\nconsolation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we are\nmarried. It will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding. And\nthey'll all hate me for taking her away!\"\n\nHis honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his\nhead, impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality,\nfor I was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation and\nwandering of mind, as to be quite unable to fix my attention on\nanything. On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived, I\nwas at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of\nmind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass\nof ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he\nconducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow's door.\n\nI had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid\nopened it; and of wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass\nin it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding\na neat garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing\nTraddles's hair start up, now his hat was removed, like one of those\nobtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious\nsnuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned\nclock ticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time\nto the jerking of my heart,--which it wouldn't. Also of looking round\nthe room for any sign of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that\nJip once barked in the distance, and was instantly choked by somebody.\nUltimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fire-place, and\nbowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in\nblack, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of\nthe late Mr. Spenlow.\n\n\"Pray,\" said one of the two little ladies, \"be seated.\"\n\nWhen I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something\nwhich was not a cat--my first seat was--I so far recovered my sight,\nas to perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the\nfamily; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the\ntwo sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the\nconference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand--so familiar as\nit looked to me, and yet so odd!--and was referring to it through an\neye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress\nwith a more youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more\nfrill, or tucker, or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that\nkind, which made her look more lively. They were both upright in their\ncarriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had not\nmy letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each\nother, like an Idol.\n\n  [Illustration: Traddles and I, in conference with the Misses Spenlow.]\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield, I believe,\" said the sister who had got my letter,\naddressing herself to Traddles.\n\nThis was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr.\nCopperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest\nthemselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield,\nand altogether we were in a nice condition. To improve it, we all\ndistinctly heard Jip give two short barks, and receive another choke.\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield!\" said the sister with the letter.\n\nI did something--bowed, I suppose--and was all attention, when the other\nsister struck in.\n\n\"My sister Lavinia,\" said she, \"being conversant with matters of this\nnature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the\nhappiness of both parties.\"\n\nI discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs of\nthe heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr.\nPidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured\nof her. My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous\nassumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such\nsentiments--to which he had never given any sort of expression that I\ncould ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a\nsuperstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he\nhad not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking\nhis constitution, and overdoing an attempt to set it right again by\nswilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of\nsecret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house\nwith a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed\nupon.\n\n\"We will not,\" said Miss Lavinia, \"enter on the past history of this\nmatter. Our poor brother Francis's death has cancelled that.\"\n\n\"We had not,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"been in the habit of frequent\nassociation with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division\nor disunion between us. Francis took his road; we took ours. We\nconsidered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should\nbe so. And it was so.\"\n\nEach of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head\nafter speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa\nnever moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her\nfingers--minuets and marches I should think--but never moved them.\n\n\"Our niece's position, or supposed position, is much changed by our\nbrother Francis's death,\" said Miss Lavinia; \"and therefore we consider\nour brother's opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We\nhave no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman\npossessed of good qualities and honorable character; or that you have an\naffection--or are fully persuaded that you have an affection--for our\nniece.\"\n\nI replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had\never loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance\nwith a confirmatory murmur.\n\nMiss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa,\nwho appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother\nFrancis, struck in again:\n\n\"If Dora's mamma,\" she said, \"when she married our brother Francis, had\nat once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table,\nit would have been better for the happiness of all parties.\"\n\n\"Sister Clarissa,\" said Miss Lavinia. \"Perhaps we needn't mind that\nnow.\"\n\n\"Sister Lavinia,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"it belongs to the subject. With\nyour branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to speak, I\nshould not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I have a\nvoice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness of all\nparties, if Dora's mamma, when she married our brother Francis, had\nmentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have known\nwhat we had to expect. We should have said 'pray do not invite us, at\nany time;' and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been\navoided.\"\n\nWhen Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again\nreferring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little\nbright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds' eyes.\nThey were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden\nmanner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like\ncanaries.\n\nMiss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:\n\n\"You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,\nto visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.\"\n\n\"If our brother Francis,\" said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I\nmay call anything so calm a breaking out, \"wished to surround himself\nwith an atmosphere of Doctors' Commons, and of Doctors' Commons only,\nwhat right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever\nbeen far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on any one. But why not say\nso? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let my\nsister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for\nourselves, I hope!\"\n\nAs this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and I\nmade some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,\nmyself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don't in the\nleast know what I meant.\n\n\"Sister Lavinia,\" said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, \"you\ncan go on, my dear.\"\n\nMiss Lavinia proceeded:\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful indeed\nin considering this letter; and we have not considered it without\nfinally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We\nhave no doubt that you think you like her very much.\"\n\n\"Think, ma'am,\" I rapturously began, \"oh!----\"\n\nBut Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as\nrequesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon.\n\n\"Affection,\" said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for\ncorroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every\nclause, \"mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express\nitself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush,\nwaits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away,\nand finds it still ripening in the shade.\"\n\nOf course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her\nsupposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity\nwith which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached\nto these words.\n\n\"The light--for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the\nlight--inclinations of very young people,\" pursued Miss Lavinia, \"are\ndust, compared to rocks. It is owing to the difficulty of knowing\nwhether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that my\nsister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act, Mr.\nCopperfield, and Mr.----\"\n\n\"Traddles,\" said my friend, finding himself looked at.\n\n\"I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe?\" said Miss Clarissa,\nagain glancing at my letter.\n\nTraddles said, \"Exactly so,\" and became pretty red in the face.\n\nNow, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I\nfancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss\nLavinia, an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of\ndomestic interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition\nto pet it, in which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought I\nperceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in\nsuperintending two young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss\nClarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend\nus, and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject\nwhenever that impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to\nprotest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or\nany one believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt,\nAgnes, Traddles, every one who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how\nearnest my love had made me. For the truth of this, I appealed to\nTraddles. And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a\nParliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good\nround terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently\nmade a favorable impression.\n\n\"I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little\nexperience of such things,\" said Traddles, \"being myself engaged to a\nyoung lady--one of ten, down in Devonshire--and seeing no probability,\nat present, of our engagement coming to a termination.\"\n\n\"You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,\" observed\nMiss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, \"of the affection\nthat is modest and retiring; that waits and waits?\"\n\n\"Entirely, ma'am,\" said Traddles.\n\nMiss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss\nLavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh.\n\n\"Sister Lavinia,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"take my smelling-bottle.\"\n\nMiss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic\nvinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and\nthen went on to say, rather faintly:\n\n\"My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what\ncourse we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary\nlikings, of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield, and\nour niece.\"\n\n\"Our brother Francis's child,\" remarked Miss Clarissa. \"If our brother\nFrancis's wife had found it convenient in her life-time (though she had\nan unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family\nto her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis's child\nbetter at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.\"\n\nMiss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards\nherself, and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking\nnotes she had made on that part of it.\n\n\"It seems to us,\" said she, \"prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these\nfeelings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing\nof them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there may\nbe in them. Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr.\nCopperfield's proposal, as to admit his visits here.\"\n\n\"I shall never, dear ladies,\" I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load\nof apprehension, \"forget your kindness!\"\n\n\"But,\" pursued Miss Lavinia,--\"but, we would prefer to regard those\nvisits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard\nourselves from recognising any positive engagement between Mr.\nCopperfield and our niece, until we have had an opportunity--\"\n\n\"Until _you_ have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia,\" said Miss\nClarissa.\n\n\"Be it so,\" assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh,--\"until I have had an\nopportunity of observing them.\"\n\n\"Copperfield,\" said Traddles, turning to me, \"you feel, I am sure, that\nnothing could be more reasonable or considerate.\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" cried I. \"I am deeply sensible of it.\"\n\n\"In this position of affairs,\" said Miss Lavinia, again referring to her\nnotes, \"and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we must\nrequire from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of honor,\nthat no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our\nniece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be\nentertained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to\nus--\"\n\n\"To you, sister Lavinia,\" Miss Clarissa interposed.\n\n\"Be it so, Clarissa!\" assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--\"to me--and\nreceiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious\nstipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield\nto be accompanied by some confidential friend to-day,\" with an\ninclination of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, \"in order that\nthere might be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr.\nCopperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving\nthis promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.\"\n\nI exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervor, that not a moment's\nconsideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required\npromise, in a most impassioned manner; called upon Traddles to witness\nit; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever\nswerved from it in the least degree.\n\n\"Stay!\" said Miss Lavinia, holding up her hand; \"we resolved, before we\nhad the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen, to leave you alone for\na quarter of an hour, to consider this point. You will allow us to\nretire.\"\n\nIt was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary. They\npersisted in withdrawing for the specified time. Accordingly, these\nlittle birds hopped out with great dignity; leaving me to receive the\ncongratulations of Traddles, and to feel as if I were translated to\nregions of exquisite happiness. Exactly at the expiration of the quarter\nof an hour, they reappeared with no less dignity than they had\ndisappeared. They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were\nmade of autumn-leaves: and they came rustling back, in like manner.\n\nI then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions.\n\n\"Sister Clarissa,\" said Miss Lavinia, \"the rest is with you.\"\n\nMiss Clarissa, unfolding her arms for the first time, took the notes and\nglanced at them.\n\n\"We shall be happy,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"to see Mr. Copperfield to\ndinner, every Sunday, if it should suit his convenience. Our hour is\nthree.\"\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"In the course of the week,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"we shall be happy to\nsee Mr. Copperfield to tea. Our hour is half-past six.\"\n\nI bowed again.\n\n\"Twice in the week,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"but, as a rule, not oftener.\"\n\nI bowed again.\n\n\"Miss Trotwood,\" said Miss Clarissa, \"mentioned in Mr. Copperfield's\nletter, will perhaps call upon us. When visiting is better for the\nhappiness of all parties, we are glad to receive visits, and return\nthem. When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no\nvisiting should take place, (as in the case of our brother Francis, and\nhis establishment) that is quite different.\"\n\nI intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their\nacquaintance; though I must say I was not quite sure of their getting on\nvery satisfactorily together. The conditions being now closed, I\nexpressed my acknowledgments in the warmest manner; and, taking the\nhand, first of Miss Clarissa, and then of Miss Lavinia, pressed it, in\neach case, to my lips.\n\nMiss Lavinia then arose, and begging Mr. Traddles to excuse us for a\nminute, requested me to follow her. I obeyed, all in a tremble, and was\nconducted into another room. There, I found my blessed darling stopping\nher ears behind the door, with her dear little face against the wall;\nand Jip in the plate-warmer with his head tied up in a towel.\n\nOh! How beautiful she was in her black frock, and how she sobbed and\ncried at first, and wouldn't come out from behind the door! How fond we\nwere of one another, when she did come out at last; and what a state of\nbliss I was in, when we took Jip out of the plate-warmer, and restored\nhim to the light, sneezing very much, and were all three reunited!\n\n\"My dearest Dora! Now, indeed, my own for ever!\"\n\n\"Oh DON'T!\" pleaded Dora. \"Please!\"\n\n\"Are you not my own for ever, Dora?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course I am!\" cried Dora, \"but I am so frightened!\"\n\n\"Frightened, my own?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! I don't like him,\" said Dora. \"Why don't he go?\"\n\n\"Who, my life?\"\n\n\"Your friend,\" said Dora. \"It isn't any business of his. What a stupid\nhe must be!\"\n\n\"My love!\" (There never was anything so coaxing as her childish ways.)\n\"He is the best creature!\"\n\n\"Oh, but we don't want any best creatures!\" pouted Dora.\n\n\"My dear,\" I argued, \"you will soon know him well, and like him of all\nthings. And here is my aunt coming soon; and you'll like her of all\nthings too, when you know her.\"\n\n\"No, please don't bring her!\" said Dora, giving me a horrified\nlittle kiss, and folding her hands. \"Don't. I know she's a naughty,\nmischief-making old thing! Don't let her come here, Doady!\" which was a\ncorruption of David.\n\nRemonstrance was of no use, then; so I laughed, and admired, and was\nvery much in love and very happy; and she showed me Jip's new trick of\nstanding on his hind legs in a corner--which he did for about the space\nof a flash of lightning, and then fell down--and I don't know how long I\nshould have stayed there, oblivious of Traddles, if Miss Lavinia had not\ncome in to take me away. Miss Lavinia was very fond of Dora (she told me\nDora was exactly like what she had been herself at her age--she must\nhave altered a good deal), and she treated Dora just as if she had been\na toy. I wanted to persuade Dora to come and see Traddles, but on my\nproposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in; so I\nwent to Traddles without her, and walked away with him on air.\n\n\"Nothing could be more satisfactory,\" said Traddles; \"and they are very\nagreeable old ladies, I am sure. I shouldn't be at all surprised if you\nwere to be married years before me, Copperfield.\"\n\n\"Does your Sophy play on any instrument, Traddles?\" I enquired, in the\npride of my heart.\n\n\"She knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters,\" said\nTraddles.\n\n\"Does she sing at all?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, she sings ballads, sometimes, to freshen up the others a little\nwhen they're out of spirits,\" said Traddles. \"Nothing scientific.\"\n\n\"She doesn't sing to the guitar?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh dear no!\" said Traddles.\n\n\"Paint at all?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Traddles.\n\nI promised Traddles that he should hear Dora sing, and see some of her\nflower-painting. He said he should like it very much, and we went home\narm in arm in great good humour and delight. I encouraged him to talk\nabout Sophy, on the way; which he did with a loving reliance on her that\nI very much admired. I compared her in my mind with Dora, with\nconsiderable inward satisfaction; but I candidly admitted to myself that\nshe seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for Traddles, too.\n\nOf course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful\nissue of the conference, and with all that had been said and done in the\ncourse of it. She was happy to see me so happy, and promised to call on\nDora's aunts without loss of time. But she took such a long walk up and\ndown our rooms that night, while I was writing to Agnes, that I began to\nthink she meant to walk till morning.\n\nMy letter to Agnes was a fervent and grateful one, narrating all the\ngood effects that had resulted from my following her advice. She wrote,\nby return of post, to me. Her letter was hopeful, earnest, and cheerful.\nShe was always cheerful from that time.\n\nI had my hands more full than ever, now. My daily journies to Highgate\nconsidered, Putney was a long way off; and I naturally wanted to go\nthere as often as I could. The proposed tea-drinkings being quite\nimpracticable, I compounded with Miss Lavinia for permission to visit\nevery Saturday afternoon, without detriment to my privileged Sundays.\nSo, the close of every week was a delicious time for me; and I got\nthrough the rest of the week by looking forward to it.\n\nI was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora's aunts rubbed\non, all things considered, much more smoothly than I could have\nexpected. My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the\nconference; and within a few more days, Dora's aunts called upon her, in\ndue state and form. Similar but more friendly exchanges took place\nafterwards, usually at intervals of three or four weeks. I know that my\naunt distressed Dora's aunts very much, by utterly setting at naught the\ndignity of fly-conveyance, and walking out to Putney at extraordinary\ntimes, as shortly after breakfast or just before tea; likewise by\nwearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her\nhead, without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilisation on that\nsubject. But Dora's aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric\nand somewhat masculine lady, with a strong understanding; and although\nmy aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora's aunts, by expressing\nheretical opinions on various points of ceremony, she loved me too well\nnot to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general\nharmony.\n\nThe only member of our small society, who positively refused to adapt\nhimself to circumstances, was Jip. He never saw my aunt without\nimmediately displaying every tooth in his head, retiring under a chair,\nand growling incessantly: with now and then a doleful howl, as if she\nreally were too much for his feelings. All kinds of treatment were tried\nwith him, coaxing, scolding, slapping, bringing him to Buckingham Street\n(where he instantly dashed at the two cats, to the terror of all\nbeholders); but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt's\nsociety. He would sometimes think he had got the better of his\nobjection, and be amiable for a few minutes; and then would put up his\nsnub nose, and howl to that extent, that there was nothing for it but to\nblind him and put him in the plate-warmer. At length, Dora regularly\nmuffled him in a towel and shut him up there, whenever my aunt was\nreported at the door.\n\nOne thing troubled me much, after we had fallen into this quiet train.\nIt was, that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy\nor plaything. My aunt, with whom she gradually became familiar, always\ncalled her Little Blossom; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia's life was\nto wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments for her, and treat her\nlike a pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sister did as a matter of\ncourse. It was very odd to me; but they all seemed to treat Dora, in her\ndegree, much as Dora treated Jip in his.\n\nI made up my mind to speak to Dora about this; and one day when we were\nout walking (for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia, after a while, to go\nout walking by ourselves), I said to her that I wished she could get\nthem to behave towards her differently.\n\n\"Because you know, my darling,\" I remonstrated, \"you are not a child.\"\n\n\"There!\" said Dora. \"Now you're going to be cross!\"\n\n\"Cross, my love?\"\n\n\"I am sure they're very kind to me,\" said Dora, \"and I am very happy.\"\n\n\"Well! But my dearest life!\" said I, \"you might be very happy, and yet\nbe treated rationally.\"\n\nDora gave me a reproachful look--the prettiest look!--and then began to\nsob, saying if I didn't like her, why had I ever wanted so much to be\nengaged to her? And why didn't I go away, now, if I couldn't bear her?\n\nWhat could I do, but kiss away her tears, and tell her how I doted on\nher, after that!\n\n\"I am sure I am very affectionate,\" said Dora; \"you oughtn't to be cruel\nto me, Doady!\"\n\n\"Cruel, my precious love! As if I would--or could--be cruel to you, for\nthe world!\"\n\n\"Then don't find fault with me,\" said Dora, making a rosebud of her\nmouth; \"and I'll be good.\"\n\nI was charmed by her presently asking me, of her own accord, to give her\nthat cookery-book I had once spoken of, and to show her how to keep\naccounts as I had once promised I would. I brought the volume with me on\nmy next visit (I got it prettily bound, first, to make it look less dry\nand more inviting); and as we strolled about the Common, I showed her an\nold housekeeping-book of my aunt's, and gave her a set of tablets, and a\npretty little pencil case and box of leads, to practise housekeeping\nwith.\n\nBut the cookery-book made Dora's head ache, and the figures made her\ncry. They wouldn't add up, she said. So she rubbed them out, and drew\nlittle nosegays, and likenesses of me and Jip, all over the tablets.\n\nThen I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we\nwalked about on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when we\npassed a butcher's shop, I would say:\n\n\"Now suppose, my pet, that we were married, and you were going to buy a\nshoulder of mutton for dinner, would you know how to buy it?\"\n\nMy pretty little Dora's face would fall, and she would make her mouth\ninto a bud again, as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a\nkiss.\n\n\"Would you know how to buy it, my darling?\" I would repeat, perhaps, if\nI were very inflexible.\n\nDora would think a little, and then reply, perhaps, with great triumph:\n\n\"Why, the butcher would know how to sell it, and what need _I_ know? Oh,\nyou silly boy!\"\n\nSo, when I once asked Dora, with an eye to the cookery-book, what she\nwould do, if we were married, and I were to say I should like a nice\nIrish stew, she replied that she would tell the servant to make it; and\nthen clapped her little hands together across my arm, and laughed in\nsuch a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever.\n\nConsequently, the principal use to which the cookery-book was devoted,\nwas being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon. But Dora was so\npleased, when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to\ncome off, and at the same time to hold the pencil case in his mouth,\nthat I was very glad I had bought it.\n\nAnd we fell back on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the\nsongs about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la! and were as happy as\nthe week was long. I occasionally wished I could venture to hint to\nMiss Lavinia, that she treated the darling of my heart a little too\nmuch like a plaything; and I sometimes awoke, as it were, wondering to\nfind that I had fallen into the general fault, and treated her like a\nplaything too--but not often.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nMISCHIEF.\n\n\nI feel as if it were not for me to record, even though this manuscript\nis intended for no eyes but mine, how hard I worked at that tremendous\nshort-hand, and all improvement appertaining to it, in my sense of\nresponsibility to Dora and her aunts. I will only add, to what I have\nalready written of my perseverance at this time of my life, and of a\npatient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within me,\nand which I know to be the strong part of my character, if it have any\nstrength at all, that there, on looking back, I find the source of my\nsuccess. I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have\nworked much harder, and not succeeded half so well; but I never could\nhave done what I have done, without the habits of punctuality, order,\nand diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one\nobject at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come upon\nits heels, which I then formed. Heaven knows I write this, in no spirit\nof self-laudation. The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine, in\ngoing on here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man\nindeed, if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents\nneglected, many opportunities wasted, many erratic and perverted\nfeelings constantly at war within his breast, and defeating him. I do\nnot hold one natural gift, I dare say, that I have not abused. My\nmeaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have\ntried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself\nto, I have devoted myself to completely; that, in great aims and in\nsmall, I have always been thoroughly in earnest. I have never believed\nit possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from\nthe companionship of the steady, plain, hard-working qualities, and hope\nto gain its end. There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this\nearth. Some happy talent, and some fortunate opportunity, may form the\ntwo sides of the ladder on which some men mount, but the rounds of that\nladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear; and there is no\nsubstitute for thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never to\nput one hand to anything, on which I could throw my whole self; and\nnever to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was; I find, now,\nto have been my golden rules.\n\nHow much of the practice I have just reduced to precept, I owe to Agnes,\nI will not repeat here. My narrative proceeds to Agnes, with a thankful\nlove.\n\nShe came on a visit of a fortnight to the Doctor's. Mr. Wickfield was\nthe Doctor's old friend, and the Doctor wished to talk with him, and do\nhim good. It had been matter of conversation with Agnes when she was\nlast in town, and this visit was the result. She and her father came\ntogether. I was not much surprised to hear from her that she had engaged\nto find a lodging in the neighbourhood for Mrs. Heep, whose rheumatic\ncomplaint required change of air, and who would be charmed to have it in\nsuch company. Neither was I surprised when, on the very next day, Uriah,\nlike a dutiful son, brought his worthy mother to take possession.\n\n\"You see, Master Copperfield,\" said he, as he forced himself upon my\ncompany for a turn in the Doctor's garden, \"where a person loves, a\nperson is a little jealous--leastways, anxious to keep an eye on the\nbeloved one.\"\n\n\"Of whom are you jealous, now?\" said I.\n\n\"Thanks to you, Master Copperfield,\" he returned, \"of no one in\nparticular just at present--no male person, at least.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person?\"\n\nHe gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes, and laughed.\n\n\"Really, Master Copperfield,\" he said, \"--I should say Mister, but I\nknow you'll excuse the abit I've got into--you're so insinuating, that\nyou draw me like a corkscrew! Well, I don't mind telling you,\" putting\nhis fish-like hand on mine, \"I'm not a lady's man in general, sir, and I\nnever was, with Mrs. Strong.\"\n\nHis eyes looked green now, as they watched mine with a rascally cunning.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, though I am a lawyer, Master Copperfield,\" he replied, with a dry\ngrin, \"I mean, just at present, what I say.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean by your look?\" I retorted, quietly.\n\n\"By my look? Dear me, Copperfield, that's sharp practice! What do I mean\nby my look?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"By your look.\"\n\nHe seemed very much amused, and laughed as heartily as it was in his\nnature to laugh. After some scraping of his chin with his hand, he went\non to say, with his eyes cast downward--still scraping, very slowly:\n\n\"When I was but a numble clerk, she always looked down upon me. She was\nfor ever having my Agnes backwards and forwards at her ouse, and she was\nfor ever being a friend to you, Master Copperfield; but I was too far\nbeneath her, myself, to be noticed.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said I; \"suppose you were!\"\n\n\"--And beneath him, too,\" pursued Uriah, very distinctly, and in a\nmeditative tone of voice, as he continued to scrape his chin.\n\n\"Don't you know the Doctor better,\" said I, \"than to suppose him\nconscious of your existence, when you were not before him?\"\n\nHe directed his eyes at me in that sidelong glance again, and he made\nhis face very lantern-jawed, for the greater convenience of scraping, as\nhe answered:\n\n\"Oh dear, I am not referring to the Doctor! Oh no, poor man! I mean Mr.\nMaldon!\"\n\nMy heart quite died within me. All my old doubts and apprehensions on\nthat subject, all the Doctor's happiness and peace, all the mingled\npossibilities of innocence and compromise, that I could not unravel, I\nsaw, in a moment, at the mercy of this fellow's twisting.\n\n\"He never could come into the office, without ordering and shoving me\nabout,\" said Uriah. \"One of your fine gentlemen he was! I was very meek\nand umble--and I am. But I didn't like that sort of thing--and I don't!\"\n\nHe left off scraping his chin, and sucked in his cheeks until they\nseemed to meet inside; keeping his sidelong glance upon me all the\nwhile.\n\n\"She is one of your lovely women, she is,\" he pursued, when he had\nslowly restored his face to its natural form; \"and ready to be no friend\nto such as me, _I_ know. She's just the person as would put my Agnes up\nto higher sort of game. Now, I ain't one of your lady's men, Master\nCopperfield; but I've had eyes in my ed, a pretty long time back. We\numble ones have got eyes, mostly speaking--and we look out of 'em.\"\n\nI endeavoured to appear unconscious and not disquieted, but, I saw in\nhis face, with poor success.\n\n\"Now, I'm not a going to let myself be run down, Copperfield,\" he\ncontinued, raising that part of his countenance where his red eyebrows\nwould have been if he had had any, with malignant triumph, \"and I shall\ndo what I can to put a stop to this friendship. I don't approve of it. I\ndon't mind acknowledging to you that I've got rather a grudging\ndisposition, and want to keep off all intruders. I ain't a going, if I\nknow it, to run the risk of being plotted against.\"\n\n\"You are always plotting, and delude yourself into the belief that\neverybody else is doing the like, I think,\" said I.\n\n\"Perhaps so, Master Copperfield,\" he replied. \"But I've got a motive, as\nmy fellow-partner used to say; and I go at it tooth and nail. I mustn't\nbe put upon, as a numble person, too much. I can't allow people in my\nway. Really they must come out of the cart, Master Copperfield!\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said I.\n\n\"Don't you, though?\" he returned, with one of his jerks. \"I'm astonished\nat that, Master Copperfield, you being usually so quick! I'll try to be\nplainer, another time.--Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback, ringing at the\ngate, sir?\"\n\n\"It looks like him,\" I replied, as carelessly as I could.\n\nUriah stopped short, put his hands between his great knobs of knees, and\ndoubled himself up with laughter. With perfectly silent laughter. Not a\nsound escaped from him. I was so repelled by his odious behaviour,\nparticularly by this concluding instance, that I turned away without any\nceremony; and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden, like a\nscarecrow in want of support.\n\nIt was not on that evening; but, as I well remember, on the next evening\nbut one, which was a Saturday; that I took Agnes to see Dora. I had\narranged the visit, beforehand, with Miss Lavinia; and Agnes was\nexpected to tea.\n\nI was in a flutter of pride and anxiety; pride in my dear little\nbetrothed, and anxiety that Agnes should like her. All the way to\nPutney, Agnes being inside the stage-coach, and I outside, I pictured\nDora to myself in every one of the pretty looks I knew so well; now\nmaking up my mind that I should like her to look exactly as she looked\nat such a time, and then doubting whether I should not prefer her\nlooking as she looked at such another time; and almost worrying myself\ninto a fever about it.\n\nI was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty, in any case; but it\nfell out that I had never seen her look so well. She was not in the\ndrawing-room when I presented Agnes to her little aunts, but was shyly\nkeeping out of the way. I knew where to look for her, now; and sure\nenough I found her stopping her ears again, behind the same dull old\ndoor.\n\nAt first she wouldn't come at all; and then she pleaded for five minutes\nby my watch. When at length she put her arm through mine, to be taken to\nthe drawing-room, her charming little face was flushed, and had never\nbeen so pretty. But, when we went into the room, and it turned pale, she\nwas ten thousand times prettier yet.\n\nDora was afraid of Agnes. She had told me that she knew Agnes was \"too\nclever.\" But when she saw her looking at once so cheerful and so\nearnest, and so thoughtful, and so good, she gave a faint little cry of\npleased surprise, and just put her affectionate arms round Agnes's neck,\nand laid her innocent cheek against her face.\n\nI never was so happy. I never was so pleased as when I saw those two sit\ndown together, side by side. As when I saw my little darling looking up\nso naturally to those cordial eyes. As when I saw the tender, beautiful\nregard which Agnes cast upon her.\n\nMiss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa partook, in their way, of my joy. It was\nthe pleasantest tea-table in the world. Miss Clarissa presided. I cut\nand handed the sweet seed-cake--the little sisters had a bird-like\nfondness for picking up seeds and pecking at sugar; Miss Lavinia looked\non with benignant patronage, as if our happy love were all her work; and\nwe were perfectly contented with ourselves and one another.\n\nThe gentle cheerfulness of Agnes went to all their hearts. Her quiet\ninterest in everything that interested Dora; her manner of making\nacquaintance with Jip (who responded instantly); her pleasant way, when\nDora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me; her modest grace\nand ease, eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from\nDora; seemed to make our circle quite complete.\n\n\"I am so glad,\" said Dora, after tea, \"that you like me. I didn't think\nyou would; and I want, more than ever, to be liked, now Julia Mills is\ngone.\"\n\nI have omitted to mention it, by-the-bye. Miss Mills had sailed, and\nDora and I had gone aboard a great East Indiaman at Gravesend to see\nher; and we had had preserved ginger, and guava, and other delicacies of\nthat sort for lunch; and we had left Miss Mills weeping on a camp-stool\non the quarter-deck, with a large new diary under her arm, in which the\noriginal reflections awakened by the contemplation of Ocean were to be\nrecorded under lock and key.\n\nAgnes said, she was afraid I must have given her an unpromising\ncharacter; but Dora corrected that directly.\n\n\"Oh no!\" she said, shaking her curls at me; \"it was all praise. He\nthinks so much of your opinion, that I was quite afraid of it.\"\n\n\"My good opinion cannot strengthen his attachment to some people whom he\nknows,\" said Agnes, with a smile; \"it is not worth their having.\"\n\n\"But please let me have it,\" said Dora, in her coaxing way, \"if you\ncan!\"\n\nWe made merry about Dora's wanting to be liked, and Dora said I was a\ngoose, and she didn't like me at any rate, and the short evening flew\naway on gossamer-wings. The time was at hand when the coach was to call\nfor us. I was standing alone before the fire, when Dora came stealing\nsoftly in, to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went.\n\n\"Don't you think, if I had had her for a friend a long time ago, Doady,\"\nsaid Dora, her bright eyes shining very brightly, and her little right\nhand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of my coat, \"I might\nhave been more clever perhaps?\"\n\n\"My love!\" said I, \"what nonsense!\"\n\n\"Do you think it is nonsense?\" returned Dora, without looking at me.\n\"Are you sure it is?\"\n\n\"Of course I am!\"\n\n\"I have forgotten,\" said Dora, still turning the button round and round,\n\"what relation Agnes is to you, you dear bad boy.\"\n\n\"No blood-relation,\" I replied; \"but we were brought up together, like\nbrother and sister.\"\n\n\"I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?\" said Dora, beginning on\nanother button of my coat.\n\n\"Perhaps because I couldn't see you, and not love you, Dora!\"\n\n\"Suppose you had never seen me at all,\" said Dora, going to another\nbutton.\n\n\"Suppose we had never been born!\" said I, gaily.\n\nI wondered what she was thinking about, as I glanced in admiring silence\nat the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat, and\nat the clustering hair that lay against my breast, and at the lashes of\nher downcast eyes, slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers. At\nlength her eyes were lifted up to mine, and she stood on tiptoe to give\nme, more thoughtfully than usual, that precious little kiss--once,\ntwice, three times--and went out of the room.\n\nThey all came back together within five minutes afterwards, and Dora's\nunusual thoughtfulness was quite gone then. She was laughingly resolved\nto put Jip through the whole of his performances, before the coach came.\nThey took some time (not so much on account of their variety, as Jip's\nreluctance), and were still unfinished when it was heard at the door.\nThere was a hurried but affectionate parting between Agnes and herself;\nand Dora was to write to Agnes (who was not to mind her letters being\nfoolish, she said), and Agnes was to write to Dora; and they had a\nsecond parting at the coach-door, and a third when Dora, in spite of the\nremonstrances of Miss Lavinia, would come running out once more to\nremind Agnes at the coach-window about writing, and to shake her curls\nat me on the box.\n\nThe stage-coach was to put us down near Covent Garden, where we were to\ntake another stage-coach for Highgate. I was impatient for the short\nwalk in the interval, that Agnes might praise Dora to me. Ah! what\npraise it was! How lovingly and fervently did it commend the pretty\ncreature I had won, with all her artless graces best displayed, to my\nmost gentle care! How thoughtfully remind me, yet with no pretence of\ndoing so, of the trust in which I held the orphan child!\n\nNever, never, had I loved Dora so deeply and truly, as I loved her that\nnight. When we had again alighted, and were walking in the starlight\nalong the quiet road that led to the Doctor's house, I told Agnes it was\nher doing.\n\n\"When you were sitting by her,\" said I, \"you seemed to be no less _her_\nguardian angel than mine; and you seem so now, Agnes.\"\n\n\"A poor angel,\" she returned, \"but faithful.\"\n\nThe clear tone of her voice, going straight to my heart, made it natural\nto me to say:\n\n\"The cheerfulness that belongs to you, Agnes (and to no one else that\never I have seen), is so restored, I have observed to-day, that I have\nbegun to hope you are happier at home?\"\n\n\"I am happier in myself,\" she said; \"I am quite cheerful and\nlight-hearted.\"\n\nI glanced at the serene face looking upward, and thought it was the\nstars that made it seem so noble.\n\n\"There has been no change at home,\" said Agnes, after a few moments.\n\n\"No fresh reference,\" said I, \"to--I wouldn't distress you, Agnes, but I\ncannot help asking--to what we spoke of, when we parted last?\"\n\n\"No, none,\" she answered.\n\n\"I have thought so much about it.\"\n\n\"You must think less about it. Remember that I confide in simple love\nand truth at last. Have no apprehensions for me, Trotwood,\" she added,\nafter a moment; \"the step you dread my taking, I shall never take.\"\n\nAlthough I think I had never really feared it, in any season of cool\nreflection, it was an unspeakable relief to me to have this assurance\nfrom her own truthful lips. I told her so, earnestly.\n\n\"And when this visit is over,\" said I,--\"for we may not be alone another\ntime,--how long is it likely to be, my dear Agnes, before you come to\nLondon again?\"\n\n\"Probably a long time,\" she replied; \"I think it will be best--for\npapa's sake--to remain at home. We are not likely to meet often, for\nsome time to come; but I shall be a good correspondent of Dora's, and we\nshall frequently hear of one another that way.\"\n\nWe were now within the little court-yard of the Doctor's cottage. It was\ngrowing late. There was a light in the window of Mrs. Strong's chamber,\nand Agnes, pointing to it, bade me good night.\n\n\"Do not be troubled,\" she said, giving me her hand, \"by our misfortunes\nand anxieties. I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness. If\nyou can ever give me help, rely upon it I will ask you for it. God bless\nyou always!\"\n\nIn her beaming smile, and in these last tones of her cheerful voice,\nI seemed again to see and hear my little Dora in her company. I stood\nawhile, looking through the porch at the stars, with a heart full of\nlove and gratitude, and then walked slowly forth. I had engaged a bed\nat a decent alehouse close by, and was going out at the gate, when,\nhappening to turn my head, I saw a light in the Doctor's study. A\nhalf-reproachful fancy came into my mind, that he had been working at\nthe Dictionary without my help. With the view of seeing if this were\nso, and, in any case, of bidding him good night, if he were yet sitting\namong his books, I turned back, and going softly across the hall, and\ngently opening the door, looked in.\n\nThe first person whom I saw, to my surprise, by the sober light of the\nshaded lamp, was Uriah. He was standing close beside it, with one of his\nskeleton hands over his mouth, and the other resting on the Doctor's\ntable. The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering his face with his\nhands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled and distressed, was leaning\nforward, irresolutely touching the Doctor's arm.\n\nFor an instant, I supposed that the Doctor was ill. I hastily advanced a\nstep under that impression, when I met Uriah's eye, and saw what was the\nmatter. I would have withdrawn, but the Doctor made a gesture to detain\nme, and I remained.\n\n\"At any rate,\" observed Uriah, with a writhe of his ungainly person, \"we\nmay keep the door shut. We needn't make it known to ALL the town.\"\n\nSaying which, he went on his toes to the door, which I had left open,\nand carefully closed it. He then came back, and took up his former\nposition. There was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in his voice\nand manner, more intolerable--at least to me--than any demeanour he\ncould have assumed.\n\n\"I have felt it incumbent upon me, Master Copperfield,\" said Uriah, \"to\npoint out to Doctor Strong what you and me have already talked about.\nYou didn't exactly understand me, though?\"\n\nI gave him a look, but no other answer; and, going to my good old\nmaster, said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and\nencouragement. He put his hand upon my shoulder, as it had been his\ncustom to do when I was quite a little fellow, but did not lift his grey\nhead.\n\n\"As you didn't understand me, Master Copperfield,\" resumed Uriah in the\nsame officious manner, \"I may take the liberty of umbly mentioning,\nbeing among friends, that I have called Doctor Strong's attention to the\ngoings-on of Mrs. Strong. It's much against the grain with me, I assure\nyou, Copperfield, to be concerned in anything so unpleasant; but really,\nas it is, we're all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't to be. That\nwas what my meaning was, sir, when you didn't understand me.\"\n\nI wonder now, when I recall his leer, that I did not collar him, and try\nto shake the breath out of his body.\n\n\"I dare say I didn't make myself very clear,\" he went on, \"nor you\nneither. Naturally, we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a\nwide berth. Hows'ever, at last I have made up my mind to speak plain;\nand I have mentioned to Doctor Strong that--did you speak, sir?\"\n\nThis was to the Doctor, who had moaned. The sound might have touched any\nheart, I thought, but it had no effect upon Uriah's.\n\n\"--mentioned to Doctor Strong,\" he proceeded, \"that any one may see that\nMr. Maldon, and the lovely and agreeable lady as is Doctor Strong's\nwife, are too sweet on one another. Really the time is come (we being at\npresent all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't to be), when Doctor\nStrong must be told that this was full as plain to everybody as the sun,\nbefore Mr. Maldon went to India; that Mr. Maldon made excuses to come\nback, for nothing else; and that he's always here, for nothing else.\nWhen you come in, sir, I was just putting it to my fellow-partner,\"\ntowards whom he turned, \"to say to Doctor Strong upon his word and\nhonor, whether he'd ever been of this opinion long ago, or not. Come,\nMr. Wickfield, sir! Would you be so good as tell us? Yes or no, sir?\nCome, partner!\"\n\n\"For God's sake, my dear Doctor,\" said Mr. Wickfield, again laying his\nirresolute hand upon the Doctor's arm, \"don't attach too much weight to\nany suspicions I may have entertained.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried Uriah, shaking his head. \"What a melancholy confirmation:\nain't it? Him! Such an old friend! Bless your soul, when I was nothing\nbut a clerk in his office, Copperfield, I've seen him twenty times, if\nI've seen him once, quite in a taking about it--quite put out, you know\n(and very proper in him as a father; I'm sure _I_ can't blame him), to\nthink that Miss Agnes was mixing herself up with what oughtn't to be.\"\n\n\"My dear Strong,\" said Mr. Wickfield in a tremulous voice, \"my good\nfriend, I needn't tell you that it has been my vice to look for some one\nmaster motive in everybody, and to try all actions by one narrow test. I\nmay have fallen into such doubts as I have had, through this mistake.\"\n\n\"You have had doubts, Wickfield,\" said the Doctor, without lifting up\nhis head. \"You have had doubts.\"\n\n\"Speak up, fellow-partner,\" urged Uriah.\n\n\"I had, at one time, certainly,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"I--God forgive\nme--I thought _you_ had.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" returned the Doctor, in a tone of most pathetic grief.\n\n\"I thought, at one time,\" said Mr. Wickfield, \"that you wished to send\nMaldon abroad to effect a desirable separation.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" returned the Doctor. \"To give Annie pleasure, by making\nsome provision for the companion of her childhood. Nothing else.\"\n\n\"So I found,\" said Mr. Wickfield. \"I couldn't doubt it, when you told me\nso. But I thought--I implore you to remember the narrow construction\nwhich has been my besetting sin--that, in a case where there was so much\ndisparity in point of years--\"\n\n\"That's the way to put it, you see, Master Copperfield!\" observed Uriah,\nwith fawning and offensive pity.\n\n\"--a lady of such youth, and such attractions, however real her respect\nfor you, might have been influenced in marrying, by worldly\nconsiderations only. I made no allowance for innumerable feelings and\ncircumstances that may have all tended to good. For Heaven's sake\nremember that!\"\n\n\"How kind he puts it!\" said Uriah, shaking his head.\n\n\"Always observing her from one point of view,\" said Mr. Wickfield; \"but\nby all that is dear to you, my old friend, I entreat you to consider\nwhat it was; I am forced to confess now, having no escape--\"\n\n\"No! There's no way out of it, Mr. Wickfield, sir,\" observed Uriah,\n\"when it's got to this.\"\n\n\"--that I did,\" said Mr. Wickfield, glancing helplessly and distractedly\nat his partner, \"that I did doubt her, and think her wanting in her duty\nto you; and that I did sometimes, if I must say all, feel averse to\nAgnes being in such a familiar relation towards her, as to see what I\nsaw, or in my diseased theory fancied that I saw. I never mentioned this\nto any one. I never meant it to be known to any one. And though it is\nterrible to you to hear,\" said Mr. Wickfield, quite subdued, \"if you\nknew how terrible it is to me to tell, you would feel compassion for\nme!\"\n\nThe Doctor, in the perfect goodness of his nature, put out his hand. Mr.\nWickfield held it for a little while in his, with his head bowed down.\n\n\"I am sure,\" said Uriah, writhing himself into the silence like a\nConger-eel, \"that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody.\nBut since we have got so far, I ought to take the liberty of mentioning\nthat Copperfield has noticed it too.\"\n\nI turned upon him, and asked him how he dared refer to me!\n\n\"Oh! it's very kind of you, Copperfield,\" returned Uriah, undulating all\nover, \"and we all know what an amiable character yours is; but you know\nthat the moment I spoke to you the other night, you knew what I meant.\nYou know you knew what I meant, Copperfield. Don't deny it! You deny it\nwith the best intentions; but don't do it, Copperfield!\"\n\nI saw the mild eye of the good old Doctor turned upon me for a moment,\nand I felt that the confession of my old misgivings and remembrances was\ntoo plainly written in my face to be overlooked. It was of no use\nraging. I could not undo that. Say what I would, I could not unsay it.\n\nWe were silent again, and remained so, until the Doctor rose and walked\ntwice or thrice across the room. Presently he returned to where his\nchair stood; and, leaning on the back of it, and occasionally putting\nhis handkerchief to his eyes, with a simple honesty that did him more\nhonor, to my thinking, than any disguise he could have affected, said:\n\n\"I have been much to blame. I believe I have been very much to blame. I\nhave exposed one whom I hold in my heart, to trials and aspersions--I\ncall them aspersions, even to have been conceived in anybody's inmost\nmind--of which she never, but for me, could have been the object.\"\n\nUriah Heep gave a kind of snivel. I think to express sympathy.\n\n\"Of which my Annie,\" said the Doctor, \"never, but for me, could have\nbeen the object. Gentlemen, I am old now, as you know; I do not feel,\nto-night, that I have much to live for. But my life--my Life--upon the\ntruth and honor of the dear lady who has been the subject of this\nconversation!\"\n\nI do not think that the best embodiment of chivalry, the realisation of\nthe handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter, could\nhave said this, with a more impressive and affecting dignity than the\nplain old Doctor did.\n\n\"But I am not prepared,\" he went on, \"to deny--perhaps I may have been,\nwithout knowing it, in some degree prepared to admit--that I may have\nunwittingly ensnared that lady into an unhappy marriage. I am a man\nquite unaccustomed to observe; and I cannot but believe that the\nobservation of several people, of different ages and positions, all too\nplainly tending in one direction (and that so natural), is better than\nmine.\"\n\nI had often admired, as I have elsewhere described, his benignant manner\ntowards his youthful wife; but the respectful tenderness he manifested\nin every reference to her on this occasion, and the almost reverential\nmanner in which he put away from him the lightest doubt of her\nintegrity, exalted him, in my eyes, beyond description.\n\n\"I married that lady,\" said the Doctor, \"when she was extremely young. I\ntook her to myself when her character was scarcely formed. So far as it\nwas developed, it had been my happiness to form it. I knew her father\nwell. I knew her well. I had taught her what I could, for the love of\nall her beautiful and virtuous qualities. If I did her wrong; as I fear\nI did, in taking advantage (but I never meant it) of her gratitude and\nher affection; I ask pardon of that lady, in my heart!\"\n\nHe walked across the room, and came back to the same place; holding the\nchair with a grasp that trembled, like his subdued voice, in its\nearnestness.\n\n\"I regarded myself as a refuge, for her, from the dangers and\nvicissitudes of life. I persuaded myself that, unequal though we were in\nyears, she would live tranquilly and contentedly with me. I did not shut\nout of my consideration the time when I should leave her free, and still\nyoung and still beautiful, but with her judgment more matured--no,\ngentlemen--upon my truth!\"\n\nHis homely figure seemed to be lightened up by his fidelity and\ngenerosity. Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could\nhave imparted to it.\n\n\"My life with this lady has been very happy. Until to-night, I have had\nuninterrupted occasion to bless the day on which I did her great\ninjustice.\"\n\nHis voice, more and more faltering in the utterance of these words,\nstopped for a few moments; then he went on:\n\n\"Once awakened from my dream--I have been a poor dreamer, in one way or\nother, all my life--I see how natural it is that she should have some\nregretful feeling towards her old companion and her equal. That she does\nregard him with some innocent regret, with some blameless thoughts of\nwhat might have been, but for me, is, I fear, too true. Much that I have\nseen, but not noted, has come back upon me with new meaning, during this\nlast trying hour. But, beyond this, gentlemen, the dear lady's name\nnever must be coupled with a word, a breath, of doubt.\"\n\nFor a little while, his eye kindled and his voice was firm; for a little\nwhile he was again silent. Presently, he proceeded as before:\n\n\"It only remains for me, to bear the knowledge of the unhappiness I have\noccasioned, as submissively as I can. It is she who should reproach; not\nI. To save her from misconstruction, cruel misconstruction, that even my\nfriends have not been able to avoid, becomes my duty. The more retired\nwe live, the better I shall discharge it. And when the time comes--may\nit come soon, if it be His merciful pleasure!--when my death shall\nrelease her from constraint, I shall close my eyes upon her honored\nface, with unbounded confidence and love; and leave her, with no sorrow\nthen, to happier and brighter days.\"\n\nI could not see him for the tears which his earnestness and goodness, so\nadorned by, and so adorning, the perfect simplicity of his manner,\nbrought into my eyes. He had moved to the door, when he added:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have shown you my heart. I am sure you will respect it.\nWhat we have said to-night is never to be said more. Wickfield, give me\nan old friend's arm up-stairs!\"\n\nMr. Wickfield hastened to him. Without interchanging a word they went\nslowly out of the room together, Uriah looking after them.\n\n\"Well, Master Copperfield!\" said Uriah, meekly turning to me. \"The thing\nhasn't took quite the turn that might have been expected, for the old\nScholar--what an excellent man!--is as blind as a brickbat; but _this_\nfamily's out of the cart, I think!\"\n\nI needed but the sound of his voice to be so madly enraged as I never\nwas before, and never have been since.\n\n\"You villain,\" said I, \"what do you mean by entrapping me into your\nschemes? How dare you appeal to me just now, you false rascal, as if we\nhad been in discussion together?\"\n\nAs we stood, front to front, I saw so plainly, in the stealthy\nexultation of his face, what I already so plainly knew; I mean that he\nforced his confidence upon me, expressly to make me miserable, and had\nset a deliberate trap for me in this very matter; that I couldn't bear\nit. The whole of his lank cheek was invitingly before me, and I struck\nit with my open hand with that force that my fingers tingled as if I had\nburnt them.\n\nHe caught the hand in his, and we stood, in that connexion, looking at\neach other. We stood so, a long time; long enough for me to see the\nwhite marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, and\nleave it a deeper red.\n\n\"Copperfield,\" he said at length, in a breathless voice, \"have you taken\nleave of your senses?\"\n\n\"I have taken leave of you,\" said I, wresting my hand away. \"You dog,\nI'll know no more of you.\"\n\n\"Won't you?\" said he, constrained by the pain of his cheek to put his\nhand there. \"Perhaps you won't be able to help it. Isn't this ungrateful\nof you, now?\"\n\n\"I have shown you often enough,\" said I, \"that I despise you. I have\nshown you now, more plainly, that I do. Why should I dread your doing\nyour worst to all about you? What else do you ever do?\"\n\nHe perfectly understood this allusion to the considerations that had\nhitherto restrained me in my communications with him. I rather think\nthat neither the blow, nor the allusion, would have escaped me, but for\nthe assurance I had had from Agnes that night. It is no matter.\n\nThere was another long pause. His eyes, as he looked at me, seemed to\ntake every shade of color that could make eyes ugly.\n\n\"Copperfield,\" he said, removing his hand from his cheek, \"you have\nalways gone against me. I know you always used to be against me at Mr.\nWickfield's.\"\n\n\"You may think what you like,\" said I, still in a towering rage. \"If it\nis not true, so much the worthier you.\"\n\n\"And yet I always liked you, Copperfield!\" he rejoined.\n\nI deigned to make him no reply; and, taking up my hat, was going out to\nbed, when he came between me and the door.\n\n\"Copperfield,\" he said, \"there must be two parties to a quarrel. I won't\nbe one.\"\n\n\"You may go to the devil!\" said I.\n\n\"Don't say that!\" he replied. \"I know you'll be sorry afterwards. How\ncan you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?\nBut I forgive you.\"\n\n\"You forgive me!\" I repeated disdainfully.\n\n\"I do, and you can't help yourself,\" replied Uriah. \"To think of your\ngoing and attacking _me_, that have always been a friend to you! But\nthere can't be a quarrel without two parties, and I won't be one. I will\nbe a friend to you, in spite of you. So now you know what you've got to\nexpect.\"\n\nThe necessity of carrying on this dialogue (his part in which was very\nslow; mine very quick) in a low tone, that the house might not be\ndisturbed at an unseasonable hour, did not improve my temper; though my\npassion was cooling down. Merely telling him that I should expect from\nhim what I always had expected, and had never yet been disappointed in,\nI opened the door upon him, as if he had been a great walnut put there\nto be cracked, and went out of the house. But he slept out of the house\ntoo, at his mother's lodging; and before I had gone many hundred yards,\ncame up with me.\n\n\"You know, Copperfield,\" he said, in my ear (I did not turn my head),\n\"you're in quite a wrong position;\" which I felt to be true, and that\nmade me chafe the more; \"you can't make this a brave thing, and you\ncan't help being forgiven. I don't intend to mention it to mother, nor\nto any living soul. I'm determined to forgive you. But I do wonder that\nyou should lift your hand against a person that you knew to be so\numble!\"\n\nI felt only less mean than he. He knew me better than I knew myself. If\nhe had retorted, or openly exasperated me, it would have been a relief\nand a justification; but he had put me on a slow fire, on which I lay\ntormented half the night.\n\nIn the morning, when I came out, the early church bell was ringing, and\nhe was walking up and down with his mother. He addressed me as if\nnothing had happened, and I could do no less than reply. I had struck\nhim hard enough to give him the toothache, I suppose. At all events his\nface was tied up in a black silk handkerchief, which, with his hat\nperched on the top of it, was far from improving his appearance. I heard\nthat he went to a dentist's in London on the Monday morning, and had a\ntooth out. I hope it was a double one.\n\nThe Doctor gave out that he was not quite well; and remained alone, for\na considerable part of every day, during the remainder of the visit.\nAgnes and her father had been gone a week, before we resumed our usual\nwork. On the day preceding its resumption, the Doctor gave me with his\nown hands a folded note not sealed. It was addressed to myself; and laid\nan injunction on me, in a few affectionate words, never to refer to the\nsubject of that evening. I had confided it to my aunt, but to no one\nelse. It was not a subject I could discuss with Agnes, and Agnes\ncertainly had not the least suspicion of what had passed.\n\nNeither, I felt convinced, had Mrs. Strong then. Several weeks elapsed\nbefore I saw the least change in her. It came on slowly, like a cloud\nwhen there is no wind. At first, she seemed to wonder at the gentle\ncompassion with which the Doctor spoke to her, and at his wish that she\nshould have her mother with her, to relieve the dull monotony of her\nlife. Often, when we were at work, and she was sitting by, I would see\nher pausing and looking at him with that memorable face. Afterwards, I\nsometimes observed her rise, with her eyes full of tears, and go out of\nthe room. Gradually, an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty, and\ndeepened every day. Mrs. Markleham was a regular inmate of the cottage\nthen; but she talked and talked, and saw nothing.\n\nAs this change stole on Annie, once like sunshine in the Doctor's house,\nthe Doctor became older in appearance, and more grave; but the sweetness\nof his temper, the placid kindness of his manner, and his benevolent\nsolicitude for her, if they were capable of any increase, were\nincreased. I saw him once, early on the morning of her birthday, when\nshe came to sit in the window while we were at work (which she had\nalways done, but now began to do with a timid and uncertain air that I\nthought very touching), take her forehead between his hands, kiss it,\nand go hurriedly away, too much moved to remain. I saw her stand where\nhe had left her, like a statue; and then bend down her head, and clasp\nher hands, and weep, I cannot say how sorrowfully.\n\nSometimes, after that, I fancied that she tried to speak even to me, in\nintervals when we were left alone. But she never uttered word. The\nDoctor always had some new project for her participating in amusements\naway from home, with her mother; and Mrs. Markleham, who was very fond\nof amusements, and very easily dissatisfied with anything else, entered\ninto them with great good will, and was loud in her commendations. But\nAnnie, in a spiritless unhappy way, only went whither she was led, and\nseemed to have no care for anything.\n\nI did not know what to think. Neither did my aunt; who must have walked,\nat various times, a hundred miles in her uncertainty. What was strangest\nof all was, that the only real relief which seemed to make its way into\nthe secret region of this domestic unhappiness, made its way there in\nthe person of Mr. Dick.\n\nWhat his thoughts were on the subject, or what his observation was, I am\nas unable to explain, as I dare say he would have been to assist me in\nthe task. But, as I have recorded in the narrative of my school days,\nhis veneration for the Doctor was unbounded; and there is a subtlety of\nperception in real attachment, even when it is borne towards man by one\nof the lower animals, which leaves the highest intellect behind. To this\nmind of the heart, if I may call it so, in Mr. Dick, some bright ray of\nthe truth shot straight.\n\nHe had proudly resumed his privilege, in many of his spare hours, of\nwalking up and down the garden with the Doctor; as he had been\naccustomed to pace up and down The Doctor's Walk at Canterbury. But\nmatters were no sooner in this state, than he devoted all his spare time\n(and got up earlier to make it more) to these perambulations. If he had\nnever been so happy as when the Doctor read that marvellous performance,\nthe Dictionary, to him; he was now quite miserable unless the Doctor\npulled it out of his pocket, and began. When the Doctor and I were\nengaged, he now fell into the custom of walking up and down with Mrs.\nStrong, and helping her to trim her favorite flowers, or weed the beds.\nI dare say he rarely spoke a dozen words in an hour: but his quiet\ninterest, and his wistful face, found immediate response in both their\nbreasts; each knew that the other liked him, and that he loved both; and\nhe became what no one else could be--a link between them.\n\nWhen I think of him, with his impenetrably wise face, walking up and\ndown with the Doctor, delighted to be battered by the hard words in the\nDictionary; when I think of him carrying huge watering-pots after Annie;\nkneeling down, in very paws of gloves, at patient microscopic work among\nthe little leaves; expressing as no philosopher could have expressed, in\nevery thing he did, a delicate desire to be her friend; showering\nsympathy, trustfulness, and affection, out of every hole in the\nwatering-pot; when I think of him never wandering in that better mind of\nhis to which unhappiness addressed itself, never bringing the\nunfortunate King Charles into the garden, never wavering in his grateful\nservice, never diverted from his knowledge that there was something\nwrong, or from his wish to set it right--I really feel almost ashamed of\nhaving known that he was not quite in his wits, taking account of the\nutmost I have done with mine.\n\n\"Nobody but myself, Trot, knows what that man is!\" my aunt would proudly\nremark, when we conversed about it. \"Dick will distinguish himself yet!\"\n\nI must refer to one other topic before I close this chapter. While the\nvisit at the Doctor's was still in progress, I observed that the postman\nbrought two or three letters every morning for Uriah Heep, who remained\nat Highgate until the rest went back, it being a leisure time; and that\nthese were always directed in a business-like manner by Mr. Micawber,\nwho now assumed a round legal hand. I was glad to infer, from these\nslight premises, that Mr. Micawber was doing well; and consequently was\nmuch surprised to receive, about this time, the following letter from\nhis amiable wife.\n\n                                        \"CANTERBURY, _Monday Evening_.\n\n     \"You will doubtless be surprised, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to\n     receive this communication. Still more so, by its contents. Still\n     more so, by the stipulation of implicit confidence which I beg to\n     impose. But my feelings as a wife and mother require relief; and\n     as I do not wish to consult my family (already obnoxious to the\n     feelings of Mr. Micawber), I know no one of whom I can better ask\n     advice than my friend and former lodger.\n\n     \"You may be aware, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that between myself\n     and Mr. Micawber (whom I will never desert), there has always been\n     preserved a spirit of mutual confidence. Mr. Micawber may have\n     occasionally given a bill without consulting me, or he may have\n     misled me as to the period when that obligation would become due.\n     This has actually happened. But, in general, Mr. Micawber has had\n     no secrets from the bosom of affection--I allude to his wife--and\n     has invariably, on our retirement to rest, recalled the events of\n     the day.\n\n     \"You will picture to yourself, my dear Mr. Copperfield, what the\n     poignancy of my feelings must be, when I inform you that Mr.\n     Micawber is entirely changed. He is reserved. He is secret. His\n     life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrows--I again\n     allude to his wife--and if I should assure you that beyond knowing\n     that it is passed from morning to night at the office, I now know\n     less of it than I do of the man in the south, connected with whose\n     mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale respecting cold\n     plum porridge, I should adopt a popular fallacy to express an\n     actual fact.\n\n     \"But this is not all. Mr. Micawber is morose. He is severe. He\n     is estranged from our eldest son and daughter, he has no pride\n     in his twins, he looks with an eye of coldness even on the\n     unoffending stranger who last became a member of our circle. The\n     pecuniary means of meeting our expenses, kept down to the utmost\n     farthing, are obtained from him with great difficulty, and even\n     under fearful threats that he will Settle himself (the exact\n     expression); and he inexorably refuses to give any explanation\n     whatever of this distracting policy.\n\n     \"This is hard to bear. This is heart-breaking. If you will advise\n     me, knowing my feeble powers such as they are, how you think it\n     will be best to exert them in a dilemma so unwonted, you will\n     add another friendly obligation to the many you have already\n     rendered me. With loves from the children, and a smile from the\n     happily-unconscious stranger, I remain, dear Mr. Copperfield,\n\n                            \"Your afflicted\n                                                \"EMMA MICAWBER.\"\n\nI did not feel justified in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber's experience\nany other recommendation, than that she should try to reclaim Mr.\nMicawber by patience and kindness (as I knew she would in any case); but\nthe letter set me thinking about him very much.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nANOTHER RETROSPECT.\n\n\nOnce again, let me pause upon a memorable period of my life. Let me\nstand aside, to see the phantoms of those days go by me, accompanying\nthe shadow of myself, in dim procession.\n\nWeeks, months, seasons, pass along. They seem little more than a summer\nday and a winter evening. Now, the Common where I walk with Dora is all\nin bloom, a field of bright gold; and now the unseen heather lies in\nmounds and bunches underneath a covering of snow. In a breath, the river\nthat flows through our Sunday walks is sparkling in the summer sun, is\nruffled by the winter wind, or thickened with drifting heaps of ice.\nFaster than ever river ran towards the sea, it flashes, darkens, and\nrolls away.\n\nNot a thread changes, in the house of the two little bird-like ladies.\nThe clock ticks over the fire-place, the weather-glass hangs in the\nhall. Neither clock nor weather-glass is ever right; but we believe in\nboth, devoutly.\n\nI have come legally to man's estate. I have attained the dignity of\ntwenty-one. But this is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one.\nLet me think what I have achieved.\n\nI have tamed that savage stenographic mystery. I make a respectable\nincome by it. I am in high repute for my accomplishment in all\npertaining to the art, and am joined with eleven others in reporting the\ndebates in Parliament for a Morning Newspaper. Night after night, I\nrecord predictions that never come to pass, professions that are never\nfulfilled, explanations that are only meant to mystify. I wallow in\nwords. Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a\ntrussed fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound\nhand and foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know\nthe worth of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall\nnever be converted.\n\nMy dear old Traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit, but it is\nnot in Traddles's way. He is perfectly good-humoured respecting his\nfailure, and reminds me that he always did consider himself slow. He has\noccasional employment on the same newspaper, in getting up the facts of\ndry subjects, to be written about and embellished by more fertile minds.\nHe is called to the bar; and with admirable industry and self-denial has\nscraped another hundred pounds together, to fee a Conveyancer whose\nchambers he attends. A great deal of very hot port wine was consumed at\nhis call; and, considering the figure, I should think the Inner Temple\nmust have made a profit by it.\n\nI have come out in another way. I have taken with fear and trembling to\nauthorship. I wrote a little something, in secret, and sent it to a\nmagazine, and it was published in the magazine. Since then, I have taken\nheart to write a good many trifling pieces. Now, I am regularly paid for\nthem. Altogether, I am well off; when I tell my income on the fingers of\nmy left hand, I pass the third finger and take in the fourth to the\nmiddle joint.\n\nWe have removed, from Buckingham Street, to a pleasant little cottage\nvery near the one I looked at, when my enthusiasm first came on. My\naunt, however (who has sold the house at Dover, to good advantage), is\nnot going to remain here, but intends removing herself to a still more\ntiny cottage close at hand. What does this portend? My marriage? Yes!\n\nYes! I am going to be married to Dora! Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa\nhave given their consent; and if ever canary birds were in a flutter,\nthey are. Miss Lavinia, self-charged with the superintendence of my\ndarling's wardrobe, is constantly cutting out brown-paper cuirasses,\nand differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man, with a\nlong bundle, and a yard measure under his arm. A dressmaker, always\nstabbed in the breast with a needle and thread, boards and lodges in\nthe house; and seems to me, eating, drinking, or sleeping, never to\ntake her thimble off. They make a lay-figure of my dear. They are\nalways sending for her to come and try something on. We can't be happy\ntogether for five minutes in the evening, but some intrusive female\nknocks at the door, and says, \"Oh, if you please, Miss Dora, would you\nstep up-stairs!\"\n\nMiss Clarissa and my aunt roam all over London, to find out articles of\nfurniture for Dora and me to look at. It would be better for them to buy\nthe goods at once, without this ceremony of inspection; for, when we go\nto see a kitchen fender and meat-screen, Dora sees a Chinese house for\nJip, with little bells on the top, and prefers that. And it takes a long\ntime to accustom Jip to his new residence, after we have bought it;\nwhenever he goes in or out, he makes all the little bells ring, and is\nhorribly frightened.\n\nPeggotty comes up to make herself useful, and falls to work immediately.\nHer department appears to be, to clean everything over and over again.\nShe rubs everything that can be rubbed, until it shines, like her own\nhonest forehead, with perpetual friction. And now it is, that I begin to\nsee her solitary brother passing through the dark streets at night, and\nlooking, as he goes, among the wandering faces. I never speak to him at\nsuch an hour. I know too well, as his grave figure passes onward, what\nhe seeks, and what he dreads.\n\nWhy does Traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon\nin the Commons--where I still occasionally attend, for form's sake, when\nI have time? The realisation of my boyish day-dreams is at hand. I am\ngoing to take out the license.\n\nIt is a little document to do so much; and Traddles contemplates it, as\nit lies upon my desk, half in admiration, half in awe. There are the\nnames, in the sweet old visionary connexion, David Copperfield and Dora\nSpenlow; and there, in the corner, is that Parental Institution, the\nStamp Office, which is so benignantly interested in the various\ntransactions of human life, looking down upon our Union; and there is\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury invoking a blessing on us in print, and\ndoing it as cheap as could possibly be expected.\n\nNevertheless, I am in a dream, a flustered, happy, hurried dream. I\ncan't believe that it is going to be; and yet I can't believe but that\neveryone I pass in the street, must have some kind of perception, that I\nam to be married the day after to-morrow. The Surrogate knows me, when I\ngo down to be sworn; and disposes of me easily, as if there were a\nMasonic understanding between us. Traddles is not at all wanted, but is\nin attendance as my general backer.\n\n\"I hope the next time you come here, my dear fellow,\" I say to Traddles,\n\"it will be on the same errand for yourself. And I hope it will be\nsoon.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your good wishes, my dear Copperfield,\" he replies. \"I\nhope so too. It's a satisfaction to know that she'll wait for me any\nlength of time, and that she really is the dearest girl--\"\n\n\"When are you to meet her at the coach?\" I ask.\n\n\"At seven,\" says Traddles, looking at his plain old silver watch--the\nvery watch he once took a wheel out of, at school, to make a water-mill.\n\"That is about Miss Wickfield's time, is it not?\"\n\n\"A little earlier. Her time is half-past eight.\"\n\n\"I assure you, my dear boy,\" says Traddles, \"I am almost as pleased as\nif I were going to be married myself, to think that this event is coming\nto such a happy termination. And really the great friendship and\nconsideration of personally associating Sophy with the joyful occasion,\nand inviting her to be a bridesmaid in conjunction with Miss Wickfield,\ndemands my warmest thanks. I am extremely sensible of it.\"\n\nI hear him, and shake hands with him; and we talk, and walk, and dine,\nand so on; but I don't believe it. Nothing is real.\n\nSophy arrives at the house of Dora's aunts, in due course. She has the\nmost agreeable of faces,--not absolutely beautiful, but extraordinarily\npleasant,--and is one of the most genial, unaffected, frank, engaging\ncreatures I have ever seen. Traddles presents her to us with great\npride; and rubs his hands for ten minutes by the clock, with every\nindividual hair upon his head standing on tiptoe, when I congratulate\nhim in a corner on his choice.\n\nI have brought Agnes from the Canterbury coach, and her cheerful and\nbeautiful face is among us for the second time. Agnes has a great liking\nfor Traddles, and it is capital to see them meet, and to observe the\nglory of Traddles as he commends the dearest girl in the world to her\nacquaintance.\n\nStill I don't believe it. We have a delightful evening, and are\nsupremely happy; but I don't believe it yet. I can't collect myself. I\ncan't check off my happiness as it takes place. I feel in a misty and\nunsettled kind of state; as if I had got up very early in the morning a\nweek or two ago, and had never been to bed since. I can't make out when\nyesterday was. I seem to have been carrying the licence about, in my\npocket, many months.\n\nNext day, too, when we all go in a flock to see the house--our\nhouse--Dora's and mine--I am quite unable to regard myself as its\nmaster. I seem to be there, by permission of somebody else. I half\nexpect the real master to come home presently, and say he is glad\nto see me. Such a beautiful little house as it is, with everything\nso bright and new; with the flowers on the carpets looking as if\nfreshly gathered, and the green leaves on the paper as if they had\njust come out; with the spotless muslin curtains, and the blushing\nrose-coloured furniture, and Dora's garden hat with the blue ribbon--do\nI remember, now, how I loved her in such another hat when I first knew\nher!--already hanging on its little peg; the guitar-case quite at home\non its heels in a corner; and everybody tumbling over Jip's Pagoda,\nwhich is much too big for the establishment.\n\nAnother happy evening, quite as unreal as all the rest of it, and I\nsteal into the usual room before going away. Dora is not there. I\nsuppose they have not done trying on yet. Miss Lavinia peeps in, and\ntells me mysteriously that she will not be long. She is rather long,\nnotwithstanding; but by-and-by I hear a rustling at the door, and some\none taps.\n\nI say, \"Come in!\" but some one taps again.\n\nI go to the door, wondering who it is; there, I meet a pair of bright\neyes, and a blushing face; they are Dora's eyes and face, and Miss\nLavinia has dressed her in to-morrow's dress, bonnet and all, for me to\nsee. I take my little wife to my heart; and Miss Lavinia gives a little\nscream because I tumble the bonnet, and Dora laughs and cries at once,\nbecause I am so pleased; and I believe it less than ever.\n\n\"Do you think it pretty, Doady?\" says Dora.\n\nPretty! I should rather think I did.\n\n\"And are you sure you like me very much?\" says Dora.\n\nThe topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet, that Miss Lavinia\ngives another little scream, and begs me to understand that Dora is only\nto be looked at, and on no account to be touched. So Dora stands in a\ndelightful state of confusion for a minute or two, to be admired; and\nthen takes off her bonnet--looking so natural without it!--and runs away\nwith it in her hand; and comes dancing down again in her own familiar\ndress, and asks Jip if I have got a beautiful little wife, and whether\nhe'll forgive her for being married, and kneels down to make him stand\nupon the cookery-book, for the last time in her single life.\n\nI go home, more incredulous than ever, to a lodging that I have hard by;\nand get up very early in the morning, to ride to the Highgate road and\nfetch my aunt.\n\nI have never seen my aunt in such state. She is dressed in\nlavender-colored silk, and has a white bonnet on, and is amazing. Janet\nhas dressed her, and is there to look at me. Peggotty is ready to go to\nchurch, intending to behold the ceremony from the gallery. Mr. Dick,\nwho is to give my darling to me at the altar, has had his hair curled.\nTraddles, whom I have taken up by appointment at the turnpike, presents\na dazzling combination of cream color and light blue; and both he and\nMr. Dick have a general effect about them of being all gloves.\n\nNo doubt I see this, because I know it is so; but I am astray, and seem\nto see nothing. Nor do I believe anything whatever. Still, as we drive\nalong in an open carriage, this fairy marriage is real enough to fill me\nwith a sort of wondering pity for the unfortunate people who have no\npart in it, but are sweeping out the shops, and going to their daily\noccupations.\n\nMy aunt sits with my hand in hers all the way. When we stop a little way\nshort of the church, to put down Peggotty, whom we have brought on the\nbox, she gives it a squeeze, and me a kiss.\n\n\"God bless you, Trot! My own boy never could be dearer. I think of poor\ndear Baby this morning.\"\n\n\"So do I. And of all I owe to you, dear aunt.\"\n\n\"Tut, child!\" says my aunt; and gives her hand in overflowing cordiality\nto Traddles, who then gives his to Mr. Dick, who then gives his to me,\nwho then gives mine to Traddles, and then we come to the church door.\n\nThe church is calm enough, I am sure; but it might be a steam-power loom\nin full action, for any sedative effect it has on me. I am too far gone\nfor that.\n\nThe rest is all a more or less incoherent dream.\n\nA dream of their coming in with Dora; of the pew-opener arranging us,\nlike a drill-serjeant, before the altar rails; of my wondering, even\nthen, why pew-openers must always be the most disagreeable females\nprocurable, and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous\ninfection of good-humour which renders it indispensable to set those\nvessels of vinegar upon the road to Heaven.\n\nOf the clergyman and clerk appearing; of a few boatmen and some other\npeople strolling in; of an ancient mariner behind me, strongly flavoring\nthe church with rum; of the service beginning in a deep voice, and our\nall being very attentive.\n\nOf Miss Lavinia, who acts as a semi-auxiliary bridesmaid, being the\nfirst to cry, and of her doing homage (as I take it) to the memory of\nPidger, in sobs; of Miss Clarissa applying a smelling-bottle; of Agnes\ntaking care of Dora; of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a\nmodel of sternness, with tears rolling down her face; of little Dora\ntrembling very much, and making her responses in faint whispers.\n\nOf our kneeling down together, side by side; of Dora's trembling less\nand less, but always clasping Agnes by the hand; of the service being\ngot through, quietly and gravely; of our all looking at each other in an\nApril state of smiles and tears, when it is over; of my young wife being\nhysterical in the vestry, and crying for her poor papa, her dear papa.\n\nOf her soon cheering up again, and our signing the register all round.\nOf my going into the gallery for Peggotty to bring _her_ to sign it; of\nPeggotty's hugging me in a corner, and telling me she saw my own dear\nmother married; of its being over, and our going away.\n\nOf my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet wife\nupon my arm, through a mist of half-seen people, pulpits, monuments,\npews, fonts, organs, and church windows, in which there flutter faint\nairs of association with my childish church at home, so long ago.\n\n  [Illustration: I am Married.]\n\nOf their whispering, as we pass, what a youthful couple we are, and what\na pretty little wife she is. Of our all being so merry and talkative in\nthe carriage going back. Of Sophy telling us that when she saw Traddles\n(whom I had entrusted with the licence) asked for it, she almost\nfainted, having been convinced that he would contrive to lose it, or to\nhave his pocket picked. Of Agnes laughing gaily; and of Dora being so\nfond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her, but still keeps\nher hand.\n\nOf there being a breakfast, with abundance of things, pretty and\nsubstantial, to eat and drink, whereof I partake, as I should do in any\nother dream, without the least perception of their flavor; eating and\ndrinking, as I may say, nothing but love and marriage, and no more\nbelieving in the viands than in anything else.\n\nOf my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion, without having an idea\nof what I want to say, beyond such as may be comprehended in the full\nconviction that I haven't said it. Of our being very sociably and simply\nhappy (always in a dream though); and of Jip's having wedding cake, and\nits not agreeing with him afterwards.\n\nOf the pair of hired post-horses being ready, and of Dora's going away\nto change her dress. Of my aunt and Miss Clarissa remaining with us; and\nour walking in the garden; and my aunt, who has made quite a speech at\nbreakfast touching Dora's aunts, being mightily amused with herself, but\na little proud of it too.\n\nOf Dora's being ready, and of Miss Lavinia's hovering about her, loth to\nlose the pretty toy that has given her so much pleasant occupation. Of\nDora's making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has\nforgotten all sorts of little things; and of everybody's running\neverywhere to fetch them.\n\nOf their all closing about Dora, when at last she begins to say\ngood-bye, looking, with their bright colors and ribbons, like a bed of\nflowers. Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers, and\ncoming out, laughing and crying both together, to my jealous arms.\n\nOf my wanting to carry Jip (who is to go along with us), and Dora's\nsaying no, that she must carry him, or else he'll think she don't like\nhim any more, now she is married, and will break his heart. Of our\ngoing, arm in arm, and Dora stopping and looking back, and saying, \"If I\nhave ever been cross or ungrateful to anybody, don't remember it!\" and\nbursting into tears.\n\nOf her waving her little hand, and our going away once more. Of her once\nmore stopping, and looking back, and hurrying to Agnes, and giving\nAgnes, above all the others, her last kisses and farewells.\n\nWe drive away together, and I awake from the dream. I believe it at\nlast. It is my dear, dear, little wife beside me, whom I love so well!\n\n\"Are you happy now, you foolish boy?\" says Dora, \"and sure you don't\nrepent?\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nI have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me. They are\ngone, and I resume the journey of my story.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nOUR HOUSEKEEPING.\n\n\nIt was a strange condition of things, the honey-moon being over, and the\nbridesmaids gone home, when I found myself sitting down in my own small\nhouse with Dora; quite thrown out of employment, as I may say, in\nrespect of the delicious old occupation of making love.\n\nIt seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there. It was\nso unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her, not to have any\noccasion to be tormenting myself about her, not to have to write to her,\nnot to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her.\nSometimes of an evening, when I looked up from my writing, and saw her\nseated opposite, I would lean back in my chair, and think how queer it\nwas that there we were, alone together as a matter of course--nobody's\nbusiness any more--all the romance of our engagement put away upon a\nshelf, to rust--no one to please but one another--one another to please,\nfor life.\n\nWhen there was a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so\nstrange to me, as I was walking home, to think that Dora was at home! It\nwas such a wonderful thing, at first, to have her coming softly down to\ntalk to me as I ate my supper. It was such a stupendous thing to know\nfor certain that she put her hair in papers. It was altogether such an\nastonishing event to see her do it!\n\nI doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping\nhouse, than I and my pretty Dora did. We had a servant, of course. She\nkept house for us. I have still a latent belief that she must have been\nMrs. Crupp's daughter in disguise, we had such an awful time of it with\nMary Anne.\n\nHer name was Paragon. Her nature was represented to us, when we engaged\nher, as being feebly expressed in her name. She had a written character,\nas large as a proclamation; and, according to this document, could do\neverything of a domestic nature that ever I heard of, and a great many\nthings that I never did hear of. She was a woman in the prime of life;\nof a severe countenance; and subject (particularly in the arms) to a\nsort of perpetual measles or fiery rash. She had a cousin in the Life\nGuards, with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon shadow of\nsomebody else. His shell-jacket was as much too little for him as he was\ntoo big for the premises. He made the cottage smaller than it need have\nbeen, by being so very much out of proportion to it. Besides which, the\nwalls were not thick, and whenever he passed the evening at our house,\nwe always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen.\n\nOur treasure was warranted sober and honest. I am therefore willing to\nbelieve that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler; and\nthat the deficient teaspoons were attributable to the dustman.\n\nBut she preyed upon our minds dreadfully. We felt our inexperience, and\nwere unable to help ourselves. We should have been at her mercy, if she\nhad had any; but she was a remorseless woman, and had none. She was the\ncause of our first little quarrel.\n\n\"My dearest life,\" I said one day to Dora, \"do you think Mary Anne has\nany idea of time?\"\n\n\"Why, Doady?\" inquired Dora, looking up, innocently, from her drawing.\n\n\"My love, because it's five, and we were to have dined at four.\"\n\nDora glanced wistfully at the clock, and hinted that she thought it was\ntoo fast.\n\n\"On the contrary, my love,\" said I, referring to my watch, \"it's a few\nminutes too slow.\"\n\nMy little wife came and sat upon my knee, to coax me to be quiet, and\ndrew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose; but I couldn't\ndine off that, though it was very agreeable.\n\n\"Don't you think, my dear,\" said I, \"it would be better for you to\nremonstrate with Mary Anne?\"\n\n\"Oh no, please! I couldn't, Doady!\" said Dora.\n\n\"Why not, my love?\" I gently asked.\n\n\"Oh, because I am such a little goose,\" said Dora, \"and she knows I am!\"\n\nI thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment of any\nsystem of check on Mary Anne, that I frowned a little.\n\n\"Oh, what ugly wrinkles in my bad boy's forehead!\" said Dora, and still\nbeing on my knee, she traced them with her pencil; putting it to her\nrosy lips to make it mark blacker, and working at my forehead with a\nquaint little mockery of being industrious, that quite delighted me in\nspite of myself.\n\n\"There's a good child,\" said Dora, \"it makes its face so much prettier\nto laugh.\"\n\n\"But, my love,\" said I.\n\n\"No, no! please!\" cried Dora, with a kiss, \"don't be a naughty Blue\nBeard! Don't be serious!\"\n\n\"My precious wife,\" said I, \"we must be serious sometimes. Come! Sit\ndown on this chair, close beside me! Give me the pencil! There! Now let\nus talk sensibly. You know, dear;\" what a little hand it was to hold,\nand what a tiny wedding-ring it was to see! \"You know, my love, it is\nnot exactly comfortable to have to go out without one's dinner. Now, is\nit?\"\n\n\"N--n--no!\" replied Dora, faintly.\n\n\"My love, how you tremble!\"\n\n\"Because I KNOW you're going to scold me,\" exclaimed Dora, in a piteous\nvoice.\n\n\"My sweet, I am only going to reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, but reasoning is worse than scolding!\" exclaimed Dora, in despair.\n\"I didn't marry to be reasoned with. If you meant to reason with such a\npoor little thing as I am, you ought to have told me so, you cruel boy!\"\n\nI tried to pacify Dora, but she turned away her face, and shook her\ncurls from side to side, and said \"You cruel, cruel boy!\" so many times,\nthat I really did not exactly know what to do: so I took a few turns up\nand down the room in my uncertainty, and came back again.\n\n\"Dora, my darling!\"\n\n\"No, I am not your darling. Because you _must_ be sorry that you married\nme, or else you wouldn't reason with me!\" returned Dora.\n\nI felt so injured by the inconsequential nature of this charge, that it\ngave me courage to be grave.\n\n\"Now, my own Dora,\" said I, \"you are very childish, and are talking\nnonsense. You must remember, I am sure, that I was obliged to go out\nyesterday when dinner was half over; and that, the day before, I was\nmade quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in a hurry;\nto-day, I don't dine at all--and I am afraid to say how long we waited\nfor breakfast--and _then_ the water didn't boil. I don't mean to\nreproach you, my dear, but this is not comfortable.\"\n\n\"Oh, you cruel, cruel boy, to say I am a disagreeable wife!\" cried Dora.\n\n\"Now, my dear Dora, you must know that I never said that!\"\n\n\"You said I wasn't comfortable!\" said Dora.\n\n\"I said the housekeeping was not comfortable.\"\n\n\"It's exactly the same thing!\" cried Dora. And she evidently thought so,\nfor she wept most grievously.\n\nI took another turn across the room, full of love for my pretty wife,\nand distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock my head against\nthe door. I sat down again, and said:\n\n\"I am not blaming you, Dora. We have both a great deal to learn. I am\nonly trying to show you, my dear, that you must--you really must\" (I was\nresolved not to give this up)--\"accustom yourself to look after Mary\nAnne. Likewise to act a little for yourself, and me.\"\n\n\"I wonder, I do, at your making such ungrateful speeches,\" sobbed Dora.\n\"When you know that the other day, when you said you would like a little\nbit of fish, I went out myself, miles and miles, and ordered it, to\nsurprise you.\"\n\n\"And it was very kind of you, my own darling,\" said I. \"I felt it\nso much that I wouldn't on any account have even mentioned that you\nbought a Salmon--which was too much for two. Or that it cost one pound\nsix--which was more than we can afford.\"\n\n\"You enjoyed it very much,\" sobbed Dora. \"And you said I was a Mouse.\"\n\n\"And I'll say so again, my love,\" I returned, \"a thousand times!\"\n\nBut I had wounded Dora's soft little heart, and she was not to be\ncomforted. She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing, that I felt\nas if I had said I don't know what to hurt her. I was obliged to hurry\naway; I was kept out late; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as\nmade me miserable. I had the conscience of an assassin, and was haunted\nby a vague sense of enormous wickedness.\n\nIt was two or three hours past midnight when I got home. I found my\naunt, in our house, sitting up for me.\n\n\"Is anything the matter, aunt?\" said I, alarmed.\n\n\"Nothing, Trot,\" she replied. \"Sit down, sit down. Little Blossom has\nbeen rather out of spirits, and I have been keeping her company. That's\nall.\"\n\nI leaned my head upon my hand; and felt more sorry and downcast, as I\nsat looking at the fire, than I could have supposed possible so soon\nafter the fulfilment of my brightest hopes. As I sat thinking, I\nhappened to meet my aunt's eyes, which were resting on my face. There\nwas an anxious expression in them, but it cleared directly.\n\n\"I assure you, aunt,\" said I, \"I have been quite unhappy myself all\nnight, to think of Dora's being so. But I had no other intention than to\nspeak to her tenderly and lovingly about our home-affairs.\"\n\nMy aunt nodded encouragement.\n\n\"You must have patience, Trot,\" said she.\n\n\"Of course. Heaven knows I don't mean to be unreasonable, aunt!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said my aunt. \"But Little Blossom is a very tender little\nblossom, and the wind must be gentle with her.\"\n\nI thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her tenderness towards my wife;\nand I was sure that she knew I did.\n\n\"Don't you think, aunt,\" said I, after some further contemplation of the\nfire, \"that you could advise and counsel Dora a little, for our mutual\nadvantage, now and then?\"\n\n\"Trot,\" returned my aunt, with some emotion, \"no! Don't ask me such a\nthing!\"\n\nHer tone was so very earnest that I raised my eyes in surprise.\n\n\"I look back on my life, child,\" said my aunt, \"and I think of some who\nare in their graves, with whom I might have been on kinder terms. If I\njudged harshly of other people's mistakes in marriage, it may have been\nbecause I had bitter reason to judge harshly of my own. Let that pass. I\nhave been a grumpy, frumpy, wayward sort of a woman, a good many years.\nI am still, and I always shall be. But you and I have done one another\nsome good, Trot,--at all events, you have done me good, my dear; and\ndivision must not come between us, at this time of day.\"\n\n\"Division between _us_!\" cried I.\n\n\"Child, child!\" said my aunt, smoothing her dress, \"how soon it might\ncome between us, or how unhappy I might make our Little Blossom, if I\nmeddled in anything, a prophet couldn't say. I want our pet to like me,\nand be as gay as a butterfly. Remember your own home, in that second\nmarriage; and never do both me and her the injury you have hinted at!\"\n\nI comprehended, at once, that my aunt was right; and I comprehended the\nfull extent of her generous feeling towards my dear wife.\n\n\"These are early days, Trot,\" she pursued, \"and Rome was not built in a\nday, nor in a year. You have chosen freely for yourself;\" a cloud passed\nover her face for a moment, I thought; \"and you have chosen a very\npretty and a very affectionate creature. It will be your duty, and it\nwill be your pleasure too--of course I know that; I am not delivering a\nlecture--to estimate her (as you chose her) by the qualities she has,\nand not by the qualities she may not have. The latter you must develop\nin her, if you can. And if you cannot, child,\" here my aunt rubbed her\nnose, \"you must just accustom yourself to do without 'em. But remember,\nmy dear, your future is between you two. No one can assist you; you are\nto work it out for yourselves. This is marriage, Trot; and Heaven bless\nyou both, in it, for a pair of babes in the wood as you are!\"\n\nMy aunt said this in a sprightly way, and gave me a kiss to ratify the\nblessing.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, \"light my little lantern, and see me into my band-box\nby the garden path;\" for there was a communication between our cottages\nin that direction. \"Give Betsey Trotwood's love to Blossom, when you\ncome back; and whatever you do, Trot, never dream of setting Betsey up\nas a scarecrow, for if _I_ ever saw her in the glass, she's quite grim\nenough and gaunt enough in her private capacity!\"\n\nWith this my aunt tied her head up in a handkerchief, with which she was\naccustomed to make a bundle of it on such occasions; and I escorted her\nhome. As she stood in her garden, holding up her little lantern to light\nme back, I thought her observation of me had an anxious air again; but I\nwas too much occupied in pondering on what she had said, and too much\nimpressed--for the first time, in reality--by the conviction that Dora\nand I had indeed to work out our future for ourselves, and that no one\ncould assist us, to take much notice of it.\n\nDora came stealing down in her little slippers, to meet me, now that I\nwas alone; and cried upon my shoulder, and said I had been hard-hearted\nand she had been naughty; and I said much the same thing in effect, I\nbelieve; and we made it up, and agreed that our first little difference\nwas to be our last, and that we were never to have another if we lived a\nhundred years.\n\nThe next domestic trial we went through, was the Ordeal of Servants.\nMary Anne's cousin deserted into our coal-hole, and was brought out,\nto our great amazement, by a piquet of his companions in arms, who\ntook him away handcuffed in a procession that covered our front-garden\nwith ignominy. This nerved me to get rid of Mary Anne, who went so\nmildly, on receipt of wages, that I was surprised, until I found out\nabout the tea-spoons, and also about the little sums she had borrowed\nin my name of the tradespeople without authority. After an interval of\nMrs. Kidgerbury--the oldest inhabitant of Kentish Town, I believe,\nwho went out charing, but was too feeble to execute her conceptions of\nthat art--we found another treasure, who was one of the most amiable\nof women, but who generally made a point of falling either up or down\nthe kitchen stairs with the tray, and almost always plunged into the\nparlor, as into a bath, with the tea-things. The ravages committed by\nthis unfortunate, rendering her dismissal necessary, she was succeeded\n(with intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury) by a long line of Incapables;\nterminating in a young person of genteel appearance, who went to\nGreenwich Fair in Dora's bonnet. After whom I remember nothing but an\naverage equality of failure.\n\nEverybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us. Our appearance\nin a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought out\nimmediately. If we bought a lobster, it was full of water. All our meat\nturned out to be tough, and there was hardly any crust to our loaves. In\nsearch of the principle on which joints ought to be roasted, to be\nroasted enough, and not too much, I myself referred to the Cookery Book,\nand found it there established as the allowance of a quarter of an hour\nto every pound, and say a quarter over. But the principle always failed\nus by some curious fatality, and we never could hit any medium between\nredness and cinders.\n\nI had reason to believe that in accomplishing these failures we incurred\na far greater expense than if we had achieved a series of triumphs. It\nappeared to me, on looking over the tradesmen's books, as if we might\nhave kept the basement story paved with butter, such was the extensive\nscale of our consumption of that article. I don't know whether the\nExcise returns of the period may have exhibited any increase in the\ndemand for pepper; but if our performances did not affect the market, I\nshould say several families must have left off using it. And the most\nwonderful fact of all was, that we never had anything in the house.\n\nAs to the washerwoman pawning the clothes, and coming in a state of\npenitent intoxication to apologise, I suppose that might have happened\nseveral times to anybody. Also the chimney on fire, the parish engine,\nand perjury on the part of the Beadle. But I apprehend that we were\npersonally unfortunate in engaging a servant with a taste for cordials,\nwho swelled our running account for porter at the public-house by such\ninexplicable items as \"quartern rum shrub (Mrs. C.)\" \"Half-quartern gin\nand cloves (Mrs. C.)\" \"Glass rum and peppermint (Mrs. C.)\"--the\nparenthesis always referring to Dora, who was supposed, it appeared on\nexplanation, to have imbibed the whole of these refreshments.\n\nOne of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner to\nTraddles. I met him in town, and asked him to walk out with me that\nafternoon. He readily consenting, I wrote to Dora, saying I would bring\nhim home. It was pleasant weather, and on the road we made my domestic\nhappiness the theme of conversation. Traddles was very full of it; and\nsaid, that, picturing himself with such a home, and Sophy waiting and\npreparing for him, he could think of nothing wanting to complete his\nbliss.\n\nI could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite end\nof the table, but I certainly could have wished, when we sate down, for\na little more room. I did not know how it was, but though there were\nonly two of us, we were at once always cramped for room, and yet had\nalways room enough to lose everything in. I suspect it may have been\nbecause nothing had a place of its own, except Jip's pagoda, which\ninvariably blocked up the main thoroughfare. On the present occasion,\nTraddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda and the guitar-case, and Dora's\nflower-painting, and my writing-table, that I had serious doubts of the\npossibility of his using his knife and fork; but he protested, with his\nown good-humour, \"Oceans of room, Copperfield! I assure you, Oceans!\"\n\n  [Illustration: Our Housekeeping.]\n\nThere was another thing I could have wished, namely, that Jip had never\nbeen encouraged to walk about the table-cloth during dinner. I began to\nthink there was something disorderly in his being there at all, even if\nhe had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the\nmelted butter. On this occasion he seemed to think he was introduced\nexpressly to keep Traddles at bay; and he barked at my old friend, and\nmade short runs at his plate, with such undaunted pertinacity, that he\nmay be said to have engrossed the conversation.\n\nHowever, as I knew how tender-hearted my dear Dora was, and how\nsensitive she would be to any slight upon her favorite, I hinted no\nobjection. For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing\nplates upon the floor; or to the disreputable appearance of the castors,\nwhich were all at sixes and sevens, and looked drunk; or to the further\nblockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs. I could not\nhelp wondering in my own mind, as I contemplated the boiled leg of\nmutton before me, previous to carving it, how it came to pass that our\njoints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes--and whether our\nbutcher contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world;\nbut I kept my reflections to myself.\n\n\"My love,\" said I to Dora, \"what have you got in that dish?\"\n\nI could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at\nme, as if she wanted to kiss me.\n\n\"Oysters, dear,\" said Dora, timidly.\n\n\"Was that _your_ thought?\" said I, delighted.\n\n\"Ye-yes, Doady,\" said Dora.\n\n\"There never was a happier one!\" I exclaimed, laying down the\ncarving-knife and fork. \"There is nothing Traddles likes so much!\"\n\n\"Ye-yes, Doady,\" said Dora, \"and so I bought a beautiful little barrel\nof them, and the man said they were very good. But I--I am afraid\nthere's something the matter with them. They don't seem right.\" Here\nDora shook her head, and diamonds twinkled in her eyes.\n\n\"They are only opened in both shells,\" said I. \"Take the top one off, my\nlove.\"\n\n\"But it won't come off,\" said Dora, trying very hard, and looking very\nmuch distressed.\n\n\"Do you know, Copperfield,\" said Traddles, cheerfully examining the\ndish, \"I think it is in consequence--they are capital oysters, but I\n_think_ it is in consequence--of their never having been opened.\"\n\nThey never had been opened; and we had no oyster-knives--and couldn't\nhave used them if we had; so we looked at the oysters and ate the\nmutton. At least we ate as much of it as was done, and made up with\ncapers. If I had permitted him, I am satisfied that Traddles would have\nmade a perfect savage of himself, and eaten a plateful of raw meat, to\nexpress enjoyment of the repast; but I would hear of no such immolation\non the altar of friendship, and we had a course of bacon instead; there\nhappening, by good fortune, to be cold bacon in the larder.\n\nMy poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I should be\nannoyed, and in such a state of joy when she found I was not, that the\ndiscomfiture I had subdued, very soon vanished, and we passed a happy\nevening; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair while Traddles and I\ndiscussed a glass of wine, and taking every opportunity of whispering in\nmy ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel, cross old boy. By\nand bye she made tea for us; which it was so pretty to see her do, as if\nshe were busying herself with a set of doll's tea-things, that I was not\nparticular about the quality of the beverage. Then Traddles and I played\na game or two at cribbage; and Dora singing to the guitar the while, it\nseemed to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream of\nmine, and the night when I first listened to her voice were not yet\nover.\n\nWhen Traddles went away, and I came back into the parlor from seeing him\nout, my wife planted her chair close to mine, and sat down by my side.\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" she said. \"Will you try to teach me, Doady?\"\n\n\"I must teach myself first, Dora,\" said I. \"I am as bad as you, love.\"\n\n\"Ah! But you can learn,\" she returned; \"and you are a clever, clever\nman!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, mouse!\" said I.\n\n\"I wish,\" resumed my wife, after a long silence, \"that I could have gone\ndown into the country for a whole year, and lived with Agnes!\"\n\nHer hands were clasped upon my shoulder, and her chin rested on them,\nand her blue eyes looked quietly into mine.\n\n\"Why so?\" I asked.\n\n\"I think she might have improved me, and I think I might have learnt\nfrom _her_,\" said Dora.\n\n\"All in good time, my love. Agnes has had her father to take care of for\nthese many years, you should remember. Even when she was quite a child,\nshe was the Agnes whom we know,\" said I.\n\n\"Will you call me a name I want you to call me?\" inquired Dora, without\nmoving.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked with a smile.\n\n\"It's a stupid name,\" she said, shaking her curls for a moment.\n\"Child-wife.\"\n\nI laughingly asked my child-wife what her fancy was in desiring to be so\ncalled? She answered without moving, otherwise than as the arm I twined\nabout her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me:\n\n\"I don't mean, you silly fellow, that you should use the name, instead\nof Dora. I only mean that you should think of me that way. When you are\ngoing to be angry with me, say to yourself, 'it's only my child-wife!'\nWhen I am very disappointing, say, 'I knew, a long time ago, that she\nwould make but a child-wife!' When you miss what I should like to be,\nand I think can never be, say, 'still my foolish child-wife loves me!'\nFor indeed I do.\"\n\nI had not been serious with her; having no idea, until now, that she was\nserious herself. But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now\nsaid to her with my whole heart, that her face became a laughing one\nbefore her glittering eyes were dry. She was soon my child-wife indeed;\nsitting down on the floor outside the Chinese House, ringing all the\nlittle bells one after another, to punish Jip for his recent bad\nbehaviour; while Jip lay blinking in the doorway with his head out, even\ntoo lazy to be teased.\n\nThis appeal of Dora's made a strong impression on me. I look back on the\ntime I write of; I invoke the innocent figure that I dearly loved, to\ncome out from the mists and shadows of the past, and turn its gentle\nhead towards me once again; and I can still declare that this one little\nspeech was constantly in my memory. I may not have used it to the best\naccount; I was young and inexperienced; but I never turned a deaf ear to\nits artless pleading.\n\nDora told me, shortly afterwards, that she was going to be a wonderful\nhousekeeper. Accordingly, she polished the tablets, pointed the pencil,\nbought an immense account-book, carefully stitched up with a needle and\nthread all the leaves of the Cookery-Book which Jip had torn, and made\nquite a desperate little attempt \"to be good,\" as she called it. But the\nfigures had the old obstinate propensity--they _would not_ add up. When\nshe had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book, Jip\nwould walk over the page, wagging his tail, and smear them all out. Her\nown little right-hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink;\nand I think that was the only decided result attained.\n\nSometimes, of an evening, when I was at home and at work--for I wrote\na good deal now, and was beginning in a small way to be known as a\nwriter--I would lay down my pen, and watch my child-wife trying to be\ngood. First of all, she would bring out the immense account-book, and\nlay it down upon the table, with a deep sigh. Then she would open it\nat the place where Jip had made it illegible last night, and call Jip\nup, to look at his misdeeds. This would occasion a diversion in Jip's\nfavour, and some inking of his nose, perhaps, as a penalty. Then she\nwould tell Jip to lie down on the table instantly, \"like a lion\"--which\nwas one of his tricks, though I cannot say the likeness was\nstriking--and, if he were in an obedient humor, he would obey. Then she\nwould take up a pen, and begin to write, and find a hair in it. Then\nshe would take up another pen, and begin to write, and find that it\nspluttered. Then she would take up another pen, and begin to write, and\nsay in a low voice, \"Oh, it's a talking pen, and will disturb Doady!\"\nAnd then she would give it up as a bad job, and put the account-book\naway, after pretending to crush the lion with it.\n\nOr, if she were in a very sedate and serious state of mind, she would\nsit down with the tablets, and a little basket of bills and other\ndocuments, which looked more like curl-papers than anything else, and\nendeavour to get some result out of them. After severely comparing\none with another, and making entries on the tablets, and blotting\nthem out, and counting all the fingers of her left hand over and over\nagain, backwards and forwards, she would be so vexed and discouraged,\nand would look so unhappy, that it gave me pain to see her bright face\nclouded--and for me!--and I would go softly to her, and say:\n\n\"What's the matter, Dora?\"\n\nDora would look up hopelessly, and reply, \"They won't come right. They\nmake my head ache so. And they won't do anything I want!\"\n\nThen I would say, \"Now let us try together. Let me show you, Dora.\"\n\nThen I would commence a practical demonstration, to which Dora would pay\nprofound attention, perhaps for five minutes; when she would begin to be\ndreadfully tired, and would lighten the subject by curling my hair, or\ntrying the effect of my face with my shirt collar turned down. If I\ntacitly checked this playfulness, and persisted, she would look so\nscared and disconsolate, as she became more and more bewildered, that\nthe remembrance of her natural gaiety when I first strayed into her\npath, and of her being my child-wife, would come reproachfully upon me;\nand I would lay the pencil down, and call for the guitar.\n\nI had a great deal of work to do, and had many anxieties, but the same\nconsiderations made me keep them to myself. I am far from sure, now,\nthat it was right to do this, but I did it for my child-wife's sake. I\nsearch my breast, and I commit its secrets, if I know them, without any\nreservation to this paper. The old unhappy loss or want of something\nhad, I am conscious, some place in my heart; but not to the embitterment\nof my life. When I walked alone in the fine weather, and thought of the\nsummer days when all the air had been filled with my boyish enchantment,\nI did miss something of the realisation of my dreams; but I thought it\nwas a softened glory of the Past, which nothing could have thrown upon\nthe present time. I did feel, sometimes, for a little while, that I\ncould have wished my wife had been my counsellor; had had more character\nand purpose, to sustain me and improve me by; had been endowed with\npower to fill up the void which somewhere seemed to be about me; but I\nfelt as if this were an unearthly consummation of my happiness, that\nnever had been meant to be, and never could have been.\n\nI was a boyish husband as to years. I had known the softening influence\nof no other sorrows or experiences than those recorded in these leaves.\nIf I did any wrong, as I may have done much, I did it in mistaken love,\nand in my want of wisdom. I write the exact truth. It would avail me\nnothing to extenuate it now.\n\nThus it was that I took upon myself the toils and cares of our life, and\nhad no partner in them. We lived much as before, in reference to our\nscrambling household arrangements; but I had got used to those, and Dora\nI was pleased to see was seldom vexed now. She was bright and cheerful\nin the old childish way, loved me dearly, and was happy with her old\ntrifles.\n\nWhen the debates were heavy--I mean as to length, not quality, for in\nthe last respect they were not often otherwise--and I went home late,\nDora would never rest when she heard my footsteps, but would always come\ndown stairs to meet me. When my evenings were unoccupied by the pursuit\nfor which I had qualified myself with so much pains, and I was engaged\nin writing at home, she would sit quietly near me, however late the\nhour, and be so mute, that I would often think she had dropped asleep.\nBut generally, when I raised my head, I saw her blue eyes looking at me\nwith the quiet attention of which I have already spoken.\n\n\"Oh, what a weary boy!\" said Dora one night, when I met her eyes as I\nwas shutting up my desk.\n\n\"What a weary girl!\" said I. \"That's more to the purpose. You must go to\nbed another time, my love. It's far too late for you.\"\n\n\"No, don't send me to bed!\" pleaded Dora, coming to my side. \"Pray don't\ndo that!\"\n\n\"Dora!\"\n\nTo my amazement she was sobbing on my neck.\n\n\"Not well, my dear! not happy!\"\n\n\"Yes! quite well, and very happy!\" said Dora. \"But say you'll let me\nstop, and see you write.\"\n\n\"Why, what a sight for such bright eyes at midnight!\" I replied.\n\n\"Are they bright, though?\" returned Dora, laughing. \"I'm so glad they're\nbright.\"\n\n\"Little Vanity!\" said I.\n\nBut it was not vanity; it was only harmless delight in my admiration. I\nknew that very well, before she told me so.\n\n\"If you think them pretty, say I may always stop, and see you write!\"\nsaid Dora. \"_Do_ you think them pretty?\"\n\n\"Very pretty.\"\n\n\"Then let me always stop and see you write.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that won't improve their brightness, Dora.\"\n\n\"Yes it will! Because, you clever boy, you'll not forget me then, while\nyou are full of silent fancies. Will you mind it, if I say something\nvery, very silly?--more than usual?\" inquired Dora, peeping over my\nshoulder into my face.\n\n\"What wonderful thing is that?\" said I.\n\n\"Please let me hold the pens,\" said Dora. \"I want to have something to\ndo with all those many hours when you are so industrious. May I hold the\npens?\"\n\nThe remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes, brings tears into my\neyes. The next time I sat down to write, and regularly afterwards, she\nsat in her old place with a spare bundle of pens at her side. Her\ntriumph in this connexion with my work, and her delight when I wanted a\nnew pen--which I very often feigned to do--suggested to me a new way of\npleasing my child-wife. I occasionally made a pretence of wanting a page\nor two of manuscript copied. Then Dora was in her glory. The\npreparations she made for this great work, the aprons she put on, the\nbibs she borrowed from the kitchen to keep off the ink, the time she\ntook, the innumerable stoppages she made to have a laugh with Jip as if\nhe understood it all, her conviction that her work was incomplete unless\nshe signed her name at the end, and the way in which she would bring it\nto me, like a school-copy, and then, when I praised it, clasp me round\nthe neck, are touching recollections to me, simple as they might appear\nto other men.\n\nShe took possession of the keys soon after this, and went jingling about\nthe house with the whole bunch in a little basket, tied to her slender\nwaist. I seldom found that the places to which they belonged were\nlocked, or that they were of any use except as a plaything for Jip--but\nDora was pleased, and that pleased me. She was quite satisfied that a\ngood deal was effected by this make-belief of housekeeping; and was as\nmerry as if we had been keeping a baby-house, for a joke.\n\nSo we went on. Dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than to me,\nand often told her of the time when she was afraid she was \"a cross old\nthing.\" I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone. She\ncourted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, day after day, to the\nguitar, though I am afraid she had no taste for music; never attacked\nthe Incapables, though the temptation must have been severe; went\nwonderful distances on foot to purchase, as surprises, any trifles that\nshe found out Dora wanted; and never came in by the garden, and missed\nher from the room, but she would call out, at the foot of the stairs, in\na voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house:\n\n\"Where's Little Blossom!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nMR. DICK FULFILS MY AUNT'S PREDICTION.\n\n\nIt was some time now, since I had left the Doctor. Living in his\nneighbourhood, I saw him frequently; and we all went to his house on two\nor three occasions to dinner or tea. The Old Soldier was in permanent\nquarters under the Doctor's roof. She was exactly the same as ever, and\nthe same immortal butterflies hovered over her cap.\n\nLike some other mothers, whom I have known in the course of my life,\nMrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was. She\nrequired a great deal of amusement, and, like a deep old soldier,\npretended, in consulting her own inclinations, to be devoting herself to\nher child. The Doctor's desire that Annie should be entertained, was\ntherefore particularly acceptable to this excellent parent; who\nexpressed unqualified approval of his discretion.\n\nI have no doubt, indeed, that she probed the Doctor's wound without\nknowing it. Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and\nselfishness, not always inseparable from full-blown years, I think she\nconfirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young wife,\nand that there was no congeniality of feeling between them, by so\nstrongly commending his design of lightening the load of her life.\n\n\"My dear soul,\" she said to him one day when I was present, \"you know\nthere is no doubt it would be a little pokey for Annie to be always shut\nup here.\"\n\nThe Doctor nodded his benevolent head.\n\n\"When she comes to her mother's age,\" said Mrs. Markleham, with a\nflourish of her fan, \"then, it'll be another thing. You might put ME\ninto a Jail, with genteel society and a rubber, and I should never care\nto come out. But I am not Annie, you know; and Annie is not her mother.\"\n\n\"Surely, surely,\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"You are the best of creatures--no, I beg your pardon!\" for the Doctor\nmade a gesture of depreciation, \"I must say before your face, as I\nalways say behind your back, you are the best of creatures; but of\ncourse you don't--now do you?--enter into the same pursuits and fancies\nas Annie?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Doctor, in a sorrowful tone.\n\n\"No, of course not,\" retorted the Old Soldier. \"Take your Dictionary\nfor example. What a useful work a Dictionary is! What a necessary work!\nThe meanings of words! Without Doctor Johnson, or somebody of that\nsort, we might have been at this present moment calling an Italian-iron\na bedstead. But we can't expect a Dictionary--especially when it's\nmaking--to interest Annie, can we?\"\n\nThe Doctor shook his head.\n\n\"And that's why I so much approve,\" said Mrs. Markleham, tapping him on\nthe shoulder with her shut-up fan, \"of your thoughtfulness. It shows\nthat you don't expect, as many elderly people do expect, old heads on\nyoung shoulders. You have studied Annie's character, and you understand\nit. _That's_ what I find so charming!\"\n\nEven the calm and patient face of Doctor Strong expressed some little\nsense of pain, I thought, under the infliction of these compliments.\n\n\"Therefore, my dear Doctor,\" said the Soldier, giving him several\naffectionate taps, \"you may command me, at all times and seasons. Now,\ndo understand that I am entirely at your service. I am ready to go with\nAnnie to operas, concerts, exhibitions, all kinds of places; and you\nshall never find that I am tired. Duty, my dear Doctor, before every\nconsideration in the universe!\"\n\nShe was as good as her word. She was one of those people who can bear\na great deal of pleasure, and she never flinched in her perseverance\nin the cause. She seldom got hold of the newspaper (which she settled\nherself down in the softest chair in the house to read through an\neye-glass, every day, for two hours), but she found out something that\nshe was certain Annie would like to see. It was in vain for Annie to\nprotest that she was weary of such things. Her mother's remonstrance\nalways was, \"Now, my dear Annie, I am sure you know better; and I must\ntell you, my love, that you are not making a proper return for the\nkindness of Doctor Strong.\"\n\nThis was usually said in the Doctor's presence, and appeared to me to\nconstitute Annie's principal inducement for withdrawing her objections\nwhen she made any. But in general she resigned herself to her mother,\nand went where the Old Soldier would.\n\nIt rarely happened now that Mr. Maldon accompanied them. Sometimes my\naunt and Dora were invited to do so, and accepted the invitation.\nSometimes Dora only was asked. The time had been, when I should have\nbeen uneasy in her going; but reflection on what had passed that former\nnight in the Doctor's study, had made a change in my mistrust. I\nbelieved that the Doctor was right, and I had no worse suspicions.\n\nMy aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone with me,\nand said she couldn't make it out; she wished they were happier; she\ndidn't think our military friend (so she always called the Old Soldier)\nmended the matter at all. My aunt further expressed her opinion \"that if\nour military friend would cut off those butterflies, and give 'em to the\nchimney-sweepers for May-day, it would look like the beginning of\nsomething sensible on her part.\"\n\nBut her abiding reliance was on Mr. Dick. That man had evidently an idea\nin his head, she said; and if he could only once pen it up into a\ncorner, which was his great difficulty, he would distinguish himself in\nsome extraordinary manner.\n\nUnconscious of this prediction, Mr. Dick continued to occupy precisely\nthe same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong. He seemed\nneither to advance nor to recede. He appeared to have settled into his\noriginal foundation, like a building; and I must confess that my faith\nin his ever moving, was not much greater than if he had been a building.\n\nBut one night, when I had been married some months, Mr. Dick put his\nhead into the parlor, where I was writing alone (Dora having gone out\nwith my aunt to take tea with the two little birds), and said, with a\nsignificant cough:\n\n\"You couldn't speak to me without inconveniencing yourself, Trotwood, I\nam afraid?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Dick,\" said I; \"come in!\"\n\n\"Trotwood,\" said Mr. Dick, laying his finger on the side of his nose,\nafter he had shaken hands with me. \"Before I sit down, I wish to make an\nobservation. You know your aunt?\"\n\n\"A little,\" I replied.\n\n\"She is the most wonderful woman in the world, sir!\"\n\nAfter the delivery of this communication, which he shot out of himself\nas if he were loaded with it, Mr. Dick sat down with greater gravity\nthan usual, and looked at me.\n\n\"Now, boy,\" said Mr. Dick, \"I am going to put a question to you.\"\n\n\"As many as you please,\" said I.\n\n\"What do you consider me, sir?\" asked Mr. Dick, folding his arms.\n\n\"A dear old friend,\" said I.\n\n\"Thank you, Trotwood,\" returned Mr. Dick, laughing, and reaching across\nin high glee to shake hands with me. \"But I mean, boy,\" resuming his\ngravity, \"what do you consider me in this respect?\" touching his\nforehead.\n\nI was puzzled how to answer, but he helped me with a word.\n\n\"Weak?\" said Mr. Dick.\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, dubiously. \"Rather so.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" cried Mr. Dick, who seemed quite enchanted by my reply. \"That\nis, Trotwood, when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-who's\nhead, and put it you know where, there was a----\" Mr. Dick made his two\nhands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times, and\nthen brought them into collision, and rolled them over and over one\nanother, to express confusion. \"There was that sort of thing done to me\nsomehow? Eh?\"\n\nI nodded at him, and he nodded back again.\n\n\"In short, boy,\" said Mr. Dick, dropping his voice to a whisper, \"I am\nsimple.\"\n\nI would have qualified that conclusion, but he stopped me.\n\n\"Yes, I am! She pretends I am not. She won't hear of it; but I am. I\nknow I am. If she hadn't stood my friend, sir, I should have been shut\nup, to lead a dismal life these many years. But I'll provide for her! I\nnever spend the copying money. I put it in a box. I have made a will.\nI'll leave it all to her. She shall be rich--noble!\"\n\nMr. Dick took out his pocket-handkerchief, and wiped his eyes. He then\nfolded it up with great care, pressed it smooth between his two hands,\nput it in his pocket, and seemed to put my aunt away with it.\n\n\"Now you are a scholar, Trotwood,\" said Mr. Dick. \"You are a fine\nscholar. You know what a learned man, what a great man, the Doctor is.\nYou know what honor he has always done me. Not proud in his wisdom.\nHumble, humble--condescending even to poor Dick, who is simple and knows\nnothing. I have sent his name up, on a scrap of paper, to the kite,\nalong the string, when it has been in the sky, among the larks. The kite\nhas been glad to receive it, sir, and the sky has been brighter with\nit.\"\n\nI delighted him by saying, most heartily, that the Doctor was deserving\nof our best respect and highest esteem.\n\n\"And his beautiful wife is a star,\" said Mr. Dick. \"A shining star. I\nhave seen her shine, sir. But,\" bringing his chair nearer, and laying\none hand upon my knee--\"clouds, sir--clouds.\"\n\nI answered the solicitude which his face expressed, by conveying the\nsame expression into my own, and shaking my head.\n\n\"What clouds?\" said Mr. Dick.\n\nHe looked so wistfully into my face, and was so anxious to understand,\nthat I took great pains to answer him slowly and distinctly, as I might\nhave entered on an explanation to a child.\n\n\"There is some unfortunate division between them,\" I replied. \"Some\nunhappy cause of separation. A secret. It may be inseparable from the\ndiscrepancy in their years. It may have grown up out of almost nothing.\"\n\nMr. Dick, who told off every sentence with a thoughtful nod, paused when\nI had done, and sat considering, with his eyes upon my face, and his\nhand upon my knee.\n\n\"Doctor not angry with her, Trotwood?\" he said, after some time.\n\n\"No. Devoted to her.\"\n\n\"Then, I have got it, boy!\" said Mr. Dick.\n\nThe sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee, and leaned\nback in his chair, with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could\npossibly lift them, made me think him farther out of his wits than\never. He became as suddenly grave again, and leaning forward as before,\nsaid--first respectfully taking out his pocket-handkerchief, as if it\nreally did represent my aunt:\n\n\"Most wonderful woman in the world, Trotwood. Why has _she_ done nothing\nto set things right?\"\n\n\"Too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference,\" I replied.\n\n\"Fine scholar,\" said Mr. Dick, touching me with his finger. \"Why has\n_he_ done nothing.\"\n\n\"For the same reason,\" I returned.\n\n\"Then, I have got it, boy!\" said Mr. Dick. And he stood up before me,\nmore exultingly than before, nodding his head, and striking himself\nrepeatedly upon the breast, until one might have supposed that he had\nnearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body.\n\n\"A poor fellow with a craze, sir,\" said Mr. Dick, \"a simpleton, a\nweak-minded person--present company, you know!\" striking himself again,\n\"may do what wonderful people may not do. I'll bring them together,\nboy. I'll try. They'll not blame _me_. They'll not object to _me_.\nThey'll not mind what _I_ do, if it's wrong. I'm only Mr. Dick. And\nwho minds Dick? Dick's nobody! Whoo!\" He blew a slight, contemptuous\nbreath, as if he blew himself away.\n\nIt was fortunate he had proceeded so far with his mystery, for we heard\nthe coach stop at the little garden gate, which brought my aunt and Dora\nhome.\n\n\"Not a word, boy!\" he pursued in a whisper; \"leave all the blame with\nDick--simple Dick--mad Dick. I have been thinking, sir, for some time\nthat I was getting it, and now I have got it. After what you have said\nto me, I am sure I have got it. All right!\"\n\nNot another word did Mr. Dick utter on the subject; but he made a very\ntelegraph of himself for the next half-hour (to the great disturbance of\nmy aunt's mind), to enjoin inviolable secresy on me.\n\nTo my surprise I heard no more about it for some two or three weeks,\nthough I was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours;\ndescrying a strange gleam of good sense--I say nothing of good feeling,\nfor that he always exhibited--in the conclusion to which he had come. At\nlast I began to believe, that, in the flighty and unsettled state of his\nmind, he had either forgotten his intention or abandoned it.\n\nOne fair evening, when Dora was not inclined to go out, my aunt and I\nstrolled up to the Doctor's cottage. It was autumn, when there were no\ndebates to vex the evening air; and I remember how the leaves smelt like\nour garden at Blunderstone as we trod them under foot, and how the old,\nunhappy feeling, seemed to go by, on the sighing wind.\n\nIt was twilight when we reached the cottage. Mrs. Strong was just coming\nout of the garden, where Mr. Dick yet lingered, busy with his knife,\nhelping the gardener to point some stakes. The Doctor was engaged with\nsome one in his study; but the visitor would be gone directly, Mrs.\nStrong said, and begged us to remain and see him. We went into the\ndrawing-room with her, and sat down by the darkening window. There was\nnever any ceremony about the visits of such old friends and neighbours\nas we were.\n\nWe had not sat here many minutes, when Mrs. Markleham, who usually\ncontrived to be in a fuss about something, came bustling in, with her\nnewspaper in her hand, and said, out of breath, \"My goodness gracious,\nAnnie, why didn't you tell me there was some one in the Study!\"\n\n\"My dear mama,\" she quietly returned, \"how could I know that you desired\nthe information!\"\n\n\"Desired the information!\" said Mrs. Markleham, sinking on the sofa. \"I\nnever had such a turn in all my life!\"\n\n\"Have you been to the Study then, mama?\" asked Annie.\n\n\"_Been_ to the Study, my dear!\" she returned emphatically. \"Indeed I\nhave! I came upon the amiable creature--if you'll imagine my feelings,\nMiss Trotwood and David--in the act of making his will.\"\n\nHer daughter looked round from the window quickly.\n\n\"In the act, my dear Annie,\" repeated Mrs. Markleham, spreading the\nnewspaper on her lap like a table-cloth, and patting her hands upon it,\n\"of making his last Will and Testament. The foresight and affection\nof the dear! I must tell you how it was. I really must, in justice to\nthe darling--for he is nothing less!--tell you how it was. Perhaps\nyou know, Miss Trotwood, that there is never a candle lighted in this\nhouse, until one's eyes are literally falling out of one's head with\nbeing stretched to read the paper. And that there is not a chair in\nthis house, in which a paper can be what _I_ call, read, except one in\nthe Study. This took me to the Study, where I saw a light. I opened the\ndoor. In company with the dear Doctor were two professional people,\nevidently connected with the law, and they were all three standing\nat the table: the darling Doctor pen in hand. 'This simply expresses\nthen,' said the Doctor--Annie, my love, attend to the very words--'this\nsimply expresses then, gentlemen, the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong,\nand gives her all unconditionally?' One of the professional people\nreplied, 'And gives her all unconditionally.' Upon that, with the\nnatural feelings of a mother, I said, 'Good God, I beg your pardon!'\nfell over the door-step, and came away through the little back passage\nwhere the pantry is.\"\n\nMrs. Strong opened the window, and went out into the verandah, where she\nstood leaning against a pillar.\n\n\"But now isn't it, Miss Trotwood, isn't it, David, invigorating,\" said\nMrs. Markleham, mechanically following her with her eyes, \"to find a man\nat Doctor Strong's time of life, with the strength of mind to do this\nkind of thing? It only shows how right I was. I said to Annie, when\nDoctor Strong paid a very flattering visit to myself, and made her the\nsubject of a declaration and an offer, I said, 'My dear, there is no\ndoubt whatever, in my opinion, with reference to a suitable provision\nfor you, that Doctor Strong will do more than he binds himself to do.'\"\n\nHere the bell rang, and we heard the sound of the visitors' feet as they\nwent out.\n\n\"It's all over, no doubt,\" said the Old Soldier, after listening; \"the\ndear creature has signed, sealed, and delivered, and his mind's at rest.\nWell it may be! What a mind! Annie, my love, I am going to the Study\nwith my paper, for I am a poor creature without news. Miss Trotwood,\nDavid, pray come and see the Doctor.\"\n\nI was conscious of Mr. Dick's standing in the shadow of the room,\nshutting up his knife, when we accompanied her to the Study; and of my\naunt's rubbing her nose violently, by the way, as a mild vent for her\nintolerance of our military friend; but who got first into the Study, or\nhow Mrs. Markleham settled herself in a moment in her easy chair, or how\nmy aunt and I came to be left together near the door (unless her eyes\nwere quicker than mine, and she held me back), I have forgotten, if I\never knew. But this I know,--that we saw the Doctor before he saw us,\nsitting at his table, among the folio volumes in which he delighted,\nresting his head calmly on his hand. That, in the same moment, we saw\nMrs. Strong glide in, pale and trembling. That Mr. Dick supported her on\nhis arm. That he laid his other hand upon the Doctor's arm, causing him\nto look up with an abstracted air. That, as the Doctor moved his head,\nhis wife dropped down on one knee at his feet, and, with her hands\nimploringly lifted, fixed upon his face the memorable look I had never\nforgotten. That at this sight Mrs. Markleham dropped the newspaper, and\nstared more like a figure-head intended for a ship to be called The\nAstonishment, than anything else I can think of.\n\n  [Illustration: Mr. Dick fulfils my Aunt's prediction.]\n\nThe gentleness of the Doctor's manner and surprise, the dignity that\nmingled with the supplicating attitude of his wife, the amiable concern\nof Mr. Dick, and the earnestness with which my aunt said to herself,\n\"_That_ man mad!\" (triumphantly expressive of the misery from which she\nhad saved him), I see and hear, rather than remember, as I write about\nit.\n\n\"Doctor!\" said Mr. Dick. \"What is it that's amiss? Look here!\"\n\n\"Annie!\" cried the Doctor. \"Not at my feet, my dear!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"I beg and pray that no one will leave the room! Oh, my\nhusband and father, break this long silence. Let us both know what it is\nthat has come between us!\"\n\nMrs. Markleham, by this time recovering the power of speech, and seeming\nto swell with family pride and motherly indignation, here exclaimed,\n\"Annie, get up immediately, and don't disgrace everybody belonging to\nyou by humbling yourself like that, unless you wish to see me go out of\nmy mind on the spot!\"\n\n\"Mama!\" returned Annie. \"Waste no words on me, for my appeal is to my\nhusband, and even you are nothing here.\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" exclaimed Mrs. Markleham. \"Me, nothing! The child has taken\nleave of her senses. Please to get me a glass of water!\"\n\nI was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife, to give any heed to this\nrequest; and it made no impression on anybody else; so Mrs. Markleham\npanted, stared, and fanned herself.\n\n\"Annie!\" said the Doctor, tenderly taking her in his hands. \"My dear! If\nany unavoidable change has come, in the sequence of time, upon our\nmarried life, you are not to blame. The fault is mine, and only mine.\nThere is no change in my affection, admiration, and respect. I wish to\nmake you happy. I truly love and honor you. Rise, Annie, pray!\"\n\nBut she did not rise. After looking at him for a little while, she sank\ndown closer to him, laid her arm across his knee, and dropping her head\nupon it, said:\n\n\"If I have any friend here, who can speak one word for me, or for my\nhusband, in this matter; if I have any friend here, who can give a voice\nto any suspicion that my heart has sometimes whispered to me; if I have\nany friend here, who honors my husband, or has ever cared for me, and\nhas anything within his knowledge, no matter what it is, that may help\nto mediate between us, I implore that friend to speak!\"\n\nThere was a profound silence. After a few moments of painful hesitation,\nI broke the silence.\n\n\"Mrs. Strong,\" I said, \"there is something within my knowledge, which I\nhave been earnestly entreated by Doctor Strong to conceal, and have\nconcealed until to-night. But, I believe the time has come when it would\nbe mistaken faith and delicacy to conceal it any longer, and when your\nappeal absolves me from his injunction.\"\n\nShe turned her face towards me for a moment, and I knew that I was\nright. I could not have resisted its entreaty, if the assurance that it\ngave me had been less convincing.\n\n\"Our future peace,\" she said, \"may be in your hands. I trust it\nconfidently to your not suppressing anything. I know beforehand that\nnothing you, or any one, can tell me, will show my husband's noble heart\nin any other light than one. Howsoever it may seem to you to touch me,\ndisregard that. I will speak for myself, before him, and before God\nafterwards.\"\n\nThus earnestly besought, I made no reference to the Doctor for his\npermission, but, without any other compromise of the truth than a little\nsoftening of the coarseness of Uriah Heep, related plainly what had\npassed in that same room that night. The staring of Mrs. Markleham\nduring the whole narration, and the shrill, sharp interjections with\nwhich she occasionally interrupted it, defy description.\n\nWhen I had finished, Annie remained, for some few moments, silent, with\nher head bent down, as I have described. Then, she took the Doctor's\nhand (he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had entered the\nroom), and pressed it to her breast, and kissed it. Mr. Dick softly\nraised her; and she stood, when she began to speak, leaning on him, and\nlooking down upon her husband--from whom she never turned her eyes.\n\n\"All that has ever been in my mind, since I was married,\" she said in a\nlow, submissive, tender voice, \"I will lay bare before you. I could not\nlive and have one reservation, knowing what I know now.\"\n\n\"Nay, Annie,\" said the Doctor, mildly, \"I have never doubted you, my\nchild. There is no need; indeed there is no need, my dear.\"\n\n\"There is great need,\" she answered, in the same way, \"that I should\nopen my whole heart before the soul of generosity and truth, whom, year\nby year, and day by day, I have loved and venerated more and more, as\nHeaven knows!\"\n\n\"Really,\" interrupted Mrs. Markleham, \"if I have any discretion at\nall--\"\n\n(\"Which you haven't, you Marplot,\" observed my aunt, in an indignant\nwhisper.)\n\n--\"I must be permitted to observe that it cannot be requisite to enter\ninto these details.\"\n\n\"No one but my husband can judge of that, mama,\" said Annie, without\nremoving her eyes from his face, \"and he will hear me. If I say anything\nto give you pain, mama, forgive me. I have borne pain first, often and\nlong, myself.\"\n\n\"Upon my word!\" gasped Mrs. Markleham.\n\n\"When I was very young,\" said Annie, \"quite a little child, my first\nassociations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a patient\nfriend and teacher--the friend of my dead father--who was always dear to\nme. I can remember nothing that I know, without remembering him. He\nstored my mind with its first treasures, and stamped his character upon\nthem all. They never could have been, I think, as good as they have been\nto me, if I had taken them from any other hands.\"\n\n\"Makes her mother nothing!\" exclaimed Mrs. Markleham.\n\n\"Not so, mama,\" said Annie; \"but I make him what he was. I must do that.\nAs I grew up, he occupied the same place still. I was proud of his\ninterest: deeply, fondly, gratefully attached to him. I looked up to him\nI can hardly describe how--as a father, as a guide, as one whose praise\nwas different from all other praise, as one in whom I could have trusted\nand confided, if I had doubted all the world. You know, mama, how young\nand inexperienced I was, when you presented him before me, of a sudden,\nas a lover.\"\n\n\"I have mentioned the fact, fifty times at least, to everybody here!\"\nsaid Mrs. Markleham.\n\n(\"Then hold your tongue, for the Lord's sake, and don't mention it any\nmore!\" muttered my aunt).\n\n\"It was so great a change: so great a loss, I felt it, at first,\" said\nAnnie, still preserving the same look and tone, \"that I was agitated and\ndistressed. I was but a girl; and when so great a change came in the\ncharacter in which I had so long looked up to him, I think I was sorry.\nBut nothing could have made him what he used to be again; and I was\nproud that he should think me so worthy, and we were married.\"\n\n\"--At Saint Alphage, Canterbury,\" observed Mrs. Markleham.\n\n(\"Confound the woman!\" said my aunt, \"she _won't_ be quiet!\")\n\n\"I never thought,\" proceeded Annie, with a heightened color, \"of any\nworldly gain that my husband would bring to me. My young heart had no\nroom in its homage for any such poor reference. Mama, forgive me when I\nsay that it was _you_ who first presented to my mind the thought that\nany one could wrong me, and wrong him, by such a cruel suspicion.\"\n\n\"Me!\" cried Mrs. Markleham.\n\n(\"Ah! You, to be sure!\" observed my aunt, \"and you can't fan it away, my\nmilitary friend!\")\n\n\"It was the first unhappiness of my new life,\" said Annie. \"It was the\nfirst occasion of every unhappy moment I have known. Those moments have\nbeen more, of late, than I can count; but not--my generous husband!--not\nfor the reason you suppose; for in my heart there is not a thought, a\nrecollection, or a hope, that any power could separate from you!\"\n\nShe raised her eyes, and clasped her hands, and looked as beautiful and\ntrue, I thought, as any Spirit. The Doctor looked on her, henceforth, as\nstedfastly as she on him.\n\n\"Mama is blameless,\" she went on, \"of having ever urged you for\nherself, and she is blameless in intention everyway, I am sure,--but\nwhen I saw how many importunate claims that were no claims were\npressed upon you in my name; how you were traded on in my name; how\ngenerous you were, and how Mr. Wickfield, who had your welfare very\nmuch at heart, resented it; the first sense of my exposure to the mean\nsuspicion that my tenderness was bought--and sold to you, of all men,\non earth--fell upon me, like unmerited disgrace, in which I forced you\nto participate. I cannot tell you what it was--mama cannot imagine what\nit was--to have this dread and trouble always on my mind, yet know in\nmy own soul that on my marriage-day I crowned the love and honor of my\nlife!\"\n\n\"A specimen of the thanks one gets,\" cried Mrs. Markleham, in tears,\n\"for taking care of one's family! I wish I was a Turk!\"\n\n(\"I wish you were, with all my heart--and in your native country!\" said\nmy aunt).\n\n\"It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my Cousin\nMaldon. I had liked him:\" she spoke softly, but without any hesitation:\n\"very much. We had been little lovers once. If circumstances had not\nhappened otherwise, I might have come to persuade myself that I really\nloved him, and might have married him, and been most wretched. There can\nbe no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose.\"\n\nI pondered on those words, even while I was studiously attending to what\nfollowed, as if they had some particular interest, or some strange\napplication that I could not divine. \"There can be no disparity in\nmarriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose\"--\"no disparity in\nmarriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose.\"\n\n\"There is nothing,\" said Annie, \"that we have in common. I have long\nfound that there is nothing. If I were thankful to my husband for no\nmore, instead of for so much, I should be thankful to him for having\nsaved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart.\"\n\nShe stood quite still, before the Doctor, and spoke with an earnestness\nthat thrilled me. Yet her voice was just as quiet as before.\n\n\"When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence, so freely\nbestowed for my sake, and when I was unhappy in the mercenary shape I\nwas made to wear, I thought it would have become him better to have\nworked his own way on. I thought that if I had been he, I would have\ntried to do it, at the cost of almost any hardship. But I thought no\nworse of him, until the night of his departure for India. That night I\nknew he had a false and thankless heart. I saw a double meaning, then,\nin Mr. Wickfield's scrutiny of me. I perceived, for the first time, the\ndark suspicion that shadowed my life.\"\n\n\"Suspicion, Annie!\" said the Doctor. \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\"In your mind there was none, I know, my husband!\" she returned. \"And\nwhen I came to you, that night, to lay down all my load of shame and\ngrief, and knew that I had to tell, that, underneath your roof, one of\nmy own kindred, to whom you had been a benefactor, for the love of me,\nhad spoken to me words that should have found no utterance, even if I\nhad been the weak and mercenary wretch he thought me--my mind revolted\nfrom the taint the very tale conveyed. It died upon my lips, and from\nthat hour till now has never passed them.\"\n\nMrs. Markleham, with a short groan, leaned back in her easy chair; and\nretired behind her fan, as if she were never coming out any more.\n\n\"I have never, but in your presence, interchanged a word with him from\nthat time; then, only when it has been necessary for the avoidance of\nthis explanation. Years have passed since he knew, from me, what his\nsituation here was. The kindnesses you have secretly done for his\nadvancement, and then disclosed to me, for my surprise and pleasure,\nhave been, you will believe, but aggravations of the unhappiness and\nburden of my secret.\"\n\nShe sunk down gently at the Doctor's feet, though he did his utmost to\nprevent her; and said, looking up, tearfully, into his face:\n\n\"Do not speak to me yet! Let me say a little more! Right or wrong, if\nthis were to be done again, I think I should do just the same. You never\ncan know what it was to be devoted to you, with those old associations;\nto find that any one could be so hard as to suppose that the truth of my\nheart was bartered away, and to be surrounded by appearances confirming\nthat belief. I was very young, and had no adviser. Between mama and me,\nin all relating to you, there was a wide division. If I shrunk into\nmyself, hiding the disrespect I had undergone, it was because I honored\nyou so much, and so much wished that you should honor me!\"\n\n\"Annie, my pure heart!\" said the Doctor, \"my dear girl!\"\n\n\"A little more! a very few words more! I used to think there were so\nmany whom you might have married, who would not have brought such charge\nand trouble on you, and who would have made your home a worthier home. I\nused to be afraid that I had better have remained your pupil, and almost\nyour child. I used to fear that I was so unsuited to your learning and\nwisdom. If all this made me shrink within myself (as indeed it did),\nwhen I had that to tell, it was still because I honored you so much, and\nhoped that you might one day honor me.\"\n\n\"That day has shone this long time, Annie,\" said the Doctor, \"and can\nhave but one long night, my dear.\"\n\n\"Another word! I afterwards meant--stedfastly meant, and purposed to\nmyself--to bear the whole weight of knowing the unworthiness of one\nto whom you had been so good. And now a last word, dearest and best\nof friends! The cause of the late change in you, which I have seen\nwith so much pain and sorrow, and have sometimes referred to my old\napprehension--at other times to lingering suppositions nearer to\nthe truth--has been made clear to-night; and by an accident I have\nalso come to know, to-night, the full measure of your noble trust in\nme, even under that mistake. I do not hope that any love and duty\nI may render in return, will ever make me worthy of your priceless\nconfidence; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me, I can lift my\neyes to this dear face, revered as a father's, loved as a husband's,\nsacred to me in my childhood as a friend's, and solemnly declare that\nin my lightest thought I have never wronged you; never wavered in the\nlove and the fidelity I owe you!\"\n\nShe had her arms around the Doctor's neck, and he leant his head down\nover her, mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses.\n\n\"Oh, hold me to your heart, my husband! Never cast me out! Do not think\nor speak of disparity between us, for there is none, except in all my\nmany imperfections. Every succeeding year I have known this better, as I\nhave esteemed you more and more. Oh, take me to your heart, my husband,\nfor my love was founded on a rock, and it endures!\"\n\nIn the silence that ensued, my aunt walked gravely up to Mr. Dick,\nwithout at all hurrying herself, and gave him a hug and a sounding kiss.\nAnd it was very fortunate, with a view to his credit, that she did so;\nfor I am confident that I detected him at that moment in the act of\nmaking preparations to stand on one leg, as an appropriate expression of\ndelight.\n\n\"You are a very remarkable man, Dick!\" said my aunt, with an air of\nunqualified approbation; \"and never pretend to be anything else, for I\nknow better!\"\n\nWith that, my aunt pulled him by the sleeve, and nodded to me; and we\nthree stole quietly out of the room, and came away.\n\n\"That's a settler for our military friend, at any rate,\" said my aunt,\non the way home. \"I should sleep the better for that, if there was\nnothing else to be glad of!\"\n\n\"She was quite overcome, I am afraid,\" said Mr. Dick, with great\ncommiseration.\n\n\"What! Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?\" inquired my aunt.\n\n\"I don't think I ever saw a crocodile,\" returned Mr. Dick, mildly.\n\n\"There never would have been anything the matter, if it hadn't been for\nthat old Animal,\" said my aunt, with strong emphasis. \"It's very much to\nbe wished that some mothers would leave their daughters alone after\nmarriage, and not be so violently affectionate. They seem to think the\nonly return that can be made them for bringing an unfortunate young\nwoman into the world--God bless my soul, as if she asked to be brought,\nor wanted to come!--is full liberty to worry her out of it again. What\nare you thinking of, Trot?\"\n\nI was thinking of all that had been said. My mind was still running on\nsome of the expressions used. \"There can be no disparity in marriage\nlike unsuitability of mind and purpose.\" \"The first mistaken impulse of\nan undisciplined heart.\" \"My love was founded on a rock.\" But we were at\nhome; and the trodden leaves were lying under-foot, and the autumn wind\nwas blowing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nINTELLIGENCE.\n\n\nI must have been married, if I may trust to my imperfect memory for\ndates, about a year or so, when one evening, as I was returning from a\nsolitary walk, thinking of the book I was then writing--for my success\nhad steadily increased with my steady application, and I was engaged at\nthat time upon my first work of fiction--I came past Mrs. Steerforth's\nhouse. I had often passed it before, during my residence in that\nneighbourhood, though never when I could choose another road. Howbeit,\nit did sometimes happen that it was not easy to find another, without\nmaking a long circuit; and so I had passed that way, upon the whole,\npretty often.\n\nI had never done more than glance at the house, as I went by with a\nquickened step. It had been uniformly gloomy and dull. None of the best\nrooms abutted on the road; and the narrow, heavily-framed old-fashioned\nwindows, never cheerful under any circumstances, looked very dismal,\nclose shut, and with their blinds always drawn down. There was a covered\nway across a little paved court, to an entrance that was never used; and\nthere was one round staircase window, at odds with all the rest, and the\nonly one unshaded by a blind, which had the same unoccupied blank look.\nI do not remember that I ever saw a light in all the house. If I had\nbeen a casual passer-by, I should have probably supposed that some\nchildless person lay dead in it. If I had happily possessed no knowledge\nof the place, and had seen it often in that changeless state, I should\nhave pleased my fancy with many ingenious speculations, I dare say.\n\nAs it was, I thought as little of it as I might. But my mind could not\ngo by it and leave it, as my body did; and it usually awakened a long\ntrain of meditations. Coming before me, on this particular evening that\nI mention, mingled with the childish recollections and later fancies,\nthe ghosts of half-formed hopes, the broken shadows of disappointments\ndimly seen and understood, the blending of experience and imagination,\nincidental to the occupation with which my thoughts had been busy, it\nwas more than commonly suggestive. I fell into a brown study as I walked\non, and a voice at my side made me start.\n\nIt was a woman's voice, too. I was not long in recollecting Mrs.\nSteerforth's little parlor-maid, who had formerly worn blue ribbons in\nher cap. She had taken them out now, to adapt herself, I suppose, to the\naltered character of the house; and wore but one or two disconsolate\nbows of sober brown.\n\n\"If you please, sir, would you have the goodness to walk in, and speak\nto Miss Dartle?\"\n\n\"Has Miss Dartle sent you for me?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Not to-night, sir, but it's just the same. Miss Dartle saw you pass a\nnight or two ago; and I was to sit at work on the staircase, and when I\nsaw you pass again, to ask you to step in and speak to her.\"\n\nI turned back, and inquired of my conductor, as we went along, how Mrs.\nSteerforth was. She said her lady was but poorly, and kept her own room\na good deal.\n\nWhen we arrived at the house, I was directed to Miss Dartle in the\ngarden, and left to make my presence known to her myself. She was\nsitting on a seat at one end of a kind of terrace, overlooking the great\ncity. It was a sombre evening, with a lurid light in the sky; and as I\nsaw the prospect scowling in the distance, with here and there some\nlarger object starting up into the sullen glare, I fancied it was no\ninapt companion to the memory of this fierce woman.\n\nShe saw me as I advanced, and rose for a moment to receive me. I thought\nher, then, still more colorless and thin than when I had seen her last;\nthe flashing eyes still brighter, and the scar still plainer.\n\nOur meeting was not cordial. We had parted angrily on the last occasion;\nand there was an air of disdain about her, which she took no pains to\nconceal.\n\n\"I am told you wish to speak to me, Miss Dartle;\" said I, standing near\nher, with my hand upon the back of the seat, and declining her gesture\nof invitation to sit down.\n\n\"If you please,\" said she. \"Pray has this girl been found?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And yet she has run away!\"\n\nI saw her thin lips working while she looked at me, as if they were\neager to load her with reproaches.\n\n\"Run away?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes! From him,\" she said with a laugh. \"If she is not found, perhaps\nshe never will be found. She may be dead!\"\n\nThe vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance, I never saw expressed\nin any other face that ever I have seen.\n\n\"To wish her dead,\" said I, \"may be the kindest wish that one of her own\nsex could bestow upon her. I am glad that time has softened you so much,\nMiss Dartle.\"\n\nShe condescended to make no reply, but, turning on me with another\nscornful laugh, said:\n\n\"The friends of this excellent and much-injured young lady are friends\nof yours. You are their champion, and assert their rights. Do you wish\nto know what is known of her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\nShe rose with an ill-favored smile, and, taking a few steps towards\na wall of holly that was near at hand, dividing the lawn from a\nkitchen-garden, said, in a louder voice, \"Come here!\"--as if she were\ncalling to some unclean beast.\n\n\"You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this\nplace, of course, Mr. Copperfield?\" said she, looking over her shoulder\nat me with the same expression.\n\nI inclined my head, without knowing what she meant; and she said, \"Come\nhere!\" again; and returned, followed by the respectable Mr. Littimer,\nwho, with undiminished respectability, made me a bow, and took up his\nposition behind her. The air of wicked grace: of triumph, in which,\nstrange to say, there was yet something feminine and alluring: with\nwhich she reclined upon the seat between us, and looked at me, was\nworthy of a cruel Princess in a Legend.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, imperiously, without glancing at him, and touching the\nold wound as it throbbed: perhaps, in this instance, with pleasure\nrather than pain. \"Tell Mr. Copperfield about the flight.\"\n\n\"Mr. James and myself, ma'am----\"\n\n\"Don't address yourself to me!\" she interrupted, with a frown.\n\n\"Mr. James and myself, sir----\"\n\n\"Nor to me, if you please,\" said I.\n\nMr. Littimer, without being at all discomposed, signified by a slight\nobeisance, that anything that was most agreeable to us was most\nagreeable to him; and began again:\n\n\"Mr. James and myself have been abroad with the young woman, ever since\nshe left Yarmouth under Mr. James's protection. We have been in a\nvariety of places, and seen a deal of foreign country. We have been in\nFrance, Switzerland, Italy, in fact, almost all parts.\"\n\nHe looked at the back of the seat, as if he were addressing himself to\nthat; and softly played upon it with his hands, as if he were striking\nchords upon a dumb piano.\n\n\"Mr. James took quite uncommonly to the young woman; and was more\nsettled, for a length of time, than I have known him to be since I have\nbeen in his service. The young woman was very improvable, and spoke the\nlanguages; and wouldn't have been known for the same country-person. I\nnoticed that she was much admired wherever we went.\"\n\nMiss Dartle put her hand upon her side. I saw him steal a glance at her,\nand slightly smile to himself.\n\n\"Very much admired, indeed, the young woman was. What with her dress;\nwhat with the air and sun; what with being made so much of; what with\nthis, that, and the other; her merits really attracted general notice.\"\n\nHe made a short pause. Her eyes wandered restlessly over the distant\nprospect, and she bit her nether lip to stop that busy mouth.\n\nTaking his hands from the seat, and placing one of them within the\nother, as he settled himself on one leg, Mr. Littimer proceeded, with\nhis eyes cast down, and his respectable head a little advanced, and a\nlittle on one side:\n\n\"The young woman went on in this manner for some time, being\noccasionally low in her spirits, until I think she began to weary Mr.\nJames by giving way to her low spirits and tempers of that kind; and\nthings were not so comfortable. Mr. James he began to be restless again.\nThe more restless he got, the worse she got; and I must say, for myself,\nthat I had a very difficult time of it indeed between the two. Still\nmatters were patched up here, and made good there, over and over again;\nand altogether lasted, I am sure, for a longer time than anybody could\nhave expected.\"\n\nRecalling her eyes from the distance, she looked at me again now, with\nher former air. Mr. Littimer, clearing his throat behind his hand with a\nrespectable short-cough, changed legs, and went on:\n\n\"At last, when there had been, upon the whole, a good many words and\nreproaches, Mr. James he set off one morning, from the neighbourhood of\nNaples, where we had a villa (the young woman being very partial to the\nsea), and, under pretence of coming back in a day or so, left it in\ncharge with me to break it out, that, for the general happiness of all\nconcerned, he was\"--here an interruption of the short cough--\"gone. But\nMr. James, I must say, certainly did behave extremely honorable; for he\nproposed that the young woman should marry a very respectable person,\nwho was fully prepared to overlook the past, and who was, at least, as\ngood as anybody the young woman could have aspired to in a regular way:\nher connexions being very common.\"\n\nHe changed legs again, and wetted his lips. I was convinced that the\nscoundrel spoke of himself, and I saw my conviction reflected in Miss\nDartle's face.\n\n\"This I also had it in charge to communicate. I was willing to do\nanything to relieve Mr. James from his difficulty, and to restore\nharmony between himself and an affectionate parent, who has undergone so\nmuch on his account. Therefore I undertook the commission. The young\nwoman's violence when she came to, after I broke the fact of his\ndeparture, was beyond all expectations. She was quite mad, and had to be\nheld by force; or, if she couldn't have got to a knife, or got to the\nsea, she'd have beaten her head against the marble floor.\"\n\nMiss Dartle, leaning back upon the seat, with a light of exultation in\nher face, seemed almost to caress the sounds this fellow had uttered.\n\n\"But when I came to the second part of what had been entrusted to me,\"\nsaid Mr. Littimer, rubbing his hands, uneasily, \"which anybody might\nhave supposed would have been, at all events, appreciated as a kind\nintention, then the young woman came out in her true colors. A more\noutrageous person I never did see. Her conduct was surprisingly bad. She\nhad no more gratitude, no more feeling, no more patience, no more reason\nin her, than a stock or a stone. If I hadn't been upon my guard, I am\nconvinced she would have had my blood.\"\n\n\"I think the better of her for it,\" said I, indignantly.\n\nMr. Littimer bent his head, as much as to say, \"Indeed, sir? But you're\nyoung!\" and resumed his narrative.\n\n\"It was necessary, in short, for a time, to take away everything nigh\nher, that she could do herself, or anybody else, an injury with, and to\nshut her up close. Notwithstanding which, she got out in the night;\nforced the lattice of a window, that I had nailed up myself; dropped on\na vine that was trailed below; and never has been seen or heard of, to\nmy knowledge, since.\"\n\n\"She is dead, perhaps,\" said Miss Dartle, with a smile, as if she could\nhave spurned the body of the ruined girl.\n\n\"She may have drownded herself, miss,\" returned Mr. Littimer, catching\nat an excuse for addressing himself to somebody. \"It's very possible.\nOr, she may have had assistance from the boatmen, and the boatmen's\nwives and children. Being given to low company, she was very much in the\nhabit of talking to them on the beach, Miss Dartle, and sitting by their\nboats. I have known her do it, when Mr. James has been away, whole days.\nMr. James was far from pleased to find out, once, that she had told the\nchildren she was a boatman's daughter, and that in her own country, long\nago, she had roamed about the beach, like them.\"\n\nOh, Emily! Unhappy beauty! What a picture rose before me of her sitting\non the far-off shore, among the children like herself when she was\ninnocent, listening to little voices such as might have called her\nMother had she been a poor man's wife; and to the great voice of the\nsea, with its eternal \"Never more!\"\n\n\"When it was clear that nothing could be done, Miss Dartle--\"\n\n\"Did I tell you not to speak to me?\" she said, with stern contempt.\n\n\"You spoke to me, miss,\" he replied. \"I beg your pardon. But it's my\nservice to obey.\"\n\n\"Do your service,\" she returned. \"Finish your story, and go!\"\n\n\"When it was clear,\" he said, with infinite respectability, and an\nobedient bow, \"that she was not to be found, I went to Mr. James, at the\nplace where it had been agreed that I should write to him, and informed\nhim of what had occurred. Words passed between us in consequence, and I\nfelt it due to my character to leave him. I could bear, and I have\nborne, a great deal from Mr. James; but he insulted me too far. He hurt\nme. Knowing the unfortunate difference between himself and his mother,\nand what her anxiety of mind was likely to be, I took the liberty of\ncoming home to England, and relating--\"\n\n\"For money which I paid him,\" said Miss Dartle to me.\n\n\"Just so, ma'am--and relating what I knew. I am not aware,\" said Mr.\nLittimer, after a moment's reflection, \"that there is anything else. I\nam at present out of employment, and should be happy to meet with a\nrespectable situation.\"\n\nMiss Dartle glanced at me, as though she would inquire if there were\nanything that I desired to ask. As there was something which had\noccurred to my mind, I said in reply:\n\n\"I could wish to know from this--creature,\" I could not bring myself to\nutter any more conciliatory word, \"whether they intercepted a letter\nthat was written to her from home, or whether he supposes that she\nreceived it.\"\n\nHe remained calm and silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and the\ntip of every finger of his right hand delicately poised against the tip\nof every finger of his left.\n\nMiss Dartle turned her head disdainfully towards him.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, miss,\" he said, awakening from his abstraction,\n\"but, however submissive to you, I have my position, though a servant.\nMr. Copperfield and you, miss, are different people. If Mr. Copperfield\nwishes to know anything from me, I take the liberty of reminding Mr.\nCopperfield that he can put a question to me. I have a character to\nmaintain.\"\n\nAfter a momentary struggle with myself, I turned my eyes upon him, and\nsaid, \"You have heard my question. Consider it addressed to yourself, if\nyou choose. What answer do you make?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" he rejoined, with an occasional separation and reunion of those\ndelicate tips, \"my answer must be qualified; because, to betray Mr.\nJames's confidence to his mother, and to betray it to you, are two\ndifferent actions. It is not probable, I consider, that Mr. James would\nencourage the receipt of letters likely to increase low spirits and\nunpleasantness; but further than that, sir, I should wish to avoid\ngoing.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" enquired Miss Dartle of me.\n\nI indicated that I had nothing more to say. \"Except,\" I added, as I saw\nhim moving off, \"that I understand this fellow's part in the wicked\nstory, and that, as I shall make it known to the honest man who has been\nher father from her childhood, I would recommend him to avoid going too\nmuch into public.\"\n\nHe had stopped the moment I began, and had listened with his usual\nrepose of manner.\n\n\"Thank you, sir. But you'll excuse me if I say, sir, that there are\nneither slaves nor slave-drivers in this country, and that people are\nnot allowed to take the law into their own hands. If they do, it is more\nto their own peril, I believe, than to other people's. Consequently\nspeaking, I am not at all afraid of going wherever I may wish, sir.\"\n\nWith that, he made me a polite bow; and, with another to Miss Dartle,\nwent away through the arch in the wall of holly by which he had come.\nMiss Dartle and I regarded each other for a little while in silence; her\nmanner being exactly what it was, when she had produced the man.\n\n\"He says besides,\" she observed, with a slow curling of her lip, \"that\nhis master, as he hears, is coasting Spain; and this done, is away to\ngratify his seafaring tastes till he is weary. But that is of no\ninterest to you. Between these two proud persons, mother and son, there\nis a wider breach than before, and little hope of its healing, for they\nare one at heart, and time makes each more obstinate and imperious.\nNeither is this of any interest to you; but it introduces what I wish to\nsay. This devil whom you make an angel of, I mean this low girl whom he\npicked out of the tide-mud,\" with her black eyes full upon me, and her\npassionate finger up, \"may be alive,--for I believe some common things\nare hard to die. If she is, you will desire to have a pearl of such\nprice found and taken care of. We desire that, too; that he may not by\nany chance be made her prey again. So far, we are united in one\ninterest; and that is why I, who would do her any mischief that so\ncoarse a wretch is capable of feeling, have sent for you to hear what\nyou have heard.\"\n\nI saw, by the change in her face, that some one was advancing behind me.\nIt was Mrs. Steerforth, who gave me her hand more coldly than of yore,\nand with an augmentation of her former stateliness of manner; but still,\nI perceived--and I was touched by it--with an ineffaceable remembrance\nof my old love for her son. She was greatly altered. Her fine figure was\nfar less upright, her handsome face was deeply marked, and her hair was\nalmost white. But when she sat down on the seat, she was a handsome lady\nstill; and well I knew the bright eye with its lofty look, that had been\na light in my very dreams at school.\n\n\"Is Mr. Copperfield informed of everything, Rosa?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And has he heard Littimer himself?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have told him why you wished it.\"\n\n\"You are a good girl. I have had some slight correspondence with your\nformer friend, sir,\" addressing me, \"but it has not restored his sense\nof duty or natural obligation. Therefore I have no other object in this,\nthan what Rosa has mentioned. If, by the course which may relieve the\nmind of the decent man you brought here (for whom I am sorry--I can say\nno more), my son may be saved from again falling into the snares of a\ndesigning enemy, well!\"\n\nShe drew herself up, and sat looking straight before her, far away.\n\n\"Madam,\" I said respectfully, \"I understand. I assure you I am in no\ndanger of putting any strained construction on your motives. But I must\nsay, even to you, having known this injured family from childhood, that\nif you suppose the girl, so deeply wronged, has not been cruelly\ndeluded, and would not rather die a hundred deaths than take a cup of\nwater from your son's hand now, you cherish a terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"Well, Rosa, well!\" said Mrs. Steerforth, as the other was about to\ninterpose, \"it is no matter. Let it be. You are married, sir, I am\ntold?\"\n\nI answered that I had been some time married.\n\n\"And are doing well? I hear little in the quiet life I lead, but I\nunderstand you are beginning to be famous.\"\n\n\"I have been very fortunate,\" I said, \"and find my name connected with\nsome praise.\"\n\n\"You have no mother?\"--in a softened voice.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It is a pity,\" she returned. \"She would have been proud of you. Good\nnight!\"\n\nI took the hand she held out with a dignified, unbending air, and it was\nas calm in mine as if her breast had been at peace. Her pride could\nstill its very pulses it appeared, and draw the placid veil before her\nface, through which she sat looking straight before her on the far\ndistance.\n\nAs I moved away from them along the terrace, I could not help observing\nhow steadily they both sat gazing on the prospect, and how it thickened\nand closed around them. Here and there, some early lamps were seen to\ntwinkle in the distant city; and in the eastern quarter of the sky the\nlurid light still hovered. But, from the greater part of the broad\nvalley interposed, a mist was rising like a sea, which, mingling with\nthe darkness, made it seem as if the gathering waters would encompass\nthem. I have reason to remember this, and think of it with awe; for\nbefore I looked upon those two again, a stormy sea had risen to their\nfeet.\n\nReflecting on what had been thus told me, I felt it right that it should\nbe communicated to Mr. Peggotty. On the following evening I went into\nLondon in quest of him. He was always wandering about from place to\nplace, with his one object of recovering his niece before him; but was\nmore in London than elsewhere. Often and often, now, had I seen him in\nthe dead of night passing along the streets, searching, among the few\nwho loitered out of doors at those untimely hours, for what he dreaded\nto find.\n\nHe kept a lodging over the little chandler's shop in Hungerford Market,\nwhich I have had occasion to mention more than once, and from which he\nfirst went forth upon his errand of mercy. Hither I directed my walk. On\nmaking inquiry for him, I learned from the people of the house that he\nhad not gone out yet, and I should find him in his room up-stairs.\n\nHe was sitting reading by a window in which he kept a few plants. The\nroom was very neat and orderly. I saw in a moment that it was always\nkept prepared for her reception, and that he never went out but he\nthought it possible he might bring her home. He had not heard my tap at\nthe door, and only raised his eyes when I laid my hand upon his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Mas'r Davy! Thankee, sir! thankee hearty, for this visit! Sit ye down.\nYou're kindly welcome, sir!\"\n\n\"Mr. Peggotty,\" said I, taking the chair he handed me, \"don't expect\nmuch! I have heard some news.\"\n\n\"Of Em'ly!\"\n\nHe put his hand, in a nervous manner, on his mouth, and turned pale, as\nhe fixed his eyes on mine.\n\n\"It gives no clue to where she is; but she is not with him.\"\n\nHe sat down, looking intently at me, and listened in profound silence to\nall I had to tell. I well remember the sense of dignity, beauty even,\nwith which the patient gravity of his face impressed me, when, having\ngradually removed his eyes from mine, he sat looking downward, leaning\nhis forehead on his hand. He offered no interruption, but remained\nthroughout perfectly still. He seemed to pursue her figure through the\nnarrative, and to let every other shape go by him, as if it were\nnothing.\n\nWhen I had done, he shaded his face, and continued silent. I looked out\nof the window for a little while, and occupied myself with the plants.\n\n\"How do you fare to feel about it, Mas'r Davy?\" he inquired at length.\n\n\"I think that she is living,\" I replied.\n\n\"I doen't know. Maybe the first shock was too rough, and in the wildness\nof her art----! That there blue water as she used to speak on. Could she\nhave thowt o' that so many year, because it was to be her grave!\"\n\nHe said this, musing, in a low, frightened voice; and walked across the\nlittle room.\n\n\"And yet,\" he added, \"Mas'r Davy, I have felt so sure as she was\nliving--I have know'd, awake and sleeping, as it was so trew that I\nshould find her--I have been so led on by it, and held up by it--that I\ndoen't believe I can have been deceived. No! Em'ly's alive!\"\n\nHe put his hand down firmly on the table, and set his sunburnt face into\na resolute expression.\n\n\"My niece, Em'ly, is alive, sir!\" he said, stedfastly. \"I doen't know\nwheer it comes from, or how 'tis, but _I am told_ as she's alive!\"\n\nHe looked almost like a man inspired, as he said it. I waited for a few\nmoments, until he could give me his undivided attention; and then\nproceeded to explain the precaution, that, it had occurred to me last\nnight, it would be wise to take.\n\n\"Now, my dear friend--\" I began.\n\n\"Thankee, thankee, kind sir,\" he said, grasping my hand in both of his.\n\n\"If she should make her way to London, which is likely--for where could\nshe lose herself so readily as in this vast city; and what would she\nwish to do, but lose and hide herself, if she does not go home?--\"\n\n\"And she won't go home,\" he interposed, shaking his head mournfully. \"If\nshe had left of her own accord, she might; not as 'twas, sir.\"\n\n\"If she should come here,\" said I, \"I believe there is one person,\nhere, more likely to discover her than any other in the world. Do\nyou remember--hear what I say, with fortitude--think of your great\nobject!--do you remember Martha?\"\n\n\"Of our town?\"\n\nI needed no other answer than his face.\n\n\"Do you know that she is in London?\"\n\n\"I have seen her in the streets,\" he answered, with a shiver.\n\n\"But you don't know,\" said I, \"that Emily was charitable to her, with\nHam's help, long before she fled from home. Nor, that, when we met one\nnight, and spoke together in the room yonder, over the way, she listened\nat the door.\"\n\n\"Mas'r Davy?\" he replied in astonishment. \"That night when it snew so\nhard?\"\n\n\"That night. I have never seen her since. I went back, after parting\nfrom you, to speak to her, but she was gone. I was unwilling to mention\nher to you then, and I am now; but she is the person of whom I speak,\nand with whom I think we should communicate. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Too well, sir,\" he replied. We had sunk our voices, almost to a\nwhisper, and continued to speak in that tone.\n\n\"You say you have seen her. Do you think that you could find her? I\ncould only hope to do so by chance.\"\n\n\"I think, Mas'r Davy, I know wheer to look.\"\n\n\"It is dark. Being together, shall we go out now, and try to find her\nto-night?\"\n\nHe assented, and prepared to accompany me. Without appearing to observe\nwhat he was doing, I saw how carefully he adjusted the little room, put\na candle ready and the means of lighting it, arranged the bed, and\nfinally took out of a drawer one of her dresses (I remembered to have\nseen her wear it), neatly folded with some other garments, and a bonnet,\nwhich he placed upon a chair. He made no allusion to these clothes,\nneither did I. There they had been waiting for her, many and many a\nnight, no doubt.\n\n\"The time was, Mas'r Davy,\" he said, as we came down stairs, \"when I\nthowt this girl, Martha, a'most like the dirt underneath my Em'ly's\nfeet. God forgive me, there's a difference now!\"\n\nAs we went along, partly to hold him in conversation, and partly to\nsatisfy myself, I asked him about Ham. He said, almost in the same words\nas formerly, that Ham was just the same, \"wearing away his life with\nkiender no care nohow for't; but never murmuring, and liked by all.\"\n\nI asked him what he thought Ham's state of mind was, in reference to the\ncause of their misfortunes? Whether he believed it was dangerous? What\nhe supposed, for example, Ham would do, if he and Steerforth ever should\nencounter?\n\n\"I doen't know, sir,\" he replied. \"I have thowt of it oftentimes, but I\ncan't arrize myself of it, no matters.\"\n\nI recalled to his remembrance the morning after her departure, when we\nwere all three on the beach. \"Do you recollect,\" said I, \"a certain wild\nway in which he looked out to sea, and spoke about 'the end of it.'\"\n\n\"Sure I do!\" said he.\n\n\"What do you suppose he meant?\"\n\n\"Mas'r Davy,\" he replied, \"I've put the question to myself a mort o'\ntimes, and never found no answer. And theer's one curous thing--that,\nthough he is so pleasant, I wouldn't fare to feel comfortable to try and\nget his mind upon 't. He never said a wured to me as warn't as dootiful\nas dootiful could be, and it ain't likely as he'd begin to speak any\nother ways now; but it's fur from being fleet water in his mind, where\nthem thowts lays. It's deep, sir, and I can't see down.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said I, \"and that has sometimes made me anxious.\"\n\n\"And me too, Mas'r Davy,\" he rejoined. \"Even more so, I do assure you,\nthan his ventersome ways, though both belongs to the alteration in him.\nI doen't know as he'd do violence under any circumstarnces, but I hope\nas them two may be kep asunders.\"\n\nWe had come, through Temple Bar, into the city. Conversing no more now,\nand walking at my side, he yielded himself up to the one aim of his\ndevoted life, and went on, with that hushed concentration of his\nfaculties which would have made his figure solitary in a multitude. We\nwere not far from Blackfriars Bridge, when he turned his head and\npointed to a solitary female figure flitting along the opposite side of\nthe street. I knew it, readily, to be the figure that we sought.\n\nWe crossed the road, and were pressing on towards her, when it occurred\nto me that she might be more disposed to feel a woman's interest in the\nlost girl, if we spoke to her in a quieter place, aloof from the crowd,\nand where we should be less observed. I advised my companion, therefore,\nthat we should not address her yet, but follow her; consulting in this,\nlikewise, an indistinct desire I had, to know where she went.\n\nHe acquiescing, we followed at a distance: never losing sight of her,\nbut never caring to come very near, as she frequently looked about.\nOnce, she stopped to listen to a band of music; and then we stopped too.\n\nShe went on a long way. Still we went on. It was evident, from the\nmanner in which she held her course, that she was going to some fixed\ndestination; and this, and her keeping in the busy streets, and, I\nsuppose the strange fascination in the secresy and mystery of so\nfollowing any one, made me adhere to my first purpose. At length she\nturned into a dull, dark street, where the noise and crowd were lost;\nand I said, \"We may speak to her now;\" and, mending our pace, we went\nafter her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nMARTHA.\n\n\nWe were now down in Westminster. We had turned back to follow her,\nhaving encountered her coming towards us; and Westminster Abbey was the\npoint at which she passed from the lights and noise of the leading\nstreets. She proceeded so quickly, when she got free of the two currents\nof passengers setting towards and from the bridge, that, between this\nand the advance she had of us when she struck off, we were in the narrow\nwater-side street by Millbank before we came up with her. At that moment\nshe crossed the road, as if to avoid the footsteps that she heard so\nclose behind; and, without looking back, passed on even more rapidly.\n\nA glimpse of the river through a dull gateway, where some waggons were\nhoused for the night, seemed to arrest my feet. I touched my companion\nwithout speaking, and we both forbore to cross after her, and both\nfollowed on that opposite side of the way; keeping as quietly as we\ncould in the shadow of the houses, but keeping very near her.\n\nThere was, and is when I write, at the end of that low-lying street,\na dilapidated little wooden building, probably an obsolete old\nferry-house. Its position is just at that point where the street\nceases, and the road begins to lie between a row of houses and the\nriver. As soon as she came here, and saw the water, she stopped as if\nshe had come to her destination; and presently went slowly along by the\nbrink of the river, looking intently at it.\n\nAll the way here, I had supposed that she was going to some house;\nindeed, I had vaguely entertained the hope that the house might be in\nsome way associated with the lost girl. But, that one dark glimpse of\nthe river, through the gateway, had instinctively prepared me for her\ngoing no farther.\n\nThe neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time; as oppressive, sad, and\nsolitary by night, as any about London. There were neither wharves nor\nhouses on the melancholy waste of road near the great blank Prison. A\nsluggish ditch deposited its mud at the prison walls. Coarse grass and\nrank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity. In one\npart, carcases of houses, inauspiciously begun and never finished,\nrotted away. In another, the ground was cumbered with rusty iron\nmonsters of steam-boilers, wheels, cranks, pipes, furnaces, paddles,\nanchors, diving-bells, windmill-sails, and I know not what strange\nobjects, accumulated by some speculator, and grovelling in the dust,\nunderneath which--having sunk into the soil of their own weight in wet\nweather--they had the appearance of vainly trying to hide themselves.\nThe clash and glare of sundry fiery Works upon the river side, arose by\nnight to disturb everything except the heavy and unbroken smoke that\npoured out of their chimneys. Slimy gaps and causeways, winding among\nold wooden piles, with a sickly substance clinging to the latter, like\ngreen hair, and the rags of last year's handbills offering rewards for\ndrowned men fluttering above high-water mark, led down through the ooze\nand slush to the ebb tide. There was a story that one of the pits dug\nfor the dead in the time of the Great Plague was hereabout; and a\nblighting influence seemed to have proceeded from it over the whole\nplace. Or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into that\nnightmare condition, out of the overflowings of the polluted stream.\n\nAs if she were a part of the refuse it had cast out, and left to\ncorruption and decay, the girl we had followed strayed down to the\nriver's brink, and stood in the midst of this night-picture, lonely\nand still, looking at the water.\n\n  [Illustration: The River.]\n\nThere were some boats and barges astrand in the mud, and these enabled\nus to come within a few yards of her without being seen. I then signed\nto Mr. Peggotty to remain where he was, and emerged from their shade to\nspeak to her. I did not approach her solitary figure without trembling;\nfor this gloomy end to her determined walk, and the way in which she\nstood, almost within the cavernous shadow of the iron bridge, looking at\nthe lights crookedly reflected in the strong tide, inspired a dread\nwithin me.\n\nI think she was talking to herself. I am sure, although absorbed in\ngazing at the water, that her shawl was off her shoulders, and that she\nwas muffling her hands in it, in an unsettled and bewildered way, more\nlike the action of a sleep-walker than a waking person. I know, and\nnever can forget, that there was that in her wild manner which gave me\nno assurance but that she would sink before my eyes, until I had her arm\nwithin my grasp.\n\nAt the same moment I said \"Martha!\"\n\nShe uttered a terrified scream, and struggled with me with such strength\nthat I doubt if I could have held her alone. But a stronger hand than\nmine was laid upon her; and when she raised her frightened eyes and saw\nwhose it was, she made but one more effort, and dropped down between us.\nWe carried her away from the water to where there were some dry stones,\nand there laid her down, crying and moaning. In a little while she sat\namong the stones, holding her wretched head with both her hands.\n\n\"Oh, the river!\" she cried passionately. \"Oh, the river!\"\n\n\"Hush, hush!\" said I. \"Calm yourself.\"\n\nBut she still repeated the same words, continually exclaiming, \"Oh, the\nriver!\" over and over again.\n\n\"I know it's like me!\" she exclaimed. \"I know that I belong to it. I\nknow that it's the natural company of such as I am! It comes from\ncountry places, where there was once no harm in it--and it creeps\nthrough the dismal streets, defiled and miserable--and it goes away,\nlike my life, to a great sea, that is always troubled--and I feel that I\nmust go with it!\"\n\nI have never known what despair was, except in the tone of those words.\n\n\"I can't keep away from it. I can't forget it. It haunts me day and\nnight. It's the only thing in all the world that I am fit for, or that's\nfit for me. Oh, the dreadful river!\"\n\nThe thought passed through my mind that in the face of my companion, as\nhe looked upon her without speech or motion, I might have read his\nniece's history, if I had known nothing of it. I never saw, in any\npainting or reality, horror and compassion so impressively blended. He\nshook as if he would have fallen; and his hand--I touched it with my\nown, for his appearance alarmed me--was deadly cold.\n\n\"She is in a state of frenzy,\" I whispered to him. \"She will speak\ndifferently in a little time.\"\n\nI don't know what he would have said in answer. He made some motion with\nhis mouth, and seemed to think he had spoken; but he had only pointed to\nher with his outstretched hand.\n\nA new burst of crying came upon her now, in which she once more hid her\nface among the stones, and lay before us, a prostrate image of\nhumiliation and ruin. Knowing that this state must pass, before we could\nspeak to her with any hope, I ventured to restrain him when he would\nhave raised her, and we stood by in silence until she became more\ntranquil.\n\n\"Martha,\" said I then, leaning down, and helping her to rise--she seemed\nto want to rise as if with the intention of going away, but she was\nweak, and leaned against a boat. \"Do you know who this is, who is with\nme?\"\n\nShe said faintly, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know that we have followed you a long way to-night?\"\n\nShe shook her head. She looked neither at him nor at me, but stood in a\nhumbled attitude, holding her bonnet and shawl in one hand, without\nappearing conscious of them, and pressing the other, clenched, against\nher forehead.\n\n\"Are you composed enough,\" said I, \"to speak on the subject which so\ninterested you--I hope Heaven may remember it!--that snowy night?\"\n\nHer sobs broke out afresh, and she murmured some inarticulate thanks to\nme for not having driven her away from the door.\n\n\"I want to say nothing for myself,\" she said, after a few moments. \"I am\nbad, I am lost. I have no hope at all. But tell him, sir,\" she had\nshrunk away from him, \"if you don't feel too hard to me to do it, that I\nnever was in any way the cause of his misfortune.\"\n\n\"It has never been attributed to you,\" I returned, earnestly responding\nto her earnestness.\n\n\"It was you, if I don't deceive myself,\" she said, in a broken voice,\n\"that came into the kitchen, the night she took such pity on me; was so\ngentle to me; didn't shrink away from me like all the rest, and gave me\nsuch kind help! Was it you, sir?\"\n\n\"It was,\" said I.\n\n\"I should have been in the river long ago,\" she said, glancing at it\nwith a terrible expression, \"if any wrong to her had been upon my mind.\nI never could have kept out of it a single winter's night, if I had not\nbeen free of any share in that!\"\n\n\"The cause of her flight is too well understood,\" I said. \"You are\ninnocent of any part in it, we thoroughly believe,--we know.\"\n\n\"Oh I might have been much the better for her, if I had had a better\nheart!\" exclaimed the girl, with most forlorn regret; \"for she was\nalways good to me! She never spoke a word to me but what was pleasant\nand right. Is it likely I would try to make her what I am myself,\nknowing what I am myself, so well! When I lost everything that makes\nlife dear, the worst of all my thoughts was that I was parted for ever\nfrom her!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty, standing with one hand on the gunwale of the boat, and his\neyes cast down, put his disengaged hand before his face.\n\n\"And when I heard what had happened before that snowy night, from some\nbelonging to our town,\" cried Martha, \"the bitterest thought in all my\nmind was, that the people would remember she once kept company with me,\nand would say I had corrupted her! When, Heaven knows, I would have died\nto have brought back her good name!\"\n\nLong unused to any self-control, the piercing agony of her remorse and\ngrief was terrible.\n\n\"To have died, would not have been much--what can I say?--I would have\nlived!\" she cried. \"I would have lived to be old, in the wretched\nstreets--and to wander about, avoided, in the dark--and to see the day\nbreak on the ghastly lines of houses, and remember how the same sun used\nto shine into my room, and wake me once--I would have done even that, to\nsave her!\"\n\nSinking on the stones, she took some in each hand, and clenched them up,\nas if she would have ground them. She writhed into some new posture\nconstantly: stiffening her arms, twisting them before her face, as\nthough to shut out from her eyes the little light there was, and\ndrooping her head, as if it were heavy with insupportable recollections.\n\n\"What shall I ever do!\" she said, fighting thus with her despair. \"How\ncan I go on as I am, a solitary curse to myself, a living disgrace to\nevery one I come near!\" Suddenly she turned to my companion. \"Stamp\nupon me, kill me! When she was your pride, you would have thought I had\ndone her harm if I had brushed against her in the street. You can't\nbelieve--why should you?--a syllable that comes out of my lips. It\nwould be a burning shame upon you, even now, if she and I exchanged a\nword. I don't complain. I don't say she and I are alike--I know there\nis a long, long way between us. I only say, with all my guilt and\nwretchedness upon my head, that I am grateful to her from my soul, and\nlove her. Oh don't think that all the power I had of loving anything,\nis quite worn out! Throw me away, as all the world does. Kill me for\nbeing what I am, and having ever known her; but don't think that of me!\"\n\nHe looked upon her, while she made this supplication, in a wild\ndistracted manner; and, when she was silent, gently raised her.\n\n\"Martha,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"God forbid as I should judge you. Forbid\nas I, of all men, should do that, my girl! You doen't know half the\nchange that's come, in course of time, upon me, when you think it\nlikely. Well!\" he paused a moment, then went on. \"You doen't understand\nhow 'tis that this here gentleman and me has wished to speak to you. You\ndoen't understand what 'tis we has afore us. Listen now!\"\n\nHis influence upon her was complete. She stood, shrinkingly, before him,\nas if she were afraid to meet his eyes; but her passionate sorrow was\nquite hushed and mute.\n\n\"If you heerd,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"owt of what passed between Mas'r\nDavy and me, th' night when it snew so hard, you know as I have\nbeen--wheer not--fur to seek my dear niece. My dear niece,\" he repeated\nsteadily. \"Fur she's more dear to me now, Martha, than ever she was\ndear afore.\"\n\nShe put her hands before her face; but otherwise remained quiet.\n\n\"I have heerd her tell,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"as you was early left\nfatherless and motherless, with no friend fur to take, in a rough\nseafaring-way, their place. Maybe you can guess that if you'd had such a\nfriend, you'd have got into a way of being fond of him in course of\ntime, and that my niece was kiender daughter-like to me.\"\n\nAs she was silently trembling, he put her shawl carefully about her,\ntaking it up from the ground for that purpose.\n\n\"Whereby,\" said he, \"I know, both as she would go to the wureld's\nfurdest end with me, if she could once see me again; and that she would\nfly to the wureld's furdest end to keep off seeing me. For though she\nain't no call to doubt my love, and doen't--and doen't,\" he repeated,\nwith a quiet assurance of the truth of what he said, \"there's shame\nsteps in, and keeps betwixt us.\"\n\nI read, in every word of his plain impressive way of delivering himself,\nnew evidence of his having thought of this one topic, in every feature\nit presented.\n\n\"According to our reckoning,\" he proceeded, \"Mas'r Davy's here, and\nmine, she is like, one day, to make her own poor solitary course to\nLondon. We believe--Mas'r Davy, me, and all of us--that you are as\ninnocent of everything that has befel her, as the unborn child. You've\nspoke of her being pleasant, kind, and gentle to you. Bless her, I knew\nshe was! I knew she always was, to all. You're thankful to her, and you\nlove her. Help us all you can to find her, and may Heaven reward you!\"\n\nShe looked at him hastily, and for the first time, as if she were\ndoubtful of what he had said.\n\n\"Will you trust me?\" she asked, in a low voice of astonishment.\n\n\"Full and free!\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"To speak to her, if I should ever find her; shelter her, if I have any\nshelter to divide with her; and then, without her knowledge, come to\nyou, and bring you to her?\" she asked hurriedly.\n\nWe both replied together, \"Yes!\"\n\nShe lifted up her eyes, and solemnly declared that she would devote\nherself to this task, fervently and faithfully. That she would never\nwaver in it, never be diverted from it, never relinquish it, while there\nwas any chance of hope. If she were not true to it, might the object she\nnow had in life, which bound her to something devoid of evil, in its\npassing away from her, leave her more forlorn and more despairing, if\nthat were possible, than she had been upon the river's brink that night;\nand then might all help, human and Divine, renounce her evermore!\n\nShe did not raise her voice above her breath, or address us, but said\nthis to the night sky; then stood profoundly quiet, looking at the\ngloomy water.\n\nWe judged it expedient, now, to tell her all we knew; which I recounted\nat length. She listened with great attention, and with a face that often\nchanged, but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions. Her\neyes occasionally filled with tears, but those she repressed. It seemed\nas if her spirit were quite altered, and she could not be too quiet.\n\nShe asked, when all was told, where we were to be communicated with, if\noccasion should arise. Under a dull lamp in the road, I wrote our two\naddresses on a leaf of my pocket-book, which I tore out and gave to her,\nand which she put in her poor bosom. I asked her where she lived\nherself. She said, after a pause, in no place long. It were better not\nto know.\n\nMr. Peggotty suggesting to me, in a whisper, what had already occurred\nto myself, I took out my purse; but I could not prevail upon her to\naccept any money, nor could I exact any promise from her that she would\ndo so at another time. I represented to her that Mr. Peggotty could not\nbe called, for one in his condition, poor; and that the idea of her\nengaging in this search, while depending on her own resources, shocked\nus both. She continued steadfast. In this particular, his influence upon\nher was equally powerless with mine. She gratefully thanked him, but\nremained inexorable.\n\n\"There may be work to be got,\" she said. \"I'll try.\"\n\n\"At least take some assistance,\" I returned, \"until you have tried.\"\n\n\"I could not do what I have promised, for money,\" she replied. \"I could\nnot take it, if I was starving. To give me money would be to take away\nyour trust, to take away the object that you have given me, to take away\nthe only certain thing that saves me from the river.\"\n\n\"In the name of the great Judge,\" said I, \"before whom you and all of us\nmust stand at his dread time, dismiss that terrible idea! We can all do\nsome good, if we will.\"\n\nShe trembled, and her lip shook, and her face was paler, as she\nanswered:\n\n\"It has been put in your hearts, perhaps, to save a wretched creature\nfor repentance. I am afraid to think so; it seems too bold. If any good\nshould come of me, I might begin to hope; for nothing but harm has ever\ncome of my deeds yet. I am to be trusted, for the first time in a long\nwhile, with my miserable life, on account of what you have given me to\ntry for. I know no more, and I can say no more.\"\n\nAgain she repressed the tears that had begun to flow; and, putting out\nher trembling hand, and touching Mr. Peggotty, as if there were some\nhealing virtue in him, went away along the desolate road. She had been\nill, probably for a long time. I observed, upon that closer opportunity\nof observation, that she was worn and haggard, and that her sunken eyes\nexpressed privation and endurance.\n\nWe followed her at a short distance, our way lying in the same\ndirection, until we came back into the lighted and populous streets. I\nhad such implicit confidence in her declaration, that I then put it to\nMr. Peggotty, whether it would not seem, in the onset, like distrusting\nher, to follow her any further. He being of the same mind, and equally\nreliant on her, we suffered her to take her own road, and took ours,\nwhich was towards Highgate. He accompanied me a good part of the way;\nand when we parted, with a prayer for the success of this fresh effort,\nthere was a new and thoughtful compassion in him that I was at no loss\nto interpret.\n\nIt was midnight when I arrived at home. I had reached my own gate, and\nwas standing listening for the deep bell of Saint Paul's, the sound of\nwhich I thought had been borne towards me among the multitude of\nstriking clocks, when I was rather surprised to see that the door of my\naunt's cottage was open, and that a faint light in the entry was shining\nout across the road.\n\nThinking that my aunt might have relapsed into one of her old alarms,\nand might be watching the progress of some imaginary conflagration in\nthe distance, I went to speak to her. It was with very great surprise\nthat I saw a man standing in her little garden.\n\nHe had a glass and bottle in his hand, and was in the act of drinking. I\nstopped short, among the thick foliage outside, for the moon was up now,\nthough obscured; and I recognised the man whom I had once supposed to be\na delusion of Mr. Dick's, and had once encountered with my aunt in the\nstreets of the city.\n\nHe was eating as well as drinking, and seemed to eat with a hungry\nappetite. He seemed curious regarding the cottage, too, as if it were\nthe first time he had seen it. After stooping to put the bottle on the\nground, he looked up at the windows, and looked about; though with a\ncovert and impatient air, as if he was anxious to be gone.\n\nThe light in the passage was obscured for a moment, and my aunt came\nout. She was agitated, and told some money into his hand. I heard it\nchink.\n\n\"What's the use of this?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I can spare no more,\" returned my aunt.\n\n\"Then I can't go,\" said he. \"Here! You may take it back!\"\n\n\"You bad man,\" returned my aunt, with great emotion; \"how can you use me\nso? But why do I ask? It is because you know how weak I am! What have I\nto do, to free myself for ever of your visits, but to abandon you to\nyour deserts?\"\n\n\"And why don't you abandon me to my deserts?\" said he.\n\n\"_You_ ask me why!\" returned my aunt. \"What a heart you must have!\"\n\nHe stood moodily rattling the money, and shaking his head, until at\nlength he said:\n\n\"Is this all you mean to give me, then?\"\n\n\"It is all I _can_ give you,\" said my aunt. \"You know I have had losses,\nand am poorer than I used to be. I have told you so. Having got it, why\ndo you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment, and seeing\nwhat you have become?\"\n\n\"I have become shabby enough, if you mean that,\" he said. \"I lead the\nlife of an owl.\"\n\n\"You stripped me of the greater part of all I ever had,\" said my aunt.\n\"You closed my heart against the whole world, years and years. You\ntreated me falsely, ungratefully, and cruelly. Go, and repent of it.\nDon't add new injuries to the long, long list of injuries you have done\nme!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" he returned. \"It's all very fine!--Well! I must do the best I\ncan, for the present, I suppose.\"\n\nIn spite of himself, he appeared abashed by my aunt's indignant tears,\nand came slouching out of the garden. Taking two or three quick steps,\nas if I had just come up, I met him at the gate, and went in as he came\nout. We eyed one another narrowly in passing, and with no favour.\n\n\"Aunt,\" said I, hurriedly. \"This man alarming you again! Let me speak to\nhim. Who is he?\"\n\n\"Child,\" returned my aunt, taking my arm, \"come in, and don't speak to\nme for ten minutes.\"\n\nWe sat down in her little parlor. My aunt retired behind the round green\nfan of former days, which was screwed on the back of a chair, and\noccasionally wiped her eyes, for about a quarter of an hour. Then she\ncame out, and took a seat beside me.\n\n\"Trot,\" said my aunt, calmly, \"it's my husband.\"\n\n\"Your husband, aunt? I thought he had been dead!\"\n\n\"Dead to me,\" returned my aunt, \"but living.\"\n\nI sat in silent amazement.\n\n\"Betsey Trotwood don't look a likely subject for the tender passion,\"\nsaid my aunt, composedly, \"but the time was, Trot, when she believed in\nthat man most entirely. When she loved him, Trot, right well. When there\nwas no proof of attachment and affection that she would not have given\nhim. He repaid her by breaking her fortune, and nearly breaking her\nheart. So she put all that sort of sentiment, once and for ever in a\ngrave, and filled it up, and flattened it down.\"\n\n\"My dear, good aunt!\"\n\n\"I left him,\" my aunt proceeded, laying her hand as usual on the back of\nmine, \"generously. I may say at this distance of time, Trot, that I left\nhim generously. He had been so cruel to me, that I might have effected a\nseparation on easy terms for myself; but I did not. He soon made ducks\nand drakes of what I gave him, sank lower and lower, married another\nwoman, I believe, became an adventurer, a gambler, and a cheat. What he\nis now, you see. But he was a fine-looking man when I married him,\" said\nmy aunt, with an echo of her old pride and admiration in her tone; \"and\nI believed him--I was a fool!--to be the soul of honor!\"\n\nShe gave my hand a squeeze, and shook her head.\n\n\"He is nothing to me now, Trot,--less than nothing. But, sooner than\nhave him punished for his offences (as he would be if he prowled about\nin this country), I give him more money than I can afford, at intervals\nwhen he reappears, to go away. I was a fool when I married him; and I am\nso far an incurable fool on that subject, that, for the sake of what I\nonce believed him to be, I wouldn't have even this shadow of my idle\nfancy hardly dealt with. For I was in earnest, Trot, if ever a woman\nwas.\"\n\nMy aunt dismissed the matter with a heavy sigh, and smoothed her dress.\n\n\"There, my dear!\" she said. \"Now, you know the beginning, middle, and\nend, and all about it. We won't mention the subject to one another any\nmore; neither, of course, will you mention it to anybody else. This is\nmy grumpy, frumpy story, and we'll keep it to ourselves, Trot!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nDOMESTIC.\n\n\nI labored hard at my book, without allowing it to interfere with the\npunctual discharge of my newspaper duties; and it came out and was very\nsuccessful. I was not stunned by the praise which sounded in my ears,\nnotwithstanding that I was keenly alive to it, and thought better of my\nown performance, I have little doubt, than anybody else did. It has\nalways been in my observation of human nature, that a man who has any\ngood reason to believe in himself never flourishes himself before the\nfaces of other people in order that they may believe in him. For this\nreason, I retained my modesty in very self-respect; and the more praise\nI got, the more I tried to deserve.\n\nIt is not my purpose, in this record, though in all other essentials it\nis my written memory, to pursue the history of my own fictions. They\nexpress themselves, and I leave them to themselves. When I refer to\nthem, incidentally, it is only as a part of my progress.\n\nHaving some foundation for believing, by this time, that nature and\naccident had made me an author, I pursued my vocation with confidence.\nWithout such assurance I should certainly have left it alone, and\nbestowed my energy on some other endeavour. I should have tried to find\nout what nature and accident really had made me, and to be that, and\nnothing else.\n\nI had been writing, in the newspaper and elsewhere, so prosperously,\nthat when my new success was achieved, I considered myself reasonably\nentitled to escape from the dreary debates. One joyful night, therefore,\nI noted down the music of the parliamentary bagpipes for the last time,\nand I have never heard it since; though I still recognise the old drone\nin the newspapers, without any substantial variation (except, perhaps,\nthat there is more of it), all the livelong session.\n\nI now write of the time when I had been married, I suppose, about a year\nand a half. After several varieties of experiment, we had given up the\nhousekeeping as a bad job. The house kept itself, and we kept a page.\nThe principal function of this retainer was to quarrel with the cook; in\nwhich respect he was a perfect Whittington, without his cat, or the\nremotest chance of being made Lord Mayor.\n\nHe appears to me to have lived in a hail of saucepan-lids. His whole\nexistence was a scuffle. He would shriek for help on the most improper\noccasions,--as, when we had a little dinner party, or a few friends in\nthe evening,--and would come tumbling out of the kitchen, with iron\nmissiles flying after him. We wanted to get rid of him, but he was very\nmuch attached to us, and wouldn't go. He was a tearful boy, and broke\ninto such deplorable lamentations, when a cessation of our connexion was\nhinted at, that we were obliged to keep him. He had no mother--no\nanything in the way of a relative, that I could discover, except a\nsister, who fled to America the moment we had taken him off her hands;\nand he became quartered on us like a horrible young changeling. He had a\nlively perception of his own unfortunate state, and was always rubbing\nhis eyes with the sleeve of his jacket, or stooping to blow his nose on\nthe extreme corner of a little pocket-handkerchief, which he never\n_would_ take completely out of his pocket, but always economised and\nsecreted.\n\nThis unlucky page, engaged in an evil hour at six pounds ten per annum,\nwas a source of continual trouble to me. I watched him as he grew--and\nhe grew like scarlet beans--with painful apprehensions of the time when\nhe would begin to shave; even of the days when he would be bald or grey.\nI saw no prospect of ever getting rid of him; and, projecting myself\ninto the future, used to think what an inconvenience he would be when he\nwas an old man.\n\nI never expected anything less, than this unfortunate's manner of\ngetting me out of my difficulty. He stole Dora's watch, which, like\neverything else belonging to us, had no particular place of its own;\nand, converting it into money, spent the produce (he was always a\nweak-minded boy) in incessantly riding up and down between London\nand Uxbridge outside the coach. He was taken to Bow Street, as well\nas I remember, on the completion of his fifteenth journey; when\nfour-and-sixpence, and a second-hand fife which he couldn't play, were\nfound upon his person.\n\nThe surprise and its consequences would have been much less disagreeable\nto me if he had not been penitent. But he was very penitent indeed, and\nin a peculiar way--not in the lump, but by instalments. For example; the\nday after that on which I was obliged to appear against him, he made\ncertain revelations touching a hamper in the cellar, which we believed\nto be full of wine, but which had nothing in it except bottles and\ncorks. We supposed he had now eased his mind, and told the worst he knew\nof the cook; but, a day or two afterwards, his conscience sustained a\nnew twinge, and he disclosed how she had a little girl, who, early every\nmorning, took away our bread; and also how he himself had been suborned\nto maintain the milkman in coals. In two or three days more, I was\ninformed by the authorities of his having led to the discovery of\nsirloins of beef among the kitchen-stuff, and sheets in the rag-bag. A\nlittle while afterwards, he broke out in an entirely new direction, and\nconfessed to a knowledge of burglarious intentions as to our premises,\non the part of the pot-boy, who was immediately taken up. I got to be so\nashamed of being such a victim, that I would have given him any money to\nhold his tongue, or would have offered a round bribe for his being\npermitted to run away. It was an aggravating circumstance in the case\nthat he had no idea of this, but conceived that he was making me amends\nin every new discovery: not to say, heaping obligations on my head.\n\nAt last I ran away myself, whenever I saw an emissary of the police\napproaching with some new intelligence; and lived a stealthy life until\nhe was tried and ordered to be transported. Even then he couldn't be\nquiet, but was always writing us letters; and wanted so much to see Dora\nbefore he went away, that Dora went to visit him, and fainted when she\nfound herself inside the iron bars. In short I had no peace of my life\nuntil he was expatriated, and made (as I afterwards heard) a shepherd\nof, \"up the country\" somewhere; I have no geographical idea where.\n\nAll this led me into some serious reflections, and presented our\nmistakes in a new aspect; as I could not help communicating to Dora one\nevening, in spite of my tenderness for her.\n\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it is very painful to me to think that our want of\nsystem and management, involves not only ourselves (which we have got\nused to), but other people.\"\n\n\"You have been silent for a long time, and now you are going to be\ncross!\" said Dora.\n\n\"No, my dear, indeed! Let me explain to you what I mean.\"\n\n\"I think I don't want to know,\" said Dora.\n\n\"But I want you to know, my love. Put Jip down.\"\n\nDora put his nose to mine, and said \"Boh!\" to drive my seriousness away;\nbut, not succeeding, ordered him into his Pagoda, and sat looking at me,\nwith her hands folded, and a most resigned little expression of\ncountenance.\n\n\"The fact is, my dear,\" I began, \"there is contagion in us. We infect\neveryone about us.\"\n\nI might have gone on in this figurative manner, if Dora's face had not\nadmonished me that she was wondering with all her might whether I was\ngoing to propose any new kind of vaccination, or other medical remedy,\nfor this unwholesome state of ours. Therefore I checked myself, and made\nmy meaning plainer.\n\n\"It is not merely, my pet,\" said I, \"that we lose money and comfort, and\neven temper sometimes, by not learning to be more careful; but that we\nincur the serious responsibility of spoiling everyone who comes into our\nservice, or has any dealings with us. I begin to be afraid that the\nfault is not entirely on one side, but that these people all turn out\nill because we don't turn out very well ourselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, what an accusation,\" exclaimed Dora, opening her eyes wide; \"to say\nthat you ever saw me take gold watches! Oh!\"\n\n\"My dearest,\" I remonstrated, \"don't talk preposterous nonsense! Who has\nmade the least allusion to gold watches?\"\n\n\"You did,\" returned Dora. \"You know you did. You said I hadn't turned\nout well, and compared me to him.\"\n\n\"To whom?\" I asked.\n\n\"To the page,\" sobbed Dora. \"Oh, you cruel fellow, to compare your\naffectionate wife to a transported page! Why didn't you tell me\nyour opinion of me before we were married? Why didn't you say, you\nhard-hearted thing, that you were convinced I was worse than a\ntransported page? Oh, what a dreadful opinion to have of me! Oh, my\ngoodness!\"\n\n\"Now, Dora, my love,\" I returned, gently trying to remove the\nhandkerchief she pressed to her eyes, \"this is not only very ridiculous\nof you, but very wrong. In the first place, it's not true.\"\n\n\"You always said he was a story-teller,\" sobbed Dora. \"And now you say\nthe same of me! Oh, what shall I do! What shall I do!\"\n\n\"My darling girl,\" I retorted, \"I really must entreat you to be\nreasonable, and listen to what I did say, and do say. My dear Dora,\nunless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ, they will never\nlearn to do their duty to us. I am afraid we present opportunities to\npeople to do wrong, that never ought to be presented. Even if we were\nas lax as we are, in all our arrangements, by choice--which we are\nnot--even if we liked it, and found it agreeable to be so--which we\ndon't--I am persuaded we should have no right to go on in this way.\nWe are positively corrupting people. We are bound to think of that.\nI can't help thinking of it, Dora. It is a reflection I am unable to\ndismiss, and it sometimes makes me very uneasy. There, dear, that's\nall. Come now! Don't be foolish!\"\n\nDora would not allow me, for a long time, to remove the handkerchief.\nShe sat sobbing and murmuring behind it, that, if I was uneasy, why had\nI ever been married? Why hadn't I said, even the day before we went to\nchurch, that I knew I should be uneasy, and I would rather not? If I\ncouldn't bear her, why didn't I send her away to her aunts at Putney, or\nto Julia Mills in India? Julia would be glad to see her, and would not\ncall her a transported page; Julia never had called her anything of the\nsort. In short, Dora was so afflicted, and so afflicted me by being in\nthat condition, that I felt it was of no use repeating this kind of\neffort, though never so mildly, and I must take some other course.\n\nWhat other course was left to take! To \"form her mind?\" This was a\ncommon phrase of words which had a fair and promising sound, and I\nresolved to form Dora's mind.\n\nI began immediately. When Dora was very childish, and I would have\ninfinitely preferred to humour her, I tried to be grave--and\ndisconcerted her, and myself too. I talked to her on the subjects which\noccupied my thoughts; and I read Shakespeare to her--and fatigued her to\nthe last degree. I accustomed myself to giving her, as it were quite\ncasually, little scraps of useful information, or sound opinion--and she\nstarted from them when I let them off, as if they had been crackers. No\nmatter how incidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little\nwife's mind, I could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive\nperception of what I was about, and became a prey to the keenest\napprehensions. In particular, it was clear to me, that she thought\nShakespeare a terrible fellow. The formation went on very slowly.\n\nI pressed Traddles into the service without his knowledge; and whenever\nhe came to see us, exploded my mines upon him for the edification of\nDora at second hand. The amount of practical wisdom I bestowed upon\nTraddles in this manner was immense, and of the best quality; but it had\nno other effect upon Dora than to depress her spirits, and make her\nalways nervous with the dread that it would be her turn next. I found\nmyself in the condition of a schoolmaster, a trap, a pitfall; of always\nplaying spider to Dora's fly, and always pouncing out of my hole to her\ninfinite disturbance.\n\nStill, looking forward through this intermediate stage, to the time when\nthere should be a perfect sympathy between Dora and me, and when I\nshould have \"formed her mind\" to my entire satisfaction, I persevered,\neven for months. Finding at last, however, that, although I had been all\nthis time a very porcupine or hedgehog, bristling all over with\ndetermination, I had effected nothing, it began to occur to me that\nperhaps Dora's mind was already formed.\n\nOn farther consideration this appeared so likely, that I abandoned my\nscheme, which had had a more promising appearance in words than in\naction; resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my child-wife, and to\ntry to change her into nothing else by any process. I was heartily tired\nof being sagacious and prudent by myself, and of seeing my darling under\nrestraint; so, I bought a pretty pair of ear-rings for her, and a collar\nfor Jip, and went home one day to make myself agreeable.\n\nDora was delighted with the little presents, and kissed me joyfully;\nbut, there was a shadow between us, however slight, and I had made up my\nmind that it should not be there. If there must be such a shadow\nanywhere, I would keep it for the future in my own breast.\n\nI sat down by my wife on the sofa, and put the ear-rings in her ears;\nand then I told her that I feared we had not been quite as good company\nlately, as we used to be, and that the fault was mine. Which I sincerely\nfelt, and which indeed it was.\n\n\"The truth is, Dora, my life,\" I said; \"I have been trying to be wise.\"\n\n\"And to make me wise too,\" said Dora, timidly. \"Haven't you, Doady?\"\n\nI nodded assent to the pretty inquiry of the raised eyebrows, and kissed\nthe parted lips.\n\n\"It's of not a bit of use,\" said Dora, shaking her head, until the\near-rings rang again. \"You know what a little thing I am, and what I\nwanted you to call me from the first. If you can't do so, I am afraid\nyou'll never like me. Are you sure you don't think, sometimes, it would\nhave been better to have--\"\n\n\"Done what, my dear?\" For she made no effort to proceed.\n\n\"Nothing!\" said Dora.\n\n\"Nothing?\" I repeated.\n\nShe put her arms round my neck, and laughed, and called herself by her\nfavorite name of a goose, and hid her face on my shoulder in such a\nprofusion of curls that it was quite a task to clear them away and see\nit.\n\n\"Don't I think it would have been better to have done nothing, than to\nhave tried to form my little wife's mind?\" said I, laughing at myself.\n\"Is that the question? Yes, indeed, I do.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have been trying?\" cried Dora. \"Oh what a shocking\nboy!\"\n\n\"But I shall never try any more,\" said I. \"For I love her dearly as she\nis.\"\n\n\"Without a story--really?\" inquired Dora, creeping closer to me.\n\n\"Why should I seek to change,\" said I, \"what has been so precious to me\nfor so long! You never can show better than as your own natural self, my\nsweet Dora; and we'll try no conceited experiments, but go back to our\nold way, and be happy.\"\n\n\"And be happy!\" returned Dora. \"Yes! All day! And you won't mind things\ngoing a tiny morsel wrong, sometimes?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said I. \"We must do the best we can.\"\n\n\"And you won't tell me, any more, that we make other people bad,\" coaxed\nDora; \"will you? Because you know it's so dreadfully cross.\"\n\n\"No no,\" said I.\n\n\"It's better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable, isn't it?\" said\nDora.\n\n\"Better to be naturally Dora than anything else in the world.\"\n\n\"In the world! Ah Doady, it's a large place!\"\n\nShe shook her head, turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine, kissed\nme, broke into a merry laugh, and sprang away to put on Jip's new\ncollar.\n\nSo ended my last attempt to make any change in Dora. I had been unhappy\nin trying it; I could not endure my own solitary wisdom; I could not\nreconcile it with her former appeal to me as my child-wife. I resolved\nto do what I could, in a quiet way, to improve our proceedings myself;\nbut, I foresaw that my utmost would be very little, or I must degenerate\ninto the spider again, and be for ever lying in wait.\n\nAnd the shadow I have mentioned, that was not to be between us any more,\nbut was to rest wholly on my own heart? How did that fall?\n\nThe old unhappy feeling pervaded my life. It was deepened, if it were\nchanged at all; but it was as undefined as ever, and addressed me like a\nstrain of sorrowful music faintly heard in the night. I loved my wife\ndearly, and I was happy; but the happiness I had vaguely anticipated,\nonce, was not the happiness I enjoyed, and there was always something\nwanting.\n\nIn fulfilment of the compact I have made with myself, to reflect my mind\non this paper, I again examine it, closely, and bring its secrets to the\nlight. What I missed, I still regarded--I always regarded--as something\nthat had been a dream of my youthful fancy; that was incapable of\nrealisation; that I was now discovering to be so, with some natural\npain, as all men did. But, that it would have been better for me if my\nwife could have helped me more, and shared the many thoughts in which I\nhad no partner; and that this might have been; I knew.\n\nBetween these two irreconcileable conclusions: the one, that what I\nfelt, was general and unavoidable; the other, that it was particular to\nme, and might have been different: I balanced curiously, with no\ndistinct sense of their opposition to each other. When I thought of the\nairy dreams of youth that are incapable of realisation, I thought of the\nbetter state preceding manhood that I had outgrown; and then the\ncontented days with Agnes, in the dear old house, arose before me, like\nspectres of the dead, that might have some renewal in another world, but\nnever never more could be reanimated here.\n\nSometimes, the speculation came into my thoughts, what might have\nhappened, or what would have happened, if Dora and I had never known\neach other? But, she was so incorporated with my existence, that it was\nthe idlest of all fancies, and would soon rise out of my reach and\nsight, like gossamer floating in the air.\n\nI always loved her. What I am describing, slumbered, and half awoke, and\nslept again, in the innermost recesses of my mind. There was no evidence\nof it in me; I know of no influence it had in anything I said or did. I\nbore the weight of all our little cares, and all my projects; Dora held\nthe pens; and we both felt that our shares were adjusted as the case\nrequired. She was truly fond of me, and proud of me; and when Agnes\nwrote a few earnest words in her letters to Dora, of the pride and\ninterest with which my old friends heard of my growing reputation, and\nread my book as if they heard me speaking its contents, Dora read them\nout to me with tears of joy in her bright eyes, and said I was a dear\nold clever, famous boy.\n\n\"The first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart.\" Those words of\nMrs. Strong's were constantly recurring to me, at this time; were almost\nalways present to my mind. I awoke with them, often, in the night; I\nremember to have even read them, in dreams, inscribed upon the walls of\nhouses. For I knew, now, that my own heart was undisciplined when it\nfirst loved Dora; and that if it had been disciplined, it never could\nhave felt, when we were married, what it had felt in its secret\nexperience.\n\n\"There can be no disparity in marriage, like unsuitability of mind and\npurpose.\" Those words I remembered too. I had endeavoured to adapt Dora\nto myself, and found it impracticable. It remained for me to adapt\nmyself to Dora; to share with her what I could, and be happy; to bear on\nmy own shoulders what I must, and be happy still. This was the\ndiscipline to which I tried to bring my heart, when I began to think. It\nmade my second year much happier than my first; and, what was better\nstill, made Dora's life all sunshine.\n\nBut, as that year wore on, Dora was not strong. I had hoped that lighter\nhands than mine would help to mould her character, and that a baby-smile\nupon her breast might change my child-wife to a woman. It was not to be.\nThe spirit fluttered for a moment on the threshold of its little prison,\nand, unconscious of captivity, took wing.\n\n\"When I can run about again, as I used to do, aunt,\" said Dora, \"I shall\nmake Jip race. He is getting quite slow and lazy.\"\n\n\"I suspect, my dear,\" said my aunt, quietly working by her side, \"he has\na worse disorder than that. Age, Dora.\"\n\n\"Do you think he is old?\" said Dora, astonished. \"Oh, how strange it\nseems that Jip should be old!\"\n\n\"It's a complaint we are all liable to, Little One, as we get on in\nlife,\" said my aunt, cheerfully; \"I don't feel more free from it than I\nused to be, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But Jip,\" said Dora, looking at him with compassion, \"even little Jip!\nOh, poor fellow!\"\n\n\"I dare say he'll last a long time yet, Blossom,\" said my aunt, patting\nDora on the cheek, as she leaned out of her couch to look at Jip, who\nresponded by standing on his hind legs, and baulking himself in various\nasthmatic attempts to scramble up by the head and shoulders. \"He must\nhave a piece of flannel in his house this winter, and I shouldn't wonder\nif he came out quite fresh again, with the flowers, in the spring. Bless\nthe little dog!\" exclaimed my aunt, \"if he had as many lives as a cat,\nand was on the point of losing 'em all, he'd bark at me with his last\nbreath, I believe!\"\n\nDora had helped him up on the sofa; where he really was defying my aunt\nto such a furious extent, that he couldn't keep straight, but barked\nhimself sideways. The more my aunt looked at him, the more he reproached\nher; for, she had lately taken to spectacles, and for some inscrutable\nreason he considered the glasses personal.\n\nDora made him lie down by her, with a good deal of persuasion; and when\nhe was quiet, drew one of his long ears through and through her hand,\nrepeating, thoughtfully, \"Even little Jip! Oh, poor fellow!\"\n\n\"His lungs are good enough,\" said my aunt, gaily, \"and his dislikes are\nnot at all feeble. He has a good many years before him, no doubt. But if\nyou want a dog to race with, Little Blossom, he has lived too well for\nthat, and I'll give you one.\"\n\n\"Thank you, aunt,\" said Dora, faintly. \"But, don't, please!\"\n\n\"No?\" said my aunt, taking off her spectacles.\n\n\"I couldn't have any other dog but Jip,\" said Dora. \"It would be so\nunkind to Jip! Besides, I couldn't be such friends with any other dog\nbut Jip; because he wouldn't have known me before I was married, and\nwouldn't have barked at Doady when he first came to our house. I\ncouldn't care for any other dog but Jip, I am afraid, aunt.\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" said my aunt, patting her cheek again. \"You are right.\"\n\n\"You are not offended,\" said Dora. \"Are you?\"\n\n\"Why, what a sensitive pet it is!\" cried my aunt, bending over her\naffectionately. \"To think that I could be offended!\"\n\n\"No, no, I didn't really think so,\" returned Dora; \"but I am a little\ntired, and it made me silly for a moment--I am always a silly little\nthing, you know, but it made me more silly--to talk about Jip. He has\nknown me in all that has happened to me, haven't you, Jip? And I\ncouldn't bear to slight him, because he was a little altered--could I,\nJip?\"\n\nJip nestled closer to his mistress, and lazily licked her hand.\n\n\"You are not so old, Jip, are you, that you'll leave your mistress yet,\"\nsaid Dora. \"We may keep one another company, a little longer!\"\n\nMy pretty Dora! When she came down to dinner on the ensuing Sunday, and\nwas so glad to see old Traddles (who always dined with us on Sunday), we\nthought she would be \"running about as she used to do,\" in a few days.\nBut they said, wait a few days more; and then, wait a few days more; and\nstill she neither ran nor walked. She looked very pretty, and was very\nmerry; but the little feet that used to be so nimble when they danced\nround Jip, were dull and motionless.\n\nI began to carry her down stairs every morning, and upstairs every\nnight. She would clasp me round the neck and laugh, the while, as if I\ndid it for a wager. Jip would bark and caper round us, and go on before,\nand look back on the landing, breathing short, to see that we were\ncoming. My aunt, the best and most cheerful of nurses, would trudge\nafter us, a moving mass of shawls and pillows. Mr. Dick would not have\nrelinquished his post of candle-bearer to any one alive. Traddles would\nbe often at the bottom of the staircase, looking on, and taking charge\nof sportive messages from Dora to the dearest girl in the world. We made\nquite a gay procession of it, and my child-wife was the gayest there.\n\nBut, sometimes, when I took her up, and felt that she was lighter in my\narms, a dead blank feeling came upon me, as if I were approaching to\nsome frozen region yet unseen, that numbed my life. I avoided the\nrecognition of this feeling by any name, or by any communing with\nmyself; until one night, when it was very strong upon me, and my aunt\nhad left her with a parting cry of \"Good night, Little Blossom,\" I sat\ndown at my desk alone, and cried to think, O what a fatal name it was,\nand how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nI AM INVOLVED IN MYSTERY.\n\n\nI received one morning by the post, the following letter, dated\nCanterbury, and addressed to me at Doctors' Commons; which I read with\nsome surprise:\n\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\n\n     \"Circumstances beyond my individual control have, for a\n     considerable lapse of time, effected a severance of that intimacy\n     which, in the limited opportunities conceded to me in the midst\n     of my professional duties, of contemplating the scenes and events\n     of the past, tinged by the prismatic hues of memory, has ever\n     afforded me, as it ever must continue to afford, gratifying\n     emotions of no common description. This fact, my dear sir,\n     combined with the distinguished elevation to which your talents\n     have raised you, deters me from presuming to aspire to the\n     liberty of addressing the companion of my youth, by the familiar\n     appellation of Copperfield! It is sufficient to know that the name\n     to which I do myself the honor to refer, will ever be treasured\n     among the muniments of our house (I allude to the archives\n     connected with our former lodgers, preserved by Mrs. Micawber),\n     with sentiments of personal esteem amounting to affection.\n\n     \"It is not for one, situated, through his original errors and a\n     fortuitous combination of unpropitious events, as is the foundered\n     Bark (if he may be allowed to assume so maritime a denomination),\n     who now takes up the pen to address you--it is not, I repeat, for\n     one so circumstanced, to adopt the language of compliment, or of\n     congratulation. That, he leaves to abler and to purer hands.\n\n     \"If your more important avocations should admit of your ever\n     tracing these imperfect characters thus far--which may be, or may\n     not be, as circumstances arise--you will naturally inquire by what\n     object am I influenced, then, in inditing the present missive?\n     Allow me to say that I fully defer to the reasonable character of\n     that inquiry, and proceed to develope it; premising that it is\n     _not_ an object of a pecuniary nature.\n\n     \"Without more directly referring to any latent ability that\n     may possibly exist on my part, of wielding the thunderbolt, or\n     directing the devouring and avenging flame in any quarter, I may\n     be permitted to observe, in passing, that my brightest visions\n     are for ever dispelled--that my peace is shattered and my power\n     of enjoyment destroyed--that my heart is no longer in the right\n     place--and that I no more walk erect before my fellow man. The\n     canker is in the flower. The cup is bitter to the brim. The worm\n     is at his work, and will soon dispose of his victim. The sooner\n     the better. But I will not digress.\n\n     \"Placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness, beyond\n     the assuaging reach even of Mrs. Micawber's influence, though\n     exercised in the tripartite character of woman, wife, and mother,\n     it is my intention to fly from myself for a short period, and\n     devote a respite of eight-and-forty hours to revisiting some\n     metropolitan scenes of past enjoyment. Among other havens of\n     domestic tranquillity and peace of mind, my feet will naturally\n     tend towards the King's Bench Prison. In stating that I shall\n     be (D. V.) on the outside of the south wall of that place of\n     incarceration on civil process, the day after to-morrow, at\n     seven in the evening, precisely, my object in this epistolary\n     communication is accomplished.\n\n     \"I do not feel warranted in soliciting my former friend Mr.\n     Copperfield, or my former friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner\n     Temple, if that gentleman is still existent and forthcoming, to\n     condescend to meet me, and renew (so far as may be) our past\n     relations of the olden time. I confine myself to throwing out the\n     observation, that, at the hour and place I have indicated, may be\n     found such ruined vestiges as yet\n\n                        \"Remain,\n                               \"Of\n                                  \"A\n                                     \"Fallen Tower,\n                                                \"WILKINS MICAWBER.\n\n     \"P.S. It may be advisable to superadd to the above, the statement\n     that Mrs. Micawber is _not_ in confidential possession of my\n     intentions.\"\n\nI read the letter over, several times. Making due allowance for Mr.\nMicawber's lofty style of composition, and for the extraordinary relish\nwith which he sat down and wrote long letters on all possible and\nimpossible occasions, I still believed that something important lay\nhidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication. I put it down, to\nthink about it; and took it up again, to read it once more; and was\nstill pursuing it, when Traddles found me in the height of my\nperplexity.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said I, \"I never was better pleased to see you. You\ncome to give me the benefit of your sober judgment at a most opportune\ntime. I have received a very singular letter, Traddles, from Mr.\nMicawber.\"\n\n\"No?\" cried Traddles. \"You don't say so? And I have received one from\nMrs. Micawber!\"\n\nWith that, Traddles, who was flushed with walking, and whose hair,\nunder the combined effects of exercise and excitement, stood on end as\nif he saw a cheerful ghost, produced his letter and made an exchange\nwith me. I watched him into the heart of Mr. Micawber's letter, and\nreturned the elevation of eyebrows with which he said \"'Wielding the\nthunderbolt, or directing the devouring and avenging flame!' Bless\nme, Copperfield!\"--and then entered on the perusal of Mrs. Micawber's\nepistle.\n\nIt ran thus:\n\n     \"My best regards to Mr. Thomas Traddles, and if he should still\n     remember one who formerly had the happiness of being well\n     acquainted with him, may I beg a few moments of his leisure time?\n     I assure Mr. T. T. that I would not intrude upon his kindness,\n     were I in any other position than on the confines of distraction.\n\n     \"Though harrowing to myself to mention, the alienation of Mr.\n     Micawber (formerly so domesticated) from his wife and family, is\n     the cause of my addressing my unhappy appeal to Mr. Traddles,\n     and soliciting his best indulgence. Mr. T. can form no adequate\n     idea of the change in Mr. Micawber's conduct, of his wildness, of\n     his violence. It has gradually augmented, until it assumes the\n     appearance of aberration of intellect. Scarcely a day passes, I\n     assure Mr. Traddles, on which some paroxysm does not take place.\n     Mr. T. will not require me to depict my feelings, when I inform\n     him that I have become accustomed to hear Mr. Micawber assert\n     that he has sold himself to the D. Mystery and secresy have long\n     been his principal characteristic, have long replaced unlimited\n     confidence. The slightest provocation, even being asked if there\n     is anything he would prefer for dinner, causes him to express a\n     wish for a separation. Last night, on being childishly solicited\n     for twopence, to buy 'lemon-stunners'--a local sweetmeat--he\n     presented an oyster-knife at the twins!\n\n     \"I entreat Mr. Traddles to bear with me in entering into these\n     details. Without them, Mr. T. would indeed find it difficult to\n     form the faintest conception of my heart-rending situation.\n\n     \"May I now venture to confide to Mr. T. the purport of my\n     letter? Will he now allow me to throw myself on his friendly\n     consideration? Oh yes, for I know his heart!\n\n     \"The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded, when of the\n     female sex. Mr. Micawber is going to London. Though he studiously\n     concealed his hand, this morning before breakfast, in writing the\n     direction-card which he attached to the little brown valise of\n     happier days, the eagle-glance of matrimonial anxiety detected\n     d,o,n, distinctly traced. The West-End destination of the coach,\n     is the Golden Cross. Dare I fervently implore Mr. T. to see my\n     misguided husband, and to reason with him? Dare I ask Mr. T. to\n     endeavour to step in between Mr. Micawber and his agonised family?\n     Oh no, for that would be too much!\n\n     \"If Mr. Copperfield should yet remember one unknown to fame,\n     will Mr. T. take charge of my unalterable regards and similar\n     entreaties? In any case, he will have the benevolence _to consider\n     this communication strictly private, and on no account whatever\n     to be alluded to, however distantly, in the presence of Mr.\n     Micawber_. If Mr. T. should ever reply to it (which I cannot but\n     feel to be _most_ improbable), a letter addressed to M. E., Post\n     Office, Canterbury, will be fraught with less painful consequences\n     than any addressed immediately to one, who subscribes herself, in\n     extreme distress,\n\n        \"Mr. Thomas Traddles's respectful friend and suppliant,\n                                                        \"EMMA MICAWBER.\"\n\n\"What do you think of that letter?\" said Traddles, casting his eyes upon\nme, when I had read it twice.\n\n\"What do you think of the other?\" said I. For he was still reading it\nwith knitted brows.\n\n\"I think that the two together, Copperfield,\" replied Traddles,\n\"mean more than Mr. and Mrs. Micawber usually mean in their\ncorrespondence--but I don't know what. They are both written in good\nfaith, I have no doubt, and without any collusion. Poor thing!\" he was\nnow alluding to Mrs. Micawber's letter, and we were standing side by\nside comparing the two; \"it will be a charity to write to her, at all\nevents, and tell her that we will not fail to see Mr. Micawber.\"\n\nI acceded to this, the more readily, because I now reproached myself\nwith having treated her former letter rather lightly. It had set me\nthinking a good deal at the time, as I have mentioned in its place; but\nmy absorption in my own affairs, my experience of the family, and my\nhearing nothing more, had gradually ended in my dismissing the subject.\nI had often thought of the Micawbers, but chiefly to wonder what\n\"pecuniary liabilities\" they were establishing in Canterbury, and to\nrecall how shy Mr. Micawber was of me when he became clerk to Uriah\nHeep.\n\nHowever, I now wrote a comforting letter to Mrs. Micawber, in our joint\nnames, and we both signed it. As we walked into town to post it,\nTraddles and I held a long conference, and launched into a number of\nspeculations, which I need not repeat. We took my aunt into our counsels\nin the afternoon; but our only decided conclusion was, that we would be\nvery punctual in keeping Mr. Micawber's appointment.\n\nAlthough we appeared at the stipulated place a quarter of an hour before\nthe time, we found Mr. Micawber already there. He was standing with his\narms folded, over against the wall, looking at the spikes on the top,\nwith a sentimental expression, as if they were the interlacing boughs of\ntrees that had shaded him in his youth.\n\nWhen we accosted him, his manner was something more confused, and\nsomething less genteel, than of yore. He had relinquished his legal suit\nof black for the purposes of this excursion, and wore the old surtout\nand tights, but not quite with the old air. He gradually picked up more\nand more of it as we conversed with him; but, his very eye-glass seemed\nto hang less easily, and his shirt collar, though still of the old\nformidable dimensions, rather drooped.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" said Mr. Micawber, after the first salutations, \"you are\nfriends in need, and friends indeed. Allow me to offer my inquiries with\nreference to the physical welfare of Mrs. Copperfield _in esse_, and\nMrs. Traddles _in posse_,--presuming, that is to say, that my friend Mr.\nTraddles is not yet united to the object of his affections, for weal and\nfor woe.\"\n\nWe acknowledged his politeness, and made suitable replies. He then\ndirected our attention to the wall, and was beginning \"I assure you,\ngentlemen,\" when I ventured to object to that ceremonious form of\naddress, and to beg that he would speak to us in the old way.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" he returned, pressing my hand, \"your cordiality\noverpowers me. This reception of a shattered fragment of the Temple once\ncalled Man--if I may be permitted so to express myself--bespeaks a heart\nthat is an honor to our common nature. I was about to observe that I\nagain behold the serene spot where some of the happiest hours of my\nexistence fleeted by.\"\n\n\"Made so, I am sure, by Mrs. Micawber,\" said I. \"I hope she is well?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" returned Mr. Micawber, whose face clouded at this\nreference, \"she is but so-so. And this,\" said Mr. Micawber, nodding his\nhead sorrowfully, \"is the Bench! Where, for the first time in many\nrevolving years, the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities was\nnot proclaimed, from day to day, by importunate voices declining to\nvacate the passage; where there was no knocker on the door for any\ncreditor to appeal to; where personal service of process was not\nrequired, and detainers were merely lodged at the gate! Gentlemen,\" said\nMr. Micawber, \"when the shadow of that iron-work on the summit of the\nbrick structure has been reflected on the gravel of the Parade, I have\nseen my children thread the mazes of the intricate pattern, avoiding the\ndark marks. I have been familiar with every stone in the place. If I\nbetray weakness, you will know how to excuse me.\"\n\n\"We have all got on in life since then, Mr. Micawber,\" said I.\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" returned Mr. Micawber, bitterly, \"when I was an\ninmate of that retreat I could look my fellow-man in the face, and punch\nhis head if he offended me. My fellow-man and myself are no longer on\nthose glorious terms!\"\n\nTurning from the building in a downcast manner, Mr. Micawber accepted my\nproffered arm on one side, and the proffered arm of Traddles on the\nother, and walked away between us.\n\n\"There are some landmarks,\" observed Mr. Micawber, looking fondly back\nover his shoulder, \"on the road to the tomb, which, but for the impiety\nof the aspiration, a man would wish never to have passed. Such is the\nBench in my chequered career.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are in low spirits, Mr. Micawber,\" said Traddles.\n\n\"I am, sir,\" interposed Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Traddles, \"it is not because you have conceived a dislike\nto the law--for I am a lawyer myself, you know.\"\n\nMr. Micawber answered not a word.\n\n\"How is our friend Heep, Mr. Micawber?\" said I, after a silence.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" returned Mr. Micawber, bursting into a state of\nmuch excitement, and turning pale, \"if you ask after my employer as\n_your_ friend, I am sorry for it; if you ask after him as _my_ friend, I\nsardonically smile at it. In whatever capacity you ask after my\nemployer, I beg, without offence to you, to limit my reply to this--that\nwhatever his state of health may be, his appearance is foxy: not to say\ndiabolical. You will allow me, as a private individual, to decline\npursuing a subject which has lashed me to the utmost verge of\ndesperation in my professional capacity.\"\n\nI expressed my regret for having innocently touched upon a theme that\nroused him so much. \"May I ask,\" said I, \"without any hazard of\nrepeating the mistake, how my old friends Mr. and Miss Wickfield are?\"\n\n\"Miss Wickfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, now turning red, \"is, as she always\nis, a pattern, and a bright example. My dear Copperfield, she is the\nonly starry spot in a miserable existence. My respect for that young\nlady, my admiration of her character, my devotion to her for her love\nand truth, and goodness!--Take me,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"down a turning,\nfor, upon my soul, in my present state of mind I am not equal to this!\"\n\nWe wheeled him off into a narrow street, where he took out his\npocket-handkerchief, and stood with his back to a wall. If I looked as\ngravely at him as Traddles did, he must have found our company by no\nmeans inspiriting.\n\n\"It is my fate,\" said Mr. Micawber, unfeignedly sobbing, but doing even\nthat, with a shadow of the old expression of doing something genteel;\n\"it is my fate, gentlemen, that the finer feelings of our nature have\nbecome reproaches to me. My homage to Miss Wickfield, is a flight of\narrows in my bosom. You had better leave me, if you please, to walk the\nearth as a vagabond. The worm will settle _my_ business in double-quick\ntime.\"\n\nWithout attending to this invocation, we stood by, until he put up his\npocket-handkerchief, pulled up his shirt-collar, and, to delude any\nperson in the neighbourhood who might have been observing him, hummed a\ntune with his hat very much on one side. I then mentioned--not knowing\nwhat might be lost, if we lost sight of him yet--that it would give me\ngreat pleasure to introduce him to my aunt, if he would ride out to\nHighgate, where a bed was at his service.\n\n\"You shall make us a glass of your own punch, Mr. Micawber,\" said I,\n\"and forget whatever you have on your mind, in pleasanter\nreminiscences.\"\n\n\"Or, if confiding anything to friends will be more likely to relieve\nyou, you shall impart it to us, Mr. Micawber,\" said Traddles, prudently.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"do with me as you will! I am a\nstraw upon the surface of the deep, and am tossed in all directions by\nthe elephants--I beg your pardon; I should have said the elements.\"\n\nWe walked on, arm-in-arm, again; found the coach in the act of starting;\nand arrived at Highgate without encountering any difficulties by the\nway. I was very uneasy and very uncertain in my mind what to say or do\nfor the best--so was Traddles, evidently. Mr. Micawber was for the most\npart plunged into deep gloom. He occasionally made an attempt to smarten\nhimself, and hum the fag-end of a tune; but his relapses into profound\nmelancholy were only made the more impressive by the mockery of a hat\nexceedingly on one side, and a shirt-collar pulled up to his eyes.\n\nWe went to my aunt's house rather than to mine, because of Dora's not\nbeing well. My aunt presented herself on being sent for, and welcomed\nMr. Micawber with gracious cordiality. Mr. Micawber kissed her hand,\nretired to the window, and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief, had a\nmental wrestle with himself.\n\nMr. Dick was at home. He was by nature so exceedingly compassionate of\nanyone who seemed to be ill at ease, and was so quick to find any such\nperson out, that he shook hands with Mr. Micawber, at least half-a-dozen\ntimes in five minutes. To Mr. Micawber, in his trouble, this warmth, on\nthe part of a stranger, was so extremely touching, that he could only\nsay, on the occasion of each successive shake, \"My dear sir, you\noverpower me!\" Which gratified Mr. Dick so much, that he went at it\nagain with greater vigor than before.\n\n\"The friendliness of this gentleman,\" said Mr. Micawber to my aunt, \"if\nyou will allow me, ma'am, to cull a figure of speech from the vocabulary\nof our coarser national sports--floors me. To a man who is struggling\nwith a complicated burden of perplexity and disquiet, such a reception\nis trying, I assure you.\"\n\n\"My friend Mr. Dick,\" replied my aunt, proudly, \"is not a common man.\"\n\n\"That I am convinced of,\" said Mr. Micawber. \"My dear sir!\" for Mr. Dick\nwas shaking hands with him again; \"I am deeply sensible of your\ncordiality!\"\n\n\"How do you find yourself?\" said Mr. Dick, with an anxious look.\n\n\"Indifferent, my dear sir,\" returned Mr. Micawber, sighing.\n\n\"You must keep up your spirits,\" said Mr. Dick, \"and make yourself as\ncomfortable as possible.\"\n\nMr. Micawber was quite overcome by these friendly words, and by finding\nMr. Dick's hand again within his own. \"It has been my lot,\" he observed,\n\"to meet, in the diversified panorama of human existence, with an\noccasional oasis, but never with one so green, so gushing, as the\npresent!\"\n\nAt another time I should have been amused by this; but I felt that we\nwere all constrained and uneasy, and I watched Mr. Micawber so\nanxiously, in his vacillations between an evident disposition to reveal\nsomething, and a counter-disposition to reveal nothing, that I was in a\nperfect fever. Traddles, sitting on the edge of his chair, with his eyes\nwide open, and his hair more emphatically erect than ever, stared by\nturns at the ground and at Mr. Micawber, without so much as attempting\nto put in a word. My aunt, though I saw that her shrewdest observation\nwas concentrated on her new guest, had more useful possession of her\nwits than either of us; for she held him in conversation, and made it\nnecessary for him to talk, whether he liked it or not.\n\n\"You are a very old friend of my nephew's, Mr. Micawber,\" said my aunt.\n\"I wish I had had the pleasure of seeing you before.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"I wish I had had the honor of knowing\nyou at an earlier period. I was not always the wreck you at present\nbehold.\"\n\n\"I hope Mrs. Micawber and your family are well, sir,\" said my aunt.\n\nMr. Micawber inclined his head. \"They are as well, ma'am,\" he\ndesperately observed after a pause, \"as Aliens and Outcasts can ever\nhope to be.\"\n\n\"Lord bless you, sir!\" exclaimed my aunt, in her abrupt way. \"What are\nyou talking about?\"\n\n\"The subsistence of my family, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"trembles\nin the balance. My employer----\"\n\nHere Mr. Micawber provokingly left off; and began to peel the lemons\nthat had been under my directions set before him, together with all the\nother appliances he used in making punch.\n\n\"Your employer, you know,\" said Mr. Dick, jogging his arm as a gentle\nreminder.\n\n\"My good sir,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"you recall me. I am obliged to\nyou.\" They shook hands again. \"My employer, ma'am--Mr. Heep--once did me\nthe favor to observe to me, that if I were not in the receipt of the\nstipendiary emoluments appertaining to my engagement with him, I should\nprobably be a mountebank about the country swallowing a sword-blade, and\neating the devouring element. For anything that I can perceive to the\ncontrary, it is still probable that my children may be reduced to seek a\nlivelihood by personal contortion, while Mrs. Micawber abets their\nunnatural feats, by playing the barrel-organ.\"\n\nMr. Micawber, with a random but expressive flourish of his knife,\nsignified that these performances might be expected to take place after\nhe was no more; then resumed his peeling with a desperate air.\n\nMy aunt leaned her elbow on the little round table that she usually kept\nbeside her, and eyed him attentively. Notwithstanding the aversion with\nwhich I regarded the idea of entrapping him into any disclosure he was\nnot prepared to make voluntarily, I should have taken him up at this\npoint, but for the strange proceedings in which I saw him engaged;\nwhereof his putting the lemon-peel into the kettle, the sugar into the\nsnuffer-tray, the spirit into the empty jug, and confidently attempting\nto pour boiling water out of a candlestick, were among the most\nremarkable. I saw that a crisis was at hand, and it came. He clattered\nall his means and implements together, rose from his chair, pulled out\nhis pocket-handkerchief, and burst into tears.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, behind his handkerchief,\n\"this is an occupation, of all others, requiring an untroubled mind,\nand self-respect. I cannot perform it. It is out of the question.\"\n\n\"Mr. Micawber,\" said I, \"what is the matter? Pray speak out. You are\namong friends.\"\n\n\"Among friends, sir!\" repeated Mr. Micawber; and all he had reserved\ncame breaking out of him. \"Good heavens, it is principally because I\n_am_ among friends that my state of mind is what it is. What is the\nmatter, gentlemen? What is _not_ the matter? Villany is the matter;\nbaseness is the matter; deception, fraud, conspiracy, are the matter;\nand the name of the whole atrocious mass is--HEEP!\"\n\nMy aunt clapped her hands, and we all started up as if we were\npossessed.\n\n\"The struggle is over!\" said Mr. Micawber, violently gesticulating with\nhis pocket-handkerchief, and fairly striking out from time to time with\nboth arms, as if he were swimming under superhuman difficulties. \"I will\nlead this life no longer. I am a wretched being, cut off from everything\nthat makes life tolerable. I have been under a Taboo in that infernal\nscoundrel's service. Give me back my wife, give me back my family,\nsubstitute Micawber for the petty wretch who walks about in the boots at\npresent on my feet, and call upon me to swallow a sword to-morrow, and\nI'll do it. With an appetite!\"\n\nI never saw a man so hot in my life. I tried to calm him, that we might\ncome to something rational; but he got hotter and hotter, and wouldn't\nhear a word.\n\n\"I'll put my hand in no man's hand,\" said Mr. Micawber,\ngasping, puffing, and sobbing, to that degree that he was\nlike a man fighting with cold water, \"until I have--blown\nto fragments--the--a--detestable--serpent--HEEP! I'll partake\nof no one's hospitality, until I have--a--moved Mount\nVesuvius--to eruption--on--a--the abandoned rascal--HEEP!\nRefreshment--a--underneath this roof--particularly\npunch--would--a--choak me--unless--I had--previously--choaked\nthe eyes--out of the head--a--of--interminable cheat, and\nliar--HEEP! I--a--I'll know nobody--and--a--say nothing--and--a--live\nnowhere--until I have crushed--to--a--undiscoverable\natoms--the--transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer--HEEP!\"\n\nI really had some fear of Mr. Micawber's dying on the spot. The manner\nin which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences, and,\nwhenever he found himself getting near the name of Heep, fought his way\non to it, dashed at it in a fainting state, and brought it out with a\nvehemence little less than marvellous, was frightful; but now, when he\nsank into a chair, steaming, and looked at us, with every possible color\nin his face that had no business there, and an endless procession of\nlumps following one another in hot haste up his throat, whence they\nseemed to shoot into his forehead, he had the appearance of being in the\nlast extremity. I would have gone to his assistance, but he waved me\noff, and wouldn't hear a word.\n\n\"No, Copperfield!--No communication--a--until--Miss\nWickfield--a--redress from wrongs inflicted by consummate\nscoundrel--HEEP!\" (I am quite convinced he could not have uttered\nthree words, but for the amazing energy with which this word\ninspired him when he felt it coming.) \"Inviolable secret--a--from\nthe whole world--a--no exceptions--this day week--a--at breakfast\ntime--a--everybody present--including aunt--a--and extremely friendly\ngentleman--to be at the hotel at Canterbury--a--where--Mrs. Micawber\nand myself--Auld Lang Syne in chorus--and--a--will expose intolerable\nruffian--HEEP! No more to say--a--or listen to persuasion--go\nimmediately--not capable--a--bear society--upon the track of devoted\nand doomed traitor--HEEP!\"\n\nWith this last repetition of the magic word that had kept him going at\nall, and in which he surpassed all his previous efforts, Mr. Micawber\nrushed out of the house; leaving us in a state of excitement, hope, and\nwonder, that reduced us to a condition little better than his own. But\neven then his passion for writing letters was too strong to be resisted;\nfor while we were yet in the height of our excitement, hope, and wonder,\nthe following pastoral note was brought to me from a neighbouring\ntavern, at which he had called to write it:--\n\n                     \"Most secret and confidential.\n\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\n\n     \"I beg to be allowed to convey, through you, my apologies to\n     your excellent aunt for my late excitement. An explosion of a\n     smouldering volcano long suppressed, was the result of an internal\n     contest more easily conceived than described.\n\n     \"I trust I rendered tolerably intelligible my appointment for the\n     morning of this day week, at the house of public entertainment\n     at Canterbury, where Mrs. Micawber and myself had once the honor\n     of uniting our voices to yours, in the well-known strain of the\n     Immortal exciseman nurtured beyond the Tweed.\n\n     \"The duty done, and act of reparation performed, which can alone\n     enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal, I shall be known no\n     more. I shall simply require to be deposited in that place of\n     universal resort, where\n\n                \"'Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,\n                The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep,'\n\n                          \"--With the plain Inscription,\n                                                   \"WILKINS MICAWBER.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nMR. PEGGOTTY'S DREAM COMES TRUE.\n\n\nBy this time, some months had passed, since our interview on the bank of\nthe river with Martha. I had never seen her since, but she had\ncommunicated with Mr. Peggotty on several occasions. Nothing had come of\nher zealous intervention; nor could I infer, from what he told me, that\nany clue had ever been obtained, for a moment, to Emily's fate. I\nconfess that I began to despair of her recovery, and gradually to sink\ndeeper and deeper into the belief that she was dead.\n\nHis conviction remained unchanged. So far as I know--and I believe his\nhonest heart was transparent to me--he never wavered again, in his\nsolemn certainty of finding her. His patience never tired. And, although\nI trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong\nassurance shivered at a blow, there was something so religious in it, so\naffectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his\nfine nature, that the respect and honor in which I held him were exalted\nevery day.\n\nHis was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped, and did no more. He had been\na man of sturdy action all his life, and he knew that in all things\nwherein he wanted help he must do his own part faithfully, and help\nhimself. I have known him set out in the night, on a misgiving that the\nlight might not be, by some accident, in the window of the old boat, and\nwalk to Yarmouth. I have known him, on reading something in the\nnewspaper that might apply to her, take up his stick, and go forth on a\njourney of three or four score miles. He made his way by sea to Naples,\nand back, after hearing the narrative to which Miss Dartle had assisted\nme. All his journeys were ruggedly performed; for he was always\nsteadfast in a purpose of saving money for Emily's sake, when she should\nbe found. In all this long pursuit, I never heard him repine; I never\nheard him say he was fatigued, or out of heart.\n\nDora had often seen him since our marriage, and was quite fond of him. I\nfancy his figure before me now, standing near her sofa, with his rough\ncap in his hand, and the blue eyes of my child-wife raised, with a timid\nwonder, to his face. Sometimes of an evening, about twilight, when he\ncame to talk with me, I would induce him to smoke his pipe in the\ngarden, as we slowly paced to and fro together; and then, the picture of\nhis deserted home, and the comfortable air it used to have in my\nchildish eyes of an evening when the fire was burning, and the wind\nmoaning round it, came most vividly into my mind.\n\nOne evening, at this hour, he told me that he had found Martha waiting\nnear his lodging on the preceding night when he came out, and that she\nhad asked him not to leave London on any account, until he should have\nseen her again.\n\n\"Did she tell you why?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I asked her, Mas'r Davy,\" he replied, \"but it is but few words as she\never says, and she on'y got my promise and so went away.\"\n\n\"Did she say when you might expect to see her again?\" I demanded.\n\n\"No, Mas'r Davy,\" he returned, drawing his hand thoughtfully down his\nface. \"I asked that too; but it was more (she said) than she could\ntell.\"\n\nAs I had long forborne to encourage him with hopes that hung on threads,\nI made no other comment on this information than that I supposed he\nwould see her soon. Such speculations as it engendered within me I kept\nto myself, and those were faint enough.\n\nI was walking alone in the garden, one evening, about a fortnight\nafterwards. I remember that evening well. It was the second in Mr.\nMicawber's week of suspense. There had been rain all day, and there was\na damp feeling in the air. The leaves were thick upon the trees, and\nheavy with wet; but the rain had ceased, though the sky was still dark;\nand the hopeful birds were singing cheerfully. As I walked to and fro in\nthe garden, and the twilight began to close around me, their little\nvoices were hushed; and that peculiar silence which belongs to such an\nevening in the country when the lightest trees are quite still, save for\nthe occasional droppings from their boughs, prevailed.\n\nThere was a little green perspective of trellis-work and ivy at the side\nof our cottage, through which I could see, from the garden where I was\nwalking, into the road before the house. I happened to turn my eyes\ntowards this place, as I was thinking of many things; and I saw a figure\nbeyond, dressed in a plain cloak. It was bending eagerly towards me, and\nbeckoning.\n\n\"Martha!\" said I, going to it.\n\n\"Can you come with me?\" she inquired, in an agitated whisper. \"I have\nbeen to him, and he is not at home. I wrote down where he was to come,\nand left it on his table with my own hand. They said he would not be out\nlong. I have tidings for him. Can you come directly?\"\n\nMy answer was, to pass out at the gate immediately. She made a hasty\ngesture with her hand, as if to entreat my patience and my silence, and\nturned towards London, whence, as her dress betokened, she had come\nexpeditiously on foot.\n\nI asked her if that were not our destination? On her motioning Yes, with\nthe same hasty gesture as before, I stopped an empty coach that was\ncoming by, and we got into it. When I asked her where the coachman was\nto drive, she answered \"Anywhere near Golden Square! And quick!\"--then\nshrunk into a corner, with one trembling hand before her face, and the\nother making the former gesture, as if she could not bear a voice.\n\nNow much disturbed, and dazzled with conflicting gleams of hope and\ndread, I looked at her for some explanation. But, seeing how strongly\nshe desired to remain quiet, and feeling that it was my own natural\ninclination too, at such a time, I did not attempt to break the silence.\nWe proceeded without a word being spoken. Sometimes she glanced out of\nthe window, as though she thought we were going slowly, though indeed we\nwere going fast; but otherwise remained exactly as at first.\n\nWe alighted at one of the entrances to the Square she had mentioned,\nwhere I directed the coach to wait, not knowing but that we might have\nsome occasion for it. She laid her hand on my arm, and hurried me on to\none of the sombre streets, of which there are several in that part,\nwhere the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single\nfamilies, but have, and had, long degenerated into poor lodgings let off\nin rooms. Entering at the open door of one of these, and releasing my\narm, she beckoned me to follow her up the common staircase, which was\nlike a tributary channel to the street.\n\nThe house swarmed with inmates. As we went up, doors of rooms were\nopened and people's heads put out; and we passed other people on the\nstairs, who were coming down. In glancing up from the outside, before we\nentered, I had seen women and children lolling at the windows over\nflower-pots; and we seemed to have attracted their curiosity, for these\nwere principally the observers who looked out of their doors. It was a\nbroad panelled staircase, with massive balustrades of some dark wood;\ncornices above the doors, ornamented with carved fruit and flowers; and\nbroad seats in the windows. But all these tokens of past grandeur were\nmiserably decayed and dirty; rot, damp, and age, had weakened the\nflooring, which in many places was unsound and even unsafe. Some\nattempts had been made, I noticed, to infuse new blood into this\ndwindling frame, by repairing the costly old wood-work here and there\nwith common deal; but it was like the marriage of a reduced old noble to\na plebeian pauper, and each party to the ill-assorted union shrunk away\nfrom the other. Several of the back windows on the staircase had been\ndarkened or wholly blocked up. In those that remained, there was\nscarcely any glass; and, through the crumbling frames by which the bad\nair seemed always to come in, and never to go out, I saw, through other\nglassless windows, into other houses in a similar condition, and looked\ngiddily down into a wretched yard which was the common dust-heap of the\nmansion.\n\nWe proceeded to the top-story of the house. Two or three times, by the\nway, I thought I observed in the indistinct light the skirts of a female\nfigure going up before us. As we turned to ascend the last flight of\nstairs between us and the roof, we caught a full view of this figure\npausing for a moment, at a door. Then it turned the handle and went in.\n\n\"What's this!\" said Martha, in a whisper. \"She has gone into my room. I\ndon't know her!\"\n\n_I_ knew her. I had recognised her with amazement, for Miss Dartle.\n\nI said something to the effect that it was a lady whom I had seen\nbefore, in a few words, to my conductress; and had scarcely done so,\nwhen we heard her voice in the room, though not, from where we stood,\nwhat she was saying. Martha, with an astonished look, repeated her\nformer action, and softly led me up the stairs; and then, by a little\nback door which seemed to have no lock, and which she pushed open with a\ntouch, into a small empty garret with a low sloping roof: little better\nthan a cupboard. Between this, and the room she had called hers, there\nwas a small door of communication, standing partly open. Here we\nstopped, breathless with our ascent, and she placed her hand lightly on\nmy lips. I could only see, of the room beyond, that it was pretty large;\nthat there was a bed in it; and that there were some common pictures of\nships upon the walls. I could not see Miss Dartle, or the person whom we\nhad heard her address. Certainly, my companion could not, for my\nposition was the best.\n\nA dead silence prevailed for some moments. Martha kept one hand on my\nlips, and raised the other in a listening attitude.\n\n\"It matters little to me her not being at home,\" said Rosa Dartle,\nhaughtily, \"I know nothing of her. It is you I come to see.\"\n\n\"Me?\" replied a soft voice.\n\nAt the sound of it, a thrill went through my frame. For it was Emily's!\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Miss Dartle, \"I have come to look at you. What? You are\nnot ashamed of the face that has done so much?\"\n\nThe resolute and unrelenting hatred of her tone, its cold stern\nsharpness, and its mastered rage, presented her before me, as if I had\nseen her standing in the light. I saw the flashing black eyes, and the\npassion-wasted figure; and I saw the scar, with its white track cutting\nthrough her lips, quivering and throbbing as she spoke.\n\n\"I have come to see,\" she said, \"James Steerforth's fancy; the girl who\nran away with him, and is the town-talk of the commonest people of her\nnative place; the bold, flaunting, practised companion of persons like\nJames Steerforth. I want to know what such a thing is like.\"\n\nThere was a rustle, as if the unhappy girl, on whom she heaped these\ntaunts, ran towards the door, and the speaker swiftly interposed herself\nbefore it. It was succeeded by a moment's pause.\n\nWhen Miss Dartle spoke again, it was through her set teeth, and with a\nstamp upon the ground.\n\n\"Stay there!\" she said, \"or I'll proclaim you to the house, and the\nwhole street! If you try to evade _me_, I'll stop you, if it's by the\nhair, and raise the very stones against you!\"\n\nA frightened murmur was the only reply that reached my ears. A silence\nsucceeded. I did not know what to do. Much as I desired to put an end to\nthe interview, I felt that I had no right to present myself; that it was\nfor Mr. Peggotty alone to see her and recover her. Would he never come?\nI thought impatiently.\n\n\"So!\" said Rosa Dartle, with a contemptuous laugh, \"I see her at last!\nWhy, he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mock-modesty,\nand that hanging head!\"\n\n\"Oh, for Heaven's sake, spare me!\" exclaimed Emily. \"Whoever you are,\nyou know my pitiable story, and for Heaven's sake spare me, if you would\nbe spared yourself!\"\n\n\"If _I_ would be spared!\" returned the other fiercely; \"what is there in\ncommon between _us_, do you think?\"\n\n\"Nothing but our sex,\" said Emily, with a burst of tears.\n\n\"And that,\" said Rosa Dartle, \"is so strong a claim, preferred by one so\ninfamous, that if I had any feeling in my breast but scorn and\nabhorrence of you, it would freeze it up. Our sex! You are an honour to\nour sex!\"\n\n\"I have deserved this,\" cried Emily, \"but it's dreadful! Dear, dear\nlady, think what I have suffered, and how I am fallen! Oh, Martha, come\nback! Oh, home, home!\"\n\nMiss Dartle placed herself in a chair, within view of the door, and\nlooked downward, as if Emily were crouching on the floor before her.\nBeing now between me and the light, I could see her curled lip, and her\ncruel eyes intently fixed on one place, with a greedy triumph.\n\n\"Listen to what I say!\" she said; \"and reserve your false arts for your\ndupes. Do you hope to move _me_ by your tears? No more than you could\ncharm me by your smiles, you purchased slave.\"\n\n\"Oh, have some mercy on me!\" cried Emily. \"Show me some compassion, or I\nshall die mad!\"\n\n\"It would be no great penance,\" said Rosa Dartle, \"for your crimes. Do\nyou know what you have done? Do you ever think of the home you have laid\nwaste?\"\n\n\"Oh, is there ever night or day, when I don't think of it!\" cried Emily;\nand now I could just see her, on her knees, with her head thrown back,\nher pale face looking upward, her hands wildly clasped and held out, and\nher hair streaming about her. \"Has there ever been a single minute,\nwaking or sleeping, when it hasn't been before me, just as it used to be\nin the lost days when I turned my back upon it for ever and for ever!\nOh, home, home! Oh dear, dear uncle, if you ever could have known the\nagony your love would cause me when I fell away from good, you never\nwould have shown it to me so constant, much as you felt it; but would\nhave been angry to me, at least once in my life, that I might have had\nsome comfort! I have none, none, no comfort upon earth, for all of them\nwere always fond of me!\" She dropped on her face, before the imperious\nfigure in the chair, with an imploring effort to clasp the skirt of her\ndress.\n\nRosa Dartle sat looking down upon her, as inflexible as a figure of\nbrass. Her lips were tightly compressed, as if she knew that she\nmust keep a strong constraint upon herself--I write what I sincerely\nbelieve--or she would be tempted to strike the beautiful form with\nher foot. I saw her, distinctly, and the whole power of her face and\ncharacter seemed forced into that expression.--Would he Never come?\n\n\"The miserable vanity of these earth-worms!\" she said, when she had so\nfar controlled the angry heavings of her breast, that she could trust\nherself to speak. \"_Your_ home! Do you imagine that I bestow a thought\non it, or suppose you could do any harm to that low place, which money\nwould not pay for, and handsomely? _Your_ home! You were a part of the\ntrade of your home, and were bought and sold like any other vendible\nthing your people dealt in.\"\n\n\"Oh not that!\" cried Emily. \"Say anything of me; but don't visit my\ndisgrace and shame, more than I have done, on folks who are as honorable\nas you! Have some respect for them, as you are a lady, if you have no\nmercy for me.\"\n\n\"I speak,\" she said, not deigning to take any heed of this appeal,\nand drawing away her dress from the contamination of Emily's touch,\n\"I speak of _his_ home--where I live. Here,\" she said, stretching\nout her hand with her contemptuous laugh, and looking down upon the\nprostrate girl, \"is a worthy cause of division between lady-mother\nand gentleman-son; of grief in a house where she wouldn't have been\nadmitted as a kitchen-girl; of anger, and repining, and reproach. This\npiece of pollution, picked up from the water-side, to be made much of\nfor an hour, and then tossed back to her original place!\"\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Emily, clasping her hands together. \"When he first came\ninto my way--that the day had never dawned upon me, and he had met me\nbeing carried to my grave!--I had been brought up as virtuous as you or\nany lady, and was going to be the wife of as good a man as you or any\nlady in the world can ever marry. If you live in his home and know him,\nyou know, perhaps, what his power with a weak, vain girl might be. I\ndon't defend myself, but I know well, and he knows well, or he will know\nwhen he comes to die, and his mind is troubled with it, that he used all\nhis power to deceive me, and that I believed him, trusted him, and loved\nhim!\"\n\nRosa Dartle sprang up from her seat; recoiled; and in recoiling struck\nat her, with a face of such malignity, so darkened and disfigured by\npassion, that I had almost thrown myself between them. The blow, which\nhad no aim, fell upon the air. As she now stood panting, looking at her\nwith the utmost detestation that she was capable of expressing, and\ntrembling from head to foot with rage and scorn, I thought I had never\nseen such a sight, and never could see such another.\n\n\"_You_ love him? _You?_\" she cried, with her clenched hand, quivering as\nif it only wanted a weapon to stab the object of her wrath.\n\nEmily had shrunk out of my view. There was no reply.\n\n\"And tell that to _me_,\" she added, \"with your shameful lips? Why don't\nthey whip these creatures! If I could order it to be done, I would have\nthis girl whipped to death.\"\n\nAnd so she would, I have no doubt. I would not have trusted her with the\nrack itself, while that furious look lasted.\n\nShe slowly, very slowly, broke into a laugh, and pointed at Emily with\nher hand, as if she were a sight of shame for gods and men.\n\n\"_She_ love!\" she said. \"That carrion! And he ever cared for her, she'd\ntell me? Ha, ha! The liars that these traders are!\"\n\nHer mockery was worse than her undisguised rage. Of the two, I would\nhave much preferred to be the object of the latter. But, when she\nsuffered it to break loose, it was only for a moment. She had chained it\nup again, and however it might tear her within, she subdued it to\nherself.\n\n\"I came here, you pure fountain of love,\" she said, \"to see--as I began\nby telling you--what such a thing as you was like. I was curious. I\nam satisfied. Also to tell you, that you had best seek that home of\nyours, with all speed, and hide your head among those excellent people\nwho are expecting you, and whom your money will console. When it's all\ngone, you can believe, and trust, and love again, you know! I thought\nyou a broken toy that had lasted its time; a worthless spangle that\nwas tarnished, and thrown away. But, finding you true gold, a very\nlady, and an ill-used innocent, with a fresh heart full of love and\ntrustfulness--which you look like, and is quite consistent with your\nstory!--I have something more to say. Attend to it; for what I say I'll\ndo. Do you hear me, you fairy spirit? What I say, I mean to do!\"\n\nHer rage got the better of her again, for a moment; but it passed over\nher face like a spasm, and left her smiling.\n\n\"Hide yourself,\" she pursued, \"if not at home, somewhere. Let it be\nsomewhere beyond reach; in some obscure life--or, better still, in some\nobscure death. I wonder, if your loving heart will not break, you have\nfound no way of helping it to be still! I have heard of such means\nsometimes. I believe they may be easily found.\"\n\nA low crying, on the part of Emily, interrupted her here. She stopped,\nand listened to it as if it were music.\n\n\"I am of a strange nature, perhaps,\" Rosa Dartle went on; \"but I can't\nbreathe freely in the air you breathe. I find it sickly. Therefore, I\nwill have it cleared; I will have it purified of you. If you live here\nto-morrow, I'll have your story and your character proclaimed on the\ncommon stair. There are decent women in the house, I am told; and it is\na pity such a light as you should be among them, and concealed. If,\nleaving here, you seek any refuge in this town in any character but your\ntrue one (which you are welcome to bear, without molestation from me),\nthe same service shall be done you, if I hear of your retreat. Being\nassisted by a gentleman who not long ago aspired to the favor of your\nhand, I am sanguine as to that.\"\n\nWould he never, never come? How long was I to bear this? How long could\nI bear it?\n\n\"Oh me, oh me!\" exclaimed the wretched Emily, in a tone that might have\ntouched the hardest heart, I should have thought; but there was no\nrelenting in Rosa Dartle's smile. \"What, what, shall I do!\"\n\n\"Do?\" returned the other. \"Live happy in your own reflections!\nConsecrate your existence to the recollection of James Steerforth's\ntenderness--he would have made you his serving-man's wife, would he\nnot?--or to feeling grateful to the upright and deserving creature who\nwould have taken you as his gift. Or, if those proud remembrances, and\nthe consciousness of your own virtues, and the honorable position to\nwhich they have raised you in the eyes of everything that wears the\nhuman shape, will not sustain you, marry that good man, and be happy in\nhis condescension. If this will not do either, die! There are doorways\nand dust-heaps for such deaths, and such despair--find one, and take\nyour flight to Heaven!\"\n\nI heard a distant foot upon the stairs. I knew it, I was certain. It was\nhis, thank God!\n\nShe moved slowly from before the door when she said this, and passed out\nof my sight.\n\n\"But mark!\" she added, slowly and sternly, opening the other door to go\naway, \"I am resolved, for reasons that I have and hatreds that I\nentertain, to cast you out, unless you withdraw from my reach\naltogether, or drop your pretty mask. This is what I had to say; and\nwhat I say, I mean to do!\"\n\nThe foot upon the stairs came nearer--nearer--passed her as she went\ndown--rushed into the room!\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\nA fearful cry followed the word. I paused a moment, and looking in, saw\nhim supporting her insensible figure in his arms. He gazed for a few\nseconds in the face; then stooped to kiss it--oh, how tenderly!--and\ndrew a handkerchief before it.\n\n  [Illustration: Mr. Peggotty's dream comes true.]\n\n\"Mas'r Davy,\" he said, in a low tremulous voice, when it was covered, \"I\nthank my Heav'nly Father as my dream's come true! I thank Him hearty for\nhaving guided of me, in His own ways, to my darling!\"\n\nWith those words he took her up in his arms; and, with the veiled face\nlying on his bosom, and addressed towards his own, carried her,\nmotionless and unconscious, down the stairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF A LONGER JOURNEY.\n\n\nIt was yet early in the morning of the following day, when, as I was\nwalking in my garden with my aunt (who took little other exercise now,\nbeing so much in attendance on my dear Dora), I was told that Mr.\nPeggotty desired to speak with me. He came into the garden to meet me\nhalf-way, on my going towards the gate; and bared his head, as it was\nalways his custom to do when he saw my aunt, for whom he had a high\nrespect. I had been telling her all that had happened over-night.\nWithout saying a word, she walked up with a cordial face, shook hands\nwith him, and patted him on the arm. It was so expressively done, that\nshe had no need to say a word. Mr. Peggotty understood her quite as well\nas if she had said a thousand.\n\n\"I'll go in now, Trot,\" said my aunt, \"and look after little Blossom,\nwho will be getting up presently.\"\n\n\"Not along of my being heer, ma'am, I hope?\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Unless\nmy wits is gone a bahd's neezing\"--by which Mr. Peggotty meant to say,\nbird's-nesting--\"this morning, 'tis along of me as you're a going to\nquit us?\"\n\n\"You have something to say, my good friend,\" returned my aunt, \"and will\ndo better without me.\"\n\n\"By your leave, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Peggotty, \"I should take it kind,\npervising you doen't mind my clicketten, if you'd bide heer.\"\n\n\"Would you?\" said my aunt, with short good-nature. \"Then I am sure I\nwill!\"\n\nSo, she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty's, and walked with him to a\nleafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the garden, where\nshe sat down on a bench, and I beside her. There was a seat for Mr.\nPeggotty too, but he preferred to stand, leaning his hand on the small\nrustic table. As he stood, looking at his cap for a little while before\nbeginning to speak, I could not help observing what power and force of\ncharacter his sinewy hand expressed, and what a good and trusty\ncompanion it was to his honest brow and iron-grey hair.\n\n\"I took my dear child away last night,\" Mr. Peggotty began, as he raised\nhis eyes to ours, \"to my lodging, wheer I have a long time been\nexpecting of her and preparing fur her. It was hours afore she knowed me\nright; and when she did, she kneeled down at my feet, and kiender said\nto me, as if it was her prayers, how it all come to be. You may believe\nme, when I heerd her voice, as I had heerd at home so playful--and see\nher humbled, as it might be in the dust our Saviour wrote in with his\nblessed hand--I felt a wownd go to my 'art, in the midst of all its\nthankfulness.\"\n\nHe drew his sleeve across his face, without any pretence of concealing\nwhy; and then cleared his voice.\n\n\"It warn't for long as I felt that; for she was found. I had on'y to\nthink as she was found, and it was gone. I doen't know why I do so much\nas mention of it now, I'm sure. I didn't have it in my mind a minute\nago, to say a word about myself; but it come up so nat'ral, that I\nyielded to it afore I was aweer.\"\n\n\"You are a self-denying soul,\" said my aunt, \"and will have your\nreward.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty, with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart his face,\nmade a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt, as an\nacknowledgment of her good opinion; then, took up the thread he had\nrelinquished.\n\n\"When my Em'ly took flight,\" he said, in stern wrath for the moment,\n\"from the house wheer she was made a pris'ner by that theer spotted\nsnake as Mas'r Davy see,--and his story's trew, and may GOD confound\nhim!--she took flight in the night. It was a dark night, with a many\nstars a shining. She was wild. She ran along the sea beach, believing\nthe old boat was theer; and calling out to us to turn away our faces,\nfor she was a coming by. She heerd herself a crying out, like as if it\nwas another person; and cut herself on them sharp-pinted stones and\nrocks, and felt it no more than if she had been rock herself. Ever so\nfur she run, and there was fire afore her eyes, and roarings in her\nears. Of a sudden--or so she thowt, you unnerstand--the day broke, wet\nand windy, and she was lying b'low a heap of stone upon the shore, and a\nwoman was a speaking to her, saying, in the language of that country,\nwhat was it as had gone so much amiss?\"\n\nHe saw everything he related. It passed before him, as he spoke, so\nvividly, that, in the intensity of his earnestness, he presented what he\ndescribed, to me, with greater distinctness than I can express. I can\nhardly believe, writing now long afterwards, but that I was actually\npresent in these scenes; they are impressed upon me with such an\nastonishing air of fidelity.\n\n\"As Em'ly's eyes--which was heavy--see this woman better,\" Mr. Peggotty\nwent on, \"she know'd as she was one of them as she had often talked to\non the beach. Fur, though she had run (as I have said) ever so fur in\nthe night, she had oftentimes wandered long ways, partly afoot, partly\nin boats and carriages, and know'd all that country, 'long the coast,\nmiles and miles. She hadn't no children of her own, this woman, being a\nyoung wife; but she was a looking to have one afore long. And may my\nprayers go up to Heaven that 'twill be a happ'ness to her, and a\ncomfort, and a honor, all her life! May it love her and be dootiful to\nher, in her old age; helpful of her at the last; a Angel to her heer,\nand heerafter!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said my aunt.\n\n\"She had been summat timorous and down,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"and had\nsat, at first, a little way off, at her spinning, or such work as it\nwas, when Em'ly talked to the children. But Em'ly had took notice of\nher, and had gone and spoke to her; and as the young woman was partial\nto the children herself, they had soon made friends. Sermuchser, that\nwhen Em'ly went that way, she always giv Em'ly flowers. This was her as\nnow asked what it was that had gone so much amiss. Em'ly told her, and\nshe--took her home. She did indeed. She took her home,\" said Mr.\nPeggotty, covering his face.\n\nHe was more affected by this act of kindness, than I had ever seen him\naffected by anything since the night she went away. My aunt and I did\nnot attempt to disturb him.\n\n\"It was a little cottage, you may suppose,\" he said, presently, \"but\nshe found space for Em'ly in it,--her husband was away at sea,--and\nshe kep it secret, and prevailed upon such neighbours as she had (they\nwas not many near) to keep it secret too. Em'ly was took bad with\nfever, and, what is very strange to me is,--maybe 'tis not so strange\nto scholars,--the language of that country went out of her head, and\nshe could only speak her own, that no one unnerstood. She recollects,\nas if she had dreamed it, that she lay there, always a talking her own\ntongue, always believing as the old boat was round the next pint in\nthe bay, and begging and imploring of 'em to send theer and tell how\nshe was dying, and bring back a message of forgiveness, if it was on'y\na wured. A'most the whole time, she thowt,--now, that him as I made\nmention on just now was lurking for her unnerneath the winder: now that\nhim as had brought her to this was in the room,--and cried to the good\nyoung woman not to give her up, and know'd, at the same time, that she\ncouldn't unnerstand, and dreaded that she must be took away. Likewise\nthe fire was afore her eyes, and the roarings in her ears; and there\nwas no to-day, nor yesterday, nor yet to-morrow; but everything in her\nlife as ever had been, or as ever could be, and everything as never\nhad been, and as never could be, was a crowding on her all at once,\nand nothing clear nor welcome, and yet she sang and laughed about it!\nHow long this lasted, I doen't know; but then there come a sleep; and\nin that sleep, from being a many times stronger than her own self, she\nfell into the weakness of the littlest child.\"\n\nHere he stopped, as if for relief from the terrors of his own\ndescription. After being silent for a few moments, he pursued his story.\n\n\"It was a pleasant arternoon when she awoke; and so quiet, that there\nwarn't a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a tide, upon\nthe shore. It was her belief, at first, that she was at home upon a\nSunday morning; but, the vine leaves as she see at the winder, and the\nhills beyond, warn't home, and contradicted of her. Then, come in her\nfriend to watch alongside of her bed; and then she know'd as the old\nboat warn't round that next pint in the bay no more, but was fur off;\nand know'd where she was, and why; and broke out a crying on that good\nyoung woman's bosom, wheer I hope her baby is a lying now, a cheering of\nher with its pretty eyes!\"\n\nHe could not speak of this good friend of Emily's without a flow of\ntears. It was in vain to try. He broke down again, endeavouring to bless\nher!\n\n\"That done my Em'ly good,\" he resumed, after such emotion as I could not\nbehold without sharing in; and as to my aunt, she wept with all her\nheart; \"that done Em'ly good, and she begun to mend. But, the language\nof that country was quite gone from her, and she was forced to make\nsigns. So she went on, getting better from day to day, slow, but sure,\nand trying to learn the names of common things--names as she seemed\nnever to have heerd in all her life--till one evening come, when she was\na setting at her window, looking at a little girl at play upon the\nbeach. And of a sudden this child held out her hand, and said, what\nwould be in English, 'Fisherman's daughter, here's a shell!'--for you\nare to unnerstand that they used at first to call her 'Pretty lady,' as\nthe general way in that country is, and that she had taught 'em to call\nher 'Fisherman's daughter' instead. The child says of a sudden,\n'Fisherman's daughter, here's a shell!' Then Em'ly unnerstands her; and\nshe answers, bursting out a crying; and it all comes back!\n\n\"When Em'ly got strong again,\" said Mr. Peggotty, after another short\ninterval of silence, \"she cast about to leave that good young creetur,\nand get to her own country. The husband was come home, then; and the two\ntogether put her aboard a small trader bound to Leghorn, and from that\nto France. She had a little money, but it was less than little as they\nwould take for all they done. I'm a'most glad on it, though they was so\npoor! What they done, is laid up wheer neither moth nor rust doth\ncorrupt, and wheer thieves do not break through nor steal. Mas'r Davy,\nit'll outlast all the treasure in the wureld.\n\n\"Em'ly got to France, and took service to wait on travelling ladies at a\ninn in the port. Theer, theer come, one day, that snake.--Let him never\ncome nigh me. I doen't know what hurt I might do him!--Soon as she see\nhim, without him seeing her, all her fear and wildness returned upon\nher, and she fled afore the very breath he draw'd. She come to England,\nand was set ashore at Dover.\n\n\"I doen't know,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"for sure, when her 'art begun to\nfail her; but all the way to England she had thowt to come to her dear\nhome. Soon as she got to England she turned her face tow'rds it. But,\nfear of not being forgiv, fear of being pinted at, fear of some of us\nbeing dead along of her, fear of many things, turned her from it,\nkiender by force, upon the road: 'Uncle, uncle,' she says to me, 'the\nfear of not being worthy to do, what my torn and bleeding breast so\nlonged to do, was the most fright'ning fear of all! I turned back, when\nmy 'art was full of prayers that I might crawl to the old doorstep, in\nthe night, kiss it, lay my wicked face upon it, and theer be found dead\nin the morning.'\n\n\"She come,\" said Mr. Peggotty, dropping his voice to an\nawe-stricken whisper, \"to London. She--as had never seen it in her\nlife--alone--without a penny--young--so pretty--come to London.\nA'most the moment as she lighted heer, all so desolate, she found\n(as she believed) a friend; a decent woman as spoke to her about the\nneedle-work as she had been brought up to do, about finding plenty\nof it fur her, about a lodging for the night, and making secret\ninquiration concerning of me and all at home, to-morrow. When my\nchild,\" he said aloud, and with an energy of gratitude that shook him\nfrom head to foot, \"stood upon the brink of more than I can say or\nthink on--Martha, trew to her promise, saved her!\"\n\nI could not repress a cry of joy.\n\n\"Mas'r Davy!\" he said, griping my hand in that strong hand of his, \"it\nwas you as first made mention of her to me. I thankee, sir! She was\narnest. She had know'd of her bitter knowledge wheer to watch and what\nto do. She had done it. And the Lord was above all! She come, white and\nhurried, upon Em'ly in her sleep. She says to her, 'Rise up from worse\nthan death, and come with me!' Them belonging to the house would have\nstopped her, but they might as soon have stopped the sea. 'Stand away\nfrom me,' she says, 'I am a ghost that calls her from beside her open\ngrave!' She told Em'ly she had seen me, and know'd I loved her, and\nforgiv her. She wrapped her, hasty, in her clothes. She took her, faint\nand trembling, on her arm. She heeded no more what they said, than if\nshe had had no ears. She walked among 'em with my child, minding only\nher; and brought her safe out, in the dead of the night, from that black\npit of ruin!\n\n\"She attended on Em'ly,\" said Mr. Peggotty, who had released my hand,\nand put his own hand on his heaving chest; \"she attended to my Em'ly,\nlying wearied out, and wandering betwixt whiles, till late next day.\nThen she went in search of me; then in search of you, Mas'r Davy. She\ndidn't tell Em'ly what she come out fur, lest her 'art should fail, and\nshe should think of hiding of herself. How the cruel lady know'd of her\nbeing theer, I can't say. Whether him as I have spoke so much of,\nchanced to see 'em going theer, or whether (which is most like, to my\nthinking) he had heerd it from the woman, I doen't greatly ask myself.\nMy niece is found.\n\n\"All night long,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"we have been together, Em'ly and\nme. 'Tis little (considering the time) as she has said, in wureds,\nthrough them broken-hearted tears; 'tis less as I have seen of her dear\nface, as grow'd into a woman's at my hearth. But, all night long, her\narms has been about my neck; and her head has laid heer; and we knows\nfull well, as we can put our trust in one another, ever more.\"\n\nHe ceased to speak, and his hand upon the table rested there in perfect\nrepose, with a resolution in it that might have conquered lions.\n\n\"It was a gleam of light upon me, Trot,\" said my aunt, drying her eyes,\n\"when I formed the resolution of being godmother to your sister Betsey\nTrotwood, who disappointed me; but, next to that, hardly anything would\nhave given me greater pleasure, than to be godmother to that good young\ncreature's baby!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty nodded his understanding of my aunt's feelings, but could\nnot trust himself with any verbal reference to the subject of her\ncommendation. We all remained silent, and occupied with our own\nreflections (my aunt drying her eyes, and now sobbing convulsively, and\nnow laughing and calling herself a fool); until I spoke.\n\n\"You have quite made up your mind,\" said I to Mr. Peggotty, \"as to the\nfuture, good friend? I need scarcely ask you.\"\n\n\"Quite, Mas'r Davy,\" he returned; \"and told Em'ly, Theer's mighty\ncountries, fur from heer. Our future life lays over the sea.\"\n\n\"They will emigrate together, aunt,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Mr. Peggotty, with a hopeful smile. \"No one can't reproach\nmy darling in Australia. We will begin a new life over theer!\"\n\nI asked him if he yet proposed to himself any time for going away.\n\n\"I was down at the Docks early this morning, sir,\" he returned, \"to get\ninformation concerning of them ships. In about six weeks or two months\nfrom now, there'll be one sailing--I see her this morning--went aboard--\nand we shall take our passage in her.\"\n\n\"Quite alone?\" I asked.\n\n\"Aye, Mas'r Davy!\" he returned. \"My sister, you see, she's that fond of\nyou and yourn, and that accustomed to think on'y of her own country,\nthat it wouldn't be hardly fair to let her go. Besides which, theer's\none she has in charge, Mas'r Davy, as doen't ought to be forgot.\"\n\n\"Poor Ham!\" said I.\n\n\"My good sister takes care of his house, you see, ma'am, and he takes\nkindly to her,\" Mr. Peggotty explained for my aunt's better information.\n\"He'll set and talk to her, with a calm spirit, wen it's like he\ncouldn't bring himself to open his lips to another. Poor fellow!\" said\nMr. Peggotty, shaking his head, \"theer's not so much left him, that he\ncould spare the little as he has!\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Gummidge?\" said I.\n\n\"Well, I've had a mort of con-sideration, I do tell you,\" returned Mr.\nPeggotty, with a perplexed look which gradually cleared as he went on,\n\"concerning of Missis Gummidge. You see, wen Missis Gummidge falls\na thinking of the old 'un, she an't what you may call good company.\nBetwixt you and me, Mas'r Davy--and you, ma'am--wen Mrs. Gummidge takes\nto wimicking,\"--our old county word for crying,--\"she's liable to be\nconsidered to be, by them as didn't know the old 'un, peevish-like.\nNow I _did_ know the old 'un,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"and I know'd his\nmerits, so I unnerstan' her; but 'tan't entirely so, you see, with\nothers--nat'rally can't be!\"\n\nMy aunt and I both acquiesced.\n\n\"Wheerby,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"my sister might--I doen't say she\nwould, but might--find Missis Gummidge give her a leetle trouble\nnow-and-again. Theerfur 'tan't my intentions to moor Missis Gummidge\n'long with them, but to find a Beein' fur her wheer she can fisherate\nfur herself.\" (A Beein' signifies, in that dialect, a home, and to\nfisherate is to provide.) \"Fur which purpose,\" said Mr. Peggotty,\n\"I means to make her a 'lowance afore I go, as'll leave her pretty\ncomfort'ble. She's the faithfullest of creeturs. 'Tan't to be expected,\nof course, at her time of life, and being lone and lorn, as the good\nold Mawther is to be knocked about aboardship, and in the woods and\nwilds of a new and fur-away country. So that's what I'm a going to do\nwith _her_.\"\n\nHe forgot nobody. He thought of everybody's claims and strivings, but\nhis own.\n\n\"Em'ly,\" he continued, \"will keep along with me--poor child, she's sore\nin need of peace and rest!--until such time as we goes upon our voyage.\nShe'll work at them clothes, as must be made; and I hope her troubles\nwill begin to seem longer ago than they was, wen she finds herself once\nmore by her rough but loving uncle.\"\n\nMy aunt nodded confirmation of this hope, and imparted great\nsatisfaction to Mr. Peggotty.\n\n\"Theer's one thing furder, Mas'r Davy,\" said he, putting his hand in\nhis breast-pocket, and gravely taking out the little paper bundle I\nhad seen before, which he unrolled on the table. \"Theer's these here\nbank-notes--fifty pound, and ten. To them I wish to add the money as\nshe come away with. I've asked her about that (but not saying why), and\nhave added of it up. I an't a scholar. Would you be so kind as see how\n'tis?\"\n\nHe handed me, apologetically for his scholarship, a piece of paper, and\nobserved me while I looked it over. It was quite right.\n\n\"Thankee, sir,\" he said, taking it back. \"This money, if you doen't see\nobjections, Mas'r Davy, I shall put up jest afore I go, in a cover\nd'rected to him; and put that up in another, d'rected to his mother. I\nshall tell her, in no more wureds than I speak to you, what it's the\nprice on; and that I'm gone, and past receiving of it back.\"\n\nI told him that I thought it would be right to do so--that I was\nthoroughly convinced it would be, since he felt it to be right.\n\n\"I said that theer was on'y one thing furder,\" he proceeded with a grave\nsmile, when he had made up his little bundle again, and put it in his\npocket; \"but theer was two. I warn't sure in my mind, wen I come out\nthis morning, as I could go and break to Ham, of my own self, what had\nso thankfully happened. So I writ a letter while I was out, and put it\nin the post-office, telling of 'em how all was as 'tis; and that I\nshould come down to-morrow to unload my mind of what little needs a\ndoing of down theer, and, most-like, take my farewell leave of\nYarmouth.\"\n\n\"And do you wish me to go with you?\" said I, seeing that he left\nsomething unsaid.\n\n\"If you could do me that kind favor, Mas'r Davy,\" he replied, \"I know\nthe sight on you would cheer 'em up a bit.\"\n\nMy little Dora being in good spirits, and very desirous that I should\ngo--as I found on talking it over with her--I readily pledged myself to\naccompany him in accordance with his wish. Next morning, consequently,\nwe were on the Yarmouth coach, and again travelling over the old ground.\n\nAs we passed along the familiar street at night--Mr. Peggotty, in\ndespite of all my remonstrances, carrying my bag--I glanced into Omer\nand Joram's shop, and saw my old friend Mr. Omer there, smoking his\npipe. I felt reluctant to be present, when Mr. Peggotty first met his\nsister and Ham; and made Mr. Omer my excuse for lingering behind.\n\n\"How is Mr. Omer, after this long time?\" said I, going in.\n\nHe fanned away the smoke of his pipe, that he might get a better view of\nme, and soon recognised me with great delight.\n\n\"I should get up, sir, to acknowledge such an honor as this visit,\" said\nhe, \"only my limbs are rather out of sorts, and I am wheeled about. With\nthe exception of my limbs and my breath, hows'ever, I am as hearty as a\nman can be, I'm thankful to say.\"\n\nI congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits, and\nsaw, now, that his easy chair went on wheels.\n\n\"It's an ingenious thing, ain't it?\" he inquired, following the\ndirection of my glance, and polishing the elbow with his arm. \"It runs\nas light as a feather, and tracks as true as a mail-coach. Bless you, my\nlittle Minnie--my grand-daughter you know, Minnie's child--puts her\nlittle strength against the back, gives it a shove, and away we go, as\nclever and merry as ever you see anything! And I tell you what--it's a\nmost uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in.\"\n\nI never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing, and find\nout the enjoyment of it, as Mr. Omer. He was as radiant, as if his\nchair, his asthma, and the failure of his limbs, were the various\nbranches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe.\n\n\"I see more of the world, I can assure you,\" said Mr. Omer, \"in this\nchair, than ever I see out of it. You'd be surprised at the number of\npeople that looks in of a day to have a chat. You really would! There's\ntwice as much in the newspaper, since I've taken to this chair, as there\nused to be. As to general reading, dear me, what a lot of it I do get\nthrough! That's what I feel so strong, you know! If it had been my eyes,\nwhat should I have done? If it had been my ears, what should I have\ndone? Being my limbs, what does it signify? Why, my limbs only made my\nbreath shorter when I used 'em. And now, if I want to go out into the\nstreet or down to the sands, I've only got to call Dick, Joram's\nyoungest 'prentice, and away I go in my own carriage, like the Lord\nMayor of London.\"\n\nHe half suffocated himself with laughing here.\n\n\"Lord bless you!\" said Mr. Omer, resuming his pipe, \"a man must take the\nfat with the lean; that's what he must make up his mind to, in this\nlife. Joram does a fine business. Ex-cellent business!\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear it,\" said I.\n\n\"I knew you would be,\" said Mr. Omer. \"And Joram and Minnie are like\nValentines. What more can a man expect? What's his limbs to _that_!\"\n\nHis supreme contempt for his own limbs, as he sat smoking, was one of\nthe pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered.\n\n\"And since I've took to general reading, you've took to general writing,\neh, sir?\" said Mr. Omer, surveying me admiringly. \"What a lovely work\nthat was of yours! What expressions in it! I read it every word--every\nword. And as to feeling sleepy! Not at all!\"\n\nI laughingly expressed my satisfaction, but I must confess that I\nthought this association of ideas significant.\n\n\"I give you my word and honor, sir,\" said Mr. Omer, \"that when I lay\nthat book upon the table, and look at it outside; compact in three\nseparate and indiwidual wollumes--one, two, three; I am as proud as\nPunch to think that I once had the honor of being connected with your\nfamily. And dear me, it's a long time ago, now, an't it? Over at\nBlunderstone. With a pretty little party laid along with the other\nparty. And you quite a small party then, yourself. Dear, dear!\"\n\nI changed the subject by referring to Emily. After assuring him that I\ndid not forget how interested he had always been in her, and how kindly\nhe had always treated her, I gave him a general account of her\nrestoration to her uncle by the aid of Martha; which I knew would please\nthe old man. He listened with the utmost attention, and said, feelingly,\nwhen I had done:\n\n\"I am rejoiced at it, sir! It's the best news I have heard for many a\nday. Dear, dear, dear! And what's going to be undertook for that\nunfortunate young woman, Martha, now?\"\n\n\"You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since\nyesterday,\" said I, \"but on which I can give you no information yet, Mr.\nOmer. Mr. Peggotty has not alluded to it, and I have a delicacy in doing\nso. I am sure he has not forgotten it. He forgets nothing that is\ndisinterested and good.\"\n\n\"Because you know,\" said Mr. Omer, taking himself up, where he had left\noff, \"whatever _is_ done, I should wish to be a member of. Put me down\nfor anything you may consider right, and let me know. I never could\nthink the girl all bad, and I am glad to find she's not. So will my\ndaughter Minnie be. Young women are contradictory creatures in some\nthings--her mother was just the same as her--but their hearts are soft\nand kind. It's all show with Minnie, about Martha. Why she should\nconsider it necessary to make any show, I don't undertake to tell you.\nBut it's all show, bless you. She'd do her any kindness in private. So,\nput me down for whatever you may consider right, will you be so good?\nand drop me a line where to forward it. Dear me!\" said Mr. Omer, \"when a\nman is drawing on to a time of life, where the two ends of life meet;\nwhen he finds himself, however hearty he is, being wheeled about for the\nsecond time, in a speeches of go-cart; he should be over-rejoiced to do\na kindness if he can. He wants plenty. And I don't speak of myself,\nparticular,\" said Mr. Omer, \"because, sir, the way I look at it is, that\nwe are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill, whatever age we are, on\naccount of time never standing still for a single moment. So let us\nalways do a kindness, and be over-rejoiced. To be sure!\"\n\nHe knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and put it on a ledge in the back\nof his chair, expressly made for its reception.\n\n\"There's Em'ly's cousin, him that she was to have been married to,\" said\nMr. Omer, rubbing his hands feebly, \"as fine a fellow as there is in\nYarmouth! He'll come and talk or read to me, in the evening, for an hour\ntogether sometimes. That's a kindness, I should call it! All his life's\na kindness.\"\n\n\"I am going to see him now,\" said I.\n\n\"Are you?\" said Mr. Omer. \"Tell him I was hearty, and sent my respects.\nMinnie and Joram's at a ball. They would be as proud to see you as I am,\nif they was at home. Minnie won't hardly go out at all, you see, 'on\naccount of father,' as she says. So I swore to-night, that if she didn't\ngo, I'd go to bed at six. In consequence of which,\" Mr. Omer shook\nhimself and his chair, with laughter at the success of his device, \"she\nand Joram's at a ball.\"\n\nI shook hands with him, and wished him good night.\n\n\"Half a minute, sir,\" said Mr. Omer. \"If you was to go without seeing my\nlittle elephant, you'd lose the best of sights. You never see such a\nsight! Minnie!\"\n\nA musical little voice answered, from somewhere upstairs, \"I am coming,\ngrandfather!\" and a pretty little girl with long, flaxen, curling hair,\nsoon came running into the shop.\n\n\"This is my little elephant, sir,\" said Mr. Omer, fondling the child.\n\"Siamese breed, sir. Now, little elephant!\"\n\nThe little elephant set the door of the parlor open, enabling me to see\nthat, in these latter days, it was converted into a bedroom for Mr.\nOmer, who could not be easily conveyed upstairs; and then hid her pretty\nforehead, and tumbled her long hair, against the back of Mr. Omer's\nchair.\n\n\"The elephant butts, you know, sir,\" said Mr. Omer, winking, \"when he\ngoes at a object. Once, elephant. Twice. Three times!\"\n\nAt this signal, the little elephant, with a dexterity that was next to\nmarvellous in so small an animal, whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer\nin it, and rattled it off, pell-mell, into the parlor, without touching\nthe doorpost: Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying the performance, and\nlooking back at me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his\nlife's exertions.\n\nAfter a stroll about the town, I went to Ham's house. Peggotty had now\nremoved here for good; and had let her own house to the successor of Mr.\nBarkis in the carrying business, who had paid her very well for the\ngood-will, cart, and horse. I believe the very same slow horse that Mr.\nBarkis drove, was still at work.\n\nI found them in the neat kitchen, accompanied by Mrs. Gummidge, who had\nbeen fetched from the old boat by Mr. Peggotty himself. I doubt if she\ncould have been induced to desert her post, by any one else. He had\nevidently told them all. Both Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge had their\naprons to their eyes, and Ham had just stepped out \"to take a turn on\nthe beach.\" He presently came home, very glad to see me; and I hope they\nwere all the better for my being there. We spoke, with some approach to\ncheerfulness, of Mr. Peggotty's growing rich in a new country, and of\nthe wonders he would describe in his letters. We said nothing of Emily\nby name, but distantly referred to her more than once. Ham was the\nserenest of the party.\n\nBut, Peggotty told me, when she lighted me to a little chamber where the\nCrocodile book was lying ready for me on the table, that he always was\nthe same. She believed (she told me, crying) that he was broken-hearted;\nthough he was as full of courage as of sweetness, and worked harder and\nbetter than any boat-builder in any yard in all that part. There were\ntimes, she said, of an evening, when he talked of their old life in the\nboat-house; and then he mentioned Emily as a child. But, he never\nmentioned her as a woman.\n\nI thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me\nalone. I therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening, as he\ncame home from his work. Having settled this with myself, I fell asleep.\nThat night, for the first time in all those many nights, the candle was\ntaken out of the window, Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the\nold boat, and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head.\n\nAll next day, he was occupied in disposing of his fishing-boat and\ntackle; in packing up, and sending to London by waggon, such of his\nlittle domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him; and in\nparting with the rest, or bestowing them on Mrs. Gummidge. She was with\nhim all day. As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more,\nbefore it was locked up, I engaged to meet them there in the evening.\nBut I so arranged it, as that I should meet Ham first.\n\nIt was easy to come in his way, as I knew where he worked. I met him at\na retired part of the sands, which I knew he would cross, and turned\nback with him, that he might have leisure to speak to me if he really\nwished. I had not mistaken the expression of his face. We had walked but\na little way together, when he said, without looking at me:\n\n\"Mas'r Davy, have you seen her?\"\n\n\"Only for a moment, when she was in a swoon,\" I softly answered.\n\nWe walked a little farther, and he said:\n\n\"Mas'r Davy, shall you see her, d' ye think?\"\n\n\"It would be too painful to her, perhaps,\" said I.\n\n\"I have thowt of that,\" he replied. \"So 'twould, sir, so 'twould.\"\n\n\"But, Ham,\" said I, gently, \"if there is anything that I could write to\nher, for you, in case I could not tell it; if there is anything you\nwould wish to make known to her through me; I should consider it a\nsacred trust.\"\n\n\"I am sure on't. I thankee, sir, most kind! I think theer is something I\ncould wish said or wrote.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nWe walked a little farther in silence, and then he spoke.\n\n\"'Tan't that I forgive her. 'Tan't that so much. 'Tis more as I beg of\nher to forgive me, for having pressed my affections upon her. Odd times,\nI think that if I hadn't had her promise fur to marry me, sir, she was\nthat trustful of me, in a friendly way, that she'd have told me what was\nstruggling in her mind, and would have counselled with me, and I might\nhave saved her.\"\n\nI pressed his hand. \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Theer's yet a something else,\" he returned, \"if I can say it, Mas'r\nDavy.\"\n\nWe walked on, farther than we had walked yet, before he spoke again. He\nwas not crying when he made the pauses I shall express by lines. He was\nmerely collecting himself to speak very plainly.\n\n\"I loved her--and I love the mem'ry of her--too deep--to be able to\nlead her to believe of my own self as I'm a happy man. I could only be\nhappy--by forgetting of her--and I'm afeerd I couldn't hardly bear as\nshe should be told I done that. But if you, being so full of learning,\nMas'r Davy, could think of anything to say as might bring her to\nbelieve I wasn't greatly hurt: still loving of her, and mourning for\nher: anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my\nlife, and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame, wheer the wicked\ncease from troubling and the weary are at rest--anything as would ease\nher sorrowful mind, and yet not make her think as I could ever marry,\nor as 'twas possible that any one could ever be to me what she was--I\nshould ask of you to say that--with my prayers for her--that was so\ndear.\"\n\nI pressed his manly hand again, and told him I would charge myself to do\nthis as well as I could.\n\n\"I thankee, sir,\" he answered. \"'Twas kind of you to meet me. 'Twas kind\nof you to bear him company down. Mas'r Davy, I unnerstan' very well,\nthough my aunt will come to Lon'on afore they sail, and they'll unite\nonce more, that I am not like to see him agen. I fare to feel sure on't.\nWe doen't say so, but so 'twill be, and better so. The last you see on\nhim--the very last--will you give him the lovingest duty and thanks of\nthe orphan, as he was ever more than a father to?\"\n\nThis I also promised, faithfully.\n\n\"I thankee again, sir,\" he said, heartily shaking hands. \"I know wheer\nyou're a going. Good bye!\"\n\nWith a slight wave of his hand, as though to explain to me that he could\nnot enter the old place, he turned away. As I looked after his figure,\ncrossing the waste in the moonlight, I saw him turn his face towards a\nstrip of silvery light upon the sea, and pass on, looking at it, until\nhe was a shadow in the distance.\n\nThe door of the boat-house stood open when I approached; and, on\nentering, I found it emptied of all its furniture, saving one of the old\nlockers, on which Mrs. Gummidge, with a basket on her knee, was seated,\nlooking at Mr. Peggotty. He leaned his elbow on the rough chimney-piece,\nand gazed upon a few expiring embers in the grate; but he raised his\nhead, hopefully, on my coming in, and spoke in a cheery manner.\n\n\"Come, according to promise, to bid farewell to 't, eh, Mas'r Davy!\" he\nsaid, taking up the candle. \"Bare enough now, an't it?\"\n\n\"Indeed you have made good use of the time,\" said I.\n\n\"Why we have not been idle, sir. Missis Gummidge has worked like a--I\ndoen't know what Missis Gummidge ain't worked like,\" said Mr. Peggotty,\nlooking at her, at a loss for a sufficiently-approving simile.\n\nMrs. Gummidge, leaning on her basket, made no observation.\n\n\"Theer's the very locker that you used to sit on, 'long with Em'ly!\"\nsaid Mr. Peggotty, in a whisper. \"I'm a going to carry it away with me,\nlast of all. And heer's your old little bedroom, see, Mas'r Davy! A'most\nas bleak to-night, as 'art could wish!\"\n\nIn truth, the wind, though it was low, had a solemn sound, and crept\naround the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was very\nmournful. Everything was gone, down to the little mirror with the\noyster-shell frame. I thought of myself, lying here, when that first\ngreat change was being wrought at home. I thought of the blue-eyed child\nwho had enchanted me. I thought of Steerforth: and a foolish, fearful\nfancy came upon me of his being near at hand, and liable to be met at\nany turn.\n\n\"'Tis like to be long,\" said Mr. Peggotty, in a low voice, \"afore the\nboat finds new tenants. They look upon 't, down heer, as being\nunfort'nate now!\"\n\n\"Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?\" I asked.\n\n\"To a mast-maker up town,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"I'm a going to give the\nkey to him to-night.\"\n\nWe looked into the other little room, and came back to Mrs. Gummidge,\nsitting on the locker, whom Mr. Peggotty, putting the light on the\nchimney-piece, requested to rise, that he might carry it outside the\ndoor before extinguishing the candle.\n\n\"Dan'l,\" said Mrs. Gummidge, suddenly deserting her basket, and clinging\nto his arm, \"my dear Dan'l, the parting words I speak in this house is,\nI mustn't be left behind. Doen't ye think of leaving me behind, Dan'l!\nOh, doen't ye ever do it!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty, taken aback, looked from Mrs. Gummidge to me, and from me\nto Mrs. Gummidge, as if he had been awakened from a sleep.\n\n\"Doen't ye, dearest Dan'l, doen't ye!\" cried Mrs. Gummidge, fervently.\n\"Take me 'long with you, Dan'l, take me 'long with you and Em'ly! I'll\nbe your servant, constant and trew. If there's slaves in them parts\nwhere you're a going, I'll be bound to you for one, and happy, but\ndoen't ye leave me behind, Dan'l, that's a deary dear!\"\n\n\"My good soul,\" said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, \"you doen't know\nwhat a long voyage, and what a hard life 'tis!\"\n\n\"Yes I do, Dan'l! I can guess!\" cried Mrs. Gummidge. \"But my parting\nwords under this roof is, I shall go into the house and die, if I am not\ntook. I can dig, Dan'l. I can work. I can live hard. I can be loving and\npatient now--more than you think, Dan'l, if you'll on'y try me. I\nwouldn't touch the 'lowance, not if I was dying of want, Dan'l Peggotty;\nbut I'll go with you and Em'ly, if you'll on'y let me, to the world's\nend! I know how 'tis; I know you think that I am lone and lorn; but,\ndeary love, 'tan't so no more! I an't sat here, so long, a watching, and\na thinking of your trials, without some good being done me. Mas'r Davy,\nspeak to him for me! I knows his ways, and Em'ly's, and I knows their\nsorrows, and can be a comfort to 'em, some odd times, and labor for 'em\nallus! Dan'l, deary Dan'l, let me go 'long with you!\"\n\nAnd Mrs. Gummidge took his hand, and kissed it with a homely pathos and\naffection, in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude, that he well\ndeserved.\n\nWe brought the locker out, extinguished the candle, fastened the door on\nthe outside, and left the old boat close shut up, a dark speck in the\ncloudy night. Next day, when we were returning to London outside the\ncoach, Mrs. Gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind, and Mrs.\nGummidge was happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nI ASSIST AT AN EXPLOSION.\n\n\nWhen the time Mr. Micawber had appointed so mysteriously, was within\nfour-and-twenty hours of being come, my aunt and I consulted how we\nshould proceed; for my aunt was very unwilling to leave Dora. Ah! how\neasily I carried Dora up and down stairs, now!\n\nWe were disposed, notwithstanding Mr. Micawber's stipulation for my\naunt's attendance, to arrange that she should stay at home, and be\nrepresented by Mr. Dick and me. In short, we had resolved to take this\ncourse, when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would\nforgive herself, and never would forgive her bad boy, if my aunt\nremained behind, on any pretence.\n\n\"I won't speak to you,\" said Dora, shaking her curls at my aunt. \"I'll\nbe disagreeable! I'll make Jip bark at you all day. I shall be sure that\nyou really are a cross old thing, if you don't go!\"\n\n\"Tut, Blossom!\" laughed my aunt. \"You know you can't do without me!\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" said Dora. \"You are no use to me at all. You never run up\nand down stairs for me, all day long. You never sit and tell me stories\nabout Doady, when his shoes were worn out, and he was covered with\ndust--oh, what a poor little mite of a fellow! You never do anything\nat all to please me, do you, dear?\" Dora made haste to kiss my aunt,\nand say, \"Yes, you do! I'm only joking!\"--lest my aunt should think she\nreally meant it.\n\n\"But, aunt,\" said Dora, coaxingly, \"now listen. You must go. I shall\ntease you, 'till you let me have my own way about it. I shall lead my\nnaughty boy _such_ a life, if he don't make you go. I shall make myself\n_so_ disagreeable--and so will Jip! You'll wish you had gone, like a\ngood thing, for ever and ever so long, if you don't go. Besides,\" said\nDora, putting back her hair, and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me,\n\"why shouldn't you both go? I am not very ill indeed. Am I?\"\n\n\"Why, what a question!\" cried my aunt.\n\n\"What a fancy!\" said I.\n\n\"Yes! I know I am a silly little thing!\" said Dora, slowly looking from\none of us to the other, and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us\nas she lay upon her couch. \"Well, then, you must both go, or I shall not\nbelieve you; and then I shall cry!\"\n\nI saw, in my aunt's face, that she began to give way now, and Dora\nbrightened again, as she saw it too.\n\n\"You'll come back with so much to tell me, that it'll take at least a\nweek to make me understand!\" said Dora. \"Because I _know_ I sha'n't\nunderstand, for a length of time, if there's any business in it. And\nthere's sure to be some business in it! If there's any thing to add up,\nbesides, I don't know when I shall make it out; and my bad boy will look\n_so_ miserable all the time. There! Now you'll go, won't you? You'll\nonly be gone one night, and Jip will take care of me while you are gone.\nDoady will carry me up stairs before you go, and I won't come down again\ntill you come back; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding\nletter from me, because she has never been to see us!\"\n\nWe agreed, without any more consultation, that we would both go, and\nthat Dora was a little Impostor, who feigned to be rather unwell,\nbecause she liked to be petted. She was greatly pleased, and very merry;\nand we four, that is to say, my aunt, Mr. Dick, Traddles, and I, went\ndown to Canterbury by the Dover mail that night.\n\nAt the hotel where Mr. Micawber had requested us to await him, which we\ngot into, with some trouble, in the middle of the night, I found a\nletter, importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at\nhalf-past nine. After which, we went shivering, at that uncomfortable\nhour, to our respective beds, through various close passages; which\nsmelt as if they had been steeped, for ages, in a solution of soup and\nstables.\n\nEarly in the morning, I sauntered through the dear old tranquil streets,\nand again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways and\nchurches. The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers; and the\ntowers themselves, overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich\ncountry and its pleasant streams, were cutting the bright morning air,\nas if there were no such thing as change on earth. Yet the bells, when\nthey sounded, told me sorrowfully of change in everything; told me of\ntheir own age, and my pretty Dora's youth; and of the many, never old,\nwho had lived and loved and died, while the reverberations of the bells\nhad hummed through the rusty armour of the Black Prince hanging up\nwithin, and, motes upon the deep of Time, had lost themselves in air, as\ncircles do in water.\n\nI looked at the old house from the corner of the street, but did not go\nnearer to it, lest, being observed, I might unwittingly do any harm to\nthe design I had come to aid. The early sun was striking edgewise on its\ngables and lattice-windows, touching them with gold; and some beams of\nits old peace seemed to touch my heart.\n\nI strolled into the country for an hour or so, and then returned by the\nmain street, which in the interval had shaken off its last night's\nsleep. Among those who were stirring in the shops, I saw my ancient\nenemy the butcher, now advanced to top-boots and a baby, and in business\nfor himself. He was nursing the baby, and appeared to be a benignant\nmember of society.\n\nWe all became very anxious and impatient, when we sat down to breakfast.\nAs it approached nearer and nearer to half-past nine o'clock, our\nrestless expectation of Mr. Micawber increased. At last we made no more\npretence of attending to the meal, which, except with Mr. Dick, had been\na mere form from the first; but my aunt walked up and down the room,\nTraddles sat upon the sofa affecting to read the paper with his eyes on\nthe ceiling; and I looked out of the window to give early notice of Mr.\nMicawber's coming. Nor had I long to watch, for, at the first chime of\nthe half hour, he appeared in the street.\n\n\"Here he is,\" said I, \"and not in his legal attire!\"\n\nMy aunt tied the strings of her bonnet (she had come down to breakfast\nin it), and put on her shawl, as if she were ready for anything that was\nresolute and uncompromising. Traddles buttoned his coat with a\ndetermined air. Mr. Dick, disturbed by these formidable appearances, but\nfeeling it necessary to imitate them, pulled his hat, with both hands,\nas firmly over his ears as he possibly could; and instantly took it off\nagain, to welcome Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"Gentlemen, and madam,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"good morning! My dear sir,\"\nto Mr. Dick, who shook hands with him violently, \"you are extremely\ngood.\"\n\n\"Have you breakfasted?\" said Mr. Dick. \"Have a chop!\"\n\n\"Not for the world, my good sir!\" cried Mr. Micawber, stopping him on\nhis way to the bell; \"appetite and myself, Mr. Dixon, have long been\nstrangers.\"\n\nMr. Dixon was so pleased with his new name, and appeared to think it so\nvery obliging in Mr. Micawber to confer it upon him, that he shook hands\nwith him again, and laughed rather childishly.\n\n\"Dick,\" said my aunt, \"attention!\"\n\nMr. Dick recovered himself, with a blush.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said my aunt to Mr. Micawber, as she put on her gloves, \"we\nare ready for Mount Vesuvius, or anything else, as soon as _you_\nplease.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"I trust you will shortly witness an\neruption. Mr. Traddles, I have your permission, I believe, to mention\nhere that we have been in communication together?\"\n\n\"It is undoubtedly the fact, Copperfield,\" said Traddles, to whom I\nlooked in surprise. \"Mr. Micawber has consulted me, in reference to what\nhe has in contemplation; and I have advised him to the best of my\njudgment.\"\n\n\"Unless I deceive myself, Mr. Traddles,\" pursued Mr. Micawber, \"what I\ncontemplate is a disclosure of an important nature.\"\n\n\"Highly so,\" said Traddles.\n\n\"Perhaps, under such circumstances, madam and gentlemen,\" said Mr.\nMicawber, \"you will do me the favor to submit yourselves, for the\nmoment, to the direction of one, who, however unworthy to be regarded in\nany other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore of human nature,\nis still your fellow man, though crushed out of his original form by\nindividual errors, and the accumulative force of a combination of\ncircumstances?\"\n\n\"We have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Micawber,\" said I, \"and will do\nwhat you please.\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"your confidence is not, at\nthe existing juncture, ill-bestowed. I would beg to be allowed a start\nof five minutes by the clock; and then to receive the present company,\ninquiring for Miss Wickfield, at the office of Wickfield and Heep, whose\nStipendiary I am.\"\n\nMy aunt and I looked at Traddles, who nodded his approval.\n\n\"I have no more,\" observed Mr. Micawber, \"to say at present.\"\n\nWith which, to my infinite surprise, he included us all in a\ncomprehensive bow, and disappeared; his manner being extremely distant,\nand his face extremely pale.\n\nTraddles only smiled, and shook his head (with his hair standing upright\non the top of it), when I looked to him for an explanation; so I took\nout my watch, and, as a last resource, counted off the five minutes. My\naunt, with her own watch in her hand, did the like. When the time was\nexpired, Traddles gave her his arm; and we all went out together to the\nold house, without saying one word on the way.\n\nWe found Mr. Micawber at his desk, in the turret office on the\nground floor, either writing, or pretending to write, hard. The\nlarge office-ruler was stuck into his waistcoat, and was not so well\nconcealed but that a foot or more of that instrument protruded from his\nbosom, like a new kind of shirt-frill.\n\nAs it appeared to me that I was expected to speak, I said aloud:\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Micawber?\"\n\n\"Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mr. Micawber, gravely, \"I hope I see you well?\"\n\n\"Is Miss Wickfield at home?\" said I.\n\n\"Mr. Wickfield is unwell in bed, sir, of a rheumatic fever,\" he\nreturned; \"but Miss Wickfield, I have no doubt, will be happy to see old\nfriends. Will you walk in, sir?\"\n\nHe preceded us to the dining-room--the first room I had entered in that\nhouse--and flinging open the door of Mr. Wickfield's former office,\nsaid, in a sonorous voice:\n\n\"Miss Trotwood, Mr. David Copperfield, Mr. Thomas Traddles, and Mr.\nDixon!\"\n\nI had not seen Uriah Heep since the time of the blow. Our visit\nastonished him, evidently; not the less, I dare say, because it\nastonished ourselves. He did not gather his eyebrows together, for he\nhad none worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that he almost\nclosed his small eyes, while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to\nhis chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise. This was only when we\nwere in the act of entering his room, and when I caught a glance at him\nover my aunt's shoulder. A moment afterwards, he was as fawning and as\nhumble as ever.\n\n\"Well, I am sure,\" he said. \"This is indeed an unexpected pleasure! To\nhave, as I may say, all friends round Saint Paul's, at once, is a treat\nunlooked for! Mr. Copperfield, I hope I see you well, and--if I may\numbly express self so--friendly towards them as is ever your friends,\nwhether or not. Mrs. Copperfield, sir, I hope she's getting on. We have\nbeen made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state,\nlately, I do assure you.\"\n\nI felt ashamed to let him take my hand, but I did not know yet what else\nto do.\n\n\"Things are changed in this office, Miss Trotwood, since I was a numble\nclerk, and held your pony; ain't they?\" said Uriah, with his sickliest\nsmile. \"But _I_ am not changed, Miss Trotwood.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returned my aunt, \"to tell you the truth, I think you are\npretty constant to the promise of your youth; if that's any satisfaction\nto you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Trotwood,\" said Uriah, writhing in his ungainly manner,\n\"for your good opinion! Micawber, tell 'em to let Miss Agnes know--and\nmother. Mother will be quite in a state, when she sees the present\ncompany!\" said Uriah, setting chairs.\n\n\"You are not busy, Mr. Heep?\" said Traddles, whose eye the cunning red\neye accidentally caught, as it at once scrutinised and evaded us.\n\n\"No, Mr. Traddles,\" replied Uriah, resuming his official seat, and\nsqueezing his bony hands, laid palm to palm, between his bony knees.\n\"Not so much so, as I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, and leeches, are\nnot easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself and Micawber have\nour hands pretty full, in general, on account of Mr. Wickfield's being\nhardly fit for any occupation, sir. But it's a pleasure as well as a\nduty, I am sure, to work for _him_. You've not been intimate with Mr.\nWickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe I've only had the honor of\nseeing you once myself?\"\n\n\"No, I have not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield,\" returned Traddles;\n\"or I might perhaps have waited on you long ago, Mr. Heep.\"\n\nThere was something in the tone of this reply, which made Uriah look at\nthe speaker again, with a very sinister and suspicious expression. But,\nseeing only Traddles with his good-natured face, simple manner, and hair\non end, he dismissed it as he replied, with a jerk of his whole body,\nbut especially his throat:\n\n\"I am sorry for that, Mr. Traddles. You would have admired him as much\nas we all do. His little failings would only have endeared him to you\nthe more. But if you would like to hear my fellow-partner eloquently\nspoken of, I should refer you to Copperfield. The family is a subject\nhe's very strong upon, if you never heard him.\"\n\nI was prevented from disclaiming the compliment (if I should have done\nso, in any case), by the entrance of Agnes, now ushered in by Mr.\nMicawber. She was not quite so self-possessed as usual, I thought; and\nhad evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue. But her earnest cordiality,\nand her quiet beauty, shone with the gentler lustre for it.\n\nI saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us; and he reminded me of an\nugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit. In the meanwhile, some\nslight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles,\nunobserved except by me, went out.\n\n\"Don't wait, Micawber,\" said Uriah.\n\nMr. Micawber, with his hand upon the ruler in his breast, stood erect\nbefore the door, most unmistakeably contemplating one of his fellow-men,\nand that man his employer.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" said Uriah. \"Micawber! Did you hear me tell\nyou not to wait?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" replied the immovable Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"Then why _do_ you wait?\" said Uriah.\n\n\"Because I--in short choose,\" replied Mr. Micawber, with a burst.\n\nUriah's cheeks lost colour, and an unwholesome paleness, still faintly\ntinged by his pervading red, overspread them. He looked at Mr. Micawber\nattentively, with his whole face breathing short and quick in every\nfeature.\n\n\"You are a dissipated fellow, as all the world knows,\" he said, with an\neffort at a smile, \"and I am afraid you'll oblige me to get rid of you.\nGo along! I'll talk to you presently.\"\n\n\"If there is a scoundrel on this earth,\" said Mr. Micawber, suddenly\nbreaking out again with the utmost vehemence, \"with whom I have already\ntalked too much, that scoundrel's name is--HEEP!\"\n\nUriah fell back, as if he had been struck or stung. Looking slowly round\nupon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face could\nwear, he said, in a lower voice:\n\n\"Oho! This is a conspiracy! You have met here, by appointment! You are\nplaying Booty with my clerk, are you, Copperfield? Now, take care.\nYou'll make nothing of this. We understand each other, you and me.\nThere's no love between us. You were always a puppy with a proud\nstomach, from your first coming here; and you envy me my rise, do you?\nNone of your plots against me; I'll counterplot you! Micawber, you be\noff. I'll talk to you presently.\"\n\n\"Mr. Micawber,\" said I, \"there is a sudden change in this fellow, in\nmore respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the truth in\none particular, which assures me that he is brought to bay. Deal with\nhim as he deserves!\"\n\n\"You are a precious set of people, ain't you?\" said Uriah, in the same\nlow voice, and breaking out into a clammy heat, which he wiped from his\nforehead, with his long lean hand, \"to buy over my clerk, who is the\nvery scum of society,--as you yourself were, Copperfield, you know it,\nbefore anyone had charity on you,--to defame me with his lies? Miss\nTrotwood, you had better stop this; or I'll stop your husband shorter\nthan will be pleasant to you. I won't know your story professionally,\nfor nothing, old lady! Miss Wickfield, if you have any love for your\nfather, you had better not join that gang. I'll ruin him, if you do.\nNow, come! I have got some of you under the harrow. Think twice, before\nit goes over you. Think twice, you, Micawber, if you don't want to be\ncrushed. I recommend you to take yourself off, and be talked to\npresently, you fool! while there's time to retreat. Where's mother!\" he\nsaid, suddenly appearing to notice, with alarm, the absence of Traddles,\nand pulling down the bell-rope. \"Fine doings in a person's own house!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Heep is here, sir,\" said Traddles, returning with that worthy\nmother of a worthy son. \"I have taken the liberty of making myself known\nto her.\"\n\n\"Who are you to make yourself known?\" retorted Uriah. \"And what do you\nwant here?\"\n\n\"I am the agent and friend of Mr. Wickfield, sir,\" said Traddles, in a\ncomposed business-like way. \"And I have a power of attorney from him in\nmy pocket, to act for him in all matters.\"\n\n\"The old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage,\" said Uriah,\nturning uglier than before, \"and it has been got from him by fraud!\"\n\n\"Something has been got from him by fraud, I know,\" returned Traddles\nquietly; \"and so do you, Mr. Heep. We will refer that question, if you\nplease, to Mr. Micawber.\"\n\n\"Ury--!\" Mrs. Heep began, with an anxious gesture.\n\n\"You hold your tongue, mother,\" he returned; \"least said, soonest\nmended.\"\n\n\"But my Ury--.\"\n\n\"Will you hold your tongue, mother, and leave it to me?\"\n\nThough I had long known that his servility was false, and all his\npretences knavish and hollow, I had had no adequate conception of the\nextent of his hypocrisy, until I now saw him with his mask off. The\nsuddenness with which he dropped it, when he perceived that it was\nuseless to him; the malice, insolence, and hatred, he revealed; the leer\nwith which he exulted, even at this moment, in the evil he had done--all\nthis time being desperate too, and at his wits' end for the means of\ngetting the better of us--though perfectly consistent with the\nexperience I had of him, at first took even me by surprise, who had\nknown him so long, and disliked him so heartily.\n\nI say nothing of the look he conferred on me, as he stood eyeing us, one\nafter another; for I had always understood that he hated me, and I\nremembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek. But when his eyes passed\non to Agnes, and I saw the rage with which he felt his power over her\nslipping away, and the exhibition, in their disappointment, of the\nodious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could\nnever appreciate or care for, I was shocked by the mere thought of her\nhaving lived, an hour, within sight of such a man.\n\nAfter some rubbing of the lower part of his face, and some looking at us\nwith those bad eyes, over his grisly fingers, he made one more address\nto me, half whining, and half abusive.\n\n\"You think it justifiable, do you, Copperfield, you who pride yourself\nso much on your honor and all the rest of it, to sneak about my place,\neaves-dropping with my clerk? If it had been _me_, I shouldn't have\nwondered; for I don't make myself out a gentleman (though I never\nwas in the streets either, as you were, according to Micawber), but\nbeing _you_!--And you're not afraid of doing this, either? You don't\nthink at all of what I shall do, in return; or of getting yourself\ninto trouble for conspiracy and so forth? Very well. We shall see! Mr.\nWhat's-your-name, you were going to refer some question to Micawber.\nThere's your referee. Why don't you make him speak? He has learnt his\nlesson, I see.\"\n\nSeeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us, he sat on the\nedge of his table with his hands in his pockets, and one of his splay\nfeet twisted round the other leg, waiting doggedly for what might\nfollow.\n\nMr. Micawber, whose impetuosity I had restrained thus far with the\ngreatest difficulty, and who had repeatedly interposed with the first\nsyllable of SCOUN-drel! without getting to the second, now burst\nforward, drew the ruler from his breast (apparently as a defensive\nweapon), and produced from his pocket a foolscap document, folded in the\nform of a large letter. Opening this packet, with his old flourish, and\nglancing at the contents, as if he cherished an artistic admiration of\ntheir style of composition, he began to read as follows:\n\n\"'Dear Miss Trotwood and gentlemen----'\"\n\n\"Bless and save the man!\" exclaimed my aunt in a low voice. \"He'd write\nletters by the ream, if it was a capital offence!\"\n\nMr. Micawber, without hearing her, went on.\n\n\"'In appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate\nVillain that has ever existed,'\" Mr. Micawber, without looking off the\nletter, pointed the ruler, like a ghostly truncheon, at Uriah Heep, \"'I\nask no consideration for myself. The victim, from my cradle, of\npecuniary liabilities to which I have been unable to respond, I have\never been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances. Ignominy, Want,\nDespair, and Madness, have, collectively or separately, been the\nattendants of my career.'\"\n\nThe relish with which Mr. Micawber described himself, as a prey to these\ndismal calamities, was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he\nread his letter; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of\nhis head, when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed.\n\n\"'In an accumulation of Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Madness, I entered\nthe office--or, as our lively neighbour the Gaul would term it, the\nBureau--of the Firm, nominally conducted under the appellation of\nWickfield and--HEEP, but, in reality, wielded by--HEEP alone. HEEP, and\nonly HEEP, is the mainspring of that machine. HEEP, and only HEEP, is\nthe Forger and the Cheat.'\"\n\nUriah, more blue than white at these words, made a dart at the letter,\nas if to tear it in pieces. Mr. Micawber, with a perfect miracle of\ndexterity or luck, caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler, and\ndisabled his right hand. It dropped at the wrist, as if it were broken.\nThe blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood.\n\n\"The Devil take you!\" said Uriah, writhing in a new way with pain. \"I'll\nbe even with you.\"\n\n\"Approach me again, you--you--you HEEP of infamy,\" gasped Mr. Micawber,\n\"and if your head is human, I'll break it. Come on, come on!\"\n\nI think I never saw anything more ridiculous--I was sensible of it, even\nat the time--than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with the ruler,\nand crying \"Come on!\" while Traddles and I pushed him back into a\ncorner, from which, as often as we got him into it, he persisted in\nemerging again.\n\nHis enemy, muttering to himself, after wringing his wounded hand for\nsome time, slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up; then, held\nit in his other hand, and sat upon his table with his sullen face\nlooking down.\n\nMr. Micawber, when he was sufficiently cool, proceeded with his letter.\n\n\"'The stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which I entered into\nthe service of--HEEP,'\" always pausing before that word, and uttering it\nwith astonishing vigor, \"'were not defined, beyond the pittance of\ntwenty-two shillings and six per week. The rest was left contingent on\nthe value of my professional exertions; in other and more expressive\nwords, on the baseness of my nature, the cupidity of my motives, the\npoverty of my family, the general moral (or rather immoral) resemblance\nbetween myself and--HEEP. Need I say, that it soon became necessary for\nme to solicit from--HEEP--pecuniary advances towards the support of Mrs.\nMicawber, and our blighted but rising family! Need I say that this\nnecessity had been foreseen by--HEEP? That those advances were secured\nby I. O. U.'s and other similar acknowledgments, known to the legal\ninstitutions of this country. And that I thus became immeshed in the web\nhe had spun for my reception?'\"\n\nMr. Micawber's enjoyment of his epistolary powers, in describing this\nunfortunate state of things, really seemed to outweigh any pain or\nanxiety that the reality could have caused him. He read on:\n\n\"'Then it was that--HEEP--began to favor me with just so much of his\nconfidence, as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business.\nThen it was that I began, if I may so Shakespearianly express myself, to\ndwindle, peak, and pine. I found that my services were constantly called\ninto requisition for the falsification of business, and the\nmystification of an individual whom I will designate as Mr. W. That Mr.\nW. was imposed upon, kept in ignorance, and deluded, in every possible\nway; yet, that all this while, the ruffian--HEEP--was professing\nunbounded gratitude to, and unbounded friendship for, that much abused\ngentleman. This was bad enough; but, as the philosophic Dane observes,\nwith that universal applicability which distinguishes the illustrious\nornament of the Elizabethian Era, worse remains behind!'\"\n\nMr. Micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off with a\nquotation, that he indulged himself, and us, with a second reading of\nthe sentence, under pretence of having lost his place.\n\n\"'It is not my intention,'\" he continued, reading on, \"'to enter on a\ndetailed list, within the compass of the present epistle (though it is\nready elsewhere), of the various malpractices of a minor nature,\naffecting the individual whom I have denominated Mr. W., to which I have\nbeen a tacitly consenting party. My object, when the contest within\nmyself between stipend and no stipend, baker and no baker, existence and\nnon-existence, ceased, was to take advantage of my opportunities to\ndiscover and expose the major malpractices committed, to that\ngentleman's grievous wrong and injury, by--HEEP. Stimulated by the\nsilent monitor within, and by a no less touching and appealing monitor\nwithout--to whom I will briefly refer as Miss W.--I entered on a not\nunlaborious task of clandestine investigation, protracted now, to the\nbest of my knowledge, information, and belief, over a period exceeding\ntwelve calendar months.'\"\n\nHe read this passage, as if it were from an Act of Parliament; and\nappeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words.\n\n\"'My charges against--HEEP,'\" he read on, glancing at him, and drawing\nthe ruler into a convenient position under his left arm, in case of\nneed, \"'are as follows.'\"\n\nWe all held our breath, I think. I am sure Uriah held his.\n\n\"'First,'\" said Mr. Micawber. \"'When Mr. W.'s faculties and memory for\nbusiness became, through causes into which it is not necessary or\nexpedient for me to enter, weakened and confused,--HEEP--designedly\nperplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions. When\nMr. W. was least fit to enter on business,--HEEP--was always at hand to\nforce him to enter on it. He obtained Mr. W.'s signature under such\ncircumstances to documents of importance, representing them to be other\ndocuments of no importance. He induced Mr. W. to empower him to draw\nout, thus, one particular sum of trust-money, amounting to twelve six\nfourteen, two, and nine, and employed it to meet pretended business\ncharges and deficiencies which were either already provided for, or had\nnever really existed. He gave this proceeding, throughout, the\nappearance of having originated in Mr. W.'s own dishonest intention, and\nof having been accomplished by Mr. W.'s own dishonest act; and has used\nit, ever since, to torture and constrain him.'\"\n\n\"You shall prove this, you Copperfield!\" said Uriah, with a threatening\nshake of the head. \"All in good time!\"\n\n\"Ask--HEEP--Mr. Traddles, who lived in his house after him,\" said Mr.\nMicawber, breaking off from the letter; \"will you?\"\n\n\"The fool himself--and lives there now,\" said Uriah, disdainfully.\n\n\"Ask--HEEP--if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house,\" said Mr.\nMicawber; \"will you?\"\n\nI saw Uriah's lank hand stop, involuntarily, in the scraping of his\nchin.\n\n\"Or ask him,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"if he ever burnt one there. If he says\nyes, and asks you where the ashes are, refer him to Wilkins Micawber,\nand he will hear of something not at all to his advantage!\"\n\nThe triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of\nthese words, had a powerful effect in alarming the mother; who cried\nout, in much agitation:\n\n\"Ury, Ury! Be umble, and make terms, my dear!\"\n\n\"Mother!\" he retorted, \"will you keep quiet? You're in a fright, and\ndon't know what you say or mean. Umble!\" he repeated, looking at me,\nwith a snarl; \"I've umbled some of 'em for a pretty long time back,\numble as I was!\"\n\nMr. Micawber, genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat, presently\nproceeded with his composition.\n\n\"'Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of my knowledge,\ninformation, and belief'\"--\n\n\"But _that_ won't do,\" muttered Uriah, relieved. \"Mother, you keep\nquiet.\"\n\n\"We will endeavour to provide something that WILL do, and do for you\nfinally, sir, very shortly,\" replied Mr. Micawber.\n\n\"'Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of my knowledge,\ninformation, and belief, systematically forged, to various entries,\nbooks, and documents, the signature of Mr. W.; and has distinctly done\nso in one instance, capable of proof by me. To wit, in manner following,\nthat is to say:'\"\n\nAgain, Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words,\nwhich, however ludicrously displayed in his case, was, I must say, not\nat all peculiar to him. I have observed it, in the course of my life, in\nnumbers of men. It seems to me to be a general rule. In the taking of\nlegal oaths, for instance, deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily\nwhen they come to several good words in succession, for the expression\nof one idea; as, that they utterly detest, abominate, and abjure, or so\nforth; and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle.\nWe talk about the tyranny of words, but we like to tyrannise over them\ntoo; we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to\nwait upon us on great occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds\nwell. As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on\nstate occasions, if they be but fine and numerous enough, so, the\nmeaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration, if there\nbe but a great parade of them. And as individuals get into trouble by\nmaking too great a show of liveries, or as slaves when they are too\nnumerous rise against their masters, so I think I could mention a nation\nthat has got into many great difficulties, and will get into many\ngreater, from maintaining too large a retinue of words.\n\nMr. Micawber read on, almost smacking his lips:\n\n\"'To wit, in manner following, that is to say. Mr. W. being infirm, and\nit being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to\nsome discoveries, and to the downfall of--HEEP'S--power over the W.\nfamily,--as I, Wilkins Micawber, the undersigned, assume--unless the\nfilial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from\nallowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made,\nthe said--HEEP--deemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him, as from\nMr. W., for the before-mentioned sum of twelve six fourteen, two and\nnine, with interest, stated therein to have been advanced by--HEEP--to\nMr. W. to save Mr. W. from dishonor; though really the sum was never\nadvanced by him, and has long been replaced. The signatures to this\ninstrument, purporting to be executed by Mr. W. and attested by Wilkins\nMicawber, are forgeries by--HEEP. I have, in my possession, in his hand\nand pocket-book, several similar imitations of Mr. W.'s signature, here\nand there defaced by fire, but legible to any one. I never attested any\nsuch document. And I have the document itself, in my possession.'\"\n\nUriah Heep, with a start, took out of his pocket a bunch of keys, and\nopened a certain drawer; then, suddenly bethought himself of what he was\nabout, and turned again towards us, without looking in it.\n\n\"'And I have the document,'\" Mr. Micawber read again, looking about as\nif it were the text of a sermon, \"'in my possession,'--that is to say, I\nhad, early this morning, when this was written, but have since\nrelinquished it to Mr. Traddles.\"\n\n\"It is quite true,\" assented Traddles.\n\n\"Ury, Ury!\" cried the mother, \"be umble and make terms. I know my son\nwill be umble, gentlemen, if you'll give him time to think. Mr.\nCopperfield, I'm sure you know that he was always very umble, sir!\"\n\nIt was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick, when\nthe son had abandoned it as useless.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which\nhis hand was wrapped, \"you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me.\"\n\n\"But I love you, Ury,\" cried Mrs. Heep. And I have no doubt she did; or\nthat he loved her, however strange it may appear; though, to be sure,\nthey were a congenial couple. \"And I can't bear to hear you provoking\nthe gentlemen, and endangering of yourself more. I told the gentleman at\nfirst, when he told me up-stairs it was come to light, that I would\nanswer for your being umble, and making amends. Oh, see how umble _I_\nam, gentlemen, and don't mind him!\"\n\n\"Why, there's Copperfield, mother,\" he angrily retorted, pointing his\nlean finger at me, against whom all his animosity was levelled, as the\nprime mover in the discovery; and I did not undeceive him; \"there's\nCopperfield, would have given you a hundred pound to say less than\nyou've blurted out!\"\n\n\"I can't help it, Ury,\" cried his mother. \"I can't see you running into\ndanger, through carrying your head so high. Better be umble, as you\nalways was.\"\n\nHe remained for a little, biting the handkerchief, and then said to me\nwith a scowl:\n\n\"What more have you got to bring forward? If anything, go on with it.\nWhat do you look at me for?\"\n\nMr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter, only too glad to revert to a\nperformance with which he was so highly satisfied.\n\n\"'Third. And last. I am now in a condition to show, by--HEEP'S--false\nbooks, and--HEEP'S--real memoranda, beginning with the partially\ndestroyed pocket-book (which I was unable to comprehend, at the time\nof its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber, on our taking possession\nof our present abode, in the locker or binn devoted to the reception\nof the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth), that the weaknesses,\nthe faults, the very virtues, the parental affections, and the sense\nof honor, of the unhappy Mr. W. have been for years acted on by, and\nwarped to the base purposes of--HEEP. That Mr. W. has been for years\ndeluded and plundered, in every conceivable manner, to the pecuniary\naggrandisement of the avaricious, false, and grasping--HEEP. That the\nengrossing object of--HEEP--was, next to gain, to subdue Mr. and Miss\nW. (of his ulterior views in reference to the latter I say nothing)\nentirely to himself. That his last act, completed but a few months\nsince, was to induce Mr. W. to execute a relinquishment of his share\nin the partnership, and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of\nhis house, in consideration of a certain annuity, to be well and truly\npaid by--HEEP--on the four common quarter-days in each and every year.\nThat these meshes; beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of\nthe estate of which Mr. W. is the receiver, at a period when Mr. W.\nhad launched into imprudent and ill-judged speculations, and may not\nhave had the money, for which he was morally and legally responsible,\nin hand; going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous\ninterest, really coming from--HEEP--and by--HEEP--fraudulently obtained\nor withheld from Mr. W. himself, on pretence of such speculations or\notherwise; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous\nchicaneries--gradually thickened, until the unhappy Mr. W. could see no\nworld beyond. Bankrupt, as he believed, alike in circumstances, in all\nother hope, and in honor, his sole reliance was upon the monster in the\ngarb of man,'\"--Mr. Micawber made a good deal of this, as a new turn of\nexpression,--\"'who, by making himself necessary to him, had achieved\nhis destruction. All this I undertake to show. Probably much more!'\"\n\nI whispered a few words to Agnes, who was weeping, half joyfully,\nhalf-sorrowfully, at my side; and there was a movement among us, as if\nMr. Micawber had finished. He said, with exceeding gravity, \"Pardon\nme,\" and proceeded, with a mixture of the lowest spirits and the most\nintense enjoyment, to the peroration of his letter.\n\n\"'I have now concluded. It merely remains for me to substantiate these\naccusations; and then, with my ill-starred family, to disappear from\nthe landscape on which we appear to be an incumbrance. That is soon\ndone. It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of\ninanition, as being the frailest member of our circle; and that our\ntwins will follow next in order. So be it! For myself, my Canterbury\nPilgrimage has done much; imprisonment on civil process, and want, will\nsoon do more. I trust that the labor and hazard of an investigation--of\nwhich the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the\npressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions,\nat rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the\nwatchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon--combined\nwith the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to\nthe right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet\nwater on my funereal pyre. I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely\nsaid of me, as of a gallant and eminent naval Hero, with whom I have\nno pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of\nmercenary and selfish objects,\n\n                     For England, home, and Beauty.\n\n\"'Remaining always, &c. &c., WILKINS MICAWBER.'\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nMuch affected, but still intensely enjoying himself, Mr. Micawber folded\nup his letter, and handed it with a bow to my aunt, as something she\nmight like to keep.\n\nThere was, as I had noticed on my first visit long ago, an iron safe in\nthe room. The key was in it. A hasty suspicion seemed to strike Uriah;\nand, with a glance at Mr. Micawber, he went to it, and threw the doors\nclanking open. It was empty.\n\n\"Where are the books!\" he cried, with a frightful face. \"Some thief has\nstolen the books!\"\n\nMr. Micawber tapped himself with the ruler. \"_I_ did, when I got the key\nfrom you as usual--but a little earlier--and opened it this morning.\"\n\n\"Don't be uneasy,\" said Traddles. \"They have come into my possession. I\nwill take care of them, under the authority I mentioned.\"\n\n\"You receive stolen goods, do you?\" cried Uriah.\n\n\"Under such circumstances,\" answered Traddles, \"yes.\"\n\nWhat was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt, who had been profoundly\nquiet and attentive, make a dart at Uriah Heep, and seize him by the\ncollar with both hands!\n\n\"You know what _I_ want?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"A strait-waistcoat,\" said he.\n\n\"No. My property!\" returned my aunt. \"Agnes, my dear, as long as\nI believed it had been really made away with by your father, I\nwouldn't--and, my dear, I didn't, even to Trot, as he knows--breathe a\nsyllable of its having been placed here for investment. But, now I know\nthis fellow's answerable for it, and I'll have it! Trot, come and take\nit away from him!\"\n\nWhether my aunt supposed, for the moment, that he kept her property in\nhis neck-kerchief, I am sure I don't know; but she certainly pulled at\nit as if she thought so. I hastened to put myself between them, and to\nassure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost\nrestitution of everything he had wrongly got. This, and a few moments'\nreflection, pacified her; but she was not at all disconcerted by what\nshe had done (though I cannot say as much for her bonnet) and resumed\nher seat composedly.\n\nDuring the last few minutes, Mrs. Heep had been clamoring to her son to\nbe \"umble;\" and had been going down on her knees to all of us in\nsuccession, and making the wildest promises. Her son sat her down in his\nchair; and, standing sulkily by her, holding her arm with his hand, but\nnot rudely, said to me, with a ferocious look:\n\n\"What do you want done?\"\n\n\"I will tell you what must be done,\" said Traddles.\n\n\"Has that Copperfield no tongue?\" muttered Uriah. \"I would do a good\ndeal for you if you could tell me, without lying, that somebody had cut\nit out.\"\n\n\"My Uriah means to be umble!\" cried his mother. \"Don't mind what he\nsays, good gentlemen!\"\n\n\"What must be done,\" said Traddles, \"is this. First, the deed of\nrelinquishment, that we have heard of, must be given over to me\nnow--here.\"\n\n\"Suppose I haven't got it,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"But you have,\" said Traddles; \"therefore, you know, we won't suppose\nso.\" And I cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion on which\nI really did justice to the clear head, and the plain, patient,\npractical good sense, of my old schoolfellow. \"Then,\" said Traddles,\n\"you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become\npossessed of, and to make restoration to the last farthing. All the\npartnership books and papers must remain in our possession; all your\nbooks and papers; all money accounts and securities, of both kinds. In\nshort, everything here.\"\n\n\"Must it? I don't know that,\" said Uriah. \"I must have time to think\nabout that.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Traddles; \"but, in the meanwhile, and until\neverything is done to our satisfaction, we shall maintain possession of\nthese things; and beg you--in short, compel you--to keep your own room,\nand hold no communication with any one.\"\n\n\"I won't do it!\" said Uriah, with an oath.\n\n\"Maidstone Jail is a safer place of detention,\" observed Traddles; \"and\nthough the law may be longer in righting us, and may not be able to\nright us so completely as you can, there is no doubt of its punishing\n_you_. Dear me, you know that quite as well as I! Copperfield, will you\ngo round to the Guildhall, and bring a couple of officers?\"\n\nHere, Mrs. Heep broke out again, crying on her knees to Agnes to\ninterfere in their behalf, exclaiming that he was very humble, and it\nwas all true, and if he didn't do what we wanted, she would, and much\nmore to the same purpose; being half frantic with fears for her darling.\nTo inquire what he might have done, if he had had any boldness, would be\nlike inquiring what a mongrel cur might do, if it had the spirit of a\ntiger. He was a coward, from head to foot; and showed his dastardly\nnature through his sullenness and mortification, as much as at any time\nof his mean life.\n\n\"Stop!\" he growled to me; and wiped his hot face with his hand. \"Mother,\nhold your noise. Well! Let'em have that deed. Go and fetch it!\"\n\n\"Do you help her, Mr. Dick,\" said Traddles, \"if you please.\"\n\nProud of his commission, and understanding it, Mr. Dick accompanied her\nas a shepherd's dog might accompany a sheep. But, Mrs. Heep gave him\nlittle trouble; for she not only returned with the deed, but with the\nbox in which it was, where we found a banker's book and some other\npapers that were afterwards serviceable.\n\n\"Good!\" said Traddles, when this was brought. \"Now, Mr. Heep, you can\nretire to think: particularly observing, if you please, that I declare\nto you, on the part of all present, that there is only one thing to be\ndone; that it is what I have explained; and that it must be done without\ndelay.\"\n\nUriah, without lifting his eyes from the ground, shuffled across the\nroom with his hand to his chin, and pausing at the door, said:\n\n\"Copperfield, I have always hated you. You've always been an upstart,\nand you've always been against me.\"\n\n\"As I think I told you once before,\" said I, \"it is you who have been,\nin your greed and cunning, against all the world. It may be profitable\nto you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed and cunning in\nthe world yet, that did not do too much, and over-reach themselves. It\nis as certain as death.\"\n\n\"Or as certain as they used to teach at school (the same school where I\npicked up so much umbleness), from nine o'clock to eleven, that labor\nwas a curse; and from eleven o'clock to one, that it was a blessing\nand a cheerfulness, and a dignity, and I don't know what all, eh?\"\nsaid he with a sneer. \"You preach, about as consistent as they did.\nWon't umbleness go down? I shouldn't have got round my gentleman\nfellow-partner without it, I think.--Micawber, you old bully, I'll pay\n_you_!\"\n\nMr. Micawber, supremely defiant of him and his extended finger, and\nmaking a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door,\nthen addressed himself to me, and proffered me the satisfaction of\n\"witnessing the re-establishment of mutual confidence between himself\nand Mrs. Micawber.\" After which, he invited the company generally to the\ncontemplation of that affecting spectacle.\n\n  [Illustration: Restoration of mutual confidence between Mr. and Mrs.\n  Micawber.]\n\n\"The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and\nmyself, is now withdrawn,\" said Mr. Micawber; \"and my children and the\nAuthor of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms.\"\n\nAs we were all very grateful to him, and all desirous to show that we\nwere, as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit, I\ndare say we should all have gone, but that it was necessary for Agnes to\nreturn to her father, as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope;\nand for some one else to hold Uriah in safe keeping. So, Traddles\nremained for the latter purpose, to be presently relieved by Mr. Dick;\nand Mr. Dick, my aunt, and I, went home with Mr. Micawber. As I parted\nhurriedly from the dear girl to whom I owed so much, and thought from\nwhat she had been saved, perhaps, that morning--her better resolution\nnotwithstanding--I felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger\ndays which had brought me to the knowledge of Mr. Micawber.\n\nHis house was not far off; and as the street-door opened into the\nsitting room, and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own, we\nfound ourselves at once in the bosom of the family. Mr. Micawber\nexclaiming, \"Emma! my life!\" rushed into Mrs. Micawber's arms. Mrs.\nMicawber shrieked, and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace. Miss\nMicawber, nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs. Micawber's last\nletter to me, was sensibly affected. The stranger leaped. The twins\ntestified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations.\nMaster Micawber, whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early\ndisappointment, and whose aspect had become morose, yielded to his\nbetter feelings, and blubbered.\n\n\"Emma!\" said Mr. Micawber. \"The cloud is past from my mind. Mutual\nconfidence, so long preserved between us once, is restored, to know no\nfarther interruption. Now, welcome poverty!\" cried Mr. Micawber,\nshedding tears. \"Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger,\nrags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the\nend!\"\n\nWith these expressions, Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber in a chair,\nand embraced the family all round; welcoming a variety of bleak\nprospects, which appeared, to the best of my judgment, to be anything\nbut welcome to them; and calling upon them to come out into Canterbury\nand sing a chorus, as nothing else was left for their support.\n\nBut Mrs. Micawber having, in the strength of her emotions, fainted away,\nthe first thing to be done, even before the chorus could be considered\ncomplete, was to recover her. This, my aunt and Mr. Micawber did; and\nthen my aunt was introduced, and Mrs. Micawber recognised me.\n\n\"Excuse me, dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said the poor lady, giving me her\nhand, \"but I am not strong; and the removal of the late misunderstanding\nbetween Mr. Micawber and myself was at first too much for me.\"\n\n\"Is this all your family, ma'am?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"There are no more at present,\" returned Mrs. Micawber.\n\n\"Good gracious, I didn't mean that, ma'am,\" said my aunt. \"I mean are\nall these yours?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied Mr. Micawber, \"it is a true bill.\"\n\n\"And that eldest young gentleman, now,\" said my aunt, musing. \"What has\n_he_ been brought up to?\"\n\n\"It was my hope when I came here,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"to have got\nWilkins into the Church: or perhaps I shall express my meaning more\nstrictly, if I say the Choir. But there was no vacancy for a tenor in\nthe venerable Pile for which this city is so justly eminent; and he\nhas--in short, he has contracted a habit of singing in public-houses,\nrather than in sacred edifices.\"\n\n\"But he means well,\" said Mrs. Micawber, tenderly.\n\n\"I dare say, my love,\" rejoined Mr. Micawber, \"that he means\nparticularly well; but I have not yet found that he carries out his\nmeaning, in any given direction whatsoever.\"\n\nMaster Micawber's moroseness of aspect returned upon him again, and he\ndemanded, with some temper, what he was to do? Whether he had been born\na carpenter, or a coach painter, any more than he had been born a bird?\nWhether he could go into the next street, and open a chemist's shop?\nWhether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a\nlawyer? Whether he could come out by force at the opera, and succeed by\nviolence? Whether he could do anything, without being brought up to\nsomething?\n\nMy aunt mused a little while, and then said:\n\n\"Mr. Micawber, I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to\nemigration.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"it was the dream of my youth, and the\nfallacious aspiration of my riper years.\" I am thoroughly persuaded, by\nthe bye, that he had never thought of it in his life.\n\n\"Aye?\" said my aunt, with a glance at me. \"Why, what a thing it would be\nfor yourselves and your family, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, if you were to\nemigrate now.\"\n\n\"Capital, madam, capital,\" urged Mr. Micawber, gloomily.\n\n\"That is the principal, I may say the only difficulty, my dear Mr.\nCopperfield,\" assented his wife.\n\n\"Capital?\" cried my aunt. \"But you are doing us a great service--have\ndone us a great service, I may say, for surely much will come out of the\nfire--and what could we do for you, that would be half so good as to\nfind the capital?\"\n\n\"I could not receive it as a gift,\" said Mr. Micawber, full of fire and\nanimation, \"but if a sufficient sum could be advanced, say at five per\ncent. interest, per annum, upon my personal liability--say my notes of\nhand, at twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months, respectively, to\nallow time for something to turn up----\"\n\n\"Could be? Can be, and shall be, on your own terms,\" returned my aunt,\n\"if you say the word. Think of this now, both of you. Here are some\npeople David knows, going out to Australia shortly. If you decide to go,\nwhy shouldn't you go in the same ship? You may help each other. Think of\nthis now, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. Take your time, and weigh it well.\"\n\n\"There is but one question, my dear ma'am, I could wish to ask,\" said\nMrs. Micawber. \"The climate, I believe, is healthy.\"\n\n\"Finest in the world!\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Just so,\" returned Mrs. Micawber. \"Then my question arises. Now, _are_\nthe circumstances of the country such, that a man of Mr. Micawber's\nabilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale? I will\nnot say, at present, might he aspire to be Governor, or anything of that\nsort; but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to develop\nthemselves--that, would be amply sufficient--and find their own\nexpansion?\"\n\n\"No better opening anywhere,\" said my aunt, \"for a man who conducts\nhimself well, and is industrious.\"\n\n\"For a man who conducts himself well,\" repeated Mrs. Micawber, with her\nclearest business manner, \"and is industrious. Precisely. It is evident\nto me that Australia is the legitimate sphere of action for Mr.\nMicawber!\"\n\n\"I entertain the conviction, my dear madam,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"that it\nis, under existing circumstances, the land, the only land, for myself\nand family; and that something of an extraordinary nature will turn up\non that shore. It is no distance--comparatively speaking; and though\nconsideration is due to the kindness of your proposal, I assure you that\nis a mere matter of form.\"\n\nShall I ever forget how, in a moment, he was the most sanguine of men,\nlooking on to fortune; or how Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed about\nthe habits of the kangaroo! Shall I ever recall that street of\nCanterbury on a market day, without recalling him, as he walked back\nwith us; expressing, in the hardy roving manner he assumed, the\nunsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land; and looking at\nthe bullocks, as they came by, with the eye of an Australian farmer!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nANOTHER RETROSPECT.\n\n\nI must pause yet once again. O, my child-wife, there is a figure in the\nmoving crowd before my memory, quiet and still, saying in its innocent\nlove and childish beauty, Stop to think of me--turn to look upon the\nlittle blossom, as it flutters to the ground!\n\nI do. All else grows dim, and fades away. I am again with Dora, in our\ncottage. I do not know how long she has been ill. I am so used to it in\nfeeling, that I cannot count the time. It is not really long, in weeks\nor months; but, in my usage and experience, it is a weary, weary while.\n\nThey have left off telling me to \"wait a few days more.\" I have begun\nto fear, remotely, that the day may never shine, when I shall see my\nchild-wife running in the sunlight with her old friend Jip.\n\nHe is, as it were suddenly, grown very old. It may be, that he misses in\nhis mistress, something that enlivened him and made him younger; but he\nmopes, and his sight is weak, and his limbs are feeble, and my aunt is\nsorry that he objects to her no more, but creeps near her as he lies on\nDora's bed--she sitting at the bedside--and mildly licks her hand.\n\nDora lies smiling on us, and is beautiful, and utters no hasty or\ncomplaining word. She says that we are very good to her; that her\ndear old careful boy is tiring himself out, she knows; that my aunt\nhas no sleep, yet is always wakeful, active, and kind. Sometimes, the\nlittle bird-like ladies come to see her; and then we talk about our\nwedding-day, and all that happy time.\n\nWhat a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be--and in all\nlife, within doors and without--when I sit in the quiet, shaded,\norderly, room, with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me,\nand her little fingers twining round my hand! Many and many an hour I\nsit thus; but, of all those times, three times come the freshest on my\nmind.\n\n                                 * * *\n\nIt is morning; and Dora, made so trim by my aunt's hands, shews me how\nher pretty hair _will_ curl upon the pillow yet, and how long and bright\nit is, and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she\nwears.\n\n\"Not that I am vain of it, now, you mocking boy,\" she says, when I\nsmile; \"but because you used to say you thought it so beautiful; and\nbecause, when I first began to think about you, I used to peep in the\nglass, and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it.\nOh what a foolish fellow you were, Doady, when I gave you one!\"\n\n\"That was on the day when you were painting the flowers I had given you,\nDora, and when I told you how much in love I was.\"\n\n\"Ah! but I didn't like to tell _you_,\" says Dora, \"_then_, how I had\ncried over them, because I believed you really liked me! When I can run\nabout again as I used to do, Doady, let us go and see those places where\nwe were such a silly couple, shall we? And take some of the old walks?\nAnd not forget poor papa?\"\n\n\"Yes, we will, and have some happy days. So you must make haste to get\nwell, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall soon do that! I am so much better, you don't know!\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nIt is evening; and I sit in the same chair, by the same bed, with the\nsame face turned towards me. We have been silent, and there is a smile\nupon her face. I have ceased to carry my light burden up and down stairs\nnow. She lies here all the day.\n\n\"Doady!\"\n\n\"My dear Dora!\"\n\n\"You won't think what I am going to say, unreasonable, after what you\ntold me, such a little while ago, of Mr. Wickfield's not being well? I\nwant to see Agnes. Very much I want to see her.\"\n\n\"I will write to her, my dear.\"\n\n\"Will you?\"\n\n\"Directly.\"\n\n\"What a good, kind boy! Doady, take me on your arm. Indeed, my dear,\nit's not a whim. It's not a foolish fancy. I want, very much indeed, to\nsee her!\"\n\n\"I am certain of it. I have only to tell her so, and she is sure to\ncome.\"\n\n\"You are very lonely when you go down stairs, now?\" Dora whispers, with\nher arm about my neck.\n\n\"How can I be otherwise, my own love, when I see your empty chair?\"\n\n\"My empty chair!\" She clings to me for a little while, in silence. \"And\nyou really miss me, Doady?\" looking up, and brightly smiling. \"Even\npoor, giddy, stupid me?\"\n\n\"My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?\"\n\n\"Oh, husband! I am so glad, yet so sorry!\" creeping closer to me, and\nfolding me in both her arms. She laughs, and sobs, and then is quiet,\nand quite happy.\n\n\"Quite!\" she says. \"Only give Agnes my dear love, and tell her that I\nwant very, very, much to see her; and I have nothing left to wish for.\"\n\n\"Except to get well again, Dora.\"\n\n\"Ah, Doady! Sometimes I think--you know I always was a silly little\nthing!--that that will never be!\"\n\n\"Don't say so, Dora! Dearest love, don't think so!\"\n\n\"I won't, if I can help it, Doady. But I am very happy; though my dear\nboy is so lonely by himself, before his child-wife's empty chair!\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nIt is night; and I am with her still. Agnes has arrived; has been among\nus, for a whole day and an evening. She, my aunt, and I, have sat with\nDora since the morning, all together. We have not talked much, but Dora\nhas been perfectly contented and cheerful. We are now alone.\n\nDo I know, now, that my child-wife will soon leave me? They have told me\nso; they have told me nothing new to my thoughts; but I am far from sure\nthat I have taken that truth to heart. I cannot master it. I have\nwithdrawn by myself, many times to-day, to weep. I have remembered Who\nwept for a parting between the living and the dead. I have bethought me\nof all that gracious and compassionate history. I have tried to resign\nmyself, and to console myself; and that, I hope, I may have done\nimperfectly; but what I cannot firmly settle in my mind is, that the end\nwill absolutely come. I hold her hand in mine, I hold her heart in mine,\nI see her love for me, alive in all its strength. I cannot shut out a\npale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared.\n\n\"I am going to speak to you, Doady. I am going to say something I have\noften thought of saying, lately. You won't mind?\" with a gentle look.\n\n\"Mind, my darling?\"\n\n\"Because I don't know what you will think, or what you may have thought\nsometimes. Perhaps you have often thought the same. Doady, dear, I am\nafraid I was too young.\"\n\nI lay my face upon the pillow by her, and she looks into my eyes, and\nspeaks very softly. Gradually, as she goes on, I feel, with a stricken\nheart, that she is speaking of herself as past.\n\n\"I am afraid, dear, I was too young. I don't mean in years only, but in\nexperience, and thoughts, and everything. I was such a silly little\ncreature! I am afraid it would have been better, if we had only loved\neach other as a boy and girl, and forgotten it. I have begun to think I\nwas not fit to be a wife.\"\n\nI try to stay my tears, and to reply, \"Oh, Dora, love, as fit as I to be\na husband!\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" with the old shake of her curls. \"Perhaps! But, if I had\nbeen more fit to be married, I might have made you more so, too.\nBesides, you are very clever, and I never was.\"\n\n\"We have been very happy, my sweet Dora.\"\n\n\"I was very happy, very. But, as years went on, my dear boy would have\nwearied of his child-wife. She would have been less and less a companion\nfor him. He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting\nin his home. She wouldn't have improved. It is better as it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dora, dearest, dearest, do not speak to me so. Every word seems a\nreproach!\"\n\n\"No, not a syllable!\" she answers, kissing me. \"Oh, my dear, you never\ndeserved it, and I loved you far too well, to say a reproachful word to\nyou, in earnest--it was all the merit I had, except being pretty--or you\nthought me so. Is it lonely down-stairs, Doady?\"\n\n\"Very! Very!\"\n\n\"Don't cry! Is my chair there?\"\n\n\"In its old place.\"\n\n\"Oh, how my poor boy cries! Hush, hush! Now, make me one promise. I want\nto speak to Agnes. When you go down-stairs, tell Agnes so, and send her\nup to me; and while I speak to her, let no one come--not even aunt. I\nwant to speak to Agnes by herself. I want to speak to Agnes, quite\nalone.\"\n\nI promise that she shall, immediately; but I cannot leave her, for my\ngrief.\n\n\"I said that it was better as it is!\" she whispers, as she holds me in\nher arms. \"Oh, Doady, after more years, you never could have loved your\nchild-wife better than you do; and, after more years, she would so have\ntried and disappointed you, that you might not have been able to love\nher half so well! I know I was too young and foolish. It is much better\nas it is!\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nAgnes is down-stairs, when I go into the parlor; and I give her the\nmessage. She disappears, leaving me alone with Jip.\n\nHis Chinese house is by the fire; and he lies within it, on his bed of\nflannel, querulously trying to sleep. The bright moon is high and clear.\nAs I look out on the night, my tears fall fast, and my undisciplined\nheart is chastened heavily--heavily.\n\nI sit down by the fire, thinking with a blind remorse of all those\nsecret feelings I have nourished since my marriage. I think of every\nlittle trifle between me and Dora, and feel the truth, that trifles make\nthe sum of life. Ever rising from the sea of my remembrance, is the\nimage of the dear child as I knew her first, graced by my young love,\nand by her own, with every fascination wherein such love is rich. Would\nit, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and\ngirl, and forgotten it? Undisciplined heart, reply!\n\nHow the time wears, I know not; until I am recalled by my child-wife's\nold companion. More restless than he was, he crawls out of his house,\nand looks at me, and wanders to the door, and whines to go up-stairs.\n\n\"Not to-night, Jip! Not to-night!\"\n\nHe comes very slowly back to me, licks my hand, and lifts his dim eyes\nto my face.\n\n\"O, Jip! It may be, never again!\"\n\nHe lies down at my feet, stretches himself out as if to sleep, and with\na plaintive cry, is dead.\n\n  [Illustration: My child-wife's old companion.]\n\n\"O Agnes! Look, look, here!\"\n\n--That face, so full of pity and of grief, that rain of tears, that\nawful mute appeal to me, that solemn hand upraised towards Heaven!\n\n\"Agnes?\"\n\nIt is over. Darkness comes before my eyes; and, for a time, all things\nare blotted out of my remembrance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nMR. MICAWBER'S TRANSACTIONS.\n\n\nThis is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of my mind\nbeneath its load of sorrow. I came to think that the Future was walled\nup before me, that the energy and action of my life were at an end, that\nI never could find any refuge but in the grave. I came to think so, I\nsay, but not in the first shock of my grief. It slowly grew to that. If\nthe events I go on to relate, had not thickened around me, in the\nbeginning to confuse, and in the end to augment, my affliction, it is\npossible, (though I think not probable), that I might have fallen at\nonce into this condition. As it was, an interval occurred before I fully\nknew my own distress; an interval, in which I even supposed that its\nsharpest pangs were past; and when my mind could soothe itself by\nresting on all that was most innocent and beautiful, in the tender story\nthat was closed for ever.\n\nWhen it was first proposed that I should go abroad, or how it came to be\nagreed among us that I was to seek the restoration of my peace in change\nand travel, I do not, even now, distinctly know. The spirit of Agnes so\npervaded all we thought, and said, and did, in that time of sorrow, that\nI assume I may refer the project to her influence. But her influence was\nso quiet that I know no more.\n\nAnd now, indeed, I began to think that in my old association of her with\nthe stained-glass window in the church, a prophetic foreshadowing of\nwhat she would be to me, in the calamity that was to happen in the\nfullness of time, had found a way into my mind. In all that sorrow, from\nthe moment, never to be forgotten, when she stood before me with her\nupraised hand, she was like a sacred presence in my lonely house. When\nthe Angel of Death alighted there, my child-wife fell asleep--they told\nme so when I could bear to hear it--on her bosom, with a smile. From my\nswoon, I first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears, her\nwords of hope and peace, her gentle face bending down as from a purer\nregion nearer Heaven, over my undisciplined heart, and softening its\npain.\n\nLet me go on.\n\nI was to go abroad. That seemed to have been determined among us from\nthe first. The ground now covering all that could perish of my departed\nwife, I waited only for what Mr. Micawber called the \"final\npulverisation of Heep,\" and for the departure of the emigrants.\n\nAt the request of Traddles, most affectionate and devoted of friends in\nmy trouble, we returned to Canterbury: I mean my aunt, Agnes, and I. We\nproceeded by appointment straight to Mr. Micawber's house; where, and at\nMr. Wickfield's, my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive\nmeeting. When poor Mrs. Micawber saw me come in, in my black clothes,\nshe was sensibly affected. There was a great deal of good in Mrs.\nMicawber's heart, which had not been dunned out of it in all those many\nyears.\n\n\"Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber,\" was my aunt's first salutation after we\nwere seated. \"Pray, have you thought about that emigration proposal of\nmine?\"\n\n\"My dear madam,\" returned Mr. Micawber, \"perhaps I cannot better express\nthe conclusion at which Mrs. Micawber, your humble servant, and I may\nadd our children, have jointly and severally arrived, than by borrowing\nthe language of an illustrious poet, to reply that our Boat is on the\nshore, and our Bark is on the sea.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said my aunt. \"I augur all sorts of good from your\nsensible decision.\"\n\n\"Madam, you do us a great deal of honor,\" he rejoined. He then referred\nto a memorandum. \"With respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling\nus to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise, I have\nreconsidered that important business-point; and would beg to propose\nmy notes of hand--drawn, it is needless to stipulate, on stamps of\nthe amounts respectively required by the various Acts of Parliament\napplying to such securities--at eighteen, twenty-four, and thirty\nmonths. The proposition I originally submitted, was twelve, eighteen,\nand twenty-four; but I am apprehensive that such an arrangement might\nnot allow sufficient time for the requisite amount of--Something--to\nturn up. We might not,\" said Mr. Micawber, looking round the room as if\nit represented several hundred acres of highly-cultivated land, \"on the\nfirst responsibility becoming due, have been successful in our harvest,\nor we might not have got our harvest in. Labor, I believe, is sometimes\ndifficult to obtain in that portion of our colonial possessions where\nit will be our lot to combat with the teeming soil.\"\n\n\"Arrange it in any way you please, sir,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Madam,\" he replied, \"Mrs. Micawber and myself are deeply sensible of\nthe very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons. What I wish\nis, to be perfectly business-like, and perfectly punctual. Turning over,\nas we are about to turn over, an entirely new leaf; and falling back, as\nwe are now in the act of falling back, for a Spring of no common\nmagnitude; it is important to my sense of self-respect, besides being an\nexample to my son, that these arrangements should be concluded as\nbetween man and man.\"\n\nI don't know that Mr. Micawber attached any meaning to this last phrase;\nI don't know that anybody ever does, or did; but he appeared to relish\nit uncommonly, and repeated, with an impressive cough, \"as between man\nand man.\"\n\n\"I propose,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"Bills--a convenience to the mercantile\nworld, for which, I believe, we are originally indebted to the Jews, who\nappear to me to have had a devilish deal too much to do with them ever\nsince--because they are negotiable. But if a Bond, or any other\ndescription of security, would be preferred, I should be happy to\nexecute any such instrument. As between man and man.\"\n\nMy aunt observed, that in a case where both parties were willing to\nagree to anything, she took it for granted there would be no difficulty\nin settling this point. Mr. Micawber was of her opinion.\n\n\"In reference to our domestic preparations, madam,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nwith some pride, \"for meeting the destiny to which we are now understood\nto be self-devoted, I beg to report them. My eldest daughter attends at\nfive every morning in a neighbouring establishment, to acquire the\nprocess--if process it may be called--of milking cows. My younger\nchildren are instructed to observe, as closely as circumstances will\npermit, the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer\nparts of this city: a pursuit from which they have, on two occasions,\nbeen brought home, within an inch of being run over. I have myself\ndirected some attention, during the past week, to the art of baking; and\nmy son Wilkins has issued forth with a walking-stick and driven cattle,\nwhen permitted, by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge, to\nrender any voluntary service in that direction--which I regret to say,\nfor the credit of our nature, was not often; he being generally warned,\nwith imprecations, to desist.\"\n\n\"All very right indeed,\" said my aunt, encouragingly. \"Mrs. Micawber has\nbeen busy, too, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"My dear madam,\" returned Mrs. Micawber, with her business-like air, \"I\nam free to confess, that I have not been actively engaged in pursuits\nimmediately connected with cultivation or with stock, though well aware\nthat both will claim my attention on a foreign shore. Such opportunities\nas I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties, I have\ndevoted to corresponding at some length with my family. For I own it\nseems to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, who always\nfell back on me, I suppose from old habit, to whomsoever else she might\naddress her discourse at starting, \"that the time is come when the past\nshould be buried in oblivion; when my family should take Mr. Micawber by\nthe hand, and Mr. Micawber should take my family by the hand; when the\nlion should lie down with the lamb, and my family be on terms with Mr.\nMicawber.\"\n\nI said I thought so too.\n\n\"This, at least, is the light, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\" pursued Mrs.\nMicawber, \"in which _I_ view the subject. When I lived at home with my\npapa and mama, my papa was accustomed to ask, when any point was under\ndiscussion in our limited circle, 'In what light does my Emma view the\nsubject?' That my papa was too partial, I know; still, on such a point\nas the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr. Micawber and\nmy family, I necessarily have formed an opinion, delusive though it may\nbe.\"\n\n\"No doubt. Of course you have, ma'am,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Precisely so,\" assented Mrs. Micawber. \"Now, I may be wrong in my\nconclusions; it is very likely that I am; but my individual impression\nis, that the gulf between my family and Mr. Micawber may be traced to an\napprehension, on the part of my family, that Mr. Micawber would require\npecuniary accommodation. I cannot help thinking,\" said Mrs. Micawber,\nwith an air of deep sagacity, \"that there are members of my family who\nhave been apprehensive that Mr. Micawber would solicit them for their\nnames.--I do not mean to be conferred in Baptism upon our children, but\nto be inscribed on Bills of Exchange, and negotiated in the Money\nMarket.\"\n\nThe look of penetration with which Mrs. Micawber announced this\ndiscovery, as if no one had ever thought of it before, seemed rather to\nastonish my aunt; who abruptly replied, \"Well, ma'am, upon the whole, I\nshouldn't wonder if you were right!\"\n\n\"Mr. Micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary shackles\nthat have so long enthralled him,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"and of\ncommencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for\nhis abilities,--which, in my opinion, is exceedingly important; Mr.\nMicawber's abilities peculiarly requiring space,--it seems to me that my\nfamily should signalise the occasion by coming forward. What I could\nwish to see, would be a meeting between Mr. Micawber and my family at a\nfestive entertainment, to be given at my family's expence; where Mr.\nMicawber's health and prosperity being proposed, by some leading member\nof my family, Mr. Micawber might have an opportunity of developing his\nviews.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber, with some heat, \"it may be better for me\nto state distinctly, at once, that if I were to develop my views to that\nassembled group, they would possibly be found of an offensive nature: my\nimpression being that your family are, in the aggregate, impertinent\nSnobs; and, in detail, unmitigated Ruffians.\"\n\n\"Micawber,\" said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, \"no! You have never\nunderstood them, and they have never understood you.\"\n\nMr. Micawber coughed.\n\n\"They have never understood you, Micawber,\" said his wife. \"They may be\nincapable of it. If so, that is their misfortune. I can pity their\nmisfortune.\"\n\n\"I am extremely sorry, my dear Emma,\" said Mr. Micawber, relenting, \"to\nhave been betrayed into any expressions that might, even remotely, have\nthe appearance of being strong expressions. All I would say, is, that I\ncan go abroad without your family coming forward to favor me,--in short,\nwith a parting Shove of their cold shoulders; and that, upon the whole,\nI would rather leave England with such impetus as I possess, than derive\nany acceleration of it from that quarter. At the same time, my dear, if\nthey should condescend to reply to your communications--which our joint\nexperience renders most improbable--far be it from me to be a barrier to\nyour wishes.\"\n\nThe matter being thus amicably settled, Mr. Micawber gave Mrs. Micawber\nhis arm, and, glancing at the heap of books and papers lying before\nTraddles on the table, said they would leave us to ourselves; which they\nceremoniously did.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" said Traddles, leaning back in his chair when\nthey were gone, and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes\nred, and his hair all kinds of shapes, \"I don't make any excuse for\ntroubling you with business, because I know you are deeply interested in\nit, and it may divert your thoughts. My dear boy, I hope you are not\nworn out?\"\n\n\"I am quite myself,\" said I, after a pause. \"We have more cause to think\nof my aunt than of any one. You know how much she has done.\"\n\n\"Surely, surely,\" answered Traddles. \"Who can forget it!\"\n\n\"But even that is not all,\" said I. \"During the last fortnight, some new\ntrouble has vexed her; and she has been in and out of London every day.\nSeveral times she has gone out early, and been absent until evening.\nLast night, Traddles, with this journey before her, it was almost\nmidnight before she came home. You know what her consideration for\nothers is. She will not tell me what has happened to distress her.\"\n\nMy aunt, very pale, and with deep lines in her face, sat immovable until\nI had finished; when some stray tears found their way to her cheeks, and\nshe put her hand on mine.\n\n\"It's nothing, Trot; it's nothing. There will be no more of it. You\nshall know by and by. Now Agnes, my dear, let us attend to these\naffairs.\"\n\n\"I must do Mr. Micawber the justice to say,\" Traddles began, \"that\nalthough he would appear not to have worked to any good account for\nhimself, he is a most untiring man when he works for other people. I\nnever saw such a fellow. If he always goes on in the same way, he must\nbe, virtually, about two hundred years old, at present. The heat into\nwhich he has been continually putting himself; and the distracted and\nimpetuous manner in which he has been diving, day and night, among\npapers and books; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has\nwritten me between this house and Mr. Wickfield's, and often across the\ntable when he has been sitting opposite, and might much more easily have\nspoken; is quite extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Letters!\" cried my aunt. \"I believe he dreams in letters!\"\n\n\"There's Mr. Dick, too,\" said Traddles, \"has been doing wonders! As soon\nas he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep, whom he kept in such\ncharge as _I_ never saw exceeded, he began to devote himself to Mr.\nWickfield. And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we\nhave been making, and his real usefulness in extracting, and copying,\nand fetching, and carrying, have been quite stimulating to us.\"\n\n\"Dick is a very remarkable man,\" exclaimed my aunt; \"and I always said\nhe was. Trot, you know it!\"\n\n\"I am happy to say, Miss Wickfield,\" pursued Traddles, at once with\ngreat delicacy and with great earnestness, \"that in your absence Mr.\nWickfield has considerably improved. Relieved of the incubus that had\nfastened upon him for so long a time, and of the dreadful apprehensions\nunder which he had lived, he is hardly the same person. At times, even\nhis impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on\nparticular points of business, has recovered itself very much; and he\nhas been able to assist us in making some things clear, that we should\nhave found very difficult indeed, if not hopeless, without him. But,\nwhat I have to do is to come to results; which are short enough; not to\ngossip on all the hopeful circumstances I have observed, or I shall\nnever have done.\"\n\nHis natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that he\nsaid this to put us in good heart, and to enable Agnes to hear her\nfather mentioned with greater confidence; but it was not the less\npleasant for that.\n\n\"Now, let me see,\" said Traddles, looking among the papers on the table.\n\"Having counted our funds, and reduced to order a great mass of\nunintentional confusion in the first place, and of wilful confusion and\nfalsification in the second, we take it to be clear that Mr. Wickfield\nmight now wind up his business, and his agency-trust, and exhibit no\ndeficiency or defalcation whatever.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank Heaven!\" cried Agnes, fervently.\n\n\"But,\" said Traddles, \"the surplus that would be left as his means of\nsupport--and I suppose the house to be sold, even in saying this--would\nbe so small, not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds,\nthat perhaps, Miss Wickfield, it would be best to consider whether he\nmight not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been\nreceiver. His friends might advise him, you know; now he is free. You\nyourself, Miss Wickfield--Copperfield--I--\"\n\n\"I have considered it, Trotwood,\" said Agnes, looking to me, \"and I feel\nthat it ought not to be, and must not be; even on the recommendation of\na friend to whom I am so grateful, and owe so much.\"\n\n\"I will not say that I recommend it,\" observed Traddles. \"I think it\nright to suggest it. No more.\"\n\n\"I am happy to hear you say so,\" answered Agnes, steadily, \"for it\ngives me hope, almost assurance, that we think alike. Dear Mr. Traddles\nand dear Trotwood, papa once free with honor, what could I wish for!\nI have always aspired, if I could have released him from the toils in\nwhich he was held, to render back some little portion of the love and\ncare I owe him, and to devote my life to him. It has been, for years,\nthe utmost height of my hopes. To take our future on myself, will be\nthe next great happiness--the next to his release from all trust and\nresponsibility--that I can know.\"\n\n\"Have you thought how, Agnes?\"\n\n\"Often! I am not afraid, dear Trotwood. I am certain of success. So many\npeople know me here, and think kindly of me, that I am certain. Don't\nmistrust me. Our wants are not many. If I rent the dear old house, and\nkeep a school, I shall be useful and happy.\"\n\nThe calm fervor of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly, first the\ndear old house itself, and then my solitary home, that my heart was too\nfull for speech. Traddles pretended for a little while to be busily\nlooking among the papers.\n\n\"Next, Miss Trotwood,\" said Traddles, \"that property of yours.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" sighed my aunt. \"All I have got to say about it, is, that\nif it's gone, I can bear it; and if it's not gone, I shall be glad to\nget it back.\"\n\n\"It was originally, I think, eight thousand pounds, Consols?\" said\nTraddles.\n\n\"Right!\" replied my aunt.\n\n\"I can't account for more than five,\" said Traddles, with an air of\nperplexity.\n\n\"--thousand, do you mean?\" inquired my aunt, with uncommon composure,\n\"or pounds?\"\n\n\"Five thousand pounds,\" said Traddles.\n\n\"It was all there was,\" returned my aunt. \"I sold three, myself. One,\nI paid for your articles, Trot, my dear; and the other two I have by\nme. When I lost the rest, I thought it wise to say nothing about that\nsum, but to keep it secretly for a rainy day. I wanted to see how you\nwould come out of the trial, Trot; and you came out nobly--persevering,\nself-reliant, self-denying! So did Dick. Don't speak to me, for I find\nmy nerves a little shaken!\"\n\nNobody would have thought so, to see her sitting upright, with her arms\nfolded; but she had wonderful self-command.\n\n\"Then I am delighted to say,\" cried Traddles, beaming with joy, \"that we\nhave recovered the whole money!\"\n\n\"Don't congratulate me, anybody!\" exclaimed my aunt. \"How so, sir?\"\n\n\"You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr. Wickfield?\" said\nTraddles.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" said my aunt, \"and was therefore easily silenced.\nAgnes, not a word!\"\n\n\"And indeed,\" said Traddles, \"it was sold, by virtue of the power of\nmanagement he held from you; but I needn't say by whom sold, or on whose\nactual signature. It was afterwards pretended to Mr. Wickfield, by that\nrascal,--and proved, too, by figures,--that he had possessed himself of\nthe money (on general instructions, _he_ said) to keep other\ndeficiencies and difficulties from the light. Mr. Wickfield, being so\nweak and helpless in his hands as to pay you, afterwards, several sums\nof interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist, made\nhimself, unhappily, a party to the fraud.\"\n\n\"And at last took the blame upon himself,\" added my aunt; \"and wrote me\na mad letter, charging himself with robbery, and wrong unheard of. Upon\nwhich I paid him a visit early one morning, called for a candle, burnt\nthe letter, and told him if he ever could right me and himself, to do\nit; and if he couldn't, to keep his own counsel for his daughter's\nsake.--If anybody speaks to me, I'll leave the house!\"\n\nWe all remained quiet; Agnes covering her face.\n\n\"Well, my dear friend,\" said my aunt, after a pause, \"and you have\nreally extorted the money back from him?\"\n\n\"Why, the fact is,\" returned Traddles, \"Mr. Micawber had so completely\nhemmed him in, and was always ready with so many new points if an old\none failed, that he could not escape from us. A most remarkable\ncircumstance is, that I really don't think he grasped this sum even so\nmuch for the gratification of his avarice, which was inordinate, as in\nthe hatred he felt for Copperfield. He said so to me, plainly. He said\nhe would even have spent as much, to baulk or injure Copperfield.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said my aunt, knitting her brows thoughtfully, and glancing at\nAgnes. \"And what's become of him?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He left here,\" said Traddles, \"with his mother, who had\nbeen clamouring, and beseeching, and disclosing, the whole time. They\nwent away by one of the London night coaches, and I know no more about\nhim; except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious. He\nseemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me, than to Mr.\nMicawber; which I consider (as I told him) quite a compliment.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose he has any money, Traddles?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes, I should think so,\" he replied, shaking his head,\nseriously. \"I should say he must have pocketed a good deal, in one way\nor other. But, I think you would find, Copperfield, if you had an\nopportunity of observing his course, that money would never keep that\nman out of mischief. He is such an incarnate hypocrite, that whatever\nobject he pursues, he must pursue crookedly. It's his only compensation\nfor the outward restraints he puts upon himself. Always creeping along\nthe ground to some small end or other, he will always magnify every\nobject in the way; and consequently will hate and suspect every body\nthat comes, in the most innocent manner, between him and it. So, the\ncrooked courses will become crookeder, at any moment, for the least\nreason, or for none. It's only necessary to consider his history here,\"\nsaid Traddles, \"to know that.\"\n\n\"He's a monster of meanness!\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Really I don't know about that,\" observed Traddles thoughtfully. \"Many\npeople can be very mean, when they give their minds to it.\"\n\n\"And now, touching Mr. Micawber,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Well, really,\" said Traddles, cheerfully, \"I must, once more, give Mr.\nMicawber high praise. But for his having been so patient and persevering\nfor so long a time, we never could have hoped to do anything worth\nspeaking of. And I think we ought to consider that Mr. Micawber did\nright, for right's sake, when we reflect what terms he might have made\nwith Uriah Heep himself, for his silence.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" said I.\n\n\"Now, what would you give him?\" inquired my aunt.\n\n\"Oh! Before you come to that,\" said Traddles, a little disconcerted, \"I\nam afraid I thought it discreet to omit (not being able to carry\neverything before me) two points, in making this lawless adjustment--for\nit's perfectly lawless from beginning to end--of a difficult affair.\nThose I. O. U.'s, and so forth, which Mr. Micawber gave him for the\nadvances he had--\"\n\n\"Well! They must be paid,\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't know when they may be proceeded on, or where they\nare,\" rejoined Traddles, opening his eyes; \"and I anticipate, that,\nbetween this time and his departure, Mr. Micawber will be constantly\narrested, or taken in execution.\"\n\n\"Then he must be constantly set free again, and taken out of execution,\"\nsaid my aunt. \"What's the amount altogether?\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. Micawber has entered the transactions--he calls them\ntransactions--with great form, in a book,\" rejoined Traddles, smiling;\n\"and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds, five.\"\n\n\"Now, what shall we give him, that sum included?\" said my aunt. \"Agnes,\nmy dear, you and I can talk about division of it afterwards. What should\nit be? Five hundred pounds?\"\n\nUpon this, Traddles and I both struck in at once. We both recommended a\nsmall sum in money, and the payment, without stipulation to Mr.\nMicawber, of the Uriah claims as they came in. We proposed that the\nfamily should have their passage and their outfit, and a hundred pounds;\nand that Mr. Micawber's arrangement for the repayment of the advances\nshould be gravely entered into, as it might be wholesome for him to\nsuppose himself under that responsibility. To this, I added the\nsuggestion, that I should give some explanation of his character and\nhistory to Mr. Peggotty, who I knew could be relied on; and that to Mr.\nPeggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another\nhundred. I further proposed to interest Mr. Micawber in Mr. Peggotty, by\nconfiding so much of Mr. Peggotty's story to him as I might feel\njustified in relating, or might think expedient; and to endeavour to\nbring each of them to bear upon the other, for the common advantage. We\nall entered warmly into these views; and I may mention at once, that the\nprincipals themselves did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will\nand harmony.\n\nSeeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, I reminded\nhim of the second and last point to which he had adverted.\n\n\"You and your aunt will excuse me, Copperfield, if I touch upon a\npainful theme, as I greatly fear I shall,\" said Traddles, hesitating;\n\"but I think it necessary to bring it to your recollection. On the day\nof Mr. Micawber's memorable denunciation, a threatening allusion was\nmade by Uriah Heep to your aunt's--husband.\"\n\nMy aunt, retaining her stiff position, and apparent composure, assented\nwith a nod.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" observed Traddles, \"it was mere purposeless impertinence?\"\n\n\"No,\" returned my aunt.\n\n\"There was--pardon me--really such a person, and at all in his power?\"\nhinted Traddles.\n\n\"Yes, my good friend,\" said my aunt.\n\nTraddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained that he\nhad not been able to approach this subject; that it had shared the fate\nof Mr. Micawber's liabilities, in not being comprehended in the terms he\nhad made; that we were no longer of any authority with Uriah Heep; and\nthat if he could do us, or any of us, any injury or annoyance, no doubt\nhe would.\n\nMy aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way to\nher cheeks.\n\n\"You are quite right,\" she said. \"It was very thoughtful to mention it.\"\n\n\"Can I--or Copperfield--do anything?\" asked Traddles, gently.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said my aunt. \"I thank you many times. Trot, my dear, a vain\nthreat! Let us have Mr. and Mrs. Micawber back. And don't any of you\nspeak to me!\" With that, she smoothed her dress, and sat, with her\nupright carriage, looking at the door.\n\n\"Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber!\" said my aunt, when they entered. \"We have\nbeen discussing your emigration, with many apologies to you for keeping\nyou out of the room so long; and I'll tell you what arrangements we\npropose.\"\n\nThese she explained, to the unbounded satisfaction of the\nfamily,--children and all being then present,--and so much to the\nawakening of Mr. Micawber's punctual habits in the opening stage of\nall bill transactions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately\nrushing out, in the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of\nhand. But, his joy received a sudden check; for within five minutes,\nhe returned in the custody of a sheriff's officer, informing us, in a\nflood of tears, that all was lost. We, being quite prepared for this\nevent, which was of course a proceeding of Uriah Heep's, soon paid the\nmoney; and in five minutes more Mr. Micawber was seated at the table,\nfilling up the stamps with an expression of perfect joy, which only\nthat congenial employment, or the making of punch, could impart in full\ncompleteness to his shining face. To see him at work on the stamps,\nwith the relish of an artist, touching them like pictures, looking\nat them sideways, taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his\npocket-book, and contemplating them when finished, with a high sense of\ntheir precious value, was a sight indeed.\n\n\"Now, the best thing you can do, sir, if you'll allow me to advise you,\"\nsaid my aunt, after silently observing him, \"is to abjure that\noccupation for evermore.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied Mr. Micawber, \"it is my intention to register such a\nvow on the virgin page of the future. Mrs. Micawber will attest it. I\ntrust,\" said Mr. Micawber, solemnly, \"that my son Wilkins will ever bear\nin mind, that he had infinitely better put his fist in the fire, than\nuse it to handle the serpents that have poisoned the life-blood of his\nunhappy parent!\" Deeply affected, and changed in a moment to the image\nof despair, Mr. Micawber regarded the serpents with a look of gloomy\nabhorrence (in which his late admiration of them was not quite subdued),\nfolded them up, and put them in his pocket.\n\nThis closed the proceedings of the evening. We were weary with sorrow\nand fatigue, and my aunt and I were to return to London on the morrow.\nIt was arranged that the Micawbers should follow us, after effecting a\nsale of their goods to a broker; that Mr. Wickfield's affairs should be\nbrought to a settlement, with all convenient speed, under the direction\nof Traddles; and that Agnes should also come to London, pending those\narrangements. We passed the night at the old house, which, freed from\nthe presence of the Heeps, seemed purged of a disease; and I lay in my\nold room, like a shipwrecked wanderer come home.\n\nWe went back next day to my aunt's house--not to mine; and when she and\nI sat alone, as of old, before going to bed, she said:\n\n\"Trot, do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind lately?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do, aunt. If there ever was a time when I felt unwilling that\nyou should have a sorrow or anxiety which I could not share, it is now.\"\n\n\"You have had sorrow enough, child,\" said my aunt, affectionately,\n\"without the addition of _my_ little miseries. I could have no other\nmotive, Trot, in keeping anything from you.\"\n\n\"I know that well,\" said I. \"But tell me now.\"\n\n\"Would you ride with me a little way to-morrow morning?\" asked my aunt.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"At nine,\" said she. \"I'll tell you then, my dear.\"\n\nAt nine, accordingly, we went out in a little chariot, and drove to\nLondon. We drove a long way through the streets, until we came to one of\nthe large hospitals. Standing hard by the building was a plain hearse.\nThe driver recognised my aunt, and, in obedience to a motion of her hand\nat the window, drove slowly off; we following.\n\n\"You understand it now, Trot,\" said my aunt. \"He is gone!\"\n\n\"Did he die in the hospital?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe sat immovable beside me; but, again I saw the stray tears on her\nface.\n\n\"He was there once before,\" said my aunt presently. \"He was ailing a\nlong time--a shattered, broken man, these many years. When he knew his\nstate in this last illness, he asked them to send for me. He was sorry\nthen. Very sorry.\"\n\n\"You went, I know, aunt.\"\n\n\"I went. I was with him a good deal afterwards.\"\n\n\"He died the night before we went to Canterbury?\" said I.\n\nMy aunt nodded. \"No one can harm him now,\" she said. \"It was a vain\nthreat.\"\n\nWe drove away, out of town, to the churchyard at Hornsey. \"Better here\nthan in the streets,\" said my aunt. \"He was born here.\"\n\nWe alighted; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember well,\nwhere the service was read consigning it to the dust.\n\n\"Six-and-thirty years ago, this day, my dear,\" said my aunt, as we\nwalked back to the chariot, \"I was married. God forgive us all!\"\n\nWe took our seats in silence; and so she sat beside me for a long time,\nholding my hand. At length she suddenly burst into tears, and said:\n\n\"He was a fine-looking man when I married him, Trot--and he was sadly\nchanged!\"\n\nIt did not last long. After the relief of tears, she soon became\ncomposed, and even cheerful. Her nerves were a little shaken, she said,\nor she would not have given way to it. God forgive us all!\n\nSo we rode back to her little cottage at Highgate, where we found the\nfollowing short note, which had arrived by that morning's post from Mr.\nMicawber:\n\n                                                        \"Canterbury,\n\n                                                                \"Friday.\n\n     \"My dear Madam, and Copperfield,\n\n     \"The fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again\n     enveloped in impenetrable mists, and for ever withdrawn from the\n     eyes of a drifting wretch whose Doom is sealed!\n\n     \"Another writ has been issued (in His Majesty's High Court of\n     King's Bench at Westminster), in another cause of HEEP _v._\n     MICAWBER, and the defendant in that cause is the prey of the\n     sheriff having legal jurisdiction in this bailiwick.\n\n                  'Now's the day, and now's the hour,\n                  See the front of battle lower,\n                  See approach proud EDWARD'S power--\n                                      Chains and slavery!'\n\n     \"Consigned to which, and to a speedy end (for mental torture\n     is not supportable beyond a certain point, and that point I\n     feel I have attained), my course is run.

I have started up so\nvividly impressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet\nroom, in the still night. I dream of it sometimes, though at lengthened\nand uncertain intervals, to this hour. I have an association between it\nand a stormy wind, or the lightest mention of a sea-shore, as strong as\nany of which my mind is conscious. As plainly as I behold what happened,\nI will try to write it down. I do not recal it, but see it done; for it\nhappens again before me.\n\nThe time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship, my\ngood old nurse (almost broken-hearted for me, when we first met) came up\nto London. I was constantly with her, and her brother, and the Micawbers\n(they being very much together); but Emily I never saw.\n\nOne evening when the time was close at hand, I was alone with Peggotty\nand her brother. Our conversation turned on Ham. She described to us how\ntenderly he had taken leave of her, and how manfully and quietly he had\nborne himself. Most of all, of late, when she believed he was most\ntried. It was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired;\nand our interest in hearing the many examples which she, who was so much\nwith him, had to relate, was equal to hers in relating them.\n\nMy aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Highgate; I\nintending to go abroad, and she to return to her house at Dover. We had\na temporary lodging in Covent Garden. As I walked home to it, after this\nevening's conversation, reflecting on what had passed between Ham and\nmyself when I was last at Yarmouth, I wavered in the original purpose I\nhad formed, of leaving a letter for Emily when I should take leave of\nher uncle on board the ship, and thought it would be better to write to\nher now. She might desire, I thought, after receiving my communication,\nto send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover. I ought to give\nher the opportunity.\n\nI therefore sat down in my room, before going to bed, and wrote to her.\nI told her that I had seen him, and that he had requested me to tell her\nwhat I have already written in its place in these sheets. I faithfully\nrepeated it. I had no need to enlarge upon it, if I had had the right.\nIts deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man.\nI left it out, to be sent round in the morning; with a line to Mr.\nPeggotty, requesting him to give it to her; and went to bed at daybreak.\n\nI was weaker than I knew then; and, not falling asleep until the sun was\nup, lay late, and unrefreshed, next day. I was roused by the silent\npresence of my aunt at my bedside. I felt it in my sleep, as I suppose\nwe all do feel such things.\n\n\"Trot, my dear,\" she said, when I opened my eyes, \"I couldn't make up my\nmind to disturb you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?\"\n\nI replied yes, and he soon appeared.\n\n\"Mas'r Davy,\" he said, when we had shaken hands, \"I giv Em'ly your\nletter, sir, and she writ this heer; and begged of me fur to ask you to\nread it, and if you see no hurt in't, to be so kind as take charge\non't.\"\n\n\"Have you read it?\" said I.\n\nHe nodded sorrowfully. I opened it, and read as follows:\n\n     \"I have got your message. Oh, what can I write, to thank you for\n     your good and blessed kindness to me!\n\n     \"I have put the words close to my heart. I shall keep them till\n     I die. They are sharp thorns, but they are such comfort. I have\n     prayed over them, oh, I have prayed so much. When I find what you\n     are, and what uncle is, I think what God must be, and can cry to\n     him.\n\n     \"Good bye for ever. Now, my dear, my friend, good bye for ever in\n     this world. In another world, if I am forgiven, I may wake a child\n     and come to you. All thanks and blessings. Farewell, evermore!\"\n\nThis, blotted with tears, was the letter.\n\n\"May I tell her as you doen't see no hurt in't, and as you'll be so kind\nas take charge on't, Mas'r Davy?\" said Mr. Peggotty, when I had read it.\n\n\"Unquestionably,\" said I--\"but I am thinking--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mas'r Davy?\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" said I, \"that I'll go down again to Yarmouth. There's\ntime, and to spare, for me to go and come back before the ship sails. My\nmind is constantly running on him, in his solitude; to put this letter\nof her writing in his hand at this time, and to enable you to tell her,\nin the moment of parting, that he has got it, will be a kindness to both\nof them. I solemnly accepted his commission, dear good fellow, and\ncannot discharge it too completely. The journey is nothing to me. I am\nrestless, and shall be better in motion. I'll go down to-night.\"\n\nThough he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me, I saw that he was of my\nmind; and this, if I had required to be confirmed in my intention, would\nhave had the effect. He went round to the coach-office, at my request,\nand took the box-seat for me on the mail. In the evening I started, by\nthat conveyance, down the road I had traversed under so many\nvicissitudes.\n\n\"Don't you think that,\" I asked the coachman, in the first stage out of\nLondon, \"a very remarkable sky? I don't remember to have seen one like\nit.\"\n\n\"Nor I--not equal to it,\" he replied. \"That's wind, sir. There'll be\nmischief done at sea, I expect, before long.\"\n\nIt was a murky confusion--here and there blotted with a colour like the\ncolour of the smoke from damp fuel--of flying clouds, tossed up into\nmost remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights in the clouds than\nthere were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the\nearth, through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong, as if, in\na dread disturbance of the laws of nature, she had lost her way and were\nfrightened. There had been a wind all day; and it was rising then, with\nan extraordinary great sound. In another hour it had much increased, and\nthe sky was more overcast, and it blew hard.\n\nBut, as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely\noverspreading the whole sky, then very dark, it came on to blow, harder\nand harder. It still increased, until our horses could scarcely face the\nwind. Many times, in the dark part of the night (it was then late in\nSeptember, when the nights were not short), the leaders turned about, or\ncame to a dead stop; and we were often in serious apprehension that the\ncoach would be blown over. Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this\nstorm, like showers of steel; and, at those times, when there was any\nshelter of trees or lee walls to be got, we were fain to stop, in a\nsheer impossibility of continuing the struggle.\n\nWhen the day broke, it blew harder and harder. I had been in Yarmouth\nwhen the seamen said it blew great guns, but I had never known the like\nof this, or anything approaching to it. We came to Ipswich--very late,\nhaving had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten miles out of\nLondon; and found a cluster of people in the market-place, who had risen\nfrom their beds in the night, fearful of falling chimneys. Some of\nthese, congregating about the inn-yard while we changed horses, told us\nof great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church-tower, and\nflung into a bye street, which they then blocked up. Others had to tell\nof country people, coming in from neighbouring villages, who had seen\ngreat trees lying torn out of the earth, and whole ricks scattered about\nthe roads and fields. Still, there was no abatement in the storm, but it\nblew harder.\n\nAs we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea, from which this mighty\nwind was blowing dead on shore, its force became more and more terrific.\nLong before we saw the sea, its spray was on our lips, and showered salt\nrain upon us. The water was out, over miles and miles of the flat\ncountry adjacent to Yarmouth; and every sheet and puddle lashed its\nbanks, and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us.\nWhen we came within sight of the sea, the waves on the horizon, caught\nat intervals above the rolling abyss, were like glimpses of another\nshore with towers and buildings. When at last we got into the town, the\npeople came out to their doors, all aslant, and with streaming hair,\nmaking a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night.\n\nI put up at the old inn, and went down to look at the sea; staggering\nalong the street, which was strewn with sand and seaweed, and with\nflying blotches of sea-foam; afraid of falling slates and tiles; and\nholding by people I met, at angry corners. Coming near the beach, I saw,\nnot only the boatmen, but half the people of the town, lurking behind\nbuildings; some, now and then braving the fury of the storm to look away\nto sea, and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag\nback.\n\nJoining these groups, I found bewailing women whose husbands were away\nin herring or oyster boats, which there was too much reason to think\nmight have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety.\nGrizzled old sailors were among the people, shaking their heads, as they\nlooked from water to sky, and muttering to one another; ship-owners,\nexcited and uneasy; children, huddling together, and peering into older\nfaces; even stout mariners, disturbed and anxious, levelling their\nglasses at the sea from behind places of shelter, as if they were\nsurveying an enemy.\n\nThe tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient pause to look at\nit, in the agitation of the blinding wind, the flying stones and sand,\nand the awful noise, confounded me. As the high watery walls came\nrolling in, and, at their highest, tumbled into surf, they looked as if\nthe least would engulf the town. As the receding wave swept back with a\nhoarse roar, it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach, as if its\npurpose were to undermine the earth. When some white-headed billows\nthundered on, and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the\nland, every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full\nmight of its wrath, rushing to be gathered to the composition of another\nmonster. Undulating hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys\n(with a solitary storm-bird sometimes skimming through them) were lifted\nup to hills; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming\nsound; every shape tumultuously rolled on, as soon as made, to change\nits shape and place, and beat another shape and place away; the ideal\nshore on the horizon, with its towers and buildings, rose and fell; the\nclouds flew fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of\nall nature.\n\nNot finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind--for it is\nstill remembered down there, as the greatest ever known to blow upon\nthat coast--had brought together, I made my way to his house. It was\nshut; and as no one answered to my knocking, I went, by back ways and\nbye-lanes, to the yard where he worked. I learned, there, that he had\ngone to Lowestoft, to meet some sudden exigency of ship-repairing in\nwhich his skill was required; but that he would be back to-morrow\nmorning, in good time.\n\nI went back to the inn; and when I had washed and dressed, and tried to\nsleep, but in vain, it was five o'clock in the afternoon. I had not sat\nfive minutes by the coffee-room fire, when the waiter, coming to stir\nit, as an excuse for talking, told me that two colliers had gone down,\nwith all hands, a few miles away; and that some other ships had been\nseen laboring hard in the Roads, and trying, in great distress, to keep\noff-shore. Mercy on them, and on all poor sailors, said he, if we had\nanother night like the last!\n\nI was very much depressed in spirits; very solitary; and felt an\nuneasiness in Ham's not being there, disproportionate to the occasion. I\nwas seriously affected, without knowing how much, by late events; and my\nlong exposure to the fierce wind had confused me. There was that jumble\nin my thoughts and recollections, that I had lost the clear arrangement\nof time and distance. Thus, if I had gone out into the town, I should\nnot have been surprised, I think, to encounter some one who I knew must\nbe then in London. So to speak, there was in these respects a curious\ninattention in my mind. Yet it was busy, too, with all the remembrances\nthe place naturally awakened; and they were particularly distinct and\nvivid.\n\nIn this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence about the ships\nimmediately connected itself, without any effort of my volition, with my\nuneasiness about Ham. I was persuaded that I had an apprehension of his\nreturning from Lowestoft by sea, and being lost. This grew so strong\nwith me, that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner,\nand ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea\nat all likely? If he gave me the least reason to think so, I would go\nover to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me.\n\nI hastily ordered my dinner, and went back to the yard. I was none too\nsoon; for the boat-builder, with a lantern in his hand, was locking the\nyard-gate. He quite laughed, when I asked him the question, and said\nthere was no fear; no man in his senses, or out of them, would put off\nin such a gale of wind, least of all Ham Peggotty, who had been born to\nseafaring.\n\nSo sensible of this, beforehand, that I had really felt ashamed of doing\nwhat I was nevertheless impelled to do, I went back to the inn. If such\na wind could rise, I think it was rising. The howl and roar, the\nrattling of the doors and windows, the rumbling in the chimneys, the\napparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious\ntumult of the sea, were more fearful than in the morning. But there was\nnow a great darkness besides; and that invested the storm with new\nterrors, real and fanciful.\n\nI could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not continue stedfast to\nanything. Something within me, faintly answering to the storm without,\ntossed up the depths of my memory, and made a tumult in them. Yet, in\nall the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea,--the\nstorm, and my uneasiness regarding Ham, were always in the fore-ground.\n\nMy dinner went away almost untasted, and I tried to refresh myself with\na glass or two of wine. In vain. I fell into a dull slumber before the\nfire, without losing my consciousness, either of the uproar out of\ndoors, or of the place in which I was. Both became overshadowed by a new\nand indefinable horror; and when I awoke--or rather when I shook off the\nlethargy that bound me in my chair--my whole frame thrilled with\nobjectless and unintelligible fear.\n\nI walked to and fro, tried to read an old gazetteer, listened to the\nawful noises: looked at faces, scenes, and figures in the fire. At\nlength, the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall,\ntormented me to that degree that I resolved to go to bed.\n\nIt was re-assuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the\ninn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning. I went to\nbed, exceedingly weary and heavy; but, on my lying down, all such\nsensations vanished, as if by magic, and I was broad awake, with every\nsense refined.\n\nFor hours I lay there, listening to the wind and water; imagining, now,\nthat I heard shrieks out at sea; now, that I distinctly heard the firing\nof signal guns; and now, the fall of houses in the town. I got up,\nseveral times, and looked out; but could see nothing, except the\nreflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I had left burning,\nand of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void.\n\nAt length, my restlessness attained to such a pitch, that I hurried on\nmy clothes, and went down stairs. In the large kitchen, where I dimly\nsaw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams, the watchers were\nclustered together, in various attitudes, about a table, purposely moved\naway from the great chimney, and brought near the door. A pretty girl,\nwho had her ears stopped with her apron, and her eyes upon the door,\nscreamed when I appeared, supposing me to be a spirit; but the others\nhad more presence of mind, and were glad of an addition to their\ncompany. One man, referring to the topic they had been discussing, asked\nme whether I thought the souls of the collier-crews who had gone down,\nwere out in the storm?\n\nI remained there, I dare say, two hours. Once, I opened the yard-gate,\nand looked into the empty street. The sand, the sea-weed, and the flakes\nof foam, were driving by; and I was obliged to call for assistance\nbefore I could shut the gate again, and make it fast against the wind.\n\nThere was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber, when I at length returned\nto it; but I was tired now, and, getting into bed again, fell--off a\ntower and down a precipice--into the depths of sleep. I have an\nimpression that for a long time, though I dreamed of being elsewhere and\nin a variety of scenes, it was always blowing in my dream. At length, I\nlost that feeble hold upon reality, and was engaged with two dear\nfriends, but who they were I don't know, at the siege of some town in a\nroar of cannonading.\n\nThe thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I could not\nhear something I much desired to hear, until I made a great exertion and\nawoke. It was broad day--eight or nine o'clock; the storm raging, in\nlieu of the batteries; and some one knocking and calling at my door.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I cried.\n\n\"A wreck! Close by!\"\n\nI sprung out of bed, and asked what wreck?\n\n\"A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. Make\nhaste, sir, if you want to see her! It's thought, down on the beach,\nshe'll go to pieces every moment.\"\n\nThe excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; and I wrapped\nmyself in my clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into the street.\n\nNumbers of people were there before me, all running in one direction, to\nthe beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon came\nfacing the wild sea.\n\nThe wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not more\nsensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of, had been diminished\nby the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds. But, the sea,\nhaving upon it the additional agitation of the whole night, was\ninfinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last. Every appearance\nit had then presented, bore the expression of being _swelled_; and the\nheight to which the breakers rose, and, looking over one another, bore\none another down, and rolled in, in interminable hosts, was most\nappalling.\n\nIn the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves, and in the\ncrowd, and the unspeakable confusion, and my first breathless efforts to\nstand against the weather, I was so confused that I looked out to sea\nfor the wreck, and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves.\nA half-dressed boatman, standing next me, pointed with his bare arm (a\ntattoo'd arrow on it, pointing in the same direction) to the left. Then,\nO great Heaven, I saw it, close in upon us!\n\nOne mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, and lay\nover the side, entangled in a maze of sail and rigging; and all that\nruin, as the ship rolled and beat--which she did without a moment's\npause, and with a violence quite inconceivable--beat the side as if it\nwould stave it in. Some efforts were even then being made, to cut this\nportion of the wreck away; for, as the ship, which was broadside on,\nturned towards us in her rolling, I plainly descried her people at work\nwith axes, especially one active figure with long curling hair,\nconspicuous among the rest. But, a great cry, which was audible even\nabove the wind and water, rose from the shore at this moment; the sea,\nsweeping over the rolling wreck made a clean breach, and carried men,\nspars, casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling\nsurge.\n\nThe second mast was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and a\nwild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The ship had\nstruck once, the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted\nin and struck again. I understood him to add that she was parting\namidships, and I could readily suppose so, for the rolling and beating\nwere too tremendous for any human work to suffer long. As he spoke,\nthere was another great cry of pity from the beach; four men arose with\nthe wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the remaining\nmast; uppermost, the active figure with the curling hair.\n\nThere was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled and dashed, like a\ndesperate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her\ndeck, as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore, now nothing but\nher keel, as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea, the bell\nrang; and its sound, the knell of those unhappy men, was borne towards\nus on the wind. Again we lost her, and again she rose. Two men were\ngone. The agony on shore increased. Men groaned, and clasped their\nhands; women shrieked, and turned away their faces. Some ran wildly up\nand down along the beach, crying for help where no help could be. I\nfound myself one of these, frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom\nI knew, not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes.\n\nThey were making out to me, in an agitated way--I don't know how,\nfor the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to\nunderstand--that the life-boat had been bravely manned an hour ago,\nand could do nothing; and that as no man would be so desperate as to\nattempt to wade off with a rope, and establish a communication with\nthe shore, there was nothing left to try; when I noticed that some new\nsensation moved the people on the beach, and saw them part, and Ham\ncome breaking through them to the front.\n\nI ran to him--as well as I know, to repeat my appeal for help. But,\ndistracted though I was, by a sight so new to me and terrible, the\ndetermination in his face, and his look, out to sea--exactly the same\nlook as I remembered in connexion with the morning after Emily's\nflight--awoke me to a knowledge of his danger. I held him back with\nboth arms; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking, not to\nlisten to him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from off that sand!\n\nAnother cry arose on shore; and looking to the wreck, we saw the cruel\nsail, with blow on blow, beat off the lower of the two men, and fly up\nin triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast.\n\nAgainst such a sight, and against such determination as that of the\ncalmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people\npresent, I might as hopefully have entreated the wind. \"Mas'r Davy,\" he\nsaid, cheerily grasping me by both hands, \"if my time is come, 'tis\ncome. If 'tan't, I'll bide it. Lord above bless you, and bless all!\nMates, make me ready! I'm a going off!\"\n\nI was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the people\naround me made me stay; urging, as I confusedly perceived, that he was\nbent on going, with help or without, and that I should endanger the\nprecautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I\ndon't know what I answered, or what they rejoined; but, I saw hurry on\nthe beach, and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there, and\npenetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then, I saw\nhim standing alone, in a seaman's frock and trowsers: a rope in his\nhand, or slung to his wrist: another round his body: and several of the\nbest men holding, at a little distance, to the latter, which he laid out\nhimself, slack upon the shore, at his feet.\n\nThe wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking up. I saw that she\nwas parting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary man upon\nthe mast hung by a thread. Still, he clung to it. He had a singular red\ncap on,--not like a sailor's cap, but of a finer color; and as the few\nyielding planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged, and his\nanticipative death-knell rung, he was seen by all of us to wave it. I\nsaw him do it now, and thought I was going distracted, when his action\nbrought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend.\n\nHam watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended\nbreath behind him, and the storm before, until there was a great\nretiring wave, when, with a backward glance at those who held the rope\nwhich was made fast round his body, he dashed in after it, and in a\nmoment was buffetting with the water; rising with the hills, falling\nwith the valleys, lost beneath the foam; then drawn again to land. They\nhauled in hastily.\n\nHe was hurt. I saw blood on his face, from where I stood; but he took no\nthought of that. He seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for\nleaving him more free--or so I judged from the motion of his arm--and\nwas gone as before.\n\nAnd now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling with the\nvalleys, lost beneath the rugged foam, borne in towards the shore, borne\non towards the ship, striving hard and valiantly. The distance was\nnothing, but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly. At\nlength he neared the wreck. He was so near, that with one more of his\nvigorous strokes he would be clinging to it,--when, a high, green, vast\nhill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from beyond the ship, he seemed\nto leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was gone!\n\nSome eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask had been\nbroken, in running to the spot where they were hauling in. Consternation\nwas in every face. They drew him to my very feet--insensible--dead. He\nwas carried to the nearest house; and, no one preventing me now, I\nremained near him, busy, while every means of restoration were tried;\nbut he had been beaten to death by the great wave, and his generous\nheart was stilled for ever.\n\nAs I sat beside the bed, when hope was abandoned and all was done, a\nfisherman, who had known me when Emily and I were children, and ever\nsince, whispered my name at the door.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, with tears starting to his weather-beaten face, which,\nwith his trembling lips, was ashy pale, \"will you come over yonder?\"\n\nThe old remembrance that had been recalled to me, was in his look. I\nasked him, terror-stricken, leaning on the arm he held out to support\nme:\n\n\"Has a body come ashore?\"\n\nHe said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do I know it?\" I asked then.\n\nHe answered nothing.\n\nBut, he led me to the shore. And on that part of it where she and I had\nlooked for shells, two children--on that part of it where some lighter\nfragments of the old boat, blown down last night, had been scattered by\nthe wind--among the ruins of the home he had wronged--I saw him lying\nwith his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him lie at school.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nTHE NEW WOUND, AND THE OLD.\n\n\nNo need, O Steerforth, to have said, when we last spoke together, in\nthat hour which I so little deemed to be our parting-hour--no need to\nhave said, \"Think of me at my best!\" I had done that ever; and could I\nchange now, looking on this sight!\n\nThey brought a hand-bier, and laid him on it, and covered him with a\nflag, and took him up and bore him on towards the houses. All the men\nwho carried him had known him, and gone sailing with him, and seen him\nmerry and bold. They carried him through the wild roar, a hush in the\nmidst of all the tumult; and took him to the cottage where Death was\nalready.\n\nBut, when they set the bier down on the threshold, they looked at one\nanother, and at me, and whispered. I knew why. They felt as if it were\nnot right to lay him down in the same quiet room.\n\nWe went into the town, and took our burden to the inn. So soon as I\ncould at all collect my thoughts, I sent for Joram, and begged him to\nprovide me a conveyance in which it could be got to London in the night.\nI knew that the care of it, and the hard duty of preparing his mother to\nreceive it, could only rest with me; and I was anxious to discharge that\nduty as faithfully as I could.\n\nI chose the night for the journey, that there might be less curiosity\nwhen I left the town. But, although it was nearly midnight when I came\nout of the yard in a chaise, followed by what I had in charge, there\nwere many people waiting. At intervals, along the town, and even a\nlittle way out upon the road, I saw more; but at length only the bleak\nnight and the open country were around me, and the ashes of my youthful\nfriendship.\n\nUpon a mellow autumn day, about noon, when the ground was perfumed by\nfallen leaves, and many more, in beautiful tints of yellow, red, and\nbrown, yet hung upon the trees, through which the sun was shining, I\narrived at Highgate. I walked the last mile, thinking as I went along of\nwhat I had to do; and left the carriage that had followed me all through\nthe night, awaiting orders to advance.\n\nThe house, when I came up to it, looked just the same. Not a blind was\nraised; no sign of life was in the dull paved court, with its covered\nway leading to the disused door. The wind had quite gone down, and\nnothing moved.\n\nI had not, at first, the courage to ring at the gate; and when I did\nring, my errand seemed to me to be expressed in the very sound of the\nbell. The little parlour-maid came out, with the key in her hand; and\nlooking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate, said:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. Are you ill?\"\n\n\"I have been much agitated, and am fatigued.\"\n\n\"Is anything the matter, sir?--Mr. James?----\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said I. \"Yes, something has happened, that I have to break to\nMrs. Steerforth. She is at home?\"\n\nThe girl anxiously replied that her mistress was very seldom out now,\neven in a carriage; that she kept her room; that she saw no company, but\nwould see me. Her mistress was up, she said, and Miss Dartle was with\nher. What message should she take up stairs?\n\nGiving her a strict charge to be careful of her manner, and only to\ncarry in my card and say I waited, I sat down in the drawing-room (which\nwe had now reached) until she should come back. Its former pleasant air\nof occupation was gone, and the shutters were half closed. The harp had\nnot been used for many and many a day. His picture, as a boy, was there.\nThe cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there. I\nwondered if she ever read them now; if she would ever read them more!\n\nThe house was so still, that I heard the girl's light step up stairs. On\nher return, she brought a message, to the effect that Mrs. Steerforth\nwas an invalid and could not come down; but, that if I would excuse her\nbeing in her chamber, she would be glad to see me. In a few moments I\nstood before her.\n\nShe was in his room; not in her own. I felt, of course, that she had\ntaken to occupy it, in remembrance of him; and that the many tokens of\nhis old sports and accomplishments, by which she was surrounded,\nremained there, just as he had left them, for the same reason. She\nmurmured, however, even in her reception of me, that she was out of her\nown chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity; and with\nher stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth.\n\nAt her chair, as usual, was Rosa Dartle. From the first moment of her\ndark eyes resting on me, I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil\ntidings. The scar sprung into view that instant. She withdrew herself a\nstep behind the chair, to keep her own face out of Mrs. Steerforth's\nobservation; and scrutinised me with a piercing gaze that never\nfaltered, never shrunk.\n\n  [Illustration: I am the bearer of evil tidings.]\n\n\"I am sorry to observe you are in mourning, sir,\" said Mrs. Steerforth.\n\n\"I am unhappily a widower,\" said I.\n\n\"You are very young to know so great a loss,\" she returned. \"I am\ngrieved to hear it. I am grieved to hear it. I hope Time will be good to\nyou.\"\n\n\"I hope Time,\" said I, looking at her, \"will be good to all of us. Dear\nMrs. Steerforth, we must all trust to that, in our heaviest\nmisfortunes.\"\n\nThe earnestness of my manner, and the tears in my eyes, alarmed her. The\nwhole course of her thoughts appeared to stop, and change.\n\nI tried to command my voice in gently saying his name, but it trembled.\nShe repeated it to herself, two or three times, in a low tone. Then,\naddressing me, she said, with enforced calmness:\n\n\"My son is ill.\"\n\n\"Very ill.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Are you reconciled?\"\n\nI could not say Yes, I could not say No. She slightly turned her head\ntowards the spot where Rosa Dartle had been standing at her elbow, and\nin that moment I said, by the motion of my lips, to Rosa \"Dead!\"\n\nThat Mrs. Steerforth might not be induced to look behind her, and read,\nplainly written, what she was not yet prepared to know, I met her look\nquickly; but I had seen Rosa Dartle throw her hands up in the air with\nvehemence of despair and horror, and then clasp them on her face.\n\nThe handsome lady--so like, O so like!--regarded me with a fixed look,\nand put her hand to her forehead. I besought her to be calm, and prepare\nherself to bear what I had to tell; but I should rather have entreated\nher to weep, for she sat like a stone figure.\n\n\"When I was last here,\" I faltered, \"Miss Dartle told me he was sailing\nhere and there. The night before last was a dreadful one at sea. If he\nwere at sea that night, and near a dangerous coast, as it is said he\nwas; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship\nwhich----\"\n\n\"Rosa!\" said Mrs. Steerforth, \"come to me!\"\n\nShe came, but with no sympathy or gentleness. Her eyes gleamed like fire\nas she confronted his mother, and broke into a frightful laugh.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"is your pride appeased, you madwoman? _Now_ has he\nmade atonement to you----with his life! Do you hear?--His life!\"\n\nMrs. Steerforth, fallen back stiffly in her chair, and making no sound\nbut a moan, cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare.\n\n\"Aye!\" cried Rosa, smiting herself passionately on the breast, \"look at\nme! Moan, and groan, and look at me! Look here!\" striking the scar, \"at\nyour dead child's handy work!\"\n\nThe moan the mother uttered, from time to time, went to my heart. Always\nthe same. Always inarticulate and stifled. Always accompanied with an\nincapable motion of the head, but with no change of face. Always\nproceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth, as if the jaw were\nlocked and the face frozen up in pain.\n\n\"Do you remember when he did this?\" she proceeded. \"Do you remember\nwhen, in his inheritance of your nature, and in your pampering of his\npride and passion, he did this, and disfigured me for life? Look at me,\nmarked until I die with his high displeasure; and moan and groan for\nwhat you made him!\"\n\n\"Miss Dartle,\" I entreated her. \"For Heaven's sake----\"\n\n\"I _will_ speak!\" she said, turning on me with her lightning eyes. \"Be\nsilent, you! Look at me, I say, proud mother of a proud false son! Moan\nfor your nurture of him, moan for your corruption of him, moan for your\nloss of him, moan for mine!\"\n\nShe clenched her hand, and trembled through her spare, worn figure, as\nif her passion were killing her by inches.\n\n\"YOU, resent his selfwill!\" she exclaimed. \"You, injured by his haughty\ntemper! You, who opposed to both, when your hair was grey, the qualities\nwhich made both when you gave him birth! YOU, who from his cradle reared\nhim to be what he was, and stunted what he should have been! Are you\nrewarded, _now_, for your years of trouble?\"\n\n\"O Miss Dartle, shame! O cruel!\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" she returned, \"I _will_ speak to her. No power on earth\nshould stop me, while I was standing here! Have I been silent all these\nyears, and shall I not speak now? I loved him better than you ever loved\nhim!\" turning on her fiercely. \"I could have loved him, and asked no\nreturn. If I had been his wife, I could have been the slave of his\ncaprices for a word of love a-year. I should have been. Who knows it\nbetter than I? You were exacting, proud, punctilious, selfish. My love\nwould have been devoted--would have trod your paltry whimpering under\nfoot!\"\n\nWith flashing eyes, she stamped upon the ground as if she actually did\nit.\n\n\"Look here!\" she said, striking the scar again, with a relentless hand.\n\"When he grew into the better understanding of what he had done, he saw\nit, and repented of it! I could sing to him, and talk to him, and show\nthe ardor that I felt in all he did, and attain with labor to such\nknowledge as most interested him; and I attracted him. When he was\nfreshest and truest, he loved _me_. Yes, he did! Many a time, when you\nwere put off with a slight word, he has taken Me to his heart!\"\n\nShe said it with a taunting pride in the midst of her frenzy--for it was\nlittle less--yet with an eager remembrance of it, in which the\nsmouldering embers of a gentler feeling kindled for the moment.\n\n\"I descended--as I might have known I should, but that he fascinated me\nwith his boyish courtship--into a doll, a trifle for the occupation of\nan idle hour, to be dropped, and taken up, and trifled with, as the\ninconstant humour took him. When he grew weary, I grew weary. As his\nfancy died out, I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I\nhad, than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for\nhis wife. We fell away from one another without a word. Perhaps you saw\nit, and were not sorry. Since then, I have been a mere disfigured piece\nof furniture between you both; having no eyes, no ears, no feelings, no\nremembrances. Moan? Moan for what you made him; not for your love. I\ntell you that the time was, when I loved him better than you ever did!\"\n\nShe stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare, and the\nset face; and softened no more, when the moaning was repeated, than if\nthe face had been a picture.\n\n\"Miss Dartle,\" said I, \"if you can be so obdurate as not to feel for\nthis afflicted mother----\"\n\n\"Who feels for me?\" she sharply retorted. \"She has sown this. Let her\nmoan for the harvest that she reaps to-day!\"\n\n\"And if his faults----\" I began.\n\n\"Faults!\" she cried, bursting into passionate tears. \"Who dares malign\nhim? He had a soul worth millions of the friends to whom he stooped!\"\n\n\"No one can have loved him better, no one can hold him in dearer\nremembrance, than I,\" I replied. \"I meant to say, if you have no\ncompassion for his mother; or if his faults--you have been bitter on\nthem----\"\n\n\"It's false,\" she cried, tearing her black hair; \"I loved him!\"\n\n\"--cannot,\" I went on, \"be banished from your remembrance, in such an\nhour; look at that figure, even as one you have never seen before, and\nrender it some help!\"\n\nAll this time, the figure was unchanged, and looked unchangeable.\nMotionless, rigid, staring; moaning in the same dumb way from time to\ntime, with the same helpless motion of the head; but giving no other\nsign of life. Miss Dartle suddenly kneeled down before it, and began to\nloosen the dress.\n\n\"A curse upon you!\" she said, looking round at me, with a mingled\nexpression of rage and grief. \"It was in an evil hour that you ever came\nhere! A curse upon you! Go!\"\n\nAfter passing out of the room, I hurried back to ring the bell, the\nsooner to alarm the servants. She had then taken the impassive figure in\nher arms, and, still upon her knees, was weeping over it, kissing it,\ncalling to it, rocking it to and fro upon her bosom like a child, and\ntrying every tender means to rouse the dormant senses. No longer afraid\nof leaving her, I noiselessly turned back again; and alarmed the house\nas I went out.\n\nLater in the day, I returned, and we laid him in his mother's room. She\nwas just the same, they told me; Miss Dartle never left her; doctors\nwere in attendance, many things had been tried; but she lay like a\nstatue, except for the low sound now and then.\n\nI went through the dreary house, and darkened the windows. The windows\nof the chamber where he lay, I darkened last. I lifted up the leaden\nhand, and held it to my heart; and all the world seemed death and\nsilence, broken only by his mother's moaning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nTHE EMIGRANTS.\n\n\nOne thing more, I had to do, before yielding myself to the shock of\nthese emotions. It was, to conceal what had occurred, from those who\nwere going away; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance.\nIn this, no time was to be lost.\n\nI took Mr. Micawber aside that same night, and confided to him the task\nof standing between Mr. Peggotty and intelligence of the late\ncatastrophe. He zealously undertook to do so, and to intercept any\nnewspaper through which it might, without such precautions, reach him.\n\n\"If it penetrates to him, sir,\" said Mr. Micawber, striking himself on\nthe breast, \"it shall first pass through this body!\"\n\nMr. Micawber, I must observe, in his adaptation of himself to a new\nstate of society, had acquired a bold buccaneering air, not absolutely\nlawless, but defensive and prompt. One might have supposed him a child\nof the wilderness, long accustomed to live out of the confines of\ncivilisation, and about to return to his native wilds.\n\nHe had provided himself, among other things, with a complete suit of\noil-skin, and a straw-hat with a very low crown, pitched or caulked on\nthe outside. In this rough clothing, with a common mariner's telescope\nunder his arm, and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as\nlooking out for dirty weather, he was far more nautical, after his\nmanner, than Mr. Peggotty. His whole family, if I may so express it,\nwere cleared for action. I found Mrs. Micawber in the closest and most\nuncompromising of bonnets, made fast under the chin; and in a shawl\nwhich tied her up (as I had been tied up, when my aunt first received\nme) like a bundle, and was secured behind at the waist, in a strong\nknot. Miss Micawber I found made snug for stormy weather, in the same\nmanner; with nothing superfluous about her. Master Micawber was hardly\nvisible in a Guernsey shirt, and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever saw;\nand the children were done up, like preserved meats, in impervious\ncases. Both Mr. Micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely\nturned back at the wrists, as being ready to lend a hand in any\ndirection, and to \"tumble up,\" or sing out, \"Yeo--Heave--Yeo!\" on the\nshortest notice.\n\nThus Traddles and I found them at nightfall, assembled on the wooden\nsteps, at that time known as Hungerford Stairs, watching the departure\nof a boat with some of their property on board. I had told Traddles of\nthe terrible event, and it had greatly shocked him; but there could be\nno doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret, and he had come to help\nme in this last service. It was here that I took Mr. Micawber aside, and\nreceived his promise.\n\nThe Micawber family were lodged in a little, dirty, tumble-down\npublic-house, which in those days was close to the stairs, and whose\nprotruding wooden rooms overhung the river. The family, as emigrants,\nbeing objects of some interest in and about Hungerford, attracted so\nmany beholders, that we were glad to take refuge in their room. It was\none of the wooden chambers up-stairs, with the tide flowing underneath.\nMy aunt and Agnes were there, busily making some little extra comforts,\nin the way of dress, for the children. Peggotty was quietly assisting,\nwith the old insensible work-box, yard measure, and bit of wax-candle\nbefore her, that had now outlived so much.\n\nIt was not easy to answer her inquiries; still less to whisper Mr.\nPeggotty, when Mr. Micawber brought him in, that I had given the letter,\nand all was well. But I did both, and made them happy. If I showed any\ntrace of what I felt, my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it.\n\n\"And when does the ship sail, Mr. Micawber?\" asked my aunt.\n\nMr. Micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt or his\nwife, by degrees, and said, sooner than he had expected yesterday.\n\n\"The boat brought you word, I suppose?\" said my aunt.\n\n\"It did, ma'am,\" he returned.\n\n\"Well?\" said my aunt. \"And she sails--\"\n\n\"Madam,\" he replied, \"I am informed that we must positively be on board\nbefore seven to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Heyday!\" said my aunt, \"that's soon. Is it a sea-going fact, Mr.\nPeggotty?\"\n\n\"'Tis so, ma'am. She'll drop down the river with that theer tide. If\nMas'r Davy and my sister comes aboard at Gravesen', arternoon o' next\nday, they'll see the last on us.\"\n\n\"And that we shall do,\" said I, \"be sure!\"\n\n\"Until then, and until we are at sea,\" observed Mr. Micawber, with a\nglance of intelligence at me, \"Mr. Peggotty and myself will constantly\nkeep a double look-out together, on our goods and chattels. Emma, my\nlove,\" said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat in his magnificent way,\n\"my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles is so obliging as to solicit, in my ear,\nthat he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary\nto the composition of a moderate portion of that Beverage which is\npeculiarly associated, in our minds, with the Roast Beef of old England.\nI allude to--in short, Punch. Under ordinary circumstances, I should\nscruple to entreat the indulgence of Miss Trotwood and Miss Wickfield,\nbut----\"\n\n\"I can only say for myself,\" said my aunt, \"that I will drink all\nhappiness and success to you, Mr. Micawber, with the utmost pleasure.\"\n\n\"And I too!\" said Agnes, with a smile.\n\nMr. Micawber immediately descended to the bar, where he appeared to\nbe quite at home; and in due time returned with a steaming jug. I\ncould not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own\nclasp-knife, which, as became the knife of a practical settler, was\nabout a foot long; and which he wiped, not wholly without ostentation,\non the sleeve of his coat. Mrs. Micawber and the two elder members\nof the family I now found to be provided with similar formidable\ninstruments, while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its\nbody by a strong line. In a similar anticipation of life afloat, and in\nthe Bush, Mr. Micawber, instead of helping Mrs. Micawber and his eldest\nson and daughter to punch, in wine-glasses, which he might easily have\ndone, for there was a shelf-full in the room, served it out to them\nin a series of villainous little tin pots; and I never saw him enjoy\nanything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot, and\nputting it in his pocket at the close of the evening.\n\n\"The luxuries of the old country,\" said Mr. Micawber, with an intense\nsatisfaction in their renouncement, \"we abandon. The denizens of the\nforest cannot, of course, expect to participate in the refinements of\nthe land of the Free.\"\n\nHere, a boy came in to say that Mr. Micawber was wanted down-stairs.\n\n\"I have a presentiment,\" said Mrs. Micawber, setting down her tin pot,\n\"that it is a member of my family!\"\n\n\"If so, my dear,\" observed Mr. Micawber, with his usual suddenness of\nwarmth on that subject, \"as the member of your family--whoever he, she,\nor it, may be--has kept _us_ waiting for a considerable period, perhaps\nthe Member may now wait _my_ convenience.\"\n\n\"Micawber,\" said his wife, in a low tone, \"at such a time as this--\"\n\n\"'It is not meet,'\" said Mr. Micawber, rising, \"'that every nice offence\nshould bear its comment!' Emma, I stand reproved.\"\n\n\"The loss, Micawber,\" observed his wife, \"has been my family's, not\nyours. If my family are at length sensible of the deprivation to which\ntheir own conduct has, in the past, exposed them, and now desire to\nextend the hand of fellowship, let it not be repulsed.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he returned, \"so be it!\"\n\n\"If not for their sakes; for mine, Micawber,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Emma,\" he returned, \"that view of the question is, at such a moment,\nirresistible. I cannot, even now, distinctly pledge myself to fall upon\nyour family's neck; but the member of your family, who is now in\nattendance, shall have no genial warmth frozen by me.\"\n\nMr. Micawber withdrew, and was absent some little time; in the course\nof which Mrs. Micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that\nwords might have arisen between him and the Member. At length the same\nboy re-appeared, and presented me with a note written in pencil, and\nheaded, in a legal manner, \"Heep v. Micawber.\" From this document,\nI learned that Mr. Micawber, being again arrested, was in a final\nparoxysm of despair; and that he begged me to send him his knife and\npint pot, by bearer, as they might prove serviceable during the brief\nremainder of his existence, in jail. He also requested, as a last act\nof friendship, that I would see his family to the Parish Workhouse, and\nforget that such a Being ever lived.\n\nOf course I answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the\nmoney, where I found Mr. Micawber sitting in a corner, looking darkly at\nthe Sheriff's Officer who had effected the capture. On his release, he\nembraced me with the utmost fervor; and made an entry of the transaction\nin his pocket-book--being very particular, I recollect, about a\nhalfpenny I inadvertently omitted from my statement of the total.\n\nThis momentous pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another\ntransaction. On our return to the room upstairs (where he accounted for\nhis absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances over\nwhich he had no control), he took out of it a large sheet of paper,\nfolded small, and quite covered with long sums, carefully worked. From\nthe glimpse I had of them, I should say that I never saw such sums out\nof a school cyphering-book. These, it seemed, were calculations of\ncompound interest on what he called \"the principal amount of forty-one,\nten, eleven and a half,\" for various periods. After a careful\nconsideration of these, and an elaborate estimate of his resources, he\nhad come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the\namount with compound interest to two years, fifteen calendar months, and\nfourteen days, from that date. For this he had drawn a note of-hand with\ngreat neatness, which he handed over to Traddles on the spot, a\ndischarge of his debt in full (as between man and man), with many\nacknowledgments.\n\n\"I have still a presentiment,\" said Mrs. Micawber, pensively shaking her\nhead, \"that my family will appear on board, before we finally depart.\"\n\nMr. Micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too, but he\nput it in his tin pot and swallowed it.\n\n\"If you have any opportunity of sending letters home, on your passage,\nMrs. Micawber,\" said my aunt, \"you must let us hear from you, you know.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Trotwood,\" she replied, \"I shall only be too happy to\nthink that anyone expects to hear from us. I shall not fail to\ncorrespond. Mr. Copperfield, I trust, as an old and familiar friend,\nwill not object to receive occasional intelligence, himself, from one\nwho knew him when the twins were yet unconscious?\"\n\nI said that I should hope to hear, whenever she had an opportunity of\nwriting.\n\n\"Please Heaven, there will be many such opportunities,\" said Mr.\nMicawber. \"The ocean, in these times, is a perfect fleet of ships; and\nwe can hardly fail to encounter many, in running over. It is merely\ncrossing,\" said Mr. Micawber, trifling with his eye-glass, \"merely\ncrossing. The distance is quite imaginary.\"\n\nI think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber,\nthat, when he went from London to Canterbury, he should have talked as\nif he were going to the farthest limits of the earth; and, when he went\nfrom England to Australia, as if he were going for a little trip across\nthe channel.\n\n\"On the voyage, I shall endeavour,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"occasionally\nto spin them a yarn; and the melody of my son Wilkins will, I\ntrust, be acceptable at the galley-fire. When Mrs. Micawber has her\nsea-legs on--an expression in which I hope there is no conventional\nimpropriety--she will give them, I dare say, Little Tafflin. Porpoises\nand dolphins, I believe, will be frequently observed athwart our Bows;\nand, either on the Starboard or the Larboard Quarter, objects of\ninterest will be continually descried. In short,\" said Mr. Micawber,\nwith the old genteel air, \"the probability is, all will be found so\nexciting, alow and aloft, that when the look-out, stationed in the\nmain-top, cries Land-ho! we shall be very considerably astonished!\"\n\nWith that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot, as if he\nhad made the voyage, and had passed a first-class examination before the\nhighest naval authorities.\n\n\"What _I_ chiefly hope, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber,\n\"is, that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old\ncountry. Do not frown, Micawber! I do not now refer to my own family,\nbut to our children's children. However vigorous the sapling,\" said Mrs.\nMicawber, shaking her head, \"I cannot forget the parent-tree; and when\nour race attains to eminence and fortune, I own I should wish that\nfortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Micawber, \"Britannia must take her chance. I am\nbound to say that she has never done much for me, and that I have no\nparticular wish upon the subject.\"\n\n\"Micawber,\" returned Mrs. Micawber, \"there, you are wrong. You are going\nout, Micawber, to this distant clime, to strengthen, not to weaken, the\nconnexion between yourself and Albion.\"\n\n\"The connexion in question, my love,\" rejoined Mr. Micawber, \"has not\nlaid me, I repeat, under that load of personal obligation, that I am at\nall sensitive as to the formation of another connexion.\"\n\n\"Micawber,\" returned Mrs. Micawber. \"There, I again say, you are wrong.\nYou do not know your power, Micawber. It is that which will strengthen,\neven in this step you are about to take, the connexion between yourself\nand Albion.\"\n\nMr. Micawber sat in his elbow-chair, with his eyebrows raised; half\nreceiving and half repudiating Mrs. Micawber's views as they were\nstated, but very sensible of their foresight.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Copperfield,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"I wish Mr. Micawber to\nfeel his position. It appears to me highly important that Mr. Micawber\nshould, from the hour of his embarkation, feel his position. Your old\nknowledge of me, my dear Mr. Copperfield, will have told you that I have\nnot the sanguine disposition of Mr. Micawber. My disposition is, if I\nmay say so, eminently practical. I know that this is a long voyage. I\nknow that it will involve many privations and inconveniences. I cannot\nshut my eyes to those facts. But, I also know what Mr. Micawber is. I\nknow the latent power of Mr. Micawber. And therefore I consider it\nvitally important that Mr. Micawber should feel his position.\"\n\n\"My love,\" he observed, \"perhaps you will allow me to remark that it is\nbarely possible that I _do_ feel my position at the present moment.\"\n\n\"I think not, Micawber,\" she rejoined. \"Not fully. My dear Mr.\nCopperfield, Mr. Micawber's is not a common case. Mr. Micawber is going\nto a distant country, expressly in order that he may be fully understood\nand appreciated for the first time. I wish Mr. Micawber to take his\nstand upon that vessel's prow, and firmly say 'This country I am come to\nconquer! Have you honours? Have you riches? Have you posts of profitable\npecuniary emolument? Let them be brought forward. They are mine!'\"\n\nMr. Micawber, glancing at us all, seemed to think there was a good deal\nin this idea.\n\n\"I wish Mr. Micawber, if I make myself understood,\" said Mrs. Micawber,\nin her argumentative tone, \"to be the C\u00c3\u00a6sar of his own fortunes. That,\nmy dear Mr. Copperfield, appears to me to be his true position. From the\nfirst moment of this voyage, I wish Mr. Micawber to stand upon that\nvessel's prow and say, 'Enough of delay: enough of disappointment:\nenough of limited means. That was in the old country. This is the new.\nProduce your reparation. Bring it forward!'\"\n\nMr. Micawber folded his arms, in a resolute manner, as if he were then\nstationed on the figure-head.\n\n\"And doing that,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"--feeling his position--am I not\nright in saying that Mr. Micawber will strengthen, and not weaken, his\nconnexion with Britain? An important public character arising in that\nhemisphere, shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at home?\nCan I be so weak as to imagine that Mr. Micawber, wielding the rod of\ntalent and of power in Australia, will be nothing in England? I am but a\nwoman; but I should be unworthy of myself, and of my papa, if I were\nguilty of such absurd weakness.\"\n\nMrs. Micawber's conviction that her arguments were unanswerable, gave a\nmoral elevation to her tone which I think I had never heard in it\nbefore.\n\n\"And therefore it is,\" said Mrs. Micawber, \"that I the more wish, that,\nat a future period, we may live again on the parent soil. Mr. Micawber\nmay be--I cannot disguise from myself that the probability is, Mr.\nMicawber will be--a page of History; and he ought then to be represented\nin the country which gave him birth, and did _not_ give him employment!\"\n\n\"My love,\" observed Mr. Micawber, \"it is impossible for me not to be\ntouched by your affection. I am always willing to defer to your good\nsense. What will be--will be. Heaven forbid that I should grudge my\nnative country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our\ndescendants!\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said my aunt, nodding towards Mr. Peggotty, \"and I drink\nmy love to you all, and every blessing and success attend you!\"\n\nMr. Peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing, one on each\nknee, to join Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in drinking to all of us in return;\nand when he and the Micawbers cordially shook hands as comrades, and his\nbrown face brightened with a smile, I felt that he would make his way,\nestablish a good name, and be beloved, go where he would.\n\nEven the children were instructed, each to dip a wooden spoon into Mr.\nMicawber's pot, and pledge us in its contents. When this was done, my\naunt and Agnes rose, and parted from the emigrants. It was a sorrowful\nfarewell. They were all crying; the children hung about Agnes to the\nlast; and we left poor Mrs. Micawber in a very distressed condition,\nsobbing and weeping by a dim candle, that must have made the room look,\nfrom the river, like a miserable light-house.\n\nI went down again next morning to see that they were away. They had\ndeparted, in a boat, as early as five o'clock. It was a wonderful\ninstance to me of the gap such partings make, that although my\nassociation of them with the tumble-down public-house and the wooden\nstairs dated only from last night, both seemed dreary and deserted, now\nthat they were gone.\n\nIn the afternoon of the next day, my old nurse and I went down to\nGravesend. We found the ship in the river, surrounded by a crowd of\nboats; a favourable wind blowing; the signal for sailing at her mast\nhead. I hired a boat directly, and we put off to her; and getting\nthrough the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre, went\non board.\n\nMr. Peggotty was waiting for us on deck. He told me that Mr. Micawber\nhad just now been arrested again (and for the last time) at the suit of\nHeep, and that, in compliance with a request I had made to him, he had\npaid the money: which I repaid him. He then took us down between decks;\nand there, any lingering fears I had of his having heard any rumours of\nwhat had happened, were dispelled by Mr. Micawber's coming out of the\ngloom, taking his arm with an air of friendship and protection, and\ntelling me that they had scarcely been asunder for a moment, since the\nnight before last.\n\nIt was such a strange scene to me, and so confined and dark, that, at\nfirst, I could make out hardly anything; but, by degrees, it cleared, as\nmy eyes became more accustomed to the gloom, and I seemed to stand in a\npicture by OSTADE. Among the great beams, bulks, and ringbolts of the\nship, and the emigrant-berths, and chests, and bundles, and barrels, and\nheaps of miscellaneous baggage--lighted up, here and there, by dangling\nlanterns; and elsewhere by the yellow day-light straying down a windsail\nor a hatchway--were crowded groups of people, making new friendships,\ntaking leave of one another, talking, laughing, crying, eating and\ndrinking; some, already settled down into the possession of their few\nfeet of space, with their little households arranged, and tiny children\nestablished on stools, or in dwarf elbow-chairs; others, despairing of a\nresting-place, and wandering disconsolately. From babies who had but a\nweek or two of life behind them, to crooked old men and women who seemed\nto have but a week or two of life before them; and from ploughmen bodily\ncarrying out soil of England on their boots, to smiths taking away\nsamples of its soot and smoke upon their skins; every age and occupation\nappeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the 'tween decks.\n\n  [Illustration: The Emigrants.]\n\nAs my eye glanced round this place, I thought I saw sitting, by an open\nport, with one of the Micawber children near her, a figure like Emily's;\nit first attracted my attention, by another figure parting from it with\na kiss; and as it glided calmly away through the disorder, reminding me\nof--Agnes! But in the rapid motion and confusion, and in the\nunsettlement of my own thoughts, I lost it again; and only knew that the\ntime was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship;\nthat my nurse was crying on a chest beside me; and that Mrs. Gummidge,\nassisted by some younger stooping woman in black, was busily arranging\nMr. Peggotty's goods.\n\n\"Is there any last wured, Mas'r Davy?\" said he. \"Is there any one\nforgotten thing afore we parts?\"\n\n\"One thing!\" said I. \"Martha!\"\n\nHe touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder, and\nMartha stood before me.\n\n\"Heaven bless you, you good man!\" cried I. \"You take her with you!\"\n\nShe answered for him, with a burst of tears. I could speak no more, at\nthat time, but I wrung his hand; and if ever I have loved and honored\nany man, I loved and honored that man in my soul.\n\nThe ship was clearing fast of strangers. The greatest trial that I had,\nremained. I told him what the noble spirit that was gone, had given me\nin charge to say at parting. It moved him deeply. But when he charged\nme, in return, with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf\nears, he moved me more.\n\nThe time was come. I embraced him, took my weeping nurse upon my arm,\nand hurried away. On deck, I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber. She was\nlooking distractedly about for her family, even then; and her last words\nto me were, that she never would desert Mr. Micawber.\n\nWe went over the side into our boat, and lay at a little distance to see\nthe ship wafted on her course. It was then calm, radiant sunset. She lay\nbetween us, and the red light; and every taper line and spar was visible\nagainst the glow. A sight at once so beautiful, so mournful, and so\nhopeful, as the glorious ship, lying, still, on the flushed water, with\nall the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks, and there clustering,\nfor a moment, bare-headed and silent, I never saw.\n\nSilent, only for a moment. As the sails rose to the wind, and the ship\nbegan to move, there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers,\nwhich those on board took up, and echoed back, and which were echoed and\nre-echoed. My heart burst out when I heard the sound, and beheld the\nwaving of the hats and handkerchiefs--and then I saw her!\n\nThen, I saw her, at her uncle's side, and trembling on his shoulder. He\npointed to us with an eager hand; and she saw us, and waved her last\ngood-bye to me. Aye, Emily, beautiful and drooping, cling to him with\nthe utmost trust of thy bruised heart; for he has clung to thee, with\nall the might of his great love!\n\nSurrounded by the rosy light, and standing high upon the deck, apart\ntogether, she clinging to him, and he holding her, they solemnly passed\naway. The night had fallen on the Kentish hills when we were rowed\nashore--and fallen darkly upon me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nABSENCE.\n\n\nIt was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me, haunted by the\nghosts of many hopes, of many dear remembrances, many errors, many\nunavailing sorrows and regrets.\n\nI went away from England; not knowing, even then, how great the shock\nwas, that I had to bear. I left all who were dear to me, and went away;\nand believed that I had borne it, and it was past. As a man upon a field\nof battle will receive a mortal hurt, and scarcely know that he is\nstruck, so I, when I was left alone with my undisciplined heart, had no\nconception of the wound with which it had to strive.\n\nThe knowledge came upon me, not quickly, but little by little, and\ngrain by grain. The desolate feeling with which I went abroad, deepened\nand widened hourly. At first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow,\nwherein I could distinguish little else. By imperceptible degrees,\nit became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost--love,\nfriendship, interest; of all that had been shattered--my first trust,\nmy first affection, the whole airy castle of my life; of all that\nremained--a ruined blank and waste, lying wide around me, unbroken, to\nthe dark horizon.\n\nIf my grief were selfish, I did not know it to be so. I mourned for my\nchild-wife, taken from her blooming world, so young. I mourned for him\nwho might have won the love and admiration of thousands, as he had won\nmine long ago. I mourned for the broken heart that had found rest in the\nstormy sea; and for the wandering remnants of the simple home, where I\nhad heard the night-wind blowing, when I was a child.\n\nFrom the accumulated sadness into which I fell, I had at length no hope\nof ever issuing again. I roamed from place to place, carrying my burden\nwith me everywhere. I felt its whole weight now; and I drooped beneath\nit, and I said in my heart that it could never be lightened.\n\nWhen this despondency was at its worst, I believed that I should die.\nSometimes, I thought that I would like to die at home; and actually\nturned back on my road, that I might get there soon. At other times, I\npassed on farther away, from city to city, seeking I know not what, and\ntrying to leave I know not what behind.\n\nIt is not in my power to retrace, one by one, all the weary phases of\ndistress of mind through which I passed. There are some dreams that can\nonly be imperfectly and vaguely described; and when I oblige myself to\nlook back on this time of my life, I seem to be recalling such a dream.\nI see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign towns, palaces,\ncathedrals, temples, pictures, castles, tombs, fantastic streets--the\nold abiding places of History and Fancy--as a dreamer might; bearing my\npainful load through all, and hardly conscious of the objects as they\nfade before me. Listlessness to everything, but brooding sorrow, was the\nnight that fell on my undisciplined heart. Let me look up from it--as at\nlast I did, thank Heaven!--and from its long, sad, wretched dream, to\ndawn.\n\nFor many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon my mind.\nSome blind reasons that I had for not returning home--reasons then\nstruggling within me, vainly, for more distinct expression--kept me on\nmy pilgrimage. Sometimes, I had proceeded restlessly from place to\nplace, stopping nowhere; sometimes, I had lingered long in one spot. I\nhad had no purpose, no sustaining soul within me, anywhere.\n\nI was in Switzerland. I had come out of Italy, over one of the great\npasses of the Alps, and had since wandered with a guide among the\nbye-ways of the mountains. If those awful solitudes had spoken to my\nheart, I did not know it. I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread\nheights and precipices, in the roaring torrents, and the wastes of ice\nand snow; but as yet, they had taught me nothing else.\n\nI came, one evening before sunset, down into a valley, where I was to\nrest. In the course of my descent to it, by the winding track along\nthe mountain-side, from which I saw it shining far below, I think\nsome long-unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity, some softening\ninfluence awakened by its peace, moved faintly in my breast. I remember\npausing once, with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive, not\nquite despairing. I remember almost hoping that some better change was\npossible within me.\n\nI came into the valley, as the evening sun was shining on the remote\nheights of snow, that closed it in, like eternal clouds. The bases of\nthe mountains forming the gorge in which the little village lay, were\nrichly green; and high above this gentler vegetation, grew forests of\ndark fir, cleaving the wintry snow-drift, wedge-like, and stemming the\navalanche. Above these, were range upon range of craggy steeps, grey\nrock, bright ice, and smooth verdure-specks of pasture, all gradually\nblending with the crowning snow. Dotted here and there on the\nmountain's-side, each tiny dot a home, were lonely wooden cottages, so\ndwarfed by the towering heights that they appeared too small for toys.\nSo did even the clustered village in the valley, with its wooden bridge\nacross the stream, where the stream tumbled over broken rocks, and\nroared away among the trees. In the quiet air, there was a sound of\ndistant singing--shepherd voices; but, as one bright evening cloud\nfloated midway along the mountain's-side, I could almost have believed\nit came from there, and was not earthly music. All at once, in this\nserenity, great Nature spoke to me; and soothed me to lay down my weary\nhead upon the grass, and weep as I had not wept yet, since Dora died!\n\nI had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before,\nand had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was\nmaking ready. Other packets had missed me, and I had received none for a\nlong time. Beyond a line or two, to say that I was well, and had arrived\nat such a place, I had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter\nsince I left home.\n\nThe packet was in my hand. I opened it, and read the writing of Agnes.\n\nShe was happy and useful, was prospering as she had hoped. That was all\nshe told me of herself. The rest referred to me.\n\nShe gave me no advice; she urged no duty on me; she only told me, in her\nown fervent manner, what her trust in me was. She knew (she said) how\nsuch a nature as mine would turn affliction to good. She knew how trial\nand emotion would exalt and strengthen it. She was sure that in my every\npurpose I should gain a firmer and a higher tendency, through the grief\nI had undergone. She, who so gloried in my fame, and so looked forward\nto its augmentation, well knew that I would labor on. She knew that in\nme, sorrow could not be weakness, but must be strength. As the endurance\nof my childish days had done its part to make me what I was, so greater\ncalamities would nerve me on, to be yet better than I was; and so, as\nthey had taught me, would I teach others. She commended me to God, who\nhad taken my innocent darling to His rest; and in her sisterly affection\ncherished me always, and was always at my side go where I would; proud\nof what I had done, but infinitely prouder yet of what I was reserved to\ndo.\n\nI put the letter in my breast, and thought what had I been an hour ago!\nWhen I heard the voices die away, and saw the quiet evening cloud grow\ndim, and all the colors in the valley fade, and the golden snow upon the\nmountain tops become a remote part of the pale night sky, yet felt that\nthe night was passing from my mind, and all its shadows clearing, there\nwas no name for the love I bore her, dearer to me, henceforward, than\never until then.\n\nI read her letter, many times. I wrote to her before I slept. I told her\nthat I had been in sore need of her help; that without her I was not,\nand I never had been, what she thought me; but, that she inspired me to\nbe that, and I would try.\n\nI did try. In three months more, a year would have passed since the\nbeginning of my sorrow. I determined to make no resolutions until the\nexpiration of those three months, but to try. I lived in that valley,\nand its neighbourhood, all the time.\n\nThe three months gone, I resolved to remain away from home for some time\nlonger; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland, which was\ngrowing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening; to resume my pen;\nto work.\n\nI resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me; I sought out Nature,\nnever sought in vain; and I admitted to my breast the human interest I\nhad lately shrunk from. It was not long, before I had almost as many\nfriends in the valley as in Yarmouth; and when I left it, before the\nwinter set in, for Geneva, and came back in the spring, their cordial\ngreetings had a homely sound to me, although they were not conveyed in\nEnglish words.\n\nI worked early and late, patiently and hard. I wrote a Story, with a\npurpose growing, not remotely, out of my experience, and sent it to\nTraddles, and he arranged for its publication very advantageously for\nme; and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach me from\ntravellers whom I encountered by chance. After some rest and change, I\nfell to work, in my old ardent way, on a new fancy, which took strong\npossession of me. As I advanced in the execution of this task, I felt it\nmore and more, and roused my utmost energies to do it well. This was my\nthird work of fiction. It was not half written, when, in an interval of\nrest, I thought of returning home.\n\nFor a long time, though studying and working patiently, I had accustomed\nmyself to robust exercise. My health, severely impaired when I left\nEngland, was quite restored. I had seen much. I had been in many\ncountries, and I hope I had improved my store of knowledge.\n\nI have now recalled all that I think it needful to recal here, of this\nterm of absence--with one reservation. I have made it, thus far, with no\npurpose of suppressing any of my thoughts; for, as I have elsewhere\nsaid, this narrative is my written memory. I have desired to keep the\nmost secret current of my mind apart, and to the last. I enter on it\nnow.\n\nI cannot so completely penetrate the mystery of my own heart, as to know\nwhen I began to think that I might have set its earliest and brightest\nhopes on Agnes. I cannot say at what stage of my grief it first became\nassociated with the reflection, that, in my wayward boyhood, I had\nthrown away the treasure of her love. I believe I may have heard some\nwhisper of that distant thought, in the old unhappy loss or want of\nsomething never to be realised, of which I had been sensible. But the\nthought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret, when I was\nleft so sad and lonely in the world.\n\nIf, at that time, I had been much with her, I should, in the weakness of\nmy desolation, have betrayed this. It was what I remotely dreaded when I\nwas first impelled to stay away from England. I could not have borne to\nlose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection; yet, in that\nbetrayal, I should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown.\n\nI could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded me had\ngrown up in my own free choice and course. That if she had ever loved me\nwith another love--and I sometimes thought the time was when she might\nhave done so--I had cast it away. It was nothing, now, that I had\naccustomed myself to think of her, when we were both mere children, as\none who was far removed from my wild fancies. I had bestowed my\npassionate tenderness upon another object; and what I might have done, I\nhad not done; and what Agnes was to me, I and her own noble heart had\nmade her.\n\nIn the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me, when I tried\nto get a better understanding of myself and be a better man, I did\nglance, through some indefinite probation, to a period when I might\npossibly hope to cancel the mistaken past, and to be so blessed as to\nmarry her. But, as time wore on, this shadowy prospect faded, and\ndeparted from me. If she had ever loved me, then, I should hold her the\nmore sacred; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her, her\nknowledge of my errant heart, the sacrifice she must have made to be my\nfriend and sister, and the victory she had won. If she had never loved\nme, could I believe that she would love me now?\n\nI had always felt my weakness, in comparison with her constancy and\nfortitude; and now I felt it more and more. Whatever I might have been\nto her, or she to me, if I had been more worthy of her long ago, I was\nnot now, and she was not. The time was past. I had let it go by, and had\ndeservedly lost her.\n\nThat I suffered much in these contentions, that they filled me with\nunhappiness and remorse, and yet that I had a sustaining sense that it\nwas required of me, in right and honor, to keep away from myself, with\nshame, the thought of turning to the dear girl in the withering of my\nhopes, from whom I had frivolously turned when they were bright and\nfresh--which consideration was at the root of every thought I had\nconcerning her--is all equally true. I made no effort to conceal from\nmyself, now, that I loved her, that I was devoted to her; but I brought\nthe assurance home to myself, that it was now too late, and that our\nlong-subsisting relation must be undisturbed.\n\nI had thought, much and often, of my Dora's shadowing out to me what\nmight have happened, in those years that were destined not to try us; I\nhad considered how the things that never happen, are often as much\nrealities to us, in their effects, as those that are accomplished. The\nvery years she spoke of, were realities now, for my correction; and\nwould have been, one day, a little later perhaps, though we had parted\nin our earliest folly. I endeavoured to convert what might have been\nbetween myself and Agnes, into a means of making me more self-denying,\nmore resolved, more conscious of myself, and my defects and errors.\nThus, through the reflection that it might have been, I arrived at the\nconviction that it could never be.\n\nThese, with their perplexities and inconsistencies, were the shifting\nquicksands of my mind, from the time of my departure to the time of my\nreturn home, three years afterwards. Three years had elapsed since the\nsailing of the emigrant ship; when, at that same hour of sunset, and in\nthe same place, I stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought me\nhome, looking on the rosy water where I had seen the image of that ship\nreflected.\n\nThree years. Long in the aggregate, though short as they went by. And\nhome was very dear to me, and Agnes too--but she was not mine--she was\nnever to be mine. She might have been, but that was past!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nRETURN.\n\n\nI landed in London on a wintry autumn evening. It was dark and raining,\nand I saw more fog and mud in a minute than I had seen in a year. I\nwalked from the Custom House to the Monument before I found a coach; and\nalthough the very house-fronts, looking on the swollen gutters, were\nlike old friends to me, I could not but admit that they were very dingy\nfriends.\n\nI have often remarked--I suppose everybody has--that one's going away\nfrom a familiar place, would seem to be the signal for change in it. As\nI looked out of the coach-window, and observed that an old house on\nFish-street Hill, which had stood untouched by painter, carpenter, or\nbricklayer, for a century, had been pulled down in my absence; and that\na neighbouring street, of time-honored insalubrity and inconvenience,\nwas being drained and widened; I half expected to find St. Paul's\nCathedral looking older.\n\nFor some changes in the fortunes of my friends, I was prepared. My aunt\nhad long been re-established at Dover, and Traddles had begun to get\ninto some little practice at the Bar, in the very first term after my\ndeparture. He had chambers in Gray's Inn, now; and had told me, in his\nlast letters, that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the\ndearest girl in the world.\n\nThey expected me home before Christmas; but had no idea of my returning\nso soon. I had purposely misled them, that I might have the pleasure of\ntaking them by surprise. And yet, I was perverse enough to feel a chill\nand disappointment in receiving no welcome, and rattling, alone and\nsilent, through the misty streets.\n\nThe well-known shops, however, with their cheerful lights, did something\nfor me; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray's Inn Coffee-house,\nI had recovered my spirits. It recalled, at first, that so-different\ntime when I had put up at the Golden Cross, and reminded me of the\nchanges that had come to pass since then; but that was natural.\n\n\"Do you know where Mr. Traddles lives in the Inn?\" I asked the waiter,\nas I warmed myself by the coffee-room fire.\n\n\"Holborn Court, sir. Number two.\"\n\n\"Mr. Traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers, I believe?\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returned the waiter, \"probably he has, sir; but I am not\naware of it myself.\"\n\nThis waiter, who was middle-aged and spare, looked for help to a waiter\nof more authority--a stout, potential old man, with a double-chin, in\nblack breeches and stockings, who came out of a place like a\nchurchwarden's pew, at the end of the coffee-room, where he kept company\nwith a cash-box, a Directory, a Law-list, and other books and papers.\n\n\"Mr. Traddles,\" said the spare waiter. \"Number two in the Court.\"\n\nThe potential waiter waved him away, and turned, gravely, to me.\n\n\"I was inquiring,\" said I, \"whether Mr. Traddles at number two in the\nCourt, has not a rising reputation among the lawyers?\"\n\n\"Never heard his name,\" said the waiter, in a rich husky voice.\n\nI felt quite apologetic for Traddles.\n\n\"He's a young man, sure?\" said the portentous waiter, fixing his eyes\nseverely on me. \"How long has he been in the Inn?\"\n\n\"Not above three years,\" said I.\n\nThe waiter, who I supposed had lived in his churchwarden's pew for forty\nyears, could not pursue such an insignificant subject. He asked me what\nI would have for dinner?\n\nI felt I was in England again, and really was quite cast down on\nTraddles's account. There seemed to be no hope for him. I meekly ordered\na bit of fish and a steak, and stood before the fire musing on his\nobscurity.\n\nAs I followed the chief waiter with my eyes, I could not help thinking\nthat the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he\nwas, was an arduous place to rise in. It had such a prescriptive,\nstiff-necked, long-established, solemn, elderly air. I glanced about\nthe room, which had had its sanded floor sanded, no doubt, in exactly\nthe same manner when the chief waiter was a boy--if he ever was a\nboy, which appeared improbable; and at the shining tables, where\nI saw myself reflected, in unruffled depths of old mahogany; and\nat the lamps, without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning; and at\nthe comfortable green curtains, with their pure brass rods, snugly\nenclosing the boxes; and at the two large coal fires, brightly burning;\nand at the rows of decanters, burly as if with the consciousness of\npipes of expensive old port wine below; and both England, and the law,\nappeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken by storm. I went\nup to my bed-room to change my wet clothes; and the vast extent of that\nold wainscotted apartment (which was over the archway leading to the\nInn, I remember), and the sedate immensity of the four-post bedstead,\nand the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers, all seemed to\nunite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of Traddles, or on any such\ndaring youth. I came down again to my dinner; and even the slow comfort\nof the meal, and the orderly silence of the place--which was bare of\nguests, the Long Vacation not yet being over--were eloquent on the\naudacity of Traddles, and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty\nyears to come.\n\nI had seen nothing like this since I went away, and it quite dashed my\nhopes for my friend. The chief waiter had had enough of me. He came near\nme no more; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters, to\nmeet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its\nown accord, for he gave no order. The second waiter informed me, in a\nwhisper, that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the\nSquare, and worth a mint of money, which it was expected he would leave\nto his laundress's daughter; likewise that it was rumoured that he had a\nservice of plate in a bureau, all tarnished with lying by, though more\nthan one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by\nmortal vision. By this time, I quite gave Traddles up for lost; and\nsettled in my own mind that there was no hope for him.\n\nBeing very anxious to see the dear old fellow, nevertheless, I\ndespatched my dinner; in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in\nthe opinion of the chief waiter, and hurried out by the back way. Number\ntwo in the Court was soon reached; and an inscription on the door-post\ninforming me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top\nstory, I ascended the staircase. A crazy old staircase I found it to be,\nfeebly lighted on each landing by a club-headed little oil wick, dying\naway in a little dungeon of dirty glass.\n\nIn the course of my stumbling up stairs, I fancied I heard a pleasant\nsound of laughter; and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister, or\nattorney's clerk or barrister's clerk, but of two or three merry girls.\nHappening, however, as I stopped to listen, to put my foot in a hole\nwhere the Honorable Society of Gray's Inn had left a plank deficient, I\nfell down with some noise, and when I recovered my footing all was\nsilent.\n\nGroping my way more carefully, for the rest of the journey, my heart\nbeat high when I found the outer door, which had MR. TRADDLES painted on\nit, open. I knocked. A considerable scuffling within ensued, but nothing\nelse. I therefore knocked again.\n\nA small sharp-looking lad, half-footboy and half-clerk, who was very\nmuch out of breath, but who looked at me as if he defied me to prove it\nlegally, presented himself.\n\n\"Is Mr. Traddles within?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, sir, but he's engaged.\"\n\n\"I want to see him.\"\n\nAfter a moment's survey of me, the sharp-looking lad decided to let me\nin; and opening the door wider for that purpose, admitted me, first,\ninto a little closet of a hall, and next into a little sitting-room;\nwhere I came into the presence of my old friend (also out of breath),\nseated at a table, and bending over papers.\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Traddles, looking up. \"It's Copperfield!\" and rushed\ninto my arms, where I held him tight.\n\n\"All well, my dear Traddles?\"\n\n\"All well, my dear, dear Copperfield, and nothing but good news!\"\n\nWe cried with pleasure, both of us.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Traddles, rumpling his hair in his excitement,\nwhich was a most unnecessary operation, \"my dearest Copperfield, my\nlong-lost and most welcome friend, how glad I am to see you! How brown\nyou are! How glad I am! Upon my life and honor, I never was so rejoiced,\nmy beloved Copperfield, never!\"\n\nI was equally at a loss to express my emotions. I was quite unable to\nspeak, at first.\n\n\"My dear fellow!\" said Traddles. \"And grown so famous! My glorious\nCopperfield! Good gracious me, _when_ did you come, _where_ have you\ncome from, _what_ have you been doing?\"\n\nNever pausing for an answer to anything he said, Traddles, who had\nclapped me into an easy chair by the fire, all this time impetuously\nstirred the fire with one hand, and pulled at my neck-kerchief with the\nother, under some wild delusion that it was a great coat. Without\nputting down the poker, he now hugged me again; and I hugged him; and,\nboth laughing, and both wiping our eyes, we both sat down, and shook\nhands across the hearth.\n\n\"To think,\" said Traddles, \"that you should have been so nearly coming\nhome as you must have been, my dear old boy, and not at the ceremony!\"\n\n\"What ceremony, my dear Traddles?\"\n\n\"Good gracious me!\" cried Traddles, opening his eyes in his old way.\n\"Didn't you get my last letter?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, if it referred to any ceremony.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear Copperfield,\" said Traddles, sticking his hair upright\nwith both hands, and then putting his hands on my knees, \"I am married!\"\n\n\"Married!\" I cried, joyfully!\n\n\"Lord bless me, yes!\" said Traddles--\"by the Reverend Horace--to\nSophy--down in Devonshire. Why, my dear boy, she's behind the window\ncurtain! Look here!\"\n\nTo my amazement, the dearest girl in the world came at that same\ninstant, laughing and blushing, from her place of concealment. And a\nmore cheerful, amiable, honest, happy, bright-looking bride, I believe\n(as I could not help saying on the spot) the world never saw. I kissed\nher as an old acquaintance should, and wished them joy with all my might\nof heart.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Traddles, \"what a delightful re-union this is! You are\nso extremely brown, my dear Copperfield! God bless my soul, how happy I\nam!\"\n\n\"And so am I,\" said I.\n\n\"And I am sure I am!\" said the blushing and laughing Sophy.\n\n\"We are all as happy as possible!\" said Traddles. \"Even the girls are\nhappy. Dear me, I declare I forgot them!\"\n\n\"Forgot?\" said I.\n\n\"The girls,\" said Traddles. \"Sophy's sisters. They are staying with us.\nThey have come to have a peep at London. The fact is, when--was it you\nthat tumbled up stairs, Copperfield?\"\n\n\"It was,\" said I, laughing.\n\n\"Well then, when you tumbled up stairs,\" said Traddles, \"I was romping\nwith the girls. In point of fact, we were playing at Puss in the Corner.\nBut as that wouldn't do in Westminster Hall, and as it wouldn't look\nquite professional if they were seen by a client, they decamped. And\nthey are now--listening, I have no doubt,\" said Traddles, glancing at\nthe door of another room.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said I, laughing afresh, \"to have occasioned such a\ndispersion.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" rejoined Traddles, greatly delighted, \"if you had seen\nthem running away, and running back again, after you had knocked, to\npick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair, and going on in\nthe maddest manner, you wouldn't have said so. My love, will you fetch\nthe girls?\"\n\nSophy tripped away, and we heard her received in the adjoining room with\na peal of laughter.\n\n\"Really musical, isn't it, my dear Copperfield?\" said Traddles. \"It's\nvery agreeable to hear. It quite lights up these old rooms. To an\nunfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life, you\nknow, it's positively delicious. It's charming. Poor things, they have\nhad a great loss in Sophy--who, I do assure you, Copperfield, is, and\never was, the dearest girl!--and it gratifies me beyond expression to\nfind them in such good spirits. The society of girls is a very\ndelightful thing, Copperfield. It's not professional, but it's very\ndelightful.\"\n\nObserving that he slightly faltered, and comprehending that in the\ngoodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he\nhad said, I expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently\nrelieved and pleased him greatly.\n\n\"But then,\" said Traddles, \"our domestic arrangements are, to say the\ntruth, quite unprofessional altogether, my dear Copperfield. Even\nSophy's being here, is unprofessional. And we have no other place of\nabode. We have put to sea in a cockboat, but we are quite prepared to\nrough it. And Sophy's an extraordinary manager! You'll be surprised how\nthose girls are stowed away. I am sure I hardly know how it's done.\"\n\n\"Are many of the young ladies with you?\" I inquired.\n\n\"The eldest, the Beauty is here,\" said Traddles, in a low confidential\nvoice, \"Caroline. And Sarah's here--the one I mentioned to you as having\nsomething the matter with her spine, you know. Immensely better! And the\ntwo youngest that Sophy educated are with us. And Louisa's here.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" cried I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Traddles. \"Now the whole set--I mean the chambers--is only\nthree rooms; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way,\nand they sleep as comfortably as possible. Three in that room,\" said\nTraddles, pointing. \"Two in that.\"\n\nI could not help glancing round, in search of the accommodation\nremaining for Mr. and Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me.\n\n\"Well!\" said Traddles, \"we are prepared to rough it, as I said just now;\nand we _did_ improvise a bed last week, upon the floor here. But there's\na little room in the roof--a very nice room, when you're up there--which\nSophy papered herself, to surprise me; and that's our room at present.\nIt's a capital little gipsey sort of place. There's quite a view from\nit.\"\n\n\"And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles!\" said I. \"How\nrejoiced I am!\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear Copperfield,\" said Traddles, as we shook hands once\nmore. \"Yes, I am as happy as it's possible to be. There's your old\nfriend, you see,\" said Traddles, nodding triumphantly at the flower-pot\nand stand; \"and there's the table with the marble top! All the other\nfurniture is plain and serviceable, you perceive. And as to plate, Lord\nbless you, we haven't so much as a tea-spoon.\"\n\n\"All to be earned?\" said I, cheerfully.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied Traddles, \"all to be earned. Of course we have\nsomething in the shape of tea-spoons, because we stir our tea. But\nthey're Britannia metal.\"\n\n\"The silver will be the brighter when it comes,\" said I.\n\n\"The very thing we say!\" cried Traddles. \"You see, my dear Copperfield,\"\nfalling again into the low confidential tone, \"after I had delivered my\nargument in DOE _dem_ JIPES _versus_ WIGZELL, which did me great service\nwith the profession, I went down into Devonshire, and had some serious\nconversation in private with the Reverend Horace. I dwelt upon the fact\nthat Sophy--who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the dearest girl!----\"\n\n\"I am certain she is!\" said I.\n\n\"She is, indeed!\" rejoined Traddles. \"But I am afraid I am wandering\nfrom the subject. Did I mention the Reverend Horace?\"\n\n\"You said that you dwelt upon the fact----\"\n\n\"True! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long\nperiod, and that Sophy, with the permission of her parents, was more\nthan content to take me--in short,\" said Traddles, with his old frank\nsmile, \"on our present Britannia-metal footing. Very well. I then\nproposed to the Reverend Horace--who is a most excellent clergyman,\nCopperfield, and ought to be a Bishop; or at least ought to have enough\nto live upon, without pinching himself--that if I could turn the corner,\nsay of two hundred and fifty pounds, in one year; and could see my way\npretty clearly to that, or something better, next year; and could\nplainly furnish a little place like this, besides; then, and in that\ncase, Sophy and I should be united. I took the liberty of representing\nthat we had been patient for a good many years; and that the\ncircumstance of Sophy's being extraordinarily useful at home, ought not\nto operate, with her affectionate parents, against her establishment in\nlife--don't you see?\"\n\n\"Certainly it ought not,\" said I.\n\n\"I am glad you think so, Copperfield,\" rejoined Traddles, \"because,\nwithout any imputation on the Reverend Horace, I do think parents, and\nbrothers, and so forth, are sometimes rather selfish in such cases.\nWell! I also pointed out, that my most earnest desire was, to be useful\nto the family; and that if I got on in the world, and anything should\nhappen to him--I refer to the Reverend Horace--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said I.\n\n\"--Or to Mrs. Crewler--it would be the utmost gratification of my\nwishes, to be a parent to the girls. He replied in a most admirable\nmanner, exceedingly flattering to my feelings, and undertook to obtain\nthe consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement. They had a dreadful\ntime of it with her. It mounted from her legs into her chest, and then\ninto her head--\"\n\n\"What mounted?\" I asked.\n\n\"Her grief,\" replied Traddles, with a serious look. \"Her feelings\ngenerally. As I mentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior\nwoman, but has lost the use of her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass her,\nusually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the\nchest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the whole system in\na most alarming manner. However, they brought her through it by\nunremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday\nsix weeks. You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when I\nsaw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction! Mrs.\nCrewler couldn't see me before we left--couldn't forgive me, then, for\ndepriving her of her child--but she is a good creature, and has done so\nsince. I had a delightful letter from her, only this morning.\"\n\n\"And in short, my dear friend,\" said I, \"you feel as blest as you\ndeserve to feel!\"\n\n\"Oh! That's your partiality!\" laughed Traddles. \"But, indeed, I am in a\nmost enviable state. I work hard, and read Law insatiably. I get up at\nfive every morning, and don't mind it at all. I hide the girls in the\nday-time, and make merry with them in the evening. And I assure you I am\nquite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday, which is the day before\nthe first day of Michaelmas Term. But here,\" said Traddles, breaking off\nin his confidence, and speaking aloud, \"_are_ the girls! Mr.\nCopperfield, Miss Crewler--Miss Sarah--Miss Louisa--Margaret and Lucy!\"\n\nThey were a perfect nest of roses; they looked so wholesome and fresh.\nThey were all pretty, and Miss Caroline was very handsome; but there was\na loving, cheerful, fireside quality in Sophy's bright looks, which was\nbetter than that, and which assured me that my friend had chosen well.\nWe all sat round the fire; while the sharp boy, who I now divined had\nlost his breath in putting the papers out, cleared them away again, and\nproduced the tea-things. After that, he retired for the night, shutting\nthe outer-door upon us with a bang. Mrs. Traddles, with perfect pleasure\nand composure beaming from her household eyes, having made the tea, then\nquietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire.\n\nShe had seen Agnes, she told me while she was toasting. \"Tom\" had taken\nher down into Kent for a wedding trip, and there she had seen my aunt,\ntoo; and both my aunt and Agnes were well, and they had all talked of\nnothing but me. \"Tom\" had never had me out of his thoughts, she really\nbelieved, all the time I had been away. \"Tom\" was the authority for\neverything. \"Tom\" was evidently the idol of her life; never to be shaken\non his pedestal by any commotion; always to be believed in, and done\nhomage to with the whole faith of her heart, come what might.\n\nThe deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty,\npleased me very much. I don't know that I thought it very reasonable;\nbut I thought it very delightful, and essentially a part of their\ncharacter. If Traddles ever for an instant missed the teaspoons that\nwere still to be won, I have no doubt it was when he handed the Beauty\nher tea. If his sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion\nagainst any one, I am satisfied it could only have been because she was\nthe Beauty's sister. A few slight indications of a rather petted and\ncapricious manner, which I observed in the Beauty, were manifestly\nconsidered, by Traddles and his wife, as her birthright and natural\nendowment. If she had been born a Queen Bee, and they laboring Bees,\nthey could not have been more satisfied of that.\n\nBut their self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride in these girls, and\ntheir submission of themselves to all their whims, was the pleasantest\nlittle testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see. If\nTraddles were addressed as \"a darling,\" once in the course of that\nevening; and besought to bring something here, or carry something there,\nor take something up, or put something down, or find something, or fetch\nsomething; he was so addressed, by one or other of his sisters-in-law,\nat least twelve times in an hour. Neither could they do anything without\nSophy. Somebody's hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy could put it up.\nSomebody forgot how a particular tune went, and nobody but Sophy could\nhum that tune right. Somebody wanted to recal the name of a place in\nDevonshire, and only Sophy knew it. Something was wanted to be written\nhome, and Sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the\nmorning. Somebody broke down in a piece of knitting, and no one but\nSophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction. They were\nentire mistresses of the place, and Sophy and Traddles waited on them.\nHow many children Sophy could have taken care of in her time, I can't\nimagine; but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that\never was addressed to a child in the English tongue; and she sang dozens\nto order with the clearest little voice in the world, one after another\n(every sister issuing directions for a different tune, and the Beauty\ngenerally striking in last), so that I was quite fascinated. The best of\nall was, that, in the midst of their exactions, all the sisters had a\ngreat tenderness and respect both for Sophy and Traddles. I am sure,\nwhen I took my leave, and Traddles was coming out to walk with me to the\ncoffee-house, I thought I had never seen an obstinate head of hair, or\nany other head of hair, rolling about in such a shower of kisses.\n\nAltogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure,\nfor a long time after I got back and had wished Traddles good night. If\nI had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers, in that\nwithered Gray's Inn, they could not have brightened it half so much. The\nidea of those Devonshire girls, among the dry law-stationers and the\nattornies' offices; and of the tea and toast, and children's songs, in\nthat grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers,\nink-jars, brief and draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, and\nbills of costs; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed\nthat the Sultan's famous family had been admitted on the roll of\nattorneys, and had brought the talking bird, the singing tree, and the\ngolden water into Gray's Inn Hall. Somehow, I found that I had taken\nleave of Traddles for the night, and come back to the coffee-house, with\na great change in my despondency about him. I began to think he would\nget on, in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England.\n\nDrawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think about him\nat my leisure, I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness\nto tracing prospects in the live-coals, and to thinking, as they broke\nand changed, of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had\nmarked my life. I had not seen a coal fire, since I had left England\nthree years ago: though many a wood fire had I watched, as it crumbled\ninto hoary ashes, and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth,\nwhich not inaptly figured to me, in my despondency, my own dead hopes.\n\nI could think of the past now, gravely, but not bitterly; and could\ncontemplate the future in a brave spirit. Home, in its best sense, was\nfor me no more. She in whom I might have inspired a dearer love, I had\ntaught to be my sister. She would marry, and would have new claimants on\nher tenderness; and in doing it, would never know the love for her that\nhad grown up in my heart. It was right that I should pay the forfeit of\nmy headlong passion. What I reaped, I had sown.\n\nI was thinking, And had I truly disciplined my heart to this, and could\nI resolutely bear it, and calmly hold the place in her home which she\nhad calmly held in mine,--when I found my eyes resting on a countenance\nthat might have arisen out of the fire, in its association with my early\nremembrances.\n\nLittle Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted in\nthe very first chapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper in the\nshadow of an opposite corner. He was tolerably stricken in years by this\ntime; but, being a mild, meek, calm little man, had worn so easily, that\nI thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he\nsat in our parlor, waiting for me to be born.\n\nMr. Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago, and I had\nnever seen him since. He sat placidly perusing the newspaper, with his\nlittle head on one side, and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow.\nHe was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to\napologise to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it.\n\nI walked up to where he was sitting, and said, \"How do you do, Mr.\nChillip?\"\n\nHe was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger, and\nreplied, in his slow way, \"I thank you, sir, you are very good. Thank\nyou, sir. I hope _you_ are well.\"\n\n\"You don't remember me?\" said I.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returned Mr. Chillip, smiling very meekly, and shaking his\nhead as he surveyed me, \"I have a kind of an impression that something\nin your countenance is familiar to me, sir; but I couldn't lay my hand\nupon your name, really.\"\n\n\"And yet you knew it, long before I knew it myself,\" I returned.\n\n\"Did I indeed, sir?\" said Mr. Chillip. \"Is it possible that I had the\nhonor, sir, of officiating when----?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried Mr. Chillip. \"But no doubt you are a good deal changed\nsince then, sir?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" observed Mr. Chillip, \"I hope you'll excuse me, if I am\ncompelled to ask the favor of your name?\"\n\nOn my telling him my name, he was really moved. He quite shook hands\nwith me--which was a violent proceeding for him, his usual course being\nto slide a tepid little fish-slice, an inch or two in advance of his\nhip, and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it.\nEven now, he put his hand in his coat pocket as soon as he could\ndisengage it, and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back.\n\n\"Dear me, sir!\" said Mr. Chillip, surveying me with his head on one\nside. \"And it's Mr. Copperfield, is it? Well, sir, I think I should have\nknown you, if I had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you.\nThere's a strong resemblance between you and your poor father, sir.\"\n\n\"I never had the happiness of seeing my father,\" I observed.\n\n\"Very true, sir,\" said Mr. Chillip, in a soothing tone. \"And very much\nto be deplored it was, on all accounts! We are not ignorant, sir,\" said\nMr. Chillip, slowly shaking his little head again, \"down in our part of\nthe country, of your fame. There must be great excitement here, sir,\"\nsaid Mr. Chillip, tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger.\n\"You must find it a trying occupation, sir!\"\n\n\"What is your part of the country now?\" I asked, seating myself near\nhim.\n\n\"I am established within a few miles of Bury St. Edmunds, sir,\" said Mr.\nChillip. \"Mrs. Chillip, coming into a little property in that\nneighbourhood, under her father's will, I bought a practice down there,\nin which you will be glad to hear I am doing well. My daughter is\ngrowing quite a tall lass now, sir,\" said Mr. Chillip, giving his little\nhead another little shake. \"Her mother let down two tucks in her frocks\nonly last week. Such is Time, you see, sir!\"\n\nAs the little man put his now empty glass to his lips, when he made this\nreflection, I proposed to him to have it refilled, and I would keep him\ncompany with another. \"Well, sir,\" he returned in his slow way, \"it's\nmore than I am accustomed to; but I can't deny myself the pleasure of\nyour conversation. It seems but yesterday that I had the honor of\nattending you in the measles. You came through them charmingly, sir!\"\n\nI acknowledged this compliment, and ordered the negus, which was soon\nproduced. \"Quite an uncommon dissipation!\" said Mr. Chillip, stirring\nit, \"but I can't resist so extraordinary an occasion. You have no\nfamily, sir?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I was aware that you sustained a bereavement, sir, some time ago,\" said\nMr. Chillip. \"I heard it from your father-in-law's sister. Very decided\ncharacter there, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said I, \"decided enough. Where did you see her, Mr.\nChillip?\"\n\n\"Are you not aware, sir,\" returned Mr. Chillip, with his placidest\nsmile, \"that your father-in-law is again a neighbour of mine?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"He is indeed, sir!\" said Mr. Chillip. \"Married a young lady of that\npart, with a very good little property, poor thing.--And this action of\nthe brain now, sir? Don't you find it fatigue you?\" said Mr. Chillip,\nlooking at me like an admiring Robin.\n\nI waived that question, and returned to the Murdstones. \"I was aware of\nhis being married again. Do you attend the family?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not regularly. I have been called in,\" he replied. \"Strong\nphrenological development of the organ of firmness, in Mr. Murdstone and\nhis sister, sir.\"\n\nI replied with such an expressive look, that Mr. Chillip was emboldened\nby that, and the negus together, to give his head several short shakes,\nand thoughtfully exclaim, \"Ah, dear me! We remember old times, Mr.\nCopperfield!\"\n\n\"And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are they?\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Mr. Chillip, \"a medical man, being so much in\nfamilies, ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his\nprofession. Still, I must say, they are very severe, sir: both as to\nthis life and the next.\"\n\n\"The next will be regulated without much reference to them, I dare say,\"\nI returned: \"what are they doing as to this?\"\n\nMr. Chillip shook his head, stirred his negus, and sipped it.\n\n\"She was a charming woman, sir!\" he observed in a plaintive manner.\n\n\"The present Mrs. Murdstone?\"\n\n\"A charming woman indeed, sir,\" said Mr. Chillip; \"as amiable, I am\nsure, as it was possible to be! Mrs. Chillip's opinion is, that her\nspirit has been entirely broken since her marriage, and that she is all\nbut melancholy mad. And the ladies,\" observed Mr. Chillip, timorously,\n\"are great observers, sir.\"\n\n\"I suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable mould,\nHeaven help her!\" said I. \"And she has been.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, there were violent quarrels at first, I assure you,\" said\nMr. Chillip; \"but she is quite a shadow now. Would it be considered\nforward if I was to say to you, sir, in confidence, that since the\nsister came to help, the brother and sister between them have nearly\nreduced her to a state of imbecility.\"\n\nI told him I could easily believe it.\n\n\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" said Mr. Chillip, fortifying himself\nwith another sip of negus, \"between you and me, sir, that her mother\ndied of it--or that tyranny, gloom, and worry, have made Mrs. Murdstone\nnearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and\ntheir gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now,\nmore like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law. That was Mrs.\nChillip's remark to me, only last week. And I assure you, sir, the\nladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself is a _great_ observer!\"\n\n\"Does he gloomily profess to be (I am ashamed to use the word in such\nassociation) religious still?\" I inquired.\n\n\"You anticipate, sir,\" said Mr. Chillip, his eyelids getting quite red\nwith the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging. \"One of Mrs.\nChillip's most impressive remarks. Mrs. Chillip,\" he proceeded, in the\ncalmest and slowest manner, \"quite electrified me, by pointing out that\nMr. Murdstone sets up an image of himself, and calls it the Divine\nNature. You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back, sir, with\nthe feather of a pen, I assure you, when Mrs. Chillip said so. The\nladies are great observers, sir?\"\n\n\"Intuitively,\" said I, to his extreme delight.\n\n\"I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion, sir,\" he\nrejoined. \"It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion,\nI assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, and it\nis said,--in short, sir, it is said by Mrs. Chillip,--that the darker\ntyrant he has lately been, the more ferocious is his doctrine.\"\n\n\"I believe Mrs. Chillip to be perfectly right,\" said I.\n\n\"Mrs. Chillip does go so far as to say,\" pursued the meekest of little\nmen, much encouraged, \"that what such people miscall their religion, is\na vent for their bad-humors and arrogance. And do you know I must say,\nsir,\" he continued, mildly laying his head on one side, \"that I _don't_\nfind authority for Mr. and Miss Murdstone in the New Testament?\"\n\n\"I never found it either,\" said I.\n\n\"In the meantime, sir,\" said Mr. Chillip, \"they are much disliked; and\nas they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them to\nperdition, we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our\nneighbourhood! However, as Mrs. Chillip says, sir, they undergo a\ncontinual punishment; for they are turned inward, to feed upon their own\nhearts, and their own hearts are very bad feeding. Now, sir, about that\nbrain of yours, if you'll excuse my returning to it. Don't you expose it\nto a good deal of excitement, sir?\"\n\nI found it not difficult, in the excitement of Mr. Chillip's own brain,\nunder his potations of negus, to divert his attention from this topic to\nhis own affairs, on which, for the next half hour, he was quite\nloquacious; giving me to understand, among other pieces of information,\nthat he was then at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house to lay his professional\nevidence before a Commission of Lunacy, touching the state of mind of a\npatient who had become deranged from excessive drinking.\n\n\"And I assure you, sir,\" he said, \"I am extremely nervous on such\noccasions. I could not support being what is called Bullied, sir. It\nwould quite unman me. Do you know it was some time before I recovered\nthe conduct of that alarming lady, on the night of your birth, Mr.\nCopperfield?\"\n\nI told him that I was going down to my aunt, the Dragon of that night,\nearly in the morning; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted\nand excellent of women, as he would know full well if he knew her\nbetter. The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again,\nappeared to terrify him. He replied, with a small pale smile, \"Is she\nso, indeed, sir? Really?\" and almost immediately called for a candle,\nand went to bed, as if he were not quite safe anywhere else. He did not\nactually stagger under the negus; but I should think his placid little\npulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute, than it had\ndone since the great night of my aunt's disappointment, when she struck\nat him with her bonnet.\n\nThoroughly tired, I went to bed too, at midnight; passed the next day on\nthe Dover coach; burst safe and sound into my aunt's old parlor while\nshe was at tea (she wore spectacles now); and was received by her, and\nMr. Dick, and dear old Peggotty, who acted as housekeeper, with open\narms and tears of joy. My aunt was mightily amused, when we began to\ntalk composedly, by my account of my meeting with Mr. Chillip, and of\nhis holding her in such dread remembrance; and both she and Peggotty had\na great deal to say about my poor mother's second husband, and \"that\nmurdering woman of a sister,\"--on whom I think no pain or penalty would\nhave induced my aunt to bestow any Christian or Proper Name, or any\nother designation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nAGNES.\n\n\nMy aunt and I, when we were left alone, talked far into the night. How\nthe emigrants never wrote home, otherwise than cheerfully and hopefully;\nhow Mr. Micawber had actually remitted divers small sums of money, on\naccount of those \"pecuniary liabilities,\" in reference to which he had\nbeen so business-like as between man and man; how Janet, returning into\nmy aunt's service when she came back to Dover, had finally carried out\nher renunciation of mankind by entering into wedlock with a thriving\ntavern-keeper; and how my aunt had finally set _her_ seal on the same\ngreat principle, by aiding and abetting the bride, and crowning the\nmarriage-ceremony with her presence; were among our topics--already more\nor less familiar to me through the letters I had had. Mr. Dick, as\nusual, was not forgotten. My aunt informed me how he incessantly\noccupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on, and\nkept King Charles the First at a respectful distance by that semblance\nof employment; how it was one of the main joys and rewards of her life\nthat he was free and happy, instead of pining in monotonous restraint;\nand how (as a novel general conclusion) nobody but she could ever fully\nknow what he was.\n\n\"And when, Trot,\" said my aunt, patting the back of my hand, as we sat\nin our old way before the fire, \"when are you going over to Canterbury?\"\n\n\"I shall get a horse, and ride over to-morrow morning, aunt, unless you\nwill go with me?\"\n\n\"No!\" said my aunt, in her short abrupt way. \"I mean to stay where I\nam.\"\n\nThen, I should ride, I said. I could not have come through Canterbury\nto-day without stopping, if I had been coming to anyone but her.\n\nShe was pleased, but answered, \"Tut, Trot; _my_ old bones would have\nkept till to-morrow!\" and softly patted my hand again, as I sat looking\nthoughtfully at the fire.\n\nThoughtfully, for I could not be here once more, and so near Agnes,\nwithout the revival of those regrets with which I had so long been\noccupied. Softened regrets they might be, teaching me what I had failed\nto learn when my younger life was all before me, but not the less\nregrets. \"Oh, Trot,\" I seemed to hear my aunt say once more; and I\nunderstood her better now--\"Blind, blind, blind!\"\n\nWe both kept silence for some minutes. When I raised my eyes, I found\nthat she was steadily observant of me. Perhaps she had followed the\ncurrent of my mind; for it seemed to me an easy one to track now, wilful\nas it had been once.\n\n\"You will find her father a white-haired old man,\" said my aunt, \"though\na better man in all other respects--a reclaimed man. Neither will you\nfind him measuring all human interests, and joys, and sorrows, with his\none poor little inch-rule now. Trust me, child, such things must shrink\nvery much, before they can be measured off in _that_ way.\"\n\n\"Indeed they must,\" said I.\n\n\"You will find her,\" pursued my aunt, \"as good, as beautiful, as\nearnest, as disinterested, as she has always been. If I knew higher\npraise, Trot, I would bestow it on her.\"\n\nThere was no higher praise for her; no higher reproach for me. O, how\nhad I strayed so far away!\n\n\"If she trains the young girls whom she has about her, to be like\nherself,\" said my aunt, earnest even to the filling of her eyes with\ntears, \"Heaven knows, her life will be well employed! Useful and happy,\nas she said that day! How could she be otherwise than useful and happy!\"\n\n\"Has Agnes any--\" I was thinking aloud, rather than speaking.\n\n\"Well? Hey? Any what?\" said my aunt, sharply.\n\n\"Any lover,\" said I.\n\n\"A score,\" cried my aunt, with a kind of indignant pride. \"She might\nhave married twenty times, my dear, since you have been gone!\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said I. \"No doubt. But has she any lover who is worthy of\nher? Agnes could care for no other.\"\n\nMy aunt sat musing for a little while, with her chin upon her hand.\nSlowly raising her eyes to mine, she said:\n\n\"I suspect she has an attachment, Trot.\"\n\n\"A prosperous one?\" said I.\n\n\"Trot,\" returned my aunt gravely, \"I can't say. I have no right to tell\nyou even so much. She has never confided it to me, but I suspect it.\"\n\nShe looked so attentively and anxiously at me (I even saw her tremble),\nthat I felt now, more than ever, that she had followed my late thoughts.\nI summoned all the resolutions I had made, in all those many days and\nnights, and all those many conflicts of my heart.\n\n\"If it should be so,\" I began, \"and I hope it is--\"\n\n\"I don't know that it is,\" said my aunt curtly. \"You must not be ruled\nby my suspicions. You must keep them secret. They are very slight,\nperhaps. I have no right to speak.\"\n\n\"If it should be so,\" I repeated, \"Agnes will tell me at her own good\ntime. A sister to whom I have confided so much, aunt, will not be\nreluctant to confide in me.\"\n\nMy aunt withdrew her eyes from mine, as slowly as she had turned them\nupon me; and covered them thoughtfully with her hand. By and by she put\nher other hand on my shoulder; and so we both sat, looking into the\npast, without saying another word, until we parted for the night.\n\nI rode away, early in the morning, for the scene of my old school days.\nI cannot say that I was yet quite happy, in the hope that I was gaining\na victory over myself; even in the prospect of so soon looking on her\nface again.\n\nThe well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and I came into the\nquiet streets, where every stone was a boy's book to me. I went on\nfoot to the old house, and went away with a heart too full to enter.\nI returned; and looking, as I passed, through the low window of the\nturret-room where first Uriah Heep, and afterwards Mr. Micawber, had\nbeen wont to sit, saw that it was a little parlor now, and that there\nwas no office. Otherwise the staid old house was, as to its cleanliness\nand order, still just as it had been when I first saw it. I requested\nthe new maid who admitted me, to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman\nwho waited on her from a friend abroad, was there; and I was shown\nup the grave old staircase (cautioned of the steps I knew so well),\ninto the unchanged drawing-room. The books that Agnes and I had read\ntogether, were on their shelves; and the desk where I had labored at my\nlessons, many a night, stood yet at the same old corner of the table.\nAll the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there,\nwere changed again. Everything was as it used to be, in the happy time.\n\nI stood in a window, and looked across the ancient street at the\nopposite houses, recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons,\nwhen I first came there; and how I had used to speculate about the\npeople who appeared at any of the windows, and had followed them with my\neyes up and down stairs, while women went clicking along the pavement in\npattens, and the dull rain fell in slanting lines, and poured out of the\nwaterspout yonder, and flowed into the road. The feeling with which I\nused to watch the tramps, as they came into the town on those wet\nevenings, at dusk, and limped past, with their bundles drooping over\ntheir shoulders at the ends of sticks, came freshly back to me; fraught,\nas then, with the smell of damp earth, and wet leaves and briar, and the\nsensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey.\n\nThe opening of the little door in the panneled wall made me start and\nturn. Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me. She\nstopped and laid her hand upon her bosom, and I caught her in my arms.\n\n\"Agnes! my dear girl! I have come too suddenly upon you.\"\n\n\"No, no! I am so rejoiced to see you, Trotwood!\"\n\n\"Dear Agnes, the happiness it is to me, to see you once again!\"\n\nI folded her to my heart, and, for a little while, we were both silent.\nPresently we sat down, side by side; and her angel-face was turned upon\nme with the welcome I had dreamed of, waking and sleeping, for whole\nyears.\n\nShe was so true, she was so beautiful, she was so good,--I owed her so\nmuch gratitude, she was so dear to me, that I could find no utterance\nfor what I felt. I tried to bless her, tried to thank her, tried to tell\nher (as I had often done in letters) what an influence she had upon me;\nbut all my efforts were in vain. My love and joy were dumb.\n\nWith her own sweet tranquillity, she calmed my agitation; led me back to\nthe time of our parting; spoke to me of Emily, whom she had visited, in\nsecret, many times; spoke to me tenderly of Dora's grave. With the\nunerring instinct of her noble heart, she touched the chords of my\nmemory so softly and harmoniously, that not one jarred within me; I\ncould listen to the sorrowful, distant music, and desire to shrink from\nnothing it awoke. How could I, when, blended with it all, was her dear\nself, the better angel of my life?\n\n\"And you, Agnes,\" I said, by and by. \"Tell me of yourself. You have\nhardly ever told me of your own life, in all this lapse of time!\"\n\n\"What should I tell?\" she answered, with her radiant smile. \"Papa is\nwell. You see us here, quiet in our own home; our anxieties set at rest,\nour home restored to us; and knowing that, dear Trotwood, you know all.\"\n\n\"All, Agnes?\" said I.\n\nShe looked at me, with some fluttering wonder in her face.\n\n\"Is there nothing else, Sister?\" I said.\n\nHer color, which had just now faded, returned, and faded again. She\nsmiled; with a quiet sadness, I thought; and shook her head.\n\nI had sought to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at; for, sharply\npainful to me as it must be to receive that confidence, I was to\ndiscipline my heart, and do my duty to her. I saw, however, that she was\nuneasy, and I let it pass.\n\n\"You have much to do, dear Agnes?\"\n\n\"With my school?\" said she, looking up again, in all her bright\ncomposure.\n\n\"Yes. It is laborious, is it not?\"\n\n\"The labor is so pleasant,\" she returned, \"that it is scarcely grateful\nin me to call it by that name.\"\n\n\"Nothing good is difficult to you,\" said I.\n\nHer color came and went once more; and once more, as she bent her head,\nI saw the same sad smile.\n\n\"You will wait and see papa,\" said Agnes, cheerfully, \"and pass the day\nwith us? Perhaps you will sleep in your own room? We always call it\nyours.\"\n\nI could not do that, having promised to ride back to my aunt's, at\nnight; but I would pass the day there, joyfully.\n\n\"I must be a prisoner for a little while,\" said Agnes, \"but here are the\nold books, Trotwood, and the old music.\"\n\n\"Even the old flowers are here,\" said I, looking round; \"or the old\nkinds.\"\n\n\"I have found a pleasure,\" returned Agnes, smiling, \"while you have been\nabsent, in keeping every thing as it used to be when we were children.\nFor we were very happy then, I think.\"\n\n\"Heaven knows we were!\" said I.\n\n\"And every little thing that has reminded me of my brother,\" said Agnes,\nwith her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me, \"has been a welcome\ncompanion. Even this,\" showing me the basket-trifle, full of keys, still\nhanging at her side, \"seems to jingle a kind of old tune!\"\n\nShe smiled again, and went out at the door by which she had come.\n\nIt was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care. It\nwas all that I had left myself, and it was a treasure. If I once shook\nthe foundations of the sacred confidence and usage, in virtue of which\nit was given to me, it was lost, and could never be recovered. I set\nthis steadily before myself. The better I loved her, the more it behoved\nme never to forget it.\n\nI walked through the streets; and, once more seeing my old adversary the\nbutcher--now a constable, with his staff hanging up in the shop--went\ndown to look at the place where I had fought him; and there meditated on\nMiss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins, and all the idle loves and\nlikings, and dislikings, of that time. Nothing seemed to have survived\nthat time but Agnes; and she, ever a star above me, was brighter and\nhigher.\n\nWhen I returned, Mr. Wickfield had come home, from a garden he had, a\ncouple of miles or so out of the town, where he now employed himself\nalmost every day. I found him as my aunt had described him. We sat down\nto dinner, with some half-dozen little girls; and he seemed but the\nshadow of his handsome picture on the wall.\n\nThe tranquillity and peace belonging, of old, to that quiet ground in my\nmemory, pervaded it again. When dinner was done, Mr. Wickfield taking no\nwine, and I desiring none, we went up stairs; where Agnes and her little\ncharges sang and played, and worked. After tea the children left us; and\nwe three sat together, talking of the by-gone days.\n\n\"My part in them,\" said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his white head, \"has much\nmatter for regret--for deep regret, and deep contrition, Trotwood, you\nwell know. But I would not cancel it, if it were in my power.\"\n\nI could readily believe that, looking at the face beside him.\n\n\"I should cancel with it,\" he pursued, \"such patience and devotion, such\nfidelity, such a child's love, as I must not forget, no! even to forget\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I understand you, sir,\" I softly said. \"I hold it--I have always held\nit--in veneration.\"\n\n\"But no one knows, not even you,\" he returned, \"how much she has done,\nhow much she has undergone, how hard she has striven. Dear Agnes!\"\n\nShe had put her hand entreatingly on his arm, to stop him; and was very,\nvery, pale.\n\n\"Well, well!\" he said with a sigh, dismissing, as I then saw, some trial\nshe had borne, or was yet to bear, in connexion with what my aunt had\ntold me. \"Well! I have never told you, Trotwood, of her mother. Has any\none?\"\n\n\"Never, sir.\"\n\n\"It's not much--though it was much to suffer. She married me in\nopposition to her father's wish, and he renounced her. She prayed him to\nforgive her, before my Agnes came into this world. He was a very hard\nman, and her mother had long been dead. He repulsed her. He broke her\nheart.\"\n\nAgnes leaned upon his shoulder, and stole her arm about his neck.\n\n\"She had an affectionate and gentle heart,\" he said; \"and it was broken.\nI knew its tender nature very well. No one could, if I did not. She\nloved me dearly, but was never happy. She was always laboring, in\nsecret, under this distress; and being delicate and downcast at the time\nof his last repulse--for it was not the first, by many--pined away and\ndied. She left me Agnes, two weeks old; and the grey hair that you\nrecollect me with, when you first came.\"\n\nHe kissed Agnes on her cheek.\n\n\"My love for my dear child was a diseased love, but my mind was all\nunhealthy then. I say no more of that. I am not speaking of myself,\nTrotwood, but of her mother, and of her. If I give you any clue to what\nI am, or to what I have been, you will unravel it, I know. What Agnes\nis, I need not say. I have always read something of her poor mother's\nstory, in her character; and so I tell it you to-night, when we three\nare again together, after such great changes. I have told it all.\"\n\nHis bowed head, and her angel face and filial duty, derived a more\npathetic meaning from it than they had had before. If I had wanted\nanything by which to mark this night of our reunion, I should have found\nit in this.\n\nAgnes rose up from her father's side, before long; and going softly to\nher piano, played some of the old airs to which we had often listened in\nthat place.\n\n\"Have you any intention of going away again?\" Agnes asked me, as I was\nstanding by.\n\n\"What does my sister say to that?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"Then I have no such intention, Agnes.\"\n\n\"I think you ought not, Trotwood, since you ask me,\" she said, mildly.\n\"Your growing reputation and success enlarge your power of doing good;\nand if _I_ could spare my brother,\" with her eyes upon me, \"perhaps the\ntime could not.\"\n\n\"What I am, you have made me, Agnes. You should know best.\"\n\n\"_I_ made you, Trotwood?\"\n\n\"Yes! Agnes, my dear girl!\" I said, bending over her. \"I tried to\ntell you, when we met to-day, something that has been in my thoughts\nsince Dora died. You remember, when you came down to me in our little\nroom--pointing upward, Agnes?\"\n\n\"Oh, Trotwood!\" she returned, her eyes filled with tears. \"So loving, so\nconfiding, and so young! Can I ever forget?\"\n\n\"As you were then, my sister, I have often thought since, you have ever\nbeen to me. Ever pointing upward, Agnes; ever leading me to something\nbetter; ever directing me to higher things!\"\n\nShe only shook her head; through her tears I saw the same sad quiet\nsmile.\n\n\"And I am so grateful to you for it, Agnes, so bound to you, that there\nis no name for the affection of my heart. I want you to know, yet don't\nknow how to tell you, that all my life long I shall look up to you, and\nbe guided by you, as I have been through the darkness that is past.\nWhatever betides, whatever new ties you may form, whatever changes may\ncome between us, I shall always look to you, and love you, as I do now,\nand have always done. You will always be my solace and resource, as you\nhave always been. Until I die, my dearest sister, I shall see you always\nbefore me, pointing upward!\"\n\nShe put her hand in mine, and told me she was proud of me, and of what I\nsaid; although I praised her very far beyond her worth. Then, she went\non softly playing, but without removing her eyes from me.\n\n\"Do you know, what I have heard to-night, Agnes,\" said I, \"strangely\nseems to be a part of the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw\nyou first--with which I sat beside you in my rough school-days?\"\n\n\"You knew I had no mother,\" she replied with a smile, \"and felt kindly\ntowards me.\"\n\n\"More than that, Agnes. I knew, almost as if I had known this story,\nthat there was something inexplicably gentle and softened, surrounding\nyou; something that might have been sorrowful in some one else (as I can\nnow understand it was), but was not so in you.\"\n\nShe softly played on, looking at me still.\n\n\"Will you laugh at my cherishing such fancies, Agnes?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Or at my saying that I really believe I felt, even then, that you could\nbe faithfully affectionate against all discouragement, and never cease\nto be so, until you ceased to live?--Will you laugh at such a dream?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Oh, no!\"\n\nFor an instant, a distressful shadow crossed her face; but, even in the\nstart it gave me, it was gone; and she was playing on, and looking at me\nwith her own calm smile.\n\nAs I rode back in the lonely night, the wind going by me like a restless\nmemory, I thought of this, and feared she was not happy. _I_ was not\nhappy; but, thus far, I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past, and,\nthinking of her, pointing upward, thought of her as pointing to that sky\nabove me, where, in the mystery to come, I might yet love her with a\nlove unknown on earth, and tell her what the strife had been within me\nwhen I loved her here.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nI AM SHOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS.\n\n\nFor a time--at all events until my book should be completed, which would\nbe the work of several months--I took up my abode in my aunt's house at\nDover; and there, sitting in the window from which I had looked out at\nthe moon upon the sea, when that roof first gave me shelter, I quietly\npursued my task.\n\nIn pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when\ntheir course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my\nstory, I do not enter on the aspirations, the delights, anxieties, and\ntriumphs, of my art. That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest\nearnestness, and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul, I have\nalready said. If the books I have written be of any worth, they will\nsupply the rest. I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose, and the\nrest will be of interest to no one.\n\nOccasionally, I went to London; to lose myself in the swarm of life\nthere, or to consult with Traddles on some business point. He had\nmanaged for me, in my absence, with the soundest judgment; and my\nworldly affairs were prospering. As my notoriety began to bring upon\nme an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no\nknowledge--chiefly about nothing, and extremely difficult to answer--I\nagreed with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door. There,\nthe devoted postmen on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me;\nand there, at intervals, I labored through them, like a Home Secretary\nof State without the salary.\n\nAmong this correspondence, there dropped in, every now and then, an\nobliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking\nabout the Commons, to practise under cover of my name (if I would take\nthe necessary steps remaining to make a proctor of myself), and pay me a\npercentage on the profits. But I declined these offers; being already\naware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence,\nand considering the Commons quite bad enough, without my doing anything\nto make it worse.\n\nThe girls had gone home, when my name burst into bloom on Traddles's\ndoor; and the sharp boy looked, all day, as if he had never heard of\nSophy, shut up in a back room, glancing down from her work into a sooty\nlittle strip of garden with a pump in it. But, there I always found her,\nthe same bright housewife; often humming her Devonshire ballads when no\nstrange foot was coming up the stairs, and blunting the sharp boy in his\nofficial closet with melody.\n\nI wondered, at first, why I so often found Sophy writing in a copy-book;\nand why she always shut it up when I appeared, and hurried it into the\ntable-drawer. But the secret soon came out. One day, Traddles (who had\njust come home through the drizzling sleet from Court) took a paper out\nof his desk, and asked me what I thought of that handwriting?\n\n\"Oh, _don't_, Tom!\" cried Sophy, who was warming his slippers before the\nfire.\n\n\"My dear,\" returned Tom, in a delighted state, \"why not? What do you say\nto that writing, Copperfield?\"\n\n\"It's extraordinarily legal and formal,\" said I. \"I don't think I ever\nsaw such a stiff hand.\"\n\n\"Not like a lady's hand, is it?\" said Traddles.\n\n\"A lady's!\" I repeated. \"Bricks and mortar are more like a lady's hand!\"\n\nTraddles broke into a rapturous laugh, and informed me that it was\nSophy's writing; that Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a\ncopying-clerk soon, and she would be that clerk; that she had acquired\nthis hand from a pattern; and that she could throw off--I forget how\nmany folios an hour. Sophy was very much confused by my being told all\nthis, and said that when \"Tom\" was made a judge he wouldn't be so ready\nto proclaim it. Which \"Tom\" denied; averring that he should always be\nequally proud of it, under all circumstances.\n\n\"What a thoroughly good and charming wife she is, my dear Traddles!\"\nsaid I, when she had gone away, laughing.\n\n\"My dear Copperfield,\" returned Traddles, \"she is, without any\nexception, the dearest girl! The way she manages this place; her\npunctuality, domestic knowledge, economy, and order; her cheerfulness,\nCopperfield!\"\n\n\"Indeed, you have reason to commend her!\" I returned. \"You are a happy\nfellow. I believe you make yourselves, and each other, two of the\nhappiest people in the world.\"\n\n\"I am sure we _are_ two of the happiest people,\" returned Traddles. \"I\nadmit that, at all events. Bless my soul, when I see her getting up by\ncandle-light on these dark mornings, busying herself in the day's\narrangements, going out to market before the clerks come into the Inn,\ncaring for no weather, devising the most capital little dinners out of\nthe plainest materials, making puddings and pies, keeping everything in\nits right place, always so neat and ornamental herself, sitting up at\nnight with me if it's ever so late, sweet-tempered and encouraging\nalways, and all for me, I positively sometimes can't believe it,\nCopperfield!\"\n\nHe was tender of the very slippers she had been warming, as he put them\non, and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender.\n\n\"I positively sometimes can't believe it,\" said Traddles. \"Then, our\npleasures! Dear me, they are inexpensive, but they are quite wonderful!\nWhen we are at home here, of an evening, and shut the outer door, and\ndraw those curtains--which she made--where could we be more snug?\nWhen it's fine, and we go out for a walk in the evening, the streets\nabound in enjoyment for us. We look into the glittering windows of the\njewellers' shops; and I show Sophy which of the diamond-eyed serpents,\ncoiled up on white satin rising grounds, I would give her if I could\nafford it; and Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are\ncapped and jewelled and engine-turned, and possessed of the horizontal\nlever-escape-movement, and all sorts of things, she would buy for\nme if _she_ could afford it; and we pick out the spoons and forks,\nfish-slices, butter-knives, and sugar-tongs, we should both prefer if\nwe could both afford it; and really we go away as if we had got them!\nThen, when we stroll into the squares, and great streets, and see a\nhouse to let, sometimes we look up at it, and say, how would _that_ do,\nif I was made a judge? And we parcel it out--such a room for us, such\nrooms for the girls, and so forth; until we settle to our satisfaction\nthat it would do, or it wouldn't do, as the case may be. Sometimes, we\ngo at half-price to the pit of the theatre--the very smell of which is\ncheap, in my opinion, at the money--and there we thoroughly enjoy the\nplay: which Sophy believes every word of, and so do I. In walking home,\nperhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cook's-shop, or a little\nlobster at the fishmonger's, and bring it here, and make a splendid\nsupper, chatting about what we have seen. Now, you know, Copperfield,\nif I was Lord Chancellor, we couldn't do this!\"\n\n\"You would do something, whatever you were, my dear Traddles,\" thought\nI, \"that would be pleasant and amiable! And by the way,\" I said aloud,\n\"I suppose you never draw any skeletons now?\"\n\n\"Really,\" replied Traddles, laughing, and reddening, \"I can't wholly\ndeny that I do, my dear Copperfield. For, being in one of the back rows\nof the King's Bench the other day, with a pen in my hand, the fancy came\ninto my head to try how I had preserved that accomplishment. And I am\nafraid there's a skeleton--in a wig--on the ledge of the desk.\"\n\nAfter we had both laughed heartily, Traddles wound up by looking with a\nsmile at the fire, and saying, in his forgiving way, \"Old Creakle!\"\n\n\"I have a letter from that old--Rascal here,\" said I. For I never was\nless disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter Traddles, than\nwhen I saw Traddles so ready to forgive him himself.\n\n\"From Creakle the schoolmaster?\" exclaimed Traddles. \"No!\"\n\n\"Among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and\nfortune,\" said I, looking over my letters, \"and who discover that they\nwere always much attached to me, is the self-same Creakle. He is not a\nschoolmaster now, Traddles. He is retired. He is a Middlesex\nMagistrate.\"\n\nI thought Traddles might be surprised to hear it, but he was not so at\nall.\n\n\"How do you suppose he comes to be a Middlesex Magistrate?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh dear me!\" replied Traddles, \"it would be very difficult to answer\nthat question. Perhaps he voted for somebody, or lent money to somebody,\nor bought something of somebody, or otherwise obliged somebody, or\njobbed for somebody, who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the\ncounty to nominate him for the commission.\"\n\n\"On the commission he is, at any rate,\" said I. \"And he writes to me\nhere, that he will be glad to show me, in operation, the only true\nsystem of prison discipline; the only unchallengeable way of making\nsincere and lasting converts and penitents--which, you know, is by\nsolitary confinement. What do you say?\"\n\n\"To the system?\" inquired Traddles, looking grave.\n\n\"No. To my accepting the offer, and your going with me?\"\n\n\"I don't object,\" said Traddles.\n\n\"Then I'll write to say so. You remember (to say nothing of our\ntreatment) this same Creakle turning his son out of doors, I suppose,\nand the life he used to lead his wife and daughter?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Traddles.\n\n\"Yet, if you'll read his letter, you'll find he is the tenderest of men\nto prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies,\" said I;\n\"though I can't find that his tenderness extends to any other class of\ncreated beings.\"\n\nTraddles shrugged his shoulders, and was not at all surprised. I had not\nexpected him to be, and was not surprised myself; or my observation of\nsimilar practical satires would have been but scanty. We arranged the\ntime of our visit, and I wrote accordingly to Mr. Creakle that evening.\n\nOn the appointed day--I think it was the next day, but no\nmatter--Traddles and I repaired to the prison where Mr. Creakle was\npowerful. It was an immense and solid building, erected at a vast\nexpense. I could not help thinking, as we approached the gate, what\nan uproar would have been made in the country, if any deluded man had\nproposed to spend one half the money it had cost, on the erection of an\nindustrial school for the young, or a house of refuge for the deserving\nold.\n\nIn an office that might have been on the ground-floor of the Tower of\nBabel, it was so massively constructed, we were presented to our old\nschoolmaster; who was one of a group, composed of two or three of the\nbusier sort of magistrates, and some visitors they had brought. He\nreceived me, like a man who had formed my mind in bygone years, and had\nalways loved me tenderly. On my introducing Traddles, Mr. Creakle\nexpressed, in like manner, but in an inferior degree, that he had always\nbeen Traddles's guide, philosopher, and friend. Our venerable instructor\nwas a great deal older, and not improved in appearance. His face was as\nfiery as ever; his eyes were as small, and rather deeper set. The\nscanty, wet-looking grey hair, by which I remembered him, was almost\ngone; and the thick veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable\nto look at.\n\nAfter some conversation among these gentlemen, from which I might have\nsupposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately taken\ninto account but the supreme comfort of prisoners, at any expense, and\nnothing on the wide earth to be done outside prison-doors, we began our\ninspection. It being then just dinner-time, we went, first into the\ngreat kitchen, where every prisoner's dinner was in course of being set\nout separately (to be handed to him in his cell), with the regularity\nand precision of clock-work. I said aside, to Traddles, that I wondered\nwhether it occurred to anybody, that there was a striking contrast\nbetween these plentiful repasts of choice quality, and the dinners, not\nto say of paupers, but of soldiers, sailors, laborers, the great bulk of\nthe honest, working community; of whom not one man in five hundred ever\ndined half so well. But I learned that the \"system\" required high\nliving; and, in short, to dispose of the system, once for all, I found\nthat on that head and on all others, \"the system\" put an end to all\ndoubts, and disposed of all anomalies. Nobody appeared to have the least\nidea that there was any other system, but _the_ system, to be\nconsidered.\n\nAs we were going through some of the magnificent passages, I inquired of\nMr. Creakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages\nof this all-governing and universally over-riding system? I found them\nto be the perfect isolation of prisoners--so that no one man in\nconfinement there, knew anything about another; and the reduction of\nprisoners to a wholesome state of mind, leading to sincere contrition\nand repentance.\n\nNow, it struck me, when we began to visit individuals in their cells,\nand to traverse the passages in which those cells were, and to have the\nmanner of the going to chapel and so forth, explained to us, that there\nwas a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each\nother, and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse.\nThis, at the time I write, has been proved, I believe, to be the case;\nbut, as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have\nhinted such a doubt then, I looked out for the penitence as diligently\nas I could.\n\nAnd here again, I had great misgivings. I found as prevalent a fashion\nin the form of the penitence, as I had left outside in the forms of the\ncoats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors' shops. I found a\nvast amount of profession, varying very little in character: varying\nvery little (which I thought exceedingly suspicious), even in words. I\nfound a great many foxes, disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible\ngrapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within\nreach of a bunch. Above all, I found that the most professing men were\nthe greatest objects of interest; and that their conceit, their vanity,\ntheir want of excitement, and their love of deception (which many of\nthem possessed to an almost incredible extent, as their histories\nshowed), all prompted to these professions, and were all gratified by\nthem.\n\nHowever, I heard so repeatedly, in the course of our goings to and fro,\nof a certain Number Twenty Seven, who was the Favorite, and who really\nappeared to be a Model Prisoner, that I resolved to suspend my judgment\nuntil I should see Twenty Seven. Twenty Eight, I understood, was also a\nbright particular star; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a\nlittle dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of Twenty Seven. I heard so\nmuch of Twenty Seven, of his pious admonitions to everybody around him,\nand of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother (whom he\nseemed to consider in a very bad way), that I became quite impatient to\nsee him.\n\nI had to restrain my impatience for some time, on account of Twenty\nSeven being reserved for a concluding effect. But, at last, we came to\nthe door of his cell; and Mr. Creakle, looking through a little hole in\nit, reported to us, in a state of the greatest admiration, that he was\nreading a Hymn Book.\n\nThere was such a rush of heads immediately, to see Number Twenty Seven\nreading his Hymn Book, that the little hole was blocked up, six or seven\nheads deep. To remedy this inconvenience, and give us an opportunity of\nconversing with Twenty Seven in all his purity, Mr. Creakle directed the\ndoor of the cell to be unlocked, and Twenty Seven to be invited out into\nthe passage. This was done; and whom should Traddles and I then behold,\nto our amazement, in this converted Number Twenty Seven, but Uriah Heep!\n\nHe knew us directly; and said, as he came out--with the old writhe,--\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Copperfield? How do you do, Mr. Traddles?\"\n\nThis recognition caused a general admiration in the party. I rather\nthought that everyone was struck by his not being proud, and taking\nnotice of us.\n\n\"Well, Twenty Seven,\" said Mr. Creakle, mournfully admiring him. \"How do\nyou find yourself to-day?\"\n\n\"I am very umble, sir!\" replied Uriah Heep.\n\n\"You are always so, Twenty Seven,\" said Mr. Creakle.\n\nHere, another gentleman asked, with extreme anxiety: \"Are you quite\ncomfortable?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thank you, sir!\" said Uriah Heep, looking in that direction.\n\"Far more comfortable here, than ever I was outside. I see my follies\nnow, sir. That's what makes me comfortable.\"\n\nSeveral gentlemen were much affected; and a third questioner, forcing\nhimself to the front, inquired with extreme feeling: \"How do you find\nthe beef?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Uriah, glancing in the new direction of this\nvoice, \"it was tougher yesterday than I could wish; but it's my duty to\nbear. I have committed follies, gentlemen,\" said Uriah, looking round\nwith a meek smile, \"and I ought to bear the consequences without\nrepining.\"\n\nA murmur, partly of gratification at Twenty Seven's celestial state of\nmind, and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him\nany cause of complaint (a note of which was immediately made by Mr.\nCreakle), having subsided, Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us, as if\nhe felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious\nmuseum. That we, the neophytes, might have an excess of light shining\nupon us all at once, orders were given to let out Twenty Eight.\n\nI had been so much astonished already, that I only felt a kind of\nresigned wonder when Mr. Littimer walked forth, reading a good book!\n\n  [Illustration: I am shown two interesting penitents.]\n\n\"Twenty Eight,\" said a gentleman in spectacles, who had not yet spoken,\n\"you complained last week, my good fellow, of the cocoa. How has it been\nsince?\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" said Mr. Littimer, \"it has been better made. If I\nmight take the liberty of saying so, sir, I don't think the milk which\nis boiled with it is quite genuine; but I am aware, sir, that there is\ngreat adulteration of milk, in London, and that the article in a pure\nstate is difficult to be obtained.\"\n\nIt appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his Twenty\nEight against Mr. Creakle's Twenty Seven, for each of them took his own\nman in hand.\n\n\"What is your state of mind, Twenty Eight?\" said the questioner in\nspectacles.\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" returned Mr. Littimer; \"I see my follies now, sir. I\nam a good deal troubled when I think of the sins of my former\ncompanions, sir; but I trust they may find forgiveness.\"\n\n\"You are quite happy yourself?\" said the questioner, nodding\nencouragement.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you, sir,\" returned Mr. Littimer. \"Perfectly so.\"\n\n\"Is there anything at all on your mind, now?\" said the questioner. \"If\nso, mention it, Twenty Eight.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Littimer, without looking up, \"if my eyes have not\ndeceived me, there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in\nmy former life. It may be profitable to that gentleman to know, sir,\nthat I attribute my past follies, entirely to having lived a thoughtless\nlife in the service of young men; and to having allowed myself to be led\nby them into weaknesses, which I had not the strength to resist. I hope\nthat gentleman will take warning, sir, and will not be offended at my\nfreedom. It is for his good. I am conscious of my own past follies. I\nhope he may repent of all the wickedness and sin, to which he has been a\nparty.\"\n\nI observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes, each, with\none hand, as if they had just come into church.\n\n\"This does you credit, Twenty Eight,\" returned the questioner. \"I should\nhave expected it of you. Is there anything else?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned Mr. Littimer, slightly lifting up his eyebrows, but not\nhis eyes, \"there was a young woman who fell into dissolute courses, that\nI endeavoured to save, sir, but could not rescue. I beg that gentleman,\nif he has it in his power, to inform that young woman from me that I\nforgive her her bad conduct towards myself; and that I call her to\nrepentance--if he will be so good.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt, Twenty Eight,\" returned the questioner, \"that the\ngentleman you refer to feels very strongly--as we all must--what you\nhave so properly said. We will not detain you.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" said Mr. Littimer. \"Gentlemen, I wish you a good\nday, and hoping you and your families will also see your wickedness, and\namend!\"\n\nWith this, Number Twenty Eight retired, after a glance between him and\nUriah; as if they were not altogether unknown to each other, through\nsome medium of communication; and a murmur went round the group, as his\ndoor shut upon him, that he was a most respectable man, and a beautiful\ncase.\n\n\"Now, Twenty Seven,\" said Mr. Creakle, entering on a clear stage with\n_his_ man, \"is there anything that any one can do for you? If so,\nmention it.\"\n\n\"I would umbly ask, sir,\" returned Uriah, with a jerk of his malevolent\nhead, \"for leave to write again to mother.\"\n\n\"It shall certainly be granted,\" said Mr. Creakle.\n\n\"Thank you, sir! I am anxious about mother. I am afraid she ain't safe.\"\n\nSomebody incautiously asked, what from? But there was a scandalised\nwhisper of \"Hush!\"\n\n\"Immortally safe, sir,\" returned Uriah, writhing in the direction of the\nvoice. \"I should wish mother to be got into my state. I never should\nhave been got into my present state if I hadn't come here. I wish mother\nhad come here. It would be better for everybody, if they got took up,\nand was brought here.\"\n\nThis sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction--greater satisfaction, I\nthink, than anything that had passed yet.\n\n\"Before I come here,\" said Uriah, stealing a look at us, as if he would\nhave blighted the outer world to which we belonged, if he could, \"I was\ngiven to follies; but now I am sensible of my follies. There's a deal of\nsin outside. There's a deal of sin in mother. There's nothing but sin\neverywhere--except here.\"\n\n\"You are quite changed?\" said Mr. Creakle.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes, sir!\" cried this hopeful penitent.\n\n\"You wouldn't relapse, if you were going out?\" asked somebody else.\n\n\"Oh de-ar no, sir!\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Creakle, \"this is very gratifying. You have addressed\nMr. Copperfield, Twenty Seven. Do you wish to say anything further to\nhim?\"\n\n\"You knew me, a long time before I came here and was changed, Mr.\nCopperfield,\" said Uriah, looking at me; and a more villainous look I\nnever saw, even on his visage. \"You knew me when, in spite of my\nfollies, I was umble among them that was proud, and meek among them that\nwas violent--you was violent to me yourself, Mr. Copperfield. Once, you\nstruck me a blow in the face, you know.\"\n\nGeneral commiseration. Several indignant glances directed at me.\n\n\"But I forgive you, Mr. Copperfield,\" said Uriah, making his forgiving\nnature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel, which I shall\nnot record. \"I forgive everybody. It would ill become me to bear malice.\nI freely forgive you, and I hope you'll curb your passions in future. I\nhope Mr. W. will repent, and Miss W., and all of that sinful lot. You've\nbeen visited with affliction, and I hope it may do you good; but you'd\nbetter have come here. Mr. W. had better have come here, and Miss W.\ntoo. The best wish I could give you, Mr. Copperfield, and give all of\nyou gentlemen, is, that you could be took up and brought here. When I\nthink of my past follies, and my present state, I am sure it would be\nbest for you. I pity all who ain't brought here!\"\n\nHe sneaked back into his cell, amidst a little chorus of approbation;\nand both Traddles and I experienced a great relief when he was locked\nin.\n\nIt was a characteristic feature in this repentance, that I was fain to\nask what these two men had done, to be there at all. That appeared to be\nthe last thing about which they had anything to say. I addressed myself\nto one of the two warders, who, I suspected, from certain latent\nindications in their faces, knew pretty well what all this stir was\nworth.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said I, as we walked along the passage, \"what felony was\nNumber Twenty Seven's last 'folly?'\"\n\nThe answer was, that it was a Bank case.\n\n\"A fraud on the Bank of England?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Fraud, forgery, and conspiracy. He and some others. He set\nthe others on. It was a deep plot for a large sum. Sentence,\ntransportation for life. Twenty Seven was the knowingest bird of the\nlot, and had very nearly kept himself safe; but not quite. The Bank was\njust able to put salt upon his tail--and only just.\"\n\n\"Do you know Twenty Eight's offence?\"\n\n\"Twenty Eight,\" returned my informant, speaking throughout in a low\ntone, and looking over his shoulder as we walked along the passage, to\nguard himself from being overheard, in such an unlawful reference to\nthese Immaculates, by Creakle and the rest; \"Twenty Eight (also\ntransportation) got a place, and robbed a young master of a matter of\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables, the night before\nthey were going abroad. I particularly recollect his case, from his\nbeing took by a dwarf.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A little woman. I have forgot her name.\"\n\n\"Not Mowcher?\"\n\n\"That's it! He had eluded pursuit, and was going to America in a flaxen\nwig, and whiskers, and such a complete disguise as never you see in\nall your born days; when the little woman, being in Southampton, met\nhim walking along the street--picked him out with her sharp eye in a\nmoment--ran betwixt his legs to upset him--and held on to him like grim\nDeath.\"\n\n\"Excellent Miss Mowcher!\" cried I.\n\n\"You'd have said so, if you had seen her, standing on a chair in the\nwitness-box at his trial, as I did,\" said my friend. \"He cut her face\nright open, and pounded her in the most brutal manner, when she took\nhim; but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up. She held so\ntight to him, in fact, that the officers were obliged to take 'em both\ntogether. She gave her evidence in the gamest way, and was highly\ncomplimented by the Bench, and cheered right home to her lodgings. She\nsaid in Court that she'd have took him single-handed (on account of what\nshe knew concerning him), if he had been Samson. And it's my belief she\nwould!\"\n\nIt was mine too, and I highly respected Miss Mowcher for it.\n\nWe had now seen all there was to see. It would have been in vain to\nrepresent to such a man as the Worshipful Mr. Creakle, that Twenty Seven\nand Twenty Eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged; that exactly\nwhat they were then, they had always been; that the hypocritical knaves\nwere just the subjects to make that sort of profession in such a place;\nthat they knew its market-value at least as well as we did, in the\nimmediate service it would do them when they were expatriated; in a\nword, that it was a rotten, hollow, painfully-suggestive piece of\nbusiness altogether. We left them to their system and themselves, and\nwent home wondering.\n\n\"Perhaps it's a good thing, Traddles,\" said I, \"to have an unsound Hobby\nridden hard; for it's the sooner ridden to death.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" replied Traddles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nA LIGHT SHINES ON MY WAY.\n\n\nThe year came round to Christmas-time, and I had been at home above two\nmonths. I had seen Agnes frequently. However loud the general voice\nmight be in giving me encouragement, and however fervent the emotions\nand endeavours to which it roused me, I heard her lightest word of\npraise as I heard nothing else.\n\nAt least once a week, and sometimes oftener, I rode over there, and\npassed the evening. I usually rode back at night; for the old unhappy\nsense was always hovering about me now--most sorrowfully when I left\nher--and I was glad to be up and out, rather than wandering over the\npast in weary wakefulness or miserable dreams. I wore away the longest\npart of many wild sad nights, in those rides; reviving, as I went, the\nthoughts that had occupied me in my long absence.\n\nOr, if I were to say rather that I listened to the echoes of those\nthoughts, I should better express the truth. They spoke to me from afar\noff. I had put them at a distance, and accepted my inevitable place.\nWhen I read to Agnes what I wrote; when I saw her listening face; moved\nher to smiles or tears; and heard her cordial voice so earnest on the\nshadowy events of that imaginative world in which I lived; I thought\nwhat a fate mine might have been--but only thought so, as I had thought\nafter I was married to Dora, what I could have wished my wife to be.\n\nMy duty to Agnes, who loved me with a love, which, if I disquieted, I\nwronged most selfishly and poorly, and could never restore; my matured\nassurance that I, who had worked out my own destiny, and won what I had\nimpetuously set my heart on, had no right to murmur, and must bear;\ncomprised what I felt and what I had learned. But I loved her: and now\nit even became some consolation to me, vaguely to conceive a distant day\nwhen I might blamelessly avow it; when all this should be over; when I\ncould say \"Agnes, so it was when I came home; and now I am old, and I\nnever have loved since!\"\n\nShe did not once show me any change in herself. What she always had been\nto me, she still was; wholly unaltered.\n\nBetween my aunt and me there had been something, in this connexion,\nsince the night of my return, which I cannot call a restraint, or an\navoidance of the subject, so much as an implied understanding that we\nthought of it together, but did not shape our thoughts into words. When,\naccording to our old custom, we sat before the fire at night, we often\nfell into this train; as naturally, and as consciously to each other, as\nif we had unreservedly said so. But we preserved an unbroken silence. I\nbelieved that she had read, or partly read, my thoughts that night; and\nthat she fully comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression.\n\nThis Christmas-time being come, and Agnes having reposed no new\nconfidence in me, a doubt that had several times arisen in my\nmind--whether she could have that perception of the true state of\nmy breast, which restrained her with the apprehension of giving me\npain--began to oppress me heavily. If that were so, my sacrifice was\nnothing; my plainest obligation to her unfulfilled; and every poor\naction I had shrunk from, I was hourly doing. I resolved to set this\nright beyond all doubt;--if such a barrier were between us, to break it\ndown at once with a determined hand.\n\nIt was--what lasting reason have I to remember it!--a cold, harsh,\nwinter day. There had been snow, some hours before; and it lay, not\ndeep, but hard-frozen on the ground. Out at sea, beyond my window, the\nwind blew ruggedly from the north. I had been thinking of it, sweeping\nover those mountain wastes of snow in Switzerland, then inaccessible to\nany human foot; and had been speculating which was the lonelier, those\nsolitary regions, or a deserted ocean.\n\n\"Riding to-day, Trot?\" said my aunt, putting her head in at the door.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I am going over to Canterbury. It's a good day for a\nride.\"\n\n\"I hope your horse may think so too,\" said my aunt; \"but at present he\nis holding down his head and his ears, standing before the door there,\nas if he thought his stable preferable.\"\n\nMy aunt, I may observe, allowed my horse on the forbidden ground, but\nhad not at all relented toward the donkeys.\n\n\"He will be fresh enough, presently!\" said I.\n\n\"The ride will do his master good, at all events,\" observed my aunt,\nglancing at the papers on my table. \"Ah, child, you pass a good many\nhours here! I never thought, when I used to read books, what work it was\nto write them.\"\n\n\"It's work enough to read them, sometimes,\" I returned. \"As to the\nwriting, it has its own charms, aunt.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see!\" said my aunt. \"Ambition, love of approbation, sympathy, and\nmuch more, I suppose? Well: go along with you!\"\n\n\"Do you know anything more,\" said I, standing composedly before her--she\nhad patted me on the shoulder, and sat down in my chair, \"of that\nattachment of Agnes?\"\n\nShe looked up in my face a little while, before replying:\n\n\"I think I do, Trot.\"\n\n\"Are you confirmed in your impression?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I think I am, Trot.\"\n\nShe looked so steadfastly at me: with a kind of doubt, or pity, or\nsuspense in her affection: that I summoned the stronger determination to\nshow her a perfectly cheerful face.\n\n\"And what is more, Trot--\" said my aunt.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"I think Agnes is going to be married.\"\n\n\"God bless her!\" said I, cheerfully.\n\n\"God bless her!\" said my aunt, \"and her husband too!\"\n\nI echoed it, parted from my aunt, went lightly down stairs, mounted, and\nrode away. There was greater reason than before to do what I had\nresolved to do.\n\nHow well I recollect the wintry ride! The frozen particles of ice,\nbrushed from the blades of grass by the wind, and borne across my face;\nthe hard clatter of the horse's hoofs, beating a tune upon the ground;\nthe stiff-tilled soil; the snow-drift, lightly eddying in the chalk-pit\nas the breeze ruffled it; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay,\nstopping to breathe on the hill-top, and shaking their bells musically;\nthe whitened slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the dark sky,\nas if they were drawn on a huge slate!\n\nI found Agnes alone. The little girls had gone to their own homes now,\nand she was alone by the fire, reading. She put down her book on seeing\nme come in; and having welcomed me as usual, took her work-basket and\nsat in one of the old-fashioned windows.\n\nI sat beside her on the window-seat, and we talked of what I was doing,\nand when it would be done, and of the progress I had made since my last\nvisit. Agnes was very cheerful; and laughingly predicted that I should\nsoon become too famous to be talked to, on such subjects.\n\n\"So I make the most of the present time, you see,\" said Agnes, \"and talk\nto you while I may.\"\n\nAs I looked at her beautiful face, observant of her work, she raised her\nmild clear eyes, and saw that I was looking at her.\n\n\"You are thoughtful to-day, Trotwood!\"\n\n\"Agnes, shall I tell you what about? I came to tell you.\"\n\nShe put aside her work, as she was used to do when we were seriously\ndiscussing anything; and gave me her whole attention.\n\n\"My dear Agnes, do you doubt my being true to you?\"\n\n\"No!\" she answered, with a look of astonishment.\n\n\"Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you?\"\n\n\"No!\" she answered, as before.\n\n\"Do you remember that I tried to tell you, when I came home, what a debt\nof gratitude I owed you, dearest Agnes, and how fervently I felt towards\nyou?\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" she said, gently, \"very well.\"\n\n\"You have a secret,\" said I. \"Let me share it, Agnes.\"\n\nShe cast down her eyes, and trembled.\n\n\"I could hardly fail to know, even if I had not heard--but from other\nlips than yours, Agnes, which seems strange--that there is some one upon\nwhom you have bestowed the treasure of your love. Do not shut me out of\nwhat concerns your happiness so nearly! If you can trust me, as you say\nyou can, and as I know you may, let me be your friend, your brother, in\nthis matter, of all others!\"\n\nWith an appealing, almost a reproachful, glance, she rose from the\nwindow; and hurrying across the room as if without knowing where, put\nher hands before her face, and burst into such tears as smote me to the\nheart.\n\nAnd yet they awakened something in me, bringing promise to my heart.\nWithout my knowing why, these tears allied themselves with the quietly\nsad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance, and shook me more with\nhope than fear or sorrow.\n\n\"Agnes! Sister! Dearest! What have I done!\"\n\n\"Let me go away, Trotwood. I am not well. I am not myself. I will speak\nto you by and by--another time. I will write to you. Don't speak to me\nnow. Don't! don't!\"\n\nI sought to recollect what she had said, when I had spoken to her on\nthat former night, of her affection needing no return. It seemed a very\nworld that I must search through in a moment.\n\n\"Agnes, I cannot bear to see you so, and think that I have been the\ncause. My dearest girl, dearer to me than anything in life, if you are\nunhappy, let me share your unhappiness. If you are in need of help or\ncounsel, let me try to give it to you. If you have indeed a burden on\nyour heart, let me try to lighten it. For whom do I live now, Agnes, if\nit is not for you!\"\n\n\"Oh, spare me! I am not myself! Another time!\" was all I could\ndistinguish.\n\nWas it a selfish error that was leading me away? Or, having once a clue\nto hope, was there something opening to me that I had not dared to think\nof?\n\n\"I must say more. I cannot let you leave me so! For Heaven's sake,\nAgnes, let us not mistake each other after all these years, and all that\nhas come and gone with them! I must speak plainly. If you have any\nlingering thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer; that\nI could not resign you to a dearer protector, of your own choosing; that\nI could not, from my removed place, be a contented witness of your joy;\ndismiss it, for I don't deserve it! I have not suffered quite in vain.\nYou have not taught me quite in vain. There is no alloy of self in what\nI feel for you.\"\n\nShe was quiet now. In a little time, she turned her pale face towards\nme, and said in a low voice, broken here and there, but very clear,\n\n\"I owe it to your pure friendship for me, Trotwood--which, indeed, I do\nnot doubt--to tell you, you are mistaken. I can do no more. If I have\nsometimes, in the course of years, wanted help and counsel, they have\ncome to me. If I have sometimes been unhappy, the feeling has passed\naway. If I have ever had a burden on my heart, it has been lightened for\nme. If I have any secret, it is--no new one; and is--not what you\nsuppose. I cannot reveal it, or divide it. It has long been mine, and\nmust remain mine.\"\n\n\"Agnes! Stay! A moment!\"\n\nShe was going away, but I detained her. I clasped my arm about her\nwaist. \"In the course of years!\" \"It is not a new one!\" New thoughts and\nhopes were whirling through my mind, and all the colors of my life were\nchanging.\n\n\"Dearest Agnes! Whom I so respect and honor--whom I so devotedly love!\nWhen I came here to-day, I thought that nothing could have wrested this\nconfession from me. I thought I could have kept it in my bosom all our\nlives, till we were old. But, Agnes, if I have indeed any new-born hope\nthat I may ever call you something more than Sister, widely different\nfrom Sister!----\"\n\nHer tears fell fast; but they were not like those she had lately shed,\nand I saw my hope brighten in them.\n\n\"Agnes! Ever my guide, and best support! If you had been more mindful of\nyourself, and less of me, when we grew up here together, I think my\nheedless fancy never would have wandered from you. But you were so much\nbetter than I, so necessary to me in every boyish hope and\ndisappointment, that to have you to confide in, and rely upon in\neverything, became a second nature, supplanting for the time the first\nand greater one of loving you as I do!\"\n\nStill weeping, but not sadly--joyfully! And clasped in my arms as she\nhad never been, as I had thought she never was to be!\n\n\"When I loved Dora--fondly, Agnes, as you know\"----\n\n\"Yes!\" she cried, earnestly. \"I am glad to know it!\"\n\n\"When I loved her--even then, my love would have been incomplete,\nwithout your sympathy. I had it, and it was perfected. And when I lost\nher, Agnes, what should I have been without you, still!\"\n\nCloser in my arms, nearer to my heart, her trembling hand upon my\nshoulder, her sweet eyes shining through her tears, on mine!\n\n\"I went away, dear Agnes, loving you. I stayed away, loving you. I\nreturned home, loving you!\"\n\nAnd now, I tried to tell her of the struggle I had had, and the\nconclusion I had come to. I tried to lay my mind before her, truly, and\nentirely. I tried to show her, how I had hoped I had come into the\nbetter knowledge of myself and of her; how I had resigned myself to what\nthat better knowledge brought; and how I had come there, even that day,\nin my fidelity to this. If she did so love me (I said) that she could\ntake me for her husband, she could do so, on no deserving of mine,\nexcept upon the truth of my love for her, and the trouble in which it\nhad ripened to be what it was; and hence it was that I revealed it. And\nO, Agnes, even out of thy true eyes, in that same time, the spirit of my\nchild-wife looked upon me, saying it was well; and winning me, through\nthee, to tenderest recollections of the Blossom that had withered in its\nbloom!\n\n                                 * * *\n\n\"I am so blest, Trotwood--my heart is so overcharged--but there is one\nthing I must say.\"\n\n\"Dearest, what?\"\n\nShe laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders, and looked calmly in my\nface.\n\n\"Do you know, yet, what it is?\"\n\n\"I am afraid to speculate on what it is. Tell me, my dear.\"\n\n\"I have loved you all my life!\"\n\n                                 * * *\n\nO, we were happy, we were happy! Our tears were not for the trials (hers\nso much the greater), through which we had come to be thus, but for the\nrapture of being thus, never to be divided more!\n\nWe walked, that winter evening, in the fields together; and the blessed\ncalm within us seemed to be partaken by the frosty air. The early stars\nbegan to shine while we were lingering on, and looking up to them we\nthanked our GOD for having guided us to this tranquillity.\n\nWe stood together in the same old-fashioned window at night, when the\nmoon was shining; Agnes with her quiet eyes raised up to it; I following\nher glance. Long miles of road then opened out before my mind; and,\ntoiling on, I saw a ragged way-worn boy, forsaken and neglected, who\nshould come to call even the heart now beating against mine, his own.\n\n                                 * * *\n\nIt was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt. She\nwas up in my study, Peggotty said: which it was her pride to keep in\nreadiness and order for me. We found her, in her spectacles, sitting by\nthe fire.\n\n\"Goodness me!\" said my aunt, peering through the dusk, \"who's this\nyou're bringing home?\"\n\n\"Agnes,\" said I.\n\nAs we had arranged to say nothing at first, my aunt was not a little\ndiscomfited. She darted a hopeful glance at me, when I said \"Agnes;\" but\nseeing that I looked as usual, she took off her spectacles in despair,\nand rubbed her nose with them.\n\nShe greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless; and we were soon in the\nlighted parlor down stairs, at dinner. My aunt put on her spectacles\ntwice or thrice, to take another look at me, but as often took them off\nagain, disappointed, and rubbed her nose with them. Much to the\ndiscomfiture of Mr. Dick, who knew this to be a bad symptom.\n\n\"By the by, aunt,\" said I, after dinner; \"I have been speaking to Agnes\nabout what you told me.\"\n\n\"Then, Trot,\" said my aunt, turning scarlet, \"you did wrong, and broke\nyour promise.\"\n\n\"You are not angry, aunt, I trust? I am sure you won't be, when you\nlearn that Agnes is not unhappy in any attachment.\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" said my aunt.\n\nAs my aunt appeared to be annoyed, I thought the best way was to cut her\nannoyance short. I took Agnes in my arm to the back of her chair, and we\nboth leaned over her. My aunt, with one clap of her hands, and one look\nthrough her spectacles, immediately went into hysterics, for the first\nand only time in all my knowledge of her.\n\nThe hysterics called up Peggotty. The moment my aunt was restored, she\nflew at Peggotty, and calling her a silly old creature, hugged her with\nall her might. After that, she hugged Mr. Dick (who was highly honored,\nbut a good deal surprised); and after that, told them why. Then, we were\nall happy together.\n\nI could not discover whether my aunt, in her last short conversation\nwith me, had fallen on a pious fraud, or had really mistaken the state\nof my mind. It was quite enough, she said, that she had told me Agnes\nwas going to be married; and that I now knew better than any one how\ntrue it was.\n\n                                 * * *\n\nWe were married within a fortnight. Traddles and Sophy, and Doctor and\nMrs. Strong, were the only guests at our quiet wedding. We left them\nfull of joy; and drove away together. Clasped in my embrace, I held the\nsource of every worthy aspiration I had ever had; the centre of myself,\nthe circle of my life, my own, my wife; my love of whom was founded on a\nrock!\n\n\"Dearest husband!\" said Agnes. \"Now that I may call you by that name, I\nhave one thing more to tell you.\"\n\n\"Let me hear it, love.\"\n\n\"It grows out of the night when Dora died. She sent you for me.\"\n\n\"She did.\"\n\n\"She told me that she left me something. Can you think what it was?\"\n\nI believed I could. I drew the wife who had so long loved me, closer to\nmy side.\n\n\"She told me that she made a last request to me, and left me a last\ncharge.\"\n\n\"And it was----\"\n\n\"That only I would occupy this vacant place.\"\n\nAnd Agnes laid her head upon my breast, and wept; and I wept with her,\nthough we were so happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nA VISITOR.\n\n\nWhat I have purposed to record is nearly finished; but there is yet an\nincident conspicuous in my memory, on which it often rests with delight,\nand without which one thread in the web I have spun, would have a\nravelled end.\n\nI had advanced in fame and fortune, my domestic joy was perfect, I had\nbeen married ten happy years. Agnes and I were sitting by the fire, in\nour house in London, one night in spring, and three of our children were\nplaying in the room, when I was told that a stranger wished to see me.\n\n  [Illustration: A Stranger calls to see me.]\n\nHe had been asked if he came on business, and had answered No; he had\ncome for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way. He was an\nold man, my servant said, and looked like a farmer.\n\nAs this sounded mysterious to the children, and moreover was like the\nbeginning of a favorite story Agnes used to tell them, introductory to\nthe arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloak who hated every body, it\nproduced some commotion. One of our boys laid his head in his mother's\nlap to be out of harm's way, and little Agnes (our eldest child) left\nher doll in a chair to represent her, and thrust out her little heap of\ngolden curls from between the window-curtains, to see what happened\nnext.\n\n\"Let him come in here!\" said I.\n\nThere soon appeared, pausing in the dark doorway as he entered, a hale,\ngrey-haired old man. Little Agnes, attracted by his looks, had run to\nbring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, when my wife,\nstarting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated voice, that it\nwas Mr. Peggotty!\n\nIt _was_ Mr. Peggotty. An old man now, but in a ruddy, hearty, strong\nold age. When our first emotion was over, and he sat before the fire\nwith the children on his knees, and the blaze shining on his face, he\nlooked, to me, as vigorous and robust, withal as handsome, an old man,\nas ever I had seen.\n\n\"Mas'r Davy,\" said he. And the old name in the old tone fell so\nnaturally on my ear! \"Mas'r Davy, 'tis a joyful hour as I see you, once\nmore, 'long with your own trew wife!\"\n\n\"A joyful hour indeed, old friend!\" cried I.\n\n\"And these heer pretty ones,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"To look at these heer\nflowers! Why, Mas'r Davy, you was but the heighth of the littlest of\nthese, when I first see you! When Em'ly warn't no bigger, and our poor\nlad were _but_ a lad!\"\n\n\"Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then,\" said I.\n\"But, let these dear rogues go to bed; and as no house in England but\nthis must hold you, tell me where to send for your luggage (is the old\nblack bag among it, that went so far, I wonder!), and then, over a glass\nof Yarmouth grog, we will have the tidings of ten years!\"\n\n\"Are you alone?\" asked Agnes.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he said, kissing her hand, \"quite alone.\"\n\nWe sat him between us, not knowing how to give him welcome enough; and\nas I began to listen to his old familiar voice, I could have fancied he\nwas still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece.\n\n\"It's a mort of water,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"fur to come across, and on'y\nstay a matter of fower weeks. But water ('specially when 'tis salt)\ncomes nat'ral to me; and friends is dear, and I am heer.--Which is\nverse,\" said Mr. Peggotty, surprised to find it out, \"though I hadn't\nsuch intentions.\"\n\n\"Are you going back those many thousand miles, so soon?\" asked Agnes.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he returned. \"I giv the promise to Em'ly, afore I come\naway. You see, I doen't grow younger as the years comes round, and if I\nhadn't sailed as 'twas, most like I shouldn't never have done 't. And\nit's allus been on my mind, as I _must_ come and see Mas'r Davy and your\nown sweet blooming self, in your wedded happiness, afore I got to be too\nold.\"\n\nHe looked at us, as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently.\nAgnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair, that he\nmight see us better.\n\n\"And now tell us,\" said I, \"everything relating to your fortunes.\"\n\n\"Our fortuns, Mas'r Davy,\" he rejoined, \"is soon told. We haven't\nfared nohows, but fared to thrive. We've allus thrived. We've worked\nas we ought to 't, and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so,\nbut we have allus thrived. What with sheep-farming, and what with\nstock-farming, and what with one thing and what with t'other, we are as\nwell to do, as well could be. Theer's been kiender a blessing fell upon\nus,\" said Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, \"and we've\ndone nowt but prosper. That is, in the long run. If not yesterday, why\nthen to-day. If not to-day, why then to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And Emily?\" said Agnes and I, both together.\n\n\"Em'ly,\" said he, \"arter you left her, ma'am--and I never heerd her\nsaying of her prayers at night, t'other side the canvas screen, when we\nwas settled in the Bush, but what I heerd your name--and arter she and\nme lost sight of Mas'r Davy, that theer shining sundown--was that low,\nat first, that, if she had know'd then what Mas'r Davy kep from us so\nkind and thowtful, 'tis my opinion she'd have drooped away. But theer\nwas some poor folks aboard as had illness among 'em, and she took care\nof _them_; and theer was the children in our company, and she took care\nof _them_; and so she got to be busy, and to be doing good, and that\nhelped her.\"\n\n\"When did she first hear of it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I kep it from her arter I heerd on't,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"going on\nnigh a year. We was living then in a solitary place, but among the\nbeautifullest trees, and with the roses a covering our Beein to the\nroof. Theer come along one day, when I was out a working on the land, a\ntraveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England (I doen't rightly\nmind which), and of course we took him in, and giv him to eat and drink,\nand made him welcome. We all do that, all the colony over. He'd got an\nold newspaper with him, and some other account in print of the storm.\nThat's how she know'd it. When I come home at night, I found she know'd\nit.\"\n\nHe dropped his voice as he said these words, and the gravity I so well\nremembered overspread his face.\n\n\"Did it change her much?\" we asked.\n\n\"Aye, for a good long time,\" he said, shaking his head; \"if not to this\npresent hour. But I think the solitoode done her good. And she had a\ndeal to mind in the way of poultry and the like, and minded of it, and\ncome through. I wonder,\" he said thoughtfully, \"if you could see my\nEm'ly now, Mas'r Davy, whether you'd know her!\"\n\n\"Is she so altered?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I doen't know. I see her ev'ry day, and doen't know; but, odd-times, I\nhave thowt so. A slight figure,\" said Mr. Peggotty, looking at the fire,\n\"kiender worn; soft, sorrowful, blue eyes; a delicate face; a pritty\nhead, leaning a little down; a quiet voice and way--timid a'most. That's\nEm'ly!\"\n\nWe silently observed him as he sat, still looking at the fire.\n\n\"Some thinks,\" he said, \"as her affection was ill-bestowed; some, as her\nmarriage was broke off by death. No one knows how 'tis. She might have\nmarried well, a mort of times, 'but, uncle,' she says to me, 'that's\ngone for ever.' Cheerful along with me; retired when others is by; fond\nof going any distance fur to teach a child, or fur to tend a sick\nperson, or fur to do some kindness tow'rds a young girl's wedding (and\nshe's done a many, but has never seen one); fondly loving of her uncle;\npatient; liked by young and old; sowt out by all that has any trouble.\nThat's Em'ly!\"\n\nHe drew his hand across his face, and with a half-suppressed sigh looked\nup from the fire.\n\n\"Is Martha with you yet?\" I asked.\n\n\"Martha,\" he replied \"got married, Mas'r Davy, in the second year. A\nyoung man, a farm-laborer, as come by us on his way to market with his\nmas'r's drays--a journey of over five hundred mile, theer and back--made\noffers fur to take her fur his wife (wives is very scarce theer), and\nthen to set up fur their two selves in the Bush. She spoke to me fur to\ntell him her trew story. I did. They was married, and they live fower\nhundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Gummidge?\" I suggested.\n\nIt was a pleasant key to touch, for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a\nroar of laughter, and rubbed his hands up and down his legs, as he had\nbeen accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked\nboat.\n\n\"Would you believe it!\" he said. \"Why, someun even made offers fur to\nmarry _her_! If a ship's cook that was turning settler, Mas'r Davy,\ndidn't make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge, I'm Gormed--and I can't\nsay no fairer than that!\"\n\nI never saw Agnes laugh so. This sudden ecstacy on the part of Mr.\nPeggotty was so delightful to her, that she could not leave off\nlaughing; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh, and the\ngreater Mr. Peggotty's ecstacy became, and the more he rubbed his legs.\n\n\"And what did Mrs. Gummidge say?\" I asked, when I was grave enough.\n\n\"If you'll believe me,\" returned Mr. Peggotty, \"Missis Gummidge, 'stead\nof saying 'thank you, I'm much obleeged to you, I ain't a going fur to\nchange my condition at my time of life,' up'd with a bucket as was\nstanding by, and laid it over that theer ship's cook's head 'till he\nsung out for help, and I went in and reskied of him.\"\n\nMr. Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter, and Agnes and I both\nkept him company.\n\n\"But I must say this, for the good creetur,\" he resumed, wiping his face\nwhen we were quite exhausted; \"she has been all she said she'd be to us,\nand more. She's the willingest, the trewest, the honestest-helping\nwoman, Mas'r Davy, as ever draw'd the breath of life. I have never\nknow'd her to be lone and lorn, for a single minute, not even when the\ncolony was all afore us, and we was new to it. And thinking of the old\n'un is a thing she never done, I do assure you, since she left England!\"\n\n\"Now, last, not least, Mr. Micawber,\" said I. \"He has paid off every\nobligation he incurred here--even to Traddles's bill, you remember, my\ndear Agnes--and therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing\nwell. But what is the latest news of him?\"\n\nMr. Peggotty, with a smile, put his hand in his breast-pocket, and\nproduced a flat-folded, paper parcel, from which he took out, with much\ncare, a little odd-looking newspaper.\n\n\"You are to unnerstan', Mas'r Davy,\" said he, \"as we have left the Bush\nnow, being so well to do; and have gone right away round to Port\nMiddlebay Harbor, wheer theer's what _we_ call a town.\"\n\n\"Mr. Micawber was in the Bush near you?\" said I.\n\n\"Bless you, yes,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \"and turned to with a will. I never\nwish to meet a better gen'lman for turning to, with a will. I've seen\nthat theer bald head of his, a perspiring in the sun, Mas'r Davy, 'till\nI a'most thowt it would have melted away. And now he's a Magistrate.\"\n\n\"A Magistrate, eh?\" said I.\n\nMr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper, where I\nread aloud as follows, from the \"Port Middlebay Times:\"\n\n     \"-->The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and\n     townsman, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, Port Middlebay District\n     Magistrate, came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel,\n     which was crowded to suffocation. It is estimated that not\n     fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with\n     dinner at one time, exclusive of the company in the passage and\n     on the stairs. The beauty, fashion, and exclusiveness of Port\n     Middlebay, flocked to do honor to one so deservedly esteemed, so\n     highly talented, and so widely popular. Doctor Mell (of Colonial\n     Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, and on\n     his right sat the distinguished guest. After the removal of the\n     cloth, and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully executed, and\n     in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes\n     of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR),\n     the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and\n     rapturously received. Doctor Mell, in a speech replete with\n     feeling, then proposed 'Our distinguished Guest, the ornament of\n     our town. May he never leave us but to better himself, and may\n     his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself\n     impossible!' The cheering with which the toast was received\n     defies description. Again and again it rose and fell, like the\n     waves of ocean. At length all was hushed, and WILKINS MICAWBER,\n     ESQUIRE, presented himself to return thanks. Far be it from us,\n     in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources\n     of our establishment, to endeavour to follow our distinguished\n     townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished\n     and highly-ornate address! Suffice it to observe, that it was a\n     masterpiece of eloquence; and that those passages in which he\n     more particularly traced his own successful career to its source,\n     and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals\n     of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable\n     to liquidate, brought a tear into the manliest eye present. The\n     remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL; MRS. MICAWBER (who gracefully\n     bowed her acknowledgments from the side-door, where a galaxy\n     of beauty was elevated on chairs, at once to witness and adorn\n     the gratifying scene); MRS. RIDGER BEGS (late Miss Micawber);\n     MRS. MELL; WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR (who convulsed the\n     assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to\n     return thanks in a speech, but would do so, with their permission,\n     in a song); MRS. MICAWBER'S FAMILY (well-known, it is needless to\n     remark, in the mother-country), &c. &c. &c. At the conclusion\n     of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic\n     for dancing. Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE, who disported\n     themselves until Sol gave warning for departure, Wilkins Micawber,\n     Esquire, Junior, and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena,\n     fourth daughter of Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable.\"\n\nI was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have\ndiscovered, in these happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor\npinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing to\nanother part of the paper, my eyes rested on my own name, and I read\nthus:\n\n                    \"TO DAVID COPPERFIELD, ESQUIRE,\n\n                          \"THE EMINENT AUTHOR.\n\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\n\n     \"Years have elapsed, since I had an opportunity of ocularly\n     perusing the lineaments, now familiar to the imaginations of a\n     considerable portion of the civilised world.\n\n     \"But, my dear sir, though estranged (by the force of circumstances\n     over which I have had no controul) from the personal society of\n     the friend and companion of my youth, I have not been unmindful of\n     his soaring flight. Nor have I been debarred,\n\n                Though seas between us braid ha' roared,\n\n     (BURNS) from participating in the intellectual feasts he has\n     spread before us.\n\n     \"I cannot, therefore, allow of the departure from this place of an\n     individual whom we mutually respect and esteem, without, my dear\n     sir, taking this public opportunity of thanking you, on my own\n     behalf, and, I may undertake to add, on that of the whole of the\n     Inhabitants of Port Middlebay, for the gratification of which you\n     are the ministering agent.\n\n     \"Go on, my dear sir! You are not unknown here, you are not\n     unappreciated. Though 'remote,' we are neither 'unfriended,'\n     'melancholy,' nor (I may add) 'slow.' Go on, my dear sir, in\n     your Eagle course! The Inhabitants of Port Middlebay may at\n     least aspire to watch it, with delight, with entertainment, with\n     instruction!\n\n     \"Among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the\n     globe, will ever be found, while it has light and life,\n\n                        \"The\n                           \"Eye\n                              \"Appertaining to\n                                          \"WILKINS MICAWBER,\n                                               \"Magistrate.\"\n\nI found, on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper, that\nMr. Micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that Journal.\nThere was another letter from him in the same paper, touching a bridge;\nthere was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him, to\nbe shortly republished, in a neat volume, \"with considerable additions;\"\nand, unless I am very much mistaken, the Leading Article was his also.\n\nWe talked much of Mr. Micawber, on many other evenings while Mr.\nPeggotty remained with us. He lived with us during the whole term of his\nstay,--which, I think, was something less than a month,--and his sister\nand my aunt came to London to see him. Agnes and I parted from him\naboardship, when he sailed; and we shall never part from him more, on\nearth.\n\nBut before he left, he went with me to Yarmouth, to see a little tablet\nI had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham. While I was copying\nthe plain inscription for him at his request, I saw him stoop, and\ngather a tuft of grass from the grave, and a little earth.\n\n\"For Em'ly,\" he said, as he put it in his breast. \"I promised, Mas'r\nDavy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nA LAST RETROSPECT.\n\n\nAnd now my written story ends. I look back, once more--for the last\ntime--before I close these leaves.\n\nI see myself, with Agnes at my side, journeying along the road of life.\nI see our children and our friends around us; and I hear the roar of\nmany voices, not indifferent to me as I travel on.\n\nWhat faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd? Lo, these;\nall turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question!\n\nHere is my aunt, in stronger spectacles, an old woman of fourscore years\nand more, but upright yet, and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch\nin winter weather.\n\nAlways with her, here comes Peggotty, my good old nurse, likewise in\nspectacles, accustomed to do needlework at night very close to the lamp,\nbut never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle, a yard measure\nin a little house, and a work-box with a picture of St. Paul's upon the\nlid.\n\nThe cheeks and arms of Peggotty, so hard and red in my childish days,\nwhen I wondered why the birds didn't peck her in preference to apples,\nare shrivelled now; and her eyes, that used to darken their whole\nneighbourhood in her face, are fainter (though they glitter still); but\nher rough forefinger, which I once associated with a pocket nutmeg\ngrater, is just the same, and when I see my least child catching at it\nas it totters from my aunt to her, I think of our little parlor at home,\nwhen I could scarcely walk. My aunt's old disappointment is set right,\nnow. She is godmother to a real living Betsey Trotwood; and Dora (the\nnext in order) says she spoils her.\n\nThere is something bulky in Peggotty's pocket. It is nothing smaller\nthan the Crocodile-Book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by\nthis time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across, but which\nPeggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic. I find it very\ncurious to see my own infant face, looking up at me from the Crocodile\nstories; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of\nSheffield.\n\nAmong my boys, this summer holiday time, I see an old man making giant\nkites, and gazing at them in the air, with a delight for which there are\nno words. He greets me rapturously, and whispers, with many nods and\nwinks, \"Trotwood, you will be glad to hear that I shall finish the\nMemorial when I have nothing else to do, and that your aunt's the most\nextraordinary woman in the world, sir!\"\n\nWho is this bent lady, supporting herself by a stick, and showing me a\ncountenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty,\nfeebly contending with a querulous, imbecile, fretful wandering of the\nmind? She is in a garden; and near her stands a sharp, dark, withered\nwoman, with a white scar on her lip. Let me hear what they say.\n\n\"Rosa, I have forgotten this gentleman's name.\"\n\nRosa bends over her, and calls to her, \"Mr. Copperfield.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see you, sir. I am sorry to observe you are in mourning. I\nhope Time will be good to you!\"\n\nHer impatient attendant scolds her, tells her I am not in mourning, bids\nher look again, tries to rouse her.\n\n\"You have seen my son, sir,\" says the elder lady. \"Are you reconciled?\"\n\nLooking fixedly at me, she puts her hand to her forehead, and moans.\nSuddenly, she cries, in a terrible voice, \"Rosa, come to me. He is\ndead!\" Rosa, kneeling at her feet, by turns caresses her, and quarrels\nwith her; now fiercely telling her, \"I loved him better than you ever\ndid!\"--now soothing her to sleep on her breast, like a sick child. Thus\nI leave them; thus I always find them; thus they wear their time away,\nfrom year to year.\n\nWhat ship comes sailing home from India, and what English lady is this,\nmarried to a growling old Scotch Croesus with great flaps of ears. Can\nthis be Julia Mills?\n\nIndeed it is Julia Mills, peevish and fine, with a black man to carry\ncards and letters to her on a golden salver, and a copper-colored woman\nin linen, with a bright handkerchief round her head, to serve her Tiffin\nin her dressing-room. But Julia keeps no diary in these days; never\nsings Affection's Dirge; eternally quarrels with the old Scotch Croesus,\nwho is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide. Julia is steeped in\nmoney to the throat, and talks and thinks of nothing else. I liked her\nbetter in the Desert of Sahara.\n\nOr perhaps this _is_ the Desert of Sahara! For, though Julia has a\nstately house, and mighty company, and sumptuous dinners every day, I\nsee no green growth near her; nothing that can ever come to fruit or\nflower. What Julia calls \"society,\" I see; among it Mr. Jack Maldon,\nfrom his Patent Place, sneering at the hand that gave it him, and\nspeaking to me, of the Doctor, as \"so charmingly antique.\" But when\nsociety is the name for such hollow gentlemen and ladies, Julia, and\nwhen its breeding is professed indifference to everything that can\nadvance or can retard mankind, I think we must have lost ourselves in\nthat same Desert of Sahara, and had better find the way out.\n\nAnd lo, the Doctor, always our good friend, laboring at his Dictionary\n(somewhere about the letter D), and happy in his home and wife. Also the\nOld Soldier, on a considerably reduced footing, and by no means so\ninfluential as in days of yore!\n\nWorking at his chambers in the Temple, with a busy aspect, and his hair\n(where he is not bald) made more rebellious than ever by the constant\nfriction of his lawyer's-wig, I come, in a later time, upon my dear old\nTraddles. His table is covered with thick piles of papers; and I say, as\nI look around me:\n\n\"If Sophy were your clerk, now, Traddles, she would have enough to do!\"\n\n\"You may say that, my dear Copperfield! But those were capital days,\ntoo, in Holborn Court! Were they not?\"\n\n\"When she told you you would be a Judge? But it was not the town talk\n_then_!\"\n\n\"At all events,\" says Traddles, \"if I ever am one----\"\n\n\"Why, you know you will be.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Copperfield, _when_ I am one, I shall tell the story, as\nI said I would.\"\n\nWe walk away, arm in arm. I am going to have a family dinner with\nTraddles. It is Sophy's birthday; and, on our road, Traddles discourses\nto me of the good fortune he has enjoyed.\n\n\"I really have been able, my dear Copperfield, to do all that I had most\nat heart. There's the Reverend Horace promoted to that living at four\nhundred and fifty pounds a year; there are our two boys receiving the\nvery best education, and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars\nand good fellows; there are three of the girls married very comfortably;\nthere are three more living with us; there are three more keeping house\nfor the Reverend Horace since Mrs. Crewler's decease; and all of them\nhappy.\"\n\n\"Except--\" I suggest.\n\n\"Except the Beauty,\" says Traddles. \"Yes. It was very unfortunate that\nshe should marry such a vagabond. But there was a certain dash and glare\nabout him that caught her. However, now we have got her safe at our\nhouse, and got rid of him, we must cheer her up again.\"\n\nTraddles's house is one of the very houses--or it easily may have\nbeen--which he and Sophy used to parcel out, in their evening walks. It\nis a large house; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room,\nand his boots with his papers; and he and Sophy squeeze themselves\ninto upper rooms, reserving the best bed-rooms for the Beauty and the\ngirls. There is no room to spare in the house; for more of \"the girls\"\nare here, and always are here, by some accident or other, than I know\nhow to count. Here, when we go in, is a crowd of them, running down to\nthe door, and handing Traddles about to be kissed, until he is out of\nbreath. Here, established in perpetuity, is the poor Beauty, a widow\nwith a little girl; here, at dinner on Sophy's birthday, are the three\nmarried girls with their three husbands, and one of the husband's\nbrothers, and another husband's cousin, and another husband's sister,\nwho appears to me to be engaged to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the\nsame simple, unaffected fellow as he ever was, sits at the foot of the\nlarge table like a Patriarch; and Sophy beams upon him, from the head,\nacross a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with Britannia\nmetal.\n\nAnd now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet, these\nfaces fade away. But, one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by\nwhich I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And\nthat remains.\n\nI turn my head, and see it, in its beautiful serenity, beside me. My\nlamp burns low, and I have written far into the night; but the dear\npresence, without which I were nothing, bears me company.\n\nO Agnes, O my soul, so may thy face be by me when I close my life\nindeed; so may I, when realities are melting from me like the shadows\nwhich I now dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing upward!\n\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\nThis ebook is derived from a digitisation of a signed first edition\npublished by Bradbury & Evans in 1850.\n\nHyphenation in this book is occasionally inconsistent.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":408,"split":"train"}
