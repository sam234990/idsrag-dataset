Men\u0102\u0160ndez y Pelayo saw it as a strange and exotic plot, like a parasitical vine. Rosaura has also been dismissed as the simple stock character of the jilted woman. With the British School of Calderonistas, this attitude changed. A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked. Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo's actions and also serves as Segismundo's guide, leading him to a final conversion. For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince. Others compare her first appearance, falling from a horse\/hippogriff to the plot of Ariosto's Orlando furioso where Astolfo (the name of the character who deceives Rosaura in our play), also rides the hippogriff and witnesses a prophecy of the return of the mythical Golden Age. For Frederick de Armas, Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto. When she goes to Court, she takes on the name of Astraea, the goddess of chastity and justice. Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return signals the return of a Golden Age. Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times. It is possible that Rosaura (an anagram of auroras, \"dawns\") could represent the return of a Golden Age during the reign of Segismundo, a figure that represents King Philip IV of Spain.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Life Is A Dream, by Pedro Calderon de la Barca\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He was educated at the Jesuit College in Madrid and at the\nUniversity of Salamanca; and a doubtful tradition says that he began\nto write plays at the age of thirteen. His literary activity was\ninterrupted for ten years, 1625-1635, by military service in Italy and\nthe Low Countries, and again for a year or more in Catalonia. In 1637\nhe became a Knight of the Order of Santiago, and in 1651 he entered the\npriesthood, rising to the dignity of Superior of the Brotherhood of San\nPedro in Madrid. He held various offices in the court of Philip IV, who\nrewarded his services with pensions, and had his plays produced with\ngreat splendor. He died May 5, 1681.\n\nAt the time when Calderon began to compose for the stage, the Spanish\ndrama was at its height. Lope de Vega, the most prolific and, with\nCalderon, the greatest, of Spanish dramatists, was still alive; and by\nhis applause gave encouragement to the beginner whose fame was to rival\nhis own. The national type of drama which Lope had established was\nmaintained in its essential characteristics by Calderon, and he produced\nabundant specimens of all its varieties. Of regular plays he has left\na hundred and twenty; of \"Autos Sacramentales,\" the peculiar Spanish\nallegorical development of the medieval mystery, we have seventy-three;\nbesides a considerable number of farces.\n\nThe dominant motives in Calderon's dramas are characteristically\nnational: fervid loyalty to Church and King, and a sense of honor\nheightened almost to the point of the fantastic. Though his plays\nare laid in a great variety of scenes and ages, the sentiment and the\ncharacters remain essentially Spanish; and this intensely local quality\nhas probably lessened the vogue of Calderon in other countries. In the\nconstruction and conduct of his plots he showed great skill, yet the\ningenuity expended in the management of the story did not restrain the\nfiery emotion and opulent imagination which mark his finest speeches\nand give them a lyric quality which some critics regard as his greatest\ndistinction.\n\nOf all Calderon's works, \"Life is a Dream\" may be regarded as the most\nuniversal in its theme. It seeks to teach a lesson that may be learned\nfrom the philosophers and religious thinkers of many ages--that the\nworld of our senses is a mere shadow, and that the only reality is to be\nfound in the invisible and eternal. The story which forms its basis\nis Oriental in origin, and in the form of the legend of \"Barlaam and\nJosaphat\" was familiar in all the literatures of the Middle Ages.\nCombined with this in the plot is the tale of Abou Hassan from the\n\"Arabian Nights,\" the main situations in which are turned to farcical\npurposes in the Induction to the Shakespearean \"Taming of the Shrew.\"\nBut with Calderon the theme is lifted altogether out of the atmosphere\nof comedy, and is worked up with poetic sentiment and a touch of\nmysticism into a symbolic drama of profound and universal philosophical\nsignificance.\n\n\n\n\n\nLIFE IS A DREAM\n\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\n     Basilio           King of Poland.\n     Segismund         his Son.\n     Astolfo           his Nephew.\n     Estrella          his Niece.\n     Clotaldo          a General in Basilio's Service.\n     Rosaura           a Muscovite Lady.\n     Fife              her Attendant.\n\n     Chamberlain, Lords in Waiting, Officers,\n     Soldiers, etc., in Basilio's Service.\n\n\nThe Scene of the first and third Acts lies on the Polish frontier: of\nthe second Act, in Warsaw.\n\nAs this version of Calderon's drama is not for acting, a higher and\nwider mountain-scene than practicable may be imagined for Rosaura's\ndescent in the first Act and the soldiers' ascent in the last. The bad\nwatch kept by the sentinels who guarded their state-prisoner, together\nwith much else (not all!) that defies sober sense in this wild drama, I\nmust leave Calderon to answer for; whose audience were not critical of\ndetail and probability, so long as a good story, with strong, rapid, and\npicturesque action and situation, was set before them.\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n\n\n\nSCENE I--A pass of rocks, over which a storm is rolling away,\n\nand the sun setting: in the foreground, half-way down, a fortress.\n\n\n(Enter first from the topmost rock Rosaura, as from horseback, in man's\nattire; and, after her, Fife.)\n\n     ROSAURA.\n     There, four-footed Fury, blast\n     Engender'd brute, without the wit\n     Of brute, or mouth to match the bit\n     Of man--art satisfied at last?\n     Who, when thunder roll'd aloof,\n     Tow'rd the spheres of fire your ears\n     Pricking, and the granite kicking\n     Into lightning with your hoof,\n     Among the tempest-shatter'd crags\n     Shattering your luckless rider\n     Back into the tempest pass'd?\n     There then lie to starve and die,\n     Or find another Phaeton\n     Mad-mettled as yourself; for I,\n     Wearied, worried, and for-done,\n     Alone will down the mountain try,\n     That knits his brows against the sun.\n\n     FIFE (as to his mule).\n     There, thou mis-begotten thing,\n     Long-ear'd lightning, tail'd tornado,\n     Griffin-hoof-in hurricano,\n     (I might swear till I were almost\n     Hoarse with roaring Asonante)\n     Who forsooth because our betters\n     Would begin to kick and fling\n     You forthwith your noble mind\n     Must prove, and kick me off behind,\n     Tow'rd the very centre whither\n     Gravity was most inclined.\n     There where you have made your bed\n     In it lie; for, wet or dry,\n     Let what will for me betide you,\n     Burning, blowing, freezing, hailing;\n     Famine waste you: devil ride you:\n     Tempest baste you black and blue:\n     (To Rosaura.)\n     There!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1063,"split":"train"}
