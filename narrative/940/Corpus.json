Theseus, the king of Athens, is serving a year's voluntary exile after having murdered a local king and his sons. His illegitimate son is Hippolytus, whose birth is the result of Theseus's rape of the Amazon Hippolyta. Hippolytus has been trained since childhood by the king of Troezen, Pittheus.\nAt the opening of the play Aphrodite, Goddess of love, explains that Hippolytus has sworn chastity and refuses to revere her. Instead, he honors the Goddess of the hunt, Artemis. This has led her to initiate a plan of vengeance on Hippolytus. When Hippolytus went to Athens two years previously Aphrodite inspired Phaedra, Hippolytus' stepmother, to fall in love with him.\nHippolytus appears with his followers and shows reverence to a statue of Artemis, a chaste goddess. A servant warns him about slighting Aphrodite, but Hippolytus refuses to listen.\nThe chorus, consisting of young married women of Troezen, enters and describes how Theseus's wife, Phaedra has not eaten or slept in three days. Phaedra, sickly, appears with her nurse. After an agonizing discussion, Phaedra finally confesses why she is ill: she loves Hippolytus. The nurse and the chorus are shocked. Phaedra explains that she must starve herself and die with her honor intact. However, the nurse quickly retracts her initial response and tells Phaedra that she has a magical charm to cure her. However, in an aside she reveals different plans.\nThe nurse, after making Hippolytus swear not to tell anyone, informs Hippolytus of Phaedra's desire and suggests that Hippolytus consider yielding to her. He reacts with a furious tirade and threatens to tell his father, Theseus, everything as soon as he arrives. Phaedra realizes disaster has fallen. After making the chorus swear secrecy, she goes inside and hangs herself.\nTheseus returns and discovers his wife's dead body. Because the chorus is sworn to secrecy, they cannot tell Theseus why she killed herself. Theseus discovers a letter on Phaedra's body, which falsely asserts that she was raped by Hippolytus. Enraged, Theseus curses his son either to death or at least exile. To execute the curse, Theseus calls upon his father, the god Poseidon, who has promised to grant his son three wishes. Hippolytus enters and protests his innocence but cannot tell the truth because of the binding oath that he swore. Taking his wife's letter as proof, Theseus exiles his son.\nThe chorus sings a lament for Hippolytus.\nA messenger enters and describes a gruesome scene to Theseus; as Hippolytus got in his chariot to leave the kingdom, a bull roared out of the sea, frightening his horses, which dashed his chariot among the rocks, dragging Hippolytus behind. Hippolytus seems to be dying. The messenger protests Hippolytus' innocence, but Theseus refuses to believe him.\nTheseus is glad that Hippolytus is suffering and about to die. But then the goddess, Artemis, appears and rages at Theseus for killing his own son; she brutally tells him the truth: there was no rape, Phaedra had lied, his son was innocent. Theseus is painfully devastated by this revelation. Hippolytus is carried in physically battered and barely clinging to life. In the last moments of the play, Hippolytus forgives his father, kind words are exchanged between father and son, and then Hippolytus dies.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Hippolytus and The Bacchae, by Euripides\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Rogers\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nEuripides, the youngest of the trio of great Greek tragedians was born at\nSalamis in 480 B.C., on the day when the Greeks won their momentous naval\nvictory there over the fleet of the Persians. The precise social status of\nhis parents is not clear but he received a good education, was early\ndistinguished as an athlete, and showed talent in painting and oratory. He\nwas a fellow student of Pericles, and his dramas show the influence of the\nphilosophical ideas of Anaxagoras and of Socrates, with whom he was\npersonally intimate. Like Socrates, he was accused of impiety, and this,\nalong with domestic infelicity, has been supposed to afford a motive for\nhis withdrawal from Athens, first  to Magnesia and later to the court of\nAnchela\u00c3\u00bcs in Macedonia where he died in 406 B.C.\n\nThe first tragedy of Euripides was produced when he was about twenty-five,\nand he was several times a victor in the tragic contests. In spite of the\nantagonisms which he aroused and the criticisms which were hurled upon him\nin, for example, the comedies of Aristophanes, he attained a very great\npopularity; and Plutarch tells that those Athenians who were taken captive\nin the disastrous Sicilian expedition of 413 B.C. were offered freedom by\ntheir captors if they could recite from the works of Euripides. Of the\nhundred and twenty dramas ascribed to Euripides, there have come down to\nus complete eighteen tragedies and one satyric drama, \"Cyclops,\"  beside\nnumerous fragments.\n\nThe works of Euripides are generally regarded as showing the beginning of\nthe decline of Greek tragedy. The idea of Fate hitherto dominant in the\nplays of his predecessors, tends to be degraded by him into mere chance;\nthe characters lose much of their ideal quality; and even gods and heroes\nare represented as moved by the petty motives of ordinary humanity. The\nchorus is often quite detached from the action; the poetry is florid; and\nthe action is frequently tinged with sensationalism. In spite of all this,\nEuripides remains a great poet; and his picturesqueness and tendencies to\nwhat are now called realism and romanticism, while marking his inferiority\nto the chaste classicism of Sophocles, bring him more easily within the\nsympathetic interest of the modern reader.\n\n\n\n\nHIPPOLYTUS\n\nOF EURIPIDES\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\n   THE GODDESS APHRODITE\n   THESEUS, _King of Athens and Troz\u00c3\u00aan_\n   PHAEDRA, _daughter of Minos, King of Crete, wife to Theseus_\n   HIPPOLYTUS, _bastard son of Theseus and the Amazon Hippolyte_\n   THE NURSE OF PHAEDRA\n   A HENCHMAN OF HIPPOLYTUS\n   THE GODDESS ARTEMIS\n   AN OLD HUNTSMAN\n   A CHORUS OF HUNTSMEN\n   ATTENDANTS ON THE THREE ROYAL PERSONS\n   A CHORUS OF TROZENIAN WOMEN, WITH THEIR LEADER\n\n_The scene is laid in Troz\u00c3\u00aan. The play was first acted when Epameinon\nwas Archon, Olympiad 87, year 4 (B.C. 429). Euripides was first,\nIophon second, Ion third._\n\n\n    APHRODITE\n  Great among men, and not unnamed am I,\n  The Cyprian, in God's inmost halls on high.\n  And wheresoe'er from Pontus to the far\n  Red West men dwell, and see the glad day-star,\n  And worship Me, the pious heart I bless,\n  And wreck that life that lives in stubbornness.\n  For that there is, even in a great God's mind,\n  That hungereth for the praise of human kind.\n\n  So runs my word; and soon the very deed\n  Shall follow. For this Prince of Theseus' seed,\n  Hippolytus, child of that dead Amazon,\n  And reared by saintly Pittheus in his own\n  Strait ways, hath dared, alone of all Troz\u00c3\u00aan,\n  To hold me least of spirits and most mean,\n  And spurns my spell and seeks no woman's kiss,\n  But great Apollo's sister, Artemis,\n  He holds of all most high, gives love and praise,\n  And through the wild dark woods for ever strays,\n  He and the Maid together, with swift hounds\n  To slay all angry beasts from out these bounds,\n  To more than mortal friendship consecrate!\n\n  I grudge it not. No grudge know I, nor hate;\n  Yet, seeing he hath offended, I this day\n  Shall smite Hippolytus. Long since my way\n  Was opened, nor needs now much labour more.\n\n  For once from Pittheus' castle to the shore\n  Of Athens came Hippolytus over-seas\n  Seeking the vision of the Mysteries.\n  And Phaedra there, his father's Queen high-born;\n  Saw him, and as she saw, her heart was torn\n  With great love, by the working of my will.\n  And for his sake, long since, on Pallas' hill,\n  Deep in the rock, that Love no more might roam,\n  She built a shrine, and named it _Love-at-home_:\n  And the rock held it, but its face alway\n  Seeks Troz\u00c3\u00aan o'er the seas. Then came the day\n  When Theseus, for the blood of kinsmen shed,\n  Spake doom of exile on himself, and fled,\n  Phaedra beside him, even to this Troz\u00c3\u00aan.\n  And here that grievous and amazed Queen,\n  Wounded and wondering, with ne'er a word,\n  Wastes slowly; and her secret none hath heard\n  Nor dreamed.\n\n  But never thus this love shall end!\n  To Theseus' ear some whisper will I send,\n  And all be bare! And that proud Prince, my foe,\n  His sire shall slay with curses. Even so\n  Endeth that boon the great Lord of the Main\n  To Theseus gave, the Three Prayers not in vain.\n\n  And she, not in dishonour, yet shall die.\n  I would not rate this woman's pain so high\n  As not to pay mine haters in full fee\n  That vengeance that shall make all well with me.\n\n  But soft, here comes he, striding from the chase,\n  Our Prince Hippolytus!--I will go my ways.--\n  And hunters at his heels: and a loud throng\n  Glorying Artemis with praise and song!\n  Little he knows that Hell's gates opened are,\n  And this his last look on the great Day-star!\n      [APHRODITE _withdraws, unseen by_ HIPPOLYTUS\n       _and a band of huntsmen, who enter from the left, singing.\n       They pass the Statue of_ APHRODITE _without notice._]\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  Follow, O follow me,\n  Singing on your ways\n  Her in whose hand are we,\n  Her whose own flock we be,\n  The Zeus-Child, the Heavenly;\n  To Artemis be praise!\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  Hail to thee, Maiden blest,\n  Proudest and holiest:\n  God's Daughter, great in bliss,\n  Leto-born, Artemis!\n  Hail to thee, Maiden, far\n  Fairest of all that are,\n  Yea, and most high thine home,\n  Child of the Father's hall;\n  Hear, O most virginal,\n  Hear, O most fair of all,\n  In high God's golden dome.\n\n    [_The huntsmen have gathered about the altar of_ ARTEMIS.\n     HIPPOLYTUS _now advances from them, and approaches the Statue\n     with a wreath in his hand._]\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  To thee this wreathed garland, from a green\n  And virgin meadow bear I, O my Queen,\n  Where never shepherd leads his grazing ewes\n  Nor scythe has touched. Only the river dews\n  Gleam, and the spring bee sings, and in the glade\n  Hath Solitude her mystic garden made.\n    No evil hand may cull it: only he\n  Whose heart hath known the heart of Purity,\n  Unlearned of man, and true whate'er befall.\n  Take therefore from pure hands this coronal,\n  O mistress loved, thy golden hair to twine.\n  For, sole of living men, this grace is mine,\n  To dwell with thee, and speak, and hear replies\n  Of voice divine, though none may see thine eyes.\n    Oh, keep me to the end in this same road!\n      [_An_ OLD HUNTSMAN, _who has stood apart from\n        the rest, here comes up to_ HIPPOLYTUS.]\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  My Prince--for \"Master\" name I none but God--\n  Gave I good counsel, wouldst thou welcome it?\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  Right gladly, friend; else were I poor of wit.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  Knowest thou one law, that through the world has won?\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  What wouldst thou? And how runs thy law? Say on.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  It hates that Pride that speaks not all men fair!\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  And rightly.   Pride breeds hatred everywhere.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  And good words love, and grace in all men's sight?\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  Aye, and much gain withal, for trouble slight.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  How deem'st thou of the Gods? Are they the same?\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  Surely: we are but fashioned on their frame.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  Why then wilt thou be proud, and worship not ...\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  Whom? If the name be speakable, speak out!\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  She stands here at thy gate: the Cyprian Queen!\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  I greet her from afar: my life is clean.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  Clean? Nay, proud, proud; a mark for all to scan!\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  Each mind hath its own bent, for God or man.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  God grant thee happiness ... and wiser thought!\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS\n  These Spirits that reign in darkness like me not.\n\n    HUNTSMAN\n  What the Gods ask, O Son, that man must pay!\n\n    HIPPOLYTUS (_turning from him to the others_).\n  On, huntsmen, to the Castle! Make your way\n  Straight to the feast room; 'tis a merry thing\n  After the chase, a board of banqueting.\n  And see the steeds be groomed, and in array\n  The chariot dight. I drive them forth to-day\n    [_He pauses, and makes a slight gesture of reverence to the Statue on\n     the left. Then to the_ OLD HUNTSMAN.]\n  That for thy Cyprian, friend, and nought beside!\n    [HIPPOLYTUS _follows the huntsmen, who stream by the central door in\n     the Castle.

Nay, be far and hear not then:\n  Gods should be gentler and more wise than men!\n    [_He rises and follows the others into the Castle_.]\n\n    _The Orchestra is empty for a moment, then there enter from right and\n    left several Trosenian women young and old.

And, to mine eyes,\n  Not in man's knowledge, not in wisdom, lies\n  The lack that makes for sorrow. Nay, we scan\n  And know the right--for wit hath many a man--\n  But will not to the last end strive and serve.\n  For some grow too soon weary, and some swerve\n  To other paths, setting before the Right\n  The diverse far-off image of Delight:\n  And many are delights beneath the sun!\n  Long hours of converse; and to sit alone\n  Musing--a deadly happiness!--and Shame:\n  Though two things there be hidden in one name,\n  And Shame can be slow poison if it will;\n    This is the truth I saw then, and see still;\n  Nor is there any magic that can stain\n  That white truth for me, or make me blind again.\n  Come, I will show thee how my spirit hath moved.\n  When the first stab came, and I knew I loved,\n  I cast about how best to face mine ill.\n  And the first thought that came, was to be still\n  And hide my sickness.--For no trust there is\n  In man's tongue, that so well admonishes\n  And counsels and betrays, and waxes fat\n  With griefs of its own gathering!--After that\n  I would my madness bravely bear, and try\n  To conquer by mine own heart's purity.\n    My third mind, when these two availed me naught\n  To quell love was to die--\n    [_Motion of protest among the Women._]\n           --the best, best thought--\n  --Gainsay me not--of all that man can say!\n  I would not have mine honour hidden away;\n  Why should I have my shame before men's eyes\n  Kept living?

Cursed be they whose lips are clean\n  And wise and seemly, but their hearts within\n  Rank with bad daring! How can they, O Thou\n  That walkest on the waves, great Cyprian, how\n  Smile in their husbands' faces, and not fall,\n  Not cower before the Darkness that knows all,\n  Aye, dread the dead still chambers, lest one day\n  The stones find voice, and all be finished!\n                                               Nay,\n  Friends, 'tis for this I die; lest I stand there\n  Having shamed my husband and the babes I bare.\n  In ancient Athens they shall some day dwell,\n  My babes, free men, free-spoken, honourable,\n\n    EURIPIDES\n  And when one asks their mother, proud of me!\n  For, oh, it cows a man, though bold he be,\n  To know a mother's or a father's sin.\n    'Tis written, one way is there, one, to win\n  This life's race, could man keep it from his birth,\n  A true clean spirit.

And must all lovers die, then? All\n  That are or shall be? A blithe law for them!\n  Nay, when in might she swoops, no strength can stem\n  Cypris; and if man yields him, she is sweet;\n  But is he proud and stubborn? From his feet\n  She lifts him, and--how think you?--flings to scorn!\n    She ranges with the stars of eve and morn,\n  She wanders in the heaving of the sea,\n  And all life lives from her.--Aye, this is she\n  That sows Love's seed and brings Love's fruit to birth;\n  And great Love's brethren are all we on earth!\n    Nay, they who con grey books of ancient days\n  Or dwell among the Muses, tell--and praise--\n  How Zeus himself once yearned for Semel\u00c3\u00aa;\n  How maiden E\u00c3\u00b4s in her radiancy\n  Swept Kephalos to heaven away, away,\n  For sore love's sake. And there they dwell, men say,\n  And fear not, fret not; for a thing too stern\n  Hath met and crushed them!\n                          And must thou, then, turn\n  And struggle? Sprang there from thy father's blood\n  Thy little soul all lonely? Or the god\n  That rules thee, is he other than our gods?\n    Nay, yield thee to men's ways, and kiss their rods!\n  How many, deem'st thou, of men good and wise\n  Know their own home's blot, and avert their eyes?\n  How many fathers, when a son has strayed\n  And toiled beneath the Cyprian, bring him aid,\n  Not chiding? And man's wisdom e'er hath been\n  To keep what is not good to see, unseen!\n    A straight and perfect life is not for man;\n  Nay, in a shut house, let him, if he can,\n  'Mid sheltered rooms, make all lines true. But here,\n  Out in the wide sea fallen, and full of fear,\n  Hopest thou so easily to swim to land?\n    Canst thou but set thine ill days on one hand\n  And more good days on the other, verily,\n  O child of woman, life is well with thee!\n\n    [_She pauses, and then draws nearer to_ PHAEDRA.]\n\n  Nay, dear my daughter, cease thine evil mind,\n  Cease thy fierce pride! For pride it is, and blind,\n  To seek to outpass gods!--Love on and dare:\n  A god hath willed it! And, since pain is there,\n  Make the pain sleep! Songs are there to bring calm,\n  And magic words. And I shall find the balm,\n  Be sure, to heal thee.

We crave\n  Not that. Tis honour, honour, we must save!\n\n    NURSE\n  Why prate so proud!

Lock those lips, and ne'er again\n  Let word nor thought so foul have harbour there!\n\n    NURSE\n  Foul, if thou wilt: but better than the fair\n  For thee and me. And better, too, the deed\n  Behind them, if it save thee in thy need,\n  Than that word Honour thou wilt die to win!\n\n    PHAEDRA\n  Nay, in God's name,--such wisdom and such sin\n  Are all about thy lips!--urge me no more.\n  For all the soul within me is wrought o'er\n  By Love; and if thou speak and speak, I may\n  Be spent, and drift where now I shrink away.\n\n    NURSE\n  Well, if thou wilt!--'Twere best never to err,\n  But, having erred, to take a counsellor\n  Is second.--Mark me now.

Some new stroke hath touched, unknown to me,\n  The sister cities of my sovranty?\n\n    HENCHMAN\n  Hippolytus is...Nay, not dead; but stark\n  Outstretched, a hairsbreadth this side of the dark.\n\n    THESEUS (_as though unmoved_)\n  How slain? Was there some other man, whose wife\n  He had like mine denied, that sought his life?\n\n    HENCHMAN\n  His own wild team destroyed him, and the dire\n  Curse of thy lips.\n                    The boon of thy great Sire\n  Is granted thee, O King, and thy son slain.\n\n    THESEUS\n  Ye Gods! And thou, Poseidon! Not in vain\n  I called thee Father; thou hast heard my prayer!\n  How did he die? Speak on. How closed the snare\n  Of Heaven to slay the shamer of my blood?\n\n    HENCHMAN\n  'Twas by the bank of beating sea we stood,\n  We thralls, and decked the steeds, and combed each mane;\n  Weeping; for word had come that ne'er again\n  The foot of our Hippolytus should roam\n  This land, but waste in exile by thy doom.\n    So stood we till he came, and in his tone\n  No music now save sorrow's, like our own,\n  And in his train a concourse without end\n  Of many a chase-fellow and many a friend.\n  At last he brushed his sobs away, and spake:\n  \"Why this fond loitering? I would not break\n  My Father's law--Ho, there! My coursers four\n  And chariot, quick! This land is mine no more.\"\n    Thereat, be sure, each man of us made speed.\n  Swifter than speech we brought them up, each steed\n  Well dight and shining, at our Prince's side.\n  He grasped the reins upon the rail: one stride\n  And there he stood, a perfect charioteer,\n  Each foot in its own station set. Then clear\n  His voice rose, and his arms to heaven were spread:\n  \"O Zeus, if I be false, strike thou me dead!\n  But, dead or living, let my Father see\n  One day, how falsely he hath hated me!\"\n    Even as he spake, he lifted up the goad\n  And smote; and the steeds sprang. And down the road\n  We henchmen followed, hard beside the rein,\n  Each hand, to speed him, toward the Argive plain\n  And Epidaurus.\n                    So we made our way\n  Up toward the desert region, where the bay\n  Curls to a promontory near the verge\n  Of our Troz\u00c3\u00aan, facing the southward surge\n  Of Saron's gulf. Just there an angry sound,\n  Slow-swelling, like God's thunder underground\n  Broke on us, and we trembled. And the steeds\n  Pricked their ears skyward, and threw back their heads.\n  And wonder came on all men, and affright,\n  Whence rose that awful voice. And swift our sight\n  Turned seaward, down the salt and roaring sand.\n    And there, above the horizon, seemed to stand\n  A wave unearthly, crested in the sky;\n  Till Skiron's Cape first vanished from mine eye,\n  Then sank the Isthmus hidden, then the rock\n  Of Epidaurus. Then it broke, one shock\n  And roar of gasping sea and spray flung far,\n  And shoreward swept, where stood the Prince's car.\n    Three lines of wave together raced, and, full\n  In the white crest of them, a wild Sea-Bull\n  Flung to the shore, a fell and marvellous Thing.\n  The whole land held his voice, and answering\n  Roared in each echo. And all we, gazing there,\n  Gazed seeing not; 'twas more than eyes could bear.\n    Then straight upon the team wild terror fell.\n  Howbeit, the Prince, cool-eyed and knowing well\n  Each changing mood a horse has, gripped the reins\n  Hard in both hands; then as an oarsman strains\n  Up from his bench, so strained he on the thong,\n  Back in the chariot swinging. But the young\n  Wild steeds bit hard the curb, and fled afar;\n  Nor rein nor guiding hand nor morticed car\n  Stayed them at all. For when he veered them round,\n  And aimed their flying feet to grassy ground,\n  In front uprose that Thing, and turned again\n  The four great coursers, terror-mad. But when\n  Their blind rage drove them toward the rocky places,\n  Silent and ever nearer to the traces,\n  It followed rockward, till one wheel-edge grazed.\n    The chariot tript and flew, and all was mazed\n  In turmoil. Up went wheel-box with a din,\n  Where the rock jagged, and nave and axle-pin.\n  And there--the long reins round him--there was he\n  Dragging, entangled irretrievably.\n  A dear head battering at the chariot side,\n  Sharp rocks, and rippled flesh, and a voice that cried:\n  \"Stay, stay, O ye who fattened at my stalls,\n  Dash me not into nothing!--O thou false\n  Curse of my Father!--Help! Help, whoso can,\n  An innocent, innocent and stainless man!\"\n    Many there were that laboured then, I wot,\n  To bear him succour, but could reach him not,\n  Till--who knows how?--at last the tangled rein\n  Unclasped him, and he fell, some little vein\n  Of life still pulsing in him.\n                                All beside,\n  The steeds, the horn\u00c3\u00a8d Horror of the Tide,\n  Had vanished--who knows where?--in that wild land.\n    O King, I am a bondsman of thine hand;\n  Yet love nor fear nor duty me shall win\n  To say thine innocent son hath died in sin.\n  All women born may hang themselves, for me,\n  And swing their dying words from every tree\n  On Ida! For I know that he was true!\n\n    LEADER\n  O God, so cometh new disaster, new\n  Despair! And no escape from what must be!\n\n    THESEUS\n  Hate of the man thus stricken lifted me\n  At first to joy at hearing of thy tale;\n  But now, some shame before the Gods, some pale\n  Pity for mine own blood, hath o'er me come.\n  I laugh not, neither weep, at this fell doom.\n\n    HENCHMAN\n  How then? Behoves it bear him here, or how\n  Best do thy pleasure?--Speak, Lord. Yet if thou\n  Wilt mark at all my word, thou wilt not be\n  Fierce-hearted to thy child in misery.\n\n    THESEUS\n  Aye, bring him hither. Let me see the face\n  Of him who durst deny my deep disgrace\n  And his own sin; yea, speak with him, and prove\n  His clear guilt by God's judgments from above.\n    [_The_ HENCHMAN _departs to fetch_ HIPPOLYTUS; THESEUS _sits waiting in\n     stern gloom, while the_ CHORUS _sing.

And thy Phaedra, panic-eyed,\n  Wrote a false writ, and slew thy son, and died,\n  Lying; but thou wast nimble to believe!\n    [THESEUS, _at first bewildered, then dumfounded,\n     now utters a deep groan._]\n  It stings thee, Theseus?--Nay, hear on and grieve\n  Yet sorer. Wottest thou three prayers were thine\n  Of sure fulfilment, from thy Sire divine?\n  Hast thou no foes about thee, then, that one--\n  Thou vile King!--must be turned against thy son?\n  The deed was thine.

And with them all\n   The seed of womankind from hut and hall\n   Of Thebes, hath this my magic goaded out.\n   And there, with the old King's daughters, in a rout\n   Confused, they make their dwelling-place between\n   The roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.\n   Thus shall this Thebes, how sore soe'er it smart,\n   Learn and forget not, till she crave her part\n   In mine adoring; thus must I speak clear\n   To save my mother's fame, and crown me here,\n   As true God, born by Semel\u00c3\u00aa to Zeus.\n\n   Now Cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use\n   Of royal honour to his daughter's son\n   Pentheus; who on my body hath begun\n   A war with God. He thrusteth me away\n   From due drink-offering, and, when men pray,\n   My name entreats not. Therefore on his own\n   Head and his people's shall my power be shown.\n   Then to another land, when all things here\n   Are well, must I fare onward, making clear\n   My godhead's might. But should this Theban town\n   Essay with wrath and battle to drag down\n   My maids, lo, in their path myself shall be,\n   And maniac armies battled after me!\n   For this I veil my godhead with the wan\n   Form of the things that die, and walk as Man.\n\n   O Brood of Tmolus o'er the wide world flown,\n   O Lydian band, my chosen and mine own,\n   Damsels uplifted o'er the orient deep\n   To wander where I wander, and to sleep\n   Where I sleep; up, and wake the old sweet sound,\n   The clang that I and mystic Rhea found,\n   The Timbrel of the Mountain! Gather all\n   Thebes to your song round Pentheus' royal hall.\n   I seek my new-made worshippers, to guide\n   Their dances up Kithaeron's pine clad side.\n\n     [_As he departs, there comes stealing in from the left a band of fifteen\n      Eastern Women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long white\n      robes and ivy-bound hair.

The flame\n   They say, of Bacchios wraps them. Bacchios! Nay,\n   'Tis more to Aphrodite that they pray.\n   Howbeit, all that I have found, my men\n   Hold bound and shackled in our dungeon den;\n   The rest, I will go hunt them! Aye, and snare\n   My birds with nets of iron, to quell their prayer\n   And mountain song and rites of rascaldom!\n   They tell me, too, there is a stranger come,\n   A man of charm and spell, from Lydian seas,\n   A head all gold and cloudy fragrancies,\n   A wine-red cheek, and eyes that hold the light\n   Of the very Cyprian. Day and livelong night\n   He haunts amid the damsels, o'er each lip\n   Dangling his cup of joyance! Let me grip\n   Him once, but once, within these walls, right swift\n   That wand shall cease its music, and that drift\n   Of tossing curls lie still--when my rude sword\n   Falls between neck and trunk! 'Tis all his word,\n   This tale of Dionysus; how that same\n   Babe that was blasted by the lightning flame\n   With his dead mother, for that mother's lie,\n   Was re-conceived, born perfect from the thigh\n   Of Zeus, and now is God! What call ye these?\n   Dreams? Gibes of the unknown wanderer? Blasphemies\n   That crave the very gibbet?\n                              Stay! God wot,\n   Here is another marvel! See I not\n   In motley fawn-skins robed the vision-seer\n   Teiresias? And my mother's father here--\n   O depth of scorn!--adoring with the wand\n   Of Bacchios?--Father!--Nay, mine eyes are fond;\n   It is not your white heads so fancy-flown!\n   It cannot be! Cast off that ivy crown,\n   O mine own mother's sire! Set free that hand\n   That cowers about its staff.\n                           'Tis thou hast planned\n   This work, Teiresias!

Swift are thine, and bright\n   As though with thought, yet have no thought at all\n     Lo this new God, whom thou dost flout withal,\n   I cannot speak the greatness wherewith He\n   In Hellas shall be great! Two spirits there be,\n   Young Prince, that in man's world are first of worth.\n   D\u00c3\u00aam\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aar one is named; she is the Earth--\n   Call her which name thou will!--who feeds man's frame\n   With sustenance of things dry. And that which came\n   Her work to perfect, second, is the Power\n   From Semel\u00c3\u00aa born. He found the liquid show\n   Hid in the grape. He rests man's spirit dim\n   From grieving, when the vine exalteth him.\n   He giveth sleep to sink the fretful day\n   In cool forgetting. Is there any way\n   With man's sore heart, save only to forget?\n     Yea, being God, the blood of him is set\n   Before the Gods in sacrifice, that we\n   For his sake may be blest.--And so, to thee,\n   That fable shames him, how this God was knit\n   Into God's flesh? Nay, learn the truth of it\n   Cleared from the false.--When from that deadly light\n   Zeus saved the babe, and up to Olympus' height\n   Raised him, and Hera's wrath would cast him thence\n   Then Zeus devised him a divine defence.\n   A fragment of the world-encircling fire\n   He rent apart, and wrought to his desire\n   Of shape and hue, in the image of the child,\n   And gave to Hera's rage. And so, beguiled\n   By change and passing time, this tale was born,\n   How the babe-god was hidden in the torn\n   Flesh of his sire. He hath no shame thereby.\n     A prophet is he likewise. Prophecy\n   Cleaves to all frenzy, but beyond all else\n   To frenzy of prayer. Then in us verily dwells\n   The God himself, and speaks the thing to be.\n   Yea, and of Ares' realm a part hath he.\n   When mortal armies, mail\u00c3\u00aad and arrayed,\n   Have in strange fear, or ever blade met blade,\n   Fled maddened, 'tis this God hath palsied them.\n   Aye, over Delphi's rock-built diadem\n   Thou yet shalt see him leaping with his train\n   Of fire across the twin-peaked mountain-plain,\n   Flaming the darkness with his mystic wand,\n   And great in Hellas.--List and understand,\n   King Pentheus! Dream not thou that force is power;\n   Nor, if thou hast a thought, and that thought sour\n   And sick, oh, dream not thought is wisdom!--Up,\n   Receive this God to Thebes; pour forth the cup\n   Of sacrifice, and pray, and wreathe thy brow.\n     Thou fearest for the damsels? Think thee now;\n   How toucheth this the part of Dionyse\n   To hold maids pure perforce? In them it lies,\n   And their own hearts; and in the wildest rite\n   Cometh no stain to her whose heart is white.\n     Nay, mark me! Thou hast thy joy, when the Gate\n   Stands thronged, and Pentheus' name is lifted great\n   And high by Thebes in clamour; shall not He\n   Rejoice in his due meed of majesty?\n     Howbeit, this Cadmus whom thou scorn'st and I\n   Will wear His crown, and tread His dances! Aye,\n   Our hairs are white, yet shall that dance be trod!\n   I will not lift mine arm to war with God\n   For thee nor all thy words. Madness most fell\n   Is on thee, madness wrought by some dread spell,\n   But not by spell nor leechcraft to be cured!\n\n     CHORUS\n   Grey prophet, worthy of Phoebus is thy word,\n   And wise in honouring Bromios, our great God.\n\n     CADMUS\n   My son, right well Teiresias points thy road.\n   Oh, make thine habitation here with us,\n   Not lonely, against men's uses. Hazardous\n   Is this quick bird-like beating of thy thought\n   Where no thought dwells.--Grant that this God be naught,\n   Yet let that Naught be Somewhat in thy mouth;\n   Lie boldly, and say He is! So north and south\n   Shall marvel, how there sprang a thing divine\n   From Semel\u00c3\u00aa's flesh, and honour all our line.\n                     [_Drawing nearer to_ PENTHEUS.]\n     Is there not blood before thine eyes even now?\n   Our lost Actaeon's blood, whom long ago\n   His own red hounds through yonder forest dim\n   Tore unto death, because he vaunted him\n   Against most holy Artemis?

O'er their shoulders first they shed\n   Their tresses, and caught up the fallen fold\n   Of mantles where some clasp had loosened hold,\n   And girt the dappled fawn-skins in with long\n   Quick snakes that hissed and writhed with quivering tongue.\n   And one a young fawn held, and one a wild\n   Wolf cub, and fed them with white milk, and smiled\n   In love, young mothers with a mother's breast\n   And babes at home forgotten! Then they pressed\n   Wreathed ivy round their brows, and oaken sprays\n   And flowering bryony. And one would raise\n   Her wand and smite the rock, and straight a jet\n   Of quick bright water came. Another set\n   Her thyrsus in the bosomed earth, and there\n   Was red wine that the God sent up to her,\n   A darkling fountain. And if any lips\n   Sought whiter draughts, with dipping finger-tips\n   They pressed the sod, and gushing from the ground\n   Came springs of milk. And reed-wands ivy-crowned\n   Ran with sweet honey, drop by drop.--O King,\n   Hadst thou been there, as I, and seen this thing,\n   With prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone\n   To adore this God whom now thou rail'st upon!\n     Howbeit, the kine-wardens and shepherds straight\n   Came to one place, amazed, and held debate;\n   And one being there who walked the streets and scanned\n   The ways of speech, took lead of them whose hand\n   Knew but the slow soil and the solemn hill,\n   And flattering spoke, and asked: \"Is it your will,\n   Masters, we stay the mother of the King,\n   Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa, from her lawless worshipping,\n   And win us royal thanks?\"--And this seemed good\n   To all; and through the branching underwood\n   We hid us, cowering in the leaves. And there\n   Through the appointed hour they made their prayer\n   And worship of the Wand, with one accord\n   Of heart and cry--\"Iacchos, Bromios, Lord,\n   God of God born!\"--And all the mountain felt,\n   And worshipped with them; and the wild things knelt\n   And ramped and gloried, and the wilderness\n   Was filled with moving voices and dim stress.\n     Soon, as it chanced, beside my thicket-close\n   The Queen herself passed dancing, and I rose\n   And sprang to seize her. But she turned her face\n   Upon me: \"Ho, my rovers of the chase,\n   My wild White Hounds, we are hunted! Up, each rod\n   And follow, follow, for our Lord and God!\"\n   Thereat, for fear they tear us, all we fled\n   Amazed; and on, with hand unweapon\u00c3\u00a8d\n   They swept toward our herds that browsed the green\n   Hill grass. Great uddered kine then hadst thou seen\n   Bellowing in sword-like hands that cleave and tear,\n   A live steer riven asunder, and the air\n   Tossed with rent ribs or limbs of cloven tread,\n   And flesh upon the branches, and a red\n   Rain from the deep green pines. Yea, bulls of pride,\n   Horns swift to rage, were fronted and aside\n   Flung stumbling, by those multitudinous hands\n   Dragged pitilessly. And swifter were the bands\n   Of garb\u00c3\u00a8d flesh and bone unbound withal\n   Than on thy royal eyes the lids may fall.\n     Then on like birds, by their own speed upborne,\n   They swept toward the plains of waving corn\n   That lie beside Asopus' banks, and bring\n   To Thebes the rich fruit of her harvesting.\n   On Hysiae and Erythrae that lie nursed\n   Amid Kithaeron's bowering rocks, they burst\n   Destroying, as a foeman's army comes.\n   They caught up little children from their homes,\n   High on their shoulders, babes unheld, that swayed\n   And laughed and fell not; all a wreck they made;\n   Yea, bronze and iron did shatter, and in play\n   Struck hither and thither, yet no wound had they;\n   Caught fire from out the hearths, yea, carried hot\n   Flames in their tresses and were scorch\u00c3\u00a8d not!\n     The village folk in wrath took spear and sword,\n   And turned upon the Bacchae. Then, dread Lord,\n   The wonder was. For spear nor barb\u00c3\u00a8d brand\n   Could scathe nor touch the damsels; but the Wand,\n   The soft and wreath\u00c3\u00a8d wand their white hands sped,\n   Blasted those men and quelled them, and they fled\n   Dizzily. Sure some God was in these things!\n     And the holy women back to those strange springs\n   Returned, that God had sent them when the day\n   Dawned, on the upper heights; and washed away\n   The stain of battle. And those girdling snakes\n   Hissed out to lap the waterdrops from cheeks\n   And hair and breast.\n                         Therefore I counsel thee\n   O King, receive this Spirit, whoe'er he be,\n   To Thebes in glory. Greatness manifold\n   Is all about him; and the tale is told\n   That this is he who first to man did give\n   The grief-assuaging vine. Oh, let him live;\n   For if he die, then Love herself is slain,\n   And nothing joyous in the world again!\n\n     LEADER\n   Albeit I tremble, and scarce may speak my thought\n   To a king's face, yet will I hide it not.\n   Dionyse is God, no God more true nor higher!\n\n     PENTHEUS\n   It bursts hard by us, like a smothered fire,\n   This frenzy of Bacchic women! All my land\n   Is made their mock.--This needs an iron hand!\n     Ho, Captain! Quick to the Electran Gate;\n   Bid gather all my men-at-arms thereat;\n   Call all that spur the charger, all who know\n   To wield the orb\u00c3\u00a8d targe or bend the bow;\n   We march to war--'Fore God, shall women dare\n   Such deeds against us? 'Tis too much to bear!\n\n     DIONYSUS\n   Thou mark'st me not, O King, and holdest light\n   My solemn words; yet, in thine own despite,\n   I warn thee still. Lift thou not up thy spear\n   Against a God, but hold thy peace, and fear\n   His wrath! He will not brook it, if thou fright\n   His Chosen from the hills of their delight.\n\n     PENTHEUS\n   Peace, thou! And if for once thou hast slipped chain,\n   Give thanks!--Or shall I knot thine arms again?\n\n     DIONYSUS\n   Better to yield him prayer and sacrifice\n   Than kick against the pricks, since Dionyse\n   Is God, and thou but mortal.\n\n     PENTHEUS\n       That will I!\n   Yea, sacrifice of women's blood, to cry\n   His name through all Kithaeron!\n\n     DIONYSUS\n                  Ye shall fly,\n   All, and abase your shields of bronzen rim\n   Before their wands.\n\n     PENTHEUS\n                There is no way with him,\n   This stranger that so dogs us! Well or ill\n   I may entreat him, he must babble still!\n\n     DIONYSUS\n   Wait, good my friend! These crooked matters may\n   Even yet be straightened.\n     [PENTHEUS _has started as though to seek his army at the gate._]\n\n     PENTHEUS\n       Aye, if I obey\n   Mine own slaves' will; how else?\n\n     DIONYSUS\n       Myself will lead\n   The damsels hither, without sword or steed.\n\n     PENTHEUS\n   How now?--This is some plot against me!\n\n     DIONYSUS\n                                      What\n   Dost fear?

And there\n   The Maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,\n   Busily glad. Some with an ivy chain\n   Tricked a worn wand to toss its locks again;\n   Some, wild in joyance, like young steeds set free,\n   Made answering songs of mystic melody.\n\n   But my poor master saw not the great band\n   Before him. \"Stranger,\" he cried, \"where we stand\n   Mine eyes can reach not these false saints of thine.\n   Mount we the bank, or some high-shouldered pine,\n   And I shall see their follies clear!\" At that\n   There came a marvel. For the Stranger straight\n   Touched a great pine-tree's high and heavenward crown,\n   And lower, lower, lower, urged it down\n   To the herbless floor. Round like a bending bow,\n   Or slow wheel's rim a joiner forces to.\n   So in those hands that tough and mountain stem\n   Bowed slow--oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them!--\n   To the very earth. And there he set the King,\n   And slowly, lest it cast him in its spring.\n   Let back the young and straining tree, till high\n   It towered again amid the towering sky;\n   And Pentheus in the branches! Well, I ween,\n   He saw the Maenads then, and well was seen!\n   For scarce was he aloft, when suddenly\n   There was no stranger any more with me,\n   But out of Heaven a Voice--oh, what voice else?--\n   'Twas He that called! \"Behold, O damosels,\n   I bring ye him who turneth to despite\n   Both me and ye, and darkeneth my great Light.\n   Tis yours to avenge!\"   So spake he, and there came\n   'Twixt earth and sky a pillar of high flame.\n   And silence took the air, and no leaf stirred\n   In all the forest dell. Thou hadst not heard\n   In that vast silence any wild things's cry.\n   And up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,\n   Agaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.\n   Then came the Voice again. And when they knew\n   Their God's clear call, old Cadmus' royal brood,\n   Up, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,\n   On flying feet they came, his mother blind,\n   Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa, and her sisters, and behind\n   All the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,\n   Through the angry rocks and torrent-tossing glen,\n   Until they spied him in the dark pine-tree:\n   Then climbed a crag hard by and furiously\n   Some sought to stone him, some their wands would fling\n   Lance-wise aloft, in cruel targeting.\n   But none could strike. The height o'ertopped their rage,\n   And there he clung, unscathed, as in a cage\n   Caught. And of all their strife no end was found.\n   Then, \"Hither,\" cried Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa; \"stand we round\n   And grip the stem, my Wild Ones, till we take\n   This climbing cat-o'-the-mount! He shall not make\n   A tale of God's high dances!\" Out then shone\n   Arm upon arm, past count, and closed upon\n   The pine, and gripped; and the ground gave, and down\n   It reeled. And that high sitter from the crown\n   Of the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry\n   Fell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by\n   Was horror visible. 'Twas his mother stood\n   O'er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.\n   He tore the coif, and from his head away\n   Flung it, that she might know him, and not slay\n   To her own misery. He touched the wild\n   Cheek, crying: \"Mother, it is I, thy child,\n   Thy Pentheus, born thee in Echion's hall!\n   Have mercy, Mother! Let it not befall\n   Through sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son!\"\n     But she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run\n   Like leaping fire, with thoughts that ne'er should be\n   On earth, possessed by Bacchios utterly,\n   Stays not nor hears.   Round his left arm she put\n   Both hands, set hard against his side her foot,\n   Drew ... and the shoulder severed!--not by might\n   Of arm, but easily, as the God made light\n   Her hand's essay. And at the other side\n   Was Ino rending; and the torn flesh cried,\n   And on Autono\u00c3\u00ab pressed, and all the crowd\n   Of ravening arms. 'Yea, all the air was loud\n   With groans that faded into sobbing breath,\n   Dim shrieks, and joy, and triumph-cries of death.\n   And here was borne a severed arm, and there\n   A hunter's booted foot; white bones lay bare\n   With rending; and swift hands ensanguin\u00c3\u00a8d\n   Tossed as in sport the flesh of Pentheus dead.\n   His body lies afar. The precipice\n     Hath part, and parts in many an interstice\n   Lurk of the tangled woodland--no light quest\n   To find. And, ah, the head! Of all the rest,\n   His mother hath it, pierced upon a wand,\n   As one might pierce a lion's, and through the land,\n   Leaving her sisters in their dancing place,\n   Bears it on high! Yea, to these walls her face\n   Was set, exulting in her deed of blood,\n   Calling upon her Bromios, her God,\n   Her Comrade, Fellow-Render of the Prey,\n   Her All-Victorious, to whom this day\n   She bears in triumph ... her own broken heart.\n     For me, after that sight, I will depart\n   Before Agave comes.--Oh, to fulfil\n   God's laws, and have no thought beyond His will,\n   Is man's best treasure.   Aye, and wisdom true,\n   Methinks, for things of dust to cleave unto!\n     [_The_ MESSENGER _departs into the Castle_.]\n\n       CHORUS\n\n     _Some Maidens_\n   Weave ye the dance, and call\n       Praise to God!\n   Bless ye the Tyrant's fall!\n       Down is trod\n   Pentheus, the Dragon's Seed!\n   Wore he the woman's weed?\n   Clasped he his death indeed,\n       Clasped the rod?\n\n     _A Bacchanal_\n   Yea, the wild ivy lapt him, and the doomed\n   Wild Bull of Sacrifice before him loomed!\n\n     _Others_\n   Ye who did Bromios scorn,\n       Praise Him the more,\n   Bacchanals, Cadmus-born;\n       Praise with sore\n   Agony, yea, with tears!\n   Great are the gifts he bears!\n   Hands that a mother rears\n       Red with gore!\n\n     LEADER\n   But stay, Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa cometh!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":940,"split":"train"}
