{"ori_id":"ced7681fb9a12261d500c0f98c25a2eee17ee215","title":"The Just and the Unjust","context":"The Just and the Unjust\n The novel has a prologue of several court docket entries in the case of Commonwealth v. Stanley Howell and Robert Basso. The first entry, dated May 31, 1939, indicates that the three defendants in a case of capital murder\u00e2\u0080\u0094Robert Basso, Stanley Howell, and Roy Leming\u00e2\u0080\u0094have all been declared indigent and had attorneys appointed for them. A second, dated June 12, indicates that the trial of Basso and Howell has been severed from that of Leming, now defended by an attorney of questionable character.\nThe defendants and their victim are all \"foreigners\u00e2\u0080\u0094the people from somewhere else.\" They have been charged with the cold-blooded murder of a drug dealer and addict, Frederick Zollicoffer, whom they had kidnapped for ransom on April 6, and killed afterwards on or about April 17, possibly at the direction of a fourth criminal who died in a fall trying to escape from police in New York City. The F.B.I. had also entered the case and arrested Howell, from whom they had extracted a confession.Unlike many courtoom dramas, The Just and the Unjust is selective in its actual presentation of courtoom events. Not all witnesses are presented, and testimony and arguments are incomplete. However Cozzens displays an ear for what is mundane to the reader's interest and what is germane to characterization, if not to plot. He develops two legal subplots of a sex scandal involving a local high school teacher and a vehicular homicide case involving the son of an influential politician, and weaves their storylines into the ongoing trial, allowing Cozzens to cut away from what are often tedious courtroom procedures.\nThese legal plot lines are supported by personal complications in Abner Coates' life, as he tries to reason out whether or not he wants to run for district attorney (and beholden to Jesse Gearhart), get married, and how to deal with his infirm father.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Just and the Unjust, by Vaughan Kester,\nIllustrated by M.

But what pleased Custer best was\nwhen his father, ceasing to be gently discursive and becoming vigorously\npersonal, added yet another canto to the stirring epic of William\nShrimplin.\n\nCuster was wholly and delightfully sympathetic. There was, he felt, the\nvery choicest inspiration in the narrative, always growing and\nexpanding, of his father's earlier career, before Mrs. Shrimplin came\ninto his life, and as Mr. Shrimplin delicately intimated, tied him hand\nand foot. The same grounds of mutual understanding and intellectual\ndependence which existed between Custer and his father were lacking\nwhere Mrs. Shrimplin was concerned. She was unromantic, with a painfully\nliteral cast of mind, though Custer--without knowing what is meant by a\nsense of humor, suspected her of this rare gift, a dangerous and\ndestructive thing in woman. Privately considering her relation to his\nfather, he was forced to the conclusion that their union was a most\ndistressing instance of the proneness of really great minds to leave\ntheir deep channels and seek the shallow waters in the every-day\nconcerns of life. He felt vaguely that she was narrow and provincial;\nfor had she not always lived on the flats, a region bounded by the\nSquare on the north and by Stoke's furniture factory on the south? On\nthe west the flats extended as far as civilization itself extended in\nthat direction, that is, to the gas house and the creek bank, while on\nthe east they were roughly defined by Mitchell's tannery and the brick\nslaughter-house, beyond which vacant lots merged into cow pastures, the\ncow pastures yielding in their turn to the real country, where the level\nvalley rolled up into hills which tilted the great green fields to the\nsun.\n\nMrs. Shrimplin had been born on the flats, and the flats had witnessed\nher meeting and mating with Shrimplin, when that gentleman had first\nappeared in Mount Hope in the interest of Whiting's celebrated\ntooth-powder, to the use of which he was not personally committed. At\nthat time he was also an itinerant bill-poster and had his lodgings at\nMaxy Schaffer's Railroad Hotel hard by the B. & O. tracks.\n\nMr. Shrimplin was five feet three, and narrow chested. A drooping flaxen\nmustache shaded a sloping chin and a loose under lip, while a pair of\npale eyes looked sadly out upon the world from the shadow of a hooked\nnose.\n\nMr. Joe Montgomery, Mrs. Shrimplin's brother-in-law, present on the\noccasion of her marriage to the little bill-poster, had critically\nsurveyed the bridegroom and had been moved to say to a friend, \"Shrimp\ncertainly do favor a peanut!\"\n\nMr. Montgomery's comparative criticism of her husband's appearance had\nin due season reached the ears of the bride, and had caused a rupture\nin the family that the years had not healed, but her resentment had been\nmore a matter of justice to herself than that she felt the criticism to\nbe wholly inapt.\n\nMr. Shrimplin had now become a public servant, for certain gasolene\nlamps in the town of Mount Hope were his proud and particular care. Any\nnight he could be seen seated in his high two-wheeled cart drawn by a\nhorse large in promise of speed but small in achievement, a hissing\ngasolene torch held between his knees, making his way through that part\nof the town where gas-lamps were as yet unknown. He still further added\nto his income by bill-posting and paper-hanging, for he belonged to the\nrank and file of life, with a place in the procession well toward the\ntail.\n\nBut Custer had no suspicion of this. He never saw his father as the\nworld saw him. He would have described his eye as piercing; he would\nhave said, in spite of the slouching uncertainty that characterized all\nhis movements, that he was as quick as a cat; and it was only Custer who\ndetected the note of authority in the meek tones of his father's voice.\n\nAnd Custer was as like the senior Shrimplin as it was possible for\nfourteen to be like forty-eight. His mother said, \"He certainly looks\nfor all the world like his pa!\" but her manner of saying it left doubt\nas to whether she rejoiced in the fact; for, while Mr. Shrimplin was\nundoubtedly a hero to Custer, he was not and never had been and never\ncould be a hero to Mrs. Shrimplin. She saw in him only what the world\nsaw--a stoop-shouldered little man who spent six days of the seven in\noveralls that were either greasy or pasty.\n\nIt was a vagary of Mr. Shrimplin's that ten reckless years of his life\nhad been spent in the West, the far West, the West of cow-towns and bad\nmen; that for this decade he had flourished on bucking broncos and in\ngilded bars, the admired hero of a variety of deft homicides. Out of his\ninner consciousness he had evolved a sprightly epic of which he was the\ncentral figure, a figure, according to Custer's firm belief, sinister,\nfateful with big jingling silver spurs at his heels and iron on his\nhips, whose specialty was manslaughter.\n\nIn the creation of his romance he might almost be said to have acquired\na literary habit of mind, to which he was measurably helped by the\nfiction he read.\n\nCuster devoured the same books; but he never suspected his father of the\ncrime of plagiarism, nor guessed that his choicest morsels of adventure\ninvolved a felony. Mrs. Shrimplin felt it necessary to protest:\n\n\"No telling with what nonsense you are filling that boy's head!\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Mr. Shrimplin, narrowing his eyes to a slit, as if he\nexpected to see pictured on the back of their lids the panorama of\nCuster's future, \"I hope I am filling his head with just nonsense\nenough so he will never crawfish, no matter what kind of a proposition\nhe goes up against!\"\n\nCuster colored almost guiltily. Could he ever hope to attain to the grim\nstandard his father had set for him?\n\n\"I wasn't much older than him when I shot Murphy at Fort Worth,\"\ncontinued Mr. Shrimplin, \"You've heard me tell about him, son--old\none-eye Murphy of Texarcana?\"\n\n\"He died, I suppose!\" said. Mrs. Shrimplin, wringing out her dish-rag.\n\"Dear knows! I wonder you ain't been hung long ago!\"\n\n\"Did he die!\" rejoined Mr. Shrimplin ironically. \"Well, they usually die\nwhen I begin to throw lead!\" He tugged fiercely at the ends of his\ndrooping flaxen mustache and gazed into the wide and candid eyes of his\nson.\n\n\"Like I should give you the particulars, Custer?\" he inquired.\n\nCuster nodded eagerly, and Mr. Shrimplin cleared his throat.\n\n\"He was called one-eye Murphy because he had only one eye--he'd lost the\nother in a rough-and-tumble fight; it had been gouged out by a feller's\nthumb. Murphy got the feller's ear, chewed it off as they was rolling\nover and over on the floor, so you might say they swapped even.\"\n\n\"I wonder you'd pick on an afflicted person like that,\" observed Mrs.\nShrimplin.\n\n\"Afflicted! Well, he could see more and see further with that one eye\nthan most men could with four!\"\n\n\"I should think four eyes would be confusin',\" said Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\nMr. Shrimplin folded his arms across his narrow chest and permitted his\nglance to follow Mrs. Shrimplin's ample figure as she moved to and fro\nabout the room; and when he spoke again a gentle melancholy had crept\ninto his tone.\n\n\"I dunno but a man makes a heap of sacrifices he never gets no credit\nfor when he marries and settles down. The ladies ain't what they used to\nbe. They look on a man now pretty much as a meal-ticket. I guess if a\nfeller chewed off another feller's ear in Mount Hope he'd never hear the\nlast of it!\"\n\nAs neither Mrs. Shrimplin nor Custer questioned this point, Mr.\nShrimplin reverted to his narrative.\n\n\"I started in to tell you how I put Murphy out of business, didn't I,\nson? The facts brought out by the coroner's jury,\" embarking on what he\nconceived to be a bit of happy and elaborate realism, \"was that I'd shot\nhim in self-defense after he'd drawed a gun on me. He had heard I was at\nFort Worth--not that I was looking for trouble, which I never done; but\nI never turned it down when any one was at pains to fetch it to me; I\nwas always willing they should leave it with me for to have a merry\ntime. Murphy heard I'd said if he'd come to Fort Worth I'd take him home\nand make a pet of him; and he'd sent back word that he was looking for\na man with two ears to play with; and I'd said mine was on loose and for\nhim to come and pull 'em off. After that there was just one thing he\ncould do if he wanted to be well thought of, and he done it. He hit the\ntown hell-snorting, and so mad he was fit to be tied.\" Mr. Shrimplin\npaused to permit this striking phrase to lay hold of Custer's\nimagination. \"Yes, sir, hell-snorting, and so bad he was plum scairt of\nhimself. He said he was looking for a gentleman who had sent him word he\nhad two ears to contribute to the evening's gaiety, by which I knowed he\nmeant me and was in earnest. He was full of boot-leg whisky--\"\n\n\"What kind of whisky's that, pa?\" asked Custer.\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Shrimplin, looking into the round innocent face of his\nson, \"that's the stuff the traders used to sell the Indians. Strong?\nWell, you might say it was middling strong--just middling--about three\ndrops of it would make a rabbit spit in a bulldog's face!\"\n\nIt was on one memorable twenty-seventh of November that Mr. Shrimplin\nreached this height of verbal felicity, and being Thanksgiving day, it\nwas, aside from the smell of strong yellow soap and the fresh-starched\nwhite shirt, very like a Sunday.\n\nHe and Custer sat before the kitchen stove and in the intervals of his\nnarrative listened to the wind rise without, and watched the sparse\nflakes of fine snow that it brought coldly out of the north, where\nthe cloud banks lay leaden and chill on the far horizon.\n\n[Illustration: \"I started to tell you how I put Murphy out of\nbusiness.\"]\n\nMr. Shrimplin had risen early that day, or, as he told Custer, he had\n\"got up soon\", and long before his son had left his warm bed in the\nsmall room over the kitchen, was well on his rounds in his high\ntwo-wheeled cart, with the rack under the seat which held the great cans\nof gasolene from which the lamps were filled. He had only paused at Maxy\nSchaffer's Railroad Hotel to partake of what he called a Kentucky\nbreakfast--a drink of whisky and a chew of tobacco--a simple dietary\nprotection against the evils of an empty stomach, to which he\nparticularly drew Custer's attention.\n\nHis father's occupation was entirely satisfactory to Custer. Being\nemployed by the town gave him an official standing, perhaps not so\ndistinguished as that of a policeman, but still eminently worth while;\nand Mr. Shrimplin added not a little to the sense of its importance by\ndilating on the intrigues of ambitious rivals who desired to wrest his\ncontract from him; and he impressed Custer, who frequently accompanied\nhim on his rounds, with the wisdom of keeping the lamps that shone upon\nthe homes of members of the town council in especially good order.\nFurthermore, there were possibilities of adventure in the occupation; it\ntook Mr. Shrimplin into out-of-the-way streets and unfrequented alleys,\nand, as Custer knew, he always went armed. Sometimes, when in an\nunusually gracious mood, his father permitted him to verify this fact\nby feeling his bulging hip pocket. The feel of it was vastly pleasing to\nCuster, particularly when Mr. Shrimplin had to tell of strangers engaged\nin mysterious conversation on dark street corners, who slunk away as he\napproached. More than this, it was a matter of public knowledge that he\nhad had numerous controversies in low portions of the town touching the\nright of the private citizen to throw stones at the street lamps; to\nCuster he made dire threats. He'd \"toss a scare into them red necks yet!\nThey'd bust his lamps once too often--he was laying for them! He knowed\npretty well who done it, and when he found out for sure--\" He winked at\nCuster, leaving it to his son's imagination to determine just what form\nhis vengeance would take, and Custer, being nothing if not sanguinary,\nprayed for bloodshed.\n\nBut the thing that pleased the boy best was his father's account of\nthose meetings with mysterious strangers. How as he approached they\nmoved off with many a furtive backward glance; how he made as if to\ndrive away in the opposite direction, and then at the first corner\nturned swiftly about and raced down some parallel street in hot pursuit,\nto come on them again, to their great and manifest discomfiture.\nCircumstantially he described each turn he made, down what streets he\ndrove Bill at a gallop, up which he walked that trustworthy animal; all\nwas elaborately worked out. The chase, however, always ended one\nway--the strangers disappeared unaccountably, and, search as he might,\nhe could not find them again, but he and Custer felt certain that his\nactivity had probably averted some criminal act.\n\nIn short, to Mr. Shrimplin and his son the small events of life\nmagnified themselves, becoming distorted and portentous. A man, emerging\nsuddenly from an alley in the dusk of the early evening, furnished them\nwith a theme for infinite speculation and varied conjecture; that nine\ntimes out of ten the man said, \"Hello, Shrimp!\" and passed on his way\nperfectly well known to the little lamplighter was a matter of not the\nslightest importance. Sometimes, it is true, Mr. Shrimplin told of the\nsalutation, but the man was always a stranger to him, and that he should\nhave spoken, calling him by name, he and Custer agreed only added to the\nsinister mystery of the encounter.\n\nIt was midday on that twenty-seventh of November when Mr. Shrimplin\nkilled Murphy of the solitary eye, and he reached the climax of the\nstory just as Mrs. Shrimplin began to prepare the dressing for the small\nturkey that was to be the principal feature of their four-o'clock\ndinner. The morning's scanty fall of snow had been so added to as time\npassed that now it completely whitened the strip of brown turf in the\nlittle side yard beyond the kitchen windows.\n\n\"I think,\" said Mr. Shrimplin, \"we are going to see some weather. Well,\nsnow ain't a bad thing.\" His dreamy eyes rested on Custer for an\ninstant; they seemed to invite a question.\n\n\"No?\" said Custer interrogatively.\n\n\"If I was going to murder a man, I don't reckon I'd care to do it when\nthere was snow on the ground.\"\n\nMrs. Shrimplin here suggested cynically that perhaps he dreaded cold\nfeet, but her husband ignored this. To what he felt to be the\ncommonplaceness of her outlook he had long since accustomed himself. He\nmerely said:\n\n\"I suppose more criminals has been caught because they done their crimes\nwhen it was snowing than any other way. Only chance a feller would have\nto get off without leaving tracks would be in a balloon; I don't know as\nI ever heard of a murderer escaping in a balloon, but I reckon it could\nbe done.\"\n\nHe disliked to relinquish such an original idea, and the subject of\nmurderers and balloons, with such ramifications as suggested themselves\nto his mind, occupied him until dinner-time. He quitted the table to\nprepare for his night's work, and at five o'clock backed wild Bill into\nthe shafts of his high cart, lighted the hissing gasolene torch, and\nmounted to his seat.\n\n\"I expect he'll want his head to-night; he's got a game look,\" he said\nto Custer, nodding toward Bill. Then, as he tucked a horse blanket\nsnugly about his legs, he added: \"It's a caution the way he gets over\nthe ground. I never seen a horse that gets over the ground like Bill\ndoes.\"\n\nWhich was probably true enough, for Bill employed every known gait.\n\n\"He's a mighty well-broke horse!\" agreed Custer in a tone of sincere\nconviction.\n\n\"He is. He's got more gaits than you can shake a stick at!\" said Mr.\nShrimplin.\n\nPrivately he labored under the delusion that Bill was dangerous; even\nyears of singular rectitude on Bill's part had failed to alter his\noriginal opinion on this one point, and he often told Custer that he\nwould have felt lost with a horse just anybody could have driven, for\nwhile Bill might not and probably would not have suited most people, he\nsuited him all right.\n\n\"Well, good-by, son,\" said Mr. Shrimplin, slapping Bill with the lines.\n\nBill went out of the alley back of Mr. Shrimplin's small barn, his head\nheld high, and taking tremendous strides that somehow failed in their\npurpose if speed was the result desired.\n\nTwilight deepened; the snow fell softly, silently, until it became a\nghostly mist that hid the town--hid the very houses on opposite sides of\nthe street, and through this flurry Bill shuffled with unerring\ninstinct, dragging Mr. Shrimplin from lamp-post to lamp-post, until\npresently down the street a long row of lights blazed red in the\nswirling smother of white.\n\nCuster re\u00c3\u00abntered the house. The day held the sentiment of Sunday and\nthis he found depressing. He had also dined ambitiously, and this he\nfound even more depressing. He wondered vaguely, but with no large\nmeasure of hope, if there would be sledding in the morning. Probably it\nwould turn warm during the night; he knew how those things went. From\nhis seat by the stove he watched the hurrying flakes beyond the windows,\nand as he watched, the darkness came down imperceptibly until he ceased\nto see beyond the four walls of the room.\n\nMrs. Shrimplin was busy with her mending. She did not attempt\nconversation with her son, though she occasionally cast a curious glance\nin his direction; he was not usually so silent. All at once the boy\nstarted.\n\n\"What's that?\" he cried.\n\n\"La, Custer, how you startle a body! It's the town bell. I should think\nyou'd know; you've heard it often enough.\" As she spoke she glanced at\nthe clock on the shelf in the corner of the room. \"I guess that clock's\nstopped again,\" she added, but in the silence that followed her words\nthey both heard it tick.\n\nThe bell rang on.\n\n\"It ain't half past seven yet. Maybe it's a fire!\" said Custer. He\nquitted his chair and moved to the window. \"I wish they'd give the ward.\nThey'd ought to. How's a body to know--\"\n\n\"Set down, Custer!\" commanded his mother sharply. \"You ain't going out!\nYou know your pa don't allow you to go to no fires after night.\"\n\n\"You don't call this night!\" He was edging toward the door.\n\n\"Yes, I do!\"\n\n\"A quarter after seven ain't night!\" he expostulated.\n\n\"No arguments, Custer! You sit down! I won't have you trapesing about\nthe streets.\"\n\nCuster turned back from the door and resumed his seat.\n\n\"Why don't they give the ward? I never heard such a fool way of ringing\nfor a fire!\" he said.\n\nThey were silent, intent and listening. Now the wind was driving the\nsound clamorously across the town.\n\n\"They ain't give the ward yet!\" said Custer at length, in a tone of\ngreat disgust. \"I could ring for a fire better than that!\"\n\n\"I wish your pa was to home!\" said Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\nAs she spoke they caught the muffled sound of hurrying feet, then the\nclamor of voices, eager and excited; but presently these died away in\nthe distance, and again they heard only the bell, which rang on and on\nand on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE PRICE OF FOLLY\n\n\nJohn North occupied the front rooms on the first floor of the\nthree-story brick structure that stood at the corner of Main Street and\nthe Square. The only other tenant on the floor with him was Andy\nGilmore, who had apartments at the back of the building. Until quite\nrecently Mr. North and Mr. Gilmore had been friends and boon companions,\nbut of late North had rather avoided this neighbor of his.\n\nMount Hope said that North had parted with the major portion of his\nsmall fortune to Gilmore. Mount Hope also said and believed, and with\nmost excellent justification for so doing, that North was a fool--a\ntruth he had told himself so many times within the last month that it\nhad become the utter weariness of iteration.\n\nHe was a muscular young fellow of twenty-six, with a handsome face, and,\nwhen he chose, a kindly charming manner. He had been--and he was fully\naware of this--as idle and as worthless as any young fellow could\npossibly be; he was even aware that the worst Mount Hope said of him was\nmuch better than he deserved. In those hours that were such a new\nexperience to him, when he denied himself other companionship than his\nown accusing conscience; when the contemplation of the naked shape of\nhis folly absorbed him to the exclusion of all else, he would sit before\nhis fire with the poker clutched in his hands and his elbows resting on\nhis knees, poking between the bars of the grate, poking moodily, while\nunder his breath he cursed the weakness that had made him what he was.\n\nWith his hair in disorder on his handsome shapely head, he would sit\nthus hours together, not wholly insensible to a certain grim sense of\nhumor, since in all his schemes of life he had made no provision for the\nvery thing that had happened. He wondered mightily what a fellow could\ndo with his last thousand dollars, especially when a fellow chanced to\nbe in love and meditated nothing less than marriage; for North's\nday-dream, coming like the sun through a rift in the clouds to light up\nthe somberness of his solitary musings, was all of love and Elizabeth\nHerbert. He wondered what she had heard of him--little that was good, he\ntold himself, and probably much that was to his discredit. Yet as he sat\nthere he was slowly shaping plans for the future. One point was clear:\nhe must leave Mount Hope, where he had run his course, where he was\ninvolved and committed in ways he could not bear to think of. To go\nmeant that he would be forsaking much that was evil; a situation from\nwhich he could not extricate himself otherwise. It also meant that he\nwould be leaving Elizabeth Herbert; but perhaps she had not even guessed\nhis secret, for he had not spoken of love; or perhaps having divined it,\nshe cared nothing for him. Even so, his regeneration seemed in itself a\nthing worth while. What he was to do, how make a place for himself, he\nhad scarcely considered; but his inheritance was wasted, and of the\ncomfortable thousands that had come to him, next to nothing remained.\n\nIn the intervals between his musings Mr. North got together such of his\npersonal belongings as he deemed worth the removal; he was surprised to\nfind how few were the things he really valued. On the grounds of a\nchastened taste in such matters he threw aside most of his clothes; he\ntold himself that he did not care to be judged by such mere externals as\nthe shade of a tie or the color of a pair of hose. Under his hands--for\nthe spirit of reform was strong upon him--his rooms took on a sober\nappearance. He amused himself by making sundry penitential offerings to\nthe flames; numerous evidences of his unrighteous bachelorhood\ndisappearing from walls and book-shelves. Coincident with this he owned\nto a feeling of intense satisfaction. What remained he would have his\nfriend Marshall Langham sell after he was gone, his finances having\nsuddenly become of paramount importance.\n\nBut the days passed, and though he was not able to bring himself to\nleave Mount Hope, his purpose in its final aspect underwent no change.\nHe lived to himself, and his old haunts and his old friends saw nothing\nof him. Evelyn Langham, whom he had known before she married his friend\nMarshall, was fortunately absent from town. Her letters to him remained\nunanswered; the last one he had burned unread. He was sick of the\ndevious crooked paths he had trodden; he might not be just the stuff of\nwhich saints are made, but there was the hope in his heart of better\nthings than he had yet known.\n\nAt about the time Mr. Shrimplin was attacking his Thanksgiving turkey,\nNorth, from his window, watched the leaden clouds that overhung the\nhousetops. From the frozen dirt of the unpaved streets the keen wind\nwhipped up scanty dust clouds, mingling them with sudden flurries of\nfine snow. Save for the passing of an occasional pedestrian who breasted\nthe gale with lowered head, the Square was deserted. Staring down on it,\nNorth drummed idly on the window-pane. What an unspeakable fool he had\nbeen, and what a price his folly was costing him! As he stood there,\nheavy-hearted and bitter in spirit, he saw Marshall Langham crossing the\nSquare in the direction of his office. He watched his friend's\nwind-driven progress for a moment, then slipped into his overcoat and,\nsnatching up his hat, hurried from the room.\n\nLangham, with Moxlow, his law partner, occupied two handsomely furnished\nrooms on the first floor, of the one building in Mount Hope that was\ndistinctly an office building, since its sky-scraping five stories were\nreached by an elevator. Here North found Langham--a man only three or\nfour years older than himself, tall, broad-shouldered, with an\noratorical air of distinction and a manner that proclaimed him the\nleading young lawyer at the local bar.\n\nHe greeted North cordially, and the latter observed that his friend's\nface was unusually flushed, and that beads of perspiration glistened on\nhis forehead, which he frequently wiped with a large linen handkerchief.\n\n\"What have you been doing with yourself, Jack?\" he demanded, sliding his\nchair back from the desk at which he was seated. \"I haven't had a\nglimpse of you in days.\"\n\n\"I have been keeping rather quiet.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? Liver out of whack?\" Langham smiled complacently.\n\n\"Worse than that!\" North rejoined moodily.\n\n\"That's saying a good deal? What is it, Jack?\"\n\nBut North was not inclined to lay bare his heart; he doubted if Langham\ncould be made to comprehend any part of his suffering.\n\n\"I am getting down to my last dollar, Marsh. I don't know where the\nmoney went, but it's gone,\" he finally said.\n\nLangham nodded.\n\n\"You have certainly had your little time, Jack, and it's been a\nperfectly good little time, too! What are you going to do when you are\ncleaned out?\"\n\n\"That's part of the puzzle, Marsh, that's the very hell and all of it.\"\n\n\"Well, you have had your fun--lots of it!\" said Langham, swabbing his\nface.\n\nNorth noticed the embroidered initial in the corner of the handkerchief.\n\n\"Fun! Was it fun?\" he demanded with sudden heat.\n\n\"You took it for fun. Personally I think it was a pretty fair\nimitation.\"\n\n\"Yes, I took it for fun, or mistook it; that's the pity of it! I can\nforgive myself for almost everything but having been a fool!\"\n\n\"That's always a hard dose to swallow,\" agreed Langham. He was willing\nto enter into his friend's mood.\n\n\"Have you ever tried to swallow it?\" asked North.\n\n\"I can't say I have. Some of us haven't any business with a\nconscience--our blood's too red. I've made up my mind that, while I may\nbe a man of moral impulses I am also a creature of purest accident. It's\nthe same with you, Jack. You are a pretty decent fellow down under the\nskin; there's still the divine spark in you, though perhaps it doesn't\nburn bright enough to warm the premises. But it's there, like a shaft of\nlight from a gem, a gem in the rough--though I believe I'm mixing my\nmetaphors.\"\n\n\"Why don't you say a pearl in the mire?\"\n\n\"But that doesn't really take from your pearlship, though it may dim\nyour luster. No, Jack, the accidents have been to your morals instead of\nyour arms and legs. That's how I explain it in my own case, and it's\nsaved me many a bad quarter of an hour with myself. I know I'd be on\ncrutches if the vicissitudes of which I have been the victim could be\ngiven physical expression.\"\n\n\"Marsh,\" said North soberly, \"I am going away.\"\n\n\"You are going to do what, Jack?\" demanded the lawyer.\n\n\"I am going to leave Mount Hope. I am going West for a bit, and after I\nam gone I want you to sell the stuff in my rooms for me; have an auction\nand get rid of every stick of the fool truck!\"\n\n\"Why, what's wrong? Going away--when?\"\n\n\"At once, to-morrow--to-night maybe. I don't know quite when, but very\nsoon. I want you to get rid of all my stuff, do you understand? Before\nlong I'll write you my address and you can send me whatever it brings. I\nexpect I'll need the money--\"\n\n\"Why, you're crazy, man!\" cried Langham.\n\nNorth moved impatiently. He had not come to discuss the merit of his\nplans.\n\n\"On the contrary I am having my first gleam of reason,\" he said briefly.\n\n\"Of course you know best, Jack,\" acquiesced Langham after a moment's\nsilence.\n\n\"You'll do what I ask of you, Marsh?\"\n\n\"Oh, hang it, yes.\" He hesitated for an instant and then said 'frankly.\n\"You know I'm rather in your debt; I don't suppose five hundred dollars\nwould square what I have had from you first and last.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't mention it! Whenever it is quite convenient, that will\nbe soon enough.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Jack!\" said Langham gratefully. \"The fact is the pickings\nhere are pretty small.\"\n\nAgain the lawyer mopped his brow and again North moved impatiently.\n\n\"Don't say another word about it, Marsh,\" he repeated. \"McBride has\nagreed to take the last of my gas bonds off my hands; that will get me\naway from here.\"\n\n\"How many have you left?\" asked Langham curiously.\n\n\"Ten,\" said North.\n\nLangham whistled.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me you are down to that? Why, you told me once you\nheld a hundred!\"\n\n\"So I did once, but it costs money to be the kind of fool I've been!\nsaid North.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you are doing the sensible thing in getting out of\nthis. Have you any notion where you are going or what you'll do?\"\n\nNorth shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, you'll get into something!\" the lawyer encouraged. \"When shall you\nsee McBride?\"\n\n\"This afternoon. Why?\"\n\n\"I was going to say that I was just there with Atkinson. He and McBride\nhave been in a timber speculation, and Atkinson handed over three\nthousand dollars in cash to the old man. I suppose he has banked it in\nsome heap of scrap-iron on the premises!\" said Langham laughing.\n\n\"I think I shall go there now,\" resolved North. While he was speaking he\nhad moved to the door leading into the hail, and had opened it.\n\n\"Hold on, John!\" said Langham, detaining him. \"Evelyn is home. She came\nquite unexpectedly to-day; you won't leave town without getting up to\nthe house to see her?\"\n\n\"I think I shall,\" replied North hastily. \"I much prefer not to say\ngood-by.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" cried Langham.\n\n\"No, Marsh, I don't intend to say good-by to any one!\" North quietly\nturned back into the room.\n\n\"I had intended having you up to the house to-night for a blow-out,\"\nurged Langham, but North shook his head. \"You and Gilmore, Jack; and by\nthe way, this puts me in a nice hole! I have already asked Gilmore, and\nhe's coming. Now, how the devil am to get out of it? I can't spring him\nalone on the family circle, and I don't want to hurt his feelings!\"\n\n\"Call it off, Marsh; say I couldn't come; that's a good enough excuse to\ngive Gilmore. Why, that fellow's a common card-sharp, you can't ask\nEvelyn to meet him!\"\n\nA slight noise in the hall caused both men to glance toward the door,\nwhere they saw just beyond the threshold the swarthy-faced Gilmore.\n\nThere was a brief embarrassed silence, and then North nodded to the\nnew-comer, but the salutation was not returned.\n\n\"Well, good-by, Marsh!\" he said, and turned to the door. As he brushed\npast the gambler their eyes met for an instant, and in that instant\nGilmore's face turned livid with rage.\n\n\"I'll fix you for that, so help me God, I will!\" he said, but North made\nno answer. He passed down the hall, down the stairs, and out into the\nstreet.\n\nMcBride's was directly opposite on the corner of High Street and the\nSquare; a mean two-story structure of frame, across the shabby front of\nwhich hung a shabby creaking sign bearing witness that within might be\nfound: \"Archibald McBride, Hardware and Cutlery, Implements and Bar\nIron.\" McBride had kept store on that corner time out of mind.\n\nHe was an austere unapproachable old man, having no relatives of whom\nany one knew; with few friends and fewer intimates; a rich man,\naccording to the Mount Hope standard, and a miser according to the Mount\nHope gossip, with the miser's traditional suspicion of banks. It was\nrumored that he had hidden away vast sums of money in his dingy store,\nor in the closely-shuttered rooms above, where the odds and ends of the\nmerchandise in which he dealt had accumulated in rusty and neglected\nheaps.\n\nThe old man wore an air of mystery, and this air of mystery extended to\nhis place of business. It was dark and dirty and ill-kept. On the\nbrightest summer day the sunlight stole vaguely in through grimy\ncobwebbed windows. The dust of years had settled deep on unused shelves\nand, in abandoned corners, and whole days were said to pass when no one\nbut the ancient merchant himself entered the building. Yet in spite of\nthe trade that had gone elsewhere he had grown steadily richer year by\nyear.\n\nWhen North entered the store he found McBride busy with his books in his\nsmall back office, a lean black cat asleep on the desk at his elbow.\n\n\"Good afternoon, John!\" said the old merchant as he turned from his high\ndesk, removing as he did so a pair of heavy steel-rimmed spectacles,\nthat dominated a high-bridged nose which in turn dominated a wrinkled\nand angular face.\n\n\"I thought I should find you here!\" said North.\n\n\"You'll always find me here of a week-day,\" and he gave the young fellow\nthe fleeting suggestion of a smile. He had a liking for North, whose\nfather, years before, had been one of the few friends he had made in\nMount Hope.\n\nThe Norths had been among the town's earliest settlers, John's\ngrandfather having taken his place among the pioneers when Mount Hope\nhad little but its name to warrant its place on the map. At his death\nStephen, his only son, assumed the family headship, married, toiled,\nthrived and finished his course following his wife to the old\nburying-ground after a few lonely heart-breaking months, and leaving\nJohn without kin, near or far, but with a good name and fair riches.\n\n\"I have brought you those gas bonds, Mr. McBride,\" said North, going at\nonce to the purpose of his visit.\n\nThe old merchant nodded understandingly.\n\n\"I hope you can arrange to let me have the money for them to-day,\"\ncontinued North.\n\n\"I think I can manage it, John. Atkinson and Judge Langham's boy, Marsh,\nwere just here and left a bit of cash. Maybe I can make up the sum.\"\nWhile he was speaking, he had gone to the safe which stood open in one\ncorner of the small office.\n\nIn a moment he returned to the desk with a roll of bills in his hands\nwhich he counted lovingly, placing them, one by one, in a neat pile\nbefore him.\n\n\"You're still in the humor to go away?\" he asked, when he had finished\ncounting the money.\n\n\"Never more so!\" said North briefly.\n\n\"What do you think of young Langham, John? Will he ever be as sharp a\nlawyer as the judge?\"\n\n\"He's counted very brilliant,\" evaded North.\n\nHe rather dreaded the old merchant when his love of gossip got the\nbetter of his usual reserve.\n\n\"I hadn't seen the fellow in months to speak to until to-day. He's a\nclever talker and has a taking way with him, but if the half I hear is\ntrue, he's going the devil's own gait. He's a pretty good friend to Andy\nGilmore, ain't he--that horse-racing, card-playing neighbor of yours?\"\nHe pushed the bills toward North. \"Run them over, John, and see if I\nhave made any mistake.\" He slipped off his glasses again and fell to\npolishing them with his handkerchief. \"It's all right, John?\" he asked\nat length.\n\n\"Yes, quite right, thank you.\" And North produced the bonds from an\ninner pocket of his coat and handed them to McBride.\n\n\"So you are going to get out of this place, John? You're going West, you\nsay. What will you do there?\" asked the old merchant as he carefully\nexamined the bonds.\n\n\"I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"I'm trusting you're through with your folly, John; that your crop of\nwild oats is in the ground. You've made a grand sowing!\"\n\n\"I have,\" answered North, laughing in spite of himself.\n\n\"You'll be empty-handed I'm thinking, but for the money you take from\nhere.\"'\n\n\"Very nearly so.\"\n\n\"How much have you gone through with, John, do you mind rightly?\"\n\n\"Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"A nice bit of money!\" He shook his head and chuckled dryly. \"It's\nenough to make your father turn in his grave. He's said to me many a\ntime when he was a bit close in his dealings with me, 'I'm, saving for\nmy boy, Archie.' Eh? But it ain't always three generations from\nshirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves; you've made a short cut of it! But\nyou're going to do the wise thing, John; you've been a fool here, now go\naway and be a man! Let all devilishness alone and work hard; that's the\nantidote for idleness, and it's overmuch of idleness that's been your\nruin.\"\n\n\"I imagine it is,\" said North cheerfully.\n\n\"You'll be making a clever man out of yourself, John,\" McBride continued\ngraciously. \"Not a flash in the pan like your friend Marshall Langham\nyonder. It's drink will do for him the same as it did for his\ngrandfather, it's in the blood; but that was before your time.\"\n\n\"I've heard of him; a remarkably able lawyer, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Pooh! You'll hear a plenty of nonsense talked, and by very sensible\npeople, too, about most drunken fools! He was a spender and a\nprofligate, was old Marshall Langham; a tavern loafer, but a man of\nparts. Yes, he had a bit of a brain, when he was sober and of a mind to\nuse it.\"\n\nOne would scarcely have supposed that Archibald McBride, silent,\ntaciturn, money-loving, possessed the taste for scandal that North knew\nhe did possess. The old merchant continued garrulously.\n\n\"They are a bad lot, John, those Langhams, but it took the smartest one\nof the whole tribe to get the better of me. I never told you that\nbefore, did I? It was old Marshall himself, and he flattered me into\nloaning him a matter of a hundred dollars once; I guess I have his note\nsomewhere yet. But I swore then I'd have no more dealings with any of\nthem, and I'm likely to keep my word as long as I keep my senses. It's\nthe little things that prick the skin; that make a man bitter. I suppose\nthe judge's boy has had his hand in your pocket? He looks like a man\nwho'd be free enough with another's purse.\"\n\nBut North shook his head.\n\n\"No, no, I have only myself to blame,\" he said.\n\n\"What do you hear of his wife? How's the marriage turning out?\" and he\nshot the young fellow a shrewd questioning glance.\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" replied North, coloring slightly.\n\n\"She'll hardly be publishing to the world that she's married a drunken\nprofligate--\"\n\nThis did not seem to North to call for an answer, and he attempted none.\nHe turned and moved toward the front of the store, followed by the old\nmerchant. At the door he paused.\n\n\"Thank you for your kindness, Mr. McBride!\"\n\n\"It was no kindness, just a matter of business\" said McBride hastily.\n\"I'm no philanthropist, John, but just a plain man of business who'll\ndrive a close bargain if he can.\"\n\n\"At any rate, I'm going to thank you,\" insisted North, smiling\npleasantly. \"Good-by,\" and he extended his hand, which the old merchant\ntook.\n\n\"Good-by, and good luck to you, John, and you might drop me a line now\nand then just to say how you get on.\"\n\n\"I will. Good-by!\"\n\n\"I know you'll succeed, John. A bit of application, a bit of necessity\nto spur you on, and we'll be proud of you yet!\"\n\nNorth laughed as he opened the door and stepped out; and Archibald\nMcBride, looking through his dingy show-windows, watched him until he\ndisappeared down the street; then he turned and re\u00c3\u00abntered his office.\n\nMeanwhile North hurried away with the remnant of his little fortune in\nhis pocket. Five minutes' walk brought him to the building that had\nsheltered him for the last few years. He climbed the stairs and entered\nthe long hail above. He paused, key in hand, before his door, when he\nheard behind him a light footfall on the uncarpeted floor and the swish\nof a woman's skirts. As he turned abruptly, the woman who had evidently\nfollowed him up from the street, came swiftly down the hall toward him.\n\n\"Jack!\" she said, when she was quite near.\n\nThe short winter's day had brought an early twilight to the place, and\nthe woman was closely veiled, but the moment she spoke North recognized\nher, for there was something in the mellow full-throated quality of her\nspeech which belonged only to one voice that he knew.\n\n\"Mrs. Langham!--Evelyn!\" he exclaimed, starting back in dismay.\n\n\"Hush, Jack, you needn't call it from the housetops!\" As she spoke she\nswept aside her veil and he saw her face, a superlatively pretty face\nwith scarlet smiling lips and dark luminous eyes that were smiling, too.\n\n\"Do you want to see me, Evelyn?\" he asked awkwardly.\n\nBut she was neither awkward nor embarrassed; she was still smiling up\ninto his face with reckless eyes and brilliant lips. She pointed to the\ndoor with her small gloved hand.\n\n\"Open it, Jack!\" she commanded.\n\nFor a moment he hesitated. She was the one person he did not wish to\nsee, least of all did he wish to see her there. She was not nicely\ndiscreet, as he well knew. She did many things that were not wise, that\nwere, indeed, frankly imprudent. But clearly they could not stand there\nin the hallway. Gilmore or some of Gilmore's friends might come up the\nstairs at any moment. Langham himself might be of these.\n\nSomething of all this passed through North's mind as he stood there\nhesitating. Then he unlocked the door, and standing aside, motioned her\nto precede him into the room.\n\nThis room, the largest of several, he occupied, was his parlor. On\nentering it he closed the door after him, and drew forward a chair for\nEvelyn, but he did not himself sit down, nor did he remove his overcoat.\n\nHe had known Evelyn all his life, they had played together as children;\nmore than this, though now he would have been quite willing to forget\nthe whole episode and even more than willing that she should forget it,\nthere had been a time when he had moped in wretched melancholy because\nof what he had then considered her utter fickleness. Shortly after this\nhe had been sent East to college and had borne the separation with a\nfortitude that had rather surprised him when he recalled how bitter a\nthing her heartlessness had seemed.\n\nWhen they met again he had found her more alluring than ever, but more\ndevoted to her pleasures also; and then Marshall Langham had come into\nher life. North had divined that the course of their love-making was far\nfrom smooth, for Langham's temper was high and his will arbitrary, nor\nwas he one to bear meekly the crosses she laid on him, crosses which\nother men had borne in smiling uncomplaint, reasoning no doubt, that it\nwas unwise to take her favors too seriously; that as they were easily\nachieved they were quite as easily forfeited. But Langham was not like\nthe other men with whom she had amused herself. He was not only older\nand more brilliant, but was giving every indication that his\nprofessional success would be solid and substantial. Evelyn's father had\nchampioned his cause, and in the end she had married him.\n\nIn the five years that had elapsed since then, her romance had taken its\nplace with the accepted things of life, and she revenged herself on\nLangham, for what she had come to consider his unreasonable exactions,\nby her recklessness, by her thirst for pleasure, and above all by her\nextravagance.\n\nThrough all the vicissitudes of her married life, the smallest part of\nwhich he only guessed, North had seen much of Evelyn. There was a daring\ndangerous recklessness in her mood that he had sensed and understood and\nto which he had made quick response. He knew that she was none too happy\nwith Langham, and although he had been conscious of no wish to wrong the\nhusband he had never paused to consider the outcome of his intimacy with\nthe wife.\n\nEvelyn was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"You wonder why I came here, don't you, Jack?\" she said.\n\n\"You should never have done it!\" he replied quickly.\n\n\"What about my letters, why didn't you answer them?\" she demanded. \"I\nhadn't one word from you in weeks. It quite spoiled my trip East. What\nwas I to think? And then you sent me just a line saying you were leaving\nMount Hope--\" she drew in her breath sharply. There was a brief silence.\n\"Why?\" she asked at length.\n\n\"It is better that I should,\" he answered awkwardly.\n\nHe felt a sudden remorseful tenderness for her; he wished that she might\nhave divined the change that had come over him; even how worthless a\nthing his devotion had been, the utter selfishness of it.\n\n\"Why is it better?\" she asked. He was near enough for her to put out a\nsmall hand and rest it on his arm. \"Jack, have I done anything to make\nyou hate me? Don't you care any longer for me?\"\n\n\"I care a great deal, Evelyn. I want you to think the best of me.\"\n\n\"But why do you go? And when do you think of going, Jack?\" The hand that\nshe had rested there a moment before, left his arm and dropped at her\nside.\n\n\"I don't know yet, my plans are very uncertain. I am quite at the end of\nmy money. I have been a good deal of a fool, Evelyn.\"\n\nSomething in his manner restrained her, she was not so sure as she had\nbeen of her hold on him. She looked up appealingly into his face, the\nsmile had left her lips and her eyes were sad, but he mistrusted the\ngenuineness of this swift change of mood, certainly its permanence.\n\n\"What will there be left for me, Jack, when you go? I thought--I\nthought--\" her full lips quivered.\n\nShe was realizing that this separation which her imagination had already\ninvested with a tragic significance, meant much less to him than she\nbelieved it would mean to her; more than this, the cruel suspicion was\ncertifying itself that in her absence from Mount Hope, North had\nundergone some strange transformation; was no longer the reckless,\ndissipated, young fellow who for months had been as her very shadow.\n\n\"I am going to-night, Evelyn,\" he said with sudden determination.\n\nShe gave a half smothered cry.\n\n\"To-night! To-night!\" she repeated.\n\nHe changed his position uncomfortably.\n\n\"I am at the end of my string, Evelyn,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"I--I shall miss you dreadfully, Jack! You know I am frightfully\nunhappy; what will it be when you go? Marsh has made a perfect wreck of\nmy life!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Evelyn!\" he replied bruskly. \"You must be careful what you\nsay to me!\"\n\n\"I haven't been careful before!\" she asserted.\n\nHe bit his lips. She went swiftly on.\n\n\"I have told you everything! I don't care what happens to me--you know I\ndon't, Jack! I am deadly desperately tired!\" She paused, then she cried\nvehemently. \"One endures a situation as long as one can, but there comes\na time when it is impossible to go on with the falsehood any longer, and\nI have reached that time! It is my life, my happiness that are at\nstake!\"\n\n\"Sometimes it is better to do without happiness,\" he philosophized.\n\n\"That is silly, Jack, no one believes that sort of thing any more; but\nit is good to teach to women and children, it saves a lot of bother, I\nsuppose. But men take their happiness regardless of the rights of\nothers!\"\n\n\"Not always,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, always!\" she insisted.\n\n\"But you knew what Marsh was before you married him.\"\n\n\"It's a woman's vanity to believe she can reform, can control a man.\"\nShe glanced at him furtively. What had happened to change him? Always\nuntil now he had responded to the recklessness of her mood, he had\nseemed to understand her without the need of words. Her brows met in an\nangry frown. Was he a coward? Did he fear Marshall Langham? Once more\nshe rested her hand on his arm. \"Jack, dear Jack, are _you_ going to\nfail me, too?\"\n\n\"What would you have me say or do, Evelyn?\" he demanded impatiently.\n\nShe regarded him sadly.\n\n\"What has made you change, Jack? What is it; what have I done? Why did\nyou not answer my letters? Why did you not come to see me?\"\n\n\"I only learned that you were in town this afternoon,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, but you had no intention of coming, I know you hadn't! You would\nhave left Mount Hope without even a good-by to me!\"\n\n\"It is hard enough to have to go, Evelyn!\"\n\n\"It isn't that, Jack. What have I done? How have I displeased you?\"\n\n\"You haven't displeased me, Evelyn,\" he faltered.\n\n\"Then why have you treated me as you have?\"\n\n\"I thought it would be easier,\" he said.\n\n\"Have you forgotten what friends we were once?\" she asked softly. \"You\nalways helped me out of my difficulties then, and you told me once that\nyou cared--a great deal for me, more than you should ever care for any\nwoman!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered shortly, and was silent.\n\nHe would scarcely have admitted to himself how foolish his early passion\nhad been, for it was at least sincere and there could have been no\nsacrifice, at one time, that he would not have willingly made for her\nsake. His later sentiment for her had been a disgracing and a\ndisgraceful thing, and he was glad to think of this boyish love, since\nit carried him back to a time before he had wrought only misery for\nhimself. She misunderstood his reticence, she could not realize that she\nhad lost the power that had once been hers.\n\n\"What a mistake I made, Jack!\" she cried, and stretched out her hands\ntoward him.\n\nHe fell back a step.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. He glanced sharply at her.\n\n\"How stupid you are!\" she exclaimed.\n\nShe half rose from her chair with her hands still extended toward him.\nFor a moment he met her glance, and then, disgusted and ashamed,\nwithdrew his eyes from hers.\n\nEvelyn sank back in her chair, and her face turned white and she covered\nit with her hands. North was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"We would both of us better forget this,\" he said quietly.\n\nShe rose and stood at his side. The color had returned to her cheeks.\n\n\"What a fool you are, John North!\" she jeered softly. \"And I might have\nmade the tragic mistake of really caring for you!\" She gave a little\nshiver of dismay, and then after a moment's tense silence: \"What a boy\nyou are,--almost as much of a boy as when we used to play together.\"\n\n\"I think there is nothing more to say, Evelyn,\" North said shortly. \"It\nis growing late. You must not be seen leaving here!\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Oh, it would take a great deal to compromise me; though if Marsh ever\nfinds out that I have been here he'll be ready to kill me!\" But she\nstill lingered, still seemed to invite.\n\nNorth was silent.\n\n\"You must be in love, Jack! You see, I'll not grant that you are the\nsaint you'd have me think you! Yes, you are in love!\" for he colored\nangrily at her words. \"Is it--\"\n\nHe interrupted her harshly.\n\n\"Don't speak her name!\"\n\n\"Then it is true! I'd heard that you were, but I did not believe it!\nYes, you are right, we must forget that I came here to-day.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking she had moved toward the door, and instinctively\nhe had stepped past her to open it. When he turned with his hand on the\nknob, it brought them again face to face. The smile had left her lips,\nthey were mere delicate lines of color. She raised herself on tiptoe and\nher face, gray-white, was very close to his.\n\n\"What a fool you are, Jack, what a coward you must be!\" and she struck\nhim on the cheek with her gloved hand. \"You _are_ a coward!\" she cried.\n\nHis face grew as white as her own, and he did not trust himself to\nspeak. She gave him a last contemptuous glance and drew her veil.\n\n\"Now open the door,\" she said insolently.\n\nHe did so, and she brushed past him swiftly and stepped out into the\nlong hall. For a moment North stood staring after her, and then he\nclosed the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nSTRANGE BEDFELLOWS\n\n\nWhen North quitted Marshall Langham's office, Gilmore, after a brief\ninstant of irresolution, stepped into the room. He was crudely,\nhandsome, a powerfully-built man of about Langham's own age,\nswarthy-faced and with ruthless lips showing red under a black waxed\nmustache. His hat was inclined at a \"sporty\" angle and the cigar which\nhe held firmly between his strong even teeth was tilted in the same\ndirection, imparting a rakish touch to Mr. Gilmore's otherwise sturdy\nand aggressive presence.\n\n\"Howdy, Marsh!\" said his new-comer easily.\n\nFrom his seat before his desk Langham scowled across at him.\n\n\"What the devil brings you here, Andy?\" he asked, ungraciously enough.\n\nGilmore buried his hands deep in his trousers pockets and with one eye\nhalf closed surveyed the lawyer over the tip of his tilted cigar.\n\n\"You're a civil cuss, Marsh,\" he said lightly, \"but one wouldn't always\nknow it. Ain't I a client, ain't I a friend,--and damn it all, man,\nain't I a creditor? There are three excuses, any one of which is:\nsufficient to bring me into your esteemed presence!\"\n\n\"We may as well omit the first,\" growled Langham, wheeling his chair\nback from the desk and facing Gilmore.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Gilmore, lazily tolerant of the other's mood.\n\n\"Because there is nothing more that I can do for you,\" said Langham\nshortly.\n\n\"Oh, yes there is, Marsh, there's a whole lot more you can do for me.\nThere's Moxlow, the distinguished prosecuting attorney; without you to\ntalk sense to him he's liable to listen to all sorts of queer people who\ntake more interest in my affairs than is good for them; but as long as\nhe's got you at his elbow he won't forget my little stake in his\nelection.\"\n\n\"If you wish him not to forget it, you'd better not be so particular in\nreminding him of it; he'll get sick of you and your concerns!\" retorted\nLangham.\n\nGilmore laughed.\n\n\"I ain't going to remind him of it; what have I got you for, Marsh? It's\nyour job.\" He took a step nearer Langham while his black brows met in a\nsullen frown. \"I know I ain't popular here in Mount Hope, I know there\nare plenty of people who'd like to see me run out of town; but I'm no\nquitter, they'll find. It suits me to stay here, and they can't touch me\nif Moxlow won't have it. That's your job, that's what I hire you for,\nMarsh; you're Moxlow's partner, you're your father's son, it's up to\nyou to see I ain't interfered with. Don't tell me you can't do anything\nmore for me. I won't have it!\"\n\nLangham's face was red, and his eyes blazed angrily, but Gilmore met his\nglance with a look of stern insistence that could not be misunderstood.\n\n\"I have done what I could for you,\" the lawyer said at last, choking\ndown his rage.\n\n\"Oh, go to hell! You know you haven't hurt yourself,\" said Gilmore\ninsolently.\n\n\"Well, then, why do you come here?\" demanded Langham.\n\n\"Same old business, Marsh.\" He lounged across the room and dropped,\nyawning, into a chair near the window.\n\nThere was silence between them for a little space. Langham fussed with\nthe papers on his desk, while Gilmore squinted at him over the end of\nhis cigar.\n\n\"Same old business, Marsh!\" Gilmore repeated lazily. \"What's the enemy\nup to, anyhow? Are the good people of Mount Hope worrying Moxlow? Is\ntheir sleepless activity going to interfere with my sleepless\nprofession, eh? Can you answer me that?\"\n\n\"Moxlow has cut the office of late,\" said Langham briefly.\n\n\"He's happened on a good thing in the prosecuting attorney's office, I\nsuppose? It's a pity you didn't strike out for that, Marsh; you'd have\nbeen of some use to your friends if you'd got the job.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Langham.\n\n\"Well, when's Moxlow going after me?\" inquired Gilmore.\n\n\"I, haven't heard him say. He told me he had sufficient evidence for\nyour indictment.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" agreed Gilmore placidly.\n\n\"I guess yours is a case for the next grand jury!\"\n\n\"So Moxlow's in earnest about wishing to make trouble for me?\" said\nGilmore, still placidly.\n\n\"Oh, he's in earnest, all right.\" Langham shrugged his shoulders\npetulantly. \"He'll go after you, and perhaps by the time he's done with\nyou you'll wish you'd taken my advice and made yourself scarce!\"\n\n\"I'm no quitter!\" rejoined Gilmore, chewing thoughtfully at the end of\nhis cigar.\n\n\"By all means stay in Mount Hope if you think it's worth your while,\"\nsaid Langham indifferently.\n\n\"Can you give me some definite idea as to when the fun begins?\"\n\n\"No, but it will be soon enough, Andy. He wants the support of the best\nelement. He can't afford to offend it.\"\n\n\"And he knows you are my lawyer?\" asked Gilmore still thoughtfully.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Ain't that going to cut any figure with him?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Is that so, Marsh?\" He crossed his legs and nursed an ankle with both\nhands. \"Well, somebody ought to lose Moxlow,--take him out and forget to\nfind him again. He's much too good for this world; it ain't natural.\nHe's about the only man of his age in Mount Hope who ain't drifted into\nmy rooms at one time or another.\" He paused and took the cigar from\nbetween his teeth. \"You call him off, Marsh, make him agree to let me\nalone; ain't there such a thing as friendship in this profession of\nyours?\"\n\nLangham shook his head, and again Gilmore's black brows met in a frown.\nHe made a contemptuous gesture.\n\n\"You're a hell of a lawyer!\" he sneered.\n\n\"Be careful what you say to me!\" cried Langham, suddenly giving way to\nthe feeling of rage that until now he had held in check.\n\n\"Oh, I'm careful enough. I guess if you stop to think a minute you'll\nunderstand you got to take what I choose to say as I choose to say it!\"\n\nLangham sprang to his feet shaking with anger.\n\n\"No, by--\" he began hoarsely.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Gilmore coldly. \"You can't afford to row with me;\nanyhow, I ain't going to row with you. I'll tell you what I think of you\nand what I expect of you, so sit down!\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Gilmore gazed out the window. He seemed to watch\nthe hurrying snowflakes with no interest in Langham who was still\nstanding by his desk, with one shaking hand resting on the back of his\nchair. Presently the lawyer resumed his seat and Gilmore turned toward\nhim.\n\n\"Don't talk about my quitting here, Marsh,\" he said menacingly. \"That's\nthe kind of legal advice I won't have from you or any one else.\"\n\n\"You may as well make up your mind first as last to it,\" said Langham,\nnot regarding what Gilmore had just said. \"I can't keep Moxlow quiet any\nlonger; the sentiment of the community is against gamblers. If you are\nnot a gambler, what are you?\"\n\n\"You mean you are going to throw me over, you two?\"\n\n\"With Moxlow it is a case of bread and butter; personally I don't care\nwhom you fleece, but I've got my living to make here in Mount Hope, too,\nand I can't afford to go counter to public opinion.\"\n\n\"You have had some favors out of me, Marsh.\"\n\n\"I am not likely to forget them, you give me no chance,\" rejoined\nLangham bitterly.\n\n\"Why should I, eh?\" asked Gilmore coolly. He leaned back in his chair\nand stared at the ceiling above his head. \"Marsh, what was that North\nwas saying about me when I came down the hall?\" and his swarthy cheeks\nwere tinged with red.\n\n\"I don't recall that he was speaking of you.\"\n\n\"You don't? Well, think again. It was about our going up to your house\nto-night, wasn't it? Your wife's back, eh? Well, don't worry, I came\nhere partly to tell you that I had made other arrangements for the\nevening.\"\n\n\"It's just as well,\" said Langham.\n\n\"Do you mean your wife wouldn't receive me?\" demanded Gilmore. There\nwas a catch in his voice and a pallor in his face.\n\n\"I didn't say that.\"\n\nGilmore's chair resounded noisily on the floor as he came to his feet.\nHe strode to the lawyer's side.\n\n\"Then what in hell _do_ you say?\" he stormed.\n\nIn spite of himself Langham quailed before the gambler's fury.\n\n\"Oh, keep still, Andy! What a nasty-tempered beast you are!\" he said\npacifically.\n\nThere was a pause, and Gilmore resumed his chair, turning to the window\nto hide his emotion; then slowly his scowling glance came back to\nLangham.\n\n\"He said I was a common card-sharp, eh?\" Langham knew that he spoke of\nNorth. \"Damn him! What does he call himself?\" He threw the stub of his\ncigar from him across the room. \"Marsh, what does your wife know about\nme?\" And again there was the catch to his voice.\n\nLangham looked at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Know about you--my wife--nothing,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"I suppose she's heard my name?\" inquired the gambler.\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"Thinks I rob you at cards, eh?\" But Langham made no answer to this.\n\"Thinks I take your money away from you,\" continued the gambler. \"And\nit's your game to let her think that! I wonder what she'd think if she\nknew the account stood the other way about? I've been a handy sort of a\nfriend, haven't I, Marsh? The sort you could use,--and you have used me\nup to the limit! I've been good enough to borrow money from, but not\ngood enough to take home--\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Andy, what's the use,\" placated Langham. \"I'm sorry if your\nfeelings are hurt.\"\n\n\"It's time you and I had a settlement, Marsh. I want you to take up\nthose notes of yours.\"\n\n\"I haven't the money!\" said Langham.\n\n\"Well, I can't wait on you any longer.\"\n\n\"I don't see but that you'll have to,\" retorted Langham.\n\n\"I'm going to offer a few inducements for haste, Marsh. I'm going to\nmake you see that it's worth your while to find that money for me\nquick,--understand? You owe me about two thousand dollars; are you fixed\nto turn it in by the end of the month?\"\n\nThe gambler bit off the end of a fresh cigar and held it a moment\nbetween his fingers as he gazed at Langham, waiting for his reply. The\nlatter shook his head but said nothing.\n\n\"Well, then, by George, I am going to sue you!\"\n\n\"Because I can't protect you longer!\"\n\n\"Oh, to hell with your protection! Go dig up the money for me or I'll\nraise a fuss here that'll hurt more than one reputation! The notes are\ngood, ain't they?\"\n\n\"They are good when I have the money to meet them.\"\n\n\"They are good even if you haven't the money to meet them! I guess Judge\nLangham's indorsement is worth something, and Linscott's a rich man;\neven Moxlow's got some property. Those are the three who are on your\npaper, and the paper's considerably overdue.\"\n\nLangham turned a pale face on the gambler.\n\n\"You won't do that, Andy!\" he said, in a voice which he vainly strove to\nhold steady.\n\n\"Won't I? Do you think I'm in business for my health?\" And he laughed\nshortly, then he wheeled on Langham with unexpected fierceness. \"I'll\ngive you until the first of the month, Marsh, and then I'm going after\nyou without gloves. I don't care a damn who squares the account; your\nindorsers' cash will suit me as well as your own.\" He caught the\nexpression on Langham's face, its deathly pallor, the hunted look in his\neyes, and paused suddenly. The shadow of a slow smile fixed itself at\nthe corners of his mouth, he put out a hand and rested it on Langham's\nshoulder. \"You damn fool! Have you tried that trick on me? I'll take\nthose notes to the bank in the morning and see if the signatures are\ngenuine.\"\n\n\"Do it!\" Langham spoke in a whisper.\n\n\"Maybe you think I won't!\" sneered the gambler. \"Maybe you'd rather I\ndidn't, eh? It will hardly suit you to have me show those notes?\"\n\n\"Do what you like; whatever suggests itself to a scurvy whelp like you!\"\nsaid Langham.\n\nGilmore merely grinned at this.\n\n\"If you are trying to encourage me to smash you, Marsh, you have got the\nright idea as to how it is to be done.\" But his tone was now one of lazy\ngood nature.\n\n\"Smash me then; I haven't the money to pay you.\"\n\n\"Get it!\" said Gilmore tersely.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"You are asking too much of me, Marsh. If I could finance you I'd cut\nout cards in the future. How about the judge,--no? Well, I just threw\nthat out as a hint, but I suppose you have been there already, for\nnaturally you'd compliment him by giving him the chance to pull you up\nout of your troubles. Since your own father won't help you, how about\nLinscott? Is he going to want to see his son-in-law disgraced? I guess\nhe's your best chance, Marsh. Put it on strong and for once tell the\ntruth. Tell him you've dabbled in forgery and that it won't work!\"\n\nLangham had dropped back in his chair. He was seeking to devise some\nexpedient that would meet his present difficulties. His bondage to the\ngambler had become intolerable, anything would be better than a\ncontinuance of that. The monstrous folly of those forgeries seemed\nbeyond anything he could have perpetrated in his sober senses. He must\nhave been mad! But then he had needed the money desperately.\n\nHe might go to his, father, but he had been to him only recently, and\nthe judge himself was burdened with debt. He might go to Mr. Linscott,\nhe might even try North. He could tell the latter the whole circumstance\nand borrow a part of what was left of his small fortune; of course he\nwas in his debt as it was, but North would never think of that; he was a\nman to share his last dollar with a friend.\n\nHe passed a shaking hand across his eyes. On every side the nightmare of\nhis obligations confronted him, for who was there that he could owe whom\nhe did not already owe? He was notorious for his inability to pay his\ndebts. This notoriety was hurting his professional standing, and now if\nGilmore carried out his threat he must look forward to the shame of a\npublic exposure. His very reputation for common honesty was at stake.\n\nHe wondered what men did in a crisis such as this. He wondered what\nhappened to them when they could do nothing more. Usually he was fertile\nin expedients, but to-day his brain seemed wholly inert. He realized\nonly a certain dull terror of the future; the present eluded him\nutterly.\n\nHe had never been over-scrupulous perhaps, he had always taken what he\npleased to call long chances, and it was in almost imperceptible\ngradations that he had descended in the scale of honesty to the point\nthat had at last made possible these forgeries. Until now he had always\nfelt certain of himself and of his future; time was to bring him into\nthe presence of his dear desires, when he should have money to lift the\nburden of debt, money to waste, money to scatter, money to spend for the\ngood things of life.\n\nBut he had made the fatal mistake of anticipating the success in which\nhe so firmly believed. Those notes--he dashed his hand before his face;\nsuddenly the air of the room seemed to stifle him, courage and cunning\nhad left him; there was only North to whom he could turn for a few\nhundreds with which to quiet Gilmore. Let him but escape the\nconsequences of his folly this time and he promised himself he would\nretrench; he would live within his income, he would apply himself to his\nprofession as he had never yet applied himself. He scowled heavily at\nGilmore, who met his scowl with a cynical smile.\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do?\" he queried.\n\nBut Langham did not answer at once. He had turned and was looking from\nthe window. It was snowing now very hard, and twilight, under the edges\nof torn gray clouds was creeping over the Square; he could barely see\nthe flickering lights in Archibald McBride's dingy shop-windows.\n\n\"Give me a chance, Andy!\" he said at last appealingly.\n\n\"To the end of the month, not a day more,\" asserted Gilmore.\n\n\"Where am I to get such a sum in that time? You know I can't do it!\"\n\n\"Don't ask me, but turn to and get it, Marsh. That's your only hope.\"\n\n\"By the first of the year perhaps,\" urged Langham.\n\n\"No, get rid of the notion that I am going to let up on you, for I\nain't! I'm going to squat on your trail until the money's in my hand;\notherwise I know damn well I won't ever see a cent of it! I ain't your\nonly creditor, but the one who hounds you hardest will see his money\nfirst, and I got you where I want you.\"\n\n\"I can't raise the money; what will you gain by ruining me?\" demanded\nLangham. He wished to impress this on Gilmore, and then he would propose\nas a compromise the few hundreds it would be possible to borrow from\nNorth.\n\n\"To get square with you, Marsh, will be worth something, and frankly, I\nain't sure that I ever expected to see any of that money, but as long as\nyou stood my friend I was disposed to be easy on you.\"\n\n\"I am still your friend.\"\n\n\"Just about so-so, but you won't keep Moxlow--\"\n\n\"I can't!\"\n\n\"Then I can't see where your friendship comes in.\" Gilmore quitted his\nchair.\n\n\"Wait, Andy!\" said Langham hastily.\n\n\"No use of any more talk, Marsh, I want my money! Go dig it up.\"\n\n\"Suppose, by straining every nerve, I can raise five hundred dollars by\nthe end of the month--\"\n\n\"Oh, pay your grocer with that!\"\n\nLangham choked down his rage. \"You haven't always been so contemptuous\nof such sums.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling proud to-day, Marsh. I'm going to treat myself to a few\nairs, and you can pat yourself on the back when you've dug up the money\nby the end of the month! You'll have done something to feel proud of,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Suppose we say a thousand,\" urged Langham.\n\n\"Good old Marsh! If you keep on raising yourself like this you'll soon\nget to a figure where we can talk business!\" Gilmore laughed.\n\n\"Perhaps I can raise a thousand dollars. I don't know why I should think\nI can, but I'm willing to try; I'm willing to say I'll try--\"\n\nGilmore shook his head.\n\n\"I've told you what you got to do, Marsh, and I mean every damn word I\nsay,--understand that? I'm going to have my money or I'm going to have\nthe fun of smashing you.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Andy!\" began Langham desperately.\n\n\"Why take me into your confidence?\" asked the gambler coldly.\n\n\"What will you gain by ruining me?\" repeated Langham fiercely.\n\nThe gambler only grinned.\n\n\"I am always willing to spend money on my pleasures; and besides when\nthose notes turn up, your father or some one else will have to come\nacross.\"\n\nLangham was silent. He was staring out across the empty snow-strewn\nSquare at the lights in Archibald McBride's windows.\n\n\"Remember,\" said Gilmore, moving toward the door. \"I'll talk to you when\nyou got two thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Damn you, where do you think I'll get it?\" cried Langham.\n\n\"I'm not good at guessing,\" laughed Gilmore.\n\nHe turned without another word or look and left the room. His footsteps\nechoed loudly in the hall and on the stairs, and then there was silence\nin the building. Langham was again looking out across the Square at the\nlights in Archibald McBride's windows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nADVENTURE IN EARNEST\n\n\nMr. Shrimplin had made his way through a number of back streets without\nadventure of any sort, and as the night and the storm closed swiftly in\nabout him, the shapes of himself, his cart and of wild Bill disappeared,\nand there remained to mark his progress only the hissing sputtering\nflame, that flared spectrally six feet in air as the little lamplighter\ndrove in and out of shabby unfrequented streets and alleys.\n\nIt had grown steadily colder with the approach of night, and the wind\nhad risen. The streets seemed deserted, and Mr. Shrimplin being as he\nwas of a somewhat fanciful turn of mind, could almost imagine himself\nand Bill the only living things astir in all the town.\n\nHe reached Water Street, the western boundary of that part of Mount Hope\nknown as the flats. He jogged past Maxy Schaffer's Railroad Hotel at the\ncorner of Front Street, which flung the wicked radiance of its bar-room\nwindows along the shining railroad track where it crossed the creek on\nthe new iron bridge; and keeping on down Water Street with its smoky\ntenements, entered an outlying district where the lamps were far apart\nand where red and blue and green switch lights blinked at him out of the\nstorm.\n\nIt was nearly six o'clock when he at last wheeled into the Square; here\nonly three gasolene burners--survivors of the old r\u00c3\u00a9gime--held their own\nagainst the fast encroaching gas-lamp.\n\nHe lighted the one in Division Street and was ready to turn and traverse\nthe north side of the Square to the second lamp which stood a block away\nat the corner of High Street. He was drawing Bill's head about--Bill\nbeing smitten with a sudden desire to go directly home leaving the\nnight's work unfinished--when the muffled figure of a man appeared in\nthe street in front of him. The inch or more of snow that now covered\nthe pavement had deadened the sound of his steps, while the eddying\nflakes had made possible his near approach unseen. As he came rapidly\ninto the red glare of Mr. Shrimplin's hissing torch that hero was\nexceeding well pleased to recognize a friendly face.\n\n\"How are you, Mr. North!\" he said, and John North halted suddenly.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Shrimp! A nasty night, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's the suffering human limit!\" rejoined Mr. Shrimplin with feeling.\n\nAs he spoke the town bell rang the hour; unconsciously, perhaps, the two\nmen paused until the last reverberating stroke had spent itself in the\nsnowy distance.\n\n\"Six o'clock,\" observed Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"Good night, Shrimp,\" replied North irrelevantly.\n\nHe turned away and an instant later was engulfed in the wintry night.\n\nHaving at last pointed Bill's head in the right direction Mr. Shrimplin\ndrove that trusty beast up to the lamp-post on the corner of High\nStreet, when suddenly and for no apparent reason Bill settled back in\nthe shafts and exhibited unmistakable, though humiliating symptoms of\nfright.\n\n\"Go on, you!\" cried Mr. Shrimplin, slapping bravely with both the lines,\nbut his voice was far from steady, for suppose Bill should abandon the\nrectitude of a lifetime and begin to kick.\n\n\"Go on, you!\" repeated Mr. Shrimplin and slapped the lines again, but\nless vigorously, for by this time Bill was unquestionably backing away\nfrom the curb.\n\n\"Be done! Be done!\" expostulated Mr. Shrimplin, but he gave over\nslapping the lines, for why irritate Bill in his present uncertain mood?\n\"Want I should get out and lead you?\" asked Mr. Shrimplin, putting aside\nwith one hand the blankets in which he was wrapped. \"You're a game old\ncodger, ain't you? I guess you ain't aware you've growed up!\"\n\nWhile he was still speaking he slipped to the ground and worked his way\nhand over hand up the lines to Bill's bit. Bill was now comfortably\nlocated on his haunches, but evidently still dissatisfied for he\ncontinued to back vigorously, drawing the protesting little lamplighter\nafter him. When he had put perhaps twenty feet between himself and the\nlamp-post Bill achieved his usual upright attitude and his countenance\nassumed its habitual contemplative expression, the haunted look faded\nfrom his sagacious eye and his flaming nostrils resumed their normal\nbenevolent expression. Taking note of these swift changes, it occurred\nto Mr. Shrimplin that rather than risk a repetition of his recent\nexperience he would so far sacrifice his official dignity as to go on\nfoot to the lamp-post. Bill would probably stand where he was,\nindefinitely, standing being one of his most valued accomplishments. The\nlamplighter took up his torch which he had put aside in the struggle\nwith Bill and walked to the curb.\n\nAnd here Mr. Shrimplin noticed that which had not before caught his\nattention. McBride's store was apparently open, for the bracketed oil\nlamps that hung at regular intervals the full length of the long narrow\nroom, were all alight.\n\nMr. Shrimplin, whose moods were likely to be critical and censorious,\nrealized that there was something personally offensive in the fact that\nArchibald McBride had chosen to disregard a holiday which his\nfellow-merchants had so very generally observed.\n\n\"And him, I may say, just rotten rich!\" he thought.\n\nMr. Shrimplin further discovered that though the lamps were lit they\nwere burning low, and he concluded that they had been lighted in the\nearly dusk of the winter afternoon and that McBride, for reasons of\neconomy, had deferred turning them up until it should be quite dark.\n\n\"Well, I'm a poor man, but I couldn't think of them things like he\ndoes!\" reflected Mr. Shrimplin; and then even before he had ceased to\npride himself on his superior liberality, he made still another\ndiscovery, and this, that the store door stood wide open to the night.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Mr. Shrimplin, \"maybe he's saving oil, but he's wasting\nfuel.\"\n\nApproaching the door he peered in. The store was empty, Archibald\nMcBride was nowhere visible. Evidently the door had been open some\nlittle time, for he could see where the snow, driven by the strong wind,\nhad formed a miniature snow-drift just beyond the threshold.\n\n\"Either he's stepped out and the door's blowed open,\" muttered Mr.\nShrimplin, \"or he's in his back office and some customer went out\nwithout latching it.\"\n\nHe paused irresolutely, then he put his hand on the knob of the door to\nclose it, and paused again. With his taste for fictitious horrors,\nusually indulged in, however, by his own warm fireside, he found the\npresent time and place slightly disquieting; and then Bill's singular\nand erratic behavior had rather weakened his nerve. From under knitted\nbrows he gazed into the room. The storm rattled the shuttered windows\nabove his head, the dingy sign creaked on its rusty fastenings, and with\neach fresh gust the bracketed lamps rocked gently to and fro, and as\nthey rocked their trembling shadows slid back and forth along the walls.\nThe very air of the place was inhospitable, forbidding, and Mr.\nShrimplin was strongly inclined to close the door and beat a hasty\nretreat.\n\nStill peering down the narrow room with its sagging shelves and littered\ncounters, he crossed the threshold. Now he could see the office, a space\npartitioned off at the rear of the building and having a glass front\nthat gave into the store itself. Here, as he knew, stood Mr. McBride's\nbig iron safe, and here was the high desk, his heavy ledgers--row after\nrow of them; these histories of commerce covered almost the entire\nperiod during which men had bought and sold in Mount Hope.\n\nA faint light burned beyond the dirty glass partition, but the tall\nmeager form of the old merchant was nowhere visible. Mr. Shrimplin\nadvanced yet farther into the room and urged by his sense of duty and\nhis public spirit, he directed his steps toward the office, treading\nsoftly as one who fears to come upon the unexpected. Once he paused, and\naddressing the empty air, broke the heavy silence:\n\n\"Oh, Mr. McBride, your door's open!\"\n\nThe room echoed to his words.\n\n\"Well,\" carped Mr. Shrimplin, \"I don't see as it's any of my business\nto attend to his business!\" But the very sound of his voice must have\ngiven him courage, for now he stepped forward, briskly.\n\nOn his right was a show-case in which was displayed a varied assortment\nof knives, cutlery, and revolvers with shiny silver or nickel mountings;\nthen the show-case gave place to a long pine counter, and at the far end\nof this was a pair of scales. Near the scales on a low iron standard\nrested an oil lamp, but this lamp was not lighted nor were the lamps in\nthe bracket that hung immediately above the scales, for behind the\ncounter at this point was a door, the upper half glass, that opened on a\nsmall yard which, in turn, was inclosed by a series of low sheds where\nthe old merchant stored heavy castings, bar-iron, and the like. Mr.\nShrimplin was shrewdly aware that it was one of McBride's small\neconomies not to light the lamps by that door so long as he could see to\nread the figures on the scales without their artificial aid.\n\nAnd then Mr. Shrimplin saw a thing that sent the blood leaping from his\nheart, while an icy hand seemed to hold him where he stood. On the floor\nat his very feet was a strange huddled shape. He lowered his gasolene\ntorch which he still carried, and the shape resolved itself into the\nfigure of a man; an old man who lay face down on the floor, his arms\nextended as if they had been arrested while he was in the very act of\nraising them to his head. The thick shock of snow-white hair, worn\nrather long, was discolored just back of the left ear, and from this\nMr. Shrimplin's horrified gaze was able to trace another discoloration\nthat crossed in a thin red line the dead man's white collar; for the man\nwas dead past all peradventure.\n\n[Illustration: On the floor at his feet was a strange huddled shape.]\n\nMr. Shrimplin saw and grasped the meaning of it all in an instant. Then\nwith a feeble cry he turned and fled down the long room, pursued by a\nmillion phantom terrors. His heart seemed to die within him as he\nscurried down that long room; then, mercifully, the keen fresh air\nfilled his lungs. He fairly leaped through the open door, and again the\nstorm roared about him with a kind of boisterous fellowship. It smote\nhim in the face and twisted his shaking legs from under him. Then he\nfell, speechless, terrified, into the arms of a passer-by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nCOLONEL GEORGE HARBISON\n\n\nTerror-stricken as he was, Mr. Shrimplin recognized the man into whose\narms he had fallen. There was no mistaking the nose, thin and aquiline,\nthe bristling mustache and white imperial, the soft gray slouch hat, or\nthe military cloak that half concealed the stalwart form of its wearer.\n\nColonel George Harbison, much astonished and in utter ignorance of the\ncause of Mr. Shrimplin's alarm, took that gentleman by the collar and\ndeftly jerked him into an erect posture.\n\n\"My dear sir!\" the colonel began in a tone of mild expostulation,\nevidently thinking he had a drunken man to deal with. \"My dear sir, do\nbe more careful--\" then he recognized the lamplighter. \"Well, upon my\nword, Shrimp, what's gone wrong with you?\" he demanded, with military\nasperity.\n\n\"My God, Colonel, if he ain't lying there dead--\" a shudder passed\nthrough the little man; he was well-nigh dumb in his terror. \"And I\nstumbled right on to him there on the floor!\" he cried with a gasp.\n\nHe collapsed again, and again the colonel, whose gloved hand still\nretained its hold on his collar, set him on his trembling legs with\nadmirable expertness.\n\n\"I tell you he's dead!\" cried Mr. Shrimplin, lost to everything but that\none dreadful fact.\n\n\"Who's dead?\" demanded the colonel. \"Stand up, man, don't fall about\nlike that or you may do yourself some injury!\" for Mr. Shrimplin seemed\nabout to collapse once more.\n\n\"Old man McBride, Colonel--if he ain't dead I wish I may never see\ndeath!\"\n\n\"Dead!\" cried the colonel. \"Archibald McBride dead!\" He released his\nhold on Mr. Shrimplin and took a step toward the door; Shrimplin,\nhowever, detained him with a shaking hand, though he was calmer now.\n\n\"Colonel, you'd better be careful, he's lying there in a pool of blood;\nsome one's killed him for his money! How do we know the murderer ain't\nthere!\" This conjecture was made to the empty street, for Colonel\nHarbison had entered the store.\n\n\"Why does he want to leave me like that!\" wailed Shrimplin, and his\npanic threatened a return.\n\nHe dragged himself to the door. Here he paused, since he could not bring\nhimself to enter, for before his eyes was the ghastly vision of that old\nman huddled on the blood-stained floor. He heard the colonel's steps\necho down the long room, and when their sound ceased he knew he was\nstanding beside the dead man. After what seemed an age of waiting the\nsteps sounded again, and a moment later the colonel's tall form filled\nthe doorway.\n\n\"Andy!\" said the colonel.\n\nMr. Shrimplin turned with a start. At his back within reach of his hand\nstood Andy Gilmore. He had been utterly unaware of the gambler's\napproach, but now conscious of it he dropped in a miserable heap on the\ndoor-sill, while the white and unfamiliar world reeled before his\nbleached blue eyes; it was the very drunkenness of fear.\n\n\"Howdy, Colonel,\" said the gambler, as he gave Harbison a half-military\nsalute.\n\nHe admired the colonel, who had once threatened to horsewhip him if he\never permitted his nephew, Watt, to enter his rooms.\n\n\"Come here, Andy!\" ordered the colonel briefly.\n\n\"God's sake, Colonel!\" gasped the wretched little lamplighter,\nstruggling to his feet, \"don't leave me here--\"\n\n\"What's wrong, Colonel?\" asked Gilmore.\n\n\"Archibald McBride's been murdered!\"\n\nMr. Gilmore took the butt of the half-smoked cigar from between his\nteeth, tossed it into the gutter, and pushing past Mr. Shrimplin entered\nthe room.\n\nColonel Harbison, a step or two in advance of his companion, led the way\nto the rear of the store. The colonel paused, and Gilmore gained a place\nat his elbow.\n\n\"You are sure he's dead?\" questioned the gambler.\n\nKneeling beside the crumpled figure Gilmore slipped his hand in between\nthe body and the floor; his manner was cool and businesslike. After a\nmoment he withdrew his hand and looked, up into the colonel's face.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the colonel.\n\n\"Oh, he's dead, all right!\" Gilmore glanced about him, and the colonel's\neyes following, they both discovered that the door leading into the side\nyard was partly open.\n\n\"He went that way, eh, Colonel?\"\n\n\"It's altogether likely,\" agreed the veteran.\n\n\"It's a nasty business!\" said Gilmore reflectively.\n\n\"Shocking!\" snapped the colonel.\n\n\"He took big chances,\" commented the gambler, \"living the way he did.\"\nHe spoke of the dead man.\n\n\"Poor old man!\" said the colonel pityingly.\n\nWhat had it all amounted to, those chances for the sake of gain, which\nGilmore had in mind.\n\n\"He can't have been dead very long,\" said Gilmore. \"Did _you_ find him,\nColonel?\" he asked as he stood erect.\n\n\"No, Shrimplin found him.\"\n\nAgain the two men looked about them. On the floor by the counter at\ntheir right was a heavy sledge. Gilmore called Harbison's attention to\nthis.\n\n\"I guess the job was done with that,\" he said.\n\n\"Possibly,\" agreed Harbison.\n\nGilmore picked up the sledge and examined it narrowly.\n\n\"Yes, you can see, there is blood on it.\" He handed it to Harbison, who\nstepped under the nearest lamp with the clumsy weapon in his hand.\n\n\"You are right, Andy!\" and he glanced at the rude instrument of death\nwith a look of repugnance on his keen sensitive face, then he carefully,\nplaced it under the wooden counter. \"Horrible!\" he muttered to himself.\n\n\"It was no joke for him!\" said the gambler, catching the last word. \"But\nsome one was bound to try this dodge sooner or later. Why, as far back\nas I can remember, people said he kept his money hidden away at the\nbottom of nail kegs and under heaps of scrap-iron.\" He took a cigar from\nhis pocket, bit off the end, and struck a match. \"Well, I wouldn't want\nto be the other fellow, Colonel; I'd be in all kinds of a panic; it\ntakes nerve for a job like this.\"\n\n\"It's a shocking circumstance,\" said the colonel.\n\n\"I wonder if it paid!\" speculated the gambler. \"And I wonder who'll get\nwhat he leaves. Has he any family or relatives?\"\n\n\"No, not so far as any one knows. He came here many years ago, a\nclose-mouthed Scotchman, who never had any intimates, never married, and\nnever spoke of his private affairs.\"\n\nThere was a slight commotion at the door. They could hear Shrimplin's\nagitated voice, and a moment later two men, chance passers-by with whom\nhe had been speaking, shook themselves free of the little lamplighter\nand entered the room. The new-comers nodded to the colonel and Gilmore\nas they paused to stare mutely at the body on the floor.\n\n\"He bled like a stuck pig!\" said one of the men at last. He was a\nragged slouching creature with a splotched and bloated face half hidden\nby a bristling red beard. He glanced at Gilmore for an uncertain instant\nout of a pair of small shifty eyes. \"It's murder, ain't it, boss?\" he\nadded.\n\n\"No doubt about that, Joe!\" rejoined the gambler.\n\n\"I suppose it was robbery?\" said the other man, who had not spoken\nbefore.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered the colonel. \"We have not examined the place,\nhowever; we shall wait for the proper officials.\"\n\n\"Who do you want, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Coroner Taylor, and I suppose the sheriff,\" replied Harbison.\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"All right, I'll bring them; and say, what about the prosecuting\nattorney?\" as he turned to leave.\n\n\"Yes, bring Moxlow, too, if you can find him.\"\n\nThe man hurried from the room. Gilmore leaned against the counter and\nsmoked imperturbably. Joe Montgomery, with his great slouching shoulders\narched, and his grimy hands buried deep in his trousers pockets, stared\nat the dead man in stolid wonder. Colonel Harbison's glance sought the\nsame object but with a sensitive shrinking as from an ugly brutal thing.\nA clock ticked loudly in the office; there was the occasional fall of\ncinders from the grate of the rusted stove that heated the place; these\nwere sounds that neither Gilmore nor the colonel had heard before.\nPresently a lean black cat stole from the office and sprang upon the\ncounter; it purred softly.\n\n\"Hello, puss!\" said the gambler, putting out a hand. The cat stole\ncloser. \"I guess I'll have to take you home with me, eh? This ain't a\nplace for unprotected females!\" The cat crept back and forth under his\ncaressing touch.\n\nAt the street-door Shrimplin appeared and disappeared, now his head was\nthrust into the room, and now his nose was flattened against the dingy\nshow-windows; from neither point could he quite command the view he\ndesired nor could he bring himself to enter the building; then he\nvanished entirely, but after a brief interval they heard his voice. He\nwas evidently speaking with some one in the street. A little crowd was\nrapidly gathering about him, but it disintegrated almost immediately,\nhis listeners abandoning him to hurry into the store.\n\n\"You must stand back, all of you!\" said the colonel. \"Unless you are\nvery careful you may destroy important evidence!\"\n\nThe crowd assembled itself silently for the most part; here and there a\nman removed his hat, or made some whispered comment, or asked some eager\nlow-voiced question of Gilmore or the colonel. Men stood on boxes, on\nnail kegs, and on counters. Except for the little circle left about the\ndead man on the floor, every vantage point of observation was soon\noccupied. It was scarcely half an hour since Shrimplin had fallen\nspeechless into Colonel Harbison's arms, yet fully two hundred men had\ngathered in that long room or were struggling about the door to gain\nadmittance to it.\n\nAt a suggestion from Harbison, the gambler, followed by Joe, elbowed his\nway to the front door, which in spite of the protest of those outside,\nhe closed and locked. A moment later, however, he opened it to admit\nDoctor Taylor, the coroner, and Conklin, the sheriff. The latter\ninstantly set about clearing the room.\n\nGilmore and the colonel remained with the officials and during the\nsucceeding ten minutes the gambler, who had kept his post at the door,\nopened, it to Moxlow, young Watt Harbison and two policemen.\n\nAs the coroner finished his examination of the body, the sound of wheels\nwas heard in the Square and an undertaker's wagon drew up to the door.\nThe murdered man was placed on a stretcher and covered with a black\ncloth, then four men raised the stretcher and for the last time the old\nmerchant passed out under his creaking sign into the night.\n\n\"I've agreed to watch at the house, Andy,\" said Colonel Harbison. \"I\nwant you and Watt to come with me.\"\n\nThe gambler lighted a fresh cigar and the three men left the store.\n\nOn the Square groups of men discussed the murder. Though none was\npermitted to enter the store, the windows afforded occasional glimpses\nof the little group of officials within, until a policeman closed and\nfastened the heavy wooden shutters. Then the crowd slowly and\nreluctantly dispersed.\n\nMeanwhile the town marshal, under cover of the excitement, had descended\non the gas house where tramps congregated of winter nights for warmth\nand shelter. Here he found shivering over a can of beer, two homeless\nwretches, whom he arrested as suspicious characters. After this,\nofficial activity languished, for the official mind could think of\nnothing more to do.\n\nWith the scattering of the crowd on the Square, Shrimplin climbed into\nhis cart and drove off home. The smother of wind-driven snow still\nenveloped the, town, the very air seemed charged with mystery and\nhorror, and before the little lamplighter's eyes was ever the haunting\nvision of the murdered man.\n\nHe drove into the alley back of his house, unhitched Bill and led him\ninto the barn. His torch made the gloom of the place more terrifying\nthan utter darkness would have been. Suppose the murderer should be\nhiding there! Mr. Shrimplin's mind fastened on the hay-mow as the most\nlikely place of concealment, and the cold sweat ran from him in icy\nstreams; he could, almost see the murderer's evil eyes fixed upon him\nfrom the blackness above. But at last Bill was stripped of his harness,\nand the little lamplighter, escaping from the barn with its fancied\nterrors, hurried across his small back yard to his kitchen door.\n\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Shrimplin, as he entered the room. \"I was beginning to\nwonder if you'd ever think it worth your while to come home!\"\n\n\"What's the bell been ringing for?\" asked Custer. Mrs. Shrimplin was\nseated by the table, which was littered with her sewing; Custer occupied\nhis usual chair by the stove, and it was evident that they knew nothing\nof the tragedy in which Mr. Shrimplin had played so important, and as he\nnow felt, so worthy a part.\n\n\"I suppose I've been out quite a time, and I may say I've seen times,\ntoo! I guess there ain't no one in the town fitter to say they seen\ntimes than just me!\"\n\nThe light and comfort of his own pleasant kitchen had quite restored Mr.\nShrimplin.\n\n\"I may say I seen times!\" he repeated significantly. \"There's something\ndoing in this here old town after all! I take back a heap of the hard\nthings I've said about it; a feller can scare up a little excitement if\nhe knows where to look for it. I ain't bragging none, but I guess you'll\nhear my name mentioned--I guess you'll even see it in print in the\nnewspapers!\" He warmed his cold hands over the stove. \"Throw in a little\nmore coal, sonny; I'm half froze, but I guess that's the worst any one\ncan say of me!\"\n\n\"You make much of it, whatever it is,\" said Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\n\"Maybe I do and maybe I don't,\" equivocated Mr. Shrimplin genially.\n\n\"Maybe you're not above telling a body what kept you out half the\nnight?\" inquired his wife.\n\n\"If you done and seen what I've did and saw,\" replied Mr. Shrimplin\nimpressively, \"you'd look for a little respect in your own home.\"\n\n\"I'd be a heap quicker telling about it,\" said Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\nMr. Shrimplin turned to Custer.\n\n\"I guess, you're thinking it was a burglar; but, sonny, it wasn't no\nburglar--so you got another guess coming to you,\" he concluded\nbenevolently.\n\n\"I know!\" cried Custer. \"Some one's been killed!\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Mr. Shrimplin with increasing benevolence. \"Some one has\nbeen killed!\"\n\n\"You done it!\" cried Custer.\n\n\"I found the party,\" admitted Mr. Shrimplin with calm dignity.\n\n\"Oh!\" But perhaps Custer's first emotion was on the whole one of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"How you talk!\" said Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\n\"I reckon I might say more, most any one would,\" retorted Mr. Shrimplin\nquietly. \"It was old man McBride--someone's murdered him for his money;\nI never seen the town so on end over anything before, but whoever wants\nto be well posted's got to come to me for the particulars. I seen the\nold man before Colonel Harbison seen him, I seen him before Andy Gilmore\nseen him, I seen him before the coroner seen him, or the sheriff or\n_any one_ seen him! I was on the spot ahead of 'em all. If any one wants\nto know how he looked just after he was killed, they got to come to me\nto find out. Colonel Harbison can't tell 'em, and Andy Gilmore can't\ntell 'em; it's only me knows them particulars!\"\n\nThe effect of this stirring declaration was quite all he had hoped for.\nOut of the tail of his eye he saw that Mrs. Shrimplin was, as she\nafterward freely confessed, taken aback. As for Custer, he had forgotten\nhis disappointment that a death by violence had occurred for which his\nfather was not directly responsible.\n\n\"Did you see the man that killed old Mr. McBride?\" asked Custer,\nbreaking the breathless spell that was upon him.\n\n\"No; if I'd been just about fifteen minutes sooner I'd have seen him;\nbut I was just about that much too late, sonny. I guess he's a whole lot\nbetter off, though.\"\n\n\"What would you have done if you'd seen him?\" Custer's voice sank to a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Well, I don't pack a gun for nothing. If I'd seen him there, he'd had\nto go 'round to the jail with me. I guess I could have coaxed him there;\nI was ready for to offer extra inducements!\"\n\n\"And does everybody know you seen old Mr. McBride the first of any?\"\nasked Custer.\n\n\"I guess they do; I ain't afraid about that. Colonel Harbison's too much\nof a gentleman to claim any credit that ain't his; he'd be the first\none to own up that he don't deserve no credit.\"\n\n\"What took you into McBride's store? You hadn't no errand there.\" Mrs.\nShrimplin was a careful and acquisitive wife.\n\n\"I allow I made an errand there,\" said Mr. Shrimplin bridling. \"I reckon\nmany another man might have thought he hadn't no errand there either,\nbut I feel different about them things. I was just turned into the\nSquare when along comes young John North--\"\n\n\"What was he doing there?\" suddenly asked Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\n\"I expect he was attending strictly to his own business,\" retorted Mr.\nShrimplin, offended by the utter irrelevancy of the question.\n\n\"Go on, pal\" begged Custer.\n\nHe felt that his mother's interruptions were positively cruel, and--so\nlike a woman!\n\n\"Me and young John North passed the time of day,\" continued Mr.\nShrimplin, thus abjured, \"and I started around the north side of the\nSquare to light the lamp on old man McBride's own corner. If I'd knowed\nthen--\" he paused impressively, \"if I'd just knowed then, that was my\ntime! I could have laid hands on the murderer. He was there somewheres,\nmost likely he was watching me; well, maybe it was all for the best, I\ndon't know as a married man's got any right to take chances. Anyway, I\ngot to within, well--I should say, thirty feet of that lamp-post when\nall of a sudden Bill began to act up. You never saw a horse act up like\nhe done! He rose in his britching and then the other end of him come up\nand he acted like he wanted to set down on the singletree!\"\n\n\"Why did he do that?\" asked Custer.\n\n\"Well, I guess you've got some few things to learn, Custer;\" said Mr.\nShrimplin indulgently. \"He smelt blood--that's what he smelt!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" gasped Custer.\n\n\"I've knowed it to happen before. It's instinct,\" explained Shrimplin.\n\"'Singular,' says I, and out I jumps to have a look about. I walked to\nthe lamp-post, and then I seen what I hadn't seen before, that old man\nMcBride's store door was open, so I stepped on to the sidewalk intending\nto close it, but as I put my hand on the knob I seen where the snow had\ndrifted into the room, so I knew the door must have been open some\nlittle time. That's mighty odd, I thinks, and then it sort of come over\nme the way Bill had acted, and I went along into the store in pretty\nconsiderable of a hurry.\"\n\n\"Were you afraid?\" demanded Custer in an awe-struck whisper.\n\n\"I'll tell you the truth, Custer, I wasn't. I own I'd drawed my gun,\nwishing to be on the safe side. First thing I noticed was that the lamps\nhadn't been turned up, though they was all lit. I got back to the end of\nthe counter when I came to a halt, for there in a heap on the floor was\nold man McBride, with his head mashed in where some one had hit him\nwith a sledge. There was blood all over the floor, and it was a mighty\nsickenin' spectacle. I sort of looked around hoping I'd see the\nmurderer, but he'd lit out, and then I went back to the front of the\nstore, where I seen Colonel Harbison coming across the Square. I told\nhim what I'd seen and he went inside to look; while he was looking,\nalong come Andy Gilmore and I told him, too, and he went in. They knowed\nthe murderer wasn't there, that I'd been in ahead of them. After, that\nthe people seemed to come from every direction; then presently some one\nstarted to ring the town bell and that fetched more people, until the\nSquare in front of the store was packed and jammed with 'em. Everybody'\nwanted to hear about it first-hand from me; they wanted the _full\nparticulars_ from the only one who knowed 'em.\"\n\nMr. Shrimplin paused for breath. The recollection of his splendid\npublicity was dazzling. He imagined the morrow with its possibility of\nsocial triumph; he went as far as to feel that Mrs. Shrimplin now had a\ncertain sneaking respect for him.\n\n\"Did you see tracks in the snow?\" demanded Custer.\n\n\"No, I didn't see nothing,\" declared Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"You seen young John North.\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Shrimplin who spoke.\n\n\"Well, yes, I seen young John North--I said I seen him!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nPUTTING ON THE SCREWS\n\n\nA score of men and boys followed the undertaker's wagon to the small\nframe cottage that had been Archibald McBride's home for half a century,\nand a group of these assembled about the gate as the wagon drew up\nbefore it. Along the quiet street, windows were raised and doors were\nopened. It was perhaps the first time, as it was to be the last, that\nArchibald McBride's neighbors took note of his home-coming.\n\nHis keys had been found and intrusted to one of the policemen who\naccompanied the undertaker and his men; now, as the wagon came to a\nstand, this officer sprang to the ground, and pushing open the gate went\nquickly up the path to the front door. There in the shelter of the porch\nhe paused to light a lantern, then he tried key after key until he found\nthe one that fitted the lock; he opened the door and entered the house,\nthe undertaker following him. A second officer stationed himself at the\ndoor and kept back the crowd. Their preparations were soon made and the\ntwo men reappeared on the porch.\n\n\"It's all right,\" the undertaker said, and four men raised the stretcher\nagain and carried the old merchant into the house.\n\nAt this juncture Colonel Harbison, followed by his nephew and Gilmore,\nmade his way through the crowd before the door. Gilmore, even, gave an\ninvoluntary shudder as they entered the small hall lighted by the single\nlantern, while the colonel could have wished himself anywhere else; he\nhad come from a sense of duty; he had known McBride as well as any one\nin Mount Hope had known him, and it had seemed a lack of respect to the\ndead man to leave him to the care of the merely curious; but he was\npainfully conscious of the still presence in the parlor; he felt that\nthey were unwelcome intruders in the home of that austere old man, who\nhad made no friends, who had no intimates, but had lived according to\nhis choice, solitary and alone. The colonel and Watt Harbison followed\nthe gambler into what had been the old merchant's sitting-room. There\nwere two lamps on the chimneypiece, both of which Gilmore lighted.\n\n\"That's a whole lot better,\" he said.\n\n\"Anything more we can do, gentlemen?\" asked the undertaker, coming into\nthe room.\n\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" answered the colonel in a tone of abstraction, and\nhe felt a sense of relief when the officials had gone their way into the\nnight, leaving him and his two companions to their vigil.\n\nNow for the first time they had leisure and opportunity to look about\nthem. It was a poor enough place, all things considered; the furniture\nwas dingy with age and neglect, for Archibald McBride had kept no\nservant; a worn and faded carpet covered the floor; there was an\nengraving of Washington Crossing the Delaware and a few old-fashioned\nwoodcuts on the wall; at one side of the room was a desk, opposite it a\nrusted sheet-iron stove in which Watt Harbison was already starting a\nfire; there was a scant assortment of uncomfortable chairs, a table,\nwith one leg bandaged, and near the desk an old mahogany davenport.\n\n\"This wouldn't have suited you, eh, Colonel?\" said Gilmore at last.\n\n\"He could hardly be said to live here, he merely came here to sleep,\"\nanswered the colonel.\n\n\"No, he couldn't have cared for anything but the one thing,\" said\nGilmore. \"Were you ever here before, Colonel?\" he added.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose half a dozen people in the town were ever inside his\ndoor until to-night,\" said Watt Harbison, speaking for the first time.\n\nGilmore turned to look at the colonel's nephew as if he had only that\nmoment become aware of his presence. What he saw did not impress him\ngreatly, for young Watt, save for an unusually large head, was much like\nother young men of his class. His speech was soft, his face beardless\nand his gray eyes gazed steadily but without curiosity on, what was for\nhim, an uncliented world. For the eighteen months that he had been an\n\"attorney and counselor at law\" the detail of office rent had been taken\ncare of by the colonel.\n\n\"Sort of makes the game he played seem rotten poor sport,\" commented\nGilmore, replying to the nephew but looking at the uncle.\n\nThe colonel was silent.\n\n\"Rotten poor sport!\" repeated Gilmore.\n\n\"Who'll come in for his property?\" asked Watt Harbison.\n\n\"Oh, some one will claim that,\" said Gilmore. \"They were saying down at\nthe store, that once, years ago, a brother of his turned up, here, but\nMcBride got rid of him.\"\n\n\"Suppose we have a look around before we settle ourselves for the\nnight,\" suggested Watt Harbison.\n\n\"Will you join us, Colonel?\" asked the gambler.\n\nBut the colonel shook his head. Gilmore took up one of the lamps as he\nspoke and opened a door that led into what had evidently once been a\ndining-room, but it was now only partly furnished; back of this was a\nkitchen, and beyond the kitchen a woodshed. Returning to the front of\nthe house, they mounted to the floor above. Here had been the old\nmerchant's bedroom; adjoining it were two smaller rooms, one of which\nhad been used as a place of storage for trunks and boxes and broken bits\nof furniture; the other room was empty.\n\n\"We may as well go back down-stairs,\" said the gambler, halting, lamp\nin hand, in the center of the empty room.\n\nHarbison nodded, and leading the way to the floor below, they rejoined\nthe colonel in the sitting-room, where they made themselves as\ncomfortable as possible.\n\nThe colonel and his nephew talked in subdued tones, principally of the\nmurdered man; they had no desire to exclude their companion from the\nconversation, but Gilmore displayed no interest in what was said. He sat\nat the colonel's elbow, preoccupied and thoughtful, smoking cigar after\ncigar. Presently the colonel and his nephew lapsed into silence. Their\nsilence seemed to rouse Gilmore to what was passing about him. He\nglanced at the elder Harbison.\n\n\"You look tired, Colonel,\" he said. \"Why don't you stretch out on that\nlounge yonder and take a nap?\"\n\n\"I think I shall, Andy, if you and Watt don't mind.\" And the colonel\nquitted his chair.\n\n\"Better put your coat over you,\" advised the gambler.\n\nHe watched the colonel as he made himself comfortable on the lounge,\nthen he lighted a fresh cigar, tilted his chair against the wall and\nwith head thrown back studied the ceiling. Watt Harbison made one or two\ntentative attempts at conversation, to which Gilmore briefly responded,\nthen the young fellow also became thoughtful. He fell to watching the\ngambler's strong profile which the lamp silhouetted against the opposite\nwall; then drowsiness completely overcame him and he slept in his chair\nwith his head fallen forward on his breast.\n\nGilmore, alert and sleepless, smoked on; he was thinking of Evelyn\nLangham. After his interview with her husband that afternoon he had gone\nto his own apartment. His bedroom adjoined North's parlor and through\nthe flimsy lath and plaster partition he had distinctly heard a woman's\nvoice. The sound of that voice and the suspicion it instantly begot\nadded to his furious hatred of North, for he had long suspected that\nsomething more than friendship existed between Marshall Langham's wife\nand Marshall Langham's friend.\n\n\"Damn him!\" thought the gambler. \"I'll fix him yet!\" And he puffed at\nhis cigar viciously.\n\nHe had made sure that North's mysterious visitor was Evelyn Langham, for\nwhen she left the building he himself had followed her. Out of the dregs\nof his nature this foolish mad passion of his had arisen to torture him;\nhe had never spoken with Langham's wife, probably she knew him by sight,\nnothing more; but still his game, the waiting game he had been forced to\nplay, was working itself out better than he had even hoped! At last he\nhad Marshall Langham where he wanted him, where he could make him feel\nhis power. Langham would not be able to raise the money required to\ncover up those forgeries, and on the basis of silence he would make his\nbargain with the lawyer.\n\nGilmore pondered this problem for the better part of an hour,\nconsidering it from every conceivable angle; then suddenly the\nexpression of his face changed, he forgot for the moment his ambitions\nand his desires, his hatred and his love; he thought he heard the click\nof the old-fashioned latch on the front gate. He remembered that it\ncould be raised only with difficulty. Next he heard the sound of\nfootsteps approaching the house. They seemed to come haltingly down the\nnarrow brick path which the wind had swept clear of snow.\n\nMr. Gilmore was blessed with a steadiness of nerve known to but few men,\nyet the hour and the occasion had their influence with him. He stood\nerect: now the steps which had paused for a moment seemed to recede; it\nwas as if the intruder, whoever he might be, had come almost to the\nfront door and had then, for some inexplicable reason, gone back to the\nstreet. Gilmore even imagined him as standing there with his hand on the\nlatch of the gate. He was tempted to rouse his two companions, but he\ndid not, and then, as he still stood with his senses tense, he heard the\nsteps again approach the front door. With a glance in the direction of\nthe colonel and his nephew to assure himself that they still slept,\nGilmore rather shamefacedly slipped his right hand under the tails of\nhis coat, tiptoed into the hall and paused there close by the parlor\ndoor. The steps outside continued, he heard the porch floor give under\na weight, and then some one rapped softly on the door.\n\nGilmore waited an instant; the rap was repeated; he stepped to the door,\nshot the bolt and opened it. The storm had passed; it was now cold and\nclear, a brilliant, starlit, winter's night. He saw the man on the porch\nclearly as he stood there with the world in white at his back. Gilmore\ninstantly recognized him, and his hand came from under the tails of his\ncoat; he closed the door softly.\n\n\"What sort of a joke is this, Marsh?\" he demanded in a whisper.\n\n\"Joke?\" repeated the lawyer in a thick husky voice, as he took an\nuncertain step toward the gambler.\n\n\"Your coming here at this hour; if it isn't a joke, what is it?\"\n\nGilmore saw that his face was flushed with drink while his eyes shone\nwith a light he had never seen in them before. He must have been abroad\nin the storm for some time, for the snow had lodged in the rim of his\nhat and his shoulders were still white with it; now and again a paroxysm\nof shivering seized him.\n\n\"Whisky chill,\" thought the gambler. \"Come in, Marsh!\" he said, but\nLangham seemed to draw back instinctively.\n\n\"No, I guess not, Andy!\" and a sickly pallor overspread his face.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" demanded Gilmore.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said the other. \"I can't go home yet.\" He swayed\nheavily. \"I need to talk to you on a matter of business. Come on\nout--come on off of here;\" and he led the way down the porch steps.\n\"Whom have you in there with you?\" he questioned when he had drawn\nGilmore a little way along the path.\n\n\"The colonel and Watt Harbison.\"\n\n\"No one else?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do they know I'm here?\"\n\n\"I guess not, they were asleep two minutes ago.\"\n\n\"That's good. I don't want to see them, I want to see you.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it keep, Marsh?\" asked Gilmore.\n\n\"No, sir, it wouldn't keep; I want to tell you just what I think of you,\nyou damn--\"\n\n\"Oh, that will keep, Marsh, any time will do for that; anyway, you have\ntold me something like that already! When you sober up--\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm drunk?\"\n\n\"I don't think anything about it.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe I am, I have been under a strain. But I'm not too drunk to\nattend to business; I am never too drunk for that. I wish to say I have\nthe money--\"\n\nHis lips twitched, and Gilmore, watching him furtively, saw that he was\nagain shivering.\n\n\"You got what, Marsh?\" demanded Gilmore in a whisper.\n\n\"The money, the money I owe you!\"\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" He fell back a step and stared at Langham; there was\napprehension dawning in his eyes. \"Where did you get it?\" he asked.\n\nBut Langham shook his head.\n\n\"That's my business; it's enough for you to get your money.\"\n\n\"Well, you were quick about it,\" said Gilmore, and he rested his hand on\nthe lawyer's arm.\n\nLangham moved a step aside.\n\n\"You threatened me,\" he said resentfully, but with drunken dignity. \"You\nwere going to smash me; I wish to say that now you can smash and be\ndamned! I have the money--\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Marsh! Don't you feel cut up about that; I didn't mean to\nmake you mad; you mustn't hold that against me!\"\n\n\"You come to my office to-morrow and get your money,\" said Langham,\nstill with dignity. \"I've been under a great strain getting that money,\nand now I'm done with you--\"\n\nGilmore laughed.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\"\n\n\"You, you fool! But you aren't done with me; we'll be closer friends\nthan ever after this. Just now you are too funny for me to take\nseriously. You go home and sleep off this drunk; that's my advice to\nyou! I'd give a good deal to know where you have been and what sort of\na fool you have been making of yourself since I saw you last!\" added\nGilmore.\n\n\"Don't you worry about me; I'm all right. What I want to say is, lend me\nyour keys; I can't go home this way--lend me your keys and I'll go to\nyour rooms and sleep it off.\"\n\n\"All right, Marsh; think you can get there?\"\n\n\"Of course; I'm all right.\"\n\n\"And you'll go there if I give you my keys--you'll go nowhere else?\"\n\n\"Of course I won't, Andy!\"\n\n\"You won't stop to talk with any one?\"\n\n\"Who'll I find to talk with at this time of the night?\" laughed the\ndrunken man derisively. \"It's three o'clock! Say, Andy, who'll I find to\ntalk to?\"\n\n\"By God, I hope no one, you fool!\" muttered Gilmore.\n\n\"Well, give me the keys, Andy. I'll go along and get to bed, and I want\nyou to forget this conversation--\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll forget it all right, Marsh--but you won't after you come to\nyour senses!\" he added under his breath.\n\n\"Give me the keys--thanks. Good night, Andy! I'll see you in the\nmorning.\"\n\nHe reeled uncertainly down the path, cursing his treacherous footing as\nhe went. At the gate he paused and waved an unsteady farewell to the\ngambler, who stood on the porch staring after him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nTHE BEAUTY OF ELIZABETH\n\n\nHis interview with Evelyn Langham left North with a sense of moral\nnausea, yet he felt he had somehow failed in his comprehension of her,\nthat she had not meant him to understand her as he had; that, after all,\nperhaps the significance he had given to her words was of his own\nimagining.\n\nHe waited in his room until she should have time to be well on her way\nhome, then hurried down-stairs. He was to dine at the Herberts' at seven\no'clock, and as their place was but scant two miles from town, he\ndetermined to walk. He crossed the Square, only stopping to speak with\nthe little lamplighter, and twenty minutes later Mount Hope, in the cold\nbreath of the storm, had dwindled to a huddle of faint ghostly lights on\nthe hillside and in the valley.\n\nThe Herbert home, a showy country-place in a region of farms, merited a\nname; but no one except Mrs. Herbert, who in the first flush of\npossession determined so to dignify it, had ever made use of the name\nshe had chosen after much deliberation. General Herbert himself called\nit simply the farm, while to the neighbors and the dwellers in Mount\nHope it was known as the general's place, which perhaps sufficiently\ndistinguished it; for its owner was still always spoken of as the\ngeneral, though since the war he had been governor of his state.\n\nRather less than half a century before, Daniel Herbert, then a country\nurchin tending cattle on the hillside where now stood his turreted stone\nmansion, had decided that some day when he should be rich he would\nreturn and buy that hillside and the great reach of flat river-bottom\nthat lay adjacent to it, and there build his home. His worldly goods at\nthe time of this decision consisted of a pair of jeans trousers, a\nhickory shirt, and a battered straw hat. For years he had forgotten his\nboyish ambition. He had made his way in the world; he had won success in\nhis profession, the law; he had won even greater distinction as a\nsoldier in the Civil War; he had been a national figure in politics, and\nhe had been governor of his state. And then had come the country-bred\nman's hunger for the soil. He had remembered that hillside where as a\nboy he had tended his father's herds.\n\nHe was not a rich man, but he had married a rich woman, and it was her\nmoney that bought the many acres and built the many-turreted mansion.\nWishing, perhaps, to mark the impermanency of the life there and to give\nit a purely holiday aspect, Mrs. Herbert had christened the place Idle\nHour; but the governor, beyond occasional participation in local\npolitics, never again resumed those activities by which he had so\ndistinguished himself. He wore top-boots and rode about the farm on an\nold gray horse, while his intimates were the neighboring farmers, with\nwhom he talked crops and politics by the hour.\n\nIn pained surprise Mrs. Herbert, a woman of great ambition, had endured\nfive years of this kind of life; with unspeakable bitterness of spirit\nshe had seen the once potent name of Daniel Herbert disappear from the\nnewspapers, and then she had died.\n\nOn her death the general became a rich and, in a way, a free man, for\nnow he could, without the silent protest of his wife, recover the\nneglected lore of wood and field, and practise forgotten arts that had\nin his boyhood come under the elastic head of chores. Elizabeth, his\ndaughter, had never shared her mother's ambitions. Perhaps because she\nhad always had it she cared nothing for society. She was well content to\nride about the farm with her father, whom she greatly admired, and at\nwhose eccentricities she only smiled.\n\nIn this agreeable comradeship with his daughter, General Herbert had\nlived through the period of his bereavement with very tolerable comfort.\nHe had rendered the dead the dead's due of regretful tenderness; but\nElizabeth never asked him when he was going to make his re\u00c3\u00abntry into\npolitics; and she never reproached him with having wasted the very best\nyears of his life in trying to make four hundred acres of\nscientifically farmed land show a profit, a feat he had not yet\naccomplished.\n\nQuitting the highway, North turned in at two stone pillars that marked\nthe entrance to Idle Hour and walked rapidly up the maple-lined driveway\nto the great arched vestibule that gave to the house the appearance of a\nNorman-French ch\u00c3\u00a2teau.\n\nAnswering the summons of the bell, a maid ushered him into the long\ndrawing-room, and into the presence of the general and his daughter. The\nformer received North with a perceptible shade of reserve. He knew more\nabout the young man than he would have cared to tell his daughter, since\nhe believed it would be better for her to make her own discoveries where\nNorth was concerned. He had not opposed his frequent visits to Idle\nHour, for he felt that if Elizabeth was interested in the young fellow\nopposition would only strengthen it. Glancing at North as he greeted\nElizabeth, the general admitted that whatever he might be, he was\npresentable, indeed good-looking, handsome. Why hadn't he done something\nother than make a mess of his life! He wondered, too, wishing to be\nquite fair, if North had not been the subject of a good deal of\nunmerited censure, if, after all, his idleness had not been the worst\nthing about him. He hoped this might be true. Still he regretted that\nElizabeth should have allowed their boy and girl friendship--they had\nknown each other always--to grow into a closer intimacy.\n\nIn the minds of these two men there was absolute accord on one point.\nEither would have said that Elizabeth Herbert's beauty was a supreme\nendowment, and more nearly perfect than the beauty of any other woman.\nShe was slender, not tall, but poised and graceful with a distinction of\nbearing that added to her inches. Her hair was burnished copper and her\ncoloring the tint of warm ivory with the sunlight showing through. North\ngazed at her as though he would store in his memory the vision of her\nloveliness. Then they walked out to the dining-room.\n\nThe dinner was rather a somber feast. North felt the restraint of the\ngeneral's presence; he sensed his disfavor; and with added bitterness he\nrealized that this was his last night in Mount Hope, that the morrow\nwould find him speeding on his way West. He had given up everything for\nnothing, and now that a purpose, a hope, a great love had come to him,\nhe must go from this place, the town of his birth, where he had become a\nbankrupt in both purse and reputation.\n\nIt was a relief when they returned to the drawing-room. There the\ngeneral excused himself, and North and Elizabeth were left alone. She\nseated herself before the open fire of blazing hickory logs, whose\nlight, and that of the shaded lamps, filled the long room with a soft\nradiance. She had never seemed so desirable to North as now when he was\nabout to leave her. He stood silent, leaning against the corner of the\nchimneypiece, looking down on all her springlike radiance. Usually he\nwas neither preoccupied nor silent, but to-night he was both. The\nthought that he was seeing her for the last time--Ah, this was the price\nof all his folly! At length he spoke.\n\n\"I came to-night to say good-by, Elizabeth!\"\n\nShe glanced up, startled.\n\n\"To say good-by?\" she repeated.\n\nHe nodded gloomily.\n\n\"Do you mean that you are going to leave Mount Hope?\" she asked slowly.\n\n\"Yes, to-night maybe.\"\n\nHer glance no longer met his, but he was conscious that she had lost\nsomething of her serenity.\n\n\"Are you sorry, Elizabeth?\" he ventured.\n\nTo pass mutely out of her life had suddenly seemed an impossibility, and\nhis tenderness and yearning trembled in his voice. She answered\nobliquely, by asking:\n\n\"Must you go?\"\n\n\"I want to get away from Mount Hope. I want to leave it all,--all but\nyou, dear!\" he said. \"You haven't answered me, Elizabeth; will you\ncare?\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" she said slowly, and the light in her gray-blue eyes\ndarkened.\n\nShe heard the sigh that wasted itself on his lips.\n\n\"I am glad you can say that,--I wish you would look up!\" he said\nwistfully.\n\n\"Are you going to-night?\" she questioned.\n\n\"Yes, but I am coming back. I shan't find that you have forgotten me\nwhen I come, shall I, Elizabeth?\"\n\nShe looked up quickly into his troubled face, and it was not the warm\nfirelight that brought the rich color in a sudden flame to her cheeks.\n\n\"I shall not forget you.\"\n\nThere was a determined gentleness in her speech and manner that gave him\ncourage.\n\n\"I haven't any right to talk to you in this way; I know I haven't,\nbut--Oh, I want you, Elizabeth!\" And all at once he was on his knees\nbeside her, his arms about her. \"Don't forget me, dear! I love you, I\nLove you--I want you--Oh, I want you for my wife!\"\n\nThe girl looked into the passionate face upturned to hers, and then her\nhead drooped. And so they remained long; his dark head resting in her\narms; her fair face against it.\n\n\"Why do you go, John?\" she asked at length, out of the rich content of\ntheir silence.\n\n\"I haven't any choice, dear heart; there isn't any place for me here. I\nhave thought it all over, and I know I am doing the wise thing,--I am\nquite sure of this! I shall write you of everything that concerns me!\"\nhe added hastily, as he heard the tread of the general's slippered feet\nin the hall.\n\nNorth released her hands as the general entered the room. Elizabeth sank\nback in her chair. Her father glanced sharply at them, and North turned\ntoward him frankly.\n\n\"I am leaving on the midnight train, General, and I must say good-by; I\nhave to get a few things together for my trip!\"\n\nGeneral Herbert glanced again at Elizabeth, but her face was averted and\nhe learned nothing from its expression.\n\n\"So you are going away! Well, North, I hope you will have a pleasant\ntrip,--better let me send you into town?\"\n\nAnd he reached for the bell-rope. North shook his head.\n\n\"I'll walk, thank you,\" he said briefly.\n\nIn silence he turned to Elizabeth and held out his hand. For an instant\nshe rested hers in it, a cold little hand that trembled; their eyes met\nin a brief glance of perfect understanding, and then North turned from\nher. The general followed him into the hall.\n\n\"It's stopped snowing, and you will have clear starlight for your walk\nhome,--the wind's gone down, too!\" he said, as he opened the hall door.\n\n\"Don't come any farther, General Herbert!\" said North.\n\nBut the general followed him into the stone arched vestibule.\n\n\"It's a fine night for your walk,--but you're quite sure you don't want\nto be driven into town?\"\n\n\"No, no,--good night.\" And North held out his hand.\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nNorth went down the carriageway, and Herbert re\u00c3\u00abntered the house.\n\nNorth kept to the beaten path for a little while, then left it and\ntramped out across the fields until he came to a strip of woodland that\ngrew along a stony hillside. He followed this ridge back a short\ndistance and presently emerged upon a sloping meadow that overhung a\nnarrow ravine. Not two hundred yards distant loomed Idle Hour, somber\nand dark and massive. He found a stump on the edge of the woods and\nbrushed the snow from it, then drawing his overcoat closely about him,\nhe sat down and lit his pipe.\n\nThe windows of Idle Hour still showed their many lights. At his feet a\nthread-like stream, swollen by the recent rains, splashed and murmured\nceaselessly. He sat there a long time silent and absorbed, watching the\nlights, until at last they vanished from the drawing-room and the\nlibrary. Then other lights appeared behind curtained windows on the\nsecond floor. These in their turn were extinguished, and Idle Hour sank\ndeeper into the shadows as the crescent moon slipped behind the horizon.\n\n\"God bless her!\" North said aloud.\n\nHe knocked the ashes from his pipe, and retraced his steps to the drive.\nHe had but turned from this into the public road when he heard the\nclatter of wheels and the beat of hoofs, and a rapidly driven team swung\naround a bend in the road in front of him. He stepped aside to let it\npass, but the driver pulled up abreast of him with a loud command to his\nhorses.\n\n\"Heard the news?\" he asked, leaning out over the dash-board of his\nbuggy.\n\n\"What news?\" asked North.\n\n\"Oh, I guess you haven't heard!\" said the stranger. \"Well, old man\nMcBride, the hardware merchant, is dead! Murdered!\"\n\n\"Murdered!\" cried North.\n\n\"Yes, sir,--murdered! They found him in his store this evening a little\nafter six. No one knows who did it. Well, good night, I thought maybe\nyou'd like to know. Awful, ain't it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nA GAMBLER AT HOME\n\n\nIt was morning, and Mr. Gilmore sat by his cheerful open fire in that\nfront room of his, where by night were supposed to flourish those games\nof chance which were such an offense to the \"better element\" in Mount\nHope. Mr. Gilmore was hardly a person of unexceptional taste, though he\nhad no suspicion of this fact, since he counted that room quite all that\nany gentleman's parlor should be.\n\nIt was a large room furnished in dark velvet and heavy walnut. The red\nvelvet curtains at the windows, when drawn at night, permitted no ray of\nlight to escape; the carpet was a gorgeous Brussels affair, the like of\nwhich both as to cost and enduring splendor was not to be found\nelsewhere on any floor in Mount Hope. Seated as he then was, Gilmore\ncould look, if so disposed, at the reflection of his own dark but not\nunhandsome face in a massive gilt-framed mirror that reached from\nchimneypiece to ceiling; or, glancing about the room, his eyes could\ndwell with genuine artistic pleasure on numerous copies in crayon of\nFrench figure-studies; nor were the like of these to be found elsewhere\nin Mount Hope.\n\nGilmore had quitted the McBride cottage some three hours before, and in\nthe interim had breakfasted well and napped abstemiously. Presently he\nmust repair to the court-house, where, it had already been intimated,\nthe coroner might wish to confer with him.\n\nMarshall Langham he had not seen. He had expected to find him still in\nhis rooms, but the lawyer had left the key under the mat at the door,\npresumably at an early hour. Gilmore wondered idly if Langham had not\nmade a point of getting away before he himself should arrive; he rather\nthought so, and he smiled with cheerful malevolence at his own\nreflection in the mirror.\n\nHere his reveries were broken in on by the awkward shuffling of heavy\nfeet in the hallway, and then some one knocked loudly on his door.\nGilmore glanced hastily about to assure himself that the tell-tale\nparaphernalia of his craft were nowhere visible, and that the room was\nall he liked to fancy it--the parlor of a gentleman with sufficient\nincome and quiet taste.\n\n\"Come in,\" he called at last, without quitting his chair.\n\nThe door slowly opened and the crown of a battered cap first appeared,\nthen a long face streaked with coal-dust and grime and further decorated\nabout the chin by a violently red stubble of several days' growth. With\nso much of himself showing; the new-comer paused on the threshold in\napparent doubt as to whether he would be permitted to enter, or ordered\nto withdraw.\n\n\"Come in, Joe, and shut the door!\" said Gilmore.\n\nAt his bidding the shoulders and trunk, and lastly the legs of a\nslouching shambling man of forty-eight or fifty entered the room.\n\nClosing the door Joe Montgomery slipped off one patched and ragged cloth\nmitten and removed his battered cap.\n\n\"Well, what the devil do you want?\" demanded Gilmore sharply.\n\nJoe, shuffling and shambling, edged toward the grate.\n\n\"Boss, I want to drop a word with you!\" he said in a husky voice. His\nglance did not quite meet Gilmore's, but the moment Gilmore shifted his\ngaze, that moment Joe's small, bright blue eyes sought the gambler's.\n\nGilmore and Joe Montgomery were distantly related, and while the latter\nnever presumed on the score of this remote connection, the gambler\nhimself tacitly admitted it by the help he now and then extended him,\nfor Montgomery's means of subsistence were at the best precarious. If he\nhad been called on to do so, he would have described himself as a\nhandy-man, since he lived by the doing of odd jobs. He cleaned carpets\nin the spring; he cut lawns in the summer; in the fall he carried coal\ninto the cellars of Mount Hope, and in the winter he shoveled the snow\noff Mount Hope's pavements; and at all times and in all seasons,\nwhether these industries flourished or languished, he drank.\n\nHe now established himself on Mr. Gilmore's hearth,--a necessity--for he\nbent his hulking body and stuck his curly red head well into the grate;\nthen as he withdrew it, he passed the back of his hand across his\ndiscolored lip.\n\n\"Excuse me, boss, I had to!\" he apologized.\n\nIn Mr. Gilmore's presence Joe inclined toward a humble decency, for he\nwas vaguely aware that he was an unclean thing, and that only the\nmysterious bond of blood gave him this rich and powerful patron.\n\n\"Well, you old sot!\" said Gilmore pleasantly. \"You haven't drunk\nyourself to death since I saw you in McBride's last night?\"\n\nThe handy-man gave him a wide toothless grin, and his bashful blue eyes\nshifted, shuttle-wise, in their sockets until he was able to survey in\nfull the splendor of the apartment.\n\n\"Boss, you got a sure-enough well-dressed room; I never seen anything\nthat could hold a candle to it,--it's a bird!\" He stole a shy abashed\nglance at the pictures on the wall, but becoming aware that Gilmore was\nwatching him, he dropped his eyes in some confusion. \"I reckon' them\nfemale pictures cost a fortune!\" he said.\n\n\"They cost enough!\" rejoined Gilmore, and again Montgomery ventured a\ncovert glance in the direction of one of the works of art.\n\n\"I reckon it was summer-time!\" he hinted modestly.\n\nGilmore laughed.\n\n\"How would you like one of them?\" he asked.\n\nMontgomery gave him a swift glance of alarm.\n\n\"No, boss, I'm a respectable married man, and if I lugged one of them\nladies home with me, my old woman wouldn't do a thing but raise hell!\nBoss, they're raw; yes, sir, that's it--they're raw!\" Then fearing he\nhad gone too far in an adverse criticism, he added, \"Friends of yours,\nboss?\"\n\n\"Not all of them!\" said Gilmore, with lazy amusement.\n\n\"Catched unawares?\" hinted Montgomery. But Gilmore changed the subject\nabruptly.\n\n\"Well, what did you come here for?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I got a lot of things on my mind, boss! I been a-worryin' all morning\nand then I thinks of you. 'Mr. Gilmore's the man to go to,' I tells\nmyself, and I quit my job and come here.\"\n\nHe stuck his head into the grate again, but this time without apology.\n\n\"I suppose you are in trouble?\" said Gilmore, and his genial mood seemed\nto chill suddenly.\n\n\"You're right, boss, I'm in a heap of trouble!\"\n\n\"Well, then, clear out of here!\" said Gilmore.\n\n\"Hold on, boss, it ain't that kind of trouble\" interposed the handy-man\nhastily.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Advice.\"\n\nGilmore leaned back in his easy-chair and crossed his legs.\n\n\"Go on!\" he ordered briefly.\n\n\"A handy-man like me doin' all kinds of jobs for all kinds of people is\nsure to see some curious things, ain't he, boss?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I'm here to tell you what I seen, boss; and every word of it will be\nGod A'mighty's truth!\"\n\n\"It had better be!\" rejoined Gilmore quietly, but with significant\nemphasis.\n\n\"I don't want no better friend than you been to me,\" said Montgomery in\na sudden burst of grateful candor. \"You've paid two fines for me, and\nyou done what you could for me that time I was sent up, when old man\nMurphy said he found me in his hen-house.\"\n\nGilmore nodded.\n\n\"I was outrageous put upon! The judge appointed that fellow Moxlow to\ndefend me! Say, it was a hell of a defense he put up, and I had a friend\nwho was willin' to swear he'd seen me in the alley back of Mike\nLonigan's saloon cleaning spittoons when old man Murphy said I was in\nhis chicken house; Moxlow said he wouldn't touch my case except on its\nmerits, and the only merit it had was that friend, ready and willin' to\nswear to anything!\" Montgomery shrugged his great slanting shoulders.\n\"He's too damn perpendicular!\"\n\n\"He is,\" agreed Gilmore. \"But what's this got to do with what you saw?\"\n\n\"Not a thing; but it makes me sweat blood whenever I think of the trick\nMoxlow served me,--it ain't as if I had no one but myself! I got a\nfamily, see? _I_ can't afford to go to jail,--it ain't as if I was\nsingle!\"\n\n\"Get back to your starting-point, Joe!\" said Gilmore.\n\n\"Who do you think killed old man McBride, boss?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"You ain't got any ideas about that?\" asked Montgomery.\n\nGilmore shot him a swift glance.\n\n\"I don't know whether I have or not,\" he replied.\n\n\"I have, boss.\"\n\n\"You?\" His tone betrayed neither eagerness nor interest.\n\n\"That's what fetches me here, boss!\" Joe replied, sinking his voice to a\nwhisper. \"I got a damn good notion who killed old McBride; I could go\nout on the street and put my hand on the man who done it!\"\n\n\"You mustn't come here with these pipe dreams of yours, Joe; you have\nbeen drunk and all this talk about the McBride murder's gone to your\nhead!\" retorted Gilmore contemptuously.\n\n\"I hope I may die if I ain't as sober as you this minute, boss!\"\nreturned the handy-man impressively.\n\n\"Well, what do you know--or think you know?\" asked Gilmore with affected\nindifference.\n\n\"Boss, did I ever lie to you?\" demanded Montgomery.\n\n\"If you did I never found you out.\"\n\n\"And why? You never had no chance to find me out; for the reason that I\nalways tell you the almighty everlastin' truth!\"\n\n\"Well?\" prompted Mr. Gilmore.\n\n\"Boss,\" and again Montgomery dropped his voice to a confidential\nwhisper, \"boss, I seen a man climb over old man McBride's shed yesterday\njust before six. I seen him come up on top of the shed from the inside,\nlook all around, slide down to the eaves and drop into the alley, and\nthen streak off as if all hell was after him!\"\n\nGilmore's features were under such admirable control that they betrayed\nnothing of what was passing in his mind.\n\n\"Stuff!\" he ejaculated at last, disdainfully.\n\n\"You think I lie, boss?\" cried Montgomery, in an intense whisper.\n\n\"You know best about that,\" said Gilmore quietly.\n\n\"He come so close to me I could feel his breath in my face! Boss, he was\npuffin' and pantin' and his breath burnt,--yes, sir, it burnt; and I\nheard him say, 'Oh, my God!' like that, 'Oh, my God!'\"\n\n\"And where were you when this happened?\" demanded Gilmore with sudden\nsternness.\n\nMontgomery hesitated.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it, boss?\"\n\n\"A whole lot; come, out with it. Where were you to see and hear all\nthis?\"\n\n\"I was in White's woodshed,\" said Montgomery rather sullenly.\n\n\"Oh, ho, you were up to your old tricks!\"\n\n\"He'll never miss it; I couldn't freeze to death; there's a livin'\ncomin' to me,\" said the handy-man doggedly.\n\n\"You'll probably have a try for it back of iron bars!\" said Gilmore.\n\nBut it was plain that Montgomery did not enjoy Mr. Gilmore's humor.\n\n\"White's coal house is right acrost the alley from old McBride's shed.\nYou can go look, boss, if you don't believe me, and there's a small door\nopening out on to the alley, where the coal is put in.\"\n\n\"All the same you should keep out of people's coal houses, or one of\nthese days you'll bring off more than you bargained for; say a load of\nshot.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd like to know who I seen come over that roof?\" said the\nhandy-man impatiently.\n\n\"How many people have you told this yarn to already?\" asked Gilmore, who\nseemed more anxious to discredit the handy-man in his own eyes than\nanything else.\n\n\"Not a living soul, boss; I guess I know enough to hang a man--\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Gilmore.\n\n\"You don't believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll believe that you were stealing White's coal.\"\n\n\"Leave me tell it to you just as it happened, boss,\" said Montgomery.\n\"Then if you say I lie, I won't answer you back; we'll let it go at\nthat.\"\n\nGilmore appeared to consider for a moment, his look of mingled\nindifference and contempt had quite passed away.\n\n\"I guess it sounds straight, Joe!\" he said at length slowly.\n\n\"Why? Because it _is_ straight, every damn word of it, boss.\"\n\nAnd as if to give emphasis to his words the handy-man swung out a grimy\nfist and dropped it into an equally grimy palm.\n\n\"What did you do after that?\" asked Gilmore.\n\n\"Not much. I laid low and presently lifted my sack of coal out and\nducked around to Lonigan's saloon. I went in there by the back door and\nleft my sack leanin' against the building. Mike wanted his mail and he\ngive me a drink of whisky if I'd take his keys and go to the post-office\nfor him; I'd just come into the Square when I run into Shrimp who was\ntellin' how old man McBride was murdered. I went into the store and\nfound you there with Colonel Harbison, you remember, boss?\" Gilmore\nnodded and Montgomery continued. \"I hadn't a chance to tell you what I'd\nseen, and all night long I kept hearin' him say it!\"\n\n\"Say what, Joe?\"\n\n\"Say, 'Oh, my God!' like I told you, boss; I couldn't sleep for it,--I\nwonder if he slept!\"\n\n\"Joe,\" said the gambler, \"I'll tell you something that I have only told\nthe sheriff. I was in Langham's office late yesterday and John North was\nthere; he left to go to McBride's. Conklin's been looking for him this\nmorning, but he can't find him, and no one seems to know what's become\nof him. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"What's North got to do with it, boss?\"\n\n\"How do you know it wasn't North you saw in the alley?\" urged Gilmore.\n\n\"It were not!\" said Joe Montgomery positively.\n\n\"You saw the man's face?\"\n\n\"As plain as I see yours!\"\n\n\"And you know the man?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you who you saw,\" said the gambler coolly; \"it was\nMarshall Langham.\"\n\nThe handy-man swore a great oath.\n\n\"You've guessed it, boss! You've guessed it.\"\n\n\"It ain't a guess as it happens.\"\n\n\"Boss, do you mean to tell me you knew all along?\" demanded Montgomery\nincredulously.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But what about North?\"\n\n\"That's his lookout, let him clear himself.\"\n\nJoe, shambling and shuffling, took a turn about the room.\n\n\"Boss, if it was me that stood in his boots the halter would be as good\nas about my neck; they wouldn't give me no chance to clear myself,--they\nwouldn't let me! Them smart lawyers would twist and turn everything I\nsaid so that God A'mighty wouldn't know His own truth!\"\n\n\"Well, you were in that alley, Joe; if you feel for him, I expect we\ncould somehow shift it to you!\" said Gilmore.\n\nThe handy-man slouched to the hearth again.\n\n\"None of that, boss!\" he cried. \"I've told you what took me there, so\nnone of that!\"\n\nHis voice shook with suppressed feeling, as he stood there scowling down\non the gambler.\n\n\"Sit down, Joe!\" said Mr. Gilmore, unruffled.\n\nReluctantly the handy-man sank into the chair indicated.\n\n\"Now you old sot,\" began the gambler, \"you listen to me! I suppose if\nthey could shift suspicion so that it would appear you had had something\nto do with the old man's murder, it would take Moxlow and the judge and\nany decent jury no time at all to hang you; for who would care a damn\nwhether you were hanged or not! But you needn't worry, I'm going to\nmanage this thing for you, I'm going to see that you don't get into\ntrouble. Now, listen, you're to let well enough alone. North is already\nunder suspicion apparently. All right, we'll help that suspicion along.\nIf you have anything to tell, you'll say that the man who came over that\nshed looked like North!\"\n\n\"Boss, I won't say a word about the shed or the alley!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes you will, Joe! The man looked like North,--you remember, at the\ntime you thought he looked like North, and you thought you recognized\nhis voice when he spoke, and you thought it was North's voice. He had on\na black derby hat and a dark brown overcoat; don't forget that, Joe, for\nwe are going to furnish young Mr. North with a bunch of worries.\"\n\nThe handy-man looked at him doubtfully, sullenly.\n\n\"I don't want to hang _him_, he's always treated _me_ white enough,\nthough I never liked him to hurt.\"\n\nGilmore laughed unpleasantly.\n\n\"Oh, there's no chance of that, your evidence won't hang him, but it\nwill give him a whole lot to think about; and Langham's a pretty decent\nfellow; if you treat him right, he'll keep you drunk for the rest of\nyour days; you'll own him body and soul.\"\n\n\"A ignorant man like me couldn't go up against a sharp lawyer like Marsh\nLangham! Do you know what'd happen to me? I'll tell you; I'd get so\ndamned well fixed I'd never look at daylight except through jail\nwindows; that's the trick I'd serve myself, boss.\"\n\n\"I'll take that off your hands,\" said Gilmore.\n\n\"And what do you get out of it, boss?\" inquired the astute Mr.\nMontgomery.\n\n\"You'll have to put your trust in my benevolence, Joe!\" said the\ngambler. \"But I am willing to admit I want to see North put where he'll\nhave every inducement to attend strictly to his own business!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nTHE STAR WITNESS\n\n\nIt was between nine and ten o'clock when Marshall Langham reached his\noffice. He scarcely had time to remove his hat and overcoat when a\npoliceman entered the room and handed him a note. It was a hasty scrawl\nfrom Moxlow who wished him to come at once to the court-house.\n\nAs Moxlow's messenger quitted the room Langham leaned against his desk\nwith set lips and drawn face; this was but the beginning of the ordeal\nthrough which he must pass! Then slowly he resumed his hat and overcoat.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney's office was on the second floor of the\ncourt-house, at the back of the building, and its windows overlooked the\ncourt-house yard.\n\nOn the steps and in the long corridors, men stood about, discussing the\nmurder. Langham pushed his way resolutely through these groups and\nmounted the stairs. Moxlow's door was locked, as he found when he tried\nto open it, but in response to his knock a bolt was drawn and a\npoliceman swung open the door, closing it the instant Marshall had\nentered.\n\nLangham glanced around. Doctor Taylor--the coroner--was seated before\nthe desk; aside from this official Colonel Harbison, Andy Gilmore,\nShrimplin, Moxlow, Mr. Allison, the mayor, Conklin, the sheriff, and two\npolicemen were present.\n\n\"Thank you, that is all, Mr. Gilmore,\" the coroner had said as Langham\nentered the room.\n\nHe turned and motioned one of the policemen to place a chair for the\nprosecuting attorney beside his own at the desk.\n\n\"As you know, Mr. Moxlow,\" the coroner began, \"these gentlemen, Mr.\nShrimplin, Colonel Harbison and Mr. Gilmore, were the first to view the\nmurdered man. Later I was summoned, and with the sheriff spent the\ngreater part of the night in making an examination of the building. We\nfound no clue. The murderer had gone without leaving any trace of his\npassing. It is probable he entered by the front door, which Mr.\nShrimplin found open, and left by the side door, which was also open,\nbut the crowd gathered so quickly both in the yard and in the street,\nthat it has been useless to look for footprints in the freshly fallen\nsnow. One point is quite clear, however, and that is the hour when the\ncrime was committed. We can fix that almost to a certainty. The murderer\ndid his work between half past five and six o'clock. Mr. Shrimplin has\njust informed us that the only person he saw on the Square, until he met\nColonel Harbison, was John North, whom he encountered within a block of\nMcBride's store and with whom he spoke. While Mr. Shrimplin stopped to\nspeak with Mr. North the town bell rang the hour--six o'clock.\"\n\nThe coroner paused.\n\nThere was a moment's silence, then Marshall Langham made a half step\nforward. A sudden palsy had seized him, yet he was determined to speak;\nhe felt that he must be heard, that he had something vital to say. An\nimpulse he could not control compelled him to turn in the direction of\nAndy Gilmore, and for a brief instant his eyes fastened themselves on\nthe gambler, who returned his gaze with a cynical smile, as though to\nsay: \"You haven't the nerve to do it.\" With the tip of his tongue\nLangham moistened his swollen lips. He was about to speak now, and\nGilmore, losing his former air of bored indifference, leaned forward,\neager to catch every word.\n\n\"I would like to say,\" he began in a tolerably steady voice, \"that North\nleft my office at half past four o'clock yesterday afternoon intending\nto see Mr. McBride; indeed, happening to glance from my window, I saw\nhim enter the store. Before he left my office he had explained the\nbusiness that was taking him to McBride's; we had discussed it at some\nlength.\"\n\n\"What took him to McBride's?\" demanded Doctor Taylor.\n\n\"He went there to raise money on some local gas company bonds which he\nowned. Mr. McBride had agreed to buy them from him. I was able to tell\nNorth that I knew McBride could let him have the money in spite of the\nfact that it was a holiday and the banks were closed.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to know that, Langham?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"Earlier in the day one of my clients had placed in McBride's hand a\nmuch larger sum of money than North expected to receive from him.\"\n\n\"You told North that?\" asked Moxlow eagerly.\n\n\"I did. Perhaps you are not aware that McBride and North were on\nfriendly terms; for years it had been North's habit to go to Mr. McBride\nwhenever he had a sudden need of money. This I know to be a fact.\"\n\nHe glanced about him and could see that what he had said was making its\nimpression on his hearers.\n\n\"When did you see McBride, at what hour?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"A little before two.\"\n\n\"Do you feel at liberty to state the sum paid by your client?\"\n\n\"It was three thousand and fifty-seven dollars, all in cash.\"\n\n\"There are one or two more questions I should like to ask you,\" said\nMoxlow. \"You saw the money paid into Mr. McBride's hands before two\no'clock yesterday afternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know what disposition he made of the money?\"\n\n\"No, I do not.\"\n\n\"I mean, did he put it in his safe--in his pocket--\"\n\n\"He did neither in my presence, the bundle of bills was lying on his\ndesk when I left.\"\n\n\"You were not interrupted while you were transacting this business, no\ncustomer happened into the store?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"So far as I know, we three were absolutely alone in the building.\"\n\n\"Afterward, when North called at your office, you mentioned this\ntransaction?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know how many shares Mr. North expected to dispose of?\"\n\n\"Five, I think.\"\n\nLangham paused and glanced again in the direction of the gambler, but\nGilmore seemed to have lost all interest in what was passing.\n\nMoxlow turned to Conklin.\n\n\"You found no such sum as Mr. Langham mentions, either on the person of\nthe dead man, or in the safe?\"\n\n\"No, the safe doors were standing open; as far as I am able to judge,\nthe valuable part of its contents had been removed,\" replied the\nsheriff.\n\n\"How about McBride himself?\"\n\n\"We found nothing in his pockets.\"\n\n\"Of course, if he bought North's bonds, that would account for a part of\nthe sum Mr. Langham has just told us of,\" said Moxlow. \"But where are\nthe bonds?\" he added.\n\n\"They were not among McBride's papers, that's sure,\" said the sheriff.\n\n\"Probably they were taken also, though it's hardly conceivable that the\nmurderer waited to sort over the papers in the safe. I tell you,\ngentlemen, his position was a ticklish one.\" It was the coroner who\nspoke.\n\n\"It would seem a very desirable thing to communicate with North,\"\nsuggested Moxlow.\n\n\"I guess you are right; yes, I guess we had better try and find Mr.\nNorth,\" said the coroner. \"Suppose you go after him, Mr. Conklin. Don't\nsend--go yourself,\" he added.\n\nAgain Langham dragged himself forward; the coils of this hideous thing\nseemed to be tightening themselves about John North. Langham's face\nstill bore traces of his recent debauch, and during the last few minutes\na look of horror had slowly gathered in his bloodshot eyes. He now\nstudiously avoided Gilmore's glance, though he was painfully aware of\nhis presence. The gambler coolly puffed at a cigar as he leaned against\nthe casing of the long window at Doctor Taylor's back; there was the\nfaint shadow of a smile on his lips as he watched Langham furtively.\n\n\"I doubt if North will be found,\" said the latter. \"I doubt if he is in\nMount Hope,\" he continued haltingly.\n\n\"What?\" It was Moxlow who spoke.\n\n\"This morning I received a brief communication from him; it was written\nlate last night; he informed me that he should leave for the West on the\nChicago express. He inclosed the keys to his rooms.\"\n\nMarshall Langham glanced at Gilmore, who seemed deeply absorbed. The\ncoroner fidgeted in his seat; dismay and unspeakable surprise were\nplainly stamped on Colonel Harbison's face; Moxlow appeared quite\nnonplussed by what his partner had last said.\n\n\"I was aware that he contemplated this trip West,\" said Langham quickly.\n\"He had asked me to dispose of the contents of his rooms when he should\nbe gone.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you where he was going, Marshall?\" asked Moxlow.\n\nLangham raised his bloodshot eyes.\n\n\"No; he seemed in some doubt as to his plans.\"\n\n\"For how long a time have you known of Mr. North's intention to leave\nMount Hope?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"Only since yesterday, but I have known for quite a while that he\nplanned some radical move of this sort. I think he had grown rather\ntired of Mount Hope.\"\n\n\"Isn't it true that his money was about gone?\" questioned Moxlow\nsignificantly.\n\n\"I know nothing of his private affairs,\" answered Langham hastily. \"He\nhas never seemed to lack money; he has always had it to spend freely.\"\n\n\"It would appear that Mr. North is our star witness; what do you think,\ngentlemen?\" and Moxlow glanced from one to another of the little group\nthat surrounded him.\n\n\"At any rate he is a most _important_ witness,\" emphasized the coroner.\n\n\"North took the Chicago express as he had planned,\" said Gilmore\nquietly. \"The bus driver for the United States Hotel, where I\nbreakfasted, told me that he saw him at the depot last night.\"\n\n\"I think we'd better wire North's description to the Chicago police; I\nsee no other way to reach him.\" As he spoke, Moxlow turned to the\nsheriff. \"You get ready to start West, Mr. Conklin. And don't let there\nbe any hitch about it, either.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nHUSBAND AND WIFE\n\n\nMarshall Langham paused on the court-house steps; he was shaking as with\nan ague. He passed a tremulous hand again and again across his eyes, as\nthough to shut out something, a memory--a fantasy he wanted to forget;\nbut he well knew that at no time could he forget. Gilmore, coming from\nthe building, stepped to his side.\n\n\"Well, Marsh, what do you think?\" he said.\n\n\"What do I think?\" the lawyer, repeated dully.\n\n\"Doesn't it seem to you that Jack North has been rather unlucky in his\nmovements?\"\n\n\"Oh, they make me tired!\" cried Langham, with sudden passion.\n\nGilmore stared at him, coldly critical. The lawyer moved away.\n\n\"Going to your office, Marsh?\" the gambler asked.\n\n\"No, I'm going home,\" Langham said shortly, and went down the steps into\nthe street.\n\nHome--until he could pull up and get control of himself, that was the\nbest place for him!\n\nHe turned into the Square, and from the Square into High Street, and ten\nminutes later paused before his own door. After a brief instant of\nirresolution he entered the house. Evelyn was probably down-town at that\nhour, on one of the many errands she was always making for herself.\n\nWithout removing his hat or overcoat he dropped into a chair before the\nlibrary fire. A devastating weariness possessed him, but he knew he\ncould not hide there in his home. To-day he might, to-morrow even, but\nthe time would come when he must go out and face the world, must listen\nto the endless speculation concerning Mount Hope's one great sensation,\nthe McBride murder. Five minutes passed while he sat lost in thought,\nthen he quitted his chair and went to a small cabinet at the other side\nof the room, which he unlocked; from it he took a glass and a bottle.\nWith these he returned to his place before the fire and poured himself a\nstiff drink.\n\n\"I was mad!\" he said with quivering lips. \"Mad!\" he repeated, and again\nhe passed his shaking hand across his eyes. Once more he filled his\nglass and emptied it, for the potent stuff gave him a certain kind of\ncourage. Placing the bottle and glass on the table at his elbow, he\nresumed his seat.\n\nThe bottle was almost empty when, half an hour later, he heard the house\ndoor open and close. It was Evelyn. Presently she came into the room,\nstill dressed as if for the street.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter, Marsh?\" she asked in surprise.\n\n\"Matter? Nothing,\" he said shortly.\n\nShe glanced at the bottle and then at her husband.\n\n\"Aren't you well?\" she demanded.\n\n\"I'm all right.\"\n\n\"I hope you aren't going to start that now!\" and she nodded toward the\nbottle.\n\nHe made an impatient gesture.\n\n\"Marshall, I am going to speak to the judge; perhaps if he knew he could\ndo or say something; I am not going to bear this burden alone any\nlonger!\"\n\n\"Oh, what's the use of beginning that; can't you see I'm done up?\" he\nsaid petulantly.\n\n\"I don't wonder; the way you live is enough to do any one up, as you\ncall it; it's intolerable!\" she cried.\n\n\"What does it matter to you?\"\n\n\"It makes a brute of you; it's killing you!\"\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" he said.\n\n\"For you, perhaps; but what about me?\"\n\n\"Don't you ever think of any one but yourself?\" he sneered.\n\n\"Is that the way it impresses you?\" she asked coldly.\n\nShe slipped into the chair opposite him and began slowly to draw off her\ngloves. Langham was silent for a minute or two; he gazed intently at her\nand by degrees the hard steely glitter faded from his heavy bloodshot\neyes. Fascinated, his glance dwelt upon her; nothing of her fresh beauty\nwas lost on him; the smooth curve of her soft white throat, the alluring\ncharm of her warm sensuous lips, the tiny dimple that came and went when\nshe smiled, the graceful pliant lines of her figure, the rare poise\nof her small head--his glance observed all. For better or for worse he\nloved her with whatever of the man there was in him; he might hate her\nin some sudden burst of fierce anger because of her shallowness, her\ngreed, her utter selfishness; but he loved her always, he could never be\nwholly free from the spell her beauty had cast over him.\n\n[Illustration: Why, what's the matter, Marsh?]\n\n\"Look here, Evelyn,\" he said at last. \"What's the use of going on in\nthis way, why can't we get back to some decent understanding?\" He was\nhungry for tenderness from her; acute physical fear was holding him in\nits grip. He leaned back in his chair and found support for his head.\n\"You're right,\" he went on, \"I can't stand this racket much longer--this\nwork and worry; we are living beyond our means; we'll have to slow up,\nget down to a more sane basis.\" The words came from his blue lips in\njerky disjointed sentences. \"What's the use, it's too much of a\nstruggle! I do a thousand things I don't want to do, shady things in my\npractice, things no reputable lawyer should stoop to, and all to make a\nfew dollars to throw away. I tell you, I am sick of it! Why can't we be\nas other people, reasonable and patient--that's the thing, to be\npatient, and just bide our time. We can't live like millionaires on my\nincome, what's the use of trying--I tell you we are fools!\"\n\n\"Are matters so desperate with us?\" Evelyn asked. \"And is it all my\nfault?\"\n\n\"I can't do anything to pull up unless you help, me,\" Langham said.\n\n\"Well, are matters so desperate?\" she repeated.\n\nHe did not answer her at once.\n\n\"Bad enough,\" he replied at length and was silent.\n\nA sense of terrible loneliness swept over him; a loneliness peopled with\nshadows, in which he was the only living thing, but the shadows were\ninfinitely more real than he himself. He had the brute instinct to hide,\nand the human instinct to share his fear. He poured himself a drink.\nEvelyn watched him with compressed lips as he drained the glass. He drew\nhimself up out of the depths of his chair and began to tramp the floor;\nwords leaped to his lips but he pressed them back; he was aware that\nonly the most intangible barriers held between them; an impulse that\ngrew in his throbbing brain seemed driving him forward to destroy these\nbarriers; to stand before her as he was; to emerge from his mental\nsolitude and claim her companionship. What was marriage made for, if not\nfor this?\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, wheeling on her suddenly. \"Do you still love me;\ndo you still care as you once did?\" He seized one of her hands in his.\n\n\"You hurt me, Marsh!\" she said, drawing away from him.\n\nHe dropped her hand and with a smothered oath turned from her.\n\n\"You women don't know what love is!\" he snarled. \"Talk about a woman\ngiving up; talk about her sacrifices--it's nothing to what a man does,\nwhere he loves!\"\n\n\"What does _he_ do that is so wonderful, Marsh?\" she asked coldly.\n\nHe paused and regarded her with a wolfish glare.\n\n\"It's no damned anemic passion!\" he burst out.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she mocked. \"Really, Marsh, you are outdoing yourself!\"\n\n\"You have never let me see into your heart,--never once!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's just as well I haven't; perhaps it is a forbearance for\nwhich you should be only grateful,\" she jeered.\n\n\"If you were the sort of woman I once thought you, I'd want to hide\nnothing from you; but a woman--she's secretive and petty, she always\nkeeps her secrets; the million little things she won't tell, the little\nsecrets that mean so much to her--and a man wastes his life in loving\nsuch a woman, and is bitter when he finds he's given all for nothing!\"\n\nHis heavy tramping went on.\n\n\"Is that the way you feel about it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" he cried. \"I'm infinitely more lonely than when I married you!\nLook here; I came to you, and in six months' time you knew a thousand\nthings you had no right to know, unless you, too, were willing to come\nas close! But I'm _damned_ if I know the first thing about\nyou--sometimes you are one thing, sometimes another. I never know where\nto find you!\"\n\n\"And I am to blame that we are unhappy? Of course you live in a way to\nmake any woman perfectly happy--you are never at fault there!\"\n\n\"You never really loved me!\"\n\n\"Didn't I?\" she sighed with vague emotion.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why did I marry you, Marsh?\"\n\n\"Heaven knows--I don't!\"\n\n\"Then why did you marry _me_?\" She gave him a fleeting smile.\n\n\"Because I loved you--because you had crept into my heart with your\npretty ways, your charm, and the fascination of you. I hadn't any\nthought but you; you seemed all of my life, and I was going to do such\ngreat things for you. By God, I was going to amount to something for\nyour sake! I was going to make you a proud and happy woman, but you\nwouldn't have it! You never got past the trivial things; the annoyances,\nthe need of money, the little self-denials, the little inconveniences;\nyou stopped there and dragged me back when I wanted to go on; you\nwouldn't have it, you couldn't or wouldn't understand my hopes--my\nambitions!\"\n\n\"Marsh, I was only a girl!\" she said.\n\nHe put out his hand toward the bottle.\n\n\"Don't, Marsh!\" she entreated.\n\nHe turned away and fell to pacing the floor again.\n\n\"What happiness do we get out of life, what good? We go on from day to\nday living a life that is perfectly intolerable to us both; what's the\nuse of it--I wonder we stand it!\"\n\n\"I have sometimes wondered that, too,\" Evelyn half whispered.\n\n\"You had it in your power to make our life different, but you wouldn't\ntake the trouble; and see where we have drifted; you don't trust me and\nI don't trust you--\" She started. \"What sort of a basis is that for a\nman and wife, for our life together?\"\n\n\"It's what we--what you have made it!\" she answered.\n\n\"No, it isn't; it's what _you_ have made it! I tell you, you were bored\nto death; you wanted noise and world! Remember how I used to come home\nfrom the office every night, and begrudged the moments when any one\ncalled? I wanted only you; I talked over my cases with you, my hopes and\nmy ambitions; but you mighty soon got sick of that--you yawned, you were\nsleepy, and you wanted to go about; you thought it was silly staying\ncooped up like that, and seeing no one, going nowhere! It was stupid for\nyou, you were bored to death, you wanted noise and excitement, to spend\nmoney, to see and be seen,--as if that game was worth the candle in a\nGod-forsaken hole of a place like Mount Hope! You killed my ambition\nthen and there; I saw it was no use. You wanted the results, but you\nwouldn't pay the price in self-denial and patience, and so we rushed\ninto debt and it's been a scramble ever since! I've begged and borrowed\nand cheated to keep afloat!\"\n\n\"And I was the cause of it all?\" she demanded with lazy scorn of him.\n\n\"There was a time when I stood a chance of doing something, but I've\nfooled my opportunities away!\"\n\n\"What of the promises you made me when we were married--what about\nthem?\" she asked.\n\n\"You created conditions in which I could not keep them!\" he said.\n\n\"I seem to have been wholly, at fault; at least from your point of view;\nbut don't you suppose there is something _I_ could say? Do you suppose\n_I_ sit here silent because I am convinced that it is all my fault?\"\n\nHe did not answer her at once but continued to pace the floor; at length\nhe jerked out:\n\n\"No, I was at fault too. I've a nasty temper. I should have had more\npatience with you, Evelyn--but it was so hard to deny you anything you\nwanted that I could possibly give you--I'd have laid the whole world at\nyour feet if I could!\"\n\n\"I believe you would, Marsh--then!\" she said.\n\n\"It's a pity you didn't understand me,\" he answered indifferently.\n\nNothing he could say led in the direction he would have had it lead, for\nhe wanted her to realize her part in what had happened, to know that the\nburden beneath which he had gone down was in a measure the work of her\nhands. His instinct was as primitive as a child's fear of the dark; he\nmust escape from the horror of his isolation; his secret was made\ndoubly terrifying because he knew he dared not share it with any living\ncreature. Yet his mind played strange tricks with him; he was ready to\nrisk much that he might learn what part of the truth he could tell her;\nhe was even ready to risk all in a dumb brute impulse to gather up the\nremnants of his strength of heart and brain, and be the center of some\nwidespread catastrophe; to put his fear in her soul just as it was in\nhis own. How was she ever to comprehend the horror that held him in its\ncruel grasp, the thousand subtle shades of thought and feeling that had\nled up to this thing, from the memory of which he revolted! He turned\nhis bloodshot eyes upon her, something of the old light was there along\nwith the new; he had indeed loved her, but the fruit of this love had\nbeen rotten. He was silent, and again his heavy tread resounded in the\nroom as he dragged himself back and forth.\n\nThe force in him was stirring her. Sensation of any sort had always made\nits strong appeal to her. Without knowing what was passing in his mind\nshe yet understood that it was some powerful emotion, and her pliant\nnerves responded. For the moment she forgot that she no longer loved\nhim. She rose and went to his side.\n\n\"Is it all my fault, Marsh?\" she said.\n\n\"What is your fault?\" he asked, pausing.\n\n\"That we are so unhappy; am I the only one at fault there?\"\n\nHe looked down into her face relentingly.\n\n\"I don't know--I swear I don't know!\" he said hoarsely.\n\n\"What is it, Marsh--why are you so unhappy? Just because you love me?\nWhat an unkind thing to say!\"\n\nHe turned to the table to pour himself a drink, but she caught his hand.\n\n\"For my sake, Marsh!\" she entreated.\n\nAgain he looked down into her eyes.\n\n\"For my sake,\" she repeated softly.\n\n\"By God, I'll never touch another drop!\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, you make me so happy!\" she exclaimed.\n\nHe crushed her in his arms until his muscles were tense. She did not\nstruggle for release, but abandoned herself without a word to the\nemotion of the moment. Her head thrown back, her cheeks pale, her full\nlips smiling, she gazed up into his face with eyes burning with sudden\nfire.\n\n\"How I love you!\" he whispered.\n\nShe slipped her arms about his neck with a little cry of ecstasy.\n\n\"Oh, Marsh, I have been foolish, too, but this is the place for me--my\nplace--against your very heart!\" she said softly.\n\nFor a long minute Langham held her so, and then tortured by sudden\nmemory he came back sharply to the actualities. His arms dropped from\nabout her.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\" she asked.\n\nShe was not yet ready to pass from the passion of that moment.\n\n\"It's too late--\" he muttered brokenly.\n\n\"No, dear, it's not too late, we have only been a little foolish. Of\ncourse we can go back; of course we can begin all over, and we know now\nwhat to avoid; that was it, we didn't know before, we were ignorant of\nourselves--of each other. Why, don't you see, we are only just beginning\nto live, dear--you must have faith!\" and again her arms encircled him.\n\n\"But you don't know--\" he stammered.\n\n\"Don't know what, dear?\"\n\nHe dropped into his chair, and she sank on her knees at his side. A\nhorrible black abyss into which he was falling, seemed to open at his\nfeet. Her hands were the only ones that could draw him back and save\nhim.\n\n\"Don't know what?\" she repeated.\n\nThe mystery of his man's nature, with its mingled strength and weakness,\nwas something she could not resist.\n\n\"Does it ever do any good to pray, I wonder?\" he gasped.\n\n\"I wonder, too!\" she echoed breathlessly.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"What rot I'm talking!\" he said.\n\n\"What is it that is wrong, Marsh?\"\n\n\"Nothing--nothing--I can't tell you--\"\n\n\"You can tell me anything, I would always understand--always, dear.\nProve to me that our love is everything; take me back into your\nconfidence!\"\n\n\"No,\" he gasped hoarsely. \"I can't tell you--you'd hate me if I did;\nyou'd never forget--you couldn't!\"\n\nShe turned her eyes on him in breathless inquiry.\n\n\"I would--I promise you now! Marsh, I promise you, can't you believe--?\"\n\nHe shook his head and gazed somberly into her eyes. She rested her cheek\nagainst the back of his hand where it lay on the arm of his chair. There\nwas a long silence.\n\n\"But what is it, Marsh? What has happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing's happened,\" he said at last. \"I'm a bit worried, that's all,\nabout myself--my debts--my extravagance; isn't that enough to upset me?\nEvery one's crowding me!\"\n\nThere was another long pause. Evelyn sighed softly; she felt that they\nwere coming back too swiftly to the every-day concerns of life.\n\n\"I'm worried, too, about North!\" Langham said presently.\n\n\"About North--what about North?\"\n\n\"They are going to bring him back; didn't you know he had gone West? He\nwent last night.\"\n\n\"But _who_ is going to bring him back?\"\n\n\"They want him as a witness in the McBride case. They--Moxlow, that\nis--seems to think he knows something that may be of importance. He's a\ncrazy fool, with his notions!\"\n\n\"But North--\" Evelyn began.\n\n\"It may make a lot of trouble for him. They are going to bring him back\nas a witness, and unless he gives a pretty good account of himself,\nMoxlow's scheme is to try and hold him--\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a good account of himself?\"\n\n\"He'll, have to be able to tell just where he was between half past five\nand six o'clock last night; that's when the murder was committed,\naccording to Taylor.\"\n\n\"Do you mean he's suspected, Marsh? But he couldn't have done it!\" she\ncried.\n\n\"How do you know?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"Why, I was there--\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"With him--\"\n\n\"Here--was he here?\" A great load seemed lifted from him.\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"He was here between five and six?\" he repeated. He glanced at her\nsharply. \"Why don't you answer me?\"\n\n\"No, he was not here,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Where was he, then?\" he demanded. \"What's the secret, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Marsh, I'm going to tell you something,\" she said slowly. \"Nothing\nshall stand between our perfect understanding, our perfect trust for the\nfuture. You know I have been none too happy for the last year--I don't\nreproach you--but we had gotten very far apart somehow. I've never been\nreally bad--I've been your true and faithful wife, dear, always--always,\nbut--you had made me very unhappy--\" She felt him shiver. \"And I am not\na very wise or settled person--and we haven't any children to keep me\nsteady--\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" the man muttered hoarsely under his breath.\n\n\"What do you say?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing--go on; what is it you want to tell me?\"\n\n\"Something--and then perhaps you will trust me more fully with the\nthings that are oppressing you. I believe you love me, I believe it\nabsolutely--\" she paused.\n\nThe light died out of his eyes.\n\n\"Marsh,\" she began again. \"Could you forgive me if you knew that I'd\nthought I cared for some one else? Could you, if I told you that for a\nmoment I had the thought--the silly thought, that I cared for another\nman?\" She was conscious that his hand had grown cold beneath her cheek.\n\"It was just a foolish fancy, quite as innocent as it was foolish, dear;\nyou left me so much alone, and I thought you really didn't care for me\nany more, and so--and so--\"\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"Well, that is all, Marsh.\"\n\n\"All?\"\n\n\"Yes, it went no further than that, just a silly fancy, and I'd known\nhim all my life--\"\n\n\"Of whom are you speaking?\"\n\n\"Of John North--\"\n\n\"Damn him!\" he cried. \"And so that's what brought him here--and you were\nwith him last night!\" He sprang to his feet, his face livid. \"What do\nyou take me for? Do you expect me to forgive you for that--\"\n\n\"But Marsh, it was just a silly sentimental fancy! Oh, why did I tell\nyou!\"\n\n\"Yes, why _did_ you tell me!\" he stormed.\n\n\"Because I thought it would make it easier for you to confess to _me_--\"\n\n\"Confess to you? I've nothing to confess--I've loved you honestly! Did\nyou think I'd been carrying on some nasty sneaking intrigue with a\nfriend's wife--did you think I was that sort of a fellow--the sort of a\nfellow North is? Do you take me for a common blackguard?\"\n\n\"Marsh, don't! Marshall, please--for my sake--\" and she clung to him,\nbut he cast her off roughly.\n\n\"Keep away from me!\" he said with sullen repression, but there was a\nmurderous light in his eyes. \"Don't touch me!\" he warned.\n\n\"But say you forgive me!\"\n\n\"Forgive you--\" He laughed.\n\n\"Yes, forgive me--Marsh!\"\n\n\"Forgive you--no, by God!\"\n\nHe reached for the bottle.\n\n\"Not that--not that, Marsh; your promise only a moment ago--your\npromise, Marsh!\"\n\nBut he poured himself half a tumbler of whisky and emptied it at a\nswallow.\n\n\"To hell with my promise!\" he said, and strode from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nTHE FINGER OF SUSPICION\n\n\nIn Chicago Conklin found an angry young man at police headquarters, and\nthe name of this young man was John North.\n\n\"This is a most damnable outrage!\" he cried hotly the moment he espied\nMount Hope's burly sheriff.\n\n\"I am mighty sorry to have interfered with your plans, John--just mighty\nsorry.\" The sheriff's tone was meant to soothe and conciliate. \"But you\nsee we are counting on you to throw some light on the McBride murder.\"\n\n\"So that's it! I tell you, Conklin, I consider that I have been treated\nwith utter discourtesy; I've been a virtual prisoner here over night!\"\n\n\"That's too bad, John,\" said the sheriff sympathetically, \"but we didn't\nknow where a wire would reach you, so there didn't seem any other way\nthan this--\"\n\n\"Well, what do you want with me?\" demanded North, with rather less heat\nthan had marked his previous speech.\n\n\"They got the idea back home that you can help in the McBride matter,\"\nexplained the sheriff again. \"I see that you know he's been murdered.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew that before I left Mount Hope,\" rejoined North.\n\n\"Did you, though?\" said the sheriff briefly, and this admission of\nNorth's appeared to furnish him with food for reflection.\n\n\"Well, what do I know that will be of use to you?\" asked North\nimpatiently.\n\n\"You ain't to make any statement to me, John,\" returned the sheriff\nhastily.\n\n\"Do you mean you expect me to go back to Mount Hope?\" inquired North in\na tone of mingled wonder and exasperation.\n\nThe sheriff nodded.\n\n\"That's the idea, John,\" he said placidly.\n\n\"What if I refuse to go back?\"\n\nThe sheriff looked pained.\n\n\"Oh, you won't do that--what's the use?\"\n\n\"Do you mean--\" began North savagely, but Conklin interposed.\n\n\"Never mind what I mean, that's a good fellow; say you'll take the next\ntrain back with me; it will save a lot of, bother!\"\n\n\"But I strongly object to return to Mount Hope!\" said North.\n\n\"Be reasonable--\" urged the sheriff.\n\n\"This is an infernal outrage!\" cried North.\n\n\"I'm sorry, John, but make it easy for me, make it easy for yourself;\nwe'll have a nice friendly trip and you will be back here by the first\nof the week.\"\n\nFor a moment North hesitated. He had so many excellent reasons why he\ndid not wish to return to Mount Hope, but he knew that there was\nsomething back of Mr. Conklin's mild eye and yet milder speech.\n\n\"Well, John?\" prompted the sheriff encouragingly.\n\n\"I suppose I'll go with you,\" said North grudgingly.\n\n\"Of course you will,\" agreed the sheriff.\n\nHe had never entertained any doubts on this point.\n\nIt was ten o'clock Saturday morning when North and the sheriff left the\neast-bound express at Mount Hope and climbed into the bus that was\nwaiting for them.\n\nNorth's annoyance had given place to a certain humorous appreciation of\nthe situation. His plans had gone far astray in the past forty-eight\nhours, and here he was back in Mount Hope. Decidedly his return, in the\nlight of his parting with Elizabeth, was somewhat in the nature of an\nanticlimax.\n\nThey were driven at once to the court-house. There in his office they\nfound Moxlow with the coroner and North was instantly aware of restraint\nin the manner of each as they greeted him, for which he could not\naccount.\n\n\"Sit down, North,\" said Moxlow, indicating a chair.\n\n\"Now what is it?\" North spoke pleasantly as he took his seat. \"I've been\ncursing you two all the way home from Chicago.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you were subjected to any annoyance in the matter, but it\ncouldn't be helped,\" said Moxlow.\n\n\"I'm getting over my temper,\" replied North. \"Fire away with your\nquestions!\"\n\nThe prosecuting attorney glanced at his fellow official.\n\n\"You are already acquainted with the particulars of the shocking tragedy\nthat has occurred here?\" said Taylor with ponderous dignity.\n\n\"Yes,\" said North soberly. \"And when I think of it, I am more than\nwilling to help you in your search for the guilty man.\"\n\n\"You knew of the murder before you left town?\" remarked Moxlow casually.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But you weren't on the Square or in the store Thanksgiving night?\" said\nMoxlow.\n\n\"No, I dined with General Herbert.\" The prosecuting attorney elevated\nhis eyebrows. \"I must have been on my way there when the crime was\ndiscovered; I was returning home perhaps a little after eleven when I\nmet a man who stopped me to tell me of the murder--\"\n\n\"You were with Mr. McBride Thanksgiving afternoon, were you not?\" Moxlow\nnow asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What was the hour, can you state?\"\n\n\"About half past four, I should say; certainly no later than that. I\nwent there on a matter of business, to dispose of some bonds Mr.\nMcBride had agreed to take off my hands; I was with him, maybe twenty\nminutes.\"\n\n\"What were those bonds?\"\n\n\"Local gas bonds.\"\n\n\"How many were there in the lot you sold?\"\n\n\"Five.\"\n\n\"He paid you the money for them?\"\n\n\"Yes, a thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Do you know, we haven't unearthed those bonds yet?\" said the doctor.\n\nMoxlow frowned slightly.\n\n\"I suppose they were taken,\" said North.\n\n\"But it will be a dangerous thing, to attempt to realize on them,\"\nsnapped Moxlow.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" agreed North.\n\n\"You left McBride's store at, say, five o'clock?\" said Moxlow.\n\n\"Not later than that--see here, Moxlow, what are you driving at?\"\ndemanded North, with some show of temper.\n\nFor an instant Moxlow hesitated, then he said:\n\n\"The truth is, North, there is not a clue to go on, and we are thrashing\nthis thing over in the hope that we may sooner or later hit on something\nthat will be of service to us.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" said North, with a return of good nature.\n\n\"During your interview with McBride you were not interrupted, no one\ncame into the store?\"\n\n\"No one; we were alone the entire time.\"\n\n\"And you saw no one hanging about the place as you left it?\"\n\n\"Not that I can remember; if I did it made no impression on me.\"\n\n\"But didn't you see Shrimplin?\" asked Moxlow quickly.\n\n\"Oh, come, Moxlow, you can't play the sleuth,--that was afterward, you\nknow it was!\"\n\n\"Afterward--\"\n\n\"Yes, just as I was starting for the general's place, fully an hour\nlater.\"\n\n\"In the meantime you had been where--\"\n\n\"From McBride's store I went to my rooms. I remained there until it was\ntime to start for the Herberts', and as I intended to walk out I started\nearlier than I otherwise should have done.\"\n\n\"Then you were coming from your rooms when you met Shrimplin?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was just six o'clock when I stopped to speak to him.\"\n\n\"Shrimplin was the only person you met as you crossed the Square?\"\n\n\"As far as I can remember now, I saw no one but Shrimp.\"\n\n\"And just where did you meet him, North?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"On the corner, near McBride's store.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether he had just driven into the Square or not?\"\n\n\"No, I, don't know that; it was snowing hard and I came upon him\nsuddenly.\"\n\n\"You continued on your way out of town after speaking with him, North?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And later, at eleven o'clock, as you were returning to town you met a\nstranger, probably a countryman, you say, who told you that McBride had\nbeen murdered?\"\n\n\"Yes, you have that all straight.\"\n\n\"On your return to town you went where?\"\n\n\"To my rooms again and finished packing.\"\n\n\"Did that take you two hours?\"\n\n\"No, but I had a lot of things to see to there.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"Oh, papers to destroy, and things of that sort that kept me pretty busy\nuntil train-time.\"\n\n\"You walked to the depot?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was too late for the hotel bus; in fact, I barely caught the\ntrain. I just had time to jump aboard as it pulled out.\"\n\n\"Excuse me a moment, North!\" said Moxlow as he rose from his chair.\n\nHe quitted the room and North heard him pass down the hall.\n\n\"It's a bad business,\" said Taylor.\n\n\"And you haven't a suspicion as to the guilty man?\"\n\n\"No, as Moxlow says, we haven't a clue to go on. It's incredible though,\nisn't it, that a crime like that could have been committed here almost\nin broad daylight, and its perpetrator get away without leaving a trace\nbehind?\"\n\n\"It _is_ incredible,\" agreed North, and they lapsed into silence.\n\nNorth thought of Elizabeth. He would slip out to Idle Hour that\nafternoon or evening; he couldn't leave Mount Hope without seeing her.\nThe coroner drummed on his desk; he wondered what had taken Moxlow from\nthe room in such haste. The prosecuting attorney's brisk step sounded in\nthe hall again, and he re\u00c3\u00abntered the room and resumed his chair.\n\n\"Just one or two more questions, North, and then I guess we'll have to\nlet you go,\" he said. \"You have been on very friendly terms with the\nmurdered man for some time, have you not?\"\n\n\"He was very kind to me on numerous occasions.\"\n\n\"In a business way, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Largely in a business way, yes.\"\n\n\"It--pardon me--usually had to do with raising money, had it not?\"\n\nNorth laughed.\n\n\"It had.\"\n\n\"You were familiar with certain little peculiarities of his, were you\nnot, his mistrust of banks for instance?\"\n\n\"Yes, he had very little confidence in banks, judging from what he said\nof them.\"\n\n\"Did he ever tell you that he had large sums of money hidden away about\nthe store?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"But always when you had business dealings with him he gave you the\nready money, very rarely a check?\"\n\n\"Never in all my experience a check, always the cash.\"\n\n\"Yet the sums involved were usually considerable?\"\n\n\"In one or two instances they reached a thousand dollars, if you call\nthat considerable.\"\n\n\"And he always had the money on hand?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't quite say that; it always involved a preliminary\ndiscussion of the transaction; I had to see him and tell him what I\nwanted and then go again after the money. It was as if he wished me to\nthink he did not keep any large sum about him at the store.\"\n\n\"Did he ever, in talking with you, express any apprehension of robbery\nor violence?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\n\"You had spoken to him about those bonds before?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monday I saw him and asked him if he would take them off my hand.\"\n\n\"And he gave you to understand that if you would wait a day or two he\nwould buy the bonds.\"\n\nNorth nodded.\n\n\"Hadn't you learned prior to going to the store that McBride had just\nreceived three thousand dollars in cash from Atkinson?\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew that,--Langham told me.\"\n\n\"So that it is reasonable to suppose that McBride had at least four\nthousand dollars in his safe Thursday afternoon.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is, but I saw only the thousand he paid me for the bonds.\"\n\n\"That came from the safe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I guess that's all for the present, North.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you shall want to see me again?\" asked North, rising.\n\n\"Yes, you won't leave town to-day; the inquest is to be held this\nafternoon, you will probably be wanted then, so hold yourself in\nreadiness.\"\n\n\"I hope you will arrange to get through with me as soon as possible,\nMoxlow!\"\n\n\"We won't put you to any unnecessary inconvenience if we can help it,\"\nreturned Moxlow, with a queer cold smile.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said North and quitted the room.\n\nHe sauntered out into the street; he was disposed to consider Mr. Moxlow\nas something of a fool, as a rank amateur in the present crisis. He\nturned into the Square and halted for an instant before the dingy store\nthat had been the scene of the recent tragedy. People on the street\npaused when they had passed and turned to stare after him, but North was\nunaware of this, as he was unaware that his name had come to be the one\nmost frequently mentioned in connection with the McBride murder.\nSuddenly he quickened his step; just ahead of him was Marshall Langham.\n\n\"Hello, Marsh!\" he said, and stepped eagerly forward with extended hand.\n\nThe lawyer paused irresolutely and turned on him a bloated face, but\nthere was no welcome in the sullen glance.\n\n\"Marsh--\"\n\nLangham's lips twitched and an angry murmur came from them, but the\nwords were indistinct.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asked North, falling back a step in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes, what's wrong!\" said Langham in a hoarse whisper. \"Hell! You have\nnerve to stick out your hand to me--you have bigger nerve to ask me\nthat,--get out of my way!\" and he pushed past North and strode down the\nstreet without a single backward glance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nJOE TELLS HIS STORY\n\n\nThe inquest was held late Saturday afternoon in the bleak living-room of\nthe McBride house. The coroner had explained the manner in which the\nmurdered man had come to his death, and as he finished he turned to\nMoxlow. The prosecuting attorney shifted his position slightly, thrust\nout his long legs toward the wood-stove, and buried his hands deep in\nhis trousers pockets, then he addressed the jury.\n\nThey were there, he told them, to listen to certain facts that bore on\nthe death of Archibald McBride. If, after hearing these facts, they\ncould say they pointed to any person or persons as being implicated in\nthe murder, they were to name the person or persons, and he would see\nthat they were brought before the grand jury for indictment. They were\nto bear in mind, however, that no one was on trial, and that no one was\naccused of the crime about to be investigated, yet they must not forget\nthat a cold-blooded murder had been committed; human hands had raised\nthe weapon that had crushed out the life of the old merchant, human\nintelligence had made choice of the day and hour and moment for that\nbrutal deed; the possibility of escape had been nicely calculated,\nnothing had been left to chance. He would venture the assertion that if\nthe murderer were ever found he would prove to be no ordinary criminal.\n\nAll this Moxlow said with judicial deliberation and with the lawyer's\ncareful qualifying of word and phrase.\n\nShrimplin was the first witness. He described in his own fashion the\nfinding of Archibald McBride's body. Then a few skilful questions by\nMoxlow brought out the fact of his having met John North on the Square\nimmediately before his own gruesome discovery. The little lamplighter\nwas excused, and Colonel Harbison took his: place. He, in his turn,\nquickly made way for Andy Gilmore. Moxlow next interrogated Atkinson,\nLangham's client, who explained the nature of his business relations\nwith McBride which had terminated in the payment of three thousand\ndollars to him on Thanksgiving afternoon, the twenty-seventh of\nNovember.\n\n\"You are excused, Mr. Atkinson,\" said Moxlow.\n\nFor an instant his eyes roved over the room; they settled on Marshall\nLangham, who stood near the door leading into the hall. By a gesture he\nmotioned him to the chair Atkinson had vacated.\n\nLangham's testimony was identical with that which he had already given\nin the informal talk at Moxlow's office; he told of having called on\nArchibald McBride with his client and, urged on by Moxlow, described\nhis subsequent conversation with North.\n\nUp to this point John North had felt only an impersonal interest in the\nproceedings, but now it flashed across him that Moxlow was seeking to\ndirect suspicion toward him. How well the prosecuting attorney was\nsucceeding was apparent. North realized that he had suddenly become the\nmost conspicuous person in the room; whichever way he turned he met the\ncurious gaze of his townsmen, and each pair of eyes seemed to hold some\nportentous question. As if oblivious of this he bent forward in his\nchair and followed Moxlow's questions and Langham's replies with the\nclosest attention. And as he watched Langham, so Gilmore watched him.\n\n\"That will do, Mr. Langham. Thank you,\" said Moxlow at last.\n\nNorth felt sure he would be the next witness, and he was not mistaken.\nMoxlow's examination, however, was along lines quite different from\nthose he had anticipated. The prosecuting attorney's questions wholly\nconcerned themselves with the sale of the gas bonds to McBride; each\ndetail of that transaction was gone into, but a very positive sense of\nrelief had come to North. This was not what he had expected and dreaded,\nand he answered Moxlow's queries frankly, eagerly, for where his\nrelations with the old merchant were under discussion he had nothing to\nhide. Finally Moxlow turned from him with a characteristic gesture.\n\n\"That's all,\" he said.\n\nAgain his glance wandered over the room. It became fixed on a grayish\nmiddle-aged man seated at Gilmore's elbow.\n\n\"Thomas Nelson,\" he called.\n\nThis instantly revived North's apprehensions. Nelson was the janitor of\nthe building in which he had roomed. He asked himself what could be\nMoxlow's purpose in examining him.\n\nThere was just one thing North feared, and that--the bringing of Evelyn\nLangham's name into the case. How this could happen he did not see, but\nthe law dug its own channels and sometimes they went far enough afield.\nWhile this was passing through his mind, Nelson was sworn and Moxlow\nbegan his examination.\n\nMr. Nelson was in charge of the building on the corner of Main Street\nand the Square,--he referred to the brick building on the southeast\ncorner? The witness answered in the affirmative, and Moxlow's next\nquestion brought out the fact that for some weeks the building had had\nonly two tenants; John North and Andrew Gilmore.\n\nWhat was the exact nature of his duties? The witness could hardly say;\nhe was something of a carpenter for one thing, and at the present time\nwas making certain repairs in the vacant store-room on the ground floor.\nDid he take care of the entrance and the two halls? Yes. Had he\nanything to do with the rooms of the two tenants on the first floor?\nYes. What?\n\nSometimes he swept and dusted them and he was supposed to look after the\nfires. He carried up the coal, Moxlow suggested? Yes. He carried out the\nashes? Again yes. Moxlow paused for a moment. Was he the only person who\never carried out the ashes? Yes. What did he do with the ashes? He\nemptied them into a barrel that stood in the yard back of the building.\nAnd what became of them then? Whenever necessary, the barrel was carted\naway and emptied. How long did it usually take to fill the barrel? At\nthis season of the year one or two weeks. When was it emptied last? A\nweek ago, perhaps, the witness was not quite sure about the day, but it\nwas either Monday or Tuesday of the preceding week. And how often did\nthe ashes from the fireplaces in Mr. North's and Mr. Gilmore's rooms\nfind their way into the barrel? Every morning he cleaned out the grates\nthe first thing, and usually before Mr. North or Mr. Gilmore were up.\n\nAgain Moxlow paused and glanced over the room. He must have been aware\nthat to his eager audience the connection between Mr. North's and Mr.\nGilmore's fireplaces and the McBride murder, was anything but clear.\n\n\"Did you empty the ashes from the fireplaces in the apartments occupied\nby Mr. North and Mr. Gilmore on Friday morning?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes; that is, I took up the ashes in Mr. North's rooms.\"\n\n\"But not in Mr. Gilmore's?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I didn't go into his rooms Friday morning.\"\n\n\"Why was that,--was there any reason for it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew that Mr. Gilmore's rooms had not been occupied Thursday\nnight; that was the night of the murder, and he was at McBride's house,\"\nexplained the witness.\n\n\"But you emptied the grate in Mr. North's rooms?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And disposed of the ashes in the usual way?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In the barrel in the yard back of the building?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything peculiar about the ashes from Mr. North's rooms\non Friday morning?\"\n\nThe witness looked puzzled.\n\n\"Hadn't Mr. North burnt a good many papers in his grate?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, but then he was going away.\"\n\n\"That will do,--you are excused,\" interposed Moxlow quickly.\n\nThe sheriff was next sworn. Without interruption from Moxlow he told his\nstory. He had made a thorough search of the ash barrel described by the\nwitness Thomas Nelson, and had come upon a number of charred fragments\nof paper.\n\n\"We think these may be of interest to the coroner's jury,\" said Moxlow\nquietly.\n\nHe drew a small pasteboard box from an inner pocket of his coat and\ncarefully arranged its contents on the table before him. In all there\nwere half a dozen scraps of charred or torn paper displayed; one or two\nof these fragments were bits of envelopes on which either a part or all\nof the name was still decipherable. North, from where he sat, was able\nto recognize a number of these as letters which he had intended to\ndestroy that last night in his rooms; but the refuse from his grate and\nthe McBride murder still seemed poles apart; he could imagine no\npossible connection.\n\nThe president of Mount Hope's first national bank was the next witness\ncalled. He was asked by Moxlow to examine a Mount Hope Gas Company bond,\nand then the prosecuting attorney placed in his hands a triangular piece\nof paper which he selected from among the other fragments on the table.\n\n\"Mr. Harden, will you kindly tell the jury of what, in your opinion,\nthat bit of paper in your hand was once a part?\" said Moxlow.\n\nVery deliberately the banker put on his glasses, and then with equal\ndeliberation began a careful examination of the scrap of paper.\n\n\"Well?\" said Moxlow.\n\n\"A second, please!\" said the banker.\n\nBut the seconds grew into minutes before he was ready to risk an\nopinion.\n\n\"We are waiting on you, Mr. Harden,\" said Moxlow at length.\n\n\"I should say that this is a marginal fragment of a Gas Company bond,\"\nsaid the banker slowly. \"Indeed there can be no doubt on the point. The\npaper is the same, and these lines in red ink are a part of the\ndecoration that surrounds the printed matter. No,--there is no doubt in\nmy mind as to what this paper is.\"\n\n\"What part of the bond is it?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"The lower right-hand corner,\" replied the banker promptly. \"That is why\nI hesitated to identify it; with this much of the upper left-hand corner\nfor instance, I should not have been in doubt.\"\n\n\"Excused,\" said Moxlow briefly.\n\nThe room became blank before John North's eyes as he realized that a\nchain of circumstantial evidence was connecting him with the McBride\nmurder. He glanced about at a score of men--witnesses, officials, and\njury, and felt their sudden doubt of him, as intangibly but as certainly\nas he felt the dead presence just beyond the closed door.\n\n\"We have one other witness,\" said Moxlow.\n\nAnd Joe Montgomery, seeming to understand that he was this witness,\npromptly quitted his chair at the back of the room and, cap in hand,\nslouched forward and was duly sworn by the coroner.\n\nIf Mr. Montgomery had shown promptness he had also evinced uneasiness,\nsince his fear of the law was as rock-ribbed as his respect for it. He\nwas not unfamiliar with courts, though never before had he appeared in\nthe character of a witness; and he had told himself many times that day\nthat the business in which he had allowed Mr. Gilmore to involve him\ncarried him far behind his depths. Now his small blue eyes slid round in\ntheir sockets somewhat fearfully until they rested on Mr. Gilmore, who\nhad just taken up his position at Marshall Langham's elbow. The gambler\nfrowned and the handy-man instantly shifted his gaze. But the\nprosecuting attorney's first questions served to give Joe a measure of\nease; this was transitory, however, as he seemed to stand alone in the\npresence of some imminent personal danger when Moxlow asked:\n\n\"Where were you on the night of the twenty-seventh of November at six\no'clock?\"\n\nJoe stole a haunted glance in the direction of Gilmore. Moxlow repeated\nhis question.\n\n\"Boss, I was in White's woodshed,\" answered Montgomery.\n\n\"Tell the jury what you saw,\" said Moxlow.\n\n\"Well, I seen a good deal,\" evaded the handy-man, shaking his great\nhead.\n\n\"Go on!\" urged Moxlow impatiently.\n\n\"It was this way,\" said Joe. \"I was lookin' out into the alley through a\ncrack in the small door where they put in the coal; right across the\nalley is the back of McBride's store and the sheds about his yard--\"\nthe handy-man paused and mopped his face with his ragged cap.\n\nAt the opposite end of the room Gilmore placed a hand on Langham's arm.\nThe lawyer had uttered a smothered exclamation and had made a movement\nas if about to quit his seat. The gambler pushed him back.\n\n\"Sit tight, Marsh!\" he muttered between his teeth.\n\nMr. Montgomery, taking stock of his courage, prepared to adventure\nfurther with his testimony.\n\n\"All at once as I stood by that door lookin' out into the alley, I heard\na kind of noise in old man McBride's yard. It sounded like something\nheavy was bein' scraped across the frozen ground, say a box or barrel.\nThen I seen a man's derby hat come over the edge of the shed, and next\nthe man who was under that hat drawed himself up; he come up slow and\ncautious until he was where he could throw himself over on to the roof.\nHe done that, squatted low, and slid down the roof toward the alley.\nThere was some snow and he slid easy. He was lookin' about all the time\nlike he wasn't anxious to be seen. Well, boss, he never seen me, and he\nnever seen no one else, so he dropped off, kind of givin' himself a\nshove out from the eaves, and fetched up against White's woodshed. He\nwas pantin' like he'd run a mile, and I heard him say in a whisper, 'Oh,\nmy God!'--just like that,--'Oh, my God!'\" The handy-man paused with this\ngrotesque mimicry of terror.\n\n\"And then?\" prompted Moxlow, in the breathless silence.\n\n\"And then he took off up the alley as if all hell was whoopin' after\nhim!\"\n\nAgain Montgomery's ragged cap served him in lieu of a handkerchief, and\nas he swabbed his blotched and purple face he shot a swift furtive\nglance in Gilmore's direction. So far he had told only the truth, but he\nwas living in terror of Moxlow's next question.\n\n\"Can you describe the man who crossed the roof,--for instance, how was\nhe dressed?\" said Moxlow, with slow deliberation.\n\n\"He had on a derby hat and a dark overcoat,\" answered Montgomery after a\nmoment's pause.\n\nHe was speaking for Gilmore now, and his grimy lists closed convulsively\nabout the arms of his chair.\n\n\"Did you see his face?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"Yes--\" the monosyllable was spoken unwillingly, but with a kind of\ndogged resolution.\n\n\"Was it a face you knew?\"\n\nMontgomery looked at Gilmore, whose fierce insistent glance was bent\ncompellingly on him. The recollection of the gambler's threats and\npromises flashed through his mind.\n\n\"Was it a face you knew?\" repeated Moxlow.\n\nThe handy-man gave him a sudden glare.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in a throaty whisper.\n\n\"How could you tell in the dark?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Then I seen a man's derby hat come over the edge of the\nshed.\"]\n\n\"It wasn't so terrible dark, with the snow on the ground. And I was\nso close to him I could have put an apple in his pocket,\" Joe explained.\n\n\"Who was the man?\" asked Moxlow.\n\n\"I thought he looked like John North,\" said Montgomery.\n\nThere was the silence of death in the room.\n\n\"You thought it was John North?\" began Moxlow.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When he spoke, you thought you recognized North's voice?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Were you sure?\"\n\n\"I was pretty sure, boss--\"\n\n\"Only pretty sure?\"\n\n\"I thought it was Mr. North,--it looked like Mr. North, and I thought it\nwas him,--I thought so then and I think so now,\" said Montgomery\ndesperately.\n\n\"Are you willing to swear positively that it was John North?\" demanded\nMoxlow.\n\n\"No--\" said the handy-man, \"No,--I only say I thought it was John North.\nHe looked like John North, and I thought it was John North,--I'd have\nsaid it was John North, but it all happened in a minute. I wasn't\nthinkin' I'd ever have to say who it was I seen on the shed!\"\n\n\"But your first distinct impression was that it was John North?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have known John North for years?\"\n\n\"All his life.\"\n\n\"Had you seen him recently?\"\n\n\"I seen him Thanksgiving day along about four o'clock crossing the\nSquare.\"\n\n\"How was he dressed, did you notice?\"\n\n\"He was dressed like the man in the alley,--he had on a black derby hat\nand a dark brown overcoat.\"\n\n\"That's all,\" said Moxlow quietly.\n\nThe coroner and the jury drew aside and began a whispered consultation.\nIn the vitiated atmosphere of that overcrowded room, heavy as it was\nwith the stifling heat and palpably dense with the escaping smoke from\nthe cracked wood-stove, men coughed nervously with every breath they\ndrew, but their sense of physical discomfort was unheeded in their tense\ninterest in the developments of the last few moments. The jury's\ndeliberation was brief and then the coroner announced its verdict.\n\nNorth heard the doctor's halting words without at once grasping their\nmeaning. A long moment of silence followed, and then a man coughed, and\nthen another, and another; this seemed to break the spell, for suddenly\nthe room buzzed with eager whisperings.\n\nNorth's first definite emotion was one of intense astonishment. Were\nthey mad? But the faces turned toward him expressed nothing beyond\ncuriosity. His glance shifted to the official group by the table. These\ngood-natured commonplace men who, whether they liked him or not, had\ninvariably had a pleasant word for him, instantly took on an air of grim\naloofness. Conklin, the fat jolly sheriff; the coroner; Moxlow, the\nprosecuting attorney in his baggy trousers and seam-shining coat,--why,\nhe had known these men all his life, he had met them daily,--what did\nthey mean by suspecting him! The mere suspicion was a monstrous wrong!\nHis face reddened; he glanced about him haughtily.\n\nNow at a sign from the coroner, Conklin placed his fat hands on the arms\nof his chair and slowly drew himself out of its depths, then he crossed\nto North. The young fellow rose, and turned a pale face toward him.\n\n\"John,\" said the sheriff gently, \"I have an unpleasant duty to perform.\"\n\nIn spite of himself the pallor deepened on North's face.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said in a voice that was low and none too steady.\n\nDuring this scene Moxlow's glance had been centered on North in a fixed\nstare of impersonal curiosity, now he turned with quick nervous decision\nand snatching up his shabby hat from the table, left the room.\n\nLangham had preceded him by a few moments, escaping unobserved when\nthere were eyes only for North.\n\n\"I am ready, Conklin.\"\n\nAnd a moment later North and the sheriff passed out into the twilight.\nNeither spoke until they came to the court-house Square.\n\n\"We'll go in this way, John!\" said the sheriff in a tone that was meant\nto be encouraging, but failed.\n\nThey ascended the court-house steps, and went down the long corridor to\nthe rear of the building. Here they passed out through wide doors and\ninto a narrow yard that separated the court-house from the jail.\nCrossing this sandy strip they entered the sheriff's office. Conklin\npaused; North gazed at him inquiringly.\n\n\"It's too bad, John,\" said the sheriff.\n\nThen without further words he led North to a door opposite that by which\nthey had entered. It opened on a long brick-paved passageway, at the end\nof which was a flight of narrow stairs. Ascending these North found\nhimself in another long hall. Conklin paused before the first of three\ndoors on the right and pushed it open.\n\n\"I guess this will do, John!\" he said.\n\nNorth stepped quickly in and glanced about him. The room held an iron\nbedstead, a wooden chair and, by the window which overlooked the jail\nyard and an alley beyond, a wash-stand with a tin basin and pitcher.\n\n\"Say, ain't you going to see a lawyer?\" asked the sheriff. \"He may be\nable to get you out of this, you can't tell--\"\n\n\"Can you send a message to young Watt Harbison for me?\" interrupted\nNorth.\n\n\"Certainly, but you don't call him much of a lawyer, do you? I tell you,\nJohn, you want a _good_ lawyer; what's the matter with Marsh Langham?\"\n\n\"Watt will do for the present. He can tell me the one or two things I\nneed to know now,\" rejoined North indifferently.\n\n\"All right, I'll send for him then.\"\n\nThe sheriff quitted the room, closing and locking the door after him.\nNorth heard his footsteps die out in the long passage. At last he was\nalone! He threw himself down on the cot for manhood seemed to forsake\nhim.\n\n\"My God,--Elizabeth--\" he groaned and buried his face in his hands.\n\nThe law had lifted a sinister finger and leveled it at him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nLIGHT IN DARKNESS\n\n\nThe expression on General Herbert's face was one of mingled doubt and\nimpatience.\n\n\"You must be mistaken, Thompson!\" he was saying to his foreman, who had,\nwith the coming of night, returned from an errand in town.\n\n\"General, there's no mistake; every one was talking about it! Looks like\nthe police had something to go on, too--\"\n\nHe hesitated, suddenly remembering that John North had been a frequent\nguest at Idle Hour.\n\n\"I had heard that Mr. North was wanted as a witness,\" observed the\ngeneral.\n\n\"No, they say Moxlow had his eye on him from the start!\" rejoined the\nforeman with repressed enthusiasm for Moxlow.\n\nThe general sensed the enthusiasm and was affected unpleasantly by it.\n\n\"It would be a great pity if Mr. Moxlow should be so unfortunate as to\nmake a fool of himself!\" he commented with unusual acidity. \"What else\ndid you hear?\"\n\n\"Not much, General, only just what I've told you--that they've arrested\nNorth, and that young Watt Harbison's been trying to get him out on\nbail, but they've refused to accept bond in his case. Don't that look\nlike they thought the evidence was pretty strong against him--\"\n\n\"Well, they, might have arrested you or me,\" said the general. \"That\nsignifies nothing.\"\n\nHe moved off in the direction of the house, and Thompson, after a\nbackward glance at his retreating figure, entered the barn. Out of sight\nof his foreman, the general's sturdy pace lagged. That young man had\nbeen at Idle Hour entirely too often; he had thought so all along, and\nnow he was very sure of it!\n\n\"This comes of being too kind,\" he muttered.\n\nThen he paused suddenly--but no, that was absurd--utterly absurd;\nElizabeth would have told him! He was certain of this, for had she not\ntold him all her secrets? But suppose--suppose--and again he put the\nidea from him.\n\nHe found Elizabeth in the small, daintily furnished sitting-room which\nMrs. Herbert had called her \"boudoir\", and seated himself, none too\ngently, in a fragile gilt chair which his bulk of bone and muscle\nthreatened to wreck. Elizabeth glanced up from _Their Wedding Journey_,\nwhich she was reading for the second time.\n\n\"What is it, father?\" she asked, for his feeling of doubt and annoyance\nwas plainly shown in his expressive face.\n\n\"Thompson has just come out from town--he says that John North has been\narrested for the McBride murder--\"\n\nThe book slipped from Elizabeth's hand and fell to the floor; the smile\nwith which she had welcomed her father faded from her lips; she gazed at\nhim with pale face and wide eyes. The general instantly regretted that\nhe had spoken with such cruel abruptness.\n\n\"You don't think it is true?\" she asked in a whisper.\n\n\"Thompson seemed to know what he was talking about.\"\n\n\"It's monstrous!\" she cried.\n\n\"If North is innocent--\" began the general.\n\n\"Father!\" She regarded him with a look of horror and astonishment. \"You\ndon't like him! It's that, isn't it?\" she added after a moment's\nsilence.\n\n\"I don't like any one who gets into a scrape such as this!\" replied the\ngeneral with miserable and unnecessary heat.\n\n\"But it wasn't _his_ fault--he couldn't help it!\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he could,\" replied her father grimly.\n\nShe rose and came close to his side.\n\n\"Father!\" she said in a tone of entreaty, placing a hand on his arm.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\"\n\nThere was both tenderness and concern in his keen gray eyes as he\nglanced up into her troubled face.\n\n\"I want you to go to him--to Mr. North, I mean. I want you to tell him\nhow sorry you are; I want him to know--I--\" she paused uncertainly.\n\nPerhaps for the first time in her life she was not quite sure of her\nfather's sympathy. She dreaded his man's judgment in this crisis.\n\n\"Now seriously, Elizabeth, don't you think I'd better keep away from\nhim? I can do nothing--\"\n\n\"Oh, how cowardly that would be!\" she cried. \"How cowardly!\"\n\nThe old general winced at this. He was far from being a coward, but\nappearances had their value in his eyes; and even, in its least serious\naspect, young North's predicament was not pleasant to contemplate.\n\n\"But there is nothing I can do, Elizabeth; why should I become\ninvolved?\" he urged.\n\n\"Then you must go to him from me!\" she cried.\n\n\"Child--child; what are you saying!\" cried the general.\n\n\"Either you must go to him, or I shall go!\" she said with fine firmness.\n\nHer father groaned.\n\n\"Be frank with me, Elizabeth. Has North ever told you that he cared for\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Before he went away--I mean that last night he was here.\"\n\n\"I feared as much!\" he muttered. \"And you, dear?\" he continued gently.\n\n\"He said we might have to wait a long time--or I should have told you!\nHe went away because he was too poor--\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Do you care for him, Elizabeth?\" her father asked at length. \"Do you\nwish me to understand that you are committed--are--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered quite simply.\n\n\"You are sure it is not just pity--you are sure, Elizabeth? For you\nknow, right or wrong, he will probably come out of this with his\nreputation smirched.\"\n\n\"But he is _innocent_!\"\n\n\"That is not quite the point!\" urged the general. \"We must see things as\nthey are. You must understand what it may mean to you in the future, to\nhave given your love to a man who has fallen under such suspicion. There\nwill always be those who will remember this against him.\"\n\n\"But _I_ shall know!\" she said proudly.\n\n\"And that will be enough--you will ask no more than that, Elizabeth?\"\n\n\"If my faith in him has never been shaken, could I ask more?\"\n\nHe looked at her wistfully. Her courage he comprehended. It was fine and\ntrue, like her sweet unspoiled youth; in its presence he felt a sudden\nsense of age and loneliness. He asked himself, had he lived beyond his\nown period of generous enthusiasm?\n\n\"It would be a poor kind of friendship, a poorer kind of love, if we did\nnot let him know at once that this has not changed our--our, regard for\nhim!\" she said softly.\n\n\"It is not your ready sympathy; you are quite certain it is not that,\nElizabeth?\"\n\n\"I am sure, father--sure of myself as I am of him! You say he has been\narrested, does that mean--\" and she hesitated.\n\n\"It means, my dear, that he is in jail,\" answered the general as he came\nslowly to his feet.\n\nShe gave a little cry, and running to him hid her face against his arm.\n\n\"In jail!\" she moaned, and her imagination and her ignorance clothed the\nthought with indescribable horrors.\n\n\"Understand, dear, he isn't even indicted yet and he may not be! It's\nbad enough, of course, but it might be a great deal worse. Now what am I\nto tell him for you?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, slipping from his side. \"I will write him--\"\n\n\"Write your letter then,\" said her father. \"I'll order the horses at\nonce,\" he added, as he quitted the room.\n\nTen minutes later when he drove up from the stables, Elizabeth met him\nat the door.\n\n\"After you have seen him, father, come home at once, won't you?\" she\nsaid as she handed him her letter.\n\n\"Yes, I am only going for this,\" he replied.\n\nIt was plain that his errand had not grown less distasteful to him.\nPerhaps Elizabeth was aware of this, for she reached up and passed an\narm about his neck.\n\n\"I don't believe any girl ever had such a father!\" she whispered softly.\n\n\"I suppose I should not be susceptible to such manifest flattery,\" said\nthe general, kissing her, \"but I find I am! There, you keep up your\ncourage! This old father of yours is a person of such excellent sense\nthat he is going to aid and abet you in this most outrageous folly; I\nexpect, even, that in time, my interest in this very foolish young man\nwill be only second to your own, my dear!\"\n\nAs he drove away he turned in his seat to glance back at the graceful\ngirlish figure standing in the shelter of Idle Hour's stone arched\nvestibule, and as he did so there was a flutter of something white,\nwhich assured him that her keen eyes were following him and would follow\nhim until the distance and the closing darkness intervened, and hid him\nfrom her sight.\n\n\"I hope it will come out all right!\" he told himself and sighed.\n\nIf it did _not_ come out all right, where was his peace of mind; where\nwas the calm, where the long reposeful days he had so valued? But this\nthought he put from him as unworthy. After all Elizabeth's happiness\nwas something he desired infinitely more than he desired his own. But\nwhy could it not have been some one else? Why was it North; what unkind\nfate had been busy there?\n\n\"She sees more in him than I could ever see!\" he said aloud, as he\ntouched his horse with the whip.\n\nTwenty minutes later he drove up before the court-house, hitched and\nblanketed his horse, and passing around the building, now dark and\ndeserted, reached the entrance to the jail. In the office he found\nConklin at his desk. The sheriff was rather laboriously engaged in\nmaking the entry in his ledger of North's committal to his charge, a\nformality which, out of consideration for his prisoner's feelings, he\nhad dispensed with at the time of the arrest.\n\n\"I wish to see Mr. North. I suppose I may?\" his visitor said, after he\nhad shaken hands with Conklin.\n\n\"Certainly, General! Want to go up, or shall I bring him down here to\nyou?\"\n\n\"I'd prefer that--I'd much prefer that!\" answered the general hastily.\n\nHe felt that it would be something to tell Elizabeth that the interview\nhad taken place in the sheriff's office.\n\n\"All right, just as you say; have a chair.\" And Conklin left the room.\n\nThe general glanced about him dubiously. Had it not been for his deep\nlove for Elizabeth he could have wished himself anywhere else and\ncharged with any other mission. He dropped heavily into a chair. North's\narrest, and the results of that arrest as he now saw them in that\ncheerless atmosphere, loomed large before his mind's eye. He reflected\nthat a trial for murder was a horrible and soul-racking experience. He\ndevoutly and prayerfully hoped that it would not come to this in North's\ncase.\n\nHis meditation was broken in on by the sound of echoing steps in the\nbrick-paved passageway, and then North and Conklin entered the room. On\ntheir entrance the general quitted his chair and advanced to meet the\nyoung fellow, whose hand he took in silence. The sheriff glanced from\none to the other; and understanding that there might be something\nintimate and personal in their relation, he said:\n\n\"I'll just step back into the building, General; when you and Mr. North\nhave finished your talk, you can call me.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said General Herbert, and Conklin withdrew, leaving the two\nalone.\n\nThere was an awkward pause as they faced each other. The older man was\nthe first to speak.\n\n\"I regret this!\" he said at length.\n\n\"Not more than I do!\" rejoined North, with a fleeting sense of humor.\n\nHe wondered what it was that had brought Elizabeth's father there.\n\n\"What's the matter with Moxlow, anyhow?\" the general demanded.\n\nHe glanced sharply into North's face. He saw that the young fellow was\nrather pale, but otherwise his appearance was unchanged.\n\n\"All the evidence seems to point my way,\" said North, and added a trifle\nnervously: \"I don't understand it--it isn't clear to me by any means! It\ncame so suddenly, and I was totally unprepared to meet the situation. I\nhad talked to Moxlow in the morning, but he had let drop nothing that\nled me to suppose I was under suspicion. Of course I am not afraid. I\nknow that it will come out all right in the end--\"\n\n\"Do you want anything, North? Is there anything I can do for you?\" asked\nGeneral Herbert almost roughly.\n\n\"Thank you, but apparently there is nothing that any one can do just\nnow,\" said North quietly.\n\nThe color was creeping back into his face.\n\n\"Well, we can't sit idle! Look here, you tried for bail, I understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it has been refused.\"\n\n\"Do you know when the grand jury sits?\"\n\n\"Next week. Of course my hope is that it won't go beyond that; I don't\nsee how it can!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you send for me at once?\" asked the older man with\nincreasing bruskness. He took a turn about the room. \"What does it all\nmean? What do you know about McBride's death?\" he continued, halting\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" said North.\n\nAnd for an instant the two men looked straight into each other's eyes.\n\n\"You are sure you don't need anything--money, for instance?\" the general\nasked, shifting his glance.\n\n\"I am quite sure, but I am very grateful to you all the same--\"\n\n\"Of course the evidence against you is purely circumstantial?\"\n\n\"I believe so--yes,\" answered North. \"But there are points I don't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I am coming in to-morrow morning to see you, and talk the whole thing\nover with you, North.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to talk matters over with you, General,\" said\nNorth.\n\n\"I wish I could do something for you to-night!\" the general said with\nreal feeling, for he realized the long evening, and the longer night\nthat were before the young fellow.\n\nThere was a pause. The general could not bring himself to speak of\nElizabeth, and North lacked the courage to ask concerning her.\n\n\"I heard through one of my men of your arrest. He brought word of it to\nthe farm,\" the farmer said at length.\n\n\"Miss Herbert knows--of course you told her--\"\n\n\"Yes, North; yes, she knows!\" her father replied. \"She knows and she\nurged me to come!\"\n\nHe saw North's face light up with a sudden look of joy.\n\n\"She urged you to come?\" repeated North.\n\n\"Yes--I think she would have come herself if I had not been willing.\"\n\n\"I am glad she did not!\" said North quickly.\n\n\"Of course! I told her it would only distress you.\"\n\n\"It would only distress her--which is all that is worth considering,\"\nrejoined North.\n\n\"That's so!\" said the general, approaching the young man and resting a\nbrown and muscular hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"She has told you?\" asked North.\n\nThe older man nodded.\n\n\"Yes, she's told me,\" he said briefly.\n\n\"I can't ask if it was pleasant news at this time,\" said North. \"What do\nyou wish me to do?\" he continued. \"She must forget what was said that\nnight, and I, too, will endeavor to forget--tell her that.\" He passed a\nshaking hand before his face.\n\n\"I've a note here for you, North--\" General Herbert was fumbling in his\npocket--\"from Elizabeth. Don't you be too quick to decide!\"\n\n\"With your permission,\" said North as he took the letter.\n\nHe tore it open, and Elizabeth's father, watching him, saw the\nexpression of his face change utterly, as the lines of tense repression\nfaded from it. It was clear that for the moment all else was lost in his\nfeeling of great and compelling happiness. Twice he read the letter\nbefore he could bring himself to replace it in its envelope. As he did\nso, he caught the general's eyes fixed on him. For a moment he\nhesitated, then he said with the frankness that was habitual to him:\n\n\"I think you should know just what that letter means to me. It is brave\nand steadfast--just as she is; no, you were right, I can't decide--I\nwon't!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" said the general. There was a pause and then he added,\n\"After all, it is not given to every woman to show just how deep her\nfaith is in the man she loves. It would be too bad if you could not know\nthat!\"\n\n\"The situation may become intolerable, General Herbert! Suppose I am\nheld for the murder--suppose a long trial follows; think what she will\nsuffer, the uncertainty, the awful doubt of the outcome, although she\nknows,--she must know I am innocent.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course!\" cried the general hastily, for these were points\nhe did not wish to discuss.\n\n\"It's a serious matter when you consider the possibility of an\nindictment,\" said North soberly enough.\n\n\"That's true; yet we mustn't count the cost now, or at any future time.\nBut I promised Elizabeth I'd come back at once. What shall I say to her,\nNorth?\"\n\n\"Tell her that her letter has changed the whole aspect of things for me.\nYou must try to make her feel the fresh hope she has given me,\" John\nreplied, extending his hand.\n\n\"Conklin!\" called the general. He took North's hand. \"Good night; I'm\ninfinitely sorry to leave you here, North, but I suppose it can't be\nhelped--\"\n\nThe sheriff entered the room while he was yet speaking.\n\n\"Finished your chat, General?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, thank you, Conklin. Good night. Good night, North,\" and\nElizabeth's father hurried from the room.\n\nFor a moment North stood silent, staring absently at the door that had\njust closed on the general's burly figure. He still held Elizabeth's\nletter in his hand. In fancy he was seeing her as she had bent above it,\nher face tender, compassionate; and then there rose the vision of that\ncrowded room with its palpable atmosphere, its score of curious faces\nall turned toward him in eager expectation. In the midst of these\nunworthy surroundings, her face, beautiful and high bred, eluded him;\nthe likeness, even as he saw it, was lost, nor could he call it back.\n\nSlowly but certainly that day's experience was fixing itself unalterably\nin his memory. He caught the pungent reek from the wood-stove, and\nmingling with it the odor of strong cheap tobacco filled his nostrils\nagain; he was left with the very dregs of sordid shameful things.\n\nThe sheriff touched him on the arm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nTHE GAMBLER'S THEORY\n\n\nGilmore, leaving his apartment, paused to light a cigar, then sauntered\ndown the steps and into the street. As he did so he saw Marshall Langham\ncome from the post-office, half a block distant, and hurry across the\nSquare. Gilmore strode after him.\n\n\"Oh, say, Marsh, I want to see you!\" he called when he had sufficiently\nreduced the distance that separated him from his friend.\n\nInstantly Langham paused, turning a not too friendly face toward the\ngambler.\n\n\"You want to see me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Didn't I say so?\" demanded Gilmore, as he gained a place at his side.\n\"Where are you going, to the office?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have some letters to answer,\" and Langham quickened his pace.\n\nGilmore kept his place at the lawyer's elbow. For a moment there was\nsilence between them, and then Gilmore said:\n\n\"You got away from McBride's in a hurry Saturday; why didn't you wait\nand see the finish?\"\n\nLangham made no answer to this, and Gilmore, after another brief\nsilence, turned on him with an unexpected question:\n\n\"How would you like to be in North's shoes, Marsh?\" As he spoke, the\ngambler rested a hand on Langham's shoulder. He felt him shrink from the\nphysical contact. \"Gives you a chill just to think of it, doesn't it?\"\nhe said. \"I suppose Moxlow believes there's the making of a pretty\nstrong case against him; eh, Marsh?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I can't tell what he thinks,\" said Langham briefly.\n\n\"But in North's place, back there in the jail in one of those brand-new\niron cages over the yard, how would you feel? That's what I want to\nknow!\"\n\nLangham met his glance for an instant and then his eyes fell. He sensed\nthe insinuation that was back of Gilmore's words.\n\n\"Can't you put yourself in his place, with the evidence, such as it is,\nall setting against you?\"\n\n\"I'm due at the office,\" said the lawyer suddenly.\n\nGilmore took his arm.\n\n\"If North didn't kill McBride, who did?\" he persisted.\n\n\"Why do you ask me such questions?\" demanded Langham resentfully.\n\n\"My lord--can't we consider the matter?\" asked the gambler laughing.\n\n\"What's the use? Here, I've got to go to the office, Andy--\" and he\nsought to release himself, but Gilmore retained his hold.\n\n\"I suppose you are going to see North?\" he asked.\n\nLangham came to a sudden stop.\n\n\"What's that?\" he asked hoarsely.\n\n\"You have been his intimate for years; surely you are too good a friend\nto turn your back on him now!\"\n\n\"If he wants me, he'll send for me!\" muttered Langham.\n\n\"Do you mean you aren't _going_ to him, Marsh?\" asked the gambler with\nwell simulated astonishment.\n\n\"He knows where I'm to be found,\" said Langham, striding forward again,\n\"and, damn it, this is no concern of yours!\"\n\n\"Well, by thunder!\" ejaculated Gilmore.\n\n\"I don't need any points from you, Andy!\" said Langham, with a sullen\nsidelong glance at his companion.\n\nThey had crossed the Square, and Langham now halted at the curb.\n\n\"Good-by, Andy!\" he said, and shook himself free of the other's\ndetaining hand.\n\n\"Hold on a minute, Marsh!\" objected Gilmore.\n\n\"Well, what is it, can't you see I am in a hurry?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing here, Marsh--\" and striding forward, Gilmore disappeared in\nthe building before which they had paused.\n\nFor an instant Langham hesitated, and then he followed the gambler.\n\nA step or two in advance of him, Gilmore mounted the stairs, and passing\ndown the hall entered Langham's office. Langham followed him into the\nroom; he closed the door, and without a glance at Gilmore removed his\nhat and overcoat and hung them up on a nail back of the door; the\ngambler meanwhile had drawn an easy chair toward the open grate at the\nfar end of the room, before which he now established himself with\napparent satisfaction.\n\n\"I suppose the finding of the coroner's jury doesn't amount to much,\" he\npresently said but without looking in Langham's direction.\n\nThe lawyer did not answer him. He crossed to his desk which filled the\nspace between the two windows overlooking the Square.\n\n\"You're damn social!\" snarled Gilmore over his shoulder.\n\n\"I told you I was busy,\" said Langham, and he began to finger the papers\non his desk.\n\nGilmore swung around in his chair and faced him.\n\n\"So you won't see him--North, I mean?\" he queried. \"Well, you're a hell\nof a friend, Marsh. You've been as thick as thieves, and now when he's\nup against it good and hard, you're the first man to turn your back on\nhim!\"\n\nSeating himself, Langham took up his pen and began to write. Gilmore\nwatched him in silence for a moment, a smile of lazy tolerance on his\nlips.\n\n\"Suppose North is acquitted, Marsh; suppose the grand jury doesn't hold\nhim,\" he said at length; \"will the search for the murderer go on?\"\n\nThe pen slipped from Langham's fingers to the desk.\n\n\"Look here, I don't want to discuss North or his affairs with you. It's\nnothing to me; can't you get that through your head?\"\n\n\"As his friend--\" began Gilmore.\n\n\"Get rid of that notion, too!\"\n\n\"That's what I wanted to hear you say, Marsh! So you're not his friend?\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Langham briefly, and his shaking fingers searched among\nthe papers on his desk for the pen he had just dropped.\n\n\"So you're not his friend any more?\" repeated Gilmore slowly. \"Well, I\nexpect when a fellow gets hauled up for murder it's asking a good deal\nof his friends to stand by him! Do you know, Marsh, I'm getting an\nincreased respect for the law; it puts the delinquents to such a hell of\na lot of trouble. It's a good thing to let alone! I'm thinking mighty\nseriously of cutting out the games up at my rooms; what would you think\nof my turning respectable, Marsh? Would you be among the first to extend\nthe warm right hand of fellowship?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are respectable enough, Andy!\" said Langham.\n\nHe seemed vastly relieved at the turn the conversation had taken. He\nleaned back in his chair and thrust his hands in his trousers pockets.\n\n\"Say, why can't I put myself where I want to be? What's the matter with\nmy style, anyhow? It's as good as yours any day, Marsh; and no one ever\nsaw me drunk--that is a whole lot more than can be said of you; and yet\nyou stand in with the best people, you go to houses where I'd be thrown\nout if I as much as stuck my nose inside the door!\"\n\n\"Your style's all right, Andy!\" Langham hastened to assure him.\n\n\"Well, it's as good as yours any day!\"\n\n\"Better!\" said Langham, laughing.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter with it, then?\" persisted Gilmore.\n\n\"There's a good deal of it sometimes, it's rather oppressive--\" said the\nlawyer.\n\n\"I'll fix that,\" said Gilmore shortly.\n\n\"I would if I wanted what you seem to think you want,\" replied Langham\nchuckling.\n\n\"Marsh, I'm dead serious; I'm sick of being outside all the good things.\nI know plenty of respectable fellows, fellows like you; but I want to\nknow respectable women; why can't I?\"\n\n\"If you hanker for it, you can; it's up to you, Andy,\" said Langham.\n\nThe gambler appeared very ingenuous in this new r\u00c3\u00b4le of his.\n\n\"Look here, Marsh, I've never asked anything of you, and you must admit\nthat I've done you one or two good turns; now I'm going to ask a favor\nof you and I don't expect to be refused; fact is, I ain't going to take\na refusal--\"\n\n\"What is it, Andy?\" asked Langham cautiously, \"I want you to introduce\nme to your wife.\"\n\n\"The hell you do!\" ejaculated Langham.\n\nThe gambler's brow darkened.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded angrily.\n\n\"Nothing, I was only thinking of Mrs. Langham's probable attitude in the\nmatter, that was all.\"\n\n\"You mean you think she won't want to meet me?\" and in spite of himself\nGilmore's voice sounded strained and unnatural.\n\n\"I'm _sure_ she won't,\" said Langham with cruel candor.\n\n\"Well,\" observed Gilmore coolly, \"I'm going to put my case in your\nhands, Marsh; you come to my rooms, you drink my whisky, and smoke my\ncigars and borrow my money; now I'm going to make a new deal with you.\nI'm going to know your wife. I like her style--she and I'll get on fine\ntogether, once we know each other. You make it plain to her that I'm\nyour friend, your best friend, about your _only_ friend!\"\n\n\"You fool--\" began Langham.\n\nGilmore quitted his chair at a bound and strode to Langham's side.\n\n\"None of that, Marsh!\" he protested sternly, placing a heavy hand on\nLangham's shoulder. \"I see we got to understand each other, you and me!\nYou don't take hints; I have to bang it into you with a club or you\ndon't see what I'm driving at--\"\n\n\"I've paid you all I owe you, Gilmore!\" said Langham conclusively. \"You\ncan't hold that over me any longer.\"\n\n\"I don't want to!\" retorted Gilmore quietly.\n\n\"You kept your thumb on me good and hard while you could!\"\n\n\"Not half so hard as I am going to if you try to get away from me now--\"\n\n\"What do you mean by these threats?\" cried Langham.\n\nThe gambler laughed in his face.\n\n\"You've paid me all you owe me, but I want to ask you just one question.\nWhere did you get the money?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Langham, steadying himself by a mighty effort, \"is none of\nyour business!\"\n\n\"Think not?\" and again Gilmore laughed, but before his eyes, fierce,\ncompelling, Langham's glance wavered and fell.\n\n\"I got the money from my father,\" he muttered huskily.\n\n\"You're a liar!\" said the gambler. \"I know where you got that money, and\nyou know I know.\" There was a long pause, and then Gilmore jerked out:\n\n\"But don't you worry about that. In your own fashion you have been my\nfriend, and it's dead against my creed to go back on a friend unless he\ntries to throw me down; so don't you make the mistake of doing that, or\nI'll spoil your luck! You think you got North where you want him; don't\nyou be too sure of that! There's one person, just one, who can clear\nhim, at least there's only one who is likely to try, and I'll tell you\nwho it is--it's your wife--\" For an instant Langham thought Gilmore had\ntaken leave of his senses, but the gambler's next question filled him\nwith vague terror.\n\n\"Where was she late that afternoon, do you know?\"\n\n\"What afternoon?\" asked Langham.\n\nGilmore gave him a contemptuous glance.\n\n\"Thanksgiving afternoon, the afternoon of the murder,\" he snapped.\n\n\"She was at my father's, she dined there,\" said Langham slowly.\n\n\"That may be true enough, but she didn't get there until after six\no'clock--I'll bet you what you like on that, and I'll bet you, too, that\nI know where she was from five to six. Do you take me up? No? Of course\nyou don't! Well, I'll tell you all the same. She was in North's rooms--\"\n\n\"You lie, damn you!\" cried Langham, springing to his feet. He made an\nineffectual effort to seize Gilmore by the throat, but the gambler\nthrust him aside with apparent ease.\n\n\"Don't try that or you'll get the worst of it, Marsh; you've been\nsoaking up too much whisky to be any good at that game with me!\" said\nGilmore.\n\n[Illustration: \"She was in North's rooms--\"]\n\nHis manner was cool and determined. He took Langham roughly by the\nshoulders and threw him back in his chair. The lawyer's face was ghastly\nin the gray light that streamed in through the windows, but he had\nlost his sense of personal fear in another and deeper and less selfish\nemotion. Yet he realized the gambler's power over him, the power of a\nperfect and absolute knowledge of his most secret and hidden concerns.\n\nGilmore surveyed him with a glance of quiet scorn.\n\n\"It was about half past five when she turned up at North's rooms. He had\njust come up the stairs ahead of her; I imagine he knew she was coming.\nI guess I could tell you a few things you don't know! All during the\nsummer and fall they've been meeting on the quiet--\" he laughed\ninsolently. \"Oh, you have been all kinds of a fool, Marsh; I guess\nyou've got on to the fact at last. And I don't wonder you are anxious to\nsee North hang, and that you won't go near him; I'd kill him if I stood\nin your place. But maybe we can fix it so the law will do that job for\nyou. It seems to have the whip-hand with him just now. Well, he was the\nwhole thing with your wife when she went away this fall and then he\nbegan to take up with the general's girl--sort of to keep his hand in, I\nsuppose--the damn fool! For she ain't a patch on your wife. I guess Mrs.\nLangham had been tipped off to this new deal--that's what brought her\nback to Mount Hope in such a hurry, and she went to his rooms to have it\nout with him and learn just where she stood. I was in my bedroom and I\ncould hear them talking through the partition. It wasn't peaches and\ncream, for she was rowing all right!\"\n\n\"It's a lie!\" cried Langham, and he strove to rise to his feet, but\nGilmore's strong hand kept him in his chair.\n\n\"No, I don't lie, Marsh, you ought to know that by this time; but\nthere's just one point you want to get through your head; with your\nwife's help North can prove an alibi. He won't want to compromise her,\nor himself with the Herbert girl, for that matter; but how long do you\nthink he's going to keep his mouth shut with the gallows staring him in\nthe face? I'm willing to go as far in this matter as the next, but you\ngot to do your part and pay the price, or I'll throw you down so hard\nyou'll never get over the jar!\" His heavy jaws protruded. \"Now, I've a\nnotion I want to know your wife. I like her style. I guess you can trust\nher with me--you ain't afraid of that, are you?\"\n\n\"Take your hands off me!\" cried Langham, struggling fiercely.\n\nHe tore at the gambler's wrists, but Gilmore only laughed his\ntantalizing laugh.\n\n\"Oh, come, Marsh, let's get back to the main point. If North's indicted\nand your wife's summoned as a witness, she's got to chip in with us,\nshe's got to deny that she was in his room that day--you got to see to\nthat, I can't do everything--\"\n\n\"On your word--\"\n\n\"Well, you needn't quote me to her--it wouldn't help my standing with\nher--but ask her where she was between half past five and six the day of\nthe murder; and mind this, you must make her understand she's got to\nkeep still no matter what happens! Put aside the notion that North won't\nsummon her; wait until he is really in danger and then see how quick he\nsqueals!\"\n\n\"She may have gone to his rooms,\" said Langham chokingly, \"but that\ndoesn't prove anything wrong--\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Marsh, you ain't fool enough to feel that way about it--\"\n\n\"Let me up, Gilmore!\"\n\n\"No, I won't; I'm trying to make you see things straight for your own\ngood. What's the matter, anyhow; don't you and your wife get on?\"\n\nLangham's face was purple with rage and shame, while his eyes burned\nwith a murderous hate. Rude hands had uncovered his hidden sore; yet\nruder speech was making mock of the disgraceful secret. It was of his\nwife that this coarse bully was speaking! That what he said was probably\ntrue--Evelyn herself had admitted much--did not in the least ease the\nblow that had crushed his pride and self-respect. He lay back in his\nchair, limp and panting under Gilmore's strong hands. Where was his own\nstrength of heart and arm that he should be left powerless in this\nmoment of unspeakable degradation?\n\n\"It behooves you to do something more than soak up whisky,\" said the\ngambler. \"You must find out what took your wife to North's rooms, and\nyou must make her keep quiet no matter what happens. If you go about it\nright it ought to be easy, for they had some sort of a row and he's\nmixed up with the Herbert girl; you got that to go on. Now, the question\nis, is she mad enough to see him go to the penitentiary or hang without\nopening her mouth to save him? Come, you should know something about her\nby this time; I would, if I had been married to her as long as you\nhave.\"\n\nSuddenly he released Langham and fell back a step. The lawyer staggered\nto his feet, adjusting his collar and cravat which Gilmore's grasp on\nhis throat had disarranged. He glanced about him with a vague notion of\nobtaining some weapon that would put him on an equality with his more\npowerful antagonist, but nothing offered, and he took a step toward the\ndoor.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Marsh,\" said the gambler coldly. \"I'm going to change\nmy tactics with you. I'm not going to wear myself out keeping your nose\npointed in the right direction; you must do something for yourself, you\ndrunken fool!\"\n\nLangham took another step toward the door, but his eyes--the starting\nbloodshot eyes of a hunted animal--still searched the room for some\nweapon. Except for the heavy iron poker by the grate, there was nothing\nthat would serve his purpose, and he must pass the gambler to reach\nthat. Still fumbling with his collar he paused irresolutely, midway of\nthe room. Pride and self-respect would have taken him from the place but\nhate and fear kept him there.\n\nGilmore threw himself down in a chair before the fire and lit a cigar.\nIn spite of himself Langham watched him, fascinated. There was such\nconscious power and mastery in everything the gambler did, that he felt\nthe various purposes that were influencing him collapse with miserable\nfutility. What was the use of struggling?\n\n\"You can do as you blame please in this matter, Marsh,\" said the gambler\nat length. \"I haven't meant to offend you or insult you, but if you want\nto see it that way--all right, it suits me. You needn't look about you,\nfor you won't find any sledges here; you ought to know that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--\" asked Langham in a whisper.\n\n\"Draw up a chair and sit down, Marsh, and we'll thrash this thing out if\nit takes all night. Here, have a cigar!\" for Langham had drawn forward a\nchair. With trembling fingers he took the cigar the gambler handed him.\n\"Now light up,\" said Gilmore. He watched Langham strike a match, watched\nhis shaking hands as he brought its flame to the cigar's end. \"That's\nbetter,\" he said as the first puff of smoke left Langham's colorless\nlips. \"So you think you want to know what I mean, eh? Well, I'm going to\ntake you into my confidence, Marsh, and just remember you can't\npossibly reach the poker without having me on top of you before you get\nto it! You were pretty sober for you the afternoon of the murder, not\nmore than half shot, we'll say, but later on when you hunted me up at\nthe McBride house, you were as drunk as you will ever be, and slobbering\nall sorts of foolishness!\"\n\nHe puffed his cigar in silence for a moment. Langham's had gone out and\nhe was nervously chewing the end of it.\n\n\"What did I say?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"Oh, all sorts of damn nonsense. You're smart enough sober, but get you\ndrunk and you ain't fit to be at large!\"\n\n\"What did I say?\" repeated Langham.\n\n\"Better let me forget that,\" rejoined Gilmore significantly. \"And look\nhere, Marsh, I was sweating blood Saturday when they had Nelson on the\nstand, but it's clear he had no suspicion that my rooms were occupied on\nthe night of the murder. You were blue about the gills while Moxlow was\nquestioning him, and I don't wonder; as I tell you, I wasn't comfortable\nmyself, for I knew well enough how that bit of burnt bond got into the\nash barrel--\"\n\n\"Hush! For God's sake--\" whispered Langham in uncontrollable terror.\n\nGilmore laughed.\n\n\"My lord, man, you got to keep your nerve! Look here, Mount Hope ain't\ngoing to talk of anything but the McBride murder; you are going to hear\nit from morning to night, and that's one of the reasons you got to keep\nsober. You've done your best so far to queer yourself, and unless you\nlisten to reason you may do it yet.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean--\" said Langham.\n\n\"Don't you, Marsh? Well, I got just one more surprise in store for you,\nbut I'll keep it to myself a while longer before I spring it on you.\"\n\nHe was thinking of Joe Montgomery's story; if Langham did not prove\nreadily tractable, that should be the final weapon with which he would\nbeat him into submission. Presently he said:\n\n\"I've all along had my own theory about old man McBride's murder, and\nnow I'm going to see what you think of it, Marsh.\"\n\nAn icy hand seemed to be clutching Langham's heart. Gilmore's cruel\nsmiling eyes noted his suffering. He laughed.\n\n\"Of course, I don't think North killed McBride, not for one minute I\ndon't; in fact, it's a dead moral certainty he didn't!\" He leaned\nforward in his chair and looked into his companion's eyes. For an\ninstant Langham met his glance without flinching and then his eyes\nshifted and sought the floor. \"I'll bet,\" said Gilmore's cool voice,\n\"I'll bet you what you like I could put my hand on the man who did the\nmurder!\" and as he spoke he reached out and by an apparently accidental\ngesture, rested his hand on Langham's shoulder. \"You wouldn't like to\nrisk any money on that little bet, eh, Marsh?\" He sank back in his\nchair and applied himself to his cigar in silence, but his eyes never\nleft Langham's face.\n\nPresently he took the cigar from between his strong even teeth. \"Now,\nI'm going to give you my theory,\" he said. \"I want to see what you think\nof it--but remember always, I believe in letting well enough alone! They\ngot North caged in one of those nice new cells down at the jail and that\nsuits me all right! My theory is that the man who killed McBride was\nneeding money mighty badly and he went to McBride as a sort of a last\nchance. He found the old fellow alone in the office--understand, he\ndidn't go there with any fixed purpose of killing him, his ideas had not\ncarried him that far--he was willing to borrow the money if the old man\nwould lend it to him. He probably needed quite a sum, say two or three\nthousand dollars, and the need was urgent, you must keep that in mind\nand then you'll see perfectly how it all happened. Possibly my man was\nof the sort who don't fancy disagreeable interviews and had put off\ngoing to the store until the last moment, but once he had settled that\npoint with himself he was determined he wouldn't come away without the\nmoney. The old fellow, however, took a different view of the situation;\nhe couldn't see why he should lend any money, especially when the\nborrower was vague on the matter of security.\n\n\"Well, I guess they talked quite a while there at the back of the\nstore, McBride standing in the doorway of the office all the time. At\nlast it got to my man that he wasn't to have the money. But there was\ntrouble ahead of him if he didn't get it and he wouldn't give up; he\nkept on making promises--urging his need--and his willingness and\nability to meet his obligations. He was like a starving man in the\npresence of food, for he knew McBride had the money in his safe and the\nsafe door was open. His need seemed the only need in all the world, and\nit came to him that since McBride would not lend him the money he\nwanted, why not take it from him anyhow? He couldn't see consequences,\nhe could only realize that he must have two or three thousand dollars!\nPerhaps he got a glimmer of reason just here, and if he did he was\npretty badly frightened to think that he should even consider violence;\nhe turned away to leave McBride and the old man followed him a ways down\nthe store, explaining why they couldn't do business.\"\n\nGilmore paused. His cigar had gone out; now he struck a match, but he\ndid not take his eyes from Langham's face. He did not speak at once even\nwhen his cigar was lighted.\n\nGreat beads of perspiration stood thick on Langham's brow, his hair was\ndamp and clammy. He was living that unspeakable moment over again, with\nall its madness and horror. He saw himself as he had walked scowling\ntoward the front of the store; he had paused irresolutely with his hand\non the door-knob and then had turned back. The old merchant was standing\nclose by the scales, a tall gaunt figure in the waning light of day.\n\n\"Why do you tell me you can't do it?\" he had demanded with dull anger.\n\"You have the money, I know that!\"\n\n\"I didn't tell you I couldn't do it, Mr. Langham, I merely intimated\nthat I wouldn't,\" the old man had rejoined dryly.\n\n\"You have the money in your safe!\"\n\n\"What if I have? It's mine to do with as I think proper.\"\n\n\"A larger sum than I want--than I need!\"\n\n\"Quite likely.\"\n\nA furious gust of passion had laid hold of him, the consciousness of his\nnecessity, all-compelling and relentless, swept through his brain. Money\nhe must have!--his success, his happiness, everything depended on it,\nand what could money mean to this feeble old man whose days were almost\nspent?\n\n\"I want you to let me have two thousand dollars!\" he had insisted, as he\nplaced his hand on the old merchant's shoulder. \"Get it for me; I swear\nI'll pay it back. I'll give you such security as I can--my note--\"\n\nMcBride had laughed dryly at this, and he turned on his heel as though\nto re\u00c3\u00abnter the office. Langham shot a quick glance about him; the store\nwas empty, the street before it deserted; he saw through the dingy\nwindows the swirling scarfs of white that the wind sent flying across\nthe Square. Now was his time if ever! Bitter resentment urged him on--it\nwas a monstrous thing that those who could, would not help him!\n\nNear the scales was an anvil, and leaning against the anvil-block was a\nheavy sledge. As the old merchant turned from him, he had caught up the\nsledge and had struck him a savage blow on the head. McBride had dropped\nto the floor without cry or groan.\n\nLangham passed his hand before his eyes to blot out the vision of that\nstill figure on the floor, and a dry sob burst from his lips.\n\n\"Eh, did you speak, Marsh?\" asked Gilmore.\n\n\"No,\" said Langham in a whisper.\n\nGilmore laughed.\n\n\"You are seeing just how it all happened, Marsh. There was a sledge by\nthe anvil that stood near those scales, and when the old fellow wouldn't\ncome to time, my man lost all restraint and snatched it up, and a second\nlater McBride was dead. After that my man had things all his own way. He\nwent through the safe and took what was useful to him,--and those damn\nbonds of North's which weren't useful,--and skipped by the side door and\nout over the shed roof and down the alley, just as Joe said.\"\n\nGilmore paused, and flicked away a bit of cigar ash that had lodged in a\ncrease of his coat.\n\n\"That's the whole story of the McBride murder. Now what do you think of\nmy theorizing, Marsh; how does it strike you?\"\n\nBut Langham did not answer him. The gambler's words had brought it all\nback; he was living again the agony of that first conscious moment when\nhe realized the thing he had done. He remembered his hurried search for\nthe money, and his flight through the side door; he remembered crossing\nthe shed roof and the panic that had seized him as he dropped into the\nalley beyond, unseen, safe as he supposed. A debilitating reaction, such\nas follows some tremendous physical effort, had quickly succeeded. He\nhad wandered through the deserted streets seeking control of himself in\nvain. Finally he had gone home. Evelyn was at his father's and the\nservant absent for the day. He had let himself in with his latchkey and\nhad gone at once to the library. There he fell to pacing to and fro;\nten--twenty minutes had passed, when the sudden noisy clamor of the town\nbell had taken him, cowering, to the window; but the world beyond was a\nvaguely curtained white.\n\nHe raised his heavy bloodshot eyes and looked into the gambler's smiling\nface. He realized the futility of his act, since it had placed him\nirrevocably in Gilmore's power. He had endured unspeakable anguish all\nto no purpose, since Gilmore knew; knew with the certitude of an\neye-witness. And there the gambler sat smiling and at ease, torturing\nhim with his cunning speech.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nLOVE THAT ENDURES\n\n\nA melancholy wind raked the bare hills which rose beyond the flats, and\nfound its way across half the housetops in Mount Hope to the solitary\nwindow that gave light and air to John North's narrow cell. For seven\nlong days, over the intervening housetops, he had been observing those\nundulating hills, gazing at them until they seemed like some great live\nthing continually crawling along the horizon's rim, and continually\ndisappearing in the distance. Now he was watching their misted shapes\nsink deep into the twilight.\n\nNorth, by his counsel, had waved the usual preliminary hearing before\nthe mayor, his case had gone at once to the grand jury, he had been\nindicted and his trial was set for the February term of court. Watt\nHarbison had warned him that he might expect only this, yet his first\nfeeling of astonished horror remained with him.\n\nAs he stood by his window he was recalling the separate events of the\nday. The court room had been crowded to the verge of suffocation; when\nhe entered it a sudden hush and a mighty craning of necks had been his\nwelcome, and he had felt his cheeks redden and pale with a sense of\nshame at his hapless plight. Those many pairs of eyes that were fixed on\nhim seemed to lay bare his inmost thoughts; he had known no refuge from\ntheir pitiless insistence.\n\nIn that close overheated room the vitiated air had slowly mounted to the\nbrain; soon a third of the spectators nodded in their chairs scarcely\nable to keep awake; others moved restlessly with a dull sense of\nphysical discomfort, while the law, expressing itself in archaic terms,\nwound its way through a labyrinth of technicalities, and reached out\nhungrily for his very life.\n\nHe knew that he would be given every opportunity to establish his\ninnocence, but he could not rid himself of the ugly disconcerting belief\nthat a man hunt was on, and that he, the hunted creature, was to be\ndriven from cover to cover while the state drew its threads of testimony\nabout him strand by strand, until they finally reached his very throat,\nchoking, strangling, killing!\n\nHe thought of Elizabeth and was infinitely sorry. She must forget him,\nshe must go her way and leave him to go his--or the law's. He could face\nthe ruin of his own life, but it must stop there! He wondered what they\nwere saying and doing at Idle Hour; he wondered what the whole free\nworld was doing, while he stood there gazing from behind his bars at the\nempurpled hills in the distance.\n\nHe fell to pacing the narrow limits of his room; four steps took him to\nthe door, then he turned and four steps took him back to his\nstarting-point, the barred window. Presently a footfall sounded in the\ncorridor, a key was fitted in the heavy lock, and the door was opened by\nBrockett, the sheriff's deputy, a round-faced, jolly, little man with a\nshiny bald head and a closely cropped gray mustache.\n\n\"You've got visitors, John!\" said Brockett cheerfully, pausing in the\ndoorway.\n\nNorth turned on him swiftly.\n\n\"The general and Miss Herbert,--you see your friends ain't forgot you!\nYou'll want to see them, I suppose, and you'd rather go down in the\noffice, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I should much prefer it!\" said North.\n\nHis first emotion had been one of keen delight, but as he followed\nBrockett down the corridor the memory of what he was, and where he was,\ncame back to him. He had no right to demand anything of love or\nfriendship,--guilty or innocent mattered not at all! They were nearing\nthe door now beyond which stood Elizabeth and her father, and North\npaused, placing a hand on the deputy's arm. The spirit of his\nrenunciation had been strong within him, but another feeling was\nstronger still, he found; an ennobling pride in her devotion and trust.\nWhat a pity the finer things of life were so often the impractical! He\npushed past the deputy and entered the office.\n\nElizabeth came toward him with hands extended. Her cheeks were quite\ncolorless but the smile that parted her lips was infinitely tender and\ncompassionate.\n\n\"You should not have come here!\" North said, almost reproachfully, as\nhis hands closed about hers.\n\nGeneral Herbert stood gravely regarding the two, and his glance when it\nrested on North was troubled and uncertain. The difficulties which beset\nthis luckless fellow were only beginning, and what would the end be?\n\n\"Father!\"\n\nElizabeth had turned toward him, and he advanced with as brave a show of\ncordiality as he could command; but North read and understood the look\nof pain in his frank gray eyes.\n\n\"You agree with me that she should never have come here,\" North said\nquietly. \"But you couldn't refuse her!\" he added, and his glance went\nback to Elizabeth.\n\n\"Under the circumstances it was right for her to come!\" said the\ngeneral. But in his heart he was none too sure.\n\n\"I couldn't remain away after to-day; I had been waiting for that stupid\njury to act--\" She ended abruptly with a little laugh that became a sob,\nand her father rested a large and gentle hand upon her shoulder.\n\n\"There, dear, I told you all along it wouldn't do to count on any jury!\"\n\n\"My affairs are worth considering only as they affect you, Elizabeth!\"\nsaid North. \"I was thinking of you when Brockett came to tell me you\nwere here. Won't you go away from Mount Hope? I want you to\nforget,--no--\" for she was about to speak; \"wait until I have\nfinished;--even if I am acquitted this will always be something\ndiscreditable in the eyes of the world, it's going to follow me through\nlife! It is going to be hard for me to bear, it will be doubly hard for\nyou, dear. I want your father to take you away and keep you away until\nthis thing is settled. I don't want your name linked with mine; that's\nwhy I am sorry you came here, that's why you must never come here\nagain.\"\n\n\"You mustn't ask me to go away from Mount Hope, John!\" said Elizabeth.\n\"I am ready and willing to face the future with you; I was never more\nwilling than now!\"\n\n\"You don't understand, Elizabeth!\" said North. \"We are just at the\nbeginning. The trial, and all that, is still before us--long days of\nagony--\"\n\n\"And you would send me away when you will most need me!\" she said, with\ngentle reproach.\n\n\"I wish to spare you--\"\n\n\"But wherever I am, it will be the same!\"\n\n\"No, no,--you must forget--!\"\n\n\"If I can't,--what then?\" she asked, looking up into his face.\n\n\"I want you to try!\" he urged.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Dear, I have lived through all this; I have asked myself if I really\ncared so much that nothing counted against the little comfort I might be\nto you; so much that the thought of what I am to you would outweigh\nevery other consideration, and I am sure of myself. If I were not, I\nshould probably wish to escape from it all. I am as much afraid of\npublic opinion as any one, and as easily hurt, but my love has carried\nme beyond the point where such things matter!\"\n\n\"My dear! My dear! I am not worthy of such love.\"\n\n\"You must let me be the judge of that.\"\n\n\"Suppose the verdict is--guilty?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,--no, it will never be that!\" But the color left her cheeks.\n\n\"I don't suppose it will be,\" agreed North hastily.\n\nIt was a cruel thing to force this doubt on her.\n\n\"You won't send me away, John?\" she entreated. \"If I were to leave Mount\nHope now it would break my heart! I--we--my father and I, wish every one\nto know that our confidence in you is unshaken.\"\n\nNorth turned to the general with a look of inquiry, of appeal. Something\nvery like a sigh escaped the older man's lips, but he squared his\nshoulders manfully for the burdens they must bear. He said quietly:\n\n\"Let us consider a phase of the situation that Elizabeth and I have been\ndiscussing this afternoon. Watt Harbison is no doubt doing all he can\nfor you; but he was at Idle Hour last night, and said he would,\nhimself, urge on you the retention of some experienced criminal lawyer.\nHe suggested Ex-judge Belknap; I approve of this suggestion--\"\n\nBut North shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, yes, John, it must be Judge Belknap!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Watt says\nit must be, and father agrees with him!\"\n\n\"But I haven't the money, dear. His retainer would probably swallow up\nall I have left.\"\n\n\"Leave Belknap to me, North!\" interposed the general.\n\nNorth's face reddened.\n\n\"You are very kind, and I--I appreciate it all,--but don't you see I\ncan't do that?\" he faltered.\n\n\"Don't be foolish, John. You must reconsider this determination; as a\nmatter of fact I have taken the liberty of communicating with Belknap by\nwire; he will reach Mount Hope in the morning. We are vitally concerned,\nNorth, and you must accept help--money--whatever is necessary!\"\n\nThe expression on North's face softened, and tears stood in his eyes.\n\n\"I knew you would prove reasonable,\" continued the general, and he\nglanced at Elizabeth.\n\nShe was everything to him. He could have wished that North was almost\nany one else than North; and in spite of himself this feeling gave its\ncolor to their interview, something of his wonted frankness was lacking.\nIt was his unconscious protest.\n\n\"Very well, then, I will see Judge Belknap, and some day--when I can--\"\nsaid North, still struggling with his emotion and his pride.\n\n\"Oh, don't speak of that!\" exclaimed General Herbert hastily.\n\n\"This miserable business could not have happened at a worse time for\nme!\" said the young fellow with bitterness.\n\n\"Don't say that, John!\" pleaded Elizabeth. \"For your friends--\"\n\n\"You and your father, you mean!\" interrupted North.\n\n\"It is hard enough to think of you here alone, without--\" Her voice\nfaltered, and this time her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I'll not object again, Elizabeth; that you should suffer is much the\nworst part of the whole affair!\"\n\nBrockett had entered the room and General Herbert had drawn him aside.\n\n\"I am coming every day, John!\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"Will your father agree to that?\" asked North.\n\n\"Yes, can't you see how good and kind he is!\"\n\n\"Indeed I can, it is far beyond what I should be in his place, I'm\nafraid.\"\n\n\"It has been so horrible,--such nights of agony--\" she whispered.\n\n\"I know, dear,--I know!\" he said tenderly.\n\n\"They are not looking for other clues and yet the man who killed poor\nold man McBride may be somewhere in Mount Hope at this very minute!\"\n\n\"Until I am proved innocent, I suppose they see nothing to do,\" said\nNorth.\n\n\"But, John, you are not afraid of the outcome?\" And she rested a hand on\nhis arm.\n\n\"No, I don't suppose I really am,--I shall be able to clear myself, of\ncourse; the law doesn't often punish innocent men, and I am innocent.\"\n\nHe spoke with quiet confidence, and her face became radiant with the\nhope that was in his words.\n\n\"You have taken to yourself more than your share of my evil fortunes,\nElizabeth, dear--I shall be a poor sort of a fellow if my gratitude does\nnot last to the end of my days!\" said North.\n\nThe general had shaken hands with the deputy and now crossed the room to\nElizabeth and North.\n\n\"We shall have to say good night, North. Can we do anything before we\ngo?\" he asked.\n\n\"We will come again to-morrow, John,--won't we, father?\" said Elizabeth,\nas she gave North her hands. \"And Judge Belknap will be here in the\nmorning!\" She spoke with fresh courage and looked her lover straight in\nthe eyes. Then she turned to the general.\n\nNorth watched them as they passed out into the night, and even after the\ndoor had closed on them he stood where she had left him. It was only\nwhen the little deputy spoke that he roused himself from his reverie.\n\n\"Well, John, are you ready now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said North.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nAT HIS OWN DOOR\n\n\nJudge Langham sat in his library before a brisk wood fire with the day's\npapers in a heap on the floor beside him. In repose, the one dominant\nexpression of the judge's face was pride, an austere pride, which\nmanifested itself even in the most casual intercourse. Yet no man in\nMount Hope combined fewer intimacies with a wider confidence, and his\nmany years of public life had but augmented the universal respect in\nwhich he was held.\n\nNow in the ruddy light of his own hearth, but quite divorced from any\nsentiment or sympathy, the judge was considering the case of John North.\nHis mind in all its operations was singularly clear and dispassionate; a\njudicial calm, as though born to the bench, was habitual to him. It was\nnothing that his acquaintance with John North dated back to the day John\nNorth first donned knee-breeches.\n\nHe shaded his face with his hand. In the long procession of evil-doers\nwho had gone their devious ways through the swinging baize doors of his\ncourt, North stalked as the one great criminal. Unconsciously his glance\nfixed itself on the hand he had raised to shield his eyes from the\nlight of the blazing logs, and it occurred to him that that hand might\nyet be called on to sign away a man's life.\n\nThe ringing of his door-bell caused him to start expectantly, and a\nmoment later a maid entered to say that a man and a woman wished to see\nhim.\n\n\"Show them in!\" said the judge.\n\nAnd Mr. Shrimplin with all that modesty of demeanor which one of his\nsensitive nature might be expected to feel in the presence of greatness,\npromptly insinuated himself into the room.\n\nThe little lamplighter was dressed in those respectable garments which\nin the Shrimplin household were adequately described as his \"other\nsuit,\" and as if to remove any doubt from the mind of the beholder that\nhe had failed to prepare himself for the occasion, he wore a clean paper\ncollar, but no tie, this latter being an adornment Mr. Shrimplin had not\nattempted in years. Close on Shrimplin's heels came a jaded unkempt\nwoman in a black dress, worn and mended. On seeing her the judge's cold\nscrutiny somewhat relaxed.\n\n\"So it's you, Nellie?\" he said, and motioned her to a chair opposite his\nown.\n\nNot knowing exactly what was expected of him, Mr. Shrimplin remained\nstanding in the middle of the room, hat in hand.\n\n\"Be seated, Shrimplin,\" said the judge, sensing something of the\nlamplighter's embarrassment in his presence and rather liking him for\nit.\n\n\"Thank you, Judge,\" replied Shrimplin, selecting a straight-backed chair\nin a shadowy corner of the room, on the very edge of which he humbly\nestablished himself.\n\n\"Better draw nearer the fire, Shrimplin!\" advised the judge.\n\n\"Thank you, Judge, I ain't cold,\" rejoined Mr. Shrimplin in his best\nmanner.\n\nThe judge turned to the woman. She had once been a servant in his\nhousehold, but had quitted his employ to marry Joe Montgomery, and to\nbecome by that same act Mr. Shrimplin's sister-in-law. The judge knew\nthat her domestic life had been filled with every known variety of\ntrouble, since from time to time she had appealed to him for help or\nadvice, and on more than one occasion at her urgent request he had\ninterviewed the bibulous Joe.\n\n\"I hope you are not in trouble, Nellie,\" he said, not unkindly.\n\n\"Yes I am, Judge!\" cried his visitor in a voice worn thin by weariness.\n\n\"It's that disgustin' Joe!\" interjected Mr. Shrimplin from his corner,\nadvancing his hooked nose from the shadows. \"Don't take up the judge's\ntime, Nellie; time's money, and money's as infrequent as a white crow.\"\n\nAnd then suddenly and painfully conscious of his verbal forwardness, the\nlittle lamplighter sank back into the grateful gloom of his corner and\nwas mute.\n\n\"It's my man, Judge--\" said Nellie.\n\nAnd the judge nodded comprehendingly.\n\n\"I don't know how me and my children are to live through the winter, I\ndeclare I don't, Judge, unless he gives me a little help!\"\n\n\"And the winter ain't fairly here yet, and it's got a long belly when it\ndoes come!\" said Mr. Shrimplin.\n\nImmediately the little man was conscious of the impropriety of his\nlanguage. He realized that the happy and forcefully expressed philosophy\nwith which he sought to open Custer's mind to the practical truths of\nlife, was a jarring note in the judge's library.\n\n\"Joe's acting scandalous, Judge, just scandalous!\" said Nellie with\nsudden shrill energy. \"That man would take the soul out of a saint with\nhis carryings-on!\"\n\n\"It seems to me there is nothing new in this,\" observed the judge a\nlittle impatiently. \"Is he under arrest?\"\n\n\"No, Judge, he ain't under arrest--\" began Nellie.\n\n\"Which ain't saying he hadn't ought to be!\" the little lamplighter\nsnorted savagely. He suddenly remembered he was there to give his moral\nsupport to his sister-in-law.\n\n\"That man's got a new streak into him, Judge. I thought he'd about done\neverything he could do that he shouldn't, but he's broke out in a fresh\nspot!\"\n\n\"What has he been doing, Nellie?\" asked the judge, who felt that his\ncallers had so far lacked in directness and definiteness.\n\n\"What ain't he been doing, you'd better say, Judge!\" cried Nellie\nmiserably.\n\n\"Is he abusing you or the children?\"\n\n\"I don't see him from one week's end to another!\"\n\n\"Am I to understand that he has deserted you?\" questioned the judge.\n\n\"No, I can't say that, for he sends his clothes home for me to wash and\nmend.\"\n\n\"Ain't that the human sufferin' limit?\" gasped Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"I suppose you wash and mend them?\" And the judge smiled faintly.\n\n\"Of course,\" admitted Mrs. Montgomery simply.\n\n\"Does he contribute anything toward your support?\" asked the judge.\n\nThe woman laughed sarcastically at this.\n\n\"It takes a barkeeper to pry Joe loose from his coin,\" interjected Mr.\nShrimplin. \"Get down to details, Nellie, and tell the judge what kind of\na critter you're hitched up to.\"\n\n\"He told Arthur, that's my oldest boy, if I didn't stop bothering him,\nthat he was just man enough to pay five dollars for the fun of knocking\nthe front off my face!\"\n\n\"That was a choice one to hand out to an eldest son, wasn't it, your\nHonor?\" said the little lamplighter, tugging at his flaxen mustache.\n\n\"I just manage to keep a roof over our heads,\" went on Nellie, \"and\nwithout any thanks to him; but he has plenty of money, and where it\ncomes from I'd like to know, for he ain't done a lick of work in weeks!\"\n\n\"Fact, Judge!\" remarked Mr. Shrimplin. \"I've made it my business lately\nto keep one eye on Joe. He spends half his time loafin' at Andy\nGilmore's rooms, and the other half gettin' pickled.\"\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\" asked the judge, addressing himself to Mrs.\nMontgomery.\n\n\"I wish, Judge, that you'd send word to him that you want to see him!\"\n\n\"And toss a good healthy scare into him!\" added Mr. Shrimplin\naggressively.\n\n\"But he might not care to respect the summons; there is no reason why he\nshould,\" explained the judge.\n\n\"If he knows you want to see him, he'll come here fast enough!\" said\nNellie.\n\nThe judge turned to Shrimplin.\n\n\"Will you tell him this, Shrimplin, the first time you see him?\"\n\n\"Won't I!\" said the little lamplighter. \"Certainly, Judge--certainly!\"\nand his agile fancy had already clothed the message in verbiage that\nshould terrify the delinquent Joe.\n\n\"Very well, then; but beyond giving him a word of advice and warning; I\ncan do nothing.\"\n\nA night or two later, as the judge, who had spent the evening at\nColonel Harbison's, came to his own gate, he saw a slouching figure\ndetach itself from the shadows near his front door and advance to meet\nhim midway of the graveled path that led to the street. It was Joe\nMontgomery.\n\n\"Well, my man!\" said the judge, with some little show of sternness. \"I\nsuppose you received my message?\"\n\nMontgomery uncovered his shock of red hair, while his bulk of bone and\nmuscle actually trembled in the presence of the small but awesome figure\nconfronting him. He might have crushed the judge with a blow of his huge\nfist, but no possible provocation could have induced him to lay hands on\nNellie's powerful ally.\n\n\"That skunk Shrimplin says my old woman's been here,\" he faltered,\n\"poisonin' your mind agin me!\" A sickly grin relaxed his heavy jaws.\n\"The Lord only knows what she expects of a man--I dunno! The more I try,\nthe worse she gets; nothin' satisfies her!\"\n\nHis breath, reeking of whisky, reached the judge.\n\n\"This is all very well, Montgomery, but I have a word or two to say to\nyou--come into the house.\"\n\nHe led his disreputable visitor into the library, turned up the gas, and\nintrenched himself on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire. The\nhandy-man had kept near the door leading into the hall.\n\n\"Come closer!\" commanded the judge, and Montgomery, hat in hand,\nadvanced a step. \"I wish to warn you, Montgomery, that if you persist\nin your present course, it is certain to bring its own consequences,\"\nbegan the judge.\n\n\"Sure, boss!\" Joe faltered abjectly.\n\n\"I understand from Nellie that you have practically deserted your\nfamily,\" continued the judge.\n\n\"Ain't she hateful?\" cried Joe, shaking his great head.\n\n\"When she married you, she had a right to expect you would not turn out\nthe scoundrel you are proving yourself.\"\n\n\"Boss, that's so,\" agreed Montgomery.\n\n\"This won't do!\" said the judge briskly. \"Nellie says she doesn't see\nyou from one week's end to another; that you have money and yet\ncontribute nothing toward her support nor the support of your family.\"\n\n\"I am willin' to go home, Judge!\" said Montgomery, fingering his cap\nwith clumsy hands. He took a step nearer the slight figure on the\nhearth-rug and dropped his voice to a husky half maudlin whisper. \"He\nwon't let me--see--I'm a nigger slave to him! I know I got a wife--I\nknow I got a family, but he says--no! He says--'Joe, you damned old sot,\nyou'll go home with a few drinks inside your freckled hide and begin to\nshoot off your mouth, and there'll be hell to pay for all of us!'\"\n\n\"He? What are you saying--who won't let you go home?\" demanded the\njudge.\n\n\"Andy Gilmore; he's afraid my old woman will get it out of me. I tell\nhim I'm a married man but he says, 'No, you old soak, you stay here!'\"\n\n\"What has Andy Gilmore to do with whether you go home or not?\" inquired\nthe judge.\n\n\"It's him and Marsh,\" said the handy-man. \"They bully me till I'm that\nrattled--\"\n\n\"Marsh--do you mean my son, Marshall?\" interrupted the judge.\n\n\"Yes, boss--\"\n\n\"I don't understand this!\" said the judge after a moment of silence.\n\"Why should Mr. Gilmore or my son wish to keep you away from your wife?\"\n\n\"It's just a notion of theirs,\" replied Montgomery with sudden drunken\nloyalty. \"And I'll say this--money never come so easy--and stuff to\ndrink! Andy's got it scattered all about the place; there ain't many\nbars in this here town stocked up like his rooms!\"\n\nThe judge devoted a moment to a close scrutiny of his caller.\n\n\"You are some sort of a relative of Mr. Gilmore's, are you not?\" he\nasked at length.\n\n\"We're cousins, boss.\"\n\n\"Why does he wish to keep you away from your family?\" the judge spoke\nafter another brief pause.\n\n\"It's my old woman,\" and Montgomery favored the judge with a drunken\nleer. \"Suppose I was to go home full, what's to hinder her from gettin'\nthings out of me? I'm a talker, drunk or sober, and Andy Gilmore knows\nit--that's what he's afraid of!\"\n\n\"What have you to tell that could affect Mr. Gilmore? Do you refer to\nthe gambling that is supposed to go on in his rooms? If so, he is at\nneedless pains in the matter; Mr. Moxlow will take up his case as soon\nas the North trial is out of the way.\"\n\nMontgomery started, took a forward step, and dropping his voice to an\nimpressive whisper, said:\n\n\"Judge, what are you goin' to do with young John North?\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing with John North; it is the law--society, to which he\nis accountable,\" rejoined the judge.\n\n\"Will he be sent up, do you reckon?\" asked Montgomery, and his small\nblue eyes searched the judge's face eagerly.\n\n\"If he is convicted, he will either be sentenced to the penitentiary for\na term of years or else hanged.\" The judge spoke without visible\nfeeling.\n\nThe effect of his words on the handy-man was singular. A hoarse\nexclamation burst from his lips, and his bloated face became pale and\ndrawn.\n\n\"You mustn't do that, boss!\" he cried, spreading out his great hands in\nprotest. \"A term of years--how many's that?\"\n\n\"In this particular instance it may mean the rest of his life,\" said the\njudge.\n\nMontgomery threw up his arms in a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Don't you be too rough on him, boss!\" he cried. \"For life!\" he repeated\nin a tone of horror. \"But that ain't what Andy and Marsh tell me; they\nsay his friends will see him through, that he's got the general back of\nhim, and money--how's that, Judge?\"\n\n\"They are making sport of your ignorance,\" said the judge, almost\npityingly.\n\n\"I'm done with them!\" cried Joe Montgomery with a great oath. He raised\none clenched hand and brought it down in the opened palm of the other.\n\"Andy's everlastingly lied to me; I won't help send no man up for life!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded the judge, astonished at this sudden\noutburst, and impressed, in spite of himself, by the man's earnestness.\n\n\"Just what I say, boss! They can count me out--I'm agin 'em, I'm agin\n'em every time!\" And again, as if to give force to his words, he swung\nhis heavy first around and struck the open palm of his other hand a\nstinging blow. \"Eatin' and sleepin', I'm agin 'em! I ain't liked the\nlook of this from the first, and now I'm down and out, and they can go\nto hell for all of me!\"\n\nThe judge rested an elbow on the chimneypiece and regarded Montgomery\ncuriously. He knew the man was drunk; he knew that sober he would\nprobably have said much less than he was now saying, but he also knew\nthat there was some powerful feeling back of his words.\n\n\"If you are involved in any questionable manner with Mr. Gilmore, I\nshould advise you to think twice before you go further with it. Mr.\nGilmore is shrewd, he has money; you are a poor man and you are an\nignorant man. Your reputation is none of the best.\"\n\n\"Thank you, boss!\" said Montgomery gratefully.\n\n\"Mr. Gilmore probably expects to use you for his own ends regardless of\nthe consequences to you,\" finished the judge.\n\n\"Supposin'--\" began the handy-man huskily, \"supposin', boss, I was to go\ninto court and swear to something that wasn't so; what's that?\" and he\nbent a searching glance on the judge's face.\n\n\"Perjury,\" said the judge laconically.\n\n\"What's it worth to a man? I reckon it's like drinkin' and stealin',\nit's got so many days and costs chalked up agin it?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the judge quietly, \"that you would better tell me what\nyou mean. Ordinarily I should not care to mix in your concerns, but on\nNellie's account--\"\n\n\"God take a likin' to you, boss!\" cried Montgomery. \"I know I ought to\nhave kept out of this. I told Andy Gilmore how it would be, that I\nhadn't the brains for it; but he was to stand back of me. And so he\nwill--to give me a kick and a shove when he's done with me!\"\n\nHe saw himself caught in that treacherous fabric Gilmore had erected for\nJohn North, whose powerful friends would get him clear. Andy and Marsh\nwould go unscathed, too. Only Joe Montgomery would suffer--Joe\nMontgomery, penniless and friendless, a cur in the gutter for any decent\nman to kick! He passed the back of his hand across his face.\n\n\"It's a hell of a world and be damned to it!\" he muttered hoarsely under\nhis breath.\n\n\"You must make it clearer to me than this!\" said the judge impatiently.\n\nMontgomery seemed to undergo a brief but intense mental struggle, then\nhe blurted out:\n\n\"Boss, I lied when I said it was North I seen come over old man\nMcBride's shed that night!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you perjured yourself in the North case?\"\nasked the judge sternly.\n\n\"Sure, I lied!\" said the handy-man. \"But Andy Gilmore was back of that\nlie; it was him told me what I was to say, and it's him that kept\nhoundin' me, puttin' me up to say more than I ever agreed to!\" He\nslouched nearer the judge. \"Boss, I chuck up the whole business; do you\nunderstand? I want to take back all I said; I'm willin' to tell the God\nA'mighty's truth!\"\n\nHe paused abruptly. In his excitement he had forgotten what the truth\nmeant, what it would mean to the man before him. He was vaguely aware\nthat in abler hands than his own, this knowledge which he possessed\nwould have been molded into a terrible weapon, but he was impotent to\nuse it; with every advantage his, he felt only the desperate pass in\nwhich he had placed himself. If Gilmore and Marshall Langham could\njuggle with John North's life, what of his own life when the judge\nshould have become their ally!\n\n\"Me and you'll have to fix up what I got to say, boss!\" he added with a\ncunning grin.\n\n\"Do you mean you wish to make a statement to me?\" asked the judge.\n\nThe handy-man nodded. The judge hesitated.\n\n\"Perhaps we would better send for Mr. Moxlow?\" he suggested.\n\nBut Montgomery shook his head vehemently.\n\n\"I got nothin' to say to that man Moxlow!\" he growled with sullen\ndetermination.\n\n\"Very well, then, if you prefer to make your statement to me,\" and the\njudge turned to his desk.\n\n\"Hold on, boss, we ain't ready for that just yet!\" Joe objected. He was\nsober enough, by this time.\n\n\"What is it you wish to tell me?\"\n\nAnd the judge resumed his former position on the hearth-rug.\n\n\"First you got to agree to get me out of this.\"\n\n\"I can agree to nothing,\" answered the judge quietly.\n\n\"I ain't smart, boss, but Joe Montgomery's old hide means a whole lot to\nJoe Montgomery! You give me your word that I'll be safe, no matter what\nhappens!\"\n\n\"I can promise you nothing,\" repeated the judge.\n\n\"Then what's the use of my tellin' you the truth?\" demanded Montgomery.\n\n\"It has become the part of wisdom, since you have already admitted that\nyou have perjured yourself.\"\n\n\"Boss, if it wasn't John North I seen in the alley that day, who was\nit?\" and he strode close to the judge's side, dropping his voice to a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Perhaps the whole story was a lie.\"\n\nThe handy-man laughed and drew himself up aggressively.\n\n\"I'm a man as can do damage--I got to be treated right, or by the Lord\nI'll _do_ damage! I been badgered and hounded by Marsh and Andy Gilmore\ntill I'm fair crazy. They got to take their hands off me and leave me\nloose, for I won't hang no man on their say-so! John North never done me\nno harm, I got nothing agin him!\"\n\n\"You have admitted that your whole story of seeing John North on the\nnight of the McBride murder is a lie,\" said the judge.\n\n\"Boss, there is truth enough in it to hang a man!\"\n\n\"You saw a man cross McBride's sheds?\"\n\nAnd the judge kept his eyes fastened on the handy-man's face.\n\n\"I seen a man cross McBride's shed, boss.\"\n\n\"And you have sworn that that man was John North.\"\n\n\"I swore to a lie. Boss, we got to fix it this way: I seen a man come\nover the roof and drop into the alley; I swore it was John North, but I\nnever meant to swear to that; the most I promised Andy was that I'd say\nI thought it _looked_ like John North, but them infernal lawyers got\nafter me, and the first thing I knowed I'd said it _was_ John North!\"\n\n\"Your story is absurd!\" exclaimed the judge, with a show of anger.\n\nThe handy-man raised his right hand dramatically.\n\n\"It's God A'mighty's everlastin' truth!\" he swore.\n\n\"Understand, I have made you no promises,\" said the judge, disregarding\nhim.\n\n\"You're goin' back on me!\" cried Montgomery. \"Then you look out. I'm a\nman as can do harm if I have a mind to; don't you give me the mind,\nboss!\"\n\n\"I shall lay this matter before Mr. Moxlow in the morning,\" replied the\njudge quietly and with apparent indifference, but covertly he was\nwatching the effect of his words on Montgomery.\n\n\"And then they'll be after me!\" cried the handy-man.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said the judge placidly.\n\nMontgomery glanced about as though he half expected to see Gilmore rise\nup out of some shadowy corner.\n\n\"Boss, do you want to know who it was I seen come over old man McBride's\nshed? Do you want to know why Andy and Marsh are so set agin my goin'\nhome to my old woman? Why they give me money? It's a pity I ain't a\nsmarter man! I'd own 'em, both body and soul!\"\n\n\"Man, you are mad!\" cried the judge.\n\nBut this man who was usually austere and always unafraid, was feeling a\nstrange terror of the debased and slouching figure before him.\n\n\"Do you reckon you're man enough to hear what I got in me to tell?\"\nasked Montgomery, again raising his right hand high above his head as if\nhe called on Heaven to witness the truth of what he said. \"Why won't\nthey let me go home to my old woman, boss? Why do they keep me at Andy\nGilmore's--why do they give me money? Because what I'm tellin' you is\nall a lie, I suppose! Just because they like old Joe Montgomery and want\nhim 'round! I don't think!\" He threw back his head and laughed with\nrough sarcasm. \"You're a smarter man than me, boss; figure it out; give\na reason for it!\"\n\nBut the judge, white-faced and shaken to his very soul, was silent; yet\nhe guessed no part of the terrible truth Montgomery supposed he had made\nplain to him. At the most he believed Marshall was shielding Gilmore\nfrom the consequences of a crime the gambler had committed.\n\nMontgomery, sinister and menacing, shuffled across the room and then\nback to the judge's side.\n\n\"You ask Marsh, boss, what it all means. I got nothin' more to say! Ask\nhim who killed old man McBride! If he don't know, no man on this green\nearth does!\"\n\nThe judge's face twitched convulsively, but he made no answer to this.\n\n\"Ask him!\" repeated the handy-man, and swinging awkwardly on his heel\nwent from the room without a single backward glance.\n\nAn instant later the street-door closed with a noisy bang.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nAN UNWILLING GUEST\n\n\nMontgomery told himself he would go home; he had seen the last of the\ngambler and Marsh Langham, he would look out for his own skin now and\nthey could look out for theirs. He laughed boisterously as he strode\nalong. He had fooled them both; he, Joe Montgomery, had done this, and\nby a very master stroke of cunning had tied the judge's hands. But as he\nshuffled down the street he saw the welcoming lights of Lonigan's saloon\nand suddenly remembered there was good hard money in his ragged pockets.\nHe would have just one drink and then go home to his old woman.\n\nIt was well on toward midnight when he came out on the street again, and\nthe one drink had become many drinks; still mindful of his original\npurpose, however, he reeled across the Square on his way home. He had\njust turned into Mulberry Street when he became conscious of a brisk\nstep on the pavement at his side, and at the same instant a heavy hand\ndescended on his shoulder and he found himself looking into Andy\nGilmore's dark face.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" demanded Gilmore. \"I thought I told you to stay\nabout to-night!\"\n\n\"I have been down to Lonigan's saloon,\" faltered Joe, his courage going\nfrom him at sight of the gambler.\n\n\"What took you there?\" asked Gilmore angrily. \"Don't you get enough to\ndrink at my place?\"\n\n\"Lots to drink, boss, but it's mostly too rich for my blood. I ain't\nused to bein' so pampered.\"\n\n\"Come along with me!\" said Gilmore briefly.\n\n\"Where to, boss?\" asked Montgomery, in feeble protest.\n\n\"You'll know presently.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd like to go home, maybe--\" said Joe irresolutely.\n\n\"Never mind what you thought you'd like, you come with me!\" insisted\nGilmore.\n\nAlthough the handy-man's first impulse had been that of revolt, he now\nfollowed the gambler meekly back across the Square. They entered the\nbuilding at the corner of Main Street and mounted to Mr. Gilmore's\nrooms. The latter silently unlocked the door and motioned Montgomery to\nprecede him into the apartment, then he followed, pausing midway of the\nroom to turn up the gas which was burning low. Next he divested himself\nof his hat and coat, and going to a buffet which stood between the two\nheavily curtained windows that overlooked the Square, found a decanter\nand glasses. These he brought to the center-table, where he leisurely\npoured his unwilling guest a drink.\n\n\"Here, you old sot, soak this up!\" he said genially.\n\n\"Boss, I want to go home to my old woman!\" began the handy-man, after he\nhad emptied his glass.\n\n\"Your old woman will keep!\" retorted Gilmore shortly.\n\n\"But, boss, I got to go to her; the judge says I must! She's been there\nto see him; damn it, she cried and hollered and took on awful because\nshe ain't seein' me; it was pitiful!\"\n\n\"What's that?\" demanded Gilmore sharply.\n\n\"It was pitiful!\" repeated Montgomery, shaking his great head\ndolorously.\n\n\"Oh, cut that! Who have you seen?\"\n\n\"Judge Langham.\"\n\n\"When did you see him?\"\n\nMr. Gilmore spoke with a forced calm.\n\n\"To-night. My old woman--\"\n\n\"Oh, to hell with your old woman!\" shouted the gambler furiously. \"Do\nyou mean that you were at Judge Langham's to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes, boss; he sent for me, see? I had to go!\" explained Montgomery.\n\n\"Why did you go there without letting me know, you drunken loafer?\"\nstormed Gilmore.\n\nHe took the handy-man by the arm and pushed him into a chair, then he\nstood above him, black-browed and menacing.\n\n\"Boss, don't you blame me, it was my old woman; she wants me home with\nthe kids and her, and the judge, he says I got to go!\"\n\n\"If he wants to know why I'm keeping you here, send him round to me!\"\nsaid Gilmore.\n\n\"All right, I will.\" And Montgomery staggered to his feet.\n\nBut Gilmore pushed him back into his chair.\n\n\"What else did you talk about besides your old woman?\" asked the\ngambler, after an oppressive silence in which Montgomery heard only the\nthump of his heart against his ribs.\n\n\"I told him you'd always been like a father to me--\" said the handy-man,\nready to weep.\n\n\"I'm obliged to you for that!\" replied Gilmore with a smile of grim\nhumor.\n\n\"He said he always knowed it,\" added Montgomery, misled by the smile.\n\n\"Well, what else?\" questioned Gilmore.\n\n\"Why, I reckon that was about all!\" said Joe, who had ventured as far\nafield into the realms of fancy as his drunken faculties would allow.\n\n\"You're sure about that?\"\n\n\"I hope I may die--\"\n\n\"And the judge says you're to go home?\"\n\n\"Say, Shrimp took my old woman there, and she cried and bellered and\ncarried on awful! She loves me, boss--the judge says I'm to go home to\nher to-night or he'll have me pinched. He says that you and Marsh ain't\nto keep me here no longer!\"\n\nHis voice rose into a wail, for blind terror was laying hold of him.\nThere was something, a look on Gilmore's handsome cruel face, he did not\nunderstand but which filled him with miserable foreboding.\n\n\"What's that, about Marsh and me keeping you here?\" inquired Gilmore.\n\n\"You got to leave me loose--\"\n\n\"So you told him that?\"\n\n\"I had to tell him somethin'. My old woman made an awful fuss! They had\nto throw water on her; Shrimp took her home in an express-wagon. Hell,\nboss, I'm a married man--I got a family! I know what I ought to do, and\nI'm goin' home, the judge says I got to! Him and me talked it all over,\nand he's goin' to speak to Marsh about keepin' me here!\"\n\n\"So you've told him we keep you here?\" And the gambler glowered at him.\nHe poured himself a drink of whisky and swallowed it at a gulp. \"Well,\nwhat else did you tell him?\" he asked over the rim of his glass.\n\n\"That's about all; only me and the judge understand each other,\" said\nthe handy-man vaguely.\n\n\"Well, it was enough!\" rejoined Gilmore. \"You are sure you didn't say\nanything about North?\"\n\nMontgomery shook his head in vigorous denial.\n\n\"Sure?\" repeated Gilmore, his glance intent and piercing. \"Sure?\"\n\nA sickly pallor was overspreading the handy-man's flame-colored visage.\nIt began at his heavy puffy jaws, and diffused itself about his cheeks.\nHe could feel it spread.\n\n\"Sure?\" said the gambler. \"Sure?\"\n\nThere was an awful pause. Gilmore carefully replaced his glass on the\ntable, then he roared in a voice of thunder:\n\n\"Stand up, you hound!\"\n\nMontgomery realized that the consequences of his treachery were to be\nswift and terrible. He came slowly to his feet, but no sooner had he\ngained them than Gilmore drove his fist into his face, and he collapsed\non his chair.\n\n\"Stand up!\" roared Gilmore again.\n\nAnd again Montgomery came erect only to be knocked back into a sitting\nposture, with a long gash across his jaw where the gambler's diamond\nring had left its mark.\n\n\"I tell you, stand up!\" cried Gilmore.\n\nReaching forward he seized Montgomery by the throat with his left hand\nand jerked him to his feet, then holding him so, he coolly battered his\nface with his free hand.\n\n\"For God's sake, quit, boss--you're killin' me!\" cried Joe, as he vainly\nsought to protect his face with his arms.\n\nBut Mr. Gilmore had a primitive prejudice in favor of brute force, and\nthe cruel blows continued until Montgomery seemed to lose power even to\nattempt to shield himself; his great hands hung helpless at his side and\nhis head fell over on his shoulder. Seeing which the gambler released\nhis victim, who, limp and quivering, dropped to the floor.\n\nStill crazed with rage, Gilmore kicked the handy-man into a corner, and\nturning poured himself still another drink of whisky. If he had spoken\nthen of what was uppermost in his mind, it would have been to complain\nof the rotten luck which in so ticklish a business had furnished him\nwith fools and sots for associates. He should have known better than to\nhave trusted drunken Joe Montgomery; he should have kept out of the\nwhole business--\n\nWith the suddenness of revelation he realized his own predicament, but\nwith the realization came the knowledge that he was now hopelessly\ninvolved; that he could not go back; that he must go on, or--here he\nthrew back his shoulders as though to cast off his evil forebodings--or\nbetween the dusk of one day and the dawn of another, he might disappear\nfrom Mount Hope.\n\nWith this cheering possibility in mind, he picked up the glass of whisky\nbeside him and emptied it at a single draught, then he put on his\novercoat and hat and went from the room, locking the door behind him.\n\nPresently the wretched heap on the floor stirred and moaned feebly, and\nthen lay still. A little later it moaned again. Lifting his head he\nstared vacantly about him.\n\n\"Boss--\" he began in a tone of entreaty, but realizing that he was\nalone he fell weakly to cursing Gilmore.\n\nIt was a good five minutes from the time he recovered consciousness\nuntil he was able to assume a sitting posture, when he rested his\nbattered face in his hands and nursed his bruises.\n\n\"And me his cousin!\" he muttered, and groaned again.\n\nHe feebly wiped his bloody hands on the legs of his trousers and by an\neffort staggered to his feet. His only idea was escape; and steadying\nhimself he managed to reach the door; but the door was locked, and he\nflung himself down in a convenient chair and once more fell to nursing\nhis wounds.\n\nFifteen or twenty minutes had passed when he heard steps in the hallway.\nHe knew it was Gilmore returning, but the gambler was not alone;\nMontgomery heard him speak to his companion as a key was fitted to the\nlock. The door swung open and Gilmore, followed by Marshall Langham,\nentered the room.\n\n\"Here's the drunken hound, Marsh!\" said the gambler.\n\n\"For God's sake, boss, let me out of this!\" cried Montgomery, addressing\nhimself to Langham.\n\n\"Yes, we will--like hell!\" said Gilmore. \"By rights we ought to take you\ndown to the creek, knock you in the head and heave you in--eh, Marsh?\nThat's about the size of what we _ought_ to do!\"\n\nLangham's face was white and drawn with apprehension, yet he surveyed\nthe ruin the gambler had wrought with something like pity.\n\n\"Why, what's happened to him, Andy?\" he asked.\n\nHis companion laughed brutally.\n\n\"Oh, I punched him up some, I couldn't keep my hands off him, I only\nwonder I didn't kill him--\"\n\n\"Let me out of this, boss--\" whined the handy-man.\n\n\"Shut up, you!\" said the gambler roughly.\n\nHe drew back his hand, but Langham caught his arm.\n\n\"Don't do that, Andy!\" he said. \"He isn't in any shape to stand much\nmore of that; and what's the use, the harm's done!\"\n\nThe gambler scowled on his cousin Joe with moody resentment.\n\n\"All the same I've got a good notion to finish the job!\" he said.\n\n\"Let me go home, boss!\" entreated Montgomery, still addressing himself\nto Langham. \"God's sake, he pretty near killed me!\"\n\nHe stood up on shaking legs.\n\nWretched, abject, his uneasy glance shifted first from one to the other\nof his patrons, who were now his judges, and for aught he knew would be\nhis executioners as well. The gambler glared back at him with an\nexpression of set ferocity which told him he need expect no mercy from\nthat source; but with Langham it was different; he at least was not\nwantonly brutal. The sight of physical suffering always distressed him\nand Joe's bruised and bloody face was more than he could bear to look\nat.\n\n\"For two cents I'd knock him on the head!\" jerked out Gilmore.\n\n\"Oh, quit, Andy; let him alone! I want to ask him a question or two,\"\nsaid Langham.\n\n\"You'll never know from him what he said or didn't say--you'll learn\nthat from the judge himself,\" and Gilmore laughed harshly.\n\nA minute or two passed before Langham could trust himself to speak. When\nhe did, he turned to Montgomery to ask:\n\n\"I wish you'd tell me as nearly as you can what you said to my father?\"\n\n\"I didn't go there to tell him anything, boss; he just got it out of me.\nWhat chance has a slob like me with him?\"\n\n\"Got what out of you?\" questioned Langham in a low voice.\n\n\"Well, he didn't get much, boss,\" replied Montgomery, shaking his head.\n\n\"But what did you tell him?\" insisted Langham.\n\n\"I don't remember, boss, I was full, see--and maybe I said too much and\nthen agin maybe I didn't!\"\n\n\"I hope you like this, Marsh; it's the sort of thing I been up against,\"\nsaid Gilmore.\n\nBy way of answer Langham made a weary gesture. The horror of the\nsituation was now a thing beyond fear.\n\n\"I'm for sending the drunken loafer to the other side of the continent,\"\nsaid Gilmore.\n\n\"What's the use of that?\" asked Langham dully.\n\n\"Every use,\" rejoined Gilmore with fresh confidence. \"It's enough, ain't\nit, that he's talked to your father; we can't take chances on his\ntalking to any one else. There's the west-bound express; I'm for putting\nhim on that--there's time enough. We can give him a couple of hundred\ndollars and that will be the end of him, for if he ever shows his face\nhere in Mount Hope, I'll break every bone in his body. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right!\" And Langham glanced uncertainly at the\nhandy-man.\n\n\"Well, it's either that, or else I can knock him over the head. Perhaps\nyou had rather do that, it's more in your line.\"\n\n\"Boss, you give me the money and let me go now, and I won't _ever_ come\nback!\" cried Montgomery eagerly. \"I been lookin' for the chance to get\nclear of this bum town! I'll stay away, don't you lose no sleep about\nthat; I ain't got nothin' to ever bring me back.\"\n\nAnd on the moment Mr. Montgomery banished from his mind and heart all\nidea of the pure joys of domestic life. It was as if his old woman had\nnever been. He was sure travel was what he required, and a great deal\nof it, and all in one direction--away from Mount Hope.\n\nNo unnecessary time was wasted on Montgomery's appearance. A wet towel\nin the not too gentle hands of Mr. Gilmore removed the blood stains from\nhis face, and then he was led forth into the night,--the night which so\ncompletely swallowed up all trace of him that his old woman and her\nbrood sought his accustomed haunts in vain. Nor was Mr. Moxlow any more\nsuccessful in his efforts to discover the handy-man's whereabouts. As\nfor Mount Hope she saw in the mysterious disappearance of the star\nwitness only the devious activities of John North's friends.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nFATHER AND SON\n\n\nWhile Mr. Gilmore was an exceedingly capable accomplice, at once\nresourceful, energetic, unsentimental and conscienceless, he yet\ncombined with these solid merits, certain characteristics which rendered\nuninterrupted intercourse with him a horror and a shame to Marshall\nLangham who was daily and almost hourly paying the price the gambler had\nset on his silence. And what a price it was! Gilmore was his master,\ncoarse, brutal, and fiercely exacting. How he hated him, and yet how\nnecessary he had become; for the gambler never faltered, was never\nuncertain; he met each difficulty with a callous readiness which Langham\nknew he himself would utterly have lacked. He decided this was because\nGilmore was without imagination, since in his own many fearful, doubting\nmoments, he saw always what he had come to believe as the inevitable\ntime when the wicked fabric they were building would collapse like a\nhouse of cards in a gale of wind, and his terrible secret would be\nrevealed to all men.\n\nAll this while, step by step, Gilmore, without haste but without pause,\nwas moving toward his desires. He came and went in the Langham house as\nif he were master there.\n\nWhen Marshall had first informed Evelyn that he expected to have Mr.\nGilmore in to dinner, there had been a scene, and she had threatened to\nappeal to the judge; but he told her fiercely that he would bring home\nwhom he pleased, that it suited him to be decent to Andy and that was\nall there was to it. And apparently she soon found something to like in\nthis strange intimate of her husband's; at least she had made no protest\nafter the gambler's first visit to the house.\n\nOn his part Gilmore was quickly conscious of the subtle encouragement\nshe extended him. She understood him, she saw into his soul, she divined\nhis passion for her and she was not shocked by it. In his unholy musings\nhe told himself that here was a woman who was dead game--and a lady,\ntoo, with all the pretty ways and refinements that were so lacking in\nthe other women he had known.\n\nMontgomery was some two days gone toward the West and Gilmore had\ndropped around ostensibly to see Marshall Langham, but in reality to\nmake love to Marshall Langham's wife, when the judge, looking gray and\nold, walked in on the little group unobserved. He paused for an instant\nnear the door.\n\nEvelyn was seated before the piano and Gilmore was bending above her,\nwhile Marshall, with an unread book in his hands and with a half-smoked\ncigar between his teeth, was lounging in front of the fire. The judge's\nglance rested questioningly on Gilmore, but only for a moment. Then an\nangry flame of recognition colored his thin cheeks.\n\nAware now of his father's presence, Marshall tossed aside his book and\nquitted his chair. For two days he had been dreading this meeting, and\nfor two days he had done what he could to avert it.\n\n\"You must have had a rather cold walk, father; let me draw a chair up\nclose to the fire for you,\" he said.\n\nEvelyn had risen to greet the judge, while the gambler turned to give\nhim an easy nod. A smile hid itself in the shadow of his black mustache;\nhe was feeling very sure of himself and surer still of Evelyn. The\ndisfavor or approval of this slight man of sixty meant nothing to him.\n\n\"How do you do, sir!\" said the judge with icy civility.\n\nHad he met Gilmore on the street he would not have spoken to him. As he\nslowly withdrew his eyes from the gambler, he said to his son:\n\n\"Can you spare me a moment or two, Marshall?\"\n\n\"Come into the library,\" and Marshall led the way from the room.\n\nThey walked the length of the hall in silence, Marshall a step or two in\nadvance of the judge. He knew his father was there on no trivial errand.\nThis visit was the result of his interview with Joe Montgomery. How\nmuch had the handy-man told him? This was the question that had been\nrevolving in his mind for the last two days, and he was about to find an\nanswer to it.\n\nThe father and son entered the room, each heavily preoccupied. Marshall\nseated himself and stared moodily into the fire. Already the judge had\nfound a chair and his glance was fixed on the carpet at his feet.\nPresently looking up he asked:\n\n\"Will you be good enough to tell me what that fellow is doing here?\"\n\n\"Andy?\"\n\nThe single word came from Langham as with a weary acceptance of his\nfather's anger.\n\n\"Yes, certainly--Gilmore--of whom do you imagine me to be speaking?\"\n\n\"Give a dog a bad name--\"\n\n\"He has earned his name. I had heard something of this but did not\ncredit it!\" said the judge.\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n\"Perhaps you will be good enough to explain how I happen to meet that\nfellow here?\"\n\nThe judge regarded his son fixedly. There had always existed a cordial\nfrankness in their intercourse, for though the judge was a man of few\nintimacies, family ties meant much to him, and these ties were now all\ncentered in his son. He had shown infinite patience with Marshall's\nturbulent youth; an even greater patience with his dissipated manhood;\nhe believed that in spite of the terrible drafts he was making on his\nenergies, his future would not be lacking in solid and worthy\nachievement. In his own case the traditional vice of the Langhams had\npassed him by. He was grateful for this, but it had never provoked in\nhim any spirit of self-righteousness; indeed, it had only made him the\nmore tender in his judgment of his son's lapses.\n\n\"Marshall--\" and the tone of anger had quite faded from his\nvoice--\"Marshall, what is that fellow's hold on you?\"\n\n\"You would not appreciate Andy's peculiar virtues even if I were to try\nto describe them,\" said Marshall with a smile of sardonic humor.\n\n\"Do you consider him the right sort of a person to bring into your\nhome?\"\n\n\"It won't hurt him!\" said Marshall.\n\nThe judge, with a look on his face that mingled astonishment and injury,\nsank back in his chair. He never attempted anything that even faintly\nsuggested flippancy, and he was unappreciative of this tendency in\nothers.\n\n\"You have not told me what this fellow's hold on you is?\" he said, after\na moment's silence.\n\n\"Oh, he's done me one or two good turns.\"\n\n\"You mean in the way of money?\"\n\nMarshall nodded.\n\n\"Are you in his debt now, may I ask?\"\n\n\"No,\" and Marshall moved restlessly.\n\n\"Are you quite frank with me, Marshall?\" asked the judge with that rare\ngentleness of voice and manner that only his son knew.\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Because it would be better to make every sacrifice and be rid of the\nobligation.\"\n\nAnother long pause followed in which there came to the ears of the two\nmen the sound of a noisy waltz that Evelyn was playing. Again it was the\njudge who broke the oppressive silence.\n\n\"I came here to-night, Marshall, because there is a matter I must\ndiscuss with you. Perhaps you will tell me what you and Gilmore have\ndone with Joe Montgomery?\"\n\nMarshall had sought to prepare himself against the time when this very\nquestion should be asked him, but the color left his cheeks.\n\n\"I don't think I know what you mean,\" he said slowly.\n\nHis father made an impatient gesture.\n\n\"Don't tell me that! What has become of Montgomery? Look at me! Two\nnights ago he came to see me; I had sent for him; I had learned from\nNellie that he had practically deserted her. I learned further from the\nman himself that you and Gilmore were largely responsible for this.\"\n\n\"He was drunk, of course.\"\n\n\"He had been drinking--yes--\"\n\n\"Doesn't that explain his remarkable statement? What reason could Andy\nor any one have for wishing to keep him from his wife?\" asked Marshall\nwho had recovered his accustomed steadiness.\n\n\"He was ready with an answer for that question when I asked it. Do you\nwish to know what that answer was?\" said the judge.\n\nMarshall did not trust himself to speak; he felt the judge's eyes on him\nand could not meet them. He saw himself cowering there in his chair with\nhis guilt stamped large on every feature. His throat was dry and his\nlips were parched, he did not know whether he could speak. His shoulders\ndrooped and his chin rested on his breast. What was the use--was it\nworth the struggle? Suppose Montgomery, in spite of his promises, came\nback to Mount Hope, suppose Gilmore's iron nerve failed him!\n\n\"You don't answer me, Marshall,\" said the judge.\n\n\"I don't understand you--\" evaded Marshall.\n\n\"From my soul I wish I could believe you!\" exclaimed his father. \"If\nit's not debt, what is the nature of your discreditable connection with\nGilmore?\"\n\nMarshall glanced up quickly; he seemed to breathe again; perhaps after\nall Montgomery had said less than he supposed him to have said!\n\n\"I have already told you that I owe Gilmore nothing!\"\n\n\"I should be glad to think it, but I warn you to stand clear of him and\nhis concerns, for I am going to investigate the truth of Montgomery's\nstory,\" declared the judge.\n\n\"What did he tell you?\" Marshall spoke with an effort.\n\n\"That his evidence in the North case was false, that it was inspired by\nGilmore.\"\n\nMarshall passed a shaking hand across his face.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said.\n\n\"His story will be worth looking into. He stood for the truth of what he\nsaid in part, he insisted that he saw a man cross McBride's shed on the\nnight of the murder and drop into the alley, and the man was not John\nNorth. He seemed unwilling that North, through any instrumentality of\nhis, should suffer for a crime of which he was innocent; his feeling on\nthis point was unfeigned and unmistakable.\"\n\nThere was silence again, while the two men stared at each other. From\nthe parlor the jarring sound of the music reached them, inconceivably\nout of harmony with the seriousness of their mood.\n\n\"I have wished to take no action in the matter of Montgomery's\ndisappearance until I saw you, Marshall,\" said the judge. \"I have been\nsick with this thing! Now I am going to lay such facts as I have before\nMoxlow.\"\n\nMarshall stared moodily into the fire. He told himself that the\nprosecuting attorney would be in great luck if he got anything out of\nGilmore.\n\n\"I purpose to suggest to Moxlow a fresh line of investigation where this\nimportant witness is concerned, and Mr. Gilmore as the man most likely\nto clear up the mystery surrounding his disappearance from Mount Hope.\nWe may not be able to get anything very tangible out of him in the way\nof information, but I imagine we may cause him some little anxiety and\nannoyance. You can't afford to be mixed up in this affair, and I warn\nyou again to stand clear of Gilmore! If there is any truth in\nMontgomery's statement it can only have the most sinister significance,\nfor I don't need to tell you that some powerful motive must be back of\nGilmore's activity. If North was not responsible for McBride's death,\nwhere do the indications all point? Who more likely to commit such a\ncrime than a social outcast--a man plying an illegal trade in defiance\nof the laws?\"\n\n\"Hush! For God's sake speak lower!\" cried Marshall, giving way to an\nuncontrollable emotion of terror.\n\nRacked and shaken, he stared about him as if he feared another presence\nin the room. The judge leaned forward and rested a thin hand on his\nson's knee.\n\n\"Marshall, what do you know of Gilmore's connection with this matter?\"\n\n\"I want him let alone! To lay such stress on Montgomery's drunken talk\nis absurd!\"\n\nThe judge's lips met in a determined line.\n\n\"I scarcely expected to hear that from you! I am not likely, as you\nknow, to be influenced in the discharge of my duty by any private\nconsideration.\"\n\nHe quitted his chair and stood erect, his figure drawn to its fullest\nheight.\n\n\"Wait--I didn't mean that,\" protested Marshall.\n\nThe judge resumed his chair.\n\n\"What did you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\"What's the use of throwing Moxlow off on a fresh scent?\"\n\n\"That's a very remarkable point of view!\" said the judge, with a\nmirthless laugh.\n\nIn the utter selfishness that his fear had engendered, it seemed a\nmonstrous thing to Langham that any one should wish to clear North, in\nwhose conviction lay his own salvation. More than this, he had every\nreason to hate North, and if he were hanged it would be but a roundabout\nmeting out of justice for that hideous wrong he had done him, the shame\nof which was ever present. He saw one other thing clearly, the necessity\nthat Gilmore should be left alone; for the very moment the gambler felt\nthe judge was moving against him, that moment would come his fierce\ndemands that he be called off--that Marshall quiet him, no matter how.\n\n\"Have you been near North since his arrest?\" asked the judge, apparently\nspeaking at random.\n\n\"No,\" said Marshall.\n\n\"May I ask if you are offended because of his choice of counsel?\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" said the younger man, moving\nimpatiently in his chair.\n\n\"I do not like your attitude in this matter, Marshall; I like it as\nlittle as I understand it. But I have given my warning. Keep clear of\nthat fellow Gilmore, do not involve yourself in his fortunes, or the\nresult may prove disastrous to you!\"\n\n\"I want him let alone!\" said Marshall doggedly, speaking with desperate\nresolution.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the judge.\n\n\"Because it is better for all concerned; you--you don't know what you're\nmeddling with--\"\n\nHe quitted his chair and fell to pacing to and fro. His father's glance,\nuncertain and uneasy, followed him as he crossed and recrossed the room.\n\n\"I find I can not agree with you, Marshall!\" said the judge at length.\n\"I do not like hints, and unless you can deal with me with greater\nfrankness than you have yet done, there is not much use in prolonging\nthis discussion.\"\n\n\"As you like, then,\" replied Marshall, wheeling on him with sudden\nrecklessness. \"I want to tell you just this--you'll not hurt Gilmore,\nbut--\"\n\nWords failed him, and his voice died away on his white and twitching\nlips into an inarticulate murmur.\n\nHe struggled vainly to recover the mastery of himself, but his fear, now\nthe growth of his many days and nights of torture, would not let him\nfinish what he had started to say.\n\n\"Very good, I don't want to hurt anybody, but I do want to find that\nman, whoever he is, that you and Gilmore are shielding; the man Joe\nMontgomery saw cross those sheds the night of the murder; I am going to\nbend my every energy to learning who that man is, and when I have\ndiscovered his identity--\"\n\n\"You'll want to see him in North's place, will you?\" asked Marshall. The\nwords came from him in a hoarse whisper and his arm was extended\nthreateningly toward his father. \"You're sure about that? You can't\nconceive of the possibility that you'd be glad not to know? You want to\nhave John North out of his cell and this other man there in his place;\nyou want to face him day after day in the court room--you're sure?\" His\nshaking arm continued to menace the judge. \"Well, you don't need to find\nMontgomery, and you don't need to hound Gilmore; I can tell you more\nthan they can--\"\n\nHis bloodshot eyes, fixed and staring, seemed starting from their\nsockets.\n\n\"The facts you want to know are hidden here!\" He struck his hand\nsavagely against his breast and lurched half-way across the room, then\nhe swung about and once more faced the judge. \"Why haven't you had the\nwisdom to keep out of this,--or have you expected to find some one it\nwould be easier to pronounce sentence on than North? Did you think it\nwould be Gilmore?\"\n\nHe scowled down on his father. It was appalling and unnatural, after all\nhis frightful suffering, his fear, and his remorse which never left him,\nthat his safety should be jeopardized by his own father! He had only\nasked that the law be left to deal with John North, who, he believed,\nhad so wronged him that no death he could die would atone for the injury\nhe had done.\n\nSlowly but inexorably the full significance of Marshall's words dawned\non the judge. He had risen from his chair dumb and terror-stricken. For\na moment they stood without speech, each staring into the other's face.\nPresently the judge stole to Marshall's side.\n\n\"Tell me that I misunderstand you!\" he whispered in entreaty, resting a\ntremulous hand on his son's arm.\n\nBut the latter was bitterly resentful. His father had forced this\nconfession, from him, he had given him no choice!\n\n\"Why should I tell you that now?\" he asked, as he roughly shook off his\nfather's hand.\n\n\"Tell me I misunderstand you!\" repeated the judge, in a tone of abject\nentreaty.\n\n\"It's too late!\" said Marshall, his voice a mere whisper between parched\nlips. He tossed up his arms in a gesture that betokened his utter\nweariness of soul. \"My God, how I've suffered!\" he said chokingly, and\nhis eyes were wet with the sudden anguish of self-pity.\n\n\"Marshall!\"\n\nThe judge spoke in protest of his words. Marshall turned abruptly from\nhim and crossed the room. The spirit of his fierce resentment was dying\nwithin him, for, after all, what did it signify how his father learned\nhis secret!\n\nFrom the parlor there still came the strains of light music; these and\nMarshall's echoing tread as he strode to and fro, filled in the ghastly\nsilence that succeeded. Then at length he paused before his father, and\nonce more they looked deep into each other's eyes, and the little space\nbetween was for both as an open grave filled with dead things--hopes,\nambitions, future days and months and years--days and months and years\nwhen they should be for ever mindful of his crime! For henceforth they\nwere to dwell in the chill of this direful shadow that would tower above\nall the concerns of life whether great or small; that would add despair\nto every sorrow, and take the very soul and substance from every joy.\n\nThe judge dropped into his chair, but his wavering glance still searched\nhis son's face for some sign that should tell him, not what he already\nknew but what he hoped might be,--that Marshall was either drunk or\ncrazed; but he only saw there the reflection of his own terror. He\nburied his head in his hands and bitter age-worn sobs shook his bent\nshoulders. After a moment of sullen waiting for him to recover, Marshall\napproached and touched him on the arm.\n\n\"Father--\" he whispered gently.\n\nThe judge glanced up.\n\n\"It's a lie, Marshall!\"\n\nBut Marshall only stared at him until the judge again covered his face\nwith his hands.\n\nWhen he glanced up a few moments later, he found himself alone. Marshall\nhad stolen from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n\nSHRIMPLIN TO THE RESCUE\n\n\nBeyond the flats and the railroad tracks and over across the new high,\niron bridge, was a low-lying region much affected by the drivers of\ndump-carts, whose activity was visibly attested by the cinders, the\nashes, the tin cans, the staved-in barrels and the lidless boxes that\neverywhere met the eye.\n\nOn the verge of this waste, which civilization had builded and shaped\nwith its discarded odds and ends, were the meager beginnings of a poor\nsuburb. Here an enterprising landlord had erected a solitary row of\nslab-sided dwellings of a uniform ugliness; and had given to each a\nsingle coat of yellow paint of such exceeding thinness, that it was\npossible to determine by the whiter daubs of putty showing through, just\nwhere every nail had been driven.\n\nOnly the very poorest or the most shiftless of Mount Hope's population\nfound a refuge in this quarter. The Montgomerys being strictly eligible,\nit was but natural that Joe should have taken up his abode here on the\nday the first of the eight houses had been finished. Joe was burdened by\nno troublesome convictions touching the advantages of a gravelly soil\nor a southern exposure, and the word sanitation had it been spoken in\nhis presence would have conveyed no meaning to his mind. He had never\nheard of germs, and he had as little prejudice concerning stagnant water\nas he had predilection for clear water. He knew in a general way that\nall water was wet, but further than this he gave the element no thought.\n\nThus it came about that his was the very oldest family seated in this\ndelectable spot. The young Montgomerys could with perfect propriety\nclaim precedence at all the stagnant pools that offered superior\nadvantages as yielding a rich harvest of tadpoles. While the mature\nintelligence might have considered these miniature lakes as highly\nundesirable, the young Montgomerys were not unmindful of their\nblessings. As babies, clothed in shapeless garments, they launched upon\nthe green slime their tiny fleet of chips, and, grown a little older, it\nwas here they waded in the happy summer days. The very dump-carts came\nand went like perpetual argosies, bringing riches--discarded furniture\nand cast-off clothing--to their very door.\n\nIn merciful defiance of those hidden perils that lurk where sanitation\nand hygiene are unpractised sciences, Joe's numerous family throve and\nmultiplied. The baby carriage which had held his firstborn,--Arthur, now\naged fourteen,--was still in use, the luster of its paint much dimmed\nand its upholstery but a memory. It had trundled a succession of little\nMontgomerys among the cinder piles; indeed, it was almost a feature of\nthe landscape, for Joe's family was his chiefest contribution to the\nwealth of his country.\n\nThere had been periods varying from a few days to a few weeks when the\nMontgomerys were sole tenants of that row of slab-sided houses; their\npoverty being a fixed condition, they were merely sometimes poorer. No\ntransient gleam of a larger prosperity had ever illuminated the horizon\nof their lives, and they had never been tempted to move to other parts\nof the town where the ground and the rents were higher.\n\nResidents of this locality, not being burdened with any means of\nlocomotion beyond their own legs, usually came and went by way of the\nhigh iron bridge; their legal right of way however was by a neglected\nthoroughfare that had ambitiously set out to be a street, but having\nfailed of its intention, presently dwindled to a pleasant country road\nwhich not far beyond crossed the river by the old wooden bridge below\nthe depot.\n\nIt was the iron bridge which Mrs. Montgomery, escorted by the daring\nShrimplin, had crossed that fateful night of her interview with Judge\nLangham, and it was toward it that her glance was turned for many days\nafter in the hope that she might see Joe's bulk of bone and muscle as he\nslouched in the direction of the home and family he had so wanted only\nforsaken. But a veil of mystery obscured every fact that bore on the\nhandy-man's disappearance; no eye penetrated it, no hand lifted it.\n\nSoon after Montgomery's disappearance his deserted wife fell upon evil\ntimes indeed. In spite of her bravest efforts the rent fell hopelessly\nin arrears. For a time her pride kept her away from the Shrimplins, who\nmight have helped her. To go to the little lamplighter's was to hear\nbitter truths about her husband; Mr. Shrimplin's denunciations were\nespecially fierce and scathing, for here he felt that righteousness was\nall on his side and that in abusing the absconding Joe he was performing\na moral act.\n\nBut at last Nellie's fortunes reached a crisis. An obdurate landlord set\nher few poor belongings in the gutter. Even in the most prosperous days\ntheir roof-tree had flourished but precariously and now it was down and\nlevel with the dust; seeing which Mrs. Montgomery placed her youngest in\nthe ancient vehicle which had trundled all that generation of\nMontgomerys, drew her apron before her eyes and wept. But quickly\nrallying to the need for immediate action she swallowed her pride and\nsent Arthur in quest of his uncle, who was well fitted by sobriety,\nindustry and thrift, to cope with such a crisis.\n\nMr. Shrimplin's only weaknesses were such as spring from an eager\nchildlike vanity, and a nature as shy as a fawn's of whatever held even\na suggestion of danger. To Custer he could brag of crimes he had never\ncommitted, but an unpaid butcher's bill would have robbed him of his\nsleep; also he wore a very tender heart in his narrow chest, though he\ndid his best to hide it by assuming a bold and hardy air and by\ngarnishing his conversation with what he counted the very flower of a\nbrutal worldly cynicism.\n\nThus it was that when Arthur had found his uncle and had stated his\ncase, Mr. Shrimplin instantly summoned to his aid all his redoubtable\npowers of speech and fell to cursing the recreant husband and father.\nHaving eased himself in this manner, and not wishing Arthur to be\nentirely unmindful of his vast superiority, he called the boy's\nattention to the undeniable fact that he, Shrimplin, could have been\nkicked out of doors and Joe Montgomery would not have lifted a hand to\nsave him. Yet all this while the little lamplighter, with the boy at his\nheels, was moving rapidly across the flats.\n\nFrom the town end of the bridge, youthful eyes had descried his coming\nand the word was quickly passed that the uncle of all the little\nMontgomerys was approaching, presumably with philanthropic intent. This\nrumor instantly stimulated an interest on the part of the adult\npopulation, an interest which had somewhat languished owing to the\nincapacity of human nature to sustain an emotional climax for any\nconsiderable length of time. Untidy women and idle-looking men with the\nrust of inaction consuming them, quickly appeared on the scene, and when\nthe little lamplighter descended from the railway tracks it was to be\ngreeted with something like an ovation at the hands of his\nsister-in-law's neighbors.\n\nHis ears caught the murmur of approval that passed from lip to lip and\nout of the very tail of his bleached eyes he noted the expression of\nsatisfaction that was on every face. Even the previously obdurate\nlandlord met him with words of apology and conciliation. It was a happy\nmoment for Mr. Shrimplin, but not by so much as the flicker of an\neyelash did he betray that this was so. He had considered himself such a\npublic character since the night of the McBride murder that he now\ndeemed it incumbent to preserve a stoic manner; the admiration of his\nfellows could win nothing from the sternness of his nature, so he\nignored the neighbors, while he was barely civil to the landlord. The\nbig roll of bills which, with something of a flourish, he produced from\nthe pocket of his greasy overalls, settled the rent, and the neighbors\nnoted with bated breath that the size of this roll was not perceptibly\ndiminished by the transaction.\n\nPresently Mr. Shrimplin found himself standing alone with Nellie; the\nlandlord had departed with his money, while the neighbors, having\ndevoted the greater part of the day to a sympathetic interest in Mrs.\nMontgomery's fortunes, now had leisure for their own affairs.\n\n\"Why didn't you send for me sooner?\" demanded the little man with some\nasperity. \"No sense in having your things put out like this when you\nonly got to put them back again!\"\n\n\"If Joe was only here this would never have happened!\" said Mrs.\nMontgomery, giving way to copious tears.\n\nBut Mr. Shrimplin seemed not so sure of this. The settling of the\nhandy-man's difficulties had been one of the few extravagances he had\npermitted himself. His glance now fell on the small occupant of the\ndecrepit baby carriage, and he gave a start of astonishment.\n\n\"Lord!\" he ejaculated, pointing to the child. \"You don't mean to tell me\nthat's yours, too?\"\n\n\"Three weeks next Sunday,\" said Mrs. Montgomery.\n\n\"Another one,--well, I don't wonder you've kept still about it! What's\nthe use of bringing children into the world when you can't half take\ncare of 'em?\"\n\n\"I didn't keep still about it,--only I had so much to worry me!\" said\nNellie, with a shadowy sort of resentment at the little lamplighter's\nwords and manner.\n\n\"It's a nice-looking baby!\" admitted Mr. Shrimplin, relenting.\n\n\"It's a boy, see--he's got his father's eyes and nose--\"\n\n\"I don't know about the eyes, but the nose is a durn sight whiter than\nJoe's! Maybe, though, when it's Joe's age it will use the same brand of\npaint.\"\n\n\"What you got it in for Joe for? He never done nothing to you!\" said\nJoe's wife, with palpable offense.\n\n\"He ought to be stood up and lammed over the head with a club!\" observed\nMr. Shrimplin, with considerable acrimony of tone. \"You'd have thought\nthat being a witness would have made a man out of Joe if anything\nwould,--and how does he act? Why, he lights out; he gets to be good for\nsomething beside soaking up whisky and spoiling his insides, and he\nskips the town; now if that ain't a devil of a way for him to act, I'd\nlike to know what you call it!\"\n\n\"He was a good man--\" declared Mrs. Montgomery with conviction. \"A good\nman, but unfortunate!\"\n\n\"Well, if he suits you, Nellie--\"\n\n\"He does!\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" retorted Mr. Shrimplin, taking a chew of tobacco. \"For\nI don't reckon he'd ever suit any one else!\"\n\n\"You and none of my family never liked Joe!\" said Mrs. Montgomery.\n\n\"Well, why should we?\" demanded Mr. Shrimplin impatiently.\n\n\"Your wife,--my own sister, too,--said he should never darken her door,\nand he was that proud he never did! You couldn't have dragged him\nthere!\" said Mrs. Montgomery, and the ready tears dimmed her eyes.\n\n\"And you couldn't have dragged him away quick enough if he had a-come!\nNow don't you get tearful over Joe, you can't call him no prodigal; his\nveal's tough old beef by this time! But I never had nothing in\nparticular against him more than I thought he ought to be kicked clean\noff the face of the earth!\" said Mr. Shrimplin, rolling his drooping\nflaxen mustache fiercely between his stubby thumb and its neighboring\nforefinger.\n\nSuch personal relations as the little lamplighter had sustained with the\nhandy-man had invariably been of the most friendly and pacific\ndescription. Esteeming Joe a gentleman of uncertain habits, and of\ncriminal instincts that might at any moment be translated into vigorous\naction, Mr. Shrimplin had always been at much pains to placate him. In\nthe heat of the moment, however, all this was forgotten, and Mr.\nShrimplin's love of decency and rectitude promptly asserted itself.\n\n\"It's easy enough to pick flaws in a popular good-looking man like Joe!\"\nsaid Mrs. Montgomery, with whom time and absence had been at work, also,\nand to such an extent that the first dim glint of a halo was beginning\nto fix itself about the curly red head of her delinquent spouse.\n\n\"And a whole lot of good them good looks of his has done you, Nellie,\"\nrejoined Mr. Shrimplin, with a little cackle of mirth.\n\n\"He never even seen his youngest!\" said Mrs. Montgomery, giving\ncompletely away to tears at this moving thought of the handy-man's\ndeprivation.\n\n\"I reckon he could even stand that,\" observed Mr. Shrimplin unfeelingly.\n\"I bet he never knowed 'em apart.\"\n\n\"Why he was just wrapped up in them and me,--just wrapped up!\" cried\nMrs. Montgomery.\n\n\"Well, he had a blame curious way of showing it; no one would ever have\nsuspected it of him!\" said Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"I guess this wouldn't have happened if his own folks had had more faith\nin Joe, that's what wore on him,--I seen it wear on him!\" declared Mrs.\nMontgomery, in a tone of melancholy conviction.\n\n\"In the main I'm a truthful man, Nellie,--I wish to be anyhow; and I'll\ntell you honest I was never able to see much in Joe aside from his good\nlooks, which I know he had, now that you call them to mind. No,--I think\na coat of tar and feathers would be about the thing for Joe; he's the\nsort of bird to wear that kind of plumage. My opinion is that you've\nseen the last of him; no sense in your thinking otherwise, because\nyou're just leaving yourself open to disappointment!\"\n\nYet Mr. Shrimplin remained to reinstate Mrs. Montgomery in her home. It\nwas his expert hands that set up the cracked and rusted kitchen stove,\nand arranged the scanty and battered furniture in the several rooms. Nor\nwas he satisfied to do merely this, for he presently despatched Arthur\ninto town after an excellent assortment of groceries. All the while,\nhowever, he neglected no opportunity to elaborate for Nellie's benefit\nhis opinions concerning the handy-man's utter worthlessness. At length\nthis good Samaritan paused from his labors, and regaling himself with a\nfresh chew of tobacco and a parting gibe at Joe, set briskly off for his\nown home.\n\nThe street lamps demanded his immediate attention, and it was not until\nhis day's work was finished that he found opportunity to tell Mrs.\nShrimplin of these straits to which Nellie had been reduced. He\nconcluded by reiterating his opinion that her sister had seen the last\nof Joe.\n\n\"I don't know why you say that!\" was Mrs. Shrimplin's unexpected\nrejoinder.\n\n\"Ain't I got mighty good reason to say it?\" asked her husband. \"Don't\nyou know, and ain't every one always said Joe was just too low to live?\nI'd like to know if it wasn't you said he should never set his foot\ninside your door?\"\n\n\"I might say it again, and then I mightn't,\" rejoined Mrs. Shrimplin,\nwith aggravating composure.\n\nTwo days later when the Shrimplins were at breakfast Mrs. Montgomery\nwalked in on them. Her face was streaked with the traces of recent\ntears, but there was the light of happy vindication in her eyes, and a\nsoiled and crumpled letter in her hand.\n\n\"Mercy, Nellie!\" exclaimed her sister. \"What's the matter now?\"\n\n\"Matter? Why, I'm so happy I just don't know what to do! I've heard from\nmy Joe!\"\n\nMrs. Shrimplin rested her hands on her hips and surveyed Nellie with\neyes that seemed to hold pity and contempt in about equal proportion.\n\n\"You've heard from Joe! Well, if he was my husband he'd have heard from\nme long ago!\" she said.\n\nAnd it occurred to Mr. Shrimplin that his wife was wonderfully\nconsistent in her inconsistencies.\n\n\"Well, and what have _you_ got against Joe?\" demanded Mrs. Montgomery\nwith ready anger.\n\n\"She ain't got nothing new, Nellie!\" said Mr. Shrimplin, desirous of\npreserving the peace.\n\n\"Well, she's mighty quick to misjudge him! Look!\" and she drew from the\nenvelope she held in her hand a dirty greenback. \"He's sent me twenty\ndollars--my man has! Does that look like he'd forgotten me or his\nchildren?\" protested Nellie, in a voice of happy triumph.\n\n\"I'll bet it's counterfeit; I'd go slow on trying to pass it,\" said Mr.\nShrimplin when he had somewhat recovered from the shock of the sudden\nannouncement.\n\nIt was plain that Nellie had never thought of any such possibility as\nthis, for the light died out of her eyes.\n\n\"How can I find out whether it's good or not?\" she faltered.\n\n\"Let me look at it!\" said Mr. Shrimplin.\n\nMrs. Montgomery placed the bill in his hands. Her face was keen and\npinched with anxiety as she awaited the little man's verdict.\n\n\"It's genu-ine all right,\" he at length admitted grudgingly.\n\n\"I knew it was!\" cried Nellie, her miserable suspicions put at rest.\n\n\"Well, you'd better spend it quick and get some good of it before old\nJoe comes back and wants the change!\" advised Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"What does he say?\" questioned Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\n\"He don't say a word, there was nothing but the bill.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe it wasn't Joe sent it after all!\" said the little\nlamplighter.\n\n\"The writing on the envelope's his, I'd know it anywhere. I guess he\ncouldn't trust himself to write; but he'll come back, my man will! Maybe\nhe's on his way now!\" exclaimed Nellie.\n\n\"Ain't there no postmark?\" asked Mrs. Shrimplin.\n\n\"Why, I never thought to look!\"\n\nBut Nellie's face fell when she did look.\n\n\"It was mailed at Denver!\" she said, in an awe-struck voice.\n\nHer man seemed at the very ends of the earth, and his return became a\ndoubtful thing.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't talk about this to the police or anybody; they ain't\nbeen able to find Joe, and I wouldn't be the one to tell them where he's\nat!\" advised Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"They've stopped coming to the house,\" said Nellie.\n\nBut she looked inquiringly at Mr. Shrimplin. Where the police were\nconcerned she had faith in his masculine understanding; Joe had always\nseemed to know a great deal about the police, she remembered.\n\n\"I reckon old Joe had his own reasons for skipping out, and they must\nhave looked good to him. No, I can't see that you are bound to help the\npolice; the police ain't helped you.\" And Mr. Shrimplin returned to the\nscrutiny of the bill in his hand.\n\nThat was the profound mystery. No one knew better than he that Joe was\nnot given to such prodigal generosity; neither were twenty-dollar bills\nfrequent with him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n\nTHE CAT AND THE MOUSE\n\n\nMr. Gilmore, having yielded once again to temptation, found himself at\nMarshall Langham's door. He asked for the lawyer, but was informed he\nwas not at home, a fact of which Mr. Gilmore was perfectly well aware,\nsince he had parted from him not twenty minutes before at the\ncourt-house steps. Mrs. Langham was at home, however, and at this\nwelcome information the gambler, smiling, strode into the hall.\n\nFrom the parlor, Evelyn heard his voice. She had found him amusing in\nthe first days of their acquaintance, and possibly she might again find\nhim diverting, but this afternoon he had chosen ill for his call. She\nwas quite sure she detested him. For the first time she measured him by\nstandards of which he could know nothing, and found no good thing in\nhim. What had Marsh meant when he forced this most undesirable\nacquaintance on her!\n\n\"You wanted to see Marsh?\" she asked, as she gave him her hand.\n\n\"That will keep,\" said Gilmore cheerfully. \"May I stay?\" he added.\n\n\"If you wish,\" she answered indifferently.\n\nShe felt a sense of shame at his presence there. Everything about her\nseemed to sink to his level, which was a very low level, she was sure.\nThese afternoon calls were a recent feature of their intimacy. Before\nGilmore came, she had been thinking for the hundredth time of John\nNorth--the man she had once loved and now hated, but in whose honor she\nhad such confidence that she knew he would face death rather than\ncompromise her. In spite of the fact that he had scorned her, had thrown\nher aside for another, she had had on his account many a soul-rending\nstruggle with her conscience, with her better self. She knew that a word\nfrom her, and his prison doors would open to a free world. Time and\nagain this word had trembled on her lips unuttered. She knew also that\nit was not hate of North that kept her silent. It was an intangible,\nunformed, unthoughtout fear of what might follow after. North, she knew,\nwas innocent; who then was guilty? She closed her eyes and shut her\nlips. That North would ultimately clear himself she never seriously\ndoubted, and yet the burden of her secret was intolerable. In her\npresent mood, she was accessible to every passing influence, and to-day\nit was Gilmore's fate to find her both penitent and rebellious, but he\ncould not know this, he only knew that she was quieter than usual.\n\nHe seated himself at her side, and his eyes, eager and animated, fed on\nher beauty. He had come to the belief that only the lightest barriers\nstood between himself and Evelyn Langham, and it was a question in his\nmind of just how much he would be willing to sacrifice for her sake. He\nboasted nothing in the way of position or reputation, and no act of his\ncould possibly add to the disfavor in which he was already held; but to\nleave Mount Hope meant certain definite financial losses; this had\nserved as a check on his ardor, for where money was concerned Gilmore\nwas cautious. But his passion was coming to be the supreme thing in his\nlife; a fortunate chance had placed him where he now stood in relation\nto her, and chance again, as unkind as it had been kind, might separate\nthem. The set of Gilmore's heavy jaws became tense with this thought and\nwith the ruthless strength of his purpose. He would shake down one\nsensation for Mount Hope before he got away,--and he would not go alone.\n\n\"I suppose you were at the trial to-day?\" Evelyn said.\n\n\"Yes, I was there for a little while this afternoon,\" he answered. \"It's\nrather tame yet, they're still fussing over the jury.\"\n\n\"How is Jack bearing it?\" she asked.\n\nHer question seemed to depress Gilmore.\n\n\"Why do you care about how he takes it? I don't suppose he sees any fun\nin it,--he didn't look to me as if he did,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"But how did he _seem_ to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's got nerve enough, if that's what you mean!\"\n\n\"Poor Jack!\" she murmured softly.\n\n\"If you're curious, why don't you go take a look at poor Jack? He'll be\nthere all right for the next few weeks,\" said the gambler, watching her\nnarrowly.\n\n\"I'm afraid Marsh might object.\"\n\nAt this Gilmore threw back his head and laughed.\n\n\"Excuse _me_!\" he said; and in explanation of his sudden mirth, he\nadded: \"The idea of your trotting out Marsh to me!\"\n\n\"I'm not trotting him out to you,--as you call it,\" Evelyn said quietly,\nbut her small foot tapped the floor. She intended presently to rid\nherself of Gilmore for all time.\n\n\"Yes, but I was afraid you were going to.\"\n\n\"You mustn't speak to me as you do; I have done nothing to give you the\nprivilege.\"\n\nGilmore did not seem at all abashed at this reproof.\n\n\"If you want to go to the trial I'll take you, and I'll agree to make it\nall right with Marsh afterward; what do you say?\" he asked.\n\nEvelyn smiled brightly, but she did not explain to him the utter\nimpossibility of their appearing in public together either at the North\ntrial or anywhere else for the matter of that; there were bounds set\neven to her reckless disregard of what Mount Hope held to be right and\nproper.\n\n\"Oh, no, you're very kind, but I don't think I should care to see poor\nJack now.\"\n\nShe gave a little shiver of horror as if at the mere idea. This was for\nthe gambler, but her real feeling was far deeper than he, suspicious as\nhe was, could possibly know.\n\n\"Why do you 'poor Jack' him to me?\" said Gilmore sullenly.\n\nEvelyn opened her fine eyes in apparent astonishment.\n\n\"He is one of my oldest friends. I have known him all my life!\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Well, one's friends should keep out of the sort of trouble he's made\nfor himself,\" observed Gilmore in surly tones.\n\n\"Yes,--perhaps--\" answered Evelyn absently.\n\n\"Look here, I don't want to talk to you about North anyhow; can't we hit\non some other topic?\" asked Gilmore.\n\nIt maddened him even to think of the part the accused man had played in\nher life.\n\n\"Why have you and Marsh turned against him?\" she asked.\n\nThe gambler considered for an instant.\n\n\"Do you really want to know? Well, you see he wasn't square; that does a\nman up quicker than anything else.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" she cried.\n\n\"It's so,--ask Marsh; we found him to be an all-right crook; then's when\nwe quit him,\" he said, nodding and smiling grimly.\n\nThere was something in his manner which warned her that his real meaning\nwas intentionally obscured. She remembered that Marsh had once boasted\nof having proof that she was in North's rooms the afternoon of the\nmurder and it flashed across her mind that if any one really knew of her\npresence there it was Gilmore himself. She studied him furtively, and\nshe observed that his black waxed mustache shaded a pair of lips that\nwore a mirthless smile, and what had at first been no more than an\nundefined suspicion grew into a certainty. Gilmore shifted uneasily in\nhis chair. He felt that since their last meeting he had lost ground with\nher.\n\n\"What's the matter,--why do you keep me at arm's length; what have I\ndone, anyhow?\" he asked impatiently.\n\n\"Do I keep you at arm's length? Well, perhaps you need to be kept\nthere,\" she said.\n\n\"You should know what brings me here,--why it is I can't keep away--\"\n\n\"How should I know, unless you tell me?\" she said softly.\n\nGilmore bent toward her, his eyes lustrous with suppressed feeling.\n\n\"Isn't that another of your little jokes, Evelyn? Do you really want me\nto tell you?\"\n\n\"I am dying with curiosity!\"\n\nVoice and manner seemed to encourage, and the gambler felt his heart\nleap within him.\n\n\"Well, I guess it's principally to see you!\" he muttered, but his lips\nquivered with emotion.\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Just see how mistaken one may be, Andy; I thought all along it was\nMarsh!\"\n\nAt her use of his Christian name his heavy face became radiant. His\npurposes were usually allied to an admirable directness of speech that\nnever left one long in doubt as to his full meaning.\n\n\"Look here, aren't you about sick of Marsh?\" he asked. \"How long are you\ngoing to stand for this sort of thing? You have a right to expect\nsomething better than he has to offer you!\"\n\nShe met the glance of his burning black eyes with undisturbed serenity,\nbut a cruel smile had come again to the corners of her mouth. She was\npreparing to settle her score with Gilmore in a fashion he would not\nsoon forget. One of her hands rested on the arm of her chair, and the\ngambler's ringed fingers closed about it; but apparently she was unaware\nof this; at least she did not seek to withdraw it.\n\n\"By God, you're pretty!\" he cried.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"Mean,--don't you know that I love you? Have I got to make it plain that\nI care for you,--that you are everything to me?\" he asked, bending\ntoward her.\n\n\"So you care a great deal about me, do you, Andy?\" she asked slowly.\n\n\"I like to hear you call me that!\" he said with a deep breath.\n\n\"What is it, Andy--what do you want?\" she continued.\n\n\"You--you!\" he said hoarsely; his face was white, he had come to the end\nof long days of hope and doubt; he had battered down every obstacle that\nstood in his path and he was telling her of his love, nor did she seem\nunwilling to hear him. \"You are the whole thing to me! I have loved you\nalways--ever since I first saw you! Tell me you'll quit this place with\nme--I swear I'll make you happy--\"\n\nHis face was very close to hers, and guessing his purpose she snatched\naway her hand. Then she laughed.\n\nAs the sound of her merriment fell on Gilmore's startled ears, there\nswiftly came to him the consciousness that something was wrong.\n\n\"You and your love-making are very funny, Mr. Gilmore; but there is one\nthing you don't seem to understand. There is such a thing as taste in\nselection even when it has ceased to be a matter of morals. I don't like\nyou, Mr. Gilmore. You amused me, but you are merely tiresome now.\"\n\nShe spoke with deliberate contempt, and his face turned white and then\nscarlet, as if under the sting of a lash.\n\n\"If you were a man--\" he began, infuriated by the insolence of her\nspeech.\n\n\"If I were a man I should be quite able to take care of myself.\nUnderstand, I am seeing you for the last time--\"\n\n\"Yes, by God, you are!\" he cried.\n\nHis face was ashen. He had come to his feet, shaken and uncertain. It\nwas as if each word of hers had been a stab.\n\n\"I am glad we can agree so perfectly on that point. Will you kindly\nclose the hail door as you go out?\"\n\nShe turned from him and took up a book from the table at her elbow.\nGilmore moved toward the door, but paused irresolutely. His first\nfeeling of furious rage was now tempered by a sense of coming loss. This\nwas to be the end; he was never to see her again! He swung about on his\nheel. She was already turning the leaves of her book, apparently\noblivious of his presence.\n\n\"Am I to believe you--\" he faltered.\n\nShe looked up and her eyes met his. There was nothing in her glance to\nindicate that she comprehended the depth of his suffering.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, with a drawing in of her full lips.\n\n\"When I leave you--if you really mean that--it will be to leave Mount\nHope!\" said he appealingly.\n\nThe savage vigor that was normally his had deserted him, his very pride\nwas gone; a sudden mistrust of himself was humbling him; he felt\nwretchedly out of place; he was even dimly conscious of his own baseness\nwhile he was for the moment blinded to the cruelty of her conduct. Under\nhis breath he cursed himself. By his too great haste, by a too great\nfrankness he had fooled away his chances with her.\n\n\"That is more than I dared hope,\" Evelyn rejoined composedly.\n\n\"If I've offended you--\" began Gilmore.\n\n\"Your presence offends me,\" she interrupted and looked past him to the\ndoor.\n\n\"You don't mean what you say--Evelyn--\" he said earnestly.\n\n\"My cook might have been flattered by your proposal; but why you should\nhave thought I would be, is utterly incomprehensible.\"\n\nGilmore's face became livid on the instant. A storm of abuse rushed to\nhis lips but he held himself in check. Then without a word or a glance\nhe passed from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n\nTHE HOUSE OF CARDS\n\n\nThe long day had been devoted to the choosing of the twelve men who\nshould say whether John North was innocent or guilty, but at last court\nadjourned and Marshall Langham, pushing through the crowd that was\nemptying itself into the street, turned away in the direction of his\nhome.\n\nFor no single instant during the day had he been able to take his eyes\nfrom his father's face. He had heard almost nothing of what was said, it\nwas only when the coldly impersonal tones of the judge's voice reached\nhim out of, what was to him silence, that he was stung to a full\ncomprehension of what was going on about him. The faces of the crowd had\nblended until they were as indistinguishable as the face of humanity\nitself. For him there had been but the one tragic presence in that dingy\nroom; and now--as the dull gray winter twilight enveloped him,--wherever\nhe turned his eyes, on the snow-covered pavement, in the bare branches\nof the trees,--there he saw, endlessly repeated, the white drawn face of\nhis father.\n\nHis capacity for endurance seemed to measure itself against the slow\ndays. A week--two weeks--and the trial would end, but how? If the\nverdict was guilty, North's friends would still continue their fight for\nhis life. He must sustain himself beyond what he felt to be the utmost\nlimit of his powers; and always, day after day, there would be that face\nwith its sunken eyes and bloodless lips, to summon him into its\npresence.\n\nHe found himself at his own door, and paused uncertainly. He passed a\ntremulous hand before his eyes. Was he sure of Gilmore,--was he sure of\nEvelyn, who must know that North was innocent? The thought of her roused\nin him all his bitter sense of hurt and injury. North had trampled on\nhis confidence and friendship! The lines of his face grew hard. This was\nto be his revenge,--his by every right, and his fears should rob him of\nno part of it!\n\nHe pushed open the door and entered the unlighted hail, then with a\ngrumbled oath because of the darkness, passed on into the sitting-room.\nExcept for such light as a bed of soft coal in the grate gave out, the\nroom was clothed in uncertainty. He stumbled against a chair and swore\nagain savagely. He was answered by a soft laugh, and then he saw Evelyn\nseated in the big arm-chair at one side of the fireplace.\n\n\"Did you hurt yourself, Marsh?\" she asked.\n\nLangham growled an unintelligible reply and dropped heavily into a\nchair. He brought with him the fumes of whisky and stale tobacco, and as\nthese reached her across the intervening space Evelyn made a little\ngrimace in the half light.\n\n\"I declare, Marsh, you are hardly fit to enter a respectable house!\" she\nsaid.\n\nIn spite of his doubt of her, they were not on the worst of terms, there\nwere still times when he resumed his old role of the lover, when he held\nher drifting fancy in something of the potent spell he had once been\nable to weave about her. Whatever their life together, it was far from\ncommonplace, with its poverty and extravagance, its quarrelings and its\nreconciliations, while back of it all, deep-rooted in the very dregs of\nexistence, was his passionate love. Even his brutal indifference was but\none of the many phases of his love; it was a manifestation of his revolt\nagainst his sense of dependence, a dependence which made it possible for\nhim to love where his faith was destroyed and his trust gone absolutely.\nEvelyn was vaguely conscious of this and she was not sure but that she\nrequired just such a life as theirs had become, but that she would have\nbeen infinitely bored with a man far more worth while than Marshall\nLangham. From his seat by the fire Langham scowled across at her, but\nthe scowl was lost in the darkness.\n\n\"Your father was here last evening, Marsh,\" Evelyn said at length,\nremembering she had not seen him the night before, and that he had\nbreakfasted and gone before she was up that morning.\n\n\"What did he come for?\" her husband asked.\n\n\"I think to see you. Poor man, he doesn't seem able to get the run of\nthe hours you keep; I told him he could always find you here between\nfour and eight in the morning. I must say this little insight into your\ndomestic habits appeared to distress him, but I tried to comfort him,--I\ntold him you would probably outlive us all.\" She laughed softly. \"Andy\nwas here this afternoon, Marsh,\" she went on.\n\n\"What the devil did he want?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Is he coming back?\"\n\n\"He didn't mention it, if he is.\" And again she laughed.\n\nLangham moved impatiently; her low full-throated mirth jarred on his\nsomber mood.\n\n\"Were you in court to-day, Marsh?\" she inquired, after a short silence.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered briefly.\n\n\"Were there many there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Any ladies, Marsh?\" she questioned, with sudden eagerness.\n\n\"If you can call them that,\" he growled.\n\n\"Do you know, Marsh, I had a strong impulse to go, too. Would you have\nbeen astonished to see me there?\" she asked tentatively.\n\n\"We won't have any of that,--do you understand?\" he said with fierce\nauthority.\n\n\"Why not? It's as right for me as it is for any one else, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I won't _have_ it!\" he said, lifting his voice slightly.\n\nShe had risen and now stood leaning against the arm of his chair.\n\n\"Marsh, he didn't kill McBride; he couldn't,--he wouldn't harm a mouse!\"\n\nHer words set him raging.\n\n\"Keep quiet, will you,--what do you know about it, anyhow?\" he cried\nwith sullen ferocity.\n\n\"Don't be rude, Marsh! So you don't want me to come to the trial,--you\ntell me I can't?\"\n\n\"Did my father say anything about this matter,--the trial, I mean?\"\nasked Langham haltingly.\n\n\"Yes, I think he spoke of it, but I really wasn't interested because you\nsee I am so sure John North is innocent!\"\n\nHe caught one of her hands in his and drew her down on the arm of his\nchair where he could look into her eyes.\n\n\"There is just one question I want to ask you, Evelyn, but I expect\nyou'll answer it as you choose,\" he said, with his face close to hers.\n\n\"Then why ask it?\" she said.\n\n\"Why,--because I want to know. Where were you on the day of the\nmurder,--between five and six o'clock?\"\n\n\"I _wish_ you'd let me go, Marsh; you're hurting me--\" she complained.\n\nShe struggled for a moment to release herself from his grasp, then\nrealizing that her effort was of no avail, she quietly resumed her\nformer position on the arm of his chair.\n\n\"You must answer my question, come--where were you?\" Langham commanded.\n\nHe brought his face close to hers and she saw that his eyes burnt with\nan unhealthy light.\n\n\"How silly of you, Marsh, you know it was Thanksgiving day,--that we\ndined with your father.\"\n\n\"I am not asking you about that,--that was later!\"\n\n\"I suppose I was on my way there at the hour you mention.\"\n\n\"No, you weren't; you were in North's rooms!\"\n\n\"If you were not drunk, I should be angry with you, Marsh,--you are\ninsulting--\"\n\nHe quitted his hold on her and staggered to his feet.\n\n\"You were with North--\" he roared.\n\n\"Do you want the servants to hear you?\" she asked in an angry whisper.\n\n\"Hell!\"\n\nHe made a step toward her, his hand raised.\n\n\"Don't do that, Marsh. I should never forgive you!\"\n\nEvelyn faced him, meeting his wild glance with unshaken composure. The\nclenched hand fell at his side.\n\n\"My God, I ought to kill you!\" he muttered.\n\nShe made him no answer, but kept her eyes fixed steadily on his face.\n\n\"You _were_ with North!\" Langham repeated.\n\n\"Well, since you wish me to say it, I was with John North, but what of\nthat?\"\n\n\"In his rooms--\" he jerked out.\n\n\"No,--now you are asking too much of me!\"\n\n\"I have proof,--proof, that you went to his rooms that day!\" he stormed.\n\n\"I did nothing of the sort, and I am not going to quarrel with you while\nyou are drunk!\"\n\nDrunk he was, but not as she understood drunkenness. In the terrible\nextremity to which his crime had brought him he was having recourse to\ndrugs.\n\n\"You say you have proof,--don't be absurd, Marsh, you know you haven't!\"\nshe added uneasily.\n\n\"You were with North in his rooms--\" he insisted.\n\nHe was conscious of a strange wonder at himself that he could believe\nthis, and yet aside from such gusts of rage as these, his doubt of her\nmade no difference in their life together. Surely this was the measure\nof his degradation.\n\n\"I am not going to discuss this matter with you!\" Evelyn said.\n\n\"Aren't you? Well, I guess you will. Do you know you may be summoned\ninto court?\"\n\n\"Why?\" she demanded, with a nervous start.\n\n\"North may want to prove that he was in his rooms at the hour the\nmurder is supposed to have been committed; all he needs is your\ntestimony,--it would make a nice scandal, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Has he asked this?\" Evelyn questioned.\n\n\"Not yet!\"\n\n\"Then I don't think he ever will,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"Do you suppose he will be fool enough to go to the penitentiary, or\nhang, to save _your_ reputation?\" Langham asked harshly.\n\n\"I think Jack North would be almost fool enough for that,\" she answered\nwith conviction.\n\n\"Well, I don't,--you were too easy,--men don't risk their necks for your\nsort!\" he mocked. \"Look here, you had an infatuation for North,--you\nadmitted it,--only this time it went too far! What was the trouble, did\nhe get sick of the business and throw you over?\"\n\n\"How coarse you are, Marsh!\" and she colored angrily, not at his words,\nhowever, but at the memory of that last meeting with North.\n\n\"It's a damn rotten business, and I'll call it by what name I please! If\nyou are summoned, it will be your word against his; you have told me you\nwere not in his rooms--\"\n\n\"I was _not_ there--\" she said, and as she said it she wondered why she\ndid not tell the truth, admit the whole thing and have it over with. She\nwas tired of the wrangling, and her hatred of North had given way to\npity, yet when Langham replied:\n\n\"All right. You are my wife, and North can hang, but he shan't save\nhimself by ruining you if _I_ can help it!\"\n\nShe answered: \"I have told you that I wasn't there, Marsh.\"\n\n\"Would you swear that you weren't there?\" Langham asked eagerly.\n\n\"Yes--\"\n\n\"Even if it sent him to the penitentiary?\" he persisted.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe took her by the shoulders and drew her near to him that he might look\ndeep into her eyes.\n\n\"Even if it hanged him?\" he rasped out.\n\nShe felt his hot breath on her cheek; she looked into his face, fierce,\ncruel, with the insane selfishness of his one great fear.\n\n\"Answer me,--would you let him hang?\" and he shook her roughly.\n\n\"Would I let him hang--\" she repeated.\n\n\"Yes--\"\n\n\"I--I don't know!\" she said in a frightened whisper.\n\n\"No, damn you, I can't trust you!\" and he flung her from him.\n\nThere was a brief silence. The intangible, unformed, unthoughtout fear\nthat had kept her silent was crystallizing into a very tangible\nconviction. Marshall had expressed more than the mere desire to be\nrevenged on North, she saw that he was swayed by the mastering emotion\nof fear, rather than by his blazing hate of the suspected man. Slowly\nbut surely there came to her an understanding of his swift descent\nduring the last months.\n\n\"Marsh--\" she began, and hesitated.\n\nA scarcely articulate snarl from Langham seemed to encourage her to go\non.\n\n\"Marsh, where does the money come from that you--that we--have been\nspending so lavishly this winter?\"\n\n\"From my practice,\" he said, but his face was averted.\n\nShe gave a frightened laugh.\n\n\"Oh, no, Marsh, I know better than that!\"\n\nHe swung about on her.\n\n\"Well,\" he stormed, \"what do you know?\"\n\n\"Hush, Marsh!\" she implored, in sudden terror of him.\n\nHe gave her a sullen glare.\n\n\"Oh, very well, bring the whole damn thing rattling down about our\nears!\" he cried.\n\n\"Marsh,--what do you mean? Do you know that John North is innocent?\" She\nspoke with terrifying deliberation.\n\nFor a moment they stood staring into each other's eyes. The delicate\npallor deepened on her face, and she sank half fainting into a chair,\nbut her accusing gaze was still fixed on Langham.\n\nHe strode to her side, and his hand gripped hers with a cruel force.\n\n\"Let him prove that he is innocent if he can, but without help from\nyou! You keep still no matter what happens, do you hear? Or God knows\nwhere this thing will end--or how!\"\n\n\"Marsh, what am I to think!\"\n\n\"You can think what you like so long as you keep still--\"\n\nThere was a hesitating step in the hall, the door was pushed open, and\nJudge Langham paused on the threshold.\n\n\"May I come in?\" he said.\n\nNeither spoke, and his uneasy glance shifted back and forth from husband\nto wife. In that wordless instant their common knowledge manifested\nitself to each one of the three.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\nGOOD MEN AND TRUE\n\n\nThe North trial was Mount Hope's one vital sensation. Day after day the\ncourtroom was filled with eager perspiring humanity, while in their\nhomes, on the streets, and in the stores men talked of little else. As\nfor North himself, he was conscious of a curious sense of long\nacquaintance with the courtroom; its staring white walls and crowded\nbenches seemed his accustomed surroundings, and here, with a feeling\nthat was something between fear and weariness, he followed each stage of\nthe elaborate game Judge Belknap, for the defense, and Moxlow, for the\nprosecution, were playing, the game that had his life for its stake.\n\nWhen court adjourned, always in the twilight of those mid-winter\nafternoons, there were his brief comforting interviews with Elizabeth;\nand then the long solitary evenings in his cell; and the longer nights,\nrestless and disturbed. The strain told fearfully on his vigor of body\nand mind, his face under imprisonment's pallid mask, became gaunt and\nheavily lined, while his eyes sunk deep in their sockets.\n\nAt first he had not believed that an innocent man could be punished for\na crime of which he had no knowledge; he was not so sure of this now,\nfor the days slipped past and the prosecution remained firmly intrenched\nbehind certain facts which were in their way, conclusive. He told\nhimself with grim humor that the single weak strand in the rope Moxlow\nwas seeking to fit about his neck was this, that after all was said and\nproved, the fact remained, he had not killed Archibald McBride!\n\nWhen the last witness for the state had been examined, North took the\nstand in his own behalf. His cross-examination was concluded one dull\nFebruary day, and there came a brief halt in the rapid progress of the\ntrial; the jury was sent from the room while Moxlow and Belknap prepared\ninstructions and submitted them to the court. The judge listened\nwearily, his sunken cheek resting against the palm of his thin hand, and\nhis gaze fixed on vacancy; when he spoke his voice was scarcely audible.\nOnce he paused in the middle of a sentence as his glance fell on the\nheavy upturned face of his son, for he saw fear and entreaty written on\nthe close-drawn lips and in the bloodshot eyes.\n\nA little later in the twilight North, with the sheriff at his elbow,\nwalked down the long corridor on his way to the jail. The end was close\nat hand, a day or two more and his fate would be decided. The\nhopelessness of the situation appalled him, stupified him. The evidence\nof his guilt seemed overwhelming; he wondered how Elizabeth retained her\nfaith in him. He always came back to his thought of her, and that which\nhad once been his greatest joy now only filled him with despair. Why had\nhe ever spoken of his love,--what if this grim farce in which he was a\nhapless actor blundered on to a tragic close! He would have made any\nsacrifice had it been possible for him to face the situation alone, but\nanother life was bound up with him; he would drag her down in the ruin\nthat had overtaken him, and when it was all past and forgotten, she\nwould remember,--the horror of it would fill her days!\n\nOn that night, as on many another, North retraced step by step the ugly\npath that wound its tortuous way from McBride's back office to the cell\nin which he--John North--faced the gallows. But the oftener he trod this\npath the more maze-like it became, until now he was hopelessly lost in\nits intricacies; discouraged, dazed, confused, almost convinced that in\nsome blank moment of lost identity it was his hand that had sent the old\nman on his long last journey. As Evelyn Langham had questioned, so now\ndid John North: \"If not I, then who did murder Archibald McBride?\"\n\nIn a vain search for the missing handy-man, General Herbert had opened\nhis purse wider than North or even Evelyn realized. There seemed three\npossibilities in the instance of Montgomery. Either he knew McBride's\nmurderer and testified falsely to shield him; or else he knew nothing\nand had been hired by some unknown enemy to swear North into the\npenitentiary; or--and the third possibility seemed not unlikely--it was\nhe himself that had clambered over the shed roof after killing and\nrobbing the old merchant.\n\nNorth turned on his cot and his thoughts turned with him from Montgomery\nto Gilmore, who also, with uncharacteristic cowardliness had fled the\nscene of his illegal activities and the indictment that threatened him\nanew. \"What was the gambler's part in the tragedy?\" He hated North; he\nloved Marshall Langham's wife. But neither of these passions shaped\nthemselves into murderous motives. Langham himself furnished food for\nreflection and speculation. Evidently in the most dire financial\ndifficulties; evidently under Gilmore's domination; evidently burdened\nwith some guilty knowledge,--but there was no evidence against him, he\nhad credibly accounted for himself on that Thanksgiving afternoon, and\nNorth for the hundredth time dismissed him with the exclamation: \"Marsh\nLangham a murderer? Impossible!\"\n\nThe first cold rays of light, announcing the belated winter's dawn,\ntouched with gray fingers the still grayer face of the sleepless\nprisoner. Out of the shadows that they coined came a vision of Evelyn\nLangham. And again for the hundredth time, North was torn between the\nbelief that she, by her testimony, might save him and the unconquerable\ndetermination to keep from Elizabeth Herbert the knowledge of his affair\nwith Langham's wife. Better end his worthless existence than touch her\nfair life with this scandal. But of what was Evelyn Langham thinking\nduring the days of his trial? What if she should voluntarily break her\nsilence! Should he not send for her--there was a sound at his door.\nNorth started to his feet only to see the fat round face of the deputy\nsheriff as he came bringing the morning's hot coffee and thick buttered\nbread.\n\nThe town bell was ringing for nine o'clock when the deputy sheriff again\nappeared to escort him into court, and as they entered the room North\nsaw that it was packed to the doors. His appearance won a moment of\noppressive silence, then came the shuffling of feet and the hum of\nwhispered conversation.\n\nAt the back of the room sat Marshall Langham. He was huddled up in a\nsplint-bottomed chair a deputy had placed for him at one end of the last\nrow of benches. Absorbed and aloof, he spoke with no one, he rarely\nmoved except to mop his face with his handkerchief. His eyes were fixed\non the pale shrunken figure that bent above the judge's desk. His\nfather's face with its weary dignity, its unsoftened pride, possessed a\nterrible fascination for him; the very memory of it, when he had quitted\nthe court room, haunted him! Pallid, bloodless as a bit of yellow\nparchment, and tortured by suffering, it stole into his dreams at night.\n\nBut at last the end was in sight! If Moxlow had the brains he credited\nhim with, North would be convicted, the law satisfied, and his case\ncease to be of vital interest to any one. Then of a sudden his fears\nwould go from him, he would be born afresh into a heritage of new hopes\nand new aspirations! He had suffered to the very limit of his capacity;\nthere was such a thing as expiation, and surely he had expiated his\ncrime.\n\nNow Moxlow, lank and awkward, with long black locks sweeping the collar\nof his rusty coat, slipped from his chair and stood before the judge's\ndesk. For an instant Langham's glance shifted from his father to the\naccused man. He felt intense hatred of him; to his warped and twisted\nconsciousness, half mad as he was with drink and drugs, North's life\nseemed the one thing that stood between himself and safety,--and clearly\nNorth had forfeited the right to live!\n\nWhen Moxlow's even tones fell on the expectant hush, Langham writhed in\nhis seat. Each word, he felt, had a dreadful significance; the big linen\nhandkerchief went back and forth across his face as he sought to mop\naway the sweat that oozed from every pore. He had gone as deep in the\nprosecutor's counsels as he dared go, he knew the man's power of\ninvective, and his sledge-hammer force in argument; he wanted him to cut\nloose and overwhelm North all in a breath! The blood in him leaped and\ntingled with suppressed excitement, his twitching lips shaped themselves\nwith Moxlow's words. He felt that Moxlow was letting his opportunity\npass him by, that after all he was not equal to the task before him,\nthat it was one thing to plan and quite another to perform. Men, such as\nthose jurors, must be powerfully moved or they would shrink from a\nverdict of guilty!\n\nBut Moxlow persevered in his level tones, he was not to be hurried. He\nfelt the case as good as won, and there was the taste of triumph in his\nmouth, for he was going to convict his man in spite of the best criminal\nlawyer in the state! Yet presently the level tones became more and more\nincisive, and Moxlow would walk toward North, his long finger extended,\nto loose a perfect storm of words that cut and stung and insulted. He\nwent deep into North's past, and stripped him bare; shabby, mean, and\nprofligate, he pictured those few short years of his manhood until he\nbecame the broken spendthrift, desperately in need of money and rendered\ndaring by the ruin that had overtaken him.\n\nMoxlow's speech lasted three hours, and when he ended a burning mist was\nbefore North's eyes. He saw vaguely the tall figure of the prosecuting\nattorney sink into a chair, and he gave a great sigh of relief. Perhaps\nNorth expected Belknap to perform some miracle of vindication in his\nbehalf, certainly when his counsel advanced to the rail that guarded the\nbench there were both authority and confidence in his manner, and soon\nthe dingy court room was echoing to the strident tones of the old\ncriminal lawyer's voice. As the minutes passed, however, it became a\ncertainty with North that no miracle would happen.\n\nBelknap concluded his plea shortly before six o'clock. And this was the\nend,--this was the last move in the game where his life was the stake!\nIn spite of his exhaustion of mind and body North had followed the\nspeech with the closest attention. He told himself now, that the state's\ncase was unshaken, that the facts, stubborn and damning, were not to be\nbrushed aside.\n\nMoxlow's answer to Belknap's plea was brief, occupying little more than\nhalf an hour, and the trial was ended. It rested with the jury 'to say\nwhether John North was innocent or guilty. As the jury filed from the\nroom North realized this with a feeling of relief in that that at last\nthe miserable ordeal was over. He had never been quite bereft of hope,\nthe consciousness of his own innocence had measurably sustained him in\nhis darkest hours. And now once more his imagination swept him beyond\nthe present into the future; again he could believe that he was to pass\nfrom that room a free man to take his place in the world from which he\nhad these many weary months been excluded. There was no bitterness in\nhis heart toward any one, even Moxlow's harsh denunciation of him was\nforgotten; the law through its bungling agents had laid its savage hands\non him, that was all, and these agents had merely done what they\nconceived to be their duty.\n\nHe glanced toward the big clock on the wall above the judge's desk and\nsaw that thirty minutes had already gone by since the jury retired.\nAnother half-hour passed while he studied the face of the clock, but the\ndoor of the jury room, near which Deputy-sheriff Brockett had taken up\nhis station, still remained closed and no sound came from beyond it. At\nhis back he heard one man whisper to another that the jurymen's dinner\nhad just been brought in from the hotel.\n\n\"That means another three quarters of an hour,--it's their last chance\nto get a square meal at the county's expense!\" the speaker added, which\nearned him a neighboring ripple of laughter.\n\nJudge Langham and Moxlow had withdrawn to the former's private room.\nSheriff Conklin touched North on the shoulder.\n\n\"I guess we'd better go back, John!\" he said. \"If they want us to-night\nthey can send for us.\"\n\nMorbid and determined, the spectators settled down to wait for the\nverdict. The buzz of conversation was on every hand, and the air grew\nthick and heavy with tobacco smoke, while relaxed and at ease the crowd\nwith its many pairs of eyes kept eager watch on the door before which\nBrockett kept guard. No man in the room was wholly unaffected by the\nsinister significance of the deputy's presence there, and the fat little\nman with his shiny bald head and stubby gray mustache, silent,\npreoccupied, taking no part in what was passing about him, became as the\nfigure of fate.\n\nThe clock on the wall back of the judges desk ticked off the seconds;\nnow it made itself heard in the hush that stole over the room, again its\nmessage was lost in the confusion of sounds, the scraping of feet or the\nhum of idle talk. But whether the crowd was silent or noisy the clock\nperformed its appointed task until its big gilt hands told whoever cared\nto look that the jury in the John North case had devoted three hours to\nits verdict and its dinner.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place had become more and more oppressive. Men\nnodded sleepily in their chairs, conversation had almost ceased, when\nsuddenly and without any apparent reason Brockett swung about on his\nheel and faced the locked door. His whole expression betokened a\nfeverish interest. The effect of this was immediate. A wave of\nsuppressed excitement passed over the crowd; absolute silence followed;\nand then from beyond the door, and distinctly audible in the stillness,\ncame the sound of a quick step on the uncarpeted floor. The clock ticked\ntwice, then a hand dealt the door a measured blow.\n\nThe moment of silence that followed this ominous signal was only broken\nwhen a deputy who had been nodding half asleep in his chair, sprang\nerect and hurried from the room. As the swinging baize doors banged at\nhis heels, the crowd seemed to breathe again.\n\nMoxlow was the first to arrive. The deputy had found him munching a\nsandwich on the court-house steps. His entrance was unhurried and his\nmanner quietly confident; he put aside his well-worn overcoat and took\nhis seat at the counsel table. A little ripple of respectful comment had\ngreeted his appearance; this died away when the baize doors at the back\nof the room swung open again to admit North and the sheriff.\n\nNorth's face was white, but he wore a look of high courage. He\nunderstood to the full the dreadful hazard of the next few moments. With\nnever a glance to the right or to the left, he crossed the room and took\nhis seat; as he settled himself in his chair, Belknap hurried into\ncourt.\n\nJudge Langham had not yet appeared, and the crowd focused its attention\non the shut door leading into his private office. Presently this door\nwas seen to open slowly, and the judge's spare erect figure paused on\nthe threshold. His eyes, sunken, yet brilliant with a strange light,\nshifted from side to side as he glanced over the room.\n\nMarshall Langham had not quitted his seat. There in his remote corner\nunder the gallery, his blanched face framed by shadows, his father's\nglance found him. With his hand resting tremulously on the jamb of the\ndoor as if to steady himself, the judge advanced a step. Once more his\neyes strayed in the direction of his son, and from the gloom of that\ndull corner which Marshall had made his own, despair and terror called\naloud to him. His shaking hand dropped to his side, and then like some\npale ghost, he passed slowly before the eager eyes that were following\nhis every movement to his place behind the flat-topped desk on the\nraised dais.\n\nAs he sank into his chair he turned to the clerk of the court and there\nwas a movement of his thin lips, but no sound passed them. Brockett\nguessed the order he had wished to give, and the big key slid around in\nthe old-fashioned lock of the jury-room door. Heavy-visaged and\nhesitating, the twelve men filed into court, and at sight of them John\nNorth's heart seemed to die within his breast. He no longer hoped nor\ndoubted, he knew their verdict,--he was caught in some intricate web of\ncircumstance! A monstrous injustice was about to be done him, and in the\nvery name of justice itself!\n\nThe jurors, awkward in their self-consciousness, crossed the room and,\nas intangible as it was potent, a wave of horror went with them. There\nwas a noisy scraping of chairs as they took their seats, and then a\ndeathlike silence.\n\nThe clerk glanced up inquiringly into the white face that was bent on\nhim. A scarcely perceptible inclination of the head answered him, and he\nturned to the jury.\n\n\"Gentlemen, have you arrived at a true verdict, and chosen one of your\nnumber to speak for you?\" he asked.\n\nMartin Howe, the first man in the front row of the two solemn lines of\njurors, came awkwardly to his feet and said almost in a whisper:\n\n\"We have. We find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment.\"\n\n\"Mr. Howe, do you find this man guilty as charged in the indictment?\"\nasked the clerk.\n\n\"I do,\" responded the juror.\n\nTwelve times the clerk of the court, calling each man by name, asked\nthis question, and one by one the jurors stood up and answered:\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n\nTHE LAST APPEAL\n\n\nOne raw morning late in April, Mark Leanard, who worked at Kirby's\nlumber-yard, drove his team of big grade Percherons up to Kirby's office\nby the railroad tracks.\n\n\"What's doing?\" he asked of Kirby's clerk.\n\nThe clerk handed him a slip of paper.\n\n\"Go round and tell Mitchell to get you out this load!\" he said.\n\nLeanard went off whistling, with the order slip tucked back of his\nhatband. In the yard, Mitchell the foreman, gave him a load \"of\nsixteen-foot\" pine boards and \"two by fours\".\n\n\"Where to?\" the driver asked, as he took his seat on top the load.\n\n\"To the jail, they're going to fence the yard.\"\n\n\"You mean young John North?\"\n\n\"That's what,--did you think you'd get a day off and take the old woman\nand the kids?\" asked Mitchell.\n\nIt was a little past eight when the teamster entered the alley back of\nthe jail and began to unload. The fall of the first heavy plank took\nJohn North to his cell window. For a long breathless moment he stood\nthere peering down into the alley, then he turned away.\n\nAll that day the teams from Kirby's continued to bring lumber for the\nfence, and at intervals North heard the thud of the heavy planks as they\nwere thrown from the wagons, or the voices of the drivers as they urged\ntheir horses up the steep grade from the street. Darkness came at last\nand with it unbroken quiet, but in his troubled slumbers that night the\ncondemned man saw the teams come and go, and heard the fall of the\nplanks. It was only when the dawn's first uncertain light stole into the\ncell that a dreamless sleep gave him complete forgetfulness.\n\nFrom this he was presently roused by hearing the sound of voices in the\nyard, and then the sharp ringing blows of a hammer. He quitted his bed\nand slipped to the window; two carpenters had already begun building the\nframe work that was to carry the temporary fence which would inclose the\nplace of execution. It was _his_ fence; it would surround his gallows\nthat his death should not become a public spectacle.\n\nAs they went about their task, the two carpenters stole covert glances\nup in the direction of his window, but North stood well back in the\ngloom of his cell and was unseen. Horror could add nothing to the prison\npallor, which had driven every particle of color from his cheeks. Out of\nthese commonplace details was to come the final tragedy. Those men in\nfaded overalls were preparing for his death,--a limit had been fixed to\nthe very hours that he might live. On the morning of the tenth of June\nhe would see earth and sky from that window for the last time!\n\nChance passers-by with no very urgent affairs of their own on hand,\ndrifted up from the street, and soon a little group had assembled in the\nalley to watch the two carpenters at their work, or to stare up at\nNorth's strongly barred window. Now and again a man would point out this\nwindow to some new-corner not so well informed as himself.\n\nWhenever North looked down into the alley that morning, there was the\nhuman grouping with its changing personnel. Men sprawled on the piles of\nboards, or lounged about the yard, while the murmur of their idle talk\nreached him in his cell. The visible excuse which served to bring them\nthere was commonplace enough, but it was invested with the interest of a\ncoming tragedy, and North's own thoughts went forward to the time when\nthe fence should be finished, when somewhere within the space it\ninclosed would stand his gallows.\n\nShortly before the noon whistles blew, two little girls came into the\nalley with the carpenters' dinner pails. They made their way timidly\nthrough the crowd, casting shy glances to the right and left; at a word\nfrom one of the men they placed the dinner pails beside the pile of\nlumber and hurried away; but at the street corner they paused, and with\nwide eyes stared up in the direction of North's window.\n\nA moment later the whistles sounded and the idlers dispersed, while the\ntwo mechanics threw down their hammers and took possession of the lumber\npile. After they had eaten, they lighted their pipes and smoked in\nsilent contentment; but before their pipes were finished the crowd began\nto reassemble, and all that afternoon the shifting changing groups stood\nabout in the alley, watching the building of the fence. At no time were\nthe two carpenters without an audience. This continued from day to day\nuntil the structure was completed, then for a week there was no work\ndone within the inclosure. It remained empty and deserted, with its\nlitter of chips, of blocks and of board ends.\n\nOn the morning of the first Monday in May, North was standing before his\nwindow when the two mechanics entered the yard from the jail; they\nbrought tools, and one carried a roll of blue paper under his arm; this\nhe spread out on a board and both men examined it carefully. Next they\ncrossed to the lumber pile and looked it over. They were evidently\nmaking some sort of calculation. Then they pulled on their overalls and\nwent to work, and in one corner of the yard--the corner opposite North's\nwindow--they began to build his scaffold. The thing took shape before\nhis very eyes, a monstrous anachronism.\n\nGeneral Herbert had not been idle while the unhurried preparations for\nJohn North's execution were going forward; whatever his secret feeling\nwas, neither his words nor his manner conceded defeat. Belknap had tried\nevery expedient known to criminal practice to secure a new trial but had\nfailed, and it was now evident that without the intervention of the\ngovernor, North's doom was fixed unalterably. Belknap quitted Mount Hope\nfor Columbus, and there followed daily letters and almost hourly\ntelegrams, but General Herbert felt from the first that the lawyer was\nnot sanguine of success. Then on the eighth of June, two days before the\nexecution, came a long message from the lawyer. His wife was ill, her\nrecovery was doubtful; the governor was fully possessed of the facts in\nNorth's case and was considering them, would the general come at once to\nColumbus?\n\nThis telegram reached Idle Hour late at night, and the next morning\nfather and daughter were driven into Mount Hope. The pleasant life with\nits agreeable ordering which the general had known for ten peaceful\nyears had resolved itself into a mad race with time. The fearful, the\nmonstrous, seemed to reach out and grip him with skeleton fingers. Like\nthe pale silent girl at his side, he was knowing the horror of death,\nand a horror that was beyond death.\n\nThey stopped at the jail to say good-by to North, and were then driven\nrapidly to the station. The journey of about two hours seemed\ninterminable, but they rarely spoke. Elizabeth did not change the\nposition she had assumed when they took their seats. She leaned lightly\nagainst her father's broad shoulder and her hands were clasped in her\nlap.\n\nFor weeks the situation had been absolutely pitiless. Their wrecked\nefforts were at the door of every hope, and if this mission failed--but\nit would not fail! All they had come to ask was the life of an innocent\nman, and surely the governor, unaffected by local prejudice, must\nrealize John North's innocence.\n\nIt was two o'clock when they reached their destination, and as they left\nthe car the general said:\n\n\"We will go to the hotel first. Either Judge Belknap will be there, or\nthere will be some word for us.\"\n\nAt the hotel they found, not Belknap, but a letter which he had left.\nThe governor was suffering from a slight indisposition and was confined\nto the house. Belknap had made an appointment for him, and he would be\nexpected. The general crushed the sheet of paper between his fingers\nwith weary impatience.\n\n\"We'll see the governor at once. I'll call a carriage,\" he said briefly.\n\nFive minutes later, when they had left the hotel, Elizabeth asked:\n\n\"What did Judge Belknap say?\"\n\n\"Nothing, dear, nothing--the matter remains just as it was. The governor\nis expecting us.\"\n\n\"What do you think, father? This is our last hope. Oh, do you realize\nthat?\"\n\nShe rested her hand on his arm.\n\n\"It's going to be all right!\" her father assured her.\n\nThen there was silence between them until they drew up before the\ngovernor's house.\n\nSide by side they mounted the steps. The general's ring was answered by\na man-servant, who took their cards after showing them into a small\nreception-room. He returned after a moment to say that the governor was\noccupied and could not possibly see them until the afternoon. The\ngeneral's face was blank. He had never considered it possible that the\ngovernor would refuse to see him at his convenience. Certainly there had\nbeen a time when no politician of his party in the state nor in the\nnation would have ventured this; but it was evident the last ten years\nhad made a difference in his position. Elizabeth gazed up fearfully into\nher father's face. What did this mean; was it merely a subterfuge on the\ngovernor's part to avoid a painful interview? Perhaps, after all, it\nwould have been better had she remained at the hotel. Her father read\nher thoughts.\n\n\"It's all right--be brave!\" he whispered. He turned to the servant.\n\"Will you kindly learn for me at what hour the governor will be at\nliberty?\" he said stiffly.\n\n\"Oh, he must see us!\" cried Elizabeth, the moment they were alone.\n\n\"Of course he must, and he will,\" the general said.\n\nBut the governor's refusal to see them at once rankled within him. His\nsunburnt cheeks were a brick red and there was an angry light in his\ngray eyes. The servant did not return, but in his stead came a dapper\nyoung fellow, the governor's private secretary.\n\n\"General Herbert?\" he asked inquiringly, as he entered the room.\n\nThe general acknowledged his identity by an inclination of the head.\n\n\"The governor will be most happy to see you at any time after three\no'clock. May I tell him you will call then?\" asked the secretary, and he\nglanced, not without sympathy and understanding, at Elizabeth.\n\n\"We will return at three,\" the general said.\n\n\"He regrets his inability to see you now,\" murmured the secretary, and\nagain he permitted his glance to dwell on the girl's pale beauty.\n\nHe bowed them from the room and from the house. When the door closed on\nthem, Elizabeth turned swiftly to her father.\n\n\"He is cruel, heartless, to keep us in suspense. A word, a moment--might\nhave meant so much to us--\" she sobbed.\n\nA spasm of pain contracted her father's rugged features.\n\n\"He will see us; he is a busy man with unceasing demands on his time,\nbut we have this appointment. Be brave, dear, just a little longer!\" he\nsaid tenderly.\n\n\"I'll try to be, but there is only to-day--and to-morrow--\" she\nfaltered.\n\n\"Hush, you must not think of that!\"\n\n\"I can think of nothing else!\"\n\nHow they lived through the long hours the general never knew, but at\nlast three o'clock came and they were again at the governor's door. It\nwas opened by the servant who had admitted them earlier in the day.\n\n\"We have an appointment with the governor,\" said General Herbert\nbriefly, pushing past him.\n\n\"Yes, sir; I will tell him you are here as soon as he comes in,\" said\nthe man.\n\n\"He's out, then?\" and General Herbert wheeled on the man.\n\n\"Yes, but he's expected back any moment, sir.\"\n\n\"It will be all right,\" her father again assured Elizabeth, speaking\nwith forced cheerfulness when they were alone.\n\nTen--twenty minutes slipped by; minutes that were infinitely precious,\nthen a step sounded in the hall. It was the servant who entered the\nroom, however. He came to say that a message had that moment been\nreceived from the governor; he was detained at the capitol, and probably\nwould not reach home before five o'clock.\n\n\"Does he say he will see us there?\" asked the general.\n\n\"He didn't mention you, sir; perhaps he has forgotten, but I thought\nyou'd wish to know.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The general turned to his daughter. \"I think we'd better go\nto the capitol.\"\n\nThe carriage was still at the door and they hurried out to it and were\nwhirled across town. As they came to a stand before the capitol, General\nHerbert, without waiting for Elizabeth, sprang out and strode into the\nbuilding and up the familiar stairs to the executive chambers. The door\nof the outer office stood open. A colored janitor was sweeping the room.\n\n\"Who you want, boss?\" he asked, stopping his work and leaning on the\nhandle of his broom.\n\n\"The governor--where is he?\" demanded the general.\n\n\"You's too late, boss, he's done gone out.\"\n\nA sense of futility and defeat almost overwhelmed the old general. He\nwas silent for a moment since he dared not trust himself to speak, then\nhe asked:\n\n\"Is the governor's secretary here?\"\n\nThe man shook his head.\n\n\"Him and the governor left together. There ain't no one here now,\nthey've done for the day.\"\n\n\"Then the governor has gone home?\"\n\n\"I expect that's where he went, yes, sir.\"\n\nGeneral Herbert swung about and hurried from the room. In the hall he\nmet Elizabeth.\n\n\"Did you see him?\" she asked eagerly.\n\n\"Not here,\" he answered huskily.\n\nHer eyes grew wide with terror, and she swayed as if about to fall, but\nher father put out a sunburnt hand for her support.\n\n\"We must go back!\" he said, mastering himself at sight of her suffering.\n\"We have missed him here, he's gone home, that is all--it means\nnothing.\"\n\nThey drove in silence through the streets. Pallid, fearful, and\nspeechless in her suffering, Elizabeth leaned back in her seat. The hope\nthat had sustained her was lost in the realization of defeat. There was\nnothing beyond; this was failure, complete and final; the very end of\neffort! Suddenly her father's big hand closed about the small one which\nrested in her lap.\n\n\"You must not give up; I tell you it will be all right!\" he insisted.\n\n\"He is avoiding us!\" she cried chokingly. \"Oh, what can we do when he\nwill not even see us!\"\n\n\"Yes, he will. We have been unfortunate, that is all.\"\n\n\"Wretchedly unfortunate!\" she moaned.\n\nThey had reached their destination, and this time slowly and uncertainly\nthey ascended the steps. With his hand upon the bell, the general\nhesitated for an instant; so much was at stake! Then a bell sounded in\nsome distant part of the house, and after a brief interval the door was\nopened to them.\n\n\"I am sorry, sir, but the governor has not returned.\"\n\nThe general thrust a bill into the man's hand, saying:\n\n\"The moment he comes in, see that he gets my card.\"\n\nAgain there was delay. General Herbert, consumed by impatience, crossed\nand recrossed the room. Elizabeth stood by the window, one hand parting\nthe heavy curtains. It was already late afternoon. The day had been\nwasted, and the hours that remained to them were perilously few. But\nmore than the thought of North's death, the death itself filled her mind\nwith unspeakable imaginings. The power to control her thoughts was lost,\nand her terrors took her where they would, until North's very death\nstruggles became a blinding horror. Somewhere in the silent house, a\ndoor opened and closed.\n\n\"At last!\" said the general, under his breath.\n\nBut it was only the governor's secretary who entered the room. He halted\nin the doorway and glanced from father to daughter. There was no\nmistaking the look on his face.\n\n\"How much longer are we to be kept in doubt?\" asked General Herbert, in\na voice that indicated both his dread and his sense of insult.\n\n\"The governor deeply regrets that there should have been this delay--\"\nbegan the secretary.\n\n\"He is ready to see us now?\" General Herbert interrupted.\n\n\"I regret--\"\n\n\"What do you regret? Do you mean to tell me that he will not see us?\"\ndemanded the general.\n\n\"The governor has left town.\"\n\nThe angry color flamed into the old man's cheeks. His sorely tried\npatience was on the point of giving way, but a cry from the window\nrecalled him.\n\n\"Where has he gone?\"\n\n\"He left for the East at four o'clock,\" faltered the secretary, after a\nmoment of wretched irresolution.\n\nThe general's face became white, as his anger yielded to a more powerful\nemotion.\n\n\"Impossible!\" he cried.\n\n\"The North matter has been left in my hands,\" said the secretary\nhaltingly.\n\nThe general's hope revived as he heard this. He stepped to Elizabeth's\nside and rested his hand protectingly on her shoulder.\n\n\"You have the governor's decision?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the secretary unsteadily.\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"What is it?\" The general's voice was strained and unnatural.\n\n\"He regrets it, but he does not deem it proper for him to interfere with\nthe decision of the court. He has had the most eminent legal advice in\nthis case--\"\n\nA choking inarticulate cry from Elizabeth interrupted him.\n\n\"My God!\" cried her father, as Elizabeth's groping hands clung to him.\nHe felt the shudder that wrenched her slim body. \"Be brave!\" he\nwhispered, slipping his arms about her.\n\n\"Oh, father--father--\" she sobbed.\n\n\"We will go home,\" said the general.\n\nHe looked up from the bowed head that rested against his shoulder,\nexpecting to find the secretary still standing by the door, but that\ndapper young man had stolen from the room.\n\n\"Yes, take me home,\" said Elizabeth.\n\nHe led her from the house and the door closed behind them on their last\nhope. Both shared in the bitter consciousness of this. They had been\nbrought face to face with the inexorable demands of life, they had been\nforedoomed to failure from the very beginning.\n\n\"Father?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Yes, dear?\" He spoke with infinite tenderness.\n\n\"Is there nothing more?\"\n\n\"Nothing, but to go home.\"\n\nDeeply as he felt for her, he knew that he realized only an\ninfinitesimal part of her suffering.\n\n\"The governor has refused to interfere?\"\n\n\"You heard what he said, dear,\" he answered simply.\n\n\"And I have to go back and tell John that after all our hopes, after all\nour prayers--\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would better not go back,\" he suggested.\n\n\"Not go back? No, I must see him! You would not deny me this--\"\n\n\"I would deny you nothing,\" said her father fervently.\n\n\"Dismiss the carriage, and we will walk to the station; there is time?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor a little while they walked on in silence, the girl's hands clasped\nabout her father's arm.\n\n\"I can not understand it yet!\" said Elizabeth at length, speaking in a\nfearful whisper. \"It is incredible. Oh, can't you save him--can't you?\"\n\nThe general did not trust himself to answer her.\n\n\"We have failed. Do you think it would have been different if Judge\nBelknap had not been called away?\"\n\nGeneral Herbert shook his head.\n\n\"And now we must go back to him! We were to have telegraphed him; we\nwon't now, will we?\"\n\n\"My poor, poor Elizabeth!\" cried the general brokenly.\n\n\"How shall we ever tell him!\"\n\n\"I will go alone,\" said the general.\n\n\"No, no--I must see him! You are sure we have time to catch our\ntrain--if we should miss it--\" and the thought gave her a sudden\nfeverish energy.\n\n\"You need not hurry,\" her father assured her.\n\n\"But look at your watch!\" she entreated.\n\n\"We have half an hour,\" he said.\n\n\"You can think of nothing more to do?\" she asked, after another brief\nsilence.\n\n\"Nothing, dear.\"\n\nLittle was said until they boarded the train, but in the drawing-room of\nthe Pullman which her father had been able to secure, Elizabeth's\nrestraint forsook her, and she abandoned herself to despair. Her father\nsilently took his place at her side. Oppressed and preoccupied, the\nsting of defeat unmitigated, he was struggling with the problem of the\nfuture. The morrow with its hideous tragedy seemed both the end and the\nbeginning. One thing was clear to him, they must go away from Idle Hour\nwhere North had been so much a part of Elizabeth's life. Nothing had\nbeen added to this decision when at length the train pulled into Mount\nHope.\n\n\"We are home, dear,\" he said gently.\n\n[Illustration: She abandoned herself to despair.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n\nTHE LAST LONG DAY\n\n\nA long day, the last of many long days he told himself, was ended, and\nJohn North stood by his window. Below in the yard into which he was\nlooking, but within the black shadow cast by the jail, was the gallows.\nThough indistinguishable in the darkness, its shape was seared on his\nbrain, for he had lived in close fellowship with all it emphasized. It\nwas his gallows, it had grown to completion under his very eyes that it\nmight destroy him in the last hour.\n\nThere had been for him a terrible fascination in the gaunt thing that\ngave out the odor of new wood; a thing men had made with their own\nhands; a clumsy device to inflict a brutal death; a left-over from\nbarbarism which denied every claim of civilization and Christianity!\nNow, as the moon crept up from behind the distant hills, the black\nshadows retreated, and as he watched, timber by timber the gallows stood\nforth distinct in the soft clear light. In a few hours, unless the\ngovernor interfered, he would pass through the door directly below his\nwindow. He pictured the group of grave-faced nervous officials, he saw\nhimself bound and blindfolded and helpless in their midst.\n\nHis fingers closed convulsively about the iron bars that guarded his\nwindow, but the feeling of horror that suddenly seized him was remote\nfrom self-pity. He was thinking of Elizabeth. What unspeakable\nwretchedness he had brought into her life, and he was still to bequeath\nher this squalid brutal death! It was the crowning shame and misery to\nthe long months of doubt and fearful suspense.\n\nUp from the earth came the scent of living growing things. The leaves of\nthe great maples in the court-house grounds rustled in the spring\nbreeze, there was the soft incessant hum of insect life, and over all\nthe white wonderful moonlight. But he had no part in this universal\nrenewal--he was to die his purposeless unheroic death in the morning.\nFor himself he could almost believe he no longer cared; he had fully\naccepted the idea. He had even taken his farewell of the few in Mount\nHope who had held steadfast in their friendship, and there only remained\nfor him to die decently; to meet the inevitable with whatever courage\nthere was in his soul.\n\nHe heard Brockett's familar step and suddenly, intent and listening, he\nfaced the door; but the deputy came slowly down the corridor and as he\nentered the cell, paused, and shook his head.\n\n\"No word yet, John,\" he said regretfully.\n\n\"Is the train in?\" asked North.\n\n\"Yes, Conklin went down to meet it. He's just back; I guess they'll come\non the ten-thirty.\"\n\nNorth again turned listlessly toward the window.\n\n\"I wouldn't own myself beat yet, John!\" said the deputy.\n\n\"I've gone down at every crisis! I didn't think the grand jury would\nindict me, I didn't think I would be convicted at the trial!\" He made a\nweary gesture. \"What right have I to think they will be able to\ninfluence the governor?\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence broken by the deputy.\n\n\"I'll be outside, and if you want anything, let me know.\"\n\nIt was the death-watch, and poor Brockett was to keep it.\n\nNorth fell to pacing his narrow bounds. Without, the wind had risen and\npresently there came the patter of rain on the roof. Thick darkness\nagain enveloped the jail yard; and the gallows--his gallows--was no\nlonger visible. For an hour or more the storm raged and then it passed\nas swiftly as it had gathered. Once more he became aware of the\nincessant hum of the insect world, and the rustling of the great maples\nin the court-house grounds.\n\nAs he listened to these sounds, from somewhere off in the distance he\nheard the shriek of an engine's whistle. They were coming now if they\ncame at all! In spite of himself, his hope revived. To believe that they\nhad failed was out of the question, and the beat of his pulse and the\nthrob of his heart quickened.\n\nHe endured twenty minutes of suspense, then he heard voices; Brockett\nthrew open the door, and Elizabeth, white-faced and shaking, was before\nhim.\n\n\"John!\" she cried, with such anguish that in one terrible instant all\nhope went from him.\n\nHis soul seemed to stand naked at the very gates of death, and the\nvision of his brutal ending came before his burning eyes. Words of\nprotest trembled on his lips. This endured but for an imperceptible\nspace of time, and then that larger pity which was not for himself but\nfor Elizabeth, took him quickly to her side.\n\n\"John--\" she cried again, and held out her arms.\n\n\"Do not speak--I know,\" he said.\n\nHer head drooped on his shoulder, and her strength seemed to forsake\nher.\n\n\"I know, dear!\" he repeated.\n\n\"We could do nothing!\" she gasped.\n\n\"You have done everything that love and devotion could do!\"\n\nShe looked up into his face.\n\n\"You are not afraid?\" she whispered, clinging to him.\n\n\"I think not,\" he said simply.\n\n\"You are very brave, John--I shall try to be brave, also.\"\n\n\"My dear, dear Elizabeth!\" he murmured sadly, and they were silent.\n\nWithout, in the corridor, an occasional whispered word passed between\nGeneral Herbert and the deputy.\n\n\"The governor would do nothing, John,\" Elizabeth faltered at length.\n\n\"I understand, dear,\" he said tenderly.\n\n\"He would not even see us; we went repeatedly to his house and to the\ncapitol, and in the end we saw his secretary. The governor had left\ntown; he never intended to see us! To reach this end--when nothing can\nbe done--\" Her eyes grew wide with horror.\n\nHe drew her closer, and touched her cold lips with his.\n\n\"There is one thing you can do that will be a comfort to me, Elizabeth;\nlet your father take you home!\"\n\n\"No, no, I must stay till morning, until the day breaks--don't send me\naway, John!\" she entreated.\n\n\"It will be easier--\"\n\nYet his arms still held her close to him, and he gazed down into the\nupturned face that rested against his breast. It was his keen sense of\nher suffering that weighed on him now. What a wreck he had made of her\nlife--what infinite compassion and pity he felt! He held her closer.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\" she asked.\n\nBut he could not translate his feeling into words.\n\n\"Oh, if there were only something we could do!\" she moaned.\n\n\"Through all these weeks you have given me hope and strength! You say\nthat I am brave! Your love and devotion have lifted me out of myself; I\nwould be ashamed to be a coward when I think of all you have endured!\"\n\nHe felt her shiver in his arms, then in the momentary silence the\ncourt-house bell struck the half-hour.\n\n\"I thought it was later,\" she said, as the stroke of the bell died out\nin the stillness.\n\n\"It is best that you should leave this place, dearest--\"\n\n\"Don't send me from you, John--I can not bear that yet--\" she implored.\n\nPityingly and tenderly his eyes looked deep into hers. What had she not\nendured for his sake! And the long days of effort had terminated in this\nlast agony of disappointment; but now, and almost mercifully, he felt\nthe fruitless struggle was ended. All that remained was the acceptance\nof an inexorable fate. He drew forward his chair for her, and as she\nsank wearily into it, he seated himself on the edge of the cot at her\nside.\n\n\"McBride's murderer will be found one of these days, and then all the\nworld will know that what you believe is the truth,\" said North at\nlength.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" replied Elizabeth simply.\n\nSome whispered word of General Herbert's or the deputy's reached them in\nthe interval of silence that ensued. Then presently in that silence they\nhad both feared to break, the court-house bell rang again. It was\ntwelve o'clock. Elizabeth rose.\n\n\"I am going now--John--\" she said, in a voice so low that he scarcely\nheard her. \"I am going home. You wish it--and you must sleep--\" She\ncaught his hands and pressed them to her heart.\n\n\"Oh, my darling--good night--\"\n\nShe came closer in his arms, and held up her lips for him to kiss. The\npassion of life had given place to the chill of death. It was to-day\nthat he was to die! No longer could they think of it as a thing of\nto-morrow, for at last the day had come.\n\n\"Yes, you must go,\" he said, in the same low voice in which she had\nspoken.\n\n\"I love you, John--\"\n\n\"As I do you, beloved--\" he answered gently.\n\n\"Oh, I can not leave you! My place is here with you to the very last--do\nnot send me away!\"\n\n\"I could not bear it,\" he said steadily. \"You must leave Mount Hope\nto-morrow--to-day--\"\n\nHe felt her arms tighten about his neck.\n\n\"To-day?\" she faltered miserably. \"To-day--\"\n\nHer arms relaxed. He pressed his lips to her pale cold lips and to her\neyes, from which the light of consciousness had fled.\n\n\"General Herbert!\" he called.\n\nInstantly the general appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"She has fainted!\" said North.\n\nHer father turned as if with some vague notion of asking assistance, but\nNorth checked him.\n\n\"For God's sake take her away while she is still unconscious!\" and he\nplaced her in her father's arms. For a moment his hand lingered on the\ngeneral's shoulder. \"Thank you--good-by!\" and he turned away abruptly.\n\n\"Good-by--God bless you, John!\" said the general in a strained voice.\n\nHe seemed to hesitate for a moment as if he wished to say more; then as\nNorth kept his back turned on him, he gathered the unconscious girl\ncloser in his arms, and walked from the room.\n\nNorth remained by the window, his hands clutching the bars with\nconvulsive strength, then the wind which blew fresh and strong in his\nface brought him the sound of wheels; but this quickly died out in the\ndistance.\n\nBrockett tiptoed into the cell.\n\n\"I am going to lie down and see if I can get some sleep,\" North said,\nthrowing off his coat. \"If I sleep, call me as soon as it is light--good\nnight.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n\nON THE HIGH IRON BRIDGE\n\n\nAs the weeks had passed Marshall Langham had felt his fears lift\nsomewhat, but the days and nights still remained endless cycles of\ntorment. Wherever he turned and with whomsoever he talked the North case\nwas certain sooner or later to be mentioned. There were hideous rumors\nafloat, too, concerning General Herbert's activity in behalf of the\ncondemned man, and in spite of his knowledge of the law, he was\nprofoundly affected by this wild gossip, this ignorant conjecture, which\nreason and experience alike told him misstated every fact that bore on\nthe situation. He was learning just how dependent he had been on\nGilmore; no strange imaginings, no foolish vagaries had ever beset the\ngambler, his brutal vigor had yielded nothing to terror or remorse.\n\nHe knew the Herberts had gone to Columbus to make a final appeal to the\ngovernor. Father and daughter had been driven across the Square by\nThompson, the Idle Hour foreman, and they had passed below the windows\nof Langham's office on their way to the station. It had seemed to him an\niniquitous thing that the old statesman's position and influence should\nbe brought into the case to defeat his hopes, to rob him of his\nvengeance, to imperil his very safety. Racked and tortured, he had no\nexistence outside his fear and hate. All that day Langham haunted the\nrailway station. If any word did come over the wires, he wished to know\nit at once, and if General Herbert returned he wished to see him, since\nhis appearance must indicate success or failure. If it were failure the\nknowledge would come none too quickly; if success, in any degree, he\ncontemplated instant flight, for he was obsessed by the belief that then\nhe would somehow stand in imminent peril.\n\nHe was pacing the long platform when the afternoon train arrived, but\nhis bloodshot eyes searched the crowd in vain for a sight of General\nHerbert's stalwart figure.\n\n\"He has just one more chance to get back in time!\" he told himself. \"If\nhe doesn't come to-night it means I am safe!\"\n\nHis bloodless lips sucked in the warm air. Safe! It was the first time\nin months he had dared to tell himself this; yet a moment later and his\nfears were crowding back crushing him to earth. The general might do\nmuch in the six hours that remained to him.\n\nHe was back at his post when the night train drew in, and his heart gave\na great leap in his breast as he saw the general descend from the\nplatform of the sleeper and then turn to assist Elizabeth. She was\nclosely veiled, but one glance at the pair sufficed.\n\nLangham passed down the long platform. The flickering gas-jets that\nburned at intervals under the wide eaves of the low station were\nluminous suns, his brain whirled and his step was unsteady. He passed\nout into the night, and when the friendly darkness had closed about him,\nslipped a feverish palm across his eyes and thanked God that his season\nof despair was at an end. He had suffered and endured but now he was\nsafe!\n\nBefore him the train, with its trailing echoes, had dwindled away into\nthe silence of the spring night. Scarcely conscious of the direction he\nwas taking he walked down the track toward the iron bridge. It was as if\nsome miracle of healing had come to him; his heavy step grew light, his\nshaking hands became steady, his brain clear; in those first moments of\nsecurity he was the ease-seeking, pleasure-loving Marshall Langham of\nseven months before.\n\nAs he strode forward he became aware that some one was ahead of him on\nthe track, then presently at the bridge a match was struck, and his\neyes, piercing the intervening darkness, saw that a man had paused there\nto light a pipe. He was quite near the bridge himself when another match\nflared, and he was able to distinguish the figure of this man who was\ncrouching back of one of the iron girders. A puff of wind extinguished\nthe second match almost immediately, and after a moment or two in which\nthe lawyer continued to advance, a third match was struck; at the same\ninstant the man must have heard the sound of Langham's approach, for as\nhe brought the blazing match to the bowl of a short black pipe, he\nturned, standing erect, and Langham caught sight of his face. It was Joe\nMontgomery. Another playful gust found Mr. Montgomery's match and the\ntwo men stood facing each other in the darkness.\n\nLangham had been about to speak but the words died on his lips; a wave\nof horror passed over him. He had known not quite ten minutes of\nsecurity and now it was at an end; his terror all revived; this hulking\nbrute who faced him there in the darkness menaced his safety, a few\ndrinks might give him courage to go to Moxlow or to the general with his\nconfession. How was he to deal with the situation?\n\n\"There ain't much Irish about me!\" said Montgomery, with a casual oath.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The handy-man was searching his pockets\nfor a fresh match.\n\n\"Why have you come back, Joe?\" asked Langham finally, when he could\ncommand himself.\n\nMontgomery started violently and his pipe fell from his mouth.\n\n\"Is that you, Boss Langham?\" he faltered.\n\nHe stared about him seeking to pierce the darkness, fearful that Langham\nwas not alone, that Gilmore might be somewhere near.\n\n\"Are you by yourself, boss?\" he asked, and a tremor stole into his\nhoarse throaty voice. He still carried the scars of that fearful beating\nGilmore had administered.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Langham. \"I'm alone.\"\n\n\"I didn't know but Andy Gilmore might be with you, boss,\" said\nMontgomery, clearing his throat.\n\n\"No, he's not here,\" replied Langham quietly. \"He's left town.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he'll be comin' back!\" said the handy-man with a short laugh.\n\n\"No, he's gone for good.\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't sorry. I hope to God I never see him again--he beat me up\nawful! I was as good a friend as he'll ever have; I was a perfect yellow\ndog to him; he whistled and I jumped, but I'll be damned if I ever jump\nagain! Say, I got about eighteen inches of old gas-pipe slid down my\npants leg now for Mr. Andy; one good slug with that, and he won't have\nno remarks to make about my goin' home to my old woman!\"\n\n\"You won't have to use it.\"\n\n\"I'm almost sorry,\" said Montgomery.\n\n\"I suppose that thirst of yours is unimpaired?\" inquired Langham.\n\nHis burning eyes never for an instant forsook the dark outline of the\nhandy-man's slouching figure.\n\n\"I dunno, boss, I ain't been drinkin' much lately. Liquor's a bully\nthing to keep the holes in your pants, and your toes out where you can\nlook at 'em if you want to. I dunno as I'll ever take up\nwhisky-drinkin' again,\" concluded Mr. Montgomery, with a self-denying\nshake of the head.\n\n\"Are you glad to be back, Joe?\" asked Langham.\n\nIt was anything to gain time, he was thinking desperately but to no\npurpose.\n\n\"Glad! Stick all the cuss words you know in front of that and it will be\nmild!\" cried Montgomery feelingly. \"It's pitiful the way I been used,\njust knocked from pillar to post; I've seen dogs right here in Mount\nHope that had a lot happier time than I've been havin'--and me a married\nman! I've always tried to be a good husband, I hope there won't be no\ncall for me to make a rough-house of it to-night!\" he added playfully,\nas he looked off across the bridge.\n\n\"I guess not, Joe,\" said Langham.\n\nHis fears assembled themselves before him like a phantom host. How was\nhe to deal with the handy-man; how would Gilmore have dealt with him?\nHad the time gone by to bully and bribe, or was that still the method by\nwhich he could best safeguard his life?\n\n\"Say, boss, what they done with young John North?\" Montgomery suddenly\ndemanded.\n\n\"Nothing yet,\" answered Langham after an instant's pause.\n\n\"Ain't he had his trial?\" Montgomery asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, ain't they done anything with him? If he ain't been sent up, he's\nbeen turned loose.\"\n\n\"Neither, Joe,\" rejoined Langham slowly. \"The jury didn't agree. His\nfriends are trying to get the judge to dismiss the case.\"\n\n\"That would suit me bully, boss, if they done that!\" cried the\nhandy-man.\n\nLangham caught the tone of relief.\n\n\"I don't want to see him hang; I don't want to see no one hang, I'm all\nin favor of livin', myself. Say, I had a sweet time out West! I'd a died\nyonder; I couldn't stand it, I had to come back--just had to!\"\n\nHe was shaking and wretched, and he exaggerated no part of the misery he\nhad known.\n\n\"When did you get in?\" asked Langham.\n\n\"I beat my way in on the ten-thirty; I rode most of the way from\nColumbus on top of the baggage car--I'm half dead, boss!\"\n\n\"Have you seen any one?\"\n\n\"No one but you. I got off at the crossin' where they slow up and come\nalong here; I wasn't thinkin' of a damn thing but gettin' home to my old\nwoman. I guess I'll hit the ties right now!\" he concluded with sudden\nresolution, and once more his small blue eyes were turned toward the\nbridge.\n\n\"I'll walk across to the other side with you,\" said Langham hastily.\n\n\"The crick's up quite a bit!\" said the handy-man as they set foot on the\nbridge.\n\nLangham glanced out into the gloom, where swollen by the recent rains\nthe stream splashed and whirled between its steep banks.\n\n\"Yes, way up!\" he answered.\n\nAs he spoke he stepped close to Montgomery's side and raised his voice.\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" said Joe halting. \"I shan't need this now,\" and he drew\nthe piece of gas-pipe from his trousers pocket. \"I'd have hammered the\nlife out of Andy Gilmore!\" he said, as he tossed the ugly bludgeon from\nhim.\n\n\"You haven't told me where you have been,\" said Langham, and once more\nhe pressed close to Montgomery, so close their elbows touched.\n\nThe handy-man moved a little to one side.\n\n\"Where _ain't_ I been, you better ask, boss,\" he said. \"I seen more\nrotten cities and more rotten towns and more rotten country than you can\nshake a stick at; God A'mighty knows what's the good of it--I dunno!\nEverybody I seen was strangers to me, never a face I knowed anywhere;\nChicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Denver--to hell with 'em all, boss; old\nMount Hope's good enough for me!\" And the handy-man shrugged his huge\nslanting shoulders.\n\n\"Don't go so fast, Joe!\" Langham cautioned, and his eyes searched the\ndarkness ahead of them.\n\n\"It's a risky business for you, boss,\" said the handy-man. \"You ain't\nused to this bridge like me.\"\n\n\"Do you always come this way?\" asked Langham.\n\n\"Always, in all seasons and all shapes, drunk or sober, winter or\nsummer,\" said the handy-man.\n\n\"One wouldn't have much chance if he slipped off here to-night,\" said\nLangham with a shudder.\n\n\"Mighty little,\" agreed Montgomery. \"Say, step over, boss--we want to\nkeep in the middle! There--that's better, I was clean outside the rail.\"\n\n\"Can you swim?\" asked Langham.\n\n\"Never swum a stroke. The dirt's good enough for me; I got a notion that\nthese here people who are always dippin' themselves are just naturally\nfilthy. Look at me, a handy-man doing all kinds of odd jobs, who's got a\nbetter right to get dirty--but I leave it alone and it wears off. I'm\nblame certain you won't find many people that fool away less money on\nsoap than just me!\" said Joe with evident satisfaction. \"The old woman's\nup!\" he cried, as he caught the glimmer of a light on the shore beyond.\n\nPerhaps unconsciously he quickened his pace.\n\n\"Not so fast, Joe!\" gasped Langham.\n\n\"Oh, all right, boss!\" responded Montgomery.\n\nLangham turned to him quickly, but as he did so his foot struck the\ncinder ballast of the road-bed.\n\n\"Good night, boss!\" said Joe, his eyes fixed on the distant light.\n\n\"Wait!\" said Langham imperiously.\n\n\"What for?\" demanded Montgomery.\n\n\"The water made such a noise I couldn't talk to you out on the bridge,\"\nbegan Langham.\n\n\"Well, I can't stop now, boss,\" said the handy-man, turning impatiently\nfrom him.\n\n\"Yes, damn you--you can--and will!\" and Langham raised his voice to give\nweight to his words.\n\nMontgomery rounded up his shoulders.\n\n\"Don't you try that, boss! Andy Gilmore could shout me down and cuss me\nout, but you can't; and I'll peel the face off you if you lay hands on\nme!\" He thrust out a grimy fist and menaced Langham with it. There was a\nbrief silence and the handy-man swung about on his heel.\n\n\"Good night, boss!\" he said over his shoulder, as he moved off.\n\nLangham made no answer, but long after Joe's shuffling steps had died\naway in the distance he was still standing there irresolute and\nundecided, staring fixedly off into the darkness that had swallowed up\nthe handy-man's hulking figure.\n\nMr. Montgomery, muttering somewhat and wagging his head, continued along\nthe track for a matter of a hundred yards, when his feet found a narrow\npath which led off in the direction of the light he had so confidently\ndeclared was his old woman's. Then presently as he shuffled forward, the\nother seven houses of the row of which his was the eighth, cloaked in\nutter darkness, took shadowy form against the sky. The handy-man\nstumbled into his unkempt front yard, its metes and bounds but\nindifferently defined by the remnants of what had been a picket fence;\nhe made his way to the side door, which he threw open without ceremony.\nAs he had surmised, his old woman was up. She was seated by the table in\nthe corner, engaged in mending the ragged trousers belonging to Joseph\nMontgomery, junior.\n\nAt sight of Joe, senior, she screamed and flung them aside; then white\nand shaking she came weakly to her feet. The handy-man grinned genially.\nHe was not of demonstrative temperament.\n\n\"Joe!\" cried Nellie, as she sprang toward him. \"Dear Joe!\" and she threw\nher arms about him.\n\n\"Oh, hell!\" said the handy-man.\n\nNellie was hanging limply about his neck and he was aware that she had\nkissed him; he could not remember when before she had taken such a\nliberty. Mr. Montgomery believed in a reasonable display of affection,\nbut kissing seemed to him a singularly frivolous practice.\n\n\"Oh, my man!\" sobbed Nellie.\n\n\"Oh, cheese it, and let me loose--I don't like this to-do! Can't a\nmarried man come home without all this fuss?\"\n\n\"Dear Joe, you've come back to me and your babies!\" And the tears\nstreamed down her cheeks.\n\n\"I don't need you to tell me that--I got plenty sense enough to know\nwhen I'm home!\" said Montgomery, not without bitterness.\n\n\"I mourned you like you was passed away, until your letter come!\" said\nNellie, and the memory of her sufferings set her sobbing afresh.\n\n\"Oh, great hell!\" exclaimed Joe dejectedly. \"Why can't you act\ncheerful? What's the good of takin' on, anyhow--I don't like tombstone\ntalk.\"\n\n\"It was just the shock of seein' you standin' there in the door like I\nseen you so often!\" said Nellie weakly.\n\n\"If that ain't a woman for you, miserable because she's happy. Say, stop\nchokin' me; I won't stand for much more of this nonsense, you might know\nI don't like these to-dos!\"\n\n\"You don't know what I've suffered, Joe!\"\n\n\"That's a woman for you every time--always thinkin' of herself! To hear\nyou talk any one would think I'd been to a church picnic; I look like\nI'd been to a picnic, don't I? Yes, I do--like hell!\"\n\n\"They said you would never come back to me,\" moaned Nellie.\n\n\"Who said that?\" asked Mr. Montgomery aggressively.\n\n\"Everybody--the neighbors--Shrimplin--they all said it!\"\n\n\"Ain't I told you never to listen to gossip, and ain't I always done\nwhat's right?\" interrogated the handy-man severely.\n\n\"Yes, always, Joe,\" said Nellie.\n\n\"Then you might know'd I'd come back when I got plenty good and ready. I\nfooled 'em all, and I'm here to stay--that is if you keep your hands off\nme!\"\n\n\"You mean it, Joe?\" asked Nellie.\n\n\"What? About your keepin' your hands off me? Yes, you bet I do!\"\n\nAnd Montgomery by a not ungentle effort released himself from his wife's\nembrace. This act so restored his self-respect that he grinned\npleasantly at her.\n\n\"I don't know when I been so happy, Joe--it's awful nice to have you\nback!\" said Nellie, wiping her eyes on the corner of her apron.\n\n\"There's some sense in your sayin' that,\" said the handy-man, shaking\nhis head. \"You ought to feel happy.\"\n\n\"You don't ask after your children, Joe.--\"\n\n\"Don't I? Well, maybe you don't give me no time to!\" said Mr.\nMontgomery, but without any special enthusiasm, since the truth was that\nhis interest in his numerous offspring was most casual.\n\n\"They're all well, and the littlest, Tom--the one you never seen--has\ngot his first tooth!\" said Nellie.\n\nJoe grunted at this information.\n\n\"He'll have more by and by, won't he?\" he said.\n\n\"How you talk, of course he will!\"\n\n\"He'd have a devil of a time chewin' his food if he didn't,\" observed,\nthe handy-man with a throaty chuckle.\n\n\"And, Joe, I got the twenty dollars you sent!\"\n\n\"Is any of it left?\" inquired Mr. Montgomery, with sudden interest.\n\n\"The rent and things took it all. That was the noblest act you ever\ndone, Joe; it made me certain you was thinkin' of us, and from the\nmoment I got that money I was sure you would come back no matter what\npeople said!\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Joe. \"Is there anything in the house fit to eat? Because\nif there is, I'll feed my face right now!\"\n\n\"Do set down, Joe; I'll have something for you in a minute--why didn't\nyou tell me you was hungry?\"\n\nShe was already rattling plates and knives at the cupboard, and Joe took\nthe chair she had quitted when he entered the house, stretching his legs\nunder his own table with a sense of deep satisfaction. He had not\nconsidered it worth his while to visit the kitchen sink, although his\nmode of life, as well as his mode of travel for days past, had covered\nhim with dust and grime; nor did he take off his ragged cap. It had\nalways been his custom to wear it in the privacy of his own home, it was\none of the last things he removed before going to bed at night; at all\nother times it reposed on the top of his curly red head as the only safe\nplace for a cap to be.\n\n\"I was real worried about Arthur along in March,\" said Mrs. Montgomery,\nas such odds and ends as had survived the appetites of all the little\nMontgomerys began to assemble themselves on the table.\n\n\"What's he been a-doin'?\" inquired Arthur's father.\n\n\"It was his chest,\" explained Nellie.\n\nJoe grunted. By this time his two elbows were planted on the edge of the\ntable and his mouth was brought to within six scant inches of his plate.\nThe handy-man's table manners were not his strong point.\n\n\"Oh, I guess his chest is all right!\" he paused to say.\n\n\"I thought it was best to be on the safe side, so I took him up-town and\nhad his health examined by a doctor. He had to take off his shirt so he\ncould hear Arthur's lungs.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm damned,--what did he do that for?\" cried Joe, profoundly\nastonished.\n\n\"It was a mercy I'd washed him first,\" added Nellie, not comprehending\nthe reason of her husband's sudden show of interest though gratified by\nit.\n\n\"Lord, I thought you meant the doctor had took off his shirt!\" said Joe.\n\"He's all right now, ain't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, but he did have such an alarmin' cough; it hung on and hung on, it\nseemed to me like it was on his chest, but the doctor said no, and I was\nthat relieved! I used some of the twenty dollars to pay him and to get\nmedicine from the drug store.\"\n\nJoe was cramming his mouth full of cold meat and bread, and for the\nmoment could not speak; when at length he could and did, it was to say:\n\n\"I hear Andy Gilmore's left town?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of a sudden, and no one knows where he's gone!\"\n\n\"I guess he's had enough of Mount Hope, and I guess Mount Hope's had\nenough of him!\" remarked Joe.\n\n\"They say the police was goin' to stop the gamblin' in his rooms if he\nhadn't gone when he did.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope he'll catch hell wherever he is!\" said Joe, with a sullen\ndrop to his voice.\n\n\"For a while after you left, Joe, they didn't give me no peace at\nall--the police and detectives, I mean--they was here every day! And\nShrimplin told me they was puttin' advertisements in the papers all over\nthe country.\"\n\n\"What for?\" inquired Montgomery uneasily.\n\n\"They wanted to find out where you'd gone; it seemed like they was\ndetermined to get you back as a witness for the trial,\" explained\nNellie.\n\nMontgomery's uneasiness increased. He began to wonder fearfully if he\nwas in any danger, vague forebodings assailed him. Suppose he was\npinched and sent up. His face blanched and his small blue eyes slid\naround in their sockets. Nellie was evidently unaware of the feeling of\nterror her words had inspired, for she continued:\n\n\"But it didn't make no difference in the end that you wasn't here, for\neverybody says it was you that hanged John North; you get all the credit\nfor that!\"\n\nMontgomery's hands fell at his side.\n\n\"Me hanged John North! _Me hanged John North!_\" he repeated. \"But he\nain't hanged--God A'mighty, he ain't hanged yet!\"\n\nHis voice shot up into a wail of horrified protest. Nellie regarded him\nwith a look of astonishment. She had been rather sorry for young John\nNorth, but she had also felt a certain wifely pride in Joe's connection\nwith the case.\n\n\"No, he ain't hanged yet but he will be in the morning!\" she said.\n\nThe handy-man sprang to his feet, knocking over the chair in which he\nhad been seated.\n\n\"What's that?\" he roared.\n\n\"Why, haven't you heard? He's to be hung in the morning.\"\n\nJoe glared at her with starting eyes.\n\n\"What will they do that for--hang him--hang John North!\" He tore off his\nragged cap and dashed it to the floor at his feet. \"To hell with Andy\nGilmore and to hell with Marsh Langham--that's why they drove me out of\ntown--to hell with 'em both!\" he shouted, and his great chest seemed\nbursting with pent-up fury.\n\n\"Why, whatever do you mean, Joe?\" cried Nellie.\n\n\"He never done it--you hear me--and they _know_ it! You sure you got the\nstraight of this--they are goin' to hang young John North?\" He seized\nher roughly by the shoulders.\n\n\"Yes--how you take on, Joe--\"\n\n\"Take on!\" he shouted. \"You'd take on too if you stood in my place.\nYou're sure you know what you're talkin' about?\"\n\n\"I seen the fence around the jail yard where they're goin' to hang him;\nI went over on purpose yesterday with one of the neighbors and took\nArthur; I thought it would be improvin', but he'd seen it before. There\nain't much he don't see--for all I can do he just runs the streets.\"\n\nJoe's resolution had been formed while she was speaking, and now he\nsnatched his ragged cap from the floor.\n\n\"You stay right here till I get back!\" he said gruffly.\n\nIt was not his habit to discuss affairs of any moment with Mrs.\nMontgomery, since in a general way he doubted the clearness of the\nfeminine judgment, and in the present instance he had no intention of\ntaking her into his confidence. The great problem by which he was\nconfronted he would settle in his own fashion.\n\n\"You ain't in any trouble, Joe?\" and Nellie's eyes widened with the\nbirth of sudden fear.\n\nThe handy-man was standing by the door, and she went to his side.\n\n\"Me? No, I guess not; but I got an everlastin' dose of it for the other\nfellow!\" and he reached for the knob.\n\n\"Was it what I said about the police wantin' you?\" his wife asked\ntimidly.\n\nShe knew that his dealings with the police had never been of an\nespecially fortunate nature. He shook off the hand she had placed on his\narm.\n\n\"You keep your mouth shut till I get back!\" he said, and pushing open\nthe door, passed out.\n\nThe night had cleared since he crossed the bridge, and from the great\nblue arch of heaven the new moon gave her radiance to a sleeping world.\nBut Montgomery was aware only of his purpose as he slouched along the\npath toward the railroad track. The horror of North's fate had fixed his\ndetermination, nothing of terror or fear that he had ever known was\ncomparable to the emotion he was experiencing now. He did not even\nspeculate on the consequences to himself of the act he had decided on.\nThey said that he had hanged John North--he got the credit for\nthat--well, John North wasn't hanged yet! He tossed his arms aloft. \"My\nGod, I didn't mean to do that!\" he muttered.\n\nHe had gained the railroad tracks and was running toward the bridge, the\nvery seconds seemed of infinite value to him, for suppose he should have\ndifficulty in finding Moxlow? And if he found the prosecuting attorney,\nwould he believe his story? A shudder passed through him. He was quite\nnear the bridge when suddenly he paused and a whispered curse slipped\nfrom between his parted lips. A man was standing at the entrance to the\nbridge and though it was impossible to distinguish more than the shadowy\noutline of his figure, Montgomery was certain that it was Marshall\nLangham. His first impulse was to turn back and go into town by the\nwagon road and the wooden bridge, but as he hesitated the figure came\ntoward him, and Langham spoke.\n\n\"Is that you, Joe?\" he asked.\n\n\"Damn him, he knows I won't stand for hangin' North!\" the handy-man told\nhimself under his breath. He added aloud as he shuffled forward, \"Yes,\nit's me, boss!\"\n\n\"Couldn't you make it right with Nellie?\" asked Langham.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that--the old woman's all right--but the baby's sick and\nI'm out huntin' a doctor.\"\n\nHe did not expect Langham to believe him, but on the spur of the moment\nhe could think of nothing better.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that!\" said Langham.\n\nAn evil wolfish light stole into his eyes and the lines of his weak\ndebauched face hardened.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, boss; couldn't you get across?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"No, the bridge is too much for me. Like a fool I stopped here to smoke\na cigar after you left me; I hoped it would clear off a bit so I could\nsee the ties, but it's worse now that I can. I had about made up my mind\nto come and get you to help me back into town.\"\n\n\"Come along, boss, I'm in a terrible hurry!\" said Joe eagerly.\n\nBut Langham was a pace or two in advance of him when they stepped out\non the bridge. Never once did he glance in the handy-man's direction.\nHad he done so, Montgomery must have been aware that his face showed\nbloodless in the moonlight, while his sunken eyes blazed with an\nunaccustomed fire.\n\n\"I can't walk these ties, Joe--give me your hand--\" he managed to say.\n\nJoe did as he desired, and as the lawyer's slim fingers closed about his\ngreat fist he was conscious that a cold moisture covered them. He could\nonly think of a dead man's hand.\n\n\"What's wrong with the baby, Joe?\" Langham asked.\n\n\"Seems like it's got a croup,\" said Joe promptly.\n\n\"That's too bad--\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a hell of a pity,\" agreed Montgomery.\n\nHe was furtively watching Langham out of the corners of his beady blue\neyes; his inner sense of things told him it was well to do this. They\ntook half a dozen steps and Langham released Joe's hand.\n\n\"I wonder if I can manage this alone!\" he said. But apparently the\nattempt was a failure, for he quickly rested his hand on his companion's\nmassive shoulder.\n\nThey had reached the second of the bridge's three spans. Below them in\nthe darkness the yellow flood poured in noisy volume. As Langham knew,\nhere the stream was at its deepest and its current the swiftest. He knew\nalso that his chance had come; but he dared not make use of it. The\nbreath whistled from his lips and the moisture came from every pore. He\nsought frantically to nerve himself for the supreme moment; but suppose\nhe slipped, or suppose Joe became aware of his purpose one second too\nsoon!\n\n\"Keep over a bit, boss!\" said the handy-man suddenly. \"You are crowding\nme off the bridge!\"\n\n\"Oh, all right; is that better?\"\n\nAnd Langham moved a step aside.\n\n\"A whole lot,\" responded Joe gruffly. But his little blue eyes, alert\nwith cunning, were never withdrawn from the lawyer for an instant.\n\nThey walked forward in silence for a moment or two, and were approaching\nthe end of the center span, when the lawyer glanced about him wildly; he\nrealized that he was letting slip his one great opportunity. Again Joe\nspoke:\n\n\"Keep over, boss!\" And then all in the same breath, \"What the hell are\nyou up to, anyway?\"\n\nIt must be now or it would be never; and Langham, turning swiftly,\nhurled himself on his companion, and his slim fingers with their\ndeath-like chill gripped Joe's hairy throat. In the suddenness of the\nattack he was forced toward the edge of the bridge. The rush of the\nnoisy waters sounded with fearful distinctness in his ears.\n\n\"Here, damn you, let go!\" panted Montgomery.\n\n[Illustration: \"Here, let go!\" panted Montgomery.]\n\nHe felt Langham's hot breath on his cheek, he read murder by the wolfish\nlight in his eyes. He wrenched himself free of the other's desperate\nclutch, but as he did so his foot caught against one of the rails and he\nslipped and fell to his knees. In the intervals of his own labored\nbreathing, he heard the flow of the river, a dull ceaseless roar, and\nsaw the flashing silver of the moon's rays as they touched the water's\nturgid surface. Langham no longer sought to force him from the bridge,\nbut bent every effort to thrust him down between the ties to a swift and\ncertain death.\n\n\"You want to kill me, too!\" panted Montgomery, as by a mighty effort\nthat brought the veins on neck and forehead to the point of bursting, he\nregained his footing on the ties.\n\nBut his antagonist was grimly silent, and Joe, roused to action by fear,\nand by a sullen rage at what he deemed the lawyer's perfidy, turned and\ngrappled with him. Once he smashed his great fist full into Langham's\nface, and though the blow sent the lawyer staggering across the bridge,\nhe recovered himself quickly and rushed back to renew the fight.\nMontgomery greeted him with an oath, and they grappled again.\n\nLangham had known in his calmer moments when he planned Joe's death,\nthat his only hope of success lay in the suddenness of his attack. Now\nas they swayed on the very edge of the bridge the handy-man put forth\nall his strength and lifted the lawyer clear of the ties, then with a\nmighty heave of his great shoulders he tossed him out into space.\n\nThere was a scarcely audible splash and Joe, looking fearfully down, saw\nthe muddy drops turn limpid in the soft white light. A moment later some\ndark object came to the surface and a white face seemed to look up into\nhis, but only for a second, and then the restless flood bore it swiftly\naway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\n\nCUSTER'S IDOL FALLS\n\n\nEarly that same night Mr. Shrimplin, taking Custer with him, had driven\nout into the country. Their destination was a spot far down the river\nwhere catfish were supposed to abound, for Izaak Walton's gentle art was\nthe little lamplighter's favorite recreation. After leaving Mount Hope\nthey jogged along the dusty country road for some two miles, then\nturning from it into a little-traveled lane they soon came out upon a\ngreat sweeping bend of the stream.\n\n\"I don't know about this, Custer,\" said Mr. Shrimplin, with a doubtful\nshake of the head, as he drew rein. \"She's way up. I had no idea she was\nway up like this; I guess though we can't do no better than to chance\nit, catfish is a muddy-water fish, anyhow.\"\n\nHe tied wild Bill to a blasted sycamore, and then, while he cut poles\nfrom the willow bushes that grew along the bank, Custer built a huge\nbonfire, by the light of which they presently angled with varying\nfortunes.\n\n\"I reckon not many people but me knows about this fishing-hole!\" said\nShrimplin, as he cast his baited hook into the water.\n\n\"Where did you learn to fish?\" asked Custer, thirsting for that wisdom\nhis father was so ready to impart.\n\n\"I guess you'd call it a natural gift in my case, son,\" said the little\nlamplighter modestly. \"I don't know as I deserve no credit; it's like\nplaying the organ or walking on a tight rope, the instinct's got to be\nthere or you'll only lay yourself open to ridicule.\"\n\nBut truth to tell, fishing was no very subtle art as practised by Mr.\nShrimplin, he merely spat on his bait before he dropped it into the\nwater. Even Custer knew that every intelligent fisherman did this, you\ncouldn't reasonably hope to catch anything unless you did; yet there\nseemed to him, when he now thought of it, such a gap between cause and\neffect that he asked as he warily watched his cork:\n\n\"What good does it do to spit on your hook?\"\n\n\"I've forgot the science of it, Custer,\" admitted his father after a\nmoment's thought. \"But I've always heard old fishermen say you couldn't\ncatch nothing unless you did.\"\n\n\"Did you ever try to?\"\n\n\"I can't say as I ever did. What would be the use when you know better?\"\nsaid Mr. Shrimplin, who was strictly orthodox. His cork went under and\nhe landed a flopping shiner on the bank; this he took from his hook and\ntossed back into the water. \"It's a funny thing about shiners!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"What is?\" inquired Custer.\n\n\"Why, you always catch 'em when you ain't fishing for 'em. You fish for\ncatfish or sun-dabs, or bass even, if you're using worms, and you catch\nshiners; mainly, I suppose, because they are no manner of use to you. I\nreckon if you fished for shiners you wouldn't catch anything,--you\ncouldn't--because there is no more worthless fish that swims! That's why\nfishing is like life; in fact, you can't do nothing that ain't like\nlife; but I don't know but what catching shiners ain't just a little bit\nmore like life than anything else! You think you're going to make a lot\nof money out of some job you've got, but it shaves itself down to half\nby the time it reaches you; or you've got to cough up double what you\ncounted on when it's the other way about; so it works out the same\nalways; you get soaked whether you buy or sell, from the cradle to the\ngrave you're always catching shiners!\" While Mr. Shrimplin was still\nphilosophizing big drops of warm spring rain began to splash and patter\non the long reach of still water before them. He scrambled to his feet.\n\"We are going to have some weather, Custer!\" he said, and they had\nscarcely time in which to drive Bill under the shelter of a disused hay\nbarracks in an adjacent field, when the storm broke with all its fury.\nHere they spent the better part of an hour, and when at last the rain\nceased they climbed into the cart and turned Bill's head in the\ndirection of home.\n\n\"I hope, Custer, that your ma won't be scared; it's getting mighty\nlate,\" said the senior Shrimplin, and he shook his head as if in pity of\na human weakness which his mind grasped, though he could not share in\nit. \"Seems to be that people give way more and more to their fear than\nthey used to; or maybe it is that I ask too much, being naturally nervy\nmyself and not having no nerves, as I may say.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, off in the distance, the lights of Mount Hope became\nvisible to Custer and his father.\n\n\"I'd give a good deal for a glass of suds and a cracker right now!\" said\nMr. Shrimplin, speaking after a long silence. He tilted his head and\ntook a comprehensive survey of the heavens. \"Well, we're going to have a\nfine day for the hanging,\" he observed, with the manner of a\nconnoisseur.\n\n\"Why won't they let no one see it?\" demanded Custer.\n\n\"It's to be strictly private. I don't know but what that's best; it's\nsome different though from the hangings I'm used to.\" And Mr. Shrimplin\nshook his head dubiously as if he wished Custer to understand that after\nall perhaps he was not so sure it was for the best.\n\n\"How were they different?\" inquired Custer, sensible that his parent was\nfalling into a reminiscent mood.\n\n\"Well, they were more gay for one thing; folks drove in from miles about\nand brought their lunches and et fried chicken. Sometimes there was\nhoss racing in the morning, and maybe a shooting scrape or two; fact is,\nwe usually knowed who was to be the next to stretch hemp before the day\nwas over,--it gave you something to look forward to! But pshaw! What can\nyou expect here? Mount Hope ain't educated up to the sort of thing I'm\nused to! A feller gets his face punched down at Mike Lonigan's or out at\nthe Dutchman's by the tracks, and the whole town talks of it, but no one\never draws a gun; the feller that gets his face punched spits out his\nteeth and goes on about his business, and that's the end of it except\nfor the talk; but where I've been there'd be murder in about the time it\ntakes to shift a quid!\"\n\nAnd Mr. Shrimplin shifted his own quid to illustrate the uncertainty of\nhuman life in those highly favored regions.\n\n\"Don't you suppose they'd let you into the jail yard to-morrow if you\nasked?\" said Custer, to whom the hanging on the morrow was a matter of\nvital and very present interest.\n\n\"Well, son, I ain't _asked!_\" rejoined the little lamplighter in a\nrather startled tone.\n\n\"Well, don't you think they'd ought to, seeing that you was one of the\nwitnesses, and found old Mr. McBride before anybody else did?\" persisted\nthe boy.\n\n\"I won't say but what you might think they'd want me present; but\nConklin ain't even suggested it, and if he don't think of it I can't say\nas I'll have any hard feelings,\" concluded Mr. Shrimplin magnanimously.\n\nThey were about to enter Mount Hope now; to their right they could\ndistinguish the brick slaughter-house which stood on the river bank, and\nwhich served conveniently to mark the town's corporate limits on the\neast. The little lamplighter spoke persuasively to Bill, and the\nlateness of the hour together with the nearness to his own stable,\nconspired to make that sagacious beast shuffle forward over the stony\nroad at a very respectable rate of speed. They were fairly abreast of\nthe slaughter-house when Custer suddenly placed his hand on his father's\narm.\n\n\"Hark!\" said the boy.\n\nMr. Shrimplin drew rein.\n\n\"Well, what is it, Custer?\" he asked, with all that bland indulgence of\nmanner which was habitual to him in his intercourse with his son.\n\n\"Didn't you hear, it sounded like a cry!\" said Custer, in an excited\nwhisper.\n\nAnd instantly a shiver traversed the region of Mr. Shrimplin's spine.\n\n\"I guess you was mistaken, son!\" he answered rather nervously.\n\n\"No, don't you hear it--from down by the crick bank?\" cried the boy in\nthe same excited whisper. His father was conscious of the wish that he\nwould select a more normal tone.\n\n\"There!\" cried Custer.\n\nAs he spoke, a cry, faint and wavering, reached Mr. Shrimplin's ears.\n\n\"I do seem to hear something--\" he admitted.\n\n\"What do you suppose it is?\" asked the boy, peering off into the gloom.\n\n\"I don't know, Custer, and not wishing to be short with you, I don't\ncare a damn!\" rejoined Mr. Shrimplin, endeavoring to meet the situation\nwith an air of pleasant raillery.\n\nHe gathered up his lines as he spoke.\n\n\"Why, what are you thinking of?\" demanded Custer.\n\n\"I was thinking of your ma, Custer!\" faltered Mr. Shrimplin weakly. \"We\nbeen gone longer than we said, it must be after eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried Custer again, as a feeble call for help floated up to\nthem. \"It's from down on the crick bank back of the slaughter-house!\"\n\nMr. Shrimplin was knowing a terrible moment of doubt, especially\nterrible because the doubt was of himself. He was aware that Custer\nwould expect much of him in the present crisis, and he was equally\ncertain that he would not rise to the occasion. If somebody would only\ncome that way! And he listened desperately for the sound of wheels on\nthe road, but all he heard was that oft-repeated call for help that came\nwailing from the black shadows beyond the slaughter-house. Suddenly\nCuster answered the call with a reassuring cry.\n\n\"Perhaps it's another murder!\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" gasped Shrimplin, and there flashed through his mind the\nhorror of that other night.\n\nCuster slipped out of the cart.\n\n\"Come on!\" he cried.\n\nHe was vaguely conscious that his father was not seizing the present\nopportunity to distinguish himself with any noticeable avidity. He had\nexpected to see that conqueror of bad men and cow-towns, the somewhat\nruthless but always manful slayer of one-eye Murphy, descend from his\ncart with astonishing alacrity, and heedless in his tried courage stride\ndown into the darkness beyond the slaughter-house. But Mr. Shrimplin did\nnothing of the sort, he made no move to quit his seat. Surely something\nhad gone very wrong with the William Shrimplin of Custer's fancy, the\nyoung Bill Shrimplin of Texarcana and similar centers of crime and\nhardihood.\n\n\"Custer--\" began Mr. Shrimplin, in a shaking voice. \"I am wondering if\nit wouldn't be best to drive on into town and get a cop--Oh, my God, why\ndon't you quit hollering!\"\n\n\"Maybe they're killing him now!\" cried Custer breathlessly.\n\nHe could not yet comprehend his father's attitude in the matter, he\ncould only realize that for some wholly inexplicable reason he was\nfalling far short of his ideal of him; he seemed utterly to have lost\nhis eye for the spectacular possibilities of the moment. Why share the\ncredit with a cop, why ask help of any one!\n\n\"You don't need no help, pa!\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I don't know as I do,\" replied the little man, but he made no\nmove to leave his cart, his fears glued him to the seat.\n\n\"Come on, then!\" insisted Custer impatiently.\n\n\"Don't you feel afraid, son?\" inquired Mr. Shrimplin, with marked\nsolicitude.\n\n\"Not with you!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know as you need to!\" admitted Shrimplin. \"But I don't\nfeel quite right--I reckon I feel sort of sick, Custer--sort of--\"\n\n\"Oh, come on--hurry up!\"\n\n\"I don't know but I ought to see a doctor first--\" faltered Mr.\nShrimplin in a hollow tone.\n\nMisery of soul twisted his weak face pathetically.\n\n\"Why you act like you was _afraid!_\" said Custer, with withering\ncontempt.\n\nHis words cut the elder Shrimplin like a knife; but they did not move\nhim from his seat in the cart.\n\n\"You bet I ain't afraid, Custer,--and that's no way for you to speak to\nyour pa, anyhow!\"\n\nBut what he had intended should be the note of authority was no more\nthan a whine of injury.\n\n\"Then why don't you come if you ain't afraid?\" insisted the boy angrily.\n\n\"I don't know as I rightly know _why_ I don't!\" faltered Mr. Shrimplin.\n\"I feel rotten bad all at once.\"\n\n\"You're a coward!\" cried the boy in fierce scorn.\n\nSobs choked his further utterance while the hot tears blinded him on the\ninstant. His idol had turned to clay in his very presence, and in the\ndesolation of that moment he wished that he might be stricken with\ndeath, since life held nothing for him longer.\n\n\"Custer--\" began Shrimplin.\n\n\"Why don't you be a man and go down there?\" sobbed the boy.\n\n\"It's dangerous!\" said Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"Then I'll go!\" declared Custer resolutely.\n\n\"What--and leave me here alone?\" cried the little lamplighter.\n\nFor answer Custer ran to the fence; his tears still blinded him and sobs\nwrenched his little body. Twice he slipped back as he essayed to climb,\nbut a third attempt took him to the topmost rail of the rickety\nstructure.\n\n\"Custer!\" called his father.\n\nBut Custer persisted in the crime of disobedience. He slid down from the\ntop rail and stood among the young pokeberry bushes and ragweed that\nluxuriated in the foulness of the slaughter-house yard. It was not an\nespecially inviting spot even in broad day, as he knew. Now the\nmoonlight showed him bleached animal bones and grinning animal skulls,\nwhile the damp weeds that clung about his bare legs suggested snakes.\n\n\"_Custer!_\" cried Mr. Shrimplin again.\n\nBut it gained him no response from the boy, who disappeared from before\nhis eyes without a single backward glance; whereat the little\nlamplighter cursed querulously in the fear-haunted solitude of the road.\n\nCuster descended the steep bank that sloped down to the water's edge.\nHis eyes were fixed on a dense growth of willows and sycamores that\nlined the shore; it was from a spot within their black shadows that the\ncries for help seemed to come. Presently he paused.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he called, peering into the darkness ahead of him.\n\nHe listened intently, but this time his cry was unanswered; all he heard\nwas the grunting of some pigs that fed among the offal. The boy shivered\nand his heart seemed to stop beating.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he called once more.\n\n\"Help!\" came the answer.\n\nAnd Custer stumbled forward. As he neared the black shadows of the\nwillows he could feel his heart sink like lead through all the reaches\nof his shaking anatomy. He had passed quite beyond the hearing of his\nfather's commands and reproaches, and the wash and rush of the river\ncame up to him out of the silence.\n\n\"Hullo!\" cried the boy, pausing irresolutely.\n\nThen seemingly from the earth at his very feet came a faint answer to\nhis call, and Custer, forcing his way through a rank growth of weeds and\nbriers, stood on the brink of a deep gully that a small brook had worn\nfor itself on its way to the river below. In the bed of this brook was a\ndark object that Custer could barely distinguish to be the figure of a\nman. A bruised and bleeding face was upturned.\n\n\"Give me your hand--\" gasped the man.\n\nCuster knelt on the bank and grasping a tuft of grass to steady himself\nextended his free hand.\n\n\"Are you hurt bad?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know--\" gasped the man, as he endeavored to draw himself up out\nof the bed of the brook.\n\nBut after a moment of fruitless exertion he sank back groaning.\n\n\"Go for help!\" he said, in a painful whisper. \"You are not strong enough\nfor this.\"\n\n\"How did you get here?\" asked Custer.\n\n\"I fell off the railroad bridge, the current landed me here; where am I,\nanyhow?\"\n\n\"At the brick slaughter-house,\" said Custer.\n\n\"I thought so; can't you get some one to help you?\"\n\nBut Custer, his reasonable curiosity satisfied, was already on his way\nback to the road. \"If only pa has not driven off!\" But the senior\nShrimplin had not moved from the spot where Custer had left him five\nminutes before.\n\n\"Is that you, son?\" he asked, as Custer appeared at the fence.\n\n\"Come here, quick!\" commanded the boy.\n\n\"For what?\" inquired Mr. Shrimplin.\n\n\"You needn't be afraid, it's only a man who's fallen off the iron\nbridge. He's down in the bed of the slaughter-house run. I can't get him\nout alone!\"\n\n\"I'll bet he's good and drunk!\" said the little lamplighter.\n\n\"No, he ain't, and he's mighty badly hurt!\" said the boy hotly.\n\n\"Of course, of course, Custer!\" said Mr. Shrimplin. \"He'd a been killed\nthough if he hadn't been drunk.\"\n\nHe climbed out of his cart, and clambered over the fence. Something in\nCuster's manner warned him that any allusions of a jocular nature would\nprove highly distasteful to his son, and he followed silently as Custer\nled the way down to the brook.\n\n\"Here's where he is!\" said the boy halting. \"You get down beside\nhim--you're strongest, and I'll stay here and help pull him up while you\nlift!\"\n\n\"That's the idea, son!\" agreed Mr. Shrimplin genially.\n\nAnd he slid down into the bed of the brook where he struggled to get the\ninjured man to his feet. The first and immediate result of his effort\nwas that the latter swore fiercely at him, though in a whisper.\n\n\"We got to get you out of this, mister!\" said the little lamplighter\napologetically.\n\nA second attempt was made in which they were aided by Custer from above,\nand this time the injured man was drawn to the top of the bank, where\nhe collapsed in a heap.\n\n\"He's fainted!\" said Custer. \"Strike a match and see who it is!\"\n\nMr. Shrimplin obeyed, bringing the light close to the bloody and\ndisfigured face.\n\n\"Why, it's Marsh Langham!\" he cried.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n\nFAITH IS RESTORED\n\n\n\"Custer--\" began Mr. Shrimplin, and paused to clear his throat. He was\nwalking beside wild Bill's head while Custer in the cart tried to\nsupport Langham, for the latter had not regained consciousness. \"Custer,\nI'm mighty well satisfied with you; I may say that while I always been\nproud of you, I am prouder this moment than I ever hoped to be! How many\nboys in Mount Hope, do you think, would have the nerve to do what you\njust done? I love nerve,\" concluded Mr. Shrimplin with generous\nenthusiasm.\n\nBut Custer was silent, a sense of bitter shame kept him mute.\n\n\"Custer,\" said his father, in a timidly propitiatory tone, \"I hope you\nain't feeling stuck-up about this!\"\n\n\"I wish it had never happened!\" The boy spoke in an angry whisper.\n\n\"You wish what had never happened, Custer?\"\n\n\"About you--I mean!\"\n\nShrimplin gave a hollow little laugh.\n\n\"Well, and what about me, son--if I may be allowed to ask?\"\n\n\"I wish you'd gone down to the crick bank like I wanted you to!\"\nrejoined the boy.\n\nAgain he felt the hot tears gather, and drew the back of his hand across\nhis eyes. The little lamplighter had been wishing this, too; indeed, it\nwould for ever remain one of the griefs of his life that he had not done\nso. He wondered miserably if the old faith would ever renew itself. His\nportion in life was the deadly commonplace, but Custer's belief had\ngiven him hours of high fellowship with heroes and warriors; it had also\nministered to the bloody-mindedness which lay somewhere back of that\nquaking fear constitutional with him, and which he could no more control\nthan he could control his hunger or thirst. His blinking eyelids loosed\na solitary drop of moisture that slid out to the tip of his hooked nose.\nBut though Mr. Shrimplin's physical equipment was of the slightest for\nthe r\u00c3\u00b4le in life he would have essayed, nature, which gives the hunted\nbird and beast feather and fur to blend with the russets and browns of\nthe forest and plain, had not dealt ungenerously with him, since he\ncould believe that a lie long persisted in gathered to itself the very\nsoul and substance of truth. Another hollow little laugh escaped him.\n\n\"Lord, Custer, I was foolin'--I am always foolin'! It was my chance to\nsee the stuff that's in you. Well, it's pretty good stuff!\" he added\nartfully.\n\nBut Custer was not ready for the reception of this new idea; his\nfather's display of cowardice had seemed only too real to him. Yet the\nlittle lamplighter's manner took on confidence as he prepared to\nestablish a few facts as a working basis for their subsequent\nreconciliation.\n\n\"I'd been a little better pleased, son, if you'd gone quicker when you\nheard them calls Mr. Langham was letting out; you did hang back, you'll\nremember--it looked like you was depending on me too much; but I got no\ndesire to rub this in. What you done was nervy, and what I might have\nlooked for with the bringing-up I've given you. I shan't mention that\nyou hung back.\" He shot a glance out of the corners of his bleached blue\neyes in Custer's direction. \"How many minutes do you suppose you was in\ngetting out of the cart and over the fence? Not more than five, I'd say,\nand all that time I was sitting there shaking with laughter--just\nshaking with inward laughter; I asked you not to leave me alone! Well, I\nalways was a joker but I consider that my best joke!\"\n\nCuster maintained a stony silence, yet he would have given anything\ncould he have accepted those pleasant fictions his father was seeking to\nestablish in the very habiliments of truth.\n\n\"I hoped you'd know how to take a joke, son!\" said the little\nlamplighter in a hurt tone.\n\n\"Were you joking, sure enough?\" asked Custer doubtingly.\n\n\"Is it likely I could have been in earnest?\" demanded Shrimplin,\nhitching up his chin with an air of disdain. \"What's my record right\nhere in Mount Hope? Was it Andy Gilmore or Colonel Harbison that found\nold man McBride when he was murdered in his store?\" And the little\nlamplighter's tone grew more and more indignant as he proceeded. \"Maybe\nyou think it was your disgustin' and dirty Uncle Joe? _I_ seem to\nremember it was Bill Shrimplin, or do I just dream I was there--but I\nain't been called a liar, not by no living man--\" and he twirled an end\nof his drooping flaxen mustache between thumb and forefinger. \"Facts is\nfacts,\" he finished.\n\n\"Everybody knows you found old Mr. McBride--\" said Custer rather\neagerly.\n\n\"I'm expecting to hear it hinted I didn't!\" replied Mr. Shrimplin\ndarkly. \"I'm expecting to hear it stated by some natural-born liar that\nI set in my cart and bellered for help!\"\n\n\"But you didn't, and nobody says you did,\" insisted the boy.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you don't have to take my word for it,\" said Shrimplin.\n\"I'm glad them facts is a matter of official record up to the\ncourt-house. I don't know, though, that I care so blame much about being\nheld up as a public character; if I hadn't a reputation out of the\ncommon, maybe I wouldn't be misjudged when I stand back to give some one\nelse a chance!\"\n\nHe laughed with large scorn of the world's littleness.\n\nThe epic of William Shrimplin was taking to itself its old high noble\nstrain, and Custer was aware of a sneaking sense of shame that he could\nhave doubted even for an instant; then swiftly the happy consciousness\nstole in on him that he had been weighed in the balance by this\nspecialist in human courage and had not been found wanting. And his\nheart waxed large in his thin little body.\n\nThey were jogging along Mount Hope's deserted streets when Marshall\nLangham roused from his stupor.\n\n\"Where are you taking me?\" he demanded of the boy.\n\n\"Home, Mr. Langham--we're almost there now,\" responded Custer.\n\n\"Take me to my father's,\" said Marshall with an effort, and his head\nfell over on Custer's small shoulder.\n\nHe did not speak again until Bill came to a stand before Judge Langham's\ngate.\n\n\"Are we there?\" he asked of the boy.\n\n\"Yes--\"\n\n\"Don't you think we'd better get help?\" said Shrimplin.\n\nAnd Marshall seeming to acquiesce in this, the little lamplighter\nentered the yard and going to the front door rang the bell. A minute\npassed, and growing impatient he rang again. There succeeded another\ninterval of waiting in which Shrimplin cocked his head on one side to\ncatch the sound of possible footsteps in the hall.\n\n\"He says try the knob,\" called Custer from the cart.\n\nDoing this, Shrimplin felt the door yield, it was not locked; at the\nsame instant he made this discovery, however, he heard a footfall in the\nstreet and so, hurried back to the gate. The new-comer halted when he\nwas abreast of wild Bill, and stared first at the cart and then at\nShrimplin.\n\n\"Is anything the matter?\" he asked.\n\nIt was Watt Harbison.\n\n\"Young Mr. Langham has fell off the high iron bridge,\" said the little\nlamplighter, with a dignity that more than covered his lapse from\ngrammar.\n\n\"Why--are you badly hurt, Marsh?\" cried Watt going close to the cart.\n\n\"I don't know, I'm in most infernal pain,\" said Langham slowly.\n\n\"Do you think we can lift him?\" asked Shrimplin. \"The judge don't seem\nto be at home.\"\n\n\"Your boy would better go to my uncle's; Judge Langham may be there,\"\nsaid Watt.\n\nAnd Custer promptly slid out of the cart and sped off up the street.\n\nLangham met the delay with grim patience. A strange indifference had\ntaken the place of fear, nothing seemed of much moment any more.\nPresently in his stupor he heard the sound of quick steps, then Colonel\nHarbison's voice, and a moment later he was aware that the three men had\nlifted him from the cart and were carrying him along the path toward\nthe house. They entered the hall.\n\n\"Take me up-stairs,\" he said, and without pause his bearers moved\nforward.\n\nThey saw now that his face was pinched and ghastly under the smear of\nblood that was oozing from an ugly cut on his cheek, and Watt and the\ncolonel exchanged significant glances. When they reached the head of the\nstairs Custer pushed open the first door; the room thus disclosed was in\ndarkness, and the colonel, with a whispered caution to his companions,\nreleased his hold on Langham, and striking a match, stepped into the\nroom where, having found the chandelier, he turned on the gas. As the\nlight flared up, Shrimplin and Watt advanced with their helpless burden.\nIt was the judge's chamber they had entered and it was not untenanted,\nfor there on the bed lay the judge himself.\n\nIt was Langham who first saw that recumbent figure. A hoarse\ninarticulate groan escaped him. He twisted clear of the hands that\nsupported him and by a superhuman effort staggered to his feet, he even\ntook an uncertain step in the direction of the bed, his starting eyes\nfixed on the spare figure. Then his strength deserted him and with a cry\nthat rose to a shriek, he pitched forward on his face.\n\nThe colonel strode past the fallen man to the bedside, where for an\ninstant he stood looking down on a placid face and into open eyes. As\nhis glance wandered he saw that the judge's nerveless fingers still\ngrasped the butt of a revolver.\n\nWhite-faced he turned away. \"Is he dead, Colonel?\" asked the little\nlamplighter in an awe-struck voice. \"Was he murdered?\" and visions of\nfuture notoriety flashed through his mind.\n\nThe colonel and Watt exchanged shocked glances.\n\n\"Here, Shrimplin, help me with Marsh!\" said Watt. \"We must get him out\nof here at once!\"\n\nThey lifted Langham in their arms and bore him into an adjoining room.\nAs they placed him upon the bed he recovered consciousness and clutched\nWatt by the sleeve.\n\n\"I've been seeing all sorts of things to-night--it began while I lay in\nthat ditch with the pigs rooting about me! Where is my father, can't you\nfind him?\" he demanded eagerly.\n\nWatt turned his head away.\n\n\"Then that was not a dream--you saw it, too?\" said Langham huskily. He\ndropped back on his pillow. \"Dead--Oh, my God!\" he whispered, and was a\nlong time silent.\n\nHarbison despatched Shrimplin and Custer in quest of a physician, and he\nand Watt busied themselves with removing Marshall's wet clothes. When\nthis was done they washed the blood-stains from his face. He did not\nspeak while they were thus occupied; his eyes, wide and staring, were\nfixed on vacancy. He was seeing only that still figure on the bed in the\nroom adjoining.\n\nThere was a brisk step on the stairs and they were joined by Doctor\nTaylor.\n\n\"I declare, Marsh, I am sorry for this. You must have had quite a\ntumble, how did you manage it?\" he said, as he approached the bed.\n\nLangham's eyes lost something of their intentness as they were turned\ntoward the physician, but he did not answer him. The doctor moved a step\naside with Colonel Harbison.\n\n\"Had he been drinking?\" he asked in a low tone.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the colonel.\n\n\"Shrimplin has gone for Mrs. Langham--I think they are here now. Don't\nlet her come up until I have made my examination. Will you see to this?\"\n\nAnd the colonel quitted the room and hurried down-stairs.\n\nAs he gained the floor below, Evelyn entered the house.\n\n\"How is Marsh, Colonel Harbison?\" she asked.\n\nHer face was colorless but her manner was unexcited; her lips even had a\nsmile for the colonel.\n\n\"Doctor Taylor is with him, and I trust he will be able to tell you that\nMarshall's injuries are not serious!\" said Harbison gently.\n\n\"Where is he? I must go to him--\"\n\n\"The doctor prefers that you wait until he finishes his examination,\"\nsaid the colonel. He drew her into the library. \"Evelyn, I must tell\nyou--you must know that something else--unspeakably dreadful--has\nhappened here to-night!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The single word was no more than a breath on her full lips.\n\nThe colonel hesitated.\n\n\"You need not fear to tell me--whatever it is, I--I am prepared for\nanything--\" said Evelyn, with a pause between each word.\n\n\"The judge is dead,\" said Harbison simply. \"My poor old friend is dead!\"\n\n\"Dead--Marshall's father dead!\" She looked at him curiously, with a\nquestioning light in her eyes. \"You have not told me all, Colonel\nHarbison!\"\n\n\"Not told you all--\" he repeated.\n\n\"How did he die?\"\n\n\"I think--I fear he shot himself, but of course it may have been the\npurest accident--\"\n\n\"It was not an accident--\" she cried with a sob. \"Oh, don't mind what I\nam saying!\" she added quickly, seeing the look of astonishment on the\ncolonel's face.\n\n\"Mrs. Langham may come up if she wishes!\" called Doctor Taylor, speaking\nfrom the head of the stairs.\n\nEvelyn moved down the hall and paused.\n\n\"Does Marsh know?\" she asked of the colonel.\n\n\"Yes, unfortunately we carried him into his father's room,\" explained\nHarbison.\n\nEvelyn went slowly up the stairs. The horror of the situation was beyond\nwords. As she entered the room where Marshall lay, Watt Harbison and the\ndoctor silently withdrew into the hall, closing the door after them;\nbut Langham gave no immediate sign that he was aware of his wife's\npresence.\n\n\"Marsh?\" she said softly.\n\nHis palpable weakness and his cut and bruised face gave her an\ninstinctive feeling of tenderness for him. At the sound of her voice\nLangham's heavy lids slid back and he gazed up at her.\n\n\"Have they told you?\" he asked in an eager whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, and there was a little space of time when neither\nspoke.\n\nShe drew a chair to his bedside and seated herself. In the next room she\ncould hear Doctor Taylor moving about and now and then an indistinct\nword when he spoke with Watt Harbison. She imagined the offices they\nwere performing for the dead man. Then a door was softly closed and she\nheard footsteps as they passed out into the hall.\n\nEvelyn kept her place at the bedside without even altering the position\nshe had first taken, while her glance never for an instant left the\nhaggard face on the pillow. Beyond the open windows the silver light had\nfaded from the sky. At intervals a chill wind rustled the long curtains.\nThis, and her husband's labored breathing were the only sounds in the\nleaden silence that followed the departure of the two men from the\nadjoining room. She was conscious of a dreary sense of detachment from\nall the world, the little circle of which she had been the center seemed\nto contract until it held only herself. Suddenly Langham turned\nuneasily on his pillow and glanced toward the window.\n\n\"What time is it?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"It must be nearly day,\" said Evelyn. \"How do you feel now, Marsh? Do\nyou suffer?\"\n\nHe shook his head. His eyes were turned toward the window.\n\n\"What day is this?\" he asked after a brief silence.\n\n\"What day?\" repeated Evelyn.\n\n\"Yes--the day of the week, I mean?\"\n\n\"It's Friday.\"\n\n\"They are going to hang John North this morning!\" he said, and he\nregarded her from under his half-closed lids. \"I wonder what he is\nthinking of now?\" he added.\n\n\"Would the governor do nothing?\" she asked in a whisper.\n\nShe was white to the lips.\n\n\"And the Herbert girl--I wonder what she is thinking of!\"\n\n\"Hush, Marsh--Oh, hush! I--I can not--I must not think of it!\" she\ncried, and pressed her hands to her eyes convulsively.\n\n\"What does it matter to you?\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Nothing in one way--everything in another!\"\n\n\"I wish to God I could believe you!\" he muttered.\n\n\"You may--on my soul, Marsh, you may! It was never what you\nthink--never--never!\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter now,\" he said, and turned his face toward the wall.\n\n\"Marsh--\" she began.\n\nHe moved impatiently, and she realized that it was useless to attempt to\nalter what he had come to believe in absolutely. Beyond the windows the\nfirst pale streaks of a spring dawn were visible, but the earth still\nclothed itself in silence. The moments were racing on to the final act\nof the pitiless tragedy which involved so many lives.\n\n\"Marsh--\" Evelyn began again.\n\n\"I've been a dog to endure your presence in my house!\" he said bitterly.\n\nEvelyn was about to answer him when Doctor Taylor came into the room.\n\n\"Is he awake?\" he questioned.\n\nLangham gazed up into the doctor's face.\n\n\"Will I get well?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I hope so, Marshall--I can see no reason why a few days of quiet won't\nsee you up and about quite as if nothing had happened.\"\n\n\"Come--I want to know the truth! Do you think I'm hurt internally, is\nthat it?\" He sought to raise himself on his elbow but slipped back\ngroaning.\n\n\"You have sustained a very severe shock, still--\" began the doctor.\n\n\"Will I recover?\" insisted Langham impatiently.\n\n\"Oh, _please_, Marshall!\" cried Evelyn.\n\n\"I want to know the truth! If you don't think you can stand it, go out\ninto the hail while I thresh this matter out with Taylor!\" But Evelyn\ndid not leave her place at his bedside.\n\n\"You must not excite yourself!\" said Taylor.\n\n\"Humph--if you won't tell me what I wish to know, I'll tell you my\nopinion; it is that I am not going to recover. I must see Moxlow. Who is\ndown-stairs?\"\n\n\"Colonel Harbison and his nephew.\"\n\n\"Ask Watt to find Moxlow and bring him here. He's probably at his\nboarding-house.\"\n\nHe spoke with painful effort, and the doctor glanced uncertainly at\nEvelyn, who by a slight inclination of the head indicated that she\nwished her husband's request complied with. Taylor quitted the room.\n\n\"Why do you wish to see Moxlow?\" Evelyn asked the moment they were\nalone.\n\n\"I want him here; I may wish to tell him something--and I may not, it\nall depends,\" he said slowly, as his heavy lids closed over his tired\neyes.\n\nIt was daylight without, and there was the occasional sound of wheels in\nthe street. Evelyn realized with a sudden sense of shock that unless\nMarshall's bloodless lips opened to tell his secret, but a few hours of\nlife remained to John North.\n\nA struggle was going on within her, it was a struggle that had never\nceased from the instant she first entered the room. One moment she found\nshe could pray that Marshall might speak; and the next terror shook her\nlest he would, and declare North's innocence and his own guilt. She\nslipped from his bedside and stealing to the window parted the long\ncurtains with trembling hands. She felt widely separated in spirit from\nher husband; he seemed strangely indifferent to her; only his bitter\nsense of injury and hurt remained, his love had become a dead thing,\nsince his very weakness carried him beyond the need of her. She belonged\nto his full life and there was nothing of tenderness and sympathy that\nsurvived. A slight noise caused her to turn from the window. Marshall\nwas endeavoring to draw himself higher on his pillow.\n\n\"Here--lift me up--\" he gasped, as she ran to his side.\n\nShe passed an arm about him and did as he desired.\n\n\"That's better--\" he panted.\n\n\"Shall I call the doctor?\"\n\nHe shook his head and, as she withdrew her arm, lay back weak and\nshaken.\n\n\"I tell you I am hurt internally!\" he said.\n\n\"Let me call the doctor!\" she entreated.\n\n\"What can he do?\"\n\n\"Marsh, if you believe this--\" she began.\n\n\"You're thinking of him!\" he snarled.\n\n\"I am thinking of you, Marsh!\"\n\n\"He threw you over for the Herbert girl!\" he said with an evil ghastly\nsmile. \"Do you want to save him for her?\"\n\n\"You don't need to tell all, Marsh--\" she said eagerly.\n\n\"That's you!\" and he laughed under his breath. \"I can't imagine you\nadvocating anything absolutely right! If I tell, I'll make a clean\nbreast of it; if I don't I'll lie with my last breath!\"\n\nHe was thinking of Joe Montgomery now, as he had thought of him many\ntimes since he drew himself up out of that merciless yellow flood into\nwhich the handy-man had flung him. Evelyn looked at him wonderingly. His\nvirtues, as well as his vices, were things beyond her comprehension.\n\nThe door opened, and Moxlow came into the room. At sight of him,\nLangham's dull eyes grew brilliant.\n\n\"I thought you would never get here!\" he said.\n\n\"This _is_ too bad, Marsh!\" said his law partner sympathizingly, as\nEvelyn yielded him her place and withdrew to the window again.\n\n\"Where's Taylor?\" asked Langham abruptly.\n\n\"He's had to go to the jail, he was leaving the house as I got here,\"\nreplied Moxlow.\n\nThere was the noise of voices in the hail, one of which was the\ncolonel's, evidently raised in protest, then a clumsy hand was heard\nfumbling with the knob and the door was thrown open, and Joe Montgomery\nslouched into the room.\n\n\"Boss, you got to see me now!\" he cried.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney sprang to his feet with an angry exclamation.\n\n\"Let him alone--\" said Langham weakly.\n\nMontgomery stole to the foot of the bed and stared down on Langham.\n\n\"You tell him, boss,\" nodding his head toward Moxlow. \"I put it up to\nyou!\" he said.\n\nLangham's glance dwelt for an instant on the handy-man, then it shifted\nback to Moxlow.\n\n\"Stop the execution!\" he said, and Moxlow thought his mind wandered.\n\"North didn't kill McBride,\" Langham went on. \"Do you understand me--he\nis not the guilty man!\"\n\nA gray pallor was overspreading his face. It was called there by another\npresence in that room; an invisible but most potent presence.\n\n\"Do you understand me?\" he repeated, for he saw that his words had made\nno impression on Moxlow.\n\n\"Go on, boss!\" cried Montgomery, in a fever of impatience.\n\n\"Do you understand what I am telling you? John North did not kill\nMcBride!\" Langham spoke with painful effort. \"Joe knows who did--so do\nI--so did my father--he knew an innocent man had been convicted!\"\n\nAt mention of the judge, Moxlow started. He bent above Langham.\n\n\"Marsh, if John North didn't kill McBride, who did?\"\n\nBut Langham made no reply. Weak, pallid, and racked by suffering, he lay\nback on his pillow. Joe leaned forward over the foot of the bed.\n\n\"Tell him, boss; it's no odds to you now--tell him quick for God's sake,\nor it will be too late!\" he urged in a fearful voice.\n\nThere was a tense silence while they waited for Langham to speak. Moxlow\nheard the ticking of the clock on the mantel.\n\n\"If you have anything to say, Marsh--\"\n\nLangham raised himself on his elbows and his lips moved convulsively,\nbut only a dry gasping sound issued from them; he seemed to have lost\nthe power of speech.\n\n\"If North didn't kill McBride, who did?\" repeated Moxlow.\n\nA mighty effort wrenched Langham, again his lips came together\nconvulsively, and then in a whisper he said:\n\n\"I did,\" and fell back on his pillow.\n\nThere was a moment of stillness, and then from behind the long curtains\nat the window came the sound of hysterical weeping.\n\nMoxlow, utterly dazed by his partner's confession, looked again at the\nclock on the mantel. Fifteen minutes had passed. It was a quarter after\neight. His brows contracted as if he were trying to recall some half\nforgotten engagement. Suddenly he turned, comprehendingly, to\nMontgomery.\n\n\"My God!--North!\" he exclaimed and rushed unceremoniously from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT IN JAIL\n\n\nWhether John North slept during his last night in jail the deputy\nsheriff did not know, for that kindly little man kept his arms folded\nacross his breast and his face to the wall. The night wore itself out,\nand at last pale indications of the dawn crept into the room. There was\nthe song of the birds and a little later the rumble of an occasional\nwagon over the paved streets. North stirred and opened his eyes.\n\n\"Is it light?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the deputy.\n\nThe day began with the familiar things that make up the round of life,\nbut North was conscious that he was thus occupying himself for the last\ntime. Then he seated himself and began a letter he had told Brockett he\nwished to write. Once he paused.\n\n\"I will have time for this?\" he asked.\n\n\"All the time you want, John,\" said Brockett hastily, as he slipped from\nthe room.\n\nThe sun's level rays lifted and slanted into the cell, while North,\nremote from everything but the memory of Elizabeth's faith and courage,\nlabored to express himself. There was the sound of voices in the yard,\nbut their significance meant nothing to him now. He wrote on without\nlifting his head. At last the letter was finished and inclosed with a\nbrief note to the general.\n\nThe pen dropped from North's fingers and he stood erect, he was aware\nthat men were still speaking below his window, then he heard footfalls\nin the corridor, and turned toward the door. It was the sheriff and his\ndeputy. Conklin seemed on the verge of collapse, and Brockett's face was\ndrawn and ghastly.\n\nThere was a grim pause, and then Conklin, in a voice that was but a\nshadow of itself, read the death-warrant. When he had finished, North\ncast a last glance about his cell and passed out of the door between the\ntwo men. They walked the length of the corridor, descended the stairs,\nand entered the jail office. North turned to Conklin.\n\n\"I wish to thank you and Brockett for your kindness to me, and if you do\nnot mind I should like to shake hands with you both and say good-by\nhere,\" for through the office windows he had caught sight of the group\nof men in the yard.\n\nThe sheriff, silent, held out his hand. He dared not trust himself to\nspeak. North looked into his face.\n\n\"I am sorry for you,\" he said.\n\n\"My God, you may well be!\" gasped Conklin.\n\nNorth shook hands with Brockett and walked toward the door; but as he\nneared it, Brockett stepped in front of him and threw it open. As North\npassed out into the graveled yard, out into the full light of the warm\nspring day, the sheriff mechanically looked at his watch. It was twenty\nminutes after eight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\n\nAT IDLE HOUR\n\n\nFrom her window Elizabeth saw the gray dawn which ushered in that June\nday steal over the valley below Idle Hour. Swiftly out of the darkness\nof the long night grew the accustomed shape of things. Wooded pastures\nand plowed fields came mysteriously into existence as the light spread,\nthen the sun burst through the curtain of mist which lay along the\neastern horizon, and it was day--the day of _his_ death.\n\nTheir many failures trooped up out of the past and mocked at her;\nbecause of them he must die. They had gone with feverish haste from hope\nto hope to this dread end! Perhaps she had never really believed before\nthat the day and hour would overtake them; when effort would promise\nnothing. But now the very sense of tragedy filled that silent morning,\nand her soul was in fearful companionship with it. A flood of wild\nimaginings swept her forward, across the little space of time that was\nleft to her lover. Gasping for breath, she struggled with the grim\nhorror that was growing up about him. His awful solitude came to her as\na reproach; she should have remained with him to the end! Was there yet\ntime to go back, or would she be too late? When? When? And she asked\nherself the question she had not dared to ask of her father.\n\nThe day showed her the distant roofs of Mount Hope; the day showed her\nthe square brick tower of the court-house--living or dead, John North\nwas in its very shadow. She crouched by the window, her arms resting on\nthe ledge and her eyes fixed on the distant tower. How had the night\npassed for him--had he slept? And the pity of those lonely hours brought\nthe tears to her burning eyes. She heard her father come slowly down the\nhall; he paused before her door.\n\n\"Elizabeth--dear!\" his voice was very gentle.\n\n\"Yes, father?\"\n\nBut she did not change her position at the window.\n\n\"Won't you come down-stairs, dear?\" he said.\n\n\"I can not--\" and then she felt the selfishness of her refusal, and\nadded: \"I will be down in a moment, I--I have not quite finished\ndressing--yet!\"\n\nJohn North had thought always of others. In the moment of his supremest\nagony, he had spoken not at all of himself; by word or look he had added\nnothing to the sorrow that was crushing her. This had been genuine\ncourage.\n\n\"I must remember it always!\" she told herself, as she turned away from\nthe window. \"I must not be selfish--he would not understand it--\"\n\nHer father was waiting for her at the foot of the stairs, and the glance\nhe bent on her was keen with anxiety. Perfect understanding existed\nbetween them no less now than formerly, but the anguish which had left\nits impress on that white face removed her beyond any attempted\nexpression of sympathy from him.\n\nAt the end of the hail the open door gave a wide vista of well-kept\nlawns. Elizabeth turned swiftly to this doorway. Her father kept his\nplace at her side, and together they passed from the house out into the\nwarm day. Suddenly the girl paused, and her eager gaze was directed\ntoward Mount Hope--toward _him_.\n\n\"Would it be too late to go to him now?\" she asked in a feverish\nwhisper.\n\nA spasm of pain contracted the old general's haggard face, but the\nquestion found him mute.\n\n\"Would it be too late?\" she repeated.\n\n\"He would not desire it, Elizabeth,\" replied her father.\n\n\"But would it be too late?\" and she rested a shaking hand on his arm.\n\n\"You must not ask me that--I don't know.\"\n\nHe tried to meet her glance, which seemed to read his very soul, then\nher hand dropped at her side and she took a step forward, her head bowed\nand her face averted.\n\nAgain came the thought of North's awful isolation; the thought of that\nlonely death where love and tenderness had no place; all the ghastly\nterror of that last moment when he was hurried from this living\nbreathing world! It was a monstrous thing! A thing beyond\nbelief--incredible, unspeakable!\n\n\"We can believe in his courage,\" said her father, \"as certainly as we\ncan believe in his innocence.\"\n\n\"Yes--\" she gasped.\n\n\"That is something. And the day will surely come when the world will\nthink as we think. The truth seems lost now, but not for always!\"\n\n\"But when he is gone--when he is no longer here--\"\n\nThe general was silent. North had compelled his respect and faith; for\nafter all, no guilty man could have faced death with so fine a courage.\nThere was more to him than he had ever been willing to admit in his\njudgment of the man. Whatever his faults, they had been the faults of\nyouth; had the opportunity been given him he would have redeemed\nhimself, would have purged himself of folly. \"Some day,\" the general was\nthinking, \"I will tell her just what my feelings for North have been,\nhow out of disapproval and doubt has come a deep and sincere regard.\"\n\nThe sun swept higher in the heavens, and the gray old man with the\nstrong haggard face, and the girl in whom the girl had died and the\nwoman had been born, walked on; now with dragging steps, when the stupor\nof despair seized her, now swiftly as her thoughts rushed from horror to\nhorror.\n\nThe world, basking in the warmth of that June sun, seemed very peaceful\nas they looked out across the long reaches of the flat valley, and on to\nthe distant town, with the lazy smoke of its factory chimneys floated\nabove the spires and housetops. But the peace that was breathed out of\nthe great calm heart of nature was not for these two! The girl's sense\nwas only one of fierce rebellion at the injustice which was taking--had\ntaken, perhaps, the life of the man she loved; an injustice that could\nnever make amends--so implacable in its exactions, so impotent in its\natonements!\n\nThey were nearing the limits of the grounds; back of them, among its\ntrees, loomed the gray stone front of Idle Hour. Her father rested a\nhand upon Elizabeth's shoulder.\n\n\"I will try to be brave, too--as he was always--\" she said pausing.\n\nShe stood there, a tragic figure, and then turned to her father with\npathetic courage. She would take up what was left for her. She had her\nmemories. They were of happiness no less than sorrow, for she had loved\nmuch and suffered much.\n\nWith a final lingering glance townward, she turned away. Then a startled\ncry escaped her, and her father looked up.\n\nJohn North was coming toward them across the lawn.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE JUST AND THE UNJUST***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 14581-8.txt or 14581-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/4\/5\/8\/14581\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":898,"split":"train"}
