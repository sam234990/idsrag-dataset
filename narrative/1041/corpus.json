The young man is destined for great things. He discovers on the eve of his wedding that his fianc\u0102\u0160e Countess Mary Korotkova has had an affair with his beloved Tsar Nicholas I. The blow to his pride is massive, and he retreats to the arms of Russian Orthodoxy and becomes a monk. Many years of humility and doubt follow. He is ordered to become a hermit. Despite his being removed from the world, he is still remembered for having so remarkably transformed his life. One winter night, a group of merry-makers decide to visit him, and one of them, a divorced woman named Makovkina, spends the night in his cell, with the intention to seduce him. Father Sergius discovers he is still weak and in order to protect himself, cuts off his own finger. Makovkina is stunned by this act, and leaves the next morning, having vowed to change her life. A year later she has joined a convent. Father Sergius' reputation for holiness grows. He becomes known as a healer, and pilgrims come from far and wide. Yet Father Sergius is profoundly aware of his inability to attain a true faith. He is still tortured by boredom, pride, and lust. He fails a new test, when the young daughter of a merchant successfully beds him. The morning after, he leaves the monastery and seeks out his cousin Pashenka (Praskovya Mikhaylovna), whom he, with a group of other boys, had tormented many years ago. He finds her, now in all the conventional senses a failure in life, yet imbued with a sense of service towards her family. His path is now clearer. He begins to wander, until eight months later he is arrested in the company of a blind beggar who makes him feel closer to God. He is sent to Siberia, where he now works as the hired man of a well-to-do peasant, teaching the gentleman's young children and working in the gardens.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Father Sergius, by Leo Tolstoy\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

An\nofficer of the Cuirassier Life Guards, a handsome prince who everyone\npredicted would become aide-de-camp to the Emperor Nicholas I and have\na brilliant career, left the service, broke off his engagement to a\nbeautiful maid of honour, a favourite of the Empress's, gave his small\nestate to his sister, and retired to a monastery to become a monk.\n\nThis event appeared extraordinary and inexplicable to those who did not\nknow his inner motives, but for Prince Stepan Kasatsky himself it all\noccurred so naturally that he could not imagine how he could have acted\notherwise.\n\nHis father, a retired colonel of the Guards, had died when Stepan was\ntwelve, and sorry as his mother was to part from her son, she entered\nhim at the Military College as her deceased husband had intended.\n\nThe widow herself, with her daughter, Varvara, moved to Petersburg to be\nnear her son and have him with her for the holidays.\n\nThe boy was distinguished both by his brilliant ability and by his\nimmense self-esteem. He was first both in his studies--especially in\nmathematics, of which he was particularly fond--and also in drill and in\nriding. Though of more than average height, he was handsome and agile,\nand he would have been an altogether exemplary cadet had it not been for\nhis quick temper. He was remarkably truthful, and was neither dissipated\nnor addicted to drink. The only faults that marred his conduct were\nfits of fury to which he was subject and during which he lost control of\nhimself and became like a wild animal. He once nearly threw out of the\nwindow another cadet who had begun to tease him about his collection\nof minerals. On another occasion he came almost completely to grief\nby flinging a whole dish of cutlets at an officer who was acting as\nsteward, attacking him and, it was said, striking him for having broken\nhis word and told a barefaced lie. He would certainly have been reduced\nto the ranks had not the Director of the College hushed up the whole\nmatter and dismissed the steward.\n\nBy the time he was eighteen he had finished his College course and\nreceived a commission as lieutenant in an aristocratic regiment of the\nGuards.\n\nThe Emperor Nicholas Pavlovich (Nicholas I) had noticed him while he\nwas still at the College, and continued to take notice of him in the\nregiment, and it was on this account that people predicted for him an\nappointment as aide-de-camp to the Emperor. Kasatsky himself strongly\ndesired it, not from ambition only but chiefly because since his cadet\ndays he had been passionately devoted to Nicholas Pavlovich. The Emperor\nhad often visited the Military College and every time Kasatsky saw\nthat tall erect figure, with breast expanded in its military overcoat,\nentering with brisk step, saw the cropped side-whiskers, the moustache,\nthe aquiline nose, and heard the sonorous voice exchanging greetings\nwith the cadets, he was seized by the same rapture that he experienced\nlater on when he met the woman he loved. Indeed, his passionate\nadoration of the Emperor was even stronger: he wished to sacrifice\nsomething--everything, even himself--to prove his complete devotion.\nAnd the Emperor Nicholas was conscious of evoking this rapture and\ndeliberately aroused it. He played with the cadets, surrounded himself\nwith them, treating them sometimes with childish simplicity, sometimes\nas a friend, and then again with majestic solemnity. After that affair\nwith the officer, Nicholas Pavlovich said nothing to Kasatsky, but when\nthe latter approached he waved him away theatrically, frowned, shook his\nfinger at him, and afterwards when leaving, said: 'Remember that I know\neverything. There are some things I would rather not know, but they\nremain here,' and he pointed to his heart.\n\nWhen on leaving College the cadets were received by the Emperor, he did\nnot again refer to Kasatsky's offence, but told them all, as was his\ncustom, that they should serve him and the fatherland loyally, that he\nwould always be their best friend, and that when necessary they might\napproach him direct. All the cadets were as usual greatly moved, and\nKasatsky even shed tears, remembering the past, and vowed that he would\nserve his beloved Tsar with all his soul.\n\nWhen Kasatsky took up his commission his mother moved with her daughter\nfirst to Moscow and then to their country estate. Kasatsky gave half his\nproperty to his sister and kept only enough to maintain himself in the\nexpensive regiment he had joined.\n\nTo all appearance he was just an ordinary, brilliant young officer\nof the Guards making a career for himself; but intense and complex\nstrivings went on within him. From early childhood his efforts had\nseemed to be very varied, but essentially they were all one and the\nsame. He tried in everything he took up to attain such success and\nperfection as would evoke praise and surprise. Whether it was his\nstudies or his military exercises, he took them up and worked at them\ntill he was praised and held up as an example to others. Mastering one\nsubject he took up another, and obtained first place in his studies. For\nexample, while still at College he noticed in himself an awkwardness in\nFrench conversation, and contrived to master French till he spoke it\nas well as Russian, and then he took up chess and became an excellent\nplayer.\n\nApart from his main vocation, which was the service of his Tsar and\nthe fatherland, he always set himself some particular aim, and however\nunimportant it was, devoted himself completely to it and lived for it\nuntil it was accomplished. And as soon as it was attained another\naim would immediately present itself, replacing its predecessor. This\npassion for distinguishing himself, or for accomplishing something\nin order to distinguish himself, filled his life. On taking up his\ncommission he set himself to acquire the utmost perfection in knowledge\nof the service, and very soon became a model officer, though still with\nthe same fault of ungovernable irascibility, which here in the service\nagain led him to commit actions inimical to his success. Then he took to\nreading, having once in conversation in society felt himself deficient\nin general education--and again achieved his purpose. Then, wishing\nto secure a brilliant position in high society, he learnt to dance\nexcellently and very soon was invited to all the balls in the best\ncircles, and to some of their evening gatherings. But this did not\nsatisfy him: he was accustomed to being first, and in this society was\nfar from being so.\n\nThe highest society then consisted, and I think always consist, of\nfour sorts of people: rich people who are received at Court, people\nnot wealthy but born and brought up in Court circles, rich people who\ningratiate themselves into the Court set, and people neither rich nor\nbelonging to the Court but who ingratiate themselves into the first and\nsecond sets.\n\nKasatsky did not belong to the first two sets, but was readily welcomed\nin the others. On entering society he determined to have relations with\nsome society lady, and to his own surprise quickly accomplished this\npurpose. He soon realized, however, that the circles in which he moved\nwere not the highest, and that though he was received in the highest\nspheres he did not belong to them. They were polite to him, but showed\nby their whole manner that they had their own set and that he was not of\nit. And Kasatsky wished to belong to that inner circle. To attain that\nend it would be necessary to be an aide-de-camp to the Emperor--which\nhe expected to become--or to marry into that exclusive set, which he\nresolved to do. And his choice fell on a beauty belonging to the\nCourt, who not merely belonged to the circle into which he wished to be\naccepted, but whose friendship was coveted by the very highest people\nand those most firmly established in that highest circle. This was\nCountess Korotkova. Kasatsky began to pay court to her, and not merely\nfor the sake of his career. She was extremely attractive and he soon\nfell in love with her. At first she was noticeably cool towards him,\nbut then suddenly changed and became gracious, and her mother gave him\npressing invitations to visit them. Kasatsky proposed and was accepted.\nHe was surprised at the facility with which he attained such happiness.\nBut though he noticed something strange and unusual in the behaviour\ntowards him of both mother and daughter, he was blinded by being\nso deeply in love, and did not realize what almost the whole town\nknew--namely, that his fiancee had been the Emperor Nicholas's mistress\nthe previous year.\n\nTwo weeks before the day arranged for the wedding, Kasatsky was at\nTsarskoe Selo at his fiancee's country place. It was a hot day in May.\nHe and his betrothed had walked about the garden and were sitting on\na bench in a shady linden alley. Mary's white muslin dress suited her\nparticularly well, and she seemed the personification of innocence and\nlove as she sat, now bending her head, now gazing up at the very tall\nand handsome man who was speaking to her with particular tenderness and\nself-restraint, as if he feared by word or gesture to offend or sully\nher angelic purity.\n\nKasatsky belonged to those men of the eighteen-forties (they are now no\nlonger to be found) who while deliberately and without any conscientious\nscruples condoning impurity in themselves, required ideal and angelic\npurity in their women, regarded all unmarried women of their circle as\npossessed of such purity, and treated them accordingly. There was much\nthat was false and harmful in this outlook, as concerning the laxity the\nmen permitted themselves, but in regard to the women that old-fashioned\nview (sharply differing from that held by young people to-day who see in\nevery girl merely a female seeking a mate) was, I think, of value. The\ngirls, perceiving such adoration, endeavoured with more or less success\nto be goddesses.\n\nSuch was the view Kasatsky held of women, and that was how he regarded\nhis fiancee. He was particularly in love that day, but did not\nexperience any sensual desire for her. On the contrary he regarded her\nwith tender adoration as something unattainable.\n\nHe rose to his full height, standing before her with both hands on his\nsabre.\n\n'I have only now realized what happiness a man can experience! And it is\nyou, my darling, who have given me this happiness,' he said with a timid\nsmile.\n\nEndearments had not yet become usual between them, and feeling himself\nmorally inferior he felt terrified at this stage to use them to such an\nangel.\n\n'It is thanks to you that I have come to know myself. I have learnt that\nI am better than I thought.'\n\n'I have known that for a long time. That was why I began to love you.'\n\nNightingales trilled near by and the fresh leafage rustled, moved by a\npassing breeze.\n\nHe took her hand and kissed it, and tears came into his eyes.\n\nShe understood that he was thanking her for having said she loved him.\nHe silently took a few steps up and down, and then approached her again\nand sat down.\n\n'You know... I have to tell you... I was not disinterested when I\nbegan to make love to you. I wanted to get into society; but later...\nhow unimportant that became in comparison with you--when I got to know\nyou. You are not angry with me for that?'\n\nShe did not reply but merely touched his hand. He understood that this\nmeant: 'No, I am not angry.'\n\n'You said...' He hesitated. It seemed too bold to say. 'You said that\nyou began to love me. I believe it--but there is something that troubles\nyou and checks your feeling. What is it?'\n\n'Yes--now or never!' thought she. 'He is bound to know of it anyway. But\nnow he will not forsake me. Ah, if he should, it would be terrible!' And\nshe threw a loving glance at his tall, noble, powerful figure. She loved\nhim now more than she had loved the Tsar, and apart from the Imperial\ndignity would not have preferred the Emperor to him.\n\n'Listen! I cannot deceive you. I have to tell you. You ask what it is?\nIt is that I have loved before.'\n\nShe again laid her hand on his with an imploring gesture. He was silent.\n\n'You want to know who it was? It was--the Emperor.'\n\n'We all love him. I can imagine you, a schoolgirl at the Institute...'\n\n'No, it was later. I was infatuated, but it passed... I must tell\nyou...'\n\n'Well, what of it?'\n\n'No, it was not simply--' She covered her face with her hands.\n\n'What? You gave yourself to him?'\n\nShe was silent.\n\n'His mistress?'\n\nShe did not answer.\n\nHe sprang up and stood before her with trembling jaws, pale as death. He\nnow remembered how the Emperor, meeting him on the Nevsky, had amiably\ncongratulated him.\n\n'O God, what have I done! Stiva!'\n\n'Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Oh, how it pains!'\n\nHe turned away and went to the house. There he met her mother.\n\n'What is the matter, Prince? I...' She became silent on seeing his\nface. The blood had suddenly rushed to his head.\n\n'You knew it, and used me to shield them! If you weren't a woman...!'\nhe cried, lifting his enormous fist, and turning aside he ran away.\n\nHad his fiancee's lover been a private person he would have killed him,\nbut it was his beloved Tsar.\n\nNext day he applied both for furlough and his discharge, and professing\nto be ill, so as to see no one, he went away to the country.\n\nHe spent the summer at his village arranging his affairs. When summer\nwas over he did not return to Petersburg, but entered a monastery and\nthere became a monk.\n\nHis mother wrote to try to dissuade him from this decisive step, but\nhe replied that he felt God's call which transcended all other\nconsiderations. Only his sister, who was as proud and ambitious as he,\nunderstood him.\n\nShe understood that he had become a monk in order to be above those who\nconsidered themselves his superiors. And she understood him correctly.\nBy becoming a monk he showed contempt for all that seemed most important\nto others and had seemed so to him while he was in the service, and\nhe now ascended a height from which he could look down on those he had\nformerly envied.... But it was not this alone, as his sister Varvara\nsupposed, that influenced him. There was also in him something else--a\nsincere religious feeling which Varvara did not know, which intertwined\nitself with the feeling of pride and the desire for pre-eminence,\nand guided him. His disillusionment with Mary, whom he had thought\nof angelic purity, and his sense of injury, were so strong that they\nbrought him to despair, and the despair led him--to what? To God, to his\nchildhood's faith which had never been destroyed in him.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nKasatsky entered the monastery on the feast of the Intercession of the\nBlessed Virgin. The Abbot of that monastery was a gentleman by birth, a\nlearned writer and a starets, that is, he belonged to that succession\nof monks originating in Walachia who each choose a director and teacher\nwhom they implicitly obey. This Superior had been a disciple of the\nstarets Ambrose, who was a disciple of Makarius, who was a disciple of\nthe starets Leonid, who was a disciple of Paussy Velichkovsky.\n\nTo this Abbot Kasatsky submitted himself as to his chosen director. Here\nin the monastery, besides the feeling of ascendency over others that\nsuch a life gave him, he felt much as he had done in the world: he found\nsatisfaction in attaining the greatest possible perfection outwardly\nas well as inwardly. As in the regiment he had been not merely an\nirreproachable officer but had even exceeded his duties and widened the\nborders of perfection, so also as a monk he tried to be perfect, and was\nalways industrious, abstemious, submissive, and meek, as well as\npure both in deed and in thought, and obedient. This last quality in\nparticular made life far easier for him. If many of the demands of life\nin the monastery, which was near the capital and much frequented, did\nnot please him and were temptations to him, they were all nullified by\nobedience: 'It is not for me to reason; my business is to do the task\nset me, whether it be standing beside the relics, singing in the choir,\nor making up accounts in the monastery guest-house.' All possibility of\ndoubt about anything was silenced by obedience to the starets. Had\nit not been for this, he would have been oppressed by the length and\nmonotony of the church services, the bustle of the many visitors, and\nthe bad qualities of the other monks. As it was, he not only bore it\nall joyfully but found in it solace and support. 'I don't know why it is\nnecessary to hear the same prayers several times a day, but I know that\nit is necessary; and knowing this I find joy in them.' His director told\nhim that as material food is necessary for the maintenance of the life\nof the body, so spiritual food--the church prayers--is necessary for\nthe maintenance of the spiritual life. He believed this, and though the\nchurch services, for which he had to get up early in the morning, were\na difficulty, they certainly calmed him and gave him joy. This was the\nresult of his consciousness of humility, and the certainty that whatever\nhe had to do, being fixed by the starets, was right.\n\nThe interest of his life consisted not only in an ever greater and\ngreater subjugation of his will, but in the attainment of all the\nChristian virtues, which at first seemed to him easily attainable. He\nhad given his whole estate to his sister and did not regret it, he had\nno personal claims, humility towards his inferiors was not merely easy\nfor him but afforded him pleasure. Even victory over the sins of the\nflesh, greed and lust, was easily attained. His director had specially\nwarned him against the latter sin, but Kasatsky felt free from it and\nwas glad.\n\nOne thing only tormented him--the remembrance of his fiancee; and not\nmerely the remembrance but the vivid image of what might have been.\nInvoluntarily he recalled a lady he knew who had been a favourite of the\nEmperor's, but had afterwards married and become an admirable wife and\nmother. The husband had a high position, influence and honour, and a\ngood and penitent wife.\n\nIn his better hours Kasatsky was not disturbed by such thoughts, and\nwhen he recalled them at such times he was merely glad to feel that the\ntemptation was past. But there were moments when all that made up his\npresent life suddenly grew dim before him, moments when, if he did not\ncease to believe in the aims he had set himself, he ceased to see them\nand could evoke no confidence in them but was seized by a remembrance\nof, and--terrible to say--a regret for, the change of life he had made.\n\nThe only thing that saved him in that state of mind was obedience and\nwork, and the fact that the whole day was occupied by prayer. He went\nthrough the usual forms of prayer, he bowed in prayer, he even prayed\nmore than usual, but it was lip-service only and his soul was not in it.\nThis condition would continue for a day, or sometimes for two days, and\nwould then pass of itself. But those days were dreadful. Kasatsky felt\nthat he was neither in his own hands nor in God's, but was subject\nto something else. All he could do then was to obey the starets, to\nrestrain himself, to undertake nothing, and simply to wait. In general\nall this time he lived not by his own will but by that of the starets,\nand in this obedience he found a special tranquillity.\n\nSo he lived in his first monastery for seven years. At the end of the\nthird year he received the tonsure and was ordained to the priesthood by\nthe name of Sergius. The profession was an important event in his inner\nlife. He had previously experienced a great consolation and spiritual\nexaltation when receiving communion, and now when he himself officiated,\nthe performance of the preparation filled him with ecstatic and deep\nemotion. But subsequently that feeling became more and more deadened,\nand once when he was officiating in a depressed state of mind he felt\nthat the influence produced on him by the service would not endure. And\nit did in fact weaken till only the habit remained.\n\nIn general in the seventh year of his life in the monastery Sergius grew\nweary. He had learnt all there was to learn and had attained all there\nwas to attain, there was nothing more to do and his spiritual drowsiness\nincreased. During this time he heard of his mother's death and his\nsister Varvara's marriage, but both events were matters of indifference\nto him. His whole attention and his whole interest were concentrated on\nhis inner life.\n\nIn the fourth year of his priesthood, during which the Bishop had been\nparticularly kind to him, the starets told him that he ought not to\ndecline it if he were offered an appointment to higher duties. Then\nmonastic ambition, the very thing he had found so repulsive in other\nmonks, arose within him. He was assigned to a monastery near the\nmetropolis. He wished to refuse but the starets ordered him to accept\nthe appointment. He did so, and took leave of the starets and moved to\nthe other monastery.\n\nThe exchange into the metropolitan monastery was an important event in\nSergius's life. There he encountered many temptations, and his whole\nwill-power was concentrated on meeting them.\n\nIn the first monastery, women had not been a temptation to him, but\nhere that temptation arose with terrible strength and even took definite\nshape. There was a lady known for her frivolous behaviour who began to\nseek his favour. She talked to him and asked him to visit her. Sergius\nsternly declined, but was horrified by the definiteness of his desire.\nHe was so alarmed that he wrote about it to the starets. And in\naddition, to keep himself in hand, he spoke to a young novice and,\nconquering his sense of shame, confessed his weakness to him, asking him\nto keep watch on him and not let him go anywhere except to service and\nto fulfil his duties.\n\nBesides this, a great pitfall for Sergius lay in the fact of his extreme\nantipathy to his new Abbot, a cunning worldly man who was making a\ncareer for himself in the Church. Struggle with himself as he might, he\ncould not master that feeling. He was submissive to the Abbot, but in\nthe depths of his soul he never ceased to condemn him. And in the second\nyear of his residence at the new monastery that ill-feeling broke out.\n\nThe Vigil service was being performed in the large church on the eve of\nthe feast of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin, and there were many\nvisitors. The Abbot himself was conducting the service. Father Sergius\nwas standing in his usual place and praying: that is, he was in that\ncondition of struggle which always occupied him during the service,\nespecially in the large church when he was not himself conducting the\nservice. This conflict was occasioned by his irritation at the presence\nof fine folk, especially ladies. He tried not to see them or to notice\nall that went on: how a soldier conducted them, pushing the\ncommon people aside, how the ladies pointed out the monks to one\nanother--especially himself and a monk noted for his good looks. He\ntried as it were to keep his mind in blinkers, to see nothing but\nthe light of the candles on the altar-screen, the icons, and those\nconducting the service. He tried to hear nothing but the prayers\nthat were being chanted or read, to feel nothing but self-oblivion in\nconsciousness of the fulfilment of duty--a feeling he always experienced\nwhen hearing or reciting in advance the prayers he had so often heard.\n\nSo he stood, crossing and prostrating himself when necessary, and\nstruggled with himself, now giving way to cold condemnation and now to\na consciously evoked obliteration of thought and feeling. Then the\nsacristan, Father Nicodemus--also a great stumbling-block to Sergius\nwho involuntarily reproached him for flattering and fawning on the\nAbbot--approached him and, bowing low, requested his presence behind the\nholy gates. Father Sergius straightened his mantle, put on his biretta,\nand went circumspectly through the crowd.\n\n'Lise, regarde a droite, c'est lui!' he heard a woman's voice say.\n\n'Ou, ou? Il n'est pas tellement beau.'\n\nHe knew that they were speaking of him. He heard them and, as always\nat moments of temptation, he repeated the words, 'Lead us not into\ntemptation,' and bowing his head and lowering his eyes went past the\nambo and in by the north door, avoiding the canons in their cassocks who\nwere just then passing the altar-screen. On entering the sanctuary he\nbowed, crossing himself as usual and bending double before the icons.\nThen, raising his head but without turning, he glanced out of the corner\nof his eye at the Abbot, whom he saw standing beside another glittering\nfigure.\n\nThe Abbot was standing by the wall in his vestments. Having freed his\nshort plump hands from beneath his chasuble he had folded them over\nhis fat body and protruding stomach, and fingering the cords of his\nvestments was smilingly saying something to a military man in the\nuniform of a general of the Imperial suite, with its insignia\nand shoulder-knots which Father Sergius's experienced eye at once\nrecognized. This general had been the commander of the regiment in which\nSergius had served. He now evidently occupied an important position, and\nFather Sergius at once noticed that the Abbot was aware of this and that\nhis red face and bald head beamed with satisfaction and pleasure. This\nvexed and disgusted Father Sergius, the more so when he heard that the\nAbbot had only sent for him to satisfy the general's curiosity to see a\nman who had formerly served with him, as he expressed it.\n\n'Very pleased to see you in your angelic guise,' said the general,\nholding out his hand. 'I hope you have not forgotten an old comrade.'\n\nThe whole thing--the Abbot's red, smiling face amid its fringe of grey,\nthe general's words, his well-cared-for face with its self-satisfied\nsmile and the smell of wine from his breath and of cigars from his\nwhiskers--revolted Father Sergius. He bowed again to the Abbot and said:\n\n'Your reverence deigned to send for me?'--and stopped, the whole\nexpression of his face and eyes asking why.\n\n'Yes, to meet the General,' replied the Abbot.\n\n'Your reverence, I left the world to save myself from temptation,' said\nFather Sergius, turning pale and with quivering lips. 'Why do you expose\nme to it during prayers and in God's house?'\n\n'You may go! Go!' said the Abbot, flaring up and frowning.\n\nNext day Father Sergius asked pardon of the Abbot and of the brethren\nfor his pride, but at the same time, after a night spent in prayer, he\ndecided that he must leave this monastery, and he wrote to the starets\nbegging permission to return to him. He wrote that he felt his weakness\nand incapacity to struggle against temptation without his help and\npenitently confessed his sin of pride. By return of post came a letter\nfrom the starets, who wrote that Sergius's pride was the cause of all\nthat had happened. The old man pointed out that his fits of anger were\ndue to the fact that in refusing all clerical honours he humiliated\nhimself not for the sake of God but for the sake of his pride. 'There\nnow, am I not a splendid man not to want anything?' That was why he\ncould not tolerate the Abbot's action. 'I have renounced everything for\nthe glory of God, and here I am exhibited like a wild beast!' 'Had you\nrenounced vanity for God's sake you would have borne it. Worldly pride\nis not yet dead in you. I have thought about you, Sergius my son, and\nprayed also, and this is what God has suggested to me. At the Tambov\nhermitage the anchorite Hilary, a man of saintly life, has died. He had\nlived there eighteen years. The Tambov Abbot is asking whether there is\nnot a brother who would take his place. And here comes your letter. Go\nto Father Paissy of the Tambov Monastery. I will write to him about you,\nand you must ask for Hilary's cell. Not that you can replace Hilary, but\nyou need solitude to quell your pride. May God bless you!'\n\nSergius obeyed the starets, showed his letter to the Abbot, and having\nobtained his permission, gave up his cell, handed all his possessions\nover to the monastery, and set out for the Tambov hermitage.\n\nThere the Abbot, an excellent manager of merchant origin, received\nSergius simply and quietly and placed him in Hilary's cell, at first\nassigning to him a lay brother but afterwards leaving him alone, at\nSergius's own request. The cell was a dual cave, dug into the hillside,\nand in it Hilary had been buried. In the back part was Hilary's grave,\nwhile in the front was a niche for sleeping, with a straw mattress, a\nsmall table, and a shelf with icons and books. Outside the outer door,\nwhich fastened with a hook, was another shelf on which, once a day, a\nmonk placed food from the monastery.\n\nAnd so Sergius became a hermit.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAt Carnival time, in the sixth year of Sergius's life at the hermitage,\na merry company of rich people, men and women from a neighbouring town,\nmade up a troyka-party, after a meal of carnival-pancakes and wine. The\ncompany consisted of two lawyers, a wealthy landowner, an officer, and\nfour ladies. One lady was the officer's wife, another the wife of\nthe landowner, the third his sister--a young girl--and the fourth a\ndivorcee, beautiful, rich, and eccentric, who amazed and shocked the\ntown by her escapades.\n\nThe weather was excellent and the snow-covered road smooth as a floor.\nThey drove some seven miles out of town, and then stopped and consulted\nas to whether they should turn back or drive farther.\n\n'But where does this road lead to?' asked Makovkina, the beautiful\ndivorcee.\n\n'To Tambov, eight miles from here,' replied one of the lawyers, who was\nhaving a flirtation with her.\n\n'And then where?'\n\n'Then on to L----, past the Monastery.'\n\n'Where that Father Sergius lives?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Kasatsky, the handsome hermit?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Mesdames et messieurs, let us drive on and see Kasatsky! We can stop at\nTambov and have something to eat.'\n\n'But we shouldn't get home to-night!'\n\n'Never mind, we will stay at Kasatsky's.'\n\n'Well, there is a very good hostelry at the Monastery. I stayed there\nwhen I was defending Makhin.'\n\n'No, I shall spend the night at Kasatsky's!'\n\n'Impossible! Even your omnipotence could not accomplish that!'\n\n'Impossible? Will you bet?'\n\n'All right! If you spend the night with him, the stake shall be whatever\nyou like.'\n\n'A DISCRETION!'\n\n'But on your side too!'\n\n'Yes, of course. Let us drive on.'\n\nVodka was handed to the drivers, and the party got out a box of pies,\nwine, and sweets for themselves. The ladies wrapped up in their white\ndogskins. The drivers disputed as to whose troyka should go ahead, and\nthe youngest, seating himself sideways with a dashing air, swung his\nlong knout and shouted to the horses. The troyka-bells tinkled and the\nsledge-runners squeaked over the snow.\n\nThe sledge swayed hardly at all. The shaft-horse, with his tightly bound\ntail under his decorated breechband, galloped smoothly and briskly; the\nsmooth road seemed to run rapidly backwards, while the driver dashingly\nshook the reins. One of the lawyers and the officer sitting opposite\ntalked nonsense to Makovkina's neighbour, but Makovkina herself sat\nmotionless and in thought, tightly wrapped in her fur. 'Always the same\nand always nasty! The same red shiny faces smelling of wine and cigars!\nThe same talk, the same thoughts, and always about the same things! And\nthey are all satisfied and confident that it should be so, and will\ngo on living like that till they die. But I can't. It bores me. I want\nsomething that would upset it all and turn it upside down. Suppose\nit happened to us as to those people--at Saratov was it?--who kept on\ndriving and froze to death.... What would our people do? How would\nthey behave? Basely, for certain. Each for himself. And I too should act\nbadly. But I at any rate have beauty. They all know it. And how about\nthat monk? Is it possible that he has become indifferent to it? No! That\nis the one thing they all care for--like that cadet last autumn. What a\nfool he was!'\n\n'Ivan Nikolaevich!' she said aloud.\n\n'What are your commands?'\n\n'How old is he?'\n\n'Who?'\n\n'Kasatsky.'\n\n'Over forty, I should think.'\n\n'And does he receive all visitors?'\n\n'Yes, everybody, but not always.'\n\n'Cover up my feet. Not like that--how clumsy you are! No! More,\nmore--like that! But you need not squeeze them!'\n\nSo they came to the forest where the cell was.\n\nMakovkina got out of the sledge, and told them to drive on. They tried\nto dissuade her, but she grew irritable and ordered them to go on.\n\nWhen the sledges had gone she went up the path in her white dogskin\ncoat. The lawyer got out and stopped to watch her.\n\nIt was Father Sergius's sixth year as a recluse, and he was now\nforty-nine. His life in solitude was hard--not on account of the fasts\nand the prayers (they were no hardship to him) but on account of an\ninner conflict he had not at all anticipated. The sources of that\nconflict were two: doubts, and the lust of the flesh. And these two\nenemies always appeared together. It seemed to him that they were two\nfoes, but in reality they were one and the same. As soon as doubt was\ngone so was the lustful desire. But thinking them to be two different\nfiends he fought them separately.\n\n'O my God, my God!' thought he. 'Why dost thou not grant me faith? There\nis lust, of course: even the saints had to fight that--Saint Anthony and\nothers. But they had faith, while I have moments, hours, and days, when\nit is absent. Why does the whole world, with all its delights, exist\nif it is sinful and must be renounced? Why hast Thou created this\ntemptation? Temptation? Is it not rather a temptation that I wish to\nabandon all the joys of earth and prepare something for myself there\nwhere perhaps there is nothing?' And he became horrified and filled with\ndisgust at himself. 'Vile creature! And it is you who wish to become a\nsaint!' he upbraided himself, and he began to pray. But as soon as he\nstarted to pray he saw himself vividly as he had been at the Monastery,\nin a majestic post in biretta and mantle, and he shook his head. 'No,\nthat is not right. It is deception. I may deceive others, but not myself\nor God. I am not a majestic man, but a pitiable and ridiculous one!' And\nhe threw back the folds of his cassock and smiled as he looked at his\nthin legs in their underclothing.\n\nThen he dropped the folds of the cassock again and began reading the\nprayers, making the sign of the cross and prostrating himself. 'Can\nit be that this couch will be my bier?' he read. And it seemed as if a\ndevil whispered to him: 'A solitary couch is itself a bier. Falsehood!'\nAnd in imagination he saw the shoulders of a widow with whom he had\nlived. He shook himself, and went on reading. Having read the precepts\nhe took up the Gospels, opened the book, and happened on a passage\nhe often repeated and knew by heart: 'Lord, I believe. Help thou my\nunbelief!'--and he put away all the doubts that had arisen. As one\nreplaces an object of insecure equilibrium, so he carefully replaced his\nbelief on its shaky pedestal and carefully stepped back from it so as\nnot to shake or upset it. The blinkers were adjusted again and he felt\ntranquillized, and repeating his childhood's prayer: 'Lord, receive me,\nreceive me!' he felt not merely at ease, but thrilled and joyful. He\ncrossed himself and lay down on the bedding on his narrow bench, tucking\nhis summer cassock under his head. He fell asleep at once, and in his\nlight slumber he seemed to hear the tinkling of sledge bells. He did not\nknow whether he was dreaming or awake, but a knock at the door aroused\nhim. He sat up, distrusting his senses, but the knock was repeated. Yes,\nit was a knock close at hand, at his door, and with it the sound of a\nwoman's voice.\n\n'My God! Can it be true, as I have read in the Lives of the Saints, that\nthe devil takes on the form of a woman? Yes--it is a woman's voice.\nAnd a tender, timid, pleasant voice. Phui!' And he spat to exorcise the\ndevil. 'No, it was only my imagination,' he assured himself, and he\nwent to the corner where his lectern stood, falling on his knees in the\nregular and habitual manner which of itself gave him consolation and\nsatisfaction. He sank down, his hair hanging over his face, and pressed\nhis head, already going bald in front, to the cold damp strip of drugget\non the draughty floor. He read the psalm old Father Pimon had told him\nwarded off temptation. He easily raised his light and emaciated body\non his strong sinewy legs and tried to continue saying his prayers, but\ninstead of doing so he involuntarily strained his hearing. He wished\nto hear more. All was quiet. From the corner of the roof regular drops\ncontinued to fall into the tub below. Outside was a mist and fog eating\ninto the snow that lay on the ground. It was still, very still. And\nsuddenly there was a rustling at the window and a voice--that\nsame tender, timid voice, which could only belong to an attractive\nwoman--said:\n\n'Let me in, for Christ's sake!'\n\nIt seemed as though his blood had all rushed to his heart and settled\nthere. He could hardly breathe. 'Let God arise and let his enemies be\nscattered...'\n\n'But I am not a devil!' It was obvious that the lips that uttered this\nwere smiling. 'I am not a devil, but only a sinful woman who has lost\nher way, not figuratively but literally!' She laughed. 'I am frozen and\nbeg for shelter.'\n\nHe pressed his face to the window, but the little icon-lamp was\nreflected by it and shone on the whole pane. He put his hands to both\nsides of his face and peered between them. Fog, mist, a tree, and--just\nopposite him--she herself. Yes, there, a few inches from him, was the\nsweet, kindly frightened face of a woman in a cap and a coat of long\nwhite fur, leaning towards him. Their eyes met with instant recognition:\nnot that they had ever known one another, they had never met before,\nbut by the look they exchanged they--and he particularly--felt that they\nknew and understood one another. After that glance to imagine her to be\na devil and not a simple, kindly, sweet, timid woman, was impossible.\n\n'Who are you? Why have you come?' he asked.\n\n'Do please open the door!' she replied, with capricious authority. 'I am\nfrozen. I tell you I have lost my way.'\n\n'But I am a monk--a hermit.'\n\n'Oh, do please open the door--or do you wish me to freeze under your\nwindow while you say your prayers?'\n\n'But how have you...'\n\n'I shan't eat you. For God's sake let me in! I am quite frozen.'\n\nShe really did feel afraid, and said this in an almost tearful voice.\n\nHe stepped back from the window and looked at an icon of the Saviour\nin His crown of thorns. 'Lord, help me! Lord, help me!' he exclaimed,\ncrossing himself and bowing low. Then he went to the door, and opening\nit into the tiny porch, felt for the hook that fastened the outer door\nand began to lift it. He heard steps outside. She was coming from the\nwindow to the door. 'Ah!' she suddenly exclaimed, and he understood\nthat she had stepped into the puddle that the dripping from the roof had\nformed at the threshold. His hands trembled, and he could not raise the\nhook of the tightly closed door.\n\n'Oh, what are you doing? Let me in! I am all wet. I am frozen! You are\nthinking about saving your soul and are letting me freeze to death...'\n\nHe jerked the door towards him, raised the hook, and without considering\nwhat he was doing, pushed it open with such force that it struck her.\n\n'Oh--PARDON!' he suddenly exclaimed, reverting completely to his old\nmanner with ladies.\n\nShe smiled on hearing that PARDON. 'He is not quite so terrible, after\nall,' she thought. 'It's all right. It is you who must pardon me,' she\nsaid, stepping past him. 'I should never have ventured, but such an\nextraordinary circumstance...'\n\n'If you please!' he uttered, and stood aside to let her pass him. A\nstrong smell of fine scent, which he had long not encountered, struck\nhim. She went through the little porch into the cell where he lived. He\nclosed the outer door without fastening the hook, and stepped in after\nher.\n\n'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner! Lord, have\nmercy on me a sinner!' he prayed unceasingly, not merely to himself but\ninvoluntarily moving his lips. 'If you please!' he said to her again.\nShe stood in the middle of the room, moisture dripping from her to the\nfloor as she looked him over. Her eyes were laughing.\n\n'Forgive me for having disturbed your solitude. But you see what a\nposition I am in. It all came about from our starting from town for a\nsledge-drive, and my making a bet that I would walk back by myself from\nthe Vorobevka to the town. But then I lost my way, and if I had not\nhappened to come upon your cell...' She began lying, but his face\nconfused her so that she could not continue, but became silent. She had\nnot expected him to be at all such as he was. He was not as handsome\nas she had imagined, but was nevertheless beautiful in her eyes: his\ngreyish hair and beard, slightly curling, his fine, regular nose,\nand his eyes like glowing coal when he looked at her, made a strong\nimpression on her.\n\nHe saw that she was lying.\n\n'Yes... so,' said he, looking at her and again lowering his eyes. 'I\nwill go in there, and this place is at your disposal.'\n\nAnd taking down the little lamp, he lit a candle, and bowing low to her\nwent into the small cell beyond the partition, and she heard him begin\nto move something about there. 'Probably he is barricading himself in\nfrom me!' she thought with a smile, and throwing off her white dogskin\ncloak she tried to take off her cap, which had become entangled in her\nhair and in the woven kerchief she was wearing under it. She had not\ngot at all wet when standing under the window, and had said so only as\na pretext to get him to let her in. But she really had stepped into the\npuddle at the door, and her left foot was wet up to the ankle and her\novershoe full of water. She sat down on his bed--a bench only covered by\na bit of carpet--and began to take off her boots. The little cell seemed\nto her charming. The narrow little room, some seven feet by nine, was as\nclean as glass. There was nothing in it but the bench on which she\nwas sitting, the book-shelf above it, and a lectern in the corner.\nA sheepskin coat and a cassock hung on nails by the door. Above the\nlectern was the little lamp and an icon of Christ in His crown of\nthorns. The room smelt strangely of perspiration and of earth. It all\npleased her--even that smell. Her wet feet, especially one of them, were\nuncomfortable, and she quickly began to take off her boots and stockings\nwithout ceasing to smile, pleased not so much at having achieved her\nobject as because she perceived that she had abashed that charming,\nstrange, striking, and attractive man. 'He did not respond, but what of\nthat?' she said to herself.\n\n'Father Sergius! Father Sergius! Or how does one call you?'\n\n'What do you want?' replied a quiet voice.\n\n'Please forgive me for disturbing your solitude, but really I could not\nhelp it. I should simply have fallen ill. And I don't know that I shan't\nnow. I am all wet and my feet are like ice.'\n\n'Pardon me,' replied the quiet voice. 'I cannot be of any assistance to\nyou.'\n\n'I would not have disturbed you if I could have helped it. I am only\nhere till daybreak.'\n\nHe did not reply and she heard him muttering something, probably his\nprayers.\n\n'You will not be coming in here?' she asked, smiling. 'For I must\nundress to dry myself.'\n\nHe did not reply, but continued to read his prayers.\n\n'Yes, that is a man!' thought she, getting her dripping boot off with\ndifficulty. She tugged at it, but could not get it off. The absurdity of\nit struck her and she began to laugh almost inaudibly. But knowing that\nhe would hear her laughter and would be moved by it just as she wished\nhim to be, she laughed louder, and her laughter--gay, natural, and\nkindly--really acted on him just in the way she wished.\n\n'Yes, I could love a man like that--such eyes and such a simple noble\nface, and passionate too despite all the prayers he mutters!' thought\nshe. 'You can't deceive a woman in these things. As soon as he put his\nface to the window and saw me, he understood and knew. The glimmer of it\nwas in his eyes and remained there. He began to love me and desired me.\nYes--desired!' said she, getting her overshoe and her boot off at last\nand starting to take off her stockings. To remove those long stockings\nfastened with elastic it was necessary to raise her skirts. She felt\nembarrassed and said:\n\n'Don't come in!'\n\nBut there was no reply from the other side of the wall. The steady\nmuttering continued and also a sound of moving.\n\n'He is prostrating himself to the ground, no doubt,' thought she.\n'But he won't bow himself out of it. He is thinking of me just as I\nam thinking of him. He is thinking of these feet of mine with the same\nfeeling that I have!' And she pulled off her wet stockings and put her\nfeet up on the bench, pressing them under her. She sat a while like that\nwith her arms round her knees and looking pensively before her. 'But it\nis a desert, here in this silence. No one would ever know....'\n\nShe rose, took her stockings over to the stove, and hung them on the\ndamper. It was a queer damper, and she turned it about, and then,\nstepping lightly on her bare feet, returned to the bench and sat down\nthere again with her feet up.\n\nThere was complete silence on the other side of the partition. She\nlooked at the tiny watch that hung round her neck. It was two o'clock.\n'Our party should return about three!' She had not more than an hour\nbefore her. 'Well, am I to sit like this all alone? What nonsense! I\ndon't want to. I will call him at once.'\n\n'Father Sergius, Father Sergius! Sergey Dmitrich! Prince Kasatsky!'\n\nBeyond the partition all was silent.\n\n'Listen! This is cruel. I would not call you if it were not necessary.\nI am ill. I don't know what is the matter with me!' she exclaimed in a\ntone of suffering. 'Oh! Oh!' she groaned, falling back on the bench. And\nstrange to say she really felt that her strength was failing, that\nshe was becoming faint, that everything in her ached, and that she was\nshivering with fever.\n\n'Listen! Help me! I don't know what is the matter with me. Oh! Oh!' She\nunfastened her dress, exposing her breast, and lifted her arms, bare to\nthe elbow. 'Oh! Oh!'\n\nAll this time he stood on the other side of the partition and prayed.\nHaving finished all the evening prayers, he now stood motionless, his\neyes looking at the end of his nose, and mentally repeated with all his\nsoul: 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me!'\n\nBut he had heard everything. He had heard how the silk rustled when she\ntook off her dress, how she stepped with bare feet on the floor, and had\nheard how she rubbed her feet with her hand. He felt his own weakness,\nand that he might be lost at any moment. That was why he prayed\nunceasingly. He felt rather as the hero in the fairy-tale must have felt\nwhen he had to go on and on without looking round. So Sergius heard and\nfelt that danger and destruction were there, hovering above and\naround him, and that he could only save himself by not looking in that\ndirection for an instant. But suddenly the desire to look seized him. At\nthe same instant she said:\n\n'This is inhuman. I may die....'\n\n'Yes, I will go to her, but like the Saint who laid one hand on the\nadulteress and thrust his other into the brazier. But there is no\nbrazier here.' He looked round. The lamp! He put his finger over the\nflame and frowned, preparing himself to suffer. And for a rather long\ntime, as it seemed to him, there was no sensation, but suddenly--he\nhad not yet decided whether it was painful enough--he writhed all over,\njerked his hand away, and waved it in the air. 'No, I can't stand that!'\n\n'For God's sake come to me! I am dying! Oh!'\n\n'Well--shall I perish? No, not so!'\n\n'I will come to you directly,' he said, and having opened his door, he\nwent without looking at her through the cell into the porch where he\nused to chop wood. There he felt for the block and for an axe which\nleant against the wall.\n\n'Immediately!' he said, and taking up the axe with his right hand he\nlaid the forefinger of his left hand on the block, swung the axe, and\nstruck with it below the second joint. The finger flew off more lightly\nthan a stick of similar thickness, and bounding up, turned over on the\nedge of the block and then fell to the floor.\n\nHe heard it fall before he felt any pain, but before he had time to be\nsurprised he felt a burning pain and the warmth of flowing blood. He\nhastily wrapped the stump in the skirt of his cassock, and pressing it\nto his hip went back into the room, and standing in front of the woman,\nlowered his eyes and asked in a low voice: 'What do you want?'\n\nShe looked at his pale face and his quivering left cheek, and suddenly\nfelt ashamed. She jumped up, seized her fur cloak, and throwing it round\nher shoulders, wrapped herself up in it.\n\n'I was in pain... I have caught cold... I... Father Sergius...\nI...'\n\nHe let his eyes, shining with a quiet light of joy, rest upon her, and\nsaid:\n\n'Dear sister, why did you wish to ruin your immortal soul? Temptations\nmust come into the world, but woe to him by whom temptation comes. Pray\nthat God may forgive us!'\n\nShe listened and looked at him. Suddenly she heard the sound of\nsomething dripping. She looked down and saw that blood was flowing from\nhis hand and down his cassock.\n\n'What have you done to your hand?' She remembered the sound she had\nheard, and seizing the little lamp ran out into the porch. There on the\nfloor she saw the bloody finger. She returned with her face paler than\nhis and was about to speak to him, but he silently passed into the back\ncell and fastened the door.\n\n'Forgive me!' she said. 'How can I atone for my sin?'\n\n'Go away.'\n\n'Let me tie up your hand.'\n\n'Go away from here.'\n\nShe dressed hurriedly and silently, and when ready sat waiting in her\nfurs. The sledge-bells were heard outside.\n\n'Father Sergius, forgive me!'\n\n'Go away. God will forgive.'\n\n'Father Sergius! I will change my life. Do not forsake me!'\n\n'Go away.'\n\n'Forgive me--and give me your blessing!'\n\n'In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost!'--she\nheard his voice from behind the partition. 'Go!'\n\nShe burst into sobs and left the cell. The lawyer came forward to meet\nher.\n\n'Well, I see I have lost the bet. It can't be helped. Where will you\nsit?'\n\n'It is all the same to me.'\n\nShe took a seat in the sledge, and did not utter a word all the way\nhome.\n\nA year later she entered a convent as a novice, and lived a strict life\nunder the direction of the hermit Arseny, who wrote letters to her at\nlong intervals.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nFather Sergius lived as a recluse for another seven years.\n\nAt first he accepted much of what people brought him--tea, sugar, white\nbread, milk, clothing, and fire-wood. But as time went on he led a more\nand more austere life, refusing everything superfluous, and finally he\naccepted nothing but rye-bread once a week. Everything else that was\nbrought to him he gave to the poor who came to him. He spent his entire\ntime in his cell, in prayer or in conversation with callers, who became\nmore and more numerous as time went on. Only three times a year did\nhe go out to church, and when necessary he went out to fetch water and\nwood.\n\nThe episode with Makovkina had occurred after five years of his hermit\nlife. That occurrence soon became generally known--her nocturnal visit,\nthe change she underwent, and her entry into a convent. From that time\nFather Sergius's fame increased. More and more visitors came to see him,\nother monks settled down near his cell, and a church was erected there\nand also a hostelry. His fame, as usual exaggerating his feats, spread\never more and more widely. People began to come to him from a distance,\nand began bringing invalids to him whom they declared he cured.\n\nHis first cure occurred in the eighth year of his life as a hermit. It\nwas the healing of a fourteen-year-old boy, whose mother brought him\nto Father Sergius insisting that he should lay his hand on the child's\nhead. It had never occurred to Father Sergius that he could cure the\nsick. He would have regarded such a thought as a great sin of pride; but\nthe mother who brought the boy implored him insistently, falling at his\nfeet and saying: 'Why do you, who heal others, refuse to help my son?'\nShe besought him in Christ's name. When Father Sergius assured her that\nonly God could heal the sick, she replied that she only wanted him to\nlay his hands on the boy and pray for him. Father Sergius refused and\nreturned to his cell. But next day (it was in autumn and the nights were\nalready cold) on going out for water he saw the same mother with her\nson, a pale boy of fourteen, and was met by the same petition.\n\nHe remembered the parable of the unjust judge, and though he had\npreviously felt sure that he ought to refuse, he now began to hesitate\nand, having hesitated, took to prayer and prayed until a decision formed\nitself in his soul. This decision was, that he ought to accede to the\nwoman's request and that her faith might save her son. As for himself,\nhe would in this case be but an insignificant instrument chosen by God.\n\nAnd going out to the mother he did what she asked--laid his hand on the\nboy's head and prayed.\n\nThe mother left with her son, and a month later the boy recovered, and\nthe fame of the holy healing power of the starets Sergius (as they now\ncalled him) spread throughout the whole district. After that, not a week\npassed without sick people coming, riding or on foot, to Father Sergius;\nand having acceded to one petition he could not refuse others, and he\nlaid his hands on many and prayed. Many recovered, and his fame spread\nmore and more.\n\nSo seven years passed in the Monastery and thirteen in his hermit's\ncell. He now had the appearance of an old man: his beard was long and\ngrey, but his hair, though thin, was still black and curly.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nFor some weeks Father Sergius had been living with one persistent\nthought: whether he was right in accepting the position in which he had\nnot so much placed himself as been placed by the Archimandrite and\nthe Abbot. That position had begun after the recovery of the\nfourteen-year-old boy. From that time, with each month, week, and day\nthat passed, Sergius felt his own inner life wasting away and being\nreplaced by external life. It was as if he had been turned inside out.\n\nSergius saw that he was a means of attracting visitors and contributions\nto the monastery, and that therefore the authorities arranged matters in\nsuch a way as to make as much use of him as possible. For instance, they\nrendered it impossible for him to do any manual work. He was supplied\nwith everything he could want, and they only demanded of him that he\nshould not refuse his blessing to those who came to seek it. For his\nconvenience they appointed days when he would receive. They arranged a\nreception-room for men, and a place was railed in so that he should not\nbe pushed over by the crowds of women visitors, and so that he could\nconveniently bless those who came.\n\nThey told him that people needed him, and that fulfilling Christ's law\nof love he could not refuse their demand to see him, and that to avoid\nthem would be cruel. He could not but agree with this, but the more he\ngave himself up to such a life the more he felt that what was internal\nbecame external, and that the fount of living water within him dried\nup, and that what he did now was done more and more for men and less and\nless for God.\n\nWhether he admonished people, or simply blessed them, or prayed for the\nsick, or advised people about their lives, or listened to expressions of\ngratitude from those he had helped by precepts, or alms, or healing (as\nthey assured him)--he could not help being pleased at it, and could not\nbe indifferent to the results of his activity and to the influence he\nexerted. He thought himself a shining light, and the more he felt this\nthe more was he conscious of a weakening, a dying down of the divine\nlight of truth that shone within him.\n\n'In how far is what I do for God and in how far is it for men?' That was\nthe question that insistently tormented him and to which he was not so\nmuch unable to give himself an answer as unable to face the answer.\n\nIn the depth of his soul he felt that the devil had substituted an\nactivity for men in place of his former activity for God. He felt this\nbecause, just as it had formerly been hard for him to be torn from his\nsolitude so now that solitude itself was hard for him. He was oppressed\nand wearied by visitors, but at the bottom of his heart he was glad of\ntheir presence and glad of the praise they heaped upon him.\n\nThere was a time when he decided to go away and hide. He even planned\nall that was necessary for that purpose. He prepared for himself a\npeasant's shirt, trousers, coat, and cap. He explained that he wanted\nthese to give to those who asked. And he kept these clothes in his cell,\nplanning how he would put them on, cut his hair short, and go away.\nFirst he would go some three hundred versts by train, then he would\nleave the train and walk from village to village. He asked an old man\nwho had been a soldier how he tramped: what people gave him, and what\nshelter they allowed him. The soldier told him where people were most\ncharitable, and where they would take a wanderer in for the night, and\nFather Sergius intended to avail himself of this information. He even\nput on those clothes one night in his desire to go, but he could not\ndecide what was best--to remain or to escape. At first he was in doubt,\nbut afterwards this indecision passed. He submitted to custom and\nyielded to the devil, and only the peasant garb reminded him of the\nthought and feeling he had had.\n\nEvery day more and more people flocked to him and less and less time was\nleft him for prayer and for renewing his spiritual strength. Sometimes\nin lucid moments he thought he was like a place where there had once\nbeen a spring. 'There used to be a feeble spring of living water which\nflowed quietly from me and through me. That was true life, the time when\nshe tempted me!' (He always thought with ecstasy of that night and of\nher who was now Mother Agnes.) She had tasted of that pure water, but\nsince then there had not been time for it to collect before thirsty\npeople came crowding in and pushing one another aside. And they had\ntrampled everything down and nothing was left but mud.\n\nSo he thought in rare moments of lucidity, but his usual state of mind\nwas one of weariness and a tender pity for himself because of that\nweariness.\n\nIt was in spring, on the eve of the mid-Pentecostal feast. Father\nSergius was officiating at the Vigil Service in his hermitage church,\nwhere the congregation was as large as the little church could\nhold--about twenty people. They were all well-to-do proprietors or\nmerchants. Father Sergius admitted anyone, but a selection was made by\nthe monk in attendance and by an assistant who was sent to the hermitage\nevery day from the monastery. A crowd of some eighty people--pilgrims\nand peasants, and especially peasant-women--stood outside waiting for\nFather Sergius to come out and bless them. Meanwhile he conducted\nthe service, but at the point at which he went out to the tomb of his\npredecessor, he staggered and would have fallen had he not been caught\nby a merchant standing behind him and by the monk acting as deacon.\n\n'What is the matter, Father Sergius? Dear man! O Lord!' exclaimed the\nwomen. 'He is as white as a sheet!'\n\nBut Father Sergius recovered immediately, and though very pale, he waved\nthe merchant and the deacon aside and continued to chant the service.\n\nFather Seraphim, the deacon, the acolytes, and Sofya Ivanovna, a lady\nwho always lived near the hermitage and tended Father Sergius, begged\nhim to bring the service to an end.\n\n'No, there's nothing the matter,' said Father Sergius, slightly smiling\nfrom beneath his moustache and continuing the service. 'Yes, that is the\nway the Saints behave!' thought he.\n\n'A holy man--an angel of God!' he heard just then the voice of Sofya\nIvanovna behind him, and also of the merchant who had supported him.\nHe did not heed their entreaties, but went on with the service. Again\ncrowding together they all made their way by the narrow passages back\ninto the little church, and there, though abbreviating it slightly,\nFather Sergius completed vespers.\n\nImmediately after the service Father Sergius, having pronounced the\nbenediction on those present, went over to the bench under the elm tree\nat the entrance to the cave. He wished to rest and breathe the fresh\nair--he felt in need of it. But as soon as he left the church the crowd\nof people rushed to him soliciting his blessing, his advice, and his\nhelp. There were pilgrims who constantly tramped from one holy place to\nanother and from one starets to another, and were always entranced by\nevery shrine and every starets. Father Sergius knew this common, cold,\nconventional, and most irreligious type. There were pilgrims, for\nthe most part discharged soldiers, unaccustomed to a settled life,\npoverty-stricken, and many of them drunken old men, who tramped from\nmonastery to monastery merely to be fed. And there were rough peasants\nand peasant-women who had come with their selfish requirements, seeking\ncures or to have doubts about quite practical affairs solved for them:\nabout marrying off a daughter, or hiring a shop, or buying a bit\nof land, or how to atone for having overlaid a child or having an\nillegitimate one.\n\nAll this was an old story and not in the least interesting to him. He\nknew he would hear nothing new from these folk, that they would arouse\nno religious emotion in him; but he liked to see the crowd to which\nhis blessing and advice was necessary and precious, so while that crowd\noppressed him it also pleased him. Father Seraphim began to drive them\naway, saying that Father Sergius was tired.\n\nBut Father Sergius, remembering the words of the Gospel: 'Forbid them'\n(children) 'not to come unto me,' and feeling tenderly towards himself\nat this recollection, said they should be allowed to approach.\n\nHe rose, went to the railing beyond which the crowd had gathered, and\nbegan blessing them and answering their questions, but in a voice so\nweak that he was touched with pity for himself. Yet despite his wish to\nreceive them all he could not do it. Things again grew dark before his\neyes, and he staggered and grasped the railings. He felt a rush of blood\nto his head and first went pale and then suddenly flushed.\n\n'I must leave the rest till to-morrow. I cannot do more to-day,'\nand, pronouncing a general benediction, he returned to the bench. The\nmerchant again supported him, and leading him by the arm helped him to\nbe seated.\n\n'Father!' came voices from the crowd. 'Dear Father! Do not forsake us.\nWithout you we are lost!'\n\nThe merchant, having seated Father Sergius on the bench under the elm,\ntook on himself police duties and drove the people off very resolutely.\nIt is true that he spoke in a low voice so that Father Sergius might not\nhear him, but his words were incisive and angry.\n\n'Be off, be off! He has blessed you, and what more do you want? Get\nalong with you, or I'll wring your necks! Move on there! Get along, you\nold woman with your dirty leg-bands! Go, go! Where are you shoving to?\nYou've been told that it is finished. To-morrow will be as God wills,\nbut for to-day he has finished!'\n\n'Father! Only let my eyes have a glimpse of his dear face!' said an old\nwoman.\n\n'I'll glimpse you! Where are you shoving to?'\n\nFather Sergius noticed that the merchant seemed to be acting roughly,\nand in a feeble voice told the attendant that the people should not be\ndriven away. He knew that they would be driven away all the same, and\nhe much desired to be left alone and to rest, but he sent the attendant\nwith that message to produce an impression.\n\n'All right, all right! I am not driving them away. I am only\nremonstrating with them,' replied the merchant. 'You know they wouldn't\nhesitate to drive a man to death. They have no pity, they only consider\nthemselves.... You've been told you cannot see him. Go away!\nTo-morrow!' And he got rid of them all.\n\nHe took all these pains because he liked order and liked to domineer\nand drive the people away, but chiefly because he wanted to have Father\nSergius to himself. He was a widower with an only daughter who was an\ninvalid and unmarried, and whom he had brought fourteen hundred versts\nto Father Sergius to be healed. For two years past he had been taking\nher to different places to be cured: first to the university clinic in\nthe chief town of the province, but that did no good; then to a peasant\nin the province of Samara, where she got a little better; then to a\ndoctor in Moscow to whom he paid much money, but this did no good at\nall. Now he had been told that Father Sergius wrought cures, and had\nbrought her to him. So when all the people had been driven away he\napproached Father Sergius, and suddenly falling on his knees loudly\nexclaimed:\n\n'Holy Father! Bless my afflicted offspring that she may be healed of her\nmalady. I venture to prostrate myself at your holy feet.'\n\nAnd he placed one hand on the other, cup-wise. He said and did all this\nas if he were doing something clearly and firmly appointed by law and\nusage--as if one must and should ask for a daughter to be cured in just\nthis way and no other. He did it with such conviction that it seemed\neven to Father Sergius that it should be said and done in just that way,\nbut nevertheless he bade him rise and tell him what the trouble was. The\nmerchant said that his daughter, a girl of twenty-two, had fallen ill\ntwo years ago, after her mother's sudden death. She had moaned (as\nhe expressed it) and since then had not been herself. And now he had\nbrought her fourteen hundred versts and she was waiting in the hostelry\ntill Father Sergius should give orders to bring her. She did not go out\nduring the day, being afraid of the light, and could only come after\nsunset.\n\n'Is she very weak?' asked Father Sergius.\n\n'No, she has no particular weakness. She is quite plump, and is only\n\"nerastenic\" the doctors say. If you will only let me bring her this\nevening, Father Sergius, I'll fly like a spirit to fetch her. Holy\nFather! Revive a parent's heart, restore his line, save his afflicted\ndaughter by your prayers!' And the merchant again threw himself on his\nknees and bending sideways, with his head resting on his clenched fists,\nremained stock still. Father Sergius again told him to get up, and\nthinking how heavy his activities were and how he went through with them\npatiently notwithstanding, he sighed heavily and after a few seconds of\nsilence, said:\n\n'Well, bring her this evening. I will pray for her, but now I am\ntired....' and he closed his eyes. 'I will send for you.'\n\nThe merchant went away, stepping on tiptoe, which only made his boots\ncreak the louder, and Father Sergius remained alone.\n\nHis whole life was filled by Church services and by people who came\nto see him, but to-day had been a particularly difficult one. In\nthe morning an important official had arrived and had had a long\nconversation with him; after that a lady had come with her son. This son\nwas a sceptical young professor whom the mother, an ardent believer and\ndevoted to Father Sergius, had brought that he might talk to him. The\nconversation had been very trying. The young man, evidently not wishing\nto have a controversy with a monk, had agreed with him in everything\nas with someone who was mentally inferior. Father Sergius saw that the\nyoung man did not believe but yet was satisfied, tranquil, and at ease,\nand the memory of that conversation now disquieted him.\n\n'Have something to eat, Father,' said the attendant.\n\n'All right, bring me something.'\n\nThe attendant went to a hut that had been arranged some ten paces from\nthe cave, and Father Sergius remained alone.\n\nThe time was long past when he had lived alone doing everything for\nhimself and eating only rye-bread, or rolls prepared for the Church. He\nhad been advised long since that he had no right to neglect his health,\nand he was given wholesome, though Lenten, food. He ate sparingly,\nthough much more than he had done, and often he ate with much pleasure,\nand not as formerly with aversion and a sense of guilt. So it was now.\nHe had some gruel, drank a cup of tea, and ate half a white roll.\n\nThe attendant went away, and Father Sergius remained alone under the elm\ntree.\n\nIt was a wonderful May evening, when the birches, aspens, elms, wild\ncherries, and oaks, had just burst into foliage.\n\nThe bush of wild cherries behind the elm tree was in full bloom and had\nnot yet begun to shed its blossoms, and the nightingales--one quite near\nat hand and two or three others in the bushes down by the river--burst\ninto full song after some preliminary twitters. From the river came the\nfar-off songs of peasants returning, no doubt, from their work. The sun\nwas setting behind the forest, its last rays glowing through the leaves.\nAll that side was brilliant green, the other side with the elm tree was\ndark. The cockchafers flew clumsily about, falling to the ground when\nthey collided with anything.\n\nAfter supper Father Sergius began to repeat a silent prayer: 'O Lord\nJesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon us!' and then he read a psalm,\nand suddenly in the middle of the psalm a sparrow flew out from the\nbush, alighted on the ground, and hopped towards him chirping as it\ncame, but then it took fright at something and flew away. He said a\nprayer which referred to his abandonment of the world, and hastened to\nfinish it in order to send for the merchant with the sick daughter. She\ninterested him in that she presented a distraction, and because both she\nand her father considered him a saint whose prayers were efficacious.\nOutwardly he disavowed that idea, but in the depths of his soul he\nconsidered it to be true.\n\nHe was often amazed that this had happened, that he, Stepan Kasatsky,\nhad come to be such an extraordinary saint and even a worker of\nmiracles, but of the fact that he was such there could not be the\nleast doubt. He could not fail to believe in the miracles he himself\nwitnessed, beginning with the sick boy and ending with the old woman who\nhad recovered her sight when he had prayed for her.\n\nStrange as it might be, it was so. Accordingly the merchant's daughter\ninterested him as a new individual who had faith in him, and also as a\nfresh opportunity to confirm his healing powers and enhance his fame.\n'They bring people a thousand versts and write about it in the papers.\nThe Emperor knows of it, and they know of it in Europe, in unbelieving\nEurope'--thought he. And suddenly he felt ashamed of his vanity and\nagain began to pray. 'Lord, King of Heaven, Comforter, Soul of Truth!\nCome and enter into me and cleanse me from all sin and save and bless\nmy soul. Cleanse me from the sin of worldly vanity that troubles me!' he\nrepeated, and he remembered how often he had prayed about this and how\nvain till now his prayers had been in that respect. His prayers worked\nmiracles for others, but in his own case God had not granted him\nliberation from this petty passion.\n\nHe remembered his prayers at the commencement of his life at the\nhermitage, when he prayed for purity, humility, and love, and how it\nseemed to him then that God heard his prayers. He had retained his\npurity and had chopped off his finger. And he lifted the shrivelled\nstump of that finger to his lips and kissed it. It seemed to him now\nthat he had been humble then when he had always seemed loathsome to\nhimself on account of his sinfulness; and when he remembered the tender\nfeelings with which he had then met an old man who was bringing a\ndrunken soldier to him to ask alms; and how he had received HER, it\nseemed to him that he had then possessed love also. But now? And he\nasked himself whether he loved anyone, whether he loved Sofya Ivanovna,\nor Father Seraphim, whether he had any feeling of love for all who had\ncome to him that day--for that learned young man with whom he had had\nthat instructive discussion in which he was concerned only to show off\nhis own intelligence and that he had not lagged behind the times in\nknowledge. He wanted and needed their love, but felt none towards them.\nHe now had neither love nor humility nor purity.\n\nHe was pleased to know that the merchant's daughter was twenty-two, and\nhe wondered whether she was good-looking. When he inquired whether she\nwas weak, he really wanted to know if she had feminine charm.\n\n'Can I have fallen so low?' he thought. 'Lord, help me! Restore me, my\nLord and God!' And he clasped his hands and began to pray.\n\nThe nightingales burst into song, a cockchafer knocked against him and\ncrept up the back of his neck. He brushed it off. 'But does He exist?\nWhat if I am knocking at a door fastened from outside? The bar is on the\ndoor for all to see. Nature--the nightingales and the cockchafers--is\nthat bar. Perhaps the young man was right.' And he began to pray aloud.\nHe prayed for a long time till these thoughts vanished and he again felt\ncalm and confident. He rang the bell and told the attendant to say that\nthe merchant might bring his daughter to him now.\n\nThe merchant came, leading his daughter by the arm. He led her into the\ncell and immediately left her.\n\nShe was a very fair girl, plump and very short, with a pale, frightened,\nchildish face and a much developed feminine figure. Father Sergius\nremained seated on the bench at the entrance and when she was passing\nand stopped beside him for his blessing he was aghast at himself for\nthe way he looked at her figure. As she passed by him he was acutely\nconscious of her femininity, though he saw by her face that she was\nsensual and feeble-minded. He rose and went into the cell. She was\nsitting on a stool waiting for him, and when he entered she rose.\n\n'I want to go back to Papa,' she said.\n\n'Don't be afraid,' he replied. 'What are you suffering from?'\n\n'I am in pain all over,' she said, and suddenly her face lit up with a\nsmile.\n\n'You will be well,' said he. 'Pray!'\n\n'What is the use of praying? I have prayed and it does no good'--and she\ncontinued to smile. 'I want you to pray for me and lay your hands on me.\nI saw you in a dream.'\n\n'How did you see me?'\n\n'I saw you put your hands on my breast like that.' She took his hand and\npressed it to her breast. 'Just here.'\n\nHe yielded his right hand to her.\n\n'What is your name?' he asked, trembling all over and feeling that he\nwas overcome and that his desire had already passed beyond control.\n\n'Marie. Why?'\n\nShe took his hand and kissed it, and then put her arm round his waist\nand pressed him to herself.\n\n'What are you doing?' he said. 'Marie, you are a devil!'\n\n'Oh, perhaps. What does it matter?'\n\nAnd embracing him she sat down with him on the bed.\n\nAt dawn he went out into the porch.\n\n'Can this all have happened? Her father will come and she will tell him\neverything. She is a devil! What am I to do? Here is the axe with which\nI chopped off my finger.' He snatched up the axe and moved back towards\nthe cell.\n\nThe attendant came up.\n\n'Do you want some wood chopped? Let me have the axe.'\n\nSergius yielded up the axe and entered the cell. She was lying\nthere asleep. He looked at her with horror, and passed on beyond the\npartition, where he took down the peasant clothes and put them on. Then\nhe seized a pair of scissors, cut off his long hair, and went out along\nthe path down the hill to the river, where he had not been for more than\nthree years.\n\nA road ran beside the river and he went along it and walked till noon.\nThen he went into a field of rye and lay down there. Towards evening\nhe approached a village, but without entering it went towards the cliff\nthat overhung the river. There he again lay down to rest.\n\nIt was early morning, half an hour before sunrise. All was damp and\ngloomy and a cold early wind was blowing from the west. 'Yes, I must end\nit all. There is no God. But how am I to end it? Throw myself into the\nriver? I can swim and should not drown. Hang myself? Yes, just throw\nthis sash over a branch.' This seemed so feasible and so easy that\nhe felt horrified. As usual at moments of despair he felt the need of\nprayer. But there was no one to pray to. There was no God. He lay down\nresting on his arm, and suddenly such a longing for sleep overcame him\nthat he could no longer support his head on his hand, but stretched out\nhis arm, laid his head upon it, and fell asleep. But that sleep lasted\nonly for a moment. He woke up immediately and began not to dream but to\nremember.\n\nHe saw himself as a child in his mother's home in the country. A\ncarriage drives up, and out of it steps Uncle Nicholas Sergeevich,\nwith his long, spade-shaped, black beard, and with him Pashenka, a thin\nlittle girl with large mild eyes and a timid pathetic face. And into\ntheir company of boys Pashenka is brought and they have to play with\nher, but it is dull. She is silly, and it ends by their making fun of\nher and forcing her to show how she can swim. She lies down on the floor\nand shows them, and they all laugh and make a fool of her. She sees this\nand blushes red in patches and becomes more pitiable than before,\nso pitiable that he feels ashamed and can never forget that crooked,\nkindly, submissive smile. And Sergius remembered having seen her since\nthen. Long after, just before he became a monk, she had married a\nlandowner who squandered all her fortune and was in the habit of beating\nher. She had had two children, a son and a daughter, but the son had\ndied while still young. And Sergius remembered having seen her very\nwretched. Then again he had seen her in the monastery when she was a\nwidow. She had been still the same, not exactly stupid, but insipid,\ninsignificant, and pitiable. She had come with her daughter and her\ndaughter's fiance. They were already poor at that time and later on he\nhad heard that she was living in a small provincial town and was very\npoor.\n\n'Why am I thinking about her?' he asked himself, but he could not cease\ndoing so. 'Where is she? How is she getting on? Is she still as unhappy\nas she was then when she had to show us how to swim on the floor? But\nwhy should I think about her? What am I doing? I must put an end to\nmyself.'\n\nAnd again he felt afraid, and again, to escape from that thought, he\nwent on thinking about Pashenka.\n\nSo he lay for a long time, thinking now of his unavoidable end and now\nof Pashenka. She presented herself to him as a means of salvation. At\nlast he fell asleep, and in his sleep he saw an angel who came to him\nand said: 'Go to Pashenka and learn from her what you have to do, what\nyour sin is, and wherein lies your salvation.'\n\nHe awoke, and having decided that this was a vision sent by God, he felt\nglad, and resolved to do what had been told him in the vision. He knew\nthe town where she lived. It was some three hundred versts (two hundred\nmiles) away, and he set out to walk there.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nPashenka had already long ceased to be Pashenka and had become old,\nwithered, wrinkled Praskovya Mikhaylovna, mother-in-law of that failure,\nthe drunken official Mavrikyev. She was living in the country town\nwhere he had had his last appointment, and there she was supporting the\nfamily: her daughter, her ailing neurasthenic son-in-law, and her five\ngrandchildren. She did this by giving music lessons to tradesmen's\ndaughters, giving four and sometimes five lessons a day of an hour each,\nand earning in this way some sixty rubles (6 pounds) a month. So they\nlived for the present, in expectation of another appointment. She had\nsent letters to all her relations and acquaintances asking them to\nobtain a post for her son-in-law, and among the rest she had written to\nSergius, but that letter had not reached him.\n\nIt was a Saturday, and Praskovya Mikhaylovna was herself mixing dough\nfor currant bread such as the serf-cook on her father's estate used\nto make so well. She wished to give her grandchildren a treat on the\nSunday.\n\nMasha, her daughter, was nursing her youngest child, the eldest boy and\ngirl were at school, and her son-in-law was asleep, not having slept\nduring the night. Praskovya Mikhaylovna had remained awake too for a\ngreat part of the night, trying to soften her daughter's anger against\nher husband.\n\nShe saw that it was impossible for her son-in-law, a weak creature, to\nbe other than he was, and realized that his wife's reproaches could do\nno good--so she used all her efforts to soften those reproaches and to\navoid recrimination and anger. Unkindly relations between people caused\nher actual physical suffering. It was so clear to her that bitter\nfeelings do not make anything better, but only make everything worse.\nShe did not in fact think about this: she simply suffered at the sight\nof anger as she would from a bad smell, a harsh noise, or from blows on\nher body.\n\nShe had--with a feeling of self-satisfaction--just taught Lukerya how\nto mix the dough, when her six-year-old grandson Misha, wearing an\napron and with darned stockings on his crooked little legs, ran into the\nkitchen with a frightened face.\n\n'Grandma, a dreadful old man wants to see you.'\n\nLukerya looked out at the door.\n\n'There is a pilgrim of some kind, a man...'\n\nPraskovya Mikhaylovna rubbed her thin elbows against one another, wiped\nher hands on her apron and went upstairs to get a five-kopek piece\n[about a penny] out of her purse for him, but remembering that she had\nnothing less than a ten-kopek piece she decided to give him some bread\ninstead. She returned to the cupboard, but suddenly blushed at the\nthought of having grudged the ten-kopek piece, and telling Lukerya to\ncut a slice of bread, went upstairs again to fetch it. 'It serves you\nright,' she said to herself. 'You must now give twice over.'\n\nShe gave both the bread and the money to the pilgrim, and when doing\nso--far from being proud of her generosity--she excused herself for\ngiving so little. The man had such an imposing appearance.\n\nThough he had tramped two hundred versts as a beggar, though he was\ntattered and had grown thin and weatherbeaten, though he had cropped his\nlong hair and was wearing a peasant's cap and boots, and though he bowed\nvery humbly, Sergius still had the impressive appearance that made him\nso attractive. But Praskovya Mikhaylovna did not recognize him. She\ncould hardly do so, not having seen him for almost twenty years.\n\n'Don't think ill of me, Father. Perhaps you want something to eat?'\n\nHe took the bread and the money, and Praskovya Mikhaylovna was surprised\nthat he did not go, but stood looking at her.\n\n'Pashenka, I have come to you! Take me in...'\n\nHis beautiful black eyes, shining with the tears that started in them,\nwere fixed on her with imploring insistence. And under his greyish\nmoustache his lips quivered piteously.\n\nPraskovya Mikhaylovna pressed her hands to her withered breast, opened\nher mouth, and stood petrified, staring at the pilgrim with dilated\neyes.\n\n'It can't be! Stepa! Sergey! Father Sergius!'\n\n'Yes, it is I,' said Sergius in a low voice. 'Only not Sergius, or\nFather Sergius, but a great sinner, Stepan Kasatsky--a great and lost\nsinner. Take me in and help me!'\n\n'It's impossible! How have you so humbled yourself? But come in.'\n\nShe reached out her hand, but he did not take it and only followed her\nin.\n\nBut where was she to take him? The lodging was a small one. Formerly\nshe had had a tiny room, almost a closet, for herself, but later she had\ngiven it up to her daughter, and Masha was now sitting there rocking the\nbaby.\n\n'Sit here for the present,' she said to Sergius, pointing to a bench in\nthe kitchen.\n\nHe sat down at once, and with an evidently accustomed movement slipped\nthe straps of his wallet first off one shoulder and then off the other.\n\n'My God, my God! How you have humbled yourself, Father! Such great fame,\nand now like this...'\n\nSergius did not reply, but only smiled meekly, placing his wallet under\nthe bench on which he sat.\n\n'Masha, do you know who this is?'--And in a whisper Praskovya\nMikhaylovna told her daughter who he was, and together they then carried\nthe bed and the cradle out of the tiny room and cleared it for Sergius.\n\nPraskovya Mikhaylovna led him into it.\n\n'Here you can rest. Don't take offence... but I must go out.'\n\n'Where to?'\n\n'I have to go to a lesson. I am ashamed to tell you, but I teach music!'\n\n'Music? But that is good. Only just one thing, Praskovya Mikhaylovna,\nI have come to you with a definite object. When can I have a talk with\nyou?'\n\n'I shall be very glad. Will this evening do?'\n\n'Yes. But one thing more. Don't speak about me, or say who I am. I have\nrevealed myself only to you. No one knows where I have gone to. It must\nbe so.'\n\n'Oh, but I have told my daughter.'\n\n'Well, ask her not to mention it.'\n\nAnd Sergius took off his boots, lay down, and at once fell asleep after\na sleepless night and a walk of nearly thirty miles.\n\nWhen Praskovya Mikhaylovna returned, Sergius was sitting in the little\nroom waiting for her. He did not come out for dinner, but had some soup\nand gruel which Lukerya brought him.\n\n'How is it that you have come back earlier than you said?' asked\nSergius. 'Can I speak to you now?'\n\n'How is it that I have the happiness to receive such a guest? I have\nmissed one of my lessons. That can wait... I had always been planning\nto go to see you. I wrote to you, and now this good fortune has come.'\n\n'Pashenka, please listen to what I am going to tell you as to a\nconfession made to God at my last hour. Pashenka, I am not a holy man,\nI am not even as good as a simple ordinary man; I am a loathsome,\nvile, and proud sinner who has gone astray, and who, if not worse than\neveryone else, is at least worse than most very bad people.'\n\nPashenka looked at him at first with staring eyes. But she believed what\nhe said, and when she had quite grasped it she touched his hand, smiling\npityingly, and said:\n\n'Perhaps you exaggerate, Stiva?'\n\n'No, Pashenka. I am an adulterer, a murderer, a blasphemer, and a\ndeceiver.'\n\n'My God! How is that?' exclaimed Praskovya Mikhaylovna.\n\n'But I must go on living. And I, who thought I knew everything, who\ntaught others how to live--I know nothing and ask you to teach me.'\n\n'What are you saying, Stiva? You are laughing at me. Why do you always\nmake fun of me?'\n\n'Well, if you think I am jesting you must have it as you please. But\ntell me all the same how you live, and how you have lived your life.'\n\n'I? I have lived a very nasty, horrible life, and now God is punishing\nme as I deserve. I live so wretchedly, so wretchedly...'\n\n'How was it with your marriage? How did you live with your husband?'\n\n'It was all bad. I married because I fell in love in the nastiest way.\nPapa did not approve. But I would not listen to anything and just\ngot married. Then instead of helping my husband I tormented him by my\njealousy, which I could not restrain.'\n\n'I heard that he drank...'\n\n'Yes, but I did not give him any peace. I always reproached him, though\nyou know it is a disease! He could not refrain from it. I now remember\nhow I tried to prevent his having it, and the frightful scenes we had!'\n\nAnd she looked at Kasatsky with beautiful eyes, suffering from the\nremembrance.\n\nKasatsky remembered how he had been told that Pashenka's husband used\nto beat her, and now, looking at her thin withered neck with prominent\nveins behind her ears, and her scanty coil of hair, half grey half\nauburn, he seemed to see just how it had occurred.\n\n'Then I was left with two children and no means at all.'\n\n'But you had an estate!'\n\n'Oh, we sold that while Vasya was still alive, and the money was all\nspent. We had to live, and like all our young ladies I did not know how\nto earn anything. I was particularly useless and helpless. So we spent\nall we had. I taught the children and improved my own education a\nlittle. And then Mitya fell ill when he was already in the fourth\nform, and God took him. Masha fell in love with Vanya, my son-in-law.\nAnd--well, he is well-meaning but unfortunate. He is ill.'\n\n'Mamma!'--her daughter's voice interrupted her--'Take Mitya! I can't be\nin two places at once.'\n\nPraskovya Mikhaylovna shuddered, but rose and went out of the room,\nstepping quickly in her patched shoes. She soon came back with a boy of\ntwo in her arms, who threw himself backwards and grabbed at her shawl\nwith his little hands.\n\n'Where was I? Oh yes, he had a good appointment here, and his chief\nwas a kind man too. But Vanya could not go on, and had to give up his\nposition.'\n\n'What is the matter with him?'\n\n'Neurasthenia--it is a dreadful complaint. We consulted a doctor, who\ntold us he ought to go away, but we had no means.... I always hope it\nwill pass of itself. He has no particular pain, but...'\n\n'Lukerya!' cried an angry and feeble voice. 'She is always sent away\nwhen I want her. Mamma...'\n\n'I'm coming!' Praskovya Mikhaylovna again interrupted herself. 'He has\nnot had his dinner yet. He can't eat with us.'\n\nShe went out and arranged something, and came back wiping her thin dark\nhands.\n\n'So that is how I live. I always complain and am always dissatisfied,\nbut thank God the grandchildren are all nice and healthy, and we can\nstill live. But why talk about me?'\n\n'But what do you live on?'\n\n'Well, I earn a little. How I used to dislike music, but how useful it\nis to me now!' Her small hand lay on the chest of drawers beside which\nshe was sitting, and she drummed an exercise with her thin fingers.\n\n'How much do you get for a lesson?'\n\n'Sometimes a ruble, sometimes fifty kopeks, or sometimes thirty. They\nare all so kind to me.'\n\n'And do your pupils get on well?' asked Kasatsky with a slight smile.\n\nPraskovya Mikhaylovna did not at first believe that he was asking\nseriously, and looked inquiringly into his eyes.\n\n'Some of them do. One of them is a splendid girl--the butcher's\ndaughter--such a good kind girl! If I were a clever woman I ought, of\ncourse, with the connexions Papa had, to be able to get an appointment\nfor my son-in-law. But as it is I have not been able to do anything, and\nhave brought them all to this--as you see.'\n\n'Yes, yes,' said Kasatsky, lowering his head. 'And how is it,\nPashenka--do you take part in Church life?'\n\n'Oh, don't speak of it. I am so bad that way, and have neglected it so!\nI keep the fasts with the children and sometimes go to church, and then\nagain sometimes I don't go for months. I only send the children.'\n\n'But why don't you go yourself?'\n\n'To tell the truth' (she blushed) 'I am ashamed, for my daughter's\nsake and the children's, to go there in tattered clothes, and I haven't\nanything else. Besides, I am just lazy.'\n\n'And do you pray at home?'\n\n'I do. But what sort of prayer is it? Only mechanical. I know it should\nnot be like that, but I lack real religious feeling. The only thing is\nthat I know how bad I am...'\n\n'Yes, yes, that's right!' said Kasatsky, as if approvingly.\n\n'I'm coming! I'm coming!' she replied to a call from her son-in-law, and\ntidying her scanty plait she left the room.\n\nBut this time it was long before she returned. When she came back,\nKasatsky was sitting in the same position, his elbows resting on his\nknees and his head bowed. But his wallet was strapped on his back.\n\nWhen she came in, carrying a small tin lamp without a shade, he raised\nhis fine weary eyes and sighed very deeply.\n\n'I did not tell them who you are,' she began timidly. 'I only said that\nyou are a pilgrim, a nobleman, and that I used to know you. Come into\nthe dining-room for tea.'\n\n'No...'\n\n'Well then, I'll bring some to you here.'\n\n'No, I don't want anything. God bless you, Pashenka! I am going now. If\nyou pity me, don't tell anyone that you have seen me. For the love of\nGod don't tell anyone. Thank you. I would bow to your feet but I know\nit would make you feel awkward. Thank you, and forgive me for Christ's\nsake!'\n\n'Give me your blessing.'\n\n'God bless you! Forgive me for Christ's sake!'\n\nHe rose, but she would not let him go until she had given him bread and\nbutter and rusks. He took it all and went away.\n\nIt was dark, and before he had passed the second house he was lost to\nsight. She only knew he was there because the dog at the priest's house\nwas barking.\n\n'So that is what my dream meant! Pashenka is what I ought to have been\nbut failed to be. I lived for men on the pretext of living for God,\nwhile she lived for God imagining that she lives for men. Yes, one good\ndeed--a cup of water given without thought of reward--is worth more\nthan any benefit I imagined I was bestowing on people. But after all was\nthere not some share of sincere desire to serve God?' he asked himself,\nand the answer was: 'Yes, there was, but it was all soiled and overgrown\nby desire for human praise. Yes, there is no God for the man who lives,\nas I did, for human praise. I will now seek Him!'\n\nAnd he walked from village to village as he had done on his way to\nPashenka, meeting and parting from other pilgrims, men and women, and\nasking for bread and a night's rest in Christ's name. Occasionally some\nangry housewife scolded him, or a drunken peasant reviled him, but for\nthe most part he was given food and drink and even something to take\nwith him. His noble bearing disposed some people in his favour, while\nothers on the contrary seemed pleased at the sight of a gentleman who\nhad come to beggary.\n\nBut his gentleness prevailed with everyone.\n\nOften, finding a copy of the Gospels in a hut he would read it aloud,\nand when they heard him the people were always touched and surprised, as\nat something new yet familiar.\n\nWhen he succeeded in helping people, either by advice, or by his\nknowledge of reading and writing, or by settling some quarrel, he did\nnot wait to see their gratitude but went away directly afterwards. And\nlittle by little God began to reveal Himself within him.\n\nOnce he was walking along with two old women and a soldier. They were\nstopped by a party consisting of a lady and gentleman in a gig and\nanother lady and gentleman on horseback. The husband was on horseback\nwith his daughter, while in the gig his wife was driving with a\nFrenchman, evidently a traveller.\n\nThe party stopped to let the Frenchman see the pilgrims who, in accord\nwith a popular Russian superstition, tramped about from place to place\ninstead of working.\n\nThey spoke French, thinking that the others would not understand them.\n\n'Demandez-leur,' said the Frenchman, 's'ils sont bien sur de ce que leur\npelerinage est agreable a Dieu.'\n\nThe question was asked, and one old woman replied:\n\n'As God takes it. Our feet have reached the holy places, but our hearts\nmay not have done so.'\n\nThey asked the soldier. He said that he was alone in the world and had\nnowhere else to go.\n\nThey asked Kasatsky who he was.\n\n'A servant of God.'\n\n'Qu'est-ce qu'il dit? Il ne repond pas.'\n\n'Il dit qu'il est un serviteur de Dieu. Cela doit etre un fils de\npreetre. Il a de la race. Avez-vous de la petite monnaie?'\n\nThe Frenchman found some small change and gave twenty kopeks to each of\nthe pilgrims.\n\n'Mais dites-leur que ce n'est pas pour les cierges que je leur donne,\nmais pour qu'ils se regalent de the. Chay, chay pour vous, mon vieux!'\nhe said with a smile. And he patted Kasatsky on the shoulder with his\ngloved hand.\n\n'May Christ bless you,' replied Kasatsky without replacing his cap and\nbowing his bald head.\n\nHe rejoiced particularly at this meeting, because he had disregarded the\nopinion of men and had done the simplest, easiest thing--humbly accepted\ntwenty kopeks and given them to his comrade, a blind beggar. The less\nimportance he attached to the opinion of men the more did he feel the\npresence of God within him.\n\nFor eight months Kasatsky tramped on in this manner, and in the ninth\nmonth he was arrested for not having a passport. This happened at a\nnight-refuge in a provincial town where he had passed the night with\nsome pilgrims. He was taken to the police-station, and when asked who he\nwas and where was his passport, he replied that he had no passport and\nthat he was a servant of God. He was classed as a tramp, sentenced, and\nsent to live in Siberia.\n\nIn Siberia he has settled down as the hired man of a well-to-do peasant,\nin which capacity he works in the kitchen-garden, teaches children, and\nattends to the sick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Father Sergius, by Leo Tolstoy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FATHER SERGIUS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 985.txt or 985.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/9\/8\/985\/\n\nProduced by Judith Boss\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1041,"split":"train"}
