{"ori_id":"f6fbb458ad9ae228f23e0903109646020e249761","title":"Bliss (short story)","context":"Bliss (short story)\n The story follows a dinner party given by Bertha Young and her husband, Harry. The writing shows Bertha depicted as a happy soul, though quite naive about the world she lives in and those closest to her. The story opened up a lot of questions, about deceit, about knowing oneself and also about the possibility of homosexuality at the start of the 20th century. The story gives us a bird's eye view of the dinner party, which is attended by a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Knight, who are close friends to Bertha and Harry. Guest, Eddie Warren, is an effeminate character, who adds an interesting mix to the party. The only other guest, Pearl Fulton, is someone who Bertha is mysteriously drawn to for reasons unknown to her at the start. The interesting thing is that Bertha's husband is presented to the reader as Bertha perceives him in her mind. Because Bertha is so naive, the reader first gets the impression that Harry is a crude, disinterested person who has a strong dislike for Pearl by his conversational tone and curtness towards her as the conversation unfolds. As the dinner party progresses, Bertha questions her own interest and fascination towards Pearl. The fact that Eddie, who is most likely homosexual, is present, lends an air to the possibility that Bertha's interest in Pearl is more than a platonic feeling one has towards a friend of the same sex. It is only after Bertha analyzes her feelings towards Pearl that she realizes that the connection she feels with Pearl is their mutual attraction for Harry, and coming out of her \"blissful\" reverie she makes the discovery that Harry and Pearl are having an affair. The title to this story alludes to the sentiment that ignorance is bliss. The story leaves the question about whether it is best to live blissfully ignorant of the truth or live with the knowledge of a harsh reality.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Bliss, and Other Stories, by Katherine Mansfield\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

When\nPat swung them on top of the luggage they wobbled; the grandmother's\nlap was full and Linda Burnell could not possibly have held a lump of\na child on hers for any distance. Isabel, very superior, was perched\nbeside the new handy-man on the driver's seat. Hold-alls, bags and\nboxes were piled upon the floor. \"These are absolute necessities that\nI will not let out of my sight for one instant,\" said Linda Burnell,\nher voice trembling with fatigue and excitement.\n\nLottie and Kezia stood on the patch of lawn just inside the gate all\nready for the fray in their coats with brass anchor buttons and little\nround caps with battleship ribbons. Hand in hand, they stared with\nround solemn eyes first at the absolute necessities and then at their\nmother.\n\n\"We shall simply have to leave them. That is all. We shall simply have\nto cast them off,\" said Linda Burnell. A strange little laugh flew\nfrom her lips; she leaned back against the buttoned leather cushions\nand shut her eyes, her lips trembling with laughter. Happily at that\nmoment Mrs. Samuel Josephs, who had been watching the scene from\nbehind her drawing-room blind, waddled down the garden path.\n\n\"Why nod leave the chudren with be for the afterdoon, Brs. Burnell?\nThey could go on the dray with the storeban when he comes in the\neveding. Those thigs on the path have to go, dod't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, everything outside the house is supposed to go,\" said Linda\nBurnell, and she waved a white hand at the tables and chairs standing\non their heads on the front lawn. How absurd they looked! Either they\nought to be the other way up, or Lottie and Kezia ought to stand on\ntheir heads, too. And she longed to say: \"Stand on your heads,\nchildren, and wait for the store-man.\" It seemed to her that would be\nso exquisitely funny that she could not attend to Mrs. Samuel Josephs.\n\nThe fat creaking body leaned across the gate, and the big jelly of a\nface smiled. \"Dod't you worry, Brs. Burnell. Loddie and Kezia can have\ntea with by chudren in the dursery, and I'll see theb on the dray\nafterwards.\"\n\nThe grandmother considered. \"Yes, it really is quite the best plan. We\nare very obliged to you, Mrs. Samuel Josephs. Children, say 'thank\nyou' to Mrs. Samuel Josephs.\"\n\nTwo subdued chirrups: \"Thank you, Mrs. Samuel Josephs.\"\n\n\"And be good little girls, and--come closer--\" they advanced, \"don't\nforget to tell Mrs. Samuel Josephs when you want to. . . .\"\n\n\"No, granma.\"\n\n\"Dod't worry, Brs. Burnell.\"\n\nAt the last moment Kezia let go Lottie's hand and darted towards the\nbuggy.\n\n\"I want to kiss my granma good-bye again.\"\n\nBut she was too late. The buggy rolled off up the road, Isabel\nbursting with pride, her nose turned up at all the world, Linda\nBurnell prostrated, and the grandmother rummaging among the very\ncurious oddments she had had put in her black silk reticule at the\nlast moment, for something to give her daughter. The buggy twinkled\naway in the sunlight and fine golden dust up the hill and over. Kezia\nbit her lip, but Lottie, carefully finding her handkerchief first, set\nup a wail.\n\n\"Mother! Granma!\"\n\nMrs. Samuel Josephs, like a huge warm black silk tea cosy, enveloped\nher.\n\n\"It's all right, by dear. Be a brave child. You come and blay in the\ndursery!\"\n\nShe put her arm round weeping Lottie and led her away. Kezia followed,\nmaking a face at Mrs. Samuel Josephs' placket, which was undone as\nusual, with two long pink corset laces hanging out of it. . . .\n\nLottie's weeping died down as she mounted the stairs, but the sight of\nher at the nursery door with swollen eyes and a blob of a nose gave\ngreat satisfaction to the S. J.'s, who sat on two benches before a\nlong table covered with American cloth and set out with immense plates\nof bread and dripping and two brown jugs that faintly steamed.\n\n\"Hullo! You've been crying!\"\n\n\"Ooh! Your eyes have gone right in.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her nose look funny.\"\n\n\"You're all red-and-patchy.\"\n\nLottie was quite a success. She felt it and swelled, smiling timidly.\n\n\"Go and sit by Zaidee, ducky,\" said Mrs. Samuel Josephs, \"and Kezia,\nyou sid ad the end by Boses.\"\n\nMoses grinned and gave her a nip as she sat down; but she pretended\nnot to notice. She did hate boys.\n\n\"Which will you have?\" asked Stanley, leaning across the table very\npolitely, and smiling at her. \"Which will you have to begin\nwith--strawberries and cream or bread and dripping?\"\n\n\"Strawberries and cream, please,\" said she.\n\n\"Ah-h-h-h.\" How they all laughed and beat the table with their\nteaspoons. Wasn't that a take in! Wasn't it now! Didn't he fox her!\nGood old Stan!\n\n\"Ma! She thought it was real.\"\n\nEven Mrs. Samuel Josephs, pouring out the milk and water, could not\nhelp smiling. \"You bustn't tease theb on their last day,\" she wheezed.\n\nBut Kezia bit a big piece out of her bread and dripping, and then\nstood the piece up on her plate. With the bite out it made a dear\nlittle sort of a gate. Pooh! She didn't care! A tear rolled down her\ncheek, but she wasn't crying. She couldn't have cried in front of\nthose awful Samuel Josephs. She sat with her head bent, and as the\ntear dripped slowly down, she caught it with a neat little whisk of\nher tongue and ate it before any of them had seen.\n\n\n\n2\n\nAfter tea Kezia wandered back to their own house. Slowly she walked up\nthe back steps, and through the scullery into the kitchen. Nothing was\nleft in it but a lump of gritty yellow soap in one corner of the\nkitchen window sill and a piece of flannel stained with a blue bag in\nanother. The fireplace was choked up with rubbish. She poked among it\nbut found nothing except a hair-tidy with a heart painted on it that\nhad belonged to the servant girl. Even that she left lying, and she\ntrailed through the narrow passage into the drawing-room. The Venetian\nblind was pulled down but not drawn close. Long pencil rays of\nsunlight shone through and the wavy shadow of a bush outside danced on\nthe gold lines. Now it was still, now it began to flutter again, and\nnow it came almost as far as her feet. Zoom! Zoom! a blue-bottle\nknocked against the ceiling; the carpet-tacks had little bits of red\nfluff sticking to them.\n\nThe dining-room window had a square of coloured glass at each corner.\nOne was blue and one was yellow. Kezia bent down to have one more look\nat a blue lawn with blue arum lilies growing at the gate, and then at\na yellow lawn with yellow lilies and a yellow fence. As she looked a\nlittle Chinese Lottie came out on to the lawn and began to dust the\ntables and chairs with a corner of her pinafore. Was that really\nLottie? Kezia was not quite sure until she had looked through the\nordinary window.\n\nUpstairs in her father's and mother's room she found a pill box black\nand shiny outside and red in, holding a blob of cotton wool.\n\n\"I could keep a bird's egg in that,\" she decided.\n\nIn the servant girl's room there was a stay-button stuck in a crack of\nthe floor, and in another crack some beads and a long needle. She knew\nthere was nothing in her grandmother's room; she had watched her pack.\nShe went over to the window and leaned against it, pressing her hands\nagainst the pane.\n\nKezia liked to stand so before the window. She liked the feeling of\nthe cold shining glass against her hot palms, and she liked to watch\nthe funny white tops that came on her fingers when she pressed them\nhard against the pane. As she stood there, the day flickered out and\ndark came. With the dark crept the wind snuffling and howling. The\nwindows of the empty house shook, a creaking came from the walls and\nfloors, a piece of loose iron on the roof banged forlornly. Kezia was\nsuddenly quite, quite still, with wide open eyes and knees pressed\ntogether. She was frightened. She wanted to call Lottie and to go on\ncalling all the while she ran downstairs and out of the house. But IT\nwas just behind her, waiting at the door, at the head of the stairs,\nat the bottom of the stairs, hiding in the passage, ready to dart out\nat the back door. But Lottie was at the back door, too.\n\n\"Kezia!\" she called cheerfully. \"The storeman's here. Everything is on\nthe dray and three horses, Kezia. Mrs. Samuel Josephs has given us a\nbig shawl to wear round us, and she says to button up your coat. She\nwon't come out because of asthma.\"\n\nLottie was very important.\n\n\"Now then, you kids,\" called the storeman. He hooked his big thumbs\nunder their arms and up they swung. Lottie arranged the shawl \"most\nbeautifully\" and the storeman tucked up their feet in a piece of old\nblanket.\n\n\"Lift up. Easy does it.\"\n\nThey might have been a couple of young ponies. The storeman felt over\nthe cords holding his load, unhooked the brakechain from the wheel,\nand whistling, he swung up beside them.\n\n\"Keep close to me,\" said Lottie, \"because otherwise you pull the shawl\naway from my side, Kezia.\"\n\nBut Kezia edged up to the storeman. He towered beside her big as a\ngiant and he smelled of nuts and new wooden boxes.\n\n\n\n3\n\nIt was the first time that Lottie and Kezia had ever been out so late.\nEverything looked different--the painted wooden houses far smaller\nthan they did by day, the gardens far bigger and wilder. Bright stars\nspeckled the sky and the moon hung over the harbour dabbling the waves\nwith gold. They could see the lighthouse shining on Quarantine Island,\nand the green lights on the old coal hulks.\n\n\"There comes the Picton boat,\" said the storeman, pointing to a little\nsteamer all hung with bright beads.\n\nBut when they reached the top of the hill and began to go down the\nother side the harbour disappeared, and although they were still in\nthe town they were quite lost. Other carts rattled past. Everybody\nknew the storeman.\n\n\"Night, Fred.\"\n\n\"Night O,\" he shouted.\n\nKezia liked very much to hear him. Whenever a cart appeared in the\ndistance she looked up and waited for his voice. He was an old friend;\nand she and her grandmother had often been to his place to buy grapes.\nThe storeman lived alone in a cottage that had a glasshouse against\none wall built by himself. All the glasshouse was spanned and arched\nover with one beautiful vine. He took her brown basket from her, lined\nit with three large leaves, and then he felt in his belt for a little\nhorn knife, reached up and snapped off a big blue cluster and laid it\non the leaves so tenderly that Kezia held her breath to watch. He was\na very big man. He wore brown velvet trousers, and he had a long brown\nbeard. But he never wore a collar, not even on Sunday. The back of his\nneck was burnt bright red.\n\n\"Where are we now?\" Every few minutes one of the children asked him\nthe question.\n\n\"Why, this is Hawk Street, or Charlotte Crescent.\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" Lottie pricked up her ears at the last name; she\nalways felt that Charlotte Crescent belonged specially to her. Very\nfew people had streets with the same name as theirs.\n\n\"Look, Kezia, there is Charlotte Crescent. Doesn't it look different?\"\nNow everything familiar was left behind. Now the big dray rattled into\nunknown country, along new roads with high clay banks on either side,\nup steep, steep hills, down into bushy valleys, through wide shallow\nrivers. Further and further. Lottie's head wagged; she drooped, she\nslipped half into Kezia's lap and lay there. But Kezia could not open\nher eyes wide enough. The wind blew and she shivered; but her cheeks\nand ears burned.\n\n\"Do stars ever blow about?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not to notice,\" said the storeman.\n\n\"We've got a nuncle and a naunt living near our new house,\" said\nKezia. \"They have got two children, Pip, the eldest is called, and the\nyoungest's name is Rags. He's got a ram. He has to feed it with a\nnenamuel teapot and a glove top over the spout. He's going to show us.\nWhat is the difference between a ram and a sheep?\"\n\n\"Well, a ram has horns and runs for you.\"\n\nKezia considered. \"I don't want to see it frightfully,\" she said. \"I\nhate rushing animals like dogs and parrots. I often dream that animals\nrush at me--even camels--and while they are rushing, their heads swell\ne-enormous.\"\n\nThe storeman said nothing. Kezia peered up at him, screwing up her\neyes. Then she put her finger out and stroked his sleeve; it felt\nhairy. \"Are we near?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not far off, now,\" answered the storeman. \"Getting tired?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not an atom bit sleepy,\" said Kezia. \"But my eyes keep\ncurling up in such a funny sort of way.\" She gave a long sigh, and to\nstop her eyes from curling she shut them. . . . When she opened them\nagain they were clanking through a drive that cut through the garden\nlike a whip lash, looping suddenly an island of green, and behind the\nisland, but out of sight until you came upon it, was the house. It was\nlong and low built, with a pillared verandah and balcony all the way\nround. The soft white bulk of it lay stretched upon the green garden\nlike a sleeping beast. And now one and now another of the windows\nleaped into light. Someone was walking through the empty rooms\ncarrying a lamp. From a window downstairs the light of a fire\nflickered. A strange beautiful excitement seemed to stream from the\nhouse in quivering ripples.\n\n\"Where are we?\" said Lottie, sitting up. Her reefer cap was all on one\nside and on her cheek there was the print of an anchor button she had\npressed against while sleeping. Tenderly the storeman lifted her, set\nher cap straight, and pulled down her crumpled clothes. She stood\nblinking on the lowest verandah step watching Kezia who seemed to come\nflying through the air to her feet.\n\n\"Ooh!\" cried Kezia, flinging up her arms. The grandmother came out of\nthe dark hall carrying a little lamp. She was smiling.\n\n\"You found your way in the dark?\" said she.\n\n\"Perfectly well.\"\n\nBut Lottie staggered on the lowest verandah step like a bird fallen\nout of the nest. If she stood still for a moment she fell asleep, if\nshe leaned against anything her eyes closed. She could not walk\nanother step.\n\n\"Kezia,\" said the grandmother, \"can I trust you to carry the lamp?\"\n\n\"Yes, my granma.\"\n\nThe old woman bent down and gave the bright breathing thing into her\nhands and then she caught up drunken Lottie. \"This way.\"\n\nThrough a square hall filled with bales and hundreds of parrots (but\nthe parrots were only on the wall-paper) down a narrow passage where\nthe parrots persisted in flying past Kezia with her lamp.\n\n\"Be very quiet,\" warned the grandmother, putting down Lottie and\nopening the dining-room door. \"Poor little mother has got such a\nheadache.\"\n\nLinda Burnell, in a long cane chair, with her feet on a hassock, and a\nplaid over her knees, lay before a crackling fire. Burnell and Beryl\nsat at the table in the middle of the room eating a dish of fried\nchops and drinking tea out of a brown china teapot. Over the back of\nher mother's chair leaned Isabel. She had a comb in her fingers and in\na gentle absorbed fashion she was combing the curls from her mother's\nforehead. Outside the pool of lamp and firelight the room stretched\ndark and bare to the hollow windows.\n\n\"Are those the children?\" But Linda did not really care; she did not\neven open her eyes to see.\n\n\"Put down the lamp, Kezia,\" said Aunt Beryl, \"or we shall have the\nhouse on fire before we are out of the packing cases. More tea,\nStanley?\"\n\n\"Well, you might just give me five-eighths of a cup,\" said Burnell,\nleaning across the table. \"Have another chop, Beryl. Tip-top meat,\nisn't it? Not too lean and not too fat.\" He turned to his wife.\n\"You're sure you won't change your mind, Linda darling?\"\n\n\"The very thought of it is enough.\" She raised one eyebrow in the way\nshe had. The grandmother brought the children bread and milk and they\nsat up to table, flushed and sleepy behind the wavy steam.\n\n\"I had meat for my supper,\" said Isabel, still combing gently.\n\n\"I had a whole chop for my supper, the bone and all and Worcester\nsauce. Didn't I, father?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't boast, Isabel,\" said Aunt Beryl.\n\nIsabel looked astounded. \"I wasn't boasting, was I, Mummy? I never\nthought of boasting. I thought they would like to know. I only meant\nto tell them.\"\n\n\"Very well. That's enough,\" said Burnell. He pushed back his plate,\ntook a tooth-pick out of his pocket and began picking his strong white\nteeth.\n\n\"You might see that Fred has a bite of something in the kitchen before\nhe goes, will you, mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, Stanley.\" The old woman turned to go.\n\n\"Oh, hold on half a jiffy. I suppose nobody knows where my slippers\nwere put? I suppose I shall not be able to get at them for a month or\ntwo--what?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" came from Linda. \"In the top of the canvas hold-all marked\n'urgent necessities.'\"\n\n\"Well you might get them for me will you, mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, Stanley.\"\n\nBurnell got up, stretched himself, and going over to the fire he\nturned his back to it and lifted up his coat tails.\n\n\"By Jove, this is a pretty pickle. Eh, Beryl?\"\n\nBeryl, sipping tea, her elbows on the table, smiled over the cup at\nhim. She wore an unfamiliar pink pinafore; the sleeves of her blouse\nwere rolled up to her shoulders showing her lovely freckled arms, and\nshe had let her hair fall down her back in a long pig-tail.\n\n\"How long do you think it will take to get straight--couple of\nweeks--eh?\" he chaffed.\n\n\"Good heavens, no,\" said Beryl airily. \"The worst is over already. The\nservant girl and I have simply slaved all day, and ever since mother\ncame she has worked like a horse, too. We have never sat down for a\nmoment. We have had a day.\"\n\nStanley scented a rebuke.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you did not expect me to rush away from the office\nand nail carpets--did you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" laughed Beryl. She put down her cup and ran out of\nthe dining-room.\n\n\"What the hell does she expect us to do?\" asked Stanley. \"Sit down and\nfan herself with a palm leaf fan while I have a gang of professionals\nto do the job? By Jove, if she can't do a hand's turn occasionally\nwithout shouting about it in return for . . .\"\n\nAnd he gloomed as the chops began to fight the tea in his sensitive\nstomach. But Linda put up a hand and dragged him down to the side of\nher long chair.\n\n\"This is a wretched time for you, old boy,\" she said. Her cheeks were\nvery white but she smiled and curled her fingers into the big red hand\nshe held. Burnell became quiet. Suddenly he began to whistle \"Pure as\na lily, joyous and free\"--a good sign.\n\n\"Think you're going to like it?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't want to tell you, but I think I ought to, mother,\" said\nIsabel. \"Kezia is drinking tea out of Aunt Beryl's cup.\"\n\n\n\n4\n\nThey were taken off to bed by the grandmother. She went first with a\ncandle; the stairs rang to their climbing feet. Isabel and Lottie lay\nin a room to themselves, Kezia curled in her grandmother's soft bed.\n\n\"Aren't there going to be any sheets, my granma?\"\n\n\"No, not to-night.\"\n\n\"It's tickly,\" said Kezia, \"but it's like Indians.\" She dragged her\ngrandmother down to her and kissed her under the chin. \"Come to bed\nsoon and be my Indian brave.\"\n\n\"What a silly you are,\" said the old woman, tucking her in as she\nloved to be tucked.\n\n\"Aren't you going to leave me a candle?\"\n\n\"No. Sh--h. Go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well, can I have the door left open?\"\n\nShe rolled herself up into a round but she did not go to sleep. From\nall over the house came the sound of steps. The house itself creaked\nand popped. Loud whispering voices came from downstairs. Once she\nheard Aunt Beryl's rush of high laughter, and once she heard a loud\ntrumpeting from Burnell blowing his nose. Outside the window hundreds\nof black cats with yellow eyes sat in the sky watching her--but she\nwas not frightened. Lottie was saying to Isabel:\n\n\"I'm going to say my prayers in bed to-night.\"\n\n\"No you can't, Lottie.\" Isabel was very firm. \"God only excuses you\nsaying your prayers in bed if you've got a temperature.\" So Lottie\nyielded:\n\n  Gentle Jesus meek anmile,\n  Look pon a little chile.\n  Pity me, simple Lizzie\n  Suffer me to come to thee.\n\nAnd then they lay down back to back, their little behinds just\ntouching, and fell asleep.\n\n\n\nStanding in a pool of moonlight Beryl Fairfield undressed herself. She\nwas tired, but she pretended to be more tired than she really\nwas--letting her clothes fall, pushing back with a languid gesture her\nwarm, heavy hair.\n\n\"Oh, how tired I am--very tired.\"\n\nShe shut her eyes a moment, but her lips smiled. Her breath rose and\nfell in her breast like two fanning wings. The window was wide open;\nit was warm, and somewhere out there in the garden a young man, dark\nand slender, with mocking eyes, tip-toed among the bushes, and\ngathered the flowers into a big bouquet, and shipped under her window\nand held it up to her. She saw herself bending forward. He thrust his\nhead among the bright waxy flowers, sly and laughing. \"No, no,\" said\nBeryl. She turned from the window and dropped her nightgown over her\nhead.\n\n\"How frightfully unreasonable Stanley is sometimes,\" she thought,\nbuttoning. And then, as she lay down, there came the old thought, the\ncruel thought--ah, if only she had money of her own.\n\nA young man, immensely rich, has just arrived from England. He meets\nher quite by chance. . . . The new governor is unmarried. . . . There\nis a ball at Government house. . . . Who is that exquisite creature in\n_eau de nil_ satin? Beryl Fairfield. . . .\n\n\n\n\"The thing that pleases me,\" said Stanley, leaning against the side of\nthe bed and giving himself a good scratch on his shoulders and back\nbefore turning in, \"is that I've got the place dirt cheap, Linda. I\nwas talking about it to little Wally Bell to-day and he said he simply\ncould not understand why they had accepted my figure. You see land\nabout here is bound to become more and more valuable . . . in about\nten years' time . . . of course we shall have to go very slow and cut\ndown expenses as fine as possible. Not asleep--are you?\"\n\n\"No, dear, I've heard every word,\" said Linda.\n\nHe sprang into bed, leaned over her and blew out the candle.\n\n\"Good night, Mr. Business Man,\" said she, and she took hold of his\nhead by the ears and gave him a quick kiss. Her faint far-away voice\nseemed to come from a deep well.\n\n\"Good night, darling.\" He slipped his arm under her neck and drew her\nto him.\n\n\"Yes, clasp me,\" said the faint voice from the deep well.\n\n\n\nPat the handy man sprawled in his little room behind the kitchen. His\nsponge-bag coat and trousers hung from the door-peg like a hanged man.\nFrom the edge of the blanket his twisted toes protruded, and on the\nfloor beside him there was an empty cane bird-cage. He looked like a\ncomic picture.\n\n\"Honk, honk,\" came from the servant girl. She had adenoids.\n\nLast to go to bed was the grandmother.\n\n\"What. Not asleep yet?\"\n\n\"No, I'm waiting for you,\" said Kezia. The old woman sighed and lay\ndown beside her. Kezia thrust her head under the grandmother's arm and\ngave a little squeak. But the old woman only pressed her faintly, and\nsighed again, took out her teeth, and put them in a glass of water\nbeside her on the floor.\n\nIn the garden some tiny owls, perched on the branches of a lace-bark\ntree, called: \"More pork; more pork.\" And far away in the bush there\nsounded a harsh rapid chatter: \"Ha-ha-ha . . . Ha-ha-ha.\"\n\n\n\n5\n\nDawn came sharp and chill with red clouds on a faint green sky and\ndrops of water on every leaf and blade. A breeze blew over the garden,\ndropping dew and dropping petals, shivered over the drenched paddocks,\nand was lost in the sombre bush. In the sky some tiny stars floated\nfor a moment and then they were gone--they were dissolved like\nbubbles. And plain to be heard in the early quiet was the sound of the\ncreek in the paddock running over the brown stones, running in and out\nof the sandy hollows, hiding under clumps of dark berry bushes,\nspilling into a swamp of yellow water flowers and cresses.\n\nAnd then at the first beam of sun the birds began. Big cheeky birds,\nstarlings and mynahs, whistled on the lawns, the little birds, the\ngoldfinches and linnets and fan-tails flicked from bough to bough. A\nlovely kingfisher perched on the paddock fence preening his rich\nbeauty, and a _tui_ sang his three notes and laughed and sang them\nagain.\n\n\"How loud the birds are,\" said Linda in her dream. She was walking\nwith her father through a green paddock sprinkled with daisies.\nSuddenly he bent down and parted the grasses and showed her a tiny\nball of fluff just at her feet. \"Oh, Papa, the darling.\" She made a\ncup of her hands and caught the tiny bird and stroked its head with\nher finger. It was quite tame. But a funny thing happened. As she\nstroked it began to swell, it ruffled and pouched, it grew bigger and\nbigger and its round eyes seemed to smile knowingly at her. Now her\narms were hardly wide enough to hold it and she dropped it into her\napron. It had become a baby with a big naked head and a gaping\nbird-mouth, opening and shutting. Her father broke into a loud\nclattering laugh and she woke to see Burnell standing by the windows\nrattling the Venetian blind up to the very top.\n\n\"Hullo,\" he said. \"Didn't wake you, did I? Nothing much wrong with the\nweather this morning.\"\n\nHe was enormously pleased. Weather like this set a final seal on his\nbargain. He felt, somehow, that he had bought the lovely day, too--got\nit chucked in dirt cheap with the house and ground. He dashed off to\nhis bath and Linda turned over and raised herself on one elbow to see\nthe room by daylight. All the furniture had found a place--all the old\nparaphernalia--as she expressed it. Even the photographs were on the\nmantelpiece and the medicine bottles on the shelf above the\nwash-stand. Her clothes lay across a chair--her outdoor things, a\npurple cape and a round hat with a plume in it. Looking at them she\nwished that she was going away from this house, too. And she saw\nherself driving away from them all in a little buggy, driving away\nfrom everybody and not even waving.\n\nBack came Stanley girt with a towel, glowing and slapping his thighs.\nHe pitched the wet towel on top of her hat and cape, and standing firm\nin the exact centre of a square of sunlight he began to do his\nexercises. Deep breathing, bending and squatting like a frog and\nshooting out his legs. He was so delighted with his firm, obedient\nbody that he hit himself on the chest and gave a loud \"Ah.\" But this\namazing vigour seemed to set him worlds away from Linda. She lay on\nthe white tumbled bed and watched him as if from the clouds.\n\n\"Oh, damn! Oh, blast!\" said Stanley, who had butted into a crisp white\nshirt only to find that some idiot had fastened the neck-band and he\nwas caught. He stalked over to Linda waving his arms.\n\n\"You look like a big fat turkey,\" said she.\n\n\"Fat. I like that,\" said Stanley. \"I haven't a square inch of fat on\nme. Feel that.\"\n\n\"It's rock--it's iron,\" mocked she.\n\n\"You'd be surprised,\" said Stanley, as though this were intensely\ninteresting, \"at the number of chaps at the club who have got a\ncorporation. Young chaps, you know--men of my age.\" He began parting\nhis bushy ginger hair, his blue eyes fixed and round in the glass, his\nknees bent, because the dressing table was always--confound it--a bit\ntoo low for him. \"Little Wally Bell, for instance,\" and he\nstraightened, describing upon himself an enormous curve with the\nhairbrush. \"I must say I've a perfect horror . . .\"\n\n\"My dear, don't worry. You'll never be fat. You are far too\nenergetic.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I suppose that's true,\" said he, comforted for the\nhundredth time, and taking a pearl pen-knife out of his pocket he\nbegan to pare his nails.\n\n\"Breakfast, Stanley.\" Beryl was at the door. \"Oh, Linda, mother says\nyou are not to get up yet.\" She popped her head in at the door. She\nhad a big piece of syringa stuck through her hair.\n\n\"Everything we left on the verandah last night is simply sopping this\nmorning. You should see poor dear mother wringing out the tables and\nthe chairs. However, there is no harm done----\" this with the faintest\nglance at Stanley.\n\n\"Have you told Pat to have the buggy round in time? It's a good six\nand a half miles to the office.\"\n\n\"I can imagine what this early start for the office will be like,\"\nthought Linda. \"It will be very high pressure indeed.\"\n\n\"Pat, Pat.\" She heard the servant girl calling. But Pat was evidently\nhard to find; the silly voice went baa--baaing through the garden.\n\nLinda did not rest again until the final slam of the front door told\nher that Stanley was really gone.\n\nLater she heard her children playing in the garden. Lottie's stolid,\ncompact little voice cried: \"Ke--zia. Isa--bel.\" She was always\ngetting lost or losing people only to find them again, to her great\nsurprise, round the next tree or the next corner. \"Oh, there you are\nafter all.\" They had been turned out after breakfast and told not to\ncome back to the house until they were called. Isabel wheeled a neat\npramload of prim dolls and Lottie was allowed for a great treat to\nwalk beside her holding the doll's parasol over the face of the wax\none.\n\n\"Where are you going to, Kezia?\" asked Isabel, who longed to find some\nlight and menial duty that Kezia might perform and so be roped in\nunder her government.\n\n\"Oh, just away,\" said Kezia. . . .\n\nThen she did not hear them any more. What a glare there was in the\nroom. She hated blinds pulled up to the top at any time, but in the\nmorning it was intolerable. She turned over to the wall and idly, with\none finger, she traced a poppy on the wall-paper with a leaf and a\nstem and a fat bursting bud. In the quiet, and under her tracing\nfinger, the poppy seemed to come alive. She could feel the sticky,\nsilky petals, the stem, hairy like a gooseberry skin, the rough leaf\nand the tight glazed bud. Things had a habit of coming alive like\nthat. Not only large substantial things like furniture, but curtains\nand the patterns of stuffs and the fringes of quilts and cushions. How\noften she had seen the tassel fringe of her quilt change into a funny\nprocession of dancers with priests attending. . . . For there were\nsome tassels that did not dance at all but walked stately, bent\nforward as if praying or chanting. How often the medicine bottles had\nturned into a row of little men with brown top-hats on; and the\nwashstand jug had a way of sitting in the basin like a fat bird in a\nround nest.\n\n\"I dreamed about birds last night,\" thought Linda. What was it? She\nhad forgotten. But the strangest part of this coming alive of things\nwas what they did. They listened, they seemed to swell out with some\nmysterious important content, and when they were full she felt that\nthey smiled. But it was not for her, only, their sly secret smile;\nthey were members of a secret society and they smiled among\nthemselves. Sometimes, when she had fallen asleep in the daytime, she\nwoke and could not lift a finger, could not even turn her eyes to left\nor right because THEY were there; sometimes when she went out of a\nroom and left it empty, she knew as she clicked the door to that THEY\nwere filling it. And there were times in the evenings when she was\nupstairs, perhaps, and everybody else was down, when she could hardly\nescape from them. Then she could not hurry, she could not hum a tune;\nif she tried to say ever so carelessly--\"Bother that old\nthimble\"--THEY were not deceived. THEY knew how frightened she was;\nTHEY saw how she turned her head away as she passed the mirror. What\nLinda always felt was that THEY wanted something of her, and she knew\nthat if she gave herself up and was quiet, more than quiet, silent,\nmotionless, something would really happen.\n\n\"It's very quiet now,\" she thought. She opened her eyes wide, and she\nheard the silence spinning its soft endless web. How lightly she\nbreathed; she scarcely had to breathe at all.\n\nYes, everything had come alive down to the minutest, tiniest particle,\nand she did not feel her bed, she floated, held up in the air. Only\nshe seemed to be listening with her wide open watchful eyes, waiting\nfor someone to come who just did not come, watching for something to\nhappen that just did not happen.\n\n\n\n6\n\nIn the kitchen at the long deal table under the two windows old Mrs.\nFairfield was washing the breakfast dishes. The kitchen window looked\nout on to a big grass patch that led down to the vegetable garden and\nthe rhubarb beds. On one side the grass patch was bordered by the\nscullery and wash-house and over this whitewashed lean-to there grew a\nknotted vine. She had noticed yesterday that a few tiny corkscrew\ntendrils had come right through some cracks in the scullery ceiling\nand all the windows of the lean-to had a thick frill of ruffled green.\n\n\"I am very fond of a grape vine,\" declared Mrs. Fairfield, \"but I do\nnot think that the grapes will ripen here. It takes Australian sun.\"\nAnd she remembered how Beryl when she was a baby had been picking some\nwhite grapes from the vine on the back verandah of their Tasmanian\nhouse and she had been stung on the leg by a huge red ant. She saw\nBeryl in a little plaid dress with red ribbon tie-ups on the shoulders\nscreaming so dreadfully that half the street rushed in. And how the\nchild's leg had swelled! \"T--t--t--t!\" Mrs. Fairfield caught her\nbreath remembering. \"Poor child, how terrifying it was.\" And she set\nher lips tight and went over to the stove for some more hot water. The\nwater frothed up in the big soapy bowl with pink and blue bubbles on\ntop of the foam. Old Mrs. Fairfield's arms were bare to the elbow and\nstained a bright pink. She wore a grey foulard dress patterned with\nlarge purple pansies, a white linen apron and a high cap shaped like a\njelly mould of white muslin. At her throat there was a silver crescent\nmoon with five little owls seated on it, and round her neck she wore a\nwatch guard made of black beads.\n\nIt was hard to believe that she had not been in that kitchen for\nyears; she was so much a part of it. She put the crocks away with a\nsure, precise touch, moving leisurely and ample from the stove to the\ndresser, looking into the pantry and the larder as though there were\nnot an unfamiliar comer. When she had finished, everything in the\nkitchen had become part of a series of patterns. She stood in the\nmiddle of the room wiping her hands on a check cloth; a smile beamed\non her lips; she thought it looked very nice, very satisfactory.\n\n\"Mother! Mother! Are you there?\" called Beryl.\n\n\"Yes, dear. Do you want me?\"\n\n\"No. I'm coming,\" and Beryl rushed in, very flushed, dragging with her\ntwo big pictures.\n\n\"Mother, whatever can I do with these awful hideous Chinese paintings\nthat Chung Wah gave Stanley when he went bankrupt? It's absurd to say\nthat they are valuable, because they were hanging in Chung Wah's fruit\nshop for months before. I can't make out why Stanley wants them kept.\nI'm sure he thinks them just as hideous as we do, but it's because of\nthe frames,\" she said spitefully. \"I suppose he thinks the frames\nmight fetch something some day or other.\"\n\n\"Why don't you hang them in the passage?\" suggested Mrs. Fairfield;\n\"they would not be much seen there.\"\n\n\"I can't. There is no room. I've hung all the photographs of his\noffice there before and after building, and the signed photos of his\nbusiness friends, and that awful enlargement of Isabel lying on the\nmat in her singlet.\" Her angry glance swept the placid kitchen. \"I\nknow what I'll do. I'll hang them here. I will tell Stanley they got a\nlittle damp in the moving so I have put them in here for the time\nbeing.\"\n\nShe dragged a chair forward, jumped on it, took a hammer and a big\nnail out of her pinafore pocket and banged away.\n\n\"There! That is enough! Hand me the picture, mother.\"\n\n\"One moment, child.\" Her mother was wiping over the carved ebony\nframe.\n\n\"Oh, mother, really you need not dust them. It would take years to\ndust all those little holes.\" And she frowned at the top of her\nmother's head and bit her lip with impatience. Mother's deliberate way\nof doing things was simply maddening. It was old age, she supposed,\nloftily.\n\nAt last the two pictures were hung side by side. She jumped off the\nchair, stowing away the little hammer.\n\n\"They don't look so bad there, do they?\" said she. \"And at any rate\nnobody need gaze at them except Pat and the servant girl--have I got a\nspider's web on my face, mother? I've been poking into that cupboard\nunder the stairs and now something keeps tickling my nose.\"\n\nBut before Mrs. Fairfield had time to look Beryl had turned away.\nSomeone tapped on the window: Linda was there, nodding and smiling.\nThey heard the latch of the scullery door lift and she came in. She\nhad no hat on; her hair stood up on her head in curling rings and she\nwas wrapped up in an old cashmere shawl.\n\n\"I'm so hungry,\" said Linda: \"where can I get something to eat,\nmother? This is the first time I've been in the kitchen. It says\n'mother' all over; everything is in pairs.\"\n\n\"I will make you some tea,\" said Mrs. Fairfield, spreading a clean\nnapkin over a corner of the table, \"and Beryl can have a cup with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Beryl, do you want half my gingerbread?\" Linda waved the knife at\nher. \"Beryl, do you like the house now that we are here?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I like the house immensely and the garden is beautiful, but\nit feels very far away from everything to me. I can't imagine people\ncoming out from town to see us in that dreadful jolting bus, and I am\nsure there is not anyone here to come and call. Of course it does not\nmatter to you because----\"\n\n\"But there's the buggy,\" said Linda. \"Pat can drive you into town\nwhenever you like.\"\n\nThat was a consolation, certainly, but there was something at the back\nof Beryl's mind, something she did not even put into words for\nherself.\n\n\"Oh, well, at any rate it won't kill us,\" she said dryly, putting down\nher empty cup and standing up and stretching. \"I am going to hang\ncurtains.\" And she ran away singing:\n\n  How many thousand birds I see\n  That sing aloud from every tree . . .\n\n\". . . birds I see That sing aloud from every tree. . . .\" But when\nshe reached the dining-room she stopped singing, her face changed; it\nbecame gloomy and sullen.\n\n\"One may as well rot here as anywhere else,\" she muttered savagely,\ndigging the stiff brass safety-pins into the red serge curtains.\n\nThe two left in the kitchen were quiet for a little. Linda leaned her\ncheek on her fingers and watched her mother. She thought her mother\nlooked wonderfully beautiful with her back to the leafy window. There\nwas something comforting in the sight of her that Linda felt she could\nnever do without. She needed the sweet smell of her flesh, and the\nsoft feel of her cheeks and her arms and shoulders still softer. She\nloved the way her hair curled, silver at her forehead, lighter at her\nneck, and bright brown still in the big coil under the muslin cap.\nExquisite were her mother's hands, and the two rings she wore seemed\nto melt into her creamy skin. And she was always so fresh, so\ndelicious. The old woman could bear nothing but linen next to her body\nand she bathed in cold water winter and summer.\n\n\"Isn't there anything for me to do?\" asked Linda.\n\n\"No, darling. I wish you would go into the garden and give an eye to\nyour children; but that I know you will not do.\"\n\n\"Of course I will, but you know Isabel is much more grown up than any\nof us.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Kezia is not,\" said Mrs. Fairfield.\n\n\"Oh, Kezia has been tossed by a bull hours ago,\" said Linda, winding\nherself up in her shawl again.\n\nBut no, Kezia had seen a bull through a hole in a knot of wood in the\npaling that separated the tennis lawn from the paddock. But she had\nnot liked the bull frightfully, so she had walked away back through\nthe orchard, up the grassy slope, along the path by the lace bark tree\nand so into the spread tangled garden. She did not believe that she\nwould ever not get lost in this garden. Twice she had found her way\nback to the big iron gates they had driven through the night before,\nand then had turned to walk up the drive that led to the house, but\nthere were so many little paths on either side. On one side they all\nled into a tangle of tall dark trees and strange bushes with flat\nvelvet leaves and feathery cream flowers that buzzed with flies when\nyou shook them--this was the frightening side, and no garden at all.\nThe little paths here were wet and clayey with tree roots spanned\nacross them like the marks of big fowls' feet.\n\nBut on the other side of the drive there was a high box border and the\npaths had box edges and all of them led into a deeper and deeper\ntangle of flowers. The camellias were in bloom, white and crimson and\npink and white striped with flashing leaves. You could not see a leaf\non the syringa bushes for the white clusters. The roses were in\nflower--gentlemen's button-hole roses, little white ones, but far too\nfull of insects to hold under anyone's nose, pink monthly roses with a\nring of fallen petals round the bushes, cabbage roses on thick stalks,\nmoss roses, always in bud, pink smooth beauties opening curl on curl,\nred ones so dark they seemed to turn black as they fell, and a certain\nexquisite cream kind with a slender red stem and bright scarlet\nleaves.\n\nThere were clumps of fairy bells, and all kinds of geraniums, and\nthere were little trees of verbena and bluish lavender bushes and a\nbed of pelagoniums with velvet eyes and leaves like moths' wings.\nThere was a bed of nothing but mignonette and another of nothing but\npansies--borders of double and single daisies and all kinds of little\ntufty plants she had never seen before.\n\nThe red-hot pokers were taller than she; the Japanese sunflowers grew\nin a tiny jungle. She sat down on one of the box borders. By pressing\nhard at first it made a nice seat. But how dusty it was inside! Kezia\nbent down to look and sneezed and rubbed her nose.\n\nAnd then she found herself at the top of the rolling grassy slope that\nled down to the orchard. . . . She looked down at the slope a moment;\nthen she lay down on her back, gave a squeak and rolled over and over\ninto the thick flowery orchard grass. As she lay waiting for things to\nstop spinning, she decided to go up to the house and ask the servant\ngirl for an empty match-box. She wanted to make a surprise for the\ngrandmother. . . . First she would put a leaf inside with a big violet\nlying on it, then she would put a very small white picotee, perhaps,\non each side of the violet, and then she would sprinkle some lavender\non the top, but not to cover their heads.\n\nShe often made these surprises for the grandmother, and they were\nalways most successful.\n\n\"Do you want a match, my granny?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, child, I believe a match is just what I'm looking for.\"\n\nThe grandmother slowly opened the box and came upon the picture\ninside.\n\n\"Good gracious, child! How you astonished me!\"\n\n\"I can make her one every day here,\" she thought, scrambling up the\ngrass on her slippery shoes.\n\nBut on her way back to the house she came to that island that lay in\nthe middle of the drive, dividing the drive into two arms that met in\nfront of the house. The island was made of grass banked up high.\nNothing grew on the top except one huge plant with thick, grey-green,\nthorny leaves, and out of the middle there sprang up a tall stout\nstem. Some of the leaves of the plant were so old that they curled up\nin the air no longer; they turned back, they were split and broken;\nsome of them lay flat and withered on the ground.\n\nWhatever could it be? She had never seen anything like it before. She\nstood and stared. And then she saw her mother coming down the path.\n\n\"Mother, what is it?\" asked Kezia.\n\nLinda looked up at the fat swelling plant with its cruel leaves and\nfleshy stem. High above them, as though becalmed in the air, and yet\nholding so fast to the earth it grew from, it might have had claws\ninstead of roots. The curving leaves seemed to be hiding something;\nthe blind stem cut into the air as if no wind could ever shake it.\n\n\"That is an aloe, Kezia,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Does it ever have any flowers?\"\n\n\"Yes, Kezia,\" and Linda smiled down at her, and half shut her eyes.\n\"Once every hundred years.\"\n\n\n\n7\n\nOn his way home from the office Stanley Burnell stopped the buggy at\nthe Bodega, got out and bought a large bottle of oysters. At the\nChinaman's shop next door he bought a pineapple in the pink of\ncondition, and noticing a basket of fresh black cherries he told John\nto put him a pound of those as well. The oysters and the pine he\nstowed away in the box under the front seat, but the cherries he kept\nin his hand.\n\nPat, the handy-man, leapt off the box and tucked him up again in the\nbrown rug.\n\n\"Lift yer feet, Mr. Burnell, while I give yer a fold under,\" said he.\n\n\"Right! Right! First-rate!\" said Stanley. \"You can make straight for\nhome now.\"\n\nPat gave the grey mare a touch and the buggy sprang forward.\n\n\"I believe this man is a first-rate chap,\" thought Stanley. He liked\nthe look of him sitting up there in his neat brown coat and brown\nbowler. He liked the way Pat had tucked him in, and he liked his eyes.\nThere was nothing servile about him--and if there was one thing he\nhated more than another it was servility. And he looked as if he was\npleased with his job--happy and contented already.\n\nThe grey mare went very well; Burnell was impatient to be out of the\ntown. He wanted to be home. Ah, it was splendid to live in the\ncountry--to get right out of that hole of a town once the office was\nclosed; and this drive in the fresh warm air, knowing all the while\nthat his own house was at the other end, with its garden and paddocks,\nits three tip-top cows and enough fowls and ducks to keep them in\npoultry, was splendid too.\n\nAs they left the town finally and bowled away up the deserted road his\nheart beat hard for joy. He rooted in the bag and began to eat the\ncherries, three or four at a time, chucking the stones over the side\nof the buggy. They were delicious, so plump and cold, without a spot\nor a bruise on them.\n\nLook at those two, now--black one side and white the other--perfect! A\nperfect little pair of Siamese twins. And he stuck them in his\nbutton-hole. . . . By Jove, he wouldn't mind giving that chap up there\na handful--but no, better not. Better wait until he had been with him\na bit longer.\n\nHe began to plan what he would do with his Saturday afternoons and his\nSundays. He wouldn't go to the club for lunch on Saturday. No, cut\naway from the office as soon as possible and get them to give him a\ncouple of slices of cold meat and half a lettuce when he got home. And\nthen he'd get a few chaps out from town to play tennis in the\nafternoon. Not too many--three at most. Beryl was a good player, too.\n. . . He stretched out his right arm and slowly bent it, feeling the\nmuscle. . . . A bath, a good rub-down, a cigar on the verandah after\ndinner. . . .\n\nOn Sunday morning they would go to church--children and all. Which\nreminded him that he must hire a pew, in the sun if possible and well\nforward so as to be out of the draught from the door. In fancy he\nheard himself intoning extremely well: \"When thou did overcome the\n_Sharp_ness of Death Thou didst open the _King_dom of Heaven to _all_\nBelievers.\" And he saw the neat brass-edged card on the corner of the\npew--Mr. Stanley Burnell and family. . . . The rest of the day he'd\nloaf about with Linda. . . . Now they were walking about the garden;\nshe was on his arm, and he was explaining to her at length what he\nintended doing at the office the week following. He heard her saying:\n\"My dear, I think that is most wise.\" . . . Talking things over with\nLinda was a wonderful help even though they were apt to drift away\nfrom the point.\n\nHang it all! They weren't getting along very fast. Pat had put the\nbrake on again. Ugh! What a brute of a thing it was. He could feel it\nin the pit of his stomach.\n\nA sort of panic overtook Burnell whenever he approached near home.\nBefore he was well inside the gate he would shout to anyone within\nsight: \"Is everything all right?\" And then he did not believe it was\nuntil he heard Linda say: \"Hullo! Are you home again?\" That was the\nworst of living in the country--it took the deuce of a long time to\nget back. . . . But now they weren't far off. They were on the top of\nthe last hill; it was a gentle slope all the way now and not more than\nhalf a mile.\n\nPat trailed the whip over the mare's back and he coaxed her: \"Goop\nnow. Goop now.\"\n\nIt wanted a few minutes to sunset. Everything stood motionless bathed\nin bright, metallic light and from the paddocks on either side there\nstreamed the milky scent of ripe grass. The iron gates were open. They\ndashed through and up the drive and round the island, stopping at the\nexact middle of the verandah.\n\n\"Did she satisfy yer, Sir?\" said Pat, getting off the box and grinning\nat his master.\n\n\"Very well indeed, Pat,\" said Stanley.\n\nLinda came out of the glass door; her voice rang in the shadowy quiet.\n\"Hullo! Are you home again?\"\n\nAt the sound of her his heart beat so hard that he could hardly stop\nhimself dashing up the steps and catching her in his arms.\n\n\"Yes, I'm home again. Is everything all right?\"\n\nPat began to lead the buggy round to the side gate that opened into\nthe courtyard.\n\n\"Here, half a moment,\" said Burnell. \"Hand me those two parcels.\" And\nhe said to Linda, \"I've brought you back a bottle of oysters and a\npineapple,\" as though he had brought her back all the harvest of the\nearth.\n\nThey went into the hall; Linda carried the oysters in one hand and the\npineapple in the other. Burnell shut the glass door, threw his hat\ndown, put his arms round her and strained her to him, kissing the top\nof her head, her ears, her lips, her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" said she. \"Wait a moment. Let me put down these\nsilly things,\" and she put the bottle of oysters and the pine on a\nlittle carved chair. \"What have you got in your button-hole--cherries?\"\nShe took them out and hung them over his ear.\n\n\"Don't do that, darling. They are for you.\"\n\nSo she took them off his ear again. \"You don't mind if I save them.\nThey'd spoil my appetite for dinner. Come and see your children. They\nare having tea.\"\n\nThe lamp was lighted on the nursery table. Mrs. Fairfield was cutting\nand spreading bread and butter. The three little girls sat up to table\nwearing large bibs embroidered with their names. They wiped their\nmouths as their father came in ready to be kissed. The windows were\nopen; a jar of wild flowers stood on the mantelpiece, and the lamp\nmade a big soft bubble of light on the ceiling.\n\n\"You seem pretty snug, mother,\" said Burnell, blinking at the light.\nIsabel and Lottie sat one on either side of the table, Kezia at the\nbottom--the place at the top was empty.\n\n\"That's where my boy ought to sit,\" thought Stanley. He tightened his\narm round Linda's shoulder. By God, he was a perfect fool to feel as\nhappy as this!\n\n\"We are, Stanley. We are very snug,\" said Mrs. Fairfield, cutting\nKezia's bread into fingers.\n\n\"Like it better than town--eh, children?\" asked Burnell.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the three little girls, and Isabel added as an\nafter-thought: \"Thank you very much indeed, father dear.\"\n\n\"Come upstairs,\" said Linda. \"I'll bring your slippers.\"\n\nBut the stairs were too narrow for them to go up arm in arm. It was\nquite dark in the room. He heard her ring tapping on the marble\nmantelpiece as she felt for the matches.\n\n\"I've got some, darling. I'll light the candles.\"\n\nBut instead he came up behind her and again he put his arms round her\nand pressed her head into his shoulder.\n\n\"I'm so confoundedly happy,\" he said.\n\n\"Are you?\" She turned and put her hands on his breast and looked up at\nhim.\n\n\"I don't know what has come over me,\" he protested.\n\nIt was quite dark outside now and heavy dew was falling. When Linda\nshut the window the cold dew touched her finger tips. Far away a dog\nbarked. \"I believe there is going to be a moon,\" she said.\n\nAt the words, and with the cold wet dew on her fingers, she felt as\nthough the moon had risen--that she was being strangely discovered in\na flood of cold light. She shivered; she came away from the window and\nsat down upon the box ottoman beside Stanley.\n\n.       .       .       .       .\n\nIn the dining-room, by the flicker of a wood fire, Beryl sat on a\nhassock playing the guitar. She had bathed and changed all her\nclothes. Now she wore a white muslin dress with black spots on it and\nin her hair she had pinned a black silk rose.\n\n  Nature has gone to her rest, love,\n     See, we are alone.\n  Give me your hand to press, love,\n     Lightly within my own.\n\nShe played and sang half to herself, for she was watching herself\nplaying and singing. The firelight gleamed on her shoes, on the ruddy\nbelly of the guitar, and on her white fingers. . . .\n\n\"If I were outside the window and looked in and saw myself I really\nwould be rather struck,\" thought she. Still more softly she played the\naccompaniment--not singing now but listening.\n\n. . . \"The first time that I ever saw you, little girl--oh, you had no\nidea that you were not alone--you were sitting with your little feet\nupon a hassock, playing the guitar. God, I can never forget. . . .\"\nBeryl flung up her head and began to sing again:\n\n  Even the moon is aweary . . .\n\nBut there came a loud bang at the door. The servant girl's crimson\nface popped through.\n\n\"Please, Miss Beryl, I've got to come and lay.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Alice,\" said Beryl, in a voice of ice. She put the guitar\nin a corner. Alice lunged in with a heavy black iron tray.\n\n\"Well, I have had a job with that oving,\" said she. \"I can't get\nnothing to brown.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Beryl.\n\nBut no, she could not stand that fool of a girl. She ran into the dark\ndrawing-room and began walking up and down. . . . Oh, she was\nrestless, restless. There was a mirror over the mantel. She leaned her\narms along and looked at her pale shadow in it. How beautiful she\nlooked, but there was nobody to see, nobody.\n\n\"Why must you suffer so?\" said the face in the mirror. \"You were not\nmade for suffering. . . . Smile!\"\n\nBeryl smiled, and really her smile was so adorable that she smiled\nagain--but this time because she could not help it.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Jones.\"\n\n\"Oh, good morning, Mrs. Smith. I'm so glad to see you. Have you\nbrought your children?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've brought both my twins. I have had another baby since I saw\nyou last, but she came so suddenly that I haven't had time to make her\nany clothes, yet. So I left her. . . . How is your husband?\"\n\n\"Oh, he is very well, thank you. At least he had a nawful cold but\nQueen Victoria--she's my godmother, you know--sent him a case of\npineapples and that cured it im--mediately. Is that your new servant?\"\n\n\"Yes, her name's Gwen. I've only had her two days. Oh, Gwen, this is\nmy friend, Mrs. Smith.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Smith. Dinner won't be ready for about ten\nminutes.\"\n\n\"I don't think you ought to introduce me to the servant. I think I\nought to just begin talking to her.\"\n\n\"Well, she's more of a lady-help than a servant and you do introduce\nlady-helps, I know, because Mrs. Samuel Josephs had one.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, it doesn't matter,\" said the servant, carelessly, beating\nup a chocolate custard with half a broken clothes peg. The dinner was\nbaking beautifully on a concrete step. She began to lay the cloth on a\npink garden seat. In front of each person she put two geranium leaf\nplates, a pine needle fork and a twig knife. There were three daisy\nheads on a laurel leaf for poached eggs, some slices of fuchsia petal\ncold beef, some lovely little rissoles made of earth and water and\ndandelion seeds, and the chocolate custard which she had decided to\nserve in the pawa shell she had cooked it in.\n\n\"You needn't trouble about my children,\" said Mrs. Smith graciously.\n\"If you'll just take this bottle and fill it at the tap--I mean at the\ndairy.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Gwen, and she whispered to Mrs. Jones: \"Shall I\ngo and ask Alice for a little bit of real milk?\"\n\nBut someone called from the front of the house and the luncheon party\nmelted away, leaving the charming table, leaving the rissoles and the\npoached eggs to the ants and to an old snail who pushed his quivering\nhorns over the edge of the garden seat and began to nibble a geranium\nplate.\n\n\"Come round to the front, children. Pip and Rags have come.\"\n\nThe Trout boys were the cousins Kezia had mentioned to the storeman.\nThey lived about a mile away in a house called Monkey Tree Cottage.\nPip was tall for his age, with lank black hair and a white face, but\nRags was very small and so thin that when he was undressed his\nshoulder blades stuck out like two little wings. They had a mongrel\ndog with pale blue eyes and a long tail turned up at the end who\nfollowed them everywhere; he was called Snooker. They spent half their\ntime combing and brushing Snooker and dosing him with various awful\nmixtures concocted by Pip, and kept secretly by him in a broken jug\ncovered with an old kettle lid. Even faithful little Rags was not\nallowed to know the full secret of these mixtures. . . . Take some\ncarbolic tooth powder and a pinch of sulphur powdered up fine, and\nperhaps a bit of starch to stiffen up Snooker's coat. . . . But that\nwas not all; Rags privately thought that the rest was gun-powder.\n. . . And he never was allowed to help with the mixing because of the\ndanger. . . . \"Why if a spot of this flew in your eye, you would be\nblinded for life,\" Pip would say, stirring the mixture with an iron\nspoon. \"And there's always the chance--just the chance, mind you--of\nit exploding if you whack it hard enough. . . . Two spoons of this in\na kerosene tin will be enough to kill thousands of fleas.\" But Snooker\nspent all his spare time biting and snuffling, and he stank\nabominably.\n\n\"It's because he is such a grand fighting dog,\" Pip would say. \"All\nfighting dogs smell.\"\n\nThe Trout boys had often spent the day with the Burnells in town, but\nnow that they lived in this fine house and boncer garden they were\ninclined to be very friendly. Besides, both of them liked playing with\ngirls--Pip, because he could fox them so, and because Lottie was so\neasily frightened, and Rags for a shameful reason. He adored dolls.\nHow he would look at a doll as it lay asleep, speaking in a whisper\nand smiling timidly, and what a treat it was to him to be allowed to\nhold one. . . .\n\n\"Curve your arms round her. Don't keep them stiff like that. You'll\ndrop her,\" Isabel would say sternly.\n\nNow they were standing on the verandah and holding back Snooker who\nwanted to go into the house but wasn't allowed to because Aunt Linda\nhated decent dogs.\n\n\"We came over in the bus with Mum,\" they said, \"and we're going to\nspend the afternoon with you. We brought over a batch of our\ngingerbread for Aunt Linda. Our Minnie made it. It's all over nuts.\"\n\n\"I skinned the almonds,\" said Pip. \"I just stuck my hand into a\nsaucepan of boiling water and grabbed them out and gave them a kind of\npinch and the nuts flew out of the skins, some of them as high as the\nceiling. Didn't they, Rags?\"\n\nRags nodded. \"When they make cakes at our place,\" said Pip, \"we always\nstay in the kitchen, Rags and me, and I get the bowl and he gets the\nspoon and the egg beater. Sponge cake's best. It's all frothy stuff,\nthen.\"\n\nHe ran down the verandah steps to the lawn, planted his hands on the\ngrass, bent forward, and just did not stand on his head.\n\n\"That lawn's all bumpy,\" he said. \"You have to have a flat place for\nstanding on your head. I can walk round the monkey tree on my head at\nour place. Can't I, Rags?\"\n\n\"Nearly,\" said Rags faintly.\n\n\"Stand on your head on the verandah. That's quite flat,\" said Kezia.\n\n\"No, smarty,\" said Pip. \"You have to do it on something soft. Because\nif you give a jerk and fall over, something in your neck goes click,\nand it breaks off. Dad told me.\"\n\n\"Oh, do let's play something,\" said Kezia.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Isabel quickly, \"we'll play hospitals. I will be the\nnurse and Pip can be the doctor and you and Lottie and Rags can be the\nsick people.\"\n\nLottie didn't want to play that, because last time Pip had squeezed\nsomething down her throat and it hurt awfully.\n\n\"Pooh,\" scoffed Pip. \"It was only the juice out of a bit of mandarin\npeel.\"\n\n\"Well, let's play ladies,\" said Isabel. \"Pip can be the father and you\ncan be all our dear little children.\"\n\n\"I hate playing ladies,\" said Kezia. \"You always make us go to church\nhand in hand and come home and go to bed.\"\n\nSuddenly Pip took a filthy handkerchief out of his pocket. \"Snooker!\nHere, sir,\" he called. But Snooker, as usual, tried to sneak away, his\ntail between his legs. Pip leapt on top of him, and pressed him\nbetween his knees.\n\n\"Keep his head firm, Rags,\" he said, and he tied the handkerchief\nround Snooker's head with a funny knot sticking up at the top.\n\n\"Whatever is that for?\" asked Lottie.\n\n\"It's to train his ears to grow more close to his head--see?\" said\nPip. \"All fighting dogs have ears that lie back. But Snooker's ears\nare a bit too soft.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Kezia. \"They are always turning inside out. I hate\nthat.\"\n\nSnooker lay down, made one feeble effort with his paw to get the\nhandkerchief off, but finding he could not, trailed after the\nchildren, shivering with misery.\n\n\n\n9\n\nPat came swinging along; in his hand he held a little tomahawk that\nwinked in the sun.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he said to the children, \"and I'll show you how the\nkings of Ireland chop the head off a duck.\"\n\nThey drew back--they didn't believe him, and besides, the Trout boys\nhad never seen Pat before.\n\n\"Come on now,\" he coaxed, smiling and holding out his hand to Kezia.\n\n\"Is it a real duck's head? One from the paddock?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Pat. She put her hand in his hard dry one, and he stuck\nthe tomahawk in his belt and held out the other to Rags. He loved\nlittle children.\n\n\"I'd better keep hold of Snooker's head if there's going to be any\nblood about,\" said Pip, \"because the sight of blood makes him awfully\nwild.\" He ran ahead dragging Snooker by the handkerchief.\n\n\"Do you think we ought to go?\" whispered Isabel. \"We haven't asked or\nanything. Have we?\"\n\nAt the bottom of the orchard a gate was set in the paling fence. On\nthe other side a steep bank led down to a bridge that spanned the\ncreek, and once up the bank on the other side you were on the fringe\nof the paddocks. A little old stable in the first paddock had been\nturned into a fowl house. The fowls had strayed far away across the\npaddock down to a dumping ground in a hollow, but the ducks kept close\nto that part of the creek that flowed under the bridge.\n\nTall bushes overhung the stream with red leaves and yellow flowers and\nclusters of blackberries. At some places the stream was wide and\nshallow, but at others it tumbled into deep little pools with foam at\nthe edges and quivering bubbles. It was in these pools that the big\nwhite ducks had made themselves at home, swimming and guzzling along\nthe weedy banks.\n\nUp and down they swam, preening their dazzling breasts, and other\nducks with the same dazzling breasts and yellow bills swam upside down\nwith them.\n\n\"There is the little Irish navy,\" said Pat, \"and look at the old\nadmiral there with the green neck and the grand little flagstaff on\nhis tail.\"\n\nHe pulled a handful of grain from his pocket and began to walk towards\nthe fowl-house, lazy, his straw hat with the broken crown pulled over\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Lid. Lid--lid--lid--lid----\" he called.\n\n\"Qua. Qua--qua--qua--qua----\" answered the ducks, making for land, and\nflapping and scrambling up the bank they streamed after him in a long\nwaddling line. He coaxed them, pretending to throw the grain, shaking\nit in his hands and calling to them until they swept round him in a\nwhite ring.\n\nFrom far away the fowls heard the clamour and they too came running\nacross the paddock, their heads thrust forward, their wings spread,\nturning in their feet in the silly way fowls run and scolding as they\ncame.\n\nThen Pat scattered the grain and the greedy ducks began to gobble.\nQuickly he stooped, seized two, one under each arm, and strode across\nto the children. Their darting heads and round eyes frightened the\nchildren--all except Pip.\n\n\"Come on, sillies,\" he cried, \"they can't bite. They haven't any\nteeth. They've only got those two little holes in their beaks for\nbreathing through.\"\n\n\"Will you hold one while I finish with the other?\" asked Pat. Pip let\ngo of Snooker. \"Won't I? Won't I? Give us one. I don't mind how much\nhe kicks.\"\n\nHe nearly sobbed with delight when Pat gave the white lump into his\narms.\n\nThere was an old stump beside the door of the fowl-house. Pat grabbed\nthe duck by the legs, laid it flat across the stump, and almost at the\nsame moment down came the little tomahawk and the duck's head flew off\nthe stump. Up the blood spurted over the white feathers and over his\nhand.\n\nWhen the children saw the blood they were frightened no longer. They\ncrowded round him and began to scream. Even Isabel leaped about\ncrying: \"The blood! The blood!\" Pip forgot all about his duck. He\nsimply threw it away from him and shouted, \"I saw it. I saw it,\" and\njumped round the wood block.\n\nRags, with cheeks as white as paper, ran up to the little head, put\nout a finger as if he wanted to touch it, shrank back again and then\nagain put out a finger. He was shivering all over.\n\nEven Lottie, frightened little Lottie, began to laugh and pointed at\nthe duck and shrieked: \"Look, Kezia, look.\"\n\n\"Watch it!\" shouted Pat. He put down the body and it began to\nwaddle--with only a long spurt of blood where the head had been; it\nbegan to pad away without a sound towards the steep bank that led to\nthe stream. . . . That was the crowning wonder.\n\n\"Do you see that? Do you see that?\" yelled Pip. He ran among the\nlittle girls tugging at their pinafores.\n\n\"It's like a little engine. It's like a funny little railway engine,\"\nsquealed Isabel.\n\nBut Kezia suddenly rushed at Pat and flung her arms round his legs and\nbutted her head as hard as she could against his knees.\n\n\"Put head back! Put head back!\" she screamed.\n\nWhen he stooped to move her she would not let go or take her head\naway. She held on as hard as she could and sobbed: \"Head back! Head\nback!\" until it sounded like a loud strange hiccup.\n\n\"It's stopped. It's tumbled over. It's dead,\" said Pip.\n\nPat dragged Kezia up into his arms. Her sun-bonnet had fallen back,\nbut she would not let him look at her face. No, she pressed her face\ninto a bone in his shoulder and clasped her arms round his neck.\n\nThe children stopped screaming as suddenly as they had begun. They\nstood round the dead duck. Rags was not frightened of the head any\nmore. He knelt down and stroked it, now.\n\n\"I don't think the head is quite dead yet,\" he said. \"Do you think it\nwould keep alive if I gave it something to drink?\"\n\nBut Pip got very cross: \"Bah! You baby.\" He whistled to Snooker and\nwent off.\n\nWhen Isabel went up to Lottie, Lottie snatched away.\n\n\"What are you always touching me for, Isabel?\"\n\n\"There now,\" said Pat to Kezia. \"There's the grand little girl.\"\n\nShe put up her hands and touched his ears. She felt something. Slowly\nshe raised her quivering face and looked. Pat wore little round gold\near-rings. She never knew that men wore ear-rings. She was very much\nsurprised.\n\n\"Do they come on and off?\" she asked huskily.\n\n\n\n10\n\nUp in the house, in the warm tidy kitchen, Alice, the servant girl,\nwas getting the afternoon tea. She was \"dressed.\" She had on a black\nstuff dress that smelt under the arms, a white apron like a large\nsheet of paper, and a lace bow pinned on to her hair with two jetty\npins. Also her comfortable carpet slippers were changed for a pair of\nblack leather ones that pinched her corn on her little toe something\ndreadful. . . .\n\nIt was warm in the kitchen. A blow-fly buzzed, a fan of whity steam\ncame out of the kettle, and the lid kept up a rattling jig as the\nwater bubbled. The clock ticked in the warm air, slow and deliberate,\nlike the click of an old woman's knitting needle, and sometimes--for\nno reason at all, for there wasn't any breeze--the blind swung out and\nback, tapping the window.\n\nAlice was making water-cress sandwiches. She had a lump of butter on\nthe table, a barracouta loaf, and the cresses tumbled in a white\ncloth.\n\nBut propped against the butter dish there was a dirty, greasy little\nbook, half unstitched, with curled edges, and while she mashed the\nbutter she read:\n\n\"To dream of black-beetles drawing a hearse is bad. Signifies death of\none you hold near or dear, either father, husband, brother, son, or\nintended. If beetles crawl backwards as you watch them it means death\nfrom fire or from great height such as flight of stairs, scaffolding,\netc.\n\n\"Spiders. To dream of spiders creeping over you is good. Signifies\nlarge sum of money in near future. Should party be in family way an\neasy confinement may be expected. But care should be taken in sixth\nmonth to avoid eating of probable present of shell fish. . . .\"\n\n  How many thousand birds I see.\n\nOh, life. There was Miss Beryl. Alice dropped the knife and slipped\nthe _Dream Book_ under the butter dish. But she hadn't time to hide it\nquite, for Beryl ran into the kitchen and up to the table, and the\nfirst thing her eye lighted on were those greasy edges. Alice saw Miss\nBeryl's meaning little smile and the way she raised her eyebrows and\nscrewed up her eyes as though she were not quite sure what that could\nbe. She decided to answer if Miss Beryl should ask her: \"Nothing as\nbelongs to you, Miss.\" But she knew Miss Beryl would not ask her.\n\nAlice was a mild creature in reality, but she had the most marvellous\nretorts ready for questions that she knew would never be put to her.\nThe composing of them and the turning of them over and over in her\nmind comforted her just as much as if they'd been expressed. Really,\nthey kept her alive in places where she'd been that chivvied she'd\nbeen afraid to go to bed at night with a box of matches on the chair\nin case she bit the tops off in her sleep, as you might say.\n\n\"Oh, Alice,\" said Miss Beryl. \"There's one extra to tea, so heat a\nplate of yesterday's scones, please. And put on the Victoria sandwich\nas well as the coffee cake. And don't forget to put little doyleys\nunder the plates--will you? You did yesterday, you know, and the tea\nlooked so ugly and common. And, Alice, don't put that dreadful old\npink and green cosy on the afternoon teapot again. That is only for\nthe mornings. Really, I think it ought to be kept for the\nkitchen--it's so shabby, and quite smelly. Put on the Japanese one.\nYou quite understand, don't you?\"\n\nMiss Beryl had finished.\n\n  That sing aloud from every tree . . .\n\nshe sang as she left the kitchen, very pleased with her firm handling\nof Alice.\n\nOh, Alice was wild. She wasn't one to mind being told, but there was\nsomething in the way Miss Beryl had of speaking to her that she\ncouldn't stand. Oh, that she couldn't. It made her curl up inside, as\nyou might say, and she fair trembled. But what Alice really hated Miss\nBeryl for was that she made her feel low. She talked to Alice in a\nspecial voice as though she wasn't quite all there; and she never lost\nher temper with her--never. Even when Alice dropped anything or forgot\nanything important Miss Beryl seemed to have expected it to happen.\n\n\"If you please, Mrs. Burnell,\" said an imaginary Alice, as she\nbuttered the scones, \"I'd rather not take my orders from Miss Beryl. I\nmay be only a common servant girl as doesn't know how to play the\nguitar, but . . .\"\n\nThis last thrust pleased her so much that she quite recovered her\ntemper.\n\n\"The only thing to do,\" she heard, as she opened the dining-room door,\n\"is to cut the sleeves out entirely and just have a broad band of\nblack velvet over the shoulders instead. . . .\"\n\n\n\n11\n\nThe white duck did not look as if it had ever had a head when Alice\nplaced it in front of Stanley Burnell that night. It lay, in\nbeautifully basted resignation, on a blue dish--its legs tied together\nwith a piece of string and a wreath of little balls of stuffing round\nit.\n\nIt was hard to say which of the two, Alice or the duck, looked the\nbetter basted; they were both such a rich colour and they both had the\nsame air of gloss and strain. But Alice was fiery red and the duck a\nSpanish mahogany.\n\nBurnell ran his eye along the edge of the carving knife. He prided\nhimself very much upon his carving, upon making a first-class job of\nit. He hated seeing a woman carve; they were always too slow and they\nnever seemed to care what the meat looked like afterwards. Now he did;\nhe took a real pride in cutting delicate shaves of cold beef, little\nwads of mutton, just the right thickness, and in dividing a chicken or\na duck with nice precision. . . .\n\n\"Is this the first of the home products?\" he asked, knowing perfectly\nwell that it was.\n\n\"Yes, the butcher did not come. We have found out that he only calls\ntwice a week.\"\n\nBut there was no need to apologise. It was a superb bird. It wasn't\nmeat at all, but a kind of very superior jelly. \"My father would say,\"\nsaid Burnell, \"this must have been one of those birds whose mother\nplayed to it in infancy upon the German flute. And the sweet strains\nof the dulcet instrument acted with such effect upon the infant mind.\n. . . Have some more, Beryl? You and I are the only ones in this house\nwith a real feeling for food. I'm perfectly willing to state, in a\ncourt of law, if necessary, that I love good food.\"\n\nTea was served in the drawing-room, and Beryl, who for some reason had\nbeen very charming to Stanley ever since he came home, suggested a\ngame of crib. They sat at a little table near one of the open windows.\nMrs. Fairfield disappeared, and Linda lay in a rocking-chair, her arms\nabove her head, rocking to and fro.\n\n\"You don't want the light--do you, Linda?\" said Beryl. She moved the\ntall lamp so that she sat under its soft light.\n\nHow remote they looked, those two, from where Linda sat and rocked.\nThe green table, the polished cards, Stanley's big hands and Beryl's\ntiny ones, all seemed to be part of one mysterious movement. Stanley\nhimself, big and solid, in his dark suit, took his ease, and Beryl\ntossed her bright head and pouted. Round her throat she wore an\nunfamiliar velvet ribbon. It changed her, somehow--altered the shape\nof her face--but it was charming, Linda decided. The room smelled of\nlilies; there were two big jars of arums in the fire-place.\n\n\"Fifteen two--fifteen four--and a pair is six and a run of three is\nnine,\" said Stanley, so deliberately, he might have been counting\nsheep.\n\n\"I've nothing but two pairs,\" said Beryl, exaggerating her woe because\nshe knew how he loved winning.\n\nThe cribbage pegs were like two little people going up the road\ntogether, turning round the sharp corner, and coming down the road\nagain. They were pursuing each other. They did not so much want to get\nahead as to keep near enough to talk--to keep near, perhaps that was\nall.\n\nBut no, there was always one who was impatient and hopped away as the\nother came up, and would not listen. Perhaps the white peg was\nfrightened of the red one, or perhaps he was cruel and would not give\nthe red one a chance to speak. . . .\n\nIn the front of her dress Beryl wore a bunch of pansies, and once when\nthe little pegs were side by side, she bent over and the pansies\ndropped out and covered them.\n\n\"What a shame,\" said she, picking up the pansies. \"Just as they had a\nchance to fly into each other's arms.\"\n\n\"Farewell, my girl,\" laughed Stanley, and away the red peg hopped.\n\nThe drawing-room was long and narrow with glass doors that gave on to\nthe verandah. It had a cream paper with a pattern of gilt roses, and\nthe furniture, which had belonged to old Mrs. Fairfield, was dark and\nplain. A little piano stood against the wall with yellow pleated silk\nlet into the carved front. Above it hung an oil painting by Beryl of a\nlarge cluster of surprised looking clematis. Each flower was the size\nof a small saucer, with a centre like an astonished eye fringed in\nblack. But the room was not finished yet. Stanley had set his heart on\na Chesterfield and two decent chairs. Linda liked it best as it was.\n. . .\n\nTwo big moths flew in through the window and round and round the\ncircle of lamplight.\n\n\"Fly away before it is too late. Fly out again.\"\n\nRound and round they flew; they seemed to bring the silence and the\nmoonlight in with them on their silent wings. . . .\n\n\"I've two kings,\" said Stanley. \"Any good?\"\n\n\"Quite good,\" said Beryl.\n\nLinda stopped rocking and got up. Stanley looked across. \"Anything the\nmatter, darling?\"\n\n\"No, nothing. I'm going to find mother.\"\n\nShe went out of the room and standing at the foot of the stairs she\ncalled, but her mother's voice answered her from the verandah.\n\nThe moon that Lottie and Kezia had seen from the storeman's wagon was\nfull, and the house, the garden, the old woman and Linda--all were\nbathed in dazzling light.\n\n\"I have been looking at the aloe,\" said Mrs. Fairfield. \"I believe it\nis going to flower this year. Look at the top there. Are those buds,\nor is it only an effect of light?\"\n\nAs they stood on the steps, the high grassy bank on which the aloe\nrested rose up like a wave, and the aloe seemed to ride upon it like a\nship with the oars lifted. Bright moonlight hung upon the lifted oars\nlike water, and on the green wave glittered the dew.\n\n\"Do you feel it, too,\" said Linda, and she spoke to her mother with\nthe special voice that women use at night to each other as though they\nspoke in their sleep or from some hollow cave--\"Don't you feel that it\nis coming towards us?\"\n\nShe dreamed that she was caught up out of the cold water into the ship\nwith the lifted oars and the budding mast. Now the oars fell striking\nquickly, quickly. They rowed far away over the top of the garden\ntrees, the paddocks and the dark bush beyond. Ah, she heard herself\ncry: \"Faster! Faster!\" to those who were rowing.\n\nHow much more real this dream was than that they should go back to the\nhouse where the sleeping children lay and where Stanley and Beryl\nplayed cribbage.\n\n\"I believe those are buds,\" said she. \"Let us go down into the garden,\nmother. I like that aloe. I like it more than anything here. And I am\nsure I shall remember it long after I've forgotten all the other\nthings.\"\n\nShe put her hand on her mother's arm and they walked down the steps,\nround the island and on to the main drive that led to the front gates.\n\nLooking at it from below she could see the long sharp thorns that\nedged the aloe leaves, and at the sight of them her heart grew hard.\n. . . She particularly liked the long sharp thorns. . . . Nobody would\ndare to come near the ship or to follow after.\n\n\"Not even my Newfoundland dog,\" thought she, \"that I'm so fond of in\nthe daytime.\"\n\nFor she really was fond of him; she loved and admired and respected\nhim tremendously. Oh, better than anyone else in the world. She knew\nhim through and through. He was the soul of truth and decency, and for\nall his practical experience he was awfully simple, easily pleased and\neasily hurt. . . .\n\nIf only he wouldn't jump at her so, and bark so loudly, and watch her\nwith such eager, loving eyes. He was too strong for her; she had\nalways hated things that rush at her, from a child. There were times\nwhen he was frightening--really frightening. When she just had not\nscreamed at the top of her voice: \"You are killing me.\" And at those\ntimes she had longed to say the most coarse, hateful things. . . .\n\n\"You know I'm very delicate. You know as well as I do that my heart is\naffected, and the doctor has told you I may die any moment. I have had\nthree great lumps of children already. . . .\"\n\nYes, yes, it was true. Linda snatched her hand from mother's arm. For\nall her love and respect and admiration she hated him. And how tender\nhe always was after times like those, how submissive, how thoughtful.\nHe would do anything for her; he longed to serve her. . . . Linda\nheard herself saying in a weak voice:\n\n\"Stanley, would you light a candle?\"\n\nAnd she heard his joyful voice answer: \"Of course I will, my darling.\"\nAnd he leapt out of bed as though he were going to leap at the moon\nfor her.\n\nIt had never been so plain to her as it was at this moment. There were\nall her feelings for him, sharp and defined, one as true as the other.\nAnd there was this other, this hatred, just as real as the rest. She\ncould have done her feelings up in little packets and given them to\nStanley. She longed to hand him that last one, for a surprise. She\ncould see his eyes as he opened that . . .\n\nShe hugged her folded arms and began to laugh silently. How absurd\nlife was--it was laughable, simply laughable. And why this mania of\nhers to keep alive at all? For it really was a mania, she thought,\nmocking and laughing.\n\n\"What am I guarding myself for so preciously? I shall go on having\nchildren and Stanley will go on making money and the children and the\ngardens will grow bigger and bigger, with whole fleets of aloes in\nthem for me to choose from.\"\n\nShe had been walking with her head bent, looking at nothing. Now she\nlooked up and about her. They were standing by the red and white\ncamellia trees. Beautiful were the rich dark leaves spangled with\nlight and the round flowers that perch among them like red and white\nbirds. Linda pulled a piece of verbena and crumpled it, and held her\nhands to her mother.\n\n\"Delicious,\" said the old woman. \"Are you cold, child? Are you\ntrembling? Yes, your hands are cold. We had better go back to the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"What have you been thinking about?\" said Linda. \"Tell me.\"\n\n\"I haven't really been thinking of anything. I wondered as we passed\nthe orchard what the fruit trees were like and whether we should be\nable to make much jam this autumn. There are splendid healthy currant\nbushes in the vegetable garden. I noticed them to-day. I should like\nto see those pantry shelves thoroughly well stocked with our own jam.\n. . .\"\n\n\n\n12\n\n\"MY DARLING NAN,\n\nDon't think me a piggy wig because I haven't written before. I haven't\nhad a moment, dear, and even now I feel so exhausted that I can hardly\nhold a pen.\n\nWell, the dreadful deed is done. We have actually left the giddy whirl\nof town, and I can't see how we shall ever go back again, for my\nbrother-in-law has bought this house 'lock, stock and barrel,' to use\nhis own words.\n\nIn a way, of course, it is an awful relief, for he has been\nthreatening to take a place in the country ever since I've lived with\nthem--and I must say the house and garden are awfully nice--a million\ntimes better than that awful cubby-hole in town.\n\nBut buried, my dear. Buried isn't the word.\n\nWe have got neighbours, but they are only farmers--big louts of boys\nwho seem to be milking all day, and two dreadful females with rabbit\nteeth who brought us some scones when we were moving and said they\nwould be pleased to help. But my sister who lives a mile away doesn't\nknow a soul here, so I am sure we never shall. It's pretty certain\nnobody will ever come out from town to see us, because though there is\na bus it's an awful old rattling thing with black leather sides that\nany decent person would rather die than ride in for six miles.\n\nSuch is life. It's a sad ending for poor little B. I'll get to be a\nmost awful frump in a year or two and come and see you in a mackintosh\nand a sailor hat tied on with a white china silk motor veil. So\npretty.\n\nStanley says that now we are settled--for after the most awful week of\nmy life we really are settled--he is going to bring out a couple of\nmen from the club on Saturday afternoons for tennis. In fact, two are\npromised as a great treat to-day. But, my dear, if you could see\nStanley's men from the club . . . rather fattish, the type who look\nfrightfully indecent without waistcoats--always with toes that turn in\nrather--so conspicuous when you are walking about a court in white\nshoes. And they are pulling up their trousers every minute--don't you\nknow--and whacking at imaginary things with their rackets.\n\nI used to play with them at the club last summer, and I am sure you\nwill know the type when I tell you that after I'd been there about\nthree times they all called me Miss Beryl. It's a weary world. Of\ncourse mother simply loves the place, but then I suppose when I am\nmother's age I shall be content to sit in the sun and shell peas into\na basin. But I'm not--not--not.\n\nWhat Linda thinks about the whole affair, per usual, I haven't the\nslightest idea. Mysterious as ever. . . .\n\nMy dear, you know that white satin dress of mine. I have taken the\nsleeves out entirely, put bands of black velvet across the shoulders\nand two big red poppies off my dear sister's _chapeau._ It is a great\nsuccess, though when I shall wear it I do not know.\"\n\n\nBeryl sat writing this letter at a little table in her room. In a way,\nof course, it was all perfectly true, but in another way it was all\nthe greatest rubbish and she didn't believe a word of it. No, that\nwasn't true. She felt all those things, but she didn't really feel\nthem like that.\n\nIt was her other self who had written that letter. It not only bored,\nit rather disgusted her real self.\n\n\"Flippant and silly,\" said her real self. Yet she knew that she'd send\nit and she'd always write that kind of twaddle to Nan Pym. In fact, it\nwas a very mild example of the kind of letter she generally wrote.\n\nBeryl leaned her elbows on the table and read it through again. The\nvoice of the letter seemed to come up to her from the page. It was\nfaint already, like a voice heard over the telephone, high, gushing,\nwith something bitter in the sound. Oh, she detested it to-day.\n\n\"You've always got so much animation,\" said Nan Pym. \"That's why men\nare so keen on you.\" And she had added, rather mournfully, for men\nwere not at all keen on Nan, who was a solid kind of girl, with fat\nhips and a high colour--\"I can't understand how you can keep it up.\nBut it is your nature, I suppose.\"\n\nWhat rot. What nonsense. It wasn't her nature at all. Good heavens, if\nshe had ever been her real self with Nan Pym, Nannie would have jumped\nout of the window with surprise. . . . My dear, you know that white\nsatin of mine. . . . Beryl slammed the letter-case to.\n\nShe jumped up and half unconsciously, half consciously she drifted\nover to the looking-glass.\n\nThere stood a slim girl in white--a white serge skirt, a white silk\nblouse, and a leather belt drawn in very tightly at her tiny waist.\n\nHer face was heart-shaped, wide at the brows and with a pointed\nchin--but not too pointed. Her eyes, her eyes were perhaps her best\nfeature; they were such a strange uncommon colour--greeny blue with\nlittle gold points in them.\n\nShe had fine black eyebrows and long lashes--so long, that when they\nlay on her cheeks you positively caught the light in them, someone or\nother had told her.\n\nHer mouth was rather large. Too large? No, not really. Her underlip\nprotruded a little; she had a way of sucking it in that somebody else\nhad told her was awfully fascinating.\n\nHer nose was her least satisfactory feature. Not that it was really\nugly. But it was not half as fine as Linda's. Linda really had a\nperfect little nose. Hers spread rather--not badly. And in all\nprobability she exaggerated the spreadiness of it just because it was\nher nose, and she was so awfully critical of herself. She pinched it\nwith a thumb and first finger and made a little face. . . .\n\nLovely, lovely hair. And such a mass of it. It had the colour of fresh\nfallen leaves, brown and red with a glint of yellow. When she did it\nin a long plait she felt it on her backbone like a long snake. She\nloved to feel the weight of it dragging her head back, and she loved\nto feel it loose, covering her bare arms. \"Yes, my dear, there is no\ndoubt about it, you really are a lovely little thing.\"\n\nAt the words her bosom lifted; she took a long breath of delight, half\nclosing her eyes.\n\nBut even as she looked the smile faded from her lips and eyes. Oh God,\nthere she was, back again, playing the same old game. False--false as\never. False as when she'd written to Nan Pym. False even when she was\nalone with herself, now.\n\nWhat had that creature in the glass to do with her, and why was she\nstaring? She dropped down to one side of her bed and buried her face\nin her arms.\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"I am so miserable--so frightfully miserable. I know\nthat I'm silly and spiteful and vain; I'm always acting a part. I'm\nnever my real self for a moment.\" And plainly, plainly, she saw her\nfalse self running up and down the stairs, laughing a special trilling\nlaugh if they had visitors, standing under the lamp if a man came to\ndinner, so that he should see the light on her hair, pouting and\npretending to be a little girl when she was asked to play the guitar.\nWhy? She even kept it up for Stanley's benefit. Only last night when\nhe was reading the paper her false self had stood beside him and\nleaned against his shoulder on purpose. Hadn't she put her hand over\nhis, pointing out something so that he should see how white her hand\nwas beside his brown one.\n\nHow despicable! Despicable! Her heart was cold with rage. \"It's\nmarvellous how you keep it up,\" said she to the false self. But then\nit was only because she was so miserable--so miserable. If she had\nbeen happy and leading her own life, her false life would cease to be.\nShe saw the real Beryl--a shadow . . . a shadow. Faint and\nunsubstantial she shone. What was there of her except the radiance?\nAnd for what tiny moments she was really she. Beryl could almost\nremember every one of them. At those times she had felt: \"Life is rich\nand mysterious and good, and I am rich and mysterious and good, too.\"\nShall I ever be that Beryl for ever? Shall I? How can I? And was there\never a time when I did not have a false self? . . . But just as she\nhad got that far she heard the sound of little steps running along the\npassage; the door handle rattled. Kezia came in.\n\n\"Aunt Beryl, mother says will you please come down? Father is home\nwith a man and lunch is ready.\"\n\nBotheration! How she had crumpled her skirt, kneeling in that idiotic\nway.\n\n\"Very well, Kezia.\" She went over to the dressing table and powdered\nher nose.\n\nKezia crossed too, and unscrewed a little pot of cream and sniffed it.\nUnder her arm she carried a very dirty calico cat.\n\nWhen Aunt Beryl ran out of the room she sat the cat up on the dressing\ntable and stuck the top of the cream jar over its ear.\n\n\"Now look at yourself,\" said she sternly.\n\nThe calico cat was so overcome by the sight that it toppled over\nbackwards and bumped and bumped on to the floor. And the top of the\ncream jar flew through the air and rolled like a penny in a round on\nthe linoleum--and did not break.\n\nBut for Kezia it had broken the moment it flew through the air, and\nshe picked it up, hot all over, and put it back on the dressing table.\n\nThen she tip-toed away, far too quickly and airily. . . .\n\n\n\n\nJE NE PARLE PAS FRAN\u00c3\u0087AIS\n\nI DO not know why I have such a fancy for this little caf\u00c3\u00a9. It's dirty\nand sad, sad. It's not as if it had anything to distinguish it from a\nhundred others--it hasn't; or as if the same strange types came here\nevery day, whom one could watch from one's corner and recognise and\nmore or less (with a strong accent on the less) get the hang of.\n\nBut pray don't imagine that those brackets are a confession of my\nhumility before the mystery of the human soul. Not at all; I don't\nbelieve in the human soul. I never have. I believe that people are\nlike portmanteaux--packed with certain things, started going, thrown\nabout, tossed away, dumped down, lost and found, half emptied\nsuddenly, or squeezed fatter than ever, until finally the Ultimate\nPorter swings them on to the Ultimate Train and away they rattle.\n. . .\n\nNot but what these portmanteaux can be very fascinating. Oh, but very!\nI see myself standing in front of them, don't you know, like a Customs\nofficial.\n\n\"Have you anything to declare? Any wines, spirits, cigars, perfumes,\nsilks?\"\n\nAnd the moment of hesitation as to whether I am going to be fooled\njust before I chalk that squiggle, and then the other moment of\nhesitation just after, as to whether I have been, are perhaps the two\nmost thrilling instants in life. Yes, they are, to me.\n\nBut before I started that long and rather far-fetched and not\nfrightfully original digression, what I meant to say quite simply was\nthat there are no portmanteaux to be examined here because the\nclientele of this caf\u00c3\u00a9, ladies and gentlemen, does not sit down. No,\nit stands at the counter, and it consists of a handful of workmen who\ncome up from the river, all powdered over with white flour, lime or\nsomething, and a few soldiers, bringing with them thin, dark girls\nwith silver rings in their ears and market baskets on their arms.\n\nMadame is thin and dark, too, with white cheeks and white hands. In\ncertain lights she looks quite transparent, shining out of her black\nshawl with an extraordinary effect. When she is not serving she sits\non a stool with her face turned, always, to the window. Her\ndark-ringed eyes search among and follow after the people passing, but\nnot as if she was looking for somebody. Perhaps, fifteen years ago,\nshe was; but now the pose has become a habit. You can tell from her\nair of fatigue and hopelessness that she must have given them up for\nthe last ten years, at least. . . .\n\nAnd then there is the waiter. Not pathetic--decidedly not comic. Never\nmaking one of those perfectly insignificant remarks which amaze you so\ncoming from a waiter, (as though the poor wretch were a sort of cross\nbetween a coffee-pot and a wine bottle and not expected to hold so\nmuch as a drop of anything else). He is grey, flat-footed and\nwithered, with long, brittle nails that set your nerves on edge while\nhe scrapes up your two sous. When he is not smearing over the table or\nflicking at a dead fly or two, he stands with one hand on the back of\na chair, in his far too long apron, and over his other arm the\nthree-cornered dip of dirty napkin, waiting to be photographed in\nconnection with some wretched murder. \"Interior of Caf\u00c3\u00a9 where Body was\nFound.\" You've seen him hundreds of times.\n\nDo you believe that every place has its hour of the day when it really\ndoes come alive? That's not exactly what I mean. It's more like this.\nThere does seem to be a moment when you realize that, quite by\naccident, you happen to have come on to the stage at exactly the\nmoment you were expected. Everything is arranged for you--waiting for\nyou. Ah, master of the situation! You fill with important breath. And\nat the same time you smile, secretly, slyly, because Life seems to be\nopposed to granting you these entrances, seems indeed to be engaged in\nsnatching them from you and making them impossible, keeping you in the\nwings until it is too late, in fact. . . . Just for once you've beaten\nthe old hag.\n\nI enjoyed one of these moments the first time I ever came in here.\nThat's why I keep coming back, I suppose. Revisiting the scene of my\ntriumph, or the scene of the crime where I had the old bitch by the\nthroat for once and did what I pleased with her.\n\nQuery: Why am I so bitter against Life? And why do I see her as a\nrag-picker on the American cinema, shuffling along wrapped in a filthy\nshawl with her old claws crooked over a stick?\n\nAnswer: The direct result of the American cinema acting upon a weak\nmind.\n\nAnyhow, the \"short winter afternoon was drawing to a close,\" as they\nsay, and I was drifting along, either going home or not going home,\nwhen I found myself in here, walking over to this seat in the corner.\n\nI hung up my English overcoat and grey felt hat on that same peg\nbehind me, and after I had allowed the waiter time for at least twenty\nphotographers to snap their fill of him, I ordered a coffee.\n\nHe poured me out a glass of the familiar, purplish stuff with a green\nwandering light playing over it, and shuffled off, and I sat pressing\nmy hands against the glass because it was bitterly cold outside.\n\nSuddenly I realized that quite apart from myself, I was smiling.\nSlowly I raised my head and saw myself in the mirror opposite. Yes,\nthere I sat, leaning on the table, smiling my deep, sly smile, the\nglass of coffee with its vague plume of steam before me and beside it\nthe ring of white saucer with two pieces of sugar.\n\nI opened my eyes very wide. There I had been for all eternity, as it\nwere, and now at last I was coming to life. . . .\n\nIt was very quiet in the caf\u00c3\u00a9. Outside, one could just see through the\ndusk that it had begun to snow. One could just see the shapes of\nhorses and carts and people, soft and white, moving through the\nfeathery air. The waiter disappeared and reappeared with an armful of\nstraw. He strewed it over the floor from the door to the counter and\nround about the stove with humble, almost adoring gestures. One would\nnot have been surprised if the door had opened and the Virgin Mary had\ncome in, riding upon an ass, her meek hands folded over her big belly.\n. . .\n\nThat's rather nice, don't you think, that bit about the Virgin? It\ncomes from the pen so gently; it has such a \"dying fall.\" I thought so\nat the time and decided to make a note of it. One never knows when a\nlittle tag like that may come in useful to round off a paragraph. So,\ntaking care to move as little as possible because the \"spell\" was\nstill unbroken (you know that?), I reached over to the next table for\na writing pad.\n\nNo paper or envelopes, of course. Only a morsel of pink\nblotting-paper, incredibly soft and limp and almost moist, like the\ntongue of a little dead kitten, which I've never felt.\n\nI sat--but always underneath, in this state of expectation, rolling\nthe little dead kitten's tongue round my finger and rolling the soft\nphrase round my mind while my eyes took in the girls' names and dirty\njokes and drawings of bottles and cups that would not sit in the\nsaucers, scattered over the writing pad.\n\nThey are always the same, you know. The girls always have the same\nnames, the cups never sit in the saucers; all the hearts are stuck and\ntied up with ribbons.\n\nBut then, quite suddenly, at the bottom of the page, written in green\nink, I fell on to that stupid, stale little phrase: _Je ne parle pas\nfran\u00c3\u00a7ais._\n\nThere! it had come--the moment--the _geste!_ And although I was so\nready, it caught me, it tumbled me over; I was simply overwhelmed. And\nthe physical feeling was so curious, so particular. It was as if all\nof me, except my head and arms, all of me that was under the table,\nhad simply dissolved, melted, turned into water. Just my head remained\nand two sticks of arms pressing on to the table. But, ah! the agony of\nthat moment! How can I describe it? I didn't think of anything. I\ndidn't even cry out to myself. Just for one moment I was not. I was\nAgony, Agony, Agony.\n\nThen it passed, and the very second after I was thinking: \"Good God!\nAm I capable of feeling as strongly as that? But I was absolutely\nunconscious! I hadn't a phrase to meet it with! I was overcome! I was\nswept off my feet! I didn't even try, in the dimmest way, to put it\ndown!\"\n\nAnd up I puffed and puffed, blowing off finally with: \"After all I\nmust be first-rate. No second-rate mind could have experienced such an\nintensity of feeling so . . . purely.\"\n\n\n\nThe waiter has touched a spill at the red stove and lighted a bubble\nof gas under a spreading shade. It is no use looking out of the\nwindow, Madame; it is quite dark now. Your white hands hover over your\ndark shawl. They are like two birds that have come home to roost. They\nare restless, restless. . . . You tuck them, finally, under your warm\nlittle armpits.\n\nNow the waiter has taken a long pole and clashed the curtains\ntogether. \"All gone,\" as children say.\n\nAnd besides, I've no patience with people who can't let go of things,\nwho will follow after and cry out. When a thing's gone, it's gone.\nIt's over and done with. Let it go then! Ignore it, and comfort\nyourself, if you do want comforting, with the thought that you never\ndo recover the same thing that you lose. It's always a new thing. The\nmoment it leaves you it's changed. Why, that's even true of a hat you\nchase after; and I don't mean superficially--I mean profoundly\nspeaking . . . I have made it a rule of my life never to regret and\nnever to look back. Regret is an appalling waste of energy, and no one\nwho intends to be a writer can afford to indulge in it. You can't get\nit into shape; you can't build on it; it's only good for wallowing in.\nLooking back, of course, is equally fatal to Art. It's keeping\nyourself poor. Art can't and won't stand poverty.\n\n_Je ne parle pas fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. Je ne parle pas fran\u00c3\u00a7ais._ All the while I\nwrote that last page my other self has been chasing up and down out in\nthe dark there. It left me just when I began to analyse my grand\nmoment, dashed off distracted, like a lost dog who thinks at last, at\nlast, he hears the familiar step again.\n\n\"Mouse! Mouse! Where are you? Are you near? Is that you leaning from\nthe high window and stretching out your arms for the wings of the\nshutters? Are you this soft bundle moving towards me through the\nfeathery snow? Are you this little girl pressing through the\nswing-doors of the restaurant? Is that your dark shadow bending\nforward in the cab? Where are you? Where are you? Which way must I\nturn? Which way shall I run? And every moment I stand here hesitating\nyou are farther away again. Mouse! Mouse!\"\n\nNow the poor dog has come back into the caf\u00c3\u00a9, his tail between his\nlegs, quite exhausted.\n\n\"It was a . . . false . . . alarm. She's nowhere . . . to . . . be\nseen.\"\n\n\"Lie down then! Lie down! Lie down!\"\n\n\n\nMy name is Raoul Duquette. I am twenty-six years old and a Parisian, a\ntrue Parisian. About my family--it really doesn't matter. I have no\nfamily; I don't want any. I never think about my childhood. I've\nforgotten it.\n\nIn fact, there's only one memory that stands out at all. That is\nrather interesting because it seems to me now so very significant as\nregards myself from the literary point of view. It is this.\n\nWhen I was about ten our laundress was an African woman, very big,\nvery dark, with a check handkerchief over her frizzy hair. When she\ncame to our house she always took particular notice of me, and after\nthe clothes had been taken out of the basket she would lift me up into\nit and give me a rock while I held tight to the handles and screamed\nfor joy and fright. I was tiny for my age, and pale, with a lovely\nlittle half-open mouth--I feel sure of that.\n\nOne day when I was standing at the door, watching her go, she turned\nround and beckoned to me, nodding and smiling in a strange secret way.\nI never thought of not following. She took me into a little outhouse\nat the end of the passage, caught me up in her arms and began kissing\nme. Ah, those kisses! Especially those kisses inside my ears that\nnearly deafened me.\n\nWhen she set me down she took from her pocket a little round fried\ncake covered with sugar, and I reeled along the passage back to our\ndoor.\n\nAs this performance was repeated once a week it is no wonder that I\nremember it so vividly. Besides, from that very first afternoon, my\nchildhood was, to put it prettily, \"kissed away.\" I became very\nlanguid, very caressing, and greedy beyond measure. And so quickened,\nso sharpened, I seemed to understand everybody and be able to do what\nI liked with everybody.\n\nI suppose I was in a state of more or less physical excitement, and\nthat was what appealed to them. For all Parisians are more than\nhalf--oh, well, enough of that. And enough of my childhood, too. Bury\nit under a laundry basket instead of a shower of roses and _passons\noultre._\n\n\n\nI date myself from the moment that I became the tenant of a small\nbachelor flat on the fifth floor of a tall, not too shabby house, in a\nstreet that might or might not be discreet. Very useful, that. . . .\nThere I emerged, came out into the light and put out my two horns with\na study and a bedroom and a kitchen on my back. And real furniture\nplanted in the rooms. In the bedroom a wardrobe with a long glass, a\nbig bed covered with a yellow puffed-up quilt, a bed table with a\nmarbled top and a toilet set sprinkled with tiny apples. In my\nstudy--English writing table with drawers, writing chair with leather\ncushions, books, arm-chair, side table with paper-knife and lamp on it\nand some nude studies on the walls. I didn't use the kitchen except to\nthrow old papers into.\n\nAh, I can see myself that first evening, after the furniture men had\ngone and I'd managed to get rid of my atrocious old concierge--walking\nabout on tip-toe, arranging and standing in front of the glass with my\nhands in my pockets and saying to that radiant vision: \"I am a young\nman who has his own flat. I write for two newspapers. I am going in\nfor serious literature. I am starting a career. The book that I shall\nbring out will simply stagger the critics. I am going to write about\nthings that have never been touched before. I am going to make a name\nfor myself as a writer about the submerged world. But not as others\nhave done before me. Oh, no! Very naively, with a sort of tender\nhumour and from the inside, as though it were all quite simple, quite\nnatural. I see my way quite perfectly. Nobody has ever done it as I\nshall do it because none of the others have lived my experiences. I'm\nrich--I'm rich.\"\n\nAll the same I had no more money than I have now. It's extraordinary\nhow one can live without money. . . . I have quantities of good\nclothes, silk underwear, two evening suits, four pairs of patent\nleather boots with light uppers, all sorts of little things, like\ngloves and powder boxes and a manicure set, perfumes, very good soap,\nand nothing is paid for. If I find myself in need of right-down\ncash--well, there's always an African laundress and an outhouse, and I\nam very frank and _bon enfant_ about plenty of sugar on the little\nfried cake afterwards. . . .\n\nAnd here I should like to put something on record. Not from any\nstrutting conceit, but rather with a mild sense of wonder. I've never\nyet made the first advances to any woman. It isn't as though I've\nknown only one class of woman--not by any means. But from little\nprostitutes and kept women and elderly widows and shop girls and wives\nof respectable men, and even advanced modern literary ladies at the\nmost select dinners and soir\u00c3\u00a9es (I've been there), I've met invariably\nwith not only the same readiness, but with the same positive\ninvitation. It surprised me at first. I used to look across the table\nand think \"Is that very distinguished young lady, discussing _le\nKipling_ with the gentleman with the brown beard, really pressing my\nfoot?\" And I was never really certain until I had pressed hers.\n\nCurious, isn't it? I don't look at all like a maiden's dream. . . .\n\nI am little and light with an olive skin, black eyes with long lashes,\nblack silky hair cut short, tiny square teeth that show when I smile.\nMy hands are supple and small. A woman in a bread shop once said to\nme: \"You have the hands for making fine little pastries.\" I confess,\nwithout any clothes I am rather charming. Plump, almost like a girl,\nwith smooth shoulders, and I wear a thin gold bracelet above my left\nelbow.\n\nBut, wait! Isn't it strange I should have written all that about my\nbody and so on? It's the result of my bad life, my submerged life. I\nam like a little woman in a caf\u00c3\u00a9 who has to introduce herself with a\nhandful of photographs. \"Me in my chemise, coming out of an eggshell.\n. . . Me upside down in a swing, with a frilly behind like a\ncauliflower. . . .\" You know the things.\n\n\n\nIf you think what I've written is merely superficial and impudent and\ncheap you're wrong. I'll admit it does sound so, but then it is not\nall. If it were, how could I have experienced what I did when I read\nthat stale little phrase written in green ink, in the writing-pad?\nThat proves there's more in me and that I really am important, doesn't\nit? Anything a fraction less than that moment of anguish I might have\nput on. But no! That was real.\n\n\"Waiter, a whisky.\"\n\nI hate whisky. Every time I take it into my mouth my stomach rises\nagainst it, and the stuff they keep here is sure to be particularly\nvile. I only ordered it because I am going to write about an\nEnglishman. We French are incredibly old-fashioned and out of date\nstill in some ways. I wonder I didn't ask him at the same time for a\npair of tweed knickerbockers, a pipe, some long teeth and a set of\nginger whiskers.\n\n\"Thanks, _mon vieux._ You haven't got perhaps a set of ginger\nwhiskers?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" he answers sadly. \"We don't sell American drinks.\"\n\nAnd having smeared a corner of the table he goes back to have another\ncouple of dozen taken by artificial light.\n\nUgh! The smell of it! And the sickly sensation when one's throat\ncontracts.\n\n\"It's bad stuff to get drunk on,\" says Dick Harmon, turning his little\nglass in his fingers and smiling his slow, dreaming smile. So he gets\ndrunk on it slowly and dreamily and at a certain moment begins to sing\nvery low, very low, about a man who walks up and down trying to find a\nplace where he can get some dinner.\n\nAh! how I loved that song, and how I loved the way he sang it, slowly,\nslowly, in a dark, soft voice:\n\n  There was a man\n  Walked up and down\n  To get a dinner in the town . . .\n\nIt seemed to hold, in its gravity and muffled measure, all those tall\ngrey buildings, those fogs, those endless streets, those sharp shadows\nof policemen that mean England.\n\nAnd then--the subject! The lean, starved creature walking up and down\nwith every house barred against him because he had no \"home.\" How\nextraordinarily English that is. . . . I remember that it ended where\nhe did at last \"find a place\" and ordered a little cake of fish, but\nwhen he asked for bread the waiter cried contemptuously, in a loud\nvoice: \"We don't serve bread with one fish ball.\"\n\nWhat more do you want? How profound those songs are! There is the\nwhole psychology of a people; and how un-French--how un-French!\n\n\"Once more, Deeck, once more!\" I would plead, clasping my hands and\nmaking a pretty mouth at him. He was perfectly content to sing it for\never.\n\n\n\nThere again. Even with Dick. It was he who made the first advances.\n\nI met him at an evening party given by the editor of a new review. It\nwas a very select, very fashionable affair. One or two of the older\nmen were there and the ladies were extremely _comme il faut._ They sat\non cubist sofas in full evening dress and allowed us to hand them\nthimbles of cherry brandy and to talk to them about their poetry. For,\nas far as I can remember, they were all poetesses.\n\nIt was impossible not to notice Dick. He was the only Englishman\npresent, and instead of circulating gracefully round the room as we\nall did, he stayed in one place leaning against the wall, his hands in\nhis pockets, that dreamy half smile on his lips, and replying in\nexcellent French in his low, soft voice to anybody who spoke to him.\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"An Englishman. From London. A writer. And he is making a special\nstudy of modern French literature.\"\n\nThat was enough for me. My little book, _False Coins_ had just been\npublished. I was a young serious writer who was making a special study\nof modern English literature.\n\nBut I really had not time to fling my line before he said, giving\nhimself a soft shake, coming right out of the water after the bait, as\nit were: \"Won't you come and see me at my hotel? Come about five\no'clock and we can have a talk before going out to dinner.\"\n\n\"Enchanted!\"\n\nI was so deeply, deeply flattered that I had to leave him then and\nthere to preen and preen myself before the cubist sofas. What a catch!\nAn Englishman, reserved, serious, making a special study of French\nliterature. . . .\n\nThat same night a copy of _False Coins_ with a carefully cordial\ninscription was posted off, and a day or two later we did dine\ntogether and spent the evening talking.\n\nTalking--but not only of literature. I discovered to my relief that it\nwasn't necessary to keep to the tendency of the modern novel, the need\nof a new form, or the reason why our young men appeared to be just\nmissing it. Now and again, as if by accident, I threw in a card that\nseemed to have nothing to do with the game, just to see how he'd take\nit. But each time he gathered it into his hands with his dreamy look\nand smile unchanged. Perhaps he murmured: \"That's very curious.\" But\nnot as if it were curious at all.\n\nThat calm acceptance went to my head at last. It fascinated me. It led\nme on and on till I threw every card that I possessed at him and sat\nback and watched him arrange them in his hand.\n\n\"Very curious and interesting. . . .\"\n\nBy that time we were both fairly drunk, and he began to sing his song\nvery soft, very low, about the man who walked up and down seeking his\ndinner.\n\nBut I was quite breathless at the thought of what I had done. I had\nshown somebody both sides of my life. Told him everything as sincerely\nand truthfully as I could. Taken immense pains to explain things about\nmy submerged life that really were disgusting and never could possibly\nsee the light of literary day. On the whole I had made myself out far\nworse than I was--more boastful, more cynical, more calculating.\n\nAnd there sat the man I had confided in, singing to himself and\nsmiling. . . . It moved me so that real tears came into my eyes. I saw\nthem glittering on my long silky lashes--so charming.\n\n\n\nAfter that I took Dick about with me everywhere, and he came to my\nflat, and sat in the arm-chair, very indolent, playing with the\npaper-knife. I cannot think why his indolence and dreaminess always\ngave me the impression he had been to sea. And all his leisurely slow\nways seemed to be allowing for the movement of the ship. This\nimpression was so strong that often when we were together and he got\nup and left a little woman just when she did not expect him to get up\nand leave her, but quite the contrary, I would explain: \"He can't help\nit, Baby. He has to go back to his ship.\" And I believed it far more\nthan she did.\n\nAll the while we were together Dick never went with a woman. I\nsometimes wondered whether he wasn't completely innocent. Why didn't I\nask him? Because I never did ask him anything about himself. But late\none night he took out his pocket-book and a photograph dropped out of\nit. I picked it up and glanced at it before I gave it to him. It was\nof a woman. Not quite young. Dark, handsome, wild-looking, but so full\nin every line of a kind of haggard pride that even if Dick had not\nstretched out so quickly I wouldn't have looked longer.\n\n\"Out of my sight, you little perfumed fox-terrier of a Frenchman,\"\nsaid she.\n\n(In my very worst moments my nose reminds me of a fox-terrier's.)\n\n\"That is my Mother,\" said Dick, putting up the pocket-book.\n\nBut if he had not been Dick I should have been tempted to cross\nmyself, just for fun.\n\n\n\nThis is how we parted. As we stood outside his hotel one night waiting\nfor the concierge to release the catch of the outer door, he said,\nlooking up at the sky: \"I hope it will be fine to-morrow. I am leaving\nfor England in the morning.\"\n\n\"You're not serious.\"\n\n\"Perfectly. I have to get back. I've some work to do that I can't\nmanage here.\"\n\n\"But--but have you made all your preparations?\"\n\n\"Preparations?\" He almost grinned. \"I've none to make.\"\n\n\"But--_enfin_, Dick, England is not the other side of the boulevard.\"\n\n\"It isn't much farther off,\" said he. \"Only a few hours, you know.\"\nThe door cracked open.\n\n\"Ah, I wish I'd known at the beginning of the evening!\"\n\nI felt hurt. I felt as a woman must feel when a man takes out his\nwatch and remembers an appointment that cannot possibly concern her,\nexcept that its claim is the stronger. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nHe put out his hand and stood, lightly swaying upon the step as though\nthe whole hotel were his ship, and the anchor weighed.\n\n\"I forgot. Truly I did. But you'll write, won't you? Good night, old\nchap. I'll be over again one of these days.\"\n\nAnd then I stood on the shore alone, more like a little fox-terrier\nthan ever. . . .\n\n\"But after all it was you who whistled to me, you who asked me to\ncome! What a spectacle I've cut wagging my tail and leaping round you,\nonly to be left like this while the boat sails off in its slow, dreamy\nway. . . . Curse these English! No, this is too insolent altogether.\nWho do you imagine I am? A little paid guide to the night pleasures of\nParis? . . . No, monsieur. I am a young writer, very serious, and\nextremely interested in modern English literature. And I have been\ninsulted--insulted.\"\n\n\n\nTwo days after came a long, charming letter from him, written in\nFrench that was a shade too French, but saying how he missed me and\ncounted on our friendship, on keeping in touch.\n\nI read it standing in front of the (unpaid for) wardrobe mirror. It\nwas early morning. I wore a blue kimono embroidered with white birds\nand my hair was still wet; it lay on my forehead, wet and gleaming.\n\n\"Portrait of Madame Butterfly,\" said I, \"on hearing of the arrival of\n_ce cher Pinkerton_.\"\n\nAccording to the books I should have felt immensely relieved and\ndelighted. \". . . Going over to the window he drew apart the curtains\nand looked out at the Paris trees, just breaking into buds and green.\n. . . Dick! Dick! My English friend!\"\n\nI didn't. I merely felt a little sick. Having been up for my first\nride in an aeroplane I didn't want to go up again, just now.\n\n\n\nThat passed, and months after, in the winter, Dick wrote that he was\ncoming back to Paris to stay indefinitely. Would I take rooms for him?\nHe was bringing a woman friend with him.\n\nOf course I would. Away the little fox-terrier flew. It happened most\nusefully, too; for I owed much money at the hotel where I took my\nmeals, and two English people requiring rooms for an indefinite time\nwas an excellent sum on account.\n\nPerhaps I did rather wonder, as I stood in the larger of the two rooms\nwith Madame, saying \"Admirable,\" what the woman friend would be like,\nbut only vaguely. Either she would be very severe, flat back and\nfront, or she would be tall, fair, dressed in mignonette green,\nname--Daisy, and smelling of rather sweetish lavender water.\n\nYou see, by this time, according to my rule of not looking back, I had\nalmost forgotten Dick. I even got the tune of his song about the\nunfortunate man a little bit wrong when I tried to hum it. . . .\n\n\n\nI very nearly did not turn up at the station after all. I had arranged\nto, and had, in fact, dressed with particular care for the occasion.\nFor I intended to take a new line with Dick this time. No more\nconfidences and tears on eyelashes. No, thank you!\n\n\"Since you left Paris,\" said I, knotting my black silver-spotted tie\nin the (also unpaid for) mirror over the mantelpiece, \"I have been\nvery successful, you know. I have two more books in preparation, and\nthen I have written a serial story, _Wrong Doors_, which is just on\nthe point of publication and will bring me in a lot of money. And then\nmy little book of poems,\" I cried, seizing the clothes-brush and\nbrushing the velvet collar of my new indigo-blue overcoat, \"my little\nbook--_Left Umbrellas_--really did create,\" and I laughed and waved\nthe brush, \"an immense sensation!\"\n\nIt was impossible not to believe this of the person who surveyed\nhimself finally, from top to toe, drawing on his soft grey gloves. He\nwas looking the part; he was the part.\n\nThat gave me an idea. I took out my notebook, and still in full view,\njotted down a note or two. . . . How can one look the part and not be\nthe part? Or be the part and not look it? Isn't looking--being? Or\nbeing--looking? At any rate who is to say that it is not? . . .\n\nThis seemed to me extraordinarily profound at the time, and quite new.\nBut I confess that something did whisper as, smiling, I put up the\nnotebook: \"You--literary? you look as though you've taken down a bet\non a racecourse!\" But I didn't listen. I went out, shutting the door\nof the flat with a soft, quick pull so as not to warn the concierge of\nmy departure, and ran down the stairs quick as a rabbit for the same\nreason.\n\n\n\nBut ah! the old spider. She was too quick for me. She let me run down\nthe last little ladder of the web and then she pounced. \"One moment.\nOne little moment, Monsieur,\" she whispered, odiously confidential.\n\"Come in. Come in.\" And she beckoned with a dripping soup ladle. I\nwent to the door, but that was not good enough. Right inside and the\ndoor shut before she would speak.\n\nThere are two ways of managing your concierge if you haven't any\nmoney. One is--to take the high hand, make her your enemy, bluster,\nrefuse to discuss anything; the other is--to keep in with her, butter\nher up to the two knots of the black rag tying up her jaws, pretend to\nconfide in her, and rely on her to arrange with the gas man and to put\noff the landlord.\n\nI had tried the second. But both are equally detestable and\nunsuccessful. At any rate whichever you're trying is the worse, the\nimpossible one.\n\nIt was the landlord this time. . . . Imitation of the landlord by the\nconcierge threatening to toss me out. . . . Imitation of the concierge\nby the concierge taming the wild bull. . . . Imitation of the landlord\nrampant again, breathing in the concierge's face. I was the concierge.\nNo, it was too nauseous. And all the while the black pot on the gas\nring bubbling away, stewing out the hearts and livers of every tenant\nin the place.\n\n\"Ah!\" I cried, staring at the clock on the mantelpiece, and then,\nrealizing that it didn't go, striking my forehead as though the idea\nhad nothing to do with it. \"Madame, I have a very important\nappointment with the director of my newspaper at nine-thirty. Perhaps\nto-morrow I shall be able to give you . . .\"\n\nOut, out. And down the m\u00c3\u00a9tro and squeezed into a full carriage. The\nmore the better. Everybody was one bolster the more between me and the\nconcierge. I was radiant.\n\n\"Ah! pardon, Monsieur!\" said the tall charming creature in black with\na big full bosom and a great bunch of violets dropping from it. As the\ntrain swayed it thrust the bouquet right into my eyes. \"Ah! pardon,\nMonsieur!\"\n\nBut I looked up at her, smiling mischievously.\n\n\"There is nothing I love more, Madame, than flowers on a balcony.\"\n\nAt the very moment of speaking I caught sight of the huge man in a fur\ncoat against whom my charmer was leaning. He poked his head over her\nshoulder and he went white to the nose; in fact his nose stood out a\nsort of cheese green.\n\n\"What was that you said to my wife?\"\n\nGare Saint Lazare saved me. But you'll own that even as the author of\n_False Coins_, _Wrong Doors_, _Left Umbrellas_, and two in\npreparation, it was not too easy to go on my triumphant way.\n\n\n\nAt length, after countless trains had steamed into my mind, and\ncountless Dick Harmons had come rolling towards me, the real train\ncame. The little knot of us waiting at the barrier moved up close,\ncraned forward, and broke into cries as though we were some kind of\nmany-headed monster, and Paris behind us nothing but a great trap we\nhad set to catch these sleepy innocents.\n\nInto the trap they walked and were snatched and taken off to be\ndevoured. Where was my prey?\n\n\"Good God!\" My smile and my lifted hand fell together. For one\nterrible moment I thought this was the woman of the photograph, Dick's\nmother, walking towards me in Dick's coat and hat. In the effort--and\nyou saw what an effort it was--to smile, his lips curled in just the\nsame way and he made for me, haggard and wild and proud.\n\nWhat had happened? What could have changed him like this? Should I\nmention it?\n\nI waited for him and was even conscious of venturing a fox-terrier wag\nor two to see if he could possibly respond, in the way I said: \"Good\nevening, Dick! How are you, old chap? All right?\"\n\n\"All right. All right.\" He almost gasped. \"You've got the rooms?\"\n\nTwenty times, good God! I saw it all. Light broke on the dark waters\nand my sailor hadn't been drowned. I almost turned a somersault with\namusement.\n\nIt was nervousness, of course. It was embarrassment. It was the famous\nEnglish seriousness. What fun I was going to have! I could have hugged\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, I've got the rooms,\" I nearly shouted. \"But where is Madame?\"\n\n\"She's been looking after the luggage,\" he panted. \"Here she comes,\nnow.\"\n\nNot this baby walking beside the old porter as though he were her\nnurse and had just lifted her out of her ugly perambulator while he\ntrundled the boxes on it.\n\n\"And she's not Madame,\" said Dick, drawling suddenly.\n\nAt that moment she caught sight of him and hailed him with her minute\nmuff. She broke away from her nurse and ran up and said something,\nvery quick, in English; but he replied in French: \"Oh, very well. I'll\nmanage.\"\n\nBut before he turned to the porter he indicated me with a vague wave\nand muttered something. We were introduced. She held out her hand in\nthat strange boyish way Englishwomen do, and standing very straight in\nfront of me with her chin raised and making--she too--the effort of\nher life to control her preposterous excitement, she said, wringing my\nhand (I'm sure she didn't know it was mine), _Je ne parle pas\nFran\u00c3\u00a7ais._\n\n\"But I'm sure you do,\" I answered, so tender, so reassuring, I might\nhave been a dentist about to draw her first little milk tooth.\n\n\"Of course she does.\" Dick swerved back to us. \"Here, can't we get a\ncab or taxi or something? We don't want to stay in this cursed station\nall night. Do we?\"\n\nThis was so rude that it took me a moment to recover; and he must have\nnoticed, for he flung his arm round my shoulder in the old way,\nsaying: \"Ah, forgive me, old chap. But we've had such a loathsome,\nhideous journey. We've taken years to come. Haven't we?\" To her. But\nshe did not answer. She bent her head and began stroking her grey\nmuff; she walked beside us stroking her grey muff all the way.\n\n\"Have I been wrong?\" thought I. \"Is this simply a case of frenzied\nimpatience on their part? Are they merely 'in need of a bed,' as we\nsay? Have they been suffering agonies on the journey? Sitting,\nperhaps, very close and warm under the same travelling rug?\" and so on\nand so on while the driver strapped on the boxes. That done----\n\n\"Look here, Dick. I go home by m\u00c3\u00a9tro. Here is the address of your\nhotel. Everything is arranged. Come and see me as soon as you can.\"\n\nUpon my life I thought he was going to faint. He went white to the\nlips.\n\n\"But you're coming back with us,\" he cried. \"I thought it was all\nsettled. Of course you're coming back. You're not going to leave us.\"\nNo, I gave it up. It was too difficult, too English for me.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly. Delighted. I only thought, perhaps . . .\"\n\n\"You must come!\" said Dick to the little fox-terrier. And again he\nmade that big awkward turn towards her.\n\n\"Get in, Mouse.\"\n\nAnd Mouse got in the black hole and sat stroking Mouse II and not\nsaying a word.\n\n\n\nAway we jolted and rattled like three little dice that life had\ndecided to have a fling with.\n\nI had insisted on taking the flap seat facing them because I would not\nhave missed for anything those occasional flashing glimpses I had as\nwe broke through the white circles of lamplight.\n\nThey revealed Dick, sitting far back in his corner, his coat collar\nturned up, his hands thrust in his pockets, and his broad dark hat\nshading him as if it were a part of him--a sort of wing he hid under.\nThey showed her, sitting up very straight, her lovely little face more\nlike a drawing than a real face--every line was so full of meaning and\nso sharp cut against the swimming dark.\n\nFor Mouse was beautiful. She was exquisite, but so fragile and fine\nthat each time I looked at her it was as if for the first time. She\ncame upon you with the same kind of shock that you feel when you have\nbeen drinking tea out of a thin innocent cup and suddenly, at the\nbottom, you see a tiny creature, half butterfly, half woman, bowing to\nyou with her hands in her sleeves.\n\nAs far as I could make out she had dark hair and blue or black eyes.\nHer long lashes and the two little feathers traced above were most\nimportant.\n\nShe wore a long dark cloak such as one sees in old-fashioned pictures\nof Englishwomen abroad. Where her arms came out of it there was grey\nfur--fur round her neck, too, and her close-fitting cap was furry.\n\n\"Carrying out the mouse idea,\" I decided.\n\n\n\nAh, but how intriguing it was--how intriguing! Their excitement came\nnearer and nearer to me, while I ran out to meet it, bathed in it,\nflung myself far out of my depth, until at last I was as hard put to\nit to keep control as they.\n\nBut what I wanted to do was to behave in the most extraordinary\nfashion--like a clown. To start singing, with large extravagant\ngestures, to point out of the window and cry: \"We are now passing,\nladies and gentlemen, one of the sights for which _notre Paris_ is\njustly famous,\" to jump out of the taxi while it was going, climb over\nthe roof and dive in by another door; to hang out of the window and\nlook for the hotel through the wrong end of a broken telescope, which\nwas also a peculiarly ear-splitting trumpet.\n\nI watched myself do all this, you understand, and even managed to\napplaud in a private way by putting my gloved hands gently together,\nwhile I said to Mouse: \"And is this your first visit to Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've not been here before.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you have a great deal to see.\"\n\nAnd I was just going to touch lightly upon the objects of interest and\nthe museums when we wrenched to a stop.\n\n\n\nDo you know--it's very absurd--but as I pushed open the door for them\nand followed up the stairs to the bureau on the landing I felt somehow\nthat this hotel was mine.\n\nThere was a vase of flowers on the window sill of the bureau and I\neven went so far as to re-arrange a bud or two and to stand off and\nnote the effect while the manageress welcomed them. And when she\nturned to me and handed me the keys (the _gar\u00c3\u00a7on_ was hauling up the\nboxes) and said: \"Monsieur Duquette will show you your rooms\"--I had a\nlonging to tap Dick on the arm with a key and say, very\nconfidentially: \"Look here, old chap. As a friend of mine I'll be only\ntoo willing to make a slight reduction . . .\"\n\nUp and up we climbed. Round and round. Past an occasional pair of\nboots (why is it one never sees an attractive pair of boots outside a\ndoor?). Higher and higher.\n\n\"I'm afraid they're rather high up,\" I murmured idiotically. \"But I\nchose them because . . .\"\n\nThey so obviously did not care why I chose them that I went no\nfurther. They accepted everything. They did not expect anything to be\ndifferent. This was just part of what they were going through--that\nwas how I analysed it.\n\n\"Arrived at last.\" I ran from one side of the passage to the other,\nturning on the lights, explaining.\n\n\"This one I thought for you, Dick. The other is larger and it has a\nlittle dressing-room in the alcove.\"\n\nMy \"proprietary\" eye noted the clean towels and covers, and the bed\nlinen embroidered in red cotton. I thought them rather charming rooms,\nsloping, full of angles, just the sort of rooms one would expect to\nfind if one had not been to Paris before.\n\nDick dashed his hat down on the bed.\n\n\"Oughtn't I to help that chap with the boxes?\" he asked--nobody.\n\n\"Yes, you ought,\" replied Mouse, \"they're dreadfully heavy.\"\n\nAnd she turned to me with the first glimmer of a smile: \"Books, you\nknow.\" Oh, he darted such a strange look at her before he rushed out.\nAnd he not only helped, he must have torn the box off the _gar\u00c3\u00a7on's_\nback, for he staggered back, carrying one, dumped it down and then\nfetched in the other.\n\n\"That's yours, Dick,\" said she.\n\n\"Well, you don't mind it standing here for the present, do you?\" he\nasked, breathless, breathing hard (the box must have been tremendously\nheavy). He pulled out a handful of money. \"I suppose I ought to pay\nthis chap.\"\n\nThe _gar\u00c3\u00a7on_, standing by, seemed to think so too.\n\n\"And will you require anything further, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"No! No!\" said Dick impatiently.\n\nBut at that Mouse stepped forward. She said, too deliberately, not\nlooking at Dick, with her quaint clipped English accent: \"Yes, I'd\nlike some tea. Tea for three.\"\n\nAnd suddenly she raised her muff as though her hands were clasped\ninside it, and she was telling the pale, sweaty _gar\u00c3\u00a7on_ by that\naction that she was at the end of her resources, that she cried out to\nhim to save her with \"Tea. Immediately!\"\n\n\n\nThis seemed to me so amazingly in the picture, so exactly the gesture\nand cry that one would expect (though I couldn't have imagined it) to\nbe wrung out of an Englishwoman faced with a great crisis, that I was\nalmost tempted to hold up my hand and protest.\n\n\"No! No! Enough. Enough. Let us leave off there. At the word--tea. For\nreally, really, you've filled your greediest subscriber so full that\nhe will burst if he has to swallow another word.\"\n\nIt even pulled Dick up. Like someone who has been unconscious for a\nlong long time he turned slowly to Mouse and slowly looked at her with\nhis tired, haggard eyes, and murmured with the echo of his dreamy\nvoice: \"Yes. That's a good idea.\" And then: \"You must be tired, Mouse.\nSit down.\"\n\nShe sat down in a chair with lace tabs on the arms; he leaned against\nthe bed, and I established myself on a straight-backed chair, crossed\nmy legs and brushed some imaginary dust off the knees of my trousers.\n(The Parisian at his ease.)\n\nThere came a tiny pause. Then he said: \"Won't you take off your coat.\nMouse?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. Not just now.\"\n\nWere they going to ask me? Or should I hold up my hand and call out in\na baby voice: \"It's my turn to be asked.\"\n\nNo, I shouldn't. They didn't ask me.\n\nThe pause became a silence. A real silence.\n\n\". . . Come, my Parisian fox-terrier! Amuse these sad English! It's no\nwonder they are such a nation for dogs.\"\n\nBut, after all--why should I? It was not my \"job,\" as they would say.\nNevertheless, I made a vivacious little bound at Mouse.\n\n\"What a pity it is that you did not arrive by daylight. There is such\na charming view from these two windows. You know, the hotel is on a\ncorner and each window looks down an immensely long, straight street.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.\n\n\"Not that that sounds very charming,\" I laughed. \"But there is so much\nanimation--so many absurd little boys on bicycles and people hanging\nout of windows and--oh, well, you'll see for yourself in the morning.\n. . . Very amusing. Very animated.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said she.\n\nIf the pale, sweaty _gar\u00c3\u00a7on_ had not come in at that moment, carrying\nthe tea-tray high on one hand as if the cups were cannon-balls and he\na heavy weight lifter on the cinema. . . .\n\nHe managed to lower it on to a round table.\n\n\"Bring the table over here,\" said Mouse. The waiter seemed to be the\nonly person she cared to speak to. She took her hands out of her muff,\ndrew off her gloves and flung back the old-fashioned cape.\n\n\"Do you take milk and sugar?\"\n\n\"No milk, thank you, and no sugar.\"\n\nI went over for mine like a little gentleman. She poured out another\ncup.\n\n\"That's for Dick.\"\n\nAnd the faithful fox-terrier carried it across to him and laid it at\nhis feet, as it were.\n\n\"Oh, thanks,\" said Dick.\n\nAnd then I went back to my chair and she sank back in hers.\n\nBut Dick was off again. He stared wildly at the cup of tea for a\nmoment, glanced round him, put it down on the bed-table, caught up his\nhat and stammered at full gallop: \"Oh, by the way, do you mind posting\na letter for me? I want to get it off by to-night's post. I must. It's\nvery urgent. . . .\" Feeling her eyes on him, he flung: \"It's to my\nmother.\" To me: \"I won't be long. I've got everything I want. But it\nmust go off to-night You don't mind? It . . . it won't take any time.\"\n\n\"Of course I'll post it. Delighted.\"\n\n\"Won't you drink your tea first?\" suggested Mouse softly.\n\n. . . Tea? Tea? Yes, of course. Tea. . . . A cup of tea on the\nbed-table. . . . In his racing dream he flashed the brightest, most\ncharming smile at his little hostess.\n\n\"No, thanks. Not just now.\"\n\nAnd still hoping it would not be any trouble to me he went out of the\nroom and closed the door, and we heard him cross the passage.\n\n\n\nI scalded myself with mine in my hurry to take the cup back to the\ntable and to say as I stood there: \"You must forgive me if I am\nimpertinent . . . if I am too frank. But Dick hasn't tried to disguise\nit--has he? There is something the matter. Can I help?\"\n\n(Soft music. Mouse gets up, walks the stage for a moment or so before\nshe returns to her chair and pours him out, oh, such a brimming, such\na burning cup that the tears come into the friend's eyes while he\nsips--while he drains it to the bitter dregs. . . .)\n\nI had time to do all this before she replied. First she looked in the\nteapot, filled it with hot water, and stirred it with a spoon.\n\n\"Yes, there is something the matter. No, I'm afraid you can't help,\nthank you.\" Again I got that glimmer of a smile. \"I'm awfully sorry.\nIt must be horrid for you.\"\n\nHorrid, indeed! Ah, why couldn't I tell her that it was months and\nmonths since I had been so entertained?\n\n\"But you are suffering,\" I ventured softly, as though that was what I\ncould not bear to see.\n\nShe didn't deny it. She nodded and bit her under-lip and I thought I\nsaw her chin tremble.\n\n\"And there is really nothing I can do?\" More softly still.\n\nShe shook her head, pushed back the table and jumped up.\n\n\"Oh, it will be all right soon,\" she breathed, walking over to the\ndressing-table and standing with her back towards me. \"It will be all\nright. It can't go on like this.\"\n\n\"But of course it can't.\" I agreed, wondering whether it would look\nheartless if I lit a cigarette; I had a sudden longing to smoke.\n\nIn some way she saw my hand move to my breast pocket, half draw out my\ncigarette case and put it back again, for the next thing she said was:\n\"Matches . . . in . . . candlestick. I noticed them.\"\n\nAnd I heard from her voice that she was crying.\n\n\n\n\"Ah! thank you. Yes. Yes. I've found them.\" I lighted my cigarette and\nwalked up and down, smoking.\n\nIt was so quiet it might have been two o'clock in the morning. It was\nso quiet you heard the boards creak and pop as one does in a house in\nthe country. I smoked the whole cigarette and stabbed the end into my\nsaucer before Mouse turned round and came back to the table.\n\n\"Isn't Dick being rather a long time?\"\n\n\"You are very tired. I expect you want to go to bed,\" I said kindly.\n(And pray don't mind me if you do, said my mind.)\n\n\"But isn't he being a very long time?\" she insisted.\n\nI shrugged. \"He is, rather.\"\n\nThen I saw she looked at me strangely. She was listening.\n\n\"He's been gone ages,\" she said, and she went with little light steps\nto the door, opened it, and crossed the passage into his room.\n\nI waited. I listened too, now. I couldn't have borne to miss a word.\nShe had left the door open. I stole across the room and looked after\nher. Dick's door was open, too. But--there wasn't a word to miss.\n\nYou know I had the mad idea that they were kissing in that quiet\nroom--a long comfortable kiss. One of those kisses that not only puts\none's grief to bed, but nurses it and warms it and tucks it up and\nkeeps it fast enfolded until it is sleeping sound. Ah! how good that\nis.\n\nIt was over at last. I heard some one move and tip-toed away.\n\nIt was Mouse. She came back. She felt her way into the room carrying\nthe letter for me. But it wasn't in an envelope; it was just a sheet\nof paper and she held it by the corner as though it was still wet.\n\nHer head was bent so low--so tucked in her furry collar that I hadn't\na notion--until she let the paper fall and almost fell herself on to\nthe floor by the side of the bed, leaned her cheek against it, flung\nout her hands as though the last of her poor little weapons was gone\nand now she let herself be carried away, washed out into the deep\nwater.\n\nFlash! went my mind. Dick has shot himself, and then a succession of\nflashes while I rushed in, saw the body, head unharmed, small blue\nhole over temple, roused hotel, arranged funeral, attended funeral,\nclosed cab, new morning coat. . . .\n\nI stooped down and picked up the paper and would you believe it--so\ningrained is my Parisian sense of _comme il faut_--I murmured \"pardon\"\nbefore I read it.\n\n\n\"MOUSE, MY LITTLE MOUSE,\n\nIt's no good. It's impossible. I can't see it through. Oh, I do love\nyou. I do love you. Mouse, but I can't hurt her. People have been\nhurting her all her life. I simply dare not give her this final blow.\nYou see, though she's stronger than both of us, she's so frail and\nproud. It would kill her--kill her, Mouse. And, oh God, I can't kill\nmy mother! Not even for you. Not even for us. You do see that--don't\nyou.\n\nIt all seemed so possible when we talked and planned, but the very\nmoment the train started it was all over. I felt her drag me back to\nher--calling. I can hear her now as I write. And she's alone and she\ndoesn't know. A man would have to be a devil to tell her and I'm not a\ndevil, Mouse. She mustn't know. Oh, Mouse, somewhere, somewhere in you\ndon't you agree? It's all so unspeakably awful that I don't know if I\nwant to go or not. Do I? Or is Mother just dragging me? I don't know.\nMy head is too tired. Mouse, Mouse--what will you do? But I can't\nthink of that, either. I dare not. I'd break down. And I must not\nbreak down. All I've got to do is--just to tell you this and go. I\ncouldn't have gone off without telling you. You'd have been\nfrightened. And you must not be frightened. You won't--will you? I\ncan't bear--but no more of that. And don't write. I should not have\nthe courage to answer your letters and the sight of your spidery\nhandwriting----\n\nForgive me. Don't love me any more. Yes. Love me. Love me. Dick.\"\n\n\nWhat do you think of that? Wasn't that a rare find? My relief at his\nnot having shot himself was mixed with a wonderful sense of elation. I\nwas even--more than even with my \"that's very curious and interesting\"\nEnglishman. . . .\n\nShe wept so strangely. With her eyes shut, with her face quite calm\nexcept for the quivering eyelids. The tears pearled down her cheeks\nand she let them fall.\n\nBut feeling my glance upon her she opened her eyes and saw me holding\nthe letter.\n\n\"You've read it?\"\n\nHer voice was quite calm, but it was not her voice any more. It was\nlike the voice you might imagine coming out of a tiny, cold sea-shell\nswept high and dry at last by the salt tide. . . .\n\nI nodded, quite overcome, you understand, and laid the letter down.\n\n\"It's incredible! incredible!\" I whispered.\n\nAt that she got up from the floor, walked over to the wash-stand,\ndipped her handkerchief into the jug and sponged her eyes, saying:\n\"Oh, no. It's not incredible at all.\" And still pressing the wet ball\nto her eyes she came back to me, to her chair with the lace tabs, and\nsank into it.\n\n\"I knew all along, of course,\" said the cold, salty little voice.\n\"From the very moment that we started. I felt it all through me, but I\nstill went on hoping--\" and here she took the handkerchief down and\ngave me a final glimmer--\"as one so stupidly does, you know.\"\n\n\"As one does.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"But what will you do? You'll go back? You'll see him?\"\n\nThat made her sit right up and stare across at me.\n\n\"What an extraordinary idea!\" she said, more coldly than ever. \"Of\ncourse I shall not dream of seeing him. As for going back--that is\nquite out of the question. I can't go back.\"\n\n\"But . . .\"\n\n\"It's impossible. For one thing all my friends think I am married.\"\n\nI put out my hand--\"Ah, my poor little friend.\"\n\nBut she shrank away. (False move.)\n\nOf course there was one question that had been at the back of my mind\nall this time. I hated it.\n\n\"Have you any money?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have twenty pounds--here,\" and she put her hand on her breast.\nI bowed. It was great deal more than I had expected.\n\n\"And what are your plans?\"\n\nYes, I know. My question was the most clumsy, the most idiotic one I\ncould have put. She had been so tame, so confiding, letting me, at any\nrate spiritually speaking, hold her tiny quivering body in one hand\nand stroke her furry head--and now, I'd thrown her away. Oh, I could\nhave kicked myself.\n\nShe stood up. \"I have no plans. But--it's very late. You must go now,\nplease.\"\n\nHow could I get her back? I wanted her back. I swear I was not acting\nthen.\n\n\"Do feel that I am your friend,\" I cried. \"You will let me come\nto-morrow, early? You will let me look after you a little--take care\nof you a little? You'll use me just as you think fit?\"\n\nI succeeded. She came out of her hole . . . timid . . . but she came\nout.\n\n\"Yes, you're very kind. Yes. Do come to-morrow. I shall be glad. It\nmakes things rather difficult because--\" and again I clasped her\nboyish hand--\"_je ne parle pas fran\u00c3\u00a7ais._\"\n\nNot until I was half-way down the boulevard did it come over me--the\nfull force of it.\n\nWhy, they were suffering . . . those two . . . really suffering. I\nhave seen two people suffer as I don't suppose I ever shall again.\n. . .\n\n\n\nOf course you know what to expect. You anticipate, fully, what I am\ngoing to write. It wouldn't be me, otherwise.\n\nI never went near the place again.\n\nYes, I still owe that considerable amount for lunches and dinners, but\nthat's beside the mark. It's vulgar to mention it in the same breath\nwith the fact that I never saw Mouse again.\n\nNaturally, I intended to. Started out--got to the door--wrote and tore\nup letters--did all those things. But I simply could not make the\nfinal effort.\n\nEven now I don't fully understand why. Of course I knew that I\ncouldn't have kept it up. That had a great deal to do with it. But you\nwould have thought, putting it at its lowest, curiosity couldn't have\nkept my fox-terrier nose away . . .\n\n_Je ne parle pas fran\u00c3\u00a7ais._ That was her swan song for me.\n\n\n\nBut how she makes me break my rule. Oh, you've seen for yourself, but\nI could give you countless examples.\n\n. . . Evenings, when I sit in some gloomy caf\u00c3\u00a9, and an automatic piano\nstarts playing a \"mouse\" tune (there are dozens of tunes that evoke\njust her) I begin to dream things like . . .\n\nA little house on the edge of the sea, somewhere far, far away. A girl\noutside in a frock rather like Red Indian women wear, hailing a light,\nbarefoot boy who runs up from the beach.\n\n\"What have you got?\"\n\n\"A fish.\" I smile and give it to her.\n\n. . . The same girl, the same boy, different costumes--sitting at an\nopen window, eating fruit and leaning out and laughing.\n\n\"All the wild strawberries are for you, Mouse. I won't touch one.\"\n\n. . . A wet night. They are going home together under an umbrella.\nThey stop on the door to press their wet cheeks together.\n\n\n\nAnd so on and so on until some dirty old gallant comes up to my table\nand sits opposite and begins to grimace and yap. Until I hear myself\nsaying: \"But I've got the little girl for you, _mon vieux._ So little\n. . . so tiny.\" I kiss the tips of my fingers and lay them upon my\nheart. \"I give you my word of honour as a gentleman, a writer,\nserious, young, and extremely interested in modern English\nliterature.\"\n\n\n\nI must go. I must go. I reach down my coat and hat. Madame knows me.\n\"You haven't dined yet?\" she smiles.\n\n\"No, not yet, Madame.\"\n\n\n\n\nBLISS\n\nALTHOUGH Bertha Young was thirty she still had moments like this when\nshe wanted to run instead of walk, to take dancing steps on and off\nthe pavement, to bowl a hoop, to throw something up in the air and\ncatch it again, or to stand still and laugh at--nothing--at nothing,\nsimply.\n\nWhat can you do if you are thirty and, turning the corner of your own\nstreet, you are overcome, suddenly, by a feeling of bliss--absolute\nbliss!--as though you'd suddenly swallowed a bright piece of that late\nafternoon sun and it burned in your bosom, sending out a little shower\nof sparks into every particle, into every finger and toe? . . .\n\nOh, is there no way you can express it without being \"drunk and\ndisorderly\"? How idiotic civilization is! Why be given a body if you\nhave to keep it shut up in a case like a rare, rare fiddle?\n\n\"No, that about the fiddle is not quite what I mean,\" she thought,\nrunning up the steps and feeling in her bag for the key--she'd\nforgotten it, as usual--and rattling the letter-box. \"It's not what I\nmean, because---- Thank you, Mary\"--she went into the hall. \"Is nurse\nback?\"\n\n\"Yes, M'm.\"\n\n\"And has the fruit come?\"\n\n\"Yes, M'm. Everything's come.\"\n\n\"Bring the fruit up to the dining-room, will you? I'll arrange it\nbefore I go upstairs.\"\n\nIt was dusky in the dining-room and quite chilly. But all the same\nBertha threw off her coat; she could not bear the tight clasp of it\nanother moment, and the cold air fell on her arms.\n\nBut in her bosom there was still that bright glowing place--that\nshower of little sparks coming from it. It was almost unbearable. She\nhardly dared to breathe for fear of fanning it higher, and yet she\nbreathed deeply, deeply. She hardly dared to look into the cold\nmirror--but she did look, and it gave her back a woman, radiant, with\nsmiling, trembling lips, with big, dark eyes and an air of listening,\nwaiting for something . . . divine to happen . . . that she knew must\nhappen . . . infallibly.\n\nMary brought in the fruit on a tray and with it a glass bowl, and a\nblue dish, very lovely, with a strange sheen on it as though it had\nbeen dipped in milk.\n\n\"Shall I turn on the light, M'm?\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I can see quite well.\"\n\nThere were tangerines and apples stained with strawberry pink. Some\nyellow pears, smooth as silk, some white grapes covered with a silver\nbloom and a big cluster of purple ones. These last she had bought to\ntone in with the new dining-room carpet. Yes, that did sound rather\nfar-fetched and absurd, but it was really why she had bought them. She\nhad thought in the shop: \"I must have some purple ones to bring the\ncarpet up to the table.\" And it had seemed quite sense at the time.\n\nWhen she had finished with them and had made two pyramids of these\nbright round shapes, she stood away from the table to get the\neffect--and it really was most curious. For the dark table seemed to\nmelt into the dusky light and the glass dish and the blue bowl to\nfloat in the air. This, of course in her present mood, was so\nincredibly beautiful. . . . She began to laugh.\n\n\"No, no. I'm getting hysterical.\" And she seized her bag and coat and\nran upstairs to the nursery.\n\n\n\nNurse sat at a low table giving Little B her supper after her bath.\nThe baby had on a white flannel gown and a blue woollen jacket, and\nher dark, fine hair was brushed up into a funny little peak. She\nlooked up when she saw her mother and began to jump.\n\n\"Now, my lovey, eat it up like a good girl,\" said Nurse, setting her\nlips in a way that Bertha knew, and that meant she had come into the\nnursery at another wrong moment.\n\n\"Has she been good, Nanny?\"\n\n\"She's been a little sweet all the afternoon,\" whispered Nanny. \"We\nwent to the park and I sat down on a chair and took her out of the\npram and a big dog came along and put its head on my knee and she\nclutched its ear, tugged it. Oh, you should have seen her.\"\n\nBertha wanted to ask if it wasn't rather dangerous to let her clutch\nat a strange dog's ear. But she did not dare to. She stood watching\nthem, her hands by her side, like the poor little girl in front of the\nrich little girl with the doll.\n\nThe baby looked up at her again, stared, and then smiled so charmingly\nthat Bertha couldn't help crying:\n\n\"Oh, Nanny, do let me finish giving her her supper while you put the\nbath things away.\"\n\n\"Well, M'm, she oughtn't to be changed hands while she's eating,\" said\nNanny, still whispering. \"It unsettles her; it's very likely to upset\nher.\"\n\nHow absurd it was. Why have a baby if it has to be kept--not in a case\nlike a rare, rare fiddle--but in another woman's arms?\n\n\"Oh, I must!\" said she.\n\nVery offended, Nanny handed her over.\n\n\"Now, don't excite her after her supper. You know you do, M'm. And I\nhave such a time with her after!\"\n\nThank heaven! Nanny went out of the room with the bath towels.\n\n\"Now I've got you to myself, my little precious,\" said Bertha, as the\nbaby leaned against her.\n\nShe ate delightfully, holding up her lips for spoon and then waving\nher hands. Sometimes she wouldn't let the spoon go; and sometimes,\njust as Bertha had filled it, she waved it away to the four winds.\n\nWhen the soup was finished Bertha turned round to the fire.\n\n\"You're nice--you're very nice!\" said she, kissing her warm baby. \"I'm\nfond of you. I like you.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, she loved Little B so much--her neck as she bent forward,\nher exquisite toes as they shone transparent in the firelight--that\nall her feeling of bliss came back again, and again she didn't know\nhow to express it--what to do with it.\n\n\"You're wanted on the telephone,\" said Nanny, coming back in triumph\nand seizing _her_ Little B.\n\n\n\nDown she flew. It was Harry.\n\n\"Oh, is that you, Ber? Look here. I'll be late. I'll take a taxi and\ncome along as quickly as I can, but get dinner put back ten\nminutes--will you? All right?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly. Oh, Harry!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nWhat had she to say? She'd nothing to say. She only wanted to get in\ntouch with him for a moment. She couldn't absurdly cry: \"Hasn't it\nbeen a divine day!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" rapped out the little voice.\n\n\"Nothing. _Entendu_,\" said Bertha, and hung up the receiver, thinking\nhow more than idiotic civilization was.\n\n\n\nThey had people coming to dinner. The Norman Knights--a very sound\ncouple--he was about to start a theatre, and she was awfully keen on\ninterior decoration, a young man, Eddie Warren, who had just published\na little book of poems and whom everybody was asking to dine, and a\n\"find\" of Bertha's called Pearl Fulton. What Miss Fulton did, Bertha\ndidn't know. They had met at the club and Bertha had fallen in love\nwith her, as she always did fall in love with beautiful women who had\nsomething strange about them.\n\nThe provoking thing was that, though they had been about together and\nmet a number of times and really talked, Bertha couldn't yet make her\nout. Up to a certain point Miss Fulton was rarely, wonderfully frank,\nbut the certain point was there, and beyond that she would not go.\n\nWas there anything beyond it? Harry said \"No.\" Voted her dullish, and\n\"cold like all blond women, with a touch, perhaps, of an\u00c3\u00a6mia of the\nbrain.\" But Bertha wouldn't agree with him; not yet, at any rate.\n\n\"No, the way she has of sitting with her head a little on one side,\nand smiling, has something behind it, Harry, and I must find out what\nthat something is.\"\n\n\"Most likely it's a good stomach,\" answered Harry.\n\nHe made a point of catching Bertha's heels with replies of that kind\n. . . \"liver frozen, my dear girl,\" or \"pure flatulence,\" or \"kidney\ndisease,\" . . . and so on. For some strange reason Bertha liked this,\nand almost admired it in him very much.\n\nShe went into the drawing-room and lighted the fire; then, picking up\nthe cushions, one by one, that Mary had disposed so carefully, she\nthrew them back on to the chairs and the couches. That made all the\ndifference; the room came alive at once. As she was about to throw the\nlast one she surprised herself by suddenly hugging it to her,\npassionately, passionately. But it did not put out the fire in her\nbosom. Oh, on the contrary!\n\nThe windows of the drawing-room opened on to a balcony overlooking the\ngarden. At the far end, against the wall, there was a tall, slender\npear tree in fullest, richest bloom; it stood perfect, as though\nbecalmed against the jade-green sky. Bertha couldn't help feeling,\neven from this distance, that it had not a single bud or a faded\npetal. Down below, in the garden beds, the red and yellow tulips,\nheavy with flowers, seemed to lean upon the dusk. A grey cat, dragging\nits belly, crept across the lawn, and a black one, its shadow, trailed\nafter. The sight of them, so intent and so quick, gave Bertha a\ncurious shiver.\n\n\"What creepy things cats are!\" she stammered, and she turned away from\nthe window and began walking up and down. . . .\n\nHow strong the jonquils smelled in the warm room. Too strong? Oh, no.\nAnd yet, as though overcome, she flung down on a couch and pressed her\nhands to her eyes.\n\n\"I'm too happy--too happy!\" she murmured.\n\nAnd she seemed to see on her eyelids the lovely pear tree with its\nwide open blossoms as a symbol of her own life.\n\nReally--really--she had everything. She was young. Harry and she were\nas much in love as ever, and they got on together splendidly and were\nreally good pals. She had an adorable baby. They didn't have to worry\nabout money. They had this absolutely satisfactory house and garden.\nAnd friends--modern, thrilling friends, writers and painters and poets\nor people keen on social questions--just the kind of friends they\nwanted. And then there were books, and there was music, and she had\nfound a wonderful little dressmaker, and they were going abroad in the\nsummer, and their new cook made the most superb omelettes. . . .\n\n\"I'm absurd. Absurd!\" She sat up; but she felt quite dizzy, quite\ndrunk. It must have been the spring.\n\nYes, it was the spring. Now she was so tired she could not drag\nherself upstairs to dress.\n\nA white dress, a string of jade beads, green shoes and stockings. It\nwasn't intentional. She had thought of this scheme hours before she\nstood at the drawing-room window.\n\nHer petals rustled softly into the hall, and she kissed Mrs. Norman\nKnight, who was taking off the most amusing orange coat with a\nprocession of black monkeys round the hem and up the fronts.\n\n\". . . Why! Why! Why is the middle-class so stodgy--so utterly without\na sense of humour! My dear, it's only by a fluke that I am here at\nall--Norman being the protective fluke. For my darling monkeys so\nupset the train that it rose to a man and simply ate me with its eyes.\nDidn't laugh--wasn't amused--that I should have loved. No, just\nstared--and bored me through and through.\"\n\n\"But the cream of it was,\" said Norman, pressing a large\ntortoiseshell-rimmed monocle into his eye, \"you don't mind me telling\nthis, Face, do you?\" (In their home and among their friends they\ncalled each other Face and Mug.) \"The cream of it was when she, being\nfull fed, turned to the woman beside her and said: 'Haven't you ever\nseen a monkey before?'\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Mrs. Norman Knight joined in the laughter. \"Wasn't that too\nabsolutely creamy?\"\n\nAnd a funnier thing still was that now her coat was off she did look\nlike a very intelligent monkey--who had even made that yellow silk\ndress out of scraped banana skins. And her amber ear-rings; they were\nlike little dangling nuts.\n\n\"This is a sad, sad fall!\" said Mug, pausing in front of Little B's\nperambulator. \"When the perambulator comes into the hall----\" and he\nwaved the rest of the quotation away.\n\nThe bell rang. It was lean, pale Eddie Warren (as usual) in a state of\nacute distress.\n\n\"It _is_ the right house, _isn't_ it?\" he pleaded.\n\n\"Oh, I think so--I hope so,\" said Bertha brightly.\n\n\"I have had such a _dreadful_ experience with a taxi-man; he was\n_most_ sinister. I couldn't get him to _stop._ The _more_ I knocked\nand called the _faster_ he went. And _in_ the moonlight this _bizarre_\nfigure with the _flattened_ head _crouching_ over the _lit-tle_ wheel.\n. . .\"\n\nHe shuddered, taking off an immense white silk scarf. Bertha noticed\nthat his socks were white, too--most charming.\n\n\"But how dreadful!\" she cried.\n\n\"Yes, it really was,\" said Eddie, following her into the drawing-room.\n\"I saw myself _driving_ through Eternity in a _timeless_ taxi.\"\n\nHe knew the Norman Knights. In fact, he was going to write a play for\nN. K. when the theatre scheme came off.\n\n\"Well, Warren, how's the play?\" said Norman Knight, dropping his\nmonocle and giving his eye a moment in which to rise to the surface\nbefore it was screwed down again.\n\nAnd Mrs. Norman Knight: \"Oh, Mr. Warren, what happy socks?\"\n\n\"I _am_ so glad you like them,\" said he, staring at his feet. \"They\nseem to have got so _much_ whiter since the moon rose.\" And he turned\nhis lean sorrowful young face to Bertha. \"There _is_ a moon, you\nknow.\"\n\nShe wanted to cry: \"I am sure there is--often--often!\"\n\nHe really was a most attractive person. But so was Face, crouched\nbefore the fire in her banana skins, and so was Mug, smoking a\ncigarette and saying as he flicked the ash: \"Why doth the bridegroom\ntarry?\"\n\n\"There he is, now.\"\n\nBang went the front door open and shut. Harry shouted: \"Hullo, you\npeople. Down in five minutes.\" And they heard him swarm up the stairs.\nBertha couldn't help smiling; she knew how he loved doing things at\nhigh pressure. What, after all, did an extra five minutes matter? But\nhe would pretend to himself that they mattered beyond measure. And\nthen he would make a great point of coming into the drawing-room,\nextravagantly cool and collected.\n\nHarry had such a zest for life. Oh, how she appreciated it in him. And\nhis passion for fighting--for seeking in everything that came up\nagainst him another test of his power and of his courage--that, too,\nshe understood. Even when it made him just occasionally, to other\npeople, who didn't know him well, a little ridiculous perhaps. . . .\nFor there were moments when he rushed into battle where no battle was.\n. . . She talked and laughed and positively forgot until he had come\nin (just as she had imagined) that Pearl Fulton had not turned up.\n\n\"I wonder if Miss Fulton has forgotten?\"\n\n\"I expect so,\" said Harry. \"Is she on the 'phone?\"\n\n\"Ah! There's a taxi, now.\" And Bertha smiled with that little air of\nproprietorship that she always assumed while her women finds were new\nand mysterious. \"She lives in taxis.\"\n\n\"She'll run to fat if she does,\" said Harry coolly, ringing the bell\nfor dinner. \"Frightful danger for blond women.\"\n\n\"Harry--don't,\" warned Bertha, laughing up at him.\n\nCame another tiny moment, while they waited, laughing and talking,\njust a trifle too much at their ease, a trifle too unaware. And then\nMiss Fulton, all in silver, with a silver fillet binding her pale\nblond hair, came in smiling, her head a little on one side.\n\n\"Am I late?\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" said Bertha. \"Come along.\" And she took her arm and\nthey moved into the dining-room.\n\nWhat was there in the touch of that cool arm that could\nfan--fan--start blazing--blazing--the fire of bliss that Bertha did\nnot know what to do with?\n\nMiss Fulton did not look at her; but then she seldom did look at\npeople directly. Her heavy eyelids lay upon her eyes and the strange\nhalf smile came and went upon her lips as though she lived by\nlistening rather than seeing. But Bertha knew, suddenly, as if the\nlongest, most intimate look had passed between them--as if they had\nsaid to each other: \"You, too?\"--that Pearl Fulton stirring the\nbeautiful red soup in the grey plate was feeling just what she was\nfeeling.\n\nAnd the others? Face and Mug, Eddie and Harry, their spoons rising and\nfalling--dabbing their lips with their napkins, crumbling bread,\nfiddling with the forks and glasses and talking.\n\n\"I met her at the Alpha show--the weirdest little person. She'd not\nonly cut off her hair, but she seemed to have taken a dreadfully good\nsnip off her legs and arms and her neck and her poor little nose as\nwell.\"\n\n\"Isn't she very _li\u00c3\u00a9e_ with Michael Oat?\"\n\n\"The man who wrote _Love in False Teeth?_\"\n\n\"He wants to write a play for me. One act. One man. Decides to commit\nsuicide. Gives all the reasons why he should and why he shouldn't. And\njust as he has made up his mind either to do it or not to do\nit--curtain. Not half a bad idea.\"\n\n\"What's he going to call it--'Stomach Trouble'?\"\n\n\"I _think_ I've come across the same _idea_ in a lit-tle French\nreview, _quite_ unknown in England.\"\n\nNo, they didn't share it. They were dears--dears--and she loved having\nthem there, at her table, and giving them delicious food and wine. In\nfact, she longed to tell them how delightful they were, and what a\ndecorative group they made, how they seemed to set one another off and\nhow they reminded her of a play by Tchekof!\n\nHarry was enjoying his dinner. It was part of his--well, not his\nnature, exactly, and certainly not his pose--his--something or\nother--to talk about food and to glory in his \"shameless passion for\nthe white flesh of the lobster\" and \"the green of pistachio\nices--green and cold like the eyelids of Egyptian dancers.\"\n\nWhen he looked up at her and said: \"Bertha, this is a very admirable\n_souffl\u00c3\u00a9e!_\" she almost could have wept with child-like pleasure.\n\nOh, why did she feel so tender towards the whole world to-night?\nEverything was good--was right. All that happened seemed to fill again\nher brimming cup of bliss.\n\nAnd still, in the back of her mind, there was the pear tree. It would\nbe silver now, in the light of poor dear Eddie's moon, silver as Miss\nFulton, who sat there turning a tangerine in her slender fingers that\nwere so pale a light seemed to come from them.\n\nWhat she simply couldn't make out--what was miraculous--was how she\nshould have guessed Miss Fulton's mood so exactly and so instantly.\nFor she never doubted for a moment that she was right, and yet what\nhad she to go on? Less than nothing.\n\n\"I believe this does happen very, very rarely between women. Never\nbetween men,\" thought Bertha. \"But while I am making the coffee in the\ndrawing-room perhaps she will 'give a sign.'\"\n\nWhat she meant by that she did not know, and what would happen after\nthat she could not imagine.\n\nWhile she thought like this she saw herself talking and laughing. She\nhad to talk because of her desire to laugh.\n\n\"I must laugh or die.\"\n\nBut when she noticed Face's funny little habit of tucking something\ndown the front of her bodice--as if she kept a tiny, secret hoard of\nnuts there, too--Bertha had to dig her nails into her hands--so as not\nto laugh too much.\n\n\n\nIt was over at last. And: \"Come and see my new coffee machine,\" said\nBertha.\n\n\"We only have a new coffee machine once a fortnight,\" said Harry. Face\ntook her arm this time; Miss Fulton bent her head and followed after.\n\nThe fire had died down in the drawing-room to a red, flickering \"nest\nof baby phoenixes,\" said Face.\n\n\"Don't turn up the light for a moment. It is so lovely.\" And down she\ncrouched by the fire again. She was always cold . . . \"without her\nlittle red flannel jacket, of course,\" thought Bertha.\n\nAt that moment Miss Fulton \"gave the sign.\"\n\n\"Have you a garden?\" said the cool, sleepy voice.\n\nThis was so exquisite on her part that all Bertha could do was to\nobey. She crossed the room, pulled the curtains apart, and opened\nthose long windows.\n\n\"There!\" she breathed.\n\nAnd the two women stood side by side looking at the slender, flowering\ntree. Although it was so still it seemed, like the flame of a candle,\nto stretch up, to point, to quiver in the bright air, to grow taller\nand taller as they gazed--almost to touch the rim of the round, silver\nmoon.\n\nHow long did they stand there? Both, as it were, caught in that circle\nof unearthly light, understanding each other perfectly, creatures of\nanother world, and wondering what they were to do in this one with all\nthis blissful treasure that burned in their bosoms and dropped, in\nsilver flowers, from their hair and hands?\n\nFor ever--for a moment? And did Miss Fulton murmur: \"Yes. Just\n_that._\" Or did Bertha dream it?\n\nThen the light was snapped on and Face made the coffee and Harry said:\n\"My dear Mrs. Knight, don't ask me about my baby. I never see her. I\nshan't feel the slightest interest in her until she has a lover,\" and\nMug took his eye out of the conservatory for a moment and then put it\nunder glass again and Eddie Warren drank his coffee and set down the\ncup with a face of anguish as though he had drunk and seen the spider.\n\n\"What I want to do is to give the young men a show. I believe London\nis simply teeming with first-chop, unwritten plays. What I want to say\nto 'em is: 'Here's the theatre. Fire ahead.'\"\n\n\"You know, my dear, I am going to decorate a room for the Jacob\nNathans. Oh, I am so tempted to do a fried-fish scheme, with the backs\nof the chairs shaped like frying pans and lovely chip potatoes\nembroidered all over the curtains.\"\n\n\"The trouble with our young writing men is that they are still too\nromantic. You can't put out to sea without being seasick and wanting a\nbasin. Well, why won't they have the courage of those basins?\"\n\n\"A _dreadful_ poem about a _girl_ who was _violated_ by a beggar\nwithout a nose in a lit-tle wood. . . .\"\n\nMiss Fulton sank into the lowest, deepest chair and Harry handed round\nthe cigarettes.\n\nFrom the way he stood in front of her shaking the silver box and\nsaying abruptly: \"Egyptian? Turkish? Virginian? They're all mixed up,\"\nBertha realized that she not only bored him; he really disliked her.\nAnd she decided from the way Miss Fulton said: \"No, thank you, I won't\nsmoke,\" that she felt it, too, and was hurt.\n\n\"Oh, Harry, don't dislike her. You are quite wrong about her. She's\nwonderful, wonderful. And, besides, how can you feel so differently\nabout someone who means so much to me. I shall try to tell you when we\nare in bed to-night what has been happening. What she and I have\nshared.\"\n\n\n\nAt those last words something strange and almost terrifying darted\ninto Bertha's mind. And this something blind and smiling whispered to\nher: \"Soon these people will go. The house will be quiet--quiet. The\nlights will be out. And you and he will be alone together in the dark\nroom--the warm bed. . . .\"\n\nShe jumped up from her chair and ran over to the piano.\n\n\"What a pity someone does not play!\" she cried. \"What a pity somebody\ndoes not play.\"\n\nFor the first time in her life Bertha Young desired her husband.\n\nOh, she'd loved him--she'd been in love with him, of course, in every\nother way, but just not in that way. And, equally, of course, she'd\nunderstood that he was different. They'd discussed it so often. It had\nworried her dreadfully at first to find that she was so cold, but\nafter a time it had not seemed to matter. They were so frank with each\nother--such good pals. That was the best of being modern.\n\nBut now--ardently! ardently! The word ached in her ardent body! Was\nthis what that feeling of bliss had been leading up to? But then\nthen----\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Norman Knight, \"you know our shame. We are the\nvictims of time and train. We live in Hampstead. It's been so nice.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you into the hall,\" said Bertha. \"I loved having you.\nBut you must not miss the last train. That's so awful, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Have a whisky, Knight, before you go?\" called Harry.\n\n\"No, thanks, old chap.\"\n\nBertha squeezed his hand for that as she shook it.\n\n\"Good night, good-bye,\" she cried from the top step, feeling that this\nself of hers was taking leave of them for ever.\n\nWhen she got back into the drawing-room the others were on the move.\n\n\". . . Then you can come part of the way in my taxi.\"\n\n\"I shall be _so_ thankful _not_ to have to face _another_ drive\n_alone_ after my _dreadful_ experience.\"\n\n\"You can get a taxi at the rank just at the end of the street. You\nwon't have to walk more than a few yards.\"\n\n\"That's a comfort. I'll go and put on my coat.\"\n\nMiss Fulton moved towards the hall and Bertha was following when Harry\nalmost pushed past.\n\n\"Let me help you.\"\n\nBertha knew that he was repenting his rudeness--she let him go. What a\nboy he was in some ways--so impulsive--so--simple.\n\nAnd Eddie and she were left by the fire.\n\n\"I _wonder_ if you have seen Bilks' _new_ poem called _Table d'H\u00c3\u00b4te_,\"\nsaid Eddie softly. \"It's _so_ wonderful. In the last Anthology. Have\nyou got a copy? I'd _so_ like to _show_ it to you. It begins with an\n_incredibly_ beautiful line: 'Why Must it Always be Tomato Soup?'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bertha. And she moved noiselessly to a table opposite the\ndrawing-room door and Eddie glided noiselessly after her. She picked\nup the little book and gave it to him; they had not made a sound.\n\nWhile he looked it up she turned her head towards the hall. And she\nsaw . . . Harry with Miss Fulton's coat in his arms and Miss Fulton\nwith her back turned to him and her head bent. He tossed the coat\naway, put his hands on her shoulders and turned her violently to him.\nHis lips said: \"I adore you,\" and Miss Fulton laid her moonbeam\nfingers on his cheeks and smiled her sleepy smile. Harry's nostrils\nquivered; his lips curled back in a hideous grin while he whispered:\n\"To-morrow,\" and with her eyelids Miss Fulton said: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Eddie. \"'Why Must it Always be Tomato Soup?' It's\nso _deeply_ true, don't you feel? Tomato soup is so _dreadfully_\neternal.\"\n\n\"If you prefer,\" said Harry's voice, very loud, from the hall, \"I can\nphone you a cab to come to the door.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It's not necessary,\" said Miss Fulton, and she came up to\nBertha and gave her the slender fingers to hold.\n\n\"Good-bye. Thank you so much.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Bertha.\n\nMiss Fulton held her hand a moment longer.\n\n\"Your lovely pear tree!\" she murmured.\n\nAnd then she was gone, with Eddie following, like the black cat\nfollowing the grey cat.\n\n\"I'll shut up shop,\" said Harry, extravagantly cool and collected.\n\n\"Your lovely pear tree--pear tree--pear tree!\"\n\nBertha simply ran over to the long windows.\n\n\"Oh, what is going to happen now?\" she cried.\n\nBut the pear tree was as lovely as ever and as full of flower and as\nstill.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WIND BLOWS\n\nSUDDENLY--dreadfully--she wakes up. What has happened? Something\ndreadful has happened. No--nothing has happened. It is only the wind\nshaking the house, rattling the windows, banging a piece of iron on\nthe roof and making her bed tremble. Leaves flutter past the window,\nup and away; down in the avenue a whole newspaper wags in the air like\na lost kite and falls, spiked on a pine tree. It is cold. Summer is\nover--it is autumn--everything is ugly. The carts rattle by, swinging\nfrom side to side; two Chinamen lollop along under their wooden yokes\nwith the straining vegetable baskets--their pigtails and blue blouses\nfly out in the wind. A white dog on three legs yelps past the gate. It\nis all over! What is? Oh, everything! And she begins to plait her hair\nwith shaking fingers, not daring to look in the glass. Mother is\ntalking to grandmother in the hall.\n\n\"A perfect idiot! Imagine leaving anything out on the line in weather\nlike this. . . . Now my best little Teneriffe-work teacloth is simply\nin ribbons. _What_ is that extraordinary smell? It's the porridge\nburning. Oh, heavens--this wind!\"\n\nShe has a music lesson at ten o'clock. At the thought the minor\nmovement of the Beethoven begins to play in her head, the trills long\nand terrible like little rolling drums. . . . Marie Swainson runs into\nthe garden next door to pick the \"chrysanths\" before they are ruined.\nHer skirt flies up above her waist; she tries to beat it down, to tuck\nit between her legs while she stoops, but it is no use--up it flies.\nAll the trees and bushes beat about her. She picks as quickly as she\ncan but she is quite distracted. She doesn't mind what she does--she\npulls the plants up by the roots and bends and twists them, stamping\nher foot and swearing.\n\n\"For heaven's sake keep the front door shut! Go round to the back,\"\nshouts someone. And then she hears Bogey:\n\n\"Mother, you're wanted on the telephone. Telephone, Mother. It's the\nbutcher.\"\n\nHow hideous life is--revolting, simply revolting. . . . And now her\nhat-elastic's snapped. Of course it would. She'll wear her old tam and\nslip out the back way. But Mother has seen.\n\n\"Matilda. Matilda. Come back im-me-diately! What on earth have you got\non your head? It looks like a tea cosy. And why have you got that mane\nof hair on your forehead.\"\n\n\"I can't come back. Mother. I'll be late for my lesson.\"\n\n\"Come back immediately!\"\n\nShe won't. She won't. She hates Mother. \"Go to hell,\" she shouts,\nrunning down the road.\n\nIn waves, in clouds, in big round whirls the dust comes stinging, and\nwith it little bits of straw and chaff and manure. There is a loud\nroaring sound from the trees in the gardens, and standing at the\nbottom of the road outside Mr. Bullen's gate she can hear the sea sob:\n\"Ah! . . . Ah! . . . Ah-h!\" But Mr. Bullen's drawing-room is as quiet\nas a cave. The windows are closed, the blinds half pulled, and she is\nnot late. The-girl-before-her has just started playing MacDowell's \"To\nan Iceberg.\" Mr. Bullen looks over at her and half smiles.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he says. \"Sit over there in the sofa corner, little lady.\"\n\nHow funny he is. He doesn't exactly laugh at you . . . but there is\njust something. . . . Oh, how peaceful it is here. She likes this\nroom. It smells of art serge and stale smoke and chrysanthemums . . .\nthere is a big vase of them on the mantelpiece behind the pale\nphotograph of Rubinstein . . . _\u00c3\u00a0 mon ami Robert Bullen._ . . . Over\nthe black glittering piano hangs \"Solitude\"--a dark tragic woman\ndraped in white, sitting on a rock, her knees crossed, her chin on her\nhands.\n\n\"No, no!\" says Mr. Bullen, and he leans over the other girl, put his\narms over her shoulders and plays the passage for her. The\nstupid--she's blushing! How ridiculous!\n\nNow the-girl-before-her has gone; the front door slams. Mr. Bullen\ncomes back and walks up and down, very softly, waiting for her. What\nan extraordinary thing. Her fingers tremble so that she can't undo the\nknot in the music satchel. It's the wind. . . . And her heart beats so\nhard she feels it must lift her blouse up and down. Mr. Bullen does\nnot say a word. The shabby red piano seat is long enough for two\npeople to sit side by side. Mr. Bullen sits down by her.\n\n\"Shall I begin with scales,\" she asks, squeezing her hands together.\n\"I had some arpeggios, too.\"\n\nBut he does not answer. She doesn't believe he even hears . . . and\nthen suddenly his fresh hand with the ring on it reaches over and\nopens Beethoven.\n\n\"Let's have a little of the old master,\" he says.\n\nBut why does he speak so kindly--so awfully kindly--and as though they\nhad known each other for years and years and knew everything about\neach other.\n\nHe turns the page slowly. She watches his hand--it is a very nice hand\nand always looks as though it had just been washed.\n\n\"Here we are,\" says Mr. Bullen.\n\nOh, that kind voice--Oh, that minor movement. Here come the little\ndrums. . . .\n\n\"Shall I take the repeat?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear child.\"\n\nHis voice is far, far too kind. The crotchets and quavers are dancing\nup and down the stave like little black boys on a fence. Why is he so\n. . . She will not cry--she has nothing to cry about. . . .\n\n\"What is it, dear child?\"\n\nMr. Bullen takes her hands. His shoulder is there--just by her head.\nShe leans on it ever so little, her cheek against the springy tweed.\n\n\"Life is so dreadful,\" she murmurs, but she does not feel it's\ndreadful at all. He says something about \"waiting\" and \"marking time\"\nand \"that rare thing, a woman,\" but she does not hear. It is so\ncomfortable . . . for ever . . .\n\nSuddenly the door opens and in pops Marie Swainson, hours before her\ntime.\n\n\"Take the allegretto a little faster,\" says Mr. Bullen, and gets up\nand begins to walk up and down again.\n\n\"Sit in the sofa corner, little lady,\" he says to Marie.\n\n\n\nThe wind, the wind. It's frightening to be here in her room by\nherself. The bed, the mirror, the white jug and basin gleam like the\nsky outside. It's the bed that is frightening. There it lies, sound\nasleep. . . . Does Mother imagine for one moment that she is going to\ndarn all those stockings knotted up on the quilt like a coil of\nsnakes? She's not. No, Mother. I do not see why I should. . . . The\nwind--the wind! There's a funny smell of soot blowing down the\nchimney. Hasn't anyone written poems to the wind? . . . \"I bring fresh\nflowers to the leaves and showers.\" . . . What nonsense.\n\n\"Is that you, Bogey?\"\n\n\"Come for a walk round the esplanade, Matilda. I can't stand this any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Right-o. I'll put on my ulster. Isn't it an awful day!\" Bogey's\nulster is just like hers. Hooking the collar she looks at herself in\nthe glass. Her face is white, they have the same excited eyes and hot\nlips. Ah, they know those two in the glass. Good-bye, dears; we shall\nbe back soon.\n\n\"This is better, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Hook on,\" says Bogey.\n\nThey cannot walk fast enough. Their heads bent, their legs just\ntouching, they stride like one eager person through the town, down the\nasphalt zigzag where the fennel grows wild and on to the esplanade. It\nis dusky--just getting dusky. The wind is so strong that they have to\nfight their way through it, rocking like two old drunkards. All the\npoor little pahutukawas on the esplanade are bent to the ground.\n\n\"Come on! Come on! Let's get near.\"\n\nOver by the breakwater the sea is very high. They pull off their hats\nand her hair blows across her mouth, tasting of salt. The sea is so\nhigh that the waves do not break at all; they thump against the rough\nstone wall and suck up the weedy, dripping steps. A fine spray skims\nfrom the water right across the esplanade. They are covered with\ndrops; the inside of her mouth tastes wet and cold.\n\nBogey's voice is breaking. When he speaks he rushes up and down the\nscale. It's funny--it makes you laugh--and yet it just suits the day.\nThe wind carries their voices--away fly the sentences like little\nnarrow ribbons.\n\n\"Quicker! Quicker!\"\n\nIt is getting very dark. In the harbour the coal hulks show two\nlights--one high on a mast, and one from the stern.\n\n\"Look, Bogey. Look over there.\"\n\nA big black steamer with a long loop of smoke streaming, with the\nportholes lighted, with lights everywhere, is putting out to sea. The\nwind does not stop her; she cuts through the waves, making for the\nopen gate between the pointed rocks that leads to . . . It's the light\nthat makes her look so awfully beautiful and mysterious. . . . _They_\nare on board leaning over the rail arm in arm.\n\n\". . . Who are they?\"\n\n\". . . Brother and sister.\"\n\n\"Look, Bogey, there's the town. Doesn't it look small? There's the\npost office clock chiming for the last time. There's the esplanade\nwhere we walked that windy day. Do you remember? I cried at my music\nlesson that day--how many years ago! Good-bye, little island,\ngood-bye. . . .\"\n\nNow the dark stretches a wing over the tumbling water. They can't see\nthose two any more. Good-bye, good-bye. Don't forget. . . . But the\nship is gone, now.\n\nThe wind--the wind.\n\n\n\n\nPSYCHOLOGY\n\nWHEN she opened the door and saw him standing there she was more\npleased than ever before, and he, too, as he followed her into the\nstudio, seemed very very happy to have come.\n\n\"Not busy?\"\n\n\"No. Just going to have tea.\"\n\n\"And you are not expecting anybody?\"\n\n\"Nobody at all.\"\n\n\"Ah! That's good.\"\n\nHe laid aside his coat and hat gently, lingeringly, as though he had\ntime and to spare for everything, or as though he were taking leave of\nthem for ever, and came over to the fire and held out his hands to the\nquick, leaping flame.\n\nJust for a moment both of them stood silent in that leaping light.\nStill, as it were, they tasted on their smiling lips the sweet shock\nof their greeting. Their secret selves whispered:\n\n\"Why should we speak? Isn't this enough?\"\n\n\"More than enough. I never realized until this moment . . .\"\n\n\"How good it is just to be with you. . . .\"\n\n\"Like this. . . .\"\n\n\"It's more than enough.\"\n\nBut suddenly he turned and looked at her and she moved quickly away.\n\n\"Have a cigarette? I'll put the kettle on. Are you longing for tea?\"\n\n\"No. Not longing.\"\n\n\"Well, I am.\"\n\n\"Oh, you.\" He thumped the Armenian cushion and flung on to the\n_sommier._ \"You're a perfect little Chinee.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" she laughed. \"I long for tea as strong men long for\nwine.\"\n\nShe lighted the lamp under its broad orange shade, pulled the curtains\nand drew up the tea table. Two birds sang in the kettle; the fire\nfluttered. He sat up clasping his knees. It was delightful--this\nbusiness of having tea--and she always had delicious things to\neat--little sharp sandwiches, short sweet almond fingers, and a dark,\nrich cake tasting of rum--but it was an interruption. He wanted it\nover, the table pushed away, their two chairs drawn up to the light,\nand the moment came when he took out his pipe, filled it, and said,\npressing the tobacco tight into the bowl: \"I have been thinking over\nwhat you said last time and it seems to me . . .\"\n\nYes, that was what he waited for and so did she. Yes, while she shook\nthe teapot hot and dry over the spirit flame she saw those other two,\nhim, leaning back, taking his ease among the cushions, and her, curled\nup _en escargot_ in the blue shell arm-chair. The picture was so clear\nand so minute it might have been painted on the blue teapot lid. And\nyet she couldn't hurry. She could almost have cried: \"Give me time.\"\nShe must have time in which to grow calm. She wanted time in which to\nfree herself from all these familiar things with which she lived so\nvividly. For all these gay things round her were part of her--her\noffspring--and they knew it and made the largest, most vehement\nclaims. But now they must go. They must be swept away, shooed\naway--like children, sent up the shadowy stairs, packed into bed and\ncommanded to go to sleep--at once--without a murmur!\n\nFor the special thrilling quality of their friendship was in their\ncomplete surrender. Like two open cities in the midst of some vast\nplain their two minds lay open to each other. And it wasn't as if he\nrode into hers like a conqueror, armed to the eyebrows and seeing\nnothing but a gay silken flutter--nor did she enter his like a queen\nwalking soft on petals. No, they were eager, serious travellers,\nabsorbed in understanding what was to be seen and discovering what was\nhidden--making the most of this extraordinary absolute chance which\nmade it possible for him to be utterly truthful to her and for her to\nbe utterly sincere with him.\n\nAnd the best of it was they were both of them old enough to enjoy\ntheir adventure to the full without any stupid emotional complication.\nPassion would have ruined everything; they quite saw that. Besides,\nall that sort of thing was over and done with for both of them--he was\nthirty-one, she was thirty--they had had their experiences, and very\nrich and varied they had been, but now was the time for\nharvest--harvest. Weren't his novels to be very big novels indeed?\nAnd her plays. Who else had her exquisite sense of real English\nComedy? . . .\n\nCarefully she cut the cake into thick little wads and he reached\nacross for a piece.\n\n\"Do realize how good it is,\" she implored. \"Eat it imaginatively. Roll\nyour eyes if you can and taste it on the breath. It's not a sandwich\nfrom the hatter's bag--it's the kind of cake that might have been\nmentioned in the Book of Genesis. . . . And God said: 'Let there be\ncake. And there was cake. And God saw that it was good.'\"\n\n\"You needn't entreat me,\" said he. \"Really you needn't. It's a queer\nthing but I always do notice what I eat here and never anywhere else.\nI suppose it comes of living alone so long and always reading while I\nfeed . . . my habit of looking upon food as just food . . . something\nthat's there, at certain times . . . to be devoured . . . to be . . .\nnot there.\" He laughed. \"That shocks you. Doesn't it?\"\n\n\"To the bone,\" said she.\n\n\"But--look here----\" He pushed away his cup and began to speak very\nfast. \"I simply haven't got any external life at all. I don't know the\nnames of things a bit--trees and so on--and I never notice places or\nfurniture or what people look like. One room is just like another to\nme--a place to sit and read or talk in--except,\" and here he paused,\nsmiled in a strange naive way, and said, \"except this studio.\" He\nlooked round him and then at her; he laughed in his astonishment and\npleasure. He was like a man who wakes up in a train to find that he\nhas arrived, already, at the journey's end.\n\n\"Here's another queer thing. If I shut my eyes I can see this place\ndown to every detail--every detail. . . . Now I come to think of\nit--I've never realized this consciously before. Often when I am away\nfrom here I revisit it in spirit--wander about among your red chairs,\nstare at the bowl of fruit on the black table--and just touch, very\nlightly, that marvel of a sleeping boy's head.\"\n\nHe looked at it as he spoke. It stood on the corner of the\nmantelpiece; the head to one side down-drooping, the lips parted, as\nthough in his sleep the little boy listened to some sweet sound. . . .\n\n\"I love that little boy,\" he murmured. And then they both were silent.\n\nA new silence came between them. Nothing in the least like the\nsatisfactory pause that had followed their greetings--the \"Well, here\nwe are together again, and there's no reason why we shouldn't go on\nfrom just where we left off last time.\" That silence could be\ncontained in the circle of warm, delightful fire and lamplight. How\nmany times hadn't they flung something into it just for the fun of\nwatching the ripples break on the easy shores. But into this\nunfamiliar pool the head of the little boy sleeping his timeless sleep\ndropped--and the ripples flowed away, away--boundlessly far--into deep\nglittering darkness.\n\nAnd then both of them broke it. She said: \"I must make up the fire,\"\nand he said: \"I have been trying a new . . .\" Both of them escaped.\nShe made up the fire and put the table back, the blue chair was\nwheeled forward, she curled up and he lay back among the cushions.\nQuickly! Quickly! They must stop it from happening again.\n\n\"Well, I read the book you left last time.\"\n\n\"Oh, what do you think of it?\"\n\nThey were off and all was as usual. But was it? Weren't they just a\nlittle too quick, too prompt with their replies, too ready to take\neach other up? Was this really anything more than a wonderfully good\nimitation of other occasions? His heart beat; her cheek burned and the\nstupid thing was she could not discover where exactly they were or\nwhat exactly was happening. She hadn't time to glance back. And just\nas she had got so far it happened again. They faltered, wavered, broke\ndown, were silent. Again they were conscious of the boundless,\nquestioning dark. Again, there they were--two hunters, bending over\ntheir fire, but hearing suddenly from the jungle beyond a shake of\nwind and a loud, questioning cry. . . .\n\nShe lifted her head. \"It's raining,\" she murmured. And her voice was\nlike his when he had said: \"I love that little boy.\"\n\nWell. Why didn't they just give way to it--yield--and see what will\nhappen then? But no. Vague and troubled though they were, they knew\nenough to realize their precious friendship was in danger. She was the\none who would be destroyed--not they--and they'd be no party to that.\n\nHe got up, knocked out his pipe, ran his hand through his hair and\nsaid: \"I have been wondering very much lately whether the novel of the\nfuture will be a psychological novel or not. How sure are you that\npsychology _qua_ psychology has got anything to do with literature at\nall?\"\n\n\"Do you mean you feel there's quite a chance that the mysterious\nnon-existent creatures--the young writers of to-day--are trying simply\nto jump the psycho-analyst's claim?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. And I think it's because this generation is just wise\nenough to know that it is sick and to realize that its only chance of\nrecovery is by going into its symptoms--making an exhaustive study of\nthem--tracking them down--trying to get at the root of the trouble.\"\n\n\"But oh,\" she wailed. \"What a dreadfully dismal outlook.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said he. \"Look here . . .\" On the talk went. And now it\nseemed they really had succeeded. She turned in her chair to look at\nhim while she answered. Her smile said: \"We have won.\" And he smiled\nback, confident: \"Absolutely.\"\n\nBut the smile undid them. It lasted too long; it became a grin. They\nsaw themselves as two little grinning puppets jigging away in\nnothingness.\n\n\"What have we been talking about?\" thought he. He was so utterly bored\nhe almost groaned.\n\n\"What a spectacle we have made of ourselves,\" thought she. And she saw\nhim laboriously--oh, laboriously--laying out the grounds and herself\nrunning after, putting here a tree and there a flowery shrub and here\na handful of glittering fish in a pool. They were silent this time\nfrom sheer dismay.\n\nThe clock struck six merry little pings and the fire made a soft\nflutter. What fools they were--heavy, stodgy, elderly--with positively\nupholstered minds.\n\nAnd now the silence put a spell upon them like solemn music. It was\nanguish--anguish for her to bear it and he would die--he'd die if it\nwere broken. . . . And yet he longed to break it. Not by speech. At\nany rate not by their ordinary maddening chatter. There was another\nway for them to speak to each other, and in the new way he wanted to\nmurmur: \"Do you feel this too? Do you understand it at all?\" . . .\n\nInstead, to his horror, he heard himself say: \"I must be off; I'm\nmeeting Brand at six.\"\n\nWhat devil made him say that instead of the other? She jumped--simply\njumped out of her chair, and he heard her crying: \"You must rush,\nthen. He's so punctual. Why didn't you say so before?\"\n\n\"You've hurt me; you've hurt me! We've failed!\" said her secret self\nwhile she handed him his hat and stick, smiling gaily. She wouldn't\ngive him a moment for another word, but ran along the passage and\nopened the big outer door.\n\nCould they leave each other like this? How could they? He stood on the\nstep and she just inside holding the door. It was not raining now.\n\n\"You've hurt me--hurt me,\" said her heart. \"Why don't you go? No,\ndon't go. Stay. No--go!\" And she looked out upon the night.\n\nShe saw the beautiful fall of the steps, the dark garden ringed with\nglittering ivy, on the other side of the road the huge bare willows\nand above them the sky big and bright with stars. But of course he\nwould see nothing of all this. He was superior to it all. He--with his\nwonderful \"spiritual\" vision!\n\nShe was right. He did see nothing at all. Misery! He'd missed it. It\nwas too late to do anything now. Was it too late? Yes, it was. A cold\nsnatch of hateful wind blew into the garden. Curse life! He heard her\ncry \"au revoir\" and the door slammed.\n\nRunning back into the studio she behaved so strangely. She ran up and\ndown lifting her arms and crying: \"Oh! Oh! How stupid! How imbecile!\nHow stupid!\" And then she flung herself down on the _sommier_ thinking\nof nothing--just lying there in her rage. All was over. What was over?\nOh--something was. And she'd never see him again--never. After a long\nlong time (or perhaps ten minutes) had passed in that black gulf her\nbell rang a sharp quick jingle. It was he, of course. And equally, of\ncourse, she oughtn't to have paid the slightest attention to it but\njust let it go on ringing and ringing. She flew to answer.\n\nOn the doorstep there stood an elderly virgin, a pathetic creature who\nsimply idolized her (heaven knows why) and had this habit of turning\nup and ringing the bell and then saying, when she opened the door: \"My\ndear, send me away!\" She never did. As a rule she asked her in and let\nher admire everything and accepted the bunch of slightly soiled\nlooking flowers--more than graciously. But to-day . . .\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry,\" she cried. \"But I've got someone with me. We are\nworking on some woodcuts. I'm hopelessly busy all evening.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all, darling,\" said the good\nfriend. \"I was just passing and I thought I'd leave you some violets.\"\nShe fumbled down among the ribs of a large old umbrella. \"I put them\ndown here. Such a good place to keep flowers out of the wind. Here\nthey are,\" she said, shaking out a little dead bunch.\n\nFor a moment she did not take the violets. But while she stood just\ninside, holding the door, a strange thing happened. . . . Again she\nsaw the beautiful fall of the steps, the dark garden ringed with\nglittering ivy, the willows, the big bright sky. Again she felt the\nsilence that was like a question. But this time she did not hesitate.\nShe moved forward. Very softly and gently, as though fearful of making\na ripple in that boundless pool of quiet she put her arms round her\nfriend.\n\n\"My dear,\" murmured her happy friend, quite overcome by this\ngratitude. \"They are really nothing. Just the simplest little\nthrippenny bunch.\"\n\nBut as she spoke she was enfolded--more tenderly, more beautifully\nembraced, held by such a sweet pressure and for so long that the poor\ndear's mind positively reeled and she just had the strength to quaver:\n\"Then you really don't mind me too much?\"\n\n\"Good night, my friend,\" whispered the other. \"Come again soon.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will. I will.\"\n\nThis time she walked back to the studio slowly, and standing in the\nmiddle of the room with half-shut eyes she felt so light, so rested,\nas if she had woken up out of a childish sleep. Even the act of\nbreathing was a joy. . . .\n\nThe _sommier_ was very untidy. All the cushions \"like furious\nmountains\" as she said; she put them in order before going over to the\nwriting-table.\n\n\"I have been thinking over our talk about the psychological novel,\"\nshe dashed off, \"it really is intensely interesting.\" . . . And so on\nand so on.\n\nAt the end she wrote: \"Good night, my friend. Come again soon.\"\n\n\n\n\nPICTURES\n\nEIGHT o'clock in the morning. Miss Ada Moss lay in a black iron\nbedstead, staring up at the ceiling. Her room, a Bloomsbury top-floor\nback, smelled of soot and face powder and the paper of fried potatoes\nshe brought in for supper the night before.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" thought Miss Moss, \"I am cold. I wonder why it is that I\nalways wake up so cold in the mornings now. My knees and feet and my\nback--especially my back; it's like a sheet of ice. And I always was\nsuch a one for being warm in the old days. It's not as if I was\nskinny--I'm just the same full figure that I used to be. No, it's\nbecause I don't have a good hot dinner in the evenings.\"\n\nA pageant of Good Hot Dinners passed across the ceiling, each of them\naccompanied by a bottle of Nourishing Stout. . . .\n\n\"Even if I were to get up now,\" she thought, \"and have a sensible\nsubstantial breakfast . . .\" A pageant of Sensible Substantial\nBreakfasts followed the dinners across the ceiling, shepherded by an\nenormous, white, uncut ham. Miss Moss shuddered and disappeared under\nthe bedclothes. Suddenly, in bounced the landlady.\n\n\"There's a letter for you, Miss Moss.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Miss Moss, far too friendly, \"thank you very much, Mrs.\nPine. It's very good of you, I'm sure, to take the trouble.\"\n\n\"No trouble at all,\" said the landlady. \"I thought perhaps it was the\nletter you'd been expecting.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Miss Moss brightly, \"yes, perhaps it is.\" She put her head\non one side and smiled vaguely at the letter. \"I shouldn't be\nsurprised.\"\n\nThe landlady's eyes popped. \"Well, I should, Miss Moss,\" said she,\n\"and that's how it is. And I'll trouble you to open it, if you please.\nMany is the lady in my place as would have done it for you and have\nbeen within her rights. For things can't go on like this, Miss Moss,\nno indeed they can't. What with week in week out and first you've got\nit and then you haven't, and then it's another letter lost in the post\nor another manager down at Brighton but will be back on Tuesday for\ncertain--I'm fair sick and tired and I won't stand it no more. Why\nshould I, Miss Moss, I ask you, at a time like this, with prices\nflying up in the air and my poor dear lad in France? My sister Eliza\nwas only saying to me yesterday--'Minnie,' she says, 'you're too\nsoft-hearted. You could have let that room time and time again,' says\nshe, 'and if people won't look after themselves in times like these,\nnobody else will,' she says. 'She may have had a College eddication\nand sung in West End concerts,' says she, 'but if your Lizzie says\nwhat's true,' she says, 'and she's washing her own wovens and drying\nthem on the towel rail, it's easy to see where the finger's pointing.\nAnd it's high time you had done with it,' says she.\"\n\nMiss Moss gave no sign of having heard this. She sat up in bed, tore\nopen her letter and read:\n\n\n\"Dear Madam,\n\n  Yours to hand. Am not producing at present, but have filed photo for\nfuture ref.\n\n    Yours truly,\n      BACKWASH FILM CO.\"\n\n\nThis letter seemed to afford her peculiar satisfaction; she read it\nthrough twice before replying to the landlady.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Pine, I think you'll be sorry for what you said. This is\nfrom a manager, asking me to be there with evening dress at ten\no'clock next Saturday morning.\"\n\nBut the landlady was too quick for her. She pounced, secured the\nletter.\n\n\"Oh, is it! Is it indeed!\" she cried.\n\n\"Give me back that letter. Give it back to me at once, you bad, wicked\nwoman,\" cried Miss Moss, who could not get out of bed because her\nnightdress was slit down the back. \"Give me back my private letter.\"\nThe landlady began slowly backing out of the room, holding the letter\nto her buttoned bodice.\n\n\"So it's come to this, has it?\" said she. \"Well, Miss Moss, if I don't\nget my rent at eight o'clock to-night, we'll see who's a bad, wicked\nwoman--that's all.\" Here she nodded, mysteriously. \"And I'll keep this\nletter.\" Here her voice rose. \"It will be a pretty little bit of\nevidence!\" And here it fell, sepulchral, \"_My lady._\"\n\nThe door banged and Miss Moss was alone. She flung off the bed\nclothes, and sitting by the side of the bed, furious and shivering,\nshe stared at her fat white legs with their great knots of greeny-blue\nveins.\n\n\"Cockroach! That's what she is. She's a cockroach!\" said Miss Moss. \"I\ncould have her up for snatching my letter--I'm sure I could.\" Still\nkeeping on her nightdress she began to drag on her clothes.\n\n\"Oh, if I could only pay that woman, I'd give her a piece of my mind\nthat she wouldn't forget. I'd tell her off proper.\" She went over to\nthe chest of drawers for a safety-pin, and seeing herself in the glass\nshe gave a vague smile and shook her head. \"Well, old girl,\" she\nmurmured, \"you're up against it this time, and no mistake.\" But the\nperson in the glass made an ugly face at her.\n\n\"You silly thing,\" scolded Miss Moss. \"Now what's the good of crying:\nyou'll only make your nose red. No, you get dressed and go out and try\nyour luck--that's what you've got to do.\"\n\nShe unhooked her vanity bag from the bedpost, rooted in it, shook it,\nturned it inside out.\n\n\"I'll have a nice cup of tea at an A B C to settle me before I go\nanywhere,\" she decided. \"I've got one and thrippence--yes, just one\nand three.\"\n\nTen minutes later, a stout lady in blue serge, with a bunch of\nartificial \"parmas\" at her bosom, a black hat covered with purple\npansies, white gloves, boots with white uppers, and a vanity bag\ncontaining one and three, sang in a low contralto voice:\n\n  Sweet-heart, remember when days are forlorn\n  It al-ways is dar-kest before the dawn.\n\nBut the person in the glass made a face at her, and Miss Moss went\nout. There were grey crabs all the way down the street slopping water\nover grey stone steps. With his strange, hawking cry and the jangle of\nthe cans the milk boy went his rounds. Outside Brittweiler's Swiss\nHouse he made a splash, and an old brown cat without a tail appeared\nfrom nowhere, and began greedily and silently drinking up the spill.\nIt gave Miss Moss a queer feeling to watch--a sinking--as you might\nsay.\n\nBut when she came to the A B C she found the door propped open; a man\nwent in and out carrying trays of rolls, and there was nobody inside\nexcept a waitress doing her hair and the cashier unlocking cash-boxes.\nShe stood in the middle of the floor but neither of them saw her.\n\n\"My boy came home last night,\" sang the waitress.\n\n\"Oh, I say--how topping for you!\" gurgled the cashier.\n\n\"Yes, wasn't it,\" sang the waitress. \"He brought me a sweet little\nbrooch. Look, it's got 'Dieppe' written on it.\"\n\nThe cashier ran across to look and put her arm round the waitress'\nneck.\n\n\"Oh, I say--how topping for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it,\" said the waitress. \"O-oh, he is brahn. 'Hullo,' I\nsaid, 'hullo, old mahogany.'\"\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" gurgled the cashier, running back into her cage and\nnearly bumping into Miss Moss on the way. \"You are a _treat!\"_ Then\nthe man with the rolls came in again, swerving past her.\n\n\"Can I have a cup of tea, Miss?\" she asked.\n\nBut the waitress went on doing her hair. \"Oh,\" she sang, \"we're not\n_open_ yet.\" She turned round and waved her comb at the cashier.\n\n\"_Are_ we, dear?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the cashier. Miss Moss went out.\n\n\"I'll go to Charing Cross. Yes, that's what I'll do,\" she decided.\n\"But I won't have a cup of tea. No, I'll have a coffee. There's more\nof a tonic in coffee. . . . Cheeky, those girls are! Her boy came home\nlast night; he brought her a brooch with 'Dieppe' written on it.\" She\nbegan to cross the road. . . .\n\n\"Look out, Fattie; don't go to sleep!\" yelled a taxi driver. She\npretended not to hear.\n\n\"No, I won't go to Charing Cross,\" she decided. \"I'll go straight to\nKig and Kadgit. They're open at nine. If I get there early Mr. Kadgit\nmay have something by the morning's post. . . . I'm very glad you\nturned up so early, Miss Moss. I've just heard from a manager who\nwants a lady to play. . . . I think you'll just suit him. I'll give\nyou a card to go and see him. It's three pounds a week and all found.\nIf I were you I'd hop round as fast as I could. Lucky you turned up so\nearly . . .\"\n\nBut there was nobody at Kig and Kadgit's except the charwoman wiping\nover the \"lino\" in the passage.\n\n\"Nobody here yet, Miss,\" said the char.\n\n\"Oh, isn't Mr. Kadgit here?\" said Miss Moss, trying to dodge the pail\nand brush. \"Well, I'll just wait a moment, if I may.\"\n\n\"You can't wait in the waiting-room, Miss. I 'aven't done it yet. Mr.\nKadgit's never 'ere before 'leven-thirty Saturdays. Sometimes 'e don't\ncome at all.\" And the char began crawling towards her.\n\n\"Dear me--how silly of me,\" said Miss Moss. \"I forgot it was\nSaturday.\"\n\n\"Mind your feet, _please_, Miss,\" said the char. And Miss Moss was\noutside again.\n\nThat was one thing about Beit and Bithems; it was lively. You walked\ninto the waiting-room, into a great buzz of conversation, and there\nwas everybody; you knew almost everybody. The early ones sat on chairs\nand the later ones sat on the early ones' laps, while the gentlemen\nleaned negligently against the walls or preened themselves in front of\nthe admiring ladies.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Miss Moss, very gay. \"Here we are again!\"\n\nAnd young Mr. Clayton, playing the banjo on his walking-stick, sang:\n\"Waiting for the Robert E. Lee.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bithem here yet?\" asked Miss Moss, taking out an old dead powder\npuff and powdering her nose mauve.\n\n\"Oh, yes, dear,\" cried the chorus. \"He's been here for ages. We've all\nbeen waiting here for more than an hour.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Miss Moss. \"Anything doing, do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh, a few jobs going for South Africa,\" said young Mr. Clayton.\n\"Hundred and fifty a week for two years, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the chorus. \"You _are_ weird, Mr. Clayton. Isn't he a\n_cure?_ Isn't he a _scream_, dear? Oh, Mr. Clayton, you do make me\nlaugh. Isn't he a _comic?_\"\n\nA dark, mournful girl touched Miss Moss on the arm.\n\n\"I just missed a lovely job yesterday,\" she said. \"Six weeks in the\nprovinces and then the West End. The manager said I would have got it\nfor certain if only I'd been robust enough. He said if my figure had\nbeen fuller, the part was made for me.\" She stared at Miss Moss, and\nthe dirty dark red rose under the brim of her hat looked, somehow, as\nthough it shared the blow with her, and was crushed, too.\n\n\"Oh, dear, that was hard lines,\" said Miss Moss trying to appear\nindifferent. \"What was it--if I may ask?\"\n\nBut the dark, mournful girl saw through her and a gleam of spite came\ninto her heavy eyes.\n\n\"Oh, no good to you, my dear,\" said she. \"He wanted someone young, you\nknow--a dark Spanish type--my style, but more figure, that was all.\"\n\nThe inner door opened and Mr. Bithem appeared in his shirt sleeves. He\nkept one hand on the door ready to whisk back again, and held up the\nother.\n\n\"Look here, ladies----\" and then he paused, grinned his famous grin\nbefore he said--\"_and bhoys._\" The waiting-room laughed so loudly at\nthis that he had to hold both hands up. \"It's no good waiting this\nmorning. Come back Monday; I'm expecting several calls on Monday.\"\n\nMiss Moss made a desperate rush forward. \"Mr. Bithem, I wonder if\nyou've heard from . . .\"\n\n\"Now let me see,\" said Mr. Bithem slowly, staring; he had only seen\nMiss Moss four times a week for the past--how many weeks? \"Now, who\nare you?\"\n\n\"Miss Ada Moss.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes; of course, my dear. Not yet, my dear. Now I had a call\nfor twenty-eight ladies to-day, but they had to be young and able to\nhop it a bit--see? And I had another call for sixteen--but they had to\nknow something about sand-dancing. Look here, my dear, I'm up to the\neyebrows this morning. Come back on Monday week; it's no good coming\nbefore that.\" He gave her a whole grin to herself and patted her fat\nback. \"Hearts of oak, dear lady,\" said Mr. Bithem, \"hearts of oak!\"\n\nAt the North-East Film Company the crowd was all the way up the\nstairs. Miss Moss found herself next to a fair little baby thing about\nthirty in a white lace hat with cherries round it.\n\n\"What a crowd!\" said she. \"Anything special on?\"\n\n\"_Didn't_ you know, dear?\" said the baby, opening her immense pale\neyes. \"There was a call at nine-thirty for _attractive_ girls. We've\nall been waiting for _hours._ Have you played for this company\nbefore?\" Miss Moss put her head on one side. \"No, I don't think I\nhave.\"\n\n\"They're a lovely company to play for,\" said the baby. \"A friend of\nmine has a friend who gets thirty pounds a day. . . . Have you\n_arcted_ much for the _fil_-lums?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not an actress by profession,\" confessed Miss Moss. \"I'm a\ncontralto singer. But things have been so bad lately that I've been\ndoing a little.\"\n\n\"It's _like_ that, isn't it, dear?\" said the baby.\n\n\"I had a splendid education at the College of Music,\" said Miss Moss,\n\"and I got my silver medal for singing. I've often sung at West End\nconcerts. But I thought, for a change, I'd try my luck . . .\"\n\n\"Yes, it's _like_ that, isn't it, dear?\" said the baby.\n\nAt that moment a beautiful typist appeared at the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Are you all waiting for the North-East call?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" cried the chorus.\n\n\"Well, it's off. I've just had a phone through.\"\n\n\"But look here! What about our expenses?\" shouted a voice.\n\nThe typist looked down at them, and she couldn't help laughing.\n\n\"Oh, you weren't to have been _paid._ The North-East never _pay_ their\ncrowds.\"\n\nThere was only a little round window at the Bitter Orange Company. No\nwaiting-room--nobody at all except a girl, who came to the window when\nMiss Moss knocked, and said: \"Well?\"\n\n\"Can I see the producer, please?\" said Miss Moss pleasantly. The girl\nleaned on the window-bar, half shut her eyes and seemed to go to sleep\nfor a moment. Miss Moss smiled at her. The girl not only frowned; she\nseemed to smell something vaguely unpleasant; she sniffed. Suddenly\nshe moved away, came back with a paper and thrust it at Miss Moss.\n\n\"Fill up the form!\" said she. And banged the window down.\n\n\"Can you aviate--high-dive--drive a car--buck-jump--shoot?\" read Miss\nMoss. She walked along the street asking herself those questions.\nThere was a high, cold wind blowing; it tugged at her, slapped her\nface, jeered; it knew she could not answer them. In the Square Gardens\nshe found a little wire basket to drop the form into. And then she sat\ndown on one of the benches to powder her nose. But the person in the\npocket mirror made a hideous face at her, and that was too much for\nMiss Moss; she had a good cry. It cheered her wonderfully.\n\n\"Well, that's over,\" she sighed. \"It's one comfort to be off my feet.\nAnd my nose will soon get cool in the air. . . . It's very nice in\nhere. Look at the sparrows. Cheep. Cheep. How close they come. I\nexpect somebody feeds them. No, I've nothing for you, you cheeky\nlittle things. . . .\" She looked away from them. What was the big\nbuilding opposite--the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Madrid? My goodness, what a smack that\nlittle child came down! Poor little mite! Never mind--up again. . . .\nBy eight o'clock to-night . . . Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Madrid. \"I could just go in\nand sit there and have a coffee, that's all,\" thought Miss Moss. \"It's\nsuch a place for artists too. I might just have a stroke of luck.\n. . . A dark handsome gentleman in a fur coat comes in with a friend,\nand sits at my table, perhaps. 'No, old chap, I've searched London for\na contralto and I can't find a soul. You see, the music is difficult;\nhave a look at it.'\" And Miss Moss heard herself saying: \"Excuse me,\nI happen to be a contralto, and I have sung that part many times.\n. . . Extraordinary! 'Come back to my studio and I'll try your voice\nnow.' . . . Ten pounds a week. . . . Why should I feel nervous? It's\nnot nervousness. Why shouldn't I go to the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Madrid? I'm a\nrespectable woman--I'm a contralto singer. And I'm only trembling\nbecause I've had nothing to eat to-day. . . . 'A nice little piece of\nevidence, _my lady._' . . . Very well, Mrs. Pine. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Madrid. They\nhave concerts there in the evenings. . . . 'Why don't they begin?' The\ncontralto has not arrived. . . . 'Excuse me, I happen to be a\ncontralto; I have sung that music many times.'\"\n\nIt was almost dark in the caf\u00c3\u00a9. Men, palms, red plush seats, white\nmarble tables, waiters in aprons, Miss Moss walked through them all.\nHardly had she sat down when a very stout gentleman wearing a very\nsmall hat that floated on the top of his head like a little yacht\nflopped into the chair opposite hers.\n\n\"Good evening!\" said he.\n\nMiss Moss said, in her cheerful way: \"Good evening!\"\n\n\"Fine evening,\" said the stout gentleman.\n\n\"Yes, very fine. Quite a treat, isn't it?\" said she.\n\nHe crooked a sausage finger at the waiter--\"Bring me a large whisky\"\n--and turned to Miss Moss. \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"Well, I think I'll take a brandy if it's all the same.\"\n\nFive minutes later the stout gentleman leaned across the table and\nblew a puff of cigar smoke full in her face.\n\n\"That's a tempting bit o' ribbon!\" said he.\n\nMiss Moss blushed until a pulse at the top of her head that she never\nhad felt before pounded away.\n\n\"I always was one for pink,\" said she.\n\nThe stout gentleman considered her, drumming with her fingers on the\ntable.\n\n\"I like 'em firm and well covered,\" said he.\n\nMiss Moss, to her surprise, gave a loud snigger.\n\nFive minutes later the stout gentleman heaved himself up. \"Well, am I\ngoin' your way, or are you comin' mine?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'll come with you, if it's all the same,\" said Miss Moss. And she\nsailed after the little yacht out of the caf\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN WITHOUT A TEMPERAMENT\n\nHE stood at the hall door turning the ring, turning the heavy signet\nring upon his little finger while his glance travelled coolly,\ndeliberately, over the round tables and basket chairs scattered about\nthe glassed-in verandah. He pursed his lips--he might have been going\nto whistle--but he did not whistle--only turned the ring--turned the\nring on his pink, freshly washed hands.\n\nOver in the corner sat The Two Topknots, drinking a decoction they\nalways drank at this hour--something whitish, greyish, in glasses,\nwith little husks floating on the top--and rooting in a tin full of\npaper shavings for pieces of speckled biscuit, which they broke,\ndropped into the glasses and fished for with spoons. Their two coils\nof knitting, like two snakes, slumbered beside the tray.\n\nThe American Woman sat where she always sat against the glass wall, in\nthe shadow of a great creeping thing with wide open purple eyes that\npressed--that flattened itself against the glass, hungrily watching\nher. And she knoo it was there--she knoo it was looking at her just\nthat way. She played up to it; she gave herself little airs. Sometimes\nshe even pointed at it, crying: \"Isn't that the most terrible thing\nyou've ever seen! Isn't that ghoulish!\" It was on the other side of\nthe verandah, after all . . . and besides it couldn't touch her, could\nit, Klaymongso? She was an American Woman, wasn't she Klaymongso, and\nshe'd just go right away to her Consul. Klaymongso, curled in her lap,\nwith her torn antique brocade bag, a grubby handkerchief, and a pile\nof letters from home on top of him, sneezed for reply.\n\nThe other tables were empty. A glance passed between the American and\nthe Topknots. She gave a foreign little shrug; they waved an\nunderstanding biscuit. But he saw nothing. Now he was still, now from\nhis eyes you saw he listened. \"Hoo-e-zip-zoo-oo!\" sounded the lift.\nThe iron cage clanged open. Light dragging steps sounded across the\nhall, coming towards him. A hand, like a leaf, fell on his shoulder. A\nsoft voice said: \"Let's go and sit over there--where we can see the\ndrive. The trees are so lovely.\" And he moved forward with the hand\nstill on his shoulder, and the light, dragging steps beside his. He\npulled out a chair and she sank into it, slowly, leaning her head\nagainst the back, her arms falling along the sides.\n\n\"Won't you bring the other up closer? It's such miles away.\" But he\ndid not move.\n\n\"Where's your shawl?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh!\" She gave a little groan of dismay. \"How silly I am, I've left it\nupstairs on the bed. Never mind. Please don't go for it. I shan't want\nit, I know I shan't.\"\n\n\"You'd better have it.\" And he turned and swiftly crossed the verandah\ninto the dim hall with its scarlet plush and gilt furniture--conjuror's\nfurniture--its Notice of Services at the English Church,\nits green baize board with the unclaimed letters climbing the black\nlattice, huge \"Presentation\" clock that struck the hours at the\nhalf-hours, bundles of sticks and umbrellas and sunshades in the clasp\nof a brown wooden bear, past the two crippled palms, two ancient\nbeggars at the foot of the staircase, up the marble stairs three at a\ntime, past the life-size group on the landing of two stout peasant\nchildren with their marble pinnies full of marble grapes, and along\nthe corridor, with its piled-up wreckage of old tin boxes, leather\ntrunks, canvas hold-alls, to their room.\n\nThe servant girl was in their room, singing loudly while she emptied\nsoapy water into a pail. The windows were open wide, the shutters put\nback, and the light glared in. She had thrown the carpets and the big\nwhite pillows over the balcony rails; the nets were looped up from the\nbeds; on the writing table there stood a pan of fluff and match-ends.\nWhen she saw him her small impudent eyes snapped and her singing\nchanged to humming. But he gave no sign. His eyes searched the glaring\nroom. Where the devil was the shawl!\n\n\"_Vous desirez, Monsieur?_\" mocked the servant girl.\n\nNo answer. He had seen it. He strode across the room, grabbed the grey\ncobweb and went out, banging the door. The servant girl's voice at its\nloudest and shrillest followed him along the corridor.\n\n\"Oh, there you are. What happened? What kept you? The tea's here, you\nsee. I've just sent Antonio off for the hot water. Isn't it\nextraordinary? I must have told him about it sixty times at least, and\nstill he doesn't bring it. Thank you. That's very nice. One does just\nfeel the air when one bends forward.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" He took his tea and sat down in the other chair. \"No,\nnothing to eat.\"\n\n\"Oh do! Just one, you had so little at lunch and it's hours before\ndinner.\"\n\nHer shawl dropped off as she bent forward to hand him the biscuits. He\ntook one and put it in his saucer.\n\n\"Oh, those trees along the drive,\" she cried, \"I could look at them\nfor ever. They are like the most exquisite huge ferns. And you see\nthat one with the grey-silver bark and the clusters of cream coloured\nflowers, I pulled down a head of them yesterday to smell and the\nscent\"--she shut her eyes at the memory and her voice thinned away,\nfaint, airy--\"was like freshly ground nutmegs.\" A little pause. She\nturned to him and smiled. \"You do know what nutmegs smell like--do\nyou, Robert?\"\n\nAnd he smiled back at her. \"Now how am I going to prove to you that I\ndo?\"\n\nBack came Antonio with not only the hot water--with letters on a\nsalver and three rolls of paper.\n\n\"Oh, the post! Oh, how lovely! Oh, Robert, they mustn't be all for\nyou! Have they just come, Antonio?\" Her thin hands flew up and hovered\nover the letters that Antonio offered her, bending forward.\n\n\"Just this moment, Signora,\" grinned Antonio. \"I took-a them from the\npostman myself. I made-a the postman give them for me.\"\n\n\"Noble Antonio!\" laughed she. \"There--those are mine, Robert; the rest\nare yours.\"\n\nAntonio wheeled sharply, stiffened, the grin went out of his face. His\nstriped linen jacket and his flat gleaming fringe made him look like a\nwooden doll.\n\nMr. Salesby put the letters into his pocket; the papers lay on the\ntable. He turned the ring, turned the signet ring on his little finger\nand stared in front of him, blinking, vacant.\n\nBut she--with her teacup in one hand, the sheets of thin paper in the\nother, her head tilted back, her lips open, a brush of bright colour\non her cheek-bones, sipped, sipped, drank . . . drank. . . .\n\n\"From Lottie,\" came her soft murmur. \"Poor dear . . . such trouble\n. . . left foot. She thought . . . neuritis . . . Doctor Blyth . . .\nflat foot . . . massage. So many robins this year . . . maid most\nsatisfactory . . . Indian Colonel . . . every grain of rice separate\n. . . very heavy fall of snow.\" And her wide lighted eyes looked up\nfrom the letter. \"Snow, Robert! Think of it!\" And she touched the\nlittle dark violets pinned on her thin bosom and went back to the\nletter.\n\n\n\n. . . Snow. Snow in London. Millie with the early morning cup of tea.\n\"There's been a terrible fall of snow in the night, Sir.\" \"Oh, has\nthere, Millie?\" The curtains ring apart, letting in the pale,\nreluctant light. He raises himself in the bed; he catches a glimpse of\nthe solid houses opposite framed in white, of their window boxes full\nof great sprays of white coral. . . . In the bathroom--overlooking the\nback garden. Snow--heavy snow over everything. The lawn is covered\nwith a wavy pattern of cat's paws; there is a thick, thick icing on\nthe garden table; the withered pods of the laburnum tree are white\ntassels; only here and there in the ivy is a dark leaf showing. . . .\nWarming his back at the dining-room fire, the paper drying over a\nchair. Millie with the bacon. \"Oh, if you please, Sir, there's two\nlittle boys come as will do the steps and front for a shilling, shall\nI let them?\" . . . And then flying lightly, lightly down the\nstairs--Jinnie. \"Oh, Robert, isn't it wonderful! Oh, what a pity it\nhas to melt. Where's the pussy-wee?\" \"I'll get him from Millie\" . . .\n\"Millie, you might just hand me up the kitten if you've got him down\nthere.\" \"Very good, Sir.\" He feels the little beating heart under his\nhand. \"Come on, old chap, your Missus wants you.\" \"Oh, Robert, do show\nhim the snow--his first snow. Shall I open the window and give him a\nlittle piece on his paw to hold? . . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's very satisfactory on the whole--very. Poor Lottie!\nDarling Anne! How I only wish I could send them something of this,\"\nshe cried, waving her letters at the brilliant, dazzling garden. \"More\ntea, Robert? Robert dear, more tea?\"\n\n\"No, thanks, no. It was very good,\" he drawled.\n\n\"Well mine wasn't. Mine was just like chopped hay. Oh, here comes the\nHoneymoon Couple.\"\n\nHalf striding, half running, carrying a basket between them and rods\nand lines, they came up the drive, up the shallow steps.\n\n\"My! have you been out fishing?\" cried the American Woman.\n\nThey were out of breath, they panted: \"Yes, yes, we have been out in a\nlittle boat all day. We have caught seven. Four are good to eat. But\nthree we shall give away. To the children.\"\n\nMrs. Salesby turned her chair to look; the Topknots laid the snakes\ndown. They were a very dark young couple--black hair, olive skin,\nbrilliant eyes and teeth. He was dressed \"English fashion\" in a\nflannel jacket, white trousers and shoes. Round his neck he wore a\nsilk scarf; his head, with his hair brushed back, was bare. And he\nkept mopping his forehead, rubbing his hands with a brilliant\nhandkerchief. Her white skirt had a patch of wet; her neck and throat\nwere stained a deep pink. When she lifted her arms big half-hoops of\nperspiration showed under her arm-pits; her hair clung in wet curls to\nher cheeks. She looked as though her young husband had been dipping\nher in the sea, and fishing her out again to dry in the sun and\nthen--in with her again--all day.\n\n\"Would Klaymongso like a fish?\" they cried. Their laughing voices\ncharged with excitement beat against the glassed-in verandah like\nbirds, and a strange saltish smell came from the basket.\n\n\"You will sleep well to-night,\" said a Topknot, picking her ear with a\nknitting needle while the other Topknot smiled and nodded.\n\nThe Honeymoon Couple looked at each other. A great wave seemed to go\nover them. They gasped, gulped, staggered a little and then came up\nlaughing--laughing.\n\n\"We cannot go upstairs, we are too tired. We must have tea just as we\nare. Here--coffee. No--tea. No--coffee. Tea--coffee, Antonio!\" Mrs.\nSalesby turned.\n\n\"Robert! Robert!\" Where was he? He wasn't there. Oh, there he was at\nthe other end of the verandah, with his back turned, smoking a\ncigarette. \"Robert, shall we go for our little turn?\"\n\n\"Right.\" He stumped the cigarette into an ash-tray and sauntered over,\nhis eyes on the ground. \"Will you be warm enough?\"\n\n\"Oh, quite.\"\n\n\"Sure?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she put her hand on his arm, \"perhaps\"--and gave his arm the\nfaintest pressure--\"it's not upstairs, it's only in the hall--perhaps\nyou'd get me my cape. Hanging up.\"\n\nHe came back with it and she bent her small head while he dropped it\non her shoulders. Then, very stiff, he offered her his arm. She bowed\nsweetly to the people on the verandah while he just covered a yawn,\nand they went down the steps together.\n\n\"_Vous avez voo \u00c3\u00a7a!_\" said the American Woman.\n\n\"He is not a man,\" said the Two Topknots, \"he is an ox. I say to my\nsister in the morning and at night when we are in bed, I tell\nher--_No_ man is he, but an ox!\"\n\nWheeling, tumbling, swooping, the laughter of the Honeymoon Couple\ndashed against the glass of the verandah.\n\nThe sun was still high. Every leaf, every flower in the garden lay\nopen, motionless, as if exhausted, and a sweet, rich, rank smell\nfilled the quivering air. Out of the thick, fleshy leaves of a cactus\nthere rose an aloe stem loaded with pale flowers that looked as though\nthey had been cut out of butter; light flashed upon the lifted spears\nof the palms; over a bed of scarlet waxen flowers some big black\ninsects \"zoom-zoomed\"; a great, gaudy creeper, orange splashed with\njet, sprawled against a wall.\n\n\"I don't need my cape after all,\" said she. \"It's really too warm.\" So\nhe took it off and carried it over his arm. \"Let us go down this path\nhere. I feel so well to-day--marvellously better. Good heavens--look\nat those children! And to think it's November!\"\n\nIn a corner of the garden there were two brimming tubs of water. Three\nlittle girls, having thoughtfully taken off their drawers and hung\nthem on a bush, their skirts clasped to their waists, were standing in\nthe tubs and tramping up and down. They screamed, their hair fell over\ntheir faces, they splashed one another. But suddenly, the smallest,\nwho had a tub to herself, glanced up and saw who was looking. For a\nmoment she seemed overcome with terror, then clumsily she struggled\nand strained out of her tub, and still holding her clothes above her\nwaist. \"The Englishman! The Englishman!\" she shrieked and fled away to\nhide. Shrieking and screaming, the other two followed her. In a moment\nthey were gone; in a moment there was nothing but the two brimming\ntubs and their little drawers on the bush.\n\n\"How--very--extraordinary!\" said she. \"What made them so frightened?\nSurely they were much too young to . . .\" She looked up at him. She\nthought he looked pale--but wonderfully handsome with that great\ntropical tree behind him with its long, spiked thorns.\n\nFor a moment he did not answer. Then he met her glance, and smiling\nhis slow smile, \"_Tr\u00c3\u00a8s_ rum!\" said he.\n\n_Tr\u00c3\u00a8s_ rum! Oh, she felt quite faint. Oh, why should she love him so\nmuch just because he said a thing like that. _Tr\u00c3\u00a8s_ rum! That was\nRobert all over. Nobody else but Robert could ever say such a thing.\nTo be so wonderful, so brilliant, so learned, and then to say in that\nqueer, boyish voice. . . . She could have wept.\n\n\"You know you're very absurd, sometimes,\" said she.\n\n\"I am,\" he answered. And they walked on.\n\nBut she was tired. She had had enough. She did not want to walk any\nmore.\n\n\"Leave me here and go for a little constitutional, won't you? I'll be\nin one of these long chairs. What a good thing you've got my cape; you\nwon't have to go upstairs for a rug. Thank you, Robert, I shall look\nat that delicious heliotrope. . . . You won't be gone long?\"\n\n\"No--no. You don't mind being left?\"\n\n\"Silly! I want you to go. I can't expect you to drag after your\ninvalid wife every minute. . . . How long will you be?\"\n\nHe took out his watch. \"It's just after half-past four. I'll be back\nat a quarter past five.\"\n\n\"Back at a quarter past five,\" she repeated, and she lay still in the\nlong chair and folded her hands.\n\nHe turned away. Suddenly he was back again. \"Look here, would you like\nmy watch?\" And he dangled it before her.\n\n\"Oh!\" She caught her breath. \"Very, very much.\" And she clasped the\nwatch, the warm watch, the darling watch in her fingers. \"Now go\nquickly.\"\n\nThe gates of the Pension Villa Excelsior were open wide, jammed open\nagainst some bold geraniums. Stooping a little, staring straight\nahead, walking swiftly, he passed through them and began climbing the\nhill that wound behind the town like a great rope looping the villas\ntogether. The dust lay thick. A carriage came bowling along driving\ntowards the Excelsior. In it sat the General and the Countess; they\nhad been for his daily airing. Mr. Salesby stepped to one side but the\ndust beat up, thick, white, stifling like wool. The Countess just had\ntime to nudge the General.\n\n\"There he goes,\" she said spitefully.\n\nBut the General gave a loud caw and refused to look.\n\n\"It is the Englishman,\" said the driver, turning round and smiling.\nAnd the Countess threw up her hands and nodded so amiably that he spat\nwith satisfaction and gave the stumbling horse a cut.\n\nOn--on--past the finest villas in the town, magnificent palaces,\npalaces worth coming any distance to see, past the public gardens with\nthe carved grottoes and statues and stone animals drinking at the\nfountain, into a poorer quarter. Here the road ran narrow and foul\nbetween high lean houses, the ground floors of which were scooped and\nhollowed into stables and carpenters' shops. At a fountain ahead of\nhim two old hags were beating linen. As he passed them they squatted\nback on their haunches, stared, and then their \"A-hak-kak-kak!\" with\nthe slap, slap, of the stone on the linen sounded after him.\n\nHe reached the top of the hill; he turned a corner and the town was\nhidden. Down he looked into a deep valley with a dried up river bed at\nthe bottom. This side and that was covered with small dilapidated\nhouses that had broken stone verandahs where the fruit lay drying,\ntomato lanes in the garden, and from the gates to the doors a trellis\nof vines. The late sunlight, deep, golden, lay in the cup of the\nvalley; there was a smell of charcoal in the air. In the gardens the\nmen were cutting grapes. He watched a man standing in the greenish\nshade, raising up, holding a black cluster in one hand, taking the\nknife from his belt, cutting, laying the bunch in a flat boat-shaped\nbasket. The man worked leisurely, silently, taking hundreds of years\nover the job. On the hedges on the other side of the road there were\ngrapes small as berries, growing wild, growing among the stones. He\nleaned against a wall, filled his pipe, put a match to it. . . .\n\n\n\nLeaned across a gate, turned up the collar of his mackintosh. It was\ngoing to rain. It didn't matter, he was prepared for it. You didn't\nexpect anything else in November. He looked over the bare field. From\nthe corner by the gate there came the smell of swedes, a great stack\nof them, wet, rank coloured. Two men passed walking towards the\nstraggling village. \"Good day!\" \"Good day!\" By Jove! he had to hurry\nif he was going to catch that train home. Over the gate, across a\nfield, over the stile, into the lane, swinging along in the drifting\nrain and dusk. . . . Just home in time for a bath and a change before\nsupper. . . . In the drawing-room; Jinnie is sitting pretty nearly in\nthe fire. \"Oh, Robert, I didn't hear you come in. Did you have a good\ntime? How nice you smell! A present?\" \"Some bits of blackberry I\npicked for you. Pretty colour.\" \"Oh, lovely, Robert! Dennis and Beaty\nare coming to supper.\" Supper--cold beef, potatoes in their jackets,\nclaret, household bread. They are gay--everybody's laughing. \"Oh, we\nall know Robert,\" says Dennis, breathing on his eyeglasses and\npolishing them. \"By the way, Dennis, I picked up a very jolly little\nedition of . . .\"\n\n\n\nA clock struck. He wheeled sharply. What time was it. Five? A quarter\npast? Back, back the way he came. As he passed through the gates he\nsaw her on the look-out. She got up, waved and slowly she came to meet\nhim, dragging the heavy cape. In her hand she carried a spray of\nheliotrope.\n\n\"You're late,\" she cried gaily. \"You're three minutes late. Here's\nyour watch, it's been very good while you were away. Did you have a\nnice time? Was it lovely? Tell me. Where did you go?\"\n\n\"I say--put this _on_,\" he said, taking the cape from her.\n\n\"Yes, I will. Yes, it's getting chilly. Shall we go up to our room?\"\n\nWhen they reached the lift she was coughing. He frowned.\n\n\"It's nothing. I haven't been out too late. Don't be cross.\" She sat\ndown on one of the red plush chairs while he rang and rang, and then,\ngetting no answer, kept his finger on the bell.\n\n\"Oh, Robert, do you think you ought to?\"\n\n\"Ought to what?\"\n\nThe door of the _salon_ opened. \"What is that? Who is making that\nnoise?\" sounded from within. Klaymongso began to yelp. \"Caw! Caw!\nCaw!\" came from the General. A Topknot darted out with one hand to her\near, opened the staff door, \"Mr. Queet! Mr. Queet!\" she bawled. That\nbrought the manager up at a run.\n\n\"Is that you ringing the bell, Mr. Salesby? Do you want the lift? Very\ngood, Sir. I'll take you up myself. Antonio wouldn't have been a\nminute, he was just taking off his apron----\" And having ushered them\nin, the oily manager went to the door of the _salon._ \"Very sorry you\nshould have been troubled, ladies and gentlemen.\" Salesby stood in the\ncage, sucking in his cheeks, staring at the ceiling and turning the\nring, turning the signet ring on his little finger. . . .\n\nArrived in their room he went swiftly over to the washstand, shook the\nbottle, poured her out a dose and brought it across.\n\n\"Sit down. Drink it. And don't talk.\" And he stood over her while she\nobeyed. Then he took the glass, rinsed it and put it back in its case.\n\"Would you like a cushion?\"\n\n\"No, I'm quite all right. Come over here. Sit down by me just a\nminute, will you, Robert? Ah, that's very nice.\" She turned and thrust\nthe piece of heliotrope in the lapel of his coat. \"That,\" she said,\n\"is most becoming.\" And then she leaned her head against his shoulder,\nand he put his arm round her.\n\n\"Robert----\" her voice like a sigh--like a breath.\n\n\"Yes----\"\n\nThey sat there for a long while. The sky flamed, paled; the two white\nbeds were like two ships. . . . At last he heard the servant girl\nrunning along the corridor with the hot water cans, and gently he\nreleased her and turned on the light.\n\n\"Oh, what time is it? Oh, what a heavenly evening. Oh, Robert, I was\nthinking while you were away this afternoon . . .\"\n\nThey were the last couple to enter the dining-room. The Countess was\nthere with her lorgnette and her fan, the General was there with his\nspecial chair and the air cushion and the small rug over his knees.\nThe American Woman was there showing Klaymongso a copy of the\n_Saturday Evening Post._ . . . \"We're having a feast of reason and a\nflow of soul.\" The Two Topknots were there feeling over the peaches\nand the pears in their dish of fruit, and putting aside all they\nconsidered unripe or overripe to show to the manager, and the\nHoneymoon Couple leaned across the table, whispering, trying not to\nburst out laughing.\n\nMr. Queet, in everyday clothes and white canvas shoes, served the\nsoup, and Antonio, in full evening dress, handed it round.\n\n\"No,\" said the American Woman, \"take it away, Antonio. We can't eat\nsoup. We can't eat anything mushy, can we, Klaymongso?\"\n\n\"Take them back and fill them to the rim!\" said the Topknots, and they\nturned and watched while Antonio delivered the message.\n\n\"What is it? Rice? Is it cooked?\" The Countess peered through her\nlorgnette. \"Mr. Queet, the General can have some of this soup if it is\ncooked.\"\n\n\"Very good, Countess.\"\n\nThe Honeymoon Couple had their fish instead.\n\n\"Give me that one. That's the one I caught. No it's not. Yes, it is.\nNo it's not. Well, it's looking at me with its eye so it must be. Tee!\nHee! Hee!\" Their feet were locked together under the table.\n\n\"Robert, you're not eating again. Is anything the matter?\"\n\n\"No. Off food, that's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a bother. There are eggs and spinach coming. You don't like\nspinach, do you. I must tell them in future . . .\"\n\nAn egg and mashed potatoes for the General.\n\n\"Mr. Queet! Mr. Queet!\"\n\n\"Yes, Countess.\"\n\n\"The General's egg's too hard again.\"\n\n\"Caw! Caw! Caw!\"\n\n\"Very sorry, Countess. Shall I have you another cooked, General?\"\n\n. . . They are the first to leave the dining-room. She rises,\ngathering her shawl and he stands aside, waiting for her to pass,\nturning the ring, turning the signet ring on his little finger. In the\nhall Mr. Queet hovers. \"I thought you might not want to wait for the\nlift. Antonio's just serving the finger bowls. And I'm sorry the bell\nwon't ring, it's out of order. I can't think what's happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do hope . . .\" from her.\n\n\"Get in,\" says he.\n\nMr. Queet steps after them and slams the door. . . .\n\n. . . \"Robert, do you mind if I go to bed very soon? Won't you go down\nto the _salon_ or out into the garden? Or perhaps you might smoke a\ncigar on the balcony. It's lovely out there. And I like cigar smoke. I\nalways did. But if you'd rather . . .\"\n\n\"No, I'll sit here.\"\n\nHe takes a chair and sits on the balcony. He hears her moving about in\nthe room, lightly, lightly, moving and rustling. Then she comes over\nto him. \"Good night, Robert.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He takes her hand and kisses the palm. \"Don't catch\ncold.\"\n\nThe sky is the colour of jade. There are a great many stars; an\nenormous white moon hangs over the garden. Far away lightning\nflutters--flutters like a wing--flutters like a broken bird that tries\nto fly and sinks again and again struggles.\n\nThe lights from the _salon_ shine across the garden path and there is\nthe sound of a piano. And once the American Woman, opening the French\nwindow to let Klaymongso into the garden, cries: \"Have you seen this\nmoon?\" But nobody answers.\n\nHe gets very cold sitting there, staring at the balcony rail. Finally\nhe comes inside. The moon--the room is painted white with moonlight.\nThe light trembles in the mirrors; the two beds seem to float. She is\nasleep. He sees her through the nets, half sitting, banked up with\npillows, her white hands crossed on the sheet. Her white cheeks, her\nfair hair pressed against the pillow, are silvered over. He undresses\nquickly, stealthily and gets into bed. Lying there, his hands clasped\nbehind his head. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . In his study. Late summer. The Virginia creeper just on the\nturn. . . .\n\n\"Well, my dear chap, that's the whole story. That's the long and the\nshort of it. If she can't cut away for the next two years and give a\ndecent climate a chance she don't stand a dog's--h'm--show. Better be\nfrank about these things.\" \"Oh, certainly. . . .\" \"And hang it all,\nold man, what's to prevent you going with her? It isn't as though\nyou've got a regular job like us wage earners. You can do what you do\nwherever you are----\" \"Two years.\" \"Yes, I should give it two years.\nYou'll have no trouble about letting this house you know. As a matter\nof fact . . .\"\n\n. . . He is with her. \"Robert, the awful thing is--I suppose it's my\nillness--I simply feel I could not go alone. You see--you're\neverything. You're bread and wine, Robert, bread and wine. Oh, my\ndarling--what am I saying? Of course I could, of course I won't take\nyou away. . . .\"\n\n\n\nHe hears her stirring. Does she want something?\n\n\"Boogles?\"\n\nGood Lord! She is talking in her sleep. They haven't used that name\nfor years.\n\n\"Boogles. Are you awake?\"\n\n\"Yes, do you want anything?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm going to be a bother. I'm so sorry. Do you mind? There's a\nwretched mosquito inside my net--I can hear him singing. Would you\ncatch him? I don't want to move because of my heart.\"\n\n\"No, don't move. Stay where you are.\" He switches on the light, lifts\nthe net. \"Where is the little beggar? Have you spotted him?\"\n\n\"Yes, there, over by the corner. Oh, I do feel such a fiend to have\ndragged you out of bed. Do you mind dreadfully?\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\" For a moment he hovers in his blue and white\npyjamas. Then, \"got him,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, good. Was he a juicy one?\"\n\n\"Beastly.\" He went over to the washstand and dipped his fingers in\nwater. \"Are you all right now? Shall I switch off the light?\"\n\n\"Yes, please. No. Boogles! Come back here a moment. Sit down by me.\nGive me your hand.\" She turns his signet ring. \"Why weren't you\nasleep? Boogles, listen. Come closer. I sometimes wonder--do you mind\nawfully being out here with me?\"\n\nHe bends down. He kisses her. He tucks her in, he smoothes the pillow.\n\n\"Rot!\" he whispers.\n\n\n\n\nMR. REGINALD PEACOCK'S DAY\n\nIF there was one thing that he hated more than another it was the way\nshe had of waking him in the morning. She did it on purpose, of\ncourse. It was her way of establishing her grievance for the day, and\nhe was not going to let her know how successful it was. But really,\nreally, to wake a sensitive person like that was positively dangerous!\nIt took him hours to get over it--simply hours. She came into the room\nbuttoned up in an overall, with a handkerchief over her head--thereby\nproving that she had been up herself and slaving since dawn--and\ncalled in a low, warning voice: \"Reginald!\"\n\n\"Eh! What! What's that? What's the matter?\"\n\n\"It's time to get up; it's half-past eight.\" And out she went,\nshutting the door quietly after her, to gloat over her triumph, he\nsupposed.\n\nHe rolled over in the big bed, his heart still beating in quick, dull\nthrobs, and with every throb he felt his energy escaping him, his--his\ninspiration for the day stifling under those thudding blows. It seemed\nthat she took a malicious delight in making life more difficult for\nhim than--Heaven knows--it was, by denying him his rights as an\nartist, by trying to drag him down to her level. What was the matter\nwith her? What the hell did she want? Hadn't he three times as many\npupils now as when they were first married, earned three times as\nmuch, paid for every stick and stone that they possessed, and now had\nbegun to shell out for Adrian's kindergarten? . . . And had he ever\nreproached her for not having a penny to her name? Never a word--never\na sign! The truth was that once you married a woman she became\ninsatiable, and the truth was that nothing was more fatal for an\nartist than marriage, at any rate until he was well over forty. . . .\nWhy had he married her? He asked himself this question on an average\nabout three times a day, but he never could answer it satisfactorily.\nShe had caught him at a weak moment, when the first plunge into\nreality had bewildered and overwhelmed him for a time. Looking back,\nhe saw a pathetic, youthful creature, half child, half wild untamed\nbird, totally incompetent to cope with bills and creditors and all the\nsordid details of existence. Well--she had done her best to clip his\nwings, if that was any satisfaction for her, and she could\ncongratulate herself on the success of this early morning trick. One\nought to wake exquisitely, reluctantly, he thought, slipping down in\nthe warm bed. He began to imagine a series of enchanting scenes which\nended with his latest, most charming pupil putting her bare, scented\narms round his neck, and covering him with her long, perfumed hair.\n\"Awake, my love!\" . . .\n\nAs was his daily habit, while the bath water ran, Reginald Peacock\ntried his voice.\n\n  When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror,\n  Looping up her laces, tying up her hair,\n\nhe sang, softly at first, listening to the quality, nursing his voice\nuntil he came to the third line:\n\n  Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded . . .\n\nand upon the word \"wedded\" he burst into such a shout of triumph that\nthe tooth-glass on the bathroom shelf trembled and even the bath tap\nseemed to gush stormy applause. . . .\n\nWell, there was nothing wrong with his voice, he thought, leaping into\nthe bath and soaping his soft, pink body all over with a loofah shaped\nlike a fish. He could fill Covent Garden with it! \"_Wedded_,\" he\nshouted again, seizing the towel with a magnificent operatic gesture,\nand went on singing while he rubbed as though he had been Lohengrin\ntipped out by an unwary Swan and drying himself in the greatest haste\nbefore that tiresome Elsa came along along. . . .\n\nBack in his bedroom, he pulled the blind up with a jerk, and standing\nupon the pale square of sunlight that lay upon the carpet like a sheet\nof cream blotting-paper, he began to do his exercises--deep breathing,\nbending forward and back, squatting like a frog and shooting out his\nlegs--for if there was one thing he had a horror of it was of getting\nfat, and men in his profession had a dreadful tendency that way.\nHowever, there was no sign of it at present. He was, he decided, just\nright, just in good proportion. In fact, he could not help a thrill of\nsatisfaction when he saw himself in the glass, dressed in a morning\ncoat, dark grey trousers, grey socks and a black tie with a silver\nthread in it. Not that he was vain--he couldn't stand vain men--no;\nthe sight of himself gave him a thrill of purely artistic\nsatisfaction. \"_Voil\u00c3\u00a0 tout!\"_ said he, passing his hand over his sleek\nhair.\n\nThat little, easy French phrase blown so lightly from his lips, like a\nwhiff of smoke, reminded him that someone had asked him again, the\nevening before, if he was English. People seemed to find it impossible\nto believe that he hadn't some Southern blood. True, there was an\nemotional quality in his singing that had nothing of the John Bull in\nit. . . . The door-handle rattled and turned round and round. Adrian's\nhead popped through.\n\n\"Please, father, mother says breakfast is quite ready, please.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Reginald. Then, just as Adrian disappeared:\n\"Adrian!\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"You haven't said 'good morning.'\"\n\nA few months ago Reginald had spent a week-end in a very aristocratic\nfamily, where the father received his little sons in the morning and\nshook hands with them. Reginald thought the practice charming, and\nintroduced it immediately, but Adrian felt dreadfully silly at having\nto shake hands with his own father every morning. And why did his\nfather always sort of sing to him instead of talk? . . .\n\nIn excellent temper, Reginald walked into the dining-room and sat down\nbefore a pile of letters, a copy of the _Times_, and a little covered\ndish. He glanced at the letters and then at his breakfast. There were\ntwo thin slices of bacon and one egg.\n\n\"Don't you want any bacon?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I prefer a cold baked apple. I don't feel the need of bacon every\nmorning.\"\n\nNow, did she mean that there was no need for him to have bacon every\nmorning, either, and that she grudged having to cook it for him?\n\n\"If you don't want to cook the breakfast,\" said he, \"why don't you\nkeep a servant? You know we can afford one, and you know how I loathe\nto see my wife doing the work. Simply because all the women we have\nhad in the past have been failures and utterly upset my regime, and\nmade it almost impossible for me to have any pupils here, you've given\nup trying to find a decent woman. It's not impossible to train a\nservant--is it? I mean, it doesn't require genius?\"\n\n\"But I prefer to do the work myself; it makes life so much more\npeaceful. . . . Run along, Adrian darling, and get ready for school.\"\n\n\"Oh no, that's not it!\" Reginald pretended to smile. \"You do the work\nyourself, because, for some extraordinary reason, you love to\nhumiliate me. Objectively, you may not know that, but, subjectively,\nit's the case.\" This last remark so delighted him that he cut open an\nenvelope as gracefully as if he had been on the stage. . . .\n\n\n\"DEAR MR. PEACOCK,\n\nI feel I cannot go to sleep until I have thanked you again for the\nwonderful joy your singing gave me this evening. Quite unforgettable.\nYou make me wonder, as I have not wondered since I was a girl, if this\nis _all._ I mean, if this ordinary world is _all._ If there is not,\nperhaps, for those of us who understand, divine beauty and richness\nawaiting us if we only have the _courage_ to see it. And to make it\nours. . . . The house is so quiet. I wish you were here now that I\nmight thank you in person. You are doing a great thing. You are\nteaching the world to escape from life!\n\nYours, most sincerely,\n  \u00c3\u0086NONE FELL.\n\nP.S.--I am in every afternoon this week. . . .\"\n\n\nThe letter was scrawled in violet ink on thick, handmade paper.\nVanity, that bright bird, lifted its wings again, lifted them until he\nfelt his breast would break.\n\n\"Oh well, don't let us quarrel,\" said he, and actually flung out a\nhand to his wife.\n\nBut she was not great enough to respond.\n\n\"I must hurry and take Adrian to school,\" said she. \"Your room is\nquite ready for you.\"\n\nVery well--very well--let there be open war between them! But he was\nhanged if he'd be the first to make it up again!\n\nHe walked up and down his room, and was not calm again until he heard\nthe outer door close upon Adrian and his wife. Of course, if this went\non, he would have to make some other arrangement. That was obvious.\nTied and bound like this, how could he help the world to escape from\nlife? He opened the piano and looked up his pupils for the morning.\nMiss Betty Brittle, the Countess Wilkowska and Miss Marian Morrow.\nThey were charming, all three.\n\nPunctually at half-past ten the door-bell rang. He went to the door.\nMiss Betty Brittle was there, dressed in white, with her music in a\nblue silk case.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm early,\" she said, blushing and shy, and she opened her\nbig blue eyes very wide. \"Am I?\"\n\n\"Not at all, dear lady. I am only too charmed,\" said Reginald. \"Won't\nyou come in?\"\n\n\"It's such a heavenly morning,\" said Miss Brittle. \"I walked across\nthe Park. The flowers were too marvellous.\"\n\n\"Well, think about them while you sing your exercises,\" said Reginald,\nsitting down at the piano. \"It will give your voice colour and\nwarmth.\"\n\nOh, what an enchanting idea! What a _genius_ Mr. Peacock was. She\nparted her pretty lips, and began to sing like a pansy.\n\n\"Very good, very good, indeed,\" said Reginald, playing chords that\nwould waft a hardened criminal to heaven. \"Make the notes round. Don't\nbe afraid. Linger over them, breathe them like a perfume.\"\n\nHow pretty she looked, standing there in her white frock, her little\nblonde head tilted, showing her milky throat.\n\n\"Do you ever practise before a glass?\" asked Reginald. \"You ought to,\nyou know; it makes the lips more flexible. Come over here.\"\n\nThey went over to the mirror and stood side by side.\n\n\"Now sing--moo-e-koo-e-oo-e-a!\"\n\nBut she broke down, and blushed more brightly than ever.\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"I can't. It makes me feel so silly. It makes me want\nto laugh. I do look so absurd!\"\n\n\"No, you don't. Don't be afraid,\" said Reginald, but laughed, too,\nvery kindly. \"Now, try again!\"\n\nThe lesson simply flew, and Betty Brittle quite got over her shyness.\n\n\"When can I come again?\" she asked, tying the music up again in the\nblue silk case. \"I want to take as many lessons as I can just now. Oh,\nMr. Peacock, I _do_ enjoy them so much. May I come the day after\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"Dear lady, I shall be only too charmed,\" said Reginald, bowing her\nout.\n\nGlorious girl! And when they had stood in front of the mirror, her\nwhite sleeve had just touched his black one. He could feel--yes, he\ncould actually feel a warm glowing spot, and he stroked it. She loved\nher lessons. His wife came in.\n\n\"Reginald, can you let me have some money? I must pay the dairy. And\nwill you be in for dinner to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes, you know I'm singing at Lord Timbuck's at half-past nine. Can\nyou make me some clear soup, with an egg in it?\"\n\n\"Yes. And the money, Reginald. It's eight and sixpence.\"\n\n\"Surely that's very heavy--isn't it?\"\n\n\"No, it's just what it ought to be. And Adrian must have milk.\"\n\nThere she was--off again. Now she was standing up for Adrian against\nhim.\n\n\"I have not the slightest desire to deny my child a proper amount of\nmilk,\" said he. \"Here is ten shillings.\"\n\nThe door-bell rang. He went to the door.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the Countess Wilkowska, \"the stairs. I have not a breath.\"\nAnd she put her hand over her heart as she followed him into the\nmusic-room. She was all in black, with a little black hat with a\nfloating veil--violets in her bosom.\n\n\"Do not make me sing exercises, to-day,\" she cried, throwing out her\nhands in her delightful foreign way. \"No, to-day, I want only to sing\nsongs. . . . And may I take off my violets? They fade so soon.\"\n\n\"They fade so soon--they fade so soon,\" played Reginald on the piano.\n\n\"May I put them here?\" asked the Countess, dropping them in a little\nvase that stood in front of one of Reginald's photographs.\n\n\"Dear lady, I should be only too charmed!\"\n\nShe began to sing, and all was well until she came to the phrase: \"You\nlove me. Yes, I _know_ you love me!\" Down dropped his hands from the\nkeyboard, he wheeled round, facing her.\n\n\"No, no; that's not good enough. You can do better than that,\" cried\nReginald ardently. \"You must sing as if you were in love. Listen; let\nme try and show you.\" And he sang.\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes. I see what you mean,\" stammered the little Countess.\n\"May I try it again?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Do not be afraid. Let yourself go. Confess yourself. Make\nproud surrender!\" he called above the music. And she sang.\n\n\"Yes; better that time. But I still feel you are capable of more. Try\nit with me. There must be a kind of exultant defiance as well--don't\nyou feel?\" And they sang together. Ah! now she was sure she\nunderstood. \"May I try once again?\"\n\n\"You love me. Yes, I _know_ you love me.\"\n\nThe lesson was over before that phrase was quite perfect. The little\nforeign hands trembled as they put the music together.\n\n\"And you are forgetting your violets,\" said Reginald softly.\n\n\"Yes, I think I will forget them,\" said the Countess, biting her\nunderlip. What fascinating ways these foreign women have!\n\n\"And you will come to my house on Sunday and make music?\" she asked.\n\n\"Dear lady, I shall be only too charmed!\" said Reginald.\n\n  Weep ye no more, sad fountains\n  Why need ye flow so fast?\n\nsang Miss Marian Morrow, but her eyes filled with tears and her chin\ntrembled.\n\n\"Don't sing just now,\" said Reginald. \"Let me play it for you.\" He\nplayed so softly.\n\n\"Is there anything the matter?\" asked Reginald. \"You're not quite\nhappy this morning.\"\n\nNo, she wasn't; she was awfully miserable.\n\n\"You don't care to tell me what it is?\"\n\nIt really was nothing particular. She had those moods sometimes when\nlife seemed almost unbearable.\n\n\"Ah, I know,\" he said; \"if I could only help!\"\n\n\"But you do; you do! Oh, if it were not for my lessons I don't feel I\ncould go on.\"\n\n\"Sit down in the arm-chair and smell the violets and let me sing to\nyou. It will do you just as much good as a lesson.\"\n\nWhy weren't all men like Mr. Peacock?\n\n\"I wrote a poem after the concert last night--just about what I felt.\nOf course, it wasn't _personal._ May I send it to you?\"\n\n\"Dear lady, I should be only too charmed!\"\n\nBy the end of the afternoon he was quite tired and lay down on a sofa\nto rest his voice before dressing. The door of his room was open. He\ncould hear Adrian and his wife talking in the dining-room.\n\n\"Do you know what that teapot reminds me of, Mummy? It reminds me of a\nlittle sitting-down kitten.\"\n\n\"Does it, Mr. Absurdity?\"\n\nReginald dozed. The telephone bell woke him.\n\n\"\u00c3\u0086none Fell is speaking. Mr. Peacock, I have just heard that you are\nsinging at Lord Timbuck's to-night. Will you dine with me, and we can\ngo on together afterwards?\" And the words of his reply dropped like\nflowers down the telephone.\n\n\"Dear lady, I should be only too charmed.\"\n\nWhat a triumphant evening! The little dinner _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with \u00c3\u0086none\nFell, the drive to Lord Timbuck's in her white motor-car, when she\nthanked him again for the unforgettable joy. Triumph upon triumph! And\nLord Timbuck's champagne simply flowed.\n\n\"Have some more champagne, Peacock,\" said Lord Timbuck. Peacock, you\nnotice--not Mr. Peacock--but Peacock, as if he were one of them. And\nwasn't he? He was an artist. He could sway them all. And wasn't he\nteaching them all to escape from life? How he sang! And as he sang, as\nin a dream he saw their feathers and their flowers and their fans,\noffered to him, laid before him, like a huge bouquet.\n\n\"Have another glass of wine, Peacock.\"\n\n\"I could have any one I liked by lifting a finger,\" thought Peacock,\npositively staggering home.\n\nBut as he let himself into the dark flat his marvellous sense of\nelation began to ebb away. He turned up the light in the bedroom. His\nwife lay asleep, squeezed over to her side of the bed. He remembered\nsuddenly how she had said when he had told her he was going out to\ndinner: \"You might have let me know before!\" And how he had answered:\n\"Can't you possibly speak to me without offending against even good\nmanners?\" It was incredible, he thought, that she cared so little for\nhim--incredible that she wasn't interested in the slightest in his\ntriumphs and his artistic career. When so many women in her place\nwould have given their eyes. . . . Yes, he knew it. . . . Why not\nacknowledge it? . . . And there she lay, an enemy, even in her sleep.\n. . . Must it ever be thus? he thought, the champagne still working.\nAh, if we only were friends, how much I could tell her now! About this\nevening; even about Timbuck's manner to me, and all that they said to\nme and so on and so on. If only I felt that she was here to come back\nto--that I could confide in her--and so on and so on.\n\nIn his emotion he pulled off his evening boot and simply hurled it in\nthe corner. The noise woke his wife with a terrible start. She sat up,\npushing back her hair. And he suddenly decided to have one more try to\ntreat her as a friend, to tell her everything, to win her. Down he sat\non the side of the bed, and seized one of her hands. But of all those\nsplendid things he had to say, not one could he utter. For some\nfiendish reason, the only words he could get out were: \"Dear lady, I\nshould be so charmed--so charmed!\"\n\n\n\n\nSUN AND MOON\n\nIN the afternoon the chairs came, a whole big cart full of little gold\nones with their legs in the air. And then the flowers came. When you\nstared down from the balcony at the people carrying them the flower\npots looked like funny awfully nice hats nodding up the path.\n\nMoon thought they were hats. She said: \"Look. There's a man wearing a\npalm on his head.\" But she never knew the difference between real\nthings and not real ones.\n\nThere was nobody to look after Sun and Moon. Nurse was helping Annie\nalter Mother's dress which was much-too-long-and-tight-under-the-arms\nand Mother was running all over the house and telephoning Father to be\nsure not to forget things. She only had time to say: \"Out of my way,\nchildren!\"\n\nThey kept out of her way--at any rate Sun did. He did so hate being\nsent stumping back to the nursery. It didn't matter about Moon. If she\ngot tangled in people's legs they only threw her up and shook her till\nshe squeaked. But Sun was too heavy for that. He was so heavy that the\nfat man who came to dinner on Sundays used to say: \"Now, young man,\nlet's try to lift you.\" And then he'd put his thumbs under Sun's arms\nand groan and try and give it up at last saying: \"He's a perfect\nlittle ton of bricks!\"\n\nNearly all the furniture was taken out of the dining-room. The big\npiano was put in a corner and then there came a row of flower pots and\nthen there came the goldy chairs. That was for the concert. When Sun\nlooked in a white faced man sat at the piano--not playing, but banging\nat it and then looking inside. He had a bag of tools on the piano and\nhe had stuck his hat on a statue against the wall. Sometimes he just\nstarted to play and then he jumped up again and looked inside. Sun\nhoped he wasn't the concert.\n\nBut of course the place to be in was the kitchen. There was a man\nhelping in a cap like a blancmange, and their real cook, Minnie, was\nall red in the face and laughing. Not cross at all. She gave them each\nan almond finger and lifted them up on to the flour bin so that they\ncould watch the wonderful things she and the man were making for\nsupper. Cook brought in the things and he put them on dishes and\ntrimmed them. Whole fishes, with their heads and eyes and tails still\non, he sprinkled with red and green and yellow bits; he made squiggles\nall over the jellies, he stuck a collar on a ham and put a very thin\nsort of a fork in it; he dotted almonds and tiny round biscuits on the\ncreams. And more and more things coming.\n\n\"Ah, but you haven't seen the ice pudding,\" said Cook. \"Come along.\"\nWhy was she being so nice, thought Sun as she gave them each a hand.\nAnd they looked into the refrigerator.\n\nOh! Oh! Oh! It was a little house. It was a little pink house with\nwhite snow on the roof and green windows and a brown door and stuck in\nthe door there was a nut for a handle.\n\nWhen Sun saw the nut he felt quite tired and had to lean against Cook.\n\n\"Let me touch it. Just let me put my finger on the roof,\" said Moon,\ndancing. She always wanted to touch all the food. Sun didn't.\n\n\"Now, my girl, look sharp with the table,\" said Cook as the housemaid\ncame in.\n\n\"It's a picture, Min,\" said Nellie. \"Come along and have a look.\" So\nthey all went into the dining-room. Sun and Moon were almost\nfrightened. They wouldn't go up to the table at first; they just stood\nat the door and made eyes at it.\n\nIt wasn't real night yet but the blinds were down in the dining-room\nand the lights turned on--and all the lights were red roses. Red\nribbons and bunches of roses tied up the table at the corners. In the\nmiddle was a lake with rose petals floating on it.\n\n\"That's where the ice pudding is to be,\" said Cook.\n\nTwo silver lions with wings had fruit on their backs, and the salt\ncellars were tiny birds drinking out of basins.\n\nAnd all the winking glasses and shining plates and sparkling knives\nand forks--and all the food. And the little red table napkins made\ninto roses. . . .\n\n\"Are people going to eat the food?\" asked Sun.\n\n\"I should just think they were,\" laughed Cook, laughing with Nellie.\nMoon laughed, too; she always did the same as other people. But Sun\ndidn't want to laugh. Round and round he walked with his hands behind\nhis back. Perhaps he never would have stopped if Nurse hadn't called\nsuddenly: \"Now then, children. It's high time you were washed and\ndressed.\" And they were marched off to the nursery.\n\nWhile they were being unbuttoned Mother looked in with a white thing\nover her shoulders; she was rubbing stuff on her face.\n\n\"I'll ring for them when I want them, Nurse, and then they can just\ncome down and be seen and go back again,\" said she.\n\nSun was undressed, first nearly to his skin, and dressed again in a\nwhite shirt with red and white daisies speckled on it, breeches with\nstrings at the sides and braces that came over, white socks and red\nshoes.\n\n\"Now you're in your Russian costume,\" said Nurse, flattening down his\nfringe.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Sun.\n\n\"Yes. Sit quiet in that chair and watch your little sister.\"\n\nMoon took ages. When she had her socks put on she pretended to fall\nback on the bed and waved her legs at Nurse as she always did, and\nevery time Nurse tried to make her curls with a finger and a wet brush\nshe turned round and asked Nurse to show her the photo of her brooch\nor something like that. But at last she was finished too. Her dress\nstuck out, with fur on it, all white; there was even fluffy stuff on\nthe legs of her drawers. Her shoes were white with big blobs on them.\n\n\"There you are, my lamb,\" said Nurse. \"And you look like a sweet\nlittle cherub of a picture of a powder-puff?\" Nurse rushed to the\ndoor. \"Ma'am, one moment.\"\n\nMother came in again with half her hair down.\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried. \"What a picture!\"\n\n\"Isn't she,\" said Nurse.\n\nAnd Moon held out her skirts by the tips and dragged one of her feet.\nSun didn't mind people not noticing him--much. . . .\n\nAfter that they played clean tidy games up at the table while Nurse\nstood at the door, and when the carriages began to come and the sound\nof laughter and voices and soft rustlings came from down below she\nwhispered: \"Now then, children, stay where you are.\" Moon kept jerking\nthe table cloth so that it all hung down her side and Sun hadn't\nany--and then she pretended she didn't do it on purpose.\n\nAt last the bell rang. Nurse pounced at them with the hair brush,\nflattened his fringe, made her bow stand on end and joined their hands\ntogether.\n\n\"Down you go!\" she whispered.\n\nAnd down they went. Sun did feel silly holding Moon's hand like that\nbut Moon seemed to like it. She swung her arm and the bell on her\ncoral bracelet jingled.\n\nAt the drawing-room door stood Mother fanning herself with a black\nfan. The drawing-room was full of sweet smelling, silky, rustling\nladies and men in black with funny tails on their coats--like beetles.\nFather was among them, talking very loud, and rattling something in\nhis pocket.\n\n\"What a picture!\" cried the ladies. \"Oh, the ducks! Oh, the lambs! Oh,\nthe sweets! Oh, the pets!\"\n\nAll the people who couldn't get at Moon kissed Sun, and a skinny old\nlady with teeth that clicked said: \"Such a serious little poppet,\" and\nrapped him on the head with something hard.\n\nSun looked to see if the same concert was there, but he was gone.\nInstead, a fat man with a pink head leaned over the piano talking to a\ngirl who held a violin at her ear.\n\nThere was only one man that Sun really liked. He was a little grey\nman, with long grey whiskers, who walked about by himself. He came up\nto Sun and rolled his eyes in a very nice way and said: \"Hullo, my\nlad.\" Then he went away. But soon he came back again and said: \"Fond\nof dogs?\" Sun said: \"Yes.\" But then he went away again, and though Sun\nlooked for him everywhere he couldn't find him. He thought perhaps\nhe'd gone outside to fetch in a puppy.\n\n\"Good night, my precious babies,\" said Mother, folding them up in her\nbare arms. \"Fly up to your little nest.\"\n\nThen Moon went and made a silly of herself again. She put up her arms\nin front of everybody and said: \"My Daddy must carry me.\"\n\nBut they seemed to like it, and Daddy swooped down and picked her up\nas he always did.\n\nNurse was in such a hurry to get them to bed that she even interrupted\nSun over his prayers and said: \"Get on with them, child, _do._\" And\nthe moment after they were in bed and in the dark except for the\nnightlight in its little saucer.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" asked Moon.\n\n\"No,\" said Sun. \"Are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Moon.\n\nA long while after Sun woke up again. There was a loud, loud noise of\nclapping from downstairs, like when it rains. He heard Moon turn over.\n\n\"Moon, are you awake?\"\n\n\"Yes, are you.\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, let's go and look over the stairs.\"\n\nThey had just got settled on the top step when the drawing-room door\nopened and they heard the party cross over the hall into the\ndining-room. Then that door was shut; there was a noise of \"pops\" and\nlaughing. Then that stopped and Sun saw them all walking round and\nround the lovely table with their hands behind their backs like he had\ndone. . . . Round and round they walked, looking and staring. The man\nwith the grey whiskers liked the little house best. When he saw the\nnut for a handle he rolled his eyes like he did before and said to\nSun: \"Seen the nut?\"\n\n\"Don't nod your head like that, Moon.\"\n\n\"I'm not nodding. It's you.\"\n\n\"It is not. I never nod my head.\"\n\n\"O-oh, you do. You're nodding it now.\"\n\n\"I'm not. I'm only showing you how not to do it.\"\n\nWhen they woke up again they could only hear Father's voice very loud,\nand Mother, laughing away. Father came out of the dining-room, bounded\nup the stairs, and nearly fell over them.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he said. \"By Jove, Kitty, come and look at this.\"\n\nMother came out. \"Oh, you naughty children,\" said she from the hall.\n\n\"Let's have 'em down and give 'em a bone,\" said Father. Sun had never\nseen him so jolly.\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" said Mother.\n\n\"Oh, my Daddy, do! Do have us down,\" said Moon.\n\n\"I'm hanged if I won't,\" cried Father. \"I won't be bullied. Kitty--way\nthere.\" And he caught them up, one under each arm.\n\nSun thought Mother would have been dreadfully cross. But she wasn't.\nShe kept on laughing at Father.\n\n\"Oh, you dreadful boy!\" said she. But she didn't mean Sun.\n\n\"Come on, kiddies. Come and have some pickings,\" said this jolly\nFather. But Moon stopped a minute.\n\n\"Mother--your dress is right off one side.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" said Mother. And Father said \"Yes\" and pretended to bite her\nwhite shoulder, but she pushed him away.\n\nAnd so they went back to the beautiful dining-room.\n\nBut--oh! oh! what had happened. The ribbons and the roses were all\npulled untied. The little red table napkins lay on the floor, all the\nshining plates were dirty and all the winking glasses. The lovely food\nthat the man had trimmed was all thrown about, and there were bones\nand bits and fruit peels and shells everywhere. There was even a\nbottle lying down with stuff coming out of it on to the cloth and\nnobody stood it up again.\n\nAnd the little pink house with the snow roof and the green windows was\nbroken--broken--half melted away in the centre of the table.\n\n\"Come on, Sun,\" said Father, pretending not to notice.\n\nMoon lifted up her pyjama legs and shuffled up to the table and stood\non a chair, squeaking away.\n\n\"Have a bit of this ice,\" said Father, smashing in some more of the\nroof.\n\nMother took a little plate and held it for him; she put her other arm\nround his neck.\n\n\"Daddy. Daddy,\" shrieked Moon. \"The little handle's left. The little\nnut. Kin I eat it?\" And she reached across and picked it out of the\ndoor and scrunched it up, biting hard and blinking.\n\n\"Here, my lad,\" said Father.\n\nBut Sun did not move from the door. Suddenly he put up his head and\ngave a loud wail.\n\n\"I think it's horrid--horrid--horrid!\" he sobbed.\n\n\"There, you see!\" said Mother. \"You see!\"\n\n\"Off with you,\" said Father, no longer jolly. \"This moment. Off you\ngo!\"\n\nAnd wailing loudly, Sun stumped off to the nursery.\n\n\n\n\nFEUILLE D'ALBUM\n\nHE really was an impossible person. Too shy altogether. With\nabsolutely nothing to say for himself. And such a weight. Once he was\nin your studio he never knew when to go, but would sit on and on until\nyou nearly screamed, and burned to throw something enormous after him\nwhen he did finally blush his way out--something like the tortoise\nstove. The strange thing was that at first sight he looked most\ninteresting. Everybody agreed about that. You would drift into the\ncaf\u00c3\u00a9 one evening and there you would see, sitting in a corner, with a\nglass of coffee in front of him, a thin, dark boy, wearing a blue\njersey with a little grey flannel jacket buttoned over it. And somehow\nthat blue jersey and the grey jacket with the sleeves that were too\nshort gave him the air of a boy that has made up his mind to run away\nto sea. Who has run away, in fact, and will get up in a moment and\nsling a knotted handkerchief containing his nightshirt and his\nmother's picture on the end of a stick, and walk out into the night\nand be drowned. . . . Stumble over the wharf edge on his way to the\nship, even. . . . He had black close-cropped hair, grey eyes with long\nlashes, white cheeks and a mouth pouting as though he were determined\nnot to cry. . . . How could one resist him? Oh, one's heart was wrung\nat sight. And, as if that were not enough, there was his trick of\nblushing. . . . Whenever the waiter came near him he turned\ncrimson--he might have been just out of prison and the waiter in the\nknow. . . .\n\n\"Who is he, my dear? Do you know?\"\n\n\"Yes. His name is Ian French. Painter. Awfully clever, they say.\nSomeone started by giving him a mother's tender care. She asked him\nhow often he heard from home, whether he had enough blankets on his\nbed, how much milk he drank a day. But when she went round to his\nstudio to give an eye to his socks, she rang and rang, and though she\ncould have sworn she heard someone breathing inside, the door was not\nanswered. . . . Hopeless!\"\n\nSomeone else decided that he ought to fall in love. She summoned him\nto her side, called him \"boy,\" leaned over him so that he might smell\nthe enchanting perfume of her hair, took his arm, told him how\nmarvellous life could be if one only had the courage, and went round\nto his studio one evening and rang and rang. . . . Hopeless.\n\n\"What the poor boy really wants is thoroughly rousing,\" said a third.\nSo off they went to caf\u00c3\u00a9s and cabarets, little dances, places where\nyou drank something that tasted like tinned apricot juice, but cost\ntwenty-seven shillings a bottle and was called champagne, other\nplaces, too thrilling for words, where you sat in the most awful\ngloom, and where some one had always been shot the night before. But\nhe did not turn a hair. Only once he got very drunk, but instead of\nblossoming forth, there he sat, stony, with two spots of red on his\ncheeks, like, my dear, yes, the dead image of that ragtime thing they\nwere playing, like a \"Broken Doll.\" But when she took him back to his\nstudio he had quite recovered, and said \"good night\" to her in the\nstreet below, as though they had walked home from church together.\n. . . Hopeless.\n\nAfter heaven knows how many more attempts--for the spirit of kindness\ndies very hard in women--they gave him up. Of course, they were still\nperfectly charming, and asked him to their shows, and spoke to him in\nthe caf\u00c3\u00a9, but that was all. When one is an artist one has no time\nsimply for people who won't respond. Has one?\n\n\"And besides I really think there must be something rather fishy\nsomewhere . . . don't you? It can't all be as innocent as it looks!\nWhy come to Paris if you want to be a daisy in the field? No, I'm not\nsuspicious. But----\"\n\nHe lived at the top of a tall mournful building overlooking the river.\nOne of those buildings that look so romantic on rainy nights and\nmoonlight nights, when the shutters are shut, and the heavy door, and\nthe sign advertising \"a little apartment to let immediately\" gleams\nforlorn beyond words. One of those buildings that smell so unromantic\nall the year round, and where the concierge lives in a glass cage on\nthe ground floor, wrapped up in a filthy shawl, stirring something in\na saucepan and ladling out tit-bits to the swollen old dog lolling on\na bead cushion. . . . Perched up in the air the studio had a wonderful\nview. The two big windows faced the water; he could see the boats and\nthe barges swinging up and down, and the fringe of an island planted\nwith trees, like a round bouquet. The side window looked across to\nanother house, shabbier still and smaller, and down below there was a\nflower market. You could see the tops of huge umbrellas, with frills\nof bright flowers escaping from them, booths covered with striped\nawning where they sold plants in boxes and clumps of wet gleaming\npalms in terra-cotta jars. Among the flowers the old women scuttled\nfrom side to side, like crabs. Really there was no need for him to go\nout. If he sat at the window until his white beard fell over the sill\nhe still would have found something to draw. . . .\n\nHow surprised those tender women would have been if they had managed\nto force the door. For he kept his studio as neat as a pin. Everything\nwas arranged to form a pattern, a little \"still life\" as it were--the\nsaucepans with their lids on the wall behind the gas stove, the bowl\nof eggs, milk jug and teapot on the shelf, the books and the lamp with\nthe crinkly paper shade on the table. An Indian curtain that had a\nfringe of red leopards marching round it covered his bed by day, and\non the wall beside the bed on a level with your eyes when you were\nlying down there was a small neatly printed notice: GET UP AT ONCE.\n\nEvery day was much the same. While the light was good he slaved at his\npainting, then cooked his meals and tidied up the place. And in the\nevenings he went off to the caf\u00c3\u00a9, or sat at home reading or making out\nthe most complicated list of expenses headed: \"What I ought to be able\nto do it on,\" and ending with a sworn statement . . . \"I swear not to\nexceed this amount for next month. Signed, Ian French.\"\n\nNothing very fishy about this; but those far-seeing women were quite\nright. It wasn't all.\n\nOne evening he was sitting at the side window eating some prunes and\nthrowing the stones on to the tops of the huge umbrellas in the\ndeserted flower market. It had been raining--the first real spring\nrain of the year had fallen--a bright spangle hung on everything, and\nthe air smelled of buds and moist earth. Many voices sounding languid\nand content rang out in the dusky air, and the people who had come to\nclose their windows and fasten the shutters leaned out instead. Down\nbelow in the market the trees were peppered with new green. What kind\nof trees were they? he wondered. And now came the lamplighter. He\nstared at the house across the way, the small, shabby house, and\nsuddenly, as if in answer to his gaze, two wings of windows opened and\na girl came out on to the tiny balcony carrying a pot of daffodils.\nShe was a strangely thin girl in a dark pinafore, with a pink\nhandkerchief tied over her hair. Her sleeves were rolled up almost to\nher shoulders and her slender arms shone against the dark stuff.\n\n\"Yes, it is quite warm enough. It will do them good,\" she said,\nputting down the pot and turning to some one in the room inside. As\nshe turned she put her hands up to the handkerchief and tucked away\nsome wisps of hair. She looked down at the deserted market and up at\nthe sky, but where he sat there might have been a hollow in the air.\nShe simply did not see the house opposite. And then she disappeared.\n\nHis heart fell out of the side window of his studio, and down to the\nbalcony of the house opposite--buried itself in the pot of daffodils\nunder the half-opened buds and spears of green. . . . That room with\nthe balcony was the sitting-room, and the one next door to it was the\nkitchen. He heard the clatter of the dishes as she washed up after\nsupper, and then she came to the window, knocked a little mop against\nthe ledge, and hung it on a nail to dry. She never sang or unbraided\nher hair, or held out her arms to the moon as young girls are supposed\nto do. And she always wore the same dark pinafore and the pink\nhandkerchief over her hair. . . . Whom did she live with? Nobody else\ncame to those two windows, and yet she was always talking to some one\nin the room. Her mother, he decided, was an invalid. They took in\nsewing. The father was dead. . . . He had been a journalist--very\npale, with long moustaches, and a piece of black hair falling over his\nforehead.\n\nBy working all day they just made enough money to live on, but they\nnever went out and they had no friends. Now when he sat down at his\ntable he had to make an entirely new set of sworn statements. . . .\nNot to go to the side window before a certain hour: signed, Ian\nFrench. Not to think about her until he had put away his painting\nthings for the day: signed, Ian French.\n\nIt was quite simple. She was the only person he really wanted to know,\nbecause she was, he decided, the only other person alive who was just\nhis age. He couldn't stand giggling girls, and he had no use for\ngrown-up women. . . . She was his age, she was--well, just like him.\nHe sat in his dusky studio, tired, with one arm hanging over the back\nof his chair, staring in at her window and seeing himself in there\nwith her. She had a violent temper; they quarrelled terribly at times,\nhe and she. She had a way of stamping her foot and twisting her hands\nin her pinafore . . . furious. And she very rarely laughed. Only when\nshe told him about an absurd little kitten she once had who used to\nroar and pretend to be a lion when it was given meat to eat. Things\nlike that made her laugh. . . . But as a rule they sat together very\nquietly; he, just as he was sitting now, and she with her hands folded\nin her lap and her feet tucked under, talking in low tones, or silent\nand tired after the day's work. Of course, she never asked him about\nhis pictures, and of course he made the most wonderful drawings of her\nwhich she hated, because he made her so thin and so dark. . . . But\nhow could he get to know her? This might go on for years. . . .\n\nThen he discovered that once a week, in the evenings, she went out\nshopping. On two successive Thursdays she came to the window wearing\nan old-fashioned cape over the pinafore, and carrying a basket. From\nwhere he sat he could not see the door of her house, but on the next\nThursday evening at the same time he snatched up his cap and ran down\nthe stairs. There was a lovely pink light over everything. He saw it\nglowing in the river, and the people walking towards him had pink\nfaces and pink hands.\n\nHe leaned against the side of his house waiting for her and he had no\nidea of what he was going to do or say. \"Here she comes,\" said a voice\nin his head. She walked very quickly, with small, light steps; with\none hand she carried the basket, with the other she kept the cape\ntogether. . . . What could he do? He could only follow. . . . First\nshe went into the grocer's and spent a long time in there, and then\nshe went into the butcher's where she had to wait her turn. Then she\nwas an age at the draper's matching something, and then she went to\nthe fruit shop and bought a lemon. As he watched her he knew more\nsurely than ever he must get to know her, now. Her composure, her\nseriousness and her loneliness, the very way she walked as though she\nwas eager to be done with this world of grown-ups all was so natural\nto him and so inevitable.\n\n\"Yes, she is always like that,\" he thought proudly. \"We have nothing\nto do with these people.\"\n\nBut now she was on her way home and he was as far off as ever. . . .\nShe suddenly turned into the dairy and he saw her through the window\nbuying an egg. She picked it out of the basket with such care--a brown\none, a beautifully shaped one, the one he would have chosen. And when\nshe came out of the dairy he went in after her. In a moment he was out\nagain, and following her past his house across the flower market,\ndodging among the huge umbrellas and treading on the fallen flowers\nand the round marks where the pots had stood. . . . Through her door\nhe crept, and up the stairs after, taking care to tread in time with\nher so that she should not notice. Finally, she stopped on the\nlanding, and took the key out of her purse. As she put it into the\ndoor he ran up and faced her.\n\nBlushing more crimson than ever, but looking at her severely he said,\nalmost angrily: \"Excuse me, Mademoiselle, you dropped this.\"\n\nAnd he handed her an egg.\n\n\n\n\nA DILL PICKLE\n\nAND then, after six years, she saw him again. He was seated at one of\nthose little bamboo tables decorated with a Japanese vase of paper\ndaffodils. There was a tall plate of fruit in front of him, and very\ncarefully, in a way she recognized immediately as his \"special\" way,\nhe was peeling an orange.\n\nHe must have felt that shock of recognition in her for he looked up\nand met her eyes. Incredible! He didn't know her! She smiled; he\nfrowned. She came towards him. He closed his eyes an instant, but\nopening them his face lit up as though he had struck a match in a dark\nroom. He laid down the orange and pushed back his chair, and she took\nher little warm hand out of her muff and gave it to him.\n\n\"Vera!\" he exclaimed. \"How strange. Really, for a moment I didn't know\nyou. Won't you sit down? You've had lunch? Won't you have some\ncoffee?\"\n\nShe hesitated, but of course she meant to.\n\n\"Yes, I'd like some coffee.\" And she sat down opposite him.\n\n\"You've changed. You've changed very much,\" he said, staring at her\nwith that eager, lighted look. \"You look so well. I've never seen you\nlook so well before.\"\n\n\"Really?\" She raised her veil and unbuttoned her high fur collar. \"I\ndon't feel very well. I can't bear this weather, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, no. You hate the cold. . . .\"\n\n\"Loathe it.\" She shuddered. \"And the worst of it is that the older one\ngrows . . .\"\n\nHe interrupted her. \"Excuse me,\" and tapped on the table for the\nwaitress. \"Please bring some coffee and cream.\" To her: \"You are sure\nyou won't eat anything? Some fruit, perhaps. The fruit here is very\ngood.\"\n\n\"No, thanks. Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then that's settled.\" And smiling just a hint too broadly he took up\nthe orange again. \"You were saying--the older one grows----\"\n\n\"The colder,\" she laughed. But she was thinking how well she\nremembered that trick of his--the trick of interrupting her--and of\nhow it used to exasperate her six years ago. She used to feel then as\nthough he, quite suddenly, in the middle of what she was saying, put\nhis hand over her lips, turned from her, attended to something\ndifferent, and then took his hand away, and with just the same\nslightly too broad smile, gave her his attention again. . . . Now we\nare ready. That is settled.\n\n\"The colder!\" He echoed her words, laughing too. \"Ah, ah. You still\nsay the same things. And there is another thing about you that is not\nchanged at all--your beautiful voice--your beautiful way of speaking.\"\nNow he was very grave; he leaned towards her, and she smelled the\nwarm, stinging scent of the orange peel. \"You have only to say one\nword and I would know your voice among all other voices. I don't know\nwhat it is--I've often wondered--that makes your voice such\na--haunting memory.  Do you remember that first afternoon we spent\ntogether at Kew Gardens? You were so surprised because I did not know\nthe names of any flowers. I am still just as ignorant for all your\ntelling me. But whenever it is very fine and warm, and I see some\nbright colours--it's awfully strange--I hear your voice saying:\n'Geranium, marigold and verbena.' And I feel those three words are all\nI recall of some forgotten, heavenly language. . . . You remember that\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, very well.\" She drew a long, soft breath, as though the\npaper daffodils between them were almost too sweet to bear. Yet, what\nhad remained in her mind of that particular afternoon was an absurd\nscene over the tea table. A great many people taking tea in a Chinese\npagoda, and he behaving like a maniac about the wasps--waving them\naway, flapping at them with his straw hat, serious and infuriated out\nof all proportion to the occasion. How delighted the sniggering tea\ndrinkers had been. And how she had suffered.\n\nBut now, as he spoke, that memory faded. His was the truer. Yes, it\nhad been a wonderful afternoon, full of geranium and marigold and\nverbena, and--warm sunshine. Her thoughts lingered over the last two\nwords as though she sang them.\n\nIn the warmth, as it were, another memory unfolded. She saw herself\nsitting on a lawn. He lay beside her, and suddenly, after a long\nsilence, he rolled over and put his head in her lap.\n\n\"I wish,\" he said, in a low, troubled voice, \"I wish that I had taken\npoison and were about to die--here now!\"\n\nAt that moment a little girl in a white dress, holding a long,\ndripping water lily, dodged from behind a bush, stared at them, and\ndodged back again. But he did not see. She leaned over him.\n\n\"Ah, why do you say that? I could not say that.\"\n\nBut he gave a kind of soft moan, and taking her hand he held it to his\ncheek.\n\n\"Because I know I am going to love you too much--far too much. And I\nshall suffer so terribly. Vera, because you never, never will love\nme.\"\n\nHe was certainly far better looking now than he had been then. He had\nlost all that dreamy vagueness and indecision. Now he had the air of a\nman who has found his place in life, and fills it with a confidence\nand an assurance which was, to say the least, impressive. He must have\nmade money, too. His clothes were admirable, and at that moment he\npulled a Russian cigarette case out of his pocket.\n\n\"Won't you smoke?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will.\" She hovered over them. \"They look very good.\"\n\n\"I think they are. I get them made for me by a little man in St.\nJames's Street. I don't smoke very much. I'm not like you--but when I\ndo, they must be delicious, very fresh cigarettes. Smoking isn't a\nhabit with me; it's a luxury--like perfume. Are you still so fond of\nperfumes? Ah, when I was in Russia . . .\"\n\nShe broke in: \"You've really been to Russia?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I was there for over a year. Have you forgotten how we used\nto talk of going there?\"\n\n\"No, I've not forgotten.\"\n\nHe gave a strange half laugh and leaned back in his chair. \"Isn't it\ncurious. I have really carried out all those journeys that we planned.\nYes, I have been to all those places that we talked of, and stayed in\nthem long enough to--as you used to say, 'air oneself' in them. In\nfact, I have spent the last three years of my life travelling all the\ntime. Spain, Corsica, Siberia, Russia, Egypt. The only country left is\nChina, and I mean to go there, too, when the war is over.\"\n\nAs he spoke, so lightly, tapping the end of his cigarette against the\nash-tray, she felt the strange beast that had slumbered so long within\nher bosom stir, stretch itself, yawn, prick up its ears, and suddenly\nbound to its feet, and fix its longing, hungry stare upon those far\naway places. But all she said was, smiling gently: \"How I envy you.\"\n\nHe accepted that. \"It has been,\" he said, \"very wonderful--especially\nRussia. Russia was all that we had imagined, and far, far more. I even\nspent some days on a river boat on the Volga. Do you remember that\nboatman's song that you used to play?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" It began to play in her mind as she spoke.\n\n\"Do you ever play it now?\"\n\n\"No, I've no piano.\"\n\nHe was amazed at that. \"But what has become of your beautiful piano?\"\n\nShe made a little grimace. \"Sold. Ages ago.\"\n\n\"But you were so fond of music,\" he wondered.\n\n\"I've no time for it now,\" said she.\n\nHe let it go at that. \"That river life,\" he went on, \"is something\nquite special. After a day or two you cannot realize that you have\never known another. And it is not necessary to know the language--the\nlife of the boat creates a bond between you and the people that's more\nthan sufficient. You eat with them, pass the day with them, and in the\nevening there is that endless singing.\"\n\nShe shivered, hearing the boatman's song break out again loud and\ntragic, and seeing the boat floating on the darkening river with\nmelancholy trees on either side. . . . \"Yes, I should like that,\" said\nshe, stroking her muff.\n\n\"You'd like almost everything about Russian life,\" he said warmly.\n\"It's so informal, so impulsive, so free without question. And then\nthe peasants are so splendid. They are such human beings--yes, that is\nit. Even the man who drives your carriage has--has some real part in\nwhat is happening. I remember the evening a party of us, two friends\nof mine and the wife of one of them, went for a picnic by the Black\nSea. We took supper and champagne and ate and drank on the grass. And\nwhile we were eating the coachman came up. 'Have a dill pickle,' he\nsaid. He wanted to share with us. That seemed to me so right, so--you\nknow what I mean?\"\n\nAnd she seemed at that moment to be sitting on the grass beside the\nmysteriously Black Sea, black as velvet, and rippling against the\nbanks in silent, velvet waves. She saw the carriage drawn up to one\nside of the road, and the little group on the grass, their faces and\nhands white in the moonlight. She saw the pale dress of the woman\noutspread and her folded parasol, lying on the grass like a huge pearl\ncrochet hook. Apart from them, with his supper in a cloth on his\nknees, sat the coachman. \"Have a dill pickle,\" said he, and although\nshe was not certain what a dill pickle was, she saw the greenish glass\njar with a red chili like a parrot's beak glimmering through. She\nsucked in her cheeks; the dill pickle was terribly sour. . . .\n\n\"Yes, I know perfectly what you mean,\" she said.\n\nIn the pause that followed they looked at each other. In the past when\nthey had looked at each other like that they had felt such a boundless\nunderstanding between them that their souls had, as it were, put their\narms round each other and dropped into the same sea, content to be\ndrowned, like mournful lovers. But now, the surprising thing was that\nit was he who held back. He who said:\n\n\"What a marvellous listener you are. When you look at me with those\nwild eyes I feel that I could tell you things that I would never\nbreathe to another human being.\"\n\nWas there just a hint of mockery in his voice or was it her fancy? She\ncould not be sure.\n\n\"Before I met you,\" he said, \"I had never spoken of myself to anybody.\nHow well I remember one night, the night that I brought you the little\nChristmas tree, telling you all about my childhood. And of how I was\nso miserable that I ran away and lived under a cart in our yard for\ntwo days without being discovered. And you listened, and your eyes\nshone, and I felt that you had even made the little Christmas tree\nlisten too, as in a fairy story.\"\n\nBut of that evening she had remembered a little pot of caviare. It had\ncost seven and sixpence. He could not get over it. Think of it--a tiny\njar like that costing seven and sixpence. While she ate it he watched\nher, delighted and shocked.\n\n\"No, really, that is eating money. You could not get seven shillings\ninto a little pot that size. Only think of the profit they must make.\n. . .\" And he had begun some immensely complicated calculations. . . .\nBut now good-bye to the caviare. The Christmas tree was on the table,\nand the little boy lay under the cart with his head pillowed on the\nyard dog.\n\n\"The dog was called Bosun,\" she cried delightedly.\n\nBut he did not follow. \"Which dog? Had you a dog? I don't remember a\ndog at all.\"\n\n\"No, no. I mean the yard dog when you were a little boy.\" He laughed\nand snapped the cigarette case to.\n\n\"Was he? Do you know I had forgotten that. It seems such ages ago. I\ncannot believe that it is only six years. After I had recognized you\nto-day--I had to take such a leap--I had to take a leap over my whole\nlife to get back to that time. I was such a kid then.\" He drummed on\nthe table. \"I've often thought how I must have bored you. And now I\nunderstand so perfectly why you wrote to me as you did--although at\nthe time that letter nearly finished my life. I found it again the\nother day, and I couldn't help laughing as I read it. It was so\nclever--such a true picture of me.\" He glanced up. \"You're not going?\"\n\nShe had buttoned her collar again and drawn down her veil.\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid I must,\" she said, and managed a smile. Now she knew\nthat he had been mocking.\n\n\"Ah, no, please,\" he pleaded. \"Don't go just for a moment,\" and he\ncaught up one of her gloves from the table and clutched at it as if\nthat would hold her. \"I see so few people to talk to nowadays, that I\nhave turned into a sort of barbarian,\" he said. \"Have I said something\nto hurt you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" she lied. But as she watched him draw her glove through\nhis fingers, gently, gently, her anger really did die down, and\nbesides, at the moment he looked more like himself of six years ago.\n. . .\n\n\"What I really wanted then,\" he said softly, \"was to be a sort of\ncarpet--to make myself into a sort of carpet for you to walk on so\nthat you need not be hurt by the sharp stones and the mud that you\nhated so. It was nothing more positive than that--nothing more\nselfish. Only I did desire, eventually, to turn into a magic carpet\nand carry you away to all those lands you longed to see.\"\n\nAs he spoke she lifted her head as though she drank something; the\nstrange beast in her bosom began to purr. . . .\n\n\"I felt that you were more lonely than anybody else in the world,\" he\nwent on, \"and yet, perhaps, that you were the only person in the world\nwho was really, truly alive. Born out of your time,\" he murmured,\nstroking the glove, \"fated.\"\n\nAh, God! What had she done! How had she dared to throw away her\nhappiness like this. This was the only man who had ever understood\nher. Was it too late? Could it be too late? _She_ was that glove that\nhe held in his fingers. . . .\n\n\"And then the fact that you had no friends and never had made friends\nwith people. How I understood that, for neither had I. Is it just the\nsame now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she breathed. \"Just the same. I am as alone as ever.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" he laughed gently, \"just the same.\"\n\nSuddenly with a quick gesture he handed her back the glove and scraped\nhis chair on the floor, \"But what seemed to me so mysterious then is\nperfectly plain to me now. And to you, too, of course. . . . It simply\nwas that we were such egoists, so self-engrossed, so wrapped up in\nourselves that we hadn't a corner in our hearts for anybody else. Do\nyou know,\" he cried, naive and hearty, and dreadfully like another\nside of that old self again, \"I began studying a Mind System when I\nwas in Russia, and I found that we were not peculiar at all. It's\nquite a well known form of . . .\"\n\nShe had gone. He sat there, thunder-struck, astounded beyond words.\n. . . And then he asked the waitress for his bill.\n\n\"But the cream has not been touched,\" he said. \"Please do not charge\nme for it.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LITTLE GOVERNESS\n\nOH, dear, how she wished that it wasn't night-time. She'd have much\nrather travelled by day, much much rather. But the lady at the\nGoverness Bureau had said: \"You had better take an evening boat and\nthen if you get into a compartment for 'Ladies Only' in the train you\nwill be far safer than sleeping in a foreign hotel. Don't go out of\nthe carriage; don't walk about the corridors and _be sure_ to lock the\nlavatory door if you go there. The train arrives at Munich at eight\no'clock, and Frau Arnholdt says that the Hotel Grunewald is only one\nminute away. A porter can take you there. She will arrive at six the\nsame evening, so you will have a nice quiet day to rest after the\njourney and rub up your German. And when you want anything to eat I\nwould advise you to pop into the nearest baker's and get a bun and\nsome coffee. You haven't been abroad before, have you?\" \"No.\" \"Well, I\nalways tell my girls that it's better to mistrust people at first\nrather than trust them, and it's safer to suspect people of evil\nintentions rather than good ones. . . . It sounds rather hard but\nwe've got to be women of the world, haven't we?\"\n\nIt had been nice in the Ladies' Cabin. The stewardess was so kind and\nchanged her money for her and tucked up her feet. She lay on one of\nthe hard pink-sprigged couches and watched the other passengers,\nfriendly and natural, pinning their hats to the bolsters, taking off\ntheir boots and skirts, opening dressing-cases and arranging\nmysterious rustling little packages, tying their heads up in veils\nbefore lying down. _Thud_, _thud_, _thud_, went the steady screw of\nthe steamer. The stewardess pulled a green shade over the light and\nsat down by the stove, her skirt turned back over her knees, a long\npiece of knitting on her lap. On a shelf above her head there was a\nwater-bottle with a tight bunch of flowers stuck in it. \"I like\ntravelling very much,\" thought the little governess. She smiled and\nyielded to the warm rocking.\n\nBut when the boat stopped and she went up on deck, her dress-basket in\none hand, her rug and umbrella in the other, a cold, strange wind flew\nunder her hat. She looked up at the masts and spars of the ship black\nagainst a green glittering sky and down to the dark landing stage\nwhere strange muffled figures lounged, waiting; she moved forward with\nthe sleepy flock, all knowing where to go to and what to do except\nher, and she felt afraid. Just a little--just enough to wish--oh, to\nwish that it was daytime and that one of those women who had smiled at\nher in the glass, when they both did their hair in the Ladies' Cabin,\nwas somewhere near now. \"Tickets, please. Show your tickets. Have your\ntickets ready.\" She went down the gangway balancing herself carefully\non her heels. Then a man in a black leather cap came forward and\ntouched her on the arm. \"Where for, Miss?\" He spoke English--he must\nbe a guard or a stationmaster with a cap like that. She had scarcely\nanswered when he pounced on her dress-basket. \"This way,\" he shouted,\nin a rude, determined voice, and elbowing his way he strode past the\npeople. \"But I don't want a porter.\" What a horrible man! \"I don't\nwant a porter. I want to carry it myself.\" She had to run to keep up\nwith him, and her anger, far stronger than she, ran before her and\nsnatched the bag out of the wretch's hand. He paid no attention at\nall, but swung on down the long dark platform, and across a railway\nline. \"He is a robber.\" She was sure he was a robber as she stepped\nbetween the silvery rails and felt the cinders crunch under her shoes.\nOn the other side--oh, thank goodness!--there was a train with Munich\nwritten on it. The man stopped by the huge lighted carriages. \"Second\nclass?\" asked the insolent voice. \"Yes, a Ladies' compartment.\" She\nwas quite out of breath. She opened her little purse to find something\nsmall enough to give this horrible man while he tossed her dress-basket\ninto the rack of an empty carriage that had a ticket, _Dames\nSeules_, gummed on window. She got into the train and handed twenty\ncentimes. \"What's this?\" shouted the man, glaring at the money and\nthen at her, holding it up to his nose, sniffing at it as though he\nhad never in his life seen, much less held, such a sum. \"It's a franc.\nYou know that, don't you? It's a franc. That's my fare!\" A franc! Did\nhe imagine that she was going to give him a franc for playing a trick\nlike that just because she was a girl and travelling alone at night?\nNever, never! She squeezed her purse in her hand and simply did not\nsee him--she looked at a view of St. Malo on the wall opposite and\nsimply did not hear him. \"Ah, no. Ah, no. Four sous. You make a\nmistake. Here, take it. It's a franc I want.\" He leapt on to the step\nof the train and threw the money on to her lap. Trembling with terror\nshe screwed herself tight, tight, and put out an icy hand and took the\nmoney--stowed it away in her hand. \"That's all you're going to get,\"\nshe said. For a minute or two she felt his sharp eyes pricking her all\nover, while he nodded slowly, pulling down his mouth: \"Ve-ry well.\n_Trrr\u00c3\u00a8s bien._\" He shrugged his shoulders and disappeared into the\ndark. Oh, the relief! How simply terrible that had been! As she stood\nup to feel if the dress-basket was firm she caught sight of herself in\nthe mirror, quite white, with big round eyes. She untied her \"motor\nveil\" and unbuttoned her green cape. \"But it's all over now,\" she said\nto the mirror face, feeling in some way that it was more frightened\nthan she.\n\nPeople began to assemble on the platform. They stood together in\nlittle groups talking; a strange light from the station lamps painted\ntheir faces almost green. A little boy in red clattered up with a huge\ntea wagon and leaned against it, whistling and flicking his boots with\na serviette. A woman in a black alpaca apron pushed a barrow with\npillows for hire. Dreamy and vacant she looked--like a woman wheeling\na perambulator--up and down, up and down--with a sleeping baby inside\nit. Wreaths of white smoke floated up from somewhere and hung below\nthe roof like misty vines. \"How strange it all is,\" thought the little\ngoverness, \"and the middle of the night, too.\" She looked out from her\nsafe corner, frightened no longer but proud that she had not given\nthat franc. \"I can look after myself--of course I can. The great thing\nis not to----\" Suddenly from the corridor there came a stamping of\nfeet and men's voices, high and broken with snatches of loud laughter.\nThey were coming her way. The little governess shrank into her corner\nas four young men in bowler hats passed, staring through the door and\nwindow. One of them, bursting with the joke, pointed to the notice\n_Dames Seules_ and the four bent down the better to see the one little\ngirl in the corner. Oh dear, they were in the carriage next door. She\nheard them tramping about and then a sudden hush followed by a tall\nthin fellow with a tiny black moustache who flung her door open. \"If\nmademoiselle cares to come in with us,\" he said, in French. She saw\nthe others crowding behind him, peeping under his arm and over his\nshoulder, and she sat very straight and still. \"If mademoiselle will\ndo us the honour,\" mocked the tall man. One of them could be quiet no\nlonger; his laughter went off in a loud crack. \"Mademoiselle is\nserious,\" persisted the young man, bowing and grimacing. He took off\nhis hat with a flourish, and she was alone again.\n\n\"_En voiture. En voi-ture!_\" Some one ran up and down beside the\ntrain. \"I wish it wasn't night-time. I wish there was another woman in\nthe carriage. I'm frightened of the men next door.\" The little\ngoverness looked out to see her porter coming back again--the same man\nmaking for her carriage with his arms full of luggage. But--but what\n_was_ he doing? He put his thumb nail under the label _Dames Seules_\nand tore it right off and then stood aside squinting at her while an\nold man wrapped in a plaid cape climbed up the high step. \"But this is\na ladies' compartment.\" \"Oh, no, Mademoiselle, you make a mistake. No,\nno, I assure you. Merci, Monsieur.\" \"_En voi-turre!_\" A shrill\nwhistle. The porter stepped off triumphant and the train started. For\na moment or two big tears brimmed her eyes and through them she saw\nthe old man unwinding a scarf from his neck and untying the flaps of\nhis Jaeger cap. He looked very old. Ninety at least. He had a white\nmoustache and big gold-rimmed spectacles with little blue eyes behind\nthem and pink wrinkled cheeks. A nice face--and charming the way he\nbent forward and said in halting French: \"Do I disturb you,\nMademoiselle? Would you rather I took all these things out of the rack\nand found another carriage?\" What! that old man have to move all those\nheavy things just because she . . . \"No, it's quite all right. You\ndon't disturb me at all.\" \"Ah, a thousand thanks.\" He sat down\nopposite her and unbuttoned the cape of his enormous coat and flung it\noff his shoulders.\n\nThe train seemed glad to have left the station. With a long leap it\nsprang into the dark. She rubbed a place in the window with her glove\nbut she could see nothing--just a tree outspread like a black fan or a\nscatter of lights, or the line of a hill, solemn and huge. In the\ncarriage next door the young men started singing \"_Un, deux, trois._\"\nThey sang the same song over and over at the tops of their voices.\n\n\"I never could have dared to go to sleep if I had been alone,\" she\ndecided. \"_I couldn't_ have put my feet up or even taken off my hat.\"\nThe singing gave her a queer little tremble in her stomach and,\nhugging herself to stop it, with her arms crossed under her cape, she\nfelt really glad to have the old man in the carriage with her. Careful\nto see that he was not looking she peeped at him through her long\nlashes. He sat extremely upright, the chest thrown out, the chin well\nin, knees pressed together, reading a German paper. That was why he\nspoke French so funnily. He was a German. Something in the army, she\nsupposed--a Colonel or a General--once, of course, not now; he was too\nold for that now. How spick and span he looked for an old man. He wore\na pearl pin stuck in his black tie and a ring with a dark red stone on\nhis little finger; the tip of a white silk handkerchief showed in the\npocket of his double-breasted jacket. Somehow, altogether, he was\nreally nice to look at. Most old men were so horrid. She couldn't bear\nthem doddery--or they had a disgusting cough or something. But not\nhaving a beard--that made all the difference--and then his cheeks were\nso pink and his moustache so very white. Down went the German paper\nand the old man leaned forward with the same delightful courtesy: \"Do\nyou speak German, Mademoiselle?\" \"_Ja, ein wenig, mehr als\nFranzosisch_,\" said the little governess, blushing a deep pink colour\nthat spread slowly over her cheeks and made her blue eyes look almost\nblack. \"Ach, so!\" The old man bowed graciously. \"Then perhaps you\nwould care to look at some illustrated papers.\" He slipped a rubber\nband from a little roll of them and handed them across. \"Thank you\nvery much.\" She was very fond of looking at pictures, but first she\nwould take off her hat and gloves. So she stood up, unpinned the brown\nstraw and put it neatly in the rack beside the dress-basket, stripped\noff her brown kid gloves, paired them in a tight roll and put them in\nthe crown of the hat for safety, and then sat down again, more\ncomfortably this time, her feet crossed, the papers on her lap. How\nkindly the old man in the corner watched her bare little hand turning\nover the big white pages, watched her lips moving as she pronounced\nthe long words to herself, rested upon her hair that fairly blazed\nunder the light. Alas! how tragic for a little governess to possess\nhair that made one think of tangerines and marigolds, of apricots and\ntortoiseshell cats and champagne! Perhaps that was what the old man\nwas thinking as he gazed and gazed, and that not even the dark ugly\nclothes could disguise her soft beauty. Perhaps the flush that licked\nhis cheeks and lips was a flush of rage that anyone so young and\ntender should have to travel alone and unprotected through the night.\nWho knows he was not murmuring in his sentimental German fashion:\n\"_Ja, es ist eine Tragoedie!_ Would to God I were the child's\ngrandpapa!\"\n\n\"Thank you very much. They were very interesting.\" She smiled prettily\nhanding back the papers. \"But you speak German extremely well,\" said\nthe old man. \"You have been in Germany before, of course?\" \"Oh no,\nthis is the first time\"--a little pause, then--\"this is the first time\nthat I have ever been abroad at all.\" \"Really! I am surprised. You\ngave me the impression, if I may say so, that you were accustomed to\ntravelling.\" \"Oh, well--I have been about a good deal in England, and\nto Scotland, once.\" \"So. I myself have been in England once, but I\ncould not learn English.\" He raised one hand and shook his head,\nlaughing. \"No, it was too difficult for me. . . . 'Ow-do-you-do.\nPlease vich is ze vay to Leicestaire Squaare.'\" She laughed too.\n\"Foreigners always say . . .\" They had quite a little talk about it.\n\"But you will like Munich,\" said the old man. \"Munich is a wonderful\ncity. Museums, pictures, galleries, fine buildings and shops,\nconcerts, theatres, restaurants--all are in Munich. I have travelled\nall over Europe many, many times in my life, but it is always to\nMunich that I return. You will enjoy yourself there.\" \"I am not going\nto _stay_ in Munich,\" said the little governess, and she added shyly,\n\"I am going to a post as governess to a doctor's family in Augsburg.\"\n\"Ah, that was it.\" Augsburg he knew. Augsburg--well--was not\nbeautiful. A solid manufacturing town. But if Germany was new to her\nhe hoped she would find something interesting there too. \"I am sure I\nshall.\" \"But what a pity not to see Munich before you go. You ought to\ntake a little holiday on your way\"--he smiled--\"and store up some\npleasant memories.\" \"I am afraid I could not do _that_,\" said the\nlittle governess, shaking her head, suddenly important and serious.\n\"And also, if one is alone . . .\" He quite understood. He bowed,\nserious too. They were silent after that. The train shattered on,\nbaring its dark, flaming breast to the hills and to the valleys. It\nwas warm in the carriage. She seemed to lean against the dark rushing\nand to be carried away and away. Little sounds made themselves heard;\nsteps in the corridor, doors opening and shutting--a murmur of\nvoices--whistling. . . . Then the window was pricked with long needles\nof rain. . . . But it did not matter . . . it was outside . . . and\nshe had her umbrella . . . she pouted, sighed, opened and shut her\nhands once and fell fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\"Pardon! Pardon!\" The sliding back of the carriage door woke her with\na start. What had happened? Some one had come in and gone out again.\nThe old man sat in his corner, more upright than ever, his hands in\nthe pockets of his coat, frowning heavily. \"Ha! ha! ha!\" came from the\ncarriage next door. Still half asleep, she put her hands to her hair\nto make sure it wasn't a dream. \"Disgraceful!\" muttered the old man\nmore to himself than to her. \"Common, vulgar fellows! I am afraid they\ndisturbed you, gracious Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein, blundering in here like that.\" No,\nnot really. She was just going to wake up, and she took out silver\nwatch to look at the time. Half-past four. A cold blue light filled\nthe window panes. Now when she rubbed a place she could see bright\npatches of fields, a clump of white houses like mushrooms, a road\n\"like a picture\" with poplar trees on either side, a thread of river.\nHow pretty it was! How pretty and how different! Even those pink\nclouds in the sky looked foreign. It was cold, but she pretended that\nit was far colder and rubbed her hands together and shivered, pulling\nat the collar of her coat because she was so happy.\n\nThe train began to slow down. The engine gave a long shrill whistle.\nThey were coming to a town. Taller houses, pink and yellow, glided by,\nfast asleep behind their green eyelids, and guarded by the poplar\ntrees that quivered in the blue air as if on tiptoe, listening. In one\nhouse a woman opened the shutters, flung a red and white mattress\nacross the window frame and stood staring at the train. A pale woman\nwith black hair and a white woollen shawl over her shoulders. More\nwomen appeared at the doors and at the windows of the sleeping houses.\nThere came a flock of sheep. The shepherd wore a blue blouse and\npointed wooden shoes. Look! look what flowers--and by the railway\nstation too! Standard roses like bridesmaids' bouquets, white\ngeraniums, waxy pink ones that you would _never_ see out of a\ngreenhouse at home. Slower and slower. A man with a watering-can was\nspraying the platform. \"A-a-a-ah!\" Somebody came running and waving\nhis arms. A huge fat woman waddled through the glass doors of the\nstation with a tray of strawberries. Oh, she was thirsty! She was very\nthirsty! \"A-a-a-ah!\" The same somebody ran back again. The train\nstopped.\n\nThe old man pulled his coat round him and got up, smiling at her. He\nmurmured something she didn't quite catch, but she smiled back at him\nas he left the carriage. While he was away the little governess looked\nat herself again in the glass, shook and patted herself with the\nprecise practical care of a girl who is old enough to travel by\nherself and has nobody else to assure her that she is \"quite all right\nbehind.\" Thirsty and thirsty! The air tasted of water. She let down\nthe window and the fat woman with the strawberries passed as if on\npurpose; holding up the tray to her. \"_Nein, danke,_\" said the little\ngoverness, looking at the big berries on their gleaming leaves. \"_Wie\nviel?_\" she asked as the fat woman moved away. \"Two marks fifty,\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein.\" \"Good gracious!\" She came in from the window and sat down\nin the corner, very sobered for a minute. Half a crown!\n\"H-o-o-o-o-o-e-e-e!\" shrieked the train, gathering itself together to\nbe off again. She hoped the old man wouldn't be left behind. Oh, it\nwas daylight--everything was lovely if only she hadn't been so\nthirsty. Where _was_ the old man--oh, here he was--she dimpled at him\nas though he were an old accepted friend as he closed the door and,\nturning, took from under his cape a basket of the strawberries. \"If\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein would honour me by accepting these . . .\" \"What for me?\" But\nshe drew back and raised her hands as though he were about to put a\nwild little kitten on her lap.\n\n\"Certainly, for you,\" said the old man. \"For myself it is twenty years\nsince I was brave enough to eat strawberries.\" \"Oh, thank you very\nmuch. _Danke bestens_,\" she stammered, \"_sie sind so sehr sch\u00c3\u00b6n!_\"\n\"Eat them and see,\" said the old man looking pleased and friendly.\n\"You won't have even one?\" \"No, no, no.\" Timidly and charmingly her\nhand hovered. They were so big and juicy she had to take two bites to\nthem--the juice ran all down her fingers--and it was while she munched\nthe berries that she first thought of the old man as a grandfather.\nWhat a perfect grandfather he would make! Just like one out of a book!\n\nThe sun came out, the pink clouds in the sky, the strawberry clouds\nwere eaten by the blue. \"Are they good?\" asked the old man. \"As good\nas they look?\"\n\nWhen she had eaten them she felt she had known him for years. She told\nhim about Frau Arnholdt and how she had got the place. Did he know the\nHotel Grunewald? Frau Arnholdt would not arrive until the evening. He\nlistened, listened until he knew as much about the affair as she did,\nuntil he said--not looking at her--but smoothing the palms of his\nbrown su\u00c3\u00a8de gloves together: \"I wonder if you would let me show you a\nlittle of Munich to-day. Nothing much--but just perhaps a picture\ngallery and the Englischer Garten. It seems such a pity that you\nshould have to spend the day at the hotel, and also a little\nuncomfortable . . . in a strange place. _Nicht wahr?_ You would be\nback there by the early afternoon or whenever you wish, of course, and\nyou would give an old man a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nIt was not until long after she had said \"Yes\"--because the moment she\nhad said it and he had thanked her he began telling her about his\ntravels in Turkey and attar of roses--that she wondered whether she\nhad done wrong. After all, she really did not know him. But he was so\nold and he had been so very kind--not to mention the strawberries.\n. . . And she couldn't have explained the reason why she said \"No,\"\nand it was her _last_ day in a way, her last day to really enjoy\nherself in. \"Was I wrong? Was I?\" A drop of sunlight fell into her\nhands and lay there, warm and quivering. \"If I might accompany you as\nfar as the hotel,\" he suggested, \"and call for you again at about ten\no'clock.\" He took out his pocket-book and handed her a card. \"Herr\nRegierungsrat. . . .\" He had a title! Well, it was _bound_ to be all\nright! So after that the little governess gave herself up to the\nexcitement of being really abroad, to looking out and reading the\nforeign advertisement signs, to being told about the places they came\nto--having her attention and enjoyment looked after by the charming\nold grandfather--until they reached Munich and the Hauptbahnhof.\n\"Porter! Porter!\" He found her a porter, disposed of his own luggage\nin a few words, guided her through the bewildering crowd out of the\nstation down the clean white steps into the white road to the hotel.\nHe explained who she was to the manager as though all this had been\nbound to happen, and then for one moment her little hand lost itself\nin the big brown su\u00c3\u00a8de ones. \"I will call for you at ten o'clock.\" He\nwas gone.\n\n\"This way, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein,\" said a waiter, who had been dodging behind the\nmanager's back, all eyes and ears for the strange couple. She followed\nhim up two flights of stairs into a dark bedroom. He dashed down her\ndress-basket and pulled up a clattering, dusty blind. Ugh! what an\nugly, cold room--what enormous furniture! Fancy spending the day in\nhere! \"Is this the room Frau Arnholdt ordered?\" asked the little\ngoverness. The waiter had a curious way of staring as if there was\nsomething _funny_ about her. He pursed up his lips about to whistle,\nand then changed his mind. \"_Gewiss_,\" he said. Well, why didn't he\ngo? Why did he stare so? \"_Gehen Sie,_\" said the little governess,\nwith frigid English simplicity. His little eyes, like currants, nearly\npopped out of his doughy cheeks. \"_Gehen Sie sofort,_\" she repeated\nicily. At the door he turned. \"And the gentleman,\" said he, \"shall I\nshow the gentleman upstairs when he comes?\"\n\n\n\nOver the white streets big white clouds fringed with silver--and\nsunshine everywhere. Fat, fat coachmen driving fat cabs; funny women\nwith little round hats cleaning the tramway lines; people laughing and\npushing against one another; trees on both sides of the streets and\neverywhere you looked almost, immense fountains; a noise of laughing\nfrom the footpaths or the middle of the streets or the open windows.\nAnd beside her, more beautifully brushed than ever, with a rolled\numbrella in one hand and yellow gloves instead of brown ones, her\ngrandfather who had asked her to spend the day. She wanted to run, she\nwanted to hang on his arm, she wanted to cry every minute, \"Oh, I am\nso frightfully happy!\" He guided her across the roads, stood still\nwhile she \"looked,\" and his kind eyes beamed on her and he said \"just\nwhatever you wish.\" She ate two white sausages and two little rolls of\nfresh bread at eleven o'clock in the morning and she drank some beer,\nwhich he told her wasn't intoxicating, wasn't at all like English\nbeer, out of a glass like a flower vase. And then they took a cab and\nreally she must have seen thousands and thousands of wonderful\nclassical pictures in about a quarter of an hour! \"I shall have to\nthink them over when I am alone.\" . . . But when they came out of the\npicture gallery it was raining. The grandfather unfurled his umbrella\nand held it over the little governess. They started to walk to the\nrestaurant for lunch. She, very close beside him so that he should\nhave some of the umbrella, too. \"It goes easier,\" he remarked in a\ndetached way, \"if you take my arm, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein. And besides it is the\ncustom in Germany.\" So she took his arm and walked beside him while he\npointed out the famous statues, so interested that he quite forgot to\nput down the umbrella even when the rain was long over.\n\nAfter lunch they went to a caf\u00c3\u00a9 to hear a gipsy band, but she did not\nlike that at all. Ugh! such horrible men where there with heads like\neggs and cuts on their faces, so she turned her chair and cupped her\nburning cheeks in her hands and watched her old friend instead. . . .\nThen they went to the Englischer Garten.\n\n\"I wonder what the time is,\" asked the little governess. \"My watch has\nstopped. I forgot to wind it in the train last night. We've seen such\na lot of things that I feel it must be quite late.\" \"Late!\" He stopped\nin front of her laughing and shaking his head in a way she had begun\nto know. \"Then you have not really enjoyed yourself. Late! Why, we\nhave not had any ice cream yet!\" \"Oh, but I have enjoyed myself,\" she\ncried, distressed, \"more than I can possibly say. It has been\nwonderful! Only Frau Arnholdt is to be at the hotel at six and I ought\nto be there by five.\" \"So you shall. After the ice cream I shall put\nyou into a cab and you can go there comfortably.\" She was happy again.\nThe chocolate ice cream melted--melted in little sips a long way down.\nThe shadows of the trees danced on the table cloths, and she sat with\nher back safely turned to the ornamental clock that pointed to\ntwenty-five minutes to seven. \"Really and truly,\" said the little\ngoverness earnestly, \"this has been the happiest day of my life. I've\nnever even imagined such a day.\" In spite of the ice cream her\ngrateful baby heart glowed with love for the fairy grandfather.\n\nSo they walked out of the garden down a long alley. The day was nearly\nover. \"You see those big buildings opposite,\" said the old man. \"The\nthird storey--that is where I live. I and the old housekeeper who\nlooks after me.\" She was very interested. \"Now just before I find a\ncab for you, will you come and see my little 'home' and let me give\nyou a bottle of the attar of roses I told you about in the train? For\nremembrance?\" She would love to. \"I've never seen a bachelor's flat in\nmy life,\" laughed the little governess.\n\nThe passage was quite dark. \"Ah, I suppose my old woman has gone out\nto buy me a chicken. One moment.\" He opened a door and stood aside for\nher to pass, a little shy but curious, into a strange room. She did\nnot know quite what to say. It wasn't pretty. In a way it was very\nugly--but neat, and, she supposed, comfortable for such an old man.\n\"Well, what do you think of it?\" He knelt down and took from a\ncupboard a round tray with two pink glasses and a tall pink bottle.\n\"Two little bedrooms beyond,\" he said gaily, \"and a kitchen. It's\nenough, eh?\" \"Oh, quite enough.\" \"And if ever you should be in Munich\nand care to spend a day or two--why there is always a little nest--a\nwing of a chicken, and a salad, and an old man delighted to be your\nhost once more and many many times, dear little Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein!\" He took the\nstopper out of the bottle and poured some wine into the two pink\nglasses. His hand shook and the wine spilled over the tray. It was\nvery quiet in the room. She said: \"I think I ought to go now.\" \"But\nyou will have a tiny glass of wine with me--just one before you go?\"\nsaid the old man. \"No, really no. I never drink wine. I--I have\npromised never to touch wine or anything like that.\" And though he\npleaded and though she felt dreadfully rude, especially when he seemed\nto take it to heart so, she was quite determined. \"No, _really_,\nplease.\" \"Well, will you just sit down on the sofa for five minutes\nand let me drink your health?\" The little governess sat down on the\nedge of the red velvet couch and he sat down beside her and drank her\nhealth at a gulp. \"Have you really been happy to-day?\" asked the old\nman, turning round, so close beside her that she felt his knee\ntwitching against hers. Before she could answer he held her hands.\n\"And are you going to give me one little kiss before you go?\" he\nasked, drawing her closer still.\n\nIt was a dream! It wasn't true! It wasn't the same old man at all. Ah,\nhow horrible! The little governess stared at him in terror. \"No, no,\nno!\" she stammered, struggling out of his hands. \"One little kiss. A\nkiss. What is it? Just a kiss, dear little Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein. A kiss.\" He\npushed his face forward, his lips smiling broadly; and how his little\nblue eyes gleamed behind the spectacles! \"Never--never. How can you!\"\nShe sprang up, but he was too quick and he held her against the wall,\npressed against her his hard old body and his twitching knee and,\nthough she shook her head from side to side, distracted, kissed her on\nthe mouth. On the mouth! Where not a soul who wasn't a near relation\nhad ever kissed her before. . . .\n\nShe ran, ran down the street until she found a broad road with tram\nlines and a policeman standing in the middle like a clockwork doll. \"I\nwant to get a tram to the Hauptbahnhof,\" sobbed the little governess.\n\"Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein?\" She wrung her hands at him. \"The Hauptbahnhof. There--there's\none now,\" and while he watched very much surprised, the little\ngirl with her hat on one side, crying without a handkerchief, sprang\non to the tram--not seeing the conductor's eyebrows, nor hearing the\n_hochwohlgebildete Dame_ talking her over with a scandalized friend.\nShe rocked herself and cried out loud and said \"Ah, ah!\" pressing her\nhands to her mouth. \"She has been to the dentist,\" shrilled a fat old\nwoman, too stupid to be uncharitable. \"_Na, sagen Sie 'mal_, what\ntoothache! The child hasn't one left in her mouth.\" While the tram\nswung and jangled through a world full of old men with twitching knees.\n\n\n\nWhen the little governess reached the hall of the Hotel Grunewald the\nsame waiter who had come into her room in the morning was standing by\ntable, polishing a tray of glasses. The sight of the little governess\nseemed to fill him out with some inexplicable important content. He\nwas ready for her question; his answer came pat and suave. \"Yes,\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein, the lady has been here. I told her that you had arrived and\ngone out again immediately with a gentleman. She asked me when you\nwere coming back again--but of course I could not say. And then she\nwent to the manager.\" He took up a glass from the table, held it up to\nthe light, looked at it with one eye closed, and started polishing it\nwith a corner of his apron. \". . . ?\" \"Pardon, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein? Ach, no,\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein. The manager could tell her nothing--nothing.\" He shook his\nhead and smiled at the brilliant glass. \"Where is the lady now?\" asked\nthe little governess, shuddering so violently that she had to hold her\nhandkerchief up to her mouth. \"How should I know?\" cried the waiter,\nand as he swooped past her to pounce upon a new arrival his heart beat\nso hard against his ribs that he nearly chuckled aloud. \"That's it!\nthat's it!\" he thought. \"That will show her.\" And as he swung the new\narrival's box on to his shoulders--hoop!--as though he were a giant\nand the box a feather, he minced over again the little governess's\nwords, \"_Gehen Sie. Gehen Sie sofort._ Shall I! Shall I!\" he shouted\nto himself.\n\n\n\n\nREVELATIONS\n\nFROM eight o'clock in the morning until about half-past eleven Monica\nTyrell suffered from her nerves, and suffered so terribly that these\nhours were--agonizing, simply. It was not as though she could control\nthem. \"Perhaps if I were ten years younger . . .\" she would say. For\nnow that she was thirty-three she had queer little way of referring to\nher age on all occasions, of looking at her friends with grave,\nchildish eyes and saying: \"Yes, I remember how twenty years ago . . .\"\nor of drawing Ralph's attention to the girls--real girls--with lovely\nyouthful arms and throats and swift hesitating movements who sat near\nthem in restaurants. \"Perhaps if I were ten years younger . . .\"\n\n\"Why don't you get Marie to sit outside your door and absolutely\nforbid anybody to come near your room until you ring your bell?\"\n\n\"Oh, if it were as simple as that!\" She threw her little gloves down\nand pressed her eyelids with her fingers in the way he knew so well.\n\"But in the first place I'd be so conscious of Marie sitting there,\nMarie shaking her finger at Rudd and Mrs. Moon, Marie as a kind of\ncross between a wardress and a nurse for mental cases! And then,\nthere's the post. One can't get over the fact that the post comes, and\nonce it has come, who--who--could wait until eleven for the letters?\"\n\nHis eyes grew bright; he quickly, lightly clasped her. \"_My_ letters,\ndarling?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she drawled, softly, and she drew her hand over his reddish\nhair, smiling too, but thinking: \"Heavens! What a stupid thing to\nsay!\"\n\nBut this morning she had been awakened by one great slam of the front\ndoor. Bang. The flat shook. What was it? She jerked up in bed,\nclutching the eiderdown; her heart beat. What could it be? Then she\nheard voices in the passage. Marie knocked, and, as the door opened,\nwith a sharp tearing rip out flew the blind and the curtains,\nstiffening, flapping, jerking. The tassel of the blind knocked--knocked\nagainst the window. \"Eh-h, _voil\u00c3\u00a0!_\" cried Marie, setting down\nthe tray and running. \"_C'est le vent, Madame. C'est un vent\ninsupportable._\"\n\nUp rolled the blind; the window went up with a jerk; a whitey-greyish\nlight filled the room. Monica caught a glimpse of a huge pale sky and\na cloud like a torn shirt dragging across before she hid her eyes with\nher sleeve.\n\n\"Marie! the curtains! Quick, the curtains!\" Monica fell back into the\nbed and then \"Ring-ting-a-ping-ping, ring-ting-a-ping-ping.\" It was\nthe telephone. The limit of her suffering was reached; she grew quite\ncalm. \"Go and see, Marie.\"\n\n\"It is Monsieur. To know if Madame will lunch at Princes' at\none-thirty to-day.\" Yes, it was Monsieur himself. Yes, he had asked\nthat the message be given to Madame immediately. Instead of replying,\nMonica put her cup down and asked Marie in a small wondering voice\nwhat time it was. It was half-past nine. She lay still and half closed\nher eyes. \"Tell Monsieur I cannot come,\" she said gently. But as the\ndoor shut, anger--anger suddenly gripped her close, close, violent,\nhalf strangling her. How dared he? How dared Ralph do such a thing\nwhen he knew how agonizing her nerves were in the morning! Hadn't she\nexplained and described and even--though lightly, of course; she\ncouldn't say such a thing directly--given him to understand that this\nwas the one unforgivable thing.\n\nAnd then to choose this frightful windy morning. Did he think it was\njust a fad of hers, a little feminine folly to be laughed at and\ntossed aside? Why, only last night she had said: \"Ah, but you must\ntake me seriously, too.\" And he had replied: \"My darling, you'll not\nbelieve me, but I know you infinitely better than you know yourself.\nEvery delicate thought and feeling I bow to, I treasure. Yes, laugh! I\nlove the way your lip lifts\"--and he had leaned across the table--\"I\ndon't care who sees that I adore all of you. I'd be with you on\nmountain-top and have all the searchlights of the world play upon us.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" Monica almost clutched her head. Was it possible he had\nreally said that? How incredible men were! And she had loved him--how\ncould she have loved a man who talked like that. What had she been\ndoing ever since that dinner party months ago, when he had seen her\nhome and asked if he might come and \"see again that slow Arabian\nsmile\"? Oh, what nonsense--what utter nonsense--and yet she remembered\nat the time a strange deep thrill unlike anything she had ever felt\nbefore.\n\n\"Coal! Coal! Coal! Old iron! Old iron! Old iron!\" sounded from below.\nIt was all over. Understand her? He had understood nothing. That\nringing her up on a windy morning was immensely significant. Would he\nunderstand that? She could almost have laughed. \"You rang me up when\nthe person who understood me simply couldn't have.\" It was the end.\nAnd when Marie said: \"Monsieur replied he would be in the vestibule in\ncase Madame changed her mind,\" Monica said: \"No, not verbena, Marie.\nCarnations. Two handfuls.\"\n\nA wild white morning, a tearing, rocking wind. Monica sat down before\nthe mirror. She was pale. The maid combed back her dark hair--combed\nit all back--and her face was like a mask, with pointed eyelids and\ndark red lips. As she stared at herself in the blueish shadowy glass\nshe suddenly felt--oh, the strangest, most tremendous excitement\nfilling her slowly, slowly, until she wanted to fling out her arms, to\nlaugh, to scatter everything, to shock Marie, to cry: \"I'm free. I'm\nfree. I'm free as the wind.\" And now all this vibrating, trembling,\nexciting, flying world was hers. It was her kingdom. No, no, she\nbelonged to nobody but Life.\n\n\"That will do, Marie,\" she stammered. \"My hat, my coat, my bag. And\nnow get me a taxi.\" Where was she going? Oh, anywhere. She could not\nstand this silent flat, noiseless Marie, this ghostly, quiet, feminine\ninterior. She must be out; she must be driving quickly--anywhere,\nanywhere.\n\n\"The taxi is there, Madame.\" As she pressed open the big outer doors\nof the flats the wild wind caught her and floated her across the\npavement. Where to? She got in, and smiling radiantly at the cross,\ncold-looking driver, she told him to take her to her hairdresser's.\nWhat would she have done without her hairdresser? Whenever Monica had\nnowhere else to go to or nothing on earth to do she drove there. She\nmight just have her hair waved, and by that time she'd have thought\nout a plan. The cross, cold driver drove at a tremendous pace, and she\nlet herself be hurled from side to side. She wished he would go faster\nand faster. Oh, to be free of Princes' at one-thirty, of being the\ntiny kitten in the swansdown basket, of being the Arabian, and the\ngrave, delighted child and the little wild creature. . . . \"Never\nagain,\" she cried aloud, clenching her small fist. But the cab had\nstopped, and the driver was standing holding the door open for her.\n\nThe hairdresser's shop was warm and glittering. It smelled of soap and\nburnt paper and wallflower brilliantine. There was Madame behind the\ncounter, round, fat, white, her head like a powder-puff rolling on a\nblack satin pin-cushion. Monica always had the feeling that they loved\nher in this shop and understood her--the real her--far better than\nmany of her friends did. She was her real self here, and she and\nMadame had often talked--quite strangely--together. Then there was\nGeorge who did her hair, young, dark, slender George. She was really\nfond of him.\n\nBut to-day--how curious! Madame hardly greeted her. Her face was\nwhiter than ever, but rims of bright red showed round her blue bead\neyes, and even the rings on her pudgy fingers did not flash. They were\ncold, dead, like chips of glass. When she called through the\nwall-telephone to George there was a note in her voice that had never\nbeen there before. But Monica would not believe this. No, she refused\nto. It was just her imagination. She sniffed greedily the warm,\nscented air, and passed behind the velvet curtain into the small\ncubicle.\n\nHer hat and jacket were off and hanging from the peg, and still George\ndid not come. This was the first time he had ever not been there to\nhold the chair for her, to take her hat and hang up her bag, dangling\nit in his fingers as though it were something he'd never seen\nbefore--something fairy. And how quiet the shop was! There was not a\nsound even from Madame. Only the wind blew, shaking the old house; the\nwind hooted, and the portraits of Ladies of the Pompadour Period\nlooked down and smiled, cunning and sly. Monica wished she hadn't\ncome. Oh, what a mistake to have come! Fatal. Fatal. Where was George?\nIf he didn't appear the next moment she would go away. She took off\nthe white kimono. She didn't want to look at herself any more. When\nshe opened a big pot of cream on the glass shelf her fingers trembled.\nThere was a tugging feeling at her heart as though her happiness--her\nmarvellous happiness--were trying to get free.\n\n\"I'll go. I'll not stay.\" She took down her hat. But just at that\nmoment steps sounded, and, looking in the mirror, she saw George\nbowing in the doorway. How queerly he smiled! It was the mirror of\ncourse. She turned round quickly. His lips curled back in a sort of\ngrin, and--wasn't he unshaved?--he looked almost green in the face.\n\n\"Very sorry to have kept you waiting,\" he mumbled, sliding, gliding\nforward.\n\nOh, no, she wasn't going to stay. \"I'm afraid,\" she began. But he had\nlighted the gas and laid the tongs across, and was holding out the\nkimono.\n\n\"It's a wind,\" he said. Monica submitted. She smelled his fresh young\nfingers pinning the jacket under her chin. \"Yes, there is a wind,\"\nsaid she, sinking back into the chair. And silence fell. George took\nout the pins in his expert way. Her hair tumbled back, but he didn't\nhold it as he usually did, as though to feel how fine and soft and\nheavy it was. He didn't say it \"was in a lovely condition.\" He let it\nfall, and, taking a brush out of a drawer, he coughed faintly, cleared\nhis throat and said dully: \"Yes, it's a pretty strong one, I should\nsay it was.\"\n\nShe had no reply to make. The brush fell on her hair. Oh, oh, how\nmournful, how mournful! It fell quick and light, it fell like leaves;\nand then it fell heavy, tugging like the tugging at her heart. \"That's\nenough,\" she cried, shaking herself free.\n\n\"Did I do it too much?\" asked George. He crouched over the tongs. \"I'm\nsorry.\" There came the smell of burnt paper--the smell she loved--and\nhe swung the hot tongs round in his hand, staring before him. \"I\nshouldn't be surprised if it rained.\" He took up a piece of her hair,\nwhen--she couldn't bear it any longer--she stopped him. She looked at\nhim; she saw herself looking at him in the white kimono like a nun.\n\"Is there something the matter here? Has something happened?\" But\nGeorge gave a half shrug and a grimace. \"Oh, no, Madame. Just a little\noccurrence.\" And he took up the piece of hair again. But, oh, she\nwasn't deceived. That was it. Something awful had happened. The\nsilence--really, the silence seemed to come drifting down like flakes\nof snow. She shivered. It was cold in the little cubicle, all cold and\nglittering. The nickel taps and jets and sprays looked somehow almost\nmalignant. The wind rattled the window-frame; a piece of iron banged,\nand the young man went on changing the tongs, crouching over her. Oh,\nhow terrifying Life was, thought Monica. How dreadful. It is the\nloneliness which is so appalling. We whirl along like leaves, and\nnobody knows--nobody cares where we fall, in what black river we float\naway. The tugging feeling seemed to rise into her throat. It ached,\nached; she longed to cry. \"That will do,\" she whispered. \"Give me the\npins.\" As he stood beside her, so submissive, so silent, she nearly\ndropped her arms and sobbed. She couldn't bear any more. Like a wooden\nman the gay young George still slid, glided, handed her her hat and\nveil, took the note, and brought back the change. She stuffed it into\nher bag. Where was she going now?\n\nGeorge took a brush. \"There is a little powder on your coat,\" he\nmurmured. He brushed it away. And then suddenly he raised himself and,\nlooking at Monica, gave a strange wave with the brush and said: \"The\ntruth is, Madame, since you are an old customer--my little daughter\ndied this morning. A first child\"--and then his white face crumpled\nlike paper, and he turned his back on her and began brushing the\ncotton kimono. \"Oh, oh,\" Monica began to cry. She ran out of the shop\ninto the taxi. The driver, looking furious, swung off the seat and\nslammed the door again. \"Where to?\"\n\n\"Princes',\" she sobbed. And all the way there she saw nothing but a\ntiny wax doll with a feather of gold hair, lying meek, its tiny hands\nand feet crossed. And then just before she came to Princes' she saw a\nflower shop full of white flowers. Oh, what a perfect thought.\nLilies-of-the-valley, and white pansies, double white violets and\nwhite velvet ribbon. . . . From an unknown friend. . . . From one who\nunderstands. . . . For a Little Girl. . . . She tapped against the\nwindow, but the driver did not hear; and, anyway, they were at\nPrinces' already.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ESCAPE\n\nIT was his fault, wholly and solely his fault, that they had missed\nthe train. What if the idiotic hotel people had refused to produce the\nbill? Wasn't that simply because he hadn't impressed upon the waiter\nat lunch that they must have it by two o'clock? Any other man would\nhave sat there and refused to move until they handed it over. But no!\nHis exquisite belief in human nature had allowed him to get up and\nexpect one of those idiots to bring it to their room. . . . And then,\nwhen the _voiture_ did arrive, while they were still (Oh, Heavens!)\nwaiting for change, why hadn't he seen to the arrangement of the boxes\nso that they could, at least, have started the moment the money had\ncome? Had he expected her to go outside, to stand under the awning in\nthe heat and point with her parasol? Very amusing picture of English\ndomestic life. Even when the driver had been told how fast he had to\ndrive he had paid no attention whatsoever--just smiled. \"Oh,\" she\ngroaned, \"if she'd been a driver she couldn't have stopped smiling\nherself at the absurd, ridiculous way he was urged to hurry.\" And she\nsat back and imitated his voice: \"_Allez, vite, vite_\"--and begged the\ndriver's pardon for troubling him. . . .\n\nAnd then the station--unforgettable--with the sight of the jaunty\nlittle train shuffling away and those hideous children waving from the\nwindows. \"Oh, why am I made to bear these things? Why am I exposed to\nthem? . . .\" The glare, the flies, while they waited, and he and the\nstationmaster put their heads together over the time-table, trying to\nfind this other train, which, of course, they wouldn't catch. The\npeople who'd gathered round, and the woman who'd held up that baby\nwith that awful, awful head. . . . \"Oh, to care as I care--to feel as\nI feel, and never to be saved anything--never to know for one moment\nwhat it was to . . . to . . .\"\n\nHer voice had changed. It was shaking now--crying now. She fumbled\nwith her bag, and produced from its little maw a scented handkerchief.\nShe put up her veil and, as though she were doing it for somebody\nelse, pitifully, as though she were saying to somebody else: \"I know,\nmy darling,\" she pressed the handkerchief to her eyes.\n\nThe little bag, with its shiny, silvery jaws open, lay on her lap. He\ncould see her powder-puff, her rouge stick, a bundle of letters, a\nphial of tiny black pills like seeds, a broken cigarette, a mirror,\nwhite ivory tablets with lists on them that had been heavily scored\nthrough. He thought: \"In Egypt she would be buried with those things.\"\n\nThey had left the last of the houses, those small straggling houses\nwith bits of broken pot flung among the flower-beds and half-naked\nhens scratching round the doorsteps. Now they were mounting a long\nsteep road that wound round the hill and over into the next bay. The\nhorses stumbled, pulling hard. Every five minutes, every two minutes\nthe driver trailed the whip across them. His stout back was solid as\nwood; there were boils on his reddish neck, and he wore a new, a\nshining new straw hat. . . .\n\nThere was a little wind, just enough wind to blow to satin the new\nleaves on the fruit trees, to stroke the fine grass, to turn to silver\nthe smoky olives--just enough wind to start in front of the carriage a\nwhirling, twirling snatch of dust that settled on their clothes like\nthe finest ash. When she took out her powder-puff the powder came\nflying over them both.\n\n\"Oh, the dust,\" she breathed, \"the disgusting, revolting dust.\" And\nshe put down her veil and lay back as if overcome.\n\n\"Why don't you put up your parasol?\" he suggested. It was on the front\nseat, and he leaned forward to hand it to her. At that she suddenly\nsat upright and blazed again.\n\n\"Please leave my parasol alone! I don't want my parasol! And anyone\nwho was not utterly insensitive would know that I'm far, far too\nexhausted to hold up a parasol. And with a wind like this tugging at\nit. . . . Put it down at once,\" she flashed, and then snatched the\nparasol from him, tossed it into the crumpled hood behind, and\nsubsided, panting.\n\nAnother bend of the road, and down the hill there came a troop of\nlittle children, shrieking and giggling, little girls with\nsun-bleached hair, little boys in faded soldiers' caps. In their hands\nthey carried flowers--any kind of flowers--grabbed by the head, and\nthese they offered, running beside the carriage. Lilac, faded lilac,\ngreeny-white snowballs, one arum lily, a handful of hyacinths. They\nthrust the flowers and their impish faces into the carriage; one even\nthrew into her lap a bunch of marigolds. Poor little mice! He had his\nhand in his trouser pocket before her. \"For Heaven's sake don't give\nthem anything. Oh, how typical of you! Horrid little monkeys! Now\nthey'll follow us all the way. Don't encourage them; you _would_\nencourage beggars\"; and she hurled the bunch out of the carriage with,\n\"Well, do it when I'm not there, please.\"\n\nHe saw the queer shock on the children's faces. They stopped running,\nlagged behind, and then they began to shout something, and went on\nshouting until the carriage had rounded yet another bend.\n\n\"Oh, how many more are there before the top of the hill is reached?\nThe horses haven't trotted once. Surely it isn't necessary for them to\nwalk the whole way.\"\n\n\"We shall be there in a minute now,\" he said, and took out his\ncigarette-case. At that she turned round towards him. She clasped her\nhands and held them against her breast; her dark eyes looked immense,\nimploring, behind her veil; her nostrils quivered, she bit her lip,\nand her head shook with a little nervous spasm. But when she spoke,\nher voice was quite weak and very, very calm.\n\n\"I want to ask you something. I want to beg something of you,\" she\nsaid. \"I've asked you hundreds and hundreds of times before, but\nyou've forgotten. It's such a little thing, but if you knew what it\nmeant to me. . . .\" She pressed her hands together. \"But you can't\nknow. No human creature could know and be so cruel.\" And then, slowly,\ndeliberately, gazing at him with those huge, sombre eyes: \"I beg and\nimplore you for the last time that when we are driving together you\nwon't smoke. If you could imagine,\" she said, \"the anguish I suffer\nwhen that smoke comes floating across my face. . . .\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"I won't. I forgot.\" And he put the case back.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said she, and almost began to laugh, and put the back of her\nhand across her eyes. \"You couldn't have forgotten. Not that.\"\n\nThe wind came, blowing stronger. They were at the top of the hill.\n\"Hoy-yip-yip-yip,\" cried the driver. They swung down the road that\nfell into a small valley, skirted the sea coast at the bottom of it,\nand then coiled over a gentle ridge on the other side. Now there were\nhouses again, blue-shuttered against the heat, with bright burning\ngardens, with geranium carpets flung over the pinkish walls. The\ncoast-line was dark; on the edge of the sea a white silky fringe just\nstirred. The carriage swung down the hill, bumped, shook. \"Yi-ip,\"\nshouted the driver. She clutched the sides of the seat, she closed her\neyes, and he knew she felt this was happening on purpose; this\nswinging and bumping, this was all done--and he was responsible for\nit, somehow--to spite her because she had asked if they couldn't go a\nlittle faster. But just as they reached the bottom of the valley there\nwas one tremendous lurch. The carriage nearly overturned, and he saw\nher eyes blaze at him, and she positively hissed, \"I suppose you are\nenjoying this?\"\n\nThey went on. They reached the bottom of the valley. Suddenly she\nstood up. \"_Cocher! Cocher! Arr\u00c3\u00aatez-vous!_\" She turned round and\nlooked into the crumpled hood behind. \"I knew it,\" she exclaimed. \"I\nknew it. I heard it fall, and so did you, at that last bump.\"\n\n\"What? Where?\"\n\n\"My parasol. It's gone. The parasol that belonged to my mother. The\nparasol that I prize more than--more than . . .\" She was simply beside\nherself. The driver turned round, his gay, broad face smiling.\n\n\"I, too, heard something,\" said he, simply and gaily. \"But I thought\nas Monsieur and Madame said nothing . . .\"\n\n\"There. You hear that. Then you must have heard it too. So _that_\naccounts for the extraordinary smile on your face. . . .\"\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"it can't be gone. If it fell out it will be\nthere still. Stay where you are. I'll fetch it.\"\n\nBut she saw through that. Oh, how she saw through it! \"No, thank you.\"\nAnd she bent her spiteful, smiling eyes upon him, regardless of the\ndriver. \"I'll go myself. I'll walk back and find it, and trust you not\nto follow. For\"--knowing the driver did not understand, she spoke\nsoftly, gently--\"if I don't escape from you for a minute I shall go\nmad.\"\n\nShe stepped out of the carriage. \"My bag.\" He handed it to her.\n\n\"Madame prefers . . .\"\n\nBut the driver had already swung down from his seat, and was seated on\nthe parapet reading a small newspaper. The horses stood with hanging\nheads. It was still. The man in the carriage stretched himself out,\nfolded his arms. He felt the sun beat on his knees. His head was sunk\non his breast. \"Hish, hish,\" sounded from the sea. The wind sighed in\nthe valley and was quiet. He felt himself, lying there, a hollow man,\na parched, withered man, as it were, of ashes. And the sea sounded,\n\"Hish, hish.\"\n\nIt was then that he saw the tree, that he was conscious of its\npresence just inside a garden gate. It was an immense tree with a\nround, thick silver stem and a great arc of copper leaves that gave\nback the light and yet were sombre. There was something beyond the\ntree--a whiteness, a softness, an opaque mass, half-hidden--with\ndelicate pillars. As he looked at the tree he felt his breathing die\naway and he became part of the silence. It seemed to grow, it seemed\nto expand in the quivering heat until the great carved leaves hid the\nsky, and yet it was motionless. Then from within its depths or from\nbeyond there came the sound of a woman's voice. A woman was singing.\nThe warm untroubled voice floated upon the air, and it was all part of\nthe silence as he was part of it. Suddenly, as the voice rose, soft,\ndreaming, gentle, he knew that it would come floating to him from the\nhidden leaves and his peace was shattered. What was happening to him?\nSomething stirred in his breast. Something dark, something unbearable\nand dreadful pushed in his bosom, and like a great weed it floated,\nrocked . . . it was warm, stifling. He tried to struggle to tear at\nit, and at the same moment--all was over. Deep, deep, he sank into the\nsilence, staring at the tree and waiting for the voice that came\nfloating, falling, until he felt himself enfolded.\n\n.       .       .       .       .\n\nIn the shaking corridor of the train. It was night. The train rushed\nand roared through the dark. He held on with both hands to the brass\nrail. The door of their carriage was open.\n\n\"Do not disturb yourself, Monsieur. He will come in and sit down when\nhe wants to. He likes--he likes--it is his habit. . . . _Oui, Madame,\nje suis un peu souffrante. . . .

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1440,"split":"test"}
