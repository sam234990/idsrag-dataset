Mrs. Frisby's son, Timothy, is ill with pneumonia just as the farmer Mr. Fitzgibbon begins preparation for spring plowing in the garden where the Frisby family lives. Normally she would move her family, but Timothy would not survive the cold trip to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby obtains medicine from her friend Mr. Ages, an older white mouse. On the return journey, she saves the life of Jeremy, a young crow, from Dragon, the farmer's cat - the same cat who had killed her husband, Jonathan. Jeremy suggests she seek help in moving Timothy from an owl who dwells in the forest. Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to the owl's tree, but the owl says he can't help until he finds out that she is the widow of Jonathan Frisby. He suggests that Mrs. Frisby seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush near her.\nMrs. Frisby discovers the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped the electricity grid to provide lighting and heating, and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Mrs. Frisby of the rats' capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the subsequent experiments that the humans performed on the rats, which increased the rats' intelligence to the point of being able to read, write, and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. This increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from the NIMH laboratories and migrate to their present location. Jonathan Frisby and Mr. Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight mice who had been part of the experiments at NIMH, and made the rats' escape possible. Out of respect for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Mrs. Frisby's house to a location safe from the plow.\nNicodemus also tells Mrs. Frisby about \"The Plan\", which is to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft, for a new, independent farming colony. One rat, Jenner, disagreed vehemently with The Plan and left the colony with a group of followers at some point prior to Mrs. Frisby's arrival.\nTo move the Frisby home, the rats have to drug Dragon as it is too dangerous to work in the open without any place to hide. However, Mr. Ages has a broken leg and cannot dash to Dragon's bowl to put in the drug. Since the other rats are too big to fit into the hole in the wall to enter the house, Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go. Unfortunately, she is caught by the family's son, Billy, who puts her in a cage. While captured, Mrs. Frisby overhears the Fitzgibbons discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats were electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men (who never identify themselves) who have offered to exterminate the rat colony on Fitzgibbon's land free of charge for him.\nAt night, Justin (one of the rats) comes to save Mrs. Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. Mrs. Frisby warns Justin of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were all from Jenner's group and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically.\nThe successful house move allows the mouse family to remain while Timothy recovers before moving to their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms, and create the illusion that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay behind so the exterminators would not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with poisonous gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.\nOnce Timothy recovers, Mrs. Frisby and her family move to their summer home, and Martin makes plans to visit the rats when they return to their winter home again.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of House Rats and Mice, by David E.

Young females breed when only three or four\nmonths old.\n\nAt this rate a pair of rats, breeding uninterruptedly and without\ndeaths, would at the end of three years (18 generations) be increased to\n359,709,482 individuals.\n\nFor centuries the world has been fighting rats without organization and\nat the same time has been feeding them and building for them fortresses\nfor concealment. If we are to fight them on equal terms we must deny\nthem food and hiding places. We must organize and unite to rid\ncommunities of these pests. The time to begin is now.\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RATS AND MICE.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\n                                                   Page.\n\n    Destructive habits                                 3\n\n    Protection of food and other stores                5\n      Rat-proof building                               5\n      Keeping food from rats and mice                  9\n\n    Destroying rats and mice                          11\n      Traps                                           11\n      Poisons                                         15\n      Domestic animals                                18\n      Fumigation                                      18\n      Rat viruses                                     19\n      Natural enemies                                 20\n\n    Organized efforts to destroy rats                 20\n      Community efforts                               21\n      State and national aid                          21\n\n    Important repressive measures                     23\n\n\n\n\nDESTRUCTIVE HABITS OF HOUSE RATS AND MICE.\n\n\nLosses from depredations of house rats amount to many millions of\ndollars yearly--to more, in fact, than those from all other injurious\nmammals combined. The common house mouse[1] and the brown rat[2] (fig.\n1), too familiar to need description, are pests in nearly all parts of\nthe country; while two other kinds of house rats, known as the black\nrat[3] and the roof rat,[4] are found within our borders.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Brown rat.]\n\nOf these four introduced species--for none is native to America--the\nbrown rat is the most destructive, and, except the mouse, the most\nnumerous and most widely distributed. Brought to America just before\nthe Revolution, it has supplanted and nearly exterminated its less\nrobust relative the black rat; and in spite of the constant warfare of\nman has extended its range and steadily increased in numbers. Its\ndominance is due to its great fecundity and its ability to adapt itself\nto all sorts of surroundings. It breeds (in the middle part of the\nUnited States) six or more times a year and produces from 6 to 20 young\n(average 10) in a litter. Females breed when only 3 or 4 months old.\nThus a pair, breeding uninterruptedly and without deaths, could in three\nyears (18 generations) produce a posterity of 359,709,480 individuals.\nMice and the black and roof rats produce smaller litters, but the period\nof gestation, about 21 days, and the number of litters are the same for\nall.\n\nRats and mice are practically omnivorous, feeding upon all kinds of\nanimal and vegetable matter. The brown rat makes its home in the open\nfield, the hedge row, and the river bank, as well as in stone walls,\npiers, and all kinds of buildings. It destroys grains when newly\nplanted, while growing, and in the shock, stack, mow, crib, granary,\nmill, elevator, or ship's hold, and also in the bin and feed trough. It\ninvades store and warehouse and destroys furs, laces, silks, carpets,\nleather goods, and groceries. It attacks fruits, vegetables, and meats\nin the markets, and destroys by pollution ten times as much as it\nactually eats. It destroys eggs and young poultry, and eats the eggs and\nyoung of song and game birds. It carries disease germs from house to\nhouse and bubonic plague from city to city. It causes disastrous\nconflagrations; floods houses by gnawing lead water pipes; ruins\nartificial ponds and embankments by burrowing; and damages foundations,\nfloors, doors, and furnishings of dwellings.\n\nUnlike the brown rat the black rat rarely migrates to the fields. It has\ndisappeared from most parts of the Northern States, but is occasionally\nfound in remote villages or farms. At our seaports it frequently arrives\non ships from abroad, but seldom becomes very numerous. The roof rat is\ncommon in many parts of the South, where it is a persistent pest in cane\nand rice fields. It maintains itself against the brown rat partly\nbecause of its habit of living in trees. The common house mouse by no\nmeans confines its activities to the inside of buildings, but is often\nfound in open fields, where its depredations in shock and stack are well\nknown.\n\nNot only are mice and rats, especially the brown rat, a cause of\ndestruction and damage to property, but they are also a constant menace\nto the health of man. It has been proved that they are the chief means\nof perpetuating and transmitting bubonic plague and that they play\nimportant r\u00c3\u00b4les in conveying other diseases to human beings. They are\nparasites, without redeeming characteristics, and should everywhere be\nrouted and destroyed.\n\n\n\n\nPROTECTION OF FOOD AND OTHER STORES FROM RATS AND MICE.\n\n\nPast attempts to exterminate rats and mice have failed, not so much\nbecause of lack of effective means as because of the neglect of\nnecessary precautions and the absence of concerted endeavors. We have\nrendered our work abortive by continuing to provide subsistence and\nhiding places for the animals. If these advantages are denied,\npersistent and general use of the usual methods of destruction will\nprove far more successful.\n\n\nRAT-PROOF BUILDING.\n\nFirst in importance, as a measure of rat repression, is the exclusion of\nthe animals from places where they find food and safe retreats for\nrearing their young.\n\nThe best way to keep rats from buildings, whether in city or in country,\nis to use cement in construction. As the advantages of this material are\ncoming to be generally understood, its use is rapidly extending to all\nkinds of buildings. The processes of mixing and laying this material\nrequire little skill or special knowledge, and workmen of ordinary\nintelligence can successfully follow the plain directions contained in\nhandbooks of cement construction.[5]\n\nMany modern public buildings are so constructed that rats can find no\nlodgment in the walls or foundations, and yet in a few years, through\nnegligence, such buildings often become infested with the pests.\nSometimes drain pipes are left uncovered for hours at a time. Often\nouter doors, especially those opening on alleys, are left ajar. A common\nmistake is failure to screen basement windows which must be opened for\nventilation. However the intruders are admitted, when once inside they\nintrench themselves behind furniture or stores, and are difficult to\ndislodge. The addition of inner doors to vestibules is an important\nprecaution against rats. The lower edge of outer doors to public\nbuildings, especially markets, should be reinforced with light metal\nplates to prevent the animals from gnawing through. Any opening left\naround water, steam, or gas pipes, where they go through walls, should\nbe closed carefully with concrete to the full depth of the wall.\n\n=Dwellings.=--In constructing dwelling houses the additional cost of\nmaking the foundations rat-proof is slight compared with the advantages.\nThe cellar walls should have concrete footings, and the walls themselves\nshould be laid in cement mortar. The cellar floor should be of medium\nrather than lean concrete. Even old cellars may be made rat-proof at\ncomparatively small expense. Rat holes may be permanently closed with a\nmixture of cement, sand, and broken glass, or sharp bits of crockery or\nstone.\n\nOn a foundation like the one described above, the walls of a wooden\ndwelling also may be made rat-proof. The space between the sheathing and\nlath, to the height of about a foot, should be filled with concrete.\nRats can not then gain access to the walls, and can enter the dwelling\nonly through doors or windows. Screening all basement and cellar windows\nwith wire netting is a most necessary precaution.\n\n=Old buildings in cities.=--Aside from old dwellings, the chief refuges\nfor rats in cities are sewers, wharves, stables, and outbuildings.\nModern sewers are used by the animals merely as highways and not as\nabodes, but old-fashioned brick sewers often afford nesting crannies.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Rat-proofing a frame dwelling by concrete side\nwall (United States Public Health Service, New Orleans, La., 1914).]\n\nWharves, stables, and outbuildings in cities should be so built as to\nexclude rats. Cement is the chief means to this end. Old tumble-down\nbuildings and wharves should not be tolerated in any city. (See fig. 2.)\n\nIn both city and country, wooden floors of sidewalks, areas, and porches\nare commonly laid upon timbers resting on the ground. Under such floors\nrats have a safe retreat from nearly all enemies. The conditions can be\nremedied in towns by municipal action requiring that these floors be\nreplaced by others made of cement. Areas or walks made of brick are\noften undermined by rats and may become as objectionable as those of\nwood. Wooden floors of porches should always be well above the ground.\n\n=Farm buildings.=--Granaries, corncribs, and poultry houses may be made\nrat-proof by a liberal use of cement in the foundations and floors; or\nthe floors may be of wood resting upon concrete. Objection has been\nurged against concrete floors for horses, cattle, and poultry, because\nthe material is too good a conductor of heat, and the health of the\nanimals suffers from contact with these floors. In poultry houses, dry\nsoil or sand may be used as a covering for the cement floor, and in\nstables a wooden floor resting on concrete is just as satisfactory so\nfar as the exclusion of rats is concerned.\n\nThe common practice of setting corncribs on posts with inverted pans at\nthe top often fails to exclude rats, because the posts are not high\nenough to place the lower cracks of the structure beyond reach of the\nanimals. As rats are excellent jumpers, the posts should be tall enough\nto prevent the animals from obtaining a foothold at any place within 3\nfeet of the ground. A crib built in this way, however, is not very\nsatisfactory.\n\nFor a rat-proof crib a well-drained site should be chosen. The outer\nwalls, laid in cement, should be sunk about 20 inches into the ground.\nThe space within the walls should be grouted thoroughly with cement and\nbroken stone and finished with rich concrete for a floor. Upon this the\nstructure may be built. Even the walls of the crib may be of concrete.\nCorn will not mold in contact with them, provided there is good\nventilation and the roof is water-tight.\n\nHowever, there are cheaper ways of excluding rats from either new or old\ncorncribs. Rats, mice, and sparrows may be kept out effectually by the\nuse of either an inner or an outer covering of galvanized-wire netting\nof half-inch mesh and heavy enough to resist the teeth of the rats. The\nnetting in common use in screening cellar windows is suitable for\ncovering or lining cribs. As rats can climb the netting, the entire\nstructure must be screened, or, if sparrows are not to be excluded, the\nwire netting may be carried up about 3 feet from the ground, and above\nthis a belt of sheet metal about a foot in width may be tacked to the\noutside of the building.\n\nComplete working drawings for the practical rat-proof corncrib shown in\nfigures 3 and 4 may be obtained from the Office of Public Roads and\nRural Engineering of the department.\n\n=Buildings for storing foodstuffs.=--Whenever possible, stores of food\nfor man or beast should be placed only in buildings of rat-proof\nconstruction, guarded against rodents by having all windows near the\nground and all other possible means of entrance screened with netting\nmade of No. 18 or No. 20 wire and of 1\/4-inch mesh. Entrance doors\nshould fit closely, should have the lower edges protected by wide strips\nof metal, and should have springs attached, to insure that they shall\nnot be left open. Before being used for housing stores, the building\nshould be inspected as to the manner in which water, steam, or gas\npipes go through the walls, and any openings found around such pipes\nshould be closed with concrete.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Perspective of rat-proof corncrib, showing\nconcrete foundation by dotted lines; also belt of metal.]\n\nIf rat-proof buildings are not available, it is possible, by the use of\nconcrete in basements and the other precautions just mentioned, to make\nan ordinary building practically safe for food storage.\n\nWhen it is necessary to erect temporary wooden structures to hold\nforage, grain, or food supplies for army camps, the floors of such\nbuildings should not be in contact with the ground, but elevated, the\nsills having a foot or more of clear space below them. Smooth posts\nrising 2 or 3 feet above the ground may be used for foundations, and the\nfloor itself may be protected below by wire netting or sheet metal at\nall places where rats could gain a foothold. Care should be taken to\nhave the floors as tight as possible, for it is chiefly scattered grain\nand fragments of food about a camp that attract rats.\n\n=Rat-proofing by elevation.=--The United States Public Health Service\nreports that in its campaigns against bubonic plague in San Francisco\n(1907) and New Orleans (1914) many plague rats were found under the\nfloors of wooden houses resting on the ground. These buildings were made\nrat-proof by elevation, and no case of either human or rodent plague\noccurred in any house after the change. Placing them on smooth posts 18\ninches above the ground, with the space beneath the floor entirely open,\nleft no hiding place for rats.\n\nThis plan is adapted to small dwellings throughout the South, and to\nsmall summer homes, temporary structures, and small farm buildings\neverywhere. Wherever rats might obtain a foothold on the top of the post\nthey may be prevented from gnawing the adjacent wood by tacking metal\nplates or pieces of wire netting to floor or sill.\n\n\nKEEPING FOOD FROM RATS AND MICE.\n\nThe effect of an abundance of food on the breeding of rodents should be\nkept in mind. Well-fed rats mature quickly, breed often, and have large\nlitters. Poorly fed rats, on the contrary, reproduce less frequently and\nhave smaller litters. In addition, scarcity of food makes measures for\ndestroying the animals far more effective.\n\n=Merchandise in stores.=--In all parts of the country there is a serious\neconomic drain in the destruction by rats and mice of merchandise held\nfor sale by dealers. Not only foodstuffs and forage, but textiles,\nclothing, and leather goods are often ruined. This loss is due mainly to\nthe faulty buildings in which the stores are kept. Often it would be a\nmeasure of economy to tear down the old structures and replace them by\nnew ones. However, even the old buildings may often be repaired so as to\nmake them practically rat-proof; and foodstuffs, as flour, seeds, and\nmeats, may always be protected in wire cages at slight expense. The\npublic should be protected from insanitary stores by a system of rigid\ninspection.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Floor plan of rat-proof corncrib shown in figure\n3.]\n\n=Household supplies.=--Similar care should be exercised in the home to\nprotect household supplies from mice and rats. Little progress in\nridding the premises of these animals can be made so long as they have\naccess to supplies of food. Cellars, kitchens, and pantries often\nfurnish subsistence not only to rats that inhabit the dwelling, but to\nmany that come from outside. Food supplies may always be kept from rats\nand mice if placed in inexpensive rat-proof containers covered with wire\nnetting. Sometimes all that is needed to prevent serious waste is the\napplication of concrete to holes in the basement wall or the slight\nrepair of a defective part of the building.\n\n=Produce in transit.=--Much loss of fruits, vegetables, and other\nproduce occurs in transit by rail and on ships. Most of the damage is\ndone at wharves and in railway stations, but there is also considerable\nin ships' holds, especially to perishable produce brought from warm\nlatitudes. Much of this may be prevented by the use of rat-proof cages\nat the docks, by the careful fumigation of seagoing vessels at the end\nof each voyage, and by the frequent fumigation of vessels in coastwise\ntrade; but still more by replacing old and decrepit wharves and station\nplatforms with modern ones built of concrete.\n\nWhere cargoes are being loaded or unloaded at wharves or depots, food\nliable to attack by rats may be temporarily safeguarded by being placed\nin rat-proof cages, or pounds, constructed of wire netting. Wooden boxes\ncontaining reserve food held in depots for a considerable time or\nintended for shipment by sea may be made rat-proof by light coverings of\nmetal along the angles. This plan has long been in use to protect naval\nstores on ships and in warehouses. It is based on the fact that rats do\nnot gnaw the plane surfaces of hard materials, but attack doors,\nfurniture, and boxes at the angles only.\n\n=Packing houses.=--Packing houses and abattoirs are often sources from\nwhich rats secure subsistence, especially where meats are prepared for\nmarket in old buildings. In old-style cooling rooms with double walls of\nwood and sawdust insulation, always a source of annoyance because of rat\ninfestation, the utmost vigilance is required to prevent serious loss of\nmeat products. On the other hand, packing houses with modern\nconstruction and sanitary devices have no trouble from rats or mice.\n\n=Garbage and waste.=--Since much of the food of rats consists of garbage\nand other waste materials, it is not enough to bar the animals from\nmarkets, granaries, warehouses, and private food stores. Garbage and\noffal of all kinds must be so disposed of that rats can not obtain them.\n\nIn cities and towns an efficient system of garbage collection and\ndisposal should be established by ordinances. Waste from markets,\nhotels, caf\u00c3\u00a9s and households should be collected in covered metal\nreceptacles and frequently emptied. Garbage should never be dumped in or\nnear towns, but should be utilized or promptly destroyed by fire.\n\nRats find abundant food in country slaughterhouses; reform in the\nmanagement of these is badly needed. Such places are centers of rat\npropagation. It is a common practice to leave offal of slaughtered\nanimals to be eaten by rats and swine, and this is the chief means of\nperpetuating trichin\u00c3\u00a6 in pork. The law should require that offal be\npromptly cremated or otherwise disposed of. Country slaughterhouses\nshould be as cleanly and as constantly inspected as abattoirs.\n\nAnother important source of rat food is found in remnants of lunches\nleft by employees in factories, stores, and public buildings. This food,\nwhich alone is sufficient to attract and sustain a small army of rats,\nis commonly left in waste baskets or other open receptacles. Strictly\nenforced rules requiring all remnants of food to be deposited in covered\nmetal vessels would make trapping far more effective.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Guillotine trap made entirely of metal.]\n\nMilitary training camps, unless subjected to rigid discipline in the\nmatter of disposal of garbage and waste, soon become centers of rat\ninfestation. Waste from camps, deposited in covered metal cans and\ncollected daily, should be removed far from the camp itself and either\nburned or utilized in approved modern ways.\n\n\n\n\nDESTROYING RATS AND MICE.\n\n\nThe Biological Survey has made numerous laboratory and field experiments\nwith various agencies for destroying rats and mice. The results form the\nchief basis for the following recommendations:\n\n\nTRAPS.\n\nOwing to their cunning, it is not always easy to clear rats from\npremises by trapping; if food is abundant, it is impossible. A few\nadults refuse to enter the most innocent-looking trap. And yet trapping,\nif persistently followed, is one of the most effective ways of\ndestroying the animals.\n\n=Guillotine trap.=--For general use the improved modern traps with a\nwire fall released by a baited trigger and driven by a coiled spring\nhave marked advantages over the old forms, and many of them may be used\nat the same time. These traps, sometimes called \"guillotine\" traps, are\nof many designs, but the more simply constructed are preferable.\nProbably those made entirely of metal are the best, as they are more\ndurable. Traps with tin or sheet-metal bases are not recommended.\n\nGuillotine traps of the type shown in figure 5 should be baited with\nsmall pieces of Vienna sausage (Wienerwurst) or fried bacon. A small\nsection of an ear of corn is an excellent bait if other grain is not\npresent. The trigger wire should be bent inward to bring the bait into\nproper position for the fall to strike the rat in the neck, as shown in\nfigure 6.\n\nOther excellent baits for rats and mice are oatmeal, toasted cheese,\ntoasted bread (buttered), fish, fish offal, fresh liver, raw meat, pine\nnuts, apples, carrots, and corn, and sunflower, squash, or pumpkin\nseeds. Broken fresh eggs are good bait at all seasons, and ripe\ntomatoes, green cucumbers, and other fresh vegetables are very tempting\nto the animals in winter. When seed, grain, or meal is used with a\nguillotine trap, it is put on the trigger plate, or the trigger wire may\nbe bent outward and the bait placed directly under it.\n\nOatmeal (rolled oats) is recommended as a bait for guillotine traps made\nwith wooden base and trigger plate (fig. 7). These traps are especially\nconvenient to use on ledges or other narrow rat runs or at the openings\nof rat burrows. They are often used without bait.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Method of baiting guillotine trap.]\n\nA common mistake in trapping for rats and mice is to use only one or two\ntraps when dozens are needed. For a large establishment hundreds of\ntraps may be used to advantage, and a dozen is none too many for an\nordinary barn or dwelling infested with rats. House mice are less\nsuspicious than rats and are much more easily trapped. Small guillotine\ntraps baited with oatmeal will soon rid an ordinary dwelling of the\nsmaller pests.\n\n=Cage trap.=--When rats are abundant, the large French wire cage traps\nmay be used to advantage. They should be made of stiff wire, well\nreinforced. Many of those sold in stores are useless, because a\nfull-grown rat can bend the light wires apart and so escape.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Guillotine trap with wooden base and trigger\nplate.]\n\nCage traps may be baited and left open for several nights until the rats\nare accustomed to enter them to obtain food. They should then be closed\nand freshly baited, when a larger catch may be expected, especially of\nyoung rats (fig. 8). As many as 25, and even more, partly grown rats\nhave been taken at a time in one of these traps. It is better to cover\nthe trap than to leave it exposed. A short board should be laid on the\ntrap and an old cloth or bag or a bunch of hay or straw thrown\ncarelessly over the top. Often the trap may be placed with the entrance\nopposite a rat hole and fitting it so closely that rats can not pass\nthrough without entering the trap. If a single rat is caught it may be\nleft in the trap as a decoy to others.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that sometimes a large number of rats may be\ntaken at a time in cage traps, a few good guillotine traps intelligently\nused will prove more effective in the long run.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Cage trap with catch of rats.]\n\n=Figure-4 trigger trap.=--The old-fashioned box trap set with a\nfigure-4 trigger is sometimes useful to secure a wise old rat that\nrefuses to be enticed into a modern trap. Better still is a simple\ndeadfall--a flat stone or a heavy plank--supported by a figure-4\ntrigger. An old rat will go under such a contrivance to feed without\nfear.\n\n=Steel trap.=--The ordinary steel trap (No. 0 or 1) may sometimes be\nsatisfactorily employed to capture a rat. The animal is usually caught\nby the foot, and its squealing has a tendency to frighten other rats.\nThe trap may be set in a shallow pan or box and covered with bran or\noats, care being taken to have the space under the trigger pan free of\ngrain. This may be done by placing a very little cotton under the\ntrigger and setting as lightly as possible. In a narrow run or at the\nmouth of a burrow a steel trap unbaited and covered with very light\ncloth or tissue paper is often effective.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Barrel trap: 1, With stiff paper cover; 2, with\nhinged barrel cover; _a_, stop; _b_, baits.]\n\nThe best bait usually is food of a kind that the rats and mice do not\nget in the vicinity. In a meat market, vegetables or grain should be\nused; in a feed store, meat. As far as possible food other than the bait\nshould be inaccessible while trapping is in progress. The bait should be\nkept fresh and attractive, and the kind changed when necessary. Baits\nand traps should be handled as little as possible.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 10--Pit trap. _aa_, Rat run; _bb_, cover; _cc_,\nposition of weights; _dd_, rods on which covers turn.]\n\n=Barrel trap.=--About 60 years ago a writer in the Cornhill Magazine\ngave details of a trap, by means of which it was claimed that 3,000 rats\nwere caught in a warehouse in a single night. The plan involved tolling\nthe rats to the place and feeding them for several nights on the tops of\nbarrels covered with coarse brown paper. Afterwards a cross was cut in\nthe paper, so that the rats fell into the barrel (fig. 9 (1)). Many\nvariations of the plan, but few improvements upon it, have been\nsuggested by agricultural writers since that time. Reports are\nfrequently made of large catches of rats by means of a barrel fitted\nwith a light cover of wood, hinged on a rod so as to turn with the\nweight of a rat (fig. 9 (2)).\n\n=Pit trap.=--A modification of the barrel trap is the pit trap (fig.\n10). This consists of a stout narrow box sunk in the ground so that the\ntop is level with the rat run. It is fixed with a cover of light wood or\nmetal in two sections, the sections fitting nicely inside the box and\nworking independently. They turn on rods, to which they are fastened.\nThey are weighted near the ends of the box and so adjusted that they\nswing easily. An animal stepping upon the cover beyond the rods is\nprecipitated into the box, while the cover immediately swings back to\nits place. Besides rats, the trap is well adapted to capture larger\nanimals, as minks, raccoons, opossums, and cats. It is especially useful\nto protect poultry yards, game preserves, and the like. The trap should\nbe placed along the fence outside the yard, and behind a shelter of\nboards or brush that leans against the fence.\n\n=Fence and battue.=--In the rice fields of the Far East the natives\nbuild numerous piles of brush and rice straw, and leave them for several\ndays until many rats have taken shelter in them. A portable bamboo\ninclosure several feet in height is then set up around each pile in\nsuccession and the straw and brush are thrown out over the top, while\ndogs and men kill the trapped rodents. Large numbers are destroyed in\nthis way, and the plan with modifications may be utilized in America\nwith satisfactory results. A wire netting of fine mesh may be used for\nthe inclosure. The scheme is applicable at the removal of grain, straw,\nor haystacks, as well as brush piles.\n\nIn a large barn near Washington, a few years ago, piles of unhusked corn\nwere left in the loft and were soon infested with rats. A wooden pen was\nset down surrounding the piles in turn and the corn thrown out until\ndogs were able to get at the rats. In this way several men and dogs\nkilled 500 rats in a single day.\n\n\nPOISONS.\n\nWhile the use of poison is the best and quickest way to get rid of rats\nand mice, the odor from the dead animals makes the method impracticable\nin occupied houses. Poisons may be effectively used in barns, stables,\nsheds, cribs, and other outbuildings.\n\n=Caution.=--In the United States there are few laws which prohibit the\nlaying of poisons on lands owned or controlled by the poisoner. Hence it\nis all the more necessary to exercise extreme caution to prevent\naccidents. In several States notice of intention to lay poison must be\ngiven to persons living in the neighborhood. Poison for rats should\nnever be placed in open or unsheltered places. This applies particularly\nto strychnin or arsenic on meat. _Packages containing poisons should\nalways bear a warning label and should not be kept where children might\nreach them._\n\nAmong the principal poisons that have been recommended for killing rats\nand mice are barium carbonate, strychnin, arsenic, phosphorus, and\nsquills.\n\n=Barium carbonate.=--One of the cheapest and most effective poisons for\nrats and mice is barium carbonate. This mineral has the advantage of\nbeing without taste or smell. It has a corrosive action on the mucous\nlining of the stomach and is dangerous to larger animals if taken in\nsufficient quantity. In the small doses fed to rats and mice it would be\nharmless to domestic animals. Its action upon rats is slow, and if exit\nis possible the animals usually leave the premises in search of water.\nFor this reason the poison may frequently, though not always, be used in\nhouses without disagreeable consequences.\n\nBarium carbonate may be fed in the form of dough composed of four parts\nof meal or flour and one part of the mineral. A more convenient bait is\nordinary oatmeal with about one-eighth of its bulk of the mineral, mixed\nwith water into a stiff dough. A third plan is to spread the barium\ncarbonate upon fish, toasted bread (moistened), or ordinary bread and\nbutter. The prepared bait should be placed in rat runs, about a\nteaspoonful at a place. If a single application of the poison fails to\nkill or drive away all rats from the premises, it should be repeated\nwith a change of bait.\n\n=Strychnin.=--Strychnin is too rapid in action to make its use for rats\ndesirable in houses, but elsewhere it may be employed effectively.\nStrychnia sulphate is the best form to use. The dry crystals may be\ninserted in small pieces of raw meat, Vienna sausage, or toasted cheese,\nand these placed in rat runs or burrows; or oatmeal may be moistened\nwith a strychnin sirup and small quantities laid in the same way.\n\nStrychnin sirup is prepared as follows: Dissolve a half ounce of\nstrychnia sulphate in a pint of boiling water; add a pint of thick sugar\nsirup and stir thoroughly. A smaller quantity may be prepared with a\nproportional quantity of water and sirup. In preparing the bait it is\nnecessary to moisten all the oatmeal with the sirup. Wheat and corn are\nexcellent alternative baits. The grain should be soaked overnight in the\nstrychnin sirup.\n\n=Arsenic.=--Arsenic is probably the most popular of the rat poisons,\nowing to its cheapness, yet our experiments prove that, measured by the\nresults obtained, arsenic is dearer than strychnin. Besides, arsenic is\nextremely variable in its effect upon rats, and if the animals survive a\nfirst dose it is very difficult to induce them to take another.\n\nPowdered white arsenic (arsenious acid) may be fed to rats in almost any\nof the baits mentioned under barium carbonate and strychnin. It has been\nused successfully when rubbed into fresh fish or spread on buttered\ntoast. Another method is to mix twelve parts by weight of corn meal and\none part of arsenic with whites of eggs into a stiff dough.\n\nAn old formula for poisoning rats and mice with arsenic is the\nfollowing, adapted from an English source:\n\nTake a pound of oatmeal, a pound of coarse brown sugar, and a spoonful\nof arsenic. Mix well together and put the composition into an earthen\njar. Put a tablespoonful at a place in runs frequented by rats.\n\n=Phosphorus.=--For poisoning rats and mice, phosphorus is used almost as\ncommonly as arsenic, and undoubtedly it is effective when given in an\nattractive bait. The phosphorus paste of the drug stores is usually\ndissolved yellow phosphorus, mixed with glucose or other substances. The\nproportion of phosphorus varies from one-fourth of 1 per cent to 4 per\ncent. The first amount is too small to be always effective and the last\nis dangerously inflammable. When homemade preparations of phosphorus are\nused there is much danger of burning the person or of setting fire to\ncrops or buildings. In the Western States many fires have resulted from\nputting out homemade phosphorus poisons for ground squirrels, and entire\nfields of ripe grain have been destroyed in this way. Even with\ncommercial pastes the action of sun and rain changes the phosphorus and\nleaches out the glucose until a highly inflammable residue is left.\n\nIt is often claimed that phosphorus eaten by rats or mice dries up or\nmummifies the body so that no odor results. The statement has no\nfoundation in fact. No known poison will prevent decomposition of the\nbody of an animal that died from its effects. Equally misleading is the\nstatement that rats poisoned with phosphorus do not die on the premises.\nOwing to its slower operation, no doubt a larger portion escape into the\nopen before dying than when strychnin is used.\n\nThe Biological Survey does not recommend the use of phosphorus as a\npoison for rodents.\n\n=Squills.=--The squill, or sea leek,[6] is a favorite rat poison in many\nparts of Europe and is well worthy of trial in America. It is rapid and\nvery deadly in its action, and rats seem to eat it readily. The poison\nis used in several ways. Two ounces of dry squills, powdered, may be\nthoroughly mixed with eight ounces of toasted cheese or of butter and\nmeal and put out in runs of rats or mice. Another formula recommends two\nparts of squills to three parts of finely chopped bacon, mixed with meal\nenough to make it cohere. This is baked in small cakes.\n\n=Poison in poultry houses.=--For poisoning rats in buildings and yards\noccupied by poultry the following method is recommended: Two wooden\nboxes should be used, one considerably larger than the other and each\nhaving one or more holes in the sides large enough to admit rats. The\npoisoned bait should be placed on the bottom and near the middle of the\nsmaller box, and the larger box should then be inverted over it. Rats\nthus have free access to the bait, but fowls are excluded.\n\n\nDOMESTIC ANIMALS.\n\nAmong domestic animals employed to kill rats are the dog, the cat, and\nthe ferret.\n\n=Dogs.=--The value of dogs as ratters can not be appreciated by persons\nwho have had no experience with a trained animal. The ordinary cur and\nthe larger breeds of dogs seldom develop the necessary qualities for\nratters. Small Irish, Scotch, and fox terriers, when properly trained,\nare superior to other breeds and under favorable circumstances may be\nrelied upon to keep the farm premises reasonably free from rats.\n\n=Cats.=--However valuable cats may be as mousers, few learn to catch\nrats. The ordinary house cat is too well fed and consequently too lazy\nto undertake the capture of an animal as formidable as the brown rat.\nBirds and mice are much more to its liking. Cats that are fearless of\nrats, however, and have learned to hunt and destroy them are often very\nuseful about stables and warehouses. They should be lightly fed, chiefly\non milk. A little sulphur in the milk at intervals is a corrective\nagainst the bad effects of a constant rat or mouse diet. Cats often die\nfrom eating these rodents.\n\n=Ferrets.=--Tame ferrets, like weasels, are inveterate foes of rats, and\ncan follow the rodents into their retreats. Under favorable\ncircumstances they are useful aids to the rat catcher, but their value\nis greatly overestimated. For effective work they require experienced\nhandling and the additional services of a dog or two. Dogs and ferrets\nmust be thoroughly accustomed to each other, and the former must be\nquiet and steady instead of noisy and excitable. The ferret is used only\nto bolt the rats, which are killed by the dogs. If unmuzzled ferrets are\nsent into rat retreats, they are apt to make a kill and then lie up\nafter sucking the blood of their victim. Sometimes they remain for hours\nin the burrows or escape by other exits and are lost. There is danger\nthat these lost ferrets may adapt themselves to wild conditions and\nbecome a pest by preying upon poultry and birds.\n\n\nFUMIGATION.\n\nRats may be destroyed in their burrows in the fields and along river\nbanks, levees, and dikes by carbon bisulphid.[7] A wad of cotton or\nother absorbent material is saturated with the liquid and then pushed\ninto the burrow, the opening being packed with earth to prevent the\nescape of the gas. All animals in the burrow are asphyxiated. Fumigation\nin buildings is not so satisfactory, because it is difficult to confine\nthe gases. Moreover, when effective, the odor from the dead rats is\nhighly objectionable in occupied buildings.\n\nChlorin, carbon monoxid, sulphur dioxid, and hydrocyanic acid are the\ngases most used for destroying rats and mice in sheds, warehouses, and\nstores. Each is effective if the gas can be confined and made to reach\nthe retreats of the animals. Owing to the great danger from fire\nincident to burning charcoal or sulphur in open pans, a special furnace\nprovided with means for forcing the gas into the compartments of vessels\nor buildings is generally employed.\n\nHydrocyanic-acid gas is effective in destroying all animal life in\nbuildings. It has been successfully used to free elevators and\nwarehouses of rats, mice, and insects. However, it is so dangerous to\nhuman life that the novice should not attempt fumigation with it, except\nunder careful instructions. Directions for preparing and using the gas\nmay be found in a publication entitled Hydrocyanic-acid Gas against\nHousehold Insects, by Dr. L. O. Howard and Charles H. Popenoe.[8]\n\nCarbon monoxid is rather dangerous, as its presence in the hold of a\nvessel or other compartment is not manifest to the senses, and fatal\naccidents have occurred during its employment to fumigate vessels.\n\nChlorin gas has a strong bleaching action upon textile fabrics, and for\nthis reason can not be used in many situations.\n\nSulphur dioxid also has a bleaching effect upon textiles, but less\nmarked than that of chlorin, and ordinarily it is not noticeable with\nthe small percentage of the gas it is necessary to use. On the whole,\nthis gas has many advantages as a fumigator and disinfectant. It is used\nalso as a fire extinguisher on board vessels. Special furnaces for\ngenerating the gas and forcing it into the compartments of ships and\nbuildings are on the market, and many steamships and docks are now\nfitted with the necessary apparatus.\n\n\nRAT VIRUSES.\n\nSeveral microorganisms, or bacteria, found originally in diseased rats\nor mice, have been exploited for destroying rats. A number of these\nso-called rat viruses are on the American market. The Biological Survey,\nthe Bureau of Animal Industry, and the United States Public Health\nService have made careful investigations and practical tests of these\nviruses, mostly with negative results. The cultures tested by the\nBiological Survey have not proved satisfactory.\n\nThe chief defects to be overcome before the cultures can be recommended\nfor general use are:\n\n1. The virulence is not great enough to kill a sufficiently high\npercentage of rats that eat food containing the microorganisms.\n\n2. The virulence decreases with the age of the cultures. They\ndeteriorate in warm weather and in bright sunlight.\n\n3. The diseases resulting from the microorganisms are not contagious and\ndo not spread by contact of diseased with healthy animals.\n\n4. The comparative cost of the cultures is too great for general use.\nSince they have no advantages over the common poisons, except that they\nare usually harmless to man and other animals, they should be equally\ncheap; but their actual cost is much greater. Moreover, considering the\nskill and care necessary in their preparation, it is doubtful if the\ncost can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, therefore, does not prepare, use, or\nrecommend the use of rat viruses.\n\n\nNATURAL ENEMIES OF RATS AND MICE.\n\nAmong the natural enemies of rats and mice are the larger hawks and\nowls, skunks, foxes, coyotes, weasels, minks, dogs, cats, and ferrets.\n\nProbably the greatest factor in the increase of rats, mice, and other\ndestructive rodents in the United States has been the persistent killing\noff of the birds and mammals that prey upon them. Animals that on the\nwhole are decidedly beneficial, since they subsist upon harmful insects\nand rodents, are habitually destroyed by some farmers and sportsmen\nbecause they occasionally kill a chicken or a game bird.\n\nThe value of carnivorous mammals and the larger birds of prey in\ndestroying rats and mice should be more fully recognized, especially by\nthe farmer and the game preserver. Rats actually destroy more poultry\nand game, both eggs and young chicks, than all the birds and wild\nmammals combined; yet some of their enemies among our most useful birds\nof prey and carnivorous mammals are persecuted almost to the point of\nextinction. An enlightened public sentiment should cause the repeal of\nall bounties on these animals and afford protection to the majority of\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nORGANIZED EFFORTS TO DESTROY RATS.\n\n\nThe necessity of cooperation and organization in the work of rat\ndestruction is of the utmost importance. To destroy all the animals on\nthe premises of a single farmer in a community has little permanent\nvalue, since they are soon replaced from near-by farms. If, however, the\nfarmers of an entire township or county unite in efforts to get rid of\nrats, much more lasting results may be attained. If continued from year\nto year, such organized efforts are very effective.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY EFFORTS.\n\nCooperative efforts to destroy rats have taken various forms in\ndifferent localities. In cities, municipal employees have occasionally\nbeen set at work hunting rats from their retreats, with at least\ntemporary benefit to the community. Thus, in 1904, at Folkestone,\nEngland, a town of about 25,000 inhabitants, the corporation employees,\nhelped by dogs, in three days killed 1,645 rats.\n\nSide hunts in which rats are the only animals that count in the contest\nhave sometimes been organized and successfully carried out. At New\nBurlington, Ohio, a rat hunt took place some years ago in which each of\nthe two sides killed over 8,000 rats, the beaten party serving a banquet\nto the winners.\n\nThere is danger that organized rat hunts will be followed by long\nintervals of indifference and inaction. This may be prevented by\noffering prizes covering a definite period of effort. Such prizes\naccomplish more than municipal bounties, because they secure a friendly\nrivalry which stimulates the contestants to do their utmost to win.\n\nIn England and some of its colonies contests for prizes have been\norganized to promote the destruction of the English, or house, sparrow,\nbut many of the so-called sparrow clubs are really sparrow and rat\nclubs, for the destruction of both pests is the avowed object of the\norganizations. A sparrow club in Kent, England, accomplished the\ndestruction of 28,000 sparrows and 16,000 rats in three seasons by the\nannual expenditure of but \u00c2\u00a36 ($29.20) in prize money. Had ordinary\nbounties been paid for this destruction, the tax on the community would\nhave been about \u00c2\u00a3250 (over $1,200).\n\nMany organizations already formed should be interested in destroying\nrats. Boards of trade, civic societies, and citizens' associations in\ntowns and farmers' and women's clubs in rural communities will find the\nsubject of great importance. Women's municipal leagues in several large\ncities already have taken up the matter. The league in Baltimore\nrecently secured appropriations of funds for expenditure in fighting\nmosquitoes, flies, and rats. The league in Boston during the past year,\nsupported by voluntary contributions for the purpose, made a highly\ncreditable educational campaign against rats. Boys' corn clubs, the\ntroops of Boy Scouts, and similar organizations could do excellent work\nin rat campaigns.\n\n\nSTATE AND NATIONAL AID.\n\nTo secure permanent results any general campaign for the elimination of\nrats must aim at _building the animals out of shelter and food_.\nBuilding reforms depend on municipal ordinances and legislative\nenactments. The recent plague eradication work of the United States\nPublic Health Service in San Francisco, Seattle, New Orleans, and at\nvarious places in Hawaii and Porto Rico required such ordinances and\nlaws as well as financial aid in prosecuting the work. The campaign of\nDanish and Swedish organizations for the destruction of rats had the\nhelp of governmental appropriations. The legislatures of California,\nTexas, Indiana, and Hawaii have in recent years passed laws or made\nappropriations to aid in rat riddance. It is probable that\nwell-organized efforts of communities would soon win legislative support\neverywhere. Communities should not postpone efforts, however, while\nwaiting for legislative cooperation, but should at once organize and\nbegin repressive operations. Wherever health is threatened the Public\nHealth Service of the United States can cooperate, and where crops and\nother products are endangered the Bureau of Biological Survey of the\nDepartment of Agriculture is ready to assist by advice and in\ndemonstration of methods.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT REPRESSIVE MEASURES.\n\n\nThe measures needed for repressing and eliminating rats and mice include\nthe following:\n\n1. The requirement that all new buildings erected shall be made\nrat-proof under competent inspection.\n\n2. That all existing rat-proof buildings shall be closed against rats\nand mice by having all openings accessible to the animals, from\nfoundation to roof, closed or screened by door, window, grating, or\nmeshed wire netting.\n\n3. That all buildings not of rat-proof construction shall be made so by\nremodeling, by the use of materials that may not be pierced by rats, or\nby elevation.\n\n4. The protection of our native hawks, owls, and smaller predatory\nmammals--the natural enemies of rats.\n\n5. Greater cleanliness about markets, grocery stores, warehouses,\ncourts, alleys, stables, and vacant lots in cities and villages, and\nlike care on farms and suburban premises. This includes the storage of\nwaste and garbage in tightly covered vessels and the prompt disposal of\nit each day.\n\n6. Care in the construction of drains and sewers, so as not to provide\nentrance and retreat for rats. Old brick sewers in cities should be\nreplaced by concrete or tile.\n\n7. The early threshing and marketing of grains on farms, so that stacks\nand mows shall not furnish harborage and food for rats.\n\n8. Removal of outlying straw stacks and piles of trash or lumber that\nharbor rats in fields and vacant lots.\n\n9. The keeping of provisions, seed grain, and foodstuffs in rat-proof\ncontainers.\n\n10. Keeping effective rat dogs, especially on farms and in city\nwarehouses.\n\n11. The systematic destruction of rats, whenever and wherever possible,\nby (_a_) trapping, (_b_) poisoning, and (_c_) organized hunts.\n\n12. The organization of clubs and other societies for systematic warfare\nagainst rats.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] _Mus musculus._\n\n[2] _Rattus norvegicus._\n\n[3] _Rattus rattus rattus._\n\n[4] _Rattus rattus alexandrinus._\n\n[5] Farmers' Bulletin 461, Use of Concrete on the Farm, will prove\nuseful to city and village dwellers as well as to the farmer.\n\n[6] _Scilla maritima._\n\n[7] CAUTION.--Carbon disulphid is very inflammable and can be ignited by\na match, lantern, cigar, or pipe.\n\n[8] Farmers' Bulletin 699.\n\n\n\n\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RELATING TO\nNOXIOUS MAMMALS.\n\n\nAVAILABLE FOR FREE DISTRIBUTION.\n\n    How to Destroy Rats.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1109,"split":"test"}
