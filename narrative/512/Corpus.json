{"ori_id":"77e055181c15321c82ef247dc7f421a30433456f","title":"The Adventures of Roderick Random","context":"The Adventures of Roderick Random\n The novel is set in the 1730s and 1740s and tells the life story (in the first person) of Roderick \"Rory\" Random, who was born to a Scottish gentleman and a lower-class woman and is thus shunned by his father's family. His mother dies soon after giving birth and his father is driven mad with grief. Random's paternal grandfather coerces a local school master into providing free education for the boy, who becomes popular with his classmates (some of whom he encounters again in subsequent adventures) and learns Latin, French, Italian and ancient Greek. The language accomplishments are despite, rather than because of, the abusive tutor who oppresses Random at every opportunity. Finally Random is cast out after the tutor exacts revenge for one of Random's escapades and denounces him to his grandfather. With none of his paternal family willing to assist him in any way, Random relies on his wits and the occasional support of his maternal uncle, Tom Bowling.\nThe naive Random then embarks on a series of adventures and misadventures, visiting inter alia: London, Bath, France, the West Indies, West Africa and South America. With little money to support himself, he encounters malice, discrimination and sharpers at every turn. His honest and trustworthy character and medical skills do however win him a few staunch friends.\nRoderick spends much of the novel trying to attract the attention of various wealthy women he meets, so that he can live comfortably and take up his rightful entitlement as a gentleman. To that end he poses as a nobleman several times, including once while he is in France.\nRoderick and his companion Hugh Strap end up serving twice on British ships, once on a privateer and once on a warship after being press-ganged.\nThe novel ends happily when Random is reunited with his now wealthy father in Argentina. He inherits some funds immediately, enabling him to marry the lovely Narcissa without the consent of her guardian brother.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\nProject Gutenberg's The Adventures of Roderick Random, by Tobias\nSmollett\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost\nno restrictions whatsoever.

The reader gratifies his\ncuriosity in pursuing the adventures of a person in whose favour he\nis prepossessed; he espouses his cause, he sympathises with him in his\ndistress, his indignation is heated against the authors of his calamity:\nthe humane passions are inflamed; the contrast between dejected\nvirtue and insulting vice appears with greater aggravation, and every\nimpression having a double force on the imagination, the memory retains\nthe circumstance, and the heart improves by the example. The attention\nis not tired with a bare catalogue of characters, but agreeably diverted\nwith all the variety of invention; and the vicissitudes of life appear\nin their peculiar circumstances, opening an ample field for wit and\nhumour.\n\nRomance, no doubt, owes its origin to ignorance, vanity, and\nsuperstition. In the dark ages of the World, when a man had rendered\nhimself famous for wisdom or valour, his family and adherents availed\nthemselves of his superior qualities, magnified his virtues, and\nrepresented his character and person as sacred and supernatural. The\nvulgar easily swallowed the bait, implored his protection, and yielded\nthe tribute of homage and praise, even to adoration; his exploits\nwere handed down to posterity with a thousand exaggerations; they were\nrepeated as incitements to virtue; divine honours were paid, and altars\nerected to his memory, for the encouragement of those who attempted to\nimitate his example; and hence arose the heathen mythology, which is no\nother than a collection of extravagant romances. As learning advanced,\nand genius received cultivation, these stories were embellished with the\ngraces of poetry, that they might the better recommend themselves to the\nattention; they were sung in public, at festivals, for the instruction\nand delight of the audience; and rehearsed before battle, as incentives\nto deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the epic muse were born, and, in\nthe progress of taste, arrived at perfection. It is no wonder that the\nancients could not relish a fable in prose, after they had seen so many\nremarkable events celebrated in verse by their best poets; we therefore\nfind no romance among them during the era of their excellence, unless\nthe Cyropaedia of Xenophon may be so called; and it was not till arts\nand sciences began to revive after the irruption of the barbarians into\nEurope, that anything of this kind appeared. But when the minds of men\nwere debauched by the imposition of priestcraft to the most absurd\npitch of credulity, the authors of romance arose, and losing sight\nof probability, filled their performances with the most monstrous\nhyperboles. If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius\nthey were resolved to excel them in fiction, and apply to the wonder,\nrather than the judgment, of their readers. Accordingly, they brought\nnecromancy to their aid, and instead of supporting the character of\ntheir heroes by dignity of sentiment and practice, distinguished them by\ntheir bodily strength, activity, and extravagance of behaviour. Although\nnothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural than the figures they\ndrew, they did not want patrons and admirers; and the world actually\nbegan to be infected with the spirit of knight-errantry, when Cervantes,\nby an inimitable piece of ridicule, reformed the taste of mankind,\nrepresenting chivalry in the right point of view, and converting romance\nto purposes far more useful and entertaining, by making it assume the\nsock, and point out the follies of ordinary life.\n\nThe same method has been practised by other Spanish and French authors,\nand by none more successfully than by Monsieur Le Sage, who, in his\nAdventures of Gil Blas, has described the knavery and foibles of life,\nwith infinite humour and sagacity. The following sheets I have modelled\non his plan, taking me liberty, however, to differ from him in the\nexecution, where I thought his particular situations were uncommon,\nextravagant, or peculiar to the country in which the scene is laid.\nThe disgraces of Gil Blas are, for the most part, such as rather excite\nmirth than compassion; he himself laughs at them; and his transitions\nfrom distress to happiness, or at least ease, are so sudden, that\nneither the reader has time to pity him, nor himself to be acquainted\nwith affliction. This conduct, in my opinion, not only deviates from\nprobability, but prevents that generous indignation, which ought to\nanimate the reader against the sordid and vicious disposition of the\nworld. I have attempted to represent modest merit struggling with every\ndifficulty to which a friendless orphan is exposed, from his own want\nof experience, as well as from the selfishness, envy, malice, and base\nindifference of mankind. To secure a favourable prepossession, I have\nallowed him the advantages of birth and education, which in the series\nof his misfortunes will, I hope, engage the ingenuous more warmly in his\nbehalf; and though I foresee, that some people will be offended at\nthe mean scenes in which he is involved, I persuade myself that the\njudicious will not only perceive the necessity of describing those\nsituations to which he must of course be confined, in his low estate,\nbut also find entertainment in viewing those parts of life, where\nthe humours and passions are undisguised by affectation, ceremony, or\neducation; and the whimsical peculiarities of disposition appear as\nnature has implanted them. But I believe I need not trouble myself in\nvindicating a practice authorized by the best writers in this way, some\nof whom I have already named.\n\nEvery intelligent reader will, at first sight, perceive I have not\ndeviated from nature in the facts, which are all true in the main,\nalthough the circumstances are altered and disguised, to avoid personal\nsatire.\n\nIt now remains to give my reasons for making the chief personage of\nthis work a North Briton, which are chiefly these: I could, at a small\nexpense, bestow on him such education as I thought the dignity of his\nbirth and character required, which could not possibly be obtained in\nEngland, by such slender means as the nature of my plan would afford.\nlit the next place, I could represent simplicity of manners in a remote\npart of the kingdom, with more propriety than in any place near\nthe capital; and lastly, the disposition of the Scots, addicted to\ntravelling, justifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that\ncountry. That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning\noaths which proceed from the mouths of some persons in these memoirs,\nI beg leave to promise, that I imagined nothing could more effectually\nexpose the absurdity of such miserable expletives, than a natural and\nverbal representation of the discourse in which they occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPOLOGUE\n\nA young painter, indulging a vein of pleasantry, sketched a kind of\nconversation piece, representing a bear, an owl, a monkey, and an ass;\nand to render it more striking, humorous, and moral, distinguished every\nfigure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was exhibited in the garb and\nattitude of an old, toothless, drunken soldier; the owl perched upon the\nhandle of a coffee-pot, with spectacle on nose, seemed to contemplate a\nnewspaper; and the ass, ornamented with a huge tie-wig (which, however,\ncould not conceal his long ears), sat for his picture to the monkey, who\nappeared with the implements of painting. This whimsical group afforded\nsome mirth, and met with general approbation, until some mischievous wag\nhinted that the whole--was a lampoon upon the friends of the performer;\nan insinuation which was no sooner circulated than those very people who\napplauded it before began to be alarmed, and even to fancy themselves\nsignified by the several figures of the piece.\n\nAmong others, a worthy personage in years, who had served in the army\nwith reputation, being incensed at the Supposed outrage, repaired to the\nlodging of the painter, and finding him at home, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, Mr. Monkey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a good mind to convince you, that though the bear has\nlost his teeth, he retains his paws, and that he is not so drunk but he\ncan perceive your impertinence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSblood! sir, that toothless jaw is a\nd--ned scandalous libel--but don't you imagine me so chopfallen as not\nto be able to chew the cud of resentment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he was interrupted by\nthe arrival of a learned physician, who, advancing to the culprit with\nfury in his aspect, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose the augmentation of the ass's\nears should prove the diminution of the baboon's--nay, seek not to\nprevaricate, for, by the beard of Aesculapius! there is not one hair\nin this periwig that will not stand up in judgment to convict thee of\npersonal abuse. Do but observe, captain, how this pitiful little fellow\nhas copied the very curls--the colour, indeed, is different, but then\nthe form and foretop are quite similar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While he thus remonstrated in a\nstrain of vociferation, a venerable senator entered, and waddling up to\nthe delinquent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJackanapes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will now let thee see I\ncan read something else than a newspaper, and that without the help of\nspectacles: here is your own note of hand, sirrah, for money, which if\nI had not advanced, you yourself would have resembled an owl, in not\ndaring to show your face by day, you ungrateful slanderous knave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn vain the astonished painter declared that he had no intention to\ngive offence, or to characterise particular persons: they affirmed\nthe resemblance was too palpable to be overlooked; they taxed him with\ninsolence, malice, and ingratitude; and their clamours being overheard\nby the public, the captain was a bear, the doctor an ass, and the\nsenator an owl, to his dying day.\n\nChristian reader, I beseech thee, in the bowels of the Lord, remember\nthis example \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile thou art employed in the perusal of the following\nsheets; and seek not to appropriate to thyself that which equally\nbelongs to five hundred different people. If thou shouldst meet with a\ncharacter that reflects thee in some ungracious particular, keep thy\nown counsel; consider that one feature makes not a face, and that\nthough thou art, perhaps, distinguished by a bottle nose, twenty of thy\nneighbours may be in the same predicament.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF RODERICK RANDOM\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nOf my Birth and Education\n\nI was born in the northern part of this united kingdom, in the house of\nmy grandfather, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who\nhad on many occasions signalised himself in behalf of his country; and\nwas remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exercised with\ngreat success in the station of a judge, particularly against beggars,\nfor whom he had a singular aversion.\n\nMy father (his youngest son) falling in love with a poor relation, who\nlived with the old gentleman in quality of a housekeeper, espoused\nher privately; and I was the first fruit of that marriage. During her\npregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much that her husband,\ntired with her importunity, at last consulted a highland seer, whose\nfavourable interpretation he would have secured beforehand by a\nbribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed she was delivered of a\ntennis-ball, which the devil (who, to her great surprise, acted the part\nof a midwife) struck so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared in\nan instant; and she was for some time inconsolable for the lost of\nher offspring; when, all on a sudden, she beheld it return with equal\nviolence, and enter the earth, beneath her feet, whence immediately\nsprang up a goodly tree covered with blossoms, the scent of which\noperated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke. The attentive sage,\nafter some deliberation, assured my parents, that their firstborn\nwould be a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and\ndifficulties, and at last return to his native land, where he would\nflourish in happiness and reputation. How truly this was foretold will\nappear in the sequel. It was not long before some officious person\ninformed my grandfather of certain familiarities that passed between his\nson and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that, a few days after, he\ntold my father it was high time for him to think of settling; and that\nhe had provided a match for him, to which he could in justice have no\nobjections. My father, finding it would be impossible to conceal his\nsituation much longer, frankly owned what he had done; and excused\nhimself for not having asked the consent of his father, by saying, he\nknew it would have been to no Purpose; and that, had his inclination\nbeen known, my grandfather might have taken such measures as would have\neffectually put the gratification of it out of his power: he added, that\nno exceptions could be taken to his wife's virtue, birth, beauty,\nand good sense, and as for fortune, it was beneath his care. The old\ngentleman, who kept all his passions, except one, in excellent order,\nheard him to an end with great temper, and then calmly asked, how he\nproposed to maintain himself and spouse? He replied, he could be in no\ndanger of wanting while his father's tenderness remained, which he and\nhis wife should always cultivate with the utmost veneration; and he\nwas persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the dignity and\ncircumstances of his family, and to the provision already made for his\nbrothers and sisters, who were happily settled under his protection.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour brothers and sisters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my grandfather, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid not think it\nbeneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony;\nneither, I suppose, would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you\nnot some secret fund in reserve; to the comforts of which I leave you,\nwith a desire that you will this night seek out another habitation for\nyourself and wife, whither, in a short time, I will send you an account\nof the expense I have been at in your education, with a view of\nbeing reimbursed. Sir, you have made the grand tour--you are a polite\ngentleman--a very pretty gentleman--I wish you a great deal of joy, and\nam your very humble servant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he left my father in a situation easily imagined. However,\nhe did not long hesitate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his\nfather's disposition, he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence\nto get rid of him; and his resolves being as invariable as the laws of\nthe Medes and Persians, he knew it would be to no purpose to attempt him\nby prayers and entreaties; so without any farther application, he betook\nhimself, with his disconsolate bedfellow to a farm-house, where an\nold servant of his mother dwelt: there they remained some time in\na situation but ill adapted to the elegance of their desires and\ntenderness of their love; which nevertheless my father chose to endure,\nrather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent but my mother,\nforeseeing the inconveniences to which she must have been exposed,\nhad she been delivered in this place (and her pregnancy was very far\nadvanced), without communicating her design to her husband, went in\ndisguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping that her tears and\ncondition would move him to compassion, and reconcile him to an event\nwhich was now irrecoverably past.\n\nShe found means to deceive the servants, and get introduced as an\nunfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of some matrimonial grievances,\nit being my grandfather's particular province to decide in all cases\nof scandal. She was accordingly admitted into his presence, where,\ndiscovering herself, she fell at his feet, and in the most affecting\nmanner implored his forgiveness; at the same the same time representing\nthe danger that threatened not only her life, but that of his own\ngrandchild, which was about to see the light. He told her he was sorry\nthat the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to make a\nvow, which put it out of his power to give them any assistance; that he\nhad already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her husband,\nand was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any farther\nimportunity. This said, he retired.\n\nThe violence of my mother's affliction had such an effect on her\nconstitution that she was immediately seized with the pains of childbed;\nand had not an old maidservant, to whom she was very dear, afforded\nher pity and assistance, at the hazard of incurring my grandfather's\ndispleasure, she and the innocent fruit of her womb must have fallen\nmiserable victims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the friendship\nof this poor woman she was carried up to a garret, and immediately\ndelivered of a man child, the story of whose unfortunate birth he\nhimself now relates. My father, being informed of what had happened,\nflew to the embraces of his darling spouse, and while he loaded his\noffspring with paternal embraces, could not forbear shedding a flood\nof tears on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for whose ease he\nwould have sacrificed the treasures of the east) stretched upon a\nflock bed, in a miserable apartment, unable to protect her from the\ninclemencies of the weather. It is not to be supposed that the old\ngentleman was ignorant of what passed, though he affected to know\nnothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much surprised, when one\nof his grandchildren, by his eldest son deceased, who lived with him\nas his heir apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined\ntherefore to observe no medium, but immediately (on the third day after\nher delivery) sent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off\nthe servant who had preserved her life. This behaviour so exasperated\nmy father that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations; and on\nhis bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him if ever he should\nforget or forgive the barbarity of his sire.\n\nThe injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in such\ncircumstances, and the want of necessaries where she lodged, together\nwith her grief and anxiety of mind, soon threw her into a languishing\ndisorder, which put an end to her life. My father, who loved her\ntenderly, was so affected with her death that he remained six weeks\ndeprived of his senses; during which time, the people where he lodged\ncarried the infant to the old man who relented so far, on hearing the\nmelancholy story of his daughter-in-law's death, and the deplorable\ncondition of his son, as to send the child to nurse, and he ordered my\nfather to be carried home to his house, where he soon recovered the use\nof his reason.\n\nWhether this hardhearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment\nof his son and daughter, or (which is more probable) was afraid his\ncharacter would suffer in the neighbourhood, he professed great sorrow\nfor his conduct to my father, whose delirium was succeeded by a profound\nmelancholy and reserve. At length he disappeared, and, notwithstanding\nall imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a circumstance which\nconfirmed most people in the opinion of his having made away with\nhimself in a fit of despair. How I understood the particulars of my\nbirth will appear in the course of these memoirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nI grow up--am hated by my Relations--sent to School--neglected by my\nGrandfather--maltreated by my Master--seasoned to Adversity--I form\nCabals against the Pedant--am debarred Access to my Grandfather--hunted\nby his Heir--I demolish the Teeth of his Tutor\n\nThere were not wanting some who suspected my uncles of being concerned\nin my father's fate, on the supposition that they would all share in\nthe patrimony destined for him; and this conjecture was strengthened by\nreflecting that in all his calamities they never discovered the least\ninclination to serve him; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in\ntheir power, fed his resentment and supported his resolution of leaving\nhim to misery and want. But people of judgment treated this insinuation\nas an idle chimera; because, had my relations been so wicked as to\nconsult their interest by committing such an atrocious crime, the\nfate of my father would have extended to me too whose life was another\nobstacle to their expectation. Meanwhile, I grew apace, and as I\nstrongly resembled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I\nwanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford: but\ntheir favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my\ncousins; who the more my infancy promised, conceived the more implacable\nhatred against me: and before I was six years of age, had so effectually\nblockaded my grandfather that I never saw him but by stealth, when I\nsometimes made up to his chair as he sat to view his labourers in the\nfield: on which occasion he would stroke my head, bid me be a good boy,\nand promise to take care of me.\n\nI was soon after sent to school at a village hard by, of which he had\nbeen dictator time out of mind; but as he never paid for my board, nor\nsupplied me with clothes, books, and other necessaries I required, my\ncondition was very ragged and contemptible, and the schoolmaster,\nwho, through fear of my grandfather, taught me gratis, gave himself no\nconcern about the progress I made under his instruction. In spite of\nall these difficulties and disgraces, I became a good proficient in\nthe Latin tongue; and, as soon as I could write tolerably, pestered my\ngrandfather with letters to such a degree that he sent for my master,\nand chid him severely for bestowing such pains on my education, telling\nhim that, if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery, which\nhe had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head.\n\nThe pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of his patron,\nassured his honour that the boy's ability was more owing to his own\ngenius and application than to any instruction or encouragement he\nreceived; that, although he could not divest him of the knowledge he had\nalready imbibed, unless he would empower him to disable his fingers, he\nshould endeavour, with God's help, to prevent his future improvement.\nAnd, indeed, he punctually performed what he had undertaken; for, on\npretence that I had written impertinent letters to my grandfather, he\ncaused a board to be made with five holes in it, through which he thrust\nthe fingers and thumb of my right hand, and fastened it by whipcord to\nmy wrist, in such a manner as effectually debarred me the use of my pen.\nBut this restraint I was freed from in a few days, by an accident which\nhappened in a quarrel between me and another boy; who, taking upon him\nto insult my poverty, I was so incensed at his ungenerous reproach that\nwith one stroke with my machine I cut him to the skull, to the great\nterror of myself and schoolfellows, who left him bleeding on the ground,\nand ran to inform the master of what had happened. I was so severely\npunished for this trespass that, were I to live to the age of\nMethusalem, the impression it made on me would not be effaced; the more\nthan the antipathy and horror I conceived for the merciless tyrant who\ninflicted it. The contempt which my appearance naturally produced in\nall who saw me, the continual wants to which I was exposed, and my own\nhaughty disposition, impatient of affronts, involved me in a thousand\ntroublesome adventures, by which I was at length inured in adversity,\nand emboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly\nscourged for crimes I did not commit, because, having the character of\na vagabond in the village, every piece of mischief, whose author lay\nunknown, was charged upon me. I have been found guilty of robbing\norchards I never entered, of killing cats I never hunted, of stealing\ngingerbread I never touched, and of abusing old women I never saw. Nay,\na stammering carpenter had eloquence enough to persuade my master that\nI fired a pistol loaded with small shot into his window; though my\nlandlady and the whole family bore witness that I was abed fast asleep\nat the time when this outrage was committed, I was once flogged for\nhaving narrowly escaped drowning, by the sinking of a ferry boat in\nwhich I was passenger. Another time, for having recovered of a bruise\noccasioned by a horse and cart running over me. A third time, for being\nbitten by a baker's dog. In short, whether I was guilty or unfortunate,\nthe correction and sympathy of this arbitrary pedagogue were the same.\n\nFar from being subdued by this informal usage, my indignation triumphed\nover that slavish awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience; and\nthe more my years and knowledge increased, the more I perceived the\ninjustice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon\ngenius, and the advice and direction of our usher, who had served my\nfather in his travels, I made a surprising progress in the classics,\nwriting, and arithmetic; so that, before I was twelve years old, I\nwas allowed by everybody to be the best scholar in the school. This\nqualification, together with the boldness of temper and strength of make\nwhich had subjected almost all my contemporaries, gave me such influence\nover them that I began to form cabals against my persecutor; and was in\nhope of, being able to bid him defiance in a very short time. Being at\nthe head of a faction, consisting of thirty boys, most of them of my own\nage, I was determined to put their mettle to trial, that I might know\nhow far they were to be depended upon, before I put my grand scheme in\nexecution: with this view, we attacked a body of stout apprentices,\nwho had taken possession of a part of the ground allotted to us for the\nscheme of our diversions, and who were then playing at ninepins on\nthe spot; but I had the mortification to see my adherents routed in an\ninstant, and a leg of one of them broke in his flight by the bowl, which\none of our adversaries had detached in pursuit of us. This discomfiture\ndid not hinder us from engaging them afterwards in frequent skirmishes,\nwhich we maintained by throwing stones at a distance, wherein I received\nmany wounds, the scars of which still remain. Our enemies were so\nharassed and interrupted by these alarms that they at last abandoned\ntheir conquest, and left us to the peaceable enjoyment of our own\nterritories.\n\nIt would be endless to enumerate the exploits we performed in the course\nof this confederacy, which became the terror of the whole village;\ninsomuch that, when different interests divided it, one of the parties\ncommonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random (by which name I\nwas known) to cast the balance, and keep the opposite faction in awe.\nMeanwhile, I took the advantage of every play-day to present myself\nbefore my grandfather, to whom I seldom found access, by reason of his\nbeing closely besieged by a numerous family of his female grandchildren,\nwho, though they perpetually quarrelled among themselves, never failed\nto join against me, as the common enemy of all. His heir, who was about\nthe age of eighteen, minded nothing but fox-hunting, and indeed was\nqualified for nothing else, notwithstanding his grandfather's indulgence\nin entertaining a tutor for him at home; who at the same time performed\nthe office of parish clerk. This young Actaeon, who inherited his\ngrandfather's antipathy to everything in distress, never sat eyes on\nme without uncoupling his beagles, and hunting me into some cottage or\nother, whither I generally fled for shelter. In this Christian\namusement he was encouraged by his preceptor, who, no doubt, took such\nopportunities to ingratiate himself with the rising sun, observing, that\nthe old gentleman, according to the course of nature, had not long to\nlive, for he was already on the verge of fourscore.\n\nThe behaviour of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much, that one\nday, when I was beleaguered by him and his hounds in a farmer's house,\nwhere I had found protection, I took aim at him (being an excellent\nmarksman) with a large pebble, which struck out four of his foreteeth,\nand effectually incapacitated him from doing the office of a clerk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMy Mother's Brother arrives--relieves me--a Description of him--he goes\nalong with me to the House of my Grandfather--is encountered by his\nDogs--defeats them, after a bloody Engagement--is admitted to the old\nGentleman--a Dialogue between them\n\nAbout this time my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad,\nlieutenant of a man-of-war, arrived in his own country; where being\ninformed of my condition, he came to see me, and out of his slender\nfinances not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the\npresent, but resolved not to leave the country until he had prevailed on\nmy grandfather to settle something handsome for the future. This was\na task to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant, not\nonly of the judge's disposition, but also of the ways of men in general,\nto which his education on board had kept him an utter stranger.\n\nHe was a strong built man, somewhat bandy legged, with a neck like that\nof a bull, and a face which (you might easily perceive) had withstood\nthe most obstinate assaults of the weather. His dress consisted of a\nsoldier's coat altered for him by the ship's tailor, a striped flannel\njacket, a pair of red breeches spanned with pitch, clean gray worsted\nstockings, large silver buckles that covered three-fourths of his shoes,\na silver-laced hat, whose crown overlooked the brims about an inch and\na half, black bobwig in buckle, a check shirt, a silk handkerchief, a\nhanger, with a brass handle, girded to his thigh by a furnished lace\nbelt, and a good oak plant under his arm. Thus equipped, he set out\nwith me (who by his bounty made a very decent appearance) for my\ngrandfather's house, where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar, whom\nmy cousin, young master, had let loose at our approach. Being well\nacquainted with the inveteracy of these curs, I was about to betake\nmyself to my heels, when my uncle seized me with one hand, brandished\nhis cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the\nground; but, finding himself attacked at the same time in the rear by\nJowler, and fearing Caesar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheeled\nabout, and by a lucky stroke severed Jowler's head from his body. By\nthis time, the young foxhunter and three servants, armed with pitchforks\nand flails, were come to the assistance of the dogs, whom they found\nbreathless upon the field; and my cousin was so provoked at the death\nof his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance, and take\nvengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the curses and\nreproaches his anger could suggest. Upon which my uncle stepped\nforwards with an undaunted air, at the sight of whose bloody weapons his\nantagonists fell back with precipitation, when he accosted their leader\nthus:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLookee, brother, your dogs having boarded me without provocation, what\nI did was in my own defence. So you had best be civil, and let us shoot\na head, clear of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhether the young squire misinterpreted my uncle's desire of peace,\nor was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his usual pitch\nof resolution, I know not; but he snatched a flail from one of his\nfollowers, and came up with a show of assaulting the lieutenant, who,\nputting himself in a posture of defence, proceeded thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLookee, you\nlubberly son of a w--e, if you come athwart me, 'ware your gingerbread\nwork. I'll be foul of your quarter, d--n me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis declaration, followed by a flourish of his hanger, seemed to check\nthe progress of the young gentleman's choler, who, looking behind him,\nperceived his attendants had slunk into the house, shut the gate, and\nleft him to decide the contention by himself.\n\nHere a parley ensued, which was introduced by my cousin's asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\nthe devil are you? What do you want? Some scoundrel of a seaman, I\nsuppose, who has deserted and turned thief. But don't think you shall\nescape, sirrah--I'll have you hang'd, you dog, I will. Your blood shall\npay for that of my two hounds, you ragamuffin. I would not have parted\nwith them to save your whole generation from the gallows, you ruffian,\nyou!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of your jaw, you swab--none of your jaw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied my uncle,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009celse I shall trim your laced jacket for you. I shall rub you down with\nan oaken towel, my boy, I shall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he sheathed his hanger, and\ngrasped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the house being alarmed,\none of my female cousins opened a window, and asked what was the matter.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe matter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the lieutenant; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno great matter, young woman;\nI have business with the old gentleman, and this spark, belike, won't\nallow me to come alongside of him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that's all. After a few minutes\npause we were admitted, and conducted to my grandfather's chamber\nthrough a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very significant\nlooks as I passed along. When we came into the judge's presence my\nuncle, after two or three sea-bows, expressed himself in this manner;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour servant, your servant. What cheer, father? what cheer? I suppose\nyou don't know me--mayhap you don't. My name is Tom Bowling, and this\nhere boy, you look as if you did not know him neither; 'tis like you\nmayn't. He's new rigged, i'faith; his cloth don't shake in the wind so\nmuch as it wont to do. 'Tis my nephew, d'y see, Roderick Random--your\nown flesh and blood, old gentleman. Don't lay a-stern, you dog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pulling\nme forward. My grandfather (who was laid up with the gout) received this\nrelation, after his long absence, with that coldness of civility which\nwas peculiar to him; told him he was glad to see him, and desired him to\nsit down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank ye, thank ye, sir, I had as lief stand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my\nuncle; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor my own part, I desire nothing of you; but, if you have any\nconscience at all, do something for this poor boy, who has been used at\na very unchristian rate. Unchristian do I call it? I am sure the Moors\nin Barbary have more humanity than to leave their little ones to want.\nI would fain know why my sister's son is more neglected than that there\nfair-weather Jack\u00e2\u0080\u009d (pointing to the young squire, who with the rest of\nmy cousins had followed us into the room). \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs not he as near akin to\nyou as the other? Is he not much handsomer and better built than that\ngreat chucklehead? Come, come, consider, old gentleman, you are going\nin a short time to give an account of your evil actions. Remember the\nwrongs you did his father, and make all the satisfaction in your power\nbefore it be too late. The least thing you can do is to settle his\nfather's portion on him\u00e2\u0080\u009d The young ladies, who thought themselves too\nmuch concerned to contain themselves any longer, set up their\nthroats all together against my protector--\u00e2\u0080\u009cScurvy companion--saucy\ntarpaulin--rude, impertinent fellow, did he think to prescribe to\ngrandpapa? His sister's brat had been too well taken care of. Grandpapa\nwas too just not make a difference between an unnatural, rebellious son\nand his dutiful, loving children, who took his advice in all things;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and such expressions were vented against him with great violence; until\nthe judge at length commanded silence. He calmly rebuked my uncle for\nhis unmannerly behaviour, which he said he would excuse on account of\nhis education: he told him he had been very kind to the boy, whom he had\nkept at school seven or eight years, although he was informed he made no\nprogress in his learning but was addicted to all manner of vice, which\nhe rather believed, because he himself was witness to a barbarous piece\nof mischief he had committed on the jaws of his chaplain. But, however,\nhe would see what the lad was fit for, and bind him apprentice to some\nhonest tradesman or other, provided he would mend his manners, and\nbehave for the future as became him. The honest tar (whose pride and\nindignation boiled within him) answered my grandfather, that it was true\nhe had sent him to school, but it had cost him nothing, for he had never\nbeen at one shilling expense to furnish him with food, raiment, books,\nor other necessaries; so that it was not much to be wondered at, if\nthe boy made small progress; and yet whoever told him so was a lying,\nlubberly rascal, and deserved to be keel-haul'd; for though he (the\nlieutenant) did not understand those matters himself, he was well\ninformed as how Rory was the best scholar of his age in all the country;\nthe truth of which he would maintain, by laying a wager of his whole\nhalf-year's pay on the boy's head--with these words he pulled out his\npurse, and challenged the company: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither is he predicted to vice, as\nyou affirm, but rather, left like a wreck, d'ye see, at the mercy of the\nwind and weather, by your neglect, old gentleman. As for what happened\nto your chaplain, I am only sorry that he did not knock out the\nscoundrel's brains instead of his teeth. By the Lord, if ever I come up\nwith him, he had better be in Greenland, that's all. Thank you for your\ncourteous offer of binding the lad apprentice to a tradesman. I suppose\nyou would make a tailor of him--would you? I had rather see him hang'd,\nd'ye see. Come along, Rory, I perceive how the land lies, my boy--let's\ntack about, i'faith--while I have a shilling you shan't want a tester.\nB'we, old gentleman; you're bound for the other world, but I believe\ndamnably ill-provided for the voyage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus ended our visit; and we\nreturned to the village, my uncle muttering curses all the way against\nthe old shark and the young fry that surrounded him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMy Grandfather makes his Will--our second Visit--he Dies--his Will is\nread in Presence of all his living Descendants--the Disappointment of my\nfemale Cousins--my Uncle's Behaviour\n\nA few weeks after our first visit, we were informed that the old judge,\nat the end of a fit of thoughtfulness, which lasted three days, had sent\nfor a notary and made his will; that the distemper had mounted from his\nlegs to his stomach, and, being conscious of his approaching end, he had\ndesired to see all his descendants without exception. In obedience to\nthis summons, my uncle set out with me a second time, to receive the\nlast benediction of my grandfather: often repeating by the road, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEy,\ney, we have brought up the old hulk at last. You shall see--you shall\nsee the effect of my admonition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d When we entered his chamber, which was\ncrowded with his relations, we advanced to the bedside, where we found\nhim in his last agonies, supported by two of his granddaughters, who sat\non each side of him, sobbing most piteously, and wiping away the froth\nand slaver as it gathered on his lips, which they frequently kissed\nwith a show of great anguish and affection. My uncle approached him\nwith these words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! he's not a-weigh. How fare ye? how fare ye, old\ngentleman? Lord have mercy upon your poor sinful soul!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which,\nthe dying man turned his languid eyes towards us, and Mr. Bowling went\non--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's poor Roy come to see you before you die, and to receive your\nblessing. What, man! don't despair, you have been a great sinner, 'tis\ntrue,--what then? There's a righteous judge above, an't there? He minds\nme no more than a porpoise. Yes, yes, he's a-going; the land crabs\nwill have him, I see that! his anchor's a-peak, i'faith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This homely\nconsolation scandalised the company so much, and especially the parson,\nwho probably thought his province invaded, that we were obliged to\nretire into another room, where, in a few minutes, we were convinced of\nmy grandfather's decease, by a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies\nin his apartment; whither we immediately hastened, and found his heir,\nwho had retired a little before into a closet, under pretence of giving\nvent to his sorrow, asking, with a countenance beslubbered with tears,\nif his grandpapa was certainly dead? \u00e2\u0080\u009cDead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d (says my uncle, looking,\nat the body) \u00e2\u0080\u009cay, ay, I'll warrant him as dead as a herring. Odd's\nfish! now my dream is out for all the world. I thought I stood upon the\nforecastle, and saw a parcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark: that\nfloated alongside, and the devil perching upon our spritsail yard, in\nthe likeness of a blue bear--who, d'ye see jumped overboard upon the\ncarcass and carried it to the bottom in his claws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOut upon thee,\nreprobate\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries the parson \u00e2\u0080\u009cout upon thee, blasphemous wretch! Dost\nthou think his honour's soul is in the possession of Satan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The clamour\nimmediately arose, and my poor uncle, being, shouldered from one corner\nof the room to the other, was obliged to lug out in his own defence, and\nswear he would turn out for no man, till such time as he knew who had\nthe title to send him adrift. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of your tricks upon travellers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmayhap old Bluff has left my kinsman here his heir: if he has,\nit will be the better for his miserable soul. Odds bob! I'd desire no\nbetter news. I'd soon make him a clear shin, I warrant you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To avoid\nany further disturbance, one of my grandfather's executors, who was\npresent, assured Mr. Bowling, that his nephew should have all manner of\njustice; that a day should be appointed after the funeral for examining\nthe papers of the deceased, in presence of all his relations; till which\ntime every desk and cabinet in the house should remain close sealed;\nand that he was very welcome to be witness to this ceremony, which was\nimmediately performed to his satisfaction. In the meantime, orders were\ngiven to provide mourning for all the relations, in which number I was\nincluded; but my uncle would not suffer me to accept of it, until I\nshould be assured whether or no I had reason to honour his memory so\nfar. During this interval, the conjectures of people, with regard to\nthe old gentleman's will, were various: as it was well known, he had,\nbesides his landed estate, which was worth \u00c2\u00a3700 per annum, six or seven\nthousand pounds at interest, some imagined that the whole real estate\n(which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man whom he always\nentertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally divided\nbetween my female cousins (five in number) and me. Others were of\nopinion, that, as the rest of the children had been already provided\nfor, he would only bequeath two or three hundred pounds to each of his\ngranddaughters, and leave the bulk of the sum to me, to atone for his\nunnatural usage of my father. At length the important hour arrived, and\nthe will was produced in the midst of the expectants, whose looks and\ngestures formed a group that would have been very entertaining to\nan unconcerned spectator. But, the reader can scarce conceive the\nastonishment and mortification that appeared, when an attorney\npronounced aloud, the young squire sole heir of all his grandfather's\nestate, personal and real. My uncle, who had listened with great\nattention, sucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied\nthese words of the attorney with a stare, and whew, that alarmed the\nwhole assembly. The eldest and pertest of my female competitors, who had\nbeen always very officious about my grandfather's person, inquired, with\na faltering accent and visage as yellow as an orange, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif there were no\nlegacies?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which she fainted away.\nThe rest, whose expectations, perhaps, were not so sanguine, supported\ntheir disappointment with more resolution, though not without giving\nevident marks of indignation, and grief at least as genuine as that\nwhich appeared in them at the old gentleman's death. My conductor, after\nhaving kicked with his heel for some time against the wainscot,\nbegan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo there's no legacy, friend, ha!--here's an old succubus; but\nsomebody's soul howls for it, d--n me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The parson of the parish, who\nwas one of the executors, and had acted as ghostly director to the\nold man, no sooner heard this exclamation than he cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAvaunt,\nunchristian reviler! avaunt! wilt thou not allow the soul of his honour\nto rest in peace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But this zealous pastor did not find himself so\nwarmly seconded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now joined\nmy uncle against him, and accused him of having acted the part of a\nbusybody with their grandpapa whose ears he had certainly abused by\nfalse stories to their prejudice, or else he would not have neglected\nthem in such an unnatural manner. The young squire was much diverted\nwith this scene, and whispered to my uncle, that if he had not murdered\nhis dogs, he would have shown him glorious fun, by hunting a black\nbadger (so he termed the clergyman). The surly lieutenant, who was not\nin a humour to relish this amusement, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou and your dogs may be\ndamn'd. I suppose you'll find them with your old dad, in the latitude of\nhell. Come, Rory,--about ship, my lad, we must steer another course, I\nthink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And away we went.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Schoolmaster uses me barbarously--I form a Project of Revenge, in\nwhich I am assisted by my Uncle--I leave the Village--am settled at a\nUniversity by his Generosity\n\nOn our way back to the village, my uncle spoke not a word during the\nspace of a whole hour, but whistled with great vehemence the tune of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should we quarrel for riches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc. his visage being contracted all\nthe while into a most formidable frown. At length his pace increased to\nsuch a degree that I was left behind a considerable way: then he waited\nfor me; and when I was almost up with him, called out in a surly tone,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBear a hand, damme! must I bring to every minute for you, you lazy\ndog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, laying hold of me by the arm, hauled me along, until his\ngood nature (of which he had a great share) and reflection getting\nthe better of his he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my boy, don't be cast down,--the old\nrascal is in hell, that's some satisfaction; you shall go to sea with\nme, my lad. A light heart and a thin pair of breeches goes through the\nworld, brave boys, as the song goes--eh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though this proposal did not\nat all suit my inclination, I was afraid of discovering my aversion to\nit, lest I should disoblige the only friend I had in the world; and he\nwas so much a seaman that he never dreamt I could have had any objection\nto his design; consequently gave himself no trouble in consulting my\napprobation. But this resolution was soon dropped, by the device of our\nusher, who assured Mr. Bowling, it would be a thousand pities to balk my\ngenius, which would certainly one day make my fortune on shore, provided\nit received due cultivation. Upon which, this generous tar determined\n(though he could ill afford it) to give me university education; and\naccordingly settled my board and other expenses, at a town not many\nmiles distant, famous for its colleges, whither we repaired in a short\ntime. But, before the day of our departure, the schoolmaster, who no\nlonger had the fear of my grandfather before his eyes, laid aside all\ndecency and restraint, and not only abused me in the grossest language\nhis rancour could suggest, as a wicked, proffigate, dull, beggarly\nmiscreant, whom he had taught out of charity; but also inveighed in the\nmost bitter manner against the memory of the judge (who by the by had\nprocured that settlement for him), hinting, in pretty plain terms, that\nthe old gentleman's soul was damned to all eternity for his injustice in\nneglecting to pay for my learning. This brutal behaviour, added to the\nsufferings I had formerly undergone made me think it high time to be\nrevenged on this insolent pedagogue. Having consulted my adherents, I\nfound them all staunch in their promises to stand by me; and our scheme\nwas this:--In the afternoon preceding to the day of our departure for\nthe University, I resolved to take the advantage of the usher's going\nout to make water (which he regularly did at four o'clock), and shut the\ngreat door, that he might not come to the assistance of his superior.\nThis being done, the assault was to be begun by my advancing to my\nmaster and spitting in his face. I was to be seconded by two of the\nstrongest boys in the school, who were devoted to me; their business was\nto join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench, over which he was to be\nlaid, and his bare posteriors heartily flogged, with his own birch,\nwhich we proposed to wrest from him in his struggle; but if we should\nfind him too many for us all three, we were to demand the assistance of\nour competitors, who should be ready to enforce us, or oppose anything\nthat might be undertaken for the master's relief. One of my principal\nassistants was called Jeremy Gawky, son and heir of a wealthy gentleman\nin the neighbourhood; and the name of the other, Hugh Strap, the cadet\nof a family which had given shoemakers to the village time out of mind.\nI had once saved Gawky's life, by plunging into a river and dragging him\non shore, when he was on the point of being drowned. I had often rescued\nhim from the clutches of those whom his insufferable arrogance had\nprovoked to a resentment he was not able to sustain; and many times\nsaved his reputation and posteriors, by performing his exercises at\nschool; so that it is not to be wondered at, if he had a particular\nregard for me and my interests. The attachment of Strap flowed from a\nvoluntary, disinterested inclination, which had manifested itself on\nmany occasions in my behalf, he having once rendered me the same service\nthat I had rendered Gawky, by saving my life at the risk of his own;\nand often fathered offences that I had committed, for which he suffered\nseverely, rather than I should feel the weight of the punishment.\nThese two champions were the more willing to engage in this enterprise,\nbecause they intended to leave the school next day, as well as I; the\nfirst being ordered by his father to return into the country, and the\nother being bound apprentice to his barber, at a market town not far\noff.\n\nIn the meantime, my uncle, being informed of my master's behaviour to\nme, was enraged at his insolence, and vowed revenge so heartily that I\ncould not refrain from telling him the scheme I had concerted, while\nhe heard with great satisfaction, at every sentence squirting out a\nmouthful of spittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which he constantly\nchewed a large quid. At last, pulling up his breeches, he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\nno, z--ds! that won't do neither; howsoever, 'tis a bold undertaking, my\nlad, that I must say, i'faith; but lookee, lookee, how do you propose\nto get clear off--won't the enemy give chase, my boy?--ay, ay, that he\nwill, I warrant, and alarm the whole coast; ah! God help thee, more sail\nthan ballast, Rory. Let me alone for that--leave the whole to me. I'll\nshow him the foretopsail, I will. If so be your shipmates are jolly\nboys, and won't flinch, you shall see, you shall see; egad, I'll play\nhim such a salt-water trick I'll bring him to the gangway and anoint him\nwith a cat-and-nine-tails; he shall have a round dozen doubled, my lad,\nhe shall--and be left lashed to his meditations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We were very proud of\nour associate, who immediately went to work, and prepared the instrument\nof his revenge with great skill and expedition; after which, he ordered\nour baggage to be packed up and sent off, a day before our attempt, and\ngot horses ready to be mounted, as soon as the affair should be over. At\nlength the hour arrived, when our auxiliary, seizing the opportunity of\nthe usher's absence, bolted in, secured the door, and immediately laid\nhold of the pedant by his collar who bawled out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMurder, Thieves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with\nthe voice of a Stentor. Though I trembled all over like an aspen leaf, I\nknew there was no time to be lost, and accordingly got up, and summoned\nour associates to our assistance. Strap, without any hesitation, obeyed\nthe signal, and seeing me leap upon the master's back, ran immediately\nto one of his legs, which pulling with all his force, this dreadful\nadversary was humbled to the ground; upon which Gawky, who had hitherto\nremained in his place, under the influence of a universal trepidation,\nhastened to the scene of action, and insulted the fallen tyrant with\na loud huzza, in which the whole school joined. The noise alarmed the\nusher, who, finding himself shut out, endeavoured, partly by threats\nand partly by entreaties, to procure admission. My uncle bade him have a\nlittle patience, and he would let him in presently; but if he pretended\nto stir from that place, it should fare the worse with the son of\na bitch his superior, on whom he intended only to bestow a little\nwholesome chastisement, for his barbarous usage of Rory, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto which,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are no stranger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By this time we had dragged the criminal\nto a post, to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on\npurpose; after having secured his hands and stripped his back. In this\nludicrous posture he stood (to the no small entertainment of the boys,\nwho crowded about him, and shouted with great exultation at the novelty\nof the sight), venting bitter imprecations against the lieutenant, and\nreproaching his scholars with treachery and rebellion; when the usher\nwas admitted, whom my uncle accosted in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarkee, Mr.\nSyntax, I believe you are an honest man, d'ye see--and I have a respect\nfor you--but for all that, we must, for our own security, d'ye see,\nbelay you for a short time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words, he pulled out some\nfathoms of cord, which the honest man no sooner saw than he protested\nwith great earnestness he would allow no violence to be offered to him,\nat the same time accusing me of perfidy and ingratitude. But Bowling\nrepresenting that it was in vain to resist, and that he did not mean to\nuse him with violence and indecency, but only to hinder him from raising\nthe hue and cry against us before we should be out of their power, he\nallowed himself to be bound to his own desk, where he sat a spectator\nof the punishment inflicted on his principal. My uncle, having upbraided\nthis arbitrary wretch with his inhumanity to me, told him, that he\nproposed to give him a little discipline for the good of his soul, which\nhe immediately put in practice, with great vigour and dexterity. This\nsmart application to the pedant's withered posteriors gave him such\nexquisite pain that he roared like a mad bull, danced, cursed, and\nblasphemed, like a frantic bedlamite. When the lieutenant thought\nhimself sufficiently revenged, he took his leave of him in these words:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, friend, you'll remember me the longest day you have to live; I\nhave given you a lesson that will let you know what flogging is, and\nteach you to have more sympathy for the future. Shout, boys, shout!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis ceremony was no sooner over than my uncle proposed they should quit\nthe school, and convey their old comrade Rory to the public-house, about\na mile from the village, where he would treat them all. His offer being\njoyfully embraced, he addressed himself to Mr. Syntax, and begged him to\naccompany us; but this invitation he refused with great disdain, telling\nmy benefactor he was not the man he took him to be. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, old\nsurly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied my uncle, shaking his hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art an honest fellow\nnotwithstanding; and if ever I have the command of a ship, thou shalt be\nour schoolmaster, i'faith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying he dismissed the boys, and locking\nthe door, left the two preceptors to console one another; while we moved\nforwards on our journey, attended by a numerous retinue, whom he treated\naccording to his promise.\n\nWe parted with many tears, and lay that night at an inn on the road,\nabout ten miles short of the town where I was to remain, at which\nwe arrived next day, and I found I had no cause to complain of the\naccommodations provided for me, in being boarded at the house of an\napothecary, who had married a distant relation of my mother. In a few\ndays after, my uncle set out for his ship, having settled the necessary\nfunds for my maintenance and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nI make great progress in my Studies--am caressed by Everybody--my female\nCousins take notice of me--I reject their Invitation--they are incensed,\nand conspire against me--am left destitute by a Misfortune that befalls\nmy Uncle-Gawky's Treachery--my Revenge\n\nAs I was now capable of reflection, I began to consider my precarious\nsituation; that I was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it was to\nprotect me: and that my sole dependence was on the generosity of one\nman, who was not only exposed by his profession to continual dangers,\nwhich might one day deprive me of him for ever; but also (no doubt)\nsubject to those vicissitudes of disposition which a change of fortune\nusually creates, or which a better acquaintance with the world might\nproduce; for I always ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a\nheart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind. Alarmed at these\nconsiderations, I resolved to apply myself with great care to my\nstudies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power: this I did with such\nsuccess that, in the space of three years, I understood Greek very well,\nwas pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no stranger to moral and\nnatural philosophy: logic I made no account of; but, above all things,\nI valued myself on my taste in the belles lettres, and a talent for\npoetry, which had already produced some pieces that had met with a\nfavourable reception. These qualifications, added to a good face and\nshape, acquired the esteem and acquaintance of the most considerable\npeople in town, and I had the satisfaction to find myself in some degree\nof favour with the ladies; an intoxicating piece of good fortune to one\nof my amorous complexion! which I obtained, or at least preserved, by\ngratifying their propensity to scandal, in lampooning their rivals.\n\nTwo of my female cousins lived in this place, with their mother, since\nthe death of their father, who left his whole fortune equally divided\nbetween them; so that, if they were not the most beautiful, they were\nat least the richest toasts in town; and received daily the addresses of\nall the beaux and cavaliers of the country. Although I had hitherto been\nlooked upon by them with the most supercilious contempt, my character\nnow attracted their notice so much that I was given to understand I\nmight be honoured with their acquaintance, if I pleased.\n\nThe reader will easily perceive that this condescension either flowed\nfrom the hope of making my poetical capacity subservient to their\nmalice, or at least of screening themselves from the lash of my\nresentment, which they had effectually provoked. I enjoyed this triumph\nwith great satisfaction, and not only rejected their offer with disdain,\nbut in all my performances, whether satire or panegyric, industriously\navoided mentioning their names, even while I celebrated those of their\nintimates: this neglect mortified their pride exceedingly and incensed\nthem to such a degree that they were resolved to make me repent of\nmy indifference. The first stroke of their revenge consisted in their\nhiring a poor collegian to write verses against me, the subject of which\nwas my own poverty, and the catastrophe of my unhappy parents; but,\nbesides the badness of the composition (of which they themselves were\nashamed), they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me\nwith those misfortunes which they and their relations had brought upon\nme; and which consequently reflected much more dishonour on themselves\nthan on me, who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice.\n\nFinding this plan miscarry, they found means to irritate a young\ngentleman against me, by telling him I had lampooned his mistress;\nand so effectually succeeded in the quality of incendiaries that this\nenraged lover determined to seize me next night as I returned to my\nlodgings from a friend's house that I frequented: with this view, he\nwaited in the street, attended by two of his companions, to whom he had\nimparted his design of carrying me down to the river, in which proposed\nto have me heartily ducked, notwithstanding the severity of the weather,\nit being then about the middle of December. But this stratagem did not\nsucceed; for, being apprised of their ambush, I got home another way,\nand by the help of my landlord's apprentice, discharged a volley from\nthe garret window, which did great execution upon them, and next day\noccasioned so much mirth at their expense that they found themselves\nunder a necessity of leaving the town, until the adventure should be\nentirely forgotten.\n\nMy cousins (though twice baffled in their expectation) did not,\nhowever, desist from persecuting me, who had now enraged them beyond a\npossibility of forgiveness by detecting their malice and preventing its\neffects: neither should I have found them more humane, had I patiently\nsubmitted to their rancour, and borne without murmuring the rigour of\ntheir unreasonable hate; for I have found by experience, that though\nsmall favours may be acknowledged and slight injuries atoned, there is\nno wretch so ungrateful as he whom you have most generously obliged, and\nno enemy so implacable as those who have done you the greatest wrong.\nThese good-natured creatures, therefore, had recourse to a scheme which\nconspired with a piece of bad news I soon after received, to give them\nall the satisfaction they desired: this plan was to debauch the faith of\nmy companion and confidant, who betrayed the trust I reposed in him,\nby imparting to them the particulars of my small amours, which they\npublished with such exaggerations that I suffered very much in the\nopinion of everybody, and was utterly discarded by the dear creatures\nwhose names had been called in question.\n\nWhile I was busy in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I\nmight not only be revenged on him, but also vindicate my character to my\nfriends, I one day perceived the looks of my landlady much altered, when\nI went home to my dinner, and inquiring into the cause, she screwed up\nher mouth, and fixed her eyes on the ground, told me her husband had\nreceived a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one inclosed for me. She was\nvery sorry for what had happened, both for my sake and his own--people\nshould be more cautious of their conduct--she was always afraid his\nbrutal behaviour would bring him into some misfortune or other. As for\nher part, she should be very ready to befriend me; but she had a small\nfamily of her own to maintain. The world would do nothing for her if she\nshould come to want--charity begins at home: she wished I had been bound\nto some substantial handicraft, such as a weaver or a shoemaker, rather\nthan loiter away my time in learning foolish nonsense, that would never\nbring me in a penny but some folks are wise, and some are otherwise.\n\nI was listening to this mysterious discourse with great amazement, when\nher husband entered, and, without speaking a syllable, put both the\nletters into my hand. I received them trembling, and read what follows:\n\n\n'To Mr. Roger Potion 'Sir, 'This is to let you know that I have quitted\nthe Thunder man of war, being obliged to sheer off for killing my\ncaptain, which I did fairly on the beach, at Cape Tiberoon, in the\nIsland of Hispaniola; having received his fire and returned it, which\nwent through his body: and I would serve the best man so that ever\nstepped between stem and stern, if so be that he struck me, as Captain\nOakum did. I am (thank God) safe among the French, who are very civil,\nthough I don't understand their lingo; and I hope to be restored in a\nlittle time, for all the great friends and parliamentary interest of the\ncaptain, for I have sent over to my landlord in Deal an account of the\nwhole affair, with our bearings and distances while we were engaged,\nwhereby I have desired him to lay it before his majesty, who (God\nbless him) will not suffer an honest tar to be wronged. My love to your\nspouse, and am your loving friend and servant to command, while 'Thomas\nBowling,'\n\n\n'To Roderick Random\n\n'Dear Rory, 'Don't be grieved at my misfortune, but mind your book, my\nlad. I have got no money to send you, but what of that? Mr. Potion\nwill take care of you for the love he bears to me, and let you want for\nnothing; and it shall go hard but I will see him one day repaid. No\nmore at present, but rests 'Your dutiful uncle 'and servant, till death,\n'Thomas Bowling.'\n\nThis letter (which, with the other, was dated from Port Lonis, in\nHispaniola) I had no sooner read than the apothecary, shaking his head,\nbegan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a very great regard for Mr. Bowling that's certain; and\ncould be well content--but times are very hard. There's no such thing as\nmoney to be got; I believe 'tis all vanished under ground, for my part.\nBesides, I have been out of pocket already, having entertained you since\nthe beginning of this month, without receiving a sixpence, and God knows\nif ever I shall; for I believe it will go hard with your uncle. And\nmore than that, I was thinking of giving you warning, for I want your\napartment for a new prentice, whom I expect from the country every hour.\nSo I desire you will this week provide yourself with another lodging.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe indignation which this harangue inspired gave me spirits to support\nmy reverse of fortune, and to tell him I despised his mean selfish\ndisposition so much that I would rather starve than be beholden to him\nfor one single meal. Upon which, out of my pocket money, I paid him to\nthe last farthing of what I owed, and assured him, I would not sleep\nanother night under his roof.\n\nThis said, I sallied out in a transport of rage and sorrow, without\nknowing whither to fly for shelter, having not one friend in the world\ncapable of relieving me, and only three shillings in my purse. After\ngiving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and\nhired a small bedroom, at the rate of one shilling and sixpence per\nweek, which I was obliged to pay per advance, before the landlord would\nreceive me: thither I removed my luggage; and next morning got up, with\na view of craving the advice and assistance of a person who had on\nall occasions loaded me with caresses and made frequent offers of\nfriendship, while I was under no necessity of accepting them. He\nreceived me with his wonted affability, and insisted on my breakfasting\nwith him, a favour which I did not think fit to refuse. But when I\ncommunicated the occasion of my visit, he appeared so disconcerted that\nI concluded him wonderfully affected with the misery of my condition and\nlooked upon him as a man of the most extensive sympathy and benevolence.\nHe did not leave me long under this mistake; for, recovering himself\nfrom his confusion, he told me he was grieved at my misfortune, and\ndesired to know what had passed between my landlord, Mr. Potion, and me.\nWhereupon I recounted the conversation; and, when I repeated the answer\nI made to his ungenerous remonstrance with regard to my leaving his\nhouse, this pretended friend affected a stare, and exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it\npossible you could behave so ill to the man who had treated you so\nkindly all along?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMy surprise at hearing this was not at all affected, whatever his might\nbe; and I gave to understand with some warmth, that I did not imagine he\nwould so unreasonably espouse the cause of a scoundrel who ought to be\nexpelled from every social community. This heat of mine gave him all the\nadvantage he desired over me, and our discourse, after much altercation,\nconcluded in his desiring never to see me again in that place; to which\ndesire I yielded my consent, assuring him, that, had I been as well\nacquainted with his principles formerly as I was now, he never should\nhave had an opportunity of making that request. And thus we parted.\n\nOn my return, I met my comrade, Squire Gawky, whom his father had\nsent, some time ago, to town, for his improvement in writing, dancing,\nfencing, and other modish qualifications. As I had lived with him since\nhis arrival on the footing of our old intimacy, I made no scruple of\ninforming him of the lowness of my circumstances, and asking a small\nsupply of money, to answer my present expense; upon which he pulled out\na handful of halfpence with a shilling or two among them, and swore that\nwas all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter-day he having lost\nthe greatest part of his allowance the night before at billiards. Though\nthis assertion might very well be true, I was extremely mortified at his\nindifference: for he neither expressed any sympathy for my mishap nor\ndesire of alleviating my distress; and accordingly I left him without\nuttering one word: but, when I afterwards understood that he was the\nperson who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cousins, to\nwhom likewise he had carried the tidings of my forlorn situation, which\nafforded them great matter of triumph and exultation, I determined with\nmyself to call him to a severe account for which purpose I borrowed a\nsword, and wrote a challenge, desiring him to meet me at a certain time\nand place, that I might have an opportunity of punishing his perfidy,\nat the expense of his blood. He accepted the invitation, and I betook\nmyself to the field, though not without feeling considerable repugnance\nto the combat, which frequently attacked me in cold sweats by the\nway; but the desire of revenge, the shame of retracting, and hope of\nconquest, conspired to repel these unmanly symptoms of fear; and I\nappeared on the plain with a good grace: there I waited an hour beyond\nthe time appointed, and was not ill pleased to find he had no mind to\nmeet me, because I should have an opportunity of exposing his cowardice,\ndisplaying my own courage, and of beating him soundly wheresoever I\nshould find, without any dread of the consequence.\n\nElevated with these suggestions, which entirely banished all thoughts\nof my deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawky's lodgings, where\nI was informed of his precipitate retreat, he having set out for the\ncountry in less than an hour after he had received my billet; and I was\nvain enough to have the whole story inserted in the news, although I was\nfain to sell a gold laced hat to my landlord for less than half-price,\nto defray the expenses and contribute to my subsistence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nI am entertained by Mr. Crab--a description of him--I acquire the Art\nof Surgery--consult Crab's Disposition--become necessary to him--an\nAccident happens--he advises me to launch out into the world--assists me\nwith Money--I set out for London\n\nThe fumes of my resentment being dissipated, as well as the vanity of my\nsuccess, I found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme want, and\navoided by mankind as a creature of a different species, or rather as a\nsolitary being, noways comprehended within the scheme or protection of\nProvidence. My despair had rendered me almost quite stupified, when\nI was one day told, that a gentleman desired to see me at a certain\npublic-house, whither immediately I repaired; and was introduced to one\nMr. Launcelot Crab, a surgeon in town, who was engaged with two more in\ndrinking a liquor called pop-in, composed by mixing a quartern of\nbrandy with a quart of small beer. Before I relate the occasion of\nthis message, I believe it will not be disagreeable to the reader, if I\ndescribe the gentleman who sent for me, and mention some circumstances\nof his character and conduct which may illustrate what follows, and\naccount for his behaviour to me.\n\nThis member of the faculty was aged fifty, about five feet high, and ten\nround the belly; his face was as capacious as a full moon, and much of\nthe complexion of a mulberry: his nose, resembling a powder-horn, was\nswelled to an enormous size, and studded all over with carbuncles; and\nhis little gray eyes reflected the rays in such an oblique manner that,\nwhile he looked a person full in the face, one would have imagined\nhe was admiring the buckle of his shoe. He had long entertained\nan implacable resentment against Potion, who, though a younger\npractitioner, was better employed than he, and once had the assurance to\nperform a cure, whereby he disappointed and disgraced the prognostic\nof the said Crab. This quarrel which was at one time upon the point of\nbeing made up, by the interposition and mediation of friends, had been\nlately inflamed beyond a possibility of reconciliation by the respective\nwives of the opponents, who, chancing to meet at a christening,\ndisagreed about precedence, proceeded from invectives to blows, and were\nwith great difficulty, by the gossips, prevented from converting the\noccasion of joy into a scene of lamentation.\n\nThe difference between these rivals was in the height of rancour, when I\nreceived the message of Crab, who received me as civilly as I could have\nexpected from one of his disposition; and, after desiring me to sit,\ninquired into the particulars of my leaving the house of Potion; which\nwhen I had related, he said, with a malicious grin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's a sneaking\ndog! I always thought him a fellow without a soul, d--n me, a canting\nscoundrel, who has crept into business by his hypocrisy, and kissing the\na--e of every body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says another, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone might see with half\nan eye that the rascal has no honesty in him, by his going so regularly\nto church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis sentence was confirmed by a third, who assured his companions that\nPotion was never known to be disguised in liquor but once, at a meeting\nof the godly, where he had distinguished himself by an extempore prayer\nan hour long. After this preamble, Crab addressed himself to me in these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my lad, I have heard a good character of you, and I'll do\nfor you. You may send your things to my house when you please. I have\ngiven orders for your reception. Zounds! What does the booby stare at?\nIf you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer, you may let it alone,\nand be d--d.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered with a submissive bow, that I was far from\nrejecting his friendly offer, which I would immediately accept, as soon\nas he should inform me on what footing I was to be entertained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nfooting! D--n my blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd'ye expect to have a footman and a\ncouple of horses kept for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy expectations\nare not quite so sanguine. That I may be as little burthensome as\npossible, I would willingly serve in your shop, by which means I\nmay save you the expense of a journeyman, or porter at least, for I\nunderstand a little pharmacy, having employed some of my leisure hours\nin the practice of that art, while I lived with Mr. Potion; neither am I\naltogether ignorant of surgery, which I have studied with great pleasure\nand application.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOho! you did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Crab. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, here is a\ncomplete artist! Studied surgery! What? in books, I suppose. I shall\nhave you disputing with me one of these days on points of my profession.\nYou can already account for muscular motion, I warrant, and explain the\nmystery of the brain and nerves--ha! You are too learned for me, d--n\nme. But let's have no more of this stuff. Can you blood and give a\nclyster, spread a plaster, and prepare a potion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon my answering in\nthe affirmative, he shock his head, telling me, he believed he should\nhave little good of me, for all my promises; but, however, he would\ntake me in for the sake of charity. I was accordingly that very night\nadmitted to his house, and had an apartment assigned to me in\nthe garret, which I was fain to put up with, notwithstanding the\nmortification my pride suffered in this change of circumstances.\n\nI was soon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive\nme in this manner; for, besides the gratification of his revenge, by\nexposing the selfishness of his antagonist, in opposition to his own\ngenerosity, which was all affectation, he had occasion for a young man\nwho understood something of the profession, to fill up the place of his\neldest apprentice, lately dead, not without violent suspicion of foul\nplay from his master's brutality. The knowledge of this circumstance,\ntogether with his daily behaviour to his wife and the young apprentice,\ndid not at all contribute to my enjoying my new situation with ease;\nhowever, as I did not perceive how I could bestow myself to better\nadvantage, I resolved to study Crab's temper with all the application,\nand manage it with all the address in my power. And it was not long\nbefore I found out a strange peculiarity of humour which governed his\nbehaviour towards all his dependents. I observed, when he was pleased,\nhe was such a niggard of his satisfaction that, if his wife or servants\nbetrayed the least symptom of participation, he was offended to an\ninsupportable degree of choler and fury, the effects of which they\nseldom failed to feel. And when his indignation was roused, submission\nand soothing always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason and\nhumanity. I therefore pursued a contrary plan; and one day, when he\nhonoured me with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffin, I\nboldly replied, I was neither ignorant nor lazy, since I both understood\nand performed my business as well as he could do for his soul; neither\nwas it just to call me ragamuffin, for I had a whole coat on my back,\nand was descended from a better family than any he could boast an\nalliance with.\n\nHe gave tokens of great amazement at this assurance of mine, and shook\nhis cane over my head, regarding me all the time with a countenance\ntruly diabolical. Although I was terribly startled at his menacing looks\nand posture, I yet had reflection enough left to convince me I had gone\ntoo far to retract, and that this was the critical minute which must\ndecide my future lot in his service; I therefore snatched up the pestle\nof a mortar, and swore, if he offered to strike me without a cause, I\nshould see whether his skull or my weapon was hardest.\n\nHe continued silent for some time, and at last broke forth into these\nejaculations: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is fine usage from a servant to his master--very\nfine! damnation! but no matter, you shall pay for this, you dog, you\nshall; I'll do your business--yes, yes, I'll teach you to lift your\nhand against me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he retired, and left me under dreadful\napprehensions, which vanished entirely at our next meeting, when he\nbehaved with unusual complacency, and treated me with a glass of punch\nafter dinner.\n\nBy this conduct I got the ascendancy over him in a short time, and\nbecame so necessary to him, in managing his business while he was\nengaged at the bottle, that fortune began to wear a kinder aspect; and\nI consoled myself for the disregard of my former acquaintance, with the\nknowledge I daily imbibed by a close application to the duties of my\nemployment, in which I succeeded beyond my own expectation. I was on\nvery good terms with my master's wife, whose esteem I acquired and\ncultivated, by representing Mrs. Potion in the most ridiculous lights\nmy satirical talents could invent, as well as by rendering her some\nChristian offices, when she had been too familiar with the dram\nbottle, to which she had oftentimes recourse for consolation, under the\naffliction she suffered from a barbarous husband.\n\nIn this manner I lived, without hearing the least tidings of my uncle\nfor the space of two years, during which time I kept little or no\ncompany, being neither in a humour to relish nor in a capacity to\nmaintain much acquaintance; for the Nabal my master allowed me no wages,\nand the small perquisites of my station scarcely supplied me with the\ncommon necessaries of life. I was no longer a pert unthinking coxcomb,\ngiddy with popular applause, and elevated with the extravagance of\nhope: my misfortunes had taught me how little the caresses of the world,\nduring a man's prosperity, are to be valued by him; and how seriously\nand expeditiously he ought to set about making himself independent of\nthem. My present appearance, therefore, was the least of my care, which\nwas wholly engrossed in laying up a stock of instruction that might\nsecure me against the caprice of fortune for the future. I became such\na sloven, and contracted such an air of austerity, that everybody\npronounced me crestfallen; and Gawky returned to town without running\nany risk from my resentment, which was by this time pretty much cooled,\nand restrained by prudential reasons so effectually that I never so much\nas thought of obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had done me.\n\nWhen I deemed myself sufficiently master of my business I began to cast\nabout for an opportunity of launching into the world, in hope of\nfinding some provision that might make amends for the difficulties I\nhad undergone; but, as this could not be effected without a small sum of\nmoney to equip me for the field, I was in the utmost perplexity how to\nraise it, well knowing that Crab, for his own sake, would never put me\nin a condition to leave him, when his interest was so much concerned\nin my stay. But a small accident, which happened about this time,\ndetermined him in my favour. This was no other than the pregnancy of his\nmaidservant, who declared her situation to me, assuring me at the same\ntime that I was the occasion of it.\n\nAlthough I had no reason to question the truth of this imputation, I was\nnot ignorant of the familiarities which had passed between her master\nand her, taking the advantage of which I represented to her the folly\nof laying the burden at my door, when she might dispose of it to much\nbetter purpose with Mr. Crab. She listened to my advice, and next day\nacquainted him with the pretended success of their mutual endeavours.\nHe was far from being overjoyed at this proof of his vigour, which he\nforesaw might have very troublesome consequences; not that he dreaded\nany domestic grumblings and reproaches from his wife, whom he kept\nin perfect subjection; but because he knew it would furnish his rival\nPotion with a handle for insulting and undermining his reputation, there\nbeing no scandal equal to that of uncleanness, in the opinion of those\nwho inhabit the part of the island where he lived. He therefore took a\nresolution worthy of himself, which was, to persuade the girl that she\nwas not with child, but only afflicted with a disorder incidental\nto young women, which he could easily remove: with this view (as he\npretended) he prescribed for her such medicines as he thought would\ninfallibly procure abortion; but in this scheme he was disappointed,\nfor the maid, being advertised by me of his design, and at the same time\nwell acquainted with her own condition, absolutely refused to follow his\ndirections; and threatened to publish her situation to the world if he\nwould not immediately take some method of providing for the important\noccasion, which she expected in a few months. It was not long before I\nguessed the result of his deliberation, by his addressing himself to\nme one day in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am surprised that a young fellow like you\ndiscovers no inclination to push his fortune in the world. Before I\nwas of your age I was broiling on the coast of Guinea. D--e! what's to\nhinder you from profiting by the war which will certainly be declared in\na short time against Spain? You may easily get on board of a king's ship\nin quality of surgeon's mate, where you will certainly see a great deal\nof practice, and stand a good chance of getting prize-money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI laid hold of this declaration, which I had long wished for, and\nassured him I would follow his advice with pleasure, if it were in my\npower; but that it was impossible for me to embrace an opportunity of\nthat kind, as I had no friend to advance a little money to supply me\nwith what necessaries I should want, and defray the expenses of my\njourney to London. He told me that few necessaries were required; and,\nas for the expense of my journey, he would lend me money, sufficient\nnot only for that purpose, but also to maintain me comfortably in London\nuntil I should procure a warrant for my provision on board of some ship.\n\nI gave him a thousand thanks for his obliging offer (although I was very\nwell apprised of his motive, which was no other than a design to lay the\nbastard to my charge after my departure), and accordingly set out in\na few weeks for London; my whole fortune consisting of one suit of\nclothes, half a dozen ruffled shirts, as many plain, two pair of worsted\nand a like number of threaded stockings; a case of pocket instruments, a\nsmall edition of Horace, Wiseman's Surgery, and ten guineas in cash;\nfor which Crab took my bond, bearing five per cent interest; at the same\ntime giving me a letter to a member of parliament for our town, which he\nsaid would do my business effectually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nI arrive at Newcastle--meet with my old Schoolfellow Strap--we determine\nto walk together to London--set out on our Journey--put up at a solitary\nAlehouse--are disturbed by a strange Adventure in the Night\n\nThere is no such convenience as a waggon in this country, and my\nfinances were too weak to support the expense of hiring a horse: I\ndetermined therefore to set out with the carriers, who transport goods\nfrom one place to another on horseback; and this scheme I accordingly\nput in execution on the 1st day of September, 1739, sitting upon a\npack-saddle between two baskets, one of which contained my goods in a\nknapsack. But by the time we arrived at Newcastle-upon-Tyne I was so\nfatigued with the tediousness of the carriage, and benumbed with the\ncoldness of the weather, that I resolved to travel the rest of my\njourney on foot, rather than proceed in such a disagreeable manner.\n\nThe ostler of the inn at which we put up, understanding I was bound for\nLondon, advised me to take my passage in a collier which would be both\ncheap and expeditious and withal much easier than to walk upwards of\nthree hundred miles through deep roads in the winter time, a journey\nwhich he believed I had not strength enough to perform. I was almost\npersuaded to take his advice, when one day, stepping into a barber's\nshop to be shaved, the young man, while he lathered my face, accosted\nme thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I presume you are a Scotchman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered in the\naffirmative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom what part of Scotland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I no\nsooner told him, than he discovered great emotion, and not confining his\noperation to my chin and upper lip, besmeared my whole face with great\nagitation. I was so offended at this profusion that starting up, I asked\nhim what the d--l he meant by using me so? He begged pardon, telling me\nhis joy at meeting with a countryman had occasioned some confusion in\nhim, and craved my name. But, when I declared my name was Random, he\nexclaimed in rapture, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow! Rory Random?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, looking\nat him with astonishment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't you know your old\nschoolfellow, Hugh Strap?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that instant recollecting his face, I flew into his arms, and in\nthe transport of my joy, gave him back one-half of the suds he had so\nlavishly bestowed on my countenance; so that we made a very ludicrous\nappearance, and furnished a great deal of mirth for his master and\nshopmates, who were witnesses of this scene. When our mutual caresses\nwere over I sat down again to be shaved, but the poor fellow's nerves\nwere so discomposed by this unexpected meeting that his hand could\nscarcely hold the razor, with which, nevertheless, he found means to\ncut me in three places in as many strokes. His master, perceiving his\ndisorder, bade another supply his place, and after the operation was\nperformed, gave Strap leave to pass the rest of the day with me.\n\nWe retired immediately to my lodgings, where, calling for some beer, I\ndesired to be informed of his adventures, which contained nothing more\nthan that his master dying before his time was out, he had come to\nNewcastle about a year ago, in expectation of journeywork, along with\nthree young fellows of his acquaintance who worked in the keels; that he\nhad the good fortune of being employed by a very civil master, with whom\nhe intended to stay till the spring, at which time he proposed to go\nto London, where he did not doubt of finding encouragement. When I\ncommunicated to him my situation and design, he did not approve of my\ntaking a passage by sea, by reason of the danger of a winter voyage,\nwhich is very hazardous along that coast, as well as the precariousness\nof the wind, which might possibly detain me a great while, to the no\nsmall detriment of my fortune; whereas, if I would venture by land, he\nwould bear me company, carry my baggage all the way, and if we should be\nfatigued before we could perform the journey it would be no hard matter\nfor us to find on the road either return horses or waggons, of which we\nmight take the advantage for a very trifling expense.\n\nI was so ravished at this proposal that I embraced him affectionately,\nand assured him he might command my purse to the last farthing; but he\ngave me to understand he had saved money sufficient to answer his own\noccasions; and that he had a friend in London who would soon introduce\nhim into business in that capital, and possibly have it in his power to\nserve me also.\n\nHaving concerted the plan and settled our affairs that night, we\ndeparted next morning by daybreak, armed with a good cudgel each (my\ncompanion being charged with the furniture of us both crammed into one\nknapsack), and our money sewed between the linings and waistbands of\nour breeches, except some loose silver for our immediate expenses on the\nroad, We travelled all day at a round pace, but, being ignorant of the\nproper stages, were benighted at a good distance from any inn, so that\nwe were compelled to take up our lodging at a small hedge alehouse, that\nstood on a byroad, about half-a-mile from the highway: there we found\na pedlar of our own country, in whose company we regaled ourselves with\nbacon and eggs, and a glass of good ale, before a comfortable fire,\nconversing all the while very sociably with the landlord and his\ndaughter, a hale buxom lass, who entertained us with great good humour,\nand in whose affection I was vain enough to believe I had made some\nprogress. About eight o'clock we were all three, at our own desire,\nshown into an apartment furnished with two beds, in one of which Strap\nand I betook ourselves to rest, and the pedlar occupied the other,\nthough not before he had prayed a considerable time extempore, searched\ninto every corner of the room, and fastened the door on the inside with\na strong iron screw, which he carried about with him for that use.\n\nI slept very sound till midnight when I was disturbed by a violent\nmotion of the bed, which shook under me with a continual tremor.\nAlarmed at this phenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom, to my no small\namazement, I found drenched in sweat, and quaking through every limb; he\ntold me, with a low faltering voice, that we were undone; for there\nwas a bloody highwayman, loaded with pistols, in the next room; then,\nbidding me make as little noise as possible, he directed me to a small\nchink in the board partition through which I could see a thick-set\nbrawny fellow, with a fierce countenance, sitting at a table with our\nyoung landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of pistols before\nhim.\n\nI listened with great attention, and heard him say, in a terrible tone,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n that son of a b--h, Smack the coachman; he has served me a fine\ntrick, indeed! but d--ion seize me, if I don't make him repent it! I'll\nteach the scoundrel to give intelligence to others while he is under\narticles with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur landlady endeavoured to appease this exasperated robber, by saying\nhe might be mistaken in Smack, who perhaps kept no correspondence with\nthe other gentleman that robbed his coach; and that, if an accident\nhad disappointed him to-day, he might soon find opportunities enough to\natone for his lost trouble. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell thee what, my dear Bet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never had, nor ever shall, while my name is Rifle, have such\na glorious booty as I missed to-day. Z--s! there was \u00c2\u00a3400 in cash to\nrecruit men for the king's service, besides the jewels, watches, swords,\nand money belonging to the passengers. Had it been my fortune to have\ngot clear off with so much treasure, I would have purchased a commission\nin the army, and made you an officer's lady, you jade, I would.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nwell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Betty, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must trust to Providence for that. But did\nyou find nothing worth taking which escaped the other gentlemen of the\nroad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot much, faith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lover; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gleaned a few things, such\nas a pair of pops, silver mounted (here they are): I took them loaded\nfrom the captain who had the charge of the money, together with a gold\nwatch which he had concealed in his breeches. I likewise found ten\nPortugal pieces in the shoes of a quaker, whom the spirit moved to\nrevile me with great bitterness and devotion; but what I value myself\nmostly for is, this here purchase, a gold snuffbox, my girl, with a\npicture on the inside of the lid; which I untied out of the tail of a\npretty lady's smock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere, as the devil would have it, the pedlar snored so loud, that the\nhighwayman, snatching his pistols, started up, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHell and d-n-n!\nI am betrayed! Who's that in the next room?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Betty told him he need\nnot be uneasy: there were only three poor travellers, who, missing the\nroad, had taken up their lodgings in the house, and were asleep long\nago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTravellers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspies, you b--ch! But no matter; I'll send\nthem all to hell in an instant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He accordingly ran towards our door;\nwhen his sweetheart interposing, assured him, there was only a couple\nof poor young Scotchmen, who were too raw and ignorant to give him the\nleast cause of suspicion; and the third was a presbyterian pedlar of the\nsame nation, who had often lodged in the house before.\n\nThis declaration satisfied the thief, who swore he was glad there was a\npedlar, for he wanted some linen. Then, in a jovial manner, he put\nabout the glass, mingling his discourse to Betty with caresses and\nfamiliarities, that spoke him very happy in his amours. During that part\nof the conversation which regarded this, Strap had crept under the\nbed, where he lay in the agonies of fear; so that it was with great\ndifficulty I persuaded him our danger was over, and prevailed on him to\nawake the pedlar, and inform him of what he had seen and heard.\n\nThe itinerant merchant no sooner felt somebody shaking him by the\nshoulder, than he started up, called, as loud as he could, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThieves,\nthieves! Lord have mercy upon us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Rifle, alarmed at this\nexclamation, jumped up, cocked one of his pistols, and turned towards\nthe door to kill the first man that should enter; for he verily believed\nhimself beset: when his Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of laughter,\npersuaded him that the poor pedlar, dreaming of thieves, had only cried\nout in his sleep.\n\nMeanwhile, my comrade had undeceived our fellow-lodger, and informed\nhim of his reason for disturbing him; upon which, getting up softly, he\npeeped through the hole, and was so terrified with what he saw, that,\nfalling down on his bare knees, he put up a long petition to Heaven\nto deliver him from the hands of that ruffian, and promised never\nto defraud a customer for the future of the value of a pin's point,\nprovided he might be rescued from the present danger. Whether or not his\ndisburthening his conscience afforded him any ease I knew not, but he\nslipped into bed again, and lay very quiet until the robber and his\nmistress were asleep, and snored in concert; then, rising softly, he\nuntied a rope that was round his pack, which making fast to one end of\nit, he opened the window with as little noise as possible, and lowered\nhis goods into the yard with great dexterity: then he moved gently to\nour bedside and bade us farewell, telling us that, as we ran no risk we\nmight take our rest with great confidence, and in the morning assure the\nlandlord that we knew nothing of his escape, and, lastly, shaking us\nby the hands, and wishing us all manner of success, he let himself drop\nfrom the window without any danger, for the ground was not above a yard\nfrom his feet as he hung on the outside.\n\nAlthough I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight, I was\nnot at all free from apprehension when I reflected on what might be the\neffect of the highwayman's disappointment; as he certainly intended to\nmake free with the pedlar's ware. Neither was my companion at more ease\nin his mind, but on the contrary, so possessed with the dreadful idea of\nRifle, that he solicited me strongly to follow our countryman's example,\nand so elude the fatal resentment of that terrible adventurer, who\nwould certainly wreak his vengeance on us as accomplices of the pedlar's\nelopement. But I represented to him the danger of giving Rifle cause to\nthink we know his profession, and suggested that, if ever he should meet\nus again on the road, he would look upon us as dangerous acquaintance,\nand find it his interest to put us out of the way. I told him, withal,\nmy confidence in Betty's good nature, in which he acquiesced; and\nduring the remaining part of the night we concerted a proper method of\nbehaviour, to render us unsuspected in the morning.\n\nIt was no sooner day than Betty, entering our chamber, and perceiving\nour window open, cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds-bobs! sure you Scotchmen must have\nhot constitutions to lie all night with the window open in such cold\nweather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I feigned to start out of sleep, and, withdrawing the curtain,\ncalled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d When she showed me, I affected surprise,\nand said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBless me! the window was shut when we went to bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll be\nhanged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif Sawney Waddle, the pedlar, has not got up in a\ndream and done it, for I heard him very obstropulous in his sleep, Sure\nI put a chamberpot under his bed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words she advanced to the bed, in which he lay, and, finding\nthe sheets cold, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lackadaisy! The rogue is fled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cFled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, with feigned amazement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid! Sure he has not\nrobbed us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, springing up, I laid hold of my breeches, and emptied\nall my loose money into my hand; which having reckoned, I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven\nbe praised, our money is all safe! Strap, look to the knapsack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did\nso, and found all was right. Upon which we asked, with seeming concern,\nif he had stolen nothing belonging to the house. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009che has stole nothing but his reckoning;\u00e2\u0080\u009d which, it seems, this pious\npedlar had forgot to discharge in the midst of his devotion.\n\nBetty, after a moment's pause withdrew, and immediately we could hear\nher waken Rifle, who no sooner heard of Waddle's flight than he jumped\nout of bed and dressed, venting a thousand execrations, and vowing to\nmurder the pedlar if ever he should set eyes on him again: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe scoundrel has by this time raised the hue and cry against me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving dressed himself in a hurry, he mounted his horse, and for\nthat time rid us of his company and a thousand fears that were the\nconsequence of it.\n\nWhile we were at breakfast, Betty endeavoured, by all the cunning she\nwas mistress of, to learn whether or no we suspected our fellow-lodger,\nwhom we saw take horse; but, as we were on our guard, we answered her\nsly questions with a simplicity she could not distrust; when, all of a\nsudden, we heard the trampling of a horse's feet at the door. This noise\nalarmed Strap so much, whose imagination was wholly engrossed by the\nimage of Rifle, that, with a countenance as pale as milk, he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO\nLord! there is the highwayman returned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur landlady, staring at these words, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat highwayman, young man?\nDo you think any highwaymen harbour here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThough I was very much disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in\nStrap, I had presence of mind enough to tell her we had met a horseman\nthe day before, whom Strap had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman,\nbecause he rode with pistols; and that he had been terrified at the\nsound of a horse's feet ever since.\n\nShe forced a smile at the ignorance and timidity of my comrade; but I\ncould perceive, not without great concern, that this account was not at\nall satisfactory to her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWe proceed on our Journey--are overtaken by a Highwayman who fires at\nStrap--is prevented from shooting me by a Company of Horsemen, who ride\nin pursuit of him--Strap is put to Bed at an Inn--Adventures at that Inn\n\nAfter having paid our score and taken leave of our hostess, who embraced\nme tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, blessing ourselves\nthat we had come off so well. We had not walked above five miles, when\nwe observed a man on horseback galloping after us, whom we in a short\ntime recognised to be no other than this formidable hero who had already\ngiven us so much vexation. He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew\nwho he was? My astonishment had disconcerted me so much that I did not\nhear his question, which he repeated with a volley of oaths and threats;\nbut I remained as mute as before.\n\nStrap, seeing my discomposure, fell upon his knees in the mud, uttering,\nwith a lamentable voice, these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Christ's sake, have mercy\nupon us, Mr. Rifle! we know you very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the thief, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\ndo! But you never shall be evidence against me in this world, you dog!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying, he drew a pistol, and fired it at the unfortunate shaver, who\nfell flat upon the ground without speaking one word.\n\nMy comrade's fate and my own situation riveted me to the place where I\nstood, deprived of all sense and reflection; so that I did not make\nthe least attempt either to run away or deprecate the wrath of this\nbarbarian, who snapped a second pistol at me; but, before he had time\nto prime again, perceiving a company of horsemen coming up, he rode\noff, and left me standing motionless as a statue, in which posture I\nwas found by those whose appearance had saved my life. This company\nconsisted of three men in livery, well armed, with an officer, who (as I\nafterwards learned,) was the person from whom Rifle had taken the\npocket pistols the day before; and who, making known his misfortune to\na nobleman he met on the road, and assuring him his non-resistance\nwas altogether owing to his consideration for the ladies in the coach,\nprocured the assistance of his lordship's servants to go in quest of the\nplunderer. This holiday captain scampered up to me with great address,\nand asked who fired the pistol which he had heard.\n\nAs I had not yet recovered my reason, he, before I could answer,\nobserved a body lying on the ground, at which sight his colour changed,\nand he pronounced, with a faltering tongue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, here's murder\ncommitted! Let us alight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of his followers, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us\nrather pursue the murderer. Which way went he, young man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time I had recollected myself so far as to tell them that he\ncould not be a quarter of a mile before; and to beg one of them to\nassist me in conveying the corpse of my friend to the next house, in\norder to it being interred. The captain, foreseeing that, in case he\nshould pursue, he must soon come to action, began to curb his horse, and\ngave him the spur at the same time, which treatment making the creature\nrear up and snort, he called out, his horse was frightened, and would\nnot proceed; at the same time wheeling him round and round, stroking his\nneck, whistling and wheedling him with \u00e2\u0080\u009cSirrah, sirrah--gently, gently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n etc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cZ--ds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, cried one of the servants, \u00e2\u0080\u009csure my lord's Sorrel is not\nresty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words he bestowed a lash on his buttocks, and Sorrel,\ndisdaining the rein sprang forward with the captain at a pace that would\nhave soon brought him up with the robber, had not the girtle (happily\nfor him) given way, by which means he landed in the dirt; and two of\nhis attendants continued their pursuit, without minding his situation.\nMeanwhile one of the three who remained at my desire, turning the body\nof Strap, in order to see the wound which had killed him, found him\nstill warm and breathing: upon which, I immediately let him blood, and\nsaw him, with inexpressible joy, recover; he having received no other\nwound than what his fear had inflicted. Having raised him upon his legs,\nwe walked together to an inn, about half a mile from the place, where\nStrap, who was not quite recovered, went to bed; and in a little time\nthe third servant returned with the captain's horse and furniture,\nleaving him to crawl after as well as he could.\n\nThis gentleman of the sword, upon his arrival, complained grievously\nof the bruise occasioned by his fall; and, on the recommendation of\nthe servant, who warranted my ability, I was employed to bleed him, for\nwhich service he rewarded me with half-a-crown.\n\nThe time between this event and dinner I passed in observing a game at\ncards between two farmers, an exciseman, and a young fellow in a rusty\ngown and cassock, who, as I afterwards understood, was curate of a\nneighbouring parish. It was easy to perceive that the match was not\nequal; and that the two farmers, who were partners, had to do with a\ncouple of sharpers, who stripped them of all their cash in a very short\ntime. But what surprised me very mach, was to hear this clergyman reply\nto one of the countrymen, who seemed to suspect foul play, in these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n me, friend, d'ye question my honour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being a\ncharacter frequent in my own country; but I was scandalised at the\nindecency of his behaviour, which appeared in the oaths he swore, and\nthe bawdy songs which he sung. At last, to make amends in some sort, for\nthe damage he had done to the unwary boors, he pulled out a fiddle from\nthe lining of his gown, and, promising to treat them at dinner, began\nto play most melodiously, singing in concert all the while. This good\nhumour of this parson inspired the company with so much glee that the\nfarmers soon forgot their losses, and all present went to dancing in the\nyard.\n\nWhile we were agreeably amused in this manner, our musician, spying a\nhorseman a riding towards the inn, stopped all of a sudden, crying\nout, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGad so! gentlemen, I beg your pardon, there's our dog of a doctor\ncoming into the inn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He immediately commended his instrument, and ran\ntowards the gate, where he took hold of the vicar's bridle, and helped\nhim off, inquiring very cordially into the state of his health.\n\nThis rosy son of the church, who might be about the age of fifty, having\nalighted and entrusted the curate with his horse, stalked with great\nsolemnity, into the kitchen, where sitting down by the fire, he called\nfor a bottle of ale and a pipe; scarce deigning an answer to the\nsubmissive questions of those who inquired about the welfare of his\nfamily. While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound\nsilence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him\nif he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner? To\nwhich interrogation he answered in the negative, saying, he had been\nto visit Squire Bumpkin, who had drank himself into a high fever at the\nlast assizes; and that he had, on leaving his own house, told Betty he\nshould dine at home. Accordingly when he had made an end of his bottle\nand pipe, he rose, and moved with prelatical dignity to the door, where\nhis journeyman stood ready with his nag. He had no sooner mounted\nthan the facetious curate, coming into the kitchen, held forth in this\nmanner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere the old rascal goes, and the d--l go with him. You see\nhow the world wags, gentlemen. By gad, this rogue of a vicar does not\ndeserve to live; and yet he has two livings worth four hundred pounds\nper annum, while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery, and ride twenty\nmiles every Sunday to preach--for what? why, truly, for twenty pounds\na year. I scorn to boast of my own qualifications but--comparisons are\nodious. I should be glad to know how this wag-bellied doctor deserves to\nbe more at ease than me. He can loll in his elbow chair at home, indulge\nhimself in the best of victuals and wine and enjoy the conversation\nof Betty, his housekeeper. You understand me, gentlemen. Betty is the\ndoctor's poor kinswoman, and a pretty girl she is; but no matter for\nthat; ay, and dutiful girl to her parents, whom she visits regularly\nevery year, though I must own I could never learn in what county they\nlive, My service t'ye, gentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time dinner being ready, I waked my companion, and we ate\naltogether with great cheerfulness. When our meal was ended, and every\nman's share of the reckoning adjusted, the curate went out on pretence\nof some necessary occasion, and, mounting his house, left the two\nfarmers to satisfy the host in the best manner they could. We were no\nsooner informed of this piece of finesse, than the exciseman, who had\nbeen silent hitherto, began to open with a malicious grin: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay this\nis an old trick of Shuffle; I could not help smiling when he talked of\ntreating. You must know this is a very curious fellow. He picked up some\nscraps of learning while he served young Lord Trifte at the university.\nBut what he most excels in is pimping. No one knows his talents\nbetter than I, for I was valet-de-chambre to Squire Tattle an intimate\ncompanion of Shuffle's lord. He got him self into a scrape by pawning\nsome of his lordship's clothes on which account he was turned away; but,\nas he was acquainted with some particular circumstances of my lord's\nconduct, he did not care to exasperate him too much, and so made\ninterest for his receiving orders, and afterwards recommended him to\nthe curacy which he now enjoys. However, the fellow cannot be too much\nadmired for his dexterity in making a comfortable livelihood, in spite\nof such a small allowance. You hear he plays a good stick, and is really\ndiverting company; these qualifications make him agreeable wherever\nhe goes; and, as for playing at cards there is not a man within three\ncounties for him. The truth is, he is a d--able cheat, and can shift a\ncard with such address that it is impossible to discover him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere he was interrupted by one of the farmers, who asked, why he had\nnot justice enough to acquaint them with these particulars before they\nengaged in play. The exciseman replied, without any hesitation, that it\nwas none of his business to intermeddle between man and man; besides,\nhe did not know they were ignorant of Shuffle's character, which was\nnotorious to the whole country. This did not satisfy the other, who\ntaxed him with abetting and assisting the curate's knavery, and insisted\non having his share of the winnings returned; this demand the exciseman\nas positively refused affirming that, whatever sleights Shuffle might\npractise on other occasions, he was very certain that he had played\non the square with them, and would answer it before any bench in\nChristendom; so saying, he got up and, having paid his reckoning,\nsneaked off.\n\nThe Landlord, thrusting his neck into the passage to see if he was gone,\nshook his head, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! Lord help us! if every sinner was to have\nhis deserts. Well, we victuallers must not disoblige the excisemen. But\nI know what; if parson Shuffle and he were weighed together, a straw\nthrown into either scale would make the balance kick the beam. But,\nmasters, this is under the rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Boniface with a whisper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Highwayman is taken--we are detained as Evidence against\nhim--proceed to the next village--he escapes--we arrive at another\ninn, where we go to Bed--in the Night we are awaked by a dreadful\nAdventure--next night we lodge at the house of a Schoolmaster--our\nTreatment there\n\nStrap and I were about to depart on our journey, when we perceived a\ncrowd on the road coming towards us, shouting and hallooing all the way.\nAs it approached, we could discern a man on horseback in the middle,\nwith his hands tied behind him, whom we soon knew to be Rifle. The\nhighwayman, not being so well mounted as the two servants who went in\npursuit of him, was soon overtaken, and, after having discharged\nhis pistols, made prisoner without any further opposition. They were\ncarrying him in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the country people,\nto a justice of peace in a neighbouring village, but stopped at our inn\nto join their companions and take refreshment.\n\nWhen Rifle was dismounted and placed in the yard, within a circle of\npeasants, armed with pitchforks, I was amazed to see what a pitiful\ndejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours before filled\nme with such terror and confusion. My companion was so much encouraged\nby this alteration in his appearance that, going up to the thief, he\npresented his clenched fists to his nose, and declared he would either\ncudgel or box with the prisoner for a guinea, which he immediately\nproduced, and began to strip, but was dissuaded from this adventure by\nme, who represented to him the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle\nwas now in the hands of justice, which would, no doubt, give us all\nsatisfaction enough.\n\nBut what made me repent of our impertinent curiosity was our being\ndetained by the captors, as evidence against him, when we were just\ngoing to set forward. However, there was no remedy; we were obliged to\ncomply, and accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the\nsame road that we had proposed to follow. About the twilight we arrived\nat the place of our destination, but as the justice was gone to visit\na gentleman in the country, with whom (we understood) he would probably\nstay all night, the robber was confined in an empty garret, three\nstories high, from which it seemed impossible for him to escape; this,\nnevertheless, was the case; for next morning when they went up stairs to\nbring him before the justice, the bird was flown, having got out at the\nwindow upon the roof from whence he continued his route along the tops\nof the adjoining houses, and entered another garret where he skulked\nuntil the family were asleep; at which time he ventured down stairs, and\nlet himself out by the street-door, which was open.\n\nThis event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended him, who\nwere flushed with the hopes of the reward; but gave me great joy, as\nI was permitted now to continue my journey, without any further\nmolestation. Resolving to make up for the small progress we had hitherto\nmade, we this day travelled with great vigour and before night reached\na market town twenty miles from the place from whence we set out in the\nmorning, without meeting any adventure worth notice. Here having taken\nup our lodging at an an inn, I found myself so fatigued that I began to\ndespair of performing our journey on foot, and desired Strap to inquire\nif there were any waggon, return horses, or any cheap carriage in this\nplace, to depart for London next day. He was informed that the waggon\nfrom Newcastle to London had halted there two nights ago, and that\nit would be an easy matter to overtake it, if not the next day, at\nfarthest, the day after the next. This piece of news gave us some\nsatisfaction; and, after having made a hearty supper on hashed mutton,\nwe were shown to our room, which contained two beds, the one allotted\nfor us, and the other for a very honest gentleman, who, we were told,\nwas then drinking below. Though we could have very well dispensed with\nhis company, we were glad to submit to this disposition, as there was\nnot another bed empty in the house; and accordingly went to rest, after\nhaving secured our baggage under the bolster. About two or three o'clock\nin the morning I was awaked out of a very profound sleep by a dreadful\nnoise in the chamber, which did not fail to throw me into an agony\nof consternation, when I heard these words pronounced with a terrible\nvoice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him that's\nnext you, and I'll blow the other's brains out presently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis dreadful salutation had no sooner reached the ears of Strap than,\nstarting out of bed, he ran against somebody in the dark, and overturned\nhim in an instant; at the same time bawling out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire! murder! fire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n a cry which in a moment alarmed the whole house, and filled our chamber\nwith a crowd of naked people. When lights were brought, the occasion\nof all this disturbance soon appeared; which was no other than a fellow\nlodger, whom we found lying on the floor, scratching his head, with a\nlook testifying the utmost astonishment at the concourse of apparitions\nthat surrounded him.\n\nThis honest gentleman was, it seems, a recruiting sergeant, who, having\nlisted two country fellows over night, dreaded they had mutinied, and\nthreatened to murder him and the drummer who was along with him. This\nmade such an impression on his imagination, that he got up in his\nsleep and expressed himself as above. When our apprehension of danger\nvanished, the company beheld one another with great surprise and mirth;\nbut what attracted the notice of everyone was our landlady, with nothing\non her but her shift and a large pair of buckskin breeches, with the\nbackside before, which she had slipped on in the hurry, and her husband\nwith her petticoat about his shoulders; one had wrapped himself in a\nblanket, another was covered with a sheet, and the drummer, who had\ngiven his only shirt to be washed, appeared in cuerpo with a bolster\nrolled about his middle.\n\nWhen this affair was discussed, everybody retired to his own apartment,\nthe sergeant slipped into bed, and my companion and I slept without any\nfurther disturbance till morning, when we got up, went to breakfast,\npaid our reckoning, and set forward in expectation of overtaking the\nwaggon; in which hope, however, we were disappointed for that day. As\nwe exerted ourselves more than usual, I found myself quite spent with\nfatigue, when we entered a small village in the twilight. We inquired\nfor a public-house, and were directed to one of a very sorry appearance.\nAt our entrance the landlord, who seemed to be a venerable old man, with\nlong gray hair, rose from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat\npaved kitchen, and with a cheerful countenance accosted us in these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSalvete, pueri. Ingredimini.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was not a little pleased to hear\nour host speak Latin, because I was in hope of recommending myself to\nhim by my knowledge in that language; I therefore answered, without\nhesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDissolve frigus, ligna super foco--large reponens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nhad no sooner pronounced these words, than the old gentleman, running\ntowards me, shook me by the hand, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFili mi dilectissime! unde\nvenis?--a superis, ni fallor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, finding we were both read in\nthe classics, he did not know how to testify his regard enough; but\nordered his daughter, a jolly rosy-cheeked damsel who was his sole\ndomestic, to bring us a bottle of his quadrimum, repeating from Horace\nat the same time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeprome quadrimum sabina, O Tholiarche, merum diota.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This was excellent ale of his own brewing, of which he told us he had\nalways an amphora four years old, for the use of himself and friends.\n\nIn the course of our conversation, which was interlarded with scraps\nof Latin, we understood that this facetious person was a schoolmaster,\nwhose income being small, he was fain to keep a glass of good liquor for\nthe entertainment of passengers by which he made shift to make the\ntwo ends of the year meet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am this day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe happiest old\nfellow in his majesty's dominions. My wife, rest her soul, is in heaven.\nMy daughter is to be married next week; but the two chief pleasures of\nmy life are these (pointing to the bottle and a large edition of Horace\nthat lay on the table). I am old, 'tis true--what then? the more reason\nI should enjoy the small share of life that remains, as my friend\nFlaccus advises: 'Tu ne quaesieris (scire nefas) quem mihi, quem tibi\nfinem dii dederint. Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he was very inquisitive about our affairs, we made no scruple of\nacquainting him with our situation, which when he had learned, he\nenriched us with advices how to behave in the world, telling us that he\nwas no stranger to the deceits of mankind. In the meantime he ordered\nhis daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for supper, for he was resolved\nthis night to regale his friends--permittens divis caetera. While our\nentertainment was preparing, our host recounted the adventures of his\nown life, which, as they contained nothing remarkable, I forbear to\nrehearse. When we had fared sumptuously, and drunk several bottles\nof his I expressed a desire of going to rest, which was with some\ndifficulty complied with, after he had informed us that we should\novertake the waggon by noon next day; and that there was room enough in\nit for half-a-dozen, for there were only four passengers as yet in that\nconvenience.\n\nBefore my comrade and I fell asleep, we had some conversation about\nthe good humour of our landlord, which gave Strap such an idea of his\nbenevolence, that he positively believed we should pay nothing for our\nlodging and entertainment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you observe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he has\nconceived a particular affection for us--nay, even treated us at supper\nwith extraordinary fare, which, to be sure, we should not of ourselves\nhave called for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was partly of Strap's opinion; but the experience I had of the world\nmade me suspend my belief till the morning, when, getting up betimes, we\nbreakfasted with our host and his daughter on hasty-pudding and ale,\nand desired to know what we had to pay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiddy will let you know,\ngentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I never mind these matters. Money matters are\nbeneath the concern of one who lives upon the Horatian plan--Crescentum\nsequitur cura pecuniam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, Biddy, having consulted a slate\nthat hung in the corner, told us our reckoning came to 8s. 7d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEight\nshillings and seven pence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Strap, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'tis impossible! you must be\nmistaken, young woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cReckon again, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says her father, very\ndeliberately; \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps you have miscounted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know my business better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could contain my indignation no longer,\nbut said it was an unconscionable bill, and demanded to know the\nparticulars; upon which the old man got up, muttering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, let us\nsee the particulars--that's but reasonable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, taking pen, ink, and\npaper, wrote the following items:\n\n\nTo bread and beer 0 6 To a fowl and sausages 2 6 To four bottles of\nquadrim. 2 0 To fire and tobacco 0 7 To lodging 2 0 To breakfast 1 0\n---- 8 7\n\nAs he had not the appearance of a common publican, and had raised a sort\nof veneration in me by his demeanour the preceding night, it was not in\nmy power to upbraid him as he deserved; therefore, I contented myself\nwith saying I was sure he did not learn to be an extortioner from\nHorace. He answered, I was but a young man and did not know the world,\nor I would not tax him with extortion, whose only aim was to live\ncontentus parvo, and keep off importuna pauperies. My fellow traveller\ncould not so easily put up with this imposition; but swore he should\neither take one-third of the money or go without. While we were engaged\nin this dispute, I perceived the daughter go out, and, conjecturing the\noccasion, immediately paid the exorbitant demand, which was no sooner\ndone than Biddy returned with two stout fellows, who came in on pretence\nof taking their morning draught, but in reality to frighten us into\ncompliance. Just as we departed, Strap, who was half-distracted on\naccount of this piece of expense, went up to the schoolmaster, and,\ngrinning in his face, pronounced with great emphasis--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSemper avarus\neget.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which the pedant replied, with a malicious smile--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnimum\nrege, qui, nisi paret, imperat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nWe descry the Waggon--get into it--arrive at an inn--our Fellow\nTravellers described--a Mistake is committed by Strap, which produces\nstrange things\n\nWe travelled half-a-mile without exchanging one word; my thoughts being\nengrossed by the knavery of the world, to which I must be daily exposed,\nand the contemplation of my finances, which began sensibly to diminish.\nAt length, Strap, who could hold no longer, addressed me thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nfools and their money are soon parted. If my advice had been taken, that\nold skin-flint should have been d--n'd before he had got more than the\nthird of his demand. 'Tis a sure sign you came easily by your money,\nwhen you squander it away in this manner. Ah! God help you, how many\nbristly beards must I have mowed before I earned four shillings and\nthreepence-halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs! How many days\nhave I sat weaving hair till my toes were numbed by the cold, my fingers\ncramped, and my nose as blue as the sign of the periwig that hung over\nthe door! What the devil was you afraid of? I would have engaged to box\nwith any one of those fellows who came in for a guinea--I'm sure--I have\nbeat stouter men than either of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, indeed, my companion would\nhave fought anybody when his life was in no danger; but he had a mortal\naversion to fire-arms and all instruments of death. In order to appease\nhim, I assured him no part of this extraordinary expense should fall\nupon his shoulders; at which declaration he was affronted, and told me\nhe would have me to know that, although he was a poor barber's boy, yet\nhe had a soul to spend big money with the best squire of the land.\n\nHaving walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a\nrefreshment, we descried, toward the evening, to our inexpressible joy,\nthe waggon about a quarter of a mile before us; and, by that time we\nreached it, were both of us so weary that I verily believe it would\nhave been impracticable for us to have walked one mile farther. We,\ntherefore, bargained with the driver, whose name was Joey, to give us a\ncast to the next stage for a shilling; at which place we should meet\nthe master of the waggon, with whom we might agree for the rest of the\njourney.\n\nAccordingly the convenience stopped, and Joey having placed the ladder,\nStrap (being loaded with our baggage) mounted first; but, just as he was\ngetting in, a tremendous voice assailed his ears in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod's\nfury! there shall no passengers come here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The poor shaver was so\ndisconcerted at this exclamation, which both he and I imagined proceeded\nfrom the mouth of a giant, that he descended with great velocity and\na countenance as white as paper. Joey, perceiving our astonishment,\ncalled, with an arch sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaunds, coptain, whay woant yau sooffer\nthe poor waggoneer to meake a penny? Coom, coom, young man, get oop, get\noop, never moind the coptain; I'se not afeard of the coptain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was not encouragement sufficient to Strap, who could not be\nprevailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not\nwithout a quaking heart, when I heard the same voice muttering, like\ndistant thunder--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHell and the devil confound me, if I don't make you\nsmart for this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, I crept in, and by accident got an empty place\nin the straw, which I immediately took possession of, without being\nable to discern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark. Strap\nfollowing, with the knapsack on his back, chanced to take the other\nside, and, by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the stomach\nof the captain, who bellowed out, in a most dreadful manner, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and\nthunder! where's my sword?\u00e2\u0080\u009d At these words my frighted comrade started\nup, and, at one spring, bounced against me with such force that I\nthought he was the supposed son of Anak, who intended to press me to\ndeath. In the meantime a female voice cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBless me! what is the\nmatter, my dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the captain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd--n my blood!\nmy guts are squeezed into a pancake by that Scotchman's hump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Strap,\ntrembling all the while at my back, asked him pardon, and laid the blame\nof what had happened upon the jolting of the waggon; and the woman who\nspoke before went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, my dear, it is our own fault; we may\nthank ourselves for all the inconveniences we meet with. I thank God I\nnever travelled so before. I am sure if my lady or Sir John were to know\nwhere we are they would not sleep this night for vexation. I wish to God\nwe had writ for the chariot; I know we shall never be forgiven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\ncome, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the captain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit don't signify fretting now;\nwe shall laugh it over as a frolic; I hope you will not suffer in your\nhealth. I shall make my lord very merry with our adventures in this\ndiligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe discourse gave me such a high notion of the captain and his lady\nthat I durst not venture to join in the conversation; but immediately\nafter another female voice began: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people give themselves a great\nmany needless airs; better folks than any here have travelled in waggons\nbefore now. Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots, with three\nfootmen behind them, without making so much fuss about it. What then? We\nare now all upon a footing; therefore let us be sociable and merry. What\ndo you say, Isaac? Is not this a good motion, you doting rogue? Speak,\nyou old cent per cent fornicator? What desperate debt are you thinking\nof? What mortgage are you planning? Well, Isaac, positively you shall\nnever gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf, grow honest, and\nlive like a gentleman. In the meantime give me a kiss, you old fumbler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n These words, accompanied with a hearty smack, enlivened the person to\nwhom they were addressed to such a degree that he cried, in transport,\nthough with a faltering voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you wanton baggage--upon my credit,\nyou are a waggish girl--he, he, he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This laugh introduced a fit of\ncoughing, which almost suffocated the poor usurer (such we afterwards\nfound was the profession of this our fellow-traveller).\n\nAbout this time I fell asleep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till such\ntime as we arrived at the inn where we put up. Here, having alighted\nfrom the waggon, I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in order\nas they entered. The first who appeared was a brisk, airy girl, about\ntwenty years old, with a silver-laced hat on her head instead of a cap,\na blue stuff riding-suit, trimmed with silver very much tarnished, and\na whip in her hand. After her came, limping, an old man, with a worsted\nnightcap buttoned under his chin, and a broad-brimmed hat slouched over\nit, an old rusty blue cloak tied about his neck, under which appeared a\nbrown surtout, that covered a threadbare coat and waistcoat, and, as\nhe afterwards discerned, a dirty flannel jacket. His eyes were hollow,\nbleared, and gummy; his face was shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles,\nhis gums were destitute of teeth, his nose sharp and drooping, his chin\npeaked and prominent, so that, when he mumped or spoke, they approached\none another like a pair of nutcrackers: he supported himself on an\nivory-headed cane and his whole figure was a just emblem of winter,\nfamine, and avarice. But how was I surprised, when I beheld the\nformidable captain in the shape of a little thin creature, about the age\nof forty, with a long withered visage, very much resembling that of a\nbaboon, through the upper part of which two little gray eyes peeped: he\nwore his own hair in a queue that reached to his rump, which immoderate\nlength, I suppose, was the occasion of a baldness that appeared on the\ncrown of his head when he deigned to take off his hat, which was very\nmuch of the size and cock of Pistol's.\n\nHaving laid aside his great-coat, I could not help admiring the\nextraordinary make of this man of war: he was about five feet and three\ninches high, sixteen inches of which went to his face and long scraggy\nneck: his thighs were about six inches in length, his legs resembling\nspindles or drumsticks, five feet and a half, and his body, which put me\nin mind of extension without substance, engrossed the remainder: so that\non the whole, he appeared like a spider or grasshopper erect, and was\nalmost a vox et praeterea nihil. His dress consisted of a frock of what\nis called bearskin, the skirts of which were about half a foot long, an\nhussar waistcoat, scarlet breeches reaching half way down his thighs,\nworsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin, and shoes with wooden\nheels at least two inches high; he carried a sword very near as long as\nhimself in one hand, and with the other conducted his lady, who seemed\nto be a woman of his own age, and still retained some remains of an\nagreeable person, but so ridiculously affected, that, had I not been a\nnovice in the world, I might have easily perceived in her the deplorable\nvanity and second-hand airs of a lady's woman.\n\nWe were all assembled in the kitchen, when Captain Weazel (for that was\nhis name) desired a room with a fire for himself and spouse, and told\nthe landlord they would up by themselves. The innkeeper replied that he\ncould not afford them a room by themselves; and as for supping, he had\nprepared victuals for the passengers in the waggon, without respect of\npersons, but if he could prevail on the rest to let him have his choice\nin a separate manner, he should be very well pleased. This was no sooner\nsaid than all of us declared against the proposal, and Miss Jenny (our\nother female passenger), observed that, if Captain Weazel and his lady\nhad a mind to sup by themselves, they might wait until we should have\ndone. At this hint the captain put on a martial frown, and looked very\nbig, without speaking; while his yokefellow, with a disdainful toss\nof her nose, muttered something about \u00e2\u0080\u009cCreature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Miss Jenny\noverhearing, stepped up to her, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of your names, good Mrs.\nAbigail. Creature, quotha--I'll assure you no such creature as you\nneither--no ten-pound sneaker--no quality-coupler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here the captain\ninterposed, with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--e, madam, what do you mean by that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n you\nsir, who are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Miss Jenny, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho made you a captain, you\npitiful, trencher-scraping, pimping curler? 'Sdeath! the army is come to\na fine pass, when such fellows as you get commissions. What, I suppose\nyou think I don't know you? Egad, you and your helpmate are well met--a\ncast-off mistress and a bald valet-de-chambre are well yoked together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and wounds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Weazel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd'ye question the honour of my wife,\nmadam? Hell and d-ion! No man in England durst say so much--I would flay\nhim, carbonado him! Fury and destruction! I would have his liver for\nmy supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he drew his sword and flourished with it, to the\ngreat terror of Strap; while Miss Jenny, snapping her fingers, told him\nshe did not value his resentment a louse.\n\nIn the midst of this quarrel the master of the waggon alighted, who,\nunderstanding the cause of the disturbance, and fearing the captain and\nhis lady would take umbrage and leave his carriage, was at great pains\nto have everything made up, which he at last accomplished, and we sat\ndown to supper altogether. At bedtime we were shown to our apartments;\nthe old usurer, Strap, and I, to one room; the captain, his wife, and\nMiss Jenny, to another. About midnight, my companion's bowels being\ndisordered, he got up, in order to go backward, but in his return,\nmistaking one door for another, entered Weazel's chamber, and without\nany hesitation went to bed to his wife, who was fast asleep, the captain\nbeing at another end of the room groping for some empty vessel, in lieu\nof his own chamberpot, which was leaky: as he did not perceive\nStrap coming in, he went towards his own bed, after having found a\nconvenience; but no sooner did he feel a rough head, covered with a\ncotton nightcap, than it came into his mind that he had mistaken Miss\nJenny's bed instead of his own, and that the head he felt was that\nof some gallant, with whom she had made an assignation. Full of his\nconjecture, and scandalised at the prostitution of his apartment, he\nsnatched up the vessel he had just before filled, and emptied it at once\non the astonished barber and his own wife, who waking at that instant,\nbroke forth into lamentable cries, which not only alarmed the husband\nbeyond measure, but frighted poor Strap almost out of his senses; for he\nverily believed himself bewitched, especially when the incensed captain\nseized him by the throat, with a volley of oaths, asking him how he\ndurst have the presumption to attempt the chastity of his wife. Poor\nStrap was so amazed and confounded, that he could say nothing but--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ntake God to witness she's a virgin for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Weazel, enraged to find herself in such a pickle through the\nprecipitation of her husband, arose in her shift, and with the heel of\nher shoe which she found by the bedside, belaboured the captain's bald\npate till he roared \u00e2\u0080\u009cMurder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll teach you to empty your stinkpots\non me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou pitiful hop-o'-my-thumb coxcomb. What, I warrant\nyou're jealous, you man of lath. Was it for this I condescended to take\nyou to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe noise occasioned by this adventure had brought the master of the\nwaggon and me to the door, where we overheard all that passed with great\nsatisfaction. In the meantime we were alarmed with the cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRape!\nMurder! Rape!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Jenny pronounced with great vociferation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! You\nvile abominable old villain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould you rob me of my virtue?\nBut I'll be revenged of you, you old goat! I will! Help! for heaven's\nsake! help! I shall be ravished! ruined! help!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some servants of the\ninn, hearing this cry, came running upstairs with lights, and such\nweapons as chance afforded; when we beheld a very diverting scene. In\none corner stood the poor captain shivering in his shirt, which was all\ntorn to rags: with a woeful visage, scratched all over by his wife, who\nhad by this time wrapped the counterpane about her, and sat sobbing on\nthe side of her bed. At the other end lay the old usurer, sprawling on\nMiss Jenny's bed, with his flannel jacket over his shirt, and his tawny\nmeagre limbs exposed to the air; while she held him fast by the two\nears, and loaded him with execrations. When he asked what was the\nmatter, she affected to weep, told us she was afraid that wicked rogue\nhad ruined her in her sleep, and bade us take notice of what we saw, for\nshe intended to make use of our evidence against him. The poor wretch\nlooked like one more dead than alive, and begged to be released; a\nfavour which he had no sooner obtained than he protested she was no\nwoman, but a devil incarnate--that she had first seduced his flesh to\nrebel, and then betrayed him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, cockatrice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nknow you laid this snare fur me--but you shan't succeed--for I will hang\nmyself before you shall get a farthing of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he crawled to\nhis own bed, groaning all the way. We then advanced to the Captain, who\ntold us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, here has been a d--d mistake; but I'll be revenged\non him who was the cause of it. That Scotchman who carries the knapsack\nshall not breathe this vital air another day, if my name be Weazel. My\ndear, I ask you ten thousand pardons; you are sensible, I could mean no\nharm to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not what you meant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she, sighing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nI know I have got enough to send me to my grave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At length they were\nreconciled. The wife was complimented with a share of Miss Jenny's bed\n(her own being overflowed), and the master of the waggon invited Weazel\nto sleep the remaining part of the night with him. I retired to mine,\nwhere I found Strap mortally afraid, he having stolen away in the dark\nwhile the captain and his lady were at loggerheads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nCaptain Weazel challenges Strap, who declines the Combat--an Affair\nbetween the Captain and me--the Usurer is fain to give Miss Jenny five\nGuineas for a Release--we are in Danger of losing a Meal--the Behaviour\nof Weazel, Jenny, and Joey, on that Occasion--an Account of Captain\nWeazel and his Lady--the Captain's Courage tried--Isaac's mirth at the\nCaptain's Expense\n\nNext morning I agreed to give the master of the waggon ten shillings for\nmy passage to London, provided Strap should be allowed to take my place\nwhen I should be disposed to walk. At the same time I desired him to\nappease the incensed captain, who had entered the kitchen with a drawn\nsword in his hand, and threatened with many oaths to sacrifice the\nvillain who attempted to violate his bed; but it was to no purpose for\nthe master to explain the mistake, and assure him of the poor lad's\ninnocence, who stood trembling behind me all the while: the more\nsubmission that appeared in Strap, the more implacable seemed the\nresentment of Weazel, who swore he must either fight him or he would\ninstantly put him to death. I was extremely provoked at this insolence,\nand told him, it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would\nengage a man of the sword at his own weapon; but I was persuaded he\nwould wrestle or box with him. To which proposal Strap immediately gave\nassent, by saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009che would box with him for a guinea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weazel replied\nwith a look of disdain, that it was beneath any gentleman of his\ncharacter to fight like a porter, or even to put himself on a footing,\nin any respect, with such a fellow as Strap. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds bodikins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries\nJoey, \u00e2\u0080\u009csure, coptain, yaw would not commit moorder! Here's a poor lad\nthat is willing to make atonement for his offence; and an that woan't\nsatisfie yaw, offers to fight yaw fairly. And yaw woan't box, I dare\nsay, he will coodgel with yaw. Woan't yaw, my lad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Strap, after\nsome hesitation, answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, I'll cudgel with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But this\nexpedient being also rejected by the captain, I began to smell his\ncharacter, and, tipping Strap the wink, told the captain that I had\nalways heard it said, the person who receives a challenge should have\nthe choice of the weapons; this therefore being the rule in point of\nhonour, I would venture to promise on the head of my companion, that he\nwould even fight Captain Weazel at sharps; but it should be with\nsuch sharps as Strap was best acquainted with, namely, razors. At my\nmentioning razors: I could perceive the captain's colour change while\nStrap, pulling me by the sleeve, whispered with great eagerness: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\nno, no; for the love of God, don't make any such bargain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At length,\nWeazel, recovering himself, turned towards me, and with a ferocious\ncountenance asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho the devil are you? Will you fight me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d With\nthese words, putting himself in a posture, I was grievously alarmed\nat seeing the point of a sword within half a foot of my breast;\nand, springing to one side, snatched up a spit that stood in the\nchimney-corner, with which I kept my formidable adversary at bay, who\nmade a great many half-longes, skipping backward at every push, till\nat last I pinned him up in a corner, to the no small diversion of the\ncompany. While he was in this situation his wife entered, and, seeing\nher husband in these dangerous circumstances, uttered a dreadful scream:\nin this emergency, Weazel demanded a cessation, which was immediately\ngranted; and at last was contented with the submission of Strap,\nwho, falling on his knees before him, protested the innocence of his\nintention, and asked pardon for the mistake he had committed. This\naffair being ended without bloodshed, we went to breakfast, but missed\ntwo of our company, namely, Miss Jenny and the usurer. As for the first,\nMrs. Weazel informed us, that she had kept her awake all night with her\ngroans; and that when she rose in the morning, Miss Jenny was so much\nindisposed that she could not proceed on her journey. At that instant, a\nmessage came from her to the master of the waggon, who immediately went\ninto her chamber, followed by us all. She told him in a lamentable tone,\nthat she was afraid of a miscarriage, owing to the fright she received\nlast night from the brutality of Isaac; and, as the event was uncertain,\ndesired the usurer might be detained to answer for the consequence.\nAccordingly, this ancient Tarquin was found in the waggon, whither he\nhad retired to avoid the shame of last night's disgrace, and brought by\nforce into her presence. He no sooner appeared than she began to weep\nand sigh most piteously, and told us, if she died, she would leave her\nblood upon the head of that ravisher. Poor Isaac turned up his eyes and\nhands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from the machinations\nof that Jezebel; and assured us, with tears in his eyes, that his\nbeing found in bed with her was the result of her own invitation. The\nwaggoner, understanding the case, advised Isaac to make it up, by giving\nher a sum of money: to which advice he replied with great vehemence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\nsum of money!--a halter for the cockatrice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! 'tis very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMiss Jenny; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his by\nfair means. Joey, be so good as to go to the justice, and tell him\nthere is a sick person here, who wants to see him on an affair of\nconsequence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the name of justice Isaac trembled, and bidding Joey\nstay, asked with a quavering voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat she would have? She told\nhim that, as he had not perpetrated his wicked purpose, she would be\nsatisfied with a small matter. And though the damage she might sustain\nin her health might be irreparable, she would give him a release for\na hundred guineas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cA hundred guineas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he in an ecstacy, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\nhundred furies! Where should a poor old wretch like me have a hundred\nguineas? If I had so much money, d'ya think I should be found travelling\nin a waggon, at this season of the year?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jenny,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cnone of your miserly artifice here. You think I don't know Isaac\nRapine, the money-broker, in the Minories. Ah! you old rogue! many a\npawn have you had of me and my acquaintance, which was never redeemed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Isaac, finding it was in vain to disguise himself, offered twenty\nshillings for a discharge, which she absolutely refused under fifty\npounds: at last, however, she was brought down to five, which he paid\nwith great reluctancy, rather than be prosecuted for a rape. After which\naccommodation, the sick person made a shift to get into the waggon,\nand we set forward in great tranquillity; Strap being accommodated\nwith Joey's horse, the driver himself choosing to walk. The morning and\nforenoon we were entertained with an account of the valour of Captain\nWeazel, who told us he had once knocked down a soldier that made game of\nhim; tweaked a drawer by the nose, who found fault with his picking his\nteeth with a fork, at another time; and that he had moreover challenged\na cheesemonger, who had the presumption to be his rival: for the truth\nof which exploits he appealed to his wife. She confirmed whatever he\nsaid, and observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last affair happened that very day on which I\nreceived a love-letter from Squire Gobble, and don't you remember, my\ndear, I was prodigiously sick that very night with eating ortolans, when\nmy Lord Diddle took notice of my complexion's being altered, and my lady\nwas so alarmed that she had well nigh fainted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nthe captain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know my lord said to me, with a sneer, 'Billy, Mrs.\nWeazel is certainly breeding.' And I answered cavalierly, 'My lord, I\nwish I could return the compliment.' Upon which the whole company\nbroke out into an immoderate fit of laughter; and my lord, who loves a\nrepartee dearly, came round and bussed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We travelled in this manner\nfive days, without interruption or meeting anything worth notice: Miss\nJenny, who soon recovered her spirits, entertaining us every day with\ndiverting songs, of which she could sing a great number; and rallying\nher own gallant, who, notwithstanding, would never be reconciled to\nher. On the sixth day, while we were about to sit down to dinner, the\ninnkeeper came and told us, that three gentlemen, just arrived, had\nordered the victuals to be carried to their apartment, although he had\ninformed them that they were bespoke by the passengers in the waggon. To\nwhich information they had replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe passengers in the waggon might\nbe d--d, their betters must be served before them; they supposed it\nwould be no hardship on such travellers to dine upon bread and cheese\nfor one day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was a terrible disappointment to us all; and we\nlaid our heads together how to remedy it; when Miss Jenny observed that\nCaptain Weazel, being by profession a soldier, ought in this case to\nprotect and prevent us from being insulted. But the Captain excused\nhimself, saying, he would not for all the world be known to have\ntravelled in a waggon! swearing at the same time, that could he appear\nwith honour, they should eat his sword sooner than his provision. Upon\nthis declaration, Miss Jenny, snatching his weapon, drew it, and ran\nimmediately into the kitchen, where she threatened to put the cook to\ndeath if he did not send the victuals into our chamber immediately. The\nnoise she made brought the three strangers down, one of whom no sooner\nperceived her than he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! Jenny Ramper! what the devil brought\nthee hither?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Jack Rattle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she, running into his arms,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cis it you? Then Weazel may go to hell for a dinner--I shall dine with\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey consented to this proposal with a great deal of joy; and we were\non the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal, when Joey,\nunderstanding the whole affair, entered the kitchen with a pitchfork in\nhis hand, and swore he would be the death of any man who should pretend\nto seize the victuals prepared for the waggon. The menace had like to\nhave produced fatal consequences; the three strangers drawing their\nswords, and being joined by their servants, and we ranging ourselves on\nthe side of Joey; when the landlord, interposing, offered to part with\nhis own dinner to keep the peace, which was accepted by the strangers;\nand we sat down at table without any further molestation. In the\nafternoon, I chose to walk along with Joey, and Strap took my place.\nHaving entered into a conversation with this driver, I soon found him\nto be a merry, facetious, good-natured fellow, and withal very arch;\nhe informed me, that Miss Jenny was a common girl upon the town, who,\nfalling into company with a recruiting officer, he carried her down in\nthe stage coach from London to Newcastle, where he had been arrested for\ndebt, and was now in prison; upon which she was fain to return to her\nformer way of life, by this conveyance. He told me likewise, that one of\nthe gentleman's servants, who were left at the inn, having accidentally\nseen Weazel, immediately knew him, and acquainted Joey with some\nparticulars of his character. That he had served my Lord Frizzle in\nquality of valet-de-chambre many years, while he lived separate from\nhis lady; but, upon their reconciliation, she expressly insisted upon\nWeazel's being turned off, as well as the woman he kept: when his\nlordship, to get rid of them both with a good grace, proposed that he\nshould marry his Mistress, and he would procure a commission for him\nin the army: this expedient was agreed to, and Weazel is now, by his\nlordship's interest, ensigned in --'s regiment. I found he and I had the\nsame sentiments with regard to Weazel's courage, which he resolved\nto put to the trial, by alarming the passengers with the cry of a\n'highwayman!' as soon as a horseman should appear.\n\nThis scheme we put in practice, towards the dusk, when we descried a man\non horseback approaching us. Joey had no sooner intimated to the people\nin the waggon, that he was afraid we should be all robbed than a general\nconsternation arose: Strap jumped out of the waggon, and hid himself\nbehind a hedge. The usurer put forth ejaculations, and made a rustling\namong the straw, which made us conjecture he had hid something under\nit. Mrs. Weazel, wringing her hands uttered lamentable cries: and the\ncaptain, to our great amazement, began to snore; but this artifice did\nnot succeed; for Miss Jenny, shaking him by the shoulder, bawled out,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSdeath! captain, is this a time to snore, when we are going to be\nrobbed? Get up for shame, and behave like a soldier and man of honour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Weazel pretended to be in a great passion for being disturbed, and swore\nhe would have his nap out if all the highwaymen in England surrounded\nhim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n my blood! what are you afraid of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he; at the same\ntime trembling with such agitation that the whole carriage shook. This\nsingular piece of behaviour incensed Miss Ramper so much that she cried,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n your pitiful soul, you are as arrant a poltroon, as ever was\ndrummed out of a regiment. Stop the waggon, Joey--let me out, and by\nG--d, if I have rhetoric enough, the thief shall not only take your\npurse, but your skin also.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying she leaped out with great agility.\nBy this time the horseman came up and happened to be a gentleman's\nservant well known to Joey, who communicated the scheme, and desired\nhim to carry it on a little further, by going into the waggon, and\nquestioning those within. The stranger, consenting for the sake of\ndiversion, approached it, and in a terrible tone demanded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho have\nwe got here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Isaac replied, with a lamentable voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's a poor\nmiserable sinner, who has got a small family to maintain, and nothing in\nthe world wherewithal, but these fifteen shillings which if you rob\nme of we must all starve together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho's that sobbing in the other\ncorner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the supposed highwayman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA poor unfortunate woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Mrs. Weazle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cupon whom I beg you, for Christ's sake, to have\ncompassion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you maid or wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWife, to my sorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho, or where is your husband?\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy husband,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Mrs. Weazel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis an officer in the army and was left sick at the\nlast inn where we dined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be mistaken, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\nI myself saw him get into the waggon this afternoon. But pray what smell\nis that? Sure your lapdog has befouled himself; let me catch hold of the\nnasty cur, I'll teach him better manners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he laid hold of one of\nWeazel's legs, and pulled him out from under his wife's petticoat, where\nhe had concealed himself. The poor trembling captain, being detected in\nhis inglorious situation, rubbed his eyes, and affecting to wake out of\nsleep, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's the matter? What's the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe matter is not\nmuch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the horseman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only called in to inquire after your\nhealth, and so adieu, most noble captain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He clapped spurs to his\nhorse, and was out of sight in a moment.\n\nIt was some time before Weazel could recollect himself, but at length\nreassuming the big look, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n the fellow! why did he ride\naway before I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do I? Don't you\nremember Tom, my dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d addressing himself to his wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I do remember something of the fellow, but you know I\nseldom converse with people of his station.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey-day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Joey, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo\nyaw knaw the young mon, coptain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Weazel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany a time\nhas he filled a glass of Burgundy for me, at my Lord Trippett's table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what may his name be, coptain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis name!--his name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Weazel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis Tom Rinser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaunds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Joey, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca has changed\nhis own neame then! for I'se lay a wager he was christened John\nTrotter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This observation raised a laugh against the captain, who\nseemed very much disconcerted; when Isaac broke silence, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis no matter who or what he was, since he has not proved the robber\nwe suspected, and we ought to bless God for our narrow escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBless\nGod,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Weazel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbless the devil! for what? Had he been a highwayman,\nI should have eaten his blood, body, and guts, before he had robbed\nme, or any one in this diligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, ha, ha,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Miss Jenny, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nbelieve you will eat all you kill, indeed, captain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The usurer was so\nwell pleased at the event of this adventure, that he could not refrain\nfrom being severe, and took notice that Captain Weazel seemed to be a\ngood Christian, for he had armed himself with patience and resignation,\ninstead of carnal weapons; and worked out his salvation with fear and\ntrembling. This piece of satire occasioned a great deal of mirth at\nWeazel's expense, who muttered a great many oaths, and threatened to cut\nIsaac's throat. The usurer, taking hold of this menace, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen\nand ladies, I take you all to witness, that in my life is in danger from\nthis bloody-minded officer; I'll have him bound over to the peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This second sneer produced another laugh against him, and he remained\ncrestfallen during the remaining part of our journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nStrap and I are terrified by an Apparition--Strap's Conjecture--the\nMystery explained by Joey--we arrive in London--our Dress and\nAppearance described--we are insulted in the Street--an Adventure in an\nAlehouse--we are imposed upon by a waggish Footman--set to rights by\na Tobacconist--take Lodgings--dive for a Dinner--an Accident at our\nOrdinary\n\nWe arrived at our inn, supped, and went to bed; but Strap's distemper\ncontinuing, he was obliged to rise in the middle of the night, and\ntaking the candle in his hand, which he had left burning for the\npurpose, he went down to the house of office, whence in a short time\nhe returned in a great hurry, with his hair standing on end, and a look\nbetokening horror and astonishment. Without speaking a word, he set down\nthe light and jumped into bed behind me, where he lay and trembled with\ngreat violence. When I asked him what was the matter, he replied, with a\nbroken accent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod have mercy on us! I have seen the devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though my\nprejudice was not quite so strong as his, I was not a little alarmed\nat this exclamation, and much more so when I heard the sound of bells\napproaching our chamber, and felt my bedfellow cling close to me,\nuttering these words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChrist have mercy upon us; there he comes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At\nthat instance a monstrous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with\nbells at his feet, and made directly towards our bed. As this creature\nis reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches\nto play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and, in a\nviolent fright, shrank under the bedclothes. This terrible apparition\nleaped upon the bed, and after giving us several severe dabs with\nits beak through the blankets, hopped away, and vanished. Strap and I\nrecommended ourselves to the protection of heaven with great devotion,\nand, when we no longer heard the noise, ventured to peep up and take\nbreath. But we had not been long freed from this phantom, when another\nappeared, that had well nigh deprived us both of our senses. We\nperceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that\nreached to his middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in his\neyes and countenance that did not savour of this world; and his dress\nconsisted of a brown stuff coat, buttoned behind and at the wrists, with\nan odd-fashioned cap of the same stuff upon his head. I was so amazed\nthat I had not power to move my eyes from such a ghastly object, but lay\nmotionless and saw him come straight up to me: when he reached the bed,\nhe wrung his hands, and cried, with a voice that did not seem to belong\nto a human creature, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Ralph?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I made no reply: upon which he\nrepeated, in an accent still more preternatural, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Ralpho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nhad no sooner pronounced these words than I heard the sound of the bells\nat a distance; which the apparition, having listened to, tripped away,\nand left me almost petrified with fear. It was a good while before I\ncould recover myself so far as to speak; and, when at length I turned to\nStrap, I found him in a fit, which, however, did not last long. When\nhe came to himself, I asked his opinion of what had happened; and he\nassured me that the first must certainly be the soul of some person\ndamned, which appeared by the chain about his legs (for his fears had\nmagnified the creature to the bigness of a horse, and the sound of small\nmorice-bells to the clanking of massy chains). As for the old man, he\ntook it to be the spirit of somebody murdered long ago in this place,\nwhich had power granted to forment the assassin in the shape of a raven,\nand that Ralpho was the name of the said murderer. Although I had not\nmuch faith in this interpretation, I was too much troubled to enjoy any\nsleep: and in all my future adventures never passed a night so ill.\n\nIn the morning Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who, after an\nimmoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling him that\nthe old man was the landlord's father, who had been an idiot some years,\nand diverted himself with a tame raven, which, it seems, had hopped away\nfrom his apartment in the night, and induced him to follow it to our\nchamber, where he had inquired after it under the name of Ralpho.\n\nNothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey,\nwhich continued six or seven days longer: at length we entered the great\ncity, and lodged all night at the inn where the waggon put up. Next\nmorning all the passengers parted different ways, while my companion and\nI sallied out to inquire for the member of parliament, to whom I had a\nletter of recommendation from Mr. Crab. As we had discharged our lodging\nat the inn, Strap took up our baggage and, marched behind me in the\nstreet with the knapsack on his back, as usual, so that we made a very\nwhimsical appearance. I had dressed myself to the greatest advantage;\nthat is, put on a clean ruffled shirt, and my best thread stockings: my\nhair (which was of the deepest red) hung down upon my shoulders, as lank\nand straight as a pound of candles; and the skirts of my coat reached to\nthe middle of my leg; my waistcoat and breeches were of the same piece,\nand cut in the same taste; and my hat very much resembled a barber's\nbasin, in the shallowness of the crown and narrowness of the brim. Strap\nwas habited in a much less awkward manner: but a short crop-eared wig,\nthat very much resembled Scrub's in the play, and the knapsack on his\nback, added to what is called a queer phiz, occasioned by a long chin, a\nhook nose, and high cheek bones, rendered him, on the whole, a very\nfit subject of mirth and pleasantry. As he walked along, Strap, at\nmy desire, inquired of a carman, whom we met, whereabouts Mr. Cringer\nlived: and was answered by a stare, accompanied with the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Upon which I came up, in order to explain the question, but had the\nmisfortune to be unintelligible likewise, the carman damning us for a\nlousy Scotch guard, whipping his horses with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cGee ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which nettled\nme to the quick, and roused the indignation of Strap so far that, after\nthe fellow was gone a good way, he told me he would fight him for a\nfarthing.\n\nWhile we were deliberating upon what was to be done, a hackney coachman,\ndriving softly along, and perceiving us standing by the kennel, came up\nclose to us, and calling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA coach, master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d by a dexterous management\nof the reins made his horses stumble in the wet, and bedaub us all over\nwith mud. After which exploit he drove on, applauding himself with a\nhearty laugh, in which several people joined, to my great mortification;\nbut one, more compassionate than the rest, seeing us strangers, advised\nme to go into an alehouse, and dry myself. I thanked him for his advice,\nwhich I immediately complied with; and, going into the house he pointed\nout, called for a pot of beer, and sat down by a fire in the public room\nwhere we cleaned ourselves as well as we could. In the meantime, a wag,\nwho sat in a box, smoking his pipe, understanding, by our dialect, that\nwe were from Scotland, came up to me and, with a grave countenance\nasked how long I had been caught. As I did not know the meaning of this\nquestion, I made no answer; and he went on, saying it could not be a\ngreat while, for my tail was not yet cut; at the same time taking hold\nof my hair, and tipping the wink to the rest of the company, who seemed\nhighly entertained with his wit. I was incensed at this usage, but\nafraid of resenting it, because I happened to be in a strange place,\nand perceived the person who spoke to me was a brawny fellow, for whom\nI thought myself by no means a match. However, Strap, having either more\ncourage or less caution, could not put up with the insults I suffered,\nbut told him in a peremptory tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was an uncivil fellow for making\nso free with his betters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then the wit going toward him, asked him what\nhe had got in his knapsack? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it oatmeal or brimstone, Sawney?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, seizing him by the chin, which he shook, to the inexpressible\ndiversion of all present. My companion, feeling himself assaulted in\nsuch an opprobrious manner, disengaged himself in a trice, and lent his\nantagonist such a box on the ear as made him stagger to the other side\nof the room; and, in a moment, a ring was formed for the combatants.\nSeeing Strap beginning to strip, and my blood being heated with\nindignation, which banished all other thoughts, I undressed myself\nto the skin in an instant, and declared, that as the affront that\noccasioned the quarrel was offered to me, I would fight it out myself;\nupon which one or two cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's a brave Scotch boy; you shall\nhave fair play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His assurance gave me fresh spirits, and, going up to\nmy adversary, who by his pale countenance did not seem much inclined to\nthe battle, I struck him so hard on the stomach, that he reeled over\na bench, and fell to the ground. Then I attempted to keep him down, in\norder to improve my success, according to the manner of my own country,\nbut was restrained by the spectators, one of whom endeavoured to raise\nup my opponent, but in vain; for he protested he would not fight, for he\nwas not quite recovered of a late illness. I was very well pleased with\nthis excuse, and immediately dressed myself, having acquired the good\nopinion of the company for my bravery, as well as of my comrade Strap,\nwho shook me by the hand, and wished me joy of the victory.\n\nAfter having drunk our pot, and dried our clothes, we inquired of the\nlandlord if he knew Mr. Cringer, the member of parliament, and were\namazed at his replying in the negative; for we imagined he must be\naltogether as conspicuous here as in the borough he represented; but\nhe told us we might possibly hear of him as we passed along. We betook\nourselves therefore to the street, where seeing a footman standing\nat the door, we made up to him, and asked if he knew where our patron\nlived? This member of the particoloured fraternity, surveying us both\nvery minutely, said he knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bade us turn down\nthe first street on our left, then turn to the right, and then to the\nleft again, after which perambulation we would observe a lane, through\nwhich we must pass, and at the other end we should find an alley that\nleads to another street, where we should see the sign of the Thistle and\nThree Pedlars, and there he lodged. We thanked him for his information,\nand went forwards, Strap telling me, that he knew this person to be an\nhonest friendly man by his countenance, before he opened his mouth; in\nwhich opinion I acquiesced, ascribing his good manners to the company he\ndaily saw in the house where he served.\n\nWe followed his directions punctually, in turning to the left, and to\nthe right, and to the left again; but instead of seeing a lane before\nus, found ourselves at the side of the river, a circumstance that\nperplexed us not a little; and my fellow-traveller ventured to\npronounce, that we had certainly missed our way. By this time we were\npretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed,\nI went into a small snuff-shop hard by, encouraged by the sign of\nthe Highlander, where I found, to my inexpressible satisfaction,\nthe shopkeeper was my countryman. He was no sooner informed of our\nperegrination, and the directions we had received from the footman, than\nhe informed us we had been imposed upon, telling us, Mr. Cringer lived\nin the other end of the town and that it would be to no purpose for us\nto go thither to-day, for by that time he was gone to the House. I then\nasked, if he could recommend us a lodging. He really gave us a line\nto one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler's shop not far from St.\nMartin's Lane; there we hired a bed-room, up two pair of stairs, at the\nrate of two shillings per week, so very small, that when the bed was let\ndown, we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that\nbelonged to the apartment, and use the bedstead by way of chairs.\nAbout dinner-time, our landlord asked how we proposed to live? to which\ninterrogation we answered, that we would be directed by him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nthen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are two ways of eating in this town for people\nof your condition--the one more creditable and expensive than the other:\nthe first is to dine at an eating-house frequented by well-dressed\npeople only; and the other is called diving, practised by those who are\neither obliged or inclined to live frugally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I gave him to understand\nthat, provided the last was not infamous, it would suit much better with\nour circumstances than the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInfamous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot at all;\nthere are many creditable people, rich people, ay, and fine people,\nthat dive every day. I have seen many a pretty gentleman with a\nlaced waistcoat dine in that manner very comfortably for three pence\nhalfpenny, and go afterwards to the coffee-house, where he made a figure\nwith the best lord in the land; but your own eyes shall bear witness--I\nwill go along with you to-day and introduce you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe accordingly conducted us to a certain lane, where stopping, he bade\nus observe him, and do as he did, and, walking a few paces, dived into\na cellar and disappeared in an instant. I followed his example, and\ndescending very successfully, found myself in the middle of a cook's\nshop, almost suffocated with the steams of boiled beef, and surrounded\nby a company of hackney coachmen, chairmen, draymen, and a few footmen\nout of place or on board-wages; who sat eating shin of beef, tripe,\ncow-heel, or sausages, at separate boards, covered with cloths which\nturned my stomach. While I stood in amaze, undetermined whether to sit\ndown or walk upwards again, Strap, in his descent, missing one of the\nstops, tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary, and overturned the\ncook as she carried a porringer of soup to one of the guests. In her\nfall, she dashed the whole mess against the legs of a drummer belonging\nto the foot-guards, who happened to be in her way, and scalded him so\nmiserably, that he started up, and danced up and down, uttering a volley\nof execrations that made my hair stand on end.\n\nWhile he entertained the company in this manner, with an eloquence\npeculiar to himself, the cook got up, and after a hearty curse on the\npoor author of this mischance, who lay under the table with a woful\ncountenance, emptied a salt-cellar in her hand, and, stripping down the\npatient's stocking, which brought the skin along with it, applied\nthe contents to the sore. This poultice was scarce laid on, when the\ndrummer, who had begun to abate of his exclamations, broke forth into\nsuch a hideous yell as made the whole company tremble, then, seizing a\npewter pint pot that stood by him, squeezed the sides of it together,\nas if it had been made of pliant leather, grinding his teeth at the\nsame time with a most horrible grin. Guessing the cause of this violent\ntransport, I bade the woman wash off the salt, and bathe the part with\noil, which she did, and procured him immediate ease. But here another\ndifficulty occurred, which was no other than the landlady's insisting\non his paying for the pot he had rendered useless. He said, he would\npay for nothing but what he had eaten, and bade her be thankful for\nhis moderation, or else he would prosecute her for damages. Strap,\nforeseeing the whole affair would lie at his door, promised to satisfy\nthe cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer, which\nentirely appeased him, and composed all animosities. After this\naccommodation, our landlord and we sat down at a board, and dined upon\nshin of beef most deliciously; our reckoning amounting to twopence\nhalfpenny each, bread and small beer included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nWe visit Strap's friend--a description of him--his advice--we go to Mr.\nCringer's house--are denied admittance--an Accident befalls Strap--his\nbehaviour thereupon--an extraordinary adventure occurs, in the course of\nwhich I lose all my money\n\nIn the afternoon my companion proposed to call at his friend's\nhouse, which, we were informed, was in the neighbourhood, whither\nwe accordingly went, and were so lucky as to find him at home. This\ngentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years before, kept\na school in town, where he taught the Latin, French, and Italian\nlanguages; but what he chiefly professed was the pronunciation of\nthe English tongue, after a method more speedy and uncommon than any\npractised heretofore, and, indeed, if his scholars spoke like their\nmaster, the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a\ntittle: for although I could easily understand every word of what I\nhad heard hitherto since I entered England, three parts in four of his\ndialect were as unintelligible to me as if he had spoken in Arabic or\nIrish. He was a middle-sized man, and stooped very much, though not\nabove the age of forty; his face was frightfully pitted with the\nsmall-pox, and his mouth extended from ear to ear. He was dressed in\na night-gown of plaid, fastened about his middle with a sergeant's old\nsash, and a tie-periwig with a foretop three inches high, in the fashion\nof King Charles the Second's reign.\n\nAfter he had received Strap, who was related to him, very courteously,\nhe inquired of him who I was; and being informed, he took me by the\nhand, telling me he was at school with my father. When he understood\nmy situation, he assured me that he would do me all the service in his\npower, both by his advice and otherwise, and while he spoke these\nwords eyed me with great attention, walking round me several times, and\nmuttering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, dear! Oh, dear! fat a saight is here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I soon guessed\nthe reason of his ejaculation, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose, sir, you are not\npleased with my dress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may caal it fat you\nplease in your country, but I vow to Gad 'tis a masquerade here. No\nChristian will admit such a figure into his house. Upon my conscience,\nI wonder the dogs did not hunt you. Did you pass through St. James's\nmarket? Bless my eyesaight! you are like a cousin-german of an\nourangoutang.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began to be a little serious at this discourse, and\nasked him, if he thought I should obtain entrance to-morrow at the house\nof Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended for an introduction into\nbusiness? \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Cringer, Mr. Cringer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he, scratching his cheek,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmay be a very honest gentleman--I know nothing to the contrary; but is\nyour sole dependence upon him? Who recommended you to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I pulled out\nMr. Crab's letter, and told him the foundation of my hopes, at which he\nstared at me, and repeated \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh dear! Oh dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began to conceive bad\nomens from this behaviour of his, and begged he would assist me with\nhis advice, which he promised to give very frankly; and as a specimen,\ndirected us to a periwig warehouse in the neighbourhood, in order to be\naccommodated; laying strong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr.\nCringer till I had parted with my carroty locks, which, he said, were\nsufficient to beget an antipathy against me in all mankind. And as we\nwere going to pursue this advice, he called me back and bade me be sure\nto deliver my letter into Mr. Cringer's own hand.\n\nAs we walked along, Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his\nfriend, who, it seems, had assured him he would in a day or two provide\nfor him with some good master; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI and now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI you will see how\nI will fit you with a wig. There's ne'er a barber in London (and that's\na bold word) can palm a rotten caul, or a pennyweight of dead hair, upon\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, indeed, this zealous adherent did wrangle so long with the\nmerchant, that he was desired twenty times to leave the shop, and see if\nhe could get one cheaper elsewhere. At length I made choice (if a good\nhandsome bob), for which I paid ten shillings, and returned to our\nlodging, where Strap in a moment rid me of that hair which had given the\nschoolmaster so much offence.\n\nWe got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave\naudience by candle-light to all his dependents, he himself being obliged\nto attend the levee of my Lord Terrier at break of day, because his\nlordship made one at the minister's between eight and nine o'clock. When\nwe came to Mr. Cringer's door, Strap, to give me all instance of his\npoliteness, ran to the knocker, which he employed so loud and so long,\nthat he alarmed the whole street; and a window opening in the\nsecond story of the next house, a vessel was discharged upon him so\nsuccessfully, that the poor barber was wet to the skin, while I, being\nluckily at some distance, escaped the unsavoury deluge. In the meantime,\na footman opening the door, and seeing nobody in the street but us,\nasked, with a stern countenance, if it was I who made such a noise, and\nwhat I wanted. I told him I had business with his master, whom I desired\nto see. Upon which he slapped the door in my face, telling me I must\nlearn better manners before I could have access to his master. Vexed\nat this disappointment, I turned my resentment against Strap, whom\nI sharply reprimanded for his presumption; but he, not in the least\nregarding what I said, wrung the wet out of his periwig, and lifting up\na large stone, flung it with such force against the street door of that\nhouse from whence he had been bedewed, that the lock giving way, it\nflew wide open, and he took to his heels, leaving me to follow him as I\ncould. Indeed, there was no time for deliberation; I therefore pursued\nhim with all the speed I could exert, until we found ourselves about\nthe dawn in a street we did not know. Here, as we wandered along gaping\nabout, a very decent sort of a man, passing by me, stopped of a sudden\nand took up something, which having examined, he turned and presented to\nme with these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, you have dropped half-a-crown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was not a\nlittle surprised at this instance of honesty, and told him it did not\nbelong to me; but he bade me recollect, and see if all my money was\nsafe; upon which I pulled out my purse, for I had bought one since I\ncame to town, and, reckoning my money in my hand, which was now reduced\nto five guineas seven shillings and twopence, assured him I had lost\nnothing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, says he, so much the better; this is a godsend,\nand as you two were present when I picked it up, you are entitled to\nequal shares with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was astonished at these words, and looked upon\nthis person to be a prodigy of integrity, but absolutely refused to take\nany part of the sum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are too modest--I\nsee you are strangers, but you shall give me leave to treat you with a\nwhet this cold raw morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I would have declined the invitation,\nbut Strap whispered to me that the gentleman would be affronted, and I\ncomplied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere shall we go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am quite ignorant\nof this part of the town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I informed him that we were in the same\nsituation; upon which he proposed to go into the first public-house we\nshould find open; and as we walked together, he began in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nfind by your tongues you are from Scotland, gentlemen; my grandmother by\nthe father's side was of your country, and I am so prepossessed in its\nfavour, that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms. The Scots are\nvery brave people. There is scarce a great family in the kingdom that\ncannot boast of some exploits performed by its ancestors many hundred\nyears ago. There's your Douglasses, Gordons, Campbells, Hamiltons. We\nhave no such ancient families here in England. Then you are all very\nwell educated. I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew as well\nas if they had been his mother-tongue. And for honesty--I once had a\nservant, his name was Gregor Macgregor, I would have trusted him with\nuntold gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis eulogium of my native country gained my affections so strongly,\nthat I believe I could have gone to death to serve the author; and\nStrap's eyes swam in tears. At length, as we passed through a dark\nnarrow lane, we perceived a public-house, which we entered, and found a\nman sitting by the fire, smoking a pipe, with a pint of purl before him.\nOur new acquaintance asked us if ever we had drunk egg-flip? To which\nquestion we answering in the negative, he assured us of a regale, and\nordered a quart to be prepared, calling for pipes and tobacco at\nthe same time. We found this composition very palateable, and drank\nheartily; the conversation, which was introduced by the gentleman,\nturning upon the snares that young inexperienced people are exposed\nto in this metropolis. He described a thousand cheats that are daily\npractised upon the ignorant and unwary, and warned us of them with so\nmuch good nature and concern, that we blessed the opportunity which\nthrew us in his way. After we had put the can about for some time, our\nnew friend began to yawn, telling us he had been up all night with a\nsick person; and proposed we should have recourse to some diversion to\nkeep him awake. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe should take a hand at whist for\npastime. But let me see: that won't do, there's only three of us; and I\ncannot play at any other game. The truth is, I seldom or never play, but\nout of complaisance, or at such a time as this, when I am in danger of\nfalling asleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlthough I was not much inclined to gaming, I felt no aversion to pass\nan hour or two at cards with a friend; and knowing that Strap understood\nas much of the matter as I, made no scruple of saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish we could\nfind a fourth hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While we were in this perplexity the person whom we\nfound in the house at our entrance, overhearing our discourse, took the\npipe from his mouth very gravely, and accosted us thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, my\npipe is out, you see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shaking the ashes into the fire, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand rather\nthan you should be balked, I don't care if I take a hand with you for\na trifle--but remember I won't play for anything of consequence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We\naccepted his proffer with pleasure. Having cut for partners, it fell to\nmy lot to play with him against our friend and Strap, for threepence\na game. We were so successful, that in a short time I was half-a-crown\ngainer; when the gentleman whom we had met in the street observing he\nhad no luck to-day, proposed to leave off, or change partners. By\nthis time I was inflamed with my good fortune and the expectation of\nimproving it, as I perceived the two strangers played but indifferently;\ntherefore I voted for giving him his revenge: and cutting again, Strap\nand I, to our mutual satisfaction, happened to be partners. My good\nfortune attended me still, and in less than an hour we had got thirty\nshillings of their money, for as they lost they grew the keener, and\ndoubled stakes every time. At last the inconstant goddess began to veer\nabout, and we were very soon stripped of all our gains, and about forty\nshillings of our own money. This loss mortified me extremely, and had a\nvisible effect on the muscles of Strap's face, which lengthened apace;\nbut our antagonists perceiving our condition, kindly permitted us to\nretrieve our loss, and console ourselves with a new acquisition. Then my\ncompanion wisely suggested it was time to be gone; upon which the person\nwho had joined us in the house began to curse the cards, and muttered\nthat we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got, no part of\nour success being owing to our good play. This insinuation nettled me so\nmuch that I challenged him to a game at piquet for a crown: and he was\nwith difficulty persuaded to accept the invitation. This contest ended\nin less than an hour to my inexpressible affliction, who lost every\nshilling of my own money, Strap absolutely refusing to supply me with a\nsixpence.\n\nThe gentleman at whose request we had come in, perceiving by my\ndisconsolate looks the situation of my heart, which well nigh burst with\ngrief and resentment, when the other stranger got up, and went away with\nmy money, began in this manner:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am truly afflicted at your bad luck,\nand would willingly repair it, were it in my power. But what in the name\nof goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long? It is always a\nmaxim with gamesters to pursue success as far us it will go, and to stop\nwhenever fortune shifts about. You are a young man, and your passions\nare too impetuous; you must learn to govern them better. However, there\nis no experience like that which is bought; you will be the better for\nthis the longest day you have to live. As for the fellow who has got\nyour money, I don't half like him. Did not you see me tip you the wink\nto leave off in time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou was\ntoo eager to mind anything but the game. But, harkee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in a\nwhisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009care you satisfied of that young man's honesty? His looks are a\nlittle suspicious--but I may be mistaken; he made a great many grimaces\nwhile he stood behind you, this is a very wicked town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him I was\nvery well convinced of my comrade's integrity and, that the grimaces\nhe mentioned were doubtless owing to his anxiety of my loss. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh ho! if\nthat be the case, I ask his pardon. Landlord, see what's to pay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nreckoning amounted to eighteenpence, which, having discharged, the\ngentleman shook us both by the hand, and, saying he should be very glad\nto see us again, departed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nStrap moralises--presents his purse to me--we inform our landlord of\nour misfortune--he unravels the mystery--I present myself to Cringer--he\nrecommends and turns me over to Mr. Staytape--I become acquainted with\na fellow dependent, who explains the character of Cringer and\nStaytape--and informs me of the method to be pursued at the Navy Office\nand Surgeons' Hall--Strap is employed\n\nIn our way to our lodging, after a profound silence on both sides,\nStrap, with a hideous groan, observed that we had brought our pigs to a\nfine market. To this observation I made no reply, and he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod\nsend us well out of this place; we have not been in London eight and\nforty hours, and I believe we have met with eight and forty thousand\nmisfortunes. We have been jeered, reproached, buffeted, and at last\nstript of our money; and I suppose by and bye we shall be stript of\nour skins. Indeed as to the money part of it, that was owing to our own\nfolly.--Solomon says, 'Bray a fool in a mortar, and he will never be\nwise.' Ah! God help us, an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This was no time for him to tamper with my disposition, already mad with\nmy loss, and inflamed with resentment against him for having refused me\na little money to attempt to retrieve it. I therefore turned towards\nhim with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool? Being\naltogether unaccustomed to such looks from me, he stood still, and\nstared in my face for some time; then, with some confusion, uttered,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFool! I called nobody fool but myself; I am sure I am the greatest fool\nof the two, for being so much concerned at other people's misfortunes;\nbut 'Nemo omnibus horis sapit'--that's all, that's all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which a\nsilence ensued, which brought us to our lodging, where I threw myself\nupon the bed in an agony of despair, resolved to perish rather than\napply to my companion, or any other body, for relief; but Strap, who\nknew my temper, and whose heart bled within him for my distress, after\nsome pause came to the bedside, and, putting a leathern purse into my\nhand, burst into tears, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what you think, but I scorn your\nthought. There's all I have in the world, take it, and I'll perhaps get\nmore for you before that be done. If not, I'll beg for you, steal for\nyou, go through the wide world with you, and stay with you; for though I\nbe a poor cobbler's son, I am no scout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was so much touched with the\ngenerous passion of this poor creature, that I could not refrain from\nweeping also, and we mingled our tears together for some time. Upon\nexamining the purse, I found in it two half-guineas and half-a-crown,\nwhich I would have returned to him, saying, he knew better than I how\nto manage it, but he, absolutely refused my proposal and told me it\nwas more reasonable and decent that he should depend upon me, who was a\ngentleman, than that I should be controlled by him.\n\nAfter this friendly contest was over, and our minds more at ease, we\ninformed our landlord of what had happened to us, taking care to conceal\nthe extremity to which we were reduced. He no sooner heard the story,\nthan he assured us we had been grievously imposed upon by a couple of\nsharpers, who were associates; and that this polite, honest, friendly,\nhumane person, who had treated us so civilly, was no other than a\nrascally money-dropper, who made it his business to decoy strangers in\nthat manner to one of his own haunts, where an accomplice or two were\nalways waiting to assist in pillaging the prey he had run down. Here the\ngood man recounted a great many stories of people who has been seduced,\ncheated, pilfered, beat--nay, even murdered by such villains. I was\nconfounded at the artifice and wickedness of mankind; and Strap, lifting\nup his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from\nsuch scenes of iniquity, for surely the devil had set up his throne in\nLondon. Our landlord being curious to know what reception we had met\nwith at Mr. Cringer's, we acquainted him with the particulars, at which\nhe shook his head, and told us we had not gone the right way to work;\nthat there was nothing to be done with a member of parliament without a\nbribe; that the servant was commonly infected with the master's disease,\nand expected to be paid for his work, as well as his betters. He\ntherefore advised me to give the footman a shilling the next time I\nshould desire admittance to my patron, or else I should scarce find an\nopportunity to deliver my letter. Accordingly, next morning, when the\ndoor was opened, I slipped a shilling into his hand, and told him I had\na letter for his master. I found the good effect of my liberality; for\nthe fellow let me in immediately, and, taking the letter out of my hand,\ndesired me to wait in a kind of passage for an answer. In this place I\ncontinued standing for three-quarters-of-an-hour, during which time I\nsaw a great many young fellows whom I formerly knew in Scotland pass\nand repass, with an air of familiarity, in their way to and from the\naudience-chamber; while I was fain to stand shivering in the cold, and\nturn my back to them that they might not perceive the lowness of my\ncondition. At length, Mr. Cringer came out to see a young gentleman to\nthe door, who was no other than Squire Gawky, dressed in a very gay suit\nof clothes; at parting Mr. Cringer shook him by the hand and told him he\nhoped to have the pleasure of his company at dinner. Then turning about\ntowards me, asked what were my commands? When he understood I was\nthe person who had brought the letter from Mr. Crab, he affected to\nrecollect my name, which, however, he pretended he could not do till he\nhad consulted the letter again; to save him the trouble, I told him\nmy name was Random. Upon which he went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, Random, Random,\nRandom--I think I remember the name:\u00e2\u0080\u009d and very well he might, for\nthis very individual, Mr. Cringer, had many a time rode before my\ngrandfather's cloak-bag, in quality of a footman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\npropose to go on board a man-of-war as surgeon's mate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied by a\nlow bow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe it will be a difficult matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nprocure a warrant, there being already such a swarm of Scotch surgeons\nat the Navy Office, in expectation of the next vacancy, that the\ncommissioners are afraid of being torn to pieces, and have actually\napplied for a guard to protect them. However, some ships will soon be\nput in commission, and then we shall see what's to be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying,\nhe left me, exceedingly mortified at the different reception Mr.\nGawky and I had met with from this upstart, proud, mean member, who, I\nimagined, would have been glad of an opportunity to be grateful for the\nobligations he owed to my family.\n\nAt my return, I was surprised with the agreeable news of Strap's being\nemployed, on the recommendation of his friend, the schoolmaster, by a\nperiwig-maker in the neighbourhood, who allowed him five shillings per\nweek besides bed and board. I continued to dance attendance every other\nmorning at the levee of Mr. Cringer, during a fortnight; in which time I\nbecame acquainted with a young fellow of my own country and profession,\nwho also depended on the member's interest, but was treated with much\nmore respect than I, both by the servants and master, and often admitted\ninto a parlour, where there was a fire for the convenience of the better\nsort of those who waited for him. Thither I was never permitted\nto penetrate, on account of my appearance, which was not at all\nfashionable; but was obliged to stand blowing my fingers in a cold\nlobby, and take the first opportunity of Mr. Cringer's going to the door\nto speak with him.\n\nOne day, while I enjoyed this occasion a person was introduced, whom Mr.\nCringer no sooner saw, than, running towards him, he saluted him with a\nlow bow to the very ground, and afterwards shaking him by the hand with\ngreat heartiness and familiarity, called him his good friend, and asked\nvery kindly after Mrs. Staytape and the young ladies; then, after a\nwhisper, which continued some minutes, wherein I overheard the word\n'honour' repeated several times with great emphasis, Mr. Cringer\nintroduced me to this gentleman, as to a person whose advice and\nassistance I might depend upon; and having given me his direction,\nfollowed me to the door, where he told me I need not give myself the\ntrouble to call at his house any more, for Mr. Staytape would do my\nbusiness. At that instant my fellow-dependent, coming out after me,\noverheard the discourse of Mr. Cringer, and, making up to me in the\nstreet, accosted me very civilly: this address I looked upon as no small\nhonour, considering the figure he made, for he was dressed in a blue\nfrock with a button, a green silk waistcoat, trimmed with gold, black\nvelvet breeches, white silk stockings, silver buckles, a gold-laced hat,\na spencer-wig, and a silver-hilted hanger, with a fine clouded can in\nhis hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are but lately come from Scotland;\npray what may your business with Mr. Cringer be? I suppose it is no\nsecret and I may possibly give you some advice that will be serviceable,\nfor I have been surgeon's second mate on board of a seventy-gun ship,\nand consequently know a good deal of the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI made no scruple to disclose my situation, which, when he had learned,\nhe shook his head, and told me he had been pretty much, in the same\ncircumstances about a year ago: that he had relied on Cringer's\npromises, until his money (which was considerable) as well as his\ncredit, was quite exhausted; and when he wrote to his relations for a\nfresh supply, instead of money he received nothing but reproaches, and\nthe epithets of idle, debauched fellow. That after he had waited at the\nNavy Office many months for a warrant to no purpose, he was fain to pawn\nsome of his clothes, which raised a small sum wherewith he bribed the\nsecretary, who soon procured a warrant for him, notwithstanding he had\naffirmed the same day, that there was not one vacancy. That he had gone\non board, where he remained nine months, at the end of which the ship\nwas put out of commission, and he said the company were to be paid off\nin Broad Street the very next day. That relations being reconciled to\nhim, had charged him to pay his devoirs regularly to Mr. Cringer, who\nhad informed them by letter that his interest alone had procured the\nwarrant; in obedience to which command he came to his levee every\nmorning; as I saw, though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful\nscoundrel. In conclusion, he asked me if I had yet passed at Surgeons'\nHall? To which question I answered, I did not so much as know it was\nnecessary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNecessary:\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh then I find I must instruct you:\ncome along with me, and I'll give you information about that matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nSaying, he carried me into an ale-house, where I called for some beer,\nand bread and cheese, on which we breakfasted. While we sat in this\nplace, he told me I must first go to the Navy Office, and write to the\nBoard, desiring them to order a letter for me to Surgeon's Hall, that\nI might be examined, touching my skill in surgery. That the surgeons,\nafter having examined me, would give me my qualification sealed up in\nform of a letter directed to the commissioners, which qualification\nI must deliver to the secretary of the Board, who would open it in my\npresence, and read the contents; after which I must employ my interest\nto be provided for as soon as possible. That the expense of his\nqualification for second mate of a third-rate, amounted to thirteen\nshillings, exclusive of the warrant, which cost him half-a-guinea and\nhalf-a-crown, besides a present to the secretary, which consisted of a\nthree-pound twelve piece. This calculation was like a thunderbolt to me,\nwhose whole fortune did not amount to twelve shillings. I accordingly\nmade him acquainted with this part of my distress, after having thanked\nhim for his information and advice. He condoled me on this occasion; but\nbade me be of good cheer, for he had conceived a friendship for me, and\nwould make all things easy. He was ran out at present, but to-morrow or\nnext day, he was certain of receiving a considerable sum; of which he\nwould lend me what would be sufficient to answer my exigencies. This\nfrank declaration pleased me so much, that I pulled out my purse,\nand emptied it before him, begging him to take what he pleased for\npocket-expense, until he should receive his own money. With a good deal\nof pressing, he was prevailed upon to take five shillings telling me\nthat he might have what money he wanted at any time for the trouble of\ngoing into the city; but as he had met with me, he would defer his going\nthither till tomorrow, when I should go along with him, and he would put\nme in the way of acting for myself, without a servile dependence on that\nrascal Cringer, much less on the tailor to whom he heard him turn me\nover. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis Mr. Staytape a tailor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo less, I assure\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, I confess, more likely to serve you than\nthe member; for, provided you can entertain him with politics and\nconundrums, you may have credit with him for as many and as rich clothes\nas you please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him, I was utterly ignorant of both, and so\nincensed at Cringer's usage, that I would never set foot within his door\nagain.\n\nAfter a good deal more conversation, my new acquaintance and I parted,\nhaving made an appointment to meet next day at the same place; in\norder to set out for the city. I went immediately to Strap and related\neverything which had happened, but he did not at all approve of my being\nso forward to lend money to a stranger, especially as we had already\nbeen so much imposed upon by appearances. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\nare sure he is a Scotchman, I believe you are safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nMy new acquaintance breaks an appointment--I proceed, by myself, to\nthe Navy Office--address me to a person there, who assists me with\nadvice--write to the Board, they grant me a letter to the Surgeons at\nthe Hall--am informed of the beau's name and character--find him--he\nmakes me his confidant in an amour--desires me to pawn my linen for his\noccasions--recover what I lent him--some curious observations on Strap\non that occasion--his vanity.\n\nIn the morning I rose and went to the place of rendezvous, where\nI waited two hours in vain, and was so exasperated against him for\nbreaking his appointment, that I set out for the city by myself, in\nhope of finding the villain, and being revenged on him for his breach of\npromise. At length I found myself at the Navy Office, which I entered,\nand saw crowds of young fellows walking below, many of whom made no\nbetter appearance than myself. I consulted the physiognomy of each, and\nat last made up to one whose countenance I liked, and asked, if he could\ninstruct me in the form of the letter which was to be sent to the Board\nto obtain an order for examination? He answered me in broad Scotch, that\nhe would show me the copy of what he had writ for himself, by direction\nof another who know the form, and accordingly pulled it out of his\npocket for my perusal; and told me that, if I was expeditious, I might\nsend it into the Board before dinner, for they did no business in the\nafternoon. He then went with me to coffee-house hard by, where I wrote\nthe letter, which was immediately delivered to the messenger, who told\nme I might expect an order to-morrow about the same time.\n\nHaving transacted this piece of business, my mind was a good deal\ncomposed; and as I had met with so much civility from the stranger, I\ndesired further acquaintance with him, fully resolved, however, not to\nbe deceived by him so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau. He\nagreed to dine with me at the cook's shop which I frequented; and on our\nway thither carried me to 'Change, where I was in hopes of finding\nMr. Jackson (for that was the name of the person who had broke his\nappointment), I sought him there to no purpose, and on our way towards\nthe other end of the town imparted to my companion his behaviour towards\nme; upon which he gave me to understand, that he was no stranger to the\nname of Bean Jackson (so he was called at the Navy Office), although he\ndid not know him personally; that he had the character of a good-natured\ncareless fellow, who made no scruple of borrowing from any that would\nlend; that most people who knew him believed he had a good principle at\nbottom, but his extravagance was such, he would probably never have\nit in his power to manifest the honesty of his intention. This made me\nsweat for my five shillings, which I nevertheless did not altogether\ndespair of recovering, provided I could find out the debtor.\n\nThis young man likewise added another circumstance of Squire Jackson's\nhistory, which was, that being destitute of all means to equip himself\nfor sea, when he received his last warrant, he had been recommended to a\nperson who lent him a little money, after he had signed a will entitling\nthat person to lift his wages when they should become due, as also to\ninherit his effects in case of his death. That he was still under the\ntutorage and direction of that gentleman, who advanced him small sums\nfrom time to time upon this security, at the rate of fifty per cent. But\nat present his credit was very low, because his funds would do little\nmore than pay what he had already received, this moderate interest\nincluded. After the stranger (whose name was Thompson) had entertained\nme with this account of Jackson, he informed me that he himself had\npassed for third mate of a third-rate, about four months ago; since\nwhich time he had constantly attended at the Navy Office, in hope of\na warrant, having been assured from the beginning, both by a Scotch\nmember, and one of the commissioners to whom the member recommended\nhim, that he should be put into the first vacancy; notwithstanding which\npromise, he had the mortification to see six or seven appointed in the\nsame station almost every week--that now being utterly impoverished, his\nsole hope consisted in the promise of a friend lately come to town, to\nlend him a small matter, for a present to the secretary; without\nwhich he was persuaded he might wait a thousand years to no purpose.\nI conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow, which (I believe)\nproceeded from the similitude of our fortunes. We spent the whole day\ntogether; and as he lived at Wapping I desired him to take a share of my\nbed.\n\nNext day we returned to the Navy Office, where, after being called\nbefore the Board, and questioned about the place of my nativity and\neducation, they ordered a letter to be made out for me, which, upon\npaying half-a-crown to the clerk, I received, and delivered into the\nhands of the clerk at Surgeons' Hall, together with a shilling for\nhis trouble in registering my name. By this time my whole stock was\ndiminished to two shillings, and I saw not the least prospect of relief,\neven for present subsistence, much less to enable me to pay the fees at\nSurgeons' Hall for my examination, which would come on in a fortnight.\nIn this state of perplexity, I consulted Strap, who assured me he would\npawn everything he had in the world, even to his razors, before I should\nwant: but this expedient I absolutely rejected, telling him, I would a\nthousand times rather list for a soldier, of which I had some thoughts,\nthan be any longer a burden to him. At the word soldier, he grew pale\nas death, and begged on his knees I would think no more of that scheme.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod preserve us all in our right wits!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould you turn\nsoldier, and perhaps be sent abroad against the Spaniards, where you\nmust stand and be shot at like a woodcock? Heaven keep cold lead out\nof my carcase, and let me die in a bed like a Christian, as all my\nforefathers have done. What signifies all earthly riches and honour, if\none enjoys not content? and, hereafter, there is no respect of persons.\nBetter be a poor honest barber with a good conscience, and time to\nrepent of my sins upon my death-bed, than be cut off (God bless us!)\nby a musket-shot, as it were in the very flower of one's age, in the\npursuit of riches and fame. What signify riches, my dear friend? do they\nnot make unto themselves wings and fly away? as the wise man saith. I\ncould also mention many other sayings in contempt of riches, both from\nthe Bible and other good books; but I know you are not very fond of\nthose things, I shall only assure you, that if you take on to be a\nsoldier, I will do the same; and then if we should both be slain, you\nwill not only have your own blood to answer for, but mine also: and\nperadventure the lives of all those whom we shall kill in battle.\nTherefore I pray you, consider whether you will sit down contented\nwith small things and share the fruits of my industry in peace, till\nProvidence shall send better tidings; or, by your despair, plunge\nboth our souls and bodies into everlasting perdition, which God of his\ninfinite mercy forbid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could not help smiling at this harangue, which\nwas delivered with great earnestness, the tears standing in his eyes all\nthe time, and promised to do nothing of that sort without his consent\nand concurrence. He was much comforted with this declaration; and told\nme in a few days he should receive a week's wages, which should be at my\nservice, but advised me in the meantime to go in quest of Jackson, and\nrecover, if possible, what he had borrowed of me. I accordingly trudged\nabout from one end of the town to the other, for several days, without\nbeing able to learn anything certain concerning him: and, one day being\nextremely hungry, and allured by the steams that regaled my nostrils\nfrom a boiling cellar, I went down with an intention to gratify my\nappetite with a twopennyworth of beef; when to my no small surprise\nfound Mr. Jackson sitting at dinner with a footman. He no sooner\nperceived me than he got up and shook me by the hands saying, he was\nglad to see me, for he intended to have called at my lodgings in the\nafternoon. I was so well pleased at this rencounter and the apologies he\nmade for not keeping his appointment, that I forgot my resentment, and\nsat down to dinner, with the happy expectation of not only recovering my\nown money before we should part, but also of reaping the benefit of his\npromise to lend me wherewithal to pass examination; and this hope my\nsanguine complexion suggested, though the account Thompson gave me of\nhim ought to have moderated my expectation.\n\nWhen we had feasted sumptuously, he took his leave of the footman, and\nadjourned with me to an ale-house hard by, where, after shaking me by\nthe hand again, he began thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you think me a sad dog, Mr.\nRandom, and I do confess that appearances are against me. But I dare say\nyou will forgive me when I tell you, my not coming at the time appointed\nwas owing to a peremptory message I received from a certain lady, whom,\nharkee! (but this is a great secret) I am to marry very soon. You think\nthis strange, perhaps, but it is not less true for all that--a five\nthousand pounder, I'll assure you, besides expectations. For my own\npart, devil take me if I know what any woman can see engaging about\nme--but a whim, you know--and then one would not balk one's good\nfortune. You saw that footman who dined with us--he's one of the\nhonestest fellows that ever wore livery. You must know it was by his\nmeans I was introduced to her, for he made me first acquainted with her\nwoman, who is his mistress--ay, many a crown has he and his sweetheart\nhad of my money--but what of that? things are now brought to a bearing.\nI have--(come a little this way) I have proposed marriage, and the day\nis fixed--she's a charming creature, and writes like an angel! She\ncan repeat all the English tragedies as well as ever a player in Drury\nLane!-and, indeed, is so fond of plays, that to be near the stage\nshe has taken lodgings in a court hard by the theatre; but you shall\nsee--you shall see--here's the last letter she sent me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With\nthese words, he put it into my hand, and I read (to the best of my\nremembrance) as follows:\n\n\n'Dear Creeten--As you are the animable hopjack of my contemplayshins,\nyour aydear is infernally skimming before my keymerycal fansee, when\nMurfy sends his puppies to the heys of slipping mortals; and when Febus\nshines from his merry dying throne; whereupon I shall canseif old time\nhas lost his pinners, as also cubit his harrows, until thou enjoy\nsweet propose in the loafseek harms of thy very faithfool to commend,\nClayrender Wingar Yard, Drury Lane, January 12th.'\n\nWhile I was reading, he seemed to be in an ecstasy, rubbing his hands,\nand bursting out into fits of laughter; at last he caught hold of my\nhand, and squeezing it, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere--a style for you! What do you\nthink of this billet-doux?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt might be ablime for aught I\nknew, for it was altogether above my comprehension.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe it is--both tender and sublime; she's a divine creature! and\nso doats upon me! Let me see--what shall I do with this money, when I\nhave once got it into my hands? In the first place, I shall do for you.\nI'm a man of few words---but say no more that's determined; whether\nwould you advise me, to purchase some post, by which I may rise in the\nstate, or lay out my wife's fortune in land, and retire to the country\nat once?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I gave my opinion without hesitation, that he could not do\nbetter than buy an estate and improve; especially since he had already\nseen so much of the world. Then I launched out into the praises of\na country life, as described by the poets whose works I had read. He\nseemed to relish my advice, but withal told me, that although he had\nseen a great deal of the world both at land and sea, having cruised\nthree whole months in the Channel, yet he should not be satisfied until\nhe had visited France, which he proposed to do before he should settle;\nand to carry his wife along with him. I had nothing to object to his\nproposal; and asked how soon he hoped to be happy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing obstructs my happiness but the want of a little ready\ncash; for you must know, my friend in the city has gone out of town for\na week or two, but I unfortunately missed my pay at Broad Street, by\nbeing detained too long by the dear charmer--but there will be a recall\nat Chatham next week, whither the ship's books are sent, and I have\ncommissioned a friend in that place to receive the money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that be\nall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere's no great harm in deferring your marriage a few\ndays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, faith, but there is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou don't know how many\nrivals I have, who would take all advantages against me. I would not\nbalk the impatience of her passion for the world--the least appearance\nof coldness or indifference would ruin all; and such offers don't occur\nevery day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI acquiesced in this observation, and inquired how he intended to\nproceed. At this question he rubbed his chin, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, truly, I\nmust be obliged to some friend or other--do you know nobody that would\nlend me a small sum for a day or two?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I assured him, I was such an\nutter stranger in London, that I did not believe I could borrow a guinea\nif my life depended upon it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat's hard--that's hard! I\nwish I had anything to pawn--upon my soul, you have got excellent linen\n(feeling the sleeve of my shirt); how many shirts of that kind have you\ngot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSix ruffled, and six plain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At which he testified\ngreat surprise, and declared that no gentleman ought to have more than\nfour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many d'ye think I have got?\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut this and\nanother, as I hope to be saved! and I dare say we shall be able to raise\na good sum out of your superfluity: let me see--let me see--each of\nthese shirts is worth sixteen shillings at a moderate computation--now,\nsuppose we pawn them for half-price--eight times eight is sixty-four,\nthat's three pounds four; that will do--give me your hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftly,\nsoftly, Mr. Jackson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't dispose of my linen without my\nconsent: first pay me the crown you owe me, and then we shall talk of\nother matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He protested that he had not above one shilling in his\npocket, but that he would pay me out of the first of the money raised\nfrom the shirts. This piece of assurance incensed me so much that I\nswore I would not part with him until I had received satisfaction for\nwhat I had lent him; and as for the shirts, I would not pawn one of them\nto save him from the gallows.\n\nAt this expression he laughed aloud, and then complained it was very\nhard that I should refuse him a trifle that would infallibly enable him\nnot only to make his own fortune but mine also. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou talk of pawning my\nshirts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009csuppose you should sell this hanger, Mr. Jackson. I\nbelieve it would fetch a good round sum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, hang it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncan't appear decently without my hanger, lest it should go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However,\nseeing me inflexible with regard to my linen, he at length unbuckled\nhis hanger, and, showing me the three blue balls, desired me to carry\nit thither and pawn it for two guineas. This office I would by no means\nhave performed, had I seen any likelihood of having my money otherwise;\nbut not willing, out of a piece of false delicacy, to neglect the only\nopportunity I should perhaps ever have, I ventured into a pawnbroker's\nshop, where I demanded two guineas on the pledge, in the name of Thomas\nWilliams. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo guineas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the pawnbroker, looking at the hanger;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis piece of goods has been here several times before for thirty\nshillings: however, since I believe the gentleman to whom it belongs\nwill redeem it, he shall have what he wants; and accordingly he paid me\nthe money, which I carried to the house where I had left Jackson; and,\ncalling for change, counted out to him seven and thirty shillings,\nreserving the other five for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After looking at the money some\ntime, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! it don't signify--this won't do my business;\nso you may as well take half-a-guinea, or a whole one, as the five\nshillings you have kept.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thanked him kindly, but refused to accept of\nany more than was my due, because I had no prospect of repaying it. Upon\nwhich declaration, he stared in my face, and told me, I was excessively\nraw or I would not talk in that manner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave a very bad opinion of a young fellow who won't borrow of his friend\nwhen he is in want--'tis the sign of a sneaking spirit. Come, come,\nRandom, give me back the five shillings, and take this half-guinea,\nand if ever you are able to pay me, I believe you will: if not, I shall\nnever ask it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen I reflected upon my present necessity, I suffered myself to be\npersuaded, and after making my acknowledgments to Mr. Jackson, who\noffered to treat me with a play, I returned to my lodgings with a much\nbetter opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning; and at night\nimparted my day's adventure to Strap, who rejoiced at my good luck,\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you if he was a Scotchman you was safe enough--and who\nknows but this marriage may make us all. You have heard, I suppose, as\nhow a countryman of ours, a journeyman baker, ran away with a great\nlady of this town, and now keeps his coach. I say nothing; but yesterday\nmorning as I was shaving a gentleman at his own house, there was a young\nlady in the room, and she threw so many sheep's eyes at a certain person\nwhom I shall not name, that my heart went knock, knock, knock, like a\nfulling mill, and my hand sh-sh-shook so much that I sliced a piece of\nskin off the gentleman's nose; whereby he uttered a deadly oath, and was\ngoing to horsewhip me, when she prevented him, and made my peace. Is not\na journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker? The only difference\nis, the baker uses flour for the belly, and the barber rises it for the\nhead: and as the head is a more noble member than the belly, so is a\nbarber more noble than a baker--for what's the belly without the head?\nBesides, I am told, he could neither read nor write; now you know I\ncan do both, and moreover, speak Latin--but I will say no more, for I\ndespise vanity--nothing is more vain than vanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words,\nhe pulled out of his pocket a wax-candle`s end, which he applied to his\nforehead; and upon examination, I found had combed his own hair over the\ntoupee of his wig, and was, indeed, in his whole dress, become a very\nsmart shaver. I congratulated him on his prospect with a satirical\nsmile, which he understood very well; and, shaking his head, observed, I\nhad very little faith, but the truth would come to light in spite of my\nincredulity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nI go to Surgeons' Hall, when I meet Mr. Jackson-am examined--a fierce\ndispute arises between two of the examiners--Jackson disguises himself\nto attract respect--irises himself to attract respect--is detected--in\nhazard of being sent to Bridewell--he treats us at a Tavern--carries us\nto a Night-house--A troublesome adventure there--we are committed to the\nRound-house--carried before a Justice--his behaviour\n\nWith the assistance of this faithful adherent, who gave me almost all\nthe money he earned, I preserved my half-guinea entire till the day\nof examination, when I went with a quaking heart to Surgeons' Hall,\nin order to undergo that ceremony. Among a crowd of young fellows\nwho walked in the outward hall, I perceived Mr. Jackson, to whom I\nimmediately went up; and, inquiring into the state of his love affair,\nunderstood it was still undetermined, by reason of his friend's absence,\nand the delay of the recall at Chatham, which put it out of his power\nto bring it to a conclusion. I then asked what his business was in this\nplace; he replied, he was resolved to have two strings to his bow, that\nin case the one failed, he might use the other; and, with this view, he\nwas to pass that night for a higher qualification. At that instant,\na young fellow came out from the place of examination, with a pale\ncountenance, his lip quivering, and his looks as wild as if he had seen\na ghost. He no sooner appeared, than we all flocked about him with the\nutmost eagerness to know what reception he had met with; which, after\nsome pause, he described, recounting all the questions they had asked,\nwith the answers he made. In this manner we obliged no less than twelve\nto recapitulate, which, now the danger was past, they did with pleasure,\nbefore it fell to my lot: at length the beadle called my name, with\na voice that made me tremble. However, there was no remedy. I was\nconducted into a large hall, where I saw about a dozen of grim faces\nsitting at a long table: one of whom bade me come forward, in such an\nimperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my\nsenses. The first question he put to me was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere was you born?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To\nwhich I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Scotland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that\nvery well--we have scarce any other countrymen to examine here--you\nScotchmen have overspread us of late as the locusts did Egypt. I ask\nyou in what part of Scotland was you born?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I named the place of my\nnativity, which he had never heard of; he then proceeded to interrogate\nme about my age, the town where I served my time, with the term of my\napprenticeship; and when I informed him that I served three years only,\nhe fell into a violent passion, swore it was a shame and a scandal\nto send such raw boys into the world as surgeons; that it was great\npresumption in me, and all affront upon the English, to pretend\nsufficient skill in my business, having served so short a time, when\nevery apprentice in England was bound seven years at least: that\nmy friends would have done better if they had made me a weaver or\nshoemaker; but their pride would have me a gentleman, he supposed, at\nany rate, and their poverty could not afford the necessary education.\nThis exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my spirits;\nbut on the contrary, reduced me to such a situation that I was scarcely\nable to stand; which being perceived by a plump gentleman who sat\nopposite to me with a skull before him, he said, Mr. Snarler was too\nsevere upon the young man; and, turning towards me, told me I need not\nbe afraid, for nobody would do me any harm: then, bidding me take time\nto recollect myself, he examined me, touching the operation of the\ntrepan, and was very well satisfied with my answers. The next person\nwho questioned me was a wag, who began by asking if I had ever seen\namputation performed; and I replying in the affirmative, he shook his\nhead and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! upon a dead subject, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cduring an engagement at sea, a man should be brought to you with\nhis head shot off, how would you behave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d After some hesitation, I owned\nsuch a case had never come under my observation, neither did I remember\nto have seen any method of care proposed for such an accident, in any of\nthe systems of surgery I had perused.\n\nWhether it was owing to the simplicity of my answer, or the archness\nof the question, I know not, but every member at the board deigned to\nsmile, except Mr. Snarler, who seemed to have very little of the 'animal\nrisible' in his constitution. The facetious member, encouraged by the\nsuccess of his last joke, went on thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose you was called to a\npatient of a plethoric habit, who has been bruised by a fall, what would\nyou do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would bleed him immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore you had tied up his arm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But this stroke of wit not answering\nhis expectation, he desired me to advance to the gentleman who sat next\nhim; and who, with a pert air, asked, what method of cure I would follow\nin wounds of the intestines. I repeated the method of care as it is\nprescribed by the best chirurgical writers, which he heard to an\nend, and then said with a supercilious smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you think with such\ntreatment the patient might recover?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him I saw nothing to make\nme think otherwise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't answer for\nyour foresight, but did you ever know a case of this kind succeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nacknowledged I did not, and was about to tell him I had never seen a\nwounded intestine; but he stopt me, by saying, with some precipitation,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor never will! I affirm that all wounds of the intestines, whether\ngreat or small, are mortal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the fat\ngentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is very good authority--\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he was interrupted by\nthe other with--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, excuse me, I despise all authority--Nullius\nin verbo--I stand on my own bottom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut sir, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his\nantagonist, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe reason of the thing shows--\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cA fig for reason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cries this sufficient member; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI laugh at reason; give me ocular\ndemonstratio.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm, and observed,\nthat no man acquainted with the anatomy of the parts would advance such\nan extravagant assertion. This inuendo enraged the other so much, that\nhe started up, and in a furious tone exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, Sir! do you\nquestion my knowledge in anatomy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time, all the examiners had espoused the opinion of one or other\nof the disputants, and raised their voices altogether, when the chairman\ncommanded silence, and ordered me to withdraw. In less than a quarter of\nan hour, I was called in again, received my qualification scaled up, and\nwas ordered to pay five shillings. I laid down my half-guinea upon the\ntable, and stood some time, until one of them bade me begone; to this I\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will when I have got my change:\u00e2\u0080\u009d upon which another threw me\nfive shillings and sixpence, saying, I should not be a true Scotchman\nif I went away without my change. I was afterwards obliged to give three\nshillings and sixpence to the beadles, and a shilling to an old woman\nwho swept the hall: this disbursement sank my finances to thirteen-pence\nhalfpenny, with which I was sneaking off, when Jackson, perceiving it,\ncame up to me, and begged I would tarry for him, and he would accompany\nme to the other end of the town, as soon as his examination should be\nover. I could not refuse this to a person that was so much my friend;\nbut I was astonished at the change of his dress which was varied in\nhalf-an-hour from what I have already described to a very grotesque\nfashion. His head was covered with an old smoke tie-wig that did not\nboast one crooked hair, and a slouched hat over it, which would have\nvery well become a chimney-sweeper, or a dustman; his neck was adorned\nwith a black crape, the ends of which he had twisted, and fixed in the\nbutton-hole of a shabby greatcoat that wrapped up his whole body; his\nwhite silk stockings were converted into black worsted hose: and his\ncountenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles, and a beard of his\nown painting. When I expressed my surprise at this metamorphosis, he\nlaughed, and told me it was done by the advice and assistance of a\nfriend, who lived over the way, and would certainly produce something\nvery much to his advantage; for it gave him the appearance of age, which\nnever fails of attracting respect. I applauded his sagacity, and waited\nwith impatience for the effects of it. At length he was called in; but\nwhether the oddness of his appearance excited a curiosity more than\nsmall in the board, or his behaviour was not suitable to his figure, I\nknow not, he was discovered to be an imposter, and put into the hands of\nthe beadle in order to be sent to Bridewell. So that instead of seeing\nhim come out with a cheerful countenance, and a surgeon's qualification\nin his hand, I perceived him led through the outer hall as a prisoner;\nand was very much alarmed, and anxious to know the occasion; when he\ncalled with a lamentable voice, and a piteous aspect to me, and some\nothers who know him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's sake, gentlemen bear witness that I am\nthe same individual John Jackson who served as surgeon's second mate on\nboard the Elizabeth, or else I shall go to Bridewell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt would have been impossible for the most austere hermit that ever\nlived to have refrained from laughing at his appearance and address: we\ntherefore indulged ourselves a good while at his expense, and afterwards\npleaded his cause so effectually with the beadle who was gratified with\nhalf-a-crown, that the prisoner was dismissed, and in a few moments\nrenewed his former gaiety--swearing, since the board had refused his\nmoney, he would spend every shilling before he went to bed, in treating\nhis friends; at the same time inviting us all to favour him with our\ncompany. It was now ten o'clock at night, and, as I had a great way to\nwalk through streets that were utterly unknown to me, I was prevailed\non to be of their party, in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to\nmy lodgings, according to his promise. He conducted me to his friend's\nhouse, who kept a tavern over the way where we continued drinking punch,\nuntil the liquor mounted up to our heads, and made us all extremely\nfrolicsome. I, in particular, was so much elevated, that nothing would\nserve me but a wench; at which demand Jackson expressed much joy, and\nassured me I should have my desire before we parted Accordingly, when\nhe had paid the reckoning, we sallied out, roaring and singing; and were\nconducted by our leader to a place of nocturnal entertainment, where Mr.\nJackson's dress attracted the assiduities of two or three nymphs, who\nloaded him with caresses, in return for the arrack punch with which he\ntreated them, till at length sleep began to exert his power over us\nall, and our conductor called \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo pay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When the bill was brought, which\namounted to twelve shillings, he put his hand in his pocket, but might\nhave saved himself the trouble, for his purse was gone. This accident\ndisconcerted him a good deal at first; but after some recollection, he\nseized the two ladies who sat by him, one in each hand, and swore if\nthey did not immediately restore his money he would charge a constable\nwith them. The good lady at the bar, seeing what passed, whispered\nsomething to the drawer, who went out; and then with great composure,\nasked what was the matter? Jackson told her he was robbed, and swore if\nshe refused him satisfaction, he would have her and her female friends\ncommitted to Bridewell. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRobbed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried she, \u00e2\u0080\u009crobbed in my house!\nGentlemen and Ladies, I take you all to witness, this person has\nscandalised my reputation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At that instant, seeing the constable and\nwatch enter, she proceeded \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! you must not only endeavour by your\nfalse aspersions to ruin my character, but even commit an assault upon\nmy family! Mr. Constable, I charge you with this uncivil person, who\nhas been guilty of a riot here; I shall take care and bring an action\nagainst him for defamation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile I was reflecting on this melancholy event, which had made me quite\nsober, one of the ladies, being piqued at some repartee that passed\nbetween us, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are all concerned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and desired the constable\nto take us all into custody; an arrest which was performed instantly, to\nthe utter astonishment and despair of us all, except Jackson, who having\nbeen often in such scrapes, was very little concerned, and charged the\nconstable, in his turn, with the landlady and her whole bevy; upon which\nwe were carried altogether prisoners to the round-house, where Jackson\nafter a word of comfort to us, informed the constable of his being\nrobbed, to which he said he would swear next morning before the justice.\nIn a little time the constable, calling Jackson into another room, spoke\nto him thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive that you and your company are strangers, and\nam very sorry for your being involved in such an ugly business. I have\nknown this woman a great while; she has kept a notorious house in the\nneighbourhood this many years; and although often complained of as a\nnuisance, still escapes through her interest with the justices, to whom\nshe and all of her employment pay contribution quarterly for protection.\nAs she charged me with you first, her complaint will have the\npreference, and she can procure evidence to swear whatsoever she shall\nplease to desire of them; so that, unless you can make it up before\nmorning, you and your companions may think yourselves happily quit for a\nmonth's hard labour in Bridewell. Nay, if she should swear a robbery or\nan assault against you, you will be committed to Newgate and tried at\nthe next session at the Old Bailey for your life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This last piece of\ninformation had such an effect upon Jackson, that he agreed to make it\nup, provided his money might be restored. The constable told him, that,\ninstead of retrieving what he had lost, he was pretty certain it would\ncost him some more before they could come to any composition. But,\nhowever, he had compassion on him, and would, if he pleased, sound\nthem about a mutual release. The unfortunate beau thanked him for his\nfriendship, and returning to us, acquainted us with the substance of\nthis dialogue; while the constable, desiring to speak in private with\nour adversary, carried her into the next room, and pleaded, our cause\nso effectually, that she condescended to make him umpire: he accordingly\nproposed an arbitration, to which we gave our assent; and he fined each\nparty in three shillings, to be laid out in a bowl of punch, wherein\nwe drowned all animosities, to the inexpressible joy of my two late\nacquaintances and me, who had been extremely uneasy ever since Jackson\nmentioned Bridewell and Newgate. By the time we had finished our\nbowl--to which, by the bye, I had contributed my last shilling--it was\nmorning, and I proposed to move homeward, when the constable gave me to\nunderstand, he could discharge no prisoners but by order of the justice,\nbefore whom we must appear. This renewed my chagrin, and I cursed the\nhour in which I had yielded to Jackson's invitation.\n\nAbout nine o'clock, we were escorted to the house of a certain justice\nnot many miles distant from Covent Garden, who no sooner saw the\nconstable enter with a train of prisoners at his heels, than he saluted\nhim as follows: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo Mr. Constable, you are a diligent man. What den of\nrogues have you been scouring?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then looking at us, who appeared very\nmuch dejected, he continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, thieves. I see--old offenders; oh,\nyour humble servant, Mrs. Harridan! I suppose these fellows have been\ntaken robbing your house. Yes, yes, here's an old acquaintance of\nmine. You have used expedition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin returning from\ntransportation; but we shall save you that trouble for the future--the\nsurgeons will fetch you from your next transportation, at their\nexpense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I assured his worship he was mistaken in me, for he had never\nseen me in his life before. To this declaration he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow! you\nimpudent rascal, dare you say so to my face? Do you think I am to be\nimposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed? But it\nshan't avail you--you shall find me too far north for you. Here, clerk,\nwrite this fellow's mittimus. His name is Patrick Gaghagan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here Mr.\nJackson interposed, and told him I was a Scotchman lately come to town,\ndescended of a good family, and that my name was Random. The justice\nlooked upon this assertion as an outrage upon his memory, on which he\nvalued himself exceedingly; and strutting up to Jackson, with a fierce\ncountenance, put his hands in his side, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are you, sir?\nDo you give me the lie? Take notice, gentlemen, here's a fellow who\naffronts me upon the bench but I'll lay you fast, sirrah, I will--for\nnotwithstanding your laced jacket, I believe you are a notorious felon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n My friend was so much abashed at this menace, which was thundered\nout with great vociferation, that he changed colour, and remained\nspeechless. This confusion his worship took for a symptom of guilt, and,\nto complete the discovery, continued his threats, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, I am convinced\nyou are a thief--your face discovers it, you tremble all over, your\nconscience won't lie still--you'll be hanged, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d raising his\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou'll be hanged; and happy had it been for the world, as well\nas for your own miserable soul, if you had been detected, and cut off\nin the beginning of your career. Come hither, clerk, and take this man's\nconfession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was in an agony of consternation, when the constable,\ngoing into another room with his worship, acquainted him with the\ntruth of the story; which having learned, he returned with a smiling\ncountenance, and, addressing himself to us all, said it was always his\nway to terrify young people when they came before him, that his threats\nmight make a strong impression on their minds, and deter them from\nengaging in scenes of riot and debauchery, which commonly ended before\nthe judge. Thus, having cloaked his own want of discernment under the\ndisguise of paternal care, we were dismissed, and I found myself as much\nlightened as if a mountain had been lifted off my breast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nI carry my qualification to the Navy Office--the nature of it--the\nbehaviour of the Secretary--Strap's concern for my absence--a battle\nbetwixt him a blacksmith--the troublesome consequences of it--his\nharangue to me--his friend the schoolmaster recommends me to a French\nApothecary, who entertains me as a journeyman\n\nI would most willingly have gone home to sleep, but was told by my\ncompanions, that we must deliver our letters of qualification at the\nNavy office, before one o'clock. Accordingly, we went thither, and gave\nthem to the secretary, who opened and read them, and I was mightily\npleased to find myself qualified for second mate of a third-rate. When\nhe had stuck them all together on a file, one of our company asked if\nthere were any vacancies; to which interrogation he answered \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then\nI ventured to inquire if many ships were to be put in commission soon.\nAt which question he surveyed me with a look of ineffable contempt;\nand, pushing us out of his office, locked the door without deigning\nus another word. We went down stairs, and conferred together on our\nexpectations, when I understood that each of them had been recommended\nto one or other of the commissioners, and each of them promised the\nfirst vacancy that should fall; but that none of them relied solely upon\nthat interest, without a present to the secretary, with whom some of the\ncommissioners went snacks. For which reason, each of them had provided\na small purse; and I was asked what I proposed to give. This was a\nvexatious question to me who (far from being in a capacity to gratify\na ravenous secretary) had not wherewithal to purchase a dinner. I\ntherefore answered, I had not yet determined what to give; and sneaked\noff toward my own lodging, lamenting my fate all the way, and inveighing\nwith much bitterness against the barbarity of my grandfather, and the\nsordid avarice of my relations, who left me a prey to contempt and\nindigence.\n\nFull of these disagreeable reflections, I arrived at the house where I\nlodged, and relieved my landlord from great anxiety on my account; for\nthis honest man believed I had met with some dismal accident, and that\nhe never should see me again. Strap, who had come to visit me in\nthe morning, understanding I had been abroad all night, was almost\ndistracted, and after having obtained leave of his master, had gone in\nquest of me, though he was even more ignorant of the town than I. Not\nbeing willing to inform the landlord of my adventure, I told him I had\nmet an acquaintance at Surgeons' Hall, with whom I spent the evening and\nnight; but being very much infested with bugs, I had not slept much, and\ntherefore intended to take a little repose; so saying, I went to bed,\nand desired to be awakened if Strap should happen to come wile I should\nbe asleep. I was accordingly roused by my friend himself, who entered my\nchamber about three o'clock in the afternoon, and presented a figure to\nmy eyes that I could scarce believe real. In short, this affectionate\nshaver, setting out towards Surgeons' Hall, had inquired for me there\nto no purpose: from whence he found his way to the Navy Office, where\nhe could hear no tidings of me, because I was unknown to everybody then\npresent; he afterwards went upon 'Change, in hopes of seeing me upon the\nScotch walk, but without success. At last, being almost in despair\nof finding me, he resolved to ask everybody he met in the street, if\nperchance anyone could give him information about me! and actually\nput his resolution in practice, in spite of the scoffs, curses, and\nreproaches with which he was answered; until a blacksmith's 'prentice\nseeing him stop a porter with a burden on his back, and hearing his\nquestion, for which he received a hearty curse, called to him, and asked\nif the person he inquired after was not a Scotchman? Strap replied with\ngreat eagerness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, and had on a brown coat, with long skirts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nsame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the blacksmith. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw him pass by an hour ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you\nso?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Strap, rubbing his hands, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdd! I am very glad of that--which\nway went he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTowards Tyburn in a cart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you make good\nspeed, you may get thither time enough to see him hanged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This piece of\nwit incensed my friend to such a degree, that he called the blacksmith\nscoundrel, and protested he would fight him for half-a-farthing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\nno!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other, stripping; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll have none of your money--you\nSootchmen seldom carry anything about you; but I'll fight you for love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Were was a ring immediately formed by the mob: and Strap, finding he\ncould not get off honourably without fighting, at the same time burning\nwith resentment against his adversary, quitted his clothes to the care\nof the multitude, and the battle began with great violence on the side\nof Strap, who in a few minutes exhausted his breath and spirits on his\npatient antagonist, who sustained the assault with great coolness, till\nfinding the barber quite spent, he returned the blows he had lent him,\nwith such interest, that Strap, after having received three falls on the\nhard stones, gave out, and allowed the blacksmith to be the better man.\n\nThe victory being thus decided, it was proposed to adjourn to a cellar\nhard by, and drink friends. But when my friend began to gather up his\nclothes, he perceived that some honest person or other had made free\nwith his shirt, neckcloth, hat, and wig, which were carried off; and\nprobably his coat and waistcoat would have met with the same fate, had\nthey been worth stealing. It was in vain for him to make a noise, which\nonly yielded mirth to the spectators; he was fain to get off in this\nmanner, which he accomplished with much difficulty and appeared before\nme all besmeared with blood and dirt. Notwithstanding this misfortune,\nsuch was his transport at finding me safe and sound, that he had almost\nstifled and stunk me to death with his embraces. After he had cleaned\nhimself, and put on one of my shirts, and a woollen nightcap, I\nrecounted to him the particulars of my night's campaign, which\nfilled him with admiration, and made him repeat with great energy an\nobservation which was often in his mouth, namely, 'that surely London is\nthe devil's drawing-room.' As neither of us had dined, he desired me\nto get up, and the milkwoman coming round at that instant, he went\ndownstairs, and brought up a quart, with a penny loaf, on which we made\na comfortable meal. He then shared his money with me, which amounted to\neighteen-pence, and left me with an intention to borrow an old wig and\nhat of his friend the schoolmaster.\n\nHe was no sooner gone, than I began to consider my situation with great\nuneasiness, and revolved all the schemes my imagination could suggest,\nin order to choose and pursue some one that would procure me bread; for\nit is impossible to express the pangs I felt, when I reflected on the\nmiserable dependence in which I lived at the expense of a poor barber's\nboy, My pride took the alarm, and having no hopes of succeeding at the\nNavy Office, I came to a resolution of enlisting in the foot-guards next\nday, be the event what it would. This extravagant design, by flattering\nmy disposition, gave great satisfaction; and I was charging the enemy at\nthe head of my own regiment, when Strap's return interrupted my reverie.\nThe schoolmaster had made him a present of the tie-wig which he wore,\nwhen I was introduced to him, together with an old hat, whose brims\nwould have overshadowed a Colossus. Though Strap had ventured to\nwear them in the dusk, he did not choose to entertain the mob by day;\ntherefore went to work immediately, and reduced them both to a moderate\nsize. While he was employed in this office, he addressed me thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo\nbe sure, Mr. Random, you are born a gentleman, and have a great deal of\nlearning--and, indeed, look like a gentleman; for, as to person, you may\nhold up your head with the best of them. On the other hand, I am a poor\nbut honest cobbler's son: my mother was as industrious a woman as ever\nbroke bread, till such time as she took to drinking, which you very well\nknow; but everybody has failings--Humanum est errare. Now myself, I am\na poor journeyman barber, tolerably well made and understand some Latin,\nand have a smattering of Greek; but what of that? Perhaps I might\nalso say, that I know a little of the world; but that is to no\npurpose,--though you be gentle, and I simple, it does not follow, but\nthat I who am simple may do a good office to you who are gentle. Now\nthis is the case: my kinsman, the schoolmaster--perhaps you did not know\nhe how nearly he is related to me--I'll satisfy you in that presently;\nhis mother and my grandmother's sister's nephew--no, that's not it!--my\ngrandfather's brother's daughter--rabbit it! I have forgot the\ndegree. But this I know, he and I are cousins seven times removed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d My\nimpatience to know the good office he had done me, got the better of my\ntemper, and I interrupted him at this place with the exclamation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nthe schoolmaster or you can be of any advantage to me, why don't you\ntell me without all this preamble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I pronounced these words\nwith some vehemence, Strap looked at me for same time with a grave\ncountenance, and then went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm very sorry to see such an alteration\nin your temper of late; you were always fiery, but now you are grown\nas crabbed as old Periwinkle the drunken tinker, on whom you and I (God\nforgive us!) played so many unlucky tricks while we were at school--but\nI will no longer detain you in suspense, because (doubtless) nothing\nis more uneasy than doubt--Dubio procul dubio nil dubius. My friend or\nrelation, or which you will, or both, the schoolmaster, being informed\nof the regard I have for you; for you may be sure I did not fail to let\nhim know of your good qualities--by the bye, he has undertaken to teach\nyou the pronunciation of the English tongue, without which, he says, you\nwill be unfit for business in this country--I say my relation has spoke\nin your behalf to a French apothecary who wants a journeyman; and on\nhis recommendation you may have fifteen pounds a year, bed and board,\nwhenever you please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was too much interested in this piece of news\nto entertain it with indifference; but, jumping up, insisted on Strap's\nimmediately accompanying me to the house of his friend, that I might not\nlose this opportunity through the least delay or neglect on my part.\n\nWe were informed, that the schoolmaster was in company at a publichouse\nin the neighbourhood, whither we repaired, and found him drinking with\nthe very individual apothecary in question. When he was called to the\ndoor at our desire, and observed my impatience, he broke out into his\nusual term of admiration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I suppose, when you heard of this offer,\nyou did not take leisure enough to come downstairs, but leaped out of\nthe window: did you overturn no porter nor oyster-woman in your way? It\nwas a mercy of God you did not knock your brains out against some post\nin your career. Oh, my conscience! I believe, had I been in the inmost\nrecesses of my habitation--the very penetralia--your eagerness would\nhave surmounted bolts, bars, decency, and everything. The den of Cacus,\nor sanctum sanctorum, could not have hid me from you. But come along\nthe gentleman of whom I spoke is in the house; I will present you to\nhim forthwith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I entered the room, I perceived four or five people\nsmoking, one of whom the schoolmaster accosted thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Lavement,\nhere's the young man of whom I spoke to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The apothecary, who was\na little old withered man, with a forehead about an inch high, a nose\nturned up at the end, large cheek-bones that helped to form a pit for\nhis little gray eyes, a great bag of loose skin hanging down on each\nside in wrinkles, like the alforjos of a baboon, and a mouth so much\naccustomed to that contraction which produces grinning, that he could\nnot pronounce a syllable without discovering the remains of his teeth,\nwhich consisted of four yellow fangs, not improperly, by anatomists,\ncalled canine. This person, I say, after having eyed me some time,\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOho, 'tis ver well, Monsieur Concordance; young man, you are\nver welcome, take one coup of bierre--and come to mine house to-morrow\nmorning; Monsieur Concordance vil show you de way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon this I made my\nbow, and as I went out of the room could hear him say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMa foi! c'est un\nbeau garcon; c'est un gaillard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs I had by my own application, while I served Crab, acquired the\nFrench tongue well enough to read authors written in that language\nand understand anything that occurred in conversation, I determined\nto pretend ignorance to my new master, that he and his family, whom I\nsupposed to be of the same country, not being on the reserve before me,\nI might possibly discover something in discourse, which would either\nyield me amusement or advantage. Next morning Mr. Concordance carried me\nto the apothecary's house, where the bargain was made, and orders given\nto provide an apartment for me immediately. But before I entered upon\nbusiness the schoolmaster recommended me to his tailor, who gave me\ncredit for a suit of clothes, to be paid out of the first moiety of\nmy wages, and they were begun upon that very day; he afterwards\naccommodated me with a new hat on the same term: so that in a few days\nI hoped to make a very fashionable appearance. In the meantime, Strap\nconveyed my baggage to the place allotted for me, which was a back room\nup two pair of stairs, furnished with a pallet for me to lie upon, a\nchair without a back, a bottle by way of candlestick, and a triangular\npiece of glass instead of a mirror; the rest of its ornaments having\nbeen lately removed to one of the garrets, for the convenience of the\nservant of an Irish captain, who lodged in the first floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe character of Mr. Lavement, his wife and daughter--some anecdotes\nof the family--the mother and daughter rivals--I am guilty of a mistake\nthat gives me present satisfaction, but is attended with troublesome\nconsequences\n\nNext day, while I was at work in the shop, a bouncing damsel well\ndressed came on pretence of finding a vial for some use or other; and\ntaking an opportunity, when she thought I did not mind her, of observing\nme narrowly, went away with a silent look of disdain. I easily guessed\nher sentiments, and my pride took the resolution of entertaining the\nsame indifference and neglect towards her. At dinner the maids, with\nwhom I dined in the kitchen, gave me to understand that this was my\nmaster's only daughter, who would have a very handsome fortune, on\naccount of which, and her beauty, a great many young gentlemen made\ntheir addresses to her--that she had been twice on the brink of\nmarriage, but disappointed by the stinginess of her father, who refused\nto part with a shilling to promote the match; for which reason the young\nlady did not behave to her father with all the filial veneration that\nmight be expected. In particular she harboured the most perfect hatred\nfor his countrymen; in which disposition she resembled her mother, who\nwas an English-woman; and, by the hints they dropped, I learned the gray\nmare was the better horse--that she was a matron of a high spirit, which\nwas often manifested at the expense of her dependents; that she loved\ndiversions, and looked upon miss as her rival in all parties--which was\nindeed the true cause of her disappointments; for had the mother been\nhearty in her interest, the father would not have ventured to refuse her\ndemands. Over and above this intelligence, I, of myself, soon made more\ndiscoveries. Mr. Lavement's significant grins at his wife, while she\nlooked another way, convinced me that he was not at all content with his\nlot; and his behaviour in presence of the captain made me believe his\nchief torment was jealousy. As for my own part, I was considered in no\nother light than that of a menial servant, and had been already six days\nin the house without being honoured with one word from either mother or\ndaughter; the latter (as I understood from the maids) having at table\none day expressed some surprise that her papa should entertain such\nan awkward mean-looking journeyman. I was nettled at this piece of\ninformation, and next Sunday (it being my turn to take my diversion)\ndressed myself in my new clothes to the greatest advantage, and, vanity\napart, made no contemptible figure.\n\nAfter having spent most part of the day in company with Strap and some\nof his acquaintance, I came home in the afternoon, and was let in by\nmiss, who not knowing me, dropped a low curtsey as I advanced, which\nI returned with a profound bow, and shut the door. By the time I had\nturned about, she had perceived her mistake, and changed colour, but\ndid not withdraw. The passage being narrow, I could not get away without\njolting her; so I was forced to remain where I was with my eyes fixed\nto the ground, and my face glowing with blushes. At length, her vanity\ncoming to her assistance, she went away tittering, and I could hear her\npronounce the word 'creature!' From this day forward, she came into the\nshop fifty times, every day upon various pretences, and put in practice\nso many ridiculous airs, that I could easily perceive her opinion of\nme was changed, and that she did not think me altogether an unworthy\nconquest. But my heart was so steeled against her charms by pride and\nresentment, which were two chief ingredients in my disposition, that I\nremained insensible to all her arts; and notwithstanding some advances\nshe made, could not be prevailed upon to yield her the least attention.\nThis neglect soon banished all the favourable impressions she felt for\nme, and the rage of a slighted woman took place in her heart; this she\nmanifested not only in all the suggestions her malice could invent to\nmy prejudice with her father, but also in procuring for me such servile\nemployments as she hoped would sufficiently humble my spirit. One day in\nparticular, she ordered me to brush my master's coat; but I refusing, a\nsmart dialogue ensued, which ended in her bursting into tears of rage;\nwhen her mother interposing, and examining into the merits of the cause,\ndetermined it in my favour: and this good office I owed not to any\nesteem or consideration she had for me, but solely to the desire of\nmortifying her daughter, who on this occasion observed, that let people\nbe never so much in the right, there were some folks who would never do\nthem justice, but, to be sure, they had their reasons for it, which some\npeople were ignorant of, although they despised their little arts. This\ninsinuation of some people and some folks put me upon observing the\nbehaviour of my mistress more narrowly for the future: and it was not\nlong before I had reason to believe that she looked upon her daughter as\na rival in the affections of Captain O'Donnell, who lodged in the house.\n\nIn the meantime, my industry and knowledge gained me the goodwill of my\nmaster, who would often say in French, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMardy! c'est un bon garcon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He had a great deal of business; but he was mostly employed among\nhis fellow refugees, his profits were small. However, his expense for\nmedicines was not great; for he was the most expert man at a succedaneum\nof any apothecary in London, so that I have been sometimes amazed to see\nhim, without the least hesitation, make up a physician's prescription,\nthough he had not in his shop one medicine mentioned in it.\nOyster-shells he could convert into crab's eyes; common oil into oil\nof sweet almonds; syrup of sugar into balsamic syrup; Thames water into\naqua cinnamoni; and a hundred more costly preparations were produced in\nan instant, from the cheapest and coarsest drugs of the materia medica:\nand when any common thing was ordered for a patient, he always took care\nto disguise it in colour or taste, or both, in such a manner that it\ncould not possibly be known; for which purpose cochineal and oil of\ncloves were of great service. Mr. Lavement had attempted more than once\nto introduce a vegetable diet into his family, by launching out into\nthe praise of roots and greens, and decrying the use of flesh, both as\na physician and philosopher; but all his rhetoric could not make one\nproselyte to his opinion, and even the wife of his bosom declared\nagainst the proposal.\n\nOne afternoon, when her husband was abroad, and his daughter gone to\nvisit, this lady ordered me to call a hackney-coach, in which she and\nthe captain drove towards Covent Garden. Miss came home in the evening,\nand, supping at her usual hour, went to bed. About eleven o'clock my\nmaster entered, and asked if his wife was gone to sleep: upon which\nI told him, my mistress went out in the afternoon, and was not yet\nreturned. This was like a clap of thunder to the poor apothecary, who\nstarting back, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMort de ma vie! vat you tell a me? My vife not at\nhome!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At that instant a patient's servant arrived with a prescription\nfor a draught, which my master taking, went into the shop to make it up\nwith his own hand. While he rubbed the ingredients in a glass mortar,\nhe inquired of me, whether or no his wife went out alone; and no sooner\nheard that she was in company with the captain, than with one blow he\nsplit the mortar into a thousand pieces, and grinning like the head of\na bass viol, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, traitresse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d It would have been impossible\nfor me to have preserved my gravity a minute longer, when I was happily\nrelieved by a rap at the door, which I opened, and perceived my mistress\ncoming out of the coach. She flounced immediately into the shop, and\naddressed her husband thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you thought I was lost, my dear.\nCaptain O'Donnell has been so good as to treat me with a play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nreply, it may be supposed, was anything but courteous but the captain,\nwho had been all the time at the door discharging the coach, entered,\nand Mr. Lavement, changing his tone, saluted him with all the usual\npolitesse of a Frenchman.\n\nShortly after this event, by the knowledge which I acquired of the\nfamily secrets, my life became much more agreeable; and as I every\nday improved in my knowledge of the town I shook off my awkward air by\ndegrees, and acquired the character of a polite journeyman apothecary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nI am assaulted and dangerously wounded-suspect O'Donnell, and am\nconfirmed in my opinion--concert a scheme of revenge, and put it into\nexecution--O'Donnell robs his own servant and disappears--make my\naddresses to a lady, and am miraculously delivered from her snare\n\nOne night, at about twelve o'clock, as I returned from visiting a\npatient at Chelsea, I received a blow on my head from an unseen hand,\nthat stretched me senseless on the ground; and was left for dead with\nthree stabs of a sword in my body. The groans I uttered when I recovered\nthe use of my reason alarmed the people of a solitary alehouse that\nstood near the spot where I lay: and they were humane enough to take me\nin, and send for a surgeon, who dressed my wounds, and assured me they\nwere not mortal. One of them penetrated through the skin and muscles\nof one side of my belly in such a manner, that doubtless the assassin\nimagined he had run me through the entrails. The second slanted along\none of my ribs; and the last, which was intended for the finishing\nstroke, having been directed to my heart, the sword snapped upon\nmy breast-bone, and the point remained sticking in the skin. When I\nreflected upon this event, I could not persuade myself that I had been\nassaulted by a common footpad, because it is not usual for such people\nto murder though they rob, especially when they meet with no resistance;\nand I found my money, and everything else about me but my carcase,\nsafe. I concluded, therefore, that I must either have been mistaken for\nanother, or obliged to the private resentment of some secret enemy for\nwhat had happened; and as I could remember nobody who had the least\ncause of complaint against me, except Captain O'Donnell and my master's\ndaughter, my suspicion settled upon them, though I took care to conceal\nit, that I might the sooner arrive at confirmation.\n\nWith this view, I went home in the chair about ten o'clock in the\nmorning; and as the chairman supported me into the house, met the\ncaptain in the passage, who no sooner saw me than he started back and\ngave evident signs of guilty confusion, which he would have accounted\nfor from surprise occasioned by the seeing me in such a condition. My\nmaster having heard my story, condoled me with a good deal of sympathy,\nand when he understood my wounds were not dangerous, ordered me to be\ncarried upstairs to bed; though not without some opposition from his\nwife, who was of opinion that it would be better for me to go to an\nhospital, where I should be more carefully attended. My meditation was\nemployed in concerting with myself some method of revenge against Squire\nO'Donnell and his inamorata, whom I looked upon as the author of my\nmisfortune; when miss, who was not at home at my arrival, entered my\nchamber, and saying she was sorry for the accident that had befallen me,\nasked if I suspected anybody to be the assassin; upon which I fixed my\neyes steadfastly upon her and answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She discovered no symptom\nof confusion, but replied hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that be the case, why don't\nyou take out a warrant, to have him apprehended? It will cost but a\ntrifle--if you have no money, I'll lend you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This frankness not only\ncured me of my suspicion with respect to her, but even staggered my\nbelief with regard to the captain, of whose guilt I resolved to have\nfurther proof before I should enterprise anything in the way of revenge.\nI thanked her kindly for her generous offer, which, however, I had no\noccasion to accept, being determined to do nothing rashly: for though I\ncould plainly perceive the person who attacked me to be a soldier,\nwhose face I thought was familiar to me, I could not swear with a safe\nconscience to any particular man; and, granting I could, my prosecution\nof him would not much avail.\n\nThis uncertainty I pretended, lest the captain, hearing from her that I\nknew the person who wounded me, might think proper to withdraw before I\ncould be in a condition to requite him. In two days I was up and able\nto do a little business, so that Mr. Lavement made shift to carry on his\npractice without hiring another journeyman in my room.\n\nThe first thing I attempted towards a certain discovery of my secret\nenemy, was to get into O'Donnell's apartment, while he was abroad in an\nundress, and examine his sword, the point of which being broken off, I\napplied the fragment that was found sticking in my body, and found it\nanswered the fractured part exactly. There was no room left for doubt;\nand all that remained was to fix upon a scheme of revenge, which almost\nsolely engrossed my thoughts during the space of eight nights and days.\nSometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the same manner as he had\npractised upon me, and kill him outright. But this assault my honour\nopposed as a piece of barbarous cowardice, in which he was not to\nbe imitated. At other times I entertained thoughts of demanding\nsatisfaction in an honourable way; but was diverted from this\nundertaking by considering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature\nof the injury he had done me, which did not entitle him to such easy\nterms. At last I determined to pursue a middle course, and actually put\nmy design in execution after this manner. Having secured the assistance\nof Strap and two of his acquaintance whom he could depend upon, we\nprovided ourselves with disguises, and I caused the following letter\nto be delivered to him by one of our associates in livery, one Sunday\nevening:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir--If I may be allowed to judge from appearance, it will not be\ndisagreeable for you to hear that my husband is gone to Bagshot to visit\na patient, and will not return till to-morrow night; so that, if you\nhave anything to propose to me (as your behaviour on many occasions\nhas seemed to insinuate), you will do well to embrace the present\nopportunity of seeing, Yours, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This letter was signed with the\nname of an apothecary's wife who lived in Chelsea, of whom I had heard\nO'Donnell was an admirer. Everything succeeded to our wish. The hero\nhastened towards the place of appointment, and was encountered by us\nin the very place where he had assaulted me. We rushed upon him all\nat once, secured his sword, stripped off his clothes even to the skin,\nwhich was scourged with nettles till he was blistered from head to foot,\nnotwithstanding all the eloquence of his tears and supplications. When\nI was satisfied with the stripes I had bestowed, we carried off his\nclothes, which we hid in a hedge near the place, and left him stark\nnaked to find his way home in the best manner he could, while I took\ncare to be there before him. I afterwards understood that, in his way\nto the lodgings of a friend, who lived in the skirts of the town, he was\npicked up by the watch, who carried him to the round-house, from whence\nhe sent for clothes to his lodgings, and next morning arrived at the\ndoor in a chair, wrapt up in a blanket he had borrowed; for his body\nwas so sore and swelled, that he could not bear to be confined in\nhis wearing apparel. He was treated with the utmost tenderness by my\nmistress and her daughter, who vied with each other in their care and\nattendance of him; but Lavement himself could not forbear expressing\nhis joy, by several malicious grins, while he ordered me to prepare an\nunguent for his sores. As to myself, nobody can doubt my gratification,\nwhen I had every day an opportunity of seeing my revenge protracted on\nthe body of my adversary, by the ulcers of which I had been the cause;\nand, indeed, I not only enjoyed the satisfaction of having flea'd him\nalive, but another also which I had not foreseen. The story of his being\nattacked and stripped in such a place having been inserted in the news,\ngave information to those who found his clothes next day, whither to\nbring them; and accordingly he retrieved everything he had lost except a\nfew letters, among which was that which I had writ to him in the name\nof the apothecary's wife. This, and the others, which were all on the\nsubject of love (for this Hibernian hero was one of those people who are\ncalled fortune-hunters), fell into the hands of a certain female author,\nfamous for the scandal she has published; who, after having embellished\nthem with some ornaments of her own invention, gave them to the to town\nin print. I was very much shocked on reflection, that I might possibly\nbe the occasion of a whole family's unhappiness on account of the letter\nI had written; but was eased of that apprehension, when I understood\nthat the Chelsea apothecary had commenced a lawsuit against the\nprinter for defamation, and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery\ncommitted by the author, who had disappeared. But whatever might be his\nopinion of the matter, our two ladies seemed to entertain a different\nidea of it: for as soon as the pamphlet appeared, I could perceive their\ncare of their patient considerably diminish, till at last it ended in a\ntotal neglect. It was impossible for him to be ignorant of this change,\nany more than of the occasion of it; but as he was conscious to himself\nof having deserved worse than contempt at their hands, he was glad to\ncome off so cheaply, and contented himself with muttering curses and\nthreats against the apothecary, who, as he imagined, having got an\ninkling of the appointment with his wife, had taken revenge of him\nin the manner described. By the time he had got a new scarf skin his\ncharacter was become so notorious, that he thought it high time for him\nto decamp; and his retreat he performed in one night, without beat of\ndrum, after having robbed his own servant of everything that belonged to\nhim except the clothes he had on his back.\n\nA few days after he disappeared, Mr. Lavement, for his own security,\ntook into his custody a large old trunk which he had left; and as it\nwas very heavy, made no question that the contents were sufficient to\nindemnify him for what O'Donnell owed in lodging. But a month being\nelapsed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer, and my master\nbeing impatient to know what the trunk contained, he ordered me to break\nit open in his presence, which task I performed with the pestle of our\ngreat mortar, and discovered, to his inexpressible astonishment and\nmortification, a heap of stones.\n\nAbout this time, my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go\nabroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chambre and at the same\ntime assured me that, whatever advantage he might propose to himself\nfrom this prospect, he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me,\nso much was he attached to my fortune. In spite of all the obligations I\nowed to this poor, honest fellow, ingratitude is so natural to the heart\nof man, that I began to be tired of his acquaintance: and now that I had\ncontracted other friendships which appeared more creditable, was\neven ashamed to see a journeyman barber inquiring after me with the\nfamiliarity of a companion. I therefore, on pretence of consulting his\nwelfare, insisted upon his accepting the proposal, which he at last\ndetermined to embrace, with great reluctance, and in a few days, took\nhis leave of me, shedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold\nwithout emotion. I now began to look upon me as of a gentleman in\nreality; learned to dance, frequented plays during the holidays; became\nthe oracle of an ale-house, where every dispute was referred to my\ndecision; and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young\nlady, who found means to make a conquest of my heart, and upon whom I\nprevailed, after much attendance and solicitation, to give me a promise\nof marriage. As this beautiful creature passed for a rich heiress, I\nblessed my good fortune, and was actually on the point of crowning all\nmy wishes by matrimony, when I made such a discovery as effectually\nturned me from my design, and I abandoned all thoughts of marriage for\nthe future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nSquire Gawky comes to lodge with my master--is involved in a troublesome\naffair, out of which he is extricated by me--he marries my master's\ndaughter--they conspire against me--I am found guilty of theft,\ndischarged--deserted by my friends, I hire a room in St. Gile's--where,\nby accident, I find the lady to whom I paid my addresses in a miserable\ncondition--I relieve her\n\nWhen I enjoyed myself at large in this temper of mind, Lavement let his\nfirst floor to my countryman and acquaintance, Squire Gawky, who by this\ntime had got a lieutenancy in the army, and such a martial ferocity in\nhis appearance that I was afraid he would remember what happened between\nus in Scotland, and atone for his breach of appointment then by his\npunctuality now; but whether he had actually forgot me, or was willing\nto make me believe so, he betrayed not the least symptom of recognition\nat sight of me, and I remained quite cured of my apprehension; though\nI had occasion not long after to be convinced, that howsoever his\nexternals might be altered, he was at bottom the same individual Gawky,\nwhom I have already described. For coming home late one night from the\nhouse of a patient, I heard a noise in the street, and as I approached,\nperceived two gentlemen in custody, of three watchmen. The prisoners,\nwho were miserable, disfigured with dirt, complained bitterly of the\nloss of their hats and wigs; and one of them, whom by his tongue I know\nto be a Scotchman, lamented most piteously, offering a guinea for his\nliberty, which the watchman refused, alleging that one of his companions\nwas wounded grievously, and that he must stand to the consequence. My\nprejudice in favour of my native country was so strong, that I could not\nbear to see anybody belonging to it in distress, and therefore, with one\nblow of my faithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold\nof the person for whom I was chiefly concerned. He was no sooner\ndisengaged, than he betook himself to his heels, and left me to maintain\nthe dispute as I should think proper; and, indeed, I came off but\nscurvily, for, before I could avail myself of my speed, I received a\nblow on the eye, from one of the other two, that had well nigh deprived\nme of the use of that organ. However, I made shift to get home, where I\nwas informed of Captain Gawky's being robbed and abused by a company of\nfootpads, and was ordered by my master to prepare an emollient glyster\nand paregoric draught, in order to allay and compose the ferment of his\nspirits, occasioned by the barbarous treatment he had undergone, while\nhe took twelve ounces of blood from him immediately.\n\nWhen I inquired into the particulars of this adventure, and understood\nby the servant that he came in just before me, without hat and wig, I\nmade no scruple of believing him to be the person I had released, and\nwas confirmed in my belief upon hearing his voice, to which (before that\nevent) I had long been a stranger.\n\nMy eye being considerably swelled and inflamed, I could not reflect\nupon my enterprise without cursing my own folly, and even resolving to\ndeclare the truth the truth of the whole story in order to be revenged\non the cowardly wretch for whom I had suffered: accordingly, next day\nafter he had told, in presence of my master, his wife and daughter,\nwho came to him, a thousand lies concerning the prowess he had shown in\nmaking his escape, I ventured to explain the mystery, and, calling\nin the evidence of my contused eye, upbraided him with cowardice and\ningratitude. Gawky was so astonished at this that he could not answer\none word, and the rest of the company stared at one another; till\nat length my mistress reprimanded me for my insolent behaviour, and\nthreatened to turn me away for my presumption. Upon which, Gawky (having\nrecollected himself) observed, as the young man might have mistaken\nanother person for him, he could forgive his insinuations, more\nespecially as he seemed to have suffered for his incivility; but\nadvised me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future, before I\nventured to publish them to the prejudice of any man. Miss applauded the\nCaptain's generosity in pardoning one who had so villainously aspersed\nhim, and I began to imagine her praise was not at all disinterested. But\nthe apothecary, who perhaps had more penetration or less partiality than\nhis wife and daughter, differed from them in their sentiments of the\nmatter, and expressed himself to me in the shop in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh mon\npauvre Roderique! you have more of de veracite dan of de prudence--bot\nmine vife and dater be diablement sage, and Monsieur le Capitaine un\nfanfaron, pardieu!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis eulogium on his wife and daughter, though spoken ironically by him,\nwas nevertheless literally just; by espousing the cause of Gawky, the\none obliged a valuable lodger, and the other acquired a husband at a\njuncture when one was absolutely necessary. The young lady insinuated\nherself so artfully into the affection of this new lodger, that in less\nthan a fortnight, on pretence of going to the play, they drove away\ntogether to the Fleet, where they were married; and in the morning came\nhome, where they asked her father's and mother's blessing. The prudent\nparents, notwithstanding the precipitation with which the match was\ncarried on, did not think fit to refuse their approbation; for the\napothecary was not ill pleased to find his daughter married to a young\nman of a good prospect, who had not mentioned one syllable on the\narticle of her dowry; and his wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival\nand a spy upon her. Whatever face Gawky put on the matter, my discovery\nof the adventure before related, and the reproaches I vented against\nhim, had stung him to the soul, and cherished the seeds of enmity so\nstrongly in his breast, that he imparted his indignation to his wife,\nwho being as desirous as himself to accomplish the ruin of one that not\nonly slighted her caresses, but was able on any occasion to discover\nparticulars not at all advantageous to her character, readily joined in\na conspiracy against me, which (had it taken effect as they expected)\nwould infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death.\n\nMy master having several times missed large quantities of medicines, of\nwhich I could give no account, at last lost all patience, and in plain\nterms taxed me with having embezzled them for my own use. As I could\nonly oppose my single asseveration to his suspicion, he told me one\nday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour vord not be give me de satisfaction--me find necessaire to\nchercher for my medicine; pardonnez moi--il faut chercber--me demand le\nclef of your coffre a cette heure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then raising his voice to conceal\nthe fright he was in lest I should make any opposition, he went on,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOui! I charge you rendez le clef of your cofrre--moi--si, moi qui\nvous parle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was fired with so much resentment and disdain at this\naccusation, that I burst into tears, which he took for a sign of guilt;\nand pulling out my key, told him he might satisfy himself immediately,\nthough he would not find it so easy to satisfy me for the injury my\nreputation had suffered from his unjust suspicion. He took the key and\nmounted up to my chamber, attended by the whole family, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEh\nbien, nous verrons--nous verrons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But what was my horror and amazement,\nwhen, opening my chest, he pulled out a handful of the very things that\nwere missing, and pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, ha, vous etes bienvenu--mardy, Mons.\nRoderique, you be fort innocent!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had not power to utter one word in\nmy own vindication, but stood motionless and silent, while everybody\npresent made their respective remarks on what appeared against me.\nThe servants said they were sorry for my misfortune, and went away\nrepeating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho would have thought it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d My mistress took occasion from\nthis detection to rail against the practice of employing strangers in\ngeneral; and Mrs. Gawky, after having observed that she never had a good\nopinion of my fidelity, proposed to have me carried before the justice\nand committed to Newgate immediately. Her husband was actually upon the\nstairs in his way for a constable, when Mr. Lavement knowing the cost\nant trouble of a prosecution to which he must bind himself, and at the\nsame time dreading lest some particulars of my confession might affect\nhis practice, called out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRestez, mon fils! restez, it be veritablement\none grand crime which dis pauvre diable have committed--bot peut-etre de\ngood God give him de penitence, and me vill not have upon mine head de\nblood of one sinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The captain and his lady used all the Christian\narguments their zeal could suggest to prevail upon the apothecary to\npursue me to destruction, and represented the injustice he did to the\ncommunity of which he was a member, in letting a villain escape, who\nwould not fail of doing more mischief in the world when he should\nreflect on his coming off so easily now; but their eloquence made no\nimpression on my master, who turning to me said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo, miserable, go\nfrom mine house quick, quick!--and make reparation for your mauvaise\nactions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By this time my indignation had roused me from the\nstupefaction in which I had hitherto remained and I began in this\nmanner:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, appearances I own condemn me; but you are imposed upon\nas much as I am abused: I have fallen a sacrifice to the rancour of that\nscoundrel\u00e2\u0080\u009d (pointing to Gawky) \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho has found means to convey your\ngoods hither, that the detection of them might blast my reputation, and\naccomplish my destruction. His hatred to me is owing to a consciousness\nof his having wronged me in my own country--for which injury he in a\ncowardly manner, refused me the satisfaction of a gentleman; he knows,\nmoreover, that I am no stranger to his dastardly behaviour in this town,\nwhich I have recounted before, and he is unwilling that such a testimony\nof his ingratitude and pusillanimity should live upon the earth; for\nthis reason he is guilty of the most infernal malice to bring about my\nruin. And I am afraid, madam (turning to Mrs. Gawky) you have too easily\nentered into the sentiments of your husband. I have often found you my\nenemy, and am well acquainted with the occasion of your being so, which\nI don't at present think proper to declare; but I would advise you, for\nyour own sake, not to drive me to extremity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This address enraged her\nso much that with a face as red us scarlet and the eyes of a fury, she\nstrutted up to me and putting her hands in her side, spat in my face,\nsaying, I was a scandalous villain, but she defied my malice; and that\nunless her papa would not prosecute me like a thief as I was, she would\nnot stay another night under his roof. At the same time, Gawky assuming\na big look, told me, he scorned what lies I could invent against him;\nbut that, if I pretended to asperse his wife, he would put me to death.\nTo this threat I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could meet with thee in a desert,\nthat I might have an opportunity of punishing thee for thy perfidy\ntowards me, and rid the world of such a rascal. What hinders me this\nmoment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, seizing an old bottle that stood by, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom doing myself\nthat justice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had no sooner armed myself in this manner, than Gawky\nand his father-in-law retired in such a hurry, that the one overturned\nthe other, and they rolled together down stairs, while my mistress\nswooned away with fear, and her daughter asked if I intended to\nmurder her. I gave her to understand, that nothing was farther from my\nintention, that I would leave her to the stings of her own conscience;\nbut was firmly resolved to slit her husband's nose, whenever fortune\nshould offer a convenient opportunity. Then going down stairs, I met\nLavement coming up trembling with the pestle in his hand, and Gawky\nbehind armed with his sword, pushing him forward. I demanded a parley:\nand having assured him of my pacific disposition, Gawky exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\nvillain! you have killed my dear wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the apothecary cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\ncoquin! vere is my shild?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis above stairs, unhurt\nby me, and will, a few months hence, I believe reward your concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Hero she called to them, and desired they would let the wretch go, and\ntrouble themselves no further about him. To which request her father\nconsented, observing, nevertheless, that my conversation was 'very\nmysterious.'\n\nFinding it impossible to vindicate my innocence, I left the house\nimmediately, and went to the schoolmaster, with an intention of clearing\nmyself to him, and asking his advice with regard to my future conduct;\nbut, to my inexpressible vexation, he was gone to the country, where\nhe would stay two or three days. I returned with a design of consulting\nsome acquaintance I had acquired in the neighbourhood; but my story had\ntaken air through the officiousness of the servants, and not one of\nmy friends would vouchsafe me a hearing. Thus I found myself, by the\niniquity of mankind, in a much more deplorable condition than ever: for\nthough I had been formerly as poor, my reputation was without blemish,\nand my health unimpaired till now; but at present my good name was lost,\nmy money gone, my friends were alienated, my body was infected by an\nodious distemper; and my faithful Strap, who alone could yield me pity\nand assistance, absent I knew not where.\n\nThe first resolution I could take in this melancholy conjuncture, was\nto remove my clothes to the house of the person with whom I had formerly\nlodged, where I remained two days in hopes of getting another place by\nthe interest of Mr. Concordance, to whom I made no doubt of being able\nto vindicate my character; but in this supposition I reckoned without\nmy best, for Lavement took care to be beforehand with me; and when I\nattempted to explain the whole affair to the schoolmaster, I found him\nso prepossessed against me, that he would scarce hear me to an end; but\nwhen I had finished my justification, shook his head, and beginning with\nhis usual exclamation said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat won't go down with me. I am very sorry\nI should have the misfortune of being concerned in the affair, but,\nhowever, shall be more cautious for the future. I will trust no man from\nhenceforward--no, not my father who begat me, nor the brother who lay\nwith me in my mother's womb: should Daniel rise from the dead, I would\nthink him an impostor; and were the genius of truth to appear, would\nquestion its veracity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him, that one day it was possible he\nmight be convinced of the injury I had suffered, and repent of his\npremature determination. To which remark he answered, the proof of my\ninnocence would make his bowels vibrate with joy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut till that shall\nhappen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mast beg to have no manner of connection\nwith you--my reputation is at stake. I shall be looked upon as your\naccomplice and abettor--people will say Jonathan Wild was but a type of\nme-boys will hoot at me as I pass along; and the cinder-wenches belch\nforth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with gin: I shall be\nnotorious--the very butt of slander, and sink of infamy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was not in\na humour to relish the climax of expressions upon which this gentleman\nvalued himself in all his discourses; but, without any ceremony, took\nmy leave, cursed with every sentiment of horror which my situation could\nsuggest. I considered, however, in the intervals of my despondence, that\nI must, in some shape suit my expense to my calamitous circumstances,\nand with that view hired an apartment in a garret near St. Giles's, at\nthe rate of nine-pence per week.\n\nI one day, when I sat in this solitary retreat musing upon the\nunhappiness of my fate, was alarmed by a groan that issued from a\nchamber contiguous to mine, into which I immediately ran, and found a\nwoman stretched on a miserable truckle bed, without any visible signs of\nlife. Having applied a smelling bottle to her nose, the blood began to\nrevisit her cheeks, and she opened her eyes; but, good heaven! what were\nthe emotions of my soul, when I discovered her to be the same individual\nlady who had triumphed over my heart, and to whose fate I had almost\nbeen inseparably joined! Her deplorable situation filled my breast with\ncompassion. She knew me immediately; and, straining me gently in her\narms, shed a torrent of tears, which I could not help increasing. At\nlength, casting a languishing look at me, she pronounced with a feeble\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Mr. Random, I do not deserve this concern at your hands: I\nam a vile creature, who had a base design upon your person--suffer me,\nto expiate that, and all my other crimes, by a miserable death, which\nwill not fail to overtake me in a few hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I encouraged her as much\nas I could, told her I forgave all her intentions with regard to me;\nand that, although my circumstances were extremely low, I would share my\nlast farthing with her. I begged in the meantime to know the immediate\ncause of that fit from which she had just recovered, and said, I would\nendeavour by my skill to prevent any more such attacks. She seemed very\nmuch affected with this expression, took my hand, and pressed it to her\nlips, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are too generous! I wish I could live to express my\ngratitude--but alas! I perish for want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then shutting her eyes, she\nrelapsed into another swoon. Such extremity of distress must have waked\nthe most obdurate heart to sympathy and compassion; what effect then\nmust it have had on mine, that was naturally prone to every tender\npassion? I ran downstairs, and sent my landlady to a chemist's shop for\nsome cinnamon water, while I, returning to this unfortunate creature's\nchamber, used all the means in my power to bring her to herself; this\naim with much difficulty I accomplished, and made her drink a glass of\nthe cordial to recruit her spirits: then I prepared a little mulled\nred vine and a toast, which having taken, she found herself thoroughly\nrevived, and informed me, that she had not tasted food for eight and\nforty hours before. As I was impatient to know the occasion and nature\nof her calamity, she gave me to understand, that she was a woman of\nthe town by profession; that in the course of her adventures she found\nherself dangerously infected with a distemper, to which all of her class\nare particularly subject; that her malady gaining ground every day, she\nbecame loathsome to herself and offensive to others: when she resolved\nto retire to some obscure corner where she might be cured with as little\nnoise and expense as possible; that she had accordingly chosen this\nplace of retreat, and put herself into the hands of an advertising\ndoctor, who having fleeced her of all the money she had, or could\nprocure, left her three days ago in a worse condition than that in which\nhe found her; that except the clothes on her back, she had pawned or\nsold everything that belonged to her to satisfy that rapacious quack,\nand quiet the clamour of her landlady, who still persisted in her\nthreats to turn her out into the street. After having moralised upon\nthese particulars, I proposed that she should lodge in the same room\nwith me, an expedient that would save some money: and assured her, I\nwould undertake to cure her as well as my own, during which she should\npartake of all the conveniences that I could afford to myself. She\nembraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment, and I began to put it\nin practice immediately. I found her not only an agreeable companion,\nwhose conversation greatly alleviated my chagrin, but also a careful\nnurse, who served me with the utmost fidelity and affection. One day,\nwhile I testified my surprise that a woman of her beauty, good sense,\nand education (for she had a large portion of each), could be reduced\nto such an infamous and miserable way of life, she answered with a sigh,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese very advantages were the cause of my undoing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This remarkable\nreply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree, that I begged she would\nfavour me with the particulars of her story, and she complied in these\nwords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe History of Miss Williams\n\n'My father was an eminent merchant in the city who having, in the course\nof trade, suffered very considerable losses, retired in his old age with\nhis wife to a small estate in the country, which he had purchased with\nthe remains of his fortune. At that time, I being but eight years of\nage, was left in town for the convenience of education, boarded with an\naunt, who was a rigid presbyterian, and confined me so closely to what\nshe called the duties of religion, that in time I grew weary of her\ndoctrines, and by degrees received an aversion for the good books, she\ndaily recommended to my perusal. As I increased in age, and appeared\nwith a person not disagreeable, I contracted a good deal of acquaintance\namong my own sex; one of whom, after having lamented the restraint I was\nunder from the narrowness of my aunt's sentiments, told me I must now\nthrow off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and\nexample, and learn to think for myself; for which purpose she advised\nme to read Shaftsbury, Tindal, Hobbes, and all the authors that are\nremarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking, and by\ncomparing one with the other, I should soon be able to form a system\nof my own. I followed her advice; and whether it was owing to my\nprepossession against what I had formerly read, or the clearness of\nargument in these my new instructors, I know not; but I studied them\nwith pleasure, and in a short time became a professed freethinker.\nProud of my improvement, I argued in all companies, and that with such\nsuccess, that I soon acquired the reputation of a philosopher, and\nfew people durst undertake me in a dispute. I grew vain upon my good\nfortune, and at length pretended to make my aunt a proselyte to my\nopinion; but she no sooner perceived my drift than, taking the alarm,\nshe wrote to my father an account of my heresy, and conjured him, as\nhe tendered the good of my soul, to remove me immediately from\nthe dangerous place where I had contracted such sinful principles.\nAccordingly, my father ordered me into the country, where I arrived in\nthe fifteenth year of my age, and, by his command gave him a detail of\nall the articles of my faith, which he did not find so unreasonable\nas they had been represented. Finding myself suddenly deprived of the\ncompany and pleasures of the town, I grew melancholy and it was some\ntime before I could relish my situation. But solitude became every day\nmore and more familiar to me and I consoled myself in my retreat with\nthe enjoyment of a good library, at such times as were not employed in\nthe management of the family (for my mother had been dead three years),\nin visiting, or some other party of rural diversion. Having more\nimagination than judgment, I addicted myself too much to poetry and\nromance; and, in short, was looked upon as a very extraordinary person\nby everybody in the country where I resided.\n\n'I had one evening strayed, with a book in my hand, into a wood that\nbordered on the high road, at a little distance from my father's house,\nwhen a certain drunken squire, riding by, perceived me, and crying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHolloa, there's a charming creature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d alighted in a moment, caught\nme in his arms, and treated me so rudely that I shrieked as loud as I\ncould, and in the meantime opposed his violence with all the strength\nthat rage and resentment could inspire. During this struggle, another\nhorseman came up, who, seeing a lady so unworthily used, dismounted, and\nflew to my assistance. The squire, mad with disappointment, or provoked\nwith the reproaches of the other gentleman, quitted me, and running to\nhis horse, drew a pistol from the saddle, and fired it at my protector,\nwho happily receiving no damage, went up, and, with the butt-end of his\nwhip laid him prostrate on the ground before he could use the other,\nwhich his antagonist immediately seized, and, clapping to the squire's\nbreast, threatened to put him to death for his cowardice and treachery.\nIn this dilemma I interposed and begged his life, which was granted to\nmy request, after he had asked pardon, and swore his intention was only\nto obtain a kiss. However, my defender thought proper to unload the\nother pistol, and throw away the flints, before he gave him his liberty.\nThis courteous stranger conducted me home, where my father having\nlearned the signal service he had done me, loaded him with caresses, and\ninsisted on his lodging that night at our house. If the obligation he\nhad conferred upon me justly inspired me with sentiments of gratitude,\nhis appearance and conversation seemed to entitle him to somewhat more.\nHe was about the age of two-and-twenty, among the tallest of the middle\nsize; had chestnut-coloured hair, which he wore tied up in a ribbon; a\nhigh polished forehead, a nose inclining to the aquiline, lively blue\neyes, red pouting lips, teeth as white as snow, and a certain openness\nof countenance--but why need I describe any more particulars of his\nperson? I hope you will do me the justice to believe I do not flatter,\nwhen I say he was the exact resemblance of you; and if I had not been\nwell acquainted with his family and degree, I should have made no\nscruple of concluding that you was his brother. He spoke and seemed to\nhave no reserve: for what he said was ingenuous, sensible, and uncommon.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn short,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, bursting into tears, \u00e2\u0080\u009che was formed for the ruin\nof our sex. His behaviour was modest and respectful, but his looks were\nso significant, that I could easily observe he secretly blessed the\noccasion that introduced him to my acquaintance. We learned from his\ndiscourse that he was the eldest son of a wealthy gentleman in the\nneighbourhood, to whose name we were no strangers--that he had been to\nvisit an acquaintance in the country, from whose house he was returning\nhome, when my shrieks brought him to my rescue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n'All night long my imagination formed a thousand ridiculous\nexpectations: there was so much of knight-errantry in this gentleman's\ncoming to the relief of a damsel in distress, with whom he immediately\nbecame enamoured, that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred\nto my fancy; and I looked upon myself as a princess in some region of\nromance, who being delivered from the power of some brutal giant or\nsatyr, by a generous Oroondates, was bound in gratitude, as well as led\nby inclination, to yield up my affections to him without reserve. In\nvain did I endeavour to chastise these foolish conceits by reflections\nmore reasonable and severe: the amusing images took full possession of\nmy mind, and my dreams represented my hero sighing at my feet, in the\nlanguage of a despairing lover. Next morning after breakfast he took\nhis leave, when my father begged the favour of further acquaintance with\nhim; to which request he replied by a compliment to him, and a look to\nme so full of eloquence and tenderness, that my whole soul received the\nsoft impression. In a short time he repeated his visit; and as a recital\nof the particular steps he pursued to ruin me would be tedious and\nimpertinent, let it suffice to say, he made it his business to insinuate\nhimself into my esteem, by convincing me of his own good sense, and at\nthe same time flattering my understanding. This task he performed in\nthe most artful manner, by seeming to contradict me often through\nmisapprehension, that I might have an opportunity of clearing myself the\nmore to my own honour. Having thus secured my good opinion, he began to\ngive me some tokens of a particular passion, founded on a veneration of\nthe qualities of my mind, and, as an accidental ornament, admired the\nbeauties of my person; till at being fully persuaded of his conquest, he\nchose a proper season for the theme, and disclosed his love in terms\nso ardent and sincere, that it was impossible for me to disguise the\nsentiments of my heart, and he received my approbation with the most\nlively transport. After this mutual declaration, we contrived to meet\nmore frequently in private interviews, where we enjoyed the conversation\nof one another, in all the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope\nthat reciprocal adoration can inspire. He professed his honourable\nintentions, of which I made no question; lamented the avaricious\ndisposition of his father, who had destined him for the arms of another,\nand vowed eternal fidelity with such an appearance of candour and\ndevotion--that I became a dupe to his deceit. Cursed be the day on\nwhich I gave away my innocence and peace! Cursed be my beauty that first\nattracted the attention of the seducer! Cursed be my education, that, by\nrefining my sentiments, made my heart the more susceptible! Cursed be my\ngood sense, that fixed me to one object, and taught me the preference I\nenjoyed was but my due! Had I been ugly, nobody would have tempted me;\nhad I been ignorant, the charms of my person would not have atoned for\nthe coarseness of my conversation; had I been giddy, my vanity would\nhave divided my inclinations, and my ideas would have been so diffused,\nthat I should never have listened to the enchantments of one alone.\n\n'But to return to my unfortunate story. After some months, the visits of\nmy lover became less frequent, and his behaviour less warm: I perceived\nhis coldness, my heart took the alarm, my tears reproached him, and\nI insisted upon the performance of his promise to espouse me, that,\nwhatever should happen, my reputation might be safe. He seemed to\nacquiesce in my proposal, and left me on pretence of finding a proper\nclergyman to unite us in the bands of wedlock. But alas! the inconstant\nhad no intention to return. I waited a whole week with the utmost\nimpatience; sometimes doubting his honour, at other times inventing\nexcuses for him, and condemning myself for harbouring suspicions of his\nfaith. At length I understood from a gentleman who dined at our house,\nthat this perfidious wretch was on the point of setting out for London\nwith his bride, to buy clothes for their approaching nuptials. This\ninformation distracted me! Rage took possession of my soul; I denounced\na thousand imprecations, and formed as many schemes of revenge against\nthe traitor who had undone me. Then my resentment would subside to\nsilent sorrow. I recalled the tranquillity I lost, I wept over my\ninfatuation, and sometimes a ray of hope would intervene, and for a\nmoment cheer my drooping heart; I would revolve all the favourable\ncircumstances of his character, repeat the vows he made, ascribe his\nabsence to the vigilance of a suspicious father who compelled him to\na match his soul abhorred, and comfort myself with the expectation of\nseeing him before the thing should be brought to any terms of agreement.\nBut how vain was my imagination! That villain left me without remorse,\nand in a few days the news of his marriage were spread all over the\ncountry. My horror was then inconceivable; and had not the desire of\nrevenge diverted the resolution, I should infallibly have put an end to\nmy miserable life. My father observed the symptoms of my despair: and\nthough I have good reason to believe he guessed the cause, was at\na great deal of pains to seem ignorant of my affliction, while he\nendeavoured with parental fondness to alleviate my distress. I saw his\nconcern, which increased my anguish, and raised my fury against the\nauthor of my calamity to an implacable degree.\n\n'Having furnished myself with a little money, I made an elopement from\nthis unhappy parent in the night-time, and about break of day arrived at\na small town, from whence a stage coach set out for London, in which I\nembarked, and next day alighted in town; the spirit of revenge having\nsupported me all the way against every other reflection, My first care\nwas to hire a lodging, in which I kept myself very retired, assumed a\nfeigned name, that my character and situation might be better concealed.\nIt was not long before I found out the house of my lover, whither I\nimmediately repaired in a transport of rage, determined to act some\ndesperate deed for the satisfaction of my despair, though the hurry of\nmy spirits would not permit me to concert or resolve upon a particular\nplan. When I demanded admission to Lothario (so let me call him), I was\ndesired to send up my name and business; but this I refused, telling\nthe porter I had business for his master's private ear; upon which I\nwas conducted into a parlour until he should be informed of my request.\nThere I remained about a quarter of an hour, when a servant entered and\ntold me his master was engaged with company, and begged to be excused\nat that time. My temper could hold out no longer. I pulled out a poniard\nfrom my bosom, where I had concealed it, and rushing out flew up stairs\nlike a fury, exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere's this perfidious villain? could I\nplunge this dagger into his false heart, I should then die satisfied!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The noise I made alarmed not only the servants, but the company also,\nwho hearing my threats came forward to the staircase to see was the\nmatter. I was seized, disarmed, and withheld by two footmen; and in\nthis situation felt the most exquisite torture in beholding my undoer\napproach with his young wife. I could not endure the sight, was deprived\nof my senses, and fell into a severe fit, during which I know not how I\nwas treated; but when I recovered the use of reflection, found myself on\na bed in a paltry apartment, where I was attended by an old woman, who\nasked a thousand impertinent questions relating to my condition,\nand informed me that my behaviour had thrown the whole family into\nconfusion; that Lothario affirmed I was mad, and proposed to have me\nsent to Bedlam; but my lady persuaded herself there was more in my\nconduct than he cared should be known, and had taken to her bed on bare\nsuspicion, having first ordered that I should be narrowly looked to.\nI heard all she said without making any other reply than desiring she\nwould do me the favour to call a chair; but this she told me could\nnot be done without her master's consent, which, however, was easily\nprocured, and I was conveyed to my lodgings in a state of mind that\nbaffles all description. The agitation of my thoughts produced a\nfever, which brought on a miscarriage; and I believe it is well for my\nconscience that heaven thus disposed of my burden; for let me own to\nyou with penitence and horror, if I had brought a living child into the\nworld, my frenzy would have prompted me to sacrifice the little innocent\nto my resentment of the father's infidelity.\n\n'After this event my rage abated, and my hate became more deliberate and\ncalm: when one day my landlady informed me that there was a gentleman\nbelow who desired to see me, he having something of consequence to\nimpart, which he was sure would contribute to my peace of mind. I was\nexceedingly alarmed at this declaration, which I attempted to interpret\na thousand ways; and before I came to any determination he entered my\nroom, with an apology for intruding without my knowledge or consent.\nI surveyed him some time, and not being able to recollect his face,\ndemanded, with a faltering accent, what his business was with me? Upon\nwhich he desired I would give him a particular audience, and he did not\ndoubt of communicating something that would conduce to my satisfaction\nand repose. As I thought myself sufficiently guarded against any\nviolence, I granted his request, and bade the woman withdraw. The\nstranger, then advancing, gave me to understand that he was well\nacquainted with the particulars of my story, having been informed\nof them from Lothario's own mouth--that from the time he knew my\nmisfortunes he had entertained a detestation for the author of them,\nwhich had of late been increased and inflamed to a desire of revenge,\nby a piece of dishonourable conduct towards him--that hearing of my\nmelancholy situation, he had come with an intention of offering his\nassistance and comfort, and was ready to espouse my quarrel, and\nforthwith take vengeance on my seducer, provided I would grant him one\nconsideration, which, he hoped, I should see no reason to refuse. Had\nall the artifice of hell been employed in composing a persuasive, it\ncould not have had a more instantaneous or favourable effect than this\ndiscourse had upon me. I was transported with a delirium of gloomy joy.\nThe contract was made; he devoted himself to my revenge, undertook to\nmurder Lothario that very night, and to bring me an account of his death\nbefore morning. Accordingly, about two of the clock, he was introduced\nto my chamber, and assured me that my perfidious lover was no more: that\nalthough he was not entitled to such an honourable proceeding, he had\nfairly challenged him to the field, where he upbraided him with his\ntreachery towards me, for whom, he told me, his sword was drawn, and\nafter a few passes left him weltering in his blood. I was so savaged by\nmy wrongs, that I delighted in the recital of this adventure, made him\nrepeat the particulars and feasted my eyes on the blood that remained on\nhis clothes and sword. My imagination was so engrossed by these ideas,\nthat in my sleep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me pale, mangled,\nand bloody, blamed my rashness, protested his innocence, and pleaded his\ncause so pathetically, that I was convinced of his fidelity, and waked\nin a fit of horror and remorse. I dropped asleep again, and the same\napparition recurred to my fancy. In short, I passed the night in great\nmisery, and looked upon my avenger with such abhorrence, that in\nthe morning, perceiving my aversion, he insinuated there was still\na possibility of Lothario's recovery: it was quite true he left him\nwounded on the ground, but not quite dead, and perhaps his hurts\nmight not be mortal. At these words I started up, bade him fly for\nintelligence, and if he could not bring me tidings of Lothario's safety,\nat least consult his own, and never return; for I was resolved to\nsurrender myself to justice, and declare all I knew of the affair, that,\nif possible I might expiate my own guilt, by incurring the rigours of a\nsincere repentance and ignominious death. He very coolly represented the\nunreasonableness of my prejudice against him, who had done nothing but\nwhat his love of me inspired, and honour justified: that now he had,\nat the risk of his life, been subservient to my revenge, I was about to\ndiscard him as an infamous agent, occasionally necessary; and that, even\nif he should be so lucky as to bring news of Lothario's safety, it was\nprobable my former resentment might revive, and I would upbraid him with\nhaving failed in his undertaking. I assured him, that on the contrary,\nhe should be dearer to me than ever, as I then should be convinced\nhe acted more on the principles of a man of honour than on those of a\nmercenary assassin, and scorned to take away the life of an adversary,\nhow inveterate soever, which fortune had put in his power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nthen madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, whatever may have happened, I shall find it no\ndifficult matter to acquit myself in point of honour;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and took his\nleave in order to inquire into the consequences of his duel. I was now\nmore sensible than ever of the degrees of guilt and misery; all the\naffliction I had suffered hitherto was owing to my own credulity and\nweakness, and my conscience could only accuse me of venial crimes; but\nnow that I looked upon myself as a murderer, it is impossible to express\nthe terrors of my imagination, which was incessantly haunted by the\nimage of the deceased, and my bosom stung with the most exquisite\nagonies, of which I saw no end. At length, Horatio (for so I shall call\nmy new friend) returned, and telling me I had nothing to fear, delivered\ninto my hands a billet containing these words.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I understand it is of consequence to your peace, I take this liberty\nto inform you, that the wounds I received from Horatio are not mortal.\nThis satisfaction my humanity could not deny, even to a person who has\nendeavoured to disturb the repose as well as the life of\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLothario.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n'Being well acquainted with this hand, I had no reason to suspect an\nimposition in this letter, which I read over and over with a transport\nof joy, and caressed Horatio so much that he appeared the happiest\nman alive. Thus was I won from despair by the menaces of a greater\nmisfortune than that which depressed me. Griefs are like usurpers,--the\nmost powerful deposes all the rest. But my raptures were not lasting:\nthat very letter which in a manner re-established my tranquillity, in a\nlittle time banished my peace. His unjust reproaches, while they waked\nmy resentment, recalled my former happiness, and filled my soul\nwith rage and sorrow. Horatio, perceiving the situation of my mind,\nendeavoured to divert my chagrin, by treating me with all the amusements\nand entertainments of the town. I was gratified with every indulgence I\ncould desire; introduced into the company of women in my own situation,\nby whom an uncommon deference was paid to me; and I began to lose all\nremembrance of my former condition, when an accident brought it back to\nmy view with all its interesting circumstances. Diverting myself one\nday with some newspapers, which I had not before perused, the following\nadvertisement attracted my attention:\n\n'\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhereas a young gentlewoman disappeared from her father's house in the\ncounty of --, about the end of September, on account (as is supposed) of\nsome uneasiness of mind, and has not been as yet heard of. Whoever\nwill give any information about her to Mr. -- of Gray's Inn, shall\nbe handsomely rewarded; or if she will return to the arms of her\ndisconsolate parent, she will be received with the utmost tenderness,\nwhatever reason she may have to think otherwise, and may be the means of\nprolonging the life of a father already weighed down almost to the grave\nwith age and sorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n'This pathetic remonstrance had such an effect on me, that I was fully\nresolved to return, like the prodigal son, and implore the forgiveness\nof him who gave me life; but, alas! Upon inquiry, I found he had paid\nhis debt to nature a month before, lamenting my absence to his last\nhour, having left his fortune to a stranger, as a mark of his resentment\nof my unkind and undutiful behaviour. Penetrated with remorse on this\noccasion, I sank into the most profound melancholy, and considered\nmyself as the immediate cause of his death. I lost all relish for\ncompany; and, indeed, most of my acquaintances no sooner perceived\nmy change of temper, than they abandoned me. Horatio, disgusted at my\ninsensibility, or from some other cause, became colder and colder every\nday, till at last he left me altogether, without making any apology for\nhis conduct, or securing me against the miseries of want, as a man of\nhonour ought to have done, considering the share he had in my ruin; for\nI afterwards learned, that the quarrel between Lothario and him was a\nstory trumped up to rid the one of my importunities, and give the other\na recommendation to me, which, it seems, he desired, upon seeing me\nat the house of my seducer. Reduced to this extremity, I cursed my\nown simplicity, uttered horrid imprecations against the treachery of\nHoratio; and, as I became every day more and more familiarised to the\nloss of innocence, resolved to be revenged on the sex in general, by\npractising their own arts upon themselves. Nor was an opportunity long\nwanting: an old gentlewoman, under pretence of sympathising, visited\nme, and after having condoled me on my misfortunes, and professed a\ndisinterested friendship, began to display the art of her occupation,\nin encomiums on my beauty, and invectives against the wretch who had\nforsaken me; insinuating withal, that it would be my own fault if I did\nnot still make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which\nnature had endowed me. I soon understood her drift, and gave her\nsuch encouragement to explain herself, that we came to an agreement\nimmediately to divide whatever profits might accrue from such gallants\nas she should introduce to my acquaintance. The first stroke of\nmy dissimulation was practised upon a certain judge, to whom I was\nrecommended by this matron as an innocent creature just arrived from the\ncountry.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nMiss Williams interrupted by a bailiff, who carries her to the\nMarshalsea--I accompany her--prove she is not the person named in the\nwrit--the bailiff is fain to discharge her--we shift our lodging--her\nstory, and my reflections thereupon--progress of a common woman of the\ntown--resolves to quit that way of life\n\nHer story was here interrupted by a rap at the door, which I no sooner\nopened, than three or four terrible fellows rushed in, one of whom\naccosted my fellow-lodger thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, your servant--you must do me\nthe favour to come along with me, I have a writ against you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While\nthe bailiff (for so he was) spoke thus, his followers surrounded the\nprisoner, and began to handle her very roughly. This treatment incensed\nme so much, that I snatched up the poker and would certainly have used\nit in defence of the lady, without any regard to the strength and\nnumber of her adversaries, had she not begged me, with a composure of\ncountenance for which I could not account, to use no violence on\nher behalf, which could be of no service to her, but might be very\ndetrimental to myself. Then turning to the leader of this formidable\ntroop, she desired to see the writ, and having perused it, said with\na faltering voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not the person whose name is here mentioned,\narrest me at your peril.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the catchpole. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\nshall prove your identity. In the meantime, whither will you be pleased\nto be carried, to my house, or to jail?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I must be confined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather be in your house than in a common jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nwell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you have money enough in your pocket, you shall\nbe entertained like a princess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But when she acquainted him with her\npoverty, he swore he never gave credit, and ordered one of his myrmidons\nto call a coach, to carry her to the Marshalsea at once. While they\nwaited for the convenience, she took me aside, and bade me be under no\nconcern on her account, for she knew how to extricate herself from\nthis difficulty very soon, and perhaps gain something by the occasion.\nAlthough her discourse was a mystery to me, I was very well pleased\nwith her assurance; and when the coach came to the door, I offered to\naccompany her to prison, to which proposal, after much entreaty, she\nconsented.\n\nWhen we arrived at the gate of the Marshalsea, our conductor alighted,\nand having demanded entrance, presented the writ to the turnkey, who no\nsooner perceived the name of Elizabeth Cary than he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, ah:\nmy old acquaintance Bet! I'm glad to see thee with all my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, he opened the coach door, and helped her to dismount; but when\nhe observed her face, he started back, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho have we got here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The bailiff, alarmed at this interrogation, cried with some emotion,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho should it be but the prisoner, Elizabeth Cary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The turnkey\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat Elizabeth Cary! I'll be hanged if that's Elizabeth Cary\nmore than my grandmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here the lady thought fit to interpose, and\ntell the catchpole, if he had taken her word for it at first, he might\nhave saved himself and her a great deal of trouble. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I'll have further evidence that you are not the\nperson, before you and I part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall have\nfurther evidence, to your cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then we adjourned into the lodge, and\ncalled for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to\ntwo of her acquaintance, and begged the favour of me to go to their\nlodgings, and request them to come to her immediately. I found them\ntogether at a house in Brydges Street, Drury Lane, and as they were\nluckily unengaged, they set out with me in a hackney-coach without\nhesitation, after I had related the circumstances of the affair, which\nflattered then with hopes of seeing a bailiff trounced; for there is an\nantipathy as natural between women of that class and bailiffs, as that\nsubsisting between mice and cats. Accordingly, when they entered the\nlodge, they embraced the prisoner very affectionately by the name of\nNancy Williams, and asked how long she had been nabbed, and for what? On\nhearing the particulars of her adventure repeated, they offered to swear\nbefore a justice of peace that she was not the person mentioned in the\nwrit, whom, it seems, they all knew; but the bailiff, who was by the\ntime convinced of his mistake, told them he would not put them to that\ntrouble. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLadies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere's no harm done--you shall give me\nleave to treat you with another bottle, and then we'll part friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This proposal was not at all relished by the sisterhood: and Miss\nWilliams told him, sure he did not imagine her such a fool as to be\nsatisfied with a paltry glass of sour wine? Here the turnkey interrupted\nher by affirming with an oath, that the wine was as good as ever was\ntipped over tongue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat maybe; but were it the\nbest of champagne, it is no recompense for the damage I have suffered\nboth in character and health, by being wrongfully dragged to jail; at\nthis rate, no innocent person is safe, since an officer of justice, out\nof malice, private pique, or mistake, may injure and oppress the subject\nwith impunity; but, thank heaven, I live under the protection of laws\nthat will not suffer such insults to pass unpunished, and I know very\nwell how to procure redress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Vulture, for that was the bailiff's\nname, finding he had to deal with one who would not be imposed upon,\nbegan to look very sullen and perplexed, and, leaning his forehead on\nhis hand, entered into a deliberation with himself, which lasted a few\nminutes, and then broke out in a volley of dreadful curses against the\nold jade our landlady, as he called her, for having misinformed him.\nAfter much wrangling and swearing, the matter was referred to the\ndecision of the turnkey, who calling for the other bottle, mulcted the\nbailiff in all the liquor that had been drunk, coach hire, and a couple\nof guineas for the use of the plaintiff. The money was immediately\ndeposited; Miss Williams gratified the two evidences with one half,\nand putting the other in her pocket drove home with me, leaving the\ncatchpole grumbling over his loss, yet pleased in the main, for having\nso cheaply got clear of a business that might have cost him ten times\nthe sum, and his place to boot. This guinea was a very seasonable relief\nto us, who were reduced to great necessity, six of my shirts, and almost\nall my clothes, except those on my back, having been either pawned\nor sold for our maintenance before this happened. As we resented the\nbehaviour of our landlady, our first care was to provide ourselves with\nanother lodging, whither we removed next day, with an intention to keep\nourselves as retired as possible, until our cure should be completed.\nWhen we were fixed in our new habitation, I entreated her to finish the\nstory of her life, which she pursued in this manner:--\n\n'The success of our experiment on the judge encouraged us to practice\nthe same deceit on others; but this harvest lasted not long, my\ncharacter taking air, and my directress deserting me for some new game.\nThen I took lodgings near Charing-Cross, at two guineas a week, and\nbegan to entertain company in a public manner; but my income being too\nsmall to defray my expenses, I was obliged to retrench, and enter into\narticles with the porters of certain taverns, who undertook to find\nemployment enough for me, provided I would share my profits with them.\nAccordingly, I was almost every night engaged with company, among whom\nI was exposed to every mortification, danger, and abuse, that flow from\ndrunkenness and brutality. As my spirit was not sufficiently humbled to\nthe will, nor my temper calculated for the conversation of my gallants,\nit was impossible for me to overcome an aversion I felt for my\nprofession, which manifested itself in a settled gloom on my\ncountenance, and disgusted those sons of mirth and riot so much, that\nI was frequently used in a shocking manner, and kicked down stairs with\ndisgrace. The messengers, seeing me disagreeable to their benefactors\nand employers, seldom troubled me with a call, and I began to find\nmyself almost totally neglected.\n\n'To contribute towards my support I was fain to sell my watch, rings,\ntrinkets, with the best part of my clothes; and I was one evening musing\nby myself on misery before me when I received a message from a tavern,\nwhither I repaired in a chair, and was introduced to a gentleman dressed\nlike an officer, with whom I supped in a sumptuous manner. In the\nmorning, when I awoke, I found my gallant had got up, and, drawing aside\nthe curtain, could not perceive him in the room. I waited a full hour\nfor his return, and then in the greatest perplexity, rose up and rang\nthe bell. When the waiter came to the door, he found it locked, and\ndesired admittance, which I granted, after observing, with great\nsurprise, that the key remained on the inside, as when we went to bed.\nI no sooner inquired for the captain, than the fellow, staring with a\ndistracted look, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, madam, is he not abed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And when he was\nsatisfied as to that particular, ran into a closet adjoining to the\nchamber, the window of which he found open. Through this the adventurer\nhad got upon a wall, front whence he dropped down into a court and\nescaped, leaving me to be answerable not only for the reckoning, but\nalso for a large silver tankard and posset-bowl, which he had carried\noff with him.\n\n'It is impossible to describe the consternation I was under, when I saw\nmyself detained as a thief's accomplice; for I was looked upon in that\nlight, and carried before a justice, who mistaking my confusion for a\nsign of guilt committed me, after a short examination, to Bridewell,\nhaving admonished me, as the only means to save my life, to turn\nevidence, and impeach my confederate. I now concluded the vengeance of\nHeaven had overtaken me, and that I must soon finish my career by an\nignominious death. This reflection sank so deep into my soul, that I\nwas for some days deprived of my reason, and actually believed myself\nin hell, tormented by fiends. Indeed, there needs not a very extravagant\nimagination to form that idea: for of all the scenes on earth that of\nBridewell approaches nearest the notion I had always entertained of the\nregions. Here I saw nothing but rage, anguish and impiety, and heard\nnothing but groans, curses, and blasphemy. In the midst of this hellish\ncrew, I was subjected to the tyranny of a barbarian, who imposed upon me\ntasks that I could not possibly perform, and then punished my incapacity\nwith the utmost rigour and inhumanity. I was often whipped into a swoon,\nand lashed out of it (during which miserable interval, I was robbed by\nmy fellow-prisoners of everything about me, even to my cap, shoes, and\nstockings): I was not only destitute of necessaries, but even of food,\nso that my wretchedness was extreme. Not one of my acquaintance to whom\nI imparted my situation, would grant me the least succour or regard,\non pretence of my being committed for theft, and my landlord refused\nto part with some of my own clothes which I sent for, because I was\nindebted to him for a week's lodging.\n\n'Overwhelmed with calamity, I grew desperate, and resolved to put an\nend to my grievances and life together: for this purpose I got up in\nthe middle of the night, when I thought everybody around me asleep, and\nfixing one end of a large hook in the ceiling, that supported the scales\non which the hemp is weighed, I stood upon a chair, and making a noose\non the other end, put my neck into ii with an intention to hang myself;\nbut before I could adjust the knot I was surprised and prevented by two\nwomen, who had been awake all the while and suspected my design. In the\nmorning, my attempt was published among the prisoners and punished with\nthirty stripes, the pain of which, co-operating with my disappointment\nand disgrace, bereft me of my senses, and threw me into an ecstacy of\nmadness, during which I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth, and\ndashed my head against the pavement; so that they were obliged to set a\nwatch over me, to restrain me from doing further mischief to myself and\nothers. This fit of frenzy continued three days, at the end of which I\ngrew calm and sullen: but as the desire of making away with myself still\nremained, I came to a determination of starving myself to death, and\nwith that view refused all sustenance.\n\n'Whether it was owing to the want of opposition, or to the weakness\nof nature, I know not; but on the second day of my fast, I found\nmy resolution considerably impaired, and the calls of hunger almost\ninsupportable. At this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the\nprison, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with\nHoratio; she was then on the same footing as I was, but afterwards\nquarrelling with her gallant, and not finding another to her mind,\naltered her scheme of life, and set up a coffee-house among the hundreds\nin Drury, where she entertained gentlemen with claret, arrack, and the\nchoice of half-a-dozen damsels who lived in her house. This serviceable\nmatron having neglected to gratify a certain justice for the connivance\nshe enjoyed, was indicted at the quarter sessions, in consequence of\nwhich her bevy was dispersed, and herself committed to Bridewell. She\nhad not been long there before she learned my disaster, and coming up to\nme, after a compliment of condolence, inquired into the particulars of\nmy fate. While we were engaged in discourse together, the master came\nand told me, that the fellow on whose account I had suffered was taken,\nthat he had confessed the theft, and cleared me of any concern in the\naffair; for which reason he, the master, had orders to discharge me, and\nthat I was from that moment free.\n\n'This piece of news soon banished all thoughts of death, and had such an\ninstantaneous effect on my countenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady then\npresent), hoping to find her account in me, very generously offered\nto furnish me with what necessaries I wanted, and take me into her own\nhouse as soon as she could compromise matters with the justices. The\nconditions of her offer were, that I should pay three guineas weekly for\nmy board, and a reasonable consideration besides, for the use of such\nclothes and ornaments as she should supply me with, to be deducted from\nthe first profits of my occupation. These were hard terms, but not to\nbe rejected by one who was turned out helpless and naked into the wide\nworld, without a friend to pity or assist her. I therefore embraced her\nproposal, and she being bailed in a few hours, took me home with her in\na coach. As I was by this time conscious of having formerly disgusted\nmy admirers by my reserved loud haughty behaviour, I now endeavoured to\nconquer that disposition, and the sudden change of my fortune giving me\na flow of spirits, I appeared in the most winning and gay manner I could\nassume. Having the advantage of a good voice and education, I exerted\nmy talents to the uttermost, and soon became the favourite with all\ncompany. This success alarmed the pride and jealousy of Mrs. Coupler,\nwho could not bear the thoughts of being eclipsed: she therefore made a\nmerit of her envy, and whispered among the customers that I was unsound.\nThere needed no more to ruin my reputation and blast my prosperity;\neverybody shunned me with marks of aversion and disdain, and in a very\nshort time I was as solitary as ever. Want of gallants was attended with\nwant of money to satisfy my malicious landlady, who having purposely\ngiven me credit to the amount of eleven pounds, took out a writ against\nme and I was arrested in her own house. Though the room was crowded with\npeople when the bailiff entered, not one of them had compassion enough\nto mollify my prosecutrix, far less to pay the debt; they even laughed\nat my tears, and one of them bade me be of good cheer, for I should not\nwant admirers in Newgate.\n\n'At this instant a sea-lieutenant came in, and seeing my plight, began\nto inquire into the circumstances of my misfortune. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarkee, my girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he inquired \u00e2\u0080\u009chow far have you overrun the constable?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him that\nthe debt amounted to eleven pounds, besides the expenses of the writ.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn that be all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shan't go to the bilboes this bout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n And taking out his purse, he paid the money, discharged the bailiff, and\ntelling me I had got into the wrong port, advised me to seek out a more\nconvenient harbour, where I could be safely hove down; for which purpose\nhe made me a present of five guineas more. I was so touched with this\nsingular piece of generosity, that for some time I had not power to\nthank him. However, as soon as I recollected myself, I begged the favour\nof him to go with me to the next tavern, where I explained the nature of\nmy disaster, and convinced him of the falsehood of what was reported to\nmy prejudice so effectually, that he from that moment attached himself\nto me, and we lived in great harmony together, until he was obliged to\ngo to sea, where he perished in a storm.\n\n'Having lost my benefactor, and almost consumed the remains of his\nbounty, I saw myself in danger of relapsing into my former necessity,\nand began to be very uneasy at the prospect of bailiffs and jails! when\none of the sisterhood advised me to take lodgings in a part of the town\nwhere I was unknown, and pass for an heiress, by which artifice I might\nentrap somebody to be my husband, who would possibly be able to allow me\na handsome maintenance, or at worst screen me from the dread and danger\nof a prison, by becoming liable for whatever debts I should contract.\nI approved of this scheme, towards the execution of which my companion\nclubbed her wardrobe, and undertook to live with me in quality of my\nmaid, with the proviso that she should be reimbursed and handsomely\nconsidered out of the profits of my success. She was immediately\ndetached to look out for a convenient place, and that very day hired a\ngenteel apartment in Park Street, whither I moved in a couch loaded with\nher baggage, and my own. I made my first appearance in a blue riding\nhabit trimmed with silver; and my maid acted her part so artfully, that\nin a day or two my fame spread all over the neighbourhood, and I was\nsaid to be a rich heiress just arrived from the country. This report\nbrought a swarm of gay young fellows about me; but I soon found them to\nbe all indigent adventurers like myself, who crowded to me like crows\nto a carrion, with a view of preying upon my fortune. I maintained,\nhowever, the appearance of wealth as long as possible, in hopes of\ngaining some admirer more for my purpose, and at length attracted the\nregard of one who would have satisfied my wishes, and managed matters so\nwell, that a day was actually fixed for our nuptials. In the interim, he\nbegged leave to introduce an intimate friend to me, which request, as I\ncould not refuse, I had the extreme mortification and surprise to see,\nnext night, in that friend, my old keeper Horatio, who no sooner beheld\nme than he changed colour, but had presence of mind to advance and\nsalute me, bidding me (with a low voice) be under no apprehension, for\nhe would not expose me. In spite of his assurance, I could not recover\nmyself so far as to entertain them, but withdrew to my chamber on\npretence of a severe headache, to the no small concern of my adorer, who\ntook his leave in the tenderest manner, and went off with his friend.\n\n'Having imparted my situation to my companion, she found it high time\nfor us to decamp, and that without any noise, because we were not\nonly indebted to our landlady, but also to several tradesmen in the\nneighbourhood. Our retreat, therefore, was concerted and executed in\nthis manner: Having packed up all our clothes and moveables in small\nparcels, she (on pretence of fetching cordials for me) carried them\nat several times to the house of an acquaintance, where she likewise\nprocured a lodging, to which we retired in the middle of the night, when\nevery other body in the house was asleep. I was now obliged to aim at\nlower game, and accordingly spread my nets among tradespeople, but found\nthem all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions, till at\nlast I became acquainted with you, on whom I practised all my dexterity;\nnot that I believed you had any fortune, or expectation of me, but that\nI might transfer the burden of such debts as I had incurred, or should\ncontract, from myself to another, and at the same time avenge myself of\nyour sex, by rendering miserable one who bore such resemblance to the\nwretch who ruined me; but Heaven preserved you from my snares by the\ndiscovery you made, which was owing to the negligence of my maid\nin leaving the chamber-door unlocked when she went to buy sugar for\nbreakfast. When I found myself detected and forsaken by you, I was fain\nto move my lodging, and dwell two pair of stairs higher than before. My\ncompanion, being disappointed in her expectations, left me, and I had no\nother resource than to venture forth, like the owls in the dark, to pick\nup a precarious and uncomfortable subsistence. I have often sauntered\nbetween Ludgate Hill and Charing Cross a whole winter night, exposed\nnot only to the inclemency of the weather, but likewise to the rage of\nhunger and thirst, without being so happy as to meet with one dupe, then\ncreep up to my garret, in a deplorable draggled condition, sneak to bed,\nand try to bury my appetite and sorrows in sleep. When I lighted on some\nrake or tradesman reeling home drunk, I frequently suffered the most\nbrutal treatment, in spite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and\ngood humour, though my soul was stung with resentment and disdain,\nand my heart loaded with grief and affliction. In the course of these\nnocturnal adventures, I was infected with the disease, that in a short\ntime rendered me the object of my own abhorrence, and drove me to the\nretreat where your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of death.'\n\nSo much candour and good sense appeared in this lady's narration, that\nI made no scruple of believing every syllable of what she said, and\nexpressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries she had undergone\nin so little time, for all her misfortunes had happened within the\ncompass of two years; I compared her situation with my own, and found it\na thousand times more wretched. I had endured hardships, 'tis true--my\nwhole life had been a series of such; and when I looked forward, the\nprospect was not much bettered, but then they were become habitual to\nme, and consequently I could bear them with less difficulty. If one\nscheme of life should not succeed, I could have recourse to another, and\nso to a third, veering about to a thousand different shifts, according\nto the emergencies of my fate, without forfeiting the dignity of my\ncharacter beyond a power of retrieving it, or subjecting myself wholly\nto the caprice and barbarity of the world. On the other hand, she had\nknown and relished the sweets of prosperity, she had been brought up\nunder the wings of an indulgent parent, in all the delicacies to which\nher sex and rank entitled her; and without any extravagance of hope,\nentertained herself with the view of uninterrupted happiness through the\nwhole scene of life. How fatal then, how tormenting, how intolerable,\nmust her reverse of fortune be!--a reverse, that not only robs her of\nthese external comforts, and plunges her into all the miseries of want,\nbut also murders her peace of mind, and entails upon her the curse of\neternal infamy! Of all professions I pronounced that of a courtesan the\nmost deplorable, and her of all courtesans the most unhappy. She allowed\nmy observation to be just in the main, but at the same time affirmed\nthat notwithstanding the disgraces which had fallen to her share, she\nhad not been so unlucky in the condition of a prostitute as many others\nof the same community. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have often seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile I strolled\nabout the streets at midnight, a number of naked wretches reduced to\nrags and filth, huddled together like swine, in the corner of a dark\nalley, some of whom, but eighteen months before, I had known the\nfavourites of the town, rolling in affluence, and glittering in all the\npomp of equipage and dress. Miserable wretch that I am! perhaps the same\nhorrors are decreed for me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried she, after some pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall\nnever live to such extremity of distress; my own hand shall open a\nway for my deliverance, before I arrive at that forlorn period!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Her condition filled me with sympathy and compassion: I revered her\nqualifications, looked upon her as unfortunate, not criminal, and\nattended her with such care and success, that in less than two months\nher health, as well as my own, was perfectly re-established. As we often\nconferred upon our mutual affairs, and interchanged advice, a thousand\ndifferent projects were formed, which, upon further canvassing, appeared\nimpracticable. We would have gladly gone to service, but who would take\nus in without recommendation? At length an expedient occurred to her, of\nwhich she intended to lay hold; and this was, to procure with the first\nmoney she should earn, the homely garb of a country wench, go to some\nvillage at a good distance from town, and come up in a waggon, as a\nfresh girl for service: by which means she might be provided for, in\na manner much more suitable to her inclination than her present way of\nlife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nI am reduced to a great misery--assaulted on Tower Hill by a press-gang,\nwho put me on board a tender--my usage there--my arrival on board at a\nman-of-war, where I am put in irons, and released by the good offices of\nMr. Thompson, who recommends me as assistant to the surgeon---he relates\nhis own story--characters of the captain, surgeon, and first mate\n\nI applauded the resolution of Miss Williams, who a few days after, was\nhired in quality of bar-keeper, by one of the ladies who had witnessed\nin her behalf at the Marshalsea, and who since that time had got credit\nwith a wine merchant, whose favourite she was, to set up a convenient\nhouse of her own. Thither my fellow-lodger repaired, after having taken\nleave of me with a torrent of tears, and a thousand protestations of\neternal gratitude; assuring me she would remain in this situation no\nlonger than she could pick up money sufficient to put her other design\nin execution.\n\nAs for my own part, I saw no resource but the army or navy, between\nwhich I hesitated so long that I found myself reduced to a starving\ncondition. My spirit began to accommodate itself to my beggarly fate,\nand I became so mean as to go down towards Wapping, with an intention to\ninquire for an old schoolfellow, who, I understood, had got the\ncommand of a small coasting vessel then in the river, and implore his\nassistance. But my destiny prevented this abject piece of behaviour;\nfor as I crossed Tower Wharf, a squat tawny fellow with a hanger by his\nside, and a cudgel in his hand came up to me, calling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYo ho! brother,\nyou must come along with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As I did not like his appearance, instead\nof answering his salutation, I quickened my pace, in hope of ridding\nmyself of his company; upon which he whistled aloud, and immediately\nanother sailor appeared before me, who laid hold of me by the collar,\nand began to drag me along. Not being in a humour to relish such\ntreatment, I disengaged myself of the assailant, and, with one blow\nof my cudgel, laid him motionless on the ground; and perceiving myself\nsurrounded in a trice by ten or a dozen more, exerted myself with such\ndexterity and success, that some of my opponents were fain to attack\nme with drawn cutlasses; and after an obstinate engagement, in which I\nreceived a large wound on my head, and another on my left cheek, I was\ndisarmed, taken prisoner, and carried on board a pressing tender, where,\nafter being pinioned like a malefactor, I was thrust down into the\nhold among a parcel of miserable wretches, the sight of whom well nigh\ndistracted me. As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to\norder my wounds to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands,\nI desired one of my fellow captives who was unfettered, to take a\nhandkerchief out of my pocket, and tie it round my head, to stop the\nbleeding. He pulled out my handkerchief, 'tis true, but instead of\napplying it to the use for which I designed it, went to the grating of\nthe hatchway, and, with astonishing composure, sold it before my face\nto a bumboat woman (1) then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he\ntreated his companions, regardless of my circumstances and entreaties.\n\n\n(1) A Bumboat woman is one who sells bread, cheese, greens, liquor, and\nfresh potatoes to the sailors, in a small boat that lies alongside the\nship\n\nI complained bitterly of this robbery to the midshipman on deck, telling\nhim at the same time, that unless my hurts were dressed, I should bleed\nto death. But compassion was a weakness of which no man could justly\naccuse this person, who, squirting a mouthful of dissolved tobacco upon\nme through the gratings, told me \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was a mutinous dog, and that I\nmight die for anything he cared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Finding there was no other remedy, I\nappealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory, to be called\nat a more fitting opportunity. In the meantime, loss of blood, vexation,\nand want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench of the place, to\nthrow me into a swoon, out of which I was recovered by a tweak of the\nnose, administered by the tar who stood sentinel over us, who at the\nsame time regaled me with a draught of flip, and comforted me with the\nhopes of being put on board of the Thunder next day, where I should be\nfreed of my handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by the doctor. I no sooner\nheard him name the Thunder, than I asked if he had belonged to that ship\nlong; and be giving me to understand he had belonged to her five years,\nI inquired if he knew Lieutenant Bowling? \u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow Lieutenant Bowling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds my life! and that I do; and a good seaman he is as\never stepped upon forecastle, and a brave fellow as ever cracked\nbiscuit--none of your Guinea pigs, nor your fresh water, wish-washy,\nfair-weather fowls. Many a taut gale of wind have honest Tom Bowling\nand I weathered together. Here's his health, with all my heart: wherever\nhe is, a-loft, or a-low, the lieutenant needs not be ashamed to show\nhimself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was so much affected with this eulogium, that I could not\nrefrain from telling him that I was Lieutenant Bowling's kinsman; in\nconsequence of which connection, he expressed his inclination to\nserve me, and when he was relieved, brought some cold boiled beef in\na platter, and biscuit, on which we supped plentifully, and afterwards\ndrank another can of flip together. While we were thus engaged, he\nrecounted a great many exploits of my uncle, who, I found, was very much\nbeloved by the ship's company, and pitied for the misfortune that had\nhappened to him in Hispaniola, which I was very glad to be informed\nwas not so great as I imagined; for Captain Oakum had recovered of\nhis wounds, and actually at that time commanded the ship. Having by\naccident, in my pocket, my uncle's letter, written from Port Louis, I\ngave it my benefactor (whose name was Jack Rattlin) for his perusal; but\nhonest Jack told me frankly he could not read, and desired to know the\ncontents, which I immediately communicated. When he heard that part of\nit in which he says he had written to his landlord in Deal, he cried,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody o' me! that was old Ben Block; he was dead before the letter came\nto hand. Ey, ey, had Ben been alive, Lieutenant Bowling would have had\nno occasion to skulk so long. Honest Ben was the first man that taught\nhim to hand, reef, and steer. Well, well, we must all die, that's\ncertain--we must all come to port sooner or later, at sea or on\nshore--we must be fast moored one day: death's like the best bower\nanchor, as the saying is--it will bring us all up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could not but\nsignify my approbation of the justness of Jack's reflections, and\ninquired into the occasion of the quarrel between Captain Oakum and my\nuncle, which he explained in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Oakum, to be sure, is\na good man enough--besides, he's my commander; but what's that to me?\nI do my duty, and value no man's anger of a rope's end. Now the report\ngoes, as how he's a lord, or baron knight's brother, whereby (d'ye see\nme,) he carries a straight arm, and keeps aloof from his officers, though\nmayhap they may be as good men in the main as he. Now we lying at anchor\nin Tuberon Bay, Lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch, and as he\nalways kept a good look out, he made (d'ye see) three lights in the\noffing, whereby he ran down to the great cabin for orders, and found\nthe captain asleep; whereupon he waked him, which put him in a main high\npassion, and he swore woundily at the lieutenant, and called him lousy\nScotch son of a whore (for, I being then sentinel in the steerage, heard\nall), and swab, and lubber, whereby the lieutenant returned the salute,\nand they jawed together fore and aft a good spell, till at last the\ncaptain turned out, and, laying hold of a rattan, came athwart Mr.\nBowling's quarter: whereby he told the captain that, if he was not\nhis commander, he would heave him overboard, and demanded satisfaction\nashore; whereby in the morning watch, the captain went ashore in the\npinnace, and afterwards the lieutenant carried the cutter ashore, and so\nthey, leaving the boats' crews on their oars, went away together; and so\n(d'ye see) in less than a quarter of an hour we heard firing, whereby\nwe made for the place, and found the captain lying wounded on the beach,\nand so brought him on board to the doctor, who cured him in less than\nsix weeks. But the lieutenant clapped on all the sail he could bear, and\nhad got far enough ahead before we knew anything of the matter; so that\nwe could never after get sight of him, for which we were not sorry,\nbecause the captain was mainly wrath, and would certainly have done him\na mischief; for he afterwards caused him to be run on the ship's books,\nwhereby he lost all his pay, and, if he should be taken, would be tried\nas a deserter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis account of the captain's behaviour gave me no advantageous idea\nof his character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had\nsubjected me to such a commander. However, making a virtue of necessity,\nI put a good face on the matter, and next day, was, with the other\npressed men, put on board of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cThunder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d lying at the Nore. When we\ncame alongside, the mate, who guarded us thither, ordered my handcuffs\nto be taken off, that I might get on board the easier; this circumstance\nbeing perceived by some of the company who stood upon the gangboard\nto see us enter, one of them called to Jack Rattlin, who was busied in\ndoing this friendly office for me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, Jack, what Newgate galley have\nyou boarded in the river as you came along? Have we not thieves enow\namong us already?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another, observing my wounds, which remained exposed\nto the air, told me, my seams were uncaulked, and that I must be new\npayed. A third, seeing my hair clotted together with blood, as it were\ninto distinct cords, took notice, that my bows were mended with the red\nropes, instead of my side. A fourth asked me, if I could not keep my\nyards square without iron braces? And, in short, a thousand witticisms\nof the same nature were passed upon me before I could get up the ship's\nside.\n\nAfter we had been all entered upon the ship's books, I inquired of\none of my shipmates where the surgeon was, that I might have my wounds\ndressed, and had actually got as far as the middle deck (for our ship\ncarried eighty guns), in my way to the cockpit, when I was met by the\nsame midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender: he, seeing\nme free from my chains, asked, with an insolent air, who had released\nme? To this question, I foolishly answered, with a countenance that\ntoo plainly declared the state of my thoughts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoever did it, I am\npersuaded did not consult you in the affair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had no sooner uttered\nthese words, than he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDamn you, you saucy son of a hitch, I'll\nteach you to talk so to your officer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he bestowed on me\nseveral severe stripes with a supple jack he had in his hand: and,\ngoing to the commanding officer, made such a report of me, that I was\nimmediately put in irons by the master-at-arms, and a sentinel placed\nover me. Honest Rattlin, as soon as he heard of my condition, came to\nme, and administered all the consolation he could, and then went to the\nsurgeon in my behalf, who sent one of his mates to dress my wounds.\nThis mate was no other than my old friend Thompson, with whom I became\nacquainted at the Navy Office, as before mentioned. If I knew him at\nfirst sight, it was not easy for him to recognise me, disfigured with\nblood and dirt, and altered by the misery I had undergone. Unknown as\nI was to him, he surveyed me with looks of compassion, and handled my\nsores with great tenderness. When he had applied what he thought proper,\nand was about to leave me, I asked him if my misfortunes had disguised\nme so much that he could not recollect my face? Upon this address\nhe observed me with great earnestness for some time, and at length\nprotested he could not recollect one feature of my countenance. To keep\nhim no longer in suspense, I told him my name, which when he heard, he\nembraced me with affection, and professed his sorrow at seeing me in\nsuch a disagreeable situation. I made him acquainted with my story, and,\nwhen he heard how inhumanly I had been used in the tender, he left me\nabruptly, assuring me I should see him again soon. I had scarce time\nto wonder at his sudden departure, when the master-at-arms came to the\nplace of my confinement, and bade me follow him to the quarter-deck,\nwhere I was examined by the first lieutenant, who commanded the ship in\nthe absence of the captain, touching the treatment I had received in the\ntender from my friend the midshipman, who was present to confront me.\n\nI recounted the particulars of his behaviour to me, not only in the\ntender, but since my being on board the ship, part of which being proved\nby the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others, who had no great devotion\nfor my oppressor, I was discharged from confinement, to make way for\nhim, who was delivered to the master-at-arms to take his turn in the\nbilboes. And this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed, for I was,\nat the request of the surgeon, exempted from all other duty than that of\nassisting his mates, in making and administering medicines to the sick.\nThis good office I owed to the friendship of Mr. Thompson, who had\nrepresented me in such a favourable light to the surgeon, that he\ndemanded me of the lieutenant to supply the place of his third mate,\nwho was lately dead. When I had obtained this favour, my friend Thompson\ncarried me down to the cockpit, which is the place allotted for the\nhabitation of the surgeon's mates; and when he had shown me their\nberth (as he called it), I was filled with astonishment and horror, We\ndescended by divers ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon, which, I\nunderstood, was immersed several feet under water, being immediately\nabove the hold. I had no sooner approached this dismal gulph, than my\nnose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified cheese and\nrancid butter, that issued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder,\nresembling a chandler's shop, where, by the faint glimmering of a\ncandle, I could perceive a man with a pale, meagre countenance, sitting\nbehind a kind of desk, having spectacles on his nose, and a pen in his\nhand. This (I learned of Mr. Thompson) was the ship's steward, who sat\nthere to distribute provision to the several messes, and to mark what\neach received. He therefore presented my name to him, and desired\nI might be entered in his mess; then, taking a light in his hand,\nconducted me to the place of his residence, which was a square of about\nsix feet, surrounded with the medicine-chest, that of the first mate,\nhis own, and a board by way of table fastened to the after powder room;\nit was also inclosed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ship,\nto screen us from the cold, as well as from the view of the midshipmen\nand quartermaster, who lodged within the cable-tiers on each side of us.\nIn this gloomy mansion he entertained me with some cold suit pork, which\nhe brought from a sort of locker, fixed above the table: and calling for\nthe boy of the mess, sent for a can of beer, of which he made excellent\nflip to crown the banquet.\n\nBy this time I began to recover my spirits, which had been exceedingly\ndepressed with the appearance of everything about me, and could no\nlonger refrain from asking the particulars of Mr. Thompson's fortune\nsince I had seen him in London. He told me, that being disappointed in\nhis expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious s--t--ry at\nthe Navy Office, he found himself utterly unable to subsist any longer\nin town, and had actually offered his service, in quality of mate, to\nthe surgeon of a merchant ship, bound to Guinea on the slaving trade;\nwhen, one morning, a young fellow, of whom he had some acquaintance,\ncame to his lodgings, and informed him that he had seen a warrant made\nout in his name at the Navy Office, for surgeon's second mate of a\nthird-rate. This unexpected piece of good news he could scarcely believe\nto be true, more especially as he had been found qualified at Surgeons'\nHall for third mate only; but that he might not be wanting to himself,\nhe went thither to be assured, and actually found it so: whereupon,\ndemanding his warrant, it was delivered to him, and the oaths\nadministered immediately. That very afternoon he went to Gravesend\nin the tilt-boat, from whence he took place in the tide-coach for\nRochester; next morning got on board the \u00e2\u0080\u009cThunder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for which he was\nappointed, then lying in the harbour at Chatham; and the same day was\nmustered by the clerk of the checque. And well it was for him that such\nexpedition was used; for, in less than twelve hours after his arrival,\nanother William Thompson came on board, affirming that he was the person\nfor whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was an impostor.\n\nMy friend was grievously alarmed at this accident, the more so, as his\nnamesake had very much the advantage over him both in assurance and\ndress. However, to acquit himself of the suspicion of imposture, he\nproduced several letters written from Scotland to him in that name, and,\nrecollecting that his indentures were in a box on board, he brought them\nup, and convinced all present that he had not assumed a name which did\nnot belong to him. His competitor, enraged that they should hesitate\nin doing him justice (for to be sure the warrant had been designed for\nhim), behaved with so much indecent heat, that the commanding officer\n(who was the same gentleman I had seen) and the surgeon were offended at\nhis presumption, and making a point of it with their friends in town, in\nless than a week got the first confirmed in his station. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been\non board,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cever since; and, as this way of life is becoming\nfamiliar to me, have no cause to complain of my situation. The surgeon\nis a good-natured, indolent man; the first mate (who is now on shore on\nduty) is indeed a little proud and choleric, as all Welshmen are, but\nin the main a friendly honest fellow. The lieutenants I have no concern\nwith; and, as for the captain, he is too much of a gentleman to know a\nsurgeon's mate, even by sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nThe behaviour of Mr. Morgan--his pride, displeasure, and generosity--the\neconomy of our mess described--Thomson's further friendship--the nature\nof my duty explained--the situation of the sick\n\nWhile he was thus discoursing to me, we heard a voice on the cockpit\nladder pronounce with great vehemence, in a strange dialect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil\nand his dam blow me from the top of Monchdenny, if I go to him before\nthere is something in my pelly. Let his nose be as yellow as saffron, or\nas plue as a pell (look you), or as green as a leek, 'tis all one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To\nthis declaration somebody answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it seems my poor messmate must\npart his cable for want of a little assistance. His foretopsail is loose\nalready; and besides the doctor ordered you to overhaul him; but I see\nyou don't mind what your master says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he was interrupted with,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSplutter and cons! you lousy tog, who do you call my master? Get\nyou gone to the doctor, and tell him my birth, and education, and\nmy abilities; and moreover, my behaviour is as good as his, or any\nshentleman's (no disparagement to him,) in the whole world. Cot pless my\nsoul I does he think, or conceive, or imagine, that I am a horse, or\nan ass, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and upwards and\ndownwards, and by sea and by land; at his will and pleasure? Go your\nways, you rapscallion, and tell Doctor Atkins that I desire and request\nthat he will give a look upon the tying man, and order something for\nhim, if he be dead or alive, and I will see him take it by and by, when\nmy craving stomach is satisfied, look you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At this, the other went\naway, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if they should serve him so when he was dying, by\nGod he would be foul of them in the other world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here Mr. Thompson let\nme know, that the person we heard was Mr. Morgan, the first mate, who\nwas just come on board from the hospital, whither he had attended some\nof the sick in the morning; at the same time I saw him come into the\nberth. He was a short thick man, with a face garnished with pimples,\na snub nose turned up at the end, an excessive wide mouth, and little\nfiery eyes, surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles. My\nfriend immediately made him acquainted with my case; when he regarded me\nwith a very lofty look, but without speaking, set down a bundle he had\nin his hand, and approached the cupboard, which, when he had opened, he\nexclaimed in a great passion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot is my life, all the pork is gone, as\nI am a Christian!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thompson then gave him to understand, that, as I\nhad been brought on board half famished, he could do no less than to\nentertain me with what was in the locker, and the rather as he had bid\nthe steward enter me in the mess. Whether this disappointment made Mr.\nMorgan more peevish than usual, or he really thought himself too little\nregarded by his fellow mate, I know not, but after some pause, he went\non in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Thompson, perhaps you do not use me with all\nthe good manners, and complaisance, and respect (look you,) that becomes\nyou, because you have not vouchsafed to advise with me in this affair.\nI have in my time (look you,) been a man of some weight, and substance,\nand consideration, and have kept house and home, and paid scot and lot,\nand the king's taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot. And moreover,\nalso, I am your senior, and your older, and your petter, Mr. Thompson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy elder, I'll allow you to be, but not my better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Thompson,\nwith some heat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot is my Saviour, and witness too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morgan, with\ngreat vehemence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am more elder, and therefore more petter by\nmany years than you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fearing this dispute might be attended with some\nbad consequence, I interposed, and told Mr. Morgan I was very sorry for\nhaving been the occasion of any difference between him and the second\nmate; and that, rather than cause the least breach in their good\nunderstanding, I would eat my allowance to myself, or seek admission\ninto some other company. But Thompson, with more spirit than discretion\n(as I thought), insisted upon my remaining where he had appointed me;\nand observed that no man, possessed of generosity and compassion, would\nhave any objection to it, considering my birth and talents, and the\nmisfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergone.\n\nThis was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who protested with great\nearnestness, that he had no objection to my being received in the mess;\nbut only complained that the ceremony of asking his consent was not\nobserved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for a sheltenman in distress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, shaking me by the\nhand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI lofe him as I lofe my own powels: for, Cot help me! I have had\nvexations enough upon my own pack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as I afterwards learned, in\nso saying, he spoke no more than what was true; for he had been once\nsettled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire, and was ruined by\nbeing security for an acquaintance. All differences being composed, he\nuntied his bundle, which consisted of three bunches of onions, and a\ngreat lump of Cheshire cheese, wrapped up in a handkerchief: and, taking\nsome biscuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite, inviting\nus to share of the repast. When he had fed heartily on his homely fare,\nhe filled a large cup, made of a cocoa-nut shell, with brandy, and,\ndrinking it off, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrandy was the best menstruum for onions and\nsheese.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His hunger being appeased, he began to be in better humour;\nand, being inquisitive about my birth, no sooner understood that I was\ndescended of a good family, than he discovered a particular good-will to\nme on that account, deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the\nfamous Caractacus, king of the Britons, who was first the prisoner,\nand afterwards the friend of Claudius Caesar. Perceiving how much I\nwas reduced in point of linen, he made me a present of two good\nruffled shirts, which, with two more of check which I received from Mr.\nThompson, enabled me to appear with decency.\n\nMeanwhile the sailor, whom Mr. Morgan had sent to the doctor, brought a\nprescription for his messmate, which when the Welshman had read, he got\nup to prepare it, and asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the man was dead or alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Jack; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he was dead, he would have no occasion for doctor's\nstuff. No, thank God, death han't as yet boarded him. But they have\nbeen yard-arm and yard-arm these three glasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre his eyes open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued the mate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis starboard eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sailor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis open, but\nfast jammed in his head: and the haulyards of his under jaw have given\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPassion of my heart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Morgan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe man is as pad as one\nwould desire to be! Did you feel his pulses!\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this the other replied\nwith \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which this Cambro Briton, with great earnestness and\nhumanity, ordered the tar to run to his messmate, and keep him alive\ntill he should come with the medicine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall\nperadventure pehold what you shall see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor fellow, with great simplicity, ran to the place where the sick\nman lay, but in less than a minute returned with a woful countenance,\nand told us his comrade had struck. Morgan, hearing this, exclaimed,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMercy upon my salvation! why did you not stop him till I came?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop\nhim!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hailed him several times, but he was too far on\nhis way, and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters; so that\nhe did not mind me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe all owe heaven a teath.\nGo your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning, look\nyou, and repent of your misteets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he pushed the seaman out\nof the berth.\n\nWhile we entertained us with reflections suitable to this event, we\nheard the boatswain pipe to dinner; and immediately the boy belonging\nto our mess ran to the locker, from whence he carried off a large wooden\nplatter, and, in a few minutes, returned with it full of boiled peas,\ncrying \u00e2\u0080\u009cScaldings\u00e2\u0080\u009d all the way as he came. The cloth, consisting of a\npiece of an old sail, was instantly laid, covered with three plates,\nwhich by the colour I could with difficulty discern to be metal, and as\nmany spoons of the same composition, two of which were curtailed in the\nhandles, and the other abridged in the lip. Mr. Morgan himself enriched\nthis mess with a lump of salt butter scooped from an old gallipot, and\na handful of onions shorn, with some pounded pepper. I was not very much\ntempted with the appearance of this dish, of which, nevertheless, my\nmessmates ate heartily, advising me to follow their example, as it was\nbanyan day and we could have no meat till next noon. But I had already\nlaid in sufficient for the occasion, and therefore desired to be\nexcused: expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of banyan day. They\ntold me, that, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the ship's company\nhad no allowance of meat, and that these meagre days were called banyan\ndays, the reason of which they did not know; but I have since learned\nthey take their denomination from a sect of devotees in some parts of\nthe East Indies, who never taste flesh.\n\nAfter dinner Thompson led me round the ship, showed me the different\nparts, described their uses, and, as far as he could, made me acquainted\nwith the particulars of the discipline and economy practised on board.\nHe then demanded of the boatswain a hammock for me, which was slung in\na very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin; and, as I had no\nbed-clothes, procured credit for me with the purser, for a mattress and\ntwo blankets. At seven o'clock in the evening Morgan visited the sick,\nand, having ordered what was proper for each, I assisted Thompson in\nmaking up his prescriptions: but when I followed him with the medicines\ninto the sick berth, or hospital, and observed the situation of the\npatients, I was much less surprised that people should die on board,\nthan that a sick person should recover. Here I saw about fifty miserable\ndistempered wretches, suspended in rows, so huddled one upon another,\nthat not more than fourteen inches space was allotted for each with his\nbed and bedding; and deprived of the light of the day, as well as of\nfresh air; breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid\nsteams exhaling from their own excrements and diseased bodies, devoured\nwith vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded them, and destitute of\nevery convenience necessary for people in that helpless condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nA disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my\noffice--Morgan's nose is offended--a dialogue between him and the Ship's\nsteward--upon examination, I find more causes of complaint than one--my\nhair is cut off--Morgan's cookery--the manner of sleeping on board--I am\nwaked in the night by a dreadful noise\n\nCould not comprehend how it was possible for the attendants to come near\nthose who hung on the inside towards the sides of the ship, in order to\nassist them, as they seemed barricadoed by those who lay on the outside,\nand entirely out of the reach of all visitation; much less could I\nconceive how my friend Thompson would be able to administer clysters,\nthat were ordered for some, in that situation; when I saw him thrust his\nwig in his pocket, and strip himself to his waistcoat in a moment, then\ncreep on all fours under the hammocks of the sick, and, forcing up his\nbare pate between two, keep them asunder with one shoulder, until he had\ndone his duty. Eager to learn the service, I desired he would give me\nleave to perform the next operation of that kind; and he consenting,\nI undressed myself after his example, and crawling along, the ship\nhappened to roll: this motion alarming me, I laid hold of the first\nthing that came within my grasp with such violence, that I overturned\nit, and soon found, by the smell that issued upon me, that I had\nunlocked a box of the most delicious perfume. It was well for me that\nmy nose was none of the most delicate, else I know not how I might have\nbeen affected by this vapour, which diffused itself all over the ship,\nto the utter discomposure of everybody who tarried on the same dock!\nneither was the consequence of this disgrace confined to my sense of\nsmelling only; for I felt my misfortune more ways than one. That I might\nnot, however, appear altogether disconcerted in this my first essay,\nI got up, and, pushing my head with great force between two hammocks,\ntowards the middle, where the greatest resistance was, I made an opening\nindeed, but, not understanding the knack of dexterously turning my\nshoulder to maintain my advantage, had the mortification to find myself\nstuck up, as it were, in a pillory, and the weight of three or four\npeople bearing on each side of my neck, so that I was in danger of\nstrangulation. While I remained in this defenceless posture, one of the\nsick men, rendered peevish by his distemper, was so enraged at the\nsmell I had occasioned and the rude shock he had received from me in my\nelevation, that, with many bitter reproaches, he seized me by the nose,\nwhich he tweaked so unmercifully, that I roared with anguish. Thompson,\nperceiving my condition, ordered one of the waiters to my assistance,\nwho, with much difficulty, disengaged me from this situation, and\nhindered me from taking vengeance on the sick man, whose indisposition\nwould not have screened him from the effects of my indignation.\n\nAfter having made an end of our ministry for that time, we descended to\nthe cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened with a homely\nproverb, which I do not choose to repeat. When we had descended half-way\ndown the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he saw us, having intelligence by\nhis nose of the approach of something extraordinary, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot have\nmercy upon my senses! I pelieve the enemy has poarded us in a stinkpot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Then, directing his discourse to the steward, from whence he imagined\nthe odour proceeded, he reprimanded him severely for the freedoms he\ntook among gentlemen of birth, and threatened to smoke him like a padger\nwith sulphur, if ever he should presume to offend his neighbours with\nsuch smells for the future. The steward, conscious of his own innocence,\nreplied with some warmth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know of no smells but those of your\nown making.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This repartee introduced a smart dialogue, in which the\nWelshman undertook to prove, that, though the stench he complained of\ndid not flow from the steward's own body, he was nevertheless the author\nof it, by serving out damaged provisions to the ship's company; and, in\nparticular, putrified cheese, from the use of which only, he affirmed,\nsuch unsavoury steams could arise. Then he launched out into the praise\nof good cheese, of which he gave the analysis; explained the different\nkinds of that commodity, with the methods practised to make and preserve\nit, concluded in observing, that, in yielding good cheese, the county of\nGlamorgan might vie with Cheshire itself, and was much superior to it in\nthe produce of goats and putter.\n\nI gathered from this conversation, that, if I entered in my present\npickle, I should be no welcome guest, and therefore desired Mr. Thompson\nto go before, and represent my calamity; at which the first mate,\nexpressing some concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his way\nthrough the cable-tier and the main hatchway, to avoid encountering\nme; desiring me to clean myself as soon as possible: for he intended to\nregale himself with a dish of salmagundy and a pipe. Accordingly, I set\nabout this disagreeable business, and soon found I had more causes of\ncomplaint than I at first imagined; for I perceived some guests had\nhonoured me with their company, whose visit I did not think seasonable:\nneither did they seem inclined to leave me in a hurry, for they were in\npossession of my chief quarters, where they fed without reserve at the\nexpense of my blood. But, considering it would be easier to extirpate\nthe ferocious colony in the infancy of their settlement, than after they\nshould be multiplied and naturalised to the soil, I took the advice of\nmy friend, who, to prevent such misfortunes, went always close shaved,\nand made the boy of our mess cut off my hair, which had been growing\nsince I left the service of Lavement; and the second mate lent me an old\nbobwig to supply the loss of that covering. This affair being ended, and\neverything adjusted in the best manner my circumstances would permit,\nthe descendant of Caractacus returned, and, ordering the boy to bring a\npiece of salt beef from the brine, cut off a slice, and mixed it with an\nequal quantity of onions, which seasoning with a moderate proportion of\npepper and salt, he brought it to a consistence with oil and vinegar;\nthen, tasting the dish, assured us it was the best salmagundy that ever\nhe made, and recommended it to our palate with such heartiness that\nI could not help doing honour to his preparation. But I had no sooner\nswallowed a mouthful, than I thought my entrails were scorched, and\nendeavoured with a deluge of small-beer to allay the heat it occasioned.\nSupper being over, Mr. Morgan having smoked a couple of pipes, and\nsupplied the moisture he had expended with as many cans of flip, of\nwhich we all partook, a certain yawning began to admonish me that it was\nhigh time to repair by sleep the injury I had suffered from want of rest\nthe preceding night; which being perceived by my companions, whose time\nof repose was now arrived, they proposed we should turn in, or in other\nwords, go to bed. Our hammocks, which hung parallel to one another, on\nthe outside of the berth, were immediately unlashed, and I beheld my\nmessmates spring with great agility into their respective nests, where\nthey seemed to lie concealed, very much at their ease. But it was some\ntime before I could prevail upon myself to trust my carcase at such a\ndistance from the ground, in a narrow bag, out of which, I imagined, I\nshould be apt, on the least motion in my sleep, to tumble down at\nthe hazard of breaking my bones. I suffered myself, however, to be\npersuaded, and taking a leap to get in, threw myself quite over, with\nsuch violence, that had I not luckily got hold of Thompson's hammock,\nI should have pitched upon my head on the other side, and in all\nlikelihood fractured my skull.\n\nAfter some fruitless efforts, I succeeded at last; but the apprehension\nof the jeopardy in which I believed myself withstood all the attacks of\nsleep till towards the morning watch, when, in spite of my fears, I was\noverpowered with slumber, though I did not long enjoy this comfortable\nsituation, being aroused with a noise so loud and shrill, that I thought\nthe drums of my ears were burst by it; this was followed by a dreadful\nsummons pronounced by a hoarse voice, which I could not understand.\nWhile I was debating with myself, whether or not I should wake my\ncompanion and inquire into the occasion of this disturbance, I was\ninformed by one of the quartermasters who passed by me with a lantern\nin his hand, that the noise which alarmed me was occasioned by the\nboatswain's mates who called up the larboard watch, and that I must lay\nmy account with such an interruption every morning at the same hour.\nBeing now more assured of my safety, I undressed myself again to rest,\nand slept till eight o'clock, when rising, and breakfasting with my\ncomrades on biscuit and brandy, the sick were visited and assisted as\nbefore; after which visitation my good friend Thompson explained and\nperformed another piece of duty, to which I was a stranger. At a certain\nhour in the morning, the boy of the mess went round all the decks,\nringing a small hand-bell, and, in rhymes composed for the occasion,\ninvited all those who had sores to repair before the mast, where one of\nthe doctor's mates attended, with applications to dress them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nI acquire the friendship of the Surgeon, who procures a warrant for me,\nand makes me a present of clothes--a battle between a Midshipman and\nme--the Surgeon leaves the ship--the Captain comes on board with another\nSurgeon--a dialogue between the Captain and Morgan--the sick are ordered\nto be brought upon the Quarter-deck and examined--the consequences of\nthat order--a Madman accuses Morgan, and is set at liberty by command of\nthe Captain, whom he instantly attacks, and pummels without mercy\n\nWhile I was busied with my friend in the practice. The doctor chanced\nto pass by the place where we were, and stopping to observe me appeared\nvery well satisfied with my application; and afterwards sent for me to\nhis cabin, where, having examined me touching my skill in surgery,\nand the particulars of my fortune, he interested himself so far in my\nbehalf, as to promise his assistance in procuring a warrant for me,\nseeing I had already been found qualified at Surgeons' Hall for the\nstation I filled on board; and in this good office he the more cordially\nengaged when he understood I was nephew to lieutenant Bowling, for whom\nhe expressed a particular regard. In the meantime, I could learn from\nhis discourse that he did not intend to go to sea again with Captain\nOakum, having, as he thought, been indifferently used by him during the\nlast voyage.\n\nWhile I lived tolerably easy, in expectation of preferment, I was not\naltogether without mortifications, which I not only suffered from the\nrude insults of the sailors and petty officers, among whom I was known\nby the name of Loblolly Boy, but also from the disposition of Morgan,\nwho, though friendly in the main, was often very troublesome with his\npride, which expected a good deal of submission from me, and delighted\nin recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands.\n\nAbout six weeks after my arrival on board, the surgeon, bidding me to\nfollow him into his cabin, presented a warrant to me, by which I\nwas appointed surgeon's third mate on board the Thunder. This he\nhad procured by his interest at the Navy Office; as also another\nfor himself, by virtue of which he was removed into a second-rate. I\nacknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could\nsuggest, and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing so valuable a\nfriend, to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further, by my\nrespectful and diligent behaviour. But his generosity rested not here;\nfor before he left the ship he made me a present of a chest and some\nclothes that enabled me to support the rank to which he had raised me.\n\nI found my spirit revive with my good fortune; and, now I was an\nofficer, resolved to maintain the dignity of my station, against all\nopposition or affronts; nor was it long before I had occasion to exert\nmy resolution. My old enemy, the midshipman (whose name was Crampley),\nentertaining an implacable animosity against me for the disgrace he had\nsuffered on my account, had since that time taken all opportunities of\nreviling and ridiculing me, when I was not entitled to retort this bad\nusage; and, even after I had been rated on the books, and mustered\nas surgeon's mate, did not think fit to restrain his insolence. In\nparticular, being one day present while I dressed a wound in a sailor's\nleg, he began to sing a song, which I thought highly injurious to\nthe honour of my country, and therefore signified my resentment, by\nobserving that the Scots always laid their account with finding enemies\namong the ignorant, insignificant, and malicious. This unexpected piece\nof assurance enraged him to such a degree, that he lent me a blow on\nthe face, which I verily thought had demolished my cheek-bone. I was\nnot slow in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very\nserious, when by accident Mr. Morgan, and one of the master's mates,\ncoming that way, interposed, and, inquiring into the cause, endeavoured\nto promote a reconciliation; but, finding us both exasperated to the\nuttermost, and bent against accommodation, they advised us either to\nleave our difference undecided, till we should have an opportunity of\nterminating it on shore, like gentlemen, or else choose a proper place\non board, and bring it to an issue by boxing. The last expedient was\ngreedily embraced by us both; and, being forthwith conducted to the\nground proposed, we stripped in a moment, and began a furious contest,\nin which I soon found myself inferior to my antagonist, not so much in\nstrength and agility, as in skill, which he had acquired in the school\nof Hockley-in-the-Hole at Tottenham-court. Many cross buttocks did I\nsustain, and pegs on the stomach without number, till at last my breath\nbeing quite gone, as well as my vigour wasted, I grew desperate, and\ncollecting all my strength in one effort, threw in at once, head, hands,\nand feet, with such violence, that I drove my antagonist three paces\nbackward into the main hatchway, down which he fell, and pitching upon\nhis head and right shoulder, remained without sense and motion. Morgan,\nlooking down, and seeing him lie in that condition, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my\nconscience, as I am a Christian sinner, (look you,) I believe his\npattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witness that there was no\ntreachery in the case, and that he has suffered by the chance of war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying he descended to the deck below, to examine into the situation\nof my adversary, and left me very little pleased with my victory, as I\nfound myself not only terribly bruised, but likewise in danger of being\ncalled to account for the death of Crampley; but this fear vanished when\nmy fellow-mate having, by bleeding him in the jugular, brought him to\nhimself, and inquired into the state of his body, called up to me to be\nunder no concern, for the midshipman had received no other damage than\nas pretty a luxation of the os humeri as one would desire to see on a\nsummer's day. Upon this information I crawled down to the cock-pit,\nand acquainted Thompson with the affair, who, providing himself with\nbandages, etc, necessary for the occasion, went up to assist Mr.\nMorgan in the reduction of the dislocation. When this was successfully\nperformed, they wished me joy of the event of the combat; and the\nWelshman, after observing, that, in all likelihood, the ancient Scots\nand Britons were the same people, bade me \u00e2\u0080\u009cpraise Cot for putting mettle\nin my pelly, and strength in my limbs to support it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I acquired\nsuch reputation by this rencontre, which lasted twenty minutes, that\neverybody became more cautious in behaviour towards me; though Crampley,\nwith his arm in a sling, talked very high, and threatened to seize the\nfirst opportunity of retrieving on shore the honour he had lost by an\naccident, from which I could justly claim no merit.\n\nAbout this time, Captain Oakum, having received sailing orders, came on\nboard, and brought along with him a surgeon of his own country, who\nsoon made us sensible of the loss we suffered in the departure of Doctor\nAtkins; for he was grossly ignorant, and intolerably assuming, false,\nvindictive, and unforgiving; a merciless tyrant to his inferiors, an\nabject sycophant to those above him. In the morning after the captain\ncame on board, our first mate, according to custom, went to wait on him\nwith a sick list, which, when this grim commander had perused, he cried\nwith a stern countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and cons! sixty-one sick people on\nboard of my ship! Harkee, you sir, I'll have no sick in my ship, by\nG--d.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Welshman replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009che should be very glad to find no sick\npeople on board: but, while it was otherwise, he did no more than his\nduty in presenting him with a list.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou and your list may be d--n'd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the captain, throwing it at him; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, there shall be no sick in\nthis ship while I have the command of her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Morgan, being nettled\nat this treatment, told him his indignation ought to be directed to Cot\nAlmighty, who visited his people with distempers, and not to him, who\ncontributed all in his power towards their cure. The bashaw, not being\nused to such behaviour in any of his officers, was enraged to fury at\nthis satirical insinuation, and, stamping with his foot, called him\ninsolent scoundrel, threatening to have him pinioned to the deck, if he\nshould presume to utter another syllable. But the blood of Caractacus\nbeing thoroughly heated, disdained to be restricted by such a command,\nand began to manifest itself in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Oakum, I am a shentleman of\nbirth and parentage (look you), and peradventure I am moreover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Here his harangue was broken off by the captain's steward, who, being\nMorgan's countryman, hurried him out of the cabin before he had time to\nexasperate his master to a greater degree, and this would certainly have\nbeen the case; for the indignant Welshman could hardly be hindered\nby his friend's arguments and entreaties from re-entering the\npresence-chamber, and defying Captain Oakum to his teeth. He was,\nhowever appeased at length, and came down to the berth, where, finding\nThompson and me at work preparing medicines, he bade us leave off our\nlapour to go to play, for the captain, by his sole word, and power, and\ncommand, had driven sickness a pegging to the tevil, and there was no\nmore malady on board. So saying, he drank off a gill of brandy sighed\ngrievously three times, poured fort an ejaculation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot pless my\nheart, liver, and lungs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then began to sing a Welsh song with great\nearnestness of visage, voice, and gesture. I could not conceive the\nmeaning of this singular phenomenon, and saw by the looks of\nThompson, who at the same time shook his head, that he suspected poor\nCadwallader's brains were unsettled. He, perceiving our amazement,\ntold us he would explain the mystery; but at the same time bade us take\nnotice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man, and widower,\nalmost forty years, and in all that time there was no man, nor mother's\nson in the whole world who durst use him so ill as Captain Oakum had\ndone. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that passed between them,\nas I have already related it: and had no sooner finished this narration\nthan he received a message from the surgeon, to bring the sick-list to\nthe quarter-deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither\nto be reviewed.\n\nThis inhuman order shocked us extremely, as we knew it would be\nimpossible to carry some of them on the deck, without imminent danger of\ntheir lives: but, as we likewise knew it would be to no purpose for us\nto remonstrate against it, we repaired to the quarter-deck in a body,\nto see this extraordinary muster; Morgan observing by the way, that the\ncaptain was going to send to the other world a great many evidences to\ntestify against himself. When we appeared upon deck, the captain bade\nthe doctor, who stood bowing at his right hand, look at these lazy\nlubberly sons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board but to\neat the king's provision, and encourage idleness in the skulkers. The\nsurgeon grinned approbation, and, taking the list, began to examine the\ncomplaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed. The first\nwho came under his cognizance was a poor fellow just freed of a fever,\nwhich had weakened him so much that he could hardly stand. Mr. Mackshane\n(for that was the doctor's name), having felt his pulse, protested he\nwas as well as any man in the world; and the captain delivered him over\nto the boatswain's mate, with orders that he should receive a round\ndozen at the gangway immediately, for counterfeiting himself sick; but,\nbefore the discipline could be executed, the man dropped down on the\ndeck, and had well nigh perished under the hands of the executioner. The\nnext patient to be considered, laboured under a quartan ague, and,\nbeing then in his interval of health, discovered no other symptoms of\ndistemper than a pale meagre countenance and emaciated body; upon which\nhe was declared fit for duty, and turned over to the boatswain; but,\nbeing resolved to disgrace the doctor, died upon the forecastle next\nday, during his cold fit. The third complained of a pleuritic stitch,\nand spitting of blood, for which Doctor Mackshane prescribed exercise at\nthe pump to promote expectoration! but whether this was improper for one\nin his situation, or that it was used to excess, I know not, but in less\nthan half-an-hour he was suffocated with a deluge of blood that\nissued from his lungs. A fourth, with much difficulty, climbed to the\nquarter-deck, being loaded with a monstrous ascites, or dropsy, that\ninvaded his chest so much, he could scarce fetch his breath; but his\ndisease being interpreted into fat, occasioned by idleness and excess of\neating, he was ordered, with a view to promote perspiration and enlarge\nhis chest, to go aloft immediately. It was in vain for this unwieldy\nwretch to allege his utter incapacity; the boatswain's driver was\ncommanded to whip him up with the cat-and-nine-tails; the smart of this\napplication made him exert himself so much, that he actually arrived\nat the puttock shrouds; but when the enormous weight of his body had\nnothing else to support than his weakened arms, either out of spite or\nnecessity, he quitted his hold, and plunged into the sea, where he must\nhave been drowned, had not a sailor, who was in a boat alongside,\nsaved his life, by keeping him afloat till he was hoisted on board by a\ntackle.\n\nIt would be tedious and disagreeable to describe the fate of every\nmiserable object that suffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the\ncaptain and surgeon, who so wantonly sacrificed the lives of their\nfellow-creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and\nrendered delirious by the injuries they received in the way. Some gave\nup the ghost in the presence of their inspectors; and others, who were\nordered to their duties, languished a few days at work among their\nfellows, and then departed without any ceremony. On the whole, the\nnumber of the sick was reduced to less than a dozen; and the authors of\nthis reduction were applauding themselves for the services they had\ndone to their king and country, when the boatswain's mate informed his\nhonour, that there was a man below lashed to his hammock, by direction\nof the doctor's mate, and that he begged hard to be released; affirming,\nhe had been so maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore him, and\nthat he was as much in his senses as any man aboard. The captain hearing\nthis, darted a severe look at the Welshman, and ordered the man to\nbe brought up immediately; upon which, Morgan protested with great\nfervency, that the person in question was as mad as a March hare; and\nbegged for the love of Cot, they would at least keep his arms pinioned\nduring his examination, to prevent him from doing mischief. This request\nthe commander granted for his own sake, and the patient was produced,\nwho insisted upon his being in his right wits with such calmness and\nstrength of argument, that everybody present was inclined to believe\nhim, except Morgan, who affirmed there was no trusting to appearances;\nfor he himself had been so much imposed upon by his behaviour two days\nbefore, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and\nhad well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the\nevidence of one of the waiters, who declared he had pulled this patient\nfrom the doctor's mate, whom he had gotten down, and almost strangled.\nTo this the man answered, that the witness was a creature of Morgan's,\nand suborned to give his testimony against him by the malice of the\nmate, whom the defendant had affronted, by discovering to the people on\nboard, that Mr. Morgan's wife kept a gin-shop in Ragfair. This anecdote\nproduced a laugh at the expense of the Welshman, who, shaking his head\nwith some emotion, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, 'tis no matter. Cot knows, it is\nan arrant falsehood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Captain Oakum, without any farther hesitation,\nordered the fellow to be unfettered; at the same time, threatening to\nmake Morgan exchange situations with him for his spite; but the Briton\nno sooner heard the decision in favour of the madman, than he got up to\nthe mizen-shrouds, crying to Thompson and me to get out of his reach,\nfor we should see him play the devil with a vengeance. We did not think\nfit to disregard his caution, and accordingly got up on the poop, whence\nwe beheld the maniac (as soon as he was released) fly at the captain\nlike a fury, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll let you know, you scoundrel, that I am\ncommander of this vessel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pummel him without mercy. The surgeon,\nwho went to the assistance of his patron, shared the same fate; and\nit was with the utmost difficulty that he was mastered at last, after\nhaving done great execution among those who opposed him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThe Captain enraged, threatens to put the Madman to death with his own\nhand--is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion\nof the first Lieutenant and Surgeon--we set sail for St. Helen's, join\nthe fleet under the command of Sir C-- O--gle, and proceed for the West\nIndies--are overtaken by a terrible tempest--my friend Jack Rattlin\nhas his leg broke by a fall from the mainyard--the behaviour of Mr.\nMackshane--Jack opposes the amputation of his limb, in which he\nis seconded by Morgan and me, we undertake the cure and perform it\nsuccessfully\n\nThe captain was carried into his cabin, so enraged with the treatment he\nhad received, that he ordered the fellow to be brought before him, that\nhe might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand; and would\ncertainly have satisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the\nfirst lieutenant remonstrated against it, by observing that, in all\nappearances, the fellow was not mad, but desperate; that he had been\nhired by some enemy of the captain's to him, and therefore ought to be\nkept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no\ndoubt, would sift the affair to the bottom (by which means important\ndiscoveries might be made), and then sentence the criminal to a death\naccording to his demerits. This suggestion, improbable as it was, had\nthe desired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the\nmeridan of his intellects; more especially as Dr. Mackshane espoused\nthis opinion, in consequence of his previous declaration that the man\nwas not mad. Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not\nhelp discovering by his countenance the pleasure he enjoyed on this\noccasion; and, while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation,\nventured to ask him, whether he thought there were more fools or madmen\non board? But he would have been wiser in containing this sally, which\nhis patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at\na more fit season. Meanwhile we weighed anchor, and, on our way to the\nDowns, the madman, who was treated as a prisoner, took an opportunity,\nwhile the sentinel attending him was at the head, to leap and frustrate\nthe revenge of the captain. We stayed not long at the Downs, but took\nthe benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead: where,\nhaving received provisions on board for six months, we sailed from\nSt. Helen's in the grand fleet bound for the West Indies, on the\never-memorable expedition of Carthagena.\n\nIt was not without great mortification I saw myself on the point of\nbeing transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate, destitute of\nevery convenience that could render such a voyage supportable, and\nunder the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant, whose command was almost\nintolerable; however, as these complaints were common to a great many on\nboard, I resolved to submit patiently to my fate, and contrive to make\nmyself as easy as the nature of the case would allow. We got out of the\nchannel with a prosperous breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed\nabout fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard: but this state of\ninaction did not last long; for next night our maintop-sail was split\nby the wind, which, in the morning, increased to a hurricane. I was\nawakened by a most horrible din, occasioned by the play of the gun\ncarriages upon the decks above, the cracking of cabins, the howling of\nthe wind through the shrouds, the confused noise of the ship's crew, the\npipes of the boatswain and his mates, the trumpets of the lieutenants,\nand the clanking of the chain pumps. Morgan who had never been at\nsea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot have mercy and\ncompassion upon us! I believe, we have cot upon the confines of Lucifer\nand the d--n'd!\u00e2\u0080\u009d while poor Thompson lay quaking in his hammock, putting\nup petitions to heaven for our safety. I rose and joined the Welshman,\nwith whom (after having fortified ourselves with brandy) I went above;\nbut if my sense of hearing was startled before, how must my sight have\nbeen apalled in beholding the effects of the storm! The sea was swelled\ninto billows mountain-high, on the top of which our ship sometimes hung\nas if it were about to be precipitated to the abyss below! Sometimes\nwe sank between two waves that rose on each side higher than our\ntopmast-head, and threatened by dashing together to overwhelm us in a\nmoment! Of all our fleet, consisting of a hundred and fifty sail, scarce\ntwelve appeared, and these driving under their bare poles, at the mercy\nof the tempest. At length the mast of one of them gave way, and tumbled\noverboard with a hideous crash! Nor was the prospect in our own ship\nmuch more agreeable; a number of officers and sailors ran backward and\nforward with distraction in their looks, halloaing to one another, and\nundetermined what they should attend to first. Some clung to the yards,\nendeavouring to unbend the sails that were split into a thousand pieces\nflapping in the wind; others tried to furl those which were yet whole,\nwhile the masts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if\nthey would have shivered into innumerable splinters! While I considered\nthis scene with equal terror and astonishment, one of the main braces\nbroke, by the shock whereof two sailors were flung from the yard's arm\ninto the sea, where they perished, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown\ndown upon the deck, at the expense of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran\nimmediately to his assistance, and found a splinter of the shin-bone\nthrust by the violence of the fall through the skin; as this was a case\nof too great consequence to be treated without the authority of the\ndoctor I went down to his cabin to inform him of the accident, as well\nas to bring up dressings which we always kept ready prepared. I entered\nhis apartment without any ceremony, and, by the glimmering of a lamp,\nperceived him on his knees before something that very much resembled a\ncrucifix; but this I will not insist upon, that I may not seem too much\na slave to common report, which indeed assisted my conjecture on this\noccasion, by representing Dr. Mackshane as a member of the church of\nRome. Be this as it will, he got up in a sort of confusion, occasioned\n(I suppose) by his being disturbed in his devotion, and in a trice\nsnatched the subject of my suspicion from my sight.\n\nAfter making an apology for my intrusion, I acquainted him with the\nsituation of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon him to visit\nhim on deck, where he lay; he bade me desire the boatswain to order some\nof the men to carry him down to the cockpit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand in the meantime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will direct Thompson to get ready the dressings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I\nsignified to the boatswain the doctor's desire, he swore a terrible\noath, that he could not spare one man from deck, because he expected the\nmast would go by the board every minute. This piece of information did\nnot at all contribute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin\ncomplained very much, with the assistance of Morgan I supported him to\nthe lower deck, whither Mr. Mackshane, after much entreaty, ventured to\ncome, attended by Thompson, with a box full of dressings, and his own\nservant, who carried a whole set of capital instruments. He examined the\nfracture and the wound, and concluding, from a livid colour extending\nitself upon the limb, that mortification would ensue, resolved to\namputate the leg immediately. This was a dreadful sentence to the\npatient, who, recruiting himself with a quid of tobacco, pronounced\nwith a woful countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! is there no remedy, doctor! must I be\ndock'd? can't you splice it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuredly, Doctor Mackshane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nfirst mate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith submission, and deference, and veneration, to your\nsuperior apilities, and opportunities, and stations, look you, I\ndo apprehend, and conjure, and aver, that there is no occasion nor\nnecessity to smite off this poor man's leg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod Almighty bless you,\ndear Welshman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Rattlin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay you have fair wind and weather\nwheresoever you're bound, and come to an anchor in the road of heaven at\nlast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mackshane, very much incensed at his mate's differing in opinion\nfrom him, so openly, answered, that he was not bound to give an account\nof his practice to him; and in a peremptory tone, ordered him to apply\nthe tourniquet. At the sight of which, Jack, starting up, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAvast,\navast! D--n my heart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know\nwherefore! Mr. Random, won't you lend a hand towards saving my precious\nlimb! Odd's heart, if Lieutenant Bowling was here, he would not suffer\nJack Rattlin's leg to be chopped off like a piece of old junk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis pathetic address to me, joined to my inclination to serve my honest\nfriend, and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in delaying\nthe amputation, induced me to declare myself of the first mate's\nopinion, and affirm that the preternatural colour of the skin was owing\nto an inflammation, occasioned by a contusion, and common in all such\ncases, without any indication of an approaching gangrene. Morgan, who\nhad a great opinion of my skill, manifestly exulted in my fellowship,\nand asked Thompson's sentiments in the matter, in hopes of strengthening\nour association with him too; but he, being of a meek disposition, and\neither dreading the enmity of the surgeon, or speaking the dictates of\nhis own judgment, in a modest manner espoused the opinion of Mackshane,\nwho by this time having consulted with himself, determined to act in\nsuch a manner as to screen himself from censure, and at the same time\nrevenge himself on us, for our arrogance in contradicting him. With this\nview, he asked if we would undertake to cure the leg at our peril: that\nis, be answerable for the consequence. To this question, Morgan replied,\nthat the lives of his creatures are at the hands of Cot alone; and it\nwould be great presumption in him to undertake for an event that was in\nthe power of his Maker, no more than the doctor could promise to cure\nall the sick to whom he administered his assistance; but if the patient\nwould put himself under our direction, we would do our endeavour to\nbring his distemper to a favourable issue, to which at present we saw no\nobstruction.\n\nI signified my concurrence; and Rattlin was so overjoyed that, shaking\nus both by the hands, he swore nobody else should touch him, and, if he\ndied, his blood should be upon his own head. Mr. Mackshane, flattering\nhimself with the prospect of our miscarriage, went away, and left us to\nmanage it as we should think proper; accordingly, having sawed off part\nof the splinter that stuck through the skin, we reduced the fracture,\ndressed the wound, applied the eighteen-tailed bandage, and put the leg\nin a box, secundam artem. Everything succeeded according to our wish,\nand we had the satisfaction of not only preserving the poor fellow's\nleg, but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the ship's\ncompany, who had all their eyes on us during the course of this cure,\nwhich was completed in six weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nMackshane's malice--I am taken up and imprisoned for a spy--Morgan meets\nwith the same fate--Thompson is tampered with to turn evidence against\nus--disdains the proposal, and is maltreated for his integrity--Morgan\nis released to assist the Surgeon during an engagement with some French\nships-of-war--I remain fettered on the poop, exposed to the enemy's\nshot, and grow delirious with fear--am comforted after the battle by\nMorgan, who speaks freely of the captain, is overheard by the sentinel,\nwho informs against him, and again imprisoned--Thompson grows desperate,\nand, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me, goes overboard\nin the night\n\nIn the meantime the storm subsided into a brisk gale, that carried us\ninto the warm latitudes, where the weather became intolerable, and\nthe crew very sickly. The doctor left nothing unattempted towards the\ncompletion of his vengeance against the Welshman and me. He went among\nthe sick under pretence of inquiring into their grievances, with a\nview of picking up complaints to our prejudice; but, finding himself\nfrustrated in that expectation by the goodwill we had procured from\nthe patients by our diligence and humanity, he took the resolution of\nlistening to our conversation, by hiding himself behind the canvas that\nsurrounded our berth; here too he was detected by the boy of our mess,\nwho acquainted us with this piece of behaviour, and one night, while we\nwere picking a large bone of salt beef, Morgan discerned something stir\non the outside of our hangings, which immediately interpreting to be the\ndoctor, he tipped me the wink, and pointed to the place, where I could\nperceive somebody standing; upon which, I snatched up the bone, and\nlevelled it with all my force at him, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoever you are, take\nthat for your curiosity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It had the desired effect, for we heard the\nlistener tumble down, and afterwards crawl to his own cabin. I applauded\nmyself much for this feat, which turned out one of the most unlucky\nexploits of my life, Mackshane, from that time, marking me out for\ndestruction.\n\nAbout a week after this exploit, as I was going my rounds among\nthe sick, I was taken prisoner, and carried to the poop by the\nmaster-at-arms, where I was loaded with irons, and stapled to the deck,\non pretence that I was a spy on board, and had conspired against the\ncaptain's life. How ridiculous soever this imputation was, I did not\nfail to suffer by it all the rigour that could be shown to the worst of\ncriminals, being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching\nheat of the sun by day, and the unwholesome damps by night, during\nthe space of twelve days, in which I was neither brought to trial,\nnor examined touching the probability of the charge. I had no sooner\nrecovered the use of my reflection, which had been quite overthrown by\nthis accident, than I sent for Thompson, who, after condoling me on\nthe occasion, hinted, that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of\nthe doctor, who had given an information against me to the captain, in\nconsequence of which I was arrested, and all my papers seized. While I\nwas cursing my capricious fate, I saw Morgan ascend the poop, guarded by\ntwo corporals, who made him sit down by me, that he might be pinioned in\nthe same machine. Notwithstanding my situation, I could scarce refrain\nfrom laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner, who, without\nspeaking one word, allowed his feet to be inclosed in the rings provided\nfor that purpose; but, when they pretended to fasten him on his back\nhe grew outrageous, and drawing a large couteau from his side-pocket,\nthreatened to rip up the belly of the first man that should approach\nhim, in order to treat him in such an unworthy manner. They were\nprepared to use him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the\nquarter-deck called up to them to let him remain as he was. He then\ncrept towards me, and, taking me by the hand, bade me \u00e2\u0080\u009cput my trust\nin Cot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And looking at Thompson, who sat by us trembling, with a pale\nvisage; told him there were two more rings for his feet, and he should\nbe glad to find him in such good company. But it was not the intention\nof our adversary to include the second mate in our fate: him he expected\nto be his drudge in attending the sick and, if possible, his evidence\nagainst us: with this view he sounded him afar off, but, finding his\nintegrity incorruptible, harrassed him so much out of spite, that in a\nshort time this mild creature grew weary of his life.\n\nWhile I and my fellow prisoner comforted each other in our tribulation,\nthe admiral discovered four sail to leeward and made signal for our\nship and four more to chase: hereupon everything was cleared for an\nengagement, and Mackshane, foreseeing he should have occasion for more\nassistants than one obtained Morgan's liberty, while I was let in this\ndeplorable posture to the chance of battle. It was almost dark when we\ncame up with the sternmost chase, which we hailed, and inquired who they\nwere. They gave us to understand they were French men-of-war, upon which\nCaptain Oakum commanded them to send their boat on board of him! but\nthey refused, telling him, if he had any business with them, to come\non board of their ship: he then threatened to pour in a broadside upon\nthem, which they promised to retain. Both sides were as good as their\nword, and the engagement began with great fury. The reader may guess how\nI passed my time, lying in this helpless situation, amidst the terrors\nof a sea-fight; expecting every moment to be cut asunder, or dashed in\npieces by the enemy's shot! I endeavoured to compose myself as much as\npossible, by reflecting that I was not a whit more exposed than those\nwho were stationed about me; but, when I beheld them employed without\nintermission in annoying the foe, and encouraged by the society and\nbehaviour of one another, I could easily perceive a wide difference\nbetween their condition and mine: however, I concealed my agitation as\nwell as I could till the head of the officer of marines who stood near\nme, being shot off, bounced from the deck athwart my face, leaving me\nwell nigh blinded with brains. I could contain myself no longer, but\nbegan to bellow with all the strength of my lungs; when a drummer,\ncoming towards me asked if I was wounded, and, before I could answer,\nreceived a great shot in his belly, which tore out his entrails, and\nhe fell flat on my breast. This accident entirely bereft me of all\ndiscretion; I redoubled my cries, which were drowned in the noise of the\nbattle; and, finding myself disregarded, lost all patience, and became\nfrantic. I vented my rage in oaths and execrations, till my spirits,\nbeing quite exhausted, I remained quiet, as insensible of the load that\noppressed me.\n\nThe engagement lasted till broad day, when Captain Oakum, finding he was\nlike to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair, pretended to\nbe undeceived by seeing their colours; and, hailing the ship whom he\nhad fought all night, protested he believed them Spaniards; and the guns\nbeing silenced on each side, ordered the barge to be hoisted out, and\nwent on board the French commodore. Our loss amounted to ten killed, and\neighteen wounded, most part of whom afterwards died. My fellow-mates\nhad no sooner despatched their business in the cock-pit, than, full of\nfriendly concern, they came to visit me. Morgan, ascending first, and\nseeing my face almost covered with brains and blood, concluded I was\nno longer a man for this world; and, calling to Thompson with great\nemotion, bade him come up, and take his last farewell of his comrade\nand countryman, who was posted to a better place, where there were no\nMackshanes nor Oakums to asperse and torment him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, taking\nme by the hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are going to a country where there is more respect\nsown to unfortunate shentlemen, and where you will have the satisfaction\nof peholding your adversaries tossing upon pillows of purning\nprimstone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thompson, alarmed at this apostrophe, made haste to the\nplace where I lay, and sitting down by me, with tears in his eyes\ninquired into the nature of my calamity. By this time I had recollected\nmyself so far as to be able to converse rationally with my friends,\nwhom, to their great satisfaction, I immediately undeceived with regard\nto their apprehension of my being mortally wounded.\n\nAfter I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed,\nand partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them,\nwe entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained, and spoke\nvery freely of the author of our misery; but our discourse being\noverheard by the sentinel who guarded me, he was no sooner relieved than\nhe reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation, according\nto the orders he had received. The effect of this information soon\nappeared in the arrival of the master-at-arms, who replaced Morgan in\nhis former station, and gave the second mate a caution to keep a strict\nguard over his tongue, if he did not choose to accompany us in our\nconfinement. Thompson, foreseeing that the whole slavery of attending\nthe sick and wounded, as well as the cruelty of Mackshane, must now fall\nupon his shoulders, grew desperate at the prospect, and, though I never\nheard him swear before, imprecated dreadful curses on the heads of his\noppressors, declaring that he would rather quit life altogether than\nbe much longer under the power of such barbarians. I was not a little\nstartled at his vivacity, and endeavoured to alleviate his complaints,\nby representing the subject of my own, with as much aggravation as it\nwould bear, by which comparison he might see the balance of misfortune\nlay on my side, and take an example from me of fortitude and submission,\ntill such time as we could procure redress, which I hoped was not far\noff, considering that we should probably be in a harbour in less than\nthree days, where we should have an opportunity of preferring our\ncomplaints to the admiral. The Welshman joined in my remonstrance, and\nwas at great pains to demonstrate that it was every man's duty as well\nas interest to resign himself to the divine will, and look upon himself\nas a sentinel upon duty, who is by no means at liberty to leave his post\nbefore he is relieved. Thompson listened attentively to what he said,\nand at last, shedding a flood of tears, shook his hand, and left us\nwithout making any reply. About eleven at night he came to see us again\nwith a settled gloom on his countenance, and gave us to understand that\nhe had undergone excessive toil since he saw us, and in recompense had\nbeen grossly abused by the doctor, who taxed him with being confederate\nwith us, in a design of taking away his life and that of the captain.\nAfter some time spent in mutual exhortation, he got up, and squeezing me\nby the hand with uncommon fervour, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod bless you both!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and left\nus to wonder at his singular manner of parting with us, which did not\nfail to make a deep impression on us both.\n\nNext morning, when the hour of visitation came round, the unhappy\nyoung man was missing, and, after strict search, supposed to have gone\noverboard in the night; and this was certainly the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nWe lament the fate of our companion--the Captain offers Morgan his\nliberty, which he refuses to accept--we are brought before him and\nexamined--Morgan is sent back into custody, whither also I am remanded\nafter a curious trial\n\nThe news of this event affected my fellow prisoner and me extremely, as\nour unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable disposition\nthe love and esteem of us both; and the more we regretted his\nuntimely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who\nwas undoubtedly the occasion of it. This abandoned miscreant did not\ndiscover the least symptom of concern for Thompson's death, although he\nmust have been conscious to himself of having driven him by ill usage to\nthe fatal resolution, but desired the captain to set Morgan at liberty\nagain to look after the patients. Accordingly one of the corporals was\nsent up to unfetter him, but he protested he would not be released until\nhe should know for what he was confined; nor would he be a tennisball,\nnor a shuttlecock, nor a trudge, nor a scullion, to any captain under\nthe sun. Oakum, finding him obstinate, and fearing it would not be in\nhis power to exercise his tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing\nto show some appearance of justice and therefore ordered us both to be\nbrought before him on the quarter-deck, where he sat in state, with his\ncleric on one side, and his counsellor Mackshane on the other. When we\napproached, he honoured us with this salutation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, gentlemen, d--n\nmy blood! many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to\nbe tucked up to the yard's arm, without either judge or jury, for the\ncrimes you have been guilty of; but, d--n my blood, I have too much good\nnature in allowing such dogs as you to make defence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Oakum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said my fellow-sufferer, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly it is in your power (Cot help\nthe while) to tack us all up at your will, desire, and pleasures.\nAnd perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be tucked up than to\nundergo the miseries to which we have been exposed. So may the farmer\nhang his kids for his diversion, and amusement, and mirth; but there is\nsuch a thing as justice, if not upon earth, surely in heaven, that will\npunish with fire and primstone all those who take away the lives of\ninnocent people out of wantonness, and parparity (look you). In the mean\ntime. I shall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge, and see\nthe person who accuses me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you shall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere,\ndoctor, what have you to say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mackshane, stepping forward, hemmed a\ngood while, in order to clear his throat, and, before he began, Morgan\naccosted him thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor Mackshane, look in my face--look in the face\nof an honest man, who abhors a false witness as he abhors the tevil,\nand Cot be judge between you and me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The doctor, not minding this\nconjuration, made the following speech, as near as I can remember: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll\ntell you what, Mr. Morgan; to be sure what you say is just, in regard\nto an honest man, and if so be it appears as how you are an honest man,\nthen it is my opinion that you deserve to be acquitted, in relation to\nthat there affair, for I tell you what, Captain Oakum is resolved for to\ndo everybody justice. As for my own part, all that I have to allege is,\nthat I have been informed you have spoken disrespectful words against\nyour captain, who, to be sure, is the most honourable and generous\ncommander in the king's service, without asparagement or acception of\nman, woman, or child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving uttered this elegant harangue, on which he seemed to plume\nhimself, Morgan replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do partly guess, and conceive, and\nunderstand your meaning, which I wish could be more explicit; but,\nhowever, I do suppose, I am not to be condemned upon bare hearsay; or,\nif I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of Captain Oakum, I hope\nthere is no treason in my words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there's mutiny, by G--d, and\nthat's death by the articles of war!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Oakum: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meantime, let\nthe witnesses be called.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hereupon Mackshane's servant appeared, and the\nboy of our mess, whom they had seduced and tutored for the purpose. The\nfirst declared, that Morgan as he descended the cockpit-ladder one day,\ncursed the captain, and called him a savage beast, saying, he ought to\nbe hunted down as an enemy to mankind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the clerk, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a\nstrong presumption of a design, formed against the captain's life. For\nwhy? It presupposes malice aforethought, and a criminal intention a\npriori.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain to this miserable grub, who had\nbeen an attorney's boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall have law enough: here's Cook and\nLittlejohn to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This evidence was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed,\nhe heard the first mate say, that the captain had no more bowels than a\nbear, and the surgeon had no more brain than an ass. Then the sentinel,\nwho heard our discourse on the poop was examined, and informed the court\nthat the Welshman assured me, Captain Oakum and Doctor Mackshane would\ntoss upon billows of burning brimstone in hell for their barbarity. The\nclerk observed, that there was an evident prejudication, which confirmed\nthe former suspicion of a conspiracy against the life of Captain Oakum;\nfor, because, how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain\nand surgeon would d--n'd, unless he had intention to make away with them\nbefore they could have time to repent? This sage explanation had great\nweight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you to say to\nthis, Taffy? you seem to be taken all a-back, brother, ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgan\nwas too much of a gentleman to disown the text, although he absolutely\ndenied the truth of the comment. Upon which the captain, strutting up\nto him with a ferocious countenance, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo Mr. son of a bitch, you\nconfess you honoured me with the names of bear and beast, and pronounced\nmy damnation? D--n my heart! I have a good mind to have you brought to a\ncourt-martial and hang'd, you dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here Mackshane, having occasion for\nan assistant, interposed, and begged the captain to pardon Mr. Morgan\nwith his wonted goodness, upon condition that he the delinquent should\nmake such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour demanded.\nUpon which the Cambro-Briton, who on this occasion would have made no\nsubmission to the Great Mogul, surrounded with his guards, thanked the\ndoctor for his mediation, and acknowledged himself in the wrong for\ncalling the image of Cot a peast, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spoke by metaphor,\nand parable, and comparison, and types; as we signify meekness by a\nlamb, lechery by a goat, and craftiness by a fox; so we liken ignorance\nto an ass, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a tiger; therefore I\nmade use of these similes to express my sentiments (look you), and what\nI said before Cot, I will not unsay before man nor peast neither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOakum was so provoked at this insolence (as he termed it,) that he\nordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement, and\nhis clerk to proceed on the examination of me. The first question put\nto me was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be the\nnorth of Scotland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe north of Ireland more like!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the captain;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we shall bring you up presently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then asked what religion I\nprofessed; and when I answered \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Protestant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d swore I was an\narrant Roman as ever went to mass. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, clerk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccatechise him a little on this subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But before I relate the\nparticulars of the clerk's inquiries, it will not be amiss to inform the\nreader that our commander himself was an Hibernian, and, if not shrewdly\nbelied, a Roman Catholic to boot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou say, you are a Protestant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe clerk; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake the sign of the cross with your finger, so, and swear\nupon it to that affirmation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I was about to perform the ceremony,\nthe captain cried with some emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, d--me! I'll have no\nprofanation neither. But go on with your interrogations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n proceeded my examiner, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow many sacraments are there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which I\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBaptism and the\nLord's Supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so you would explode confirmation and marriage\naltogether?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Oakum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought this fellow was a rank Roman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nclerk, though he was bred under an attorney, could not refrain from\nblushing at this blunder, which he endeavoured to conceal, by observing,\nthat these decoys would not do with me, who seemed to be an old\noffender. He went on with asking, if I believed in transubstantiation;\nbut I treated the notion of real presence with such disrespect, that his\npatron was scandalised at my impiety, and commanded him to proceed to\nthe plot. Whereupon this miserable pettifogger told me, there was great\nreason to suspect me of being a spy on board, and that I had entered\ninto a conspiracy with Thompson, and others not yet detected, against\nthe life of Captain Oakum, which accusation they pretended to support\nby the evidence of our boy, who declared he had often heard the deceased\nThompson and me whispering together, and could distinguish the words,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOakum, rascal, poison, pistol;\u00e2\u0080\u009d by which expressions it appeared, we\ndid intend to use sinister means to accomplish his destruction. That the\ndeath of Thompson seemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling\nthe stings of remorse for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy,\nor fearing a discovery, by which he must have infallibly suffered an\nignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own existence. But what\nestablished the truth of the whole was, a book in cyphers found among\nmy papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his chest, after his\ndisappearance. This, he observed, was a presumption very near positive\nproof, and would determine any jury in Christendom to find me guilty.\nIn my own defence, I alleged, that I had been dragged on board at first\nvery much against my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence\nof some people now in the ship, consequently could have no design of\nbecoming spy at that time; and ever since had been entirely out of the\nreach of any correspondence that could justly entail that suspicion\nupon me. As for conspiring against my captain's life, it could not be\nsupposed that any man in his right wits would harbour the least thought\nof such an undertaking, which he could not possibly perform without\ncertain infamy and ruin to himself, even if he had all the inclination\nin the world. That, allowing the boy's evidence to be true (which I\naffirmed was false and malicious), nothing conclusive could be gathered\nfrom a few incoherent words; neither was the fate of Mr. Thompson a\ncircumstance more favourable for the charge; for I had in my pocket a\nletter which too well explained that mystery, in a very different manner\nfrom that which was supposed. With these words, I produced the following\nletter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the very day after Thompson\ndisappeared; and told me it was committed to his care by the deceased,\nwho made him promise not to deliver it sooner. The clerk, taking it out\nof my hand, read aloud the contents, which were these;\n\n\n'Dear Friend,--I am so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and\nnightly undergo, and the barbarous usage of Doctor Mackshane, who is\nbent on your destruction as well as mine, that I am resolved to free\nmyself from this miserable life, and, before you receive this, shall\nbe no more. I could have wished to die in your good opinion, which I am\nafraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life; but, if you cannot\nacquit me, I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory\nof an unfortunate young man who loved you. I recommend it to you, to\nbeware of Mackshane, whose revenge is implacable. I wish all prosperity\nto you and Mr. Morgan, to whom pray offer my last respects, and beg to\nbe remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman, 'William Thompson.'\n\nThis letter was no sooner read, than Mackshane, in a transport of\nrage, snatched it out of the clerk's hands, and tore it into a thousand\npieces, saying, it was a villainous forgery, contrived and executed by\nmyself. The captain and clerk declared themselves of the same opinion,\nalthough I insisted of having the remains of it compared with other\nwritings of Thompson, which they had in their possession; and I was\nordered to answer the last article of my accusation, namely, the book of\nciphers found among my papers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is easily done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you\nare pleased to call ciphers, are no other than the Greek characters, in\nwhich, for my amusement, I keep a diary of everything remarkable that\nhas occurred to my observation since the beginning of the voyage, till\nthe day in which I was put in irons; and the same method was practised\nby Mr. Thompson, who copied mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cA very likely story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nMackshane; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat occasion was there for using Greek characters, if you\nwere not afraid of discovering what you had wrote? But what d'ye talk of\nGreek characters? D'ye think I am so ignorant of the Greek language, as\nnot to distinguish its letters from these, which are no more Greek than\nChinese? No, no, I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for\nyou, nor none that ever came from your country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, with an\nunparalleled effrontery, he repeated some gibberish, which by the sound\nseemed to be Irish, and made it pass for Greek with the captain, who,\nlooking at me with a contemptuous sneer, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, ah! have you\ncaught a tartar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could not help smiling at the consummate assurance\nof this Hibernian, and offered to refer the dispute to anybody on board\nwho understood the Greek alphabet. Upon which Morgan was brought back,\nand, being made acquainted with the affair, took the book, and read a\nwhole page in English, without hesitation, deciding the controversy in\nmy favour. The doctor was so far from being out of countenance at this\ndetection, that he affirmed Morgan was in the secret, and repeated from\nhis own invention. Oakum said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, I see they are both in a story;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and dismissed my fellow-mate to his cockloft, although I proposed that\nhe and I should read and translate, separately, any chapter or verse in\nthe Greek Testament in his possession, by which it would appear whether\nwe or the surgeon spoke truth. Not being endued with eloquence enough\nto convince the captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy\nin this expedient, I begged to be examined by some unconcerned person\non board, who understood Greek. Accordingly, the whole ship's company,\nofficers and all, were called upon deck, among whom it was proclaimed\nthat, if anyone of them could speak Greek, he or they so qualified\nshould ascend the quarter-deck immediately. After some pause, two\nforemast men came up, and professed their skill in that language, which,\nthey said, they acquired during several voyages to the Levant, among the\nGreeks of the Morea. The captain exulted much in this declaration, and\nput my journal book into the hands of one of them, who candidly owned he\ncould neither read nor write; the other acknowledged the same degree of\nignorance, but pretended to speak the Greek lingo with any man on board;\nand, addressing himself to me, pronounced some sentences of a barbarous\ncorrupted language, which I did not understand. I asserted that the\nmodern Greek was as different from that spoken and written by the\nancients, as the English used now from the old Saxon spoke in the time\nof Hengist: and, as I had only learned the true original tongue, in\nwhich Homer, Pindar, the Evangelists, and other great men of antiquity\nwrote, it could not be supposed that I should know anything of an\nimperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of the former, and\nscarce retained any traces of the old expression: but, if Doctor\nMackshane, who pretended to be master of the Greek language, could\nmaintain a conversation with these seamen, I would retract what I had\nsaid, and be content to suffer any punishment be should think proper to\ninflict. I had no sooner uttered these words than the surgeon, knowing\none of the fellows to be his countryman, accosted him in Irish, and was\nanswered in the same brogue; then a dialogue ensued between them, which\nthey affirmed to be in Greek, after having secured the secrecy of\nthe other tar, who had his cue in the language of the Morea, from\nhis companion, before they would venture to assert such an intrepid\nfalsehood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Oakum, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe should discover the imposture at\nlast. Let the rascal be carried back to his confinement. I find he must\ndangle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf, before a court\nso prejudiced with spite, and fortified with ignorance against truth, I\nsuffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my fellow-prisoner, who,\nhearing the particulars of my trial, lifted up his hands and eyes to\nHeaven, and uttered a dreadful groan: and, not daring to disburden his\nthoughts to me by speech, lest he might be overheard by the sentinel,\nburst forth into a Welsh song, which he accompanied with a thousand\ncontortions of face and violent gestures of body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nI discover a subornation against me, by means of a quarrel between\ntwo of the evidences; in consequence of which I am set at liberty,\nand prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the same\nterms--Mackshane's malice--we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a\nshort time we beat up to Hispaniola, in conjunction with the West\nIndia squadron--we take in water, sail again, and arrive at\nCarthagena--Reflections on our conduct there\n\nMeanwhile, a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks, the one,\nto be revenged of the other, came and discovered to us the mystery\nof Mackshane's dialogue, as I have explained it above. This detection\ncoming to the ears of the doctor, who was sensible that (now we were in\nsight of Jamaica) we should have an opportunity of clearing ourselves\nbefore a court-martial, and, at the same time, of making his malice\nand ignorance conspicuous, he interceded for us with the captain so\neffectually, that in a few hours we were set at liberty, and ordered to\nreturn to our duty. This was a happy event for me, my whole body being\nblistered by the sun, and my limbs benumbed by want of motion: but I\ncould scarce persuade the Welshman to accept of this indulgence, he\npersisted in his obstinacy to remain in irons, until he should be\ndischarged by a court-martial, which, he believed would also do him\njustice on his enemies. At length I represented to him the precarious\nissue of a trial, the power and interest of his adversaries, and\nflattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his resentment with his\nown hands upon Mackshane after our return to England. This last argument\nhad more weight with him than all the rest, and prevailed upon him to\nrepair with me to the cockpit, which I no sooner entered, than the idea\nof my departed friend presented itself to my remembrance, and filled my\neyes with tears. We discharged from our mess the boy who had acted so\nperfidiously, notwithstanding his tears, intreaties, and of penitence\nfor what he had done; but not before he had confessed that the surgeon\nhad bribed him to give evidence against us, with a pair of stockings and\na couple of old check shirts, of which his servant had since plundered\nhim.\n\nThe keys of our chests and lockers being sent to us by the doctor,\nwe detained the messenger until we had examined the contents; and my\nfellow-mate, finding all his Cheshire cheese consumed to a crust, his\nbrandy exhausted, and his onions gone, was seized with a fit of choler,\nwhich he discharged on Mackshane's man in oaths and execrations,\nthreatening to prosecute him as a thief. The fellow swore in his turn,\nthat he never had the keys in his possession till that time, when he\nreceived them from his master with orders to deliver them to us. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Cot\nis my judge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Morgan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand my salfation, and my witness; whosoever\nhas pilfered my provisions is a lousy, peggarly, rascally knave! and by\nthe soul of my grandsire, I will impeach, and accuse, and indict him, of\na roppery, if I did but know who he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Had this misfortune happened\nat sea, where we could not repair the loss, in all probability this\ndescendant of Caractacus would have lost his wits entirely; but, when I\nobserved how easy it would be to remedy this paltry mischance, he became\nmore calm, and reconciled himself to the occasion.\n\nA little while after this transport the surgeon came into the birth,\nunder pretence of taking something out of the medicine chest, and, with\na smiling aspect, wished us joy of our deliverance, which, he said, he\nhad been at great pains to obtain of the captain, who was very justly\nincensed at our behaviour; but he, the doctor, had passed his word for\nour future conduct, and he hoped we should give him no cause to repent\nof his kindness. He expected, no doubt, an acknowledgment from us for\nthis pretended piece of service, as well as a general amnesty of what\nwas past; but he had to do with people who were not quite so apt to\nforgive injuries as he imagined, or to forget that, if our deliverance\nwas owing to his mediation, our calamity was occasioned by his malice;\nI therefore sat silent, while my companion answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, 'tis no\nmatter, Cot knows the heart; there is a time for all things, as the wise\nman saith; there is a time for throwing away stones, and to gather them\nup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He seemed to be disconcerted at this reply, and went away in a pet,\nmuttering something about \u00e2\u0080\u009cIngratitude,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d of which we did\nnot think fit to take any notice.\n\nOur fleet, having joined another that waited for us, lay at anchor\nabout a month in the harbour of Port Royal in Jamaica, during which time\nsomething of consequence was certainly transacted; notwithstanding the\ninsinuations of some, who affirmed we had no business at all in that\nplace; that, in order to take the advantage of the season proper for our\nenterprise, the West India squadron, which had previous notice of our\ncoming, ought to have joined us at the west end of Hispaniola, with\nnecessary stores and refreshments, from whence we could have sailed\ndirectly for Carthagena, before the enemy could put themselves in a good\nposture of defence, or, indeed, have an inkling of our design. Be this\nas it will, we sailed from Jamaica, and, in ten days or a fortnight,\nbeat up against the wind as far as the Isle of Vache, with an intention,\nas was said, to attack the French fleet, then supposed to be lying near\nthat place; but before we arrived, they had sailed for Europe, having\nfirst dispatched an advice-boat to Carthagena, with an account of\nour being in those seas, as also of our strength and destination. We\nloitered here some days longer, taking in wood and brackish water, in\nthe use whereof, however, our admiral seemed to consult the health of\nthe men, by restricting each to a quart a day.\n\nAt length we set sail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of\nCarthagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at our ease ten days\nlonger. Here, again, certain malicious people took occasion to blame the\nconduct of their superiors, by saying, that in so doing they not only\nunprofitably wasted time, which was very precious, considering the\napproach of the rainy season, but also allowed the Spaniards to\nrecollect themselves from a terror occasioned by the approach of an\nEnglish fleet, at least three times as numerous as ever appeared in that\npart of the world before. But if I might be allowed to give my opinion\nof the matter, I would ascribe this delay to the generosity of our\nchiefs, who scorned to take any advantage that fortune might give them\neven over an enemy. At last, however, we weighed, and anchored again\nsomewhat nearer the harbour's mouth, where we made shift to land our\nmarines, who encamped on the beach, in despite of the enemy's shot,\nwhich knocked a good many of them on the head. This piece of conduct,\nin choosing a camp under the walls of an enemy's fortification, which I\nbelieve never happened before, was practised, I presume, with a view of\naccustoming the soldiers to stand fire, who were not as yet much used\nto discipline, most of them having been taken from the plough-tail a few\nmonths before. This expedient, again, has furnished matter for censure\nagainst the ministry, for sending a few raw recruits on such an\nimportant enterprise, while so many veteran regiments lay inactive at\nhome. But surely our governors had their reasons for so doing, which\npossibly may be disclosed with other secrets of the deep. Perhaps they\nwere loth to risk their best troops on such desperate service, or\nthe colonel and the field officers of the old corps, who, generally\nspeaking, enjoyed their commissions as sinecures or pensions, for some\ndomestic services rendered to the court, refused to embark in such a\ndangerous and precarious undertaking; for which refusal, no doubt, they\nare to be much commended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nOur Land Forces being disembarked, erect a fascine battery-our ship is\nordered, with four more, to batter the port of Bocca Chica--Mackshane's\ncowardice-the Chaplain's frenzy--honest Rattlin loses one hand--his\nheroism and reflections on the battle--Crampley's behaviour to me during\nthe heat of the Fight\n\nOur forces being landed and stationed as I have already mentioned, set\nabout erecting a fascine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the\nenemy; and in something more than three weeks, it was ready to open.\nThat we might do the Spaniards as much honour as possible, it was\ndetermined, in a council of war, that five of our largest ships should\nattack the fort on one side, while the battery, strengthened by two\nmortars and twenty-four cohorns, should ply it on the other.\n\nAccordingly, the signal for our ship to engage, among others, was\nhoisted, we being advertised, the night before, to make everything\nclear for that purpose; and, in so doing, a difference happened between\nCaptain Oakum and his well-beloved cousin and counsellor Mackshane,\nwhich had well nigh terminated in an open rupture. The doctor, who had\nimagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemy's shot in\nthe cockpit than in the centre of the earth, was lately informed that a\nsurgeon's mate had been killed in that part of the ship by a cannon-ball\nfrom two small redoubts that were destroyed before the disembarkation of\nour soldiers; and therefore insisted upon having a platform raised for\nthe convenience of the sick and wounded in the after-hold, where he\ndeemed himself more secure than on the deck above. The captain, offended\nat this extraordinary proposal, accused him of pusillanimity, and told\nhim, there was no room in the hold for such an occasion: or, if there\nwas, he could not expect to be indulged more than the rest of the\nsurgeons of the navy, who used the cockpit for that purpose. Fear\nrendering Mackshane obstinate, he persisted in his demand, and showed\nhis instructions, by which it was authorised; the captain swore these\ninstructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were\nnever at sea; nevertheless he was obliged to comply, and sent for the\ncarpenter to give him orders about it. But, before any such measure\ncould be taken, our signal was thrown out, and the doctor compelled\nto trust his carcass in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were busy in\nputting our instruments and dressings in order.\n\nOur ship, with others destined for this service, immediately weighed,\nand in less than half-an-hour came to an anchor before the castle of\nBocca Chica, with a spring upon our cable, and the cannonading (which\nindeed was dreadful) began. The surgeon, after having crossed himself,\nfell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and purser, who were stationed\nwith us in quality of assistants, followed his example, while the\nWelshman and I sat upon a chest looking at one another with great\ndiscomposure, scarce able to refrain from the like prostration. And that\nthe reader may know it was not a common occasion that alarmed us thus, I\nmust inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that astonished\nus. The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from eighty-four great guns,\nbesides a mortar and small arms, in Bocca Chica; thirty-six in Fort St.\nJoseph; twenty in two fascine batteries, and four men-of-war, mounting\nsixty-four guns each. This was answered by our land-battery mounted with\ntwenty-one cannon, two mortars, and twenty-four cohorns, and five great\nships of seventy or eighty guns, that fired without intermission.\n\nWe had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the sailors brought\nanother on his back to the cockpit, where he tossed him down like a bag\nof oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his\nmouth without speaking a word. Morgan immediately examined the condition\nof the wounded man, and cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I shall answer now, the man is as\ndead as my great grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his comrade; \u00e2\u0080\u009che may be dead\nnow, for aught I know, but I'll be d--d if he was not alive when I took\nhim up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he was about to return to his quarters, when I bade\nhim carry the body along with him, and throw it overboard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n the\nbody!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think 'tis fair enough if I take care of my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d My\nfellow mate, snatching up the amputation knife, pursued him half-way up\nthe cock-pit ladder, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lousy rascal, is this the churchyard,\nor the charnel-house, or the sepulchre, or the golgotha, of the\nship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--but was stopped in his career by one calling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYo he, avast\nthere--scaldings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cScaldings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Morgan; \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot knows 'tis hot\nenough indeed: who are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the voice; and I\nimmediately knew it to be that of my honest friend Jack Rattlin, who\ncoming towards me, told me, with great deliberation, he was come to be\ndocked at last, and discovered the remains of one hand, which had been\nshattered to pieces with a grape shot. I lamented with unfeigned sorrow\nhis misfortune, which he bore with heroic courage, observing, that every\nshot had its commission: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was well it did not take him in the head!\nor if it had, what then? he should have died bravely, fighting for his\nking and country. Death was a debt which every man owed, and must\npay; and that now was as well as another time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was much pleased\nand edified with the maxims of this sea-philosopher, who endured the\namputation of his left hand without shrinking, the operation being\nperformed (at his request) by me, after Mackshane, who was with\ndifficulty prevailed to lift his head from the deck, had declared there\nwas a necessity for his losing the limb.\n\nWhile I was employed in dressing the stump, I asked Jack's opinion\nof the battle, who, shaking his head, frankly told me, he believed we\nshould do no good: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor why? because, instead of dropping anchor close\nunder shore, where we should have to deal with one corner of Bocca Chica\nonly, we had opened the harbour, and exposed ourselves to the whole fire\nof the enemy from their shipping and Fort St. Joseph, as well as from\nthe castle we intended to cannonade; that, besides, we lay at too great\na distance to damage the walls, and three parts in four of our shot did\nnot take place; for there was scarce anybody on board who understood\nthe pointing of a gun. Ah! God help us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your kinsman,\nLieutenant Bowling, had been here, we should have had other guess work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n By this time, our patients had increased to such a number, that we\ndid not know which to begin with; and the first mate plainly told the\nsurgeon, that if he did not get up immediately and perform his duty, he\nwould complain of his behaviour to the admiral, and make application\nfor his warrant. This remonstrance effectually roused Mackshane, who\nwas never deaf to an argument in which he thought his interest was\nconcerned; he therefore rose up, and in order to strengthen his\nresolution, had recourse more than once to a case-bottle of rum, which\nhe freely communicated to the chaplain, and purser, who had as much need\nof such extraordinary inspiration as himself. Being thus supported, he\nwent to work, and arms and legs were hewed down without mercy. The fumes\nof the liquor mounting into the parson's brain, conspired, with his\nformer agitation of spirits, to make him quite delirious; he stripped\nhimself to the skin; and, besmearing his body with blood, could scarce\nbe withheld from running upon deck in that condition. Jack Rattlin,\nscandalised at this deportment, endeavoured to allay his transports\nwith reason; but finding all he said ineffectual, and great confusion\noccasioned by his frolics, he knocked him down with his right hand, and\nby threats kept him quiet in that state of humiliation. But it was not\nin the power of rum to elevate the purser, who sat on the floor\nwringing his hands, and cursing the hour in which he left his peaceable\nprofession of a brewer in Rochester, to engage in such a life of terror\nand disquiet.\n\nWhile we diverted ourselves at the expense of this poor devil, a shot\nhappened to take us between wind and water, and (its course being\nthrough the purser's store room) made a terrible havoc and noise among\nthe jars and bottles in its way, and disconcerted Mackshane so much,\nthat he dropped his scalpel, and falling down on his knees, pronounced\nhis Pater-noster aloud: the purser fell backward, and lay without sense\nor motion; and the chaplain grew so outrageous, that Rattlin with one\nhand could not keep him under; so that we were obliged to confine him\nin the surgeon's cabin, where he was no doubt guilty of a thousand\nextravagancies. Much about this time, my old antagonist, Crampley,\ncame down, with express orders, as he said, to bring me up to the\nquarter-deck, to dress a slight wound the captain had received by a\nsplinter: his reason for honouring me in particular with this piece of\nservice, being, that in case I should be killed or disabled by the\nway, my death or mutilation would be of less consequence to the ship's\ncompany than that of the doctor or his first mate. At another time,\nperhaps, I might have disputed this order, to which I was not bound to\npay the least regard; but as I thought my reputation depended upon\nmy compliance, I was resolved to convince my rival that I was no more\nafraid than he of exposing myself to danger. With this view I provided\nmyself with dressings, and followed him immediately to the quarter-deck,\nthrough a most infernal scene of slaughter, fire, smoke, and uproar.\nCaptain Oakum, who leaned against the mizen-mast, no sooner saw me\napproach in my shirt, with the sleeves tucked up to my armpits, and my\nhands dyed with blood, than he signified his displeasure by a frown, and\nasked why the doctor himself did not come? I told him that Crampley\nhad singled me out, as if by express command; at which reply he seemed\nsurprised, and threatened to punish the midshipman for his presumption,\nafter the engagement. In the meantime, I was sent back to my\nstation, and ordered to tell Mackshane, that the captain expected him\nimmediately. I got safe back, and delivered my commission to the doctor,\nwho flatly refused to quit the post assigned to him by his instructions;\nwhereupon Morgan, who I believe, was jealous of my reputation for\ncourage, undertook the affair, and ascended with great intrepidity. The\ncaptain, finding the surgeon obstinate, suffered himself to be dressed,\nand swore he would confine Mackshane as soon as the service should be\nover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nA breach being made in the walls, our soldiers give the assault, and\ntake the place without opposition--our sailors at the same time, become\nmasters of all the other strengths near Bocca Chica, and take possession\nof the harbour--the good consequence of this success--we move nearer\nthe town--find two forts deserted, and the Channel blocked up with sunk\nvessels; which however we find means to clear--land our soldiers at La\nQuinta--repulse a body of militia--attack the castle of St. Lazar,\nand are forced to retreat with great loss--the remains of our army are\nre-embarked--an effort of the Admiral to take the town--the economy of\nour expedition described\n\nHaving cannonaded the fort during the space of four hours, we were all\nordered to slip our cables, and sheer off; but next day the engagement\nwas renewed, and continued from the morning till the afternoon, when the\nenemy's fire from Bocca Chica slackened, and towards evening was quite\nsilenced. A breach being made on the other side, by our land battery,\nlarge enough to admit a middle-sized baboon, provided he could find\nmeans to climb up to it, our general proposed to give the assault that\nvery night, and actually ordered a detachment on that duty. Providence\nstood our friend upon this occasion, and put it into the hearts of\nthe Spaniards to abandon the fort, which might have been maintained by\nresolute men till the day of judgment against all the force we could\nexert in the attack. And while our soldiers took possession of the\nenemy's ramparts without resistance, the same good luck attended a body\nof sailors, who made themselves masters of Fort St. Joseph, the fascine\nbatteries, and one Spanish man-of-war; the other three being burnt or\nsunk by the foe, that they might not fall into our hands. The taking of\nthese forts, in the strength of which the Spaniards chiefly confided,\nmade us masters of the outward harbour, and occasioned great joy among\nus, as we laid our accounts at finding little or no opposition from the\ntown: and indeed, if a few great ships had sailed up immediately, before\nthey had recovered from the confusion and despair that our unexpected\nsuccess had produced among them, it is not impossible that we might have\nfinished the affair to our satisfaction, without any more bloodshed; but\nthis step our heroes disdained as a barbarous insult over the enemy's\ndistress, and gave them all the respite they could desire, in order to\nrecollect themselves. In the meantime, Mackshane, taking the advantage\nof this general exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded his own\ncause so effectually that he was re-established in his good graces; and\nas for Crampley, there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards\nme during the action. But of all the consequences of the victory, none\nwas more grateful than plenty of fresh water, after we had languished\nfive weeks on the allowance of a purser's quart per day for each man in\nthe Torrid Zone, where the sun was vertical, and the expense of bodily\nfluid so great, that a gallon of liquor could scarce supply the waste of\ntwenty-four hours; especially as our provision consisted of putrid salt\nbeef, to which the sailors gave the name of Irish horse; salt pork, of\nNew England, which, though neither fish nor flesh, savoured of both;\nbread from the same country, every biscuit whereof, like a piece of\nclockwork, moved by its own internal impulse, occasioned by the myriads\nof insects that dwelt within it; and butter served out by the gill, that\ntasted like train oil thickened with salt. Instead of small beer,\neach man was allowed three half-quarterns of brandy or rum, which were\ndistributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of his water,\nwithout either sugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which reason,\nthis composition was by the sailors not ineptly styled Necessity. Nor\nwas this limitation of simple element owing to a scarcity of it on\nboard, for there was at this time water enough in the ship for a voyage\nof six months, at the rate of half-a-gallon per day to each man: but\nthis fast must, I suppose, have been enjoined by way of penance on the\nship's company for their sins; or rather with a view to mortify them\ninto a contempt of life, that they might thereby become more resolute\nand regardless of danger. How simply then do those people argue, who\nascribe the great mortality among us, to our bad provision and want\nof water; and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might have been\nsaved, if the useless transports had been employed in fetching fresh\nstock, turtle, fruit, and other refreshments from Jamaica and other\nadjacent islands, for the use of the army and fleet! seeing it is to\nbe hoped, that those who died went to a better place, and those who\nsurvived were the more easily maintained. After all, a sufficient number\nremained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like\ntheir own country mastiffs, which shut their eyes, run into the jaws of\na bear, and have their heads crushed for their valour.\n\nBut to return to my narration. After having put garrisons into the forts\nwe had taken, and re-embarked our soldiers and artillery (a piece of\nservice that detained us more than a week), we ventured up to the mouth\nof the inner harbour, guarded by a large fortification on one side, and\na small redoubt on the other, both of which were deserted before our\napproach, and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by several old\ngalleons, and two men-of-war that the enemy had sunk in the channel. We\nmade shift, however, to open a passage for some ships, that favoured a\nsecond landing of our troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from\nthe town, where, after a faint resistance from a body of Spaniards, who\nopposed their disembarkation, they encamped with a design of besieging\nthe castle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and commanded the city.\nWhether our renowned general had nobody in his army who knew how to\napproach it in form, or that he trusted entirely to the fame of his\narms, I shall not determine; but, certain it is, a resolution was taken\nin a council of war, to attack the place with musketry only. This was\nput in execution, and succeeded accordingly; the enemy giving them such\na hearty reception, that the greatest part of their detachment took up\ntheir everlasting residence on the spot.\n\nOur chief, not relishing this kind of complaisance in the Spaniard's,\nwas wise enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army, which,\nfrom eight thousand able men landed on the beach near Bocca Chica, was\nnow reduced to fifteen hundred fit for service. The sick and wounded\nwere squeezed into certain vessels, which thence obtained the name of\nhospital ships, though methinks they scarce deserved such a creditable\ntitle, seeing few of them could boast of their surgeon, nurse, or cook;\nand the space between decks was so confined that the miserable patients\nhad not room to sit upright in their beds. Their wounds and stumps,\nbeing neglected, contracted filth and putrefaction, and millions of\nmaggots were hatched amidst the corruption of their sores. This inhuman\ndisregard was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons; though it is well\nknown that every great ship in the fleet could have spared one at least\nfor this duty, an expedient which would have been more than sufficient\nto remove this shocking inconvenience. But perhaps our general was too\nmuch of a gentleman to ask a favour of this kind from his fellow chief,\nwho, on the other hand, would not derogate so much from his own dignity,\nas to offer such assistance unasked; for, I may venture to affirm, that\nby this time the Demon of Discord, with her sooty wings, had breathed\nher influence upon our councils; and it might be said of these great men\n(I hope they will pardon the comparison) as of Cesar and Pompey, the one\ncould not brook a superior, and the other was impatient of an equal; so\nthat, between the pride of one and insolence of another, the enterprise\nmiscarried, according to the proverb, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween two stools the backside\nfalls to the ground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not that I would be thought to liken any public\nconcern to that opprobrious part of the human body, though I might with\ntruth assert, if I durst use such a vulgar idiom, that the nation did\nhang on arse at its disappointment on this occasion; neither would I\npresume to compare the capacity of our heroic leaders to any such wooden\nconvenience as a joint-stool or a close-stool; but only to signify by\nthis simile, the mistake the people committed in trusting to the union\nof two instruments that were never joined.\n\nA day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the admiral ordered one of\nthe Spanish men-of-war we had taken to be mounted with sixteen guns,\nand manned with detachments from our great ships, in order to batter the\ntown; accordingly, she was towed into the inner harbour in the night,\nand moored within half a mile of the walls, against which she began\nto fire at daybreak; and continued about six hours exposed to the\nopposition of at least thirty pieces of cannon, which at length obliged\nour men to set her on fire, and get off as well as they could in their\nboats. This piece of conduct afforded matter of speculation to all the\nwits, either in the army or navy, who were at last fain to acknowledge\nit a stroke of policy above their comprehension. Some entertained such\nan irreverent opinion of the admiral's understanding, as to think he\nexpected the town would surrender to his floating battery of sixteen\nguns: others imagined his sole intention was to try the enemy's\nstrength, by which he should be able to compute the number of great\nships that would be necessary to force the town to a capitulation. But\nthis last conjecture soon appeared groundless, inasmuch as no ships of\nany kind whatever were afterwards employed on that service. A third sort\nswore, that no other cause could be assigned for this undertaking than\nthat which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill. A fourth class\n(and that the most numerous, though, without doubt, composed of the\nsanguine and malicious), plainly taxed this commander with want of\nhonesty as well as sense; and alleged that he ought to have sacrificed\nprivate pique to the interest of his country; that, where the lives of\nso many brave fellow-citizens were concerned, he ought to have concurred\nwith the general without being solicited or even desired, towards their\npreservation and advantage, that, if his arguments could not dissuade\nhim from a desperate enterprise, it was his duty to have rendered it as\npracticable as possible, without running extreme hazard; that this could\nhave been done, with a good prospect of success, by ordering five or\nsix large ships to batter the town, while the land forces stormed the\ncastle; by these means a considerable diversion would have been made in\nfavour of those troops, who, in their march to the assault and in the\nretreat, suffered much more from the town than from the castle! that the\ninhabitants, seeing themselves vigorously attacked on all hands, would\nhave been divided, distracted, and confused, and in all probability,\nunable to resist the assailants. But all these suggestions surely\nproceeded from ignorance or malevolence, or else the admiral would not\nhave found it such an easy matter, at his return to England, to justify\nhis conduct to a ministry at once so upright and discerning. True it is,\nthat those who undertook to vindicate him on the spot, asserted, that\nthere was not water enough for our great ships near the town: though\nthis was a little unfortunately urged, because there happened to be\npilots in the fleet perfectly well acquainted with the soundings of the\nharbour, who affirmed there was water enough for five eighty-gun ships\nto lie abreast almost up to the very walls. The disappointments\nwe suffered occasioned a universal dejection, which was not at all\nalleviated by the objects that daily and hourly entertained our eyes,\nnor by the prospect of what must have inevitably happened, had we\nremained much longer in this place. Such was the economy in some\nships that, rather than be at the trouble of interring the dead, their\ncommanders ordered their men to throw their bodies overboard, many\nwithout either ballast or winding-sheet; so that numbers of human\ncarcases floated in the harbour, until they were devoured by sharks\nand carrion crows, which afforded no agreeable spectacle to those who\nsurvived. At the same time the wet season began, during which a deluge\nof rain falls, from the rising to the setting sun, without intermission,\nand that no sooner ceases than it begins to thunder, and lighten with\nsuch continued flashing, that one can see to read a very small print by\nthe illumination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nAn epidemic Fever rages among us--we abandon our Conquests--I am seized\nwith Distemper--write a Petition to the Captain, which is rejected--I am\nin danger of Suffocation through the Malice of Crampley, and relieved\nby a Serjeant--my Fever increases--the Chaplain wants to confess\nme--I obtain a favourable Crisis-Morgan's Affection for me proved--the\nBehaviour of Mackshane and Crampley towards me--Captain Oakum is removed\ninto another Ship with his beloved Doctor--our new Captain described--An\nAdventure of Morgan\n\nThe change of the atmosphere, occasioned by this phenomenon, conspired,\nwith the stench that surrounded us, the heat of the climate, our own\nconstitutions, impoverished by bad provisions, and our despair, to\nintroduce the bilious fever among us, which raged with such violence,\nthat three-fourths of those whom it invaded died in a deplorable manner;\nthe colour of their skin being, by the extreme putrefaction of the\njuices, changed into that of soot.\n\nOur conductors, finding things in this situation, perceived it was high\nto relinquish our conquests, and this we did, after having rendered\ntheir artillery useless, and blown up their walls with gunpowder. Just\nas we sailed from Bocca Chica, on our return to Jamaica, I found myself\nthreatened with the symptoms of this terrible distemper; and knowing\nvery well that I stood no chance for my life, if I should be obliged\nto be in the cockpit, which by this time was grown intolerable, even to\npeople in health, by reason of the heat and unwholesome smell of decayed\nprovision, I wrote a petition to the captain, representing my case, and\nhumbly imploring his permission to be among the soldiers in the middle\ndeck, for the benefit of the air: but I might have spared myself the\ntrouble; for this humane commander refused my request, and ordered me\nto continue in the place allotted for the surgeon's mates, or else be\ncontented to be in the hospital, which, by the by, was three degrees\nmore offensive and more suffocating than our own berth below. Another,\nin my condition, perhaps, would have submitted to his fate, and died\nin a pet; but I could not brook the thought of perishing so pitifully,\nafter I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune: I therefore,\nwithout minding Oakum's injunction, prevailed upon the soldiers (whose\ngood-will I had acquired) to admit my hammock among them; and actually\ncongratulated myself upon my comfortable situation; which Crampley no\nsooner understood, than he signified to the captain my contempt of his\norders, and was invested with power to turn me down again into my proper\nhabitation.\n\nThis barbarous piece of revenge incensed me so much against the author,\nthat I vowed, with bitter imprecations, to call him to a severe account,\nif ever it should be in my power; and the agitation of my spirits\nincreased my fever to a violent degree. While I lay gasping for breath\nin this infernal abode, I was visited by a sergeant, the bones of whose\nnose I had reduced and set to rights, after they had been demolished\nby a splinter during our last engagement; he, being informed of my\ncondition, offered me the use of his berth in the middle deck, which was\nenclosed with canvas, and well aired by a port-hole that remained\nopen within it. I embraced this proposal with joy, and was immediately\nconducted to the place, where I was treated, while my illness lasted,\nwith the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful halberdier, who had\nno other bed for himself than a hencoop during the whole passage. Here\nI lay and enjoyed the breeze, notwithstanding which my malady gained\nground, and at length my life was despaired of, though I never lost\nhopes of recovery, even when I had the mortification to see, from my\ncabin-window, six or seven thrown overboard every day, who died of the\nsame distemper. This confidence, I am persuaded, conduced a great\ndeal to the preservation of my life, especially when joined to another\nresolution I took at the beginning, namely, to refuse all medicine,\nwhich I could not help thinking co-operated with the disease, and,\ninstead of resisting putrefaction, promoted a total degeneracy of the\nvital fluid. When my friend Morgan, therefore, brought his diaphoretic\nbolases, I put them into my mouth, 'tis true, but without any intention\nof swallowing them: and, when he went away, spit them out, and washed\nmy mouth with water-gruel. I seemingly complied in this matter, that I\nmight not affront the blood of Caractacus, by a refusal which might\nhave intimated a diffidence of his physical capacity, for he acted as\nmy physician; Doctor Mackshane never once inquiring about me, or even\nknowing where I was. When my distemper was at the height, Morgan thought\nmy case desperate, and, after having applied a blister to the nape of my\nneck, squeezed my hand, bidding me, with a woful countenance, recommend\nmyself to Cot and my Reteemer; then, taking his leave, desired the\nchaplain to come and administer some spiritual consolation to me;\nbut, before he arrived, I made shift to rid myself of the troublesome\napplication the Welshman had bestowed on my back. The person, having\nfelt my pulse, inquired into the nature of my complaints, hemmed a\nlittle, and began thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Random, God out of his infinite mercy has\nbeen pleased to visit you with a dreadful distemper, the issue of which\nno man knows. You may be permitted to recover and live many days on the\nface of the earth; and, which is more probable, you may be taken\naway, and cut off in the flower of your youth. It is incumbent on you,\ntherefore, to prepare for the great change, by repenting sincerely of\nyour sins; of this there cannot be a greater sign, than an ingenuous\nconfession, which I conjure you to make without hesitation or mental\nreservation; and, when I am convinced of your sincerity, I will then\ngive you such comfort as the situation of your soul will admit of.\nWithout doubt, you have been guilty of numberless transgressions\nto which youth is subject, as swearing, drunkenness, whoredom, and\nadultery: tell me therefore, without reserve, the particulars of each,\nespecially of the last, that I may be acquainted with the true state of\nyour conscience; for no physician will prescribe for his patient until\nhe knows the circumstances of his disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs I was not under any apprehensions of death, I could not help smiling\nat the chaplain's inquisitive remonstrance, which I told him savoured\nmore of the Roman than of the Protestant church, in recommending\nauricular confession; a thing, in my opinion, not at all necessary\nto salvation, and which, for that reason, I declined. This reply\ndisconcerted him a little; however, he explained away his meaning, in\nmaking learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary\nand what was only convenient; then proceeded to ask what religion I\nprofessed. I answered, that I had not as yet considered the difference\nof religions, consequently had not fixed on any one in particular, but\nthat I was bred a Presbyterian. At this word the chaplain expressed\ngreat astonishment, and said, he could not comprehend how a presbyterian\nwas entitled to any post under the English government. Then he asked\nif I had ever received the sacrament, or taken the oaths; to which\nquestions, I replying in the negative, he held up his hands, assured\nme he could do me no service, wished I might not be in a state of\nreprobation, and returned to his messmates, who were making merry in the\nward-room, round a table well stored with bumbo(2) and wine.\n\n\n(2)bumbo is a liquor composed of rum, sugar, water, and nutmeg\n\nThis insinuation, terrible as it was, had not such an effect upon me as\nthe fever, which, soon after he had left me, grew outrageous. I began\nto see strange chimeras and concluded myself upon the point of being\ndelirious; in the meantime, being in great danger of suffocation, I\nstarted up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge myself\ninto the sea; and, as my friend the sergeant was not present, would\ncertainly have cooled myself to some purpose, had I not perceived a\nmoisture upon my thigh, as I endeavoured to get out of my hammock: the\nappearance of this revived my hopes, and I had reflection and resolution\nenough to take the advantage of this favourable symptom, by tearing the\nshirt from my body, and the sheets from my bed, and wrapping myself in a\nthick blanket, in which inclosure, for about a quarter of an hour, felt\nall the pains of hell: but it was not long before I was recompensed for\nmy suffering by a profuse sweat, that, bursting from the whole surface\nof my skin, in less than two hours, relieved me from all my complaints\nexcept that of weakness; and left me as hungry as a kite. I enjoyed\na very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling myself with the\nagreeable reverie of future happiness, when I heard Morgan, on the\noutside of the curtain, ask the sergeant if I was alive still? \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlive!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid he should be otherwise! he has lain quiet\nthese five hours, and I do not choose to disturb him, for sleep will do\nhim great service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my fellow-mate, \u00e2\u0080\u009che sleeps so sound (look\nyou), that he will not waken till the great trump plows--Cot be merciful\nto his soul. He has paid his debt like an honest man--ay, and moreover,\nhe is at rest from all persecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of\nwhich, Cot knows, and I know, he had his own share--Ochree! Ochree!\nhe was a promising youth indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying he groaned grievously,\nand began to whine in such a manner, as persuaded me he had a real\nfriendship for me. The sergeant, alarmed at his words, came into the\nberth, and, while he looked upon me, I smiled, and tipped him the wink:\nhe immediately guessed my meaning and remaining silent, Morgan was\nconfirmed in his opinion of my being dead; whereupon he approached, with\ntears in his eyes, in order to indulge his grief with a sight of\nthe object: and I counterfeited death so well, by fixing my eyes and\ndropping my under-jaw, that he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere he lies, no petter than a\nlump of clay, Cot help me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and observed, by the distortion of my face,\nthat I must have had a strong struggle.\n\nI should not have been able to contain myself much longer, when he began\nto perform the last duty of a friend, in closing my eyes and my mouth,\nupon which I suddenly snapped at his fingers and discomposed him so much\nthat he started back, turned pale as ashes, and stared like the picture\nof horror; although I could not help laughing at his appearance, I was\nconcerned for his situation, and stretched out my hand, telling him I\nhoped to live and eat some salmagundy of his making in England. It was\nsome time before he could recollect himself so far as to feel my pulse,\nand inquire into the particulars of my disease; but when he found I had\nenjoyed a favourable crisis, he congratulated me upon my good fortune;\nnot failing to ascribe it, under Cot, to the blister he had applied\nto my back, at his last visit; which, by the bye, said he, must now be\nremoved and dressed; he was actually going to fetch dressings, when I,\nfeigning astonishment, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBless me! sure you never applied a blister\nto me--there is nothing on my back, I assure you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he could not be\nconvinced till he had examined it, and then endeavoured to conceal his\nconfusion, by expressing his surprise in finding the skin untouched\nand the plaster missing. In order to excuse myself for paying so little\nregard to his prescription, I pretended to have been insensible when it\nwas put on, and to have pulled it off afterwards in a fit of delirium.\nThis apology satisfied my friend, who, on this occasion, abated a good\ndeal of his stiffness in regard to punctilio; and as we were now safely\narrived at Jamaica, where I had the benefit of fresh provisions and\nother refreshments, I recovered strength every day, and, in a short\ntime, my health and vigour were perfectly re-established.\n\nWhen I got up at first, and was just able to crawl about the deck with\na staff in my hand, I met Doctor Mackshane, who passed by me with a\ndisdainful look, and did not vouchsafe to honour me with one word. After\nhim came Crampley, who, strutting up to me with a fierce countenance,\npronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's fine discipline on-board, when such lazy, skulking\nsons of bitches as you are allowed, on pretence of sickness, to lollop\nat your ease, while your betters are kept to hard duty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The sight and\nbehaviour of this malicious scoundrel enraged me so much that I could\nscarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his pate; but when I\nconsidered my present feebleness, and the enemies I had in the ship,\nwho wanted only a pretence to ruin me, I restrained my passion, and\ncontented myself with telling him, I had not forgot his insolence\nand malice, and that I hoped we should meet one day on shore. At this\ndeclaration he grinned, shook his fist, and swore he longed for nothing\nmore than such an opportunity. Meanwhile our ship was ordered to be\nheaved down, victualled, and watered, for her return to England; and our\ncaptain, for some reason or other, not thinking it convenient for him\nto revisit his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman,\nwho, on the other hand, wished for nothing so much as to be safe without\nthe tropic: all his care and tenderness of himself being insufficient to\npreserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun and weather.\n\nOur tyrant having left the ship, and carried his favourite Mackshane\nalong with him, to my inexpressible satisfaction, our new commander came\non board in a ten-oared barge, overshadowed with a vast umbrella, and\nappeared in everything the reverse of Oakum, being a tall, thin young\nman, dressed in this manner: a white hat, garnished with a red feather,\nadorned his head, from whence his hair flowed upon his shoulders,\nin ringlets tied behind with a ribbon. His coat, consisting of\npink-coloured silk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut retired\nbackward, as it were, to discover a white satin waistcoat embroidered\nwith gold, unbuttoned at the upper part to display a brooch set with\ngarnets, that glittered in the breast of his shirt, which was of the\nfinest cambric, edged with right Mechlin: the knees of his crimson\nvelvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet his silk stockings,\nwhich rose without spot or wrinkle on his meagre legs, from shoes of\nblue Meroquin, studded with diamond buckles that flamed forth rivals to\nthe sun! A steel-hilted sword, inlaid with gold, and decked with a knot\nof ribbon which fell down in a rich tassel, equipped his side; and an\namber-headed cane hung dangling from his wrist. But the most remarkable\nparts of his furniture were, a mask on his face, and white gloves on his\nhands, which did not seem to be put on with an intention to be pulled\noff occasionally, but were fixed with a curious ring on the little\nfinger of each hand.\n\nIn this garb, Captain Whiffle, for that was his name, took possession of\nthe ship, surrounded with a crowd of attendants, all of whom, in their\ndifferent degrees, seemed to be of their patron's disposition; and the\nair was so impregnated with perfumes, that one may venture to affirm the\nclimate of Arabia Felix was not half so sweet-scented. My fellow-mate,\nobserving no surgeon among his train, thought he had found an occasion\ntoo favourable for himself to be neglected; and, remembering the old\nproverb, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpare to speak, and spare to speed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resolved to solicit the\nnew captain's interest immediately, before any other surgeon could be\nappointed for the ship. With this view he repaired to the cabin in his\nordinary dress, consisting of a check shirt and trousers, a brown linen\nwaistcoat, and a nightcap of the same (neither of them very clean,)\nwhich, for his further misfortune, happened to smell strong of tobacco.\nEntering without any ceremony into this sacred place, he found Captain\nWhiffle reposing upon a couch, with a wrapper of fine chintz about his\nbody, and a muslin cap bordered with lace about his head; and after\nseveral low congees began in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I hope you will forgive,\nand excuse, and pardon, the presumption of one who has not the honour of\nbeing known to you, but who is, nevertheless a shentleman porn and pred,\nand moreover has had misfortunes, Cot help me, in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere he was interrupted by the captain, who, on seeing him, had started\nup with great amazement, at the novelty of the apparition; and, having\nrecollected himself, pronounced with a look and tone signifying disdain,\ncuriosity and surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cZauns! who art thou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am surgeon's first\nmate on board of this ship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Morgan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I most vehemently\ndesire and beseech you, with all submission, to be pleased to condescend\nand vouchsafe to inquire into my character, and my pehaviour, and my\ndeserts, which, under Cot, I hope, will entitle me to the vacancy of\nsurgeon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As he proceeded in his speech, he continued advancing towards\nthe captain, whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatic\nflavour that exhaled from him, than he cried with great emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven\npreserve me! I am suffocated! Fellow, fellow, away with thee! Curse\nthee, fellow! Get thee gone! I shall be stunk to death!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the noise of\nhis outcries, his servants ran into his apartment, and he accosted them\nthus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cVillains! cut-throats! traitors! I am betrayed! I am sacrificed!\nWill you not carry that monster away? or must I be stifled with the\nstench of him? oh, oh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these interjections he sank down upon his\nsettee in a fit: his valet-de-chambre plied him with a smelling-bottle,\none footman chafed his temples with Hungary water, another sprinkled the\nfloor with spirits of lavender, a third pushed Morgan out of the cabin;\nwho coming to the place where I was, sat down with a demure countenance\nand, according to his custom, when he received any indignity which he\ndurst not revenge, began to sing a Welsh ditty.\n\nI guessed he was under some agitation of spirits and desired to know\nthe cause; but, instead of answering me directly, he asked with great\nemotion, if I thought him a monster and a stinkard? \u00e2\u0080\u009cA monster and a\nstinkard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, with some surprise: \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid anybody call you so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCot\nis my judge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied be, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Fifle did call me both; ay, and all\nthe waters in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembrance. I do\naffirm and avouch, and maintain, with my soul, and my pody, and my\nplood, look you, that I have no smells apout me, but such as a Christian\nought to have, except the effluvia of tobacco, which is a cephalic,\nodoriferous, aromatic herb; and he is a son of a mountain goat who says\notherwise. As for my being a minister, let that be as it is: I am as Cot\nwas pleased to create me, which, peradventure, is more than I shall ever\naver of him who gave me that title; for I will proclaim it before the\nworld, that he is disguised, and transfigured, and transmogrified, with\naffectation and whimseys; and that he is more like a papoon than of the\nhuman race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nCaptain Whiffle sends for me--his situation described--his surgeon\narrives, prescribes for him, and puts him to bed--a bed is put up for\nMr. Simper contiguous to the state room, which, with other parts of the\ncaptains behaviour, gives the ship's company a very unfavourable idea of\ntheir commander--I am detained in the West Indies by the admiral, and go\non board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeon's mate, where\nI make myself known to the surgeon, who treats me very kindly--I go on\nshore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and, at my return on board,\nam surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed lieutenant of\nthe sloop--we sail on a cruise--take a prize in which I arrive at Port\nMorant under the command of my messmate, with whom I live in great\nharmony\n\nHe was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a\nmessage to clean myself, and go up to the great cabin: and with this\ncommand I instantly complied, sweetening myself with rosewater from the\nmedicine chest. When I entered the room, I was ordered to stand by the\ndoor, until Captain Whiffle had reconnoitered me at a distance with\na spy-glass. He, having consulted one sense in this manner, bade me\nadvance gradually, that his nose might have intelligence before it could\nbe much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and success,\nand he was pleased to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, this creature is tolerable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I found him\nlolling on his couch with a languishing air, his head supported by his\nvalet-de-chambre, who from time to time applied a smelling-bottle to his\nnose. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVergette,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in a squeaking tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdost think this wretch\n(meaning me) will do me no injury? May I venture to submit my arm to\nhim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPon my word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the valet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do tink dat dere be great\noccasion for your honour losing a small quantite of blodt; and the young\nman ave quelque chose of de bonne mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I must venture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, addressing himself to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHast thou\never blooded anybody but brutes? But I need not ask thee, for thou wilt\ntell me a most d--able lie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrutes, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered I, pulling down his\nglove, in order to feel his pulse, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never meddle with brutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nthe devil art thou about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdost thou intend to twist off my\nhand? Gad's curse! my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder! Heaven\nhave mercy upon me! must I perish under the hands of savages? What\nan unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon, Mr.\nSimper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly, and, with\nthe utmost care, and tenderness, tied up his arm with a fillet of silk.\nWhile I was feeling for the vein, he desired to know how much blood\nI intended to take from him, and, when I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot above twelve\nounces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d started up with a look full of horror, and bade me be gone,\nswearing I had a design upon his life. Vergette appeased him with\ndifficulty, and, opening a bureau, took out a pair of scales, in one of\nwhich was placed a small cup; and putting them into my hand, told me,\nthe captain never lost above an ounce and three drams at one time.\n\nWhile I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the\ncabin a young man gaily dressed, of a very delicate complexion with a\nkind of languid smile on his face: which seemed to have been rendered\nhabitual by a long course of affectation. The captain no sooner\nperceived him, than, rising hastily, he flew into his arms, crying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, my dear Simper, I am excessively disordered! I have been betrayed,\nfrighted, murdered, by the negligence of my servants, who suffered a\nbeast, a mule, a bear, to surprise me, and stink me into convulsions\nwith the fumes of tobacco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Simper, who by this time, I found, was\nobliged to act for the clearness of his complexion, assumed an air of\nsoftness and sympathy, and lamented with many tender expressions of\nsorrow, the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then,\nfeeling his patient's pulse on the outside of his glove, gave it as his\nopinion, that his disorder was entirely nervous, and that some drops of\ntincture of castor, and liquid laudanum, would be of more service to him\nthan bleeding, by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits, and\ncomposing the fermentation of his bile. I was therefore sent to prepare\nthis prescription, which was administered in a glass of sack posset,\nafter the captain had been put to bed, and orders sent to the officers\non the quarter-deck, to let nobody walk on that side under which he lay.\n\nWhile the captain enjoyed his repose the doctor watched over him, and\nindeed became so necessary, that a cabin was made for him contiguous to\nthe state room where Whiffle slept, that he might be at hand in case of\naccidents in the night. Next day, our commander being happily recovered,\ngave orders that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck without\na wig, sword, and ruffles; nor any midshipman, or other petty officer,\nbe seen with a check shirt or dirty linen. He also prohibited any person\nwhatever, except Simper and his own servants, from coming into the\ngreat cabin without first sending in to obtain leave. These singular\nregulations did not prepossess the ship's company in his favour: but,\non the contrary, gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his\ncharacter, and accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with his\nsurgeon not fit to be named.\n\nIn a few weeks, our ship being under sailing orders, I was in hope of\nrevisiting my native country, in a very short time, when the\nadmiral's surgeon came on board, and, sending for Morgan and me to\nthe quarter-deck, gave us to understand there was a great scarcity of\nsurgeons in the West Indies; that he was commanded to detain one mate\nout of every great ship that was bound for England; and desired us to\nagree between ourselves, before the next day at that hour, which of us\nshould stay behind. We were thunderstruck at this proposal, and stared\nat one another some time without speaking; at length the Welshman broke\nsilence, and offered to remain in the West Indies, provided the admiral\nwould give him a surgeon's warrant immediately; but he was told there\nwas no want of chief surgeons, and that he must be contented with the\nstation of mate, till he should be further provided for in due\ncourse. Whereupon Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the\ncommissioners of the navy had appointed him; and the other told him as\nplainly, that if we could not determine the affair by ourselves before\nto-morrow morning, he must cast lots, and abide by his chance.\n\nWhen I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in\nEngland, where I had not one friend to promote my interest, or favour\nmy advancement in the navy, and the same time reflected on the present\ndearth of surgeons in the West Indies, and the unhealthiness of the\nclimate, which every day almost reduced the number, I could not help\nthinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious by my\nstaying where I was, than by returning to Europe. I therefore resolved\nto comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw\ndice, told Morgan he needed not trouble himself, for I would voluntarily\nsubmit to the admiral's pleasure. This frank declaration was commended\nby the gentleman, who assured me, it should not fare the worse with me\nfor my resignation. Indeed he was as good as his word, and that very\nafternoon procured a warrant, appointing me surgeon's mate of the Lizard\nsloop-of-war, which put me on a footing with every first mate in the\nservice.\n\nMy ticket being made out, I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe\nthat lay alongside, and, having shook hands with my trusty friend the\nsergeant, and honest Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich Hospital,\nI took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had exchanged our\nsleeve buttons as remembrances of each other. Having presented my new\nwarrant to the captain of the Lizard, I inquired for the doctor, whom\nI no sooner saw than I recollected him to be one of those young fellows\nwith whom I had been committed to the round-house, during our frolic\nwith Jackson, as I have related before. He received me with a good deal\nof courtesy, and, when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance,\nexpressed great joy at seeing me again, and recommended me to an\nexceeding good mess, composed of the gunner and master's mate. As there\nwas not one sick person in the ship, I got leave to go ashore next day\nwith the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought my ticket at\nthe rate of forty per cent discount; and, having furnished myself with\nthe necessaries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and, to my\nsurprise, found my old antagonist Crampley walking upon deck. Though\nI did not fear his enmity, I was shocked at his appearance, and\ncommunicated my sentiments on that subject to Mr. Tomlins the surgeon,\nwho told me that Crampley, by dint of some friends about the admiral,\nhad procured a commission, constituting him lieutenant on board the\nLizard; and advised me, now he was my superior officer, to behave with\nsome respect towards him, or else he would find a thousand opportunities\nof using me ill. This advice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and\nresentment had rendered utterly incapable of the least submission to,\nor even of a reconciliation with, the wretch who had, on many occasions,\ntreated me so inhumanly: however, I resolved to have as little\nconnection as possible with him, and to ingratiate myself as much as I\ncould with the rest of the officers, whose friendship might be a bulwark\nto defend me from the attempts of his malice.\n\nIn less than a week we sailed on a cruise, and having weathered the east\nend of the island, had the good fortune to take a Spanish barcolongo,\nwith her prize, which was an English ship bound for Bristol, that sailed\nfrom Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy. All the prisoners who\nwere well, we put onshore on the north side of the island; the prizes\nwere manned with Englishmen, and the command of the barcolongo given to\nmy friend the master's mate, with orders to carry them into Port Morant,\nand there to remain until the Lizard's cruise should be ended, at which\ntime she would touch at the same place in her way to Port Royal. With\nhim I was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Englishmen,\nwho amounted to sixteen, and to take care of them on shore in a house\nthat was to be hired as an hospital. This destination gave me a\ngreat deal of pleasure, as I should, for some time, be freed from the\narrogance of Crampley, whose inveteracy against me had already broken\nout on two or three occasions since he was become a lieutenant.\nMy messmate, who very much resembled my uncle, both in figure and\ndisposition, treated me on board of the prize with the utmost civility\nand confidence: and, among other favours, made me a present of a\nsilver-hilted hanger, and a pair of pistols mounted with the same metal,\nwhich fell to his share in plundering the enemy. We arrived safely at\nMorant, and, going on shore, pitched upon an empty storehouse; which we\nhired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next\nday, with beds and other necessaries; and four of the ship's company\nappointed to attend them and obey me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nA strange adventure--in consequence of which I am extremely\nhappy--Crampley does me in offices with the Captain; but his malice is\ndefeated by the good-nature and friendship of the surgeon--we return\nto Port Royal--our Captain gets the command of a larger ship, and is\nsucceeded by an old man--Brayl is provided for--we receive orders to\nsail for England\n\nWhen my patients were all in a fair way, my companion and commander,\nwhose name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the house of a\nrich planter, with whom he was acquainted, where we were sumptuously\nentertained, and in the evening set out on our return to the ship. When\nwe had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind\nus, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went? His\nvoice, which was quite familiar to me, no sooner struck my ear, than in\nspite of all my resolution and reflection, my hair bristled up, and I\nwas seized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl misinterpreting,\nbade me be under no concern. I told him he was mistaken in the cause of\nmy disorder; and, addressing myself to the person on horseback said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncould have sworn by your voice, that you were a dear friend of mine, if\nI had not been certain of his death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this address, after some pause,\nhe replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are many voices as well as faces that resemble one\nanother; but, pray, what was your friend's name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I satisfied him in\nthat particular, and gave a short detail of the melancholy fate of\nThompson, not without many sighs and some tears. A silence ensued,\nwhich lasted some minutes, and then the conversation turned on different\nsubjects, till we arrived at a house on the road, where the horseman\nalighted, and begged with so much earnestness that we would go in and\ndrink a bowl of punch with him, that we could not resist. But, if I was\nalarmed at his voice, what must my amazement be, when I discovered\nby the light the very person of my lamented friend! Perceiving my\nconfusion, which was extreme, he clasped me in his arms, and bedewed my\nface with tears. It was some time ere I recovered the use of my reason,\noverpowered with this event, and longer still before I could speak. So\nthat all I was capable of was to return his embraces, and to mingle the\noverflowings of my joy with his; whilst honest Brayl, affected with the\nscene, wept as fast as either of us, and signified his participation\nof our happiness by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a\nmadman. At length, I retrieved the use of my tongue, and cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs\nit possible! you can be my friend Thompson? No certainly, alas! he was\ndrowned; and I am now under the deception of a dream!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was at\ngreat pains to convince me of his being the individual person whom\nI regretted, and bidding me sit down and compose myself, promised to\nexplain his sudden disappearance from the Thunder, and to account for\nhis being at present in the land of the living. This task he acquitted\nhimself of, after I had drunk a glass of punch, and recollected my\nspirits, by informing us, that with a determination to rid himself of\na miserable existence, he had gone in the night-time to the head, while\nthe ship was on her way, from whence he slipped down as softly as he\ncould, by the bows into the sea, where, after he was heartily ducked, he\nbegan to repent of his precipitation; and, as he could swim very well,\nkept himself above water, in hopes of being taken up by some of the\nships astern; that, in this situation, he hailed a large vessel, and\nbegged to be taken in, but was answered that she was a heavy sailer, and\ntherefore they did not choose to lose time by bringing to; however, they\nthrew an old chest overboard for his convenience, and told him, that\nsome of the ships astern would certainly save him; that no other vessel\ncame within sight or cry of him for the space of three hours, during\nwhich time he had the mortification to find himself in the middle of\nthe ocean alone, without other support or resting-place, but what a few\ncrazy boards afforded; till at last he discerned a small sloop steering\ntowards him, upon which he set up his throat, and had the good fortune\nto be heard and rescued from the dreary waste by their boat, which was\nhoisted out on purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was no sooner brought on board,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan I fainted, and,\nwhen I recovered my senses, found myself in bed, regaled with a most\nnoisome smell of onions and cheese, which made me think at first that\nI was in my own hammock, alongside of honest Morgan, and that all which\nhad passed was no more than a dream. Upon inquiry, I understood that I\nwas on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island, bound for Jamaica,\nwith a cargo of geese, pigs, onions, and cheese, and that the master's\nname was Robertson, by birth a North Briton, whom I knew at first sight\nto be an old school-fellow of mine. When I discovered myself to him, he\nwas transported with surprise and joy, and begged to know the occasion\nof my misfortune, which I did not think fit to disclose, because I\nknew his notions with regard to religion were very severe and confined;\ntherefore contented myself with telling him I fell overboard\nby accident; but made no scruple of explaining the nature of my\ndisagreeable station, and of acquainting him with my determined purpose\nnever to return to the Thunder man-of-war. Although he was not of my\nopinion in that particular, knowing that I must lose my clothes and what\npay was due to me, unless I went back to my duty; yet, when I described\nthe circumstances of the hellish life I led under the tyrannic sway\nof Oakum and Mackshane; and, among other grievances, hinted a\ndissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my shipmates, and\nthe want of the true presbyterian gospel doctrine; he changed his\nsentiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside\nall thought of rising in the navy; and, that he might show how much he\nhad my interest at heart, undertook to provide for me in some shape or\nother, before he should leave Jamaica. This promise he performed to my\nheart's desire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with\nwhom I have lived ever since in quality of surgeon and overseer to his\nplantations. He and his lady are now at Kingston, so that I am, for\nthe present, master of this house, to which, from my soul, I bid you\nwelcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the\nremaining part of the night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI needed not a second invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent\nand excellent officer, could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship;\nhowever, he supped with us, and, after having drank a cheerful glass,\nset out for the vessel, which was not above three miles from the place,\nescorted by a couple of stout negroes, whom Mr. Thompson ordered to\nconduct him. Never were two friends more happy in the conversation\nof each other than we, for the time it lasted. I related to him the\nparticulars of our attempt upon Carthagena, of which he had heard but an\nimperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little\nincident of his life since we parted. He assured me, it was with the\nutmost difficulty he could resist his inclination of coming down to Port\nRoyal, to see Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings since the\nday of our separation: but that he was restrained by the fear of being\ndetained as a deserter. He told me that, when he heard my voice in the\ndark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterwards:\nand, in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained\nfor the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his\ndescription, was a very amiable young lady, and did not disdain his\naddresses; that he was very much favoured by her parents; and did not\ndespair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once\nrender him independent of the world. I congratulated him on his good\nfortune, which he protested should never make him forget his friends;\nand, towards morning, we betook ourselves to rest.\n\nNext day he accompanied me to the ship, where Mr. Brayl entertained him\nat dinner, and we having spent the afternoon together, he took his leave\nof us in the evening, after he had forced upon me ten pistoles, as a\nsmall token of his affection. In short, while he stayed here, we saw\none another every day, and generally ate at the same table, which was\nplentifully supplied by him with all kinds of poultry, butcher's meat,\noranges, limes, lemons, pine-apples, Madeira wine, and excellent rum;\nso that this small interval of ten days was by far the most agreeable\nperiod of my life.\n\nAt length the Lizard arrived; and my patients being all fit for duty,\nthey and I were ordered on board of her, where I understood from Mr.\nTomlins that there was a shyness between the lieutenant and him on\nmy account; the rancorous villain having taken the opportunity of my\nabsence to fill the captain's ears with a thousand scandalous stories\nto my prejudice; among other things affirming, that I had been once\ntransported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man-of-war,\nI had been whipped for the same crime. The surgeon, on the other hand,\nhaving heard my whole story from my own mouth, defended me strenuously,\nand in the course of that good-natured office recounted all the\ninstances of Crampley's malice against me while I remained on board\nof that ship; which declaration, while it satisfied the captain of my\ninnocence, made the lieutenant as much my defender's enemy as mine. The\ninfernal behaviour of Crampley, with regard to me, added such fuel to\nhis former resentment, that, at certain times, I was quite beside myself\nwith the desire of revenge, and was even tempted to pistol him on the\nquarter-deck, though an infamous death must inevitably have been my\nreward. But the surgeon, who was my confidant, argued against such a\ndesperate action so effectually, that I stifled the flame which\nconsumed me for the present, and resolved to wait for a more convenient\nopportunity. In the meantime, that Mr. Tomlins might be the more\nconvinced of the wrongs I suffered by this fellow's slander, I begged he\nwould go and visit Mr. Thompson, whose wonderful escape I had made him\nacquainted with, and inquire of him into the particulars of my conduct,\nwhile he was my fellow-mate.\n\nThis request the surgeon complied with, more through curiosity to see\na person whose fate had been so extraordinary, than to confirm his good\nopinion of me, which he assured me was already firmly established. He\ntherefore set out for the dwelling-place of my friend, with a letter\nof introduction from me; and being received with all the civility and\nkindness I expected, returned to the ship, not only satisfied with my\ncharacter beyond the power of doubt or insinuation, but also charmed\nwith the affability and conversation of Thompson, who loaded him and\nme with presents of fresh stock, liquors, and fruit. As he would not\nventure to come and see us on board, lest Cramplay should know and\ndetain him; when the time of our departure approached, I obtained\nleave to go and bid him farewell. After we had vowed an everlasting\nfriendship, he pressed upon me a purse, with four doubloons, which I\nrefused as long as I could without giving umbrage; and, having cordially\nembraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a small box,\nwith a letter directed for me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins. Knowing the\nsuperscription to be of Thompson's handwriting, I opened it with some\nsurprise, and learned that this generous friend, not content with\nloading me with the presents already mentioned, had sent, for my use and\nacceptance, half a dozen fine shirts, and as many linen waistcoats and\ncaps, with twelve pair of new thread stockings. Being thus provided with\nmoney and all necessaries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon\nmyself as a gentleman of some consequence, and felt my pride dilate a\npace.\n\nNext day we sailed for Port Royal, where we arrived safely with our\nprizes; and, as there was nothing to do on board, I went ashore, and\nhaving purchased a laced waistcoat, with some other clothes, at a\nsale, made a swaggering figure for some days among the taverns, where I\nventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty pistoles in\nmy pocket. Meanwhile our captain was promoted to a ship of twenty guns,\nand the command of the Lizard given to a man turned of fourscore,\nwho had been lieutenant since the reign of King William, and,\nnotwithstanding his long service, would have probably died in that\nstation, had he not applied some prize-money he had lately received,\nto make interest with his superiors. My friend Brayl was also made\nan officer about the same time, after he had served in quality of\na midshipman and mate for five and twenty years. Soon after these\nalterations, the admiral pitched upon our ship to carry home dispatches\nfor the ministry; and we set sail for England, having first scrubbed her\nbottom, and taken in provision and water for the occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nWe depart for Europe--a misunderstanding arises between the Captain and\nthe Surgeon, through the scandalous aspersions of Crampley--the Captain\ndies--Crampley tyrannises over the surgeon, who falls a Victim for his\nCruelty--I am also ill-used--the Ship strikes--the behaviour of Crampley\nand the Seamen on that occasion---I get on shore, challenge the Captain\nto single combat--am treacherously knocked down, wounded, and robbed\n\nNow that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I felt\nexcessive pleasure in finding myself out of sight of that fatal\nisland, which has been the grave of so many Europeans: and, as I was\naccommodated with everything to make the passage agreeable, I resolved\nto enjoy myself as much as the insolence of Crampley would permit. This\ninsidious slanderer had found means already to cause a misunderstanding\nbetween the surgeon and captain, who, by his age and infirmities, was\nrendered intolerably peevish, his disposition having also been soured\nby a long course of disappointments. He had a particular aversion to\nall young men, especially to surgeons, whom he considered unnecessary\nanimals on board of a ship; and, in consequence of these sentiments,\nnever consulted the doctor, notwithstanding his being seized with a\nviolent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a cask of Holland\ngin, which was his sovereign prescription against all distempers:\nwhether he was at this time too sparing, or took an overdose of his\ncordial, certain it is, he departed in the night, without any ceremony,\nwhich indeed was a thing he always despised, and was found stiff next\nmorning, to the no small satisfaction of Crampley, who succeeded to the\ncommand of the vessel. For that very reason, Mr. Tomlins and I had no\ncause to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new\ncommander would now be as unlimited as his power. The first day of his\ncommand justified our apprehensions: for, on pretence that the decks\nwere too much crowded, he ordered the surgeon's hencoops, with all his\nfowls, to be thrown overboard; and at the same time prohibited him and\nme from walking on the quarter-deck.\n\nMr. Tomlins could not help complaining of these injuries, and in the\ncourse of his expostulation dropped some hasty words, of which Crampley\ntaking hold, confined him to his cabin, where, in a few days, for want\nof air he was attacked by a fever, which soon put an end to his life,\nafter he had made his will, by which he bequeathed all his estate,\npersonal and real, to his sister, and left to me his watch and\ninstruments as memorials of his friendship. I was penetrated with grief\non this melancholy occasion; the more because there was nobody on board\nto whom I could communicate my sorrows, or of whom I could receive the\nleast consolation or advice. Crampley was so far from discovering the\nleast remorse for his barbarity, at the news of the surgeon's death,\nthat he insulted his memory in the most abusive manner, and affirmed\nhe had poisoned himself out of pure fear, dreading to be brought to\na court-martial for mutiny; for which reason he would not suffer the\nservice of the dead to be read over his body before it was thrown\noverboard.\n\nNothing but a speedy deliverance could have supported me under the\nbrutal sway of this bashaw, who, to render my life more irksome,\nsignified to my messmates a desire that I should be expelled from their\nsociety. This was no sooner hinted, than they granted his request; and\nI was fain to eat in a solitary manner by myself during the rest of the\npassage, which, however, soon drew to a period.\n\nWe had been seven weeks at sea, when the gunner told the captain that,\nby his reckoning, we must be in soundings, and desired he would order\nthe lead to be heaved. Crampley swore he did not know how to keep the\nship's way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings,\nand therefore he would not give himself the trouble to cast the lead.\nAccordingly we continued our course all that afternoon and night,\nwithout shortening sail, although the gunner pretended to discover\nScilly light; and next morning protested in form against the captain's\nconduct, for which he was put in confinement, We discovered no land all\nthat day, and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding;\nbut at three o'clock in the morning the ship struck, and remained fast\non a sand-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was\nimmediately hoisted out, but as we could not discern which way the shore\nlay, we were obliged to wait for daylight. In the meantime, the wind\nincreased, and the waves beat against the sloop with such violence, that\nwe expected she would have gone to pieces. The gunner was released and\nconsulted: he advised the captain to cut away the mast, in order to\nlighten her; this expedient was performed without success: the sailors,\nseeing things in a desperate situation, according to custom, broke\nup the chests belonging to the officers, dressed themselves in their\nclothes, drank their liquors without ceremony, and drunkenness, tumult,\nand confusion ensued.\n\nIn the midst of this uproar, I went below to secure my own effects,\nand found the carpenter's mate hewing down the purser's cabin with his\nhatchet, whistling all the while with great composure. When I asked his\nintention in so doing, he replied, very calmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only want to taste\nthe purser's rum, that's all, master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At that instant the purser coming\ndown, and seeing his effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of the\ninjustice done to him, and asked the fellow what occasion he had\nfor liquor when, in all likelihood, he would be in eternity in a few\nminutes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll's one for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said plunderer, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us live while we\ncan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiserable wretch that thou art!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the purser, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat must be\nthy lot in another world, if thou diest in the commission of robbery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, hell, I suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, with great deliberation,\nwhile the purser fell on his knees, and begged of Heaven that we might\nnot all perish for the sake of Jonas.\n\nDuring this dialogue I clothed myself in my bed apparel, girded on\nmy hanger, stuck my pistols, loaded, in my belt, disposed of all my\nvaluable moveables about my person, and came upon deck with a resolution\nof taking the first opportunity to get on shore, which, when the day\nbroke, appeared at the distance of three miles ahead. Crampley, finding\nhis efforts to get the ship off ineffectual, determined to consult his\nown safety, by going into the boat, which he had no sooner done, than\nthe ship's company followed so fast, that she would have sunk alongside,\nhad not some one wiser than the rest cut the rope and put off. But\nbefore this happened, I had made several attempts to get in, and was\nalways balked by the captain, who was so eager in excluding me, that he\ndid not mind the endeavours of any other body. Enraged at this inhuman\npartiality, and seeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my pistols from my\nbelt, and cocking it, swore I would shoot any man who would presume to\nobstruct my entrance. So saying, I leaped with my full exertion, and got\non board of the boat with the loss of the skin of my shins. I chanced in\nmy descent to overturn Crampley, who no sooner got up than he struck\nat me several times with a cutlass, and ordered the men to throw me\noverboard; but they were too anxious about their own safety to mind what\nhe said. Though the boat was very deeply loaded, and the sea terribly\nhigh, we made shift to get upon dry land in less than an hour after\nwe parted from the sloop. As soon as I set my foot on terra firma,\nmy indignation, which had boiled so long within me, broke out against\nCrampley, whom I immediately challenged to single combat, presenting my\npistols, that he might take his choice: he took one without hesitation,\nand, before I could cock the other, fired in my face, throwing the\npistol after the shot. I felt myself stunned, and imagining the bullet\nhad entered my brain, discharged mine as quick as possible, that I might\nnot die unrevenged: then flying upon my antagonist, knocked out several\nof his fore-teeth with the butt-end of the piece, and would certainly\nhave made an end of him with that instrument, had he not disengaged\nhimself, and seized his cutlass, which he had given to his servant\nwhen he received the pistol. Seeing him armed in this manner, I drew my\nhanger, and, having flung my pistol at his head, closed with him in\na transport of fury, and thrust my weapon into his mouth, which it\nenlarged on one side to his ear. Whether the smart of this wound\ndisconcerted him, or the unevenness of the ground made him reel, I know\nnot, but he staggered some paces back: I followed close, and with one\nstroke cut the tendons of the back of his hand, Upon which his cutlass\ndropped, and he remained defenceless. I know not with what cruelty my\nrage might have inspired me, if I had not at that instant been felled to\nthe ground by a blow on the back part of my head, which deprived me of\nall sensation. In this deplorable situation, exposed to the rage of an\nincensed barbarian, and the rapine of an inhuman crew, I remained for\nsome time; and whether any disputes arose among them during the state\nof my annihilation, I cannot pretend to determine; but in one particular\nthey seemed to have been unanimous, and acted with equal dexterity and\ndispatch; for when I recovered the use of my understanding, I found\nmyself alone in a desolate place, stripped of my clothes, money, watch,\nbuckles, and everything but my shoes, stockings, breeches and shirt.\nWhat a discovery must this have been to me, who, but an hour before, was\nworth sixty guineas in cash! I cursed the hour of my birth, the parents\nthat gave me being, the sea that did not swallow me up, the poniard of\nthe enemy, which could not find the way to my heart, the villainy of\nthose who had left me in that miserable condition; and in the ecstacy of\ndespair resolved to be still where I was, and perish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nI get up and crawl into a barn, where I am in danger of perishing,\nthrough the fear of the country people--their inhumanity--I am succoured\nby a reputed witch--her story--her advice--she recommends me as a valet\nto a single lady, whose character she explains\n\nBut as I lay ruminating, my passion insensibly abated; I considered my\nsituation in quite another light, from that in which it appeared to me\nat first, and the result of my deliberation was to rise if I could, and\ncrawl to the next inhabited place for assistance. With some difficulty\nI got upon my legs, and having examined my body, found I had received no\nother injury than two large contused wounds, one on the fore and another\non the hinder part of my head, which seemed to be occasioned by the same\nweapon, namely, the butt-end of a pistol. I looked towards the sea, but\ncould discern no remains of the ship; so that I concluded she was gone\nto pieces, and that those who remained in her had perished: but, as I\nafterwards learned, the gunner, who had more sagacity than Crampley,\nobserving that it was flood when he left her, and that she would\nprobably float at high water, made no noise about getting on shore,\nbut continued on deck, in hopes of bringing her safe into some harbour,\nafter her commander should have deserted her, for which piece of\nservice he expected, no doubt, to be handsomely rewarded. This scheme he\naccordingly executed, and was promised great things by the Admiralty for\nsaving his Majesty's ship: but I never heard he reaped the fruits of his\nexpectation. As for my own part, I directed my course towards a small\ncottage I perceived, and in the road picked up a seaman's old jacket,\nwhich I suppose the thief who dressed himself in my clothes had thrown\naway: this was a very comfortable acquisition to me, who was almost\nstiff with cold: I therefore put it on; and, as my natural heat revived,\nmy wounds, which had left off bleeding, burst out afresh; so that,\nfinding myself excessively exhausted, I was about to lie down in the\nfields, when I discovered a barn on my left hand, within a few yards of\nme; thither I made shift to stagger, and finding the door open, went in,\nbut saw nobody; however, I threw myself upon a truss of straw, hoping\nto be soon relieved by some person or other. I had not lain here many\nminutes, when I saw a countryman come in with a pitchfork in his hand,\nwhich he was upon the point of thrusting into the straw that concealed\nme, and in all probability would have done my business, had I not\nuttered a dreadful groan, after having essayed in vain to speak. This\nmelancholy note alarmed the clown, who started back, and discovering\na body all besmeared with blood, stood trembling, with the pitchfork\nextended before him, his hair bristling up, his eyes staring, his\nnostrils dilated, and his mouth wide open. At another time I should have\nbeen much diverted by this figure, which preserved the same attitude\nvery near ten minutes, during which time I made many unsuccessful\nefforts to implore his compassion and assistance; but my tongue failed\nme, and my language was only a repetition of groans. At length an old\nman arrived, who, seeing the other in such a posture, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMercy upon\nen! the leaad's bewitched! why, Dick, beest thou besayd thyself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dick,\nwithout moving his eyes from the object that terrified him, replied,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO vather! vatber! here be either the devil or a dead mon: I doant know\nwhich o'en, but a groans woundily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The father, whose eyesight was none\nof the best, pulled out his spectacles, and, having applied them to\nhis nose reconnoitered me over his son's shoulder: but no sooner did he\nbehold me, than he was seized with a fit of shaking, even more violent\nthan Dick's, and, with a broken accent, addressed me thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name\nof the Vather, Zun, and Holy Ghost, I charge you, an you been Satan, to\nbe gone to the Red Zen; but an you be a moordered mon, speak, that you\nmay have a Christom burial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs I was not in a condition to satisfy him in this particular, he\nrepeated his conjuration to no purpose, and they continued a good while\nin the agonies of fear. At length the father proposed that the son\nshould draw nearer, and take a more distinct view of the apparition; but\nDick was of opinion that his father should advance first, he being an\nold man past his labour and, if he received any mischief, the loss would\nbe the smaller; whereas he himself might escape, and be useful, in his\ngeneration. This prudential reason had no effect upon the senior, who\nstill kept Dick between me and him. In the meantime I endeavoured to\nraise one hand as a signal of distress, but had only strength sufficient\nto produce a rustling among the straw, which discomposed the young\npeasant so much, that he sprang out at the door, and overthrew his\nfather in his flight. The old gentleman would not spend time in getting\nup, but crawled backwards like a crab, with great speed, till he had got\nover the threshold, mumbling exorcisms all the way. I was exceedingly\nmortified to find myself in danger of perishing through the ignorance\nand cowardice of these clowns; and felt my spirits decay apace, when an\nold woman entered the barn, followed by the two fugitives and with great\nintrepidity advanced to the place where I lay, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it be the\ndevil I fearen not, and for a dead mon a can do us no harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When she\nsaw my condition, she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere be no devil, but in your en fool's\nhead. Here be a poor miserable wretch bleeding to death, and if a dies,\nwe must be at the charge of burying him; therefore, Dick, go vetch the\nold wheelbarrow and put en in, and carry en to goodman Hodge's backdoor;\nhe is more able than we to pay out money upon poor vagrants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her advice\nwas taken, and immediately put in execution; I was rolled to the other\nfarmer's door, where I was tumbled out like a heap of dung; and should\ncertainly have fallen a prey to the hogs, if my groans had not disturbed\nthe family, and brought some of them out to view my situation. But Hodge\nresembled the Jew more than the good Samaritan, and ordered me to be\ncarried to the house of the parson, whose business it was to practise as\nwell as to preach charity; observing that it was sufficient for him to\npay his quota towards the maintenance of the poor belonging to his own\nparish. When I was set down at the vicar's gate, he fell into a mighty\npassion, and threatened to excommunicate him who sent, as well as those\nwho brought me, unless they would move me immediately to another\nplace. About this time I fainted with the fatigue I had undergone, and\nafterwards understood that I was bandied from door to door through a\nwhole village, nobody having humanity enough to administer the least\nrelief to me, Until an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the\nneighbourhood, hearing of my distress, received me into her house, and,\nhaving dressed my wounds, brought me to myself with cordials of her own\npreparing. I was treated with great care and tenderness by this grave\nmatron, who, after I had recovered some strength, desired to know the\nparticulars of my last disaster. This piece of satisfaction I could not\nrefuse to one who had saved my life, therefore related all my\nadventures without exaggeration or reserve. She seemed surprised at the\nvicissitudes I had undergone, and drew a happy presage of my future life\nfrom my past suffering, then launched out into the praise of adversity,\nwith so much ardour and good sense, that I concluded she was a person\nwho had seen better days, and conceived a longing desire to hear her\nstory. She perceived my drift by some words I dropped, and smiling told\nme, there was nothing either entertaining or extraordinary in the\ncourse of her fortune; but, however, she would communicate it to me, in\nconsideration of the confidence I had reposed in her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is of little\nconsequence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto tell the names of my parents, who are dead\nmany years ago; let it suffice to assure you, they were wealthy, and\nhad no other child than me; so that I was looked upon as heiress to a\nconsiderable estate, and teased with addresses on that account. Among\nthe number of my admirers, there was a young gentleman of no fortune,\nwhose sole dependence was on his promotion in the army, in which, at\nthat time, he bore a lieutenant's commission. I conceived an affection\nfor this amiable officer, which, in a short time, increased to a violent\npassion, and without entering into minute circumstances, married him\nprivately. We had not enjoyed one another long in stolen interviews,\nwhen he was ordered with his regiment to Flanders; but, before he set\nout, it was agreed between us, that we should declare our marriage to\nmy father by letter, and implore his pardon for the step we had taken\nwithout his approbation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This discovery was made while I was abroad\nvisiting, and just as I was about to return home, I received a letter\nfrom my father, importing that, since I had acted so undutifully and\nmeanly as to marry a beggar, without his privity or consent, to the\ndisgrace of his family as well as the disappointment of his hopes,\nhe renounced me to the miserable fate I had entailed upon myself, and\ncharged me never to set foot within his doors again. This rigid sentence\nwas confirmed by my mother, who, in a postscript, gave me to understand\nthat her sentiments were exactly conformable to those of my father, and\nthat I might save myself the trouble of making any applications, for\nher resolutions were unalterable. Thunderstruck with my evil fortune I\ncalled a coach, and drove to my husband's lodgings, where I found him\nwaiting the event of his letter. Though he could easily divine by my\nlooks the issue of his declaration, he read with great steadiness the\nepistle I had received; and with a smile full of tenderness, which I\nshall never forget, embraced me, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe the good lady your\nmother might have spared herself the trouble of the last part of her\npostscript. Well, my dear Betty, you must lay aside all thoughts of a\ncoach, till I can procure the command of a regiment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This unconcerned\nbehaviour, while it enabled me to support my reverse of fortune, at\nthe same time endeared him to me the more, by convincing me of his\ndisinterested views in espousing me. I was next day boarded in company\nwith the wife of another officer, who had long been the friend and\nconfidant of my husband, at a village not far from London, where they\nparted with us in the most melting manner, went to Flanders, and were\nkilled in sight of one another at the battle of the Wood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should I tire you with a description of our unutterable sorrow at\nthe fatal news of this event, the remembrance of which now fills my aged\neyes with tears! When our grief subsided a little, and reflection came\nto our aid, we found ourselves deserted by the whole world, and in\ndanger of perishing by want; whereupon we made application for the\npension, and were put upon the list. Then, vowing eternal friendship,\nsold our jewels and superfluous clothes, retired to this place (which is\nin the county of Sussex) bought this little house, where we lived many\nyears in a solitary manner, indulging our mutual sorrow, till it pleased\nHeaven to call away my companion two years ago; since which time I have\nlingered out an unhappy being, in hopes of a speedy dissolution, when\nI promise myself the eternal reward of all my cares. In the meantime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must inform you of the character I bear among my\nneighbours. My conversation being different from that of the inhabitants\nof the village, my recluse way of life, my skill in curing distempers,\nwhich I acquired from books since I settled here, and lastly, my age\nhaving made the common people look upon me as something preternatural,\nand I am actually, at this hour, believed to be a witch. The parson\nof the parish, whose acquaintance I have not been at much pains to\ncultivate, taking umbrage at my supposed disrespect, has contributed not\na little towards the confirmation of this opinion, by dropping\ncertain hints to my prejudice among the vulgar, who are also very much\nscandalised at my entertaining this poor tabby cat with the collar about\nher neck, which was a favourite of my deceased companion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe whole behaviour of this venerable person was so primitive, innocent,\nsensible, and humane, that I contracted a filial respect for her, and\nbegged her advice with regard to my future conduct, as soon as I was\nin a condition to act for myself. She dissuaded me from a design I had\nformed of travelling to Louder, in hopes of retrieving my clothes and\npay, by returning to my ship, which by this time I read in the newspaper\nwas safely arrived in the River Thames: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou run\nthe hazard of being treated not only as a deserter in quitting the\nsloop, but also as a mutineer, in assaulting your commanding officer,\nto the malice of whose revenge you will moreover be exposed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\nthen promised to recommend me, as servant to a single lady of her\nacquaintance, who lived in the neighbourhood with her nephew, who was a\nyoung foxhunter of great fortune, where I might be very happy, provided\nI could bear with the disposition and manners of my mistress, which were\nsomewhat whimsical and particular. But, above all things, she counselled\nme to conceal my story, the knowledge of which would effectually poison\nmy entertainment; for it was a maxim, among most people of condition,\nthat no gentleman ought to be admitted into a family as a domestic,\nlest he become lazy, and insolent. I was fain to embrace this humble\nproposal, because my affairs were desperate; and in a few days was\nhired by this lady, to serve in quality of her footman, having been\nrepresented by my hostess as a young man who was bred up to the sea by\nhis relations against his will, and had suffered shipwreck, which had\nincreased his disgust to that way of life so much, that he rather chose\nto go to service on shore, than enter himself on board of any other\nship. Before I took possession of my new place, she gave me a sketch\nof my mistress's character, that I might know better how to regulate my\nconduct.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a maiden of forty years, not so remarkable\nfor her beauty as her learning and taste, which is famous all over the\ncountry. Indeed, she is a perfect female virtuoso, and so eager after\nthe pursuit of knowledge that she neglects her person even to a degree\nof sluttishness; this negligence, together with her contempt of the male\npart of the creation, gives her nephew no great concern, as by these\nmeans he will probably keep her fortune, which is considerable in\nthe family. He therefore permits her to live in her own way, which is\nsomething extraordinary, and gratifies her in all her whimsical desires.\nHer apartment is at some distance from the other inhabited parts of the\nhouse; and consists of a dining-room, bedchamber, and study; she keeps a\ncook maid, a waiting-woman, and footman, of her own, and seldom eats\nor converses with any of the family but her niece, who is a very lovely\ncreature, and humours her aunt often to the prejudice of her own health\nby sitting up with her whole nights together; for your mistress is too\nmuch of a philosopher to be swayed by the custom of the world, and\nnever sleeps nor eats like other people. Among other odd notions, she\nprofesses the principles of Rosicrucius, and believes the earth, air,\nand sea, are inhabited by invisible beings, with whom it is possible for\nthe human species to entertain correspondence and intimacy, on the easy\ncondition of living chaste. As she hopes one day to be admitted into an\nacquaintance of this kind, she no sooner heard of me and my cat,\nthan she paid me a visit, with a view, as she has since owned, to be\nintroduced to my familiar; and was greatly mortified to find herself\ndisappointed in her expectation. Being by this visionary turn of mind\nabstracted as it were from the world, she cannot advert to the common\noccurrences of life; and therefore is frequently so absent as to commit\nvery strange mistakes and extravagancies, which you will do well to\nrectify and repair, as your prudence shall suggest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nMy Reception by that Lady--I become enamoured of Narcissa--recount\nthe particulars of my last misfortune--acquire the good opinion of my\nMistress--an Account of the young Squire--I am made acquainted with more\nparticulars of Narcissa's Situation--conceive a mortal hatred against\nSir Timothy--examine my Lady's library and performances--her extravagant\nbehaviour\n\nFraught with these useful instructions, I repaired to the place of her\nhabitation, and was introduced by the waiting-woman to the presence of\nmy lady, who had not before seen me. She sat in her study, with one foot\non the ground, and the other upon a high stool at some distance from her\nseat; her sandy locks hung down, in a disorder I cannot call beautiful,\nfrom her head, which was deprived of its coif, for the benefit of\nscratching with one hand, while she held the stump of a pen in the\nother. Her forehead was high and wrinkled; her eyes were large, gray,\nand prominent; her nose was long, and aquiline: her mouth of vast\ncapacity, her visage meagre and freckled, and her chin peaked like a\nshoemaker's paring knife; her upper lip contained a large quantity of\nplain Spanish, which, by continual falling, had embroidered her neck,\nthat was not naturally very white, and the breast of her gown, that\nflowed loose about her with a negligence that was truly poetic,\ndiscovering linen that was very fine, and, to all appearance, never\nwashed but in Castalian streams. Around her lay heaps of books, globes,\nquadrants, telescopes, and other learned apparatus; her snuff-box stood\nat her right hand: at her left hand lay her handkerchief, sufficiently\nused, and a convenience to spit in appeared on one side of her chair.\nShe being in a reverie when we entered, the maid did not think proper\nto disturb her; so that we waited some minutes unobserved, during which\ntime she bit the quill several times, altered her position, made many\nwry faces, and, at length, with an air of triumph, repeated aloud:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor dare th'immortal gods my rage oppose!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving committed her success to paper, she turned towards the door,\nand perceiving us, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's the young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied my conductress, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhom Mrs. Sagely recommended as a footman\nto your ladyship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On this information she stared in my face for a\nconsiderable time, and then asked my name, which I thought proper\nto conceal under that of John Brown. After having surveyed me with\na curious eye, she broke out into, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO! ay, thou wast shipwrecked, I\nremember. Whether didst thou come on shore on the back of a whale or a\ndolphin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this I answered, I had swam ashore without any assistance.\nThen she demanded to know if I had ever been at the Hellespont, and swam\nfrom Sestos to Abydos. I replied in the negative; upon which she bade\nthe maid order a suit of new livery for me, and instruct me in the\narticles of my duty: so she spit in her snuff-box, and wiped her nose\nwith her cap, which lay on the table, instead of a handkerchief.\n\nWe returned to the kitchen, where I was regaled by the maids, who seemed\nto vie with each other in expressing their regard for me; and from them\nI understood, that my business consisted in cleaning knives and forks,\nlaying the cloth, waiting at table, carrying messages, and attending my\nlady when she went abroad. There was a very good suit of livery in the\nhouse, which had belonged to my predecessor deceased, and it fitted\nme exactly; so that there was no occasion for employing a tailor on my\naccount. I had not been long equipped in this manner, when my lady's\nbell rung; upon which, I ran up stairs, and found her stalking about\nthe room in her shift and under petticoat only; I would immediately have\nretired as became me, but she bade me come in, and air a clean shift for\nher; which operation I having performed with some backwardness, she put\nit on before me without any ceremony, and I verily believe was ignorant\nof my sex all that time, as being quite absorbed in contemplation. About\nfour o'clock in the afternoon I was ordered to lay the cloth, and place\ntwo covers, which I understood were for my mistress and her niece, whom\nI had not as yet seen. Though I was not very dexterous at this work, I\nperformed it pretty well for a beginner, and, when dinner was upon the\ntable, saw my mistress approach, accompanied by the young lady, whose\nname for the present shall be Narcissa. So much sweetness appeared in\nthe countenance and carriage of this amiable apparition, that my heart\nwas captivated at first sight, and while dinner lasted, I gazed upon her\nwithout intermission. Her age seemed to be seventeen, her stature tall,\nher shape unexceptionable, her hair, that fell down upon her ivory neck\nin ringlets, black as jet; her arched eyebrows of the same colour;\nher eyes piercing, yet tender; her lips of the consistence and hue of\ncherries; her complexion clear, delicate and healthy; her aspect noble,\ningenuous, and humane; and the whole person so ravishingly delightful,\nthat it was impossible for any creature endued with sensibility, to see\nwithout admiring, and admire without loving her to excess. I began to\ncurse the servile station that placed me so far beneath the regard of\nthis idol of my adoration! and yet I blessed my fate, that enabled me to\nenjoy daily the sight of so much perfection! When she spoke I listened\nwith pleasure; but when she spoke to me, my soul was thrilled with an\nextacy of tumultuous joy. I was even so happy as to be the subject of\ntheir conversation; for Narcissa, having observed me, said to her aunt,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see your new footman is come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then addressing herself to me, asked,\nwith ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly\nused by robbers? When I had satisfied her in this; she expressed a\ndesire of knowing the other particulars of my fortune, both before and\nsince my being shipwrecked: hereupon (as Mrs. Sagely had counselled me)\nI told her that I had been bound apprentice to the master of a ship,\ncontrary to my inclination, which ship had foundered at sea; that I and\nfour more, who chanced to be on deck when she went down, made shift\nto swim to the shore, when my companions, after having overpowered me,\nstripped me to the shirt, and left me, as they imagined, dead of the\nwounds I received in my own defence. Then I related the circumstances\nof being found in a barn, with the inhuman treatment I met with from the\ncountry people and parson; the description of which, I perceived, drew\ntears from the charming creature's eyes. When I had finished my recital,\nmy mistress, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMa foi! le garcon est bien fait!\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which opinion\nNarcissa assented, with a compliment to my understanding, in the same\nlanguage, that flattered my vanity extremely.\n\nThe conversation, among other subjects, turned upon the young squire,\nwhom my lady inquired after under the title of the Savage; and was\ninformed by her niece that he was still in bed, repairing the fatigue of\nlast night's debauch, and recruiting strength and spirits to undergo a\nfox chase to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Timothy Thicket, Squire\nBumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the same stamp, whom he had\ninvited on that occasion! so that by daybreak the whole house would\nbe in an uproar. This was a very disagreeable piece of news to the\nvirtuoso, who protested she would stuff her ears with cotton when she\nwent to bed, and take a dose of opium to make her sleep the more sound,\nthat she might not be disturbed and distracted by the clamour of the\nbrutes.\n\nWhen their dinner was over, I and my fellow servants sat down to ours in\nthe kitchen, where I understood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy\nknight in the neighbourhood, between whom and Narcissa a match had been\nprojected by her brother, who promised at the same time to espouse Sir\nTimothy's sister; by which means, as their fortunes were pretty equal,\nthe young ladies would be provided for, and their brothers be never the\npoorer; but that the ladies did not concur in the scheme, each of them\nentertaining a hearty contempt for the person allotted to her for\na husband by this agreement. This information begat in me a mortal\naversion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival, and cursed in\nmy heart for his presumption.\n\nNext morning, by daybreak, being awakened by the noise of the hunters\nand hounds, I rose to view the cavalcade, and had a sight of my\ncompetitor, whose accomplishments (the estate excluded) did not seem\nbrilliant enough to give me much uneasiness with respect to Narcissa,\nwho, I flattered myself, was not to be won by such qualifications as he\nwas master of, either as to person or mind. My mistress, notwithstanding\nher precaution, was so much disturbed by her nephew's company, that\nshe did not rise till five o'clock in the afternoon; so that I had an\nopportunity of examining her study at leisure, to which examination I\nwas strongly prompted by my curiosity. Here I found a thousand scraps\nof her own poetry, consisting of three, four, ten, twelve, and twenty\nlines, on an infinity of subjects, which, as whim inspired, she\nhad begun, without constancy or capacity to bring to any degree of\ncomposition: but, what was very extraordinary in a female poet, there\nwas not the least mention made of love in any of her performances. I\ncounted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of which were \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Stern\nPhilosopher,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Double,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sacrilegious Traitor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fall\nof Lucifer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Last Day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From whence I gathered, that her\ndisposition was gloomy, and her imagination delighted with objects of\nhorror. Her library was composed of the best English historians, poets,\nand philosophers; of all the French critics and poets, and of a few\nbooks in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head of which were Tasso and\nAriosto, pretty much used. Besides these, translations of the classics\ninto French, but not one book in Greek or Latin; a circumstance that\ndiscovered her ignorance in these languages.\n\nAfter having taken a full view of this collection, I retired, and at the\nusual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the maid\nthat her mistress was still in bed, and had been so affected with the\nnotes of the hounds in the morning, that she actually believed herself\na hare beset by the hunters, and begged a few greens to munch\nfor breakfast. When I expressed my surprise in this unaccountable\nimagination she gave me to understand that her lady was very much\nsubject to whims of this nature; sometimes fancying herself an animal,\nsometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceited transformations\nit was very dangerous to come near her, especially when she represented\na beast; for that lately, in the character of a cat, she had flown at\nher, and scratched her face in a terrible manner: that some months ago,\nshe prophesied the general conflagration was at hand, and nothing would\nbe able to quench it but her water, which therefore she kept so long,\nthat her life was in danger, and she must needs have died of the\nretention, had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate, by\nkindling a bonfire under her chamber window and persuading her that the\nhouse was in flames: upon which, with great deliberation, she bade them\nbring all the tubs and vessels they could find to be filled for the\npreservation of the house, into one of which she immediately discharged\nthe cause of her distemper. I was also informed that nothing contributed\nso much to the recovery of her reason as music, which was always\nadministered on those occasions by Narcissa, who played perfectly well\non the harpsichord, and to whom she (the maid) was just then going to\nintimate her aunt's disorder.\n\nShe was no sooner gone than I was summoned by the bell to my lady's\nchamber, where I found her sitting squat on her hands on the floor, in\nthe manner of puss when she listens to the outcries of her pursuers.\nWhen I appeared, she started up with an alarmed look, and sprang to the\nother side of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, she mistook for\na beagle thirsting after her life. Perceiving her extreme confusion, I\nretired, and on the staircase met the adorable Narcissa coming up, to\nwhom I imparted the situation of my mistress; she said not a word, but\nsmiling with unspeakable grace, went into her aunt's apartment, and in\na little time my ears were ravished with the efforts of her skill. She\naccompanied the instrument with a voice so sweet and melodious, that I\ndid not wonder at the surprising change it produced on the spirits of my\nmistress which composed to peace and sober reflection.\n\nAbout seven o'clock, the hunters arrived with the skins of two foxes and\none badger, carried before them as trophies of their success; and when\nthey were about to sit down to dinner (or supper) Sir Timothy Thicket\ndesired that Narcissa would honour the table with her presence; but\nthis request, notwithstanding her brother's threats and entreaties, she\nrefused, on pretence of attending her aunt, who was indisposed; so\nI enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my rival mortified: but this\ndisappointment made no great impression on him, who consoled himself\nwith the bottle, of which the whole company became so enamoured that,\nafter a most horrid uproar of laughing, singing, swearing, and fighting,\nthey were all carried to bed in a state of utter oblivion. My duty being\naltogether detached from the squire and his family, I led a pretty easy\nand comfortable life, drinking daily intoxicating draughts of love from\nthe charms of Narcissa, which brightened on my contemplation every day\nmore and more. Inglorious as my station was, I became blind to my own\nunworthiness, and even conceived hopes of one day enjoying this amiable\ncreature, whose, affability greatly encouraged these presumptuous\nthoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nMy mistress is surprised at my learning--communicates her performances\nto me--I impart some of mine to her--am mortified at her faint\npraise--Narcissa approves of my conduct--I gain an involuntary\nconquest over the cookwench and dairymaid--their mutual resentment and\ninsinuations--the jealousy of their lovers\n\nDuring this season of love and tranquillity, my muse, which had lain\ndormant so long, awoke, and produced several small performances on\nthe subject of my flame. But as it concerned me nearly to remain\nundiscovered in my character and sentiments, I was under a necessity of\nmortifying my desire of praise, by confining my works to my own perusal\nand applause. In the meantime I strove to insinuate myself into the\ngood opinion of both ladies; and succeeded so well, by my diligence\nand dutiful behaviour, that in a little time I was at least a favourite\nservant; and frequently enjoyed the satisfaction of hearing myself\nmentioned in French and Italian, with some degree of warmth and surprise\nby the dear object of all my wishes, as a person who had so much of the\ngentleman in my appearance and discourse, that she could not for her\nsoul treat me like a common lacquey. My prudence and modesty were not\nlong proof against these bewitching compliments. One day, while I waited\nat dinner, the conversation turned upon a knotty passage of Tasso's\nGierusalem, which, it seems, had puzzled them both: after a great many\nunsatisfactory conjectures, my mistress, taking the book out of her\npocket, turned up the place in question, and read the sentence over\nand over without success; at length, despairing of finding the author's\nmeaning, she turned to me, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome hither, Bruno; let us see what\nfortune will do for us: I will interpret to thee what goes before, and\nwhat follows this obscure paragraph, the particular words of which I\nwill also explain, that thou mayst, by comparing one with another, guess\nthe sense of that which perplexes us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was too vain to let slip this\nopportunity of displaying my talents; therefore, without hesitation,\nread and explained the whole of that which had disconcerted them, to\nthe utter astonishment of both. Narcissa's face and lovely neck were\noverspread with blushes, from which I drew a favourable opinion,\nwhile her aunt, after having stared at me a good while with a look of\namazement, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of heaven who art thou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told her\nI had picked up a smattering of Italian, during a voyage up the Straits.\nAt this explanation she shook her head, and observed that no smatterer\ncould read as I had done. She then desired to know if I understood\nFrench. To which question I answered in the affirmative. She asked if I\nwas acquainted with the Latin and Greek? I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA little.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand with philosophy and mathematics, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I owned\nI knew something of each. Then she repeated her stare and interrogation.\nI began to repent of my vanity, and in order to repair the fault I\ncommitted, said, it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable\neducation, for learning was so cheap in my country, that every peasant\nwas a scholar; but, I hoped her Ladyship would think my understanding no\nexception to my character. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, God forbid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But during the rest of\nthe time they sat at table, they behaved with remarkable reserve.\n\nThis alteration gave me great uneasiness; and I passed the night without\nsleep, in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men, which\nprompts them to commit so many foolish actions, contrary to their\nown sober judgment. Next day, however, instead of profiting by this\nself-condemnation, I yielded still more to the dictates of the principle\nI had endeavoured to chastise, and if fortune had not befriended me more\nthan prudence could expect, I should have been treated with the contempt\nit deserved. After breakfast my lady, who was a true author, bade me\nfollow her into the study, where she expressed herself thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince you\nare so learned, you cannot be void of taste; therefore I am to desire\nyour opinion of a small performance in poetry, which I lately composed.\nYou must know that I have planned a tragedy, the subject of which shall\nbe, the murder of a prince before the altar, where he is busy at his\ndevotions. After the deed is perpetrated, the regicide will harangue the\npeople with the bloody dagger in his hand; and I have already composed a\nspeech, which, I think, will suit the character extremely. Here it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Then, taking up a scrap of paper, she read, with violent emphasis and\ngesture, as follows:--\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus have I sent the simple King to hell, Without or coffin, shroud, or\npassing bell: To me what are divine and human laws? I court no sanction\nbut my own applause! Rapes, robberies, treasons, yield my soul delight,\nAnd human carnage gratifies my sight: I drag the parent by the hoary\nhair, And toss the sprawling infant on the spear, While the fond\nmother's cries regale my ear. I fight, I vanquish, murder friends and\nfoes; Nor dare the immortal gods my rage oppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThough I did great violence to my understanding in praising this\nunnatural rhapsody, I nevertheless extolled it as a production that of\nitself deserved immortal fame; and besought her ladyship to bless the\nworld with the fruits of those uncommon talents Heaven had bestowed upon\nher. She smiled with a look of self-complacency, and encouraged by\nthe incense I had offered, communicated all her poetical works which I\napplauded, one by one, with as little candour as I had shown at first.\nSatiated with my flattery, which I hope my situation justified, she\ncould not in conscience refuse me an opportunity of shining in my turn:\nand, therefore, after a compliment to my nice discernment and taste,\nobserved, that doubtless I must have produced something in that way\nmyself, which she desired to see. This was temptation I could by no\nmeans resist. I owned that while I was at college I wrote some detached\npieces, at the desire of a friend who was in love; and at her request\nrepeated the following verses, which indeed my love for Narcissa had\ninspired:--\n\n\nOn Celia,\n\nPlaying on the harpsichord and singing.\n\nWhen Sappho struck the quivering wire, The throbbing breast was all on\nfire: And when she raised the vocal lay, The captive soul was charm'd\naway.\n\nBut had the nymph possessed with these Thy softer, chaster, power to\nplease; Thy beauteous air of sprightly youth, Thy native smiles of\nartless truth;\n\nThe worm of grief had never preyed On the forsaken love-sick maid: Nor\nhad she mourn'd a hapless flame, Nor dash'd on rocks her tender frame.\n\nMy mistress paid me a cold compliment on the versification, which, she\nsaid, was elegant enough, but, the subject beneath the pen of a true\npoet. I was extremely nettled at her indifference, and looked at\nNarcissa, who by this time had joined us, for her approbation; but\nshe declined giving her opinion, protesting she was no judge of\nthese matters; so that I was forced to retire very much balked in\nmy expectation, which was generally a little too sanguine. In the\nafternoon, however, the waiting-maid assured me that Narcissa had\nexpressed her approbation of my performance with great warmth, and\ndesired her to procure a copy of it as for herself, that she (Narcissa)\nmight have an opportunity to peruse it at pleasure. I was elated to an\nextravagant pitch at this intelligence, and immediately transcribed a\nfair copy of my Ode, which was carried to the dear charmer, together\nwith another on the same subject, as follows:--\n\n\nThy fatal shaft unerring move; I bow before thine altar, Love! I feel\nthou soft resistless flame Glide swift through all my vital frame!\n\nFor while I gaze my bosom glows, My blood in tides impetuous flows;\nHope, fear, and joy alternate roll, And floods of transports 'whelm my\nsoul!\n\nMy faltering tongue attempts in vain In soothing murmurs to complain; My\ntongue some secret magic ties, My murmurs sink in broken sighs.\n\nCondemn'd to nurse eternal care, And ever drop the silent tear, Unheard\nI mourn, unknown I sigh, Unfriended live, unpitied die!\n\nWhether or not Narcissa discovered my passion, I could not learn from\nher behaviour, which, though always benevolent to me was henceforth more\nreserved and less cheerful. While my thoughts aspired to a sphere so\nfar above me, I had unwittingly made a conquest of the cookwench and\ndairymaid, who became so jealous of each other that, if their sentiments\nhad been refined by education, it is probable one or other of them would\nhave had recourse to poison or steel to be avenged of her rival; but, as\ntheir minds were happily adapted to their humble station, their mutual\nenmity was confined to scolding and fistcuffs, in which exercise they\nwere both well skilled. My good fortune did not long remain a secret;\nfor it was disclosed by the frequent broils of these heroines, who kept\nno decorum in their encounters. The coachman and gardener, who paid\ntheir devoirs to my admirers, each to his respective choice, alarmed\nat my success, laid their heads together, in order to concert a plan\nof revenge; and the former, having been educated at the academy\nat Tottenham Court, undertook to challenge me to single combat. He\naccordingly, with many opprobrious invectives, bade me defiance, and\noffered to box me for twenty guineas. I told him that, although I\nbelieved myself a match for him even at that work I would not descend so\nfar below the dignity of a gentleman as to fight like a porter; but\nif he had anything to say to me, I was his man at blunderbuss, musket,\npistol, sword, hatchet, spit, cleaver, fork, or needle; nay, I swore,\nthat should he give his tongue any more saucy liberties at my expense,\nI would crop his ears without any ceremony. This rhodomontade, delivered\nwith a stern countenance and resolute tone, had the desired effect\nupon my antagonist, who, with some confusion, sneaked off, and gave his\nfriend an account of his reception.\n\nThe story, taking air among the servants, procured for me the title of\nGentleman John, with which I was sometimes honoured, even by my\nmistress and Narcissa, who had been informed of the whole affair by the\nchambermaid. In the meantime, the rival queens expressed their passion\nby all the ways in their power: the cook entertained me with choice\nbits, the dairymaid with strokings: the first would often encourage me\nto declare myself, by complimenting me upon my courage and learning, and\nobserving, that if she had a husband like me, to maintain order and\nkeep accounts, she could make a great deal of money, by setting up an\neating-house in London for gentlemen's servants on board wages. The\nother courted my affection by showing her own importance, and telling\nme that many a substantial farmer in the neighbourhood would be glad to\nmarry her, but she was resolved to please her eye, if she should plague\nher heart. Then she would launch out into the praise of my proper\nperson, and say, she was sure I would make a good husband, for I was\nvery good-natured. I began to be uneasy at the importunities of these\ninamoratas, whom, at another time perhaps, I might have pleased without\nthe disagreeable sauce of matrimony, but, at present, my whole soul\nwas engrossed by Narcissa; and I could not bear the thoughts of doing\nanything derogatory to the passion I entertained for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nNarcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is rescued\nby me, who revenge myself on my rival--I declare my passion, and\nretreat to the seaside--am surrounded by smugglers, and carried to\nBoulogne--find my Uncle Lieutenant Bowling in great distress, and\nrelieve him--our conversation\n\nAt certain intervals my ambition would revive; I would despise myself\nfor my tame resignation to my sordid fate, and revolve a hundred schemes\nfor assuming the character of a gentleman, to which I thought myself\nentitled by birth and education. In these fruitless suggestions time\nstole away unperceived, and I had already remained eight months in the\nstation of a footman, when an accident happened that put an end to my\nservitude, and, for the present, banished all hopes of succeeding in my\nlove.\n\nNarcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket, who lived with her brother\nwithin less than a mile of our house, and was persuaded to walk home in\nthe cool of the evening, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who, having a\ngood deal of the brute in him, was instigated to use some unbecoming\nfamiliarities with her, encouraged by the solitariness of a field\nthrough which they passed. The lovely creature was incensed at his rude\nbehaviour for which she reproached him in such a manner that he lost\nall regard to decency, and actually offered violence to this pattern of\ninnocence and beauty. But Heaven would not suffer so much goodness to\nbe violated, and sent me, who, passing by accident near the place, was\nalarmed with her cries, for her succour. What were the emotions of my\nsoul, when I beheld Narcissa almost sinking beneath the brutal force of\nthis satyr! I flew like lightning to her rescue, and he, perceiving me,\nquitted his prey, and drew his hanger to chastise my presumption. My\nindignation was too high to admit one thought of fear, so that, rushing\nupon him, I struck his weapon out of his hand, and used my cudgel so\nsuccessfully that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all appearance,\nwithout sense. Then I turned to Narcissa, who had swooned, and sitting\ndown by her, gently raised her head, and supported it on my bosom,\nwhile, with my hand around her waist, I kept her in that position.\nMy soul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling the object of my\ndearest wishes within my arms; and, while she lay insensible, I could\nnot refrain from applying my cheeks to hers, and ravishing a kiss. In\na little time the blood began to revisit her face, she opened her\nenchanting eyes, and, having recollected her late situation, said, with\na look full of tender acknowledgment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear John, I am eternally obliged\nto you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying she made an effort to rise, in which I assisted her,\nand she proceeded to the house, leaning upon me all the way. I was a\nthousand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my passion, but\nthe dread of disobliging her restrained my tongue. We had not moved\na hundred paces from the scene of her distress, when I perceived Sir\nTimothy rise and walk homeward--a circumstance which, though it gave\nme some satisfaction, inasmuch as I thereby knew I had not killed him,\nfilled me with just apprehension of his resentment, which I found myself\nin no condition to withstand; especially when I considered his intimacy\nwith our squire, to whom I knew he could justify himself for what he had\ndone, by imputing it to his love, and desiring his brother Bruin to take\nthe same liberty with his sister, without any fear of offence.\n\nWhen we arrived at the house, Narcissa assured me she would exert all\nher influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket, and likewise\nengage her aunt in my favour. At the same time, pulling out her purse,\noffered it as a small consideration for the service I had done her.\nBut I stood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the least\nsuspicion of being mercenary, and refused the present, by saying I had\nmerited nothing by barely doing my duty. She seemed astonished at my\ndisinterestedness, and blushed: I felt the same suffusion, and, with\na downcast eye and broken accent, told her I had one request to make,\nwhich, if her generosity would grant, I should think myself fully\nrecompensed, for an age of misery. She changed colour at this preamble,\nand, with great confusion, replied, she hoped my good sense would hinder\nme from asking anything she was bound in honour to refuse, and therefore\nbade me signify my desire. Upon which I kneeled, and engaged to kiss\nher hand. She immediately, with an averted look, stretched it out: I\nimprinted on it an ardent kiss, and, bathing it with my tears, cried,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentleman, and love you to distraction,\nbut would have died a thousand deaths rather than make this declaration\nunder such a servile appearance, were I not determined to yield to the\nrigour of my fate, to fly from your bewitching presence, and bury my\npresumptuous passion in eternal silence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words I rose, and\nwent away before she could recover her spirits so far as to make any\nreply.\n\nMy first care was to go and consult Mrs. Sagely, with whom I had\nentertained a friendly correspondence ever since I left her house. When\nshe understood my situation, the good woman, with real concern, condoled\nwith me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my resolution to leave\nthe country, as being perfectly well acquainted with the barbarous\ndisposition of my rival, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho, by this time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas no doubt\nmeditated a scheme of revenge. Indeed, I cannot see how you will be\nable to elude his vengeance; being himself in the commission, he will\nimmediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and, as almost all the\npeople in this country are dependent on him or his friend, it will\nbe impossible for you to find shelter among them. If you should be\napprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may possibly in\ngreat misery languish till the next assizes, and then be transported for\nassaulting a magistrate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile she thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door,\nwhich threw us both into great consternation, as in all probability, it\nwas occasioned by my pursuers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting\ntwo guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes, bade me, for God's\nsake, get out at the back-door and consult my safety as Providence\nshould direct me. There was no time for deliberation. I followed her\nadvice, and escaped by the benefit of a dark night to the seaside,\nwhere, while I ruminated on my next excursion, I was all of a sudden\nsurrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bade\nme make no noise on pain of being shot, and carried me on board of a\nvessel, which I soon perceived to be a smuggling cutter. This discovery\ngave me some satisfaction at first, because I concluded myself safe from\nthe resentment of Sir Timothy; but, when I found myself in the hands of\nruffians, who threatened to execute me for a spy, I would have thought\nmyself happily quit for a year's imprisonment, or even transportation.\nIt was in vain for me to protest my innocence: I could not persuade them\nthat I had taken a solitary walk to their haunt, at such an hour, merely\nfor my own amusement; and I did not think it my interest to disclose\nthe true cause of my retreat, because I was afraid they would have made\ntheir peace with justice by surrendering me to the penalty of the law.\nWhat confirmed their suspicion was, the appearance of a custom-house\nyacht, which gave them chase, and had well nigh made a prize of their\nvessel; when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which\neffectually screened them, and favoured their arrival at Boulogne. But,\nbefore they got out of sight of their pursuer, they held a council\nof war about me, and some of the most ferocious among them would have\nthrown me overboard as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies;\nbut others, more considerate, alleged, that if they put me to death,\nand should afterwards be taken, they could expect no mercy from the\nlegislature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. It\nwas therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I should be set\non shore in France, and left to find my way back to England, as I should\nthink proper, this being punishment sufficient for the bare suspicion of\na crime in itself not capital.\n\nAlthough this favourable determination gave me great pleasure, the\napprehension of being robbed would not suffer me to be perfectly at\nease. To prevent this calamity, as soon as I was untied, in consequence\nof the aforesaid decision, I tore a small hole in one of my stockings,\ninto which I dropped six guineas, reserving half a piece and some silver\nin my pocket, that, finding something, they might not be tempted to make\nany further inquiry. This was a very necessary precaution, for, when we\ncame within sight of the French shore, one of the smugglers told me, I\nmust pay for my passage. To this declaration I replied, that my passage\nwas none of my own seeking; therefore they could not expect a reward\nfrom me for transporting me into a strange country by force. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the outlaw, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnone of your palaver; but let me see what money you\nhave got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he thrust his hand into my pocket without any\nceremony, and emptied it of the contents; then, casting an eye at my hat\nand wig, which captivated his fancy, he took them off, clapping his own\non my head, declared, that a fair exchange was no robbery. I was fain to\nput up with this bargain, which was by no means favourable to me; and a\nlittle while after we went all on shore together.\n\nI resolved to take my leave of those desperadoes without much ceremony,\nwhen one of them cautioned me against appearing to their prejudice if\never I returned to England, unless I had a mind to be murdered; for\nwhich service, he assured me, the gang never wanted agents. I promised\nto observe his advice, and departed for the Upper Town, where I inquired\nfor a cabaret, or public-house, into which I went, with an intention\nof taking some refreshment. In the kitchen, five Dutch sailors sat at\nbreakfast with a large loaf, a firkin of butter, and a keg of brandy,\nthe bung of which they often applied to their mouths with great\nperseverance and satisfaction. At some distance from them I perceived\nanother person in the same garb, sitting in a pensive solitary manner,\nentertaining himself with a whiff of tobacco, from the stump of a pipe\nas black as jet. The appearance of distress never failed to attract\nmy regard and compassion. I approached this forlorn tar with a view to\noffer him my assistance, and, notwithstanding the alteration of dress\nand disguise of a long beard, I discovered in him my long lost and\nlamented uncle and benefactor, Lieutenant Bowling! Good Heaven! what\nwere the agitations of my soul, between the joy of finding again such a\nvaluable friend, and the sorrow of seeing him in such a low condition!\nThe tears gushed down my cheeks; I stood motionless and silent for some\ntime. At length, recovering the use of speech, I exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGracious\nGod! Mr. Bowling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d My uncle no sooner heard his name mentioned, than\nhe started up, crying, with some surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHolla!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, after having\nlooked at me steadfastly, without being able to recollect me, said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you call me, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him I had something extraordinary to\ncommunicate, and desired him to give me the hearing for a few minutes in\nanother room; but he would by no means consent to this proposal, saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAvast there, friend: none of your tricks upon travellers;--if you have\nanything to say to me, do it above board;--you need not be afraid of\nbeing overheard;--here are none who understand our lingo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though I was\nloth to discover myself before company, I could no longer refrain from\ntelling him I was his own nephew, Roderick Random. On this information,\nhe considered me with great earnestness and astonishment, and, recalling\nmy features, which, though enlarged, were not entirely altered since\nhe had seen me, came up, and shook me by the hand very cordially,\nprotesting he was glad to see me well. After some pause, he went on\nthus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet, my lad, I am sorry to see you under such colours; the\nmore so, as it is not in my power, at present, to change them for\nthe better, times being very hard with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words I could\nperceive a tear trickle down his furrowed cheek, which affected me so\nmunch that I wept bitterly.\n\nImagining my sorrow was the effect of my own misfortunes, he comforted\nme with observing, that life was a voyage in which we must expect to\nmeet with all weathers; sometimes was calm, sometimes rough; that a fair\ngale often succeeded a storm; that the wind did not always sit one\nway, and that despair signified nothing; that resolution and skill were\nbetter than a stout vessel: for why? because they require no carpenter,\nand grow stronger the more labour they undergo. I dried up my tears,\nwhich I assured him were not shed for my own distress, but for his, and\nbegged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could converse\nmore at our ease. There I recounted to him the ungenerous usage I had\nmet with from Potion; at which relation he started up, stalked across\nthe room three or four times in a great hurry, and, grasping his cudgel,\ncried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would I were alongside of him--that's all--I would I were\nalongside of him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I then gave him a detail of my adventures and\nsufferings, which affected him more than I could have imagined; and\nconcluded with telling him that Captain Oakun was still alive, and that\nhe might return to England when he would to solicit his affairs, without\ndanger or molestation. He was wonderfully pleased with this piece of\ninformation, of which, however, he said he could not at present avail\nhimself, for want of money to pay for his passage to London. This\nobjection I soon removed, by putting five guineas into his hand, and\ntelling him I thought myself extremely happy in having an opportunity\nof manifesting my gratitude to him in his necessity. But it was with the\nutmost difficulty I could prevail upon him to accept of two, which he\naffirmed were more than sufficient to defray the necessary expense.\n\nAfter this friendly contest was over, he proposed we should have a mess\nof something; \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit has been banyan day with me a great\nwhile. You must know I was shipwrecked, five days ago, near a place\ncalled Lisieux, in company with those Dutchmen who are now drinking\nbelow; and having but little money when I came ashore, it was soon\nspent, because I let them have share and share while it lasted.\nHowsomever, I should have remembered the old saying, every hog his own\napple; for when they found my hold unstowed, they went all hands to\nshooling and begging; and, because I would not take a spell at the same\nduty, refused to give me the least assistance; so that I have not broke\nbread these two days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was shocked at the extremity of his distress,\nand ordered some bread, cheese, and wine, to be brought immediately, to\nallay his hunger, until a fricassee of chickens could be prepared. When\nhe had recruited his spirits with this homely fare, I desired to\nknow the particulars of his peregrination since the accident at Cape\nTiberoon, which were briefly these: The money he had about him being all\nspent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality of the French cooled\nto such a degree, that he was obliged to list on board one of their\nking's ships as a common foremast man, to prevent himself from starving\non shore. In this situation he continued two years, during which time he\nhad acquired some knowledge of their language, and the reputation of a\ngood seaman; the ship he belonged to was ordered home to France, where\nshe was laid up as unfit for service, and he was received on board\none of Monsieur D'Antin's squadron, in quality of quartermaster; which\noffice he performed in a voyage to the West Indies, where he engaged\nwith our ship, as before related; but his conscience upbraiding him for\nserving the one enemies of his country, he quitted the ship at the same\nplace where he first listed, and got to Curacoa in a Dutch vessel; there\nhe bargained with a skipper, bound to Europe, to work for his passage\nto Holland, from whence he was in hopes of hearing from his friends in\nEngland; but was cast away, as he mentioned before, on the French coast,\nand must have been reduced to the necessity of travelling on foot to\nHolland, and begging for his subsistence on the road, or of entering on\nboard of another French man-of-war, at the hazard of being treated as\na deserter, if Providence had not sent me to his succour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, my\nlad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I shall steer my course directly to London,\nwhere I do not doubt of being replaced, and of having the R taken off\nme by the Lords of the Admiralty, to whom I intend to write a petition,\nsetting forth my case; if I succeed, I shall have wherewithal to give\nyou some assistance, because, when I left the ship, I had two years'\npay due to me, therefore I desire to know whither you are bound: and\nbesides, perhaps, I may have interest enough to procure a warrant\nappointing you surgeon's mate of the ship to which I shall belong--for\nthe beadle of the Admiralty is my good friend: and he and one of the\nunder clerks are sworn brothers, and that under clerk has a good deal\nto say with one of the upper clerks, who is very well known to the\nunder secretary, who, upon his recommendation, I hope, will recommend\nmy affair to the first secretary; and he again will speak to one of the\nlords in my behalf; so that you see I do not want friends to assist me\non occasion. As for the fellow Crampley, tho'f I know him not, I am sure\nhe is neither seaman nor officer, by what you have told me, or else he\ncould never be so much mistaken in his reckoning, as to run the ship on\nshore on the coast of Sussex before he believed himself in soundings;\nneither, when that accident happened, would he have left the ship until\nshe had been stove to pieces, especially when the tide was making;\nwherefore, by this time, I do suppose, he has been tried by a\ncourt-martial, and executed for his cowardice and misconduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could not help smiling at the description of my uncle's ladder, by\nwhich he proposed to climb to the attention of the board of admiralty;\nand, though I knew the world too well to confide in such dependence\nmyself, I would not discourage him with doubts, but asked if he had no\nfriend in London, who would advance a small sum of money to enable him\nto appear as he ought, and make a small present to the under secretary,\nwho might possibly dispatch his business the sooner on that account. He\nscratched his head, and after some recollection, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes, I\nbelieve Daniel Whipcord, the ship-chandler in Wapping, would not\nrefuse me such a small matter. I know I can have what credit I want for\nlodging, liquor, and clothes; but as to money, I won't be positive.\nHad honest Block been living, I should not have been at loss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was\nheartily sorry to find a worthy man so destitute of friends, when he had\nsuch need of them, and looked upon my own situation as less miserable\nthan his, because I was better acquainted with the selfishness and\nroguery of mankind, consequently less liable to disappointment and\nimposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nHe takes his passage in a cutter for Deal--we are accosted by a Priest,\nwho proves to be a Scotchman--his profession on friendship--he\nis affronted by the Lieutenant, who afterwards appeases him by\nsubmission--my uncle embarks--I am introduced by a Priest to a Capuchin,\nin whose company I set out for Paris--the character of my fellow\ntraveller--on adventure on the road--I am shocked at his behaviour\n\nWhen our repast was ended, we walked down to the harbour, where we\nfound a cutter that was to sail for Deal in the evening, and Mr. Bowling\nagreed for his passage. In the meantime, we sauntered about the town\nto satisfy our curiosity, our conversation turning on the subject of my\ndesigns, which were not as yet fixed: neither can it be supposed that my\nmind was at ease, when I found myself reduced almost to extreme poverty,\nin the midst of foreigners, among whom I had not one acquaintance to\nadvise or befriend me. My uncle was sensible of my forlorn condition,\nand pressed me to accompany him to England, where he did not doubt of\nfinding some sort of provision for me; but besides the other reasons I\nhad for avoiding that kingdom, I looked upon it, at this time, as the\nworst country in the universe for a poor honest man to live in; and\ntherefore determined to remain in France, at all events.\n\nI was confirmed in this resolution by a reverend priest, who, passing by\nat this time, and overhearing us speak English, accosted us in the same\nlanguage, telling us he was our countryman, and wishing it might be in\nhis power to do us any service. We thanked this grave person for his\ncourteous offer, and invited him to drink a glass with us, which he did\nnot think proper to refuse, and we went altogether into a tavern of\nhis recommending. After having drunk to our healths in a bumper of good\nBurgundy, he began to inquire into our situation, particularly the\nplace of our nativity, which we no sooner named than he started up, and,\nwringing our hands with great fervour, shed a flood of tears, crying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI come from the same part of the country! perhaps you are my own\nrelations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was on my guard against his caresses, which I suspected\nvery much, when I remembered the adventure of the money-dropper; but,\nwithout any appearance of diffidence, observed, that, as he was born\nin that part of the country, he must certainly know our families, which\n(howsoever mean our present appearance might be) were none of the most\nobscure or inconsiderable. Then I discovered our names, to which I\nfound he was no stranger; he had known my grandfather personally; and,\nnotwithstanding an absence of fifty years from Scotland, recounted so\nmany particulars of the families in the neighbourhood, that my scruples\nwere entirely removed, and I thought myself happy in his acquaintance.\nIn the course of our conversation, I disclosed my condition without\nreserve, and displayed my talents to such advantage, that the old father\nlooked upon me with admiration, and assured me, that, if I stayed in\nFrance, and listened to reason, I could not fail of making my fortune,\nto which he would contribute all in his power.\n\nMy uncle began to be jealous of the Priest's insinuation, and very\nabruptly declared, that if ever I should renounce my religion, he would\nbreak off all connection and correspondence with me; for it was his\nopinion, that no honest man would swerve from his principles in which he\nwas bred, whether Turkish, Protestant, or Roman. The father, affronted\nat this declaration, with great vehemence began a long discourse,\nsetting forth the danger of obstinacy, and shutting one's eyes\nagainst the light. He said, that ignorance would be no plea towards\njustification, when we had opportunities of being better informed;\nand, that, if the minds of people had not been open to conviction, the\nChristian religion could not have been propagated in the world, and we\nshould now be in a state of Pagan darkness and barbarity: he endeavoured\nto prove, by some texts of Scripture and many quotations from the\nFathers, that the Pope was the successor of St. Peter, and vicar of\nJesus Christ; that the church of Rome was the true, holy, catholic\nchurch; and that the Protestant faith was an impious heresy and damnable\nschism, by which many millions of souls would suffer everlasting\nperdition. When he had finished his sermon, which I thought he\npronounced with more zeal than discretion, he addressed himself to\nmy uncle, desired to know his objections to what had been said. The\nlieutenant, whose attention had been wholly engrossed by his own\naffairs, took the pipe out of his mouth, and replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for me,\nfriend, d'ye see, I have no objection to what you say; it may be either\ntruth or false, for what I know; I meddle with nobody's affairs but my\nown; the gunner to his linstock, and the steersman to the helm, as the\nsaying is. I trust to no creed but the compass, and do unto every man\nas I would be done by; so that I defy the Pope, the Devil, and the\nPretender; and hope to be saved as well as another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This association\nof persons gave great offence to the friar, who protested, in a mighty\npassion, that if Mr. Bowling had not been his countryman, he would have\ncaused him to be imprisoned for his insolence; I ventured to disapprove\nof my uncle's rashness, and appeased the old gentleman, by assuring him\nthere was no offence intended by my kinsman, who, by this time sensible\nof his error, shook the injured party by the hand, and asked pardon for\nthe freedom he had taken. Matters being amicably compromised, he invited\nus to come and see him in the afternoon at the convent to which he\nbelonged, and took his leave for the present; when my uncle recommended\nit strongly to me to persevere in the religion of my forefathers,\nwhatever advantages might propose to myself by a change, which could not\nfail of disgracing myself, and dishonouring my family. I assured him no\nconsideration would induce me to forfeit his friendship and good opinion\non that score; at which assurance he discovered great satisfaction, and\nput me in mind of dinner, which we immediately bespoke, and when it was\nready, ate together.\n\nI imagined my acquaintance with the Scottish priest if properly managed,\nmight turn out to my advantage, and therefore resolved to cultivate\nit as much as I could. With this view we visited him at his convent,\naccording to his invitation, where he treated us with wine and\nsweetmeats, and showed us everything that was remarkable in the\nmonastery. Having been thus entertained, we took our leave, though not\nbefore I had promised to see him next day, and the time fixed for my\nuncle's embarking being come, I accompanied him to the harbour, and saw\nhim on board. We parted not without tears, after we had embraced and\nwished one another all manner of prosperity: and he entreated me to\nwrite to him often, directing to Lieutenant Bowling, at the sign of the\nUnion Flag, near the Hermitage, London.\n\nI returned to the house in which we had met, where I passed the night\nin a very solitary manner, reflecting on the severity of my fate, and\nendeavouring to project some likely scheme of life for the future; but\nmy invention failed me; I saw nothing but insurmountable difficulties in\nmy way, and was ready to despair at the miserable prospect! That I might\nnot, however, neglect any probable reason, I got up in the morning, and\nwent directly to the father, whose advice and assistance I implored. He\nreceived me very kindly, and gave me to understand, that there was one\nway of life in which a person of my talents could not fail of making a\ngreat figure. I guessed his meaning, and told him, once for all, I was\nfully determined against any alteration in point of religion; therefore\nif his proposal regarded the church, he might save himself the trouble\nof explaining it. He shook his head and sighed, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! son, son,\nwhat a glorious prospect is here spoiled by your stubborn prejudice!\nSuffer yourself to be persuaded by reason, and consult your temporal\nwelfare, as well as the concerns of your eternal soul. I can, by my\ninterest procure your admission as a noviciate to this convent, where I\nwill superintend and direct you with a truly paternal affection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then\nhe launched out into the praises of a monastic life, which no noise\ndisturbs, no cares molest, and no danger invades--where the heart\nis weaned from carnal attachments, the grosser appetite subdued and\nchastised, and the soul wafted to divine regions of philosophy and\ntruth, on the wing of studious contemplation. But his eloquence was lost\nupon me, whom two considerations enabled to withstand his temptation;\nnamely, my promise to my uncle, and my aversion to an ecclesiastical\nlife; for as to the difference of religion, I looked upon it as a thing\nof too small moment to come in competition with a man's fortune. Finding\nme immovable on this head, he told me, he was more sorry than offended\nat my noncompliance, and still ready to employ his good offices in\nmy behalf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same erroneous maxims,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat obstruct your\npromotion in the church, will infallibly prevent your advancement in the\narmy; but, if you can brook the condition of a servant, I am acquainted\nwith some people of rank at Versailles, to whom I can give you letters\nof recommendation, that you may be entertained by some one of them in\nquality of maitre d'hotel; and I do not doubt that your qualifications\nwill soon entitle you to a better provision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I embraced his offer with\ngreat eagerness, and he appointed me to come back in the afternoon,\nwhen he would not only give me letters, but likewise introduce me to\na capuchin of his acquaintance, who intended to set out for Paris next\nmorning in whose company I might travel, without being at the expense\nof one livre during the whole journey. This piece of good news gave me\ninfinite pleasure; I acknowledged my obligation to the benevolent father\nin the most grateful expressions; and he performed his promise to a\ntittle, in delivering the letters, and making me acquainted with the\ncapuchin, with whom I departed next morning by break of day.\n\nIt was not long before I discovered my fellow traveller to be a merry\nfacetious fellow, who, notwithstanding his profession and appearance of\nmortification, loved good eating and drinking better than his rosary,\nand paid more adoration to a pretty girl than to the Virgin Mary, or St.\nGenevieve. He was a thick brawny young man, with red eyebrows, a hook\nnose, a face covered with freckles; and his name was Frere Balthazar.\nHis order did not permit him to wear linen, so that, having little\noccasion to undress himself, he was none of the cleanliest animals in\nthe world; and his constitution was naturally so strongly scented that\nI always thought it convenient to keep to the windward of him in our\nmarch. As he was perfectly well known on the road, we fared sumptuously\nwithout any cost, and the fatigue of our journey was much alleviated by\nthe good humour of my companion, who sang an infinite number of catches\non the subjects of love and wine. We took up our lodging the first night\nat a peasant's house not far from Abbeville, where we were entertained\nwith an excellent ragout, cooked by our landlord's daughters, one\nof whom was very handsome. After having eaten heartily and drank a\nsufficient quantity of small wine, we were conducted to a barn, where we\nfound a couple of carpets spread upon clean straw for our reception.\nWe had not lain in this situation above half-an-hour, when we heard\nsomebody knock softly at the door, upon which Balthazar got up, and\nlet in our host's two daughters, who wanted to have some private\nconversation with him in the dark. When they had whispered together some\ntime, the capuchin came to me, and asked if I was insensible to love,\nand so hard-hearted as to refuse a share of my bed to a pretty maid who\nhad a tendre for me? I must own to my shame, that I suffered myself to\nbe overcome by my passion, and with great eagerness seized the occasion,\nwhen I understood that the amiable Nanette was to be my bedfellow. In\nvain did my reason suggest the respect that I owed to my dear mistress\nNarcissa; the idea of that lovely charmer rather increased than allayed\nthe ferment of my spirits; and the young paysanne had no reason to\ncomplain of my remembrance. Early in the morning, the kind creatures\nleft us to our repose, which lasted till eight o'clock when we got up,\nand were treated at breakfast with chocolate and l'eau-de-vie by our\nparamours, of whom we took a tender leave, after my companion had\nconfessed and given them absolution.\n\nWhile we proceeded on our journey, the conversation turned upon the\nnight's adventure, being introduced by the capuchin, who asked me how I\nliked my lodging; I declared my satisfaction, and talked in rapture of\nthe agreeable Nanette, at which he shook his head, and smiling said, she\nwas a morceau pour la bonne bouche. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never valued myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cupon anything so much as the conquest of Nanette; and, vanity\napart, I have been pretty fortunate in my amours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This information\nshocked me not a little, as I was well convinced of his intimacy with\nher sister; and though I did not care to tax him with downright\nincest, I professed my astonishment at his last night's choice, when, I\nsupposed, the other was at his devotion. To this hint he answered that,\nbesides his natural complaisance to the sex, he had another reason to\ndistribute his favours equally between them, namely, to preserve peace\nin the family, which could not otherwise be maintained; that, moreover,\nNanette had conceived an affection for me, and he loved her too well\nto balk her inclination; more especially, when he had an opportunity of\nobliging his friend at the same time. I thanked him for this instance\nof his friendship, though I was extremely disgusted at his want of\ndelicacy, and cursed the occasion that threw me in his way. Libertine as\nI was, I could not bear to see a man behave so wide of the character he\nassumed. I looked upon him as a person of very little worth or honesty,\nand should even have kept a wary eye upon my pocket, if I had thought he\ncould have had any temptation to steal. But I could not conceive the use\nof money to a capuchin, who is obliged, by the rules of his order, to\nappear like a beggar, and enjoy all other necessaries of life gratis;\nbesides, my fellow traveller seemed to be of a complexion too careless\nand sanguine to give me any apprehension on that score; so that I\nproceeded with great confidence, in expectation of being soon at my\njourney's end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nWe lodge at a House near Amiens, where I am robbed by the Capuchin, who\nescapes while I am asleep--I go to Noyons in search of him, but\nwithout Success--make my Condition known to several People, but find\nno Relief--grow desperate--find a Company of Soldiers--Enlist in the\nRegiment of Picardy--we are ordered into Germany--I find the Fatigues of\nthe March almost intolerable--Quarrel with my Comrade in a dispute about\nPolitics--he challenges me to the Field--wounds and disarms me\n\nThe third night of our pilgrimage we passed at a house near Amiens,\nwhere being unknown, we supped upon indifferent fare and sour wine, and\nwere fain to be in a garret upon an old mattress, which, I believe had\nbeen in the possession of ten thousand myriads of fleas time out of\nmind. We did not invade their territory with impunity; in less than\na minute we were attacked by stings innumerable, in spite of which,\nhowever, I fell fast asleep, being excessively fatigued with our day's\nmarch, and did not wake till nine next morning, when, seeing myself\nalone, I started up in a terrible fright, and, examining my pockets,\nfound my presaging fear too true! My companion had made free with my\ncash, and left me to seek my way to Paris by myself! I ran down stairs\nimmediately; and, with a look full of grief and amazement, inquired for\nthe mendicant, who, they gave me to understand, had set out four hours\nbefore, after having told them I was a little indisposed, and desired I\nmight not be disturbed, but be informed when I should wake, that he had\ntaken the road to Noyons, where he would wait for my coming, at the Coq\nd'Or. I spoke not a word, but with a heavy heart directed my course to\nthat place, at which I arrived in the afternoon, fainting with weariness\nand hunger; but learned to my utter confusion, that no such person had\nbeen there! It was happy for me that I had a good deal of resentment\nin my constitution, which animated me on such occasions against the\nvillainy of mankind, and enabled me to bear misfortunes, otherwise\nintolerable. Boiling with indignation, I discovered to the host my\ndeplorable condition, and inveighed with great bitterness against the\ntreachery of Balthazar; at which he shrugged up his shoulders, and\nwith a peculiar grimace on his countenance, said, he was sorry for my\nmisfortune, but there was no remedy like patience. At that instant some\nguests arrived, to whom he hastened to offer his service, leaving me\nmortified at his indifference, and fully persuaded that an innkeeper is\nthe same sordid animal all the world over.\n\nWhile I stood in the porch forlorn and undetermined, venting\nejaculations of curses against the thief who had robbed me, and the old\npriest who recommended him to my friendship, a young gentleman richly\ndressed, attended by a valet de chambre and two servants in livery,\narrived at the inn. I thought I perceived a great deal of sweetness and\ngood-nature in his countenance; therefore he had no sooner alighted than\nI accosted him, and, in a few words, explained my situation: he listened\nwith great politeness, and, when I made an end of my story, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nmonsieur, what would you have me to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was effectually abashed\nat this interrogation, which, I believe, no man of common sense or\ngenerosity could make, and made no other compliment than a low bow:\nhe returned the compliment still lower, and tripped into an apartment,\nwhile the landlord let me know that my standing there to interrupt\ncompany gave offence, and might do him infinite prejudice. He had no\noccasion to repeat his insinuation; I moved from the place immediately,\nand was so much transported with grief, anger, and disdain, that a\ntorrent of blood gushed from my nostrils. In this ecstacy, I quitted\nNoyons, and betook myself to the fields, where I wandered about like one\ndistracted, till my spirits were quite exhausted, and I was obliged to\nthrow myself down at the root of a tree, to rest my wearied limbs. Here\nmy rage forsook me: I began to feel the importunate cravings of nature,\nand relapsed into silent sorrow and melancholy reflection. I revolved\nall the crimes I had been guilty of and found them too few and venial,\nthat I could not comprehend the justice of that Providence, which, after\nhaving exposed me to so much wretchedness and danger, left me a prey\nto famine at last in a foreign country, where I had not one friend or\nacquaintance to close my eyes, and do the last offices of humanity to my\nmiserable carcass. A thousand times I wished myself a bear, that I might\nretreat to woods and deserts, far from the inhospitable haunts of man,\nwhere I could live by my own talents, independent of treacherous friends\nand supercilious scorn.\n\nAs I lay in this manner, groaning over my hapless fate, I heard the\nsound of a violin, and raising my head, perceived a company of men and\nwomen dancing on the grass at some distance from me. I looked upon this\nto be a favourable season for distress to attract compassion, when every\nselfish thought is banished, and the heart dilated with mirth and social\njoy; wherefore I got up, and approached those happy people, whom I soon\ndiscovered to be a party of soldiers, with their wives and children,\nunbending and diverting themselves at this rate, after the fatigue of\na march. I had never before seen such a parcel of scarecrows together,\nneither could I reconcile their meagre and gaunt looks, their squalid\nand ragged attire, and every other external symptom of extreme woe, with\nthis appearance of festivity. I saluted them, however, and was received\nwith great politeness; after which they formed a ring, and danced around\nme. This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my spirits. I was infected\nwith their gaiety, and in spite of my dismal situation, forgot my cares,\nand joined in their extravagance. When we had recreated ourselves a good\nwhile at this diversion, the ladies spread their manteaus on the ground,\nupon which they emptied their knapsacks of some onions, coarse bread,\nand a few flasks of poor wine: being invited to a share of the banquet,\nI sat down with the rest, and, in the whole course of my life, never\nmade a more comfortable meal. When our repast was ended, we got up\nagain to dance, and, now that I found myself refreshed I behaved to the\nadmiration of everybody; I was loaded with a thousand compliments and\nprofessions of friendship: the men commended my person and agility, and\nthe women were loud in the praise of my bonne grace; the sergeant in\nparticular expressed so much regard for me, and described the pleasures\nof a soldier's life to me with so much art, that I began to listen to\nhis proposal of enlisting me in the service; and the more I considered\nmy own condition, the more I was convinced of the necessity I was under\nto come to a speedy determination.\n\nHaving, therefore, maturely weighed the circumstances pro and con I\nsignified my consent, and was admitted into the regiment of Picardy,\nsaid to be the oldest corps in Europe. The company to which this\ncommander belonged was quartered at a village not far off, whither we\nmarched next day, and I was presented to my captain, who seemed very\nwell pleased with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and ordered\nme to be accommodated with clothes, arms, and accoutrements. Then I sold\nmy livery suit, purchased linen, and, as I was at great pains to learn\nthe exercise, in a very short time became a complete soldier.\n\nIt was not long before we received orders to join several more\nregiments, and march with all expedition into Germany, in order to\nreinforce Mareschal Duc de Noailles, who was then encamped with his army\non the side of the river Mayne, to watch the motions of the English,\nHanoverians, Austrians, and Hessians, under the command of the Earl of\nStair. We began our march accordingly, and then I became acquainted with\nthat part of a soldier's life to which I had been hitherto a stranger.\nIt is impossible to describe the hunger and thirst I sustained, and the\nfatigue I underwent in a march of so many hundred miles; during which, I\nwas so much chafed with the heat and motion of my limbs, that in a very\nshort time the inside of my thighs and legs were deprived of skin, and I\nproceeded in the utmost torture. This misfortune I owed to the plumpness\nof my constitution, which I cursed, and envied the withered condition\nof my comrades, whose bodies could not spare juice enough to supply a\ncommon issue, and were indeed proof against all manner of friction. The\ncontinual pain I felt made me fretful, and my peevishness was increased\nby the mortification of my pride in seeing those miserable wretches,\nwhom a hard gale of wind would have scattered through the air like\nchaff, bear those toils with alacrity under which I was ready to sink.\n\nOne day, while we enjoyed a halt, and the soldiers with their wives had\ngone out to dance, according to custom, my comrade stayed at home\nwith me on pretence of friendship, and insulted me with his pity and\nconsolation! He told me that, though I was young and tender at present,\nI should soon be seasoned to the service; and he did not doubt but I\nshould have the honour to contribute in some measure to the glory of\nthe king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave courage, therefore, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand pray to the\ngood God, that you may be as happy as I am, who have had the honour of\nserving Louis the Great, and of receiving many wounds, in helping to\nestablish his glory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I looked upon the contemptible object that\npronounced these words, I was amazed at the infatuation that possessed\nhim; and could not help expressing my astonishment at the absurdity of\na rational who thinks himself highly honoured, in being permitted to\nencounter abject poverty, oppression, famine, disease, mutilation, and\nevident death merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince, by\nwhom his sufferings were disregarded, and his name utterly unknown. I\nobserved that, if his situation were the consequence of compulsion, I\nwould praise his patience and fortitude in bearing his lot: if he had\ntaken up arms in defence of his injured country, he was to be applauded\nfor his patriotism: or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge\nfrom a greater evil, he was justifiable in his own conscience (though\nI could have no notion of misery more extreme than he suffered); but\nto put his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his\nprince, was no more than professing himself a desperate slave, who\nvoluntarily underwent the utmost wretchedness and peril, and\ncommitted the most flagrant crimes, to soothe the barbarous pride of a\nfellow-creature, his superior in nothing but the power he derived\nfrom the submission of such wretches as him. The soldier was very much\naffronted at the liberty I took with his king, which, he said, nothing\nbut my ignorance could excuse: he affirmed that the characters of\nprinces were sacred, and ought not to be profaned by the censure\nof their subjects, who were bound by their allegiance to obey their\ncommands, of what nature soever, without scruple or repining; and\nadvised me to correct the rebellious principles I had imbibed among the\nEnglish, who, for their insolence to their kings, were notorious all\nover the world, even to a proverb.\n\nIn vindication of my countrymen, I repeated all the arguments commonly\nused to prove that every man has a natural right to liberty; that\nallegiance and protection are reciprocal; that, when the mutual tie is\nbroken by the tyranny of the king, he is accountable to the people for\nhis breach of contract, and subject to the penalties of the law; and\nthat those insurrections of the English, which are branded with the\nname of rebellion by the slaves of arbitrary power, were no other than\nglorious efforts to rescue that independence which was their birthright,\nfrom the ravenous claws of usurping ambition. The Frenchman, provoked at\nthe little deference I paid to the kingly name, lost all patience, and\nreproached me in such a manner that my temper forsook me, I clenched my\nfist, with an intention to give him a hearty box on the ear. Perceiving\nmy design, he started back and demanded a parley; upon which I checked\nmy indignation, and he gave me to understand that a Frenchman never\nforgave a blow; therefore, if I were not weary of my life, I would do\nwell to spare him that mortification, and do him the honour of measuring\nhis sword with mine, like a gentleman. I took his advice and followed\nhim to a field hard by, where indeed I was ashamed at the pitiful figure\nof my antagonist, who was a poor little shivering creature, decrepit\nwith age, and blind of one eye. But I soon found the folly of judging\nfrom appearances; being at the second pass wounded in the sword hand,\nand immediately disarmed with such a jerk, that I thought the joint\nwas dislocated. I was no less confounded than enraged at this event,\nespecially as my adversary did not bear his success with all the\nmoderation that might have been expected; for he insisted upon my asking\npardon for affronting his king and him. This proposal I would by no\nmeans comply with, but told him, it was a mean condescension, which no\ngentleman in his circumstances ought to propose, nor any in my situation\nought to perform; and that, if he persisted in his ungenerous demand,\nI would in my turn claim satisfaction with my musket, when we should be\nmore upon a par than with the sword, of which he seemed so much master.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nIn order to be revenged, I learn the Science of Defence--we join\nMareschal Duc de Noailles, are engaged with the Allies of Dettingen, and\nput to flight--the behaviour of the French soldiers on that occasion--I\nindustriously seek another combat with the old Gascon, and vanquish him\nin my turn--our regiment is put into Winter Quarters at Rheims, where\nI find my friend Strap--our Recognition--he supplies me with Money, and\nprocures my Discharge--we take a trip to Paris; from whence, by the way\nof Flanders, we set out for London; where we safely arrive\n\nHe was disconcerted at this declaration, to which he made no reply, but\nrepaired to the dancers, among whom he recounted his victory with many\nexaggerations and gasconades; while I, taking up my sword, went to my\nquarters, and examined my wound, which I found was of no consequence.\nThe same day an Irish drummer, having heard of my misfortune, visited\nme, and after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to\nunderstand, that he was master of the sword, and would in a very short\ntime instruct me so thoroughly in that noble science, that I should be\nable to chastise the old Gascon for his insolent boasting at my expense.\nThis friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he had for\nhis countrymen; but I afterwards learned the true motive was no other\nthan a jealousy he entertained of a correspondence between the Frenchman\nand his wife, which he did not think proper to resent in person. Be this\nas it will, I accepted his offer and practised his lessons with such\napplication, that I soon believed myself a match for my conqueror.\nIn the meantime we continued our march, and arrived at the Camp\nof Mareschal Noailles the night before the battle at Dettingen:\nnotwithstanding the fatigue we had undergone, our regiment was one of\nthose that were ordered next day to cross the river, under the command\nof the Duc de Grammont, to take possession of a narrow defile, through\nwhich the allies must of necessity have passed at a great disadvantage,\nor remain where they were, and perish for want of provision, if they\nwould not condescend to surrender at discretion. How they suffered\nthemselves to be pent up in this manner it is not my province to relate;\nI shall only observe that, when we had taken possession of our ground, I\nheard an old officer in conversation with another express a surprise at\nthe conduct of Lord Stair, who had the reputation of a good general. But\nit seems, at this time, that nobleman was overruled, and only acted in\nan inferior character; so that no part of the blame could be imputed\nto him, who declared his disapprobation of the step, in consequence of\nwhich the whole army was in the utmost danger; but Providence or destiny\nacted miracles in their behalf, by disposing the Duc de Grammont to quit\nhis advantageous post, pass the defile, and attack the English, who were\ndrawn up in order of battle on the plain, and who handled us so roughly\nthat, after having lost a great number of men, we turned our backs\nwithout ceremony, and fled with such precipitation that many hundreds\nperished in the river through pure fear and confusion: for the enemy\nwere so generous that they did not pursue us one inch of ground; and,\nif our consternation would have permitted, we might have retreated with\ngreat order and deliberation. But, notwithstanding the royal clemency\nof the king of Great Britain, who headed the allies in person, and, no\ndoubt, put a stop to the carnage, our loss amounted to five thousand\nmen, among whom were many officers of distinction. Our miscarriage\nopened a passage for the foe to Haynau, whither they immediately\nmarched, leaving their sick and wounded to the care of the French, who\nnext day took possession of the field of battle, buried the dead, and\ntreated the living with humanity.\n\nThis circumstance was a great consolation to us, who thence took\noccasion to claim the victory; and the genius of the French nation never\nappeared more conspicuous than now, in the rhodomontades they uttered\non the subject of their generosity and courage. Every man (by his own\naccount) performed feats that eclipsed all the heroes of antiquity.\nOne compared himself to a lion retiring at leisure from his cowardly\npursuers, who keep at a wary distance, and gall him with their darts.\nAnother likened himself to a bear that retreats with his face to the\nenemy, who dare not assail him; and the third assumed the character of a\ndesperate stag, that turns upon the hounds and keeps them at bay. There\nwas not a private soldier engaged who had not by the prowess of his\nsingle arm demolished a whole platoon, or put a squadron of horse to\nflight; and, among others, the meagre Gascon extolled his exploits above\nthose of Hercules or Charlemagne. As I still retained my resentment for\nthe disgrace I suffered in my last rencontre with him, and, now that I\nthe thought myself qualified, longed for an opportunity to retrieve my\nhonour, I magnified the valour of the English with all the hyperboles I\ncould imagine, and described the pusillanimity of the French in the same\nstyle, comparing them to hares flying before greyhounds, or mice pursued\nby cats; and passed an ironical compliment on the speed he exerted\nin his flight, which, considering his age and infirmities I said was\nsurprising. He was stung to the quick by this sarcasm, and, with an air\nof threatening disdain, bade me know myself better, and remember the\ncorrection I had already received from him for my insolence; for he\nmight not always be in the humour of sparing a wretch who abused his\ngoodness. To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick on the breech,\nwhich overturned him in an instant. He started up with wonderful\nagility, and, drawing his sword, attacked me with great fury. Several\npeople interposed, but, when he informed them of its being an affair of\nhonour, they retired, and left us to decide the battle by ourselves.\nI sustained his onset with little damage, having only received a small\nscratch on my right shoulder, and, seeing his breath and vigour almost\nexhausted, assaulted him in my turn, closed with him, and wrested his\nsword out of his hand in the struggle. Having thus acquired the victory,\nI desired him to beg his life; to which demand he made no answer, but\nshrugged up his shoulders to his ears, expanded his hands, elevated\nthe skin on his forehead and eyebrows, and depressed the corners of his\nmouth in such a manner, that I could scarce refrain from laughing aloud\nat his grotesque appearance. That I might, however, mortify his vanity,\nwhich triumphed without bounds over my misfortune, I thrust his sword up\nto the hilt in something (it was not a tansy), that lay smoking on the\nplain, and joined the rest of the soldiers with an air of tranquillity\nand indifference.\n\nThere was nothing more of moment attempted by either of the armies\nduring the remaining part of the campaign, which being ended, the\nEnglish marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached\nto French Flanders, and our regiment ordered into winter quarters in\nChampagne. It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now\nbelonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found myself in the utmost want\nof everything, my pay, which amounted to five sols a day, far from\nsupplying me with necessaries, being scarce sufficient to procure a\nwretched subsistence to keep soul and body together; so that I was,\nby hunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my\nfellow-soldiers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable shirts to\ntwo pair of sleeves and necks, the bodies having been long ago converted\ninto spatterdaches; and after all, I was better provided than any\nprivate man in the regiment. In this urgency of my affairs, I wrote to\nmy uncle in England, though my hopes from that quarter were not at all\nsanguine, for the reasons I have already explained; and in the meantime\nhad recourse to my old remedy patience, consoling myself with the\nflattering suggestions of a lively imagination, that never abandoned me\nin my distress.\n\nOne day, while I stood sentinel at the gate of a general officer, a\ncertain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning,\nto whom, at parting, I heard him say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may depend upon my good\noffices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This assurance was answered by a low bow of the person\nin black, who, turning to go away, discovered to me the individual\ncountenance of my old friend and adherent Strap. I was so much\nastonished at the sight, that I lost the power of utterance, and, before\nI could recollect myself, he was gone without taking any notice of me.\nIndeed, had he stayed, I scarcely should have ventured to accost him;\nbecause, though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features of his\nface, I could not be positively certain as to the rest of his person,\nwhich was very much altered for the better since he left me at London,\nneither could I conceive by which means he was enabled to appear in the\nsphere of a gentleman, to which, while I knew him, he had not even\nthe ambition to aspire. But I was too much concerned in the affair to\nneglect further information, and therefore took the first opportunity\nof asking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the marquis spoke.\nThe Swiss told me his name was Monsieur d'Estrapes, that he had been\nvalet-de-chambre to an English gentleman lately deceased, and that he\nwas very much regarded by the marquis for his fidelity to his master,\nbetween whom and that nobleman a very intimate friendship had subsisted.\nNothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence,\nwhich banished all doubt of its being my friend, who had found means to\nfrenchify his name as well as his behaviour since we parted. As soon,\ntherefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodging, according to a\ndirection given me by the Swiss, and had the good fortune to find him\nat home. That I might surprise him the more, I concealed my name and\nbusiness, and only desired the servant of the house to tell Monsieur\nd'Estrapes that I begged the honour of half-an-hour's conversation with\nhim. He was confounded and dismayed at this message, when he understood\nit was sent by a soldier; though he was conscious to himself of no\ncrime, all that he had heard of the Bastille appeared to his\nimagination with aggravated horror, but it was not before I had waited a\nconsiderable time that he had resolution enough to bid the servant show\nme up-stairs.\n\nWhen I entered his chamber, he returned my bow with great civility,\nand endeavoured, with forced complaisance, to disguise his fear, which\nappeared in the paleness of his face, the wildness of his looks, and\nthe shaking of his limbs. I was diverted at his consternation, which\nredoubled, when I told him in French, I had business for his private ear\nand demanded a particular audience. The valet being withdrawn, I asked\nin the same language if his name was d'Estrapes, to which he answered\nwith a faltering tongue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same, at your service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you a\nFrenchman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not the honour of being a Frenchman born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have an infinite veneration for the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I then\ndesired he would do me the honour to look at me, which he no sooner did\nthan, struck with my appearance, he started back, and cried in\nEnglish, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Jesus!--sure it can't! No 'tis impossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I smiled at his\ninterjections, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you are too much of a gentleman to own\nyour friend in adversity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When he heard me pronounce these words in\nour own language, he leaped upon me in a transport of joy, hung about\nmy neck, kissed me from ear to ear, and blubbered like a great schoolboy\nwho had been whipped. Then, observing my dress, he set up his throat,\ncrying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Lord! O Lord! that ever I should live to see my dearest\nfriend reduced to the condition of a foot soldier in the French service!\nWhy did you consent to my leaving you?--but I know the reason--you\nthought you had got more creditable friends, and grew ashamed of my\nacquaintance. Ah! Lord help us! though I was a little short-sighted, I\nwas not altogether blind: and though I did not complain, I was not the\nless sensible of your unkindness, which was indeed the only thing that\ninduced me to ramble abroad, the Lord knows whither; but I must own\nit has been a lucky ramble for me, and so I forgive you, and may God\nforgive you! O Lord! Lord! is it come to this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was nettled at the\ncharge, which, though just, I could not help thinking unseasonable, and\ntold him with some tartness that, whether his suspicions were well or\nill grounded, he might have chosen a more convenient opportunity of\nintroducing them; and that the question now was whether or no he found\nhimself disposed to lend me any assistance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisposed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he with\ngreat emotion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you had known me so well as to assure yourself\nwithout asking, that I, and all that belongs to me, are at your command.\nIn the meantime you shall dine with me, and I will tell you something\nthat, perhaps, will not be displeasing unto you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, wringing my\nhand, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes my heart bleed to see you in that garb!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n I thanked him for his invitation, which, I observed, could not be\nunwelcome to a person who had not eaten a comfortable meal these seven\nmonths; but I had another request to make, which I begged he would grant\nbefore dinner, and that was the loan of a shirt; for although my back\nhad been many weeks a stranger to any comfort of that kind, my skin was\nnot yet familiarised to the want of it. He stared in my face, with a\nwoful countenance, at this declaration, which he could scarce believe,\nuntil I explained it by unbuttoning my coat and disclosing my naked\nbody--a circumstance which shocked the tender-hearted Strap, who, with\ntears in his eyes, ran to a chest of drawers, and taking out some linen,\npresented to me a very fine ruffled Holland shirt and cambric neckcloth,\nassuring me he had three dozen of the same kind at my service.\n\nI was ravished at this piece of good news and, having accommodated\nmyself in a moment, hugged my benefactor for his generous offer, saying,\nI was overjoyed to find him undebauched by prosperity, which seldom\nfails to corrupt the heart. He bespoke for dinner some soup and bouilli,\na couple of pullets roasted, and a dish of asparagus, and in the\ninterim entertained me with biscuit and Burgundy, after which repast he\nentreated me to gratify his longing desire of knowing every circumstance\nof my fortune since his departure from London. This request I complied\nwith, beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and relating every particular\nevent in which I had been concerned from that day to the present hour.\nDuring the recital, my friend was strongly affected, according to the\nvarious situations described. He stared with surprise, glowed with\nindignation, gaped with curiosity, smiled with pleasure, trembled with\nfear, and wept with sorrow, as the vicissitudes of my life inspired\nthese different passions; and, when my story was ended, signified his\namazement on the whole, by lifting up his eyes and hands and protesting\nthat, though I was a young man, had suffered more than all the blessed\nmartyrs.\n\nAfter dinner, I desired in my turn to know the particulars of his\nperegrination, and he satisfied me in a few words, by giving me to\nunderstand that he had lived a year at Paris with his master, who,\nin that time having acquired the language, as well as the fashionable\nexercises to perfection, made a tour of France and Holland, during\nwhich excursion he was so unfortunate as to meet with three of his\nown countrymen on their travels, in whose company he committed such\nexcesses, that his constitution failed, and he fell into a consumption;\nthat by the advice of physicians, he went to Montpelier for the benefit\nof good air, and recovered so well in six weeks, that he returned to\nRheims seemingly in good health, where he had not continued above a\nmonth, when he was seized with a looseness that carried him off in ten\ndays, to the unspeakable sorrow of all who knew him and especially\nof Strap, who had been very happy in his service, and given such\nsatisfaction, that his master, on his death-bed recommended him\nto several persons of distinction for his diligence, sobriety, and\naffection, and left him by will his wearing apparel, gold watch, sword,\nrings, ready money, and all the moveables he had in France, to the value\nof three hundred pounds \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich I now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the sight of God and\nman, surrender to your absolute disposal: here are my keys; take them,\nI beseech you, and God give you joy of the possession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d My brain was\nalmost turned by this sudden change of fortune, which I could scarce\nbelieve real: however, I positively refused this extravagant proffer of\nmy friend, and put him in mind of my being a soldier; at which hint he\nstarted, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdso! that's true! we must procure your discharge. I\nhave some interest with a nobleman who is able to do me that favour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe consulted about this affair, and it was determined that Monsieur\nd'Estrapes should wait upon the Marquis in the morning, and tell him he\nhad by accident found his brother, whom he had not seen for many years\nbefore, a private soldier in the regiment of Picardy, and implore that\nnobleman's interest for his discharge. In the meantime, we enjoyed\nourselves over a bottle of good Burgundy, and spent the evening in\nconcerting schemes for our future conduct, in case I should be so lucky\nas to get rid of the army. The business was to make ourselves easy for\nlife by means of his legacy, a task very difficult, and, in the usual\nmethods of laying out money, altogether impracticable, so that, after\nmuch canvassing, we could come to no resolution that night, but when we\nparted, recommended the matter to the serious attention of each other.\nAs for my own part, I puzzled my imagination to no purpose. When I\nthought of turning merchant, the smallness of our stock, and the risk\nof seas, enemies, and markets, deterred me from that scheme. If I should\nsettle as a surgeon in my own country, I would find the business already\noverstocked; or, if I pretended to set up in England, must labour under\nwant of friends and powerful opposition, obstacles insurmountable by the\nmost shining merit: neither should I succeed in my endeavours to rise in\nthe state, inasmuch as I could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers,\nnor prostitute my pen in defence of a wicked and contemptible\nadministration. Before I could form any feasible project, I fell asleep,\nand my fancy was blest with the image of the dear Narcissa, who seemed\nto smile upon my passion, and offer her hand as a reward for all my\ntoils.\n\nEarly in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I\nfound exulting over his happy invention! for I no sooner entered his\napartment, than he addressed himself to me in these words, with a smile\nof self-applause: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a\nfool's head sometimes. I have hit it--I'll hold you a button my plan\nis better than yours, for all your learning. But you shall have the\npreference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let\nus know the effects of your meditation; and then I will impart my own\nsimple excogitations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him, that not one thought had occurred to\nme which deserved the least notice, and signified my impatience to be\nacquainted with the fruits of his reflection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we have not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmoney sufficient to maintain us during a tedious expectation, it is\nmy opinion that a bold push must be made; and I see none so likely to\nsucceed as your appearing in the character of a gentleman (which is your\ndue), and making your addresses to some lady of fortune, who can render\nyou independent at once. Nay, don't stare--I affirm that this scheme\nis both prudent and honourable; for I would not have you throw yourself\naway upon an old toothless wheezing dame, whose breath would stink you\ninto a consumption in less than three months, neither would I advise\nyou to assume the character of a wealthy squire, as your common\nfortune-hunters do, by which means many a poor lady is cheated into\nmatrimony, and instead of enjoying the pomp and grandeur that was\npromised, sees her dowry seized by her husband's rapacious creditors,\nand herself reduced to misery and despair. No, I know you have a soul\nthat disdains such imposition; and are master of qualifications, both\nof mind and body, which alone entitle you to a match that will set you\nabove the world. I have clothes in my possession that a duke need not be\nashamed to wear. I believe they will fit you as they are, if not there\nare plenty of tailors in France. Let us take a short trip to Paris, and\nprovide ourselves with all other necessaries, then set out for England,\nwhere I intend to do myself the honour of attending you in quality of a\nvalet. This expedient will save you the expense of a servant, shaving,\nand dressing; and I doubt not but, by the blessing of God, we shall\nbring matters to a speedy and fortunate issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Extravagant as this\nproposal was, I listened to it with pleasure, because it flattered my\nvanity, and indulged a ridiculous hope I began to entertain of inspiring\nNarcissa with a mutual flame.\n\nAfter breakfast, Monsieur d'Estrapes went to pay his devoirs to the\nmarquis, and was so successful in his application, that I obtained a\ndischarge in a few days, upon which we set out for Paris. Here I had\ntime to reflect and congratulate myself upon this sudden transition of\nfate, which to bear with moderation required some degree of philosophy\nand self-denial. This truth will be more obvious, if I give a detail\nof the particulars, to the quiet possession of which I was raised in an\ninstant, from the most abject misery and contempt. My wardrobe consisted\nof five fashionable coats full mounted, two of which were plain, one\nof cut velvet, one trimmed with gold, and another with silver lace, two\nfrocks, one of white drab, with large plate buttons, the other of blue\nwith gold binding; one waistcoat of gold brocade; one of blue satin,\nembroidered with silver; one of green silk, trimmed with figured broad\ngold lace; one of black silk, with fringes; one of white satin, one of\nblack cloth, and one of scarlet; six pair of cloth breeches; one pair\nof crimson, and another of black velvet; twelve pair of white silk\nstockings, as many of black silk, and the same number of white cotton;\none hat, laced with gold point d'Espagne, another with silver lace\nscolloped, a third with gold binding, and a fourth plain; three dozen\nof fine ruffled shirts, as many neckcloths; one dozen of cambric\nhandkerchiefs, and the like number of silk. The other moveables, which\nI possessed by the generosity and friendship of Strap, were a gold watch\nwith a chased case, two valuable diamond rings, two mourning swords, one\nwith a silver handle, and a fourth cut steel inlaid with gold, a diamond\nstock buckle, and a set of stone buckles for the knees and shoes; a pair\nof silver-mounted pistols with rich housings; a gold-headed cane, and a\nsnuff-box of tortoiseshell, mounted with gold, having the picture of a\nlady in the top. The gentleman left many other things of value, which my\nfriend had converted into cash before I met with him; so that, over and\nabove these particulars, our stock in ready money amounted to something\nmore than two hundred pounds.\n\nThus equipped, I put on the gentleman of figure, and, attended by my\nhonest friend, who was contented with the station of my valet, visited\nthe Louvre, examined the gallery of Luxembourg, and appeared at\nVersailles, where I had the honour of seeing his Most Christian Majesty\neat a considerable quantity of olives. During the month I spent at\nParis, I went several times to court, the Italian comedy, opera,\nand playhouse, danced at a masquerade, and, in short, saw everything\nremarkable in and about that capital. Then we set out for England by the\nway of Flanders, passed through Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges, and took\nshipping at Ostend, from whence, in fourteen hours, we arrived at Deal,\nhired a postchaise, and in twelve hours more got safe to London, having\ndisposed of our heavy baggage in the waggon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nI inquire for my Uncle, and understand he is gone to sea--take Lodgings\nat Charing Cross--go to the Play, where I meet with an adventure--Dine\nat an ordinary--the Guests described--become acquainted with Medlar and\nDoctor Wagtail\n\nAs soon as we alighted at the inn, I dispatched Strap to inquire for my\nuncle at the Union Flag in Wapping; and he returned in a little time,\nwith an account of Mr. Bowling's having gone to sea, mate of a merchant\nship, after a long and unsuccessful application attendance at the\nAdmiralty; where, it seems, the interest he depended upon was not\nsufficient to reinstate him, or recover the pay that was due to him when\nhe quitted the Thunder.\n\nNext day I hired very handsome lodgings not far from Charing Cross; and\nin the evening dressed myself in a plain suit of the true Paris cut, and\nappeared in a front box at the play, where I saw a good deal of company,\nand was vain enough to believe that I was observed with an uncommon\ndegree of attention and applause. This silly conceit intoxicated me so\nmuch, that I was guilty of a thousand ridiculous coquetries; and I dare\nsay, how favourable soever the thoughts of the company might be at my\nfirst appearance, they were soon changed by my absurd behaviour into\npity or contempt. I rose and sat down, covered and uncovered my head\ntwenty times between the acts; pulled out my watch, clapped it to\nmy ear, wound it up, set it, gave it the hearing again; displayed my\nsnuff-box, affected to take snuff, that I might have all opportunity of\nshowing my brilliant, and wiped my nose with perfumed handkerchief;\nthen dangled my cane, and adjusted my sword-knot, and acted many more\nfooleries of the same kind, in hopes of obtaining the character of\na pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which I found two considerable\nobstructions in my disposition--namely, a natural reserve and jealous\nsensibility. Fain would I have entered into conversation with the people\naround me: but I was restrained by the fear of being censured for\nmy assurance, as well as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a\ncompliment of this kind from them, than they to such condescension from\na stranger like me. How often did I redden at the frequent whispers and\nloud laughter of my fellow beaux, which I imagined were excited by me;\nand how often did I envy the happy indifference of those choice spirits,\nwho behold the distress of the scene without discovering the least\nsymptom of approbation or concern. My attention was engaged in spite\nof myself, and I could not help weeping with the heroine of the stage,\nthough I practised a great many shifs to conceal this piece of unpolite\nweakness.\n\nWhen the play was ended, I sat waiting for an opportunity of handing\nsome lady to her coach; but everyone was attended by such a number of\nofficious gallants, that for a long time I was balked in my expectation.\nAt length, however, I perceived a very handsome creature, genteelly\ndressed, sitting by herself in a box, at some distance from me; upon\nwhich I went up to her, and offered my service. She seemed to be in\nsome confusion, thanked me for my complaisance, and with a tender look\ndeclined giving me the trouble: looking at her watch, and testifying her\nsurprise at the negligence of her footman whom she had ordered to have\na chair ready for her at that hour. I repeated my entreaty with all the\neloquence and compliment I was master of; and, in the event, she was\nprevailed upon to accept of a proposal I made, to send my servant for\na chair or coach: accordingly, Strap was detached for that purpose, and\nreturned without success. By this time the playhouse was quite empty,\nand we were obliged to retire. As I led her through the passage, I\nobserved five or six young fellows of fashion standing in a corner,\none of whom, as I thought, tipped my charmer the wink, and when we were\npassed, I heard a loud laugh. This note aroused my attention, and I was\nresolved to be fully satisfied of this lady's character, before I should\nhave any nearer connection with her. As no convenience appeared, I\nproposed to conduct her to a tavern, where we might stay a few minutes,\nuntil my servant could fetch a coach from the Strand. She seemed\nparticularly shy of trusting herself in a tavern with a stranger, but\nat last yielded to my pathetic remonstrances, rather than endanger\nher health by remaining in a cold, damp thoroughfare. Having thus far\nsucceeded, I begged to know what wine she would be pleased to drink a\nglass of; but she professed the greatest aversion to all sorts of strong\nliquors, and it was with much difficulty that I could persuade her to\neat a jelly.\n\nIn the meantime, I endeavoured to alleviate the uneasiness she\ndiscovered, by saying all the agreeable things I could think of; at\nwhich she would often sigh, and regard me with a languishing look, that\nseemed, however, too near akin to the lewd leer of a courtesan. This\ndiscovery added to my former suspicion, while it put me upon my guard\nagainst her arts, divested me of reserve, and enabled me to entertain\nher with gaiety and freedom. In the course of our conversation, I\npressed her to allow me the honour of waiting upon her next day at her\nlodgings, a request which she, with many apologues, refused, lest it\nshould give umbrage to Sir John, who was of a disposition apt to be\nfretted with trifles. This information, by which I was to understand\nthat her husband was a knight, did not check my addresses, which became\nmore and more importunate, and I was even hardy enough to ravish a kiss.\nBut, O heavens! instead of banqueting on the ambrosial flavour, that her\ndelicacy of complexion promised, I was almost suffocated with the steams\nof Geneva! An exhalation of this kind, from a mouth which had just\nbefore declared an utter abhorrence of all spirituous liquors, not only\nchanged my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; and it\nwould have been impossible for me to have preserved common complaisance\nfive minutes longer, when my servant returned with a coach. I took the\nadvantage of this occasion, and presented my hand to the lady, who\nput in practice against me the whole artillery of her charms, ogling,\nlanguishing, sighing, and squeezing, with so little reserve that Strap\nperceived her tenderness, and rubbed his hands with joy as he followed\nus to the door; but I was proof against all her endearments, and handed\nher into the coach with an intention to take my leave immediately. She\nguessed my design, and invited me to her house, whispering, that now Sir\nJohn was gone to bed, she could have the pleasure of my conversation for\nhalf-an-hour without interruption. I told her there was no mortification\nI would not undergo, rather than endanger the repose of her ladyship;\nand, bidding the coachman drive on, wished her a good night. She lost\nall temper at my indifference, and, stopping the coach, at the distance\nof about twenty yards from me, popped out her head, and howled with the\nlungs of a fishwoman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n you, you dog, won't you pay the coach-hire?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n As I made no answer, she held forth against me with an eloquence\npeculiar to herself; calling me pitifull fellow, scoundrel, and a\nhundred such appellations; concluding with an oath, that, for all my\nappearance, she believed I had got no money in my pocket.\n\nHaving thus vented her indignation, she ordered her coachman to proceed,\nand I returned to the tavern, where I bespoke something for supper,\nvery well pleased at the issue of this adventure. I dispensed with the\nattendance of the waiter at table, on pretence that my own servant\nwas present, and, when we were alone, said to Strap, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Monsieur\nd'Estrapes, what d'ye think of this lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d My friend, who had not\nopened his mouth since her departure, could make no other reply than\nthe monosyllable \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he pronounced with a note of fear and\nastonishment. Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet,\nand, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his\ngrandfather's ghost? \u00e2\u0080\u009cGhost!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I have seen a devil\nincarnate! Who would have thought that so much devilish malice and\nBillingsgate could lurk under so much sweetness of countenance and\nmodesty of behaviour? Ah! God help us! Fronti nulla fides--nimium ne\ncrede colori--but we ought to down on our knees, and bless God for\ndelivering us from the jaws of that painted sepulchre!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was pretty\nmuch of Strap's opinion, and, though I did not believe myself in any\ndanger from the allurements of that sisterhood, I determined to act with\ngreat circumspection for the future, and shun all commerce of that kind,\nas equally prejudicial to my purse and constitution.\n\nMy next care was to introduce myself into a set of good acquaintance:\nfor which purpose I frequented a certain coffee-house, noted for\nthe resort of good company, English as well as foreigners, where my\nappearance procured all the civilities and advances I could desire. As\nthere was an ordinary in the same house, I went upstairs to dinner with\nthe other guests, and found myself at a table with thirteen people, the\ngreatest part of whom were better dressed than myself. The conversation,\nwhich was mostly carried on in French, turned chiefly on politics; and\nI soon found the whole company were in the French interest, myself\nexcepted, and a testy old gentleman, who contradicted everything that\nwas advanced in favour of his Most Christian Majesty, with a surliness\ntruly English. But this trusty patriot, who had never been out of his\nown country, and drew all his maxims and notions from prejudice and\nhearsay, was very unequal to his antagonists, who were superior to him\nin learning and experience, and often took the liberty of travellers\nin asserting things which were not strictly true, because they thought\nthemselves in no danger of being detected by him. The claim of the Queen\nOf Spain to the Austrian dominions in Italy was fully explained and\nvindicated, by a person who sat opposite to me, and, by the solemnity\nof his manner and the richness of his apparel, seemed to be a foreign\nambassador. This dissertation produced another on the Pragmatic\nSanction, handled with great warmth by a young gentleman at my right\nhand, dressed in a green frock, trimmed with gold, who justified the\nFrench king for his breach of that contract; and affirmed that he could\nnot have observed it without injuring his own glory. Although I was\nnot at all convinced by this gentleman's arguments, I could not help\nadmiring his vivacity which, I imagined, must be the effect of his\nillustrious birth and noble education, and accordingly rated him, in\nmy conjecture, as a young prince on his travels. The discourse was\nafterwards shifted by an old gentleman, of a very martial appearance, to\nthe last campaign, when the battle of Dettingen was fought over again,\nwith so many circumstances to the honour of the French and disadvantages\nif the Allies, that I began to entertain some doubts of my having been\nthere in person, and took the liberty to mention some objections to\nwhat he advanced. This freedom introduced a dispute, which lasted a good\nwhile, to the mortification of all present; and was at last referred to\nthe determination of a grave person, whom they styled Doctor, and who,\nunder a show of great moderation, decided it against me, with so little\nregard to truth, that I taxed him with partiality in pretty severe\nterms, to the no small entertainment of the true English politician,\nwho rejoiced at my defence of a cause he had so often espoused without\nsuccess.\n\nMy opponent, pleased with the victory he had gained, affected a great\ndeal of candour, and told me, he should not have been so positive, if\nhe had not been at great pains to inform himself of each particular.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am convinced that the previous steps considered,\nthings could not happen otherwise; for we generals who have seen\nservice, though we may not be on the spot ourselves, know by the least\nsketch of the disposition what must be the event.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then censured,\nwith great freedom, every circumstance of the conduct of those who\ncommanded the Allies; from thence made a transition to the ministry,\nwhich he honoured with many invectives for employing people who had\nneither experience nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers,\nwho had been distinguished for both; dropped many hints of his own\nimportance, and concluded with observing, that the French and Spaniards\nknew better how to value generals of merit; the good effects of which\nare seen in the conquests they gain, and the discipline of their troops,\nwhich are at the same time better clothed and paid than any soldiers\nin the universe. These remarks furnished the green knight with an\nopportunity of launching out in the praise of the French government\nin general, civil as well as military; on which occasion he made many\nodious comparisons to the disadvantage of the English. Everybody,\nalmost, assented to the observations he made, and the doctor gave his\nsanction, by saying, the people of France were undoubtedly the happiest\nsubjects in the world. I was so much astonished and confounded at their\ninfatuation and effrontery, that I had not power to utter one word in\nopposition to their assertions; but my morose associate could not put up\nwith the indignity that was offered to Old England, and therefore with\na satirical grin addressed himself to the general in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\nsir, I have often heard it said, She's a villainous bird that befouls\nher own nest. As for what those people who are foreigners say, I don't\nmind it; they know no better; but you who were bred and born, and have\ngot your bread, under the English government, should have more regard\nto gratitude, as well as truth in censuring your native country. If the\nministry have thought fit to lay you aside, I suppose they have their\nown reasons for so doing; and you ought to remember, that you still live\non the bounty of this nation. As for these gentlemen (meaning the prince\nand ambassador), who make so free with our constitution, laws, and\ngenius of our people, I think they might show a little more respect\nfor their benefactors, who, I must own, are to blame in harbouring and\nprotecting, and encouraging such ungrateful vagrants as they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At\nthese words, the chevalier in green started up in a great passion, and\nlaying his hand on the hilt of his hanger, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! foutre!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nEnglishman on the other hand, grasping his cane cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't foutre\nme, sirrah, or by G--d I'll knock you down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company interposed,\nthe Frenchman sat down again, and his antagonist proceeded--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLookey,\nMonsieur, you know very well that had you dared to speak so freely of\nthe administration of your own country in Paris as you have done of ours\nin London, you would have been sent to the Bastille without ceremony,\nwhere you might have rotted in a dungeon, and never seen the light of\nthe sun again. Now, sir, take my word for it, although our constitution\nscreens us from such oppression, we want not laws to chastise the\nauthors of seditious discourse, and if I hear another syllable out of\nyour mouth in contempt or prejudice of this kingdom, I will give you a\nconvincing proof of what I advance, and have you laid by the heels for\nyour presumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This declaration had an effect on the company as\nsudden as surprising. The young prince became as supple as a spaniel,\nthe ambassador trembled, the general sat silent and abashed, and the\ndoctor, who it seems, had felt the rod of power, grew pale as death,\nand assured us all, that he had no intention to affront any person or\npeople. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour principles, doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the old gentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009care\nno secret--I have nothing to say upon that head; but am very much\nsurprised, that a man who despises us so much, should notwithstanding\nlive among us, when he has no visible motive for so doing. Why don't you\ntake up your habitation in your beloved France, where you may rail at\nEngland without censure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this remonstrance the doctor thought proper\nto make no reply, and an unsocial silence ensued; which I perceiving,\ntook notice, that it was pity such idle disputes, maintained very often\nthrough whim or diversion, should create any misunderstanding among\ngentlemen of good sense, and proposed to drink down all animosity in\nanother bottle.\n\nThis motion was applauded by the whole company. The wine was brought,\nand the English champion, declaring he had no spleen against any man\nfor differing in opinion from him, any more than for difference of\ncomplexion, drank to the good health of all present; the compliment was\nreturned, and the conversation once more became unreserved though\nmore general than before. Among other topics, the subject of war\nwas introduced, on which the general declaimed with great eloquence,\nrecounting many of his own exploits by way of illustration. In the\ncourse of his harangue he happened to mention the word epaulement, upon\nwhich the testy gentleman asked the meaning, of that term. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell\nyou what an epaulement is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never saw an epaulement but\nonce, and that was at the siege of Namur. In a council of war, Monsieur\nCohorn, the famous engineer, affirmed that the place could not be\ntaken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince of Vandemont, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may be taken by\nan epaulement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was immediately put into execution, and in\ntwenty-four hours Mareschal Boufflers was fain to capitulate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he\nmade a full stop, and the old gentleman repeated the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\npray what is an epaulement?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this interrogation the officer made no\nimmediate reply, but rang the bell, and called for the bill, which being\nbrought, he threw down his proportion of the reckoning, and, telling the\ncompany he would show them an epaulement when his majesty should think\nfit to entrust him with the command of our army abroad, strutted away\nwith great dignity. I could not imagine why he was so shy of explaining\none of the most simple terms of fortification, which I forthwith\ndescribed as a side-work composed of earth, gabions, or fascines; but\nI was very much surprised when I afterwards understood that his reserve\nproceeded from his ignorance.\n\nHaving paid our bill, we adjourned to the coffee-room, where my\nfellow-labourer insisted on treating me with a dish, giving me to\nunderstand, at the same time, that I had acquired his good opinion, both\nwith respect to my principles and understanding. I thanked him for his\ncompliment, and, professing myself an utter stranger in this part of the\nworld, begged he would have the goodness to inform me of the quality and\ncharacters of the people who dined above. This request was a real favour\nto one of his disposition, which was no less communicative than curious;\nhe therefore complied with great satisfaction, and told me, to my\nextreme astonishment, that the supposed young prince was a dancer at one\nof the theatres, and the ambassador no other than a fiddler belonging\nto the opera. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a Roman Catholic priest, who\nsometimes appears in the character of an officer, and assumes the name\nof captain; but more generally takes the garb, title, and behaviour of a\nphysician, in which capacity he wheedles himself into the confidence\nof weak-minded people, and by arguments no less specious than false,\nconverts them from their religion and allegiance. He has been in the\nhands of justice more than once for such practices, but he is a sly dog,\nand manages matters with so much craft, that hitherto he has escaped for\na short imprisonment. As for the general, you may see he has owed his\npromotion more to his interest than his capacity; and, now that the eyes\nof the ministry are opened, his friends dead or become inconsiderable,\nhe is struck off the list, and obliged to put up with a yearly pension.\nIn consequence of this reduction, he is become malcontent, and inveighs\nagainst the government in all companies, with so little discretion, that\nI am surprised at the lenity of the administration, in overlooking his\ninsolence, but the truth of the matter is, he owes his safety to his\nweakness and want of importance. He has seen a little, and but a little,\nservice, and yet, if you will take his word to it, there has not been\na great action performed in the field since the Revolution, in which\nhe was not principally concerned. When a story is told of any great\ngeneral, he immediately matches it with one of himself, though he is\noften unhappy in his invention, and commits such gross blunders in the\ndetail, that everybody is in pain for him. Caesar, Pompey, and Alexander\nthe Great, are continually in his mouth; and, as he reads a good deal\nwithout any judgment to digest it, his ideas are confused, and his\nharangues as unintelligible as infinite; for, if once he begin, there is\nno chance of his leaving off speaking while one person remains to yield\nattention; therefore the only expedient I know, for putting a stop to\nhis loquacity, is to lay hold of some incongruity he has uttered, and\ndemand an explanation; or ask the meaning of some difficult term that he\nknows by name; this method will effectually put him to silence, if not\nto flight, as it happened when I inquired about an epaulement. Had he\nbeen acquainted with the signification of that word, his triumph would\nhave been intolerable, and we must have quitted the field first, or been\nworried with impertinence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving thus gratified my curiosity, the old gentleman began to discover\nhis own, in questions relating to myself, to which I thought proper\nto return ambiguous answers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have\ntravelled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say you have found it very\nexpensive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, one cannot travel without\nmoney.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I know by experience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I myself take a trip\nto Bath or Tunbridge every season; and one must pay sauce for what he\nhas on the road, as well in other countries as in this. That's a pretty\nstone in your ring--give me leave, sir--the French have attained to\na wonderful skill in making compositions of this kind. Why, now, this\nlooks almost as well as a diamond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost as well, Sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\nnot altogether? I am sure if you understand anything of jewels, you must\nperceive, at first sight, that this stone is a real diamond, and that of\na very fine water. Take it in your hand and examine it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did so with\nsome confusion, and returned it, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask your pardon; I see it\nis a true brilliant of immense value.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I imagined his respect to me\nincreased after this inquiry; therefore to captivate his esteem the\nmore, I told him, I would show him a seal of composition, engraved after\na very valuable antique; upon which I pulled out my watch with a rich\ngold chain, adorned with three seals set in gold, and an opal ring. He\nviewed each of them with great eagerness, handled the chain, admired the\nchased case, and observed that the whole must have cost me a vast sum of\nmoney. I affected indifference, and replied in a careless manner, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome\ntrifle of sixty or seventy guineas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He stared in my face for some time,\nand then asked if I was an Englishman? I answered in the negative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nare from Ireland then, Sir, I presume,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. I made the same reply.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou were born in one of our settlements abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n I still answered No. He seemed very much surprised, and said, he was\nsure I was not a foreigner. I made no reply, but left him upon the\ntenter-hooks of impatient uncertainty. He could not contain his anxiety,\nbut asked pardon for the liberties he had taken and, to encourage me\nthe more to disclose my situation, displayed his own without reserve.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca single man, have a considerable annuity, on which\nI live according to my inclination, and make the ends of the year meet\nvery comfortably. As I have no estate to leave behind, I am not troubled\nwith the importunate officiousness of relations or legacy hunters, and I\nconsider the world as made for me, not me for the world. It is my maxim,\ntherefore, to enjoy it while I can, and let futurity shift for itself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he thus indulged his own talkative vein, and at the same time,\nno doubt, expected retaliation from me, a young man entered, dressed\nin black velvet and an enormous tie-wig, with an air in which natural\nlevity and affected solemnity were so jumbled together, that on the\nwhole he appeared a burlesque on all decorum. This ridiculous oddity\ndanced up to the table at which we sat, and, after a thousand grimaces,\nasked my friend by the name of Mr. Medlar, if we were not engaged upon\nbusiness. My companion put on a surly countenance, and replied \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo great\nbusiness, doctor--but however--\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the physician; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmust beg your indulgence a little; pray pardon me, gentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, addressing himself to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour most humble servant. I hope\nyou will forgive me, sir--I must beg the favour to sit--sir--sir--I have\nsomething of consequence to impart to my friend Mr. Medlar--sir, I hope\nyou will excuse my freedom in whispering, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before I had time to\ngive this complaisant person my permission, Mr. Medlar cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll have\nno whispering--if you have anything to say to me, speak with an audible\nvoice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The doctor seemed a little disconcerted at this exclamation,\nand, turning again to me, made a thousand apologies for pretending to\nmake a mystery of anything, a piece of caution which he said was owing\nto his ignorance of my connection with Mr. Medlar; but now he understood\nI was a friend, and would communicate what he had to say in my hearing.\nHe then began, after two or three hems, in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must know,\nsir, I am just come from dinner at my Lady Flareit's (then addressing\nhimself to me), a lady of quality, sir, at whose table I have the honour\nof dining sometimes. There was Lady Stately and my Lady Larum, and Mrs.\nDainty, and Miss Biddy Giggler, upon my word, a very good-natured young\nlady, with a very pretty fortune sir. There was also my Lord Straddle.\nSir John Shrug, and Master Billy Chatter, who is actually a very\nfacetious young gentleman. So, sir, her ladyship seeing me excessively\nfatigued, for she was the last of fifteen patients (people of\ndistinction, sir) whom I had visited this forenoon, insisted upon\nmy staying dinner, though upon my word I protest I had no appetite;\nhowever, in compliance with her ladyship's request, sir, I sat down, and\nthe conversation turning on different subjects, among other things, Mr\nChatter asked very earnestly when I saw Mr. Medlar. I told him I had not\nhad the pleasure of seeing you these nineteen hours and a half; for you\nmay remember, sir, it was nearly about that time; I won't be positive as\nto a minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen I desire you will go to his lodgings\nimmediately after dinner, and see what's the matter with him, for he\nmust certainly be very bad from having eaten last night such a vast\nquantity of raw oysters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The crusty gentleman, who, from the solemnity\nof his delivery, expected something extraordinary, no sooner heard his\nconclusion, than he started up in a testy humour, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw, pshaw!\nD--n your oysters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and walked away, after a short compliment of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour\nservant sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to me. The doctor got up also, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI vow and protest,\nupon my word, I am actually amazed;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and followed Mr. Medlar to the\nbar, which was hard by, where he was paying for his coffee: there he\nwhispered so loud that I could overhear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray who is this gentleman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n His friend replied hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have known that before now, if it\nhad not been for your impertinent intrusion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and walked off very much\ndisappointed. The ceremonious physician returned immediately and sat\ndown by me, asking a thousand pardons for leaving me alone: and giving\nme to understand that what he had communicated to Mr. Medlar at the bar,\nwas an affair of the last importance, that would admit of no delay. He\nthen called for some coffee, and launched out into the virtues of that\nberry, which, he said, in cold phlegmatic constitutions, like his, dried\nup the superfluous moisture, and braced the relaxed nerves. He told me\nit was utterly unknown to the ancients; and derived its name from\nan Arabian word, which I might easily perceive by the sound and\ntermination. From this topic he transferred his disquisitions to the\nverb drink, which he affirmed was improperly applied to the taking of\ncoffee, inasmuch as people did not drink, but sip or sipple that liquor;\nthat the genuine meaning of drinking is to quench one's thirst, or\ncommit a debauch by swallowing wine; that the Latin word, which conveyed\nthe same idea, was bibere or potare, and that of the Greeks pinein or\npoteein, though he was apt to believe they were differently used on\ndifferent occasions: for example--to drink a vast quantity, or, as the\nvulgar express it, to drink an ocean of liquor, was in Latin potare,\nand in Greek poteein; and, on the other hand, to use it moderately,\nwas bibere and pinein;--that this was only a conjecture of his,\nwhich, however, seemed to be supported by the word bibulous, which is\nparticularly applied to the pores of the skin, and can only drink a very\nsmall quantity of the circumambient moisture, by reason of the smallness\nof their diameters;--whereas, from the verb poteein is derived the\nsubstantive potamos, which signifies a river, or vast quantity\nof liquor. I could not help smiling at this learned and important\ninvestigation; and, to recommend myself the more to my new acquaintance,\nwhose disposition I was by this time well informed of, I observed that,\nwhat he alleged, did not, to the best of my remembrance, appear in\nthe writings of the ancients; for Horace uses the words poto and bibo\nindifferently for the same purpose, as in the twentieth Ode of his first\nBook.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVile potabis modicis sabinum cantharis-- --Et praelo domitam caleno tu\nbibes uvam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat I had never heard of the verb poteein, but that potamos, potema,\nand potos, were derived from pino, poso, pepoka, in consequence of\nwhich, the Greek poets never use any other word for festal drinking.\nHomer describes Nestor at his cups in these words,\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNestora d'ouk elathen iache pinonta perempes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion always in every page.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPinonti de oinon hedun. Otan pino ton oinon. Opliz' ego de pino.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd in a thousand other places. The doctor who doubtless intended by\nhis criticism to give me a high idea of his erudition, was infinitely\nsurprised to find himself schooled by one of my appearance; and after\na considerable pause cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, you are in the right, sir--I\nfind I have not considered this affair with my usual accuracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then,\naccosting me in Latin, which he spoke very well, the conversation was\nmaintained full two hours, on a variety of subjects, in that\nlanguage; and indeed he spoke so judiciously, that I was convinced,\nnotwithstanding his whimsical appearance and attention to trifles, that\nhe was a man of extensive knowledge, especially in books; he looked\nupon me, as I afterwards understood from Mr. Medlar, as a prodigy\nin learning, and proposed that very night, if I were not engaged, to\nintroduce me to several young gentlemen of fortune and fashion, with\nwhom I had an appointment at the Bedford coffee house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nWagtail introduces me to set of fine Gentlemen with whom I spend\nthe Evening at a Tavern--our Conversation--the Characters of my new\nCompanions--the Doctor is roasted--our Issue of our Debauch\n\nI accepted his offer with pleasure, and we went thither in a hackney\ncoach where I saw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most\nof whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among the rest stood\na group of them round the fire whom I immediately knew to be the\nvery persons who had the night before, by their laughing, alarmed my\nsuspicion of the lady who had put herself under my protection. They no\nsooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail (for that was my companion's\nname) than they tittered and whispered one to another, and I was not\na little surprised to find that they were the gentlemen to whose\nacquaintance he designed to recommend me; for, when he observed them\ntogether, he to told me who they were, and desired to know by what\nname he should introduce me. I satisfied him in that particular, and\nhe advanced with great gravity, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, your most obedient\nservant:--give me leave to introduce my friend Mr. Random to your\nsociety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, turning to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Random, this is Mr. Bragwell--Mr.\nBanter, sir--Mr. Chatter--my friend Mr. Slyboot, and Mr. Ranter sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n I saluted each of then in order, and when I came to take Mr. Slyboot\nby the hand, I perceived him thrust his tongue in his cheek, to the no\nsmall entertainment of the company; but I did not think proper to take\nany notice of it on this occasion. Mr. Ranter too (who I afterwards\nlearned was a player) displayed his talents, by mimicking my air,\nfeatures, and voice, while he returned my compliment: this feat I should\nnot have been so sensible of, had I not seen him behave in the same\nmanner to my friend Wagtail, when he made up to them at first. But for\nonce I let him enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without question or\ncontrol, resolved however to chastise his insolence at a more convenient\nopportunity. Mr. Slyboot, guessing I was a stranger, asked if I had been\nlately in France? and when I answered in the affirmative, inquired if\nI had seen the Luxembourg Gallery? I told him I had considered it more\nthan once with great attention: upon this a conversion ensued, in which\nI discovered him to be a painter.\n\nWhile we were discoursing upon the particulars of this famous\nperformance, I overheard Banter ask Dr. Wagtail, where he had picked\nup this Mr. Random. To which question the physician answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my\nword, a mighty pretty sort of a gentleman--a man of fortune, sir--he has\nmade the grand tour, and seen the best company in Europe, air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\nhe told you so, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take him to be neither\nmore nor less than a French valet-de-chambre.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cO barbarous, barbarous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried the doctor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is actually, upon my word, altogether\nunaccountable. I know all his family perfectly well, sir; he is of the\nRandoms of the north--a very ancient house sir, and a distant relation\nof mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr. Banter, and\nbegan to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company in general;\nbut, as I might possibly by their means acquire a more extensive and\nagreeable acquaintance, I determined to bear these little mortifications\nas long as I could without injuring the dignity of my character. After\nhaving talked for some time on the weather, plays, politics, and other\ncoffee-house subjects, it was proposed that we should spend the evening\nat a noted tavern in the neighbourhood, whither we repaired in a body.\n\nHaving taken possession of a room, called for French wine, and bespoke\nsupper, the glass went about pretty freely, and the characters of my\nassociates opened upon me more and more. It soon appeared that the\ndoctor was entertained as butt for the painter and player to exercise\ntheir wit upon, for the diversion of the company. Mr. Ranter began the\ngame by asking him what was good for a hoarseness, lowness of spirits,\nand in digestion, for he was troubled with all these complaints to a\nvery great degree. Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature\nof his case, and in a very prolix manner harangued upon prognostics,\ndiagnostics, symptomatics, therapeutics, inanition, and repletion;\nthen calculated the force of the stomach and lungs in their respective\noperations; ascribed the player's malady to a disorder in these organs,\nproceeding from hard drinkings and vociferations, and prescribed a\ncourse of stomachics, with abstinence from venery, wine, loud speaking,\nlaughing, singing, coughing, sneezing, or hallooing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPah, pah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nRanter, interrupting him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe remedy is worse than the disease--I\nwish I knew where to find some tinder water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTinder water!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe doctor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, I don't apprehend you, Mr. Ranter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWater\nextracted from tinder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca universal specific for all\ndistempers incident to man. It was invented by a learned German monk,\nwho, for a valuable consideration, imparted the secret to Paracelsus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the painter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was first used by Solomon, as\nappears by a Greek manuscript in his civil handwriting, lately found at\nthe foot of Mount Lebanon, by a peasant who was digging for potatoes--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wagtail, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin all my vast reading, I never met with such\na preparation! neither did I know till this minute, that Solomon\nunderstood Greek, or that potatoes grew in Palestine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere Banter interposed, saying, he was surprised that Dr. Wagtail\nshould make the least doubt of Solomon's understanding Greek, when he is\nrepresented to us as the wisest and best-educated prince in the world;\nand as for potatoes, they were transplanted thither from Ireland, in the\ntime of the Crusade, by some knights of that country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI profess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is nothing more likely. I would actually give a vast\nsum for a sight of that manuscript, which must be inestimable; and, if\nI understood the process, would set about it immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nplayer assured him the process was very simple--that he must cram a\nhundred-weight of dry tinder into a glass retort, and, distilling it\nby the force of animal heat, it would yield half a scruple of insipid\nwater, one drop of which is a full dose. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my integrity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed\nthe incredulous doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is very amazing and extraordinary! that\na caput mortuum should yield any water at all. I must own I have always\nbeen an enemy to specifics which I thought inconsistent with the nature\nof the animal economy; but certainly the authority of Solomon is not to\nbe questioned. I wonder where I shall find a glass retort large enough\nto contain such a vast quantity of tinder, the consumption of which\nmust, undoubtedly, raise the price of paper, or where shall I find\nanimal heat sufficient even to warm such a mass?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Slyboot informed him,\nthat he might have a retort blown for him as big as a church: and, that\nthe easiest method of raising the vapour by animal heat, would be to\nplace it in the middle of an infirmary for feverish patients, who might\nbe upon mattresses around and in contact with it. He had he sooner\npronounced these words, than Wagtail exclaimed in a rapture, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\nadmirable expedient, as I hope to be saved! I will positively put it in\npractice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis simplicity of the physician furnished excellent diversion for the\ncompany, who, in their turns, sneered at him in ironical compliments,\nwhich his vanity swallowed as the genuine sentiments of their hearts.\nMr. Chatter, impatient of so long a silence, now broke out and\nentertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the last\nHampstead assembly, with a most circumstantial account of the dress and\nornaments of each, from the lappets of the ladies to the shoe-buckles of\nthe men; concluding with telling Bragwell, that his mistress Melinda was\nthere, and seemed to miss him: and soliciting his company at the next\noccasion of that kind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, d--mm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bragwell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have something else to mind than dangling\nafter a parcel of giddy-headed girls; besides, you know my temper is\nso unruly, that I am apt to involve myself in scrapes when a woman is\nconcerned. The last time I was there, I had an affair with Tom Trippit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I remember that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Banter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lugged out before the ladies;\nand I commend you for so doing, because you had an opportunity of\nshowing your manhood without running any risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRisk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other\nwith a fierce countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd--n my blood! I fear no risks. I an't\nafraid of lugging out against any man that wears a head, d-me! 'Tis well\nknown that I have drawn blood more than once, and lost some too; but\nwhat does that signify?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The player begged this champion to employ him\nas his second the next time he intended to kill, for he wanted to see\na man die of a stab, that he might know how to act such an art the more\nnaturally on the stage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the hero: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, by G--! I know\nbetter things than to incur the verdict of a Middlesex jury--I should\nlook upon my fencing-master to be an ignorant son of a b--h, if he had\nnot taught me to prick any of my antagonist's body that I please to\ndisable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Slyboot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif that be the case, I have a favour to\nask. You must know I am employed to paint a Jesus on the cross; and\nmy purpose is to represent him at that point of time when the spear is\nthrust into his side. Now I should be glad if you would, in my presence,\npink some impertinent fellow into convulsions, without endangering his\nlife, that I may have an opportunity of taking a good clever agony from\nnature: the doctor will direct you where to enter and how far to go,\nbut pray let it be as near the left side as possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wagtail, who took\nthis proposal seriously, observed, that it would be a very difficult\nmatter to penetrate into the left side of the thorax without hurting the\nheart, and in consequence killing the patient; but he believed it was\npossible for a man of a very nice hand and exact knowledge of anatomy,\nto wound the diaphragma somewhere about the skirts, which might induce\na singultus, without being attended with death: that he was ready to\ndemonstrate the insertion of that muscle to Mr. Bragwell; but desired to\nhave no concern with the experiment, which might essentially prejudice\nhis reputation, in case of a miscarriage. Bragwell was as much imposed\nupon by the painter's waggery as the doctor, and declined engaging in\nthe affair, saying he held a very great regard for Mr. Slyboot, but\nhad laid it down as a maxim, never to fight except when his honour\nwas engaged. A thousand jokes of this kind were uttered; the wine\ncirculated, supper was served in, we ate heartily, returned to the\nbottle, Bragwell became noisy and troublesome, Banter grew more and more\nsevere, Ranter rehearsed, Slyboot made faces at the whole company, I\nsang French catches, and Chatter kissed me with great affection; while\nthe doctor, with a wofull countenance, sat silent like a disciple of\nPythagoras. At length, it was proposed by Bragwell, that we should scour\nthe hundreds, sweat the constable, maul the watch, and then reel soberly\nto bed.\n\nWhile we deliberated upon this expedition, the waiter came into the\nroom, and asked for Doctor Wagtail: when he understood he was present,\nhe told him there was a lady below to inquire for him, at which message\nthe physician started from his melancholy contemplation, and, with a\nlook of extreme confusion, assured the company he could not possibly be\nthe person wanted, for he had no connection with any lady whatever, and\nbade the drawer tell her so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Banter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould you be\nso impolite as to refuse a lady a hearing? perhaps she comes for a\nconsultation. It must be some extraordinary affair that brings a lady\nto a tavern at this time of night. Mr. Ranter, pray do the doctor's\nbase-mains to the lady, and squire her hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The player immediately\nstaggered out, and returned, leading in with much ceremony, a tall\nstrapping wench, whose appearance proclaimed her occupation. We received\nher with the utmost solemnity, and with a good deal of entreaty she was\npersuaded to sit, when a profound silence ensued, during which she fixed\nher eyes, with a disconsolate look, upon the doctor, who was utterly\nconfounded at her behaviour, and returned her melancholy fourfold;\nat length, after a good many piteous sighs, she wiped her eyes, and\naccosted him thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! not one word of comfort? Will nothing soften\nthat stony heart of thine? Not all my tears! not all my affliction! not\nthe inevitable ruin thou hast brought upon me! Where are thy vows, thou\nfaithless, perjured man? Hast thou no honour--no conscience--no remorse\nfor thy perfidious conduct towards me? Answer me, wilt thou at last do\nme justice, or must I have recourse to heaven or hell for my revenge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n If poor Wagtail was amazed before she spoke, what must his confusion\nbe on hearing this address! His natural paleness changed into a ghastly\nclay colour, his eyes rolled, his lip trembled, and he answered in an\naccent not to be described, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, honour, and salvation,\nmadam, you are actually mistaken in my person. I have a most particular\nveneration for your sex, and, am actually incapable of injuring any\nlady in the smallest degree, madam; besides, madam, to the best of my\nrecollection, I never had the honour of seeing you before, as I hope to\nbe saved, madam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, traitor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdost thou disown me then?\nMistaken! no, too well I know that fair bewitching face! too well I know\nthat false enchanting tongue! Alas! gentlemen, since the villain compels\nme by his unkindness, to expose myself and him, know that this betrayer,\nunder the specious pretence of honourable addresses, won my heart, and\ntaking advantage of his conquest, robbed me of my virgin treasure, and\nafterwards abandoned me to my fate! I am now four months gone with child\nby him, turned out of doors by my relations, and left a prey to misery\nand want! Yes, thou barbarian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, turning to Wagtail, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou\ntiger, thou succubus! too well thou knowest my situation. But I\nwill tear out thy faithless heart, and deliver the world from such\na monster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she sprang forward at the doctor, who with\nincredible agility, jumped over the table, and ran behind Bragwell,\nwhile the rest of us endeavoured to appease the furious heroine.\nAlthough everybody in the company affected the utmost surprise, I\ncould easily perceive it was a scheme concerted among them to produce\ndiversion at the doctor's expense, and being under no concern about the\nconsequence, I entered into the confederacy, and enjoyed the distress\nof Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes begged the protection of the\ncompany, declaring himself as innocent of the crime laid to his charge\nas the foetus in utero; and hinting at the same time, that nature had\nnot put it in his power to be guilty of such a trespass. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nthe lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere was no nature in the case; he abused me by the help\nof charms and spells; else how is it possible that any woman could have\nlistened to the addresses of such a scarecrow? Were these owlish eyes\nmade for ogling; that carrion complexion to be admired; or that mouth,\nlike a horse-shoe, to be kissed? No, no, you owe your success to your\nphiltres, to your drugs and incantations; and not to your natural\ntalents, which are, in every respect, mean and contemptible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor thought he had got an opportunity of vindicating himself\neffectually; and desired the complainant to compose herself but for\nhalf-an-hour, in which he undertook to prove the absurdity of believing\nin the power of incantations, which were only idle dreams of ignorance\nand superstition. He accordingly pronounced a very learned discourse\nupon the nature of ideas, the power and independence of the mind, the\nproperties of stimulating medicines, the difference between a proneness\nto venery, which many simples would create, and a passion limited to\none object, which can only be the result of sense and reflection; and\nconcluded with a pathetic remonstrance, setting forth his unhappiness\nin being persecuted with the resentment of a lady whom he had never\ninjured, nor even seen before that occasion, and whose faculties were,\nin all likelihood, so much impaired by her misfortunes that an innocent\nperson was in danger of being ruined by her disorder. He had no\nsooner finished his harangue, than the forlorn princess renewed her\nlamentations, and cautioned the company against his eloquence, which,\nshe said, was able to bias the most impartial bench in Christendom.\nRanter advised him to espouse her immediately, as the only means to\nsave his reputation, and offered to accompany him to the Fleet for that\npurpose; but Slyboot proposed that a father should be purchased for the\nchild, and a comfortable alimony settled on the mother. Ranter promised\nto adopt the infant gratis. Wagtail was ready to worship him for his\ngenerosity, and, though he persisted in protesting his innocence,\ncondescended to everything rather than his unblemished character should\nbe called into question. The lady rejected the proposal, and insisted on\nmatrimony. Bragwell took up the cudgels for the doctor, and undertook to\nrid him of her importunity for half-a-guinea; upon which Wagtail, with\ngreat eagerness, pulled out his purse, and put it into the hand of his\nfriend, who, taking half a piece out of it, gave it to the plaintiff,\nand bade her thank God for her good fortune. When she had received\nthis bounty, she affected to weep, and begged, since the physician had\nrenounced her, he would at least vouchsafe her a parting kiss; this he\nwas prevailed upon to grant with great reluctance, and went up with his\nusual solemnity to salute her, when she laid hold of his cheek with her\nteeth, and held fast, while he roared with anguish, to the unspeakable\ndiversion of all present. When she thought proper to release him, she\ndropped a low courtesy to the company, and quitted the room, leaving the\ndoctor in the utmost horror, not so much on account of the pain, as the\napprehension of the consequence of the bite; for, by this time, he was\nconvinced of her being mad. Banter prescribed the actual cautery, and\nput the poker in the fire to be heated, in order to sear the place. The\nplayer was of opinion that Bragwell should scoop out the part affected\nwith the point of his sword; but the painter prevented both these\ndreadful operations by recommending a balsam he had in his pocket, which\nnever failed to cure the bite of a mad dog; so saying, he pulled out a\nsmall bladder of black paint, with which he instantly anointed not only\nthe sore, but the greatest part of the patient's face, and left it in\na frightful condition. In short, the poor creature was so harassed with\nfear and vexation, that I pitied him extremely, and sent him home in a\nchair, contrary to the inclination of everybody present.\n\nThis freedom of mine gave umbrage to Bragwell, who testified his\ndispleasure by swearing a few threats, without making any application;\nwhich, being perceived by Slyboot, who sat by me, he, with a view of\npromoting a quarrel, whispered to me, that he thought Bragwell used\nme very ill, but every man was the best judge of his own affairs. I\nanswered aloud, that I would neither suffer Mr. Bragwell nor him to\nuse me ill with impunity; and that I stood in no need of his counsel\nin regard to the regulation of my conduct. He thought proper to ask\na thousand pardons, and assure me he meant no offence; while Bragwell\nfeigned himself asleep, that he might not be obliged to take notice\nof what passed. But the player, who had more animal spirits and less\ndiscretion than Slyboot, unwilling to let the affair rest where he had\ndropped it, jogged Mr. Bragwell and told him softly that I had called\nhim names, and threatened to cudgel him. This particular I understood\nby his starting, up and crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and wounds, you lie! No man\ndurst treat me so ignominiously. Mr. Random, did you call me names, and\nthreaten to drub me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I denied the imputation, and proposed to punish\nthe scoundrel who endeavoured to foment disturbance in the company.\nBragwell signified his approbation, and drew his sword; I did the same,\nand accosted the actor in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLookee, Mr. Ranter; I know you\npossess all the mimicry and mischievous qualities of an ape, because I\nhave observed you put them all in practice more than once to-night, on\nme and others; now I want to see if you resemble one in nimbleness also;\ntherefore, I desire you leap over this sword without hesitation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, I held it parallel to the horizon, at the distance of about\nthree feet from the floor, and called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce-twice-thrice--and away!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n but, instead of complying with my demand, he snatched his hat and\nhanger, and, assuming the looks, swagger, and phrase of Pistol, burst\nout into the following exclamation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! must I then perform inglorious\nprank of sylvan ape in mountain forest caught! Death rock me asleep,\nabridge my doleful days, and lay my head in fury's lap--Have we not\nHiren here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This buffoonery did not answer his expectation, for, by\nthis time, the company was bent on seeing him in a new character. Mr.\nBanter desired me to hold my sword a foot or two higher, that he might\nhave the better opportunity of exerting himself. The painter told\nhim, if he performed well, he would recommend him as a vaulter to the\nproprietors of Sadler's Wells; and Bragwell crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeap for the King!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n applied the point of his sword to the player's posteriors with\nsuch success, that he sprang over in a trice, and, finding the door\nunguarded, vanished in a twinkling; glad, no doubt, of having paid his\nshare of the reckoning so easily.\n\nIt being now near two o'clock in the morning, we discharged the bill,\nand sallied out into the street. The painter slunk away without taking\nhis leave. Billy Chatter, being unable to speak or stand, was sent to\na bagnio; and Banter and I accompanied Bragwell to Moll King's\ncoffee-house, where after he had kicked half a dozen hungry whores,\nwe left him asleep on a bench, and directed our course towards\nCharing-cross, near which place both he and I lodged.\n\nThe natural dryness of my companion being overcome by liquor, he\nhonoured me by the way with many compliments and professions, of\nfriendship, for which I made suitable acknowledgments, and told him\nI thought myself happy in having, by my behaviour, removed the\nunfavourable opinion he entertained of me at first sight. He was\nsurprised at this declaration, and begged me to explain myself; upon\nwhich I mentioned what I had overheard him say of me to Wagtail in the\ncoffee-house. He laughed, and made an apology for his freedom, assuring\nme, that my appearance had very much prepossessed him in my favour; and\nwhat he said was only intended as a joke on the doctor's solemnity. I\nwas highly pleased at being undeceived in this particular, and not a\nlittle proud of the good opinion of this wit, who shook me by the hand\nat parting, and promised to meet me the next day at the ordinary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nStrap communicates to me a conquest he had made of a Chandler's\nWidow--finds himself miserably mistaken--I go to the Opera--admire\nMelinda--am cautioned by Banter--go to the Assembly at Hampstead--dance\nwith that young lady--receive an insolent message from Bragwell, whose\nmettle is soon cooled--am in favour with my Mistress, whom I visit next\nday, and am bubbled out of eighteen guineas at cards--Strap triumphs at\nmy success, but is astonished at my expense--Banter comes to my lodging,\nis very sarcastic at my expense, and borrows five guineas from me, as a\nproof of his friendship\n\nIn the morning, before I got up, Strap came into my chamber, and,\nfinding me awake, hemmed several times, scratched his head, cast his\neyes upon the ground, and, with a very foolish kind of simper upon his\nface gave me to understand he had something to communicate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your\ncountenance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expect to hear good tidings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndifferently,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied he, tittering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is, hereafter as it shall be. You must\nknow, I have some thoughts of altering my condition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I,\nastonished, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca matrimonial scheme? O rare Strap! thou hast got the heels\nof me at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cN--no less, I assure you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, bursting into a\nlaugh of self-approbation: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca tallow chandler's widow that lives\nhard by, has taken a liking to me, a fine jolly dame, as plump as a\npartridge. She has a well-furnished house, a brisk trade, and a good\ndeal of the ready. I may have her for the asking. She told a friend of\nmine, a brother footman, that she would take me out of a stinking clout.\nBut I refused to give my final answer, till I knew your opinion of the\nmatter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I congratulated Monsieur d'Estrapes upon his conquest,\nand approved of the scheme, provided he could be assured of those\ncircumstances of her fortune; but advised him to do nothing rashly,\nand give me an opportunity of seeing the lady before matters should be\nbrought to a conclusion. He assured me he would do nothing without\nmy consent and approbation, and that very morning, while I was at\nbreakfast, introduce his inamorata to my acquaintance. She was a\nshort thick woman, about the age of thirty-six, and had a particular\nprominence of belly, which I perceived at first sight, not without some\nsuspicion of foul play. I desired her, however, to sit, and treated\nher with a dish of tea; the discourse turning on the good qualities of\nStrap, whom I represented as a prodigy of sobriety, industry and virtue.\nWhen she took her leave, he followed her to the door, and returned\nlicking his lips, and asking if I did not think she was a luscious\ncreature. I made no mystery of my apprehension, but declared my\nsentiments of her without reserve; at which he was not surprised,\ntelling me he had observed the same symptom, but was informed by his\nfriend that she was only livergrown and would in few months be as small\nin the waist as ever. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca few weeks, I believe, will\ndo the business. In short, Strap, it is my opinion, that you are\negregiously imposed upon; and that this friend is no other than a rascal\nwho wants to palm his trull upon you for a wife, that he may at once\ndeliver himself from the importunities of the mother and the expense of\nher bantling; for which reason I would not have you trust implicitly\nto the report he makes of her wealth, which is inconsistent with his\nbehaviour, nor run your head precipitately into a noose, that you\nmay afterwards wish exchanged for the hangman's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He seemed very much\nstartled at my insinuation, and promised to look twice before he leaped;\nsaying, with some heat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds, if I find his intention is to betray me,\nwe shall see which of us is the better man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d My prediction was verified\nin less than a fortnight, her great belly producing an infant, to the\nunspeakable amazement of Strap, who was before this happened, inclinable\nto believe I had refined a little too much in my penetration. His false\nfriend disappeared; and a few days after an execution was issued against\nher goods and household furniture, which were seized by the creditors.\n\nMeanwhile I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening\nwent to the Opera with him and Mr Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in\none of the boxes, and offered to introduce me to her, observing at the\nsame time, that she was a reigning toast worth ten thousand pounds.\nThis piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I discovered\ngreat eagerness to accept the proposal; upon which he assured me I\nshould dance with her at the next assembly, if he had any influence in\nthat quarter: so saying, he went round, spoke to her some minutes,\nand, as I imagined, pointed at me; then returning, told me, to my\ninexpressible pleasure, that I might depend upon what he had promised,\nfor she was now engaged as my partner. Banter in a whisper, gave me to\nunderstand that she was an incorrigible coquette, who would grant the\nsame favour to any young fellow in England of a tolerable appearance,\nmerely to engage him among the herd of her admirers, that she might\nhave the pleasure of seeing them daily increase; that she was of a cold\ninsensible disposition, dead to every passion but vanity, and so blind\nto merit, that he would lay any wager the wealthiest fool would carry\nher at last. I attributed a good deal of this intelligence to the\nsatirical turn of my friend, or resentment for having himself suffered\na rebuff from the lady in question, and, at any rate, trusted so much to\nmy own accomplishments as to believe no woman could resist the ardour of\nmy addresses.\n\nFull of this confidence I repaired to Hampstead in company with\nBilly Chatter, my Lord Hobble, and Doctor Wagtail. There I saw a very\nbrilliant assembly, before whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with\nMelinda, who charmed me with her frank manner and easiness of behaviour.\nBefore the country dances began, I received a message by a person I did\nnot know from Bragwell, who was present, importing that nobody who knew\nhim presumed to dance with Melinda while he was there in person, that I\nwould do well to relinquish her without noise, because he had a mind to\nlead up a country dance with her. This extraordinary intimation, which\nwas delivered in the lady's hearing, did not at all discompose me, who,\nby this time, was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival.\nI therefore, without the least symptom of concern bade the gentleman\ntell Mr. Bragwell, that since I was so happy as to obtain the lady's\nconsent, I should not be solicitous about his; and desired the bearer\nhimself to bring me no such impertinent messages for the future.\nMelinda, affected a sort of confusion, and pretended to wonder that Mr.\nBragwell should give himself such liberties with regard to her, who had\nno manner of connection with the fellow. I laid hold of this opportunity\nto display my valour, and offered to call him to an account for his\ninsolence, a proposal which she absolutely refused, under pretence of\nconsulting my safety; though I could perceive, by the sparkling of her\neyes, that she would not have thought herself affronted by being the\nsubject of a duel. I was by no means pleased with this discovery of\nher thoughts, which not only argued the most unjustifiable vanity, but\nlikewise the most barbarous indifference; however, I was allured by her\nfortune, and resolved to gratify her pride, in making her the occasion\nof a public quarrel between me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty certain,\nwould never drive matters to a dangerous extremity.\n\nWhile we danced together, I observed this formidable rival at one end\nof the room, encircled with a cluster of beaux, to whom he talked with\ngreat vehemence, casting many big looks at me from time to time. I\nguessed the subject of his discourse, and as soon as I had handed my\npartner to her seat, strutted up to the place where he stood, and,\ncocking my hat in his face, demanded aloud, if he had anything to say\nto me. He answered with a sullen tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, at present, sir;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nturned about upon his heel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou where I am to be found\nat any time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His companions stared at one another, and I returned to\nthe lady, whose features brightened at my approach, and immediately a\nwhisper ran through the whole room; after which so many eyes were turned\nupon me that I was ready to sink with confusion. When the ball broke up,\nI led her to her coach, and, like a true French gallant, would have got\nup behind it, in order to protect her from violence on the road, but she\nabsolutely refused my offer, and expressed her concern that there was\nnot an empty seat for me within the vehicle.\n\nNext day, in the afternoon, I waited on her at her lodgings, by\npermission, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by\nher mother, with whom she lived. There were a good many fashionable\npeople present, chiefly young fellows, and immediately after tea, a\ncouple of card tables were set, at one of which I had the honour to play\nwith Melinda, who in less than three hours, made shift to plunder me of\neight guineas. I was well enough content to lose a little money with a\ngood grace, that I might have an opportunity in the meantime to say soft\nthings, which are still most welcome when attended with good luck; but I\nwas by no means satisfied of her fair play, a circumstance that\nshocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my opinion of her\ndisinterestedness and delicacy. However, I was resolved to profit\nby this behaviour, and treat her in my turn with less ceremony;\naccordingly, I laid close siege to her, and, finding her not at all\ndisgusted with the gross incense I offered, that very night made a\ndeclaration of love in plain terms. She received my addresses with great\ngaiety, and pretended to laugh them off, but at the same time treated\nme with such particular complacency that I was persuaded I had made\na conquest of her heart, and concluded myself the happiest man alive.\nElevated with these flattering ideas, I sat down again to cards after\nsupper, and with great cheerfulness suffered myself to be cheated of ten\nguineas more.\n\nIt was late before I took my leave, after being favoured with a general\ninvitation; and, when I got into bed, the adventures of the day\nhindered me from sleeping. Sometimes I pleased myself with the hopes of\npossessing a fine woman with ten thousand pounds; then I would ruminate\non the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with the\ncircumstances of her conduct towards me, which seemed to bear too great\na resemblance to the picture he had drawn. This introduced a melancholy\nreflection on the expense I had undergone, and the smallness of my funds\nto support it, which, by-the-by, were none of my own. In short, I found\nmyself involved in doubts and perplexities, that kept me awake the\ngreatest part of the night.\n\nIn the morning, Strap, with whom I had not conversed for two days,\npresented himself with the utensils for shaving me; upon which, I\nasked his opinion of the lady he had seen me conduct to her coach at\nHampstead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds! she's a delicious creature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, as I am\ninformed, a great fortune. I am sorry you did not insist on going home\nwith her. I dare say, she would not have refused your company; for she\nseems to be a good-humoured soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's a time for all things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nI, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must know, Strap, I was in company with her till one o'clock\nthis morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had no sooner pronounced these words than he began to\ncaper about the room, and snap his fingers, crying in a transport, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nday's our own--the day's our own!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I gave him to understand that his\ntriumph was a little premature, and that I had more difficulties to\nsurmount than he was aware of; then I recounted to him the intelligence\nI had received from Banter. At which he changed colour, shook his head,\nand observed there was no faith in woman. I told him I was resolved to\nmake a bold push notwithstanding, although I foresaw it would lead me\ninto a great expense; and bade him guess the sum I had lost last night\nat cards. He scratched his chin, and protested his abhorrence of cards,\nthe very name of which being mentioned, made him sweat with vexation, as\nit recalled the money-dropper to his remembrance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have to do with other guess people now. Why, I suppose, if you\nhad a bad run last night, you would scarce come off for less than ten or\ntwelve shilling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was mortified at this piece of simplicity, which\nI imagined, at that time, was all affected by way of reprimand for my\nfolly; and asked with some heat if he thought I had spent the evening\nin a cellar with chairmen and bunters; giving him to know, at the same\ntime, that my expense had amounted to eighteen guineas.\n\nIt would require the pencil of Hogarth to express the astonishment and\nconcern of Strap on hearing this piece of news; the basin, in which he\nwas preparing the lather for my chin, dropped out of his hands, and he\nremained some time immovable in that ludicrous attitude, with his mouth\nopen, and his eyes thrust forward considerably beyond their station;\nbut, remembering my disposition, which was touchy, and impatient of\ncontrol, he smothered his chagrin, and attempted to recollect himself.\nWith this view he endeavoured to laugh, but in spite if his teeth, broke\nout in a whimper, took up his wash-ball and pewter-pot, scrubbed my\nbeard with the one, and discharged the other upon my face. I took no\nnotice of this confusion, but after he had fully recovered himself, put\nhim in mind of his right, and assured him of my readiness to surrender\nmy effects whenever he should think proper to demand them. He was\nnettled at my insinuation, which he thought proceeded from my distrust\nof his friendship; and begged I would never talk to him in that strain\nagain, unless I had a mind to break his heart.\n\nThis good creature's unalterable friendship for me affected me with\nthe most grateful sentiments, and acted as a spur to my resolution of\nacquiring a fortune, that I might have it in my power to manifest my\ngenerosity in my turn. For this purpose, I determined to bring matters\nto a speedy conclusion with Melinda; well knowing that a few such nights\nas the last would effectually incapacitate me from prosecuting that or\nany other advantageous amour.\n\nWhile my meditation was busied in planning out my future conduct, Mr.\nBanter favoured me with a visit, and after breakfast asked how I\nhad passed the preceding evening. I answered I was very agreeably\nentertained at a private house. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, with a sarcastic smile,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou deserve something extraordinary for the price you paid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was\nsurprised at this remark, and pretended ignorance of his meaning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\ncome, Mr. Random,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou need not make a mystery of it to\nme; the whole town has it. I wish that foolish affair between you\nand Bragwell at Hampstead had been less public. It has set all the\nbusybodies at work to find out your real character and situation; and\nyou cannot imagine what conjectures have already circulated at your\nexpense. One suspects you to be a Jesuit in disguise; another thinks you\nare an agent from the Pretender; a third believes you to be an upstart\ngamester, because nobody knows anything of your family or fortune; a\nfourth is of opinion that you are an Irish fortune-hunter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This last\nhypothesis touched me so nearly that, to conceal my confusion, I was\nfain to interrupt his detail, and damn the world for an envious\nmeddling community, that would not suffer a gentleman to live without\nmolestation. He took no notice of this apostrophe, but went on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my\nown part, I neither know nor desire to know who or what you are. This\nI am certain of, that few people make a mystery of their origin or\nsituation, who can boast of anything advantageous in either; and my\nown opinion of the matter is that you have raised yourself, by your\nindustry, from nothing to the appearance you now maintain, and which you\nendeavour to support by some matrimonial scheme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he fixed his eyes\nsteadfastly upon me and perceiving my face covered with blushes, told\nme, how he was confirmed in his opinion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook ye, Random,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave divined your plan, and am confident it will never succeed. You are\ntoo honest and too ignorant of the town to practise the necessary cheats\nof your profession, and detect the conspiracies that will be formed\nagainst you. Besides, you are downright bashful. What the devil! set\nup for a fortune hunter before you have conquered the sense of shame!\nPerhaps you are entitled by your merit, and I believe you are, to a\nricher and a better wife than Melinda; but take my word for it, she is\nnot to be won at that rate;--or, if you are so lucky as to carry her,\nbetween you and me, you may say, as Teague said, By my soul, I have\ngained a loss! She would take care to spend her fortune in a twinkling,\nand soon make you sick of her extravagance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was alarmed by his discourse, while I resented the freedom of it, and\nexpressed my disgust by telling him, he was mistaken in my intentions,\nand desiring he would give me leave to regulate my conduct according to\nthe dictates of my own reason. He made no apology for the liberty he\nhad taken, and ascribed it to the warmth of his friendship for me; as an\nuncommon instance of which he borrowed five guineas, assuring me there\nwere very few people in the world who whom he could so far favour with\nhis confidence. I gave him the money, and professed myself so well\nconvinced of his sincerity, that he had no occasion to put it to such\nextraordinary proofs for the future. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto have\nasked five pieces more, but hearing you were bubbled of eighteen last\nnight, I presumed you might be out of cash, and resolved to model my\ndemand accordingly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could not help admiring the cavalier behaviour\nof this spark, of whom I desired to know his reason for saying I was\nbubbled. He then gave me to understand, that before he came to my\nlodgings, he had beat up Tom Tossle, who, being present, informed him of\nthe particulars, rehearsed all the fine things I said to Melinda, with\nwhich he proposed to entertain the town, and among other circumstances,\nassured him my mistress cheated with so little art, that nobody but a\nmere novice could be imposed upon.\n\nThe thoughts of becoming a subject of raillery for coxcombs, and losing\nmy money to boot, stung me to the quick; but I made a virtue of my\nindignation, and swore that no man should with impunity either asperse\nthe character of Melinda, or turn my behaviour into ridicule. He replied\nin a dry manner, that I would find it a Herculean task to chastise\neverybody who should laugh at my expense; and, as for the character\nof Melinda, he did not see how it could suffer by what was laid to her\ncharge; for that cheating at cards, far from being reckoned a blemish\namong people of fashion, was looked upon as an honourable indication of\nsuperior genius and address. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut let us waive this subject,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand go to the coffee-house, in order to make a party for dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nWe repair to the coffee-house, where we overhear a curious dispute\nbetween Wagtail and Medlar, which is referred to our decision--the\nDoctor gives an account of his experiment--Medlar is roasted by Banter\nat the ordinary--the old gentleman's advice to me\n\nBeing as willing to drop the theme as he was to propose it, I\naccompanied him thither, where we found Mr. Medlar and Dr. Wagtail\ndisputing upon the word Custard, which the physician affirmed should\nbe spelt with a G, observing that it was derived from the Latin\nverb gustare, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto taste;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but Medlar pleaded custom in behalf of C,\nobserving, that, by the Doctor's rule, we ought to change pudding into\nbudding, because it is derived from the French word boudin; and in that\ncase why not retain the original orthography and pronunciation of all\nthe foreign words we have adopted, by which means our language would\nbecome a dissonant jargon without standard or propriety? The controversy\nwas referred to us; and Banter, notwithstanding his real opinion to\nthe contrary, decided it in favour of Wagtail; upon which the peevish\nannuitant arose, and uttering the monosyllable pish! with great\nemphasis, removed to another table.\n\nWe then inquired of the doctor, what progress he had made in the\nexperiment of distilling tinder-water; and he told us he had been at all\nthe glass-houses about town, but could find nobody who would undertake\nto blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the quantity\nprescribed; but he intended to try the process on as much as would\nproduce five drops, which would be sufficient to prove the specific,\nand then he would make it a parliamentary affair; that he had already\npurchased a considerable weight of rags, in reducing which to tinder, he\nhad met with a misfortune, which had obliged him to change his lodgings;\nfor he had gathered them in a heap on the floor, and set fire to them\nwith a candle, on the supposition that the boards would sustain no\ndamage, because it is the nature of flame to ascend; but, by some very\nextraordinary accident, the wood was invaded, and began to blaze with\ngreat violence, which disordered him so much, that he had not the\npresence of mind enough to call for assistance, and the whole house must\nhave been consumed with him in the midst of it, had not the smoke that\nrolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the neighbourhood, and\nbrought people to his succour: that he had lost a pair of black velvet\nbreeches and a tie-wig in the hurry, besides the expense of the rags,\nwhich were rendered useless by the water used to quench the flame, and\nthe damage of the floor, which he was compelled to repair; that his\nlandlord, believing him distracted, had insisted on his quitting\nhis apartment at a minute's warning, and he was put to incredible\ninconvenience; but now he was settled in a very comfortable house, and\nhad the use of a large paved yard for preparing his tinder; so that he\nhoped in a very short time to reap the fruits of his labour.\n\nAfter having congratulated the doctor on his prospect, and read the\npapers, we repaired to an auction of pictures, where we entertained\nourselves an hour or two; from thence we adjourned to the Mall, and,\nafter two or three turns, went back to dinner, Banter assuring us, that\nhe intended to roast Medlar at the ordinary; and, indeed, we were no\nsooner set than this cynic began to execute his purpose, by telling\nthe old gentleman that he looked extremely well, considering the little\nsleep he had enjoyed last night. To this compliment Medlar made no\nreply, but by a stare, accompanied with a significant grin; and Banter\nwent on thus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know whether most to admire the charity of your\nmind, or the vigour of your body. Upon my soul, Mr. Medlar, you do\ngenerous things with the best taste of any man I know! You extend your\ncompassion to real objects, and exact only such returns as they are\ncapable of making. You must know, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, turning to the\ncompany, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had been up most part of the night with a friend who is ill\nof a fever, and, on my return home this morning, chanced to pass by\na gin shop still open, whence issued a confused sound of mirth and\njollity: upon which, I popped in my head, and perceived Mr. Medlar\ndancing bareheaded in the midst of ten or twenty ragged bunters,\nwho rejoiced at his expense. But indeed, Mr. Medlar, you should not\nsacrifice your constitution to your benevolence. Consider, you grow old\napace; and, therefore, have a reverend care of your health, which must\ncertainly be very much impaired by these nocturnal expeditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\ntesty senior could no longer contain himself, but cried hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis\nwell known that your tongue is no slanderer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou might spare that observation, as you are very sensible, that my\ntongue has done you signal service on many occasions. You may remember,\nthat, when you made your addresses to the fat widow who kept a\npublic-house at Islington, there was a report spread very much to the\nprejudice of your manhood, which coming to the ears of your\nmistress, you were discarded immediately: and I brought matters to a\nreconciliation, by assuring her you had three bastards at nurse in the\ncountry. How you ruined your own affair afterwards, it is neither my\nbusiness nor inclination to relate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis anecdote, which had no other foundation than in Banter's own\ninvention, afforded a good deal of mirth to everybody present, and\nprovoked Mr. Medlar beyond all sufferance; so that he started up in a\nmighty passion, and, forgetting that his mouth was full, bespattered\nthose who sat next to him, while he discharged his indignation in a\nvolley of oaths, and called Banter insignificant puppy, impertinent\njackanapes, and a hundred such appellations; telling the company he had\ninvented these false and malicious aspersions, because he would not lend\nhim money to squander away upon rooks and whores. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA very likely story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Banter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I should attempt to borrow money of a man who is\nobliged to practise a thousand shifts to make his weekly allowance hold\nout till Saturday night. Sometimes he sleeps four-and-twenty hours at\na stretch, by which means he saves three meals, besides coffee-house\nexpense. Sometimes he is fain to put up with bread and cheese and small\nbeer for dinner; and sometimes he regales on twopennyworth of ox cheek\nin a cellar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a lying miscreant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Medlar, in an ecstacy\nof rage; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can always command money enough to pay your tailor's bill,\nwhich I am sure is no trifle; and I have a good mind to give you a\nconvincing proof of my circumstances, by prosecuting you for defamation,\nsirrah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By this time the violence of his wrath had deprived him of his\nappetite, and he sat silent, unable to swallow one mouthful, while\nhis tormentor enjoyed his mortification, and increased his chagrin, by\nadvising him to lay in plentifully for his next day's fast.\n\nDinner being ended, we came down stairs to the coffee room, and Banter\nwent away to keep an appointment, saying, he supposed he should see\nWagtail and me in the evening at the Bedford Coffee-house. He was no\nsooner gone than the old gentleman took me aside, and said, he was\nsorry to see me so intimate with that fellow, who was one of the most\ngraceless rakes about town, and had already wasted a good estate and\nconstitution upon harlots; that he had been the ruin of many a young\nman, by introducing them into debauched company, and setting a lewd\nexample of all manner of wickedness; and that, unless I were on\nmy guard, he would strip me in a short time both of my money and\nreputation. I thanked him for his information, and promised to conduct\nmyself accordingly, wishing, however, his caution had been a few\nhours more early, by which means I might have saved five guineas.\nNotwithstanding this intelligence, I was inclinable to impute some part\nof the charge to Medlar's revenge for the liberties taken with him at\ndinner; and therefore, as soon as I could disengage myself, applied\nto Wagtail for his opinion of the character in question, resolved to\ncompare their accounts, allowing for the prejudice of each, and to form\nmy judgment upon both, without adhering strictly to either. The doctor\nassured me, that he was a very pretty gentleman of family and fortune;\na scholar, a wit, a critic, and perfectly well acquainted with the\ntown; that his honour and courage were unquestionable, though some\nextravagances he had been guilty of, and his talents for satire had\nprocured him enemies, and made some people shy of his acquaintance. From\nthese different sketches, I concluded that Banter was a young fellow of\nsome parts, who had spent his fortune, but retained his appetites, and\nfallen out with the world, because he could not enjoy it to his wish.\n\nI went to the Bedford Coffee-house in the evening, where I met my\nfriends, from thence proceeded to the play, and afterwards carried them\nhome to my lodgings, where we supped in great good humour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nI receive a Challenge--the Consequence of it--the Quarrel being made\nup, am put in Arrest by the Care and Affection of Strap--but immediately\nreleased upon explaining my Affair--the Behaviour of Mr. Oregan and\nhis two Friends--I visit Melinda, whom I divert with an account of the\nDuel--propose Marriage--she refers the Matter to her Mother, of whom\nI make a solemn Demand of her Daughter--the old Lady's behaviour--I am\ndiscarded---resent their Disdain\n\nWhen I was ready to go abroad next day, Strap brought me a letter,\nTo Mr. Random, Esq., these; which, upon opening, I found contained a\nchallenge conceived in these very extraordinary terms:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,--Whereas I am informed that you make love to Miss Melinda\nGoosetrap, this is to let you know that she is under promise of marriage\nto me; and that I am at this present waiting at the back of Montague\nHouse, with a pair of good pistols in my hand; and if you will keep your\nappointment, I will make your tongue confess (after the breath is out\nof your body) that you do not deserve her so well as Yours, etc. Rourk\nOregan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI guessed, from the style and superscription of this billet, that my\nrival was a true Milesian, and was not a little uneasy at the contents;\nespecially that part, in which he asserted his right to my mistress by\npromise, a circumstance I did not not know how to reconcile to her good\nsense and penetration. However, this was no time for me to decline\nthe defiance, because the success of my addresses in a great measure\ndepended upon my behaviour in that affair. I therefore immediately\nloaded my pistols, and betook myself in a hackney coach to the place\nappointed, where I found a tall raw-boned man, with a hard-featured\ncountenance and black bushy beard, walking by himself, wrapped up in a\nshabby green coat, over which his own hair descended in leathern\nqueue from his head, that was covered with a greasy hat trimmed with a\ntarnished pointe d'Espagne. He had no sooner perceived me advancing than\nhe pulled a pistol from his bosom, and, presenting it at me, snapped it\nwithout the least preamble. Alarmed at this rude salutation, I made a\nstand, and, before he could adjust his other piece, fired one of mine\nat him, without doing any damage, By this time he was ready with his\nsecond, that flashed in the pan without going off; upon which he called,\nwith a true Tipperary cadence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire away, honey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and began to hammer\nhis flint with great deliberation. But I was resolved to make use of\nthe advantage fortune had given me, and therefore stepped up without\nthrowing away my fire, desiring him to ask his life, or prepare for\nanother world; but this stout Hibernian refused to condescend, and\ncomplained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before he could\nreturn my shot: saying I ought to go back to my station, and let him\nhave an equal chance with me. I endeavoured to persuade him that I had\ngiven him a double chance already: and it was my business to prevent him\nfrom enjoying a third; but now, since I had an opportunity, I demanded\na parley, and desired to know his condition and reason for calling me to\nthe field, who, to the best of my remembrance, far from having done\nhim any injury, had never before seen him. He told me that he was\na gentleman of fortune, who had spent all he had, and, hearing that\nMelinda had got ten thousand pounds, he intended to make himself master\nof that sum by espousing her, and he was determined, in an honourable\nway, to cut the throats of all those who stood between him and his\nhopes.\n\nI then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; and now that I\nhad seen him, being more and more astonished at the circumstance of\nthe promise, desired that he would explain that mystery. He gave me to\nunderstand, that he trusted entirely to his birth and personal merit;\nthat he had frequently written to Melinda, setting forth his claim and\npretensions, but she was never kind enough to send an answer, or even\nto admit him into her presence; and that the promise he mentioned in his\nletter was made by his friend Mr. Gahagan, who assured him that no woman\ncould resist a man of his appearance. I could not forbear laughing to\nexcess at the simplicity of my rival, who did not seem to relish my\nmirth, but began to be very serious: upon which I endeavoured to appease\nhim, by giving him my word and honour that, far from prejudicing\nhis addresses to the lady, I would represent him to her in the most\nfavourable light I could with any regard to truth; but he must not be\nsurprised if she should remain blind to his deserts, for nothing was\nmore capricious than a woman's mind, and the affection of that sex was\nseldom purchased with virtue alone. That my declaration might have the\nbetter effect, I took notice of his deshabille, and, professing sorrow\nat seeing a gentleman reduced, slipped two guineas into his hand, at\nsight of which he threw away his pistols, and hugging me in his arms,\ncried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cArrah, by Jasus, now, you are the best friend I have met\nwith these seven long years!\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I had suffered some minutes in his\nembrace, he quitted me, and picking up his rusty arms, wished the devil\nmight burn him if ever he should give me any further trouble about\nwomankind.\n\nThe quarrel being thus amicably composed, I begged leave to look at his\npistols, which I found so crazy and so foul, that I believe it was happy\nfor him neither of them was discharged, for one of them would certainly\nhave split in the going off, and he would, in all probability, have lost\nhis hand in the explosion; but what gave me a lively idea of the man's\ncharacter was, to find, upon examination, that one of them had been\nloaded without being primed, and the other primed without a charge.\n\nWhile we walked home together, I expressed a desire of knowing my new\nfriend's history; and he informed me of his having served in the German\narmy as a volunteer against the Turks; that for his behaviour at the\nsiege of Belgrade, he had been honoured with an ensign's commission, and\nafterwards promoted to the rank of lieutenant, in which station it was\nhis misfortune to affront his captain, who challenged him to the field,\nand was killed in the duel, upon which he was obliged to retreat; that\nhe had been in England some years soliciting his friends for provision\nin the British army; but being hitherto unsuccessful, was desired by Mr.\nGahagan to turn his thoughts to matrimony, and make his fortune by an\nadvantageous match; in consequence of which advice, he had made up to\nMelinda: and, having heard by means of an Irish footman in the family,\nthat I was her chief favourite, had called me out in hopes of removing\nby my death the greatest obstruction to his desires; but now he was\nconvinced of my honour and generosity, he swore by the blessed Virgin,\nhe would think of her no more, if there were not another woman in the\nworld. As a further proof of his veracity, which I did not at all doubt,\nhe opened an old iron snuff-box, and pulled out his commission in\nthe Imperial army, and his captain's challenge, which he preserved as\ntestimonials of his character. I was so well convinced of this poor\nman's honesty and courage, that I determined to speak in his behalf\nto some of my acquaintance, who might recommend his case to the\nconsideration of those who could provide for him; and in the meantime\nto accommodate him with a few clothes, by which his appearance would be\nmuch mended, and himself enabled to renew his solicitations in person.\n\nAs we walked along conversing socially together, we were met by a file\nof musketeers, and Strap at their head, who no sooner approached than,\nwith a frantic look, he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeize them! In the name of God seize\nthem!\u00e2\u0080\u009d We were accordingly surrounded, and I put in arrest by the\ncorporal, who was commanding officer; but Captain Oregan disengaged\nhimself, and ran with such speed towards Tottenham Court Road that he\nwas out of sight in a moment. When my arms were delivered up, and myself\nsecured, Strap became a little more composed, and asked pardon for the\nliberty he had taken, which he hoped I would excuse, as it proceeded\nfrom his affection. He then told me that, suspecting the letter (which\nby the by was brought by the author himself) contained something\nextraordinary, he had peeped through the keyhole, and seen me load my\npistols; upon which he ran down to Whitehall, and applied to the officer\non guard for a party to put me in arrest, but before he returned, I\nwas gone in a coach; that he had inquired which way I went, and, having\nheard that duels were commonly fought at the back of Montague House, he\nconducted the guard to this place, where he thanked God for having found\nme safe and sound. I gave him to understand that I forgave his officious\nconcern for once, but cautioned him in pretty severe terms for making\nme the subject of idle conversation for the future; then turning to the\ncorporal, thanked him for his care, and gave him a crown to drink with\nhis men, assuring him that the rencontre was over long before he\ncame up, and everything compromised, as he might have observed by our\nbehaviour; as a farther proof of which, he would find upon examination\nthat one of my pistols had been discharged: but this civil person,\nwithout giving himself or me any farther trouble, received the bounty\nwith a thousand bows and acknowledgments, and, returning the pistols,\nreleased me immediately.\n\nHe was not gone a hundred yards, when my friend Oregan came up in order\nto rescue me, with two tatterdemalions, whom he had engaged for that\npurpose about the purlieus of St. Giles's. One of them was armed with\na musket that wanted a lock, and another with a rusty broadsword, but\ntheir dress surpassed all description. When he understood I was already\nfree he made an apology for his abrupt departure, and introduced me to\nhis two companions: First, to Counsellor Fitzclabber, who, he told me,\nwas then employed in compiling a history of the kings of Minster,\nfrom Irish manuscripts; and then to his friend Mr. Gahagan, who was a\nprofound philosopher and politician, and had projected many excellent\nschemes for the good of his country. But it seems these literati had\nbeen very ill rewarded for their ingenious labours; for, between them\nboth, there was but one shirt, and half a pair of breeches. I thanked\nthem very kindly for their readiness to assist me, and, having offered\nmy service in my turn, bade them good morrow, desiring Oregan to\naccompany me to my lodgings, where he was fitted with decent clothes\nfrom my wardrobe, so much to his satisfaction, that he swore eternal\ngratitude and friendship to me, and, at my request, recounted all the\nadventures of his life.\n\nIn the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who received me with great\nkindness and familiarity, and laughed excessively at my adventure with\nthe Irishman, to whose wishes she was no stranger, having more than\na dozen letters in her possession, which he had written to her on the\nsubject of love, and which, for my entertainment, she submitted to\nmy perusal. Having made ourselves merry at the expense of this poor\nadmirer, I seized the opportunity of her mother's going out of the room,\nand introduced my own passion, which I recommended to her with all\nthe ardour and eloquence I was master of. I flattered, sighed, swore,\nentreated, and acted a thousand extravagancies, in hopes of making\nsome impression on her heart; but she heard everything I said without\ndiscovering the least emotion; and other company came in before she\nwould vouchsafe one serious reply. After tea, the cards were brought in\naccording to custom, and it was my good fortune to have Melinda for my\npartner; by which means, instead of losing, I came off with five guineas\nclear gain.\n\nI soon became acquainted with a good many people of fashion, and spent\nmy time in the modish diversions of the town, such as plays, operas,\nmasquerades, drums, assemblies, and muppet-shows; chiefly in company\nwith Melinda, whom I cultivated with all the eagerness and address that\nmy prospect could inspire, and my education afford. I spared neither\nmy person nor my purse to gratify her vanity and pride; my rivals were\nintimidated, and indeed outshone; and, after all, I began to fear that\nthe dear creature had not a heart to lose.\n\nAt last, finding myself unable to support the expense of this amour\nmuch longer, I was determined to bring the matter to a crisis; and\none evening, while we were together by ourselves, complained of her\nindifference, described the tortures of suspense to a love-sick mind,\nand pressed her to disclose her sentiments of matrimony and me with such\nearnestness, that she could not, with all her art, shift the subject,\nbut was obliged to come to an eclaircissement. She told me, with a\ncareless air, that she had no objection to my person, and if I could\nsatisfy her mother in other particulars, I should not find her averse\nto the match; but she was resolved to do nothing in such a momentous\nconcern without the advice and consent of her parent. This was no very\nagreeable declaration to me, whose aim had been to win her inclination\nfirst, and then secure my conquest by a private marriage, to which I\nflattered myself she would express no reluctance. That I might not,\nhowever, desert my cause before it was desperate, I waited on her\nmother; and, with great formality, demanded the daughter in marriage.\nThe good lady, who was a very notable woman, behaved with great state\nand civility; thanked me for the honour I intended her family; and said,\nshe did not doubt that I was in all respects qualified to make a woman\nhappy; but it concerned her as a parent anxious about the welfare of\nher child, to inquire into the particulars of my fortune, and know what\nsettlement I proposed to make. To this intimation, which would have\nutterly disconcerted me if I had not expected it, I replied, without\nhesitation that, though my fortune was very small, I was a gentleman\nby birth and education, would maintain her daughter in the sphere of\na gentlewoman, and settle her own dowry on her and her heirs for ever.\nThis careful matron did not seem to relish my proposal, but observed,\nwith a demure countenance, that there was no necessity for settling that\nupon her child which was her own already; however, if I pleased, her\nlawyer should confer with mine upon the matter; and, in the meantime,\nshe desired I would favour her with a perusal of my rent-roll.\nNotwithstanding the vexation I was under, I could scarce forbear\nlaughing in her face at the mention of my rent-roll, which was indeed\na severe piece of satire upon my pretensions. I frankly owned I had no\nlanded estate; and told her that I could not exactly specify the sum I\nwas master of, until I had regulated my affairs, which were at present\nin some disorder; but that I would take an opportunity of satisfying her\non that head very soon.\n\nIt was not long before I took my leave, and returned to my lodgings in\na very melancholy mood, persuaded that I had nothing more to expect from\nthat quarter. I was confirmed in this opinion next day, when I went back\nwith a view of explaining myself more fully to the old gentlewoman; and\nwas told by the footman that his ladies were not at home, although I had\nseen Melinda through the blinds at a parlour window, as I went up to the\ndoor. Incensed at this affront, I quitted the door without saying one\nword, and as I repassed the parlour, bowed to Miss, who still remained\nin the same situation, securely screened, as she thought, from my view.\n\nThis disappointment gave me more uneasiness on Strap's account than\nmy own, for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the\ncontrary, the remembrance of my charming Narcissa was a continual check\nupon my conscience during the whole course of my addresses; and perhaps\ncontributed to the bad success of my scheme, by controlling my raptures\nand condemning my design.\n\nThere was a necessity for informing my companion of everything that\nhappened to me and I performed this piece of duty in an affected\npassion, swearing I would be his pack-horse no longer, and desiring him\nto take the management of his affairs into his own hands. This finesse\nhad the desired effect, for, instead of grumbling over my miscarriage,\nStrap was frightened at the passion I feigned, and begged me, for the\nlove of God, to be appeased; observing that, although we had suffered a\ngreat loss, it was not irreparable; and if Fortune frowned to day, she\nmight perhaps smile to-morrow. I pretended to acquiesce in his remarks,\npraise his equanimity, and promised to improve my misfortune. He, on the\nother hand, pretended to be perfectly well satisfied with my conduct,\nand conjured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection; but, in\nspite of all his affectation, I could perceive his inward affliction,\nand his visage sensibly increased in longitude from that day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nI long to be revenged on Melinda--apply to Banter for his Assistance--he\ncontrives a scheme for that purpose--which is put in Execution with\ngreat Success--I make an Attempt upon the Heart of Miss Gripewell, but\nam disappointed--grow melancholy at my Disappointment, and have\nrecourse to the Bottle--receive a Billet-doux--am ravished with the\nContents--find myself involved in Intrigue, which I imagined would make\nmy Fortune--am confounded at my mistake, which banishes all Thoughts of\nMatrimony\n\nIn the meantime, my attention was wholly engrossed in search of another\nmistress, and the desire of being revenged on Melinda, in both which\nschemes I was very much assisted by Billy Chatter, who was such a\nnecessary creature among the ladies, that in all private dances he\nengaged the men. To him therefore I applied, desiring he would introduce\nme to a partner of some figure, at the next private assembly, for the\nsake of a frolic, the intention of which I would afterwards communicate.\nBilly, who had heard something of a difference between Melinda and me,\nimmediately smoked part of my design, and, thinking I only wanted to\nalarm her jealousy a little, promised to gratify my desire, by matching\nme with a partner worth thirty thousand pounds, whom the ladies of this\nend of the town had lately taken under their management and protection.\nUpon further inquiry, I found this person's name was Miss Biddy\nGripewell; that her father, who had been a pawnbroker, died intestate,\nby which means all his substance descended to his daughter, who was so\nlittle a favourite that, could the old man have prevailed with his own\nrapacious disposition to part with as much money as would have paid the\nexpense of a will, she would not have inherited the sixth part of his\nfortune; that during his life, far from being educated in a way suitable\nto such great expectations, she was obliged to live like a servant\nwench, and do the most menial offices in the family. But his funeral was\nno sooner performed, than she assumed the fine lady, and found so many\npeople of both sexes to flatter, caress, and instruct her, that, for\nwant of discretion and experience, she was grown insufferably vain and\narrogant, and pretended to no less than a duke or earl at least for\nher husband; that she had the misfortune to be neglected by the English\nquality, but a certain poor Scottish lord was then making interest to be\nintroduced to her acquaintance. In the meantime, she was fallen into the\nhands of a notable lady, who had already disposed of her to a lieutenant\nof foot, a distant relation of her ladyship's, though Miss as yet knew\nnothing of the affair; and lastly that if I proposed to dance with her,\nI must give him leave to represent me as a knight, or foreign count at\nleast. I was ravished at this piece of information, and consented for\none night, to personate a French marquis, that I might the easier fulfil\nmy revenge.\n\nHaving made the appointment with Chatter I went to Banter's lodgings,\nas I had by this time conceived a great opinion of his penetration\nand knowledge; and, after I had enjoined secrecy, told him every\ncircumstance of my disgrace with Melinda, and imparted the plan I\nhad projected to mortify that proud coquette, desiring his advice in\nproving, and assistance in executing the scheme. Nothing could be more\nagreeable to his misanthropical temper than an account of her behaviour\nand my resentment: he applauded my resolution, and proposed that I\nshould not only provide myself with a proper partner, but also procure\nsuch a one for Miss Goosetrap, as should infallibly entail upon her\nthe ridicule of all her acquaintance. For this purpose he mentioned his\nbarber who he said, was an exceeding coxcomb lately come from Paris,\nwhose absurd affectation and grimace, would easily pass upon her for the\nsprightly politesse of a gentleman improved by travel. I hugged him for\nthis hint; and he assured me it would be no difficult matter to make him\nbelieve, that Melinda, having seen him by accident, was captivated by\nhis appearance, and begged for his acquaintance. He actually engaged him\non this pretence, and painted his good fortune in such colours that the\npoor shaver was quite beside himself with joy. He was immediately\nfitted with a tawdry suit of clothes belonging to Banter, and by him\nrecommended to Chatter as a very pretty fellow, just returned from his\ntravels. Master Billy, who acted as a gentleman usher to a great many of\nthe fair sex in and about town, undertook at once to bespeak Melinda in\nhis behalf; and everything happened according to my wish.\n\nAt the time appointed I appeared dressed to the best advantage; and, in\nthe character of a Marquis, had the honour of opening the ball with\nthe rich heiress, who attracted the eyes of the whole company by the\nprodigious number of jewels with which she was adorned. Among others I\nperceived Melinda, who could not more conceal her envy than astonishment\nat my success; her curiosity was still more flagrant and tormenting, for\nshe had never seen Miss Gripewell before; and Chatter, who alone could\ngive her any satisfaction on that head, was engaged in conversation at\nthe other end of the room. I observed her impatience, and exulted in her\nchagrin; and after my partner was set, took the opportunity of passing\nby her to make a slight bow without stopping, which completed my triumph\nand her indignation. She changed colour, bridled up, assumed an air of\ndisdain, and flirted her fan with such a fury, that it went to pieces\nin a moment, to the no small entertainment of those who sat near and\nobserved her.\n\nAt length the metamorphosed barber took her out, and acted his part with\nsuch ridiculous extravagance that the mirth of the whole company was\nexcited at his expense, and his partner was so much ashamed that, before\nthe country dances began, she retired in great confusion, under pretence\nof being taken suddenly ill, and was followed by her gallant, who no\ndoubt imagined her indisposition was nothing but love; and laid hold of\nthe occasion of conducting her home, to comfort her, with an assurance\nof his entertaining a reciprocal passion. They were no sooner gone than\nan inquisitive whisper of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d ran round the room; and Chatter\ncould give them no other intelligence about him than that he was a man\nof fortune just returned from his travels. I, who alone was acquainted\nwith his real quality, affected ignorance well knowing that female\ncuriosity would not rest satisfied with such a general account, and that\nthe discovery would proceed with a better grace from anybody than me.\n\nMeanwhile, I was tempted by the richness of the prize to practise upon\nMiss Gripewell's heart, but soon found it too well fortified with pride\nand indifference to yield to any efforts in my own character, and I\nneither would nor could preserve the title I had borrowed longer than\nthat night.\n\nAs I expected, everything came to light next day. The barber, in pure\nsimplicity of heart, detected himself to Melinda, and discovered the\nfoundation of his hopes; she sickened at the affront, and was ashamed to\nshow her face in public for many weeks after this accident. Poor Chatter\nfound it impossible to justify himself to her satisfaction; was in\nutter disgrace with Miss Gripewell, for having imposed me upon her as\na nobleman; and suffered very much in his character and influence among\nthe ladies in general.\n\nFinding my finances diminished more than one-half, and my project as\nlittle advanced as on the first day of my arrival in town, I began\nto despair of my success, and grew melancholy at the prospect of\napproaching want. To dispel the horrors of this fiend I had recourse\nto the bottle, and kept more company than ever. I became particularly\nattached to the playhouse, conversed with the actors behind the scenes,\ngrew acquainted with a body of templars, and in a short time commenced a\nprofessed wit and critic. Indeed, I may say, without vanity, that I was\nmuch better qualified than any one of my companions, who were, generally\nspeaking, of all the creatures I ever conversed with, the most ignorant\nand assuming. By means of these avocations I got the better of care,\nand learned to separate my ideas in such a manner that, whenever I was\nattacked by a gloomy reflection, I could shove it aside, and call in\nsome agreeable reverie to my assistance. This was not the case with\nStrap, who practised a thousand shifts to conceal the sorrow that preyed\nupon his carcass, and reduced him to the resemblance of a mere skeleton.\n\nWhile I thus posted, in a thoughtless manner, towards poverty, I one\nday received, by the penny post, a letter written in a woman's hand,\ncontaining a great many high-flown compliments, warm protestations of\nlove, couched in a very poetical style, an earnest desire of knowing\nwhether or not my heart was engaged, by leaving an answer at a certain\nplace, directed to R. B., and the whole subscribed \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour incognita.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nwas transported with joy on reading the contents of this billet-doux,\nwhich I admired as a masterpiece of tenderness and elegance, and was\nalready up to my ears in love with the author, whom my imagination\nrepresented as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of youth and beauty.\nElevated with this conjecture, I went to work, and exhausted my\ninvention in composing an answer suitable to the sublimity of her style\nand the ardour of her sentiments. I expressed my admiration of her wit\nin terms the most hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged myself unworthy\nof her regard, declared myself enamoured of her understanding; and in\nthe most pathetic manner implored the honour of an interview. Having\nfinished this performance, and communicated it to Strap, who skipped\nabout for joy, I dispatched him with it to the place appointed, which\nwas the house of a milliner not far from Bond Street, and desired him\nto keep watch near the door for some time, that he might discover the\nperson who should call for it. In less than an hour he returned with a\njoyful countenance, and told me that, soon after he had delivered the\nletter, a chairman was called, to whom it was given, with directions to\ncarry it to the house of a rich gentleman in the neighbourhood,\nwhither he (Strap) followed him, and saw him put it into the hands of\na waiting-woman, who paid the messenger, and shut the door; that, upon\ninquiry at an alehouse hard by, where he called for a pint of beer,\nhe understood the gentleman to whom the house belonged had an only\ndaughter, very handsome, who would inherit his whole estate; and who\ncertainly was the author of the billet I had received. I was of the same\nopinion, and, hugging myself in the happy prospect, dressed immediately,\nand passed in great state the house that contained my unknown admirer.\nNor was my vanity disappointed; for I perceived a beautiful young\ncreature standing at one of the windows of the dining-room, who, I\nimagined, observed me with more than common curiosity. That I might\nindulge her view, and at the same time feast my own, I affected to stop,\nand gave orders to Strap, in the street, just opposite to her station,\nby which means I had an opportunity of seeing her more distinctly,\nand of congratulating myself on having made a conquest of so much\nperfection. In a few moments she retired, and I betook myself to the\nordinary in a rapture of hope, which deprived me of my appetite for that\nmeal, and sent me home in the evening to indulge my contemplation.\n\nEarly next day, I was favoured with another epistle from my unknown\nadmirer, signifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which,\nwhile it made a tender of my heart, convinced her of the value of it.\nAbove all things, she professed her extreme pleasure in finding me\nso much attached to her understanding, a circumstance that not only\nflattered her in the most sensible part, but at the same time argued\nmy own sagacity. As for the interview I desired, she assured me, that I\ncould not be more eager for such an occasion than she; but she must not\nonly sacrifice little more to decorum, but be satisfied of my honourable\nintentions, before she could grant that request. Meanwhile she gave me\nto understand that, although she might owe some deference to the opinion\nof certain persons, she was resolved, in an affair that so nearly\nconcerned her happiness, to consult her own inclination, preferable\nto the advice of the whole world; especially as she was urged to such\ncondescension by no consideration of fortune, what she depended upon\nbeing her own without restriction or control. Struck with admiration at\nthe philosophy and self-denial of my mistress, who seemed insensible of\nthe beauty she possessed, and in particular ravished with that piece of\nintelligence by which I learned her fortune was independent; I resumed\nthe pen, launched out into encomiums on the dignity of her sentiments,\naffected to undervalue the charms of external beauty, pretended to\nground my passion on the qualities of her mind, complained of her rigour\nin sacrificing my repose to an overscrupulous regard to decorum, and\ndeclared the purity of my designs in the most solemn and pathetic\nvows. This performance being sealed and directed, was sent to the place\nappointed by Strap, who, that we might be still the more confirmed in\nour belief, renewed his watch, and in a little time brought back the\nsame information as before, with this addition, that Miss Sparkle (the\nname of my correspondent), looking out at the window, no sooner saw\nthe messenger arrive, than she shut the casement in a sort of beautiful\nconfusion, and disappeared, eager no doubt to hear from the dear object\nof her love.\n\nMy doubts now vanished, the long-expected port appeared, and I looked\nupon myself as perfectly secure of that happiness I had been in quest of\nso long. After dinner, I sauntered in company with Dr. Wagtail, to that\npart of the town in which my inamorata lived; and, as he was a mere\nregister, inquired of him into the name, character, and fortune of\neverybody who possessed a good house in the streets through which\nwe passed. When it came to his turn to mention Sir John Sparkle, he\nrepresented him as a man of an immense estate and narrow disposition,\nwho mewed up his only child, a fine young lady, from the conversation of\nmankind, under the strict watch and inspection of an old governante, who\nwas either so honest, envious, or insatiable, that nobody had been\nas yet able to make her a friend, or get access to her charge,\nthough numbers attempted it every day; not so much on account of her\nexpectations from her father, who, being a widower, might marry again\nand have sons, as for a fortune of twelve thousand pounds left her by an\nuncle, of which she could not be deprived. This piece of news, exactly\ntallying with the last part of the letter I had been honoured with in\nthe morning, had such an effect on me, that any man except Wagtail might\nhave observed my emotion; but his attention was too much engrossed by\nthe contemplation of his own importance to suffer him to be affected\nwith the deportment of any other body, unless it happened to be so\nparticular that he could not help taking notice of it.\n\nWhen I had disengaged myself from him, whose conversation grew insipid\nto me, I went home, and made Strap acquainted with the fruit of my\nresearches. This faithful squire was almost choked with transport, and\neven wept with joy; but whether on account of himself or me, I shall not\npretend to determine. Next day a third billet-doux was brought to me,\ncontaining many expressions of tenderness, mingled with some affecting\ndoubts about the artifice of man, the inconstancy of youth, and the\njealousy often attending the most sincere passion; withal desiring\nI would excuse her, if she should try me a little longer, before she\ndeclared herself beyond the power of retracting. These interesting\nscruples added fuel to my flame and impatience to my hope; I redoubled\nmy complaints of her indifference, and pressed her to an assignation\nwith such fervent entreaties, that in a few days she consented to meet\nme at the house of that milliner who had forwarded all my letters.\nDuring the interval between the date of her promise and the hour of\nappointment, my pride soared beyond all reason and description; I lost\nall remembrance of the gentle Narcissa, and my thoughts were wholly\nemployed in planning triumphs over the malice and contempt of the world.\n\nAt length the happy hour arrived. I flew to the place of rendezvous,\nand was conducted into an apartment, where I had not waited ten minutes,\nwhen I heard the rustling of silk, and the sound of feet ascending the\nstairs; my heart took the alarm, and beat quick; my cheeks glowed, my\nnerves thrilled, and my knees shook with ecstacy! I perceived the door\nopening, saw a gold brocade petticoat advance, and sprang forward to\nembrace my charmer. Heaven and earth! how shall I paint my situation,\nwhen I found Miss Sparkle converted into a wrinkled hag turned of\nseventy! I was struck dumb with amazement, and petrified with horror!\nThis ancient Urganda, perceived my disorder, and, approaching with a\nlanguishing air, seized my hand, asking in a squeaking tone, if I\nwas indisposed. Her monstrous affectation completed the disgust I had\nconceived for her at her first appearance, and it was a long time before\nI could command myself so much as to behave with common civility: at\nlength, however, I recollected myself, and pronounced an apology for my\nbehaviour, which I said proceeded from a dizziness that seized me all\nof a sudden. My hoary Dulcinea, who, no doubt, had been alarmed at my\nconfusion, no sooner learned the cause to which I now ascribed it, than\nshe discovered her joy in a thousand amorous coquetries, and assumed the\nsprightly airs of a girl of sixteen. One while she ogled me with her dim\neyes, quenched in rheum; then, as if she was ashamed of that freedom,\nshe affected to look down, blush, and play with her fan; then toss her\nhead that I might not perceive a palsy that shook it, ask some childish\nquestions with a lisping accent, giggle and grin with her mouth shut\nto conceal the ravage of time upon her teeth, leer upon me again, sigh\npiteously, fling herself about in her chair to show her agility, and act\na great many more absurdities that youth and beauty can alone excuse.\nShocked as I was at my disappointment, my disposition was incapable of\naffronting any person who loved me; I therefore endeavoured to put a\ngood face to the matter for the present, resolved to drop the whole\naffair as soon as I should get clear of her company; with this view, I\nuttered some civil things, and in particular desired to know the name\nand condition of the lady who had honoured me so much. She told me her\nname was Withers, that she lived with Sir John Sparkle in quality of\ngoverness to his only daughter, in which situation she had picked up\na comfortable sufficiency to make her easy for life; that she had the\npleasure of seeing me at church, where my appearance and deportment made\nsuch an impression upon her heart, that she could enjoy no ease until\nshe had inquired into my character, which she found so amiable in all\nrespects, that she yielded to the violence of her inclination, and\nventured to declare her passion with too little regard perhaps to the\ndecorum of her sex; but she hoped I would forgive a trespass of which\nI myself was in some measure the cause, and impute her intrusion to the\nirresistible dictates of love. No decayed rake ever swallowed a bolus\nwith more reluctance than I felt in making a reply suitable to this\ncompliment, when, instead of the jewel, I found the crazy casket only in\nmy power; and yet my hopes began to revive a little, when I considered,\nthat, by carrying on the appearance of an intrigue with the duenna,\nI might possibly obtain access to her charge. Encouraged by this\nsuggestion, my temper grew more serene, my reserve wore off, I talked\nen cavalier, and even made love to this antiquated coquette, who seemed\nextremely happy in her adorer, and spread all her allurements to make\nher imagined conquest more secure. The good woman of the house treated\nus with tea and sweetmeats, and afterwards withdrew, like a civil\nexperienced matron as she was.\n\nLeft thus to our mutual endearments, Miss Withers (for she was still a\nmaiden) began to talk of matrimony, and expressed so much impatience\nin all her behaviour that, had she been fifty years younger, I might\npossibly have gratified her longing without having recourse to the\nchurch; but this step my virtue as well as interest forbade. When the\ninclinations of an old maid settle upon a young fellow, he is persecuted\nwith her addresses; but, should he once grant her the favour, he\nwill never be able to disentangle himself from her importunities\nand reproaches. It was my business to defer the ceremony as long as\npossible, under the most specious pretences, with a view of becoming\nacquainted with Miss Sparkle in the meantime; and I did not despair of\nsuccess, when I considered, that in the course of our correspondence,\nI should I all probability be invited to visit my mistress in her own\napartment, and by these means have an opportunity of conversing with her\ncharming ward. Pleased with this prospect, my heart dilated with joy;\nI talked in raptures to the state governante, and kissed her shrivelled\nhand with great devotion, She was so much transported with her good\nfortune, that she could not contain her ecstacy, but flew upon me like\na tigress, and pressed her skinny lips to mine; when (as it was no doubt\nconcerted by her evil genius) a dose of garlic she had swallowed that\nmorning, to dispel wind, I suppose, began to operate with such a sudden\nexplosion, that human nature, circumstanced as I was, could not endure\nthe shock with any degree of temper. I lost all patience and reflection,\nflung away from her in an instant, snatched my hat and cane, and ran\ndownstairs as if the devil had me in pursuit, and could scarcely retain\nthe convulsion of my bowels, which were grievously offended by the\nperfume that assaulted me. Strap, who waited my return with impatience,\nseeing me arrive in the utmost disorder, stood motionless with\napprehension, and durst not inquire into the cause.\n\nAfter I had washed my mouth, more than once, and recruited my spirits\nwith a glass of wine, I recounted to him every particular of what had\nhappened; to which he made no other reply for some time than lifting up\nhis eyes, clasping his hands, and uttering a hollow groan. At length he\nobserved, in a melancholy tone, that it was a thousand pities my organs\nwere so delicate as to be offended with the smell of garlic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! God\nhelp us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'tis not the steams of garlic, no, nor of something\nelse, that would give me the least uneasiness--see what it is to be a\ncobler's son!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish then you would go and retrieve\nmy miscarriage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At this suggestion he started, forced a smile, and\nleft the room, shaking his head. Whether the old gentlewoman resented\nmy abrupt departure so much that her love changed into disdain, or was\nashamed to see me on account of her infirmity, I know not; but I was\nnever troubled again with her passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nI cultivate an Acquaintance with two Noblemen--am introduced to earl\nStrutwell--his kind Promise and Invitation--the Behaviour of his\nPorter and Lacquey--he receives me with an Appearance of uncommon\nAffection--undertakes to speak in my Behalf to the Minister--informs\nme of his Success, and wishes me Joy--introduces a Conversation about\nPetronius Arbiter--falls in Love with my Watch, which I press upon\nhim--I make a present of a Diamond Ring to Lord Straddle--impart my good\nFortune to Strap and Banter, who disabuses me, to my utter Mortification\n\nBaffled hitherto in my matrimonial schemes, I began to question my\ntalents for the science of fortune-hunting, and to bend my thoughts\ntowards some employment under the government. With the view of procuring\nwhich, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords Straddle and Swillpot,\nwhose fathers were men of interest at court. I found these young\nnoblemen as open to my advances as I could desire; I accompanied them\nin their midnight rambles, and often dined with them at taverns, where I\nhad the honour of paying the reckoning.\n\nI one day took the opportunity, while I was loaded with protestations of\nfriendship, to disclose my desire of being settled in some sinecure, and\nto solicit their influence in my behalf. Swillpot, squeezing my hand,\nsaid, I might depend upon his service by G--. The other swore that no\nman would be more proud than he to run my errands. Encouraged by these\ndeclarations, I ventured to express an inclination to be introduced to\ntheir fathers, who were able to do my business at once. Swillpot frankly\nowned he had not spoken to his father these three years; and Straddle\nassured me, his father, having lately disobliged the minister by\nsubscribing his name to a protest in the house of peers, was thereby\nrendered incapable of serving his friends at present; but he undertook\nto make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell, who was hand and glove with\na certain person who ruled the roast. This offer I embraced with many\nacknowledgments, and plied him so closely, in spite of a thousand\nevasions, that he found himself under a necessity of keeping his word,\nand actually carried me to the levee of this great man, where he left me\nin a crowd of fellow-dependents, and was ushered to a particular closet\naudience; from whence, in a few minutes, he returned with his lordship,\nwho took me by the hand, assured me he would do me all the service he\ncould, and desired to see me often. I was charmed with my reception,\nand, although I had heard that a courtier's promise is not to be\ndepended upon, I thought I discovered so much sweetness of temper and\ncandour in this earl's countenance, that I did not doubt of finding\nmy account in his protection. I resolved therefore to profit by this\npermission, and waited on him next audience day, when I was favoured\nwith a particular smile, squeeze of the hand, and a whisper, signifying\nthat he wanted half-an-hour's conversation with me in private, when he\nshould be disengaged, and for that purpose desired me to come and drink\na dish of chocolate with him to-morrow morning.\n\nThis invitation, which did not a little flatter my vanity and\nexpectation, I took care to observe, and went to his lordship's house at\nthe time appointed. Having rapped at the gate, the porter unbolted and\nkept it half open, placing himself in the gap, like soldiers in the\nbroach, to dispute my passage. I asked if his lord was stirring? He\nanswered with a surly aspect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt what hour does he commonly\nrise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes sooner, sometimes later,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, closing the\ndoor upon me by degrees. I then told him I was come by his lordship's\nown appointment, to which intimation this Cerberus replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nreceived no orders about the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was upon the point of shutting\nme out, when I recollected myself all of a sudden, and slipping a crown\ninto his hand, begged as a favour that he would inquire, and let me know\nwhether or not the earl was up. The grim janitor relented at the touch\nof my money, which he took with all the indifference of a taxgatherer,\nand showed me into a parlour, where, he said, I might amuse myself till\nsuch time as his lord should be awake. I had not sat ten minutes in this\nplace, when a footman entered, and, without speaking, started at me; I\ninterpreted this piece of his behaviour into, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, sir, what is your\nbusiness?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and asked the same question I had put to the porter, when\nI accosted him first. The lacquey made the same reply, and disappeared\nbefore I could get any further intelligence. In a little time he\nreturned, on pretence of poking the fire, and looked at me again with\ngreat earnestness; upon which I began to perceive his meaning, and,\ntipping him with half-a-crown, desired he would be so good as to fall\nupon some method of letting the earl know that I was in the house. He\nmade a low bow, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and vanished. This bounty was not\nthrown away, for in an instant he came back, and conducted me to a\nchamber, where I was received with great kindness and familiarity by his\nlordship, whom I found just risen, in his morning-gown, and slippers.\nAfter breakfast, he entered into a particular conversation with me about\nmy travels, the remarks I had made abroad, and examined me to the full\nextent of my understanding. My answers seemed to please him very much,\nhe frequently squeezed my hand, and, looking at me with a singular\ncomplacency in his countenance, bade me depend upon his good offices\nwith the ministry in my behalf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung men of your qualifications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cought to be cherished by every administration. For my own part, I\nsee so little merit in the world, that I have laid it down as a maxim,\nto encourage the least appearance of genius and virtue to the utmost of\nmy power: you have a great deal of both; and will not fail of making a\nfigure one day, if I am not mistaken; but you must lay your account with\nmounting by gradual steps to the summit of your fortune. Rome was not\nbuilt in a day. As you understand the languages perfectly well, how\nwould you like to cross the sea as secretary to an embassy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I assured\nhis lordship, with great eagerness, that nothing could be more agreeable\nto my inclination: upon which he bade me make myself easy, my business\nwas done, for he had a place of that kind in his view. This piece of\ngenerosity affected me so much, that I was unable for some time to\nexpress my gratitude, which at length broke out in acknowledgments of\nmy own unworthiness, and encomiums on his benevolence. I could not even\nhelp shedding tears at the goodness of this noble lord, who no sooner\nperceived them than he caught me in his arms, and hugged and kissed\nme with a seemingly paternal affection. Confounded at this uncommon\ninstance of fondness for a stranger, I remained a few moments silent and\nashamed; then rose and took my leave, after he had assured me that he\nwould speak to the minister in my favour that very day; and desired that\nI would not for the future give myself the trouble of attending at\nhis levee, but come at the same hour every day, when he should be at\nleisure, that is, three times a week.\n\nThough my hopes were now very sanguine, I determined to conceal my\nprospect from everybody, even from Strap, until I should be more certain\nof success: and in the meantime give my patron no respite from my\nsolicitations. When I renewed my visit, I found the street-door opened\nto me as if by enchantment; but in my passage towards the presence-room,\nI was met by the valet-de-chambre, who cast some furious looks at me the\nmeaning of which I could not comprehend. The earl saluted me at entrance\nwith a tender embrace, and wished me joy of his success with the\nPremier, who, he said, had preferred his recommendation to that of two\nother noblemen very urgent in behalf of their respective friends, and\nabsolutely promised that I should go to a certain foreign court in\nquality of secretary to an ambassador and plenipotentiary who was to\nset out in a few weeks an affair of vast importance to the nation. I was\nthunderstruck with my good fortune, and could make no other reply than\nkneel and attempt to kiss my benefactor's hand, which submission he\nwould not permit; but, raising me up, pressed me to his breast with\nsurprising emotion, and told me he had now taken upon himself the care\nof making my fortune. What enhanced the value of the benefit still the\nmore, was his making light of the favour, and shifting the conversation\nto another subject.\n\nAmong other topics of discourse, that of the Belles Lettres was\nintroduced, upon which his lordship held forth with great taste and\nerudition and discovered an intimate knowledge of the authors of\nantiquity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's a book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, taking one from his bosom, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwritten\nwith great elegance and spirit; and, though the subject may give offence\nto some narrow-minded people, the author will always be held in esteem\nby every person of wit and learning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he put into my hand\nPetronius Arbiter, and asked my opinion of his wit and manner. I told\nhim, that, in my opinion, he wrote with great ease and vivacity, but\nwas withal so lewd and indecent that he ought to find no quarter or\nprotection among people of morals and taste. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the earl,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat his taste in love is generally decried, and indeed condemned\nby our laws; but perhaps that may be more owing to prejudice and\nmisapprehension than to true reason and deliberation. The best man among\nthe ancients is said to have entertained that passion; one of the\nwisest of their legislators has permitted the indulgence of it in his\ncommonwealth; the most celebrated poets have not scrupled to avow it.\nAt this day it prevails not only over all the East, but in most parts\nof Europe; in our own country, it gains ground apace, and in all\nprobability will become in a short time a more, fashionable vice than\nsimple fornication. Indeed there is something to be said in vindication\nof it; for, notwithstanding the severity of the law against offenders\nin this way, it must be confessed that the practice of this passion is\nunattended with that curse and burthen upon society which proceeds from\na race of miserable and deserted bastards, who are either murdered by\ntheir parents, deserted to the utmost want and wretchedness, or bred up\nto prey upon the commonwealth: and it likewise prevents the debauchery\nof many a young maiden, and the prostitution of honest men's wives; not\nto mention the consideration of health, which is much less liable to be\nimpaired in the gratification of this appetite, than in the exercise of\ncommon venery, which, by ruining the constitutions of our young men, has\nproduced a puny progeny that degenerates from generation to generation.\nNay, I have been told, that there is another motive perhaps more\npowerful than all these, that induces people to cultivate this\ninclination; namely, the exquisite pleasure attending its success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom this discourse I began to be apprehensive that his lordship,\nfinding I had travelled, was afraid I might have been infected with this\nspurious and sordid desire abroad, and took this method of sounding my\nsentiments on the subject. Fired at this supposed suspicion, I argued\nagainst it with great warmth, as an appetite unnatural, absurd, and of\npernicious consequence; and declared my utter detestation and abhorrence\nof it in these lines of the satirist:--\n\n\nEternal infamy the wretch confound Who planted first that vice on\nBritish ground! A vice! That spite of nature and sense reigns, And\npoisons genial love, and manhood stains.\n\nThe earl smiled at my indignation, and told me he was glad to find my\nopinion of the matter so conformable to his own, and that what he had\nadvanced was only to provoke me to an answer, with which he professed\nhimself perfectly well pleased. After I had enjoyed a long audience, I\nhappened to look at my watch, in order to regulate my motions by it; and\nhis lordship, observing the chased case, desired to see the device,\nand examine the exception, which he approved with some expressions of\nadmiration. Considering the obligations I lay under to his lordship,\nI thought there could not be a fitter opportunity than the present to\nmanifest, in some shape, my gratitude; I therefore begged he would do\nme the honour to accept of the watch as a small testimony of the sense\nI had of his lordship's generosity; but, he refused it in a peremptory\nmanner, and said he was sorry I should entertain such a mercenary\nopinion of him; observing at the same time, that it was the most\nbeautiful piece of workmanship he had ever seen, and desiring to know\nwhere he could have such another. I begged a thousand pardons for the\nfreedom I had taken, which I hoped he would impute to nothing else than\nthe highest veneration for his person--told him, that, as it came to my\nhand by accident in France, I could give him no information about\nthe maker, for there was no name on the inside; and once more humbly\nentreated that he would indulge me so far as to use it for my sake. He\nwas still positive in refusing it; but was pleased to thank me for\nmy generous offer, saying, it was a present that no nobleman need\nbe ashamed of receiving: though he was resolved to show his\ndisinterestedness with regard to me, for whom he had conceived a\nparticular friendship; and insisted (if I were willing to part with the\nwatch) upon knowing what it had cost, that he might at least indemnify\nme, by refunding the money. On the other hand, I assured his lordship\nthat I should look upon it as an uncommon mark of distinction, if he\nwould take it without further question; and, rather than disoblige\nme, he was at last persuaded to put it in his pocket, to my no small\nsatisfaction, who took my leave immediately, after having received a\nkind squeeze, and an injunction to depend upon his promise.\n\nBuoyed up with this reception, my heart opened; I gave away a guinea,\namong the lacqueys, who escorted me to the door, flew to the lodgings of\nLord Straddle, upon whom I forced my diamond ring as an acknowledgment\nfor the great service he had done me, and from thence hied me home,\nwith an intent of sharing my happiness with honest Strap. I determined,\nhowever, to heighten his pleasure, by depressing his spirits at first,\nand then bringing in good news with double relish. For this purpose, I\naffected the appearance of disappointment and chagrin, and told him in\nan abrupt manner that I had lost the watch and diamond. Poor Hugh, who\nhad been already harassed into a consumption by intelligence of this\nsort, no sooner heard these words, than, unable to contain himself, he\ncried, with distraction in his looks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod in heaven forbid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could\ncarry on the farce no longer; but, laughing in his face, told him\neverything that had passed, as above recited. His features were\nimmediately unbended, and the transition was so affecting, that he\nwept with joy, calling my Lord Strutwell by the appellations of Jewel,\nPhoenix, Rara avis; and praising God, that there was still some virtue\nleft among our nobility. Our mutual congratulations being over, we gave\nway to our imagination, and anticipated our happiness by prosecuting our\nsuccess through the different steps of promotion, till I arrived at the\nrank of a prime minister, and he to that of my first secretary.\n\nIntoxicated with these ideas, I went to the ordinary, where, meeting\nwith Banter, I communicated the whole affair in confidence to him,\nconcluding with an assurance that I would do him all the service in my\npower. He heard me to an end with great patience, then regarding me\na good while with a look of disdain, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo your business is\ndone, you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs good as done. I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat will do it still more effectually--a halter! 'Sdeath!\nif I had been such a gull to two such scoundrels as Strutwell and\nStraddle, I would, without any more ado, tuck myself up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shocked at\nthis exclamation, I desired him with some confusion to explain\nhimself; upon which he gave me to understand that Straddle was a\npoor contemptible wretch, who lived by borrowing and pimping for\nhis fellow-peers; that in consequence of this last capacity, he had\ndoubtless introduced me to Strutwell, who was so notorious for a passion\nfor his own sex that he was amazed his character had never reached my\nears; and that, far from being able to obtain for me the post he had\npromised, his interest at court was so low, that he could scarce provide\nfor a superannuated footman once a year in the customs or excise; that\nit was a common thing for him to amuse strangers, whom his jackals ran\ndown, with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me, until\nhe had stripped them of their cash, and everything valuable about them,\nvery often of their chastity, and then leave them a prey to want and\ninfamy: that he allowed his servants no other wages than that part of\nthe spoil which they could glean by their industry; and the whole of\nhis conduct towards me was so glaring, that nobody who knew anything of\nmankind could have been imposed upon by his insinuations.\n\nI leave the reader to judge how I relished this piece of information,\nwhich precipitated me from the most exalted pinnacle of hope to the\nlowest abyss of despondence, and well nigh determined me to take\nBanter's advice and finish my chagrin with a halter. I had no room to\nsuspect the veracity of my friend, because, upon recollection, I found\nevery circumstance of Strutwell's behaviour exactly tallying with the\ncharacter he had described; his hugs, embraces, squeezes, and eager\nlooks, were now no longer a mystery; no more than his defence of\nPetronius, and the jealous frown of his valet-de-chambre, who, it seems,\nhad been the favourite pathic of his lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nI attempt to recover my Watch and Jewel, but to no Purpose--resolve to\nrevenge myself on Strutwell by my Importunity--am reduced to my\nlast Guinea--obliged to inform Strap of my Necessity, who is almost\ndistracted with the News, but nevertheless obliged to pawn my best Sword\nfor present Subsistence--that small Supply being exhausted, I am almost\nstupified with my Misfortunes--go to the Gaming Table by the Advice\nof Banter, and come off with unexpected Success--Strap's Ecstacy--Mrs.\nGawky waits upon me, professes Remorse for her Perfidy, and implores my\nAssistance--I do myself a Piece of Justice by her Means, and afterwards\nreconcile her to her Father\n\nI was so confounded that I could make no reply to Banter, who reproached\nme with great indignation for having thrown away upon rascals that\nwhich, had it been converted into ready money, would have supported the\nrank of a gentleman for some months, and enabled me, at the same time,\nto oblige my friends. Stupified as I was, I could easily divine the\nsource of his concern, but sneaked away in a solitary manner, without\nyielding the least answer to his expostulations; and began to deliberate\nwithin myself in what manner I should attempt to retrieve the movables I\nhad so foolishly lost. I should have thought it no robbery to take\nthem again by force, could I have done it without any danger of being\ndetected; but, as I could have no such opportunity, I resolved to work\nby finesse, and go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle, where I\nwas so fortunate as to find him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have just now\nrecollected, that the diamond I had the honour of presenting to you\nis loosened a little in the socket, and there is a young fellow just\narrived from Paris, who is reckoned the best jeweller in Europe; I knew\nhim in France; and, if your lordship will give me leave, will carry the\nring to him to be set to rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His lordship was not to be caught\nin this snare; he thanked me for my offer, and told me, that, having\nhimself observed the defect, he had sent it to his own jeweller to be\nmended; and, indeed, by this time I believe it was in the jeweller's\nhands, though not in order to be mended, for it stood in need of no\nalteration.\n\nBalked in this piece of politics, I cursed my simplicity; but resolved\nto play a surer game with the earl, which I thus devised. I did not\ndoubt of being admitted into familiar conversation with him, as before,\nand hoped by some means to get the watch into my hand; then, on pretence\nof winding or playing with it, drop it on the floor, when, in all\nprobability, the fall would disorder the work so as to stop its motion;\nthis event would furnish me with an opportunity of insisting upon\ncarrying it away in order to be repaired, and then I should be in no\nhurry to bring it back. What pity it was I could not find an occasion of\nputting this fine scheme in execution! When I went to renew my visit to\nhis lordship, my access to the parlour was as free as ever; but after I\nhad waited for some time, the valet-de-chambre came in with his lord's\ncompliments, and a desire to see me to-morrow at his levee, he being at\npresent so much indisposed that he could not see company. I interpreted\nthis message into a bad omen, and came away muttering curses against his\nlordship's politeness, and ready to go to loggerheads with myself for\nbeing so egregiously duped. But, that I might have some satisfaction for\nthe loss I had sustained, I besieged him so closely at his levee, and\npersecuted him with my solicitations; not without faint hopes, indeed,\nof reaping something more from my industry than the bare pleasure of\nmaking him uneasy; though I could never obtain another private hearing\nthe whole course of my attendance; neither had I resolution enough\nto undeceive Strap, whose looks in a little time were so whetted with\nimpatience, that whenever I came home, his eyes devoured me, as it were,\nwith eagerness of attention.\n\nAt length, however, finding myself reduced to my last guinea, I was\ncompelled to disclose my necessity, though I endeavoured to sweeten the\ndiscovery by rehearsing to him the daily assurances I received from my\npatron. But these promises were not of efficacy sufficient to support\nthe spirits of my friend, who no sooner understood the lowness of my\nfinances, than, uttering a dreadful groan, he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of\nGod, what shall we do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d In order to comfort him, I said, that many of\nmy acquaintances, who were in a worse condition than we, supported,\nnotwithstanding, the character of gentlemen; and advising him to thank\nGod that as yet we had incurred no debt, proposed he should pawn my\nsword of steel, inlaid with gold, and trust to my discretion for the\nrest. This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap, who, in spite\nof his invincible affection for me, still retained notions of economy\nand expense suitable to the narrowness of his education; nevertheless\nhe complied with my request, and raised seven pieces on the sword in a\ntwinkling. This supply, inconsiderable as it was, made me as happy for\nthe present, as if I had kept five hundred pounds in bank; for by\nthis time I was so well skilled in procrastinating every troublesome\nreflection, that the prospect of want seldom affected me very much, let\nit be ever so near. And now indeed it was nearer than I imagined. My\nlandlord, having occasion for money, put me in mind of my being indebted\nto him five guineas in lodging; and, telling me he had a sum to make up,\nbegged I would excuse his importunity, and discharge the debt. Though I\ncould ill spare so much cash, my pride took the resolution of disbursing\nit. This I did in a cavalier manner, after he had written a discharge,\ntelling him with an air of scorn and resentment, I saw he was resolved\nthat I should not be long in his books; while Strap, who stood by, and\nknew my circumstances, wrung his hands in secret, gnawed his nether lip,\nand turned yellow with despair. Whatever appearance of indifference my\nvanity enabled me to put on, I was thunderstruck with this demand, which\nI had no sooner satisfied, than I hastened into company, with a view of\nbeguiling my cares with conversation, or drowning them with wine.\n\nAfter dinner, a party was accordingly made in the coffee-house, from\nwhence we adjourned to the tavern, where, instead of sharing the mirth\nof the company, I was as much chagrined at their good humour as a damned\nsoul in hell would be at a glimpse of heaven. In vain did I swallow\nbumper after bumper! the wine had lost its effect upon me, and, far from\nraising my dejected spirits, could not even lay me asleep. Banter, who\nwas the only intimate I had (Strap excepted), perceived my anxiety, and,\nwhen we broke up, reproached me with pusillanimity, for being cast\ndown at my disappointment that such a rascal as Strutwell could be the\noccasion of. I told him I did not at all see how Strutwell's being a\nrascal alleviated my misfortune; and gave him to understand that my\npresent grief did not so much proceed from that disappointment, as from\nthe low ebb of my fortune, which was sunk to something less than two\nguineas. At this declaration he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPsha! is that all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and assured\nme there were a thousand ways of living in town without a fortune, he\nhimself having subsisted many years entirely by his wit. I expressed\nan eager desire of being acquainted with some of these methods, and he,\nwithout farther expostulation, bade me follow him. He conducted me to a\nhouse under the piazzas in Covert Garden, which we entered, and having\ndelivered our swords to a grim fellow who demanded them at the foot of\nthe staircase, ascended to the second story, where I saw multitudes of\npeople standing round two gaming-tables, loaded, in a manner, with gold\nand silver. My conductor told me this was the house of a worthy Scotch\nlord, who, using the privilege of his peerage, had set up public gaming\ntables, from the profits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood.\nHe then explained the difference between the sitters and the bettors;\ncharacterised the first as old rooks, and the last as bubbles; and\nadvised me to try my fortune at the silver table, by betting a crown at\na time. Before I would venture anything, I considered the company more\nparticularly, and there appeared such a group of villanous faces, that\nI was struck with horror and astonishment at the sight! I signified\nmy surprise to Banter, who whispered in my ear, that the bulk of\nthose present were sharpers, highwaymen, and apprentices, who, having\nembezzled their master's cash, made a desperate push in this place to\nmake up their deficiencies. This account did not encourage me to hazard\nany part of my small pittance: but, at length, being teased by the\nimportunities of my friend, who assured me there was no danger of being\nill-used, because people were hired by the owner to see justice done to\neverybody, I began by risking one shilling, and, in less than an hour,\nmy winning amounted to thirty. Convinced by this time of the fairness\nof the game, and animated with success, there was no need of further\npersuasion to continue the play: I lent Banter (who seldom had any money\nin his pocket) a guinea, which he carried to the gold table, and lost\nin a moment. He would have borrowed another, but finding me deaf to his\narguments, went away in a pet. Meanwhile my gain advanced to six pieces,\nand my desire of more increased in proportion: so that I moved to the\nhigher table, where I laid half-a-guinea on every throw, and fortune\nstill favouring me, I became a sitter, in which capacity I remained\nuntil it was broad day; when I found myself, after many vicissitudes,\none hundred and fifty guineas in pocket.\n\nThinking it now high time to retire with my booty, I asked if anybody\nwould take my place, and made a notion to rise; upon which an old\nGascon, who sat opposite to me, and of whom I had won a little money,\nstarted up with fury in his looks, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRestez, foutre, restez! il\nfaut donner moi mon ravanchio!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the same time, a Jew, who sat near\nthe other, insinuated that I was more beholden to art than fortune for\nwhat I had got; that he had observed me wipe the table very often,\nand that some of the divisions appeared to be greasy. This intimation\nproduced a great deal of clamour against me, especially among the\nlosers, who threatened with many oaths and imprecations, to take me\nup by a warrant as a sharper, unless I would compromise the affair by\nrefunding the greatest part of my winning. Though I was far from being\neasy under his accusation, I relied upon my innocence, threatened in my\nturn to prosecute the Jew, for defamation, and boldly offered to submit\nmy cause to the examination of any justice in Westminster; but they knew\nthemselves too well to put their characters on that issue, and finding\nthat I was not to be intimidated into any concession, dropped their\nplea, and made way for me to withdraw. I would not, however, stir from\nthe table until the Israelite had retracted what he had said to my\ndisadvantage, and asked pardon before the whole assembly.\n\nAs I marched out with my prize, I happened to tread on the toes of a\ntall raw-boned fellow, with a hooked nose, fierce eyes, black thick\neyebrows, a pigtail wig of the same colour, and a formidable hat pulled\nover his forehead, who stood gnawing his fingers in the crowd, and he\nsooner felt the application of my shoe heel, than he roared out in a\ntremendous voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and wounds! you son of a whore, what's that\nfor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked pardon with a great deal of submission, and protested I\nhad no intention of hurting him; but the more I humbled myself the more\nhe stormed, and insisted on gentlemanly satisfaction, at the same time\nprovoking me with scandalous names that I could not put up with; so that\nI gave loose to my passion, returned his Billingsgate, and challenged\nhim down to the piazzas. His indignation cooling as mine warmed, he\nrefused my invitation, saying he would choose his own time, and returned\ntowards the table muttering threats, which I neither dreaded nor\ndistinctly heard; but, descending with great deliberation, received my\nsword from the door-keeper, whom I gratified with a guinea, according to\nthe custom of the place, and went home in a rapture of joy.\n\nMy faithful valet, who had set up all night in the utmost uneasiness on\nmy account, let me in with his face beslubbered with tears, and followed\nme to my chamber, where he stood silent like a condemned criminal, in\nexpectation of hearing that every shilling was spent, I guessed the\nsituation of his thoughts, and, assuming a sullen look, bade him fetch\nme some water to wash. He replied, without lifting his eyes from the\nground, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my simple conjecture, you have more occasion for rest, not\nhaving (I suppose) slept these four-and-twenty hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBring me\nsome water!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, in a peremptory tone; upon which he sneaked away\nshrugging his shoulders. Before he returned, I had spread my whole stock\non the table in the most ostentatious manner; so that, when it first\nsaluted his view, he stood like one entranced; and, having rubbed his\neyes more than once, to assure himself of his being awake, broke out\ninto, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord have mercy upon us, what a vast treasure is here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis all\nour own, Strap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake what is necessary, and redeem the sword\nimmediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He advanced towards the table, stopped short by the\nway, looked at the money and me by turns, and with a wildness in his\ncountenance, produced from joy checked by distrust, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say\nit is honestly come by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To remove his scruples, I made him acquainted\nwith the whole story of my success, which, when he heard, he danced\nabout the room in an ecstacy, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod be praised!--a white\nstone!--God be praised!--a white stone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So that I was afraid the change\nof fortune had disordered his intellects, and that he was run mad with\njoy. Extremely concerned at this event, I attempted to reason him out\nof his frenzy, but to no purpose; for without regarding what I said,\nhe continued to frisk up and down, and repeat his rhapsody, of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod be\npraised!--a white stone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At last, I rose in the utmost consternation,\nand, laying violent hands upon him, put a stop to his extravagance\nby fixing him down to a settee that was in the room. This constraint\nbanished his delirium; he started as if just awoke, and terrified at my\nbehaviour, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d When he learned the cause of\nmy apprehension, he was ashamed of his transports, and told me, that in\nmentioning the white stone, he alluded to the Dies fasti of the Romans,\nalbo lapide notati.\n\nHaving no inclination to sleep, I secured my cash, dressed, and was\njust going abroad, when the servant of the house told me, there was a\ngentlewoman at the door who wanted to speak with me. Surprised at this\ninformation, I made Strap show her up, and in less than a minute, saw\na young woman of a shabby decayed appearance enter my room. After\nhalf-a-dozen curtsies, she began to sob, and told me her name was Gawky;\nupon which information I immediately recollected the features of Miss\nLevement, who had been the first occasion of my misfortunes. Though I\nhad all the reason in the world to resent her treacherous behaviour to\nme, I was moved at her distress, and professing my sorrow at seeing her\nso reduced desired her to sit, and inquired into the particulars of her\nsituation. She fell upon her knees and implored my forgiveness for the\ninjuries she had done me, protesting before God, that she was forced,\nagainst her inclination, into that hellish conspiracy which had almost\ndeprived me of my life, by the entreaties of her husband, who, having\nbeen afterwards renounced by his father on account of his marriage with\nher, and unable to support a family on his pay, left his wife at her\nfather's house, and went with the regiment to Germany, where he was\nbroke for misbehaviour at the battle of Dettingen; since which time she\nhad heard no tidings of him. She then gave me to understand, with many\nsymptoms of penitence, that it was her misfortune to bear a child four\nmonths after marriage, by which event her parents were so incensed, that\nshe was turned out of doors with the infant, that died soon after: and\nhad hitherto subsisted in a miserable indigent manner, on the extorted\ncharity of a few friends, who were now quite tired of giving; that, not\nknowing where or how to support herself one day longer, she had fled for\nsuccour even to me, who, of all mankind, had the least cause to assist\nher, relying upon the generosity of my disposition, which, she hoped,\nwould be pleased with this opportunity of avenging itself in the noblest\nmanner on the wretch who had wronged me. I was very much affected with\nher discourse and, having no cause to suspect the sincerity of her\nrepentance, raised her up, freely pardoned all she had done against me,\nand promised to befriend her as much as lay in my power.\n\nSince my last arrival in London, I had made no advances to the\napothecary, imagining it would be impossible for me to make my innocence\nappear, so unhappily was my accusation circumstanced: Strap indeed had\nlaboured to justify me to the schoolmaster; but, far from succeeding\nin his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropped all correspondence with him,\nbecause he refused to quit his connection with me. Things being in this\nsituation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating my character\ncould not offer than that which now presented itself; I therefore\nstipulated with Mrs. Gawky, that before I would yield her the least\nassistance, she should do me the justice to clear my reputation by\nexplaining upon oath before a magistrate the whole of the conspiracy,\nas it had been executed against me. When she had given me this\nsatisfaction, I presented her with five guineas, a sum so much above her\nexpectation, that she could scarce believe the evidence of her senses,\nand was ready to worship me for my benevolence. The declaration, signed\nwith her own hand, I sent to her father, who, upon recollecting and\ncomparing the circumstances of my charge, was convinced of my integrity,\nand waited on me next day, in company with his friend the schoolmaster,\nto whom he had communicated my vindication. After mutual salutation,\nMonsieur Lavement began a long apology for the unjust treatment I had\nreceived; but I saved him a good deal of breath by interrupting his\nharangue, and assuring him that, far from entertaining a resentment\nagainst him, I thought myself obliged to his lenity, which allowed me to\nescape, after such strong assumptions of guilt appeared against me. Mr.\nConcordance, thinking it now his turn to speak, observed that Mr. Random\nhad too much candour and sagacity to be disobliged at their conduct,\nwhich, all things considered, could not have been otherwise with\nany honesty of intention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the plot had been\nunravelled to us by any supernatural intelligence; if it had been\nwhispered by a genius, communicated by dream, or revealed by an\nangel from on high, we should have been to blame in crediting ocular\ndemonstration; but as we were left in the midst of mortality, it cannot\nbe expected we should be incapable of imposition. I must assure you,\nMr. Random, no man on earth is more pleased than I am at this triumph\nof your character: and, as the news of your misfortune panged me to the\nvery entrails, this manifestation of your innocence makes my midriff\nquiver with joy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thanked him for this concern, desired them to\nundeceive those of their acquaintance who judged harshly of me, and,\nhaving treated them with a glass of wine, represented to Lavement\nthe deplorable condition of his daughter, and pleaded her cause so\neffectually, that he consented to settle a small annuity on her for\nlife: but could not be persuaded to take her home, because her mother\nwas so much incensed, that she would never see her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nI purchase new Clothes--reprimand Strutwell and Straddle--Banter\nproposes another matrimonial Scheme--I accept of his Terms--set out\nto Bath in the Stage-coach with the young Lady and her Mother--the\nBehaviour of an Officer and Lawyer--our fellow Travellers described--a\nsmart dialogue between my Mistress and the Captain\n\nHaving finished this affair to my satisfaction, I found myself perfectly\nat ease; and, looking upon the gaming-table as a certain resource for a\ngentleman in want, became more gay than ever. Although my clothes were\nalmost as good as new, I grew ashamed of wearing them, because I thought\neverybody by this time had got an inventory of my wardrobe. For which\nreason I disposed of a good part of my apparel to a salesman in Monmouth\nStreet for half the value, and bought two new suits with the money. I\nlikewise purchased a plain gold watch, despairing of recovering that\nwhich I had so foolishly given to Strutwell, whom, notwithstanding,\nI still continued to visit at his levee, until the ambassador he had\nmentioned set out with a secretary of his own choosing. I thought myself\nthen at liberty to expostulate with his lordship, whom I treated with\ngreat freedom in a letter, for amusing me with vain hopes, when he\nneither had the power nor inclination to provide for me. Nor was I less\nreserved with Straddle, whom I in person reproached for misrepresenting\nto me the character of Strutwell, which I did not scruple to aver was\ninfamous in every respect. He seemed very much enraged at my freedom,\ntalked a great deal about his quality and honour, and began to make some\ncomparisons which I thought so injurious to mine, that I demanded an\nexplanation with great warmth, and he was mean enough to equivocate, and\ncondescend in such a manner that I left him with a hearty contempt of\nhis behaviour.\n\nAbout this time, Banter, who had observed a surprising and sudden\nalteration in my appearance and disposition, began to inquire very\nminutely into the cause, and, as I did not think fit to let him know the\ntrue state of the affair, lest he might make free with my purse, on the\nstrength of having proposed the scheme that filled it, I told him that\nI had received a small supply from a relation in the country, who at the\nsame time had proffered to use all his interest (which was not small) in\nsoliciting some post for me that should make me easy for life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that\nbe the case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Banter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps you won't care to mortify yourself\na little in making your fortune another way. I have a relation who is to\nset out for Bath next week, with an only daughter, who being sickly and\ndecrepit, intends to drink the waters for the recovery of her health.\nHer father, who was a rich Turkey merchant, died about a year ago,\nand left her with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, under the sole\nmanagement of her mother, who is my kinswoman. I would have put in for\nthe plate myself, but there is a breach at present between the old woman\nand me. You must know, that some time ago I borrowed a small sum of\nher and promised, it seems, to pay it before a certain time; but being\ndisappointed in my expectation of money from the country, the day\nelapsed without my being able to take up my note; upon which she wrote\na peremptory letter, threatening to arrest me, if I did not pay the debt\nimmediately. Nettled at this precise behaviour, I sent a d--d severe\nanswer, which enraged her so much that she actually took out a writ\nagainst me. Whereupon, finding the thing grow serious, I got a friend\nto advance the money for me, discharged the debt, went to her house,\nand abused her for her unfriendly dealing. She was provoked by my\nreproaches, and scolded in her turn. The little deformed urchin joined\nher mother with such virulence and volubility of tongue, that I was\nfain to make a retreat, after having been honoured with a great many\nscandalous epithets, which gave me plainly to understand that I had\nnothing to hope from the esteem of the one, or the affection of the\nother. As they are both utter strangers to life, it is a thousand to one\nthat the girl will be picked up by some scoundrel or other at Bath, if I\ndon't provide for her otherwise. You are a well-looking fellow,\nRandom, and can behave as demurely as a quaker. If you will give me\nan obligation of five hundred pounds, to be paid six months after your\nmarriage, I will put you in a method of carrying her in spite of all\nopposition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis proposal was too advantageous for me to be refused. The writing was\nimmediately drawn up and executed; and Banter, giving me notice of the\ntime when, and the stage coach in which they were to set out, I bespoke\na place in the same convenience; and, having hired a horse for Strap,\nwho was chagrined with the prospect, set forward accordingly.\n\nAs we embarked before day, I had not the pleasure for some time of\nseeing Miss Snapper (that was the name of my mistress), nor even of\nperceiving the number and sex of my fellow travellers, although I\nguessed that the coach was full, by the difficulty I found in seating\nmyself. The first five minutes passed in a general silence, when, all of\na sudden, the coach heeling to one side, a boisterous voice pronounced,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the right and left, cover your flanks, d--me! whiz!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I easily\ndiscovered by the tone and matter of this exclamation that it was\nuttered by a son of Mars; neither was it hard to conceive the profession\nof another person who sat opposite to me, and observed that we ought\nto have been well satisfied of our security before we entered upon the\npremises. These two sallies had not the desired effect. We continued a\ngood while as mute as before, till at length the gentleman of the sword,\nimpatient of longer silence, made a second effort, by swearing he had\ngot into a meeting of quakers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe so too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a shrill female\nvoice at my left hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the spirit of folly begins to move.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOut\nwith it then, madam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the soldier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem to have no occasion\nfor a midwife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--mn my blood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the other,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ca man can't talk to a woman, but she immediately thinks of a midwife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI long to be delivered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat of--a mouse,\nmadam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof a fool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you far gone\nwith a fool?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle more than two miles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy\nGad, you're a wit, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the officer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could with any\njustice return the compliment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds, I have done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour bolt is soon shot, according to the old proverb,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe. The warrior's powder was quite spent; the lawyer advised him to\ndrop the prosecution, and a grave matron, who sat on the left hand of\nthe victorious wit, told her she must not let her tongue run so fast\namong strangers. This reprimand, softened with the appellation of child,\nconvinced me that the satirical lady was no other than Miss Snapper,\nand I resolved to regulate my conduct accordingly. The champion, finding\nhimself so smartly handled, changed his battery, and began to expatiate\non his own exploits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou talk of shot, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cd--me! I\nhave both given and received some shot in my time--I was wounded in the\nshoulder by a pistol ball at Dettingen, where--I say nothing--but by\nG--d! if it had not been for me--all's one for that--I despise boasting,\nd-me! whiz!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he whistled one part and hummed another, of\nthe Black Joke; then, addressing himself to the lawyer, went on thus;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWouldn't you think it d--d hard, after having, at the risk of your\nlife, recovered the standard of a regiment that had been lost, to\nreceive no preferment for your pains? I don't choose to name no names,\nsink me! but, howsomever, this I will refer, by G--d! and that is\nthis--a musketeer of the French guards, having a standard from a certain\ncornet of a certain regiment, d--e! was retreating with his prize\nas fast as his horse's heels could carry him, sink me! Upon which, I\nsnatched up firelock that belonged to a dead man, d--me! Whiz! and shot\nhis horse under him, d--n my blood! The fellow got upon his feet, and\nbegan to repose me, upon which I charged my bayonet breast high, and\nran him through the body by G--! One of his comrades, coming to his\nassistance, shot me in the shoulder, as I told you before; and another\ngave me a contusion on the head with the butt-end of his carbine; but,\nd--me, that did not signify. I killed one, put the other to flight, and\ntaking up the standard, carried it off very deliberately. But the best\njoke of all was the son of a b--ch of a cornet, who had surrendered it\nin a cowardly manner, seeing it in my possession, demanded it from me in\nthe front of the line. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n my blood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere did you find my\nstandard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n my blood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you\nlose it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's nothing to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'tis my standard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n says he\u00e2\u0080\u009d and by G--d I'll have it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--nation seize me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you shall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctill I have first delivered it to the\ngeneral,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I; and accordingly I went to the headquarters after the\nbattle, and delivered it to my Lord Stair, who promised to do for me.\nBut I am no more than a poor lieutenant still, d--n my blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving vented this repetition of expletives, the lawyer owned he had not\nbeen requited according to his deserts; observed that the labourer is\nalways worthy of his hire, and asked if the promise was made before\nwitnesses, because in that case the law would compel the general to\nperform it; but understanding that the promise was made over a bottle,\nwithout being restricted to time or terms, he pronounced it not valid\nin law, proceeded to inquire into the particulars of the battle, and\naffirmed that, although the English had drawn themselves into premunire\nat first, the French managed their cause so lamely in the course of\nthe dispute, that they would have been utterly nonsuited, had they not\nobtained a nolli prosequi. In spite of these enlivening touches, the\nconversation was like to suffer another long interruption, when the\nlieutenant, unwilling to conceal any of his accomplishments that could\nbe displayed in his present situation, offered to regale the company\nwith a song; and, interpreting our silence into a desire of hearing,\nbegan to warble a fashionable air the first stanza of which he\npronounced thus:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you task the moon-tide hair, To yon flagrant beau repair. Where\nwaving with the poplin vow, The bantling fine will shelter you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.\n\nThe sense of the rest he perverted as he went on with such surprising\nfacility that I could not help thinking he had been at some pains to\nburlesque the performance. Miss Snapper ascribed it to the true cause,\nnamely ignorance; and, when he asked her how she relished his music,\nanswered that, in her opinion, the music and the words were much of a\npiece. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, d--n my blood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take that as a high compliment;\nfor everybody allows the words are d--able fine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey may be\nso,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor aught I know, but they are above my\ncomprehension.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI an't obliged to find you comprehension, madam, curse\nme!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, nor to speak sense neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n my\nheart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll speak what I please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here the lawyer interposed,\nby telling him, there were some things he must not speak; and upon being\ndefied to give an instance, mentioned treason and defamation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for\nthe king,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the soldier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod bless him--I eat his bread, and have\nlost blood in his cause, therefore I have nothing to say to him--but, by\nG--d, I dare say anything to any other man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lawyer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\ndare not call me rogue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--me, for what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the counsellor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have it good action against you,\nand recover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the officer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I dare not call you\nrogue, I dare think you one, d--me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This stroke of wit he accompanied\nwith a loud laugh of self-approbation, which unluckily did not affect\nthe audience, but effectually silenced his antagonist, who did not open\nhis mouth for the space of an hour, except to clear his pipe with three\nhems, which however, produced nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nDay breaking, I have the Pleasure of viewing the Person of Miss\nSnapper, whom I had not seen before--the Soldier is witty upon\nme--is offended--talks much of his Valour--is reprimanded by a grave\nGentlewoman--we are alarmed by the cry of Highwaymen--I get out of\nthe Coach, and stand in my own defence--they ride off without having\nattacked us--I pursue them--one of them is thrown from his Horse and\ntaken--I return to the Coach--am complimented by Miss Snapper--the\nCaptain's Behaviour on this Occasion--the Prude reproaches me in a\nSoliloquy--I upbraid her in the same Manner--the Behaviour of Miss\nSnapper, at Breakfast, disobliges me--the Lawyer is witty upon the\nOfficer, who threatens him\n\nIn the meantime, the day breaking in upon us, discovered to one another\nthe faces of their fellow travellers: and I had the good fortune to\nfind my mistress not quite so deformed nor disagreeable as she had been\nrepresented to me. Her head, indeed, bore some resemblance to a hatchet,\nthe edge being represented by her face; but she had a certain delicacy\nin her complexion, and a great deal of vivacity in her eyes, which were\nvery large and black; and, though the protuberance of her breast, when\nconsidered alone, seemed to drag her forwards, it was easy to perceive\nan equivalent on her back which balanced the other, and kept her body\nin equilibrio. On the whole, I thought I should have great reason to\ncongratulate myself if it should be my fate to possess twenty thousand\npounds encumbered with such a wife. I began therefore to deliberate\nabout the most probable means of acquiring the conquest, and was so much\nengrossed by this idea, that I scarce took any notice of the rest of\nthe people in the coach, but revolved my project in silence; while the\nconversation was maintained as before by the object of my hopes, the son\nof Mars, and the barrister, who by this time recollected himself, and\ntalked in terms as much as ever. At length a dispute happened, which\nended in a wager, to be determined by me, who was so much absorbed in\ncontemplation, that I neither heard the reference nor the question which\nwas put to me by each in his turn. Affronted at my supposed contempt,\nthe soldier with great vociferation swore I was either dumb or deaf if\nnot both, and that I looked as if I could not say Bo to a goose. Aroused\nat this observation, I fixed my eyes upon him, and pronounced with\nemphasis the interjection Bo! Upon which he cocked his hat in a fierce\nmanner, and cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--me sir, what d'ye mean by that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Had I intended\nto answer him, which by the by was not my design, I should have been\nanticipated by Miss, who told him, my meaning was to show, that I could\ncry Bo to a goose; and laughed very heartily at my laconic reproof. Her\nexplanation and mirth did not help to appease his wrath, which broke\nout in several martial insinuations, such as--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not understand such\nfreedoms, d--me! D--n my blood! I'm a gentleman, and bear the king's\ncommission. 'Sblood! some people deserve to have their noses pulled for\ntheir impertinence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought to have checked these ejaculations by a\nfrown; because he had talked so much of his valour that I had long ago\nrated him as an ass in a lion's skin; but this expedient did not answer\nmy expectation, he took umbrage at the contraction of my brow, swore he\ndid not value my sulky looks a fig's end, and protested he feared no\nman breathing. Miss Snapper said, she was very glad to find herself in\ncompany with a man of so much courage, who, she did not doubt, would\nprotect her from all the attempts of highwaymen during our journey.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake yourself perfectly easy on that head, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the officer.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have got a pair of pistols (here they are), which I took from a horse\nofficer at the battle of Dettingen; they are double loaded, and if any\nhighwayman in England robs you of the value of a pin while I have the\nhonour of being in your company, d--n my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When he had expressed\nhimself in this manner, a prim gentlewoman, who had sat silent hitherto,\nopened her mouth, and said, she wondered how any man could be so rude\nas to pull out such weapons before ladies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--me, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the\nchampion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you are so much afraid at the sight of a pistol, how d'ye\npropose to stand fire if there should be occasion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then told him\nthat, if she thought he could be so unmannerly as to use fire-arms in\nher presence, whatever might be the occasion, she would get out of the\ncoach immediately, and walk to the next village, where she might procure\na convenience to herself. Before he could make any answer, my Dulcinea\ninterposed, and observed that, far from being offended at a gentleman's\nusing his arms in his own defence, she thought herself very lucky in\nbeing along with one by whose valour she stood a good chance of saving\nherself from being rifled. The prude cast a disdainful look at Miss, and\nsaid that people, who have but little to lose, are sometimes the most\nsolicitous about preserving it. The old lady was affronted at this\ninuendo, and took notice, that people ought to be very well informed\nbefore they speak slightingly of other people's fortune, lest they\ndiscover their own envy, and make themselves ridiculous. The daughter\ndeclared, that she did not pretend to vie with anybody in point of\nriches; and if the lady, who insisted upon non-resistance, would promise\nto indemnify us all for the loss we should sustain, she would be one of\nthe first to persuade the captain to submission, in case we should be\nattacked. To this proposal, reasonable as it was, the reserved lady made\nno other reply than a scornful glance and a toss of her head. I was very\nwell pleased with the spirit of my young mistress, and even wished\nfor an opportunity of distinguishing my courage under her eye, which I\nbelieved could not fail of prepossessing her in my favour, when all of\na sudden Strap rode up to the coach door, and told us in a great fright,\nthat two men on horseback were crossing the heath (for by this time we\nhad passed Hounslow), and made directly towards us.\n\nThis piece of information was no sooner delivered, than Mrs. Snapper\nbegan to scream, her daughter grew pale, the old lady pulled out\nher purse to be in readiness, the lawyer's teeth chattered, while he\npronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis no matter--we'll sue the county and recover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\ncaptain gave evident signs of confusion: and I, after having commanded\nthe coachman to stop, opened the door, jumped out, and invited the\nwarrior to follow me. But, finding him backward and astonished, I took\nhis pistols, and, giving them to Strap, who had by this time alighted\nand trembled very much, I mounted on horseback; and, taking my own\n(which I could better depend upon) from the holsters, cocked them both,\nand faced the robbers, who were now very near us. Seeing me ready to\noppose them on horseback, and another man armed a-foot, they made a\nhalt at some distance to reconnoitre us: and after having rode round\nus twice, myself still facing about as they rode, went off the same\nway they came, at a hand gallop. A gentleman's servant coming up with a\nhorse at the same time, I offered him a crown to assist me in pursuing\nthem, which he no sooner accepted, than I armed him with the officer's\npistols, and we galloped after the thieves, who, trusting to the\nswiftness of their horses, stopped till we came within shot of them and\nthen, firing at us, put their nags to the full speed. We followed them\nas fast as our beasts could carry us; but, not being so well mounted as\nthey, our efforts would have been to little purpose, had not the horse\nof one of them stumbled, and thrown his rider with such violence over\nhis head, that he lay senseless when we came up, and was taken without\nthe least opposition; while his comrade consulted his own safety in\nflight, without regarding the distress of his friend. We scarce had\ntime to make ourselves masters of his arms, and tie his hands together,\nbefore he recovered his senses, when, learning his situation he affected\nsurprise, demanded to know by what authority we used a gentleman in\nthat manner, and had the impudence to threaten us with a prosecution for\nrobbery. In the meantime, we perceived Strap coming up with a crowd of\npeople, armed up with different kinds of weapons; and among the rest a\nfarmer, who no sooner perceived the thief, whom we had secured, than he\ncried with great emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's the fellow who robbed me an hour ago\nof twenty pounds, in a canvas bag.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was immediately searched, and the\nmoney found exactly as it had been described; upon which we committed\nhim to the charge of the countryman, who carried him to the town\nof Hounslow, which, it seems, the farmer had alarmed; and I, having\nsatisfied the footman for his trouble, according to promise, returned\nwith Strap to the coach, where I found the captain and lawyer busy in\nadministering smelling bottles and cordials to the grave lady, who had\ngone into a fit at the noise of firing.\n\nWhen I had taken my seat, Miss Snapper, who from the coach had seen\neverything that happened; made me a compliment on my behaviour, and said\nshe was glad to see me returned without having received any injury; her\nmother too owned herself obliged to my resolution: the lawyer told me,\nthat I was entitled by act of parliament to a reward of forty pounds,\nfor having apprehended a highwayman. The soldier observed, with a\ncountenance in which impudence and shame struggling, produced some\ndisorder, that if I had not been in such a d--d hurry to get out of the\ncoach, he would have secured the rogues effectually, without all this\nbustle and loss of time, by a scheme, which my heat and precipitation\nruined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my own part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am always extremely cool on\nthese occasions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it appeared, by your trembling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young\nlady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath and d--ion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour sex protects you, madam; if\nany man on earth durst tell me so much, I'd send him to hell, d--n my\nheart! in an instant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked\nif I had seen him tremble? I answered without hesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--me,\nsir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd'ye doubt my courage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This\ndeclaration quite disconcerted him. He looked blank, and pronounced with\na faltering voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! it's very well: d--n my blood! I shall find\na time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I signified my contempt of him, by thrusting my tongue in my\ncheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath\naloud during the whole journey.\n\nThe precise lady, having recruited her spirits by the help of some\nstrong waters, began a soliloquy, in which she wondered that any man,\nwho pretended to maintain the character of a gentleman, could, for\nthe sake of a little paltry coin, throw persons of honour into such\nquandaries as might endanger their lives; and professed her surprise\nthat women were not ashamed to commend such brutality. At the same time\nvowing that for the future she would never set foot in a stage coach, if\na private convenience could be had for love or money.\n\nNettled at her remarks, I took the same method of conveying my\nsentiments, and wondered in my turn, that any woman of common sense\nshould be so unreasonable as to expect that people, who had neither\nacquaintance nor connection with her, would tamely allow themselves to\nbe robbed and maltreated, merely to indulge her capricious humour. I\nlikewise confessed my astonishment at her insolence and ingratitude\nin taxing a person with brutality, who deserved her approbation and\nacknowledgment; and vowed that, if ever she should be assaulted again,\nI would leave her to the mercy of the spoiler, that she might know the\nvalue of my protection.\n\nThis person of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation\nany further, but seemed to chew the cud of her resentment with the\ncrestfallen captain, while I entered into discourse with my charmer, who\nwas the more pleased with my conversation, as she had conceived a very\nindifferent opinion of my intellects from my former silence. I should\nhave had cause to be equally satisfied with the sprightliness of her\ngenius, could she have curbed her imagination with judgment; but she\nlaboured under such a profusion of talk, that I dreaded her unruly\ntongue, and felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal clack!\nHowever, when I considered, on the other hand, the joys attending the\npossession of twenty thousand pounds, I forgot her imperfections,\nseized occasion by the forelock, and tried to insinuate myself into her\naffection. The careful mother kept a strict watch over her and though\nshe could not help behaving civilly to me, took frequent opportunities\nof discouraging our communication, by reprimanding her for being so free\nwith strangers, and telling her she must learn to speak less and think\nmore. Abridged of the use of speech, we conversed with our eyes, and I\nfound the young lady very eloquent in this kind of discourse. In short,\nI had reason to believe that she was sick of the old gentlewoman's\ntuition, and that I should find it no difficult matter to supersede her\nauthority.\n\nWhen we arrived at the place where we were to breakfast, I alighted, and\nhelped my mistress out of the coach, as well as her mother who called\nfor a private room to which they withdrew in order to eat by themselves.\nAs they retired together, I perceived that Miss had got more twists from\nnature than I had before observed for she was bent sideways into the\nfigure of an S, so that her progression very much resembled that of a\ncrab. The prude also chose the captain for her messmate, and ordered\nbreakfast for two only, to be brought into another separate room: while\nthe lawyer and I, deserted by the rest of the company, were fain to put\nup with each other. I was a good deal chagrined at the stately\nreserve of Mrs. Snapper, who, I thought, did not use me with all the\ncomplaisance I deserved; and my companion declared that he had been a\ntraveller for twenty years, and never knew the stage coach rules so much\ninfringed before. As for the honourable gentlewoman I could not conceive\nthe meaning of her attachment to the lieutenant; and asked the lawyer\nif he knew for which of the soldier's virtues she admired him? The\ncounsellor facetiously replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose the lady knows him to be an\nable conveyancer, and wants him to make a settlement in tail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could\nnot help laughing at the archness of the barrister, who entertained\nme during breakfast with a great deal of wit of the same kind, at the\nexpense of our fellow travellers; and among other things said, he was\nsorry to find the young lady saddled with such incumbrances.\n\nWhen we had made an end of our repast, and paid our reckoning, we went\ninto the coach, took our places, and bribed the driver with sixpence to\nrevenge us on the rest of his fare, by hurrying them away in the midst\nof their meal. This task he performed to our satisfaction, after he had\ndisturbed their enjoyment with his importunate clamour. The mother and\ndaughter obeyed the summons first, and, coming to the coach door, were\nobliged to desire the coachman's assistance to get in, because the\nlawyer and I had agreed to show our resentment by our neglect. They were\nno sooner seated, than the captain appeared, as much heated as if he had\nbeen pursued a dozen miles by an enemy; and immediately after him came\nthe lady, not without some marks of disorder. Having helped her up,\nhe entered himself, growling a few oaths against the coachman for his\nimpertinent interruption; and the lawyer comforted him by saying, that\nif he had suffered a nisi prius through the obstinacy of the defendant,\nhe might have an opportunity to join issue at the next stage. This last\nexpression gave offence to the grave gentlewoman, who told him, if she\nwas a man, she would make him repent of such obscenity, and thanked\nGod, he had never been in such company before. At this insinuation the\ncaptain thought himself under a necessity of espousing the lady's cause;\nand accordingly threatened to cut off the lawyer's ears, if he should\ngive his tongue any such liberties for the future. The poor counsellor\nbegged pardon, and universal silence ensued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nI resolve to ingratiate myself with the Mother, and am favoured by\naccident--the Precise Lady finds her husband, and quit the Coach--the\nCaptain is disappointed of his dinner--we arrive at Bath--I accompany\nMiss Snapper to the Long-room, where she is attacked by beau Nash,\nand, turns the Laugh against him--I make love to her, and receive a\ncheck--Squire her to an Assembly, where I am blessed with a Sight of\nmy dear Narcissa, which discomposes me so much, that Miss Snapper,\nobserving my disorder, is at pains to discover the Cause--is piqued at\nthe Occasion, and, in our way home, pays me a sarcastic Compliment--I\nam met by Miss Williams, who is the maid and Confidante of Narcissa--she\nacquaints me with her Lady's regard for me while under the disguise of\na Servant, and describes the Transports of Narcissa on seeing me at\nthe Assembly, in the Character of a Gentleman--I am surprised with an\nAccount of her Aunt's Marriage, and make an Appointment to meet Miss\nWilliams the next day\n\nDuring this unsocial interval, my pride and interest maintained a severe\nconflict on the subject of Miss Snapper, whom the one represented as\nunworthy of notice, and the other proposed as the object of my whole\nattention: the advantages and disadvantages of such a match were opposed\nto one another by my imagination; and, at length, my judgment gave it so\nmuch in favour of the first, that I resolved to prosecute my scheme with\nall the address in my power. I thought I perceived some concern in her\ncountenance, occasioned by my silence, which she, no doubt, imputed to\nmy disgust at her mother's behaviour; and, as I believed the old woman\ncould not fail of ascribing my muteness to the same motive, I determined\nto continue that sullen conduct towards her, and fall upon some other\nmethod of manifesting my esteem for the daughter, nor was it difficult\nfor me to make her acquainted with my sentiments by the expression of\nmy looks, which I modelled into the character of humanity and love; and\nwhich were answered by her with all the sympathy and approbation I\ncould desire. But when I began to consider, that, without further\nopportunities of improving my success, all the progress I had hitherto\nmade would not much avail, and that such opportunities could not\nbe enjoyed without the mother's permission, I concluded it would be\nrequisite to vanquish her coldness and suspicion by my assiduities and\nrespectful behaviour on the road; and she would, in all likelihood,\ninvite me to visit her at Bath, where I did not fear of being able\nto cultivate her acquaintance as much as would be necessary to the\naccomplishment of my purpose. And indeed accident furnished me with\nan opportunity of obliging her so much that she could not, with any\nappearance of good manners, forbear to gratify my inclination.\n\nWhen we arrived at our dining-place, we found all the eatables at the\ninn bespoke by a certain nobleman, who had got the start of us and, in\nall likelihood, my mistress and her mother must have dined with Duke\nHumphrey, had I not exerted myself in their behalf, and bribed the\nlandlord with a glass of wine to curtail his lordship's entertainment\nof a couple of fowls and some bacon, which I sent with my compliments to\nthe ladies. They accepted my treat with a great many thanks, and desired\nI would favour them with my company at dinner, where I amused the old\ngentlewoman so successfully, by maintaining a seemingly disinterested\nease in the midst of my civility, that she signified a desire of being\nbetter acquainted, and hoped I would be so kind as to see her sometimes\nat Bath. While I enjoyed myself in this manner, the precise lady had the\ngood fortune to meet with her husband, who was no other than gentleman,\nor, in other words, valet-de-chambre, to the very nobleman whose coach\nstood at the door. Proud of the interest she had in the house, she\naffected to show her power by introducing the captain to her spouse as a\nperson who had treated her with great civility upon which he was invited\nto a share of their dinner; while the poor lawyer, finding himself\nutterly abandoned, made application to me, and was through my\nintercession admitted into our company. Having satisfied our appetites,\nand made ourselves merry at the expense of the person of honour, the\ncivil captain, and complaisant husband, I did myself the pleasure of\ndischarging the bill by stealth, for which I received a great many\napologies and acknowledgments from my guests, and we re-embarked at the\nfirst warning. The officer was obliged, at last, to appease his hunger\nwith a luncheon of bread and cheese, and a pint bottle of brandy, which\nhe dispatched in the coach, cursing the inappetence of his lordship, who\nhad ordered dinner to be put back a whole hour.\n\nNothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey,\nwhich was finished next day, when I waited on the ladies to the house of\na relation, in which they intended to lodge, and, passing that night at\nthe inn, took lodgings in the morning for myself.\n\nThe forenoon was spent in visiting everything that was worth seeing in\nthe place, in company with a gentleman to whom Banter had given me a\nletter of introduction; and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies, and\nfound Miss a good deal indisposed with the fatigue of their journey. As\nthey foresaw they should have occasion for a male acquaintance to squire\nthem at all public places, I was received with great cordiality, and had\nthe mother's permission to conduct them next day to the Long Room, which\nwe no sooner entered, than the eyes of everybody present were turned\nupon us, and, when we had suffered the martyrdom of their looks for some\ntime, a whisper circulated at our expense, which was accompanied with\nmany contemptuous smiles and tittering observations, to my utter shame\nand confusion. I did not so much conduct as follow my charge to a place\nwhere she seated her mother and herself with astonishing composure\nnotwithstanding the unmannerly behaviour of the whole company,\nwhich seemed to be assumed merely to put her out of countenance. The\ncelebrated Mr. Nash, who commonly attends in this place, as master of\nthe ceremonies, perceiving the disposition of the assembly, took upon\nhimself the task of gratifying their ill-nature further, by exposing my\nmistress to the edge of his wit. With this view he approached us, with\nmany bows and grimaces, and, after having welcomed Miss Snapper to the\nplace, asked her in the hearing of all present, if she could inform him\nof the name of Tobit's dog. Miss was so much incensed at his insolence,\nthat I should certainly have kicked him where he stood without ceremony,\nhad not the young lady prevented the effects of my indignation, by\nreplying with the utmost vivacity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis name was Nash, and an impudent\ndog he was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This repartee so unexpected and just, raised such\na universal laugh at the aggressor, that all his assurance was\ninsufficient to support him under their derision; so that, after he had\nendeavoured to compose himself by taking snuff and forcing a smile, he\nwas obliged to sneak off in a ludicrous attitude, while my Dulcinea\nwas applauded to the skies for the brilliancy of her wit, and her\nacquaintance immediately courted by the best people of both sexes in the\nroom.\n\nThis event, with which I was indefinitely pleased at first, did not fail\nof alarming me, upon further reflection, when I considered, that the\nmore she was caressed by persons of distinction, the more her pride\nwould be inflamed, and consequently, the obstacles to my success\nmultiplied and enlarged. Nor were my presaging fears untrue. That very\nnight I perceived her a little intoxicated with the incense she had\nreceived, and, though, she still behaved with a particular civility to\nme, I foresaw, that, as soon as her fortune should be known, she would\nbe surrounded with a swarm of admirers, some of whom might possibly, by\nexcelling me on point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery and scandal,\nsupplant me in her esteem, and find means to make the mother of his\nparty. I resolved therefore to lose no time, and, being invited to\nspend the evening with them, found an opportunity, in spite of the old\ngentlewoman's vigilance, to explain the meaning of my glances in the\ncoach, by paying homage to her wit, and professing myself enamoured of\nher person. She blushed at my declaration and in a favourable manner\ndisapproved of the liberty I had taken, putting me in mind of our\nbeing strangers to each other, and desiring I would not be the means\nof interrupting our acquaintance, by any such unseasonable strokes of\ngallantry for the future. My ardour was effectually checked by this\nreprimand, which was, however, delivered in a gentle manner, that I had\nno cause to be disobliged; and the arrival of her mother relieved me\nfrom a dilemma in which I should not have known how to demean myself\na minute longer. Neither could I resume the easiness of carriage with\nwhich I came in; my mistress acted on the reserve, and the conversation\nbeginning to flag, the old lady introduced her kinswoman of the house,\nand proposed a hand at whist.\n\nWhile we amused ourselves at this diversion, I understood from the\ngentlewoman, that there was to be an assembly next night at which I\nbegged to have the honour of dancing with Miss. She thanked me for the\nfavour I intended her, assured me she never did dance, but signified\na desire of seeing the company, when I offered my service, which was\naccepted, not a little proud of being exempted from appearing with her\nin a situation, that, notwithstanding my profession to the contrary, was\nnot at all agreeable to my inclination.\n\nHaving supped, and continued the game, till such time as the successive\nyawns of the mother warned me to be gone, I took my leave, and went\nhome, where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progress. Next\nday I put on my gayest apparel, and went to drink tea at Mrs.\nSnapper's, according to appointment, when I found, to my inexpressible\nsatisfaction, that she was laid up with the toothache, and that Miss was\nto be intrusted to my care. Accordingly, we set out for the ball-room\npretty early in the evening, and took possession of a commodious place,\nwhere we had not sat longer than a quarter of an hour, when a gentleman,\ndressed in a green frock, came in, leading a young lady, whom I\nimmediately discovered to be the adorable Narcissa! Good heaven! what\nwere the thrillings of my soul at that instant! my reflection was\noverwhelmed with a torrent of agitation! my heart throbbed with\nsurprising violence! a sudden mist overspread my eyes, my ears were\ninvaded with a dreadful sound! I panted for want of breath, and, in\nshort, was for some moments entranced! This first tumult subsiding, a\ncrowd of flattering ideas rushed upon my imagination. Everything, that\nwas soft, sensible, and engaging, in the character of that dear creature\nrecurred to my remembrance, and every favourable circumstance of my\nown qualifications appeared in all the aggravation of self-conceit, to\nheighten my expectation! Neither was this transport of long duration.\nThe dread of her being already disposed of intervened, and overcast my\nenchanting reverie! My presaging apprehension represented her encircled\nin the arms of some happy rival, and in consequence for ever lost to\nme. I was stung with this suggestion, and, believing the person who\nconducted her to be the husband of this amiable young lady, already\ndevoted him to my fury, and stood up to mark him for my vengeance, when\nI recollected, to my unspeakable joy, her brother the fox-hunter, in the\nperson of her gallant.\n\nUndeceived so much to my satisfaction in this particular, I gazed in\na frenzy of delight on the irresistible charms of his sister, who\nno sooner distinguished me in the crowd, than her evident confusion\nafforded a happy omen to my flame. At sight of me she started, the roses\ninstantly vanished from her polished cheeks, and returned in a\nmoment with a double glow, that overspread her lovely neck, while her\nenchanting bosom heaved with strong emotion. I hailed these favourable\nsymptoms, and, lying in wait for her looks, did homage with my eyes. She\nseemed to approve my declaration, by the complacency of her aspect; and\nI was so transported with the discovery, that more than once I was on\nthe point of making up to her, to disclose the throbbings of my heart\nin person, had not that profound veneration, which her presence always\ninspired, restrained the unseasonable impulse. All my powers being\nengrossed in this manner, it may easily be imagined how ill I\nentertained Miss Snapper on whom I could not now turn my eyes, without\nmaking comparisons very little to her advantage. It was not even in my\npower to return distinct answers to the questions she asked from time\nto time, so that she could not help observing my absence of mind; and\nhaving a turn for observation, watched my glances, and, tracing them to\nthe divine object, discovered the cause of my disorder. That she might,\nhowever, be convinced of the truth of her conjecture, she began to\ninterrogate me with regard to Narcissa, and, notwithstanding all my\nendeavours to disguise my sentiments, perceived my attachment by my\nconfusion: upon which, she assumed a stateliness of behaviour, and sat\nsilent during the remaining part of the entertainment. At any other\ntime, her suspicion would have alarmed me: but now I was elevated by my\npassion above every other consideration. The mistress of my soul\nhaving retired with her brother, I discovered so much uneasiness at my\nsituation, that Miss Snapper proposed to go home; and, while I conducted\nher to a chair, told me she had too great a regard for me to keep me any\nlonger in torment. I feigned ignorance of her meaning, and having seen\nher safely at her lodgings, took my leave, and went home in an ecstasy,\nwhere I disclosed everything that had happened to my confidant and\nhumble servant, Strap, who did not relish the accident so well as I\nexpected; and observed, that a bird in the hand is worth two in the\nbush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know best--you know best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Next day,\nas, I went to the Pump Room, in hopes of seeing or hearing some tidings\nof my fair enslaver, I was met by a gentlewoman, who, having looked hard\nat me, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Christ, Mr. Random!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Surprised at this exclamation,\nI examined the countenance of the person who spoke, and immediately\nrecognised my old sweetheart and fellow sufferer, Miss Williams.\n\nI was mightily pleased to find this unfortunate woman under such a\ndecent appearance, professed my joy at seeing her so well, and desired\nto know where I should have the pleasure of her conversation. She was as\nheartily rejoiced at the apparent easiness of my fortune, and gave me\nto know that she, as yet, had no habitation that she could properly call\nher own; but would wait on me at any place I should please to appoint.\nUnderstanding that she was unengaged for the present, I showed her the\nway to my lodgings, where, after a very affectionate salutation, she\ninformed me of her being very happy in the service of a young lady\nto whom she was recommended by a former mistress deceased, into\nwhose family she had recommended herself by the honest deceit she had\nconcerted, while she lived with me in the garret at London. She then\nexpressed a vehement desire to be acquainted with the vicissitudes of\nmy life since we parted, and excused her curiosity on account of the\nconcern she had for my interest. I forthwith gratified her request, and,\nwhen I described my situation in Sussex, perceived her to attend to my\nstory with particular eagerness. She interrupted me, when I had finished\nthat period, with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God! is it possible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then begged I would\nbe so good as to continue my relation; which I did as briefly as I\ncould, burning with impatience to know the cause of her surprise, about\nwhich I had already formed a very interesting conjecture.\n\nWhen I had brought my adventures down to the present day, who seemed\nvery much affected with the different circumstances of my fortune; and\nsaying, with a smile, she believed my distresses were now at a period,\nproceeded to inform me that the lady whom she served was no other than\nthe charming Narcissa, who had honoured her with her confidence for some\ntime; in consequence of which trust, she had often repeated the story\nof John Brown with great admiration and regard; that she loved to dwell\nupon the particulars of his character, and did not scruple to own a\ntender approbation of his flame. I became delirious at this piece of\nintelligence, strained Miss Williams in my embrace, called her the angel\nof my happiness, and acted such extravagances, that she might have\nbeen convinced of my sincerity, had she not been satisfied of my honour\nbefore. As soon as was in condition to yield attention, she described\nthe present situation of her mistress, who had no sooner reached her\nlodgings the night before, than she closeted her, and in a rapture of\njoy gave her to know that she had seen me at the ball, where I appeared\nin the character which she always thought my due, with such advantage of\ntransformation that, unless my image had been engraven on her heart, it\nwould have been impossible to know me for the person who had worn her\naunt's livery; that by the language of my eyes, she was assured of\nthe continuance of my passion for her, and consequently of my being\nunengaged to any other; and that, though she did not doubt I would\nspeedily fall upon some method of being introduced, she was so impatient\nto hear of me, that she (Miss Williams) had been sent abroad this very\nmorning, on purpose to learn the name and character I at present bore.\nMy bosom had been hitherto a stranger to such a flood of joy as now\nrushed upon it; my faculties were overborne by the tide; it was some\ntime before I could open my mouth, and much longer ere I could utter\na coherent sentence. At length, I fervently requested her to lead\nme immediately to the object of my adoration; but she resisted my\nimportunity, and explained the danger of such premature conduct. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\nfavourable soever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy lady's inclination towards you may\nbe, you may depend upon it, she will not commit the smallest trespass on\ndecorum, either in disclosing her own, or in receiving a declaration\nof your passion: and, although the great veneration I have for you has\nprompted me to reveal what she communicated to me in confidence, I know\nso well the severity of her sentiments with respect to the punctilios of\nher sex that, if she should learn the least surmise of it, she would not\nonly dismiss me as a wretch unworthy of her benevolence, but also for\never shun the efforts of your love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I assented to the justness of\nher remonstrance, and desired she would assist me with her advice and\ndirection: upon which it was concerted between us, that for the present\nI should be contented with her telling Narcissa that, in the course of\nher inquiries, she could only learn my name: and that, if, in a day\nor two, I could fall upon no other method of being introduced to her\nmistress, she would deliver a letter from me, on pretence of consulting\nher happiness: and say that I met her in the streets, and bribed her\nto this piece of service. Matters being thus adjusted, I kept my old\nacquaintance to breakfast, and learned from her conversation, that my\nrival Sir Timothy had drunk himself into an apoplexy, of which he died\nfive months ago; that the savage was still unmarried and that his aunt\nhad been seized with a whim which he little expected, and chosen the\nschoolmaster of the parish for her lord and husband: but matrimony not\nagreeing with her constitution she had been hectic and dropsical a\ngood while, and was now at Bath, in order to drink the waters for the\nrecovery of her health; that her niece had accompanied her thither\nat her request, and attended her with the same affection as before,\nnotwithstanding the mistake she had committed: and that the nephew,\nwho had been exasperated at the loss of her fortune, did not give his\nattendance out of good will, but purely to have an eye on his sister,\nlest she should likewise throw herself away without his consent or\napprobation. Having enjoyed ourselves in this manner, and made an\nassignation to meet next day at a certain place, Miss Williams took her\nleave; and Strap's looks being very inquisitive about the nature of\nthe communication subsisting between us, I made him acquainted with the\nwhole affair, to his great astonishment and satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nI become acquainted with Narcissa's brother, who invites me to his\nHouse, where I am introduced to that adorable Creature--after dinner,\nthe Squire retires to take his nap--Freeman, guessing the Situation of\nmy Thought, withdraws likewise, on pretence of Business--I declare\nmy passion for Narcissa--am well-received--charmed with her\nConversation--the Squire detains us to Supper--I elude his design by a\nStratagem, and get home sober\n\nIn the afternoon, I drank tea at the house of Mr. Freeman, to whom I had\nbeen recommended by Banter; where I had not sat five minutes, till the\nfoxhunter came in, and by his familiar behaviour appeared to be intimate\nwith my friend. I was, at first, under some concern, lest he should\nrecollect my features; but when I found myself introduced to him as\na gentleman from London, without being discovered, I blessed the\nopportunity that brought me into his company; hoping that, in the course\nof my acquaintance, he would invite me to his house; nor were my hopes\nfrustrated, for, as we spent the evening together, he grew extremely\nfond of my conversation, asked a great many childish questions about\nFrance and foreign parts; and seemed so highly entertained with my\nanswers, that in his cups he shook me often by the hand, pronounced me\nan honest fellow, and in fine desired our company at dinner next day, at\nhis civil house. My imagination was so much employed in anticipating the\nhappiness I was to enjoy next day, that I slept very little that night;\nbut, rising early in the morning, went to the place appointed, where I\nmet my she-friend, and imparted to her my success with the squire. She\nwas very much pleased at the occasion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould not\nfail of being agreeable to Narcissa, who, in spite of her passion\nfor me, had mentioned some scruples relating to my true situation and\ncharacter, which the delicacy of her sentiments suggested, and which she\nbelieved I would find it necessary to remove, though she did not know\nhow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was a good deal startled at this insinuation, because I foresaw\nthe difficulty I should find in barely doing myself justice: for,\nalthough it never was my intention to impose myself upon any woman, much\nless on Narcissa, I laid claim to the character of a gentleman by birth,\neducation, and behaviour; and yet (so unlucky had the circumstances of\nmy life fallen out) I should find it a very hard matter to make good my\npretensions even to these, especially to the last, which was the most\nessential. Miss Williams was as sensible as I of this my disadvantage,\nbut comforted me with observing that, when once a woman has bestowed her\naffections on a man, she cannot help judging of him in all respects\nwith a partiality easily influenced in his favour: she remarked that,\nalthough some situations of my life had been low, yet none of them had\nbeen infamous; that my indigence had been the crime not of me, but\nof fortune; and that the miseries I had undergone, by improving the\nfaculties both of mind and body, qualified me the more for any dignified\nstation; and would of consequence recommend me to the good graces of\nany sensible woman: she therefore advised me to be always open and\nunreserved to the inquiries of my mistress, without unnecessarily\nbetraying the meanest occurrences of my fate; and trust to the strength\nof her love and reflection for the rest.\n\nThe sentiments of this sensible young woman on this, as well as on\nalmost every other subject, perfectly agreed with mine. I thanked her\nfor the care she took of my interests, and, promising to behave myself\naccording to her directions we parted, after she had assured me that I\ndepend upon her best offices with her mistress, and that she would from\ntime to time communicate to me such intelligence as she could procure,\nrelating to my flame. Having dressed myself to the best advantage, I\nwaited for the time of dinner with the most fearful impatience; and, as\nthe hour drew near, my heart beat with such increased velocity, and my\nspirits contracted such disorder, that I began to suspect my resolution,\nand even to wish myself disengaged. At last Mr. Freeman called at my\nlodgings in his way, and I accompanied him to the house where all my\nhappiness was deposited. We were very kindly received by the squire, who\nsat smoking his pipe in a parlour, and asked if we chose to drink any\nthing before dinner: though I never had more occasion for a cordial, I\nwas ashamed to accept his offer, which was also refused, by my friend.\nWe sat down, however, entered into conversation, which lasted half-an\nhour, so that I had time to recollect myself; and (so capricious were\nmy thoughts) even to hope that Narcissa would not appear--when, all of\na sudden, a servant coming in, gave us notice that dinner was upon the\ntable, and my perturbation returned with such violence that I could\nscarcely conceal it from the company, as I ascended the staircase. When\nI entered the dining-room, the first object that saluted my ravished\neyes was the divine Narcissa, blushing like Aurora, adorned with all the\ngraces that meekness, innocence, and beauty can diffuse! I was seized\nwith a giddiness, my knees tottered and I scarce had strength enough to\nperform the ceremony of salutation, when her brother, slapping me on the\nshoulder, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeasure Randan, that there is my sister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I approached\nher with eagerness and fear; but in the moment of our embrace, my soul\nwas agonized with rapture! It was a lucky circumstance for us both, that\nmy entertainer was not endued with an uncommon stock of penetration; for\nour mutual confusion was so manifest that Mr. Freeman perceived it, and\nas we went home together, congratulated me on my good fortune. But so\nfar was Bruin from entertaining the least suspicion, that he encouraged\nme to begin a conversation with my mistress in a language unknown to\nhim, by telling her, that he had a gentleman who could jabber with\nher in French and other foreign lingoes as fast as she pleased; then,\nturning to me, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds bobs! I wish you would hold discourse with\nher in your French or Italian, and tell me if she understands it as well\nas she would be thought to do. There's her aunt and she will chatter\ntogether whole days in it, and I can't have a mouthful of English for\nlove or money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I consulted the look of my amiable mistress and found\nher averse to his proposal, which indeed she declined with a sweetness\nof denial peculiar to herself, as a piece of disrespect to that part of\nthe company which did not understand the language in question. As I had\nthe happiness of sitting opposite to her, I feasted my eyes much more\nthan my palate which she tempted in vain with the most delicious bits\ncarved by her fair hand, and recommended by her persuasive tongue; but\nall my other appetites were swallowed up in immensity of my love,\nwhich I fed by gazing incessantly on the delightful object. Dinner was\nscarcely ended, when the squire became very drowsy, and after several\ndreadful yawns, got up, stretched himself, took two or three turns\nacross the room, begged we would allow him to take a short nap, and,\nhaving laid a strong injunction on his sister to detain us till his\nreturn, went to his repose without further ceremony. He had not been\ngone many minutes, when Freeman, guessing the situation of my heart, and\nthinking he could not do me a greater favour than to leave me alone with\nNarcissa, pretended to recollect himself all of a sudden, and, starting\nup, begged the lady pardon for half-an-hour, for he had unluckily\nremembered an engagement of some consequence, that he must perform at\nthat instant: so saying, he took his leave, promising to come back time\nenough for tea, leaving my mistress and me in great confusion.\n\nNow that I enjoyed an opportunity of disclosing the paintings of\nmy soul, I had not the power to use it. I studied many pathetic\ndeclarations, but, when I attempted to give them utterance, my tongue\ndenied its office and she sat silent with a downcast look full of\nanxious alarm, her bosom heaving with expectation of some great event.\nAt length I endeavoured to put an end to this solemn pause, and began\nwith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very surprising, madam, madam\u00e2\u0080\u009d--here the sound dying away,\nI made a full stop; while Narcissa, starting, blushed, and, with a timid\naccent answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Confounded at this note of interrogation, I\npronounced with the most sheepish bashfulness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which she\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg pardon--I thought you had spoken to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another pause\nensued--I made another effort, and, though my voice faltered very much\nat the beginning, made shift to express myself in this manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say,\nmadam, it is very surprising that love should act so inconsistently with\nitself, as to deprive its votaries of the use of their faculties, when\nthey have most need of them. Since the happy occasion of being alone\nwith you presented itself, I have made many unsuccessful attempts to\ndeclare a passion for the loveliest of her sex--a passion which took\npossession of my soul, while my cruel fate compelled me to wear a\nservile disguise so unsuitable to my birth, sentiments, and let me\nadd, my deserts; yet favourable in one respect, as it furnished me with\nopportunities of seeing and adoring your perfections. Yes, madam, it was\nthen your dear idea entered my bosom, where it has lived unimpaired\nin the midst of numberless cares, and animated me against a thousand\ndangers and calamities!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile I spoke thus, she concealed her face with her fan, and when I\nceased speaking, recovering herself from the most beautiful confusion,\ntold me she thought herself very much obliged by my favourable opinion\nof her, and that she was very sorry to hear I had been unfortunate.\nEncouraged by this gentle reply, I proceeded, owned myself sufficiently\nrecompensed by her kind compassion for what I had undergone, and\ndeclared the future happiness of my life depended solely upon her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be very ungrateful, if after the signal\nprotection you once afforded me, I should refuse to contribute towards\nyour happiness in any reasonable condescension.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Transported at this\nacknowledgment I threw myself at her feet, and begged she would regard\nmy passion with a favourable eye. She was alarmed at my behaviour,\nentreated me to rise lest her brother should discover me in that\nposture, and to spare her for the present upon a subject for which she\nwas altogether unprepared. In consequence of this remonstrance, I rose,\nassuring her I would rather die than disobey her: but in the meantime\nbegged her to consider how precious the minutes of this opportunity\nwere, and what restraint I put upon my inclinations, in sacrificing them\nto her desire. She smiled with unspeakable sweetness, and said there\nwould be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the good\nopinion her brother had conceived of me, and I, enchanted by her charms,\nseized her hand, which I well nigh devoured with kisses. But she checked\nmy boldness with a severity of countenance, and desired I would not so\nfar forget myself to her, as to endanger the esteem she had for me;\nshe reminded me of our being almost strangers to each other, and of the\nnecessity there was for her knowing me better, before she could take any\nresolution in my favour; and, in short, mingled so much good sense\nand complacency in her reproof, that I became as much enamoured of her\nunderstanding as I had been before of her beauty, and asked pardon for\nmy presumption with the utmost reverence of conviction. She forgave my\noffence with her usual affability, and sealed my pardon with a look so\nfull of bewitching tenderness, that, for some minutes, my senses were\nlost in ecstacy! I afterwards endeavoured to regulate my behaviour\naccording to her desire, and turn the conversation upon a more\nindifferent subject; but her presence was an insurmountable obstacle to\nmy design; while I beheld so much excellence, I found it impossible to\ncall my attention from the contemplation of it! I gazed with unutterable\nfondness! I grew mad with admiration! \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy condition is insupportable!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried I: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am distracted with passion! Why are you so exquisitely\nfair?--why are you so enchantingly good?--why has nature dignified you\nwith charms so much above the standard of woman? and, wretch that I am,\nhow dare my unworthiness aspire to the enjoyment of such perfection!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was startled at my ravings, reasoned down my transport, and by\nher irresistible eloquence, soothed my soul into a state of tranquil\nfelicity; but, lest I might suffer a relapse, industriously promoted\nother subjects to entertain my imagination. She chid me for having\nomitted to inquire about her aunt who (she assured me), in the midst\nof all her absence of temper, and detachment from common affairs, often\ntalked of me with uncommon warmth. I professed my veneration for the\ngood lady, excused my omission, by imputing it to the violence of my\nlove, which engrossed my whole soul, and desired to know the situation\nof her health. Upon which, the amiable Narcissa repeated what I had\nheard before of her marriage, with all the tenderness for her reputation\nthat the subject would admit of; told me she lived with her husband\nhard by, and was so much afflicted with the dropsy, and wasted by a\nconsumption, that she had small hopes of her recovery. Having expressed\nmy sorrow for her distemper, I questioned her about my good friend, Mrs.\nSagely, who, I learned to my great satisfaction, was in good health,\nand who had by the encomiums she bestowed upon me after I was gone,\nconfirmed the favourable impression my behaviour at parting had made\non Narcissa's heart. This circumstance introduced an inquiry into the\nconduct of Sir Timothy Thicket, who (she informed me) had found means to\nincense her brother so much against me that she found it impossible\nto undeceive him: but, on the contrary, suffered very much in her own\ncharacter by his scandalous insinuations; that the whole parish was\nalarmed, and actually in pursuit of me; so that she had been in the\nutmost consternation on my account, well knowing how little my own\ninnocence and her testimony would have weighed with the ignorance,\nprejudice, and brutality of those who must have judged me, had I\nbeen apprehended; that Sir Timothy, having been seized with a fit of\napoplexy, from which with great difficulty he was recovered, began to be\napprehensive of death, and to prepare himself accordingly for that great\nevent; as a step to which he sent for her brother, owned with great\ncontrition the brutal design he had upon her, and in consequence\nacquitted me of the assault, robbery, and correspondence with her, which\nhe had laid to my charge; after which confession he lived about a month\nin a languishing condition, and was carried off by a second assault.\n\nEvery word that this dear creature spoke, riveted the chains with\nwhich she held me enslaved! My mischievous fancy began to work, and\nthe tempest of my passion to wake again, when the return of Freeman\ndestroyed the tempting opportunity, and enabled me to quell the rising\ntumult. A little while after, the squire staggered into the room,\nrubbing his eyes, and called for his tea, which he drank out of a small\nbowl, qualified with brandy; while we took it in the usual way, Narcissa\nleft us in order to visit her aunt; and when Freeman and I proposed to\ntake our leave, the foxhunter insisted on our spending the evening at\nhis house with such obstinacy of affection, that we were obliged to\ncomply. For my own part, I should have been glad of the invitation, by\nwhich, in all likelihood, I should be blessed with more of his sisters\ncompany, had I not been afraid of risking her esteem, by entering into\na debauch of drinking with him, which, from the knowledge of his\ncharacter, I foresaw would happen: but there was no remedy. I was forced\nto rely upon the strength of my constitution, which I hoped would resist\nintoxication longer than the squire's, and to trust to the good nature\nand discretion of my mistress for the rest.\n\nOur entertainer, resolving to begin by times, ordered the table to\nbe furnished with liquor and glasses immediately after tea, but we\nabsolutely refused to set in for drinking so soon; and prevailed upon\nhim to pass away an hour or two at whist, in which we engaged as soon\nas Narcissa returned. The savage and I happened to be partners at first,\nand, as my thoughts were wholly employed in a more interesting game, I\nplayed so ill that he lost all patience, swore bitterly, and threatened\nto call for wine, if they would not grant him another associate. This\ndesire was gratified, and Narcissa and I were of a side; he won for\nthe same reason that made him lose before; I was satisfied, my lovely\npartner did not repine, and the time slipped away very agreeably, until\nwe were told that supper was served in another room.\n\nThe squire was enraged to find the evening so unprofitably spent, and\nwreaked his vengeance on the cards, which he tore, and committed to the\nflames with many execrations; threatening to make us redeem our loss\nwith a large glass and quick circulation; and indeed we had no sooner\nsupped, and my charmer withdrawn, than he began to put his threat in\nexecution. Three bottles of port (for he drank no other sort of\nwine) were placed before us, with as many water glasses, which were\nimmediately filled to the brim, after his example, by each out of his\nrespective allowance, and emptied in a trice to the best in Christendom.\nThough I swallowed this, and the next, as fast as the glass could be\nreplenished, without hesitation or show of reluctance, I perceived\nthat my brain would not be able to bear many bumpers of this sort, and\ndreading the perseverance of a champion who began with such vigour, I\ndetermined to make up for the deficiency of my strength by a stratagem,\nwhich I actually put in practice when the second course of bottles was\ncalled for. The wine being strong and heady, I was already a good deal\ndiscomposed by the dispatch we had made. Freeman's eyes began to reel,\nand Bruin himself was elevated into a song, which he uttered with\ngreat vociferation. When I therefore saw the second round brought in, I\nassumed a gay air, entertained him with a French catch on the subject of\ndrinking, which, though he did rot understand it, delighted him highly;\nand, telling him your choice spirits at Paris never troubled themselves\nwith glasses, asked if he had not a bowl or cup in the house that would\ncontain a whole quart of wine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds niggers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a\nsilver candle cup that holds just the quantity, for all the world; fetch\nit hither, Numps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The vessel being produced, I bade him decant his\nbottle into it, which he having done, I nodded in a very deliberate\nmanner, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPledge you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He stared at me for some time, and\ncrying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! all at one pull, Measter Randan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one\npull, Sir, you are no milk-sop--we shall do you justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cShall you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, shaking me by the hand; \u00e2\u0080\u009codds then, I'll see it out, an't\nwere a mile to the bottom: here's to our better acquaintance, measter\nRandan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he applied it to his lips, and emptied it in a\nbreath. I knew the effect of it would be almost instantaneous; therefore\ntaking the cup, began to discharge my bottle into it, telling him he\nwas now qualified to drink with the Cham of Tartary. I had no sooner\npronounced these words than he took umbrage at them, and after several\nattempts to spit, made shift to stutter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA f--t for your Chams of\nT--Tartary! I am a f--f--freeborn Englishman, worth th--three thousand\na-year, and v--value no man, d--me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, dropping his jaw, and fixing\nhis eyes, he hiccuped aloud, and fell upon the floor as mute as n\nflounder. Mr. Freeman, heartily glad at his defeat, assisted me in\ncarrying him to bed, where we left him to the care of his servants, and\nwent home to our respective habitations, congratulating each other on\nour good fortune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nMiss Williams informs me of Narcissa's Approbation of my Flame--I\nappease the Squire--write to my Mistress--am blessed with an Answer--beg\nLeave of her Brother to dance with her at a Ball--obtain his Consent\nand hers--enjoy a private Conversation with her--am perplexed with\nReflections--have the Honour of appearing her Partner at a Ball--we\nare complimented by a certain Nobleman--he discovers some Symptoms of\na Passion for Narcissa--I am stung with Jealousy--Narcissa, alarmed,\nretires--I observe Melinda in the company--the Squire is captivated by\nher Beauty\n\nI was met next morning at the usual place by Miss Williams, who gave\nme joy of the progress I had made in the affection of her mistress, and\nblessed me with an account of that dear creature's conversation with\nher, after she had retired the night before from our company. I could\nscarce believe her information, when she recounted her expressions in my\nfavour, so much more warm and passionate were they than my most sanguine\nhopes had presaged; and was particularly pleased to hear that she\napproved of my behaviour to her brother after she withdrew. Transported\nat the news of my happiness, I presented my ring to the messenger as\na testimony of my gratitude and satisfaction; but she was above\nsuch mercenary considerations, and refused my compliment with some\nresentment, saying, she was not a little mortified to see my opinion\nof her so low and contemptible. I did myself a piece of justice by\nexplaining my behaviour on this head, and to convince her of my esteem,\npromised to be ruled by her directions in the prosecution of the\nwhole affair, which I had so much at heart, that the repose of my life\ndepended upon the consequence.\n\nAs I fervently wished for another interview, where I might pour out the\neffusion of my love without danger of being interrupted, and perhaps\nreep some endearing return from the queen of my desires, I implored\nher advice and assistance in promoting this event: but she gave me to\nunderstand, that Narcissa would make no precipitate compliances of this\nkind, and I would do well to cultivate her brother's acquaintance, in\nthe course of which I should not want opportunities of removing that\nreserve which my mistress thought herself obliged to maintain during the\ninfancy of our correspondence. In the meantime she promised to tell her\nlady that I had endeavoured by presents and persuasions, to prevail upon\nher (Miss Williams) to deliver a letter from me, which she had refused\nto charge herself with, until she should know Narcissa's sentiments of\nthe matter; and said, by these means she did not doubt of being able\nto open a literary communication between us, which could not fail of\nintroducing more intimate connections.\n\nI approved of her counsel, and, our appointment being renewed for the\nnext day, left her with an intent of falling upon some method of being\nreconciled to the squire, who, I supposed, would be offended with the\ntrick we had put upon him. With this view I consulted Freeman, who, from\nhis knowledge of the foxhunter's disposition, assured me there was no\nother method of pacifying him, than that of sacrificing ourselves for\none night to an equal match with him in drinking. This expedient I found\nmyself necessitated to comply with for the interest of my passion, and\ntherefore determined to commit the debauch at my own lodgings, that I\nmight run no risk of being discovered by Narcissa, in a state of brutal\ndegeneracy. Mr. Freeman, who was to be of the party, went, at my desire,\nto the squire, in order to engage him, while I took care to furnish\nmyself for his reception. My invitation was accepted, my guests honoured\nme with their company in the evening, when Bruin gave me to understand\nthat he had drunk many tons of wine in his life, but was never served\nsuch a trick as I had played upon him the night before. I promised to\natone for my trespass, and, having ordered to every man his bottle,\nbegan the contest with a bumper to the health of Narcissa. The toasts\ncirculated with great devotion, the liquor began to operate, our mirth\ngrew noisy, and, as Freeman said, I had the advantage of drinking small\nFrench claret, the savage was effectually tamed before our senses were\nin the least affected, and carried home in an apoplexy of drunkenness.\n\nI was next morning, as usual, favoured with a visit from my kind and\npunctual confidante, who, telling me she was permitted to receive my\nletters for her mistress, I took up the pen immediately, and, following\nthe first dictates of my passion, wrote as follows:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Madam,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it possible for the powers of utterance to reveal the soft\nemotions of my soul, the fond anxiety, the glowing hopes, the chilling\nflame, that rule my breast by turns, I should need no other witness than\nthis paper, to evince the purity and ardour of that flame your charms\nhave kindled in my heart, But alas! expression wrongs my love! I am\ninspired with conceptions that no language can convey! Your beauty fills\nme with wonder, your understanding with ravishment, and your goodness\nwith adoration! I am transported with desire, distracted with doubts,\nand tortured with impatience. Suffer me then, lovely arbitress of my\nfate, to approach you in person, to breathe in soft murmurs my passion\nto your ear, to offer the sacrifice of a heart overflowing with the\nmost genuine and disinterested love, to gaze with ecstacy on the divine\nobject of my wishes, to hear the music of her enchanting tongue, and\nto rejoice in her smiles of approbation, which will banish the most\nintolerable suspense from the bosom of\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour enraptured, R-- R--.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving finished this effusion, I committed it to the care of my faithful\nfriend, with an injunction to second my entreaty with all her eloquence\nand influence, and in the meantime went to dress, with an intention of\nvisiting Mrs. Snapper and Miss, whom I had utterly neglected, and indeed\nalmost forgotten, since my dear Narcissa had resumed the empire of my\nsoul. The old gentlewoman received me very kindly, and Miss affected a\nfrankness and gaiety which, however, I could easily perceive was forced\nand dissembled: among other things, she pretended to joke me upon my\npassion for Narcissa, which she averred was no secret, and asked if\nI intended to dance with her at the next assembly. I was a good deal\nconcerned to find myself become the town talk on this subject, lest the\nsquire, having notice of my inclinations, should disapprove of them,\nand, by breaking off all correspondence with me, deprive me of the\nopportunities I now enjoyed. But I resolved to use the interest I\nhad with him, while it lasted; and that very night, meeting him\noccasionally, asked his permission to solicit her company at the ball,\nwhich he very readily granted, to my inexpressible satisfaction.\n\nHaving been kept awake the greatest part of the night by a thousand\ndelightful reveries that took possession of my fancy, I got up by\ntimes, and, flying to the place of rendezvous, had in a little time\nthe pleasure of seeing Miss Williams approach with a smile on her\ncountenance, which I interpreted into a good omen. Neither was I\nmistaken in my presage. She presented me with a letter from the idol\nof my soul, which, after having kissed it devoutly, I opened with the\nutmost eagerness, and was blessed with her approbation in these terms:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo say I look upon you with indifference would be a piece of\ndissimulation which I think no decorum requires, and no custom can\njustify. As my heart never felt an impression that my tongue was ashamed\nto declare, I will not scruple to own myself pleased with your passion;\nconfident of your integrity, and so well convinced of my own discretion,\nthat I should not hesitate in granting you the interview you desire,\nwere I not overawed by the prying curiosity of a malicious world, the\ncensure of which might be fatally prejudicial to the reputation of\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Narcissa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo anchorite in the ecstacy of devotion ever adored a relic with more\nfervour than that with which I kissed this inimitable proof of my\ncharmer's candour, generosity, and affection! I read it over a hundred\ntimes, was ravished with her confession in the beginning; but the\nsubscription of Your Narcissa yielded me such delight as I had never\nfelt before! My happiness was still increased by Miss Williams, who\nblessed me with a repetition of her lady's tender expressions in my\nfavour, when she received and read my letter. In short, I had all the\nreason in the world to believe that this gentle creature's bosom was\npossessed by a passion for me, as warm, though perhaps not so impetuous\nas mine for her.\n\nI informed my friend of the squire's consent to my dancing with Narcissa\nat the ball and desired her to tell her mistress, that I would do myself\nthe honour of visiting her in the afternoon, in consequence of his\npermission, when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her brother had\nbeen complaisant in that particular. Miss Williams expressed a good\ndeal of joy at hearing I was so much in favour with the foxhunter,\nand ventured to assure me, that my visit would be very agreeable to my\nmistress, the rather because Bruin was engaged to dine abroad. This was\na circumstance which, I scarce need say, pleased me. I went immediately\nto the Long Room, where I found him, and, affecting to know nothing of\nhis engagement, told him, I would do myself the pleasure to wait upon\nhim in the afternoon, and to present his sister with a ticket for the\nball. He shook me by the hand, according to custom, and, giving me to\nunderstand that he was to dine abroad, desired me to go and drink tea\nwith Narcissa notwithstanding, and promised to prepare her for my visit\nin the meantime.\n\nEverything succeeding thus to my wish, I waited with incredible\nimpatience for the time, which no sooner arrived than I hastened to\nthe scene, which my fancy had preoccupied long before. I was introduced\naccordingly to the dear enchantress, whom I found accompanied by Miss\nWilliams, who, on pretence of ordering tea, retired at my approach. This\nfavourable accident, which alarmed my whole soul, disordered her also. I\nfound myself actuated by an irresistible impulse; I advanced to her with\neagerness and awe; and, profiting by the confusion that prevailed over\nher, clasped the fair angel in my arms, and imprinted a glowing kiss\nupon her lips, more soft and fragrant than the dewy rosebud just\nbursting from the stem! Her face was in an instant covered with blushes,\nher eyes sparkled with resentment; I threw myself at her feet, and\nimplored her pardon. Her love became advocate in my cause; her look\nsoftened into forgiveness; she raised me up, and chid me with so much\nsweetness of displeasure that I could have been tempted to repeat\nthe offence, had not the coming in of the servant with the tea-board\nprevented my presumption. While we were subject to be interrupted\nor overheard, we conversed about the approaching ball, at which she\npromised to grace me as a partner, but, when the equipage was removed,\nand we were left alone, I resumed the more interesting theme, and\nexpressed myself with such transport and agitation, that my mistress,\nfearing I should commit some extravagance, rang the bell for her maid,\nwhom she detained in the room, as a check upon my vivacity. I was\nnot sorry for this precaution, because I could unbosom myself without\nreserve before Miss Williams, who was the confidante of us both. I\ntherefore gave a loose to the inspirations of my passion, which operated\nso successfully upon the tender affections of Narcissa, that she laid\naside the constraint she had hitherto worn, and blessed me with the most\nmelting declaration of her mutual flame! It was impossible for me to\nforbear taking the advantage of this endearing condescension. She now\ngently yielded to my embraces; while I, encircling all that I held dear\nwithin my arms, tasted in advance the joys of that paradise I hoped in a\nlittle time wholly to possess! We spent the afternoon in all the ecstacy\nof hope that the most fervent love exchanged by mutual vows could\ninspire; and Miss Williams was so much affected with our chaste\ncaresses, which recalled the sad remembrance of what she was, that her\neyes were filled with tears.\n\nThe evening being pretty far advanced, I forced myself from the dear\nobject of my flame, who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting,\nand, repairing to my lodgings, communicated to my friend Strap every\ncircumstance of my happiness, which filled him with so much pleasure,\nthat it ran over at his eyes; and he prayed heartily, that no envious\ndevil might, as formerly, dash the cup of blessing from my lip. When\nI reflected on what had happened, and especially on the unreserved\nprotestations of Narcissa's love, I could not help being amazed at\nher omitting to inquire into the particular circumstances of life and\nfortune of one whom she had favoured with her affection, and I began to\nbe a little anxious about the situation of her finances; well knowing\nthat I should do an irreparable injury to the person my soul held most\ndear, if I should espouse her without being able to support her in the\nrank which was certainly her due. I had heard, indeed, while I served\nher aunt, that her father had left her a considerable sum; and\nthat everybody believed she would inherit the greatest part of her\nkinswoman's dowry, but I did not know how far she might be restricted by\nthe old gentleman's will in the enjoyment of what he left her: and I was\ntoo well informed of the virtuoso's late conduct, to think my mistress\ncould have any expectation from that quarter. I confided, however, in\nthe good sense and policy of my charmer, who, I was sure, would not\nconsent to unite her fate with mine, before she had fully considered and\nprovided for the consequence.\n\nThe ball night being arrived, I dressed myself in a suit I had reserved\nfor some grand occasion; and, having drunk tea with Narcissa and her\nbrother, conducted my angel to the scene, where she, in a moment,\neclipsed all her female competitors for beauty, and attracted the\nadmiration of the whole assembly. My heart dilated with pride on this\noccasion, and my triumph rejected all bounds, when, after we had danced\ntogether, a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure, and influence\nin the beau monde, came up, and in the hearing of all present, honoured\nus with a very particular compliment upon our accomplishments and\nappearance; but this transport was soon checked, when I perceived his\nlordship attach himself with great assiduity to my mistress, and say\nsome warm things, which, I thought, savoured too much of passion. It\nwas then I began to feel the pangs of jealousy; I dreaded the power and\naddress of my rival; I sickened at his discourse; when she opened her\nlips to answer, my heart died within me; when she smiled, I felt the\npains of the damned! I was enraged at his presumption: I cursed her\ncomplaisance: at length he quitted her, and went to the other side of\nthe room. Narcissa, suspecting nothing of the rage that inflamed me, put\nsome questions to me as soon as he was gone, to which I made no reply,\nbut assumed a grim look, which too well denoted the agitation of my\nbreast, and surprised her not a little. She no sooner observed my\nemotion than she changed colour, and asked what ailed me? but before I\ncould make answer, her brother, pulling me by the sleeve, bade me take\nnotice of a lady who sat fronting us, whom I immediately, to my vast\nastonishment, distinguished to be Melinda, accompanied by her mother,\nand an elderly gentleman, whom I did not know. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWounds! Mr. Randan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried the squire, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis she not a delicate piece of stuff? 'Sdeath! I have\na good mind--if I thought she was a single person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNotwithstanding the perplexity I was in, I had reflection enough to\nforesee that my passion might suffer greatly by the presence of this\nlady, who, in all probability, would revenge herself upon me, for having\nformerly disgraced her, by spreading reports to my prejudice. I was\ntherefore alarmed at these symptoms of the Squire's admiration; and for\nsome time did not know what reply to make, when he asked my opinion of\nher beauty; at length I came to a determination, and told him that her\nname was Melinda, that she had a fortune of ten thousand pounds, and was\nsaid to be under promise of marriage to a certain lord, who deferred his\nnuptials a few mouths until he should be of age. I thought this piece\nof intelligence, which I had myself invented, would have hindered him\neffectually from entertaining any further thoughts of her; but I was\negregiously mistaken. The foxhunter had too much self-sufficiency to\ndespair of success against any competitor on earth. He therefore made\nlight of her engagement, saying, with a smile of self-approbation,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMayhap she will change her mind; what signifies his being a lord? I\nthink myself as good a man as e'er a lord in Christendom, and I'll see\nif a commoner worth three thousand a year won't serve her turn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This\ndetermination startled me not a little; I knew he would soon discover\nthe contrary of what I advanced; and as I believed he would find her ear\nopen to his addresses, did not doubt of meeting with every obstacle in\nmy amour that her malice could invent, and her influence execute. This\nreflection increased my chagrin--my vexation was evident. Narcissa\ninsisted on going home immediately: and, as I led her to the door,\nher noble admirer, with a look full of languishment, directed to her\na profound bow, which stung me to the soul. Before she went into the\nchair, she asked, with an appearance of concern, what was the\nmatter with me? and I could pronounce no more than \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy heaven, I am\ndistracted!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\nTortured with Jealousy, I go Home, and abuse Strap--receive a Message\nfrom Narcissa, in Consequence of which I hasten to her Apartment, where\nher endearing Assurances banish all my Doubts and Apprehensions--in my\nRetreat discover Somebody in the Dark, whom, suspecting to be a Spy, I\nresolve to kill, but, to my great Surprise, am convinced of his being\nno other than Strap--Melinda slanders me--I become acquainted with\nLord Quiverwit, who endeavours to sound me with regard to Narcissa--the\nSquire is introduced to his Lordship, and grows cold towards me--I learn\nfrom my Confidante, that this Nobleman professes honourable Love to my\nMistress, who continues faithful to me, notwithstanding the scandalous\nReports she had heard to my Prejudice--I am mortified with an Assurance\nthat her whole Fortune depends upon the Pleasure of her Brother--Mr.\nFreeman condoles me on the Decline of my Character, which I vindicate so\nmuch to his satisfaction, that he undertakes to combat Fame on my behalf\n\nHaving uttered this exclamation, at which she sighed, I went home in the\ncondition of a frantic Bedlamite: and, finding the fire in my apartment\nalmost extinguished, vented my fury upon poor Strap, whose ear I pinched\nwith such violence, that he roared hideously with pain; and, when\nI quitted my hold, looked so foolishly aghast, that no unconcerned\nspectator could have seen him without being seized with an immoderate\nfit of laughter. It is true, I was soon sensible of the injury I had\ndone, and asked pardon for the outrage I had committed; upon which my\nfaithful valet, shaking his head, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI forgive you, and may\nGod forgive you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he could not help shedding some tears at my\nunkindness. I felt unspeakable remorse for what I had done, cursed my\nown ingratitude, and considered his tears as a reproach that my soul, in\nits present disturbance, could not bear. It set all my passions into a\nferment: I swore horrible oaths without meaning or application. I foamed\nat the mouth, kicked the chairs about the room, and played abundance of\nmad pranks that frightened my friend almost out of his senses. At length\nmy transport subsided, I became melancholy, and wept insensibly.\n\nDuring this state of dejection, I was surprised with the appearance of\nMiss Williams, whom Strap, blubbering all the while, had conducted into\nthe chamber without giving me previous notice of her approach. She was\nextremely affected with my condition, which she had learned from him,\nbegged me to moderate my passion, suspend my conjectures, and follow her\nto Narcissa, who desired to see me forthwith. That dear name operated\nupon me like a charm! I started up, and, without opening my lips, was\nconducted into her apartment through the garden, which we entered by a\nprivate door. I found the adorable creature in tears; I was melted at\nthe sight--we continued silent for some time--my heart was too full to\nspeak--her snowy bosom heaved with fond resentment; at last she sobbing\ncried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have I done to disoblige you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d My heart was pierced with\nthe tender question. I drew near with the utmost reverence of affection.\nI fell upon my knees before her, and, kissing her hand, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\nthou art all goodness and perfection! I am undone by want of merit; I am\nunworthy to possess thy charms, which heaven bath destined for the arms\nof some more favourite being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She guessed the cause of my disquiet,\nupbraided me gently for my suspicion, and gave me such flattering\nassurances of her eternal fidelity, that all my doubts and fears forsook\nme, and peace and satisfaction reigned within my breast.\n\nAt midnight I left the fair nymph to her repose, and, being let out by\nMiss Williams at the garden gate by which I entered, began to explore my\nway homeward in the dark, when I heard at my back a noise like that of\na baboon when he mews and chatters. I turned instantly, and, perceiving\nsomething black, concluded I was discovered by some spy, employed\nto watch for that purpose; aroused at this conjecture, by which the\nreputation of the virtuous Narcissa appeared in jeopardy, I drew my\nsword, and would have sacrificed him to her fame, had not the voice\nof Strap restrained my arm, it was with great difficulty he could\npronounce, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--d--d-do! mum--um--um--murder me if you please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such an\neffect had the cold upon his jaws, that his teeth rattled like a pair\nof castanets. Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his\nconsternation, and asked what brought him thither? Upon which he gave me\nto understand, that his concern for me had induced him to follow me\nto that place, where the same reason had detained him till now, and he\nfrankly owned, that, in spite of the esteem he had for Miss Williams he\nbegan to be very uneasy about me, considering the disposition in which\nI went abroad; and, if I had stayed much longer, would certainly have\nalarmed the neighbourhood in my behalf. The knowledge of this\nhis intention confounded me. I represented to him the mischievous\nconsequences that would have attended such a rash action, and,\ncautioning him severely against any such design for the future,\nconcluded my admonition with an assurance, that, in case he should ever\nact so madly, I would, without hesitation, put him to death. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave a\nlittle patience!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, in a lamentable tone; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour displeasure will\ndo the business, without your committing murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was touched with\nthis reproach; and, as soon as we got home, made it my business to\nappease him, by explaining the cause of that transport during which I\nhad used him so unworthily.\n\nNext day when I went into the Long Room, I observed several whispers\ncirculate all of a sudden, and did not doubt that Melinda had been busy\nwith my character; but I consoled myself with the love of Narcissa, upon\nwhich I rested with the most perfect confidence; and going up to the\nrowly-powly table, won a few pieces from my suspected rival, who, with\nan easy politeness, entered into conversation with me, and, desiring\nmy company to the coffee-house, treated me with tea and chocolate. I\nremembered Strutwell, and guarded against his insinuating behaviour;\nnor was my suspicion wrong placed; he artfully turned the discourse upon\nNarcissa, and endeavoured by hinting at an intrigue he pretended to be\nengaged in elsewhere, to learn what connection there was between her\nand me. But all his finesse was ineffectual, I was convinced of his\ndissimulation, and gave such general answers to his inquiries, that he\nwas forced to drop the subject, and talk of something else.\n\nWhile we conversed in this manner, the savage came in with another\ngentleman, who introduced him to his lordship, and he was received with\nsuch peculiar marks of distinction, that I was persuaded the courtier\nintended to use him in some shape or other; and from thence I drew an\nunlucky omen. But I had more cause to be dismayed the following day,\nwhen I saw the squire in company with Melinda and her mother, who\nhonoured me with several disdainful glances; and when I afterwards threw\nmyself in his way, instead of the cordial shake of the hand, he returned\nmy salute with a cold repetition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cServant, servant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he\npronounced with such indifference or rather contempt, that if he had not\nbeen Narcissa's brother, I should have affronted him in public.\n\nThese occurrences disturbed me not a little; I foresaw the brooding\nstorm, and armed myself with resolution for the occasion; but Narcissa,\nbeing at stake, I was far from being resigned. I could have renounced\nevery other comfort of life with some degree of fortitude, but the\nprospect of losing her disabled all my philosophy, and tortured my soul\ninto madness.\n\nMiss Williams found me, next morning, full of anxious tumult, which\ndid not abate when she told me that my Lord Quiverwit, having professed\nhonourable intentions, had been introduced to my lovely mistress by her\nbrother, who had, at the same time, from the information of Melinda,\nspoken of me as an Irish fortune-hunter, without either birth or estate;\nwho supported myself in the appearance of a gentleman by sharping and\nother infamous practices; and who was of such an obscure origin, that I\ndid not even know my own extraction. Though I expected all this malice,\nI could not hear it with temper, especially as truth was so blended\nwith falsehood in the assertion, that it would be almost impossible to\nseparate the one from the other in my vindication. But I said nothing on\nthis head, being impatient to know how Narcissa had been affected\nwith the discovery. That generous creature, far from believing these\nimprecations, was no sooner withdrawn with her confidante, than she\ninveighed with great warmth against the malevolence of the world,\nto which only she ascribed the whole of what had been said to my\ndisadvantage, and, calling every circumstance of my behaviour to her\ninto review before her, found everything so polite, honourable, and\ndisinterested, that she could not harbour the least doubt of my being\nthe gentleman I assumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpurposely forborne\nto ask the particulars of his life, lest the recapitulation of some\nmisfortunes, which he has undergone, should give him pain; and, as to\nthe article of his fortune, I own myself equally afraid of inquiring\ninto it, and of discovering the state of my own, lest we should find\nourselves both unhappy in the explanation; for, alas! my provision\nis conditional, and depends entirely on my marrying with my brother's\nconsent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was thunderstruck with this intelligence, the light forsook my\neyes, the colour vanished from my cheeks, and I remained in a state\nof universal trepidation! My female friend, perceiving my disorder,\nencouraged me with assurances of Narcissa's constancy, and the hope of\nsome accident favourable to our love; and, as a further consolation,\ngave me to understand, that she had acquainted my mistress with the\noutlines of my life: and that, although she was no stranger to the\npresent low state of my finances, her love and esteem were rather\nincreased than diminished by the knowledge of my circumstances. I was\ngreatly comforted by this assurance, which saved me a world of confusion\nand anxiety; for I must have imparted my situation one day to Narcissa,\nand this task I could not have performed without shame and disorder.\n\nAs I did not doubt that by this time the scandalous aspersions of\nMelinda were diffused all over the town, I resolved to collect my whole\nstrength of assurance, to browbeat the efforts of her malice, and to\npublish her adventure with the frenchified barber by way of reprisal. In\nthe meantime, having promised to be at the garden-gate about midnight,\nMiss Williams took her leave, bidding me repose myself entirely on\nthe affection of my dear Narcissa, which was as perfect as inviolable.\nBefore I went abroad, I was visited by Freeman, who came on purpose\nto inform me of the infamous stories that were raised at my expense. I\nheard them with great temper, and in my turn disclosed everything that\nhad happened between Melinda and me; and among other circumstances\nentertained him with the story of the barber, letting him know what\nshare his friend Banter had in that affair. He was convinced of the\ninjury my reputation had suffered; and, no longer doubting the fountain\nfrom whence this deluge of slander had flowed upon me, undertook to\nundeceive the town in my behalf, and roll the stream back upon its\nsource; but in the meantime, cautioned me from appearing in public,\nwhile the prepossession was so strong against me, lest I should meet\nwith some affront that might have bad consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\nI receive an extraordinary Message at the Door of the Long Room, which,\nhowever, enter, and affront the Squire, who threatens to take the Law\nof me--Rebuke Melinda for her Malice--she weeps with Vexation--Lord\nQuiverwit is severe upon me--I retort his Sarcasm--am received with\nthe utmost Tenderness by Narcissa, who desires to hear the Story of\nmy Life--we vow eternal Constancy to other--I retire--am waked by a\nMessenger, who brings a Challenge from Quiverwit, whom I meet, engage,\nand vanquish\n\nI thanked him for his advice, which, however, my pride and resentment\nwould not permit me to follow; for he no sooner left me, in order to\ndo justice to my character among his friends and acquaintance, than I\nsallied out, and went directly to the Long Room. I was met at the door\nby a servant, who presented a billet to me without a subscription,\nimporting that my presence was disagreeable to the company, and desiring\nI would take the hint without further disturbance, and bestow myself\nelsewhere for the future. This peremptory message filled me with\nindignation. I followed the fellow who delivered it, and, seizing him\nby the collar in presence of all the company, threatened to put him\ninstantly to death, if he did not discover the scoundrel who had charged\nhim with such an impudent commission, that I might punish him as he\ndeserved. The messenger, affrighted at my menaces and furious looks,\nfell upon his knees, and told me, that the gentleman who ordered him to\ndeliver the letter was no other than Narcissa's brother, who, at that\ntime, stood at the other end of the room, talking to Melinda. I went up\nto him immediately, and in the hearing of his inamorata, accosted him\nin these words; \u00e2\u0080\u009cLookee, squire, were it not for one consideration that\nprotects you from my resentment, I would cane you where you stand, for\nhaving had the presumption to send me this scurrilous intimation;\u00e2\u0080\u009d which\nI tore to pieces and threw in his face: at the same time darting an\nangry regard at his mistress, I told her, I was sorry she had put it out\nof my power to compliment her upon her invention, but at the expense of\nher good nature and veracity. Her admirer, whose courage never rose,\nbut in proportion to the wine he had swallowed, instead of resenting my\naddress in what is called an honourable way, threatened to prosecute me\nfor an assault, and took witnesses accordingly: while she, piqued at\nhis pusillanimous behaviour, and enraged at the sarcasm I had uttered\nagainst her, endeavoured to make her quarrel a public cause, and wept\naloud with spite and vexation.\n\nThe tears of a lady could not fail of attracting the notice and concern\nof the spectators to whom she complained of my rudeness with great\nbitterness, saying, if she were a man, I durst not use her so. The\ngreatest part of the gentlemen, already prejudiced against me, were\noffended at the liberty I had taken, as appeared from their looks;\nthough none of them signified their disgust any other way except my Lord\nQuiverwit, who ventured to say, with a sneer, that I was in the right\nto establish my own character, of which he had now no longer any doubt.\nNettled at this severe equivocation, which raised a laugh at my expense,\nI replied with some warmth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am proud of having in that particular got\nthe start of your lordship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He made no answer to my repartee, but\nwith a contemptuous smile walked off, leaving me in a very disagreeable\nsituation. In vain did I make up to several people of my acquaintance,\nwhose conversation, I hoped, would banish my confusion; everybody\nshunned me like a person infected, and I should not have been able\nto bear my disgrace, had not the idea of the ever faithful and fond\nNarcissa come to my relief. I quitted the scene of my mortification,\nand, sauntering about the town, happened to wake from my contemplation,\nwhen I found myself just opposite to a toy-shop, which I entered, and\npurchased a ring set with a ruby in the form of a heart, surrounded by\ndiamond sparks, for which I paid ten guineas, intending it for a present\nto the charmer of my soul.\n\nI was introduced, at the hour appointed, to this divine creature, who,\nnotwithstanding what she had heard to my disadvantage, received me with\nthe utmost confidence and tenderness; and, having been informed of the\ngeneral sketches of my life by Miss Williams, expressed a desire,\nof knowing the particular circumstances, which I related with great\ncandour, omitting, however, some things which I concluded altogether\nimproper for her ear, and which the reader's reflection will easily\nsuggest. As my story was little else than a recital of misfortunes, the\ntear of sympathy ceased not to trickle from her enchanting eyes during\nthe whole of the narration, which, when I had finished, she recompensed\nme for my trouble with the most endearing protestations of eternal love.\nShe bewailed her restricted condition, as it was the means of retarding\nmy happiness; told me that Lord Quiverwit, by her brother's permission,\nhad been to drink tea with her that very afternoon, and actually\nproposed marriage; and, seeing me extremely affected with this piece of\ninformation, offered to give me a convincing proof of her affection, by\nespousing me in private, and leaving the rest to fate. I was penetrated\nwith this instance of her regard, but, that I might not be outdone in\ngenerosity, resisted the bewitching temptation in consideration of her\nhonour and interest; at the same time I presented my ring as a pledge\nof my inviolable attachment, and, on my knees, implored Heaven to shower\nits curses on my head, if ever my heart should entertain one thought\nunworthy of the passion I then avowed. She received my token, gave me in\nreturn her picture in miniature, exquisitely drawn and set in gold; and,\nin the same posture, called Heaven to witness and to judge her flame.\nOur vows being thus reciprocally breathed, a confidence of hope ensued,\nand our mutual fondness becoming as intimate as innocence would allow,\nI grew insensible of the progress of time, and it was morning before I\ncould tear myself from this darling of my soul! My good angel foresaw\nwhat would happen, and permitted me to indulge myself on this occasion,\nin consideration of the fatal absence I was doomed to suffer.\n\nI went to bed immediately on my return to my lodging, and, having slept\nabout two hours, was waked by Strap, who in great confusion told me\nthere was a footman below with a letter, which he would deliver to\nnobody but myself. Alarmed at this piece of news, I desired my friend to\nshow him into my chamber, and received the following letter, which, he\nsaid, required an immediate answer:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen any man injures my honour, let the difference of rank between us\nbe ever so great, I am contented to wave the privilege of my quality,\nand to seek reparation from him on equal terms. The insolence of your\nreply to me yesterday, in the Long Room, I might have overlooked, had\nnot your presumptive emulation in a much more interesting affair, and\nwhich I made this morning, concurred in persuading me to chastise your\naudacity with my sword. If you therefore have spirit enough to support\nthe character you assume, you will not fail to follow the bearer\nimmediately to a convenient place, where you shall be met by\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuiverwit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhether I was enervated by the love and favour of Narcissa, or awed by\nthe superior station of my antagonist, I know not, but I never had less\ninclination to fight than at this time. However, finding there was a\nnecessity for vindicating the reputation of my mistress, as well as for\nasserting my own honour, I forthwith rose, and, dressing in a hurry,\nput on my sword, bade Strap attend me, and set out with my conductor,\ncursing my bad fortune all the way, for having been observed in my\nreturn from my angel; for so I interpreted his lordship's discovery.\nWhen I came within sight of my rival, his lacquey told me he had orders\nto stop; upon which I commanded Strap to halt also, while I walked\nforward; resolving, if possible, to come to an explanation with my\nchallenger, before we should come to battle. Nor was an opportunity\nwanting; for I no sooner approached than he asked, with a stern\ncountenance, what business I had in Mr. Topehall's garden so early in\nthe morning? \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to answer a question\nput to me with such magisterial haughtiness. If your lordship will\nplease to expostulate calmly, you will have no cause to repent of your\ncondescension; otherwise I am not to be intimated into any confession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no room for denial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw you come out with my\nown eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid any other see me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI neither know nor care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want no other evidence than that of my own senses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pleased\nto hear that the suspicion was confined to him alone, I endeavoured to\nappease his jealousy, by owning an intrigue with the waiting maid: but\nhe had too much discernment to be so easily imposed upon, and told me\nthere was only one way to convince him of the truth of what I alleged,\nwhich was no other than renouncing all claim to Narcissa upon oath,\nand promising, upon honour, never to speak to her for the future.\nExasperated at this proposal, I unsheathed my sword, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeavens!\nwhat title have you, or any man on earth, to impose such terms on me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He did the same, and making towards me with a contracted brow, said\nI was a villain, and had dishonoured Narcissa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's a villain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nreplied, in a transport of fury, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho brands me with that imputation!\nShe is a thousand times more chaste than the mother that bore you; and I\nwill assert her honour with my heart's blood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, I rushed upon\nhim with more eagerness than address, and, endeavouring to get within\nhis point, received a wound in my neck, which redoubled my rage. He\nexcelled me in temper as well as in skill, by which means he parried my\nthrusts with great calmness, until I had almost exhausted my spirits;\nand, when he perceived me beginning to flag, attacked me fiercely in\nhis turn. Finding himself, however, better opposed than he expected, he\nresolved to follow his lounge, and close with me; accordingly, his sword\nentered my waistcoat, on the side of the breast bone, and, running up\nbetween my shirt and skin, appeared over my left shoulder. I imagined\nthat his weapon had perforated my lungs, and of consequence that the\nwound was mortal; therefore, determined not to die unrevenged, I seized\nhis shell, which was close to my breast, before he could disentangle his\npoint, and, keeping it fast with my left hand, shortened my own sword\nwith my right, intending to run him through the heart; but he received\nthe thrust in the left arm, which penetrated up to the shoulder blade.\nDisappointed at this expectation, and afraid still that death would\nfrustrate my revenge, I grappled with him, and, being much the stronger,\nthrew him upon the ground, where I wrested his sword out of his hand,\nand, so great was my confusion, that instead of turning the point upon\nhim, struck out three of his foreteeth with the hilt. In the meantime,\nour servants, seeing us fall, ran up to separate and assist us; but\nbefore their approach I was upon my feet, and had discovered that my\nsupposed mortal wound was only a slight scratch. The knowledge of my\nown safety disarmed me of a good deal of my resentment, and I began\nto inquire with some concern into the situation of my antagonist, who\nremained on the ground bleeding plentifully at his mouth and arm. I\nhelped his footman to raise him, and, having bound up his wound with\nmy handkerchief, assured it was not dangerous; I likewise restored his\nsword, and offered to support him to his house. He thanked me with an\nair of sullen dignity: and whispering that I should hear from him soon,\nwent away, leaning on his servant's shoulder.\n\nI was surprised at this promise, which I construed into a threat, and\nresolved, if ever he should call me out again, to use whatever advantage\nfortune might give me over him in another manner. In the meantime I had\nleisure to take notice of Strap, who seemed quite stupified with horror:\nI comforted him with an assurance, that I had received no damage, and\nexplained the nature of this affair as we walked homeward. By the time\nI had got into my apartment, I found the wound in my neck stiff and\nuneasy, and a good deal of clotted blood ran down upon my shirt; upon\nwhich I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and unbuttoned my collar, that\nI might dress it with more ease. My friend no sooner perceived my\nshirt quite dyed with blood, than, imagining I had got at least twenty\nthousand wounds, he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Jesus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and fell flat on the floor. I\nstopped the bleeding with a little dry lint, and, applying a plaster\nover it, cleaned myself from the gore, shifted, and dressed, while\nhe lay senseless at my feet, so that when he recovered, and saw me\nperfectly well, he could scarce believe his own eyes. Now that the\ndanger was passed, I was very well pleased with what had happened,\nhoping that it would soon become known, and consequently dignify my\ncharacter not a little in this place. I was also proud of having shown\nmyself, in some shape, worthy of the love of Narcissa, who, I was\npersuaded, would not think the worse of me for what I had done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\nI am visited by Freeman, with whom I appear in Public, and am\ncaressed--am sent for by Lord Quiverwit, whose Presence I quit\nflung--Narcissa is carried off by her Brother--I intend to pursue\nhim, and am dissuaded by my Friend--engage in Play, and lose all my\nMoney--set out for London--try my Fortune at the Gaming Table without\nsuccess--receive a letter from Narcissa--bilk my Tailor\n\nWhile I entertained myself with these reflections, the news of the duel,\nbeing communicated by some unknown channel, spread all over the town. I\nwas visited by Freeman, who testified his surprise at finding me; for it\nwas told, that Lord Quiverwit being dead of his wounds, I had absconded,\nin order to avoid the cognizance of the law. I asked, if people guessed\nthe occasion of the quarrel; and, understanding it was attributed to\nhis lordship's resentment of my reply in the Long Room, confirmed that\nconjecture, glad to find Narcissa unsuspected. My friend, after I had\nassured him that my antagonist was in no danger, wished me joy of the\nevent, than which, he said, nothing could happen more opportunely to\nsupport the idea he had given of my character to his friends, among whom\nhe had been very assiduous in my behalf.\n\nOn the strength of this assurance, I went with him to the coffee-house,\nwhere I was saluted by a great many of those very persons who had\nshunned me the preceding day; and I found everybody making merry with\nthe story of Melinda's French gallant. While I remained in this place, I\nreceived a message from Lord Quiverwit, desiring, if I were not engaged,\nto see me at his house.\n\nThither I immediately repaired, and was conducted to an apartment where\nI was received by his lordship in bed. When we were left by ourselves,\nhe thanked me in very polite terms for having used the advantage fortune\nhad given me over him with such moderation, and asked pardon for any\noffence his resentment might have prompted him to commit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would\nwillingly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake you my friend; but, as it is impossible for\nme to divest myself of my passion for Narcissa, I am too well convinced\nof your sentiments, to think we shall ever agree on that subject. I took\nthe liberty, therefore, of sending for you, in order to own candidly,\nthat I cannot help opposing your success with that young lady; though,\nat the same time I promise to regulate my opposition by the dictates of\njustice and honour. This, however, I think proper to advertise you of,\nthat she has no independent fortune; and, if you should even succeed in\nyour addresses, you will have the mortification to see her reduced to\nindigence, unless you have wherewithal to support her--and I am credibly\ninformed of your incapacity that way--nay, I will confess, that, urged\nby this consideration, I have actually sent notice to her brother of the\nprogress I suspect you have made in her affection, and desired him\nto take his precautions accordingly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alarmed and provoked at this\ninformation, I told his lordship, that I did not see how he could\nreconcile that piece of conduct with his profession of open dealing, and\nflung away from him in a passion.\n\nAs I walked homeward, in hope of hearing from my mistress as usual\nby means of Miss Williams, I was surprised with the waving of a\nhandkerchief from the window of a coach-and-six that passed by me at\nfull speed: and upon further observation, I saw a servant on horseback\nriding after it, who, I knew by his livery, belonged to the squire.\nThunderstruck with this discovery, the knowledge of my misfortune rushed\nall at once upon my reflection! I guessed immediately that the signal\nwas made by the dear hand of Narcissa, who, being hurried away in\nconsequence of Lord Quiverwit's message to her brother, had no other\nmethod of relating her distress, and imploring my assistance. Frantic\nwith this conjecture, I ran to my lodgings, snatched my pistols, and\nordered Strap to get post-horses, with such incoherence of speech and\ndisorder, that the poor valet, terrified with the suspicion of another\nduel, instead of providing what I desired, went forthwith to Freeman,\nwho, being informed of my behaviour, came straight to my apartment, and\nconjured me so pathetically to make him acquainted with the cause of my\nuneasiness, that I could not refuse telling him my happiness was fled\nwith Narcissa, and that I must retrieve her or perish. He represented\nthe madness of such an undertaking, and endeavoured to divert me from\nit with great strength of friendship and reason. But all his arguments\nwould have been ineffectual, had he not put me in mind of the dependence\nI ought to have on the love of Narcissa, and the attachment of her maid,\nwho could not fail of finding opportunities to advertise me of their\nsituation; and at the same time demonstrated the injury my charmer's\nreputation must suffer from my precipitate retreat. I was convinced and\ncomposed by these considerations: I appeared in public with an air of\ntranquillity, was well received by the best company in town, and,\nmy misfortune taking air, condoled accordingly: while I had the\nsatisfaction of seeing Melinda so universally discountenanced that she\nwas fain to return to London, in order to avoid the scoffs and censure\nof the ladies at Bath. But, though the hope of hearing from the darling\nof my soul supported my spirits a little while, I began to be very\nuneasy, when, at the end of several weeks I found that expectation\ndisappointed. In short, melancholy and despondence took possession of my\nsoul; and, repining at that providence which, by acting the stepmother\ntowards me, kept me from the fruition of my wishes, I determined, in a\nfit of despair, to risk all I had at the gaming table, with a view of\nacquiring a fortune sufficient to render me independent for life; or of\nplunging myself into such a state of misery, as would effectually crush\nevery ambitious hope that now tortured my imagination.\n\nActuated by this fatal resolution, I engaged in play, and, after\nsome turns of fortune found myself, at the end of three days, worth a\nthousand pounds; but it was not my intention to stop there, for which\ncause I kept Strap ignorant of my success, and continued my career until\nI was reduced to five guineas, which I would have hazarded also, had\nI not been ashamed to fall from a bet of two hundred pounds to such a\npetty sum.\n\nHaving thus executed my scheme, I went home, amazed to find myself so\nmuch at ease, and informed my friend Strap of my mischance with such\ncalmness, that he, imagining I joked, affected to receive the tidings\nwith great equanimity. But both he and I found ourselves mistaken very\nsoon. I had misinterpreted my own stupidity into deliberate resignation,\nand he had reason to believe me in earnest when he saw me next morning\nagitated with the most violent despair, which he endeavoured to\nalleviate with all the consolation in his power.\n\nIn one of my lucid intervals, however, I charged him to take a place in\nthe stage coach for London; and, in the meantime, paid my debts in Bath,\nwhich amounted to thirty shillings only. Without taking leave of my\nfriends, I embarked, Strap having the good fortune to find a return\nhorse, and arrived in town, without having met with anything remarkable\non the road. While we crossed Bagshot Heath, I was seized with a sort\nof inclination to retrieve my fortune, by laying passengers under\ncontribution in some such place. My thoughts were so circumstanced\nat this time, that I should have digested the crime of robbery, so\nrighteously had I concerted my plan, and ventured my life in the\nexecution, had I not been deterred by reflecting upon the infamy that\nattends detection.\n\nThe apartment I formerly lived in being unengaged, I took possession\nof it, and next day went in quest of Banter, who received me with open\narms, in expectation of having his bond discharged to his liking: but\nwhen he understood what had happened, his countenance changed of a\nsudden, and he told me, with a dryness of displeasure peculiar to\nhimself, that, if he were in my place, he would put it out of fortune's\npower to play him such another trick, and be avenged of his own\nindiscretion at once. When I desired him to explain his meaning, he\npointed to his neck, raised himself on his tiptoes, and was going away\nwithout any further ceremony, when I put him in mind of my indigence,\nand demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFive guineas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried he; \u00e2\u0080\u009czounds! had you acted with common prudence, you might have\nhad twenty thousand in your pocket by this time. I depended upon five\nhundred from you, as much as if I had had notes for it in the bank; and\nby all the rules of equity, you are indebted to me for that sum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was\nneither pleased nor convinced by this computation, and insisted on my\nright with such determined obstinacy, that he was fain to alter his ton,\nand appease my clamour by assuring me, that he was not master of five\nshillings. Society in distress generally promotes good understanding\namong people; from being a dun I descended to be a client, and asked\nhis advice about repairing my losses. He counselled me to have recourse\nagain to the gaming table, where I succeeded so well before, and put\nmyself in a condition by selling my watch. I followed his directions,\nand, having accommodated him with a few pieces, went to the place, where\nI lost every shilling.\n\nThen I returned to my lodgings full of desperate resolution, and\nhaving made Strap acquainted with my fate, ordered him to pawn my\nsword immediately, that I might be enabled to make another effort. This\naffectionate creature no sooner understood my purpose, than, seized with\ninsupportable sorrow at the prospect of my misery, he burst into tears,\nand asked what I proposed to do after the small sum he could raise on\nthe sword should be spent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my own account\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am quite\nunconcerned; for, while God spares me health and these ten fingers, I\ncan earn a comfortable subsistence anywhere; but what must become of\nyou, who have less humility to stoop, and more appetites to gratify?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Here I interrupted him, by saying, with a gloomy aspect, I should never\nwant a resource while I had a loaded pistol in possession. Stupified\nwith horror at this dreadful insinuation, he stood mute for some\ntime and then broke out into \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod of his infinite mercy enable you\nto withstand that temptation of the devil! Consider your immortal\nsoul--there's no repentance in the grave! O Lord! that we ever should\nhave come to this! Are we not enjoined to resign ourselves to the will\nof Heaven?--where is your patience?--Durum patientia frango--you are but\na young man--there may be many good things in store for you--accidit\nin puncto quo non speratur in anno--remember your uncle, Mr. Bowling;\nperhaps he is now on his voyage homeward, pleasing himself with the\nhopes of seeing and relieving you; nay, peradventure, he has already\narrived, for the ship was expected about this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A ray of hope\nshot athwart my soul at this suggestion; I thanked my friend for\nthis seasonable recollection, and, after having promised to take no\nresolution till his return, dismissed him to Wapping for intelligence.\n\nIn his absence I was visited by Banter, who, being informed of my bad\nluck at play, told me that fortune would probably be one day weary of\npersecuting me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meantime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere's a letter for you,\nwhich I received just now inclosed in one from Freeman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I snatched\nit with eagerness, and knowing the superscription to be of Narcissa's\nhandwriting, kissed it with transport, and, having opened it, read,\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is with great difficulty that I have stolen, from the observation of\nthose spies who are set over me, this opportunity of telling you, that\nI was suddenly carried away from Bath by my brother, who was informed of\nour correspondence by Lord Quiverwit whom, I since understand, you have\nwounded in a duel on my account. As I am fully convinced of your honour\nand love, I hope I shall never hear of such desperate proofs of either\nfor the future. I am so strictly watched that it will be impossible\nfor you to see me, until my brother's suspicion shall abate, or Heaven\ncontrive some other unforeseen event in our behalf. In the meantime, you\nmay depend on the constancy and affection of\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour own \u00e2\u0080\u009cNarcissa.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cP. S. Miss Williams, who is my fellow prisoner, desires to be\nremembered to you. We are both in good health, and only in pain for you,\nespecially as it will be impracticable for you to convey any message\nor letter to the place of our confinement; for which reason pray desist\nfrom the attempt, that, by miscarrying, might prolong our captivity.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cN--.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis kind letter afforded me great consolation: I communicated it to\nBanter, and, at the same time, showed him her picture: he approved of\nher beauty and good sense, and could not help owning that my neglect\nof Miss Snapper was excusable, when such a fine creature engrossed my\nattention.\n\nI began to be reconciled to my fate, and imagined, that, if I could\ncontrive means of subsisting until my uncle should arrive, in case he\nwere not already at home, he would enable me to do something effectual\nin behalf of my love and fortune; I therefore consulted Banter about\na present supply, who no sooner understood that I had credit, with\na tailor, than he advised me to take off two or three suits of rich\nclothes, and convert them into cash, by selling them at half-price to\na salesman in Monmouth Street. I was startled at this proposal, which\nI thought savoured a little of fraud; he rendered it palatable, by\nobserving that, in a few months, I might be in a condition to do\neverybody justice; and, in the meantime, I was acquitted by the honesty\nof my intention. I suffered myself to be persuaded by his salvo, by\nwhich my necessity, rather than my judgment, was convinced; and, when\nI found there were no accounts of the ship in which my uncle embarked,\nactually put the scheme in practice, and raised by it five-and-twenty\nguineas, paying him for his advice with the old five.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\nI am arrested--carried to the Marshalsea--find my old Acquaintance beau\nJackson in that Jail--he informs me of his Adventures--Strap arrives,\nand with difficulty is comforted--Jackson introduces me to a Poet--I\nadmire his Conversation and Capacity--am deeply affected with my\nMisfortune--Strap hires himself as a Journeyman Barber\n\nBut this expedient was in a few weeks followed with a consequence I\ndid not foresee. A player, having purchased one of the suits that were\nexposed to sale, appeared in it on the stage one night, while my tailor\nunfortunately happened to be present. He knew it immediately, and,\ninquiring minutely into the affair, discovered my whole contrivance:\nupon which he came into my lodgings, and telling me that he was very\nmuch straightened for want of money, presented his bill, which amounted\nto fifty pounds. Surprised at which unexpected address, I affected to\ntreat him cavalierly, swore some oaths, asked if he doubted my honour,\nand telling him I should take care whom I dealt with for the future,\nbade him come again in three days. He obeyed me punctually, demanded his\nmoney, and finding himself amused with bare promises, arrested me that\nvery day in the street. I was not much shocked at this adventure, which,\nindeed, put an end to a state of horrible expectation: but I refused\nto go to a sponging-house, where I heard there was nothing but the\nmost flagrant imposition: and, a coach being called, was carried to the\nMarshalsea, attended by a bailiff and his follower, who were very much\ndisappointed and chagrined at my resolution.\n\nThe turnkey, guessing from my appearance that I had money in my pocket,\nreceived me with the repetition of the Latin word depone, and gave me to\nunderstand, that I must pay beforehand for the apartment I should choose\nto dwell in. I desired to see his conveniences, and hired a small paltry\nbed-chamber for a crown a week, which, in any other place, would not\nhave let for half the money. Having taken possession of this dismal\nhabitation, I sent for Strap, and my thoughts were busied in collecting\nmatter of consolation to that faithful squire, when somebody knocked at\nmy door, which I no sooner opened, than a young fellow entered in very\nshabby clothes and marvellous foul linen. After a low bow, he called\nme by name, and asked if I had forgotten him. His voice assisted me\nin recollecting his person, whom I soon recognised to be my old\nacquaintance, Jackson, of whom mention is made in the first part of my\nmemoirs. I saluted him cordially, expressed my satisfaction at finding\nhim alive, and condoled him on his present situation, which, however,\ndid not seem to affect him much, for he laughed very heartily at the\noccasion of our meeting so unexpectedly in this place. Our mutual\ncompliments being past, I inquired about his amour with the lady of\nfortune, which seemed to be so near a happy conclusion when I had the\npleasure of seeing him last: and, after an immoderate fit of laughter,\nhe gave me to understand that he had been egregiously bit in that\naffair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat a few days after our adventure\nwith the bawd, and her b--ches, I found means to be married to that same\nblue lady you speak of, and passed the night with her at her lodgings,\nso much to her satisfaction, that early in the morning, after a good\ndeal of snivelling and sobbing, she owned, that, far from being an\nheiress of great fortune, she was no other than a common woman of the\ntown, who had decoyed me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the privilege\nof a femme couverte; and that, unless I made my escape immediately, I\nshould be arrested for a debt of her contracting, by bailiffs employed\nand instructed for that purpose. Startled at this intimation, I rose in\na twinkling, and taking leave of my spouse with several hearty damns,\ngot safe into the verge of the court, where I kept snug, until I was\nappointed surgeon's mate of a man-of-war at Portsmouth; for which place\nI set out on Sunday, went on board of my ship, in which I sailed to the\nStraits, where I had the good fortune to be made surgeon of a sloop that\ncame home a few months after, and was put out of commission: whereupon,\nI came to London, imagining myself forgotten, and freed from my wife and\nher creditors, but had not been in town a week, before I was arrested\nfor a debt of hers, amounting to twenty pounds, and brought to this\nplace, where I have been fixed by another action since that time.\nHowever, you know my disposition, I defy care and anxiety; and being\non the half-pay list, make shift to live here tolerably easy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\ncongratulated him on his philosophy, and, remembering that I was in his\ndebt, repaid the money he formerly lent me, which, I believe, was far\nfrom being unseasonable. I then inquired about the economy of the place,\nwhich he explained to my satisfaction; and, after we had agreed to mess\ntogether, he was just now going to give orders for dinner when Strap\narrived.\n\nI never in my life saw sorrow so extravagantly expressed in any\ncountenance as in that of my honest friend, which was, indeed,\nparticularly adapted by nature for such impressions. When we were left\nby ourselves, I communicated to him my disaster, and endeavoured to\nconsole him with the same arguments he had formerly used to me, withal\nrepresenting the fair chance I had of being relieved in a short time by\nMr. Bowling. But his grief was unutterable: he seemed to give attention\nwithout listening, and wrung his hands in silence; so that I was in a\nfair way of being infected by his behaviour, when Jackson returned, and,\nperceiving the deference I paid to Strap, although in a footman's\nhabit, distributed his crumbs of comfort with such mirth, jollity\nand unconcern, that the features of the distressed squire relaxed by\ndegrees; he recovered the use of speech, and began to be a little more\nreconciled to this lamentable event. We dined together on boiled beef\nand greens, brought from a cook's shop in the neighbourhood, and,\nalthough this meal was served up in a manner little corresponding with\nthe sphere of life in which I had lately lived, I made a virtue of\nnecessity, ate with good appetite, and treated my friends with a bottle\nof wine, which had the desired effect of increasing the good humour\nof my fellow prisoner, and exhilarating the spirits of Strap, who now\ntalked cavalierly of my misfortune.\n\nAfter dinner Jackson left us to our private affairs; when I desired my\nfriend to pack up all our things, and carry them to some cheap lodgings\nhe should choose for himself in the neighbourhood of the Marshalsea,\nafter he had discharged my lodgings, for which purpose I gave him money.\nI likewise recommended to him the keeping my misfortune secret, and\nsaying to my landlord, or any other who should inquire for me, that\nI was gone into the country for a few weeks: at the same time I laid\nstrong injunctions upon him to call every second day upon Banter, in\ncase he should receive any letter for me from Narcissa, by the channel\nof Freeman; and by all means to leave a direction for himself at my\nuncle's lodgings in Wapping, by which I might be found when my kinsman\nshould arrive.\n\nWhen he departed to execute these orders (which by the bye were\npunctually performed that very night), I found myself so little seasoned\nto my situation, that I dreaded reflection, and sought shelter from it\nin the company of the beau, who, promising to regale me with a lecture\nupon taste, conducted me to the common side, where I saw a number of\nnaked miserable wretches assembled together. We had not been here many\nminutes, when a figure appeared, wrapped in a dirty rug, tied about his\nloins with two pieces of list, of different colours, knotted together;\nhaving a black bushy beard, and his head covered with a huge mass of\nbrown periwig, which seems to have been ravished from the crown of some\nscarecrow. This apparition, stalking in with great solemnity, made\na profound bow to the audience, who signified their approbation by a\ngeneral response of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow d'ye do, doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then turned towards us,\nand honoured Jackson with a particular salutation, upon which my friend,\nin a formal manner, introduced him to me by the name of Mr. Melopoyn.\nThis ceremony being over, he advanced into the middle of the\ncongregation, which crowded around him, and hemming three times, to\nmy utter astonishment, pronounced with great significance of voice and\ngesture, a very elegant and ingenious discourse upon the difference\nbetween genius and taste, illustrating his assertions with apt\nquotations from the best authors, ancient as well as modern. When he had\nfinished his harangue, which lasted a full hour, he bowed again to the\nspectators; not one of whom (I was informed) understood so much as\na sentence of what he had uttered. They manifested, however, their\nadmiration and esteem by voluntary contributions, which Jackson told\nme, one week with another, amounted to eighteen pence. This moderate\nstipend, together with some small presents that he received for making\nup differences and deciding causes amongst the prisoners, just enabled\nhim to breathe and walk about in the grotesque figure I have described.\nI understood also, that he was an excellent poet, and had composed\na tragedy, which was allowed by everybody who had seen it to be a\nperformance of great merit: that his learning was infinite, his morals\nunexceptionable, and his modesty invincible. Such a character could not\nfail of attracting my regard; I longed impatiently to be acquainted with\nhim, and desired Jackson would engage him to spend the evening in my\napartment. My request was granted; he favoured us with his company, and,\nin the course of our conversation perceiving that I had a strong passion\nfor the Belles Lettres, acquitted himself so well on that subject, that\nI expressed a fervent desire of seeing his productions. In this point\ntoo he gratified my inclination; he promised to bring his tragedy to my\nroom next day, and in the meantime, entertained me with some detached\npieces, which gave me a very advantageous idea of his poetical talent.\nAmong other things I was particularly pleased with some elegies, in\nimitation of Tibullus; one of which I beg leave to submit to the reader\nas a specimen of his complexion and capacity:--\n\n\nWhere now are all my flattering dreams of joy? Monimia, give my soul her\nwonted rest;-- Since first thy beauty fixed my roving eye, heart-gnawing\ncares corrode my pensive breast!\n\nLet happy lovers fly where pleasures call, With festive songs beguile\nthe fleeting hour, Lead beauty through the mazes of the ball, Or press\nher wanton in love's roseate bower:\n\nFor me, no more I'll range the empurpled mead, Where shepherd's pipe and\nvirgins dance around, Nor wander through the woodbine's fragrant shade,\nTo hear the music of the grove resound.\n\nI'll seek some lonely church, or dreary hall, Where fancy paints the\nglimmering taper blue, Where damps hang mouldering on the ivy'd wall,\nAnd sheeted ghosts drink up the midnight dew,\n\nThere, leagued with hopeless anguish and despair, A while in silence\no'er my fate repair: Then, with a long farewell to love and care, To\nkindred dust my weary limbs consign.\n\nWilt thou, Monimia, shed a gracious tear On the cold grave where all my\nsorrows rest? Strew vernal flowers, applaud my love sincere, And bid the\nturf lie easy on my breast?\n\nI was wonderfully affected with this pathetic complaint, which seemed so\nwell calculated for my own disappointment in love, that I could not help\nattaching the idea of Narcissa to the name of Monimia, and of forming\nsuch melancholy presages of my passion, that I could not recover\nmy tranquillity: and was fain to have recourse to the bottle, which\nprepared me for a profound sleep that I could not otherwise have\nenjoyed. Whether these impressions invited and introduced a train of\nother melancholy reflections, or my fortitude was all exhausted in\nthe effort I made against despondence, during the first day of my\nimprisonment, I cannot determine; but I awoke in the horrors, and found\nmy imagination haunted with such dismal apparitions, that I was ready\nto despair: and I believe the reader will own, I had no great cause to\ncongratulate myself, when I considered my situation. I was interrupted\nin the midst of these gloomy apprehensions by the arrival of Strap, who\ncontributed not a little to the re-establishment of my peace, by letting\nme know that he had hired himself as a journeyman barber; by which means\nhe would be able not only to save me a considerable expense, but even\nmake shift to lay up something for my subsistence, after my money should\nbe spent, in case I should not be relieved before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\nI read Melopoyn's Tragedy, and conceive a vast Opinion of his Genius--he\nrecounts his Adventures\n\nWhile we ate our breakfast together, I made him acquainted with the\ncharacter and condition of the poet, who came in with his play at that\ninstant, and, imagining we were engaged about business, could not be\nprevailed upon to sit; but, leaving his performance, went away. My\nfriend's tender heart was melted at the sight of a gentleman and\nChristian (for he had a great veneration for both these epithets) in\nsuch misery; and assented with great cheerfulness to a proposal I made\nof clothing him with the our superfluities; a task with which he charged\nhimself, and departed immediately to perform it.\n\nHe was to sooner gone than I locked my door, and sat down to the\ntragedy; which I read to the end with vast pleasure, not a little\namazed at conduct of the managers who had rejected it. The fable, in\nmy opinion, was well chosen and naturally conducted, the incidents\ninteresting, the characters beautifully contrasted, strongly marked, and\nwell supported; the diction poetical, spirited and correct; the unities\nof the drama maintained with the most scrupulous exactness; the opening\ngradual and engaging, the peripeteia surprising, and the catastrophe\naffecting. In short, I judged it by the laws of Aristotle and Horace,\nand could find nothing in it exceptionable but a little too much\nembellishment in some few places, which objection he removed to my\nsatisfaction, by a quotation of Aristotle's poetics, importing, that the\nleast interesting parts of a poem ought to be raised and dignified by\nthe charms and energy of diction.\n\nI revered his genius, and was seized with an eager curiosity to know the\nparticular events of a fortune so unworthy of his merit. At that\ninstant Strap returned with a bundle of clothes, which I sent with my\ncompliments to Mr. Melopoyn, as s small token of my regard, and\ndesired the favour of his company to dinner. He accepted my present\nand invitation, and in less than half-an-hour made his appearance in\na decent dress, which altered his figure very much to his advantage. I\nperceived by his countenance that his heart was big with gratitude, and\nendeavoured to prevent his acknowledgments, by asking pardon for the\nliberty I had taken; he made no reply, but, with an aspect full of\nadmiration and esteem, bowed to the ground, while the tears gushed from\nhis eyes. Affected with these symptoms of an ingenuous mind, I shifted\nthe conversation, and complimented him on his performance, which I\nassured him afforded me infinite pleasure. My approbation made him\nhappy. Dinner being served, and Jackson arrived, I begged their\npermission for Strap to sit at table with us, after having informed them\nthat he was a person to whom I was extremely obliged; they were kind\nenough to grant that favour, and we ate together with great harmony and\nsatisfaction.\n\nOur meal being ended, I expressed my wonder at the little regard Mr.\nMelopoyn had met with from the world: and signified a desire of hearing\nhow he had been treated by the managers of the playhouses, to whom I\nunderstood from Jackson, he had offered his tragedy without success.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is so little entertaining in the incidents of my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am sure the recital will not recompense your attention; but,\nsince you discover an inclination to know them I understand my duty too\nwell to disappoint your desire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father, who was a curate in the country, being by the narrowness of\nhis circumstances hindered from maintaining me at the university, took\nthe charge of my education upon himself, and laboured with such industry\nand concern in the undertaking, that I had little cause to regret the\nwant of public masters. Being at great pains to consult my natural bias,\nHe discovered in me betimes an inclination for poetry; upon which he\nrecommended to me an intimate acquaintance with the classics, in the\ncultivation of which he assisted me with a paternal zeal and uncommon\nerudition. When he thought me sufficiently acquainted with the ancients,\nhe directed my studies to the best modern authors, French and Italian\nas well as English, and laid a particular injunction upon me make myself\nmaster of my mother tongue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout the age of eighteen, I grew ambitious of undertaking a work of\nsome consequence; and, with my father's approbation, actually planned\nthe tragedy you have read; but, before I had finished four acts, that\nindulgent parent died, and left my mother and me in very indigent\ncircumstances. A near relation, compassionating our distress, took us\ninto his family, where I brought my fable to a conclusion; and, soon\nafter that period my mother quitted this life. When my sorrow for this\nmelancholy event had subsided, I told my kinsman, who was a farmer,\nthat, having paid my last duty to my parent, I had now no attachment\nto detain me in the country, and therefore was resolved to set out\nfor London, and offer my play to the stage, where I did not doubt of\nacquiring a large share of fame as well as fortune; in which case I\nshould not be unmindful of my friends and benefactors. My cousin was\nravished with the prospect of my felicity, and willingly contributed\ntowards the expense of fitting me out for my expedition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccordingly I took a place in the waggon, and arrived in town, where I\nhired an apartment in a garret, willing to live as frugally as possible,\nuntil I should know what I had to expect from the manager, to whom I\nintended to offer my play. For, though I looked upon myself as perfectly\nsecure of a good reception, imagining that a patentee would be as eager\nto receive as I to present my production, I did not know whether or not\nhe might be pre-engaged in favour of another author, a circumstance\nthat would certainly retard my success. On this consideration, too, I\ndetermined to be speedy in my application, and even to wait upon one of\nthe managers the very next day. For this purpose, I inquired my landlord\nif he knew where either or both of them lived: and he, being curious\nto know my business, and at the same time appearing to be a very honest\nfriendly man (a tallow chandler), I made him acquainted with my design,\nupon which he told me that I went the wrong way to work; that I would\nnot find such easy access to a manager as I imagined; and that if I\ndelivered my performance without proper recommendation, it would be as\none to a thousand if ever it would be minded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake my advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand your business is done. One of the patentees is a good catholic,\nas I am, and uses the same father who confesses me. I will make you\nacquainted with this good priest, who is an excellent scholar, and if he\nshould approve of your play, his recommendation will go a great way\nin determining Mr. Supple to bring it on the stage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I applauded his\nexpedient, and was introduced to the friar, who, having perused the\ntragedy, was pleased to signify his approbation, and commended me in\nparticular for having avoided all reflections upon religion. He promised\nto use all his influence with his son Supple in my behalf, and to inform\nhimself that very day at what time it was proper for me to wait upon him\nwith the piece. He was punctual in performing his engagement, and next\nmorning gave me to understand that he had mentioned my affair to the\nmanager, and that I had nothing more to do than to go to his house any\ntime in the forenoon, and make use of his name, upon which I should find\nimmediate admittance. I took his advice, put my performance in my bosom,\nand, having received directions, went immediately to the house of Mr.\nSupple, and knocked at the door, which had a wicket in the middle, faced\nwith a net-work of iron. Through this a servant having viewed me for\nsome time, demanded to know my business. I told him my business was\nwith Mr. Supple, and that I came from Mr. O'Varnish. He examined my\nappearance once more, then went away, returned in a few minutes, and\nsaid his master was busy, and could not be seen. Although I was a little\nmortified at my disappointment, I was persuaded that my reception was\nowing to Mr. Supple's ignorance of my errand: and, that I might meet\nwith no more obstructions of the same kind, I desired Mr. O'Varnish\nto be my introductor the next time. He complied with my request, and\nobtained immediate admittance to the manager, who received me with\nthe utmost civility, and promised to read my play with the first\nconvenience. By his own appointment I called again in a fortnight, but\nhe was gone out: I returned in a week after, and the poor gentleman\nwas extremely ill: I renewed my visit in a fortnight after that, and he\nassured me he had been so much fatigued with business, that he had\nnot been able as yet to read it to an end, but he would take the first\nopportunity: and, in the meantime, observed that what he had yet seen of\nit was very entertaining. I comforted myself with this declaration a few\nweeks longer, at the end of which I appeared again before his wicket,\nwas let in, and found him laid up with the gout. I no sooner entered\nhis chamber than, looking at me with a languishing eye, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nMelopoyn, I'm heartily sorry for an accident that has happened during my\nillness. You must know that my eldest boy, finding your manuscript upon\nthe table in the dining-room, where I used to read it, carried it into\nthe kitchen, and leaving it there, a negligent wench of a cook-maid,\nmistaking it for waste paper, has expended it but a few leaves\nin singing fowls upon the spit. But I hope the misfortune is not\nirreparable, since, no doubt, you have several copies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI protest to you, my good friend, Mr. Random, I was extremely shocked\nat this information; but the good-natured gentleman seemed to be so much\naffected with my misfortune, that I suppressed my concern, and told him\nthat, although I had not another copy, I should be able to retrieve the\nloss by writing another from my memory, which was very tenacious. You\ncannot imagine how well pleased Mr. Supple was at this assurance; he\nbegged I would set about it immediately, and carefully revolve and\nrecollect every circumstance before I pretended to commit it to\npaper, that it might be the same individual play that he had perused.\nEncouraged by this injunction, which plainly demonstrated how much he\ninterested himself in the affair, I tasked my remembrance and industry,\nand in three weeks produced the exact image of the former, which was\nconveyed to him by my good friend Father O'Varnish, who told me next\nday, that Mr. Supple would revise it superficially, in order to judge\nof its sameness with the other, and then give his final answer. For\nthis examination I allotted a week: and, in full confidence of seeing it\nacted in a little while, demanded an audience of the manager, when that\nterm was expired. But, alas! the season had slipped away insensibly. He\nconvinced me, that if my play had been put into rehearsal at the time,\nit could not have been ready for performing until the end of March, when\nthe benefit nights came on; consequently, it would have interfered with\nthe interest of the players, whom it was not my business to disoblige.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was fain to acquiesce in these reasons, which, to be sure, were\nextremely just; and to reserve my performance for the next season,\nwhen he hoped I would not be so unlucky. Although it was a grievous\ndisappointment to me, who, by this time, began to want both money and\nnecessaries; having on the strength of my expectation from the theatre,\nlaunched out into some extravagances, by which the sum I brought to\ntown was already almost consumed. Indeed, I ought to be ashamed at this\ncircumstance of my conduct; for my finances were sufficient, with\ngood economy, to have maintained me comfortably a whole year. You will\nperhaps be amazed when I tell you that, in six months, I expended not a\nfarthing less than ten guineas: but, when one considers the temptations\nto which a young man is exposed in this great city, especially if he\nbe addicted to pleasure, as I am, the wonder will vanish, or at least\nabate. Nor was the cause of my concern limited to my own situation\nentirely: I had written an account of my good reception to my kinsman\nthe farmer, and desired him to depend upon me for the money he had\nkindly accommodated me with about the end of February, which promise\nI now found myself unable to perform. However, there was no remedy but\npatience: I applied to my landlord, who was a very good-natured man,\ncandidly owned my distress, and begged his advice in laying down some\nplan for my subsistence; he readily promised to consult his confessor on\nthis subject, and, in the meantime, told me, I was welcome to lodge\nand board with him until fortune should put it in my power to make\nrestitution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. O'Varnish, being informed of my necessity, offered to introduce me\nto the author of a weekly paper, who, he did not doubt, would employ\nme in that way, provided he should find me duly qualified; but, upon\ninquiry, I understood that this journal was calculated to foment\ndivisions in the commonwealth, and therefore I desired to be excused\nfrom engaging in it. He then proposed that I should write something in\nthe poetical way, which I might dispose of to a bookseller for a pretty\nsum of ready money, and, perhaps, establish my own character into the\nbargain. This event would infallibly procure friends, and my tragedy\nwould appear next season to the best advantage, by being supported both\nby interest and reputation. I was charmed with this prospect, and having\nheard what friends Mr. Pope acquired by his pastorals, set about a work\nof that kind, and in less than six weeks composed as many eclogues,\nwhich I forthwith offered to an eminent bookseller, who desired me to\nleave them for his perusal, and he would give an answer in two days. At\nthe end of that time, I went to him, when he returned the poems, telling\nme, they would not answer his purpose, and sweetened his refusal by\nsaying there were some good clever lines in them. Not a little dejected\nat this rebuff, which, I learned from Mr. O'Varnish, was owing to the\nopinion of another author whom this bookseller always consulted on these\noccasions, I applied to another person of the same profession, who told\nme the town was cloyed with pastorals, and advised me, if I intended to\nprofit by my talents, to write something satirical or luscious, such as\nthe Button Hole, Shockey and Towner, The Leaky Vessel, etc, and yet this\nwas a man in years, who wore a reverend periwig, looked like a\nsenator, and went regularly to church. Be that as it will, I scorned\nto prostitute my pen in the manner proposed, and carried my papers to a\nthird, who assured me that poetry was entirely out of his way; and asked\nme if I had got never a piece of secret history, thrown into a series\nof letters, or a volume of adventures, such as those of Robinson Crusoe,\nand Colonel Jack, or a collection of Conundrums, wherewith to entertain\nthe plantations. Being quite unfurnished for this dealer, I had recourse\nto another with as little success; and I verily believe, was rejected by\nthe whole trade.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was afterwards persuaded to offer myself as a translator, and\naccordingly repaired to a person who was said to entertain numbers of\nthat class in his pay; he assured me, he had already a great deal of\nthat work on his hands, which he did not know what to do with; observed\nthat translations were a mere drug, that branch of literature being\noverstocked with an inundation of authors from North Britain; and asked\nwhat I would expect per sheet for rendering the Latin classics into\nEnglish. That I might not make myself too cheap, I determined to set a\nhigh price upon my qualifications, and demanded half-a-guinea for every\ntranslated sheet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalf-a-guinea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, staring at me; then paused\na little, and said, he had no occasion for my service at present. I\nfound my error, and, resolving to make amends, fell one-half in my\ndemand; upon which he stared at me and told me his hands were full. I\nattempted others without finding employment, and was actually reduced\nto a very uncomfortable prospect, when I bethought myself of offering my\ntalents to the printers of half-penny ballads and other such occasional\nessays, as are hawked about the streets. With this in view I applied to\none of the most noted and vociferous of this tribe, who directed me to a\nperson whom I found entertaining a whole crowd of them with gin, bread,\nand cheese; he carried me into a little back parlour, very neatly\nfurnished, where I signified my desire of being enrolled among\nhis writers; and was asked what kind of composition I professed.\nUnderstanding that my inclination leaned towards poetry, he expressed\nhis satisfaction, telling me one of his poets had lost his senses, and\nwas confined in Bedlam, and the other was become dozed with drinking\ndrams; so that he had not done anything tolerable these many weeks. When\nI proposed that we should enter into terms of agreement, he gave me to\nunderstand that his bargains were always conditional, and his authors\npaid in proportion to the sale of their works.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving therefore settled these conditions, which (I do assure you) were\nnot very advantageous to me, he assigned me a subject for ballad, which\nwas to be finished in two hours; and I retired to my garret in order\nto perform his injunction. As the theme happened to suit my fancy,\nI completed a pretty sort of an ode within the time prescribed, and\nbrought it to him, big with hope of profit and applause. He read it in\na twinkling, and, to my utter astonishment, told me it would not do;\nthough indeed he owned I wrote a good hand, an spelled very well, but\nmy language was too high flown, and of consequence not at all adapted\nto the capacity and taste of his customers. I promised to rectify that\nmistake and in half an hour humbled my style to the comprehension of\nvulgar readers; he approved of the alteration, and gave me some hopes\nof succeeding in time, though he observed that my performance was very\ndeficient in the quaintness of expression that pleases the multitude:\nhowever, to encourage me, he ventured the expense of printing and paper,\nand, if I remember aright, my share of the sale amounted to fourpence\nhalfpenny.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom that day I studied the Grub Street manner with great diligence,\nand at length became such a proficient that my works were in\ngreat request among the most polite of the chairmen, draymen,\nhackney-coachmen, footmen, and servant maids: nay, I have enjoyed the\npleasure of seeing my productions adorned with cuts, pasted upon the\nwalls as ornaments in beer cellars and cobblers' stalls; and have\nactually heard them sung in clubs of substantial tradesmen--but empty\npraise (you know, my dear friend) will not supply the cravings nature.\nI found myself in danger of starving in the midst of all my fame; for of\nten songs I composed, it was well if two had the good fortune to please.\nFor this reason I turned my thoughts to prose, and, during a tract of\ngloomy weather, published an apparition, on the substance of which I\nsubsisted very comfortably a whole month; I have made many a good meal\nupon a monster; a rape has often afforded me great satisfaction; but\na murder, well timed, was my never-failing resource. What then? I\nwas almost a slave to my employers, who expected to be furnished at\na minute's warning with prose and verse, just as they thought the\ncircumstances of the times required, whether the inclination was absent\nor present. Upon my sincerity, Mr. Random, I have been so much pestered\nand besieged by those children of clamour, that life became a burden to\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\nThe Continuation and Conclusion of Mr. Melopoyn's Story\n\n'I made shift, notwithstanding, to maintain myself till the beginning\nof next winter, when I renewed my addresses to my friend Mr. Supple, and\nwas most graciously received. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been thinking of your affair,\nMr. Melopoyn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand am determined to show how far I have\nyour interest at heart, by introducing you to a young nobleman of my\nacquaintance, who is remarkable for his fine taste in dramatic writings,\nand is besides a man of such influence that, if once he should approve\nof your play, his patronage will support it against all the efforts\nof envy and ignorance; for, I do assure you, that merit alone will not\nbring success. I have already spoken of your performance to Lord Rattle,\nand if you will call at my house in a day or two, you shall have a\nletter of introduction to his lordship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was sensibly touched with\nthis mark of Mr. Supple's friendship; and looking upon my affair as\nalready done, went home and imparted my good fortune to my landlord,\nwho, to render my appearance more acceptable to my patron, procured a\nsuit of new clothes for me on his own credit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot to trouble you with idle particulars, I carried my tragedy to his\nlordship's lodgings, and sent it up along with Mr. Supple's letter by\none of his servants, who desired me, by his lord's order, to return in\na week. I did so, and was admitted to his lordship, who received me very\ncourteously, told me he had perused my play, which he thought, on the\nwhole, was the best coup d'essai he had ever seen; but that he had\nmarked some places in the margin, which he imagined might be altered for\nthe better. I was transported with this reception, and promised (with\nmany acknowledgments of his lordship's generosity) to be governed solely\nby his advice and direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrite another fair copy with the alterations I\nhave proposed, and bring it to me as soon as possible; for I am resolved\nto have it brought on the stage this winter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You may be sure I set\nabout this task with alacrity; and although I found his lordship's\nremarks much more numerous and of less importance than I expected, I\nthought it was not my interest to dispute upon trifles with my patron;\ntherefore new modelled it according to his desire in less than a month.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I waited upon him with the manuscript, I found one of the actors\nat breakfast with his lordship, who immediately introduced him to my\nacquaintance, and desired him to read a scene of my play. This task\nhe performed very much to my satisfaction, with regard to emphasis and\npronunciation; but he signified his disgust at several words in\nevery page, which I presuming to defend, Lord Rattle told me, with a\nperemptory look, I must not pretend to dispute with him, who had been\na player these twenty years, and understood the economy of the stage\nbetter than any man living. I was forced to submit; and his lordship\nproposed the same actor should read the whole play in the evening,\nbefore some gentlemen of his acquaintance, whom he would convene to his\nlodgings for that purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was present at the reading; and I protest to you, my dear friend, I\nnever underwent such a severe trial in the whole course of my life at\nthat juncture; for although the player might be a very honest man and a\ngood performer, he was excessively illiterate and assuming, and made\na thousand frivolous objections, which I was not permitted to answer.\nHowever, the piece was very much applauded on the whole; the gentlemen\npresent, who, I understood, were men of fortune, promised to countenance\nand support it as much as they could; and Lord Rattle, assuring me that\nhe would act the part of a careful nurse to it, desired me to carry it\nhome, and alter it immediately according to their remarks. I was fain to\nacquiesce in his determination, and fulfilled his injunctions with all\nthe expedition in my power; but, before I could present the new copy,\nmy good friend Mr. Supple had disposed of his property and patent to one\nMr. Brayer; so that fresh interest was to be made with the new manager.\nThis task Lord Rattle undertook, having some acquaintance with him, and\nrecommended my performance so strongly that it was received.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI looked upon myself now as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of\nall my labour. I waited a few days in expectation of its being put in\nrehearsal, and wondering at the delay, applied to my worthy patron, who\nexcused Mr. Brayer on account of the multiplicity of business in which\nhe was involved, and bade me beware of teasing the patentee. I treasured\nup this caution, and exerted my particular three weeks longer; at the\nend of which his lordship gave me to understand that Mr. Brayer had read\nmy play, and owned it had indubitable merit; but, as he had long been\npre-engaged to another author, he could not possibly represent it that\nseason; though, if I would reserve it for the next, and in the interim\nmake such alterations as he had proposed by observations on the margin,\nI might depend upon his compliance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThunderstruck at this disappointment, I could not, for some minutes,\nutter one syllable. At length, however, I complained bitterly of the\nmanager's insincerity in amusing me so long, when he knew from the\nbeginning that he could not gratify my desire. But his lordship\nreprimanded me for my freedom, said Mr. Brayer was a man of honour, and\nimputed his behaviour with respect to me nothing else but forgetfulness.\nAnd indeed I have had some reason, since that time, to be convinced of\nhis bad memory; for, in spite of appearances, I will not allow myself\nto interpret his conduct in any other way. Lord Rattle observing me very\nmuch affected with my disappointment, offered his interest to bring\non my play at the other house, which I eagerly accepting, he forthwith\nwrote a letter of recommendation to Mr. Bellower, actor and prime\nminister to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that theatre, and desired me\nto deliver it with my tragedy, without loss of time. Accordingly, I\nhastened to his house, where after having waited a whole hour in the\nlobby, I was admitted to his presence, and my performance received with\ngreat state. He told me he was extremely busy at present, but he would\nperuse it as soon as possible, and bade me to call again in a week.\nI took my leave, not a little astonished at the pert and supercilious\nbehaviour of this stage player, who had not treated me with good\nmanners; and began to think the dignity of a poet greatly impaired\nsince the days of Euripides and Sophocles; but all this was nothing in\ncomparison of what I have since observed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Mr. Random, I went back at the appointed time, and was told that\nMr. Bellower was engaged, and could not see me, I repeated my visit a\nfew days after, and having waited a considerable time was favoured with\nan audience, during which, he said, he had not as yet read my play.\nNettled at this usage, I could contain myself no longer, but, telling\nhim, I imagined he would have paid more deference to Lord Rattle's\nrecommendation, demanded my manuscript with some expression of\nresentment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in a theatrical tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith all my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Then pulling out the drawer of the bureau at which he sat, he took out\na bundle, and threw it upon a table that was near him, pronouncing the\nword, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d with great disdain. I took it up, and perceiving with\nsome surprise, that it was a comedy, told him it did not belong to\nme; upon which he offered another which I also disclaimed. A third was\nproduced, and rejected for the same reason. At length he pulled out a\nwhole bundle, and spread them before me, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are seven--take\nwhich you please--or take them all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I singled out my own, and went\naway, struck dumb with admiration at what I had seen--not so much on\naccount of his insolence, as of the number of new plays which from this\ncircumstance I concluded were yearly offered to the stage. You may be\nsure, I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron, who did not\nreceive it with all the indignation I expected; but taxed me with\nprecipitation, and told me I must lay my account with bearing with the\nhumours of the players, if I intended to write for the stage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is\nnow no other remedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut to keep it till the next season for\nMr. Brayer, and alter it at your leisure, in the summer, according to\nhis directions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was now reduced to a terrible alternative, either to\nquit all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all along promised myself\na large share of fortune and reputation, or to encounter eight long\nmonths of adversity in preparing for and expecting its appearance. This\nlast penance, painful as it was, seemed most eligible to my reflection\nat that time, and therefore I resolved to undergo it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should I tire you with particulars of my consequence? I wrestled\nwith extreme poverty until the time of my probation was expired; and\nwent to my Lord Rattle in order to remind him of my affair, when I\nunderstood, to my great concern, that his lordship was just on the point\nof going abroad, and which was still more unfortunate for me, Mr. Brayer\nhad gone into the country; so that my generous patron had it not in his\npower to introduce me personally, as he intended: however, he wrote a\nvery strong letter to the manager in my favour, and put him in mind of\nthe promise he had made in behalf of my play.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs soon as I was certified of Brayer's return, I went to his house with\nthis letter, but was told he was gone out. I called again next day early\nin the morning, received the same answer, and was desired to leave\nmy name and business: I did so, and returned the day after, when\nthe servant still affirmed that his master was gone abroad; though I\nperceived him, as I retired, observing me through a window. Incensed\nat this discovery, I went to a coffee-house hard by, and, inclosing his\nlordship's letter in one from myself, demanded a categorical answer.\nI sent it to his house by a porter, who returned in a few minutes, and\ntold me Mr. Brayer would be glad to see me at that instant. I obeyed\nthe summons, and was received with such profusion of compliments and\napologies, that my resentment immediately subsided, and I was even in\npain for the concern which this holiest man showed at the mistake of his\nservant, who, it seems, had been ordered to deny him to everybody but\nme. He expressed the utmost veneration for his good and noble friend,\nLord Rattle, whom he should always be proud to serve; promised to peruse\nthe play with all dispatch, and give me a meeting upon it: and, as a\ntestimony of his esteem, made me a present of a general order for the\nseason, by which I should be admitted to any part of the theatre. This\nwas a very agreeable compliment to me, whose greatest pleasure consisted\nin seeing dramatic performances, and you need not doubt that I often\navailed myself of my privilege. As I had an opportunity of being behind\nthe scenes when I pleased, I frequently conversed with Mr. Brayer about\nmy play, and asked when he meant to put it into rehearsal; but he\nhad always so much business upon his hands, that it remained with\nhim unopened a considerable while; and I became very uneasy about the\nseason, that wasted apace, when I saw in the papers another new play\nadvertised, which had been written, offered, accepted, and rehearsed,\nin the compass of three months. You may easily guess how much I was\nconfounded at this event! I own to you that, in the first transports of\nmy anger, I suspected Mr. Brayer of having acted towards me in the most\npitiful perfidious manner; and was actually glad at his disappointment\nin the success of his favourite piece, which, by the strength of art,\nlingered till the third night, and then died in a deplorable manner. But\nnow that passion has no share in my reflection, I am willing to ascribe\nhis behaviour to his want of memory or want of judgment, which, you\nknow, are natural defects, that are more worthy of compassion than\nreproach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout this time I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman, who,\nhaving heard of my tragedy, told me, she was well acquainted with the\nwife of a gentleman who was very well known to a lady, who had great\ninterest with a person who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit: and that,\nif I pleased, she would use her influence in my behalf. As this nobleman\nhad the character of a Maecenas in the nation, and could stamp a value\nupon any work by his sole countenance and approbation, I accepted\nher offer with eagerness, in full confidence of seeing my reputation\nestablished, and my wishes fulfilled in a very short time, provided\nthat I should have the good fortune to please his lordship's taste. I\nwithdrew the manuscript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and committed\nit to the care of this gentlewoman, who laboured so effectually in my\ninterest, that in less than a month it was conveyed to the earl, and in\na few weeks after, I had the satisfaction to hear that he had read and\napproved it very much. Transported with this piece of intelligence,\nI flattered myself with the hopes of his interesting himself in its\nfavour, but, hearing no more of this matter in three whole months,\nI began (God forgive me!) to suspect the veracity of the person who\nbrought me the good tidings; for I thought it impossible that a man\nof his rank and character, who knew the difficulty of writing a good\ntragedy, and understood the dignity of the work, should read and applaud\nan essay of this kind, without feeling an inclination to befriend the\nauthor, whom his countenance alone could raise above dependence. But it\nwas not long before I found my friend very much wronged by my opinion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must know, that the civilities I had received from Lord Rattle, and\nthe desire he manifested to promote the success of my play, encouraged\nme to write an account of my bad fortune to his lordship, who\ncondescended so far as to desire, by letter, a young squire of a\ngreat estate, with whom he was intimate, to espouse my cause, and,\nin particular, make me acquainted with one Mr. Marmozet, a celebrated\nplayer, who had lately appeared on the stage with astonishing eclat, and\nbore such sway in the house where he acted, that the managers durst not\nrefuse anything he recommended. The young gentleman, whom Lord Rattle\nhad employed for this purpose, being diffident of his own interest with\nMr. Marmozet, had recourse to a nobleman of his acquaintance, who,\nat his solicitation, was so good as to introduce me to him; and the\nconversation turning upon my performance, I was not a little surprised,\nas well as pleased, to hear that Earl Sheerwit had spoken very much\nin its praise, and even sent Mr. Marmozet the copy, with a message,\nexpressing a desire that he would act in it next season. Nor was this\nfavourite actor backward in commending the piece, which he mentioned\nwith such expressions of regard, that I do not choose to repeat:\nassuring me that he would appear in it, provided he should be engaged\nto play at all during the ensuing season. In the meantime, he desired I\nwould give him leave to peruse it in the country, whither he intended\nto remove next day, that he might have leisure to consider and point out\nsuch alterations as might, perhaps, be necessary for its representation;\nand took my direction, that he might communicate by letter the\nobservations he should make. Trusting to these assurances, and the\ninterest which had been made in my behalf, I hugged myself in the\nexpectation of seeing it not only acted, but acted to the greatest\nadvantage, and this I thought could not fail of recompensing me in ample\nmanner for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone; but six weeks\nbeing elapsed, I did not know how to reconcile Mr. Marmozet's silence\nwith his promise of writing to me in ten days after he set out for the\ncountry; however, I was at last favoured with a letter, importing that\nhe had made some remarks on my tragedy, which he would freely impart at\nmeeting, and advised me to put it, without loss of time, into the hands\nof that manager, who had the best company; as he himself was quite\nuncertain whether or not he should be engaged that winter. I was a good\ndeal alarmed at this last part of his letter, and advised about it\nwith a friend, who told me, it was a plain indication of Mr. Marmozet's\ndesire to get rid of his promise; that his pretended uncertainty about\nacting next winter was no other than a scandalous evasion; for, to his\ncertain knowledge, he was already engaged, or at least in terms, with\nMr. Vandal; and that his design was to disappoint me, in favour of a new\ncomedy, which he had purchased of the author, and intended to bring upon\nthe stage for his own advantage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn short, my dear sir, this person, who, I must own, is if a sanguine\ncomplexion, handled the moral character of Mr. Marmozet with such\nseverity, that I began to suspect him of some particular prejudice,\nand put myself upon my guard against his insinuations. I ought to crave\npardon for this tedious narration of trivial circumstances, which,\nhowever interesting they may be to me, must certainly be very dry and\ninsipid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair. But I understand\nthe meaning of your looks, and will proceed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, Mr. Marmozet, upon his return to town, treated me with\nuncommon complaisance, and invited me to his lodgings, where he proposed\nto communicate his remarks, which, I confess, were more unfavourable\nthan I expected; but I answered his objections, and, as I thought,\nbrought him over to my opinion; for, on the whole, he signified the\nhighest approbation of the performance. In the course of our dispute,\nI was not a little surprised to find this poor gentleman's memory so\ntreacherous, as to let him forget what he had said to me, before he went\nout of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwit's opinion of my play, which\nhe now professed himself ignorant of; and I was extremely mortified at\nhearing from his own mouth, that his interest with Mr. Vandal was so\nvery low as to be insufficient of itself to bring a new piece upon the\nstage. I then begged his advice, and he counselled me to apply to Earl\nSheerwit, for a message in my favour to the manager, who would not\npresume to refuse anything recommended by so great man; and he was so\nkind as to promise to second this message with all his power. I\nhad immediate recourse to the worthy gentlewoman my friend, already\nmentioned, who opened the channels of her conveyance with such\nexpedition, that in a few days I had a promise of the message, provided\nI could assure myself of Mr. Vandal's being unengaged to any other\nwriter; for his lordship did not choose to condescend so far, until he\nshould understand that there was a probability (at least) of succeeding;\nat the same time that blessed me with this piece of news, I was startled\nat another, by the same channel of communication; which was, that Mr.\nMarmozet, before he advised me to this application, had informed the\nearl that he had read my play, and found it altogether unfit for the\nstage. Though I could not doubt the certainty of this intelligence, I\nbelieved there was some inapprehension in the case; and, without taking\nany notice of it, told Mr. Marmozet the answer I had been favoured with;\nand he promised to ask Mr. Vandal the question proposed. I waited upon\nhim in a day or two, when he gave me to understand, that Mr. Vandal\nhaving professed himself free of all engagements, he had put my play\ninto his hands, and represented it as a piece strongly recommended by\nEarl Sheerwit, who (he assured him) would honour him with a message\nin its favour; and he desired me to call for an answer at Mr. Vandal's\nhouse in three days. I followed his directions, and found the manager,\nwho being made acquainted with my business, owned that Mr. Marmozet\nhad given him a manuscript play, but denied that he had mentioned Earl\nSheerwit's name. When I informed him of the circumstances of the affair,\nhe said, he had no engagement with any author; that he would read my\ntragedy forthwith; and did not believe he should venture to reject it\nin contradiction to his lordship's opinion, for which he had the utmost\nveneration, but put it into rehearsal without loss of time. I was\nso much intoxicated with this encouragement, that I overlooked the\nmysterious conduct of Mr. Marmozet, and attended the manager at the\ntime appointed, when, to my infinite confusion, he pronounced my play\nimproper for the stage, and rejected it accordingly. As soon as I could\nrecollect myself from the disorder into which this unexpected refusal\nhad thrown me, I expressed a desire of hearing his objections, which\nwere so groundless, indistinct, and unintelligible, that I persuaded\nmyself he had not at all perused the piece, but had been prompted by\nsomebody whose lessons he had not rightly retained. However, I have been\nsince informed that the poor man's head, which was not naturally very\nclear, had been disordered with superstition, and that he laboured under\nthe tyranny of a wife, and the terrors of hellfire at the same time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPrecipitated in this manner from the highest pinnacle of hope to\nthe abyss of despondence, I was ready to sink under the burden of\nmy affliction, and, in the bitterness of my anguish, could not help\nentertaining some doubts of Mr. Marmozet's integrity, when I recollected\nand compared the circumstances of his conduct towards me. I was\nencouraged in this suspicion by being told that my Lord Sheerwit\nhad spoken of his character with great contempt: and, in particular,\nresented his insolence in opposing his own taste to that of his\nlordship, concerning my tragedy. While I hesitated between different\nopinions of the matter, that friend, who (as I told you before) was\na little hot-headed, favoured me with a visit, and, having heard a\ncircumstantial account of the whole affair, could not contain his\nindignation, but affirmed without ceremony that Mr. Marmozet was the\nsole occasion of my disappointment; that he acted from first to last\nwith the most perfidious dissimulation, cajoling me with insinuating\ncivilities, while he underhand employed all his art and influence to\nprejudice the ignorant manager against my performance; that nothing\ncould equal his hypocrisy but his avarice, which engrossed the faculties\nof his soul so much, that he scrupled not to be guilty of the meanest\npractices to gratify that sordid appetite; that, in consequence of this\ndisposition, he had prostituted his honour in betraying my inexperience,\nand in undermining the interest of another author of established\nreputation, who had also offered a tragedy to the stage, which he\nthought would interfere with the success of the comedy he had bought,\nand determined to bring on at all events.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was shocked at the description of such a monster, which I could\nnot believe existed in the world, bad as it is, and argued against the\nasseverations of my friend, by demonstrating the bad policy of such\nbehaviour, which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author;\nand the small temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozet's figure and success\ncould have to consult his interest in such a grovelling manner,\nwhich must create contempt and abhorrence of him in his patrons, and\neffectually deprive him of the countenance and protection he now enjoys\nin such an eminent degree. He pretended to laugh at my simplicity, and\nasked, if I knew for which of his virtues he was so much caressed by\nthe people of fashion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the qualities of his\nheart, that this little parasite is invited to the tables of dukes and\nlords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment. His avarice\nthey see not, his ingratitude they feel not, his hypocrisy accommodates\nitself to their humours, and is of consequence pleasing; but he is\nchiefly courted for his buffoonery, and will be admitted into the\nchoicest parties of quality for his talent of mimicking Punch and his\nwife Joan, when a poet of the most excellent genius is not able to\nattract the least regard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d God forbid, Mr. Random, that I should credit\nassertions that degrade the dignity of our superiors so much, and\nrepresent the poor man as the most abject of all beings! No, I looked\nupon them as the hyperboles of passion; and though that comedy of which\nhe spoke did actually appear, I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr.\nMarmozet, who, I am told, is as much as ever in favour with the earl;\na circumstance that, surely, could not be, unless he had vindicated his\ncharacter to the satisfaction of his lordship. Pray forgive this long\ndigression, and give me the hearing a little longer; for, thank heaven!\nI am now near the goal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBaffled in all my attempts, I despaired of seeing my play acted; and\nbethought myself of choosing some employment that might afford a sure,\nthough mean subsistence; but my landlord, to whom I was by this time\nconsiderably indebted, and who had laid his account with having his\nmoney paid all in a heap from the profits of my third night, could not\nbrook his disappointment, therefore made another effort in my behalf,\nand, by dint of interest, procured a message from a lady of fashion\nto Mr. Brayer, who had always professed a great veneration for her,\ndesiring that he would set up my play forthwith, and assuring him\nthat she and all her friends would support it in the performance. To\nstrengthen my interest, she engaged his best actors in my cause; and, in\nshort, exerted herself so much, that it was again received, and my hopes\nbegan to revive. But Mr. Brayer, honest man, was so much engrossed by\nbusiness of vast consequence, though to appearance he had nothing at\nall to do, that he could not find time to read it until the season was\npretty far advanced; and read it he must, for notwithstanding his having\nperused it before, his memory did not retain one circumstance of the\nmatter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt length he favoured it with his attention, and having proposed\ncertain alterations, sent his duty to the lady who patronised it, and\npromised, on his honour, to bring it on next winter, provided these\nalterations should be made, and the copy delivered to him before the\nend of April. With an aching heart, I submitted to these conditions,\nand performed them accordingly: but fortune owed me another unforeseen\nmortification; Mr. Marmozet, during the summer, became joint patentee\nwith Mr. Brayer, so that when I claimed performance of articles, I was\ntold he could do nothing without the consent of his partner, who was\npre-engaged to another author.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy condition was rendered desperate by the death of my good friend and\nlandlord, whose executors obtained a judgment against my effects, which\nthey seized, turned me out into the streets naked, friendless, and\nforlorn: there I was arrested at the suit of my tailor, and thrown into\nthe prison, where I have made shift to live these five weeks on the\nbounty of my fellow prisoners, who, I hope, are not the worse for the\ninstruction and good offices by which I manifest my gratitude; but in\nspite of all their charitable endeavours, my life was scarce tolerable,\nuntil your uncommon benevolence enabled me to enjoy it with comfort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\nI am seized with a deep Melancholy, and become a Sloven--am relieved by\nmy Uncle--he prevails upon me to engage with his Owners, as a Surgeon\nof the Ship which he commands--he makes me a considerable\nPresent--entertain Strap as his steward--I take leave of my Friends, and\ngo on Board--the Ship arrives in the Downs\n\nI shall not make any reflection on this story, in the course of which\nthe reader must perceive how egregiously the simplicity and milky\ndisposition of this worthy man had been duped and abused by a set of\nscoundrels, who were so habituated to falsehood and equivocation, that I\nverily believed they would have found the utmost difficulty in uttering\none syllable of truth, though their lives had depended upon their\nsincerity. Notwithstanding all I had suffered from the knavery\nand selfishness of mankind, I was amazed and incensed by the base\nindifference which suffered such uncommon merit as he possessed to\nlanguish in obscurity, and struggle with all the miseries of a loathsome\ngaol; and should have blessed the occasion that secluded me from such\na perfidious world, had not the remembrance of my amiable Narcissa\npreserved my attachment to a society of which she constituted a part.\nThe picture of that lovely creature was the constant companion of\nmy solitude. How often did I contemplate the resemblance of those\nenchanting features that first captivated my heart! how often did I weep\nover those endearing scenes which her image recalled! and how often did\nI curse my perfidious fate for having robbed me of the fair original!\nIn vain did my imagination flatter me with schemes of future happiness:\nsurly reason always interposed, and in a moment overthrew the\nunsubstantial fabric, by chastising the extravagance of my hope, and\nrepresenting my unhappy situation in the right point of view. In vain\ndid I fly for refuge to the amusements of the place, and engage in the\nparties of Jackson at cards, billiards, nine-pins, and fives; a train\nof melancholy thoughts took possession of my soul, which even the\nconversation of Melopoyn could not divert. I ordered Strap to inquire\nevery day at Banter's lodgings, in expectation of hearing again from my\ncharmer; and my disappointment considerably, augmented my chagrin. My\naffectionate valet was infected with my sorrow, and often sat with me\nwhole hours without speaking, uttering sigh for sigh, and shedding tear\nfor tear. This fellowship increased our distemper; he became incapable\nof business, and was discarded by his master; while I, seeing my money\nmelt away without any certainty of deliverance, and, in short, all\nmy hopes frustrated, grew negligent of life, lost all appetite, and\ndegenerated into such a sloven that during the space of three months\nI was neither washed, shifted, nor shaved; so that my face, rendered\nmeagre with abstinence, was obscured with dirt, and overshadowed with\nhair, and my whole appearance squalid and even frightful; when, one day,\nStrap brought me notice, that there was a man below who wanted to speak\nwith me. Roused at this intelligence, and in full hopes of receiving a\nletter from the dear object of my love, I ran downstairs with the utmost\nprecipitation. And found to my infinite surprise my generous uncle, Mr.\nBowling! Transported at the sight, I sprang forward to embrace him.\nUpon which he started aside with great agility, drew his hanger, and put\nhimself upon his guard, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAvast, brother, avast! Sheer off. Yo\nho! you turnkey, why don't you keep a better look out? Here's one of\nyour crazy prisoners broke from his lashings, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could not\nhelp laughing heartily at his mistake; but this I soon rectified by my\nvoice, which he instantly recollected, and shook me by the hand with\ngreat affection, testifying his concern at seeing me in such a miserable\ncondition.\n\nI conducted him to my apartment, where, in presence of Strap, whom I\nintroduced to him as one of my best friends, he gave me to understand,\nthat he was just arrived from the Coast Of Guinea, after having made a\npretty successful voyage, in which he had acted as mate, until the ship\nwas attacked by a French privateer, that the captain being killed during\nthe engagement, he had taken the command, and was so fortunate as to\nsink the enemy; after which exploit he fell in with a merchant ship from\nMartinico, laden with sugar, indigo and some silver and by virtue of his\nletter of marque, attacked, took, and carried her safe into Kinsale in\nIreland, where she was condemned as a lawful prize; by which means he\nhad not only got a pretty sum of money, but also acquired the favour of\nhis owners, who had already conferred upon him the command of a large\nship, mounted with twenty nine-pounders, ready to sail upon a very\nadvantageous voyage, which he was not at liberty to discover. And he\nassured me that it was with the greatest difficulty he found me, in\nconsequence of a direction left for him at his lodgings at Wapping.\n\nI was rejoiced beyond measure at this account of his good fortune; and,\nat his desire, recounted all the adventures that had happened to\nme since we parted. When he understood the particulars of Strap's\nattachment to me, he squeezed his hand very cordially, and promised to\nmake a man of him; then, giving me ten guineas for my present occasion,\ntook a direction for the tailor who arrested me, and went away in order\nto discharge the debt, telling me at parting, that he would soon fetch\nup all my leeway with a wet sail.\n\nI was utterly confounded at this sudden transition, which affected me\nmore than any reverse I had formerly felt; and a crowd of incoherent\nideas rushed so impetuously upon my imagination, that my reason could\nneither separate nor connect them; when Strap, whose joy had manifested\nitself in a thousand fool-cries, came into my room with his shaving\nutensils, and without any previous intimation, began to lather my beard,\nwhistling with great emotion all the while. I started from my reverie,\nand, being too well acquainted with Strap to trust myself in his hands\nwhile he was under such agitation, desired to be excused, sent for\nanother barber, and suffered myself to be trimmed. Having performed\nthe ceremony of ablution, I shifted, and dressing in my gayest apparel,\nwaited for the return of my uncle, who was agreeably surprised at my\nsudden transformation.\n\nThis beneficent kinsman had satisfied my creditor, and obtained an order\nfor my discharge, so that I was no longer a prisoner; but, as I had some\nreluctance to part with my friends and fellows in distress, I prevailed\nupon Mr. Bowling to favour us with his company, and invited Mr. Melopoyn\nand Jackson to spend the evening at my apartment, where I regaled them\nwith a supper, good wine, and the news of my release, on which they\nheartily congratulated me, notwithstanding the loss of my company,\nwhich, they were pleased to say, they should severely feel. As for\nJackson, his misfortune made so little impression on himself, and he was\naltogether so loose, indifferent, and indiscreet, that I could scarce\npity his situation: but I had conceived a veneration and friendship\nfor the poet, who was, in all respects, an object much more worthy\nof compassion and regard. When our guests withdrew, and my uncle had\nretired, with an intention of visiting me next morning, I made up a\nbundle of some linen and other necessaries; and, bidding Strap carry\nthem to Mr. Melopoyn's lodgings, went thither myself, and pressed it\nupon his acceptance, with five guineas, which, with much difficulty, he\nreceived, assuring me at the same time, that he should never have it in\nhis power to make satisfaction. I then asked if I could serve him in any\nother way; to which he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have already done too much;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and,\nunable to contain the emotions of his soul any longer, burst into tears,\nand wept aloud. Moved at this spectacle, I left him to his repose, and,\nwhen my uncle returned in the morning, represented his character in\nsuch a favourable light, that the honest seaman was affected with his\ndistress, and determined to follow my example, in presenting him with\nfive pieces more; upon which, that I might save him some confusion, I\nadvised Mr. Bowling to inclose it in a letter to be delivered by Strap,\nafter we should be gone.\n\nThis was accordingly done. I took a formal leave of all my acquaintance\nin the gaol; and, just as I was about to step into a hackney coach at\nthe gate, Jackson calling me, I returned, and he asked me in a whisper,\nif I could lend him a shilling! His demand being so moderate, and in all\nlikelihood the last he would make upon me, I slipped a guinea into his\nhand, which he no sooner perceived, than he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Jesus, a guinea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n then laying hold of a button of my coat, broke out into laughter; and\nwhen his immoderate fit of convulsion was ended, told me I was an\nhonest fellow, and let me go. The coachman was ordered to drive to Mr.\nBowling's lodgings, where, when we arrived, he entered into a serious\ndiscourse with me, on the subject of my situation, and proposed that I\nshould sail with him in quality of his surgeon; in which case he\nwould put me in a method of getting a fortune in a few years by my own\nindustry; and assured me, that I might expect to inherit all that he\nshould die possessed of, provided I should survive him. Though I was\npenetrated with a sense of his generosity, l was startled at a proposal\nthat offered violence to my love, and signified my sentiments on that\nhead, which he did not seem to relish; but observed that love was the\nfruit of idleness, that when once I should be employed in business, and\nmy mind engaged in making money, I should be no more troubled with\nthese silly notions, which none but your fair-weathered Jacks, who have\nnothing but their pleasure to mind, ought to entertain. I was piqued at\nthis insinuation, which I looked upon as a reproach, and, without giving\nmyself time to deliberate, accepted his offer. He was overjoyed at\nmy compliance, carried me immediately to his chief owner, with whom a\nbargain was struck; so that then I could not retract with honour, had I\nbeen ever so much averse to the agreement. That I might not have time to\ncool, he bade me draw out a list of medicines for a complement of five\nhundred men, adapted to the distempers of hot climates and sufficient\nfor a voyage of eighteen months; and carry it to a certain wholesale\napothecary, who would also provide me in two well-qualified mates.\nWhile I was thus employed Strap came in, and looked very blank, when\nhe understood my resolution: however, after a pause of some minutes,\nhe insisted upon going along with me; and at my desire was made ship's\nsteward by Captain Bowling, who promised to be at the expense of fitting\nhim out, and to lend him two hundred pounds to purchase an adventure.\n\nWhen I had delivered my list of medicines, chosen a couple of my own\ncountrymen for mates, and bespoke a set of chirurgical instruments,\nmy uncle told me, that by his last voyage he had cleared almost three\nthousand pounds, one-third of which he would immediately make over and\nput into my hands; that he would procure for me credit to the value of\nas much wore in such goods as would turn to best account in the country\nto which we were bound; and that, although he looked upon my interest\nas his own, he would keep the remaining part of his fortune in his own\ndisposal, with a view of preserving his independence, and the power\nof punishing me, in case I should not make a good use of what he had\nalready bestowed.\n\nWithout troubling the reader with an account of the effect which this\nsurprising generosity had upon my mind, I shall only say, that his\npromises were instantly performed, and an invoice of merchandise proper\nfor the voyage presented to me, that I might purchase the goods,\nand ship them with all expedition. In the midst of this hurry, the\nremembrance of my charming Narcissa often interposed, and made me the\nmost miserable of all mortals. I was distracted with the thought of\nbeing torn from her, perhaps for ever; and though the hope of seeing her\nagain might have supported me under the torments of separation, I could\nnot reflect upon the anguish she must feel at parting with me, and the\nincessant sorrows to which her tender bosom would be exposed during\nmy absence, without being pierced with the deepest affliction! As my\nimagination was daily and nightly upon the rack to invent some method\nof mitigating this cruel stroke, or at least of acquitting my love and\nhonour in the opinion of this gentle creature, I at length stumbled upon\nan expedient, with which the reader will be made acquainted in due\ntime; and, in consequence of my determination, became less uneasy and\ndisturbed.\n\nMy business being finished, and the ship ready to sail, I resolved to\nmake my last appearance among my acquaintance at the other end of the\ntown, where I had not been since my imprisonment; and as I had, by the\nadvice of my uncle, taken off some very rich clothes for sale, I put\non the gayest suit in my possession, and went in a chair to the\ncoffee-house I used to frequent, where I found my friend Banter so\nconfounded at the magnificence of my dress, that, when I made up to him,\nhe gazed at me with a look of astonishment, without being able, for\nsome minutes, to open his lips; then pulling me aside by the sleeve, and\nfixing his eyes on mine, accosted me thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRandom, where the devil have\nyou been! eh? What is the meaning of all this finery? Oho! I understand\nyou. You are just arrived from the country! what, the roads are good,\neh? Well, Random, you are a bold fellow, and a lucky fellow! but take\ncare, the pitcher goes often to the well, but is broke at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, he pointed to his collar; by which gesture, and the broken\nhints he had ejaculated, I found he suspected me of having robbed on\nthe highway; and I laughed very heartily at his supposition. Without\nexplaining myself any further, I told him he was mistaken in his\nconjecture; that I had been for some time past with the relation of whom\nhe had frequently heard me speak; and that, as I should set out next\nday upon my travels, I had come to take my leave of my friends, and to\nreceive of him the money he had borrowed from me, which, now that I\nwas going abroad, I should certainly have occasion for. He was a little\ndisconcerted at this demand; but, recollecting himself in a moment,\nswore in an affected passion, that I had used him extremely ill, and he\nwould never forgive me for having, by this short warning, put it out of\nhis power to free himself of an obligation he could no longer bear. I\ncould not help smiling at this pretended delicacy, which I commended\nhighly, telling him he needed not to be uneasy on that score, for I\nwould give him a direction to a merchant in the city, with whom I would\nleave a discharge on the sum, to be delivered upon payment. He professed\nmuch joy at this expedient, and with great eagerness asked the person's\nname and place of abode, which he forthwith wrote in his pocket-book,\nassuring me, that he should not be long in my debt. This affair, which I\nknew he should never after think of, being settled to his satisfaction,\nI sent cards to all my friends, desiring the favour of their company at\na tavern in the evening, when they honoured my invitation, and I had\nthe pleasure of treating them in a very elegant manner, at which they\nexpressed equal admiration as applause. Having enjoyed ourselves till\nmidnight, I took my leave of them, and was well nigh stifled with\ncaresses: next day, I set out with Strap in a postchaise for Gravesend,\nwhere we went on board; and the wind serving, weighed anchor in less\nthan twelve hours. Without meeting with any accident, we reached the\nDowns, where we were obliged to come to an anchor, and wait for an\neasterly wind to carry us out of the Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\nI set out for Sussex--consult Mrs. Sagely--achieve an Interview with\nNarcissa--return to the Ship--we get clear of the Channel--I learn our\nDestination--we are chased by a large Ship--the company are dismayed,\nand encouraged by the Captain's speech--our pursuer happens to be an\nEnglish Man of War--we arrive at the Coast of Guinea, purchase four\nhundred Negroes--sail for Paraguay, get safe into the River of Plate,\nand sell our Cargo to great Advantage\n\nIt was now I put in execution the scheme I had projected at London; and\nasking leave of the captain for Strap and me to stay on shore till the\nwind should become favourable, my request was granted, because he had\norders to remain in the Downs until he should receive some dispatches\nfrom London, which he did not expect in less than a week. Having\nimparted my resolution to my trusty valet, who (though he endeavoured\nto dissuade me from such a rash undertaking) would not quit me in the\nenterprise, I hired horses, and set out immediately for that part of\nSussex where my charmer was confined, which was not above thirty miles\ndistant from Deal, where we mounted. As I was perfectly well acquainted\nwith the extent of the squire's estate and influence, I halted within\nfive miles of his house, where we remained till the twilight, at which\ntime we set forward, and, by the favour of a dark night, reached a copse\nabout half-a-mile from the village where Mrs. Sagely lived. Here we\nleft our horses tied to a tree, and went directly to the house of my\nold benefactress, Strap trembling all the way, and venting ejaculatory\npetitions to heaven for our safety. Her habitation being quite solitary,\nwe arrived at the door without being observed, when I ordered my\ncompanion to enter by himself; and, in case there should be company with\nher, deliver a letter which I had writ for that purpose, and say that a\nfriend of hers in London, understanding that he intended to travel this\nroad, had committed it to his care. He rapped at the door, to which\nthe good old matron coming, told him that, being a lone woman, he must\nexcuse her, if she did not open it, until he had declared his name and\nbusiness. He answered, that his name was unknown to her, and that\nhis business was to deliver a letter, which (to free her from all\napprehension) he would convey to her through the space between the door\nand threshold. This he instantly performed: and she no sooner read the\ncontents, which specified my being present, than she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the\nperson who wrote this letter be at hand, let him speak, that I may be\nassured by his voice whether or not I may safely admit him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I forthwith\napplied my mouth to the keyhole, and pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear mother, you need\nnot be afraid, it is I, so much indebted to your goodness, who now\ncrave admittance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She knew my voice, and opening the door immediately,\nreceived me with a truly maternal affection, manifesting, by the tears\nshe let fall, her concern lest I should be discovered, for she had been\ninformed of everything that had happened between Narcissa and me from\nthe dear captive's own mouth. When I explained the motive of my journey,\nwhich was no other than a desire of seeing the object of my love before\nI should quit the kingdom, that I might in person convince her of the\nnecessity I was under to leave her, reconcile her to that event, by\ndescribing the advantages that in all probability would attend it,\nrepeat my vows of eternal constancy, and enjoy the melancholy pleasure\nof a tender embrace at parting. I say, when I had thus signified my\nintention, Mrs. Sagely told me, that Narcissa, upon her return from\nBath, had been so strictly watched that nobody but one or two of the\nservants devoted to her brother, was admitted to her presence, that\nafterwards she had been a little enlarged, and was permitted to see\ncompany; during which indulgence, she had been several times at the\ncottage; but of late she had been betrayed by one of the servants, who\ndiscovered to the squire, that he had once carried a letter from her to\nthe post-house directed to me; upon which information she was now more\nconfined than ever, and that I could have no chance of seeing her,\nunless I would run the risk of getting into the garden, where she and\nher maid were every day allowed to take the air, and lie hid until I\nshould have an opportunity of speaking to them--an adventure attended\nwith such danger, that no man in his right wits would attempt it. This\nenterprise, hazardous as it was, I resolved to perform, in spite of\nall the arguments of Mrs. Sagely, who reasoned, chid, and entreated by\nturns; and the tears and prayers of Strap, who conjured me on his knees,\nto have more regard to myself as well as to him, than to attempt my\nown destruction in such a precipitate manner. I was deaf to but the\nsuggestions of my love; and ordering him to return immediately with the\nhorses to the inn from whence we set out, and wait for my coming in that\nplace, he at first peremptorily refused to leave me, until I persuaded\nhim, that if our horses should remain where they were till daylight,\nthey would certainly be discovered, and the whole country alarmed. On\nthis consideration, he took his leave in a sorrowful plight, kissed my\nhand, and, weeping, cried \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod knows if ever I shall see you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n My kind landlady, finding me obstinate, gave me her best advice how to\nbehave in the execution of my project: and after having persuaded me to\ntake a little refreshment, accommodated me with a bed, and left me to my\nrepose. Early in the morning I arose, and armed with a couple of loaded\npistols and a hanger, went to the back part of the squire's garden,\nclimbed over the wall, and, according to Mrs. Sagely's direction,\nconcealed myself in a thicket, hard by an alcove that terminated a walk\nat a good distance from the house, which (I was told) my mistress mostly\nfrequented. Here I absconded from five o'clock in the morning to six in\nthe evening, without seeing a human creature; at last I perceived two\nwomen approaching, whom, by my throbbing heart, I soon recognised to be\nthe adorable Narcissa and Miss Williams. I felt the strongest agitation\nof soul at the sight; and guessing, that they would repose themselves in\nthe alcove, stopped into it unperceived, and hid upon the stone table a\npicture of myself in miniature, for which I had sat in London, purposing\nto leave it with Narcissa before I should go abroad. I exposed it in\nthis manner, as an introduction to my own appearance, which, without\nsome previous intimation, I was afraid might have an unlucky effect\nupon the delicate nerves of my fair enslaver; and then withdrew into\nthe thicket, where I could hear their discourse, and suit myself to the\ncircumstance of the occasion. As they advanced, I observed an air of\nmelancholy in the countenance of Narcissa, blended with such unspeakable\nsweetness, that I could scarce refrain from flying into her arms, and\nkissing away the pearly drop that stood collected in each bewitching\neye. According to my expectation, she entered the alcove, and perceiving\nsomething on the table, took it up. No sooner did she cast her eye upon\nthe features, than, startled at the resemblance, she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood\nGod!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the roses instantly vanished from her cheeks. Her confidante,\nalarmed at this exclamation, looked at the picture; and, struck with the\nlikeness, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus! the very features of Mr. Random!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Narcissa,\nhaving recollected herself a little, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever angel brought\nit hither as a comfort to me in my affliction, I am thankful for the\nbenefit, and will preserve it as the dearest object of my care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, she kissed it with surprising ardour, shed a flood of tears, and\nthen deposited the lifeless image in her lovely bosom. Transported at\nthese symptoms of her unaltered affection, I was about to throw myself\nat her feet, when Miss Williams, whose reflection was less engaged than\nthat of her mistress, observed that the picture could not transport\nitself hither, and that she could not help thinking I was not far off.\nThe gentle Narcissa, starting at this conjecture, answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven\nforbid! for although nothing in the universe could yield me satisfaction\nequal to that of his presence for one poor moment, in a proper place,\nI would rather forfeit his company--almost for ever, than see him here,\nwhere his life would be exposed to so much danger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could no longer\nrestrain the impulse of my passion, but, breaking from my concealment,\nstood before her, when she uttered a fearful shriek, and fainted in the\narms of her companion. I flew towards the treasure of my soul, clasped\nher in my embrace, and with the warmth of my kisses, brought her again\nto life. Oh that I were endowed with the expression of a Raphael, the\ngraces of a Guido, the magic touches of a Titian, that I might represent\nthe fond concern, the chastened rapture and ingenuous blush, that\nmingled on her beauteous face, when she opened her eyes upon me,\nand pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO heavens! is it you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I am afraid I have already\nencroached upon the reader's patience with the particulars of\nthis amour, of which (I own) I cannot help being impertinently\ncircumstantial. I shall therefore omit the less material passages of\nthis interview, during which I convinced her reason, though I could not\nappease the sad presages of her love, with regard to the long voyage\nand dangers I must undergo. When we had spent an hour (which was all she\ncould spare from the barbarity of her brother's vigilance) in lamenting\nover our hard fate, and in repeating our reciprocal vows, Miss Williams\nreminded us of the necessity there was for our immediate parting; and,\nsure, lovers never parted with such sorrow and reluctance as we. But\nbecause my words are incapable of doing justice to this affecting\ncircumstance, I am obliged to draw a veil over it, and observe, that I\nreturned in the dark to the house of Mrs. Sagely, who was overjoyed\nto hear of my success, and opposed the tumults of my grief with\nsuch strength of reason, that my mind regained, in some measure, its\ntranquillity; and that very night, after having forced upon the good\ngentlewoman a purse of twenty guineas, as a token of my gratitude and\nesteem, I took my leave of her, and set out on foot for the inn, where\nmy arrival freed honest Strap from the horrors of unutterable dread.\n\nWe took horse immediately, and alighted early next morning at Deal,\nwhere I found my uncle in great concern on account of my absence,\nbecause he had received his despatches, and must have weighed with the\nfirst fair wind, whether I had been on board or not. Next day, a brisk\neasterly gale springing up, we set sail, and in eight and forty hours\ngot clear of the Channel.\n\nWhen we were about two hundred leagues to westward of the Land's End,\nthe captain, taking me apart into the cabin, told me that, now he\nwas permitted by his instructions, he would disclose the intent and\ndestination of our voyage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich has been fitted\nout at a great expense, is bound for the coast of Guinea, where we shall\nexchange part of our cargo for slaves and gold dust, from whence we will\ntransport our negroes to Buenos Ayres in New Spain, where (by virtue\nof passports, obtained from our own court, and that of Madrid) we will\ndispose of them and the goods that remain on board for silver, by means\nof our supercargo, who is perfectly well acquainted with the coast,\nthe lingo, and inhabitants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Being thus let into the secret of our\nexpedition, I borrowed of the supercargo a Spanish grammar, dictionary,\nand some other books of the same language, which I studied with such\napplication that, before we arrived in New Spain, I could maintain\na conversation with him in that tongue. Being arrived in the warm\nlatitudes, I ordered (with the captain's consent) the whole ship's\ncompany to be blooded and purged, myself undergoing the same\nevacuation, in order to prevent those dangerous fevers to which northern\nconstitutions are subject in hot climates; and I have reason to believe,\nthat this precaution was not unserviceable, for we lost but one sailor\nduring our whole passage to the coast.\n\nOne day, when we had been about five weeks at sea, we descried to\nwindward a large ship bearing down upon us with all the sail she could\ncarry. Upon which, my uncle ordered the studding-sails to be hoisted\nand the ship to be cleared for engaging; but, finding that (to use the\nseaman's phrase) we were very much wronged by the ship which had us in\nchase, and by this time had hoisted French colours, he commanded the\nstudding-sails to be taken in, the courses to be clowed up, the main\ntopsail to be backed, the tompions to be taken out of the guns, and\nevery man to repair to his quarters. While every body was busied in the\nperformance of these orders, Strap came upon the quarter-deck, trembling\nand looking aghast, and, with a voice half-suppressed by fear, asked if\nI thought we were a match for the vessel in pursuit of us. Observing\nhis consternation, I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! are you afraid, Strap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfraid! (he\nreplied); n-n-no; what should I be afraid of? I thank God I have a clear\nconscience; but I believe it will be a bloody battle, and I wish you\nmay not have occasion for another hand to assist you in the cockpit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nimmediately perceived his drift, and making the captain acquainted with\nhis situation, desired he might be stationed below with me and my\nmates. My uncle, incensed at his pusillanimity, bade me send him down\ninstantly, that his fear might not infect the ship's company; whereupon\nI told the poor steward that I had begged him for my assistant, and\ndesired him to go down and help my mates to get ready the instruments\nand dressings. Notwithstanding the satisfaction he must have felt at\nthose tidings, he affected a shyness of quitting the upper deck; and\nsaid, he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do his duty above\nboard; for he believed himself as well prepared for death as any man in\nthe ship, no disparagement to me or the captain. I was disgusted at this\naffectation; and, in order to punish his hypocrisy, assured him he might\ntake his choice, either of going down to the cockpit with me, or staying\nupon deck during the engagement. Alarmed at this indifference, he\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, to oblige you, I'll go down, but remember it is more\nfor your sake than my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he disappeared in a twinkling,\nwithout waiting for an answer.\n\nBy this time, we could observe two tier of guns in the ship which\npursued us, and which was now but two short miles astern. This discovery\nhad an evident effect upon the sailors, who did not scruple to say, that\nwe should be torn to pieces, and blown out of the water, and that, if\nin case any of them should lose their precious limbs, they must go a\nbegging for life, for there was no provision made by the merchants\nfor those poor souls who are maimed in their service. The captain,\nunderstanding this, ordered the crew abaft, and spoke to them thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nlads, I am told you hang an a--se. I have gone to sea thirty years, a\nman and a boy, and never saw English sailors afraid before. Mayhap you\nmay think I want to expose you for the lucre of gain. Whosoever thinks\nso, thinks a d--ned lie, for my whole cargo is insured; so that, in case\nI should be taken, my loss would not be great. The enemy is stronger\nthan we, to be sure. What then? have we not a chance for carrying away\none of her masts, and so get clear of her? If we find her too hard for\nus, 'tis but striking at last. If any man is hurt in the engagement,\nI promise on the word of an honest seaman, to make him a recompense\naccording to his loss. So now, you that are lazy, lubberly, cowardly\ndogs, get away and skulk in the hold and bread-room; and you, that are\njolly boys, stand by me, and let us give one broadside for the honour\nof Old England.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This eloquent harangue was so well adapted to the\ndisposition of his hearers, that one and all of them, pulling off their\nhats, waved them over their heads, and saluted him with three cheers;\nupon which he sent his boy for two large case-bottles of brandy: having\ntreated every man with a dram, they repaired to their quarters, and\nwaited impatiently for the word of command. I must do my uncle the\njustice to say, that in the whole of his disposition, he behaved with\nthe utmost intrepidity, conduct, and deliberation. The enemy being very\nnear, he ordered me to my station, and was just going to give the word\nfor hoisting the colours, and firing, when the supposed Frenchman hauled\ndown his white pennant, jack, and ensign, hoisted English ones, and\nfired a gun a-head of us. This was a joyful event to Captain Bowling,\nwho immediately showed his colours, and fired a gun to leeward; upon\nwhich the other ship ran alongside of us, hailed him, and, giving him\nto know that she was an English man-of-war of forty guns, ordered him\nto hoist out his boat and come on board. This command he obeyed with the\nmore alacrity, because, upon inquiry, he found that she was commanded\nby an old messmate of his, who was overjoyed to see him, detained him to\ndinner, and sent his barge for the supercargo and me, who were very much\ncaressed on his account. As this commander was destined to cruise upon\nthe French in the latitude of Martinico, his stem and quarters were\nadorned with white fleurs-de-lis, and the whole shell of the ship so\nmuch disguised for a decoy to the enemy, that it was no wonder my uncle\ndid not know her, although he had sailed on board of her many years.\nWe kept company with her four days, during which time the captains were\nnever asunder, and then parted, our course lying different from hers.\n\nIn less than fortnight after our separation, we made the land of Guinea,\nnear the mouth of the River Gambia; and trading along the coast as far\nto the southward of the Line as Angola and Bengula, in less than six\nmonths disposed of the greatest part of our cargo, and purchased four\nhundred negroes, my adventure having been laid out in gold dust.\n\nOur complement being made up, we took our departure from Cape Negroe,\nand arrived in the Rio de la Plata in six weeks, having met with nothing\nremarkable in our voyage, except an epidemic fever, not unlike the jail\ndistemper, which broke out among our slaves and carried off a good many\nof the ship's company; among whom I lost one of my mates, and poor Strap\nhad well nigh given up the ghost. Having produced our passport to the\nSpanish governor, we were received with great courtesy, sold our slaves\nin a very few days, and could have put off five times the number at\nour own price; though we were obliged to smuggle the rest of our\nmerchandise, consisting of European bale-goods, which however we made\nshift to dispose of at a great advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nI am invited to the Villa of a Spanish Don, where we went with an\nEnglish Gentleman, and make a very interesting discovery--we leave\nBuenos Ayres, and arrive at Jamaica\n\nOur ship being freed from the disagreeable lading of negroes, to whom,\nindeed, I had been a miserable slave since our leaving the coast of\nGuinea, I began to enjoy myself, and breathe with pleasure the pure\nair of Paraguay, this part of which is reckoned the Montpelier of South\nAmerica, and has obtained, on account of its climate, the name of Buenos\nAyres. It was in this delicious place that I gave myself entirely up to\nthe thoughts of my dear Narcissa, whose image still kept possession\nof my breast, and whose charms, enhanced by absence, appeared to my\nimagination, if possible, more engaging than ever! I calculated the\nprofits of my voyage, which even exceeded my expectation; resolved to\npurchase sinecure upon my arrival in England, and if I should find the\nsquire as averse to me as ever, marry his sister by stealth; and in case\nour family should increase, rely on the generosity of my uncle, who was\nby this time worth a considerable sum.\n\nWhile I amused myself with these agreeable projects, and the\ntransporting thoughts of enjoying Narcissa, we were very much caressed\nby the Spanish gentlemen, who frequently formed parties of pleasure\nfor our entertainment, in which we made excursions a good way into the\ncountry. Among those who signalised themselves by their civility to us,\nwas one Don Antonio de Ribera, a very polite young gentleman, with whom\nI had contracted an intimate friendship, who invited us one day to his\ncountry house, and, as a further inducement to our compliance, promised\nto procure for us the company of an English Signor, who had been settled\nin those parts many years and acquired the love and esteem of the whole\nprovince by his affability, good sense, and honourable behaviour.\n\nWe accepted his invitation, and set out for his villa, where we had not\nbeen longer than an hour, when the person arrived in whose favour I had\nbeen so much prepossessed. He was a tall man, remarkably well shaped, of\na fine mien and appearance, commanding respect, and seemed to be turned\nof forty; the features of his face were saddened with a reserve and\ngravity, which in other countries would have been thought the effect of\nmelancholy; but here appeared to have been contracted by his commerce\nwith the Spaniards, who are remarkable for that severity of countenance.\nUnderstanding from Don Antonio that we were his countrymen, he saluted\nus all round very complacently, and fixing his eyes attentively on me,\nuttered a deep sigh. I had been struck with a profound veneration for\nhim at his first coming into the room; and no sooner observed this\nexpression of his sorrow, directed, as it were, in a particular manner\nto me, that my heart took part in his grief; I sympathised involuntarily\nand sighed in my turn. Having asked leave of our entertainer, he\naccosted us in English, professed his satisfaction at seeing so many of\nhis countrymen in such a remote place, and asked the captain, who went\nby the name of Signor Thoma, from what part of Britain he had sailed\nand whither he was bound. My uncle told him that we had sailed from the\nRiver Thames, and were bound for the same plane by the way of Jamaica,\nwhere we intended to take in a lading of sugar.\n\nHaving satisfied himself in these and other particulars about the state\nof the war, he gave us to understand, that he had a longing desire\nto revisit his native country, in consequence of which he had already\ntransmitted to Europe the greatest part of his fortune in neutral\nbottoms, and would willingly embark the rest of it with himself in our\nship, provided the captain had no objection to such a passenger. My\nuncle very prudently replied, that for his part he should be glad of his\ncompany, if he could procure the consent of the governor, without which\nhe durst not take him on board, whatever inclination he had to oblige\nhim. The gentleman approved of his discretion, and telling him that\nthere would be no difficulty in obtaining the connivance of the\ngovernor, who was his good friend, shifted the conversation to another\nsubject.\n\nI was overjoyed to hear his intention, and already interested myself so\nmuch in his favour that, had he been disappointed, I should have been\nvery unhappy. In the course of our entertainment, he eyed me with\nuncommon attachment, I felt a surprising attraction towards him; when\nhe spoke, I listened with attention and reverence; the dignity of his\ndeportment filled me with affection and awe; and, in short, the emotions\nof my soul, in presence of this stranger, were strong and unaccountable.\n\nHaving spent the best part of the day with us, he took his leave,\ntelling Captain Thoma, that he should hear from him in a short time. He\nwas no sooner gone than I asked a thousand questions about him of Don\nAntonio, who could give me no other satisfaction than that his name was\nDon Rodrigo, that he had lived fifteen or sixteen years in these parts,\nwas reputed rich, and supposed to have been unfortunate in his younger\nyears, because he was observed to nourish a pensive melancholy, even\nfrom the time of his first settlement among them; but that nobody had\nventured to inquire into the cause of his sorrow, in consideration of\nhis peace, which might suffer in the recapitulation of his misfortunes.\n\nI was seized with an irresistible desire of knowing the particulars of\nhis fate, and enjoyed not an hour of repose during the whole night,\nby reason of the eager conceptions that inspired me with regard to his\nstory, which I resolved (if possible) to learn. Next morning, while\nwe were at breakfast, three mules, richly caparisoned, arrived with a\nmessage from Don Rodrigo, desiring our company, and that of Don Antonio,\nat his house, which was situated about ten miles further up in the\ncountry. I was pleased with this invitation, in consequence of which\nwe mounted the mules which he had provided for us, and alighted at his\nhouse before noon. Here we were splendidly entertained by the generous\nstranger, who still seemed to show a particular regard for me, and after\ndinner made me a present of a ring, set with a beautiful amethyst, the\nproduction of that country, saying, at the same time, that he was once\nblessed with a son, who, had he lived, would have been nearly of my age.\nThis observation, delivered with a profound sigh, made my heart throb\nwith violence: a crowd of confused ideas rushed upon my imagination,\nwhich, while I endeavoured to unravel, my uncle perceived my absence of\nthought, and tapping me on the shoulder, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOons, are you asleep,\nRory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before I had time to reply, Don Rodrigo, with uncommon eagerness\nof voice and look, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, captain, what is the young\ngentleman's name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my uncle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis Roderick Random.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cGracious Powers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the stranger, starting up--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd his mother's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the captain, amazed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas called Charlotte\nBowling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cO bounteous Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Don Rodrigo, springing across\nthe table, and clasping me in his arms, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy son! my son! have I\nfound thee again? do I hold thee in my embrace, after having lost and\ndespaired of seeing thee so long?\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he fell upon my neck, and\nwept aloud with joy; while the power of nature operating strongly in my\nbreast. I was lost in rapture, and while he pressed me to his heart, let\nfall a shower of tears in his bosom. His utterance was choked up a\ngood while by the agitation of his soul; at length he broke out into\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMysterious Providence!--O my dear Charlotte, there yet remains a pledge\nof our love! and such a pledge!--so found! O infinite Goodness, let me\nadore thy all-wise decrees!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Having thus expressed himself, he kneeled\nupon the floor, lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven, and remained\nsome minutes in silent ecstacy of devotion. I put myself in the\nsame posture, adored the all-good Dispenser in a prayer of mental\nthanksgiving: and when his ejaculation was ended, did homage to my\nfather, and craved his paternal blessing. He hugged me again with\nunutterable fondness, and having implored the protection of Heaven upon\nmy head, raised me from the ground, and presented me as his son to the\ncompany, who wept in concert over this affecting scene. Among the rest,\nmy uncle did not fail to discover the goodness and joy of his heart.\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood, he blubbered with great tenderness,\nand wringing my father's hand, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrother Random, I'm rejoiced\nto see you--God be praised for this happy meeting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don Rodrigo,\nunderstanding that he was his brother-in-law, embraced him\naffectionately, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you my Charlotte's brother? Alas! unhappy\nCharlotte! but why should I repine? we shall meet again, never more to\npart! Brother, you are truly welcome. Dear son, I am transported with\nunspeakable joy! This day is a jubilee--my friends and servants shall\nshare my satisfaction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he dispatched messengers to the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, to\nannounce this event, and gave orders for a grand entertainment, I was\nso much affected with the tumults of passion, which assailed me on this\ngreat, sudden, and unexpected occasion, that I fell sick, fevered,\nand in less than three hours became quite delirious: so that the\npreparations were countermanded, and the joy of the family converted\ninto grief and despair. Physicians were instantly called, I was\nplentifully blooded in the foot, my lower extremities were bathed in a\ndecoction of salutiferous herbs: in ten hours after I was taken ill\nI enjoyed a critical sweat, and next day felt the remains of the\ndistemper, but an agreeable lassitude, which did not hinder me from\ngetting up. During the progress of this fever, which, from the term\nor its duration, is called ephemera, my father never once quitted my\nbedside, but administered the prescriptions of the physicians with the\nmost pious care; while Captain Bowling manifested his concern by the\nlike attendance. I no sooner found myself delivered from this disease,\nthan I bethought myself of my honest friend Strap; and resolving to make\nhim happy forthwith in the knowledge of my good fortune, told my\nfather in general, that I had been infinitely obliged to this faithful\nadherent, and begged he would indulge me so far as to send for him,\nwithout letting him know my happiness, until he could receive an account\nof it from my own mouth.\n\nMy request was instantly complied with, and a messenger with a spare\nmule despatched to the ship, carrying orders from the captain to\nthe mate, to send the steward by the bearer. My health being, in the\nmeantime, re-established, and my mind composed I began to relish this\nimportant turn of my fortune, in reflecting upon the advantages with\nwhich it must be attended; and, as the idea of my lovely Narcissa always\njoined itself to every scene of happiness I could imagine, I entertained\nmyself now with the prospect of possessing her in that distinguished\nsphere to which she was entitled by her birth and qualifications. Having\noften mentioned her name while I was deprived of my senses, my\nfather guessed that there was an intimate connection between us, and\ndiscovering the picture which hung in my bosom by ribbon, did not doubt\nthat it was the resemblance of my amiable mistress. In this belief he\nwas confirmed by my uncle, who told him that it was the picture of a\nyoung woman, to whom I was under promise of marriage. Alarmed at\nthis piece of information, Don Rodrigo took the first opportunity of\nquestioning me about the particulars of this affair, which when I\nhad candidly recounted, he approved of my passion, and promised to\ncontribute all in his power towards its success. Though I never doubted\nhis generosity, I was transported on this occasion, and throwing myself\nat his feet, told him, he had now completed my happiness, for, without\nthe possession of Narcissa I should be miserable among all the pleasures\nof life. He raised me with a smile of paternal fondness; said he knew\nwhat it was to be in love; and observed that, if he had been as tenderly\nbeloved by his father as I was by mine, he should not now perhaps have\ncause--here he was interrupted by a sigh, the tear rushed into his eye,\nsuppressed the dictates of his grief, and the time being opportune,\ndesired me to relate the passages of my life, which my uncle had\ntold him were manifold and surprising. I recounted the most material\ncircumstances of my fortune, to which he listened with wonder and\nattention, manifesting from time to time the different emotions which\nmy different situations may be supposed to have raised in a parent's\nbreast; and, when my detail was ended, blessed God for the adversity I\nhad undergone, which, he said, enlarged the understanding, improved the\nheart, steeled the constitution, and qualified a young man for all\nthe duties and enjoyments of life much better than any education which\naffluence could bestow.\n\nWhen I had thus satisfied his curiosity, I discovered an inclination to\nhear the particulars of his story, which he gratified by beginning with\nhis marriage, and proceeded to the day of his disappearing, as I have\nrelated in the first part of my memoirs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCareless of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand unable to live in a place where every object recalled the\nmemory of my dear Charlotte, whom I had lost through the barbarity of an\nunnatural parent, I took my leave of you, my child, then an infant, with\na heart full of unutterable woe, but little suspecting that my father's\nunkindness would have descended to my innocent orphan; and setting out\nalone at midnight for the nearest seaport, early next morning got on\nboard a ship, bound, as I had heard, for France; and, bargaining with\nthe master for my passage, bade a long adieu to my native country, and\nput to sea with the first fair wind. The place of our destination was\nGranville, but we had the misfortune to run upon a ridge of rocks near\nthe Island of Alderney, called the Caskets, where the sea running high,\nthe ship went to pieces, the boat sunk alongside, and every soul on\nboard perished, except myself, who, by the assistance of a grating got\nashore on the coast of Normandy. I went directly to Caen, where I was so\nlucky as to meet with a count, whom I had formerly known in my travels;\nwith this gentleman I set out for Paris, where I was recommended by him\nand other friends, as tutor to a young nobleman, whom I accompanied to\nthe court of Spain. There we remained a whole year, at the end of which\nmy pupil being recalled by his father, I quitted my office, and stayed\nbehind, by the advice of a certain Spanish grandee, who took me into his\nprotection, and introduced me to another nobleman, who was afterwards\ncreated viceroy of Peru. He insisted on my attending, him to his\ngovernment of the Indies, where, however, by reason of my religion,\nit was not in his power to make my fortune any other way than by\nencouraging me to trade, which I had not long prosecuted when my patron\ndied, and I found myself in the midst of strangers, without one friend\nto support or protect me. Urged by this consideration, I sold my\neffects, and removed to this country, the governor of which, having been\nappointed by the viceroy, was my intimate acquaintance. Here has heaven\nprospered my endeavours, during a residence of sixteen years, in which\nmy tranquillity was never invaded but by the remembrance of your mother,\nwhose death I have in secret mourned without ceasing, and the reflection\nof you, whose fate I could never learn notwithstanding all my\ninquiries by means of my friends in France, who, after the most strict\nexamination, could give me no other account than that you went abroad\nsix years ago, and was never after heard of. I could not rest satisfied\nwith this imperfect information, and, though my hope of finding you\nwas but languid, resolved to go in quest of you in person; for which\npurpose, I have remitted to Holland the value of twenty thousand pounds,\nand am in possession of fifteen thousand more, with which I intended\nto embark myself on board of Captain Bowling, before I discovered this\namazing stroke of Providence, which, you may be sure, has not altered my\nintention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMy father, having entertained us with this agreeable sketch of his life,\nwithdrew, in order to relieve Don Antonio, who, in his absence, had done\nthe honours of his house; and I was just dressed for my appearance among\nthe guests, when Strap arrived from the ship.\n\nHe no sooner entered the grand apartment in which I was, and saw the\nmagnificence of my apparel, than his speech was lost in amazement, and\nhe gaped in silence at the objects that surrounded him. I took him by\nthe hand, observed that I had sent for him to be a witness and sharer\nof my happiness, and told him I had found a father. At these words he\nstarted, and, after having continued some minutes with his mouth\nand eyes wide open, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!--odd, I know what! go thy ways, poor\nNarcissa, and go thy ways somebody else--well--Lord, what a thing is\nlove! God help us! are all our mad pranks and protestations come to\nthis? And have you fixed your habitation in this distant land? God\nprosper you--I find we must part at last--for I would not leave my poor\ncarcase so far from my native home, for all the wealth of the universe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n With these ejaculations, he began to sob and make wry faces; upon which\nI assured him of his mistake, both in regard to my staying in Paraguay,\nand informed him, as briefly as I could, of the great event that had\nhappened. Never was rapture more ludicrously expressed than in the\nbehaviour of this worthy creature, who cried, laughed, whistled, sung,\nand danced, all in a breath. His transport was scarce over, when my\nfather entered, who no sooner understood that this was Strap, than he\ntook him by the hand, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this the honest man who befriended you\nso much in your distress? You are welcome to my house, and I will soon\nput it in the power of my son to reward you for your good offices in\nhis behalf; in the meantime go with us and partake of the repast that is\nprovided.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Strap, wild as he was with joy, would by no means accept\nof the proffered honour, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid! I know my distance--your\nworship shall excuse me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Don Rodrigo, finding his modesty\ninvincible, recommended him to his major-domo, to be treated with the\nutmost respect; while he carried me in a large saloon, where I was\npresented to a numerous company, who loaded me with compliments and\ncaresses, and congratulated my father in terms not proper for me to\nrepeat.\n\nWithout specifying the particulars of our entertainment, let it\nsuffice to say, it was at the same time elegant and sumptuous, and\nthe rejoicings lasted two days; after which, Don Rodrigo settled his\naffairs, converted his effects into silver and gold, visited and\ntook leave of all his friends, who were grieved at his departure, and\nhonoured me with considerable presents; and, coming on board of my\nuncle's ship, with the first fair wind we sailed from the Rio de la\nPlata, and in two months came safe to an anchor in the harbour of\nKingston, in the Island of Jamaica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII\n\nI visit my old Friend Thompson--we set sail for Europe--meet with an odd\nAdventure--arrive in England--I ride across the Country from Portsmouth\nto Sussex--converse with Mrs. Sagely, who informs me of Narcissa's\nbeing in London--in consequence of this Intelligence, I proceed to\nCanterbury--meet with my old friend Morgan--arrive in London--visit\nNarcissa--introduce my Father to be--he is charmed with her good sense\nand beauty--we come to a Determination of demanding her Brother's\nConsent to our Marriage\n\nI inquired, as soon as I got ashore, about my generous companion, Mr.\nThompson, and hearing that he lived in a flourishing condition upon the\nestate left him by his wife's father, who had been dead some years, I\ntook horse immediately, with the consent of Don Rodrigo, who had heard\nme mention him with great regard, and in a few hours reached the place\nof his habitation.\n\nI should much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thompson's sentiments to say\nbarely he was glad to see me: he felt all that the most sensible and\ndisinterested friendship could feel on this occasion, introduced me to\nhis wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already blessed him with\ntwo fine children, and being as yet ignorant of my circumstances,\nfrankly offered me the assistance of his purse and interest. I thanked\nhim for his generous intention, and made him acquainted with my\nsituation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and, after I had\nstayed with him a whole day and night, accompanied me back to Kingston,\nto wait upon my father, whom he invited to his house. Don Rodrigo\ncomplied with his request, and, having been handsomely entertained\nduring the space of a week, returned extremely well satisfied with the\nbehaviour of my friend and his lady, to whom, at parting, he presented a\nvery valuable diamond ring, as a token of his esteem. During the course\nof my conversation with Mr. Thompson, he gave me to understand, that his\nold commander Captain Oakum was dead some months, and that, immediately\nafter his death, a discovery had been made of some valuable effects\nthat he had feloniously secreted out of a prize by the assistance of Dr.\nMackshane, who was now actually in prison on that account, and, being\ndestitute of friends, subsisted solely on the charity of my friend,\nwhose bounty he had implored in the most abject manner, after having\nbeen the barbarous occasion of driving him to that terrible extremity\non board of The Thunder, which we have formerly related. Whatsoever this\nwretch had been guilty of, I applauded Mr. Thompson's generosity towards\nhim in his distress, which wrought so much upon me also, that I sent\nhim ten pistoles, in such a private manner that he could never know his\nbenefactor.\n\nWhile my father and I were caressed among the gentlemen on shore,\nCaptain Bowling had written to his owners, by the packet, which sailed\na few days after our arrival, signifying his prosperous voyage hitherto,\nand desiring them to insure his ship and cargo homeward bound: after\nwhich precaution he applied himself so heartily to the task of loading\nhis ship that, with the assistance of Mr. Thompson, she was full in less\nthan six weeks. This kind gentleman likewise procured for Don Rodrigo\nbills upon London for the greatest part of his gold and silver, by which\nmeans it was secured against the risk of the seas and the enemy; and,\nbefore we sailed, supplied us with such large quantities of all kinds\nof stock, that not only we, but the ship's company, fared sumptuously\nduring the voyage.\n\nEverything being ready, we took our leave of our kind entertainers, and,\ngoing on board at Port Royal, set sail for England on the first day\nof June. We beat up to windward, with fine easy weather, and one night\nbelieving ourselves near Cape Tiberon, lay to, with an intention to wood\nand water next morning in the bay. While we remained in this situation,\na sailor, having drunk more new rum than he could carry, staggered over\nboard, and, notwithstanding all the means that could be used to preserve\nhim, went to the bottom, and disappeared. About two hours after\nthis melancholy accident happened, as I enjoyed the cool air on the\nquarter-deck, I heard a voice rising, as it were, out of the sea\nand calling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHo, the ship ahoy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which one of the men upon the\nforecastle cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll be d--n'd if that an't Jack Marlinspike, who\nwent overboard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not a little surprised at this event, I jumped into the\nboat that lay alongside, with the second mate and four men, and rowing\ntowards the place from whence the voice (which repeated the hail) seemed\nto proceed, we perceived something floating upon the water. When we\nhad rowed a little further, we discerned it to be a man riding upon a\nhencoop, who, seeing us approach, pronounced with a hoarse voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n\nyour bloods! why did you not answer when I hailed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our mate, who was\na veritable seaman, hearing his salute, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy G--, my lads, this is\nnone of our man. This is the devil--pull away for the ship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fellows\nobeyed his command without question, and were already some fathoms on\nour return, when I insisted on their taking up the poor creature, and\nprevailed upon them to go back to the wreck, which when we came near\nthe second time, and signified our intention, we received an answer of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAvast, avast--what ship, brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Being satisfied in this particular,\nhe cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n the ship, I was in hopes it had been my own--where are\nyou bound?\u00e2\u0080\u009d We satisfied his curiosity in this particular too; upon\nwhich he suffered himself to be taken on board, and, after having been\ncomforted with a dram, told us, he belonged to the Vesuvio man-of-war,\nupon a cruise off the island of Hispaniola; that he had fallen overboard\nfour-and-twenty hours ago, and the ship being under sail, they did not\nchoose to bring to, but tossed a hencoop overboard for his convenience,\nupon which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning:\nhowsomever, he was as well content to be aboard of us because he did\nnot doubt that we should meet his ship, and if he had gone ashore in\nthe bay, he might have been taken prisoner by the French. My uncle\nand father were very much diverted with the account of this fellow's\nunconcerned behaviour; and in two days, meeting with the Vesuvio, as he\nexpected, sent him on board of her, according to his desire.\n\nHaving beat up successfully the windward passage, we stretched to the\nnorthward, and falling in with a westerly wind, in eight weeks arrived\nin the soundings, and in two days after made for the Lizard. It is\nimpossible to express the joy I felt at the sight of English ground! Don\nRodrigo was not unmoved, and Strap shed tears of gladness. The sailors\nprofited by our satisfaction, the shoe that was nailed to the mast being\nquite filled with our liberality. My uncle resolved to run up into the\nDowns at once, but the wind shifting when we were abreast of the Isle of\nWight, he was obliged to turn into St. Helen's, and come to Spithead,\nto the great mortification of the crew, thirty of whom were immediately\npressed on board a man-of-war.\n\nMy father and I went ashore immediately at Portsmouth, leaving Strap\nwith the captain to go round with the ship and take care of our effects;\nand I discovered so much impatience to see my charming Narcissa, that my\nfather permitted me to ride across the country to her brother's house;\nwhile he should hire a post-chaise for London, where he would wait for\nme at a place to which I directed him.\n\nFired with all the eagerness of passion, I took post that very night,\nand in the morning reached an inn about three miles from the squire's\nhabitation; here I remained till next morning, allaying the torture of\nmy impatience with the rapturous hope of seeing that divine creature\nafter an absence of eighteen months, which, far from impairing, had\nraised my love to the most exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections\nfree from apprehensions: that something intervened in spite of all my\nhope, and represented her as having yielded to the importunity of her\nbrother and blessed the arms of a happy rival. My thoughts were even\nmaddened with the fear of her death; and, when I arrived in the dark\nat the house of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for some time courage to desire\nadmittance, lest my soul should be shocked with dismal tidings. At\nlength, however, I knocked, and no sooner certified the good gentlewoman\nof my voice than she opened the door, and received me with the most\naffectionate embrace, that brought tears into her aged eyes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor\nheaven's sake, dear mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell me how is Narcissa? is she\nthe same that I left her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She blessed my ears with saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is as\nbeautiful, in as good health, and as much yours as ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Transported at\nthis assurance, I begged to know if I could not see her that very night,\nwhen this sage matron gave me to understand that my mistress was in\nLondon, and that things were strangely altered in the squire's house\nsince my departure; that he had been married a whole year to Melinda,\nwho at first found means to wean his attention so much from Narcissa,\nthat he became quite careless of that lovely sister, comforting himself\nwith the clause in his father's will, by which she should forfeit her\nfortune, by marrying without his consent: that my mistress, being but\nindifferently treated by her sister-in-law, had made use of her freedom\nsome months ago, and gone to town, where she was lodged with Miss\nWilliams, in expectation of my arrival; and had been pestered with the\naddresses of Lord Quiverwit, who, finding her heart engaged, had fallen\nupon a great many shifts to persuade her that I was dead; but, finding\nall his artifices unsuccessful, and despairing of gaining her affection,\nhe had consoled himself for her indifference, by marrying another lady\nsome weeks ago, who had already left him on account of some family\nuneasiness. Besides this interesting information, she told me there was\nnot a great deal of harmony between Melinda and the squire, who was so\nmuch disgusted at the number of gallants who continued to hover about\nher even after her marriage, that he had hurried her down into\nthe country, much against her own inclination, where their mutual\nanimosities had risen to such a height, that they preserved no decency\nbefore company or servants, but abused one another in the grossest\nterms.\n\nThis good old gentlewoman, to give me a convincing proof of my dear\nNarcissa's unalterable love, gratified me with a sight of the last\nletter she had favoured her with, in which I was mentioned with so much\nhonour, tenderness, and concern, that my soul was fired with impatience,\nand I determined to ride all night, that I might have it the sooner in\nmy power to make her happy. Mrs. Sagely, perceiving my eagerness, and\nher maternal affection being equally divided between Narcissa and me,\nbegged leave to remind me of the sentiments with which I went abroad,\nthat would not permit me for any selfish gratification to prejudice the\nfortune of that amiable young lady, who must entirely depend upon me,\nafter having bestowed herself in marriage. I thanked her for her kind\nconcern, and as briefly as possible described my flourishing situation,\nwhich afforded this humane person infinite wonder and satisfaction. I\ntold her, that now I had an opportunity to manifest my gratitude for\nthe many obligations I owed, I would endeavour to make her old age\ncomfortable and easy; as a step to which I proposed she should come\nand live with Narcissa and me. This venerable gentlewoman was so much\naffected with my words, that the tears ran down her ancient cheeks; she\nthanked heaven that I had not belied the presages she had made, on her\nfirst acquaintance with me; acknowledging my generosity, as she called\nit, in the most elegant and pathetic expressions; but declined my\nproposal, on account of her attachment to the dear melancholy cottage\nwhere she had so peacefully consumed her solitary widowhood. Finding\nher immovable on this subject, I insisted on her accepting a present of\nthirty guineas, and took my leave, resolving to accommodate her with the\nsame sum annually, for the more comfortable support of the infirmities\nof old age.\n\nHaving rode all night, I found myself at Canterbury in the morning,\nwhere I alighted to procure fresh horses; and, as I walked into the inn,\nperceived an apothecary's on the other side of the street, with the name\nof Morgan over the door; alarmed at this discovery, I could not help\nthinking that my old messmate had settled in this place, and upon\ninquiry found my conjecture true, and that he was married lately to a\nwidow in that city, by whom he had got three thousand pounds. Rejoiced\nat this intelligence, I went to his shop as soon as it was open, and\nfound my friend behind the counter, busy in preparing a clyster. I\nsaluted him at entrance, with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour servant, Mr. Morgan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which he\nlooked at me, and replying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour most humble servant, good sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rubbed\nhis ingredients in the mortar without any emotion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMorgan, have you forgot your old messmate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d At these words he looked\nup again, and starting, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Cot is my--sure it cannot--yes, by my\nsalfation, I pelieve it is my dear friend Mr. Rantom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was no sooner\nconvinced of my identity, than he threw down the pestle, overset the\nmortar, and jumping over the board, swept up the contents with his\nclothes, flew about my neck, hugged me affectionately, and daubed me all\nover with turpentine and the yolks of eggs which he had been mixing when\nI came in. Our mutual congratulations being over, he told me, that he\nfound himself a widower upon his return from the West Indies; that\nhe had got interest to be appointed surgeon of a man-of-war, in which\ncapacity he had served some years, until he married an apothecary's\nwidow, with whom he now enjoyed a pretty good sum of money, peace, and\nquiet, and an indifferent good trade. He was very desirous of hearing my\nadventures, which I assured him I had not time to relate, but told him\nin general, my circumstances were very good, and that I hoped to see\nhim when I should not be in such a hurry as at present. He insisted,\nhowever, on my staying breakfast, and introduced me to his wife, who\nseemed to be a decent sensible woman, pretty well stricken in years.\nIn the course of our conversation, he showed the sleeve-buttons I had\nexchanged with him at our parting in the West Indies, and was not a\nlittle proud to see that I had preserved his with the same care. When I\ninformed him of Mackshane's condition, he seemed at first to exult over\nhis distress; but, after a little recollection, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he has paid\nfor his malice; I forgife him, and may Cot forgife him likewise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nexpressed great concern for the soul of Captain Oakum, which he believed\nwas now gnashing its teeth; but it was some time before I could convince\nhim of Thompson's being alive, at whose good fortune, nevertheless, he\nwas extremely glad.\n\nHaving renewed our protestations of friendship, I bade the honest\nWelshman and his spouse farewell, and, taking post-horses, arrived at\nLondon that same night, where I found my father in good health, to\nwhom I imparted what I had learned of Narcissa. This indulgent parent\napproved of my intention of marrying her, even without fortune, provided\nher brother's consent could not be obtained; promised to make over to me\nin a few days a sufficiency to maintain her in a fashionable manner and\nexpressed a desire of seeing this amiable creature, who had captivated\nme so much. As I had not slept the night before, and was besides\nfatigued with my journey, I found myself under a necessity of taking\nsome repose, and went to bed accordingly: next morning, about ten\no'clock, took a chair, and according to Mrs. Sagely's directions, went\nto my charmer's lodgings, and inquired for Miss Williams. I had not\nwaited in the parlour longer than a minute, when this young woman\nentered, and no sooner perceived me, than she shrieked and ran backward:\nbut I got between her and the door, and clasping her in my arms, brought\nher to herself with an embrace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood heaven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Random,\nis it you indeed? My mistress will run distracted with joy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told her,\nit was from an apprehension that my sudden appearance might have had\nsome bad effect on my dear Narcissa, that I had desired to see her\nfirst, in order to concert some method of acquainting her mistress\ngradually with my arrival. She approved of my conduct, and, after having\nyielded to the suggestions of her own friendship, in asking if my voyage\nhad been successful, charged herself with that office, and left me\nglowing with desire of seeing and embracing the object of my love. In a\nvery little time I heard some body coming down the stairs in haste, and\nthe voice of my angel pronounce, with an eager tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO heaven! is it\npossible! where is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d How were my faculties aroused at this well known\nsound! and how was my soul transported when she broke in upon my view in\nall the bloom of ripened beauty! Grace was in all her steps, heaven\nin her eye, in every gesture dignity and love! You, whose souls are\nsusceptible of the most delicate impressions, whose tender bosoms have\nfelt the affecting vicissitudes of love, who have suffered an absence\nof eighteen long months from the dear object of your hope, and found\nat your return the melting fair as kind and constant as your heart can\nwish, do me justice on this occasion, and conceive what unutterable\nrapture possessed us both, while we flew into each other's arms! This\nwas no time for speech: locked in a mutual embrace, we continued some\nminutes in a silent trance of joy! When I thus encircled all my soul\nheld dear--while I hung over her beauties--beheld her eyes sparkle, and\nevery feature flush with virtuous fondness--when I saw her enchanting\nbosom heave with undissembled rapture, and knew myself the happy\ncause--heavens! what was my situation! I am tempted to commit my paper\nto the flames, and to renounce my pen for ever, because its most ardent\nand lucky expression so poorly describes the emotions of my soul. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO\nadorable Narcissa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO miracle of beauty, love and truth! I\nat last fold thee in my arms! I at last can call thee mine! No jealous\nbrother shall thwart our happiness again; fortune hath at length\nrecompensed me for all my sufferings, and enabled me to do justice to my\nlove.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dear creature smiled ineffably charmingly, and, with a\nlook of bewitching tenderness, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand shall we never part again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou wondrous pattern of all earthly perfection!\nnever, until death shall divide us! By this ambrosial kiss, a thousand\ntimes more fragrant than the breeze that sweeps the orange grove, I\nnever more will leave thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs my first transport abated, my passion grew turbulent and unruly. I\nwas giddy with standing on the brink of bliss, and all my virtue and\nphilosophy were scarce sufficient to restrain the inordinate sallies of\ndesire. Narcissa perceived the conflict within me, and with her usual\ndignity of prudence, called off my imagination from the object in view,\nand with eager expressions of interested curiosity, desired to know the\nparticulars of my voyage. In this I gratified her inclination, bringing\nmy story down to the present hour. She was infinitely surprised at the\ncircumstance of finding my father, which brought tears into her\nlovely eyes. She was transported at hearing that approved of my flame,\ndiscovered a longing desire of being introduced to him, congratulated\nherself and me upon my good fortune, and observed, that this great\nand unexpected stroke of fate seemed to have been brought about by the\nimmediate direction of Providence. Having entertained ourselves some\nhours with the genuine effusions of our souls, I obtained her consent to\ncomplete my happiness as soon as my father should judge it proper; and,\napplying with my own hands a valuable necklace, composed of diamonds\nand amethysts set alternately, which an old Spanish lady at Paraguay had\npresented me with, I took my leave, promising to return in the afternoon\nwith Don Rodrigo. When I went home, this generous parent inquired very\naffectionately about the health of my dear Narcissa, to whom, that I\nmight be the more agreeable, he put into my hand a deed, by which I\nfound myself in possession of fifteen thousand pounds, exclusive of the\nprofits of my own merchandise, which amounted to three thousand more.\nAfter dinner I accompanied him to the lodgings of my mistress, who,\nbeing dressed for the occasion, made a most dazzling appearance. I could\nperceive him struck with her figure, which I really think was the most\nbeautiful that ever was created under the sun. He embraced her tenderly,\nand told her he was proud of having a son who had spirit to attempt, and\nqualifications to engage the affections of such a fine lady. She blushed\nat this compliment, and, with eyes full of the softest languishment\nturned upon me, said, she should have been unworthy of Mr. Random's\nattention, had she been blind to his extraordinary merit. I made no\nother answer than a low bow. My father, sighing, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch was\nonce my Charlotte;\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the tear rushed into his eye, and the tender\nheart of Narcissa manifested itself in two precious drops of sympathy,\nwhich, but for his presence, I would have kissed away. Without repeating\nthe particulars of our conversation, I shall only observe, that Don\nRodrigo was as much charmed with her good sense as with her appearance,\nand she was no less pleased with his understanding and polite address.\nIt was determined that he should write to the squire, signifying his\napprobation of my passion for his sister, and offering a settlement,\nwhich he should have no reason to reject; and that, if he should refuse\nthe proposal, we would crown our mutual wishes without any further\nregard to his will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII\n\nMy Father makes a present to Narcissa--the Letter is dispatched to her\nBrother--I appear among my Acquaintance--Banter's Behaviour--the Squire\nrefuses his Consent--my Uncle comes to Town--approves of my Choice--I am\nmarried--we meet the Squire and his Lady at the Play--our Acquaintance\nis courted\n\nAfter having spent the evening to the satisfaction of all present, my\nfather addressed himself thus to Narcissa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, give me leave to\nconsider you hereafter as my daughter, in which capacity I insist upon\nyour accepting this first instance of my paternal duty and affection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n With these words he put into her hand a bank note of five hundred\npounds, which she no sooner examined, than with a low courtesy she\nreplied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear sir, though I have not the least occasion for this\nsupply, I have too great a veneration for you to refuse this proof of\nyour generosity and esteem, which I the more freely receive, because I\nalready look upon Mr. Random's interest as inseparably connected with\nmine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was extremely well pleased with her frank and ingenuous reply,\nupon which we saluted, and wished her good night. The letter, at my\nrequest, was dispatched to Sussex by an express, and in the meantime,\nDon Rodrigo, to grace my nuptials, hired a ready furnished house, and\nset up a very handsome equipage.\n\nThough I passed the greatest part of the day with the darling of my\nsoul, I found leisure sometimes to be among my former acquaintance,\nwho were astonished at the magnificence of my appearance. Banter in\nparticular was confounded at the vicissitudes of my fortune, the causes\nof which he endeavoured in vain to discover, until I thought fit to\ndisclose the whole secret of my last voyage, partly in consideration\nof our former intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures,\nwhich he and others, in all probability, would have made in regard to\nmy circumstances. He professed great satisfaction at this piece of news;\nand I had no cause to believe him insincere, when I considered that he\nwould now look upon himself as acquitted of the debt he owed me, and\nat the same time flatter himself with the hopes of borrowing more. I\ncarried him home to dinner with me, and my father liked his conversation\nso much, that, upon hearing his difficulties, he desired me to\naccommodate him for the present, and inquire, if he would accept of\na commission in the army, towards the purchase of which he should\nwillingly lend him money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity\nof being alone with me, when, as I expected, he told me that he was just\non the point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle, whose heir he\nwas, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expense, which he desired I\nwould lend him and take my bond for the whole. His demand was limited to\nten guineas; and when I put twenty in his hand, he stared at me for some\nmoments; then, putting it into his purse, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,--'tis all one--you shall\nhave the whole in a very short time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I had taken his note, to save\nthe expense of a bond, I expressed some surprise that a fellow of his\nspirit should loiter away his time in idleness, and, asked why he did\nnot choose to make his fortune in the army. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthrow\naway money upon a subaltern's commission, and be under the command of\na parcel of scoundrels, who have raised themselves above me by the most\ninfamous practices. No, I love independency too well to sacrifice my\nlife, health, and pleasure, for such a pitiful consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Finding\nhim adverse to this way of life, I changed the subject, and returned\nto Don Rodrigo, who had just received the following epistle from the\nsquire:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,--Concerning a letter which I received, subscribed R. Random, this\nis the answer. As for you, I know nothing of you. Your son, or pretended\nson, I have seen; if he marries my sister, at his peril be it; I do\ndeclare that he shall not have one farthing of her fortune, which\nbecomes my property, if she takes a husband without my consent. Your\nsettlement, I do believe, is all a sham, and yourself no better than you\nshould be; but if you had all the wealth of the Indies, your son shall\nnever match in our family with the consent of\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOrson Topehall\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMy father was not much surprised at this polite letter, after having\nheard the character of the author; and as for me, I was even pleased\nat his refusal, because I had now an opportunity of showing my\ndisinterested love. By his permission I waited on my charmer: and\nhaving imparted the contents of her brother's letter, at which she wept\nbitterly, in spite of all my consolation and caresses, the time of our\nmarriage was fixed two days. During this interval, in which my soul\nwas wound up to the last stretch of rapturous expectation, Narcissa\nendeavoured to reconcile some of her relations in town to her marriage\nwith me; but, finding them all deaf to her remonstrances, either out of\nenvy or prejudice, she told me with the most enchanting sweetness, while\nthe tears bedewed her lovely cheeks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure the world will no longer\nquestion your generosity when you take a poor forlorn beggar to your\narms?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Affected with her sorrow, I pressed the fair mourner to my\nbreast, and swore that she was more dear and welcome on that account,\nbecause she had sacrificed her friends and fortune to her love for me.\nMy uncle, for whose character she had a great veneration, being by this\ntime come to town, I introduced him to my bride; and, although he was\nnot very much subject to refined sensations, he was struck dumb with\nadmiration at her beauty. After having kissed and gazed at her for some\ntime, he turned to me, saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds bobs, Rory! a notable prize indeed,\nfinely built and gloriously rigged, i'faith! If she an't well manned\nwhen you take the command of her, sirrah, you deserve to go to sea in a\ncockle shell. No offence, I hope, niece! you must not mind what I say,\nbeing (as the saying is) a plain seafaring man, though mayhap I have as\nmuch regard for you as another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She received him with great civility,\ntold him she had longed a great while to see a person to whom she was so\nmuch indebted for his generosity to Mr. Random; that she looked upon him\nas her uncle, by which name she begged leave to call him for the future;\nand that she was very sure he could say nothing that would give her\nthe least offence. The honest captain was transported at her courteous\nbehaviour, and insisted upon giving her away at the ceremony, swearing\nthat he loved her as well as if she was his own child, and that he would\ngive two thousand guineas to the first fruit of our love, as soon as\nit would squeak. Everything being settled for the solemnisation of our\nnuptials, which were to be performed privately at my father's house, the\nauspicious hour arrived, when Don Rodrigo and my uncle went in the coach\nto fetch the bride and Miss Williams: leaving me with a parson, Banter,\nand Strap, neither of whom had as yet seen my charming mistress. My\nfaithful valet, who was on the rack of impatience to behold a lady\nof whom he had heard so much, no sooner understood that the coach was\nreturned, than he placed himself at a window, to have a peep at her as\nshe alighted; and, when he saw her, clapped his hands together, turned\nup the white of his eyes, and, with his mouth wide open, remained in a\nsort of ecstacy, which broke out into \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Dea certe! qualis in Eurotae\nripis, aut per iuga Cynthi exercet Diana choros?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The doctor and Banter\nwere surprised to hear my man speak Latin; but when my father led\nNarcissa into the room, the object of their admiration was soon changed,\nas appeared in the countenances of both. Indeed, they must have been the\nmost insensible of all beings, could they have beheld without emotion\nthe divine creature that approached! She was dressed in a sack of white\nsatin, embroidered on the breast with gold, the crown of her head was\ncovered with a small French cap, from whence descended her beautiful\nhair in ringlets that waved upon her snowy neck, which dignified the\nnecklace I had given her; her looks glowed with modesty and love; and\nher bosom, through the veil of gauze that shaded it, afforded a prospect\nof Elysium! I received this inestimable gift of Providence as became me;\nand in a little time the clergyman did his office, my uncle, at his own\nearnest request, acting the part of a father to my dear Narcissa, who\ntrembled very much, and had scarce spirits sufficient to support her\nunder this great change of situation. Soon as she was mine by the laws\nor heaven and earth, I printed a burning kiss upon her lips; my father\nembraced her tenderly, my uncle hugged her with great affection, and\nI presented her to my friend Banter, who saluted her in a very polite\nmanner; Miss Williams hung round her neck, and went plentifully; while\nStrap fell upon his knees, and begged to kiss his lady's hand, which she\npresented with great affability. I shall not pretend to describe my own\nfeelings at this juncture; let it suffice to say that having supped and\nentertained ourselves till ten o'clock, I cautioned my Narcissa against\nexposing her health by sitting up too late, and she was prevailed upon\nto withdraw with her maid to an apartment destined for us. When she left\nthe room, her face overspread with a blush that set all my blood in a\nstate of fermentation, and made every pulse beat with tenfold vigour!\nShe was so cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half-hour:\nwhen, no longer able to restrain my impatience, I broke from the\ncompany, burst into her chamber, pushed out her confidante, and locked\nthe door, and found her--O heaven and earth!--a feast a thousand times\nmore delicious than my most sanguine hopes presaged! But, let me not\nprofane the chaste mysteries of Hymen. I was the happiest of men!\n\nIn the morning I was awaked by three or four drums, which Banter had\nplaced under the window; upon which I withdrew the curtain, and enjoyed\nthe unspeakable satisfaction of contemplating those angelic charms which\nwere now in my possession! Beauty! which, whether sleeping or awake,\nshot forth peculiar graces! The light darting upon my Narcissa's eyes,\nshe awoke also, and recollecting her situation, hid her blushes in my\nbosom. I was distracted with joy! I could not believe the evidence of\nmy senses, and looked upon all that had happened as the fictions of a\ndream! In the meantime my uncle knocked at the door, and bade me turn\nout, for I had had a long spell. I rose accordingly, and sent Miss\nWilliams to her mistress, myself receiving the congratulation of Captain\nBowling, who rallied me in his sea phrase with great success. In less\nthan an hour, Don Rodrigo led my wife into breakfast, where she received\nthe compliments of the company on her looks, which, they said, if\npossible, were improved by matrimony. As her delicate ears were offended\nwith none of those indecent ambiguities which are too often spoken on\nsuch occasions, she behaved with dignity, unaffected modesty, and ease;\nand, as a testimony of my affection and esteem, I presented her, in\npresence of them all, with a deed, by which I settled the whole fortune\nI was possessed of on her and her heirs for ever. She accepted it with\na glance of most tender acknowledgment, observed, that she could not be\nsurprised at anything of this kind I should do, and desired my father to\ntake the trouble of keeping it, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNext to my own Mr. Random, you\nare the person in whom I ought to have the greatest confidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charmed\nwith her prudent and ingenuous manner of proceeding, he took the paper,\nand assured her that it should not lose its value while in his custody.\n\nAs we had not many visits to give and receive, the little time we stayed\nin town was spent in going to public diversions, where I have the vanity\nto think Narcissa was seldom eclipsed. One night, in particular, we sent\nour footman to keep one of the stage boxes, which we no sooner entered,\nthan we perceived in the opposite box the squire and his lady, who\nseemed not a little surprised at seeing us. I was pleased at this\nopportunity of confronting them; the more, because Melinda was robbed\nof all her admirers by my wife, who happened that night to outshine her\nsister both in beauty and dress. She was piqued at Narcissa's victory,\ntossed her head a thousand different ways, flirted her fan, looked at\nus with disdain, then whispered to her husband, and broke out into\nan affected giggle; but all her arts proved ineffectual, either to\ndiscompose Mrs. Random, or to conceal her own mortification, which at\nlength forced her away long before the play was done. The news of our\nmarriage being spread, with many circumstances to our disadvantage, by\nthe industry of this malignant creature, a certain set of persons fond\nof scandal began to inquire into the particulars of my fortune, which\nthey no sooner understood to be independent, than the tables were\nturned, and our acquaintance was courted as much as it had been despised\nbefore: but she had too much dignity of pride to encourage this change\nof conduct, especially in her relations, whom she could never be\nprevailed upon to see, after the malicious reports they had raised to\nher prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX\n\nMy father intends to revisit the Place of his Nativity--we propose to\naccompany him--my Uncle renews his will in my favour, determining to go\nto sea again--we set out for Scotland--arrive at Edinburgh--purchase\nour paternal Estate--proceed to it--halt at the Town where I was\neducated--take up my bond to Crab--the Behaviour of Potion and his\nWife, and one of our Female Cousins--our Reception at the Estate--Strap\nmarries Miss Williams, and is settled by my Father to his own\nsatisfaction--I am more and more happy.\n\nMy father intending to revisit his native country, and pay the tribute\nof a few tears at my mother's grave, Narcissa and I resolved to\naccompany him in the execution of his pious office, and accordingly\nprepared for the journey, in which, however, my uncle would not engage,\nbeing resolved to try his fortune once more at sea. In the meantime he\nrenewed his will in favour of my wife and me, and deposited it in the\nhands of his brother-in-law: while I (that I might not be wanting to\nmy own interest) summoned the squire to produce his father's will at\nDoctors' Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my\nabsence.\n\nEverything being thus settled, we took leave of all our friends in\nLondon, and set out for Scotland, Don Rodrigo, Narcissa, Miss Williams,\nand I, in the coach, and Strap, with two men in livery, on horseback; as\nwe made easy stages, my charmer held it out very well, till we arrived\nat Edinburgh, where we proposed to rest ourselves some weeks.\n\nHere Don Rodrigo having intelligence that the foxhunter had spoilt his\nestate, which was to be exposed to sale by public auction, he determined\nto make a purchase of the spot where he was born, and actually bought\nall the land that belonged to his father.\n\nIn a few days after this bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order\nto go and take possession; and by the way halted one night in that town\nwhere I was educated. Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead;\nwhereupon I sent for his executor, paid the sum I owed with interest,\nand took up my bond. Mr. Potion and his wife, hearing of my arrival,\nhad the assurance to come to the inn where we lodged, and send up their\nnames, with the desire of being permitted to pay their respects to my\nfather and me: but their sordid behaviour towards me, when I was an\norphan, had made too deep an impression on my mind to be effaced by\nthis mean mercenary piece of condescension: I therefore rejected their\nmessage with disdain, and bade Strap tell them, that my father and I\ndesired to have no communication with such low-minded wretches as they\nwere.\n\nThey had not been gone half-an-hour, when a woman, without any ceremony,\nopened the door of the room where we sat, and, making towards my father,\naccosted him with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUncle, your servant--I am glad to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was\nno other than one of my female cousins, mentioned in the first part of\nmy memoirs, to whom Don Rodrigo replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, who are you, madam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy cousin Rory there knows me very well. Don't you\nremember me, Rory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor my own part, I shall\nnever forget you. Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I have\nformerly told you) treated me so humanely in my childhood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I\npronounced these words, my father's resentment glowed in his visage,\nand he ordered her to be gone, with such a commanding aspect, that\nshe retired in a fright, muttering curses as she went downstairs. We\nafterwards learned that she was married to an ensign, who had already\nspent all her fortune; and that her sister had borne a child to her\nmother's footman, who is now her husband, and keeps a petty alehouse in\nthe country.\n\nThe fame of our flourishing condition having arrived at this place\nbefore us, we got notice that the magistrates intended next day to\ncompliment us with the freedom of their town; upon which my father,\nconsidering their complaisance in the right point of view, ordered the\nhorses to the coach early in the morning.\n\nWe proceeded to our estate, which lay about twenty miles from this\nplace; and, when we came within half-a-league of the house, were met\nby a prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women, and children, who\ntestified their joy by loud acclamations, and accompanied our coach to\nthe gate. As there is no part of the world in which the peasants are\nmore attached to their lords than in Scotland, we were almost devoured\nby their affections. My father had always been their favourite, and now\nthat he appeared their master, after having been thought dead so long,\ntheir joy broke out into a thousand extravagances. When we entered the\ncourt yard, we were surrounded by a vast number, who crowded together\nso closely to see us that several were in danger of being squeezed to\ndeath; those who were near Don Rodrigo fell upon their knees, and kissed\nhis hand, or the hem of his garment, praying aloud for long life and\nprosperity to him; others approached Narcissa and me in the same manner;\nwhile the rest clapped their hands at a distance, and invoked heaven to\nshower its choicest blessings on our heads! In short, the whole scene,\nthough rude, was so affecting, that the gentle partner of my heart wept\nover it, and my father himself could not refrain from dropping a tear.\n\nHaving welcomed his daughter and me to his house, he ordered some\nbullocks to be killed, and some hogsheads of ale to be brought from the\nneighbouring village, to regale these honest people, who had not enjoyed\nsuch a holiday for many years before.\n\nNext day we were visited by the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, most of\nthem our relations, one of whom brought along my cousin, the foxhunter,\nwho had stayed at his house since he was obliged to leave his own! My\nfather was generous enough to receive him kindly, and even promised to\npurchase for him a commission in the army, for which he expressed great\nthankfulness and joy.\n\nMy charming Narcissa was universally admired and loved for her beauty,\naffability, and good sense; and so well pleased with the situation of\nthe place, and the company round, that she has not as yet discovered the\nleast desire of changing her habitation.\n\nWe had not been many days settled, when I prevailed upon my father to\npay a visit to the village where I had been at school. Here we were\nreceived by the principal inhabitants, who entertained us in the church,\nwhere Mr. Syntax the schoolmaster (my tyrant being dead) pronounced a\nLatin oration in honour of our family. And none exerted themselves more\nthan Strap's father and relations, who looked upon the honest valet\nas the first gentleman of their race, and honoured his benefactors\naccordingly. Having received the homage of this place, we retired,\nleaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the parish; and that\nvery night, Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been\nshown to him, and to me on his account, ventured to tell me, that he had\na sneaking kindness for Miss Williams, and that, if his lady and I would\nuse our interest in his behalf, he did not doubt that she would listen\nto his addresses. Surprised at this proposal, I asked if he knew the\nstory of that unfortunate young gentlewoman; upon which he replied,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, I know what you mean--she has been unhappy, I grant you--but\nwhat of that? I am convinced of her reformation; or else you and my good\nlady would not treat her with such respect. As for the censure of the\nworld, I value it not a fig's end--besides, the world knows nothing of\nthe matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I commended his philosophy, and interested Narcissa in\nhis cause; who interceded so effectually, that in a little time Miss\nWilliams yielded her consent, and they were married at the approbation\nof Don Rodrigo, who gave him five hundred pounds to stock a farm, and\nmade him overseer of his estate. My generous bedfellow gave her maid the\nsame sum; so that they live in great peace and plenty within half-a-mile\nof us, and daily put up prayers for our preservation.\n\nIf there be such a thing as true happiness on earth, I enjoy it. The\nimpetuous transports of my passion are now settled and mellowed into\nendearing fondness and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate\nconnection and interchange of hearts which nought but virtuous wedlock\ncan produce. Fortune seems determined to make ample amends for her\nformer cruelty, for my proctor writes that, notwithstanding the clause\nin my father-in-law's will, on which the squire founds his claim, I\nshall certainly recover my wife's fortune, in consequence of a codicil\nannexed, which explains that clause, and limits her restriction to the\nage of nineteen, after which she was at her own disposal. I would\nhave set out for London immediately after receiving this piece of\nintelligence, but my dear angel has been qualmish of late, and begins to\ngrow remarkably round in the waist; so that I cannot leave her in such\nan interesting situation, which I hope will produce something to crown\nmy felicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Roderick Random,\nby Tobias Smollett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF RODERICK\nRANDOM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4085-0.txt or 4085-0.zip ***** This\nand all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/0\/8\/4085\/\n\nProduced by Tapio Riikonen, and David Widger\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States.

Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n","id":512,"split":"train"}
