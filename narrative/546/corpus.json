{"ori_id":"81b98218c1a885f36dc98cbfc95bb3774a77eed1","title":"The Bread-Winners","context":"The Bread-Winners\n One of the wealthiest and most cultured residents of the famed Algonquin Avenue in Buffland (a city intended to be Cleveland), Captain Arthur Farnham is a Civil War veteran and widower\u2014his wife died of illness while accompanying him at a remote frontier post. Since he left the army, he has sought to involve himself in municipal affairs, but fails though political naivet\u00e9. The victorious party has allowed him the position of chairman of the library board. In that capacity, he is approached by Maud Matchin, daughter of carpenter Saul Matchin, a man content with his lot. His daughter is not, and seeks employment at the library as a means of bettering herself. Farnham agrees to put her case, but is defeated by a majority on the board, who have their own candidate. She finds herself attracted to Farnham, who is more interested in Alice Belding, daughter of his wealthy widow neighbor.\nSaul Matchin had hoped that his daughter would become a house servant, but having attended high school, she feels herself too good for that. She is admired by Saul's assistant Sam Sleeny, who lives with the Matchins, a match favored by her father. Sleeny is busy repairing Farnham's outbuildings, and is made jealous by interactions between the captain and Maud. Seeing Sleeny's discontent, Andrew Jackson Offitt (true name Ananias), a locksmith and \"professional reformer\", tries to get him to join the Bread-winners, a labor organization. Sleeny is happy with his employment, \"Old Saul Matchin and me come to an agreement about time and pay, and both of us was suited. Ef he's got his heel into me, I don't feel it,\" but due to his unhappiness over Maud, is easy game for Offitt, who gets him to join, and to pay the dues that are Offitt's visible means of support.\nMaud has become convinced that she is in love with Farnham, and declares it to him. It is not reciprocated, and the scene is witnessed both by Mrs. Belding and by Sleeny. The widow believes Farnham when he states he had given Maud no encouragement, but her daughter, when her mother incautiously tells her of the incident, does not. When Farnham seeks to marry Alice, she turns him down and asks him never to renew the subject.\nOffitt's membership has tired of endless talk, and plans a general strike, a fact of which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police\u2014on condition there is no expense to the city.\nMeanwhile, Maud tells her father she will never marry Sleeny. She is wooed by Bott, who is a spiritualist and a Bread-winner, and also by Offitt. Neither meets success, though Offitt dexterously prevents her from actually saying no, and through flattery and stories of his alleged past piques her interest.\nBy the end of the second day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield [in the serialization, \"Clevealo\"], the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are captured by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.\nOffitt, despite being one of the leaders of the assault on the Belding house, has escaped blame and befriends the sullen Sleeny on his release. Upon learning that some workers pay their landlord, Farnham, in the evening of the rent day at his home, Offitt comes up with a scheme\u2014rob and murder Farnham and let Sleeny take the blame as Offitt elopes with Maud. Accordingly, Offitt sneaks into Farnham's house with Sleeny's hammer, but just as he is striking the fatal blow, Alice Belding, who can see what is going on from her house through an opera glass, screams, distracting Offitt enough so that Farnham is hurt by the blow, but not killed. Offitt hurries away with the money, and proceeds to frame Sleeny. After realizing Offitt's treachery, Sleeny escapes jail and kills him. The stolen money is found on Offitt's body, clearing Sleeny in the assault on Farnham, but the carpenter must still stand trial for the killing of Offitt, in which he is aided by partisan testimony from Maud. A sympathetic jury ignores the law to find him not guilty. Sleeny wins Maud's hand in marriage, and Farnham and Alice Belding are to be wed.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Bread-winners, by John Hay\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

A gentleman, who was seated in\nfront of the fire reading a newspaper, looked up at the clock to see\nwhat hour it was, to save himself the trouble of counting the slow,\nmusical strokes. The eyes he raised were light gray, with a blue glint\nof steel in them, shaded by lashes as black as jet. The hair was also\nas black as hair can be, and was parted near the middle of his\nforehead. It was inclined to curl, but had not the length required by\nthis inclination. The dark brown mustache was the only ornament the\nrazor had spared on the wholesome face, the outline of which was clear\nand keen. The face suited the hands--it had the refinement and\ngentleness of one delicately bred, and the vigorous lines and color of\none equally at home in field and court; and the hands had the firm,\nhard symmetry which showed they had done no work, and the bronze tinge\nwhich is the imprint wherewith sky and air mark their lovers. His\nclothes were of the fashion seen in the front windows of the\nKnickerbocker Club in the spring of the year 187-, and were worn as\neasily as a self-respecting bird wears his feathers. He seemed, in\nshort, one of those fortunate natures, who, however born, are always\nbred well, and come by prescription to most of the good things the\nworld can give.\n\nHe sat in a room marked, like himself, with a kind of serious\nelegance--one of those apartments which seem to fit the person like a\nmore perfect dress. All around the walls ran dwarf book-cases of carved\noak, filled with volumes bound in every soft shade of brown and tawny\nleather, with only enough of red and green to save the shelves from\nmonotony. Above these the wall space was covered with Cordovan leather,\nstamped with gold _fleurs-de-lis_ to within a yard of the top, where a\nfrieze of palm-leaves led up to a ceiling of blue and brown and gold.\nThe whole expression of the room was of warmth and good manners. The\nfurniture was of oak and stamped leather. The low book-cases were\ncovered with bronzes, casts, and figurines, of a quality so uniformly\ngood that none seemed to feel the temptation either to snub or to\ncringe to its neighbor. The Owari pots felt no false shame beside the\nroyal Satsuma; and Barbedienne's bronzes, the vases of Limoges and\nLambeth and bowls from Nankin and Corea dwelt together in the harmony\nof a varied perfection.\n\nIt was an octagon room, with windows on each side of the fire-place, in\nwhich a fire of Ohio coal was leaping and crackling with a cheerful and\nunctuous noisiness. Out of one window yon could see a pretty garden of\nfive or six acres behind the house, and out of the other a carefully\nkept lawn, extending some hundred yards from the front door to the\ngates of hammered iron which opened upon a wide-paved avenue. This\nstreet was the glory of Buff-land, a young and thriving city on Lake\nErie, which already counted a population of over two hundred thousand\nsouls. The people of Clairfield, a rival town, denied that there was\nanything like so many inhabitants, and added that \"the less we say\nabout 'souls' the better.\" But this was pure malice; Buffland was a big\ncity. Its air was filled with the smoke and odors of vast and\nsuccessful trade, and its sky was reddened by night with the glare of\nits furnaces, rising like the hot breath of some prostrate Titan,\nconquered and bowed down by the pitiless cunning of men. Its people\nwere, as a rule, rich and honest, especially in this avenue of which I\nhave spoken. If you have ever met a Bufflander, you have heard of\nAlgonquin Avenue. He will stand in the Champs Elysees, when all the\nvice and fashion of Europe are pouring down from the Place of the Star\nin the refluent tide that flows from Boulogne Wood to Paris, and calmly\ntell you that \"Algonquin Avenue in the sleighing season can discount\nthis out of sight.\" Something is to be pardoned to the spirit of\nliberty; and the avenue is certainly a fine one. It is three miles long\nand has hardly a shabby house in it, while for a mile or two the houses\nupon one side, locally called \"the Ridge,\" are unusually line, large,\nand costly. They are all surrounded with well-kept gardens and\nseparated from the street by velvet lawns which need scarcely fear\ncomparison with the emerald wonders which centuries of care have\nwrought from the turf of England. The house of which we have seen one\nroom was one of the best upon this green and park-like thoroughfare.\nThe gentleman who was sitting by the fire was Mr. Arthur Farnham. He\nwas the owner and sole occupant of the large stone house--a widower of\nsome years' standing, although he was yet young. His parents had died\nin his childhood. He had been an officer in the army, had served\nseveral years upon the frontier, had suffered great privations, had\nmarried a wife much older than himself, had seen her die on the Plains\nfrom sheer want, though he had more money than he could get\ntransportation for; and finally, on the death of his grandfather he had\nresigned, with reluctance, a commission which had brought him nothing\nbut suffering and toil, and had returned to Buffland, where he was\nborn, to take charge of the great estate of which he was the only heir.\nAnd even yet, in the midst of a luxury and a comfort which anticipated\nevery want and gratified every taste, he often looked longingly back\nupon the life he had left, until his nose inhaled again the scent of\nthe sage-brush and his eyes smarted with alkali dust. He regretted the\ndesolate prairies, the wide reaches of barrenness accursed of the\nCreator, the wild chaos of the mountain canons, the horror of the Bad\nLands, the tingling cold of winter in the Black Hills. But the Republic\nholds so high the privilege of serving her that, for the officer who\nonce resigns--with a good character--there is no return forever, though\nhe seek it with half the lobby at his heels. So Captain Farnham sat,\nthis fine May morning, reading a newspaper which gave the stations of\nhis friends in the \"Tenth\" with something of the feeling which assails\nthe exile when he cons the court journal where his name shall appear no\nmore.\n\nBut while he is looking at the clock a servant enters.\n\n\"That same young person is here again.\"\n\n\"What young person?\"\n\nThere was a slight flavor of reproach in the tone of the grave\nEnglishman as he answered:\n\n\"I told you last night, sir, she have been here three times already;\nshe doesn't give me her name nor yet her business; she is settin' in\nthe drawin'-room, and says she will wait till you are quite at leisure.\nI was about to tell her,\" he added with still deeper solemnity, \"that\nyou were hout, sir, but she hinterrupted of me and said, 'He isn't\ngone, there's his 'at,' which I told her you 'ad several 'ats, and\nwould she wait in the drawin'-room and I'd see.\"\n\nCaptain Farnham smiled.\n\n\"Very well, Budsey, you've done your best--and perhaps she won't eat me\nafter all. Is there a fire in the drawing-room?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Let her come in here, then.\"\n\nA moment afterward the rustle of a feminine step made Farnham raise his\nhead suddenly from his paper. It was a quick, elastic step, accompanied\nby that crisp rattle of drapery which the close clinging garments of\nladies produced at that season. The door opened, and as the visitor\nentered Farnham rose in surprise. He had expected to see the usual\nsemi-mendicant, with sad-colored raiment and doleful whine, calling for\na subscription for a new \"Centennial History,\" or the confessed genteel\nbeggar whose rent would be due to-morrow. But there was nothing in any\nway usual in the young person who stood before him. She was a tall and\nrobust girl of eighteen or nineteen, of a singularly fresh and vigorous\nbeauty. The artists forbid us to look for physical perfection in real\npeople, but it would have been hard for the coolest-headed studio-rat\nto find any fault in the slender but powerful form of this young woman.\nHer color was deficient in delicacy, and her dark hair was too\nluxuriant to be amenable to the imperfect discipline to which it had\nbeen accustomed; but the eye of Andrea, sharpened by criticising\nRaphael, could hardly have found a line to alter in her. The dress of\nthat year was scarcely more reticent in its revelations than the first\nwet cloth with which a sculptor swathes his kneaded clay; and pretty\nwomen walked in it with almost the same calm consciousness of power\nwhich Phryne displayed before her judges. The girl who now entered\nFarnham's library had thrown her shawl over one arm, because the shawl\nwas neither especially ornamental nor new, and she could not afford to\nlet it conceal her dress of which she was innocently proud; for it\nrepresented not only her beautiful figure with few reserves, but also\nher skill and taste and labor. She had cut the pattern out of an\nillustrated newspaper, had fashioned and sewed it with her own hands;\nshe knew that it fitted her almost as well as her own skin; and\nalthough the material was cheap and rather flimsy, the style was very\nnearly the same as that worn the same day on the Boulevard of the\nItalians. Her costume was completed by a pair of eyeglasses with steel\nrims, which looked odd on her rosy young face.\n\n\"I didn't send in my name,\" she began with a hurried and nervous\nutterance, which she was evidently trying to make easy and dashing.\n\"because you did not know me from Adam----I have been trying to see you\nfor some time,\" she continued.\n\n\"It has been my loss that you have not succeeded. Allow me to give you\na chair.\"\n\nShe flushed and seemed not at all comfortable. This grave young man\ncould not be laughing at her; of course not; she was good-looking and\nhad on a new dress; but she felt all her customary assurance leaving\nher, and was annoyed. She tried to call up an easy and gay demeanor,\nbut the effort was not entirely successful. She said, \"I called this\nmorning--it may surprise you to receive a visit from a young lady----\"\n\n\"I am too much pleased to leave room for surprise.\"\n\nShe looked sharply at him to see if she were being derided, but through\nher glasses she perceived no derision in his smile. He was saying to\nhimself, \"This is a very beautiful girl who wants to beg or to borrow.\nI wonder whether it is for herself or for some 'Committee'? The longer\nshe talks the more I shall have to give. But I do not believe she is\nnear-sighted.\"\n\nShe plucked up her courage and said:\n\n\"My name is Miss Maud Matchin.\"\n\nFarnham bowed, and rejoined:\n\n\"My name is----\"\n\nShe laughed outright, and said:\n\n\"I know well enough what your name is, or why should I have come here?\nEverybody knows the elegant Mr. Farnham.\"\n\nThe smile faded from his face. \"She is more ill-bred than I suspected,\"\nhe thought; \"we will condense this interview.\"\n\nHe made no reply to her compliment, but looked steadily at her, waiting\nto hear what she wanted, and thinking it was a pity she was so vulgar,\nfor she looked like the huntress Diana.\n\nHer eyes fell under his glance, which was not at all reassuring. She\nsaid in almost a humble tone:\n\n\"I have come to ask a great favor of you. I am in a good deal of\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Let us see what it is, and what we can do,\" said Farnham, and there\nwas no longer any banter in his voice.\n\nShe looked up with sudden pleasure, and her glasses fell from her eyes.\nShe did not replace them, but, clasping her hands tightly together,\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, sir, if you can do anything for me----But I don't want to make you\nthink----\" She paused in evident confusion, and Farnham kindly\ninterposed.\n\n\"What I may think is not of any consequence just now. What is it you\nwant, and how can I be of service to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is a long story, and I thought it was so easy to tell, and I\nfind it isn't easy a bit. I want to do something--to help my parents--I\nmean they do not need any help--but they can't help me. I have tried\nlots of things.\" She was now stammering and blushing in a way that made\nher hate herself mortally, and the innocent man in front of her tenfold\nmore, but she pushed on manfully and concluded, \"I thought may be you\ncould help me get something I would like.\"\n\n\"What would you like?\"\n\n\"Most anything. I am a graduate of the high school. I write a good\nhand, but I don't like figures well enough to clerk. I hear there are\nplenty of good places in Washington.\"\n\n\"I could do nothing for you if there were. But you are wrong: there are\nno good places in Washington, from the White House down.\"\n\n\"Well, you are president of the Library Board, ain't you?\" asked the\nhigh-school graduate. \"I think I would like to be one of the\nlibrarians.\"\n\n\"Why would you like that?\"\n\n\"Oh, the work is light, I suppose, and you see people, and get plenty\nof time for reading, and the pay is better than I could get at anything\nelse. The fact is,\" she began to gain confidence as she talked, \"I\ndon't want to go on in the old humdrum way forever, doing housework and\nsewing, and never getting a chance at anything better. I have enough to\neat and to wear at home, but the soul has some claims too, and I long\nfor the contact of higher natures than those by whom I am now\nsurrounded. I want opportunities for self-culture, for intercourse with\nkindred spirits, for the attainment of a higher destiny.\"\n\nShe delivered these swelling words with great fluency, mentally\ncongratulating herself that she had at last got fairly started, and\nwishing she could have struck into that vein at the beginning. Farnham\nwas listening to her with more of pain than amusement, saying to\nhimself: \"The high school has evidently spoiled her for her family and\nfriends, and fitted her for nothing else.\"\n\n\"I do not know that there is a vacancy in the library.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, there is,\" she rejoined, briskly; \"I have been to see the\nlibrarian himself, and I flatter myself I made a favorable impression.\nIn fact, the old gentleman seemed really smitten.\"\n\n\"That is quite possible,\" said Farnham. \"But I hope you will not amuse\nyourself by breaking his heart.\"\n\n\"I can't promise. He must look out for his own heart.\" She had regained\nher saucy ease, and evidently enjoyed the turn the conversation was\ntaking. \"I find my hands full taking care of myself.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure you can do that?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir!\" This was said with pouting lips, half-shut eyes, the\nhead thrown back, the chin thrust forward, the whole face bright with\nsmiles of provoking defiance. \"Do you doubt it, Monsieur?\" She\npronounced this word Moshoor.\n\nFarnham thought in his heart \"You are about as fit to take care of\nyourself as a plump pigeon at a shooting match.\" But he said to her,\n\"Perhaps you are right--only don't brag. It isn't lucky. I do not know\nwhat are the chances about this place. You would do well to get some of\nyour friends to write a letter or two in your behalf, and I will see\nwhat can be done at the next meeting of the Board.\"\n\nBut her returning fluency had warmed up Miss Maud's courage somewhat,\nand instead of taking her leave she began again, blushingly, but still\nboldly enough:\n\n\"There is something I would like much better than the library.\"\n\nFarnham looked at her inquiringly. She did not hesitate in the least,\nbut pushed on energetically, \"I have thought you must need a secretary.\nI should be glad to serve you in that capacity.\"\n\nThe young man stared with amazement at this preposterous proposal. For\nthe first time, he asked himself if the girl's honest face could be the\nambush of a guileful heart; but he dismissed the doubt in an instant,\nand said, simply:\n\n\"No, thank you. I am my own secretary, and have no reason for\ndisplacing the present incumbent. The library will suit you better in\nevery respect.\"\n\nIn her embarrassment she began to feel for her glasses, which were\nlying in her lap. Farnham picked up a small photograph from the table\nnear him, and said:\n\n\"Do you recognize this?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It is General Grant.\"\n\n\"It is a photograph of him, taken in Paris, which I received to-day.\nMay I ask a favor of you?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she said, shyly.\n\n\"Stop wearing those glasses. They are of no use to you, and they will\ninjure your eyes.\"\n\nHer face turned crimson. Without a word of reply she seized the glasses\nand put them on, her eyes flashing fire. She then rose and threw her\nshawl over her arm, and said, in a tone to which her repressed anger\nlent a real dignity:\n\n\"When can I learn about that place in the library?\"\n\n\"Any time after Wednesday,\" Farnham answered.\n\nShe bowed and walked out of the room. She could not indulge in tragic\nstrides, for her dress held her like a scabbard, giving her scarcely\nmore freedom of movement than the high-born maidens of Carthage\nenjoyed, who wore gold fetters on their ankles until they were married.\nBut in spite of all impediments her tall figure moved, with that grace\nwhich is the birthright of beauty in any circumstances, out of the\ndoor, through the wide hall to the outer entrance, so rapidly that\nFarnham could hardly keep pace with her. As he opened the door she\nbarely acknowledged his parting salutation, and swept like a huffy\ngoddess down the steps. Farnham gazed after her a moment, admiring the\nundulating line from the small hat to the long and narrow train which\ndragged on the smooth stones of the walk. He then returned to the\nlibrary. Budsey was mending the fire.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" he said, \"Mrs. Belding's man came over to ask,\nwould you dine there this evening, quite informal.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he come in?\"\n\n\"I told him you were engaged.\"\n\n\"Ah, very well. Say to Mrs. Belding that I will come, with pleasure.\"\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nA HIGH-SCHOOL GRADUATE.\n\n\nMiss Matchin picked up her train as she reached the gate, picked up her\ntrain as she reached the gate, and walked down the street in a state of\nmind by no means tranquil. If she had put her thoughts in words they\nwould have run like this:\n\n\"That was the meanest trick a gentleman ever played. How did he dare\nknow I wasn't nearsighted? And what a fool I was to be caught by that\nphotograph--saw it as plain as day three yards off. I had most made up\nmy mind to leave them off anyway, though they are awful stylish; they\npinch my nose and make my head ache. But I'll wear them now,\" and here\nthe white teeth came viciously together, \"if they kill me. Why should\nhe put me down that way? He made me shy for the first time in my life.\nIt's a man's business to be shy before me. If I could only get hold of\nhim somehow! I'd pay him well for making me feel so small. The fact is,\nI started wrong. I did not really know what I wanted; and that graven\nimage of an English butler set me back so; and then I never saw such a\nhouse as that. It is sinful for one man to live there all alone. Powers\nalive! How well that house would suit my complexion! But I don't\nbelieve I'd take it with _him_ thrown in.\"\n\nIt is doubtful whether young girls of Miss Matchin's kind are ever\nquite candid in their soliloquies. It is certain she was not when she\nassured herself that she did not know why she went to Farnham's house\nthat morning. She went primarily to make his acquaintance, with the\nhope also that by this means she might be put in some easy and genteel\nway of earning money. She was one of a very numerous class in large\nAmerican towns. Her father was a carpenter, of a rare sort. He was a\ngood workman, sober, industrious, and unambitious. He was contented\nwith his daily work and wage, and would have thanked Heaven if he could\nhave been assured that his children would fare as well as he. He was of\nEnglish blood, and had never seemed to imbibe into his veins the\nrestless haste and hunger to rise which is the source of much that is\ngood and most that is evil in American life. In the dreams of his early\nmarried days he created a future for his children, in the image of his\nown decent existence. The boys should succeed him in his shop, and the\ndaughters should go out to service in respectable families. This\nthought sweetened his toil. When he got on well enough to build a shop\nfor himself, he burdened himself with debt, building it firmly and\nwell, so as to last out his boys' time as well as his own. When he was\nemployed on the joiner-work of some of those large houses in Algonquin\nAvenue, he lost himself in reveries in which he saw his daughters\nemployed as house-maids in them. He studied the faces and the words of\nthe proprietors, when they visited the new buildings, to guess if they\nwould make kind and considerate employers. He put many an extra stroke\nof fine work upon the servants' rooms he finished, thinking: \"Who knows\nbut my Mattie may live here sometime?\"\n\nBut Saul Matchin found, like many others of us, that fate was not so\neasily managed. His boys never occupied the old shop on Dean Street,\nwhich was built with so many sacrifices and so much of hopeful love.\nOne of them ran away from home on the first intimation that he was\nexpected to learn his father's trade, shipped as a cabin-boy on one of\nthe lake steamers, and was drowned in a storm which destroyed the\nvessel. The other, less defiant or less energetic, entered the shop and\nattained some proficiency in the work. But as he grew toward manhood,\nhe became, as the old man called it, \"trifling\"; a word which bore with\nit in the local dialect no suggestion of levity or vivacity, for Luke\nMatchin was as dark and lowering a lout as you would readily find. But\nit meant that he became more and more unpunctual, did his work worse\nmonth by month, came home later at night, and was continually seen,\nwhen not in the shop, with a gang of low ruffians, whose head-quarters\nwere in a den called the \"Bird of Paradise,\" on the lake shore. When\nhis father remonstrated with him, he met everything with sullen\nsilence. If Saul lost his temper at this mute insolence and spoke\nsharply, the boy would retort with an evil grin that made the honest\nman's heart ache.\n\n\"Father,\" he said one day, \"you'd a big sight better let me alone, if\nyou don't want to drive me out of this ranch. I wasn't born to make a\nnigger of myself in a free country, and you can just bet your life I\nain't a-going to do it.\"\n\nThese things grieved Saul Matchin so that his anger would die away. At\nlast, one morning, after a daring burglary had been committed in\nBuffland, two policemen were seen by Luke Matchin approaching the shop.\nHe threw open a back window, jumped out and ran rapidly down to the\nsteep bluff overlooking the lake. When the officers entered, Saul was\nalone in the place. They asked after his boy, and he said:\n\n\"He can't be far away. What do you want of him? He hain't been doing\nnothing, I hope.\"\n\n\"Nothing, so far as we know, but we are after two fellows who go by the\nnames of Maumee Jake and Dutch George. Luke runs with them sometimes,\nand he could make a pile of money by helping of us get them.\"\n\n\"I'll tell him when he comes in,\" said Saul, but he never saw or heard\nof his son again.\n\nWith his daughters he was scarcely more successful. For, though they\nhad not brought sorrow or shame to his house, they seemed as little\namenable to the discipline he had hoped to exert in his family as the\nboys were. The elder had married, at fifteen years of age, a journeyman\nprinter; and so, instead of filling the place of housemaid in some good\nfamily, as her father had fondly dreamed, she was cook, housemaid, and\ngeneral servant to a man aware of his rights, and determined to\nmaintain them, and nurse and mother (giving the more important function\nprecedence) to six riotous children. Though his child had thus\ndisappointed his hopes, she had not lost his affection, and he even\nenjoyed the Sunday afternoon romp with his six grandchildren, which\nordinarily took place in the shop among the shavings. Wixham, the\nson-in-law, was not prosperous, and the children were not so well\ndressed that the sawdust would damage their clothes.\n\nThe youngest of Matchin's four children was our acquaintance Miss Maud,\nas she called herself, though she was christened Matilda. When Mrs.\nMatchin was asked, after that ceremony, \"Who she was named for?\" she\nsaid, \"Nobody in partic'lar. I call her Matildy because it's a pretty\nname, and goes well with Jurildy, my oldest gal.\" She had evolved that\ndreadful appellation out of her own mind. It had done no special harm,\nhowever, as Miss Jurildy had rechristened herself Poguy at a very\ntender age, in a praiseworthy attempt to say \"Rogue,\" and the delighted\nparents had never called her anything else. Thousands of comely damsels\nall over this broad land suffer under names as revolting, punished\nthrough life, by the stupidity of parental love, for a slip of the\ntongue in the cradle. Matilda got off easily in the matter of\nnicknames, being called Mattie until she was pretty well grown, and\nthen having changed her name suddenly to Maud, for reasons to be given\nhereafter.\n\nShe was a hearty, blowzy little girl. Her father delighted in her\ncoarse vigor and energy. She was not a pretty child, and had not a\nparticle of coquetry in her, apparently; she liked to play with the\nboys when they would allow her, and never presumed upon her girlhood\nfor any favors in their rough sport; and good-natured as she was, she\nwas able to defend herself on occasion with tongue and fists. She was\nso full of life and strength that, when she had no playing to do, she\ntook pleasure in helping her mother about her work. It warmed Saul\nMatchin's heart to see the stout little figure sweeping or scrubbing.\nShe went to school but did not \"learn enough to hurt her,\" as her\nfather said; and he used to think that here, at least, would be one\nchild who would be a comfort to his age. In fancy he saw her, in a neat\nprint dress and white cap, wielding a broom in one of those fine houses\nhe had helped to build, or coming home to keep house for him when her\nmother should fail.\n\nBut one day her fate came to her in the shape of a new girl, who sat\nnear her on the school-bench. It was a slender, pasty young person, an\ninch taller and a year or two older than Mattie, with yellow ringlets,\nand more pale-blue ribbons on her white dress than poor Mattie had ever\nseen before. She was a clean, cold, pale, and selfish little vixen,\nwhose dresses were never rumpled, and whose temper was never ruffled.\nShe had not blood enough in her veins to drive her to play or to anger.\nBut she seemed to poor Mattie the loveliest creature she had ever seen,\nand our brown, hard-handed, blowzy tomboy became the pale fairy's\nabject slave. Her first act of sovereignty was to change her vassal's\nname.\n\n\"I don't like Mattie; it ain't a bit romantic. I had a friend in\nBucyrus whose name was Mattie, and she found out somehow--I believe the\nteacher told her--that Queen Matilda and Queen Maud was the same thing\nin England. So you're Maud!\" and Maud she was henceforward, though her\ntyrant made her spell it Maude. \"It's more elegant with an _e_,\" she\nsaid.\n\nMaud was fourteen and her school-days were ending when she made this\nnew acquaintance. She formed for Azalea Windora one of those violent\nidolatries peculiar to her sex and age, and in a fort-' night she\nseemed a different person. Azalea was rather clever at her books, and\nMaud dug at her lessons from morning till night to keep abreast of her.\nHer idol was exquisitely neat in her dress, and Maud acquired, as if by\nmagic, a scrupulous care of her person. Azalea's blonde head was full\nof pernicious sentimentality, though she was saved from actual\nindiscretions by her cold and vaporous temperament. In dreams and\nfancies, she was wooed and won a dozen times a day by splendid\ncavaliers of every race and degree; and as she was thoroughly false and\nvain, she detailed these airy adventures, part of which she had\nimagined and part read in weekly story-papers, to her worshipper, who\nlistened with wide eyeballs, and a heart which was just beginning to\nlearn how to beat. She initiated Maud into that strange world of vulgar\nand unhealthy sentiment found in the cheap weeklies which load every\nnews-stand in the country, and made her tenfold more the child of\ndreams than herself.\n\nMiss Windom remained but a few months at the common school, and then\nleft it for the high school. She told Maud one day of her intended\nflitting, and was more astonished than pleased at the passion of grief\ninto which the announcement threw her friend. Maud clung to her with\nsobs that would not be stilled, and with tears that reduced Miss\nAzalea's dress to limp and moist wretchedness, but did not move the\nvain heart beneath it. \"I wonder if she knows,\" thought Azalea, \"how\nugly she is when she bawls like that. Few brunettes can cry stylishly\nanyhow.\" Still, she could not help feeling flattered by such devotion,\nand she said, partly from a habit of careless kindness and partly to\nrescue the rest of her raiment from the shower which had ruined her\nneck-ribbon,--\n\n\"There, don't be heart-broken. You will be in the high school yourself\nin no time.\"\n\nMaud lifted up her eyes and her heart at these words.\n\n\"Yes, I will, darling!\"\n\nShe had never thought of the high school before. She had always\nexpected to leave school that very season, and to go into service\nsomewhere. But from that moment she resolved that nothing should keep\nher away from those walls that had suddenly become her Paradise.\n\nHer mother was easily won over. She was a woman of weak will, more\nafraid of her children than of her husband, a phenomenon of frequent\noccurrence in that latitude. She therefore sided naturally with her\ndaughter in the contest which, when Maud announced her intention of\nentering the high school, broke out in the house and raged fiercely\nfor some weeks. The poor woman had to bear the brunt of the battle\nalone, for Matchin soon grew shy of disputing with his rebellious\nchild. She was growing rapidly and assuming that look of maturity which\ncomes so suddenly and so strangely to the notice of a parent. When he\nattacked her one day with the brusque exclamation, \"Well, Mattie,\nwhat's all this blame foolishness your ma's being tellin' me ?\" she\nanswered him with a cool decision and energy that startled and alarmed\nhim. She stood straight and terribly tall, he thought. She spoke with\nthat fluent clearness of girls who know what they want, and used words\nhe had never met with before out of a newspaper. He felt himself no\nmatch for her, and ended the discussion by saying: \"That's all\nmoonshine--you shan't go! D'ye hear me?\" but he felt dismally sure that\nshe would go, in spite of him.\n\nEven after he had given up the fight, he continued to revenge himself\nupon his wife for his defeat. \"We've got to have a set of gold spoons,\nI guess. These will never do for highfliers like us.\" Or, \"Drop in at\nSwillem's and send home a few dozen champagne; I can't stummick such\ncommon drink as coffee for breakfast.\" Or, \"I must fix up and make some\ncalls on Algonkin Av'noo. Sence we've jined the Upper Ten, we mustn't\ngo back on Society.\" But this brute thunder had little effect on Mrs.\nMatchin. She knew the storm was over when her good-natured lord tried\nto be sarcastic.\n\nIt need hardly be said that Maud Matchin did not find the high school\nall her heart desired. Her pale goddess had not enough substantial\ncharacter to hold her worshipper long. Besides, at fifteen, a young\ngirl's heart is as variable as her mind or her person; and a great\nchange was coming over the carpenter's daughter. She suddenly gained\nher full growth; and after the first awkwardness of her tall stature\npassed away, she began to delight in her own strength and beauty. Her\npride waked at the same time with her vanity, and she applied herself\nclosely to her books, so as to make a good appearance in her classes.\nShe became the friend instead of the vassal of Azalea, and by slow\ndegrees she found their positions reversed. Within a year, it seemed\nperfectly natural to Maud that Azalea should do her errands and talk to\nher about her eyes; and Miss Windom found her little airs of\nsuperiority of no avail in face of the girl who had grown prettier,\ncleverer, and taller than herself. It made no difference that Maud was\nstill a vulgar and ignorant girl--for Azalea was not the person to\nperceive or appreciate these defects. She saw her, with mute wonder,\nblooming out before her very eyes, from a stout, stocky, frowzy child,\nwith coarse red cheeks and knuckles like a bootblack, into a tall,\nslender girl, whose oval face was as regular as a conic section, and\nwhose movements were as swift, strong, and graceful, when she forgot\nherself, as those of a race-horse. There were still the ties of habit\nand romance between them. Azalea, whose brother was a train-boy on the\nLake Shore road, had a constant supply of light literature, which the\ngirls devoured in the long intervals of their studies. But even the\nromance of Miss Matchin had undergone a change. While Azalea still\ndreamed of dark-eyed princes, lords of tropical islands, and fierce and\ntender warriors who should shoot for her the mountain eagle for his\nplumes, listen with her to the bulbul's song in valleys of roses, or\nhew out a throne for her in some vague and ungeographical empire, the\nreveries of Miss Maud grew more and more mundane and reasonable. She\nwas too strong and well to dream much; her only visions were of a rich\nman who should love her for her fine eyes. She would meet him in some\nsimple and casual way; he would fall in love at sight, and speedily\nprosper in his wooing; they would be married,--privately, for Maud\nblushed and burned to think of her home at such times,--and then they\nwould go to New York to live. She never wasted conjecture on the age,\nthe looks, the manner of being of this possible hero. Her mind\nintoxicated itself with the thought of his wealth. She went one day to\nthe Public Library to read the articles on Rothschild and Astor in the\nencyclopedias. She even tried to read the editorial articles on gold\nand silver in the Ohio papers.\n\nShe delighted in the New York society journals. She would pore for\nhours over those wonderful columns which described the weddings and the\nreceptions of rich tobacconists and stock-brokers, with lists of names\nwhich she read with infinite gusto. At first, all the names were the\nsame to her, all equally worshipful and happy in being printed, black\non white, in the reports of these upper-worldly banquets. But after a\nwhile her sharp intelligence began to distinguish the grades of our\nrepublican aristocracy, and she would skip the long rolls of obscure\nguests who figured at the: \"coming-out parties\" of thrifty shop-keepers\nof fashionable ambition, to revel among the genuine swells whose\nfathers were shop-keepers. The reports of the battles of the Polo Club\nfilled her with a sweet intoxication. She knew the names of the\ncombatants by heart, and had her own opinion as to the comparative\neligibility of Billy Buglass and Tim Blanket, the young men most in\nview at that time in the clubs of the metropolis.\n\nHer mind was too much filled with interests of this kind to leave any\ngreat room for her studies. She had pride enough to hold her place in\nher classes, and that was all. She learned a little music, a little\ndrawing, a little Latin, and a little French--the French of\n\"Stratford-atte-Bowe,\" for French of Paris was not easy of attainment\nat Buffland. This language had an especial charm for her, as it\nseemed a connecting link with that elysium of fashion of which her\ndreams were full. She once went to the library and asked for \"a nice\nFrench book.\" They gave her \"La Petite Fadette.\" She had read of\nGeorge Sand in newspapers, which had called her a \"corrupter of\nyouth.\" She hurried home with her book, eager to test its corrupting\nqualities, and when, with locked doors and infinite labor, she had\nmanaged to read it, she was greatly disappointed at finding in it\nnothing to admire and nothing to shudder at. \"How could such a smart\nwoman as that waste her time writing about a lot of peasants, poor as\ncrows, the whole lot!\" was her final indignant comment.\n\nBy the time she left the school her life had become almost as solitary\nas that of the bat in the fable, alien both to bird and beast. She made\nno intimate acquaintances there; her sordid and selfish dreams occupied\nher too completely. Girls who admired her beauty were repelled by her\nheartlessness, which they felt, but could not clearly define. Even\nAzalea fell away from her, having found a stout and bald-headed railway\nconductor, whose adoration made amends for his lack of romance. Maud\nknew she was not liked in the school, and being, of course, unable to\nattribute it to any fault of her own, she ascribed it to the fact that\nher father was a mechanic and poor. This thought did not tend to make\nher home happier. She passed much of her time in her own bedroom,\nlooking out of her window on the lake, weaving visions of ignoble\nwealth and fashion out of the mists of the morning sky and the purple\nand gold that made the north-west glorious at sunset. When she sat with\nher parents in the evening, she rarely spoke. If she was not gazing in\nthe fire, with hard bright eyes and lips, in which there was only the\nsoftness of youth, but no tender tremor of girlhood's dreams, she was\nreading her papers or her novels with rapt attention. Her mother was\nproud of her beauty and her supposed learning, and loved, when she\nlooked up from her work, to let her eyes rest upon her tall and\nhandsome child, whose cheeks were flushed with eager interest as she\nbent her graceful head over her book. But Saul Matchin nourished a\nvague anger and jealousy against her. He felt that his love was nothing\nto her; that she was too pretty and too clever to be at home in his\npoor house; and yet he dared not either reproach her or appeal to her\naffections. His heart would fill with grief and bitterness as he gazed\nat her devouring the brilliant pages of some novel of what she imagined\nhigh life, unconscious of his glance, which would travel from her\nneatly shod feet up to her hair, frizzed and banged down to her\neyebrows, \"making her look,\" he thought, \"more like a Scotch poodle-dog\nthan an honest girl.\" He hated those books which, he fancied, stole\naway her heart from her home. He had once picked up one of them where\nshe had left it; but the high-flown style seemed as senseless to him as\nthe words of an incantation, and he had flung it down more bewildered\nthan ever. He thought there must be some strange difference between\ntheir minds when she could delight in what seemed so uncanny to him,\nand he gazed at her, reading by the lamp-light, as over a great gulf.\nEven her hands holding the book made him uneasy; for since she had\ngrown careful of them, they were like no hands he had ever seen on any\nof his kith and kin. The fingers were long and white, and the nails\nwere shaped like an almond, and though the hands lacked delicacy at the\narticulations, they almost made Matchin reverence his daughter as his\nsuperior, as he looked at his own.\n\nOne evening, irritated by the silence and his own thoughts, he cried\nout with a sudden suspicion:\n\n\"Where do you git all them books, and what do they cost?\"\n\nShe turned her fine eyes slowly upon him and said:\n\n\"I get them from the public library, and they cost nothing.\"\n\nHe felt deeply humiliated that he should have made a blunder so\nridiculous and so unnecessary.\n\nAfter she had left the school--where she was graduated as near as\npossible to the foot of the class--she was almost alone in the world.\nShe rarely visited her sister, for the penury of the Wixham household\ngrated upon her nerves, and she was not polite enough to repress her\ndisgust at the affectionate demonstrations of the Wixham babies.\n\"There, there! get along, you'll leave me not fit to be seen!\" she\nwould say, and Jurilda would answer in that vicious whine of\nlight-haired women, too early overworked and overprolific: \"Yes,\nhoney, let your aunt alone. She's too tiffy for poor folks like us\";\nand Maud would go home, loathing her lineage.\n\nThe girls she had known in her own quarter were by this time earning\ntheir own living: some in the manufactories, in the lighter forms of\nthe iron trade, some in shops, and a few in domestic service. These\nlast were very few, for the American blood revolts against this easiest\nand best-paid of all occupations, and leaves it to more sensible\nforeigners. The working bees were clearly no company for this poor\nwould-be butterfly. They barely spoke when they met, kept asunder by a\nmutual embarrassment. One girl with whom she had played as a child had\nearly taken to evil courses. Her she met one day in the street, and the\nbedraggled and painted creature called her by her name.\n\n\"How dare you?\" said Maud, shocked and frightened.\n\n\"All right!\" said the shameless woman. \"You looked so gay, I didn't\nknow.\"\n\nMaud, as she walked away, hardly knew whether to be pleased or not.\n\"She saw I looked like a lady, and thought I could not be one honestly.\nI'll show them!\"\n\nShe knew as few men as women. She sometimes went to the social\ngatherings affected by her father's friends, Odd Fellows' and Druids'\nballs and the festivities with which the firemen refreshed themselves\nafter their toils and dangers. But her undeniable beauty gained her no\nsuccess. She seemed to take pains to avoid pleasing the young\ncarpenters, coachmen, and journeyman printers she met on these\noccasions. With her head full of fantastic dreams, she imagined\nherself a mere visitor at these simple entertainments of the common\npeople, and criticised the participants to herself with kindly sarcasm.\nIf she ever consented to dance, it was with the air with which she\nfancied a duchess might open a ball of her servants. Once, in a round\ngame at a \"surprise\" party, it came her turn to be kissed by a young\nblacksmith, who did his duty in spite of her struggles with strong arms\nand a willing heart. Mr. Browning makes a certain queen, mourning over\nher lofty loneliness, wish that some common soldier would throw down\nhis halberd and clasp her to his heart. It is doubtful if she would\nreally have liked it better than Miss Maud did, and she was furious as\na young lioness. She made herself so disagreeable about it that she\nceased to be invited to those lively entertainments; and some of the\nmost eligible of the young \"Cariboos\"--a social order of a secret and\nmysterious rite, which met once a week in convenient woodsheds and\nstable-lofts--took an oath with hands solemnly clasped in the intricate\ngrip of the order, that \"they would never ask Miss Matchin to go to\nparty, picnic, or sleigh-ride, as long as the stars gemmed the blue\nvault of heaven,\" from which it may be seen that the finer sentiments\nof humanity were not unknown to the Cariboos.\n\nMaud came thus to be eighteen, and though she was so beautiful and so\nshapely that no stranger ever saw her without an instant of glad\nadmiration, she had had no suitor but one, and from him she never\nallowed a word of devotion. Samuel Sleeny, a carpenter who worked with\nher father, and who took his meals with the family, had fallen in love\nwith her at first sight, and, after a year of dumb hopelessness, had\nbeen so encouraged by her father's evident regard that he had opened\nhis heart to Saul and had asked his mediation. Matchin undertook the\ntask with pleasure. Pie could have closed his eyes in peace if he had\nseen his daughter married to so decent a man and so good a joiner as\nSleeny. But the interview was short and painful to Matchin. He left his\ndaughter in possession of the field, and went to walk by the lake shore\nto recover his self-possession, which had given way beneath her firm\nwill and smiling scorn. When he returned to the shop Sleeny was there,\nsitting on a bench and chewing pine shavings.\n\n\"What did she say?\" asked the young fellow. \"But never mind--I see\nplain enough it's no use. She's too good for me, and she knows it.\"\n\n\"Too good!\" roared Saul. \"She's the golderndest----\"\n\n\"Hold on there,\" said Sleeny. \"Don't say nothin' you'll have to take\nback. Ef you say anything ag'in her, you'll have to swaller it, or whip\nme.\"\n\nSaul looked at him with amazement.\n\n\"Well! you beat me, the pair of you! You're crazy to want her, and\nshe's crazy not to want you. She liked to a' bit my head off for\nperposin' you, and you want to lick me for calling her a fool.\"\n\n\"She ain't no fool,\" said Sleeny with sullen resignation; \"she knows\nwhat she's about,\" and lie picked up another shaving and ruminated upon\nit.\n\nThe old man walked to and fro, fidgeting with his tools. At last he\ncame back to the young man and said, awkwardly dusting the bench with\nhis hand:\n\n\"Sam, you wasn't 'lowin' to leave along o' this here foolishness?\"\n\n\"That's just what I was 'lowin' to do, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't you be a dern fool, Sam!\" and Saul followed up this judicious\nexhortation with such cogent reasons that poor Sleeny was glad to be\npersuaded that his chance was not over yet, and that he would much\nbetter stay where he was.\n\n\"How'll _she_ like it?\"\n\n\"Oh! it won't make a mite o' difference to her,\" said the old man\nairily, and poor Sam felt in his despondent heart that it would not.\n\nHe remained and became like the least of her servants. She valued his\nattachment much as a planter valued the affection of his slaves,\nknowing they would work the better for it. He did all her errands;\nfetched and carried for her; took her to church on evenings when she\ndid not care to stay at home. One of the few amusements Saul Matchin\nindulged in was that of attending spiritualist lectures and seances,\nwhenever a noted medium visited the place. Saul had been an unbeliever\nin his youth, and this grotesque superstition had rushed in at the\nfirst opportunity to fill the vacuum of faith in his mind. He had never\nsucceeded, however, in thoroughly indoctrinating his daughter. She\nregarded her father's religion with the same contempt she bestowed upon\nthe other vulgar and narrow circumstances of her lot in life, and so\nhad preferred her mother's sober Presbyterianism to the new and raw\ncreed of her sire. But one evening, when she was goaded by more than\nusual restlessness, Sleeny asked her if she would go with him to a\n\"sperritual lectur.\" To escape from her own society, she accepted, and\nthe wild, incoherent, and amazingly fluent address she heard excited\nher interest and admiration. After that, she often asked him to take\nher, and in the long walk to and from the Harmony Hall, where the\nlong-haired brotherhood held their sessions, a sort of confidential\nrelation grew up between them, which meant nothing to Maud, but bound\nthe heart of Sleeny in chains of iron. Yet he never dared say a word of\nthe feeling that was consuming him. He feared he should lose her\nforever, if he opened his lips.\n\nOf course, she was not at ease in this life of dreamy idleness. It did\nnot need the taunts of her father to convince her that she ought to be\ndoing something for herself. Her millionaire would never come down to\nthe little house on Dean Street to find her, and she had conscience\nenough to feel that she ought to earn her own clothes. She tried to\nmake use of the accomplishments she had learned at school, but was\nastonished to find how useless they were. She made several attempts to\nbe a teacher, but it was soon found that her high-school diploma\ncovered a world of ignorance, and no board, however indulgent, would\naccept her services. She got a box of colors, and spoiled many fans and\ndisfigured many pots by decorations which made the eyes of the beholder\nache; nobody would buy them, and poor Maud had no acquaintances to whom\nshe might give them away. So they encumbered the mantels and tables of\nher home, adding a new tedium to the unhappy household. She answered\nthe advertisements of several publishing companies, and obtained\nagencies for the sale of subscription books. But her face was not hard\nenough for this work. She was not fluent enough to persuade the\nundecided, and she was too proud to sue _in forma pauperis_; she had\nnot the precious gift of tears, by which the travelling she-merchant\nsells so many worthless wares. The few commissions she gained hardly\npaid for the wear and tear of her high-heeled boots.\n\nOne day at the public library she was returning a novel she had read,\nwhen a gentleman came out of an inner room and paused to speak to the\nlibrarian's assistant, with whom Maud was at the moment occupied--a\ngirl whom she had known at school, and with whom she had renewed\nacquaintance in this way. It was about a matter of the administration\nof the library, and only a few words were exchanged. He then bowed to\nboth the ladies, and went out.\n\n\"Who was that?\" Maud asked.\n\n\"Don't you know?\" rejoined the other. \"I thought everybody knew the\nelegant Captain Farnham. He is president of our board, you know, and he\nis just lovely. I always manage to stop him as he leaves a board\nmeeting and get a word or two out of him. It's worth the trouble if I\nonly get a bow.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" assented Maud. \"He is as sweet as a peach. Is\nthere any chance of getting one of those places? I should like to\ndivide those bows with you.\"\n\n\"That would be perfectly splendid,\" said her friend, who was a\ngood-natured girl. \"Come, I will introduce you to the old Doctor\nnow.\"\n\nAnd in a moment Maud was in the presence of the librarian.\n\nShe entered at a fortunate moment. Dr. Buchlieber was a near-sighted\nold gentleman who read without glasses, but could see nothing six feet\naway. He usually received and dismissed his visitors without bothering\nhimself to discover or imagine what manner of people they were. \"I do\nnot care how they look,\" he would say. \"They probably look as they\ntalk, without form and void.\" But at the moment when Maud entered his\nlittle room, he had put on his lenses to look out of the window, and he\nturned to see a perfect form in a closely fit ting dress, and a face\npretty enough to look on with a critical pleasure. He received her\nkindly, and encouraged her to hope for an appointment, and it was in\naccordance with his suggestion that she called upon Farnham, as we have\nrelated.\n\nShe did not go immediately. She took several days to prepare what she\ncalled \"a harness\" of sufficient splendor, and while she was at work\nupon it she thought of many things. She was not even yet quite sure\nthat she wanted a place in the library. The Doctor had been very kind,\nbut he had given her clearly to understand that the work required of\nher would be severe, and the pay very light. She had for a long time\nthought of trying to obtain a clerkship at Washington,--perhaps Farnham\nwould help her to that,--and her mind wandered off among the\npossibilities of chance acquaintance with bachelor senators and\ndiplomats. But the more she thought of the coming interview, the more\nher mind dwelt upon the man himself whom she was going to see--his bow\nand his smile, his teeth and his mustache, and the perfect fit of his\nclothes. One point in regard to him was still vague in her mind, and as\nto that her doubts were soon resolved. One evening she said to her\nfather:\n\n\"Did you ever see Captain Farnham?\"\n\n\"Now, what a foolish question that is I'd like to know who built his\ngreenhouses, ef I didn't?\"\n\n\"He is pretty well off, ain't he?\"\n\nSaul laughed with that satisfied arrogance of ignorant men when they\nare asked a question they can answer easily.\n\n\"I rather guess he is; that is, ef you call three, four, five millions\nwell off. I don't know how it strikes you\" (with a withering sarcasm),\n\"but _I_ call Arthur Farnham pretty well fixed.\"\n\nThese words ran in Maud's brain with a ravishing sound. She built upon\nthem a fantastic palace of mist and cloud. When at last her dress was\nfinished and she started, after three unsuccessful attempts, to walk to\nAlgonquin Avenue, she was in no condition to do herself simple justice.\nShe hardly knew whether she wanted a place in the library, a clerkship\nat Washington, or the post of amanuensis to the young millionaire. She\nwas confused by his reception of her; his good-natured irony made her\nfeel ill at ease; she was nervous and flurried; and she felt, as she\nwalked away, that the battle had gone against her.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTHE WIDOW AND HER DAUGHTER.\n\n\nMrs. Belding's house was next to that of Mr. Farnham, and the\nneighborly custom of Algonquin Avenue was to build no middle walls of\npartition between adjoining lawns. A minute's walk, therefore, brought\nthe young man to the door of Mrs. Belding's cottage. She called it a\ncottage, and so we have no excuse for calling it anything else, though\nit was a big three-storied house, built of the soft creamy stone of the\nBuffland quarries, and it owed its modest name to an impression in the\nlady's mind that gothic gables and dormer windows were a necessary\nadjunct of cottages. She was a happy woman, though she would have been\ngreatly surprised to hear herself so described. She had not been out of\nmourning since she was a young girl. Her parents, as she sometimes\nsaid, \"had put her into black\"; and several children had died in\ninfancy, one after the other, until at last her husband, Jairus\nBelding, the famous bridge-builder, had perished of a malarial fever\ncaught in the swamps of the Wabash, and left her with one daughter and\na large tin box full of good securities. She never afterward altered\nthe style of her dress, and she took much comfort in feeling free from\nall further allegiance to milliners. In fact, she had a nature which\nwas predisposed to comfort. She had been fond of her husband, but she\nhad been a little afraid of him, and, when she had wept her grief into\ntranquillity, she felt a certain satisfaction in finding herself the\nabsolute mistress of her income and her bedroom. Her wealth made her\nthe object of matrimonial ambition once or twice, and she had\nsufficient beauty to flatter herself that she was loved more for her\neyes than her money; but she refused her suitors with an indolent\ngood-nature that did not trouble itself with inquiries as to their\nsincerity. \"I have been married once, thank you, and that is enough\";\nthis she said simply without sighing or tears. Perhaps the unlucky\naspirant might infer that her heart was buried in the grave of Jairus.\nBut the sober fact was that she liked her breakfast at her own hours.\nAttached to the spacious sleeping-room occupied in joint tenancy by\nherself and the bridge-builder were two capacious closets. After the\nfuneral of Mr. Belding, she took possession of both of them, hanging\nher winter wardrobe in one and her summer raiment in the other, and\nshe had never met a man so fascinating as to tempt her to give up to\nhim one of these rooms.\n\nShe was by no means a fool. Like many easy-going women, she had an\nenlightened selfishness which prompted her to take excellent care of\nher affairs. As long as old Mr. Farnham lived, she took his advice\nimplicitly in regard to her investments, and after his death she\ntransferred the same unquestioning confidence to his grandson and heir,\nalthough he was much younger than herself and comparatively\ninexperienced in money matters. It seemed to her only natural that some\nof the Farnham wisdom should have descended with the Farnham millions.\nThere was a grain of good sense in this reasoning, founded as it was\nupon her knowledge of Arthur's good qualities; for upon a man who is\nneither a sot nor a gambler the possession of great wealth almost\nalways exercises a sobering and educating influence. So, whenever Mrs.\nBelding was in doubt in any matter of money, she asked Arthur to dine\nwith her, and settle the vexing questions somewhere between the soup\nand the coffee. It was a neighborly service, freely asked and willingly\nrendered.\n\nAs Farnham entered the widow's cosey library, he saw a lady sitting by\nthe fire whom he took to be Mrs. Belding; but as she rose and made a\nstep toward him, he discovered that she was not in mourning. The quick\ntwilight was thickening into night, and the rich glow of the naming\ncoal in the grate, deepening the shadows in the room, while it\nprevented him from distinguishing the features of her face, showed him\na large full form with a grace of movement which had something even of\nmajesty in it.\n\n\"I see you have forgotten me,\" said a voice as rich and full as the\nform from which it came. \"I am Alice Belding.\"\n\n\"Of course you are, and you have grown as big and beautiful as you\nthreatened to,\" said Farnham, taking both the young girl's hands in\nhis, and turning until she faced the fire-light. It was certainly a\nbonny face which the red light shone upon, and quite uncommon in its\nbeauty. The outline was very pure and noble; the eyes were dark-brown\nand the hair was of tawny gold, but the complexion was of that clear\nand healthy pallor so rarely met with among blonde women. The finest\nthing about her face was its expression of perfect serenity. Even now,\nas she stood looking at Farnham, with her hands in his, her cheek\nflushed a little with the evident pleasure of the meeting, she received\nhis gaze of unchecked admiration with a smile as quiet and unabashed as\nthat of a mother greeting a child.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Farnham, as they seated themselves, \"how long has it\ntaken you to grow to that stature? When did I see you last?\"\n\n\"Two years ago,\" she answered, in that rich and gentle tone which was a\ndelight to the ear. \"I was at home last summer, but you were away--in\nGermany, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we looked for you in vain at Christmases and Thanksgivings.\"\n\n\"Mamma came so often to New York that there seemed no real necessity of\nmy coming home until I came for good. I had so much to learn, you know.\nI was quite old and very ignorant when I started away.\"\n\n\"And you have come back quite young and very learned, I dare say.\"\n\nShe laughed a little, and her clear and quiet laugh was as pleasant as\nher speech.\n\nMrs. Belding came in with gliding footsteps and cap-strings gently\nfluttering.\n\n\"Why, you are all in the dark! Arthur, will you please light that\nburner nearest you?\"\n\nIn the bright light Miss Alice looked prettier than ever; the jet of\ngas above her tinged her crisp hair with a lustre of twisted gold wire\nand threw tangled shadows upon her low smooth forehead.\n\n\"We have to thank Madame de Veaudrey for sending us back a fine young\nwoman,\" said Farnham.\n\n\"Yes, she _is_ improved,\" the widow assented calmly. \"I must show you\nthe letter Madame de Veaudrey wrote me. Alice is first in languages,\nfirst----\"\n\n\"In peace, and first in the hearts of her countrywomen,\" interrupted\nMiss Alice, not smartly, but with smiling firmness. \"Let Mr. Farnham\ntake the rest of my qualities for granted, please.\"\n\n\"There will be time enough for you two to get acquainted. But this\nevening I wanted to talk to you about something more important. The\n'Tribune' money article says the Dan and Beersheba Railroad is not\nreally earning its dividends. What am I to do about that, I should like\nto know?\"\n\n\"Draw your dividends, with a mind conscious of rectitude, though the\ndirectors rage and the 'Tribune' imagine a vain thing,\" Farnham\nanswered, and the talk was of stocks and bonds for an hour afterward.\n\nWhen dinner was over, the three were seated again in the library. The\nfinancial conversation had run its course, and had perished amid the\narid sands of reference to the hard times and the gloomy prospects of\nreal estate. Miss Alice, who took no part in the discussion, was\nreading the evening paper, and Farnham was gratifying his eyes by\ngazing at the perfect outline of her face, the rippled hair over the\nstraight brows, and the stout braids that hung close to the graceful\nneck in the fashion affected by school-girls at that time.\n\nA servant entered and handed a card to Alice. She looked at it and\npassed it to her mother.\n\n\"It is Mr. Furrey,\" said the widow. \"He has called upon _you_.\"\n\n\"I suppose he may come in here?\" Alice said, without rising.\n\nHer mother looked at her with a mute inquiry, but answered in an\ninstant, \"Certainly.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Furrey entered, he walked past Mrs. Belding to greet her\ndaughter, with profuse expressions of delight at her return, \"of which\nhe had just heard this afternoon at the bank; and although he was going\nto a party this evening, he could not help stopping in to welcome her\nhome.\" Miss Alice said \"Thank you,\" and Mr. Furrey turned to shake\nhands with her mother.\n\n\"You know my friend Mr. Farnham?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am--that is, I see him often at the bank, but I am glad to owe\nthe pleasure of his acquaintance to you.\"\n\nThe men shook hands. Mr. Furrey bowed a little more deeply than was\nabsolutely required. He then seated himself near Miss Alice and began\ntalking volubly to her about New York. He was a young man of medium\nsize, dressed with that exaggeration of the prevailing mode which seems\nnecessary to provincial youth. His short fair hair was drenched with\npomatum and plastered close to his head. His white cravat was tied with\nmathematical precision, and his shirt-collar was like a wall of white\nenamel from his shoulders to his ears. He wore white kid gloves, which\nhe secured from spot or blemish as much as possible by keeping the tips\nof the fingers pressed against each other. His speech was quicker than\nis customary with Western people, but he had their flat monotone and\ntheir uncompromising treatment of the letter R.\n\nMrs. Belding crossed over to where Farnham was seated and began a\nconversation with him in an undertone.\n\n\"You think her really improved?\"\n\n\"In every way. She has the beauty and stature of a Brunhild; she\ncarries herself like a duchess, I was going to say--but the only\nduchess I ever knew was at Schwalbach, and she was carried in a wicker\nhand-cart. But mademoiselle is lovely, and she speaks very pretty\nEnglish; and knows how to wear her hair, and will be a great comfort to\nyou, if you can keep the boys at bay for awhile.\"\n\n\"No danger there, I imagine; she will keep them at bay herself. Did you\nnotice just now? Mr. Furrey called especially to see her. He was quite\nattentive to her last summer. Instead of going to the drawing-room to\nsee him, she wants him to come in here, where he is in our way and we\nare in his. That is one of Madame de Veaudrey's notions.\"\n\n\"I should fancy it was,\" said Farnham, dryly; \"I have heard her spoken\nof as a lady of excellent principles and manners.\"\n\n\"Now you are going to side against me, are you? I do not believe in\nimporting these European ideas of surveillance into free America. I\nhave confidence in American girls.\"\n\n\"But see where your theories lead you. In Algonquin Avenue, the young\nladies are to occupy the drawing-room, while the parents make\nthemselves comfortable in the library. But the houses in Dean Street\nare not so spacious. Most citizens in that quarter have only two rooms\nbelow stairs. I understand the etiquette prevailing there is for\nparents, when their daughters receive calls, to spend the evening in\nthe kitchen.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! I see I'm to get no help from you. That's just the way Alice\ntalks. When she came home to-day, there were several invitations for\nher, and some notes from young gentlemen offering their escort. She\ntold me in that quiet way of hers, that reminds me of Mr. Belding when\nhe was dangerous, that she would be happy to go with me when I cared to\ngo, and happy to stay at home if I stayed. So I imagine I am booked for\na gay season.\"\n\n\"Which I am sure you will greatly enjoy. But this Madame de Veaudrey\nmust be a sensible woman.\"\n\n\"Because I disagree with her? I am greatly obliged. But she is a saint,\nalthough you admire her,\" pursued the good-tempered woman. \"She was a\nHamilton, you know, and married Veaudrey, who was secretary of legation\nin Washington. He was afterward minister in Sweden, and died there. She\nwas returning to this country with her three girls, and was shipwrecked\nand they all three perished. She was picked up unconscious and\nrecovered only after a long illness. Since then she has gone very\nlittle into the world, but has devoted herself to the education of\nyoung ladies. She never has more than three or four at a time, and\nthese she selects herself. Alice had heard of her from Mrs. Bowman, and\nwe ventured to write to ask admission to her household, and our request\nwas civilly but peremptorily declined. This was while we were in New\nYork two years ago. But a few days afterward we were at church with\nMrs. Bowman, and Madame de Veaudrey saw us. She called the next day\nupon Mrs. Bowman and inquired who we were, and then came to me and\nbegged to withdraw her letter, and to take Alice at once under her\ncharge. It seems that Alice resembled one of her daughters--at all\nevents, she was completely fascinated by her, and Alice soon came to\nregard her in return as the loveliest of created beings. I must admit I\nfound her a little still--though she _was_ lovely. But still, I cannot\nhelp being afraid that she has made Alice a little to particular; you\nknow the young gentlemen don't like a girl to be too stiff.\"\n\nFarnham felt his heart grow hot with something like scorn for the\nworthy woman, as she prattled on in this way. He could hardly trust\nhimself to reply and soon took his leave. Alice rose and gave him her\nhand with frank and winning cordiality. As he felt the warm soft\npressure of her strong fingers, and the honest glance of her wide young\neyes, his irritation died away for a moment, but soon came back with\ndouble force.\n\n\"Gracious heavens!\" he exclaimed, as he closed the door behind him, and\nstepped into the clear spring starlight, hardly broken as yet by the\nbudding branches of the elms and limes. \"What a crazy woman that mother\nis! Her daughter has come home to her a splendid white swan, and she is\nwaddling and quacking about with anxiety and fear lest the little male\nducklings that frequent the pond should find her too white and too\nstately.\"\n\nInstead of walking home he turned up the long avenue, and went rapidly\non, spurred by his angry thoughts.\n\n\"What will become of that beautiful girl? She cannot hold out forever\nagainst the universal custom. She will be led by her friends and pushed\nby her mother, until she drops to the level of the rest and becomes a\nromping flirt; she will go to parties with young Furrey, and to church\nwith young Snevel. I shall see her tramping the streets with one, and\nwaltzing all night with another, and sitting on the stairs with a\nthird. She is too pretty to be let alone, and her mother is against\nher. She is young and the force of nature is strong, and women are born\nfor sacrifice--she will marry one of these young shrimps, and do her\nduty in the sphere whereto she has been called.\"\n\nAt this thought so sharp a pang of disgust shot through him, that he\nstarted with surprise.\n\n\"Oh, no, this is not jealousy; it is a protest against what is probable\nin the name of the eternal fitness of things.\"\n\nNevertheless, he went on thinking very disagreeably about Mr. Furrey.\n\n\"How can a nice girl endure a fellow who pomatums his hair in that\nfashion, and sounds his R's in that way, and talks about Theedore\nThommus and Cinsunnatta? Still, they do it, and Providence must be on\nthe side of that sort of men. But what business is all this of mine? I\nhave half a mind to go to Europe again.\"\n\nHe stopped, lighted a cigar, and walked briskly homeward. As he passed\nby the Belding cottage, he saw that the lower story was in darkness,\nand in the windows above the light was glowing behind the shades.\n\n\"So Furrey is gone, and the tired young traveller is going early to\nrest.\"\n\nHe went into his library and sat down by the dying embers of the grate.\nHis mind had been full of Alice and her prospects during his long walk\nin the moonlight; and now as he sat there, the image of Maud Matchin\nsuddenly obtruded itself upon him, and he began to compare and contrast\nthe two girls, both so beautiful and so utterly unlike; and then his\nthoughts shifted all at once back to his own early life. He thought of\nhis childhood, of his parents removed from him so early that their\nmemory was scarcely more than a dream; he wondered what life would have\nbeen to him if they had been spared. Then his school-days came up\nbefore him; his journey to France with his grandfather; his studies at\nSt. Cyr; his return to America during the great war, his enlistment as\na private in the regular cavalry, his promotion to a lieutenancy three\ndays afterward, his service through the terrible campaign of the\nPeninsula, his wounds at Gettysburg, and at last the grand review of\nthe veterans in front of the White House when the war was over.\n\nBut this swift and brilliant panorama did not long delay his musing\nfancy. A dull smart like that of a healing wound drew his mind to a\nsuccession of scenes on the frontier. He dwelt with that strange\nfascination which belongs to the memory of hardships--and which we are\nall too apt to mistake for regret--upon his life of toil and danger in\nthe wide desolation of the West. There he met, one horrible winter, the\nsister-in-law of a brother captain, a tall, languid, ill-nourished girl\nof mature years, with tender blue eyes and a taste for Byron. She had\nno home and no relatives in the world except her sister, Mrs. Keefe,\nwhom she had followed into the wilderness. She was a heavy burden on\nthe scanty resources of poor Keefe, but he made her cordially welcome\nlike the hearty soldier that he was. She was the only unmarried white\nwoman within a hundred miles, and the mercury ranged from zero to -20\ndegrees all winter. In the spring, she and Farnham were married; he\nseemed to  have lost the sense of there being any other women in the\nworld, and he took her, as one instinctively takes to dinner the last\nlady remaining in a drawing-room, without special orders. He had had\nthe consolation of reflecting that he made her perfectly proud and\nhappy every day of her life that was left. Before the autumn ended,\nshe died, on a forced march one day, when the air was glittering with\nalkali, and the fierce sun seemed to wither the dismal plain like the\nvengeance of heaven. Though Farnham was even then one of the richest\nmen in the army, so rigid are the rules imposed upon our service, by\nthe economy of an ignorant demagogy, that no transportation could be\nhad to supply this sick lady with the ordinary conveniences of life,\nand she died in his arms, on the hot prairie, in the shade of an\noverloaded baggage wagon. He mourned her with the passing grief one\ngives to a comrade fallen on the field of honor. Often since he left\nthe army, he reproached himself for not have grieved for her more\ndeeply. \"Poor Nellie,\" he would sometimes say, \"how she would have\nenjoyed this house, if she had lived to possess it.\" But he never had\nthat feeling of widowhood known to those whose lives have been torn\nin two.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nPROTECTOR AND PROTEGEE.\n\n\nA few days later, Mr. Farnham attended a meeting of the library board,\nand presented the name of Miss Matchin as a candidate for a subordinate\nplace in the library. There were several such positions, requiring no\nspecial education or training, the duties of which could be as well\nfilled by Miss Maud as by any one else. She had sent several strong\nletters of recommendation to the board, from prominent citizens who\nknew and respected her father, for when Maud informed him of her new\nambition, Matchin entered heartily into the affair, and bestirred\nhimself to use what credit he had in the ward to assist her.\n\nMaud had not exaggerated the effect of her blandishments upon Dr.\nBuchlieber. The old gentleman spoke in her favor with great fluency;\n\"she was young, healthy, active, intelligent, a graduate of the high\nschool.\"\n\n\"And very pretty, is she not?\" asked a member of the board,\nmaliciously.\n\nThe Doctor colored, but was not abashed. He gazed steadily at the\ninterrupter through his round glasses, and said:\n\n\"Yes, she is very fine looking--but I do not see that that should stand\nin her way.\"\n\nNot another word was said against her, and a ballot was taken to decide\nthe question. There were five members of the board, three besides\nFarnham and Buchlieber. Maud had two votes, and a young woman whose\nname had not been mentioned received the other three. Buchlieber\ncounted the ballots, and announced the vote. Farnham flushed with\nanger. Not only had no attention been paid to his recommendation, but\nhe had not even been informed that there was another candidate. In a\nfew sarcastic words he referred to the furtive understanding existing\namong the majority, and apologized for having made such a mistake as to\nsuppose they cared to hear the merits of appointees discussed.\n\nThe three colleagues sat silent. At last, one of them crossed his legs\nanew and said:\n\n\"I'm sure nobody meant any offence. We agreed on this lady several days\nago. I know nothing about her, but her father used to be one of our\nbest workers in the seventh ward. He is in the penitentiary now, and\nthe family is about down to bedrock. The reason we didn't take part in\nthe discussion was we wanted to avoid hard feelings.\"\n\nThe other two crossed their legs the other way, and said they\n\"concurred.\"\n\nTheir immovable phlegm, their long, expressionless faces, the dull,\nmonotonous twang of their voices, the oscillation of the three large\nfeet hung over the bony knees had now, as often before, a singular\neffect upon Farnham's irritation. He felt he could not irritate them in\nreturn; they could not appreciate his motives, and thought too little\nof his opinion to be angry at his contempt. He was thrown back upon\nhimself now as before. It was purely a matter of conscience whether he\nshould stay and do what good he could, or resign and shake the dust of\nthe city hall from his feet. Whatever he recommended in regard to the\nadministration of the library was always adopted without comment; but,\nwhenever a question of the sort which the three politicians called\n\"practical\" arose, involving personal patronage in any form, they\nalways arranged it for themselves, without even pretending to ask his\nor Buchlieber's opinion.\n\nThe very fact of his holding the position of chairman of the board was\nwounding to his self-love, as soon as he began to appreciate the\npurpose with which the place had been given him. He and some of his\nfriends had attempted a movement the year before, to rescue the city\nfrom the control of what they considered a corrupt combination of\npoliticians. They had begun, as such men always do, too late, and\nwithout any adequate organization, and the regular workers had beaten\nthem with ridiculous ease. In Farnham's own ward, where he possessed\ntwo thirds of the real estate, the candidates favored by him and his\nfriends received not quite one tenth of the votes cast. The loader of\nthe opposing forces was a butcher, one Jacob Metzger, who had managed\nthe politics of the ward for years. He was not a bad man so far as his\nlights extended. He sold meat on business principles, so as to get the\nmost out of a carcass; and he conducted his political operations in the\nsame way. He made his bargains with aspirants and office-holders, and\nkept them religiously. He had been a little alarmed at the sudden\nirruption of such men as Farnham and his associates into the field of\nward politics; he dreaded the combined effect of their money and their\ninfluence. But he soon found he had nothing to fear--they would not use\ntheir money, and they did not know how to use their influence. They\nhired halls, opened committee-rooms, made speeches, and thundered\nagainst municipal iniquities in the daily press; but Jacob Metzger,\nwhen he discovered that this was all, possessed his soul in peace, and\neven got a good deal of quiet fun out of the canvass. He did not take\nthe trouble to be angry at the men who were denouncing him, and\nsupplied Farnham with beefsteaks unusually tender and juicy, while the\nyoung reformer was seeking his political life.\n\n\"Lord love you,\" he said to Budsey, as he handed him a delicious\nrib-roast the day before election. \"There's nothing I like so much as\nto see young men o' property go into politics. We need 'em. Of course,\nI wisht the Cap'n was on my side; but anyhow, I'm glad to see him\ntakin' an interest.\"\n\nHe knew well enough the way the votes would run; that every grog-shop\nin the ward was his recruiting station; that all Farnham's tenants\nwould vote against their landlord; that even the respectable Budsey and\nthe prim Scotch gardener were sure for him against their employer.\nFarnham's conscience which had roused him to this effort against\nMetzger's corrupt rule, would not permit him to ask for the votes of\nhis own servants and tenants, and he would have regarded it as simply\ninfamous to spend money to secure the floating crowd of publicans and\nsinners who formed the strength of Jacob.\n\nHis failure was so complete and unexpected that there seemed to him\nsomething of degradation in it, and in a fit of uncontrollable disgust\nhe sailed for Europe the week afterward. Metzger took his victory\ngood-naturedly as a matter of course, and gave his explanation of it\nto a reporter of the \"Bale-Fire\" who called to interview him.\n\n\"Mr. Farnham, who led the opposition to our organize-ation, is a young\ngen'l'man of fine talents and high character. I ain't got a word to say\nagainst him. The only trouble is, he lacks practical experience, and he\nain't got no pers'nal magn'tism. Now I'm one of the people, I know what\nthey want, and on that line I carried the ward against a combine-ation\nof all the wealth and aristocracy of Algonkin Av'noo.\"\n\nJacob's magnanimity did not rest with merely a verbal acknowledgment of\nFarnham's merits. While he was abroad some of the city departments were\nreorganized, and Farnham on his return found himself, through Metzger's\nintervention, chairman of the library board. With characteristic\nsagacity the butcher kept himself in the background, and the committee\nwho waited upon Farnham to ask him to accept the appointment placed it\nentirely upon considerations of the public good. His sensitive\nconscience would not permit him to refuse a duty thus imposed, and so\nwith many inward qualms he assumed a chair in the vile municipal\ngovernment he had so signally failed to overthrow. He had not long\noccupied it, when he saw to what his selection was attributable. He was\na figure-head and he knew it, but he saw no decent escape from the\nposition. As long as they allowed him and the librarian (who was also a\nmember of the board) to regulate the library to their liking, he could\nnot inquire into their motives or decline association with them. He was\nperfectly free to furnish what mental food he chose to two hundred\nthousand people, and he felt it would be cowardice to surrender that\nimportant duty on any pitiful question of patronage or personal\nsusceptibility.\n\nSo once more he stifled the impulse to resign his post, and the meeting\nadjourned without further incident. As he walked home, he was conscious\nof a disagreeable foreboding of something in the future which he would\nlike to avoid. Bringing his mind to bear upon it, it resolved itself\ninto nothing more formidable than the coming interview with Miss\nMatchin. It would certainly be unpleasant to tell her that her hopes\nwere frustrated, when she had seemed so confident. At this thought, he\nfelt the awakening of a sense of protectorship; she had trusted in him;\nhe ought to do something for her, if for nothing else, to show that he\nwas not dependent upon those ostrogoths. But what could be done for\nsuch a girl, so pretty, so uncultivated, so vulgarly fantastic? Above\nall, what could be done for her by a young and unmarried man?\nProvidence and society have made it very hard for single men to show\nkindness to single women in any way but one.\n\nAt his door he found Sam Sleeny with a kit of tools; he had just rung\nthe bell. He turned, as Farnham mounted the steps, and said:\n\n\"I come from Matchin's--something about the greenhouse.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Farnham. \"The gardener is over yonder at the corner of\nthe lawn. He will tell you what is to be done.\"\n\nSam walked away in the direction indicated, and Farnham went into the\nhouse. Some letters were lying on the table in the library. He had just\nbegun to read them when Budsey entered and announced:\n\n\"That young person.\"\n\nMaud came in flushed with the fresh air and rapid walking. Farnham saw\nthat she wore no glasses, and she gained more by that fact in his\ngood-will than even by the brilliancy of her fine eyes which seemed to\nexult in their liberation. She began with nervous haste:\n\n\"I knew you had a meeting to-day, and I could not wait. I might as well\nown up that I followed you home.\"\n\nFarnham handed her a chair and took her hand with a kindly earnestness,\nsaying,\n\n\"I am very glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she continued; \"but have you any good news for me?\"\n\nThe anxious eagerness which spoke in her sparkling eyes and open lips\ntouched Farnham to the heart. \"I am sorry I have not. The board\nappointed another person.\"\n\nThe tears sprang to her eyes.\n\n\"I really expected it. I hoped you would interest yourself.\"\n\n\"I did all I possibly could,\" said Farnham. \"I have never tried so hard\nfor anybody before, but a majority were already pledged to the other\napplicant.\"\n\nShe seemed so dejected and hopeless that Farnham, forgetting for a\nmoment how hard it is for a young man to assist a young woman, said two\nor three fatal words, \"We must try something else.\"\n\nThe pronoun sounded ominous to him as soon as he had uttered it. But it\nacted like magic upon Maud. She lifted a bright glance through her\ntears and said, like a happy child to whom a new game has been\nproposed, \"What shall we try?\"\n\nSimple as the words were, both of them seemed to feel that a certain\nrelation--a certain responsibility--had been established between them.\nThe thought exhilarated Maud; it seemed the beginning of her\nlong-expected romance; while the glow of kind feeling about the heart\nof Farnham could not keep him from suspecting that he was taking a\nvery imprudent step. But they sat a good while, discussing various\nplans for Maud's advantage, and arriving at nothing definite; for her\nown ideas were based upon a dime-novel theory of the world, and\nFarnham at last concluded that he would be forced finally to choose\nsome way of life for his protegee, and then persuade her to accept it.\n\nHe grew silent and thoughtful with this reflection, and the\nconversation languished. He was trying to think how he could help her\nwithout these continued interviews at his house, when she disposed of\nthe difficulty by rising briskly and saying, \"Well, I will call again\nin a day or two, about this hour?\"\n\n\"Yes, if it suits you best,\" he answered, with a troubled brow. He\nfollowed her to the door. As she went out, she said, \"May I pick a\nflower as I go?\"\n\nHe seized his hat, and said, \"Come with me to the rose-house in the\ngarden, and you shall have something better.\"\n\nThey walked together down the gravel paths, through the neat and\nwell-kept garden, where the warm spring sunshine was calling life out\nof the tender turf, and the air was full of delicate odors. She seemed\nas gay and happy as a child on a holiday. Her disappointment of an hour\nago was all gone in the feeling that Arthur was interested in her, was\ncaring for her future. Without any definite hopes or dreams, she felt\nas if the world was suddenly grown richer and wider. Something good was\ncoming to her certainly, something good had come; for was she not\nwalking in this lovely garden with its handsome proprietor, who was,\nshe even began to think, her friend? The turf was as soft, the air as\nmild, the sun as bright as in any of her romances, and the figure of\nFarnham's wealth which she had heard from her father rang musically in\nher mind.\n\nThey went into the rose-house, and he gave her two or three splendid\nsatiny Marechal Niels, and then a Jacqueminot, so big, so rich and\nlustrous in its dark beauty, that she could not help crying out with\ndelight. He was pleased with her joy, and gave her another, \"for your\nhair,\" he said. She colored with pleasure till her cheek was like the\nroyal flower. \"Hallo!\" thought Farnham to himself, \"she does not take\nthese things as a matter of course.\" When they came into the garden\nagain, he made the suggestion which had been in his mind for the last\nhalf hour.\n\n\"If you are going home, the nearest way will be by the garden gate into\nBishop's Lane. It is only a minute from there to Dean Street.\"\n\n\"Why, that would be perfectly lovely. But where is the gate?\"\n\n\"I will show you.\" They walked together to the lower end of the lawn,\nwhere a long line of glass houses built against the high wall which\nseparated the garden from the street called Bishop's Lane, sheltered\nthe grapes and the pine-apples. At the end of this conservatory, in the\nwall, was a little door of thin but strong steel plates, concealed from\nsight by a row of pear trees. Farnham opened it, and said, \"If you\nlike, you can come in by this way. It is never locked in the daytime.\nIt will save you a long walk.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" she replied. \"That will be perfectly lovely.\"\n\nHer resources of expression were not copious, but her eyes and her\nmouth spoke volumes of joy and gratitude. Her hands were full of roses,\nand as she raised her beautiful face to him with pleasure flashing from\nher warm cheeks and lips and eyes, she seemed to exhale something of\nthe vigorous life and impulse of the spring sunshine. Farnham felt that\nhe had nothing to do but stoop and kiss the blooming flower-like face,\nand in her exalted condition she would have thought little more of it\nthan a blush-rose thinks of the same treatment.\n\nBut he refrained, and said \"Good morning,\" because she seemed in no\nmood to say it first.\n\n\"Good-by, for a day or two,\" she said, gayly, as she bent her head to\npass under the low lintel of the gate.\n\nFarnham walked back to the house not at all satisfied with himself. \"I\nwonder whether I have mended matters? She is certainly too pretty a\ngirl to be running in and out of my front door in the sight of all the\navenue. How much better will it be for her to use the private entrance,\nand come and go by a sort of stealth! But then she does not regard it\nthat way. She is so ignorant of this wicked world that it seems to her\nmerely a saving of ten minutes' walk around the block. Well! all there\nis of it, I must find a place for her before she domesticates herself\nhere.\"\n\nThe thought of what should be done with her remained persistently with\nhim and kept him irritated by the vision of her provoking and useless\nbeauty. \"If she were a princess,\" he thought, \"all the poets would be\ntwanging their lyres about her, all the artists would be dying to paint\nher; she would have songs made to her, and sacred oratorios given under\nher patronage. She would preside at church fairs and open the dance at\ncharity balls. If I could start her in life as a princess, the thing\nwould go on wheels. But to earn her own living--that is a trade of\nanother complexion. She has not breeding or education enough for a\ngoverness: she is not clever enough to write or paint; she is not\nsteady enough, to keep accounts,--by the Great Jornada! I have a\ngrievous contract on my hands.\"\n\nHe heard the sound of hoofs outside his window, and, looking out, saw\nhis groom holding a young brown horse by the bridle, the well-groomed\ncoat of the animal shining in the warm sunlight. In a few moments\nFarnham was in the saddle and away. For awhile he left his perplexities\nbehind, in the pleasure of rapid motion and fresh air. But he drew rein\nhalf an hour afterward at Acland Falls, and the care that had sat on\nthe crupper came to the front again. \"As a last resort,\" he said, \"I\ncan persuade her she has a voice, and send her to Italy, and keep her\nthe rest of her life cultivating it in Milan.\"\n\nAll unconscious of the anxiety she was occasioning, Maud walked home\nwith her feet scarcely aware of the pavement. She felt happy through\nand through. There was little thought, and we may say little\nselfishness in the vague joy that filled her. The flowers she held in\nher hands recalled the faint odors she had inhaled in Farnham's house;\nthey seemed to her a concrete idea of luxury. Her mind was crowded and\nwarmed with every detail of her visit: the dim, wide hall; the white\ncravat of Budsey; the glimpse she caught of the dining-room through the\nopen door; the shimmer of cut glass and porcelain; the rich softness of\nthe carpets and rugs, the firelight dancing on the polished brass, the\ntender glow of light and repose of shadow on the painted walls and\nceilings; the walk in the trim garden, amid the light and fragrance of\nthe spring; the hot air of the rose-house, which held her close, and\nmade her feel faint and flushed, like a warm embrace; and through all\nthe ever-present image of the young man, with his pleasant,\nunembarrassed smile, the white teeth shining under the dark mustache;\nthe eyes that seemed to see through her, and yet told her nothing; and\nmore than all this to poor Maud, the perfect fit and fashion of his\nclothes, filled her with a joyous trouble. She could not dwell upon her\nplans for employment. She felt as if she had found her mission, her\ntrue trade,--which was to walk in gardens and smell hot-house roses.\nThe perplexities which filled Farnham's head as to what he should do\nwith her found no counterpart in hers. She had stopped thinking and\nplanning; things were going very well with her as it was. She had lost\nthe place she had wished and expected, and yet this was the pleasantest\nday of her life. Her responsibility seemed shifted to stronger hands.\nIt had become Farnham's business to find something nice for her: this\nwould be easy for him; he belonged to the class to whom everything is\neasy. She did not even trouble herself to think what it would be as she\nloitered home in the sunshine. She saw her father and informed him in a\nfew words of her failure; then went to her room and sat down by her\nwindow, and looked for hours at the sparkling lake.\n\nShe was called to supper in the midst of her reverie. She was just\nsaying to herself, \"If there was just one man and one woman in the\nworld, and I had the picking out of the man and the woman, this world\nwould suit me pretty well.\" She resented being called into other\nsociety than that of her idle thoughts, and sat silent through supper,\ntrying to keep the thread of her fancies from breaking. But she was not\nallowed to go back undisturbed to her fool's paradise.\n\nSleeny, who had scarcely removed his eyes from her during the meal,\nrose with a start as she walked into the little sitting-room of the\nfamily, and followed her. She went to the window with a novel to make\nuse of the last moments of daylight. He stood before her without\nspeaking, until she raised her eyes, and said sharply:\n\n\"Well, Sam, what's the matter?\"\n\nHe was not quick either of thought or speech. He answered:\n\n\"Oh! nothin'. Only----\"\n\n\"Only what?\" she snapped.\n\n\"Won't you go and take a walk by the Bluff?\"\n\nShe threw down her book at once. She liked exercise and fresh air, and\nalways walked with pleasure by the lake. Sam was to her such a nullity\nthat she enjoyed his company almost as much as being alone. She was\nready in a moment, and a short walk brought them to the little open\nplace reserved for public use, overlooking the great fresh-water sea.\nThere were a few lines of shade trees and a few seats, and nothing\nmore; yet the plantation was called Bluff Park, and it was much\nfrequented on holidays and Sundays by nurses and their charges. It was\nin no sense a fashionable resort, or Maud would never have ventured\nthere in company with her humble adorer. But among the jovial puddlers\nand brake-men that took the air there, it was well enough to have an\nescort so devoted and so muscular. So pretty a woman could scarcely\nhave walked alone in Bluff Park without insulting approaches. Maud\nwould hardly have nodded to Sleeny on Algonquin Avenue, for fear some\nmillionaire might see it casually, and scorn them both. But on the\nBluff she was safe from such accidents, and she sometimes even took his\narm, and made him too happy to talk. They would walk together for an\nhour, he dumb with audacious hopes that paralyzed his speech, and she\ndreaming of things thousands of miles away.\n\nThis evening he was even more than usually silent. Maud, after she had\nworn her reverie threadbare, noticed his speechlessness, and, fearing\nhe was about to renew the subject which was so tiresome, suddenly\nstopped and said:\n\n\"What a splendid sunset! Did you ever see anything like it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, with his gentle drawl. \"Less set here, and look at it.\"\n\nHe took his seat on one of the iron benches painted green, and\ndecorated with castings of grapes and vine leaves. She sat down beside\nhim and gazed out over the placid water, on which the crimson clouds\ncast a mellow glory. The sky seemed like another sea, stretching off\ninto infinite distance, and strewn with continents of fiery splendor.\nMaud looked straight forward to the clear horizon line, marking the\nflight of ships whose white sails were dark against the warm brightness\nof the illumined water. But no woman ever looked so straight before her\nas not to observe the man beside her, and she knew, without moving her\neyes from the spectacle of the sunset, that Sam was gazing fixedly at\nher, with pain and trouble in his face. At last, he said, in a timid,\nchoking voice,\n\n\"Mattie!\"\n\nShe did not turn her face, but answered:\n\n\"If it ain't too much trouble, I'd like to have you call me Miss when\nwe're alone. You'll be forgetting yourself, and calling me Mattie\nbefore other people, before you know it.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" he burst out. \"Don't talk to me that way to-night--I can't\nstand it.\"\n\nShe glanced at him in surprise. His face was pale and disordered; he\nwas twisting his fingers as if he would break them.\n\n\"Your temper seems to be on the move, Mr. Sleeny. We'd better go home,\"\nshe said quietly, drawing her shawl about her.\n\n\"Don't go till I tell you something,\" he stammered hastily.\n\n\"I have no curiosity to hear what you have to say,\" she said, rising\nfrom her seat.\n\n\"It ain't what you think--it ain't about me!\"\n\nHer curiosity awoke, and she sat down again. Sleeny sat twisting his\nfingers, growing pale and red by turns. At last, in a tremulous voice,\nhe said:\n\n\"_I_ was there to-day.\"\n\nShe stared at him an instant and said:\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Oh, I was there, and I seen you. I was at work at the end of the\ngreenhouse there by the gate when you come out of the rose-house. I was\nwatchin' for you. I was on the lawn talkin' with the gardener when you\nwent in the house. About an hour afterward I seen you comin' down the\ngarden with him to the rose-house. If you had stayed there a minute\nmore, I would ha' went in there. But out you come with your hands full\no' roses, and him and you come to the gate. I stopped workin' and kep'\nstill behind them pear trees, and I heard everything.\"\n\nHe uttered each word slowly, like a judge delivering sentence. His face\nhad grown very red and hot, and as he finished his indictment he drew a\nyellow handkerchief from his pocket and mopped the sweat from his\nforehead, his chin, and the back of his neck.\n\n\n\"Oh!\" answered Maud, negligently, \"you heard everything, did you? Well,\nyou didn't hear much.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" he continued, with a sullen rage, \"I heard every word. Do\nyou hear me? I heard every word.\"\n\nThe savage roughness of his voice made her tremble, but her spirits\nrose to meet his anger, and she laughed as she replied:\n\n\"Well, you heard 'Thank you, sir,' and 'Good-morning.' It wasn't much,\nunless you took it as a lesson in manners, and goodness knows you need\nit.\"\n\n\"Now, look'ye here. It's no use foolin' with me. You know what I heard.\nIf you don't, I'll tell you!\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Paul Pry, what was it?\" said the angry girl, who had\nquite forgotten that any words were spoken at the gate.\n\n\"I heard him tell you you could come in any time the back way,\" Sam\nhoarsely whispered, watching her face with eyes of fire. She turned\ncrimson as the sunset she was gazing at, and she felt as if she could\nhave torn her cheeks with her fingernails for blushing. She was aware\nof having done nothing wrong, nothing to be ashamed of. She had been\nall day cherishing the recollection of her visit to Farnham as\nsomething too pleasant and delicate to talk about. No evil thought had\nmingled with it in her own mind. She had hardly looked beyond the mere\npleasure of the day. She had not given a name or a form to the hopes\nand fancies that were fluttering at her heart. And now to have this\nsweet and secret pleasure handled and mauled by such a one as Sam\nSleeny filled her with a speechless shame. Even yet she hardly\ncomprehended the full extent of his insinuation. He did not leave her\nlong in doubt. Taking her silence and her confusion as an\nacknowledgment, he went on, in the same low, savage tone:\n\n\"I had my hammer in my hand. I looked through the pear trees to see if\nhe kissed you. If he had 'a' done it, I would have killed him as sure\nas death.\"\n\nAt this brutal speech she turned pale a moment, as if suddenly struck a\nstunning blow. Then she cried out:\n\n\"Hold your vile tongue, you----\"\n\nBut she felt her voice faltering and the tears of rage gushing from her\neyes. She buried her face in her hands and sat a little while in\nsilence, while Sam was dumb beside her, feeling like an awkward\nmurderer. She was not so overcome that she did not think very rapidly\nduring this moment's pause. If she could have slain the poor fellow on\nthe spot, she would not have scrupled to do so; but she required only\nan instant to reflect that she had better appease him for the present,\nand reserve her vengeance for a more convenient season.\n\nShe dried her eyes and turned them on him with an air of gentle, almost\nforgiving reproach.\n\n\"Sam! I could not have believed you had such a bad, wicked heart. I\nthought you knew me better. I won't make myself so cheap as to explain\nall that to you. But I'll ask yon to do one thing for me. When we go\nhome this evening, if you see my father alone, you tell him what you\nsaw--and if you've got any shame in you you'll be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\nHe had been irritated by her anger, but he was completely abashed by\nthe coolness and gentleness which followed her burst of tears. He was\nsorely confused and bewildered by her command, but did not dream of\nanything but obeying it, and as they walked silently home, he was all\nthe time wondering what mysterious motive she could have in wishing him\nto denounce her to her father. They found Saul Matchin sitting by the\ndoor, smoking a cob-pipe. Maud went in and Sam seated himself beside\nthe old man.\n\n\"How'd you get along at Farnham's?\" said Saul.\n\nSam started, as if \"the boss\" had read his uneasy conscience. But he\nanswered in his drawling monotone:\n\n\"All right, I guess. That doggoned Scotchman thinks he knows it all;\nbut it'll take nigh on to a week to do what I could ha' done in a day\nor two, if I worked my way.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Saul, \"that ain't none o' your lookout. Do what Scotchee\ntells you, and I'll keep the time on 'em. We kin stand it, ef they\nkin,\" and the old carpenter laughed with the foolish pleasure of a\nsmall mind aware of an advantage. \"Ef Art. Farnham wants to keep a\nhigh-steppin' Scotchman to run his flowers, may be he kin afford it. I\nain't his gardeen.\"\n\nNow was Sleeny's chance to make his disclosure; but his voice trembled\nin spite of him, as he said:\n\n\"I seen Mattie up there.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, tranquilly. \"She went up to see about a place\nin the library. He said there wasn't none, but he'd try to think o'\nsomethin' else that 'ud suit her. He was mighty polite to Mat--give her\nsome roses, and telled her to run in and out when she liked, till he\ngot somethin' fixed. Fact is, Mat is a first-rate scholar, and takes\nwith them high-steppers, like fallin' off a log.\" Saul had begun to\nfeel a certain pride in his daughter's accomplishments which had so\nlong been an affliction to him. The moment he saw a possibility of a\nmoney return, he even began to plume himself upon his liberality and\nsagacity in having educated her. \"I've spared nothin'--Sam--in giving\nher a----\" he searched an instant for a suitable adjective, \"a\ncommodious education.\" The phrase pleased him so well that he smoked\nfor awhile contemplatively, so as not to mar the effect of his point.\n\nSam had listened with, a whirling brain to the old man's quiet story,\nwhich anticipated his own in every point. He could not tell whether he\nfelt more relieved or disquieted by it. It all seemed clear and\ninnocent enough; but he felt, with a sinking heart, that his own hopes\nwere fading fast, in the flourishing prospects of his beloved. He hated\nFarnham not less in his attitude of friendly protection than in that\nwhich he had falsely attributed to him. His jealousy, deprived of its\nspecific occasion, nourished itself on vague and torturing\npossibilities. He could not trust himself to talk further with Matchin,\nbut went away with a growing fire in his breast. He hated himself for\nhaving prematurely spoken. He hated Maud for the beauty that she would\nnot give him, and which, he feared, she was ready to give to another.\nHe hated Saul, for his stolid ignorance of his daughter's danger. He\nhated most of all Farnham, for his handsome face, his easy smile, his\nshapely hands, his fine clothes, his unknown and occult gifts of\npleasing.\n\n\"'Tain't in natur,\" he growled. \"She's the prettiest woman in the\nworld. If he's got eyes, he knows it. But I spoke first, and he shan't\nhave her, if I die for it.\"\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nA PROFESSIONAL REFORMER.\n\n\nSleeny walked moodily down the street, engaged in that self-torture\nwhich is the chief recreation of unhappy lovers. He steeped his heart\nin gall by imagining Maud in love with another. His passion stimulated\nhis slow wits into unwonted action, until his mind began to form\nexasperating pictures of intimacies which drove him half mad. His face\ngrew pale, and his fists were tightly clinched as he walked. He hardly\nsaw the familiar street before him; he had a far clearer vision of Maud\nand Farnham by the garden gate: her beautiful face was turned up to the\nyoung man's with the winning sweetness of a flower, and Sam's irritated\nfancy supplied the kisses he had watched for in the shadow of the\npear-trees. \"I 'most wish't he'd 'a' done it,\" he growled to himself.\n\"I had my hammer in my hand, and I could 'a' finished him then and had\nno more bother.\"\n\nHe felt a hand on his shoulder, and, turning, saw a face grinning a\nfriendly recognition. It was a face whose whole expression was\noleaginous. It was surmounted by a low and shining forehead covered by\nreeking black hair, worn rather long, the ends being turned under by\nthe brush. The mustache was long and drooping, dyed black and profusely\noiled, the dye and the grease forming an inharmonious compound. The\nparted lips, which were coarse and thin, displayed an imperfect set of\nteeth, much discolored with tobacco. The eyes were light green, with\nthe space which should have been white suffused with yellow and red. It\nwas one of those gifted countenances which could change in a moment\nfrom a dog-like fawning to a snaky venomousness.\n\nThe man wore a black hat of soft felt; his clothes were black and\nglistening with use and grease. He was of medium height, not especially\nstout, but still strong and well knit; he moved too briskly for a\ntramp, and his eyes were too sly and furtive to belong to an honest\nman.\n\n\"Well, Samivel!\" he began, with a jolly facetiousness, \"what's your\nnoble game this evenin'? You look like you was down on your luck. Is\nthe fair one unkind?\"\n\nSam turned upon him with an angry gesture.\n\n\"Hold your jaw, or I'll break it for you! Ever since I was fool enough\nto mention that thing to you, you've been cacklin' about it. I've had\nenough of it.\"\n\n\"Go slow, Quaker!\" the man rejoined. \"If you can't take a joke, I'll\nstop jokin'--that settles it. Come along and get a glass of beer, and\nyou'll feel better.\"\n\nThey soon came to a garden near the lake, and sat down by a little\ntable at their beer. The consumers were few and silent. The garden was\ndimly lighted, for the spring came slowly up that way, and the air was\nnot yet conducive to out-door idling. The greasy young man laid a dirty\nhand on the arm of Sleeny, and said:\n\n\"Honor bright, now, old fellow, I didn't mean to rough, you when I said\nthat. I don't want to hurt your feelings or lose your confidence. I\nwant you to tell me how you are gettin' along. You ain't got no better\nfriend than me nowhere.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Sam, sulkily, \"I got nothin' to say. She don't no more care\nfor me than that there mug.\"\n\nThe expression that came over his friend's face at these discouraged\nwords was not one of sympathetic sorrow. But he put some sympathy into\nhis voice as he said:\n\n\"Jest think of that! Such a fine young fellow as you are, too. Where\ncan her eyes be? And I seen you walking this evenin' by the lake just\nlike two robins. And yet you don't get ahead any!\"\n\n\"Not a step,\" said Sam.\n\n\"Anybody in your light, you think? Hullo there, Dutchy, swei glass. Any\nother fellow takin' your wind?\" and his furtive eyes darted a keen\ninterrogation. Sam did not answer at once, and his friend went on:\n\"Why, she don't hardly know anybody but me and you, and, he-he! I\nwouldn't stand no chance at all against you--hum?\"\n\n\"Of course you wouldn't,\" said Sam, with slow contempt, which brought\nthe muddy blood into the sallow cheek in front of him. \"She wouldn't\nlook at you. I'm not afraid of no man, Andy Offitt,--I'm afraid of\nmoney.\"\n\nHe flattered his jealous heart by these words. It was too intolerable\nto think that any mere man should take his sweetheart away from him;\nand though he felt how hopeless was any comparison between himself and\nFarnham, he tried to soothe himself by the lie that they were equal in\nall but money.\n\nHis words startled his friend Offitt. He exclaimed, \"Why, who does she\nknow that's got money?\"\n\nBut Sleeny felt a momentary revolt against delivering to even his\nclosest confidant the name of the woman he loved coupled with the\ndegrading suspicions by which he had been tormented all day. He gruffly\nanswered: \"That's none of your business; you can't help me in this\nthing, and I ain't agoin' to chin about it any more.\"\n\nThey sat for awhile in silence, drank their beer, and ordered more.\nOffitt at last spoke again:\n\n\"Well, I'll be hanged if you ain't the best grit of any fellow I know.\nIf you don't want to talk, a team of Morgan horses couldn't make you. I\nlike a man that can hold his tongue.\"\n\n\"Then I'm your huckleberry,\" said Sleeny, whose vanity was soothed by\nthe compliment.\n\n\"That's so,\" said Offitt, with an admiring smile. \"If I wanted a secret\nkept, I'd know where to come.\" Then changing his manner and tone to an\nexpression of profound solemnity, and glancing about to guard against\nsurprise, he said: \"My dear boy, I've wanted to talk to you a long\ntime,--to talk serious. You're not one of the common kind of cattle\nthat think of nothin' but their fodder and stall--are you?\"\n\nNow, Sam was precisely of the breed described by his friend, but what\nman ever lived who knew he was altogether ordinary? He grinned uneasily\nand answered:\n\n\"I guess not.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Offitt. \"There are some of us laboring men that don't\npropose to go on all our lives working our fingers off to please a lot\nof vampires; we propose to have a little fairer divide than heretofore;\nand if there is any advantage to be gained, we propose to have it on\nthe side of the men who do the work. What do you think of that?\"\n\n\"That's all solid,\" said Sleeny, who was indifferently interested in\nthese abstractions. \"But what you goin' to do about it?\"\n\n\"Do!\" cried Offitt. \"We are goin' to make war on capital. We are goin'\nto scare the blood-suckers into terms. We are goin' to get our rights--\npeaceably, if we can't get them any other way. We are goin' to prove\nthat a man is better than a moneybag.\" He rattled off these words as a\nlistless child says its alphabet without thinking of a letter. But he\nwas closely watching Sam to see if any of these stereotyped phrases\nattracted his attention. Sleeny smoked his cigar with the air of polite\nfatigue with which one listens to abstract statements of moral\nobligations.\n\n\"What are we, anyhow?\" continued the greasy apostle of labor. \"We are\nslaves; we are Roosian scurfs. We work as many hours as our owners\nlike; we take what pay they choose to give us; we ask their permission\nto live and breathe.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a lie!\" Sleeny interrupted, with unbroken calmness. \"Old\nSaul Matchin and me come to an agreement about time and pay, and both\nof us was suited. Ef he's got his heel onto me, I don't feel it\"\n\nOffitt darted a glance of scorn upon the ignoble soul who was content\nwith his bondage; but the mention of Matchin reminded him that he had a\nfinal shot in reserve, and he let it off at once.\n\n\"Yes, Saul Matchin is a laborin' man himself; but look at his daughter.\nShe would die before she would marry a workman. Why?\" and his green\neyes darted livid fire as they looked into the troubled ones of Sleeny.\n\n\"Well, why?\" he asked, slowly.\n\n\"Because she loves money more than manhood. Because she puts up her\nbeauty for a higher bidder than any------\"\n\n\"Now, shet up, will you?\" cried Sam, thoroughly aroused. \"I won't set\nhere and hear her abused by you or any other man. What business is it\nof yours, anyway?\"\n\nOffitt felt that his shot had gone home, and pursued his advantage.\n\n\"It's my business, Sam, because I'm your friend; because I hate to see\na good fellow wronged; because I know that a man is better than a\nmoneybag. Why, that girl would marry you in a minute if you was rich.\nBut because you're not she will strike for one of them rose-water snobs\non Algonquin Avenue.\" Sam writhed, and his wheedling tormentor\ncontinued, watching him like a ferret. \"Perhaps she has struck for one\nof them already--perhaps--oh, I can't say what may have happened. I\nhate the world when I see such doin's. I hate the heartless shams that\ngive labor and shame to the toilers and beauty and luxury to the\ndrones. Who is the best man,\" he asked, with honest frankness, \"you, or\nsome high-steppin' snob whose daddy has left him the means to be a\nloafer all his days? And who would the prettiest girl in Buffland\nprefer, you or the loafer? And you intend to let Mr. Loafer have it all\nhis own way?\"\n\n\"No, I don't!\" Sam roared, like a baited bull. \"Ef any man crosses my\npath, he can find out which is the best man.\"\n\n\"There, that's more like you. But what can you do alone? That's where\nthey get us foul. The erristocrats, the money power, all hang together.\nThe laborin' men fight singly, and alwuz get whipped. Now, we are goin'\nto change that. We are goin' to organize. Look here, Sam, I am riskin'\nmy head in tellin' you this--but I trust you, and I like you, and I'll\ntell you. We _have_ organized. We've got a society in this town pledged\nto the cause of honest labor and against capital--for life or death. We\nwant you. We want men of sand and men of sense, and you've got both.\nYou must join.\"\n\nSam Sleeny was by this time pretty well filled with beer and wrath. He\nfelt himself in a certain sense bound by the weighty secret which\nOffitt had imparted to him and flattered by his invitation. A few\ntouches more of adroit flattery, and the agitator's victory was\ncomplete. Sleeny felt sore and tired to the very heart. He had behaved\nlike a brute to the girl he loved; he had been put clearly in the wrong\nin his quarrel with her, and yet he was certain that all was not well\nwith either of them. The tormenting syllogism ran continually through\nhis head: \"She is the prettiest woman in the world--rich fellows like\npretty women,--therefore--death and curses on him!\" Or sometimes the\nform of it would change to this: \"He is rich and handsome--girls like\nmen who are rich and handsome,--therefore------,\" the same rage and\nimprecations, and the same sense of powerless fury. He knew and cared\nnothing about Offitt's Labor Reform. He could earn a good living by his\ntrade no matter who went to Congress, and he hated these \"chinny\nbummers,\" as he called them, who talked about \"State help and\nself-help\" over their beer. But to-night he was tormented and badgered\nto such a point that he was ready for anything which his tempter might\nsuggest. The words of Offitt, alternately wheedling and excoriating,\nhad turned his foolish head. His hatred of Farnham was easily extended\nto the class to which he belonged, and even to the money which made him\nformidable.\n\nHe walked away from the garden with Offitt, and turned down a filthy\nalley to a squalid tenement house,--called by its proprietor Perry\nPlace, and by the neighbors Rook's Ranch,--to the lodge-room of the\nBrotherhood of Bread-winners, which proved to be Offitt's lodging. They\nfound there a half dozen men lounging about the entrance, who scowled\nand swore at Offitt for being late, and then followed him sulkily up\ntwo flights of ill-smelling stairs to his room. He turned away their\nwrath by soft answers, and hastily lighting a pair of coal-oil lamps,\nwhich gave forth odor more liberally than illumination, said briskly:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have brought you a recruit this evenin' that you will all\nbe glad to welcome to our brotherhood.\"\n\nThe brothers, who had taken seats where they could find them, on a\ndirty bed, a wooden trunk, and two or three chairs of doubtful\nintegrity, grunted a questionable welcome to the new-comer. As he\nlooked about him, he was not particularly proud of the company in which\nhe found himself. The faces he recognized were those of the laziest and\nmost incapable workmen in the town--men whose weekly wages were\nhabitually docked for drunkenness, late hours, and botchy work. As the\nroom gradually filled, it seemed like a roll-call of shirks. Among them\ncame also a spiritual medium named Bott, as yet imperfectly developed,\nwhose efforts at making a living by dark seances too frequently\nresulted in the laughter of skeptics and the confusion of his friends.\nHis forehead and cheek were even then purple with an aniline dye, which\nsome cold-blooded investigator had squirted in his face a few nights\nbefore while he was gliding through a twilight room impersonating the\ntroubled shade of Pocahontas. This occurrence gave, for the moment, a\npeculiarly sanguinary and sinister character to his features, and\nfilled his heart with a thirst for vengeance against an unbelieving\nworld.\n\nAfter the meeting had been called to order, and Sam had taken an oath\nof a hot and lurid nature, in which he renounced a good many things he\nhad never possessed, and promised to do a lot of things of which he had\nno idea, Mr. Offitt asked \"if any brother had anything to offer for the\ngood of the order.\" This called Mr. Bott to his feet, and he made a\nspeech, on which he had been brooding all day, against the pride of\nso-called science, the arrogance of unrighteous wealth, and the\ngrovelling superstition of Christianity. The light of the kerosene lamp\nshone full on the decorated side of his visage, and touched it to a\nferocious purpose. But the brotherhood soon wearied of his oratory, in\nwhich the blasphemy of thought and phrase was strangely contrasted with\nthe ecclesiastical whine which he had caught from the exhorters who\nwere the terror of his youth. The brothers began to guy him without\nmercy. They requested him to \"cheese it\"; they assisted him with\nuncalled-for and inappropriate applause, and one of the party got\nbehind him and went through the motion of turning a hurdy-gurdy. But\nhe persevered. He had joined the club to practise public speaking, and\nhe got a good half hour out of the brothers before they coughed him\ndown.\n\nWhen he had brought his speech to a close, and sat down to wipe his\nstreaming face, a brother rose and said, in a harsh, rasping voice, \"I\nwant to ask a question.\"\n\n\"That's in order, Brother Bowersox,\" said Offitt.\n\nThe man was a powerful fellow, six feet high. His head was not large,\nbut it was as round as an apple, with heavy cheek-bones, little eyes,\nclose-cut hair, and a mustache like the bristles of a blacking-brush.\nHe had been a driver on a streetcar, but had recently been dismissed\nfor insolence to passengers and brutality to his horses.\n\n\"What I want to ask is this: I want to know if we have joined this\norder to listen to chin-music the rest of our lives, or to do\nsomethin'. There is some kind of men that kin talk tell day of\njedgment, lettin' Gabrel toot and then beginnin' ag'in. I ain't that\nkind; I j'ined to do somethin';--what's to be done?\"\n\nHe sat down with his hand on his hip, squarely facing the luckless\nBott, whose face grew as purple as the illuminated side of it. But he\nopened not his mouth. Offitt answered the question:\n\n\"I would state,\" he said glibly, \"the objects we propose to accomplish:\nthe downfall of the money power, the rehabitation of labor, the----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Bowersox interrupted, \"I know all about that,--but what are\nwe goin' to _do?_\"\n\nOffitt paled a little, but did not flinch at the savage tone of the\nsurly brute. He began again in his smoothest manner:\n\n\"I am of the opinion that the discussion of sound principles, such as\nwe have listened to to-night, is among the objects of our order. After\nthat, organization for mutual profit and protection against the minions\nof the money power,--for makin' our influence felt in elections,--for\nextendin' a helpin' hand to honest toil,--for rousin' our bretheren\nfrom their lethargy, which, like a leaden pall----\"\n\n\"I want to know,\" growled Bowersox, with sullen obstinacy, \"what's to\nbe done.\"\n\n\"Put your views in the form of a motion, that they may be properly\nconsidered by the meetin',\" said the imperturbable president.\n\n\"Well, I motion that we stop talkin' and commence doin'----\"\n\n\"Do you suggest that a committee be appointed for that purpose?\"\n\n\"Yes, anything.\" And the chairman appointed Bowersox, Bott, and Folgum\nsuch a committee.\n\nAll breathed more freely and felt as if something practical and\nenergetic had been accomplished. The committee would, of course, never\nmeet nor report, but the colloquy and the prompt action taken upon it\nmade every one feel that the evening had been interesting and\nprofitable. Before they broke up, Sleeny was asked for his initiation\nfee of two dollars, and all the brethren were dunned for their monthly\ndues.\n\n\"What becomes of this money?\" the neophyte bluntly inquired of the\nhierophant.\n\n\"It pays room rent and lights,\" said Offitt, with unabashed front, as\nhe returned his greasy wallet to his pocket. \"The rest goes for\npropagatin' our ideas, and especially for influencin' the press.\"\n\nSleeny was a dull man, but he made up his mind on the way home that the\nquestion which had so long puzzled him--how Offitt made his living--was\npartly solved.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTWO MEN SHAKE HANDS.\n\n\nSleeny, though a Bread-winner in full standing, was not yet\nsufficiently impressed with the wrongs of labor to throw down his\nhammer and saw. He continued his work upon Farnham's conservatory,\nunder the direction of Fergus Ferguson, the gardener, with the same\ninstinctive fidelity which had always characterized him. He had his\nintervals of right feeling and common sense, when he reflected that\nFarnham had done him no wrong, and probably intended no wrong to Maud,\nand that he was not answerable for the ill luck that met him in his\nwooing, for Maud had refused him before she ever saw Farnham. But, once\nin a while, and especially when he was in company with Offitt, an\naccess of jealous fury would come upon him, which found vent in\nimprecations which were none the less fervid for being slowly and\nhaltingly uttered. The dark-skinned, unwholesome-looking Bread-winner\nfound a singular delight in tormenting the powerful young fellow. He\nfelt a spontaneous hatred for him, for many reasons. His shapely build,\nhis curly blond hair and beard, his frank blue eye, first attracted his\nenvious notice; his steady, contented industry excited in him a desire\nto pervert a workman whose daily life was a practical argument against\nthe doctrines of socialism, by which Offitt made a part of his\nprecarious living; and after he had met Maud Matchin and had felt, as\nsuch natures will, the force of her beauty, his instinctive hate became\nan active, though secret, hostility. She had come one evening with\nSleeny to a spiritualist conference frequented by Offitt, and he had at\nonce inferred that Sleeny and she were either engaged to be married or\non the straight road toward it. It would be a profanation of the word\nto say that he loved her at first sight. But his scoundrel heart was\ncompletely captivated so far as was possible to a man of his sort. He\nwas filled and fired with a keen cupidity of desire to possess and own\nsuch beauty and grace. He railed against marriage, as he did against\nreligion and order, as an invention of priests and tyrants to enslave\nand degrade mankind; but he would gladly have gone to any altar\nwhatever in company with Maud Matchin. He could hardly have said\nwhether he loved or hated her the more. He loved her much as the hunter\nloves the fox he is chasing to its death. He wanted to destroy anything\nwhich kept her away from him: her lover, if she had one; her pride, her\nmodesty, her honor, if she were fancy-free. Aware of Sleeny's good\nlooks, if not of his own ugliness, he hated them both for the\ncomeliness that seemed to make them natural mates for each other. But\nit was not in his methods to proceed rashly with either. He treated\nMaud with distant respect, and increased his intimacy with Sleeny until\nhe found, to his delight, that he was not the prosperous lover that he\nfeared. But he still had apprehensions that Sleeny's assiduity might at\nlast prevail, and lost no opportunity to tighten the relations between\nthem, to poison and pervert the man who was still a possible rival. By\nremaining his most intimate friend, he could best be informed of all\nthat occurred in the Matchin family.\n\nOne evening, as Sam was about leaving his work, Fergus Ferguson said:\n\n\"You'll not come here the morn. You're wanted till the house--a bit o'\nwork in the library. They'll be tellin' you there.\"\n\nThis was faithfully reported by Sam to his confessor that same night.\n\n\"Well, you are in luck. I wish I had your chance,\" said Offitt.\n\nSam opened his blue eyes in mute wonder.\n\n\"Well, what's the chance, and what would you do with it, ef you had\nit?\"\n\nOffitt hesitated a moment before replying.\n\n\"Oh, I was just a jokin'. I meant it was such an honor for common folks\nlike us to git inside of the palace of a high-toned cuss like Farnham;\nand the fact is, Sammy,\" he continued, more seriously, \"I _would_ like\nto see the inside of some of these swell places. I am a student of\nhuman nature, you know, in its various forms. I consider the lab'rin'\nman as the normal healthy human--that is, if he don't work too hard. I\nconsider wealth as a kind of disease; wealth and erristocracy is a kind\nof dropsy. Now, the true reformer is like a doctor,--he wants to know\nall about diseases, by sight and handlin'! I would like to study the\nsymptoms of erristocracy in Farnham's house--right in the wards of the\nhospital.\"\n\n\"Well, that beats me,\" said Sam. \"I've been in a lot of fine houses on\nAlgonquin Avenue, and I never seen anything yet that favored a\nhospital.\"\n\nThis dense stupidity was almost more than Offitt could bear. But a\nready lie came to his aid.\n\n\"Looky here!\" he continued, \"I'll tell you a secret. I'm writin' a\nstory for the 'Irish Harp,' and I want to describe the residence of\njess such a vampire as this here Farnham. Now, writin', as I do, in the\ncause of humanity, I naturally want to git my facts pretty near right.\nYou kin help me in this. I'll call to-morrow to see you while you're\nthere, and I'll get some p'ints that'll make Rome howl when they come\nout.\"\n\nSam was hardly educated up to the point his friend imagined. His zeal\nfor humanity and the \"rehabitation\" of labor was not so great as to\nmake him think it a fine thing to be a spy and a sneak in the houses of\nhis employers. He was embarrassed by the suggestion, and made no reply,\nbut sat smoking his pipe in silence. He had not the diplomatist's art\nof putting a question by with a smile. Offitt had tact enough to\nforbear insisting upon a reply.\n\nHe was, in fact, possessed of very considerable natural aptitude for\npolitical life. He had a quick smile and a ready tongue; he liked to\ntalk and shake hands; he never had an opinion he was not willing to\nsell; he was always prepared to sacrifice a friend, if required, and to\nask favors from his worst enemies. He called himself Andrew Jackson\nOffitt--a name which, in the West, is an unconscious brand. It\ngenerally shows that the person bearing it is the son of illiterate\nparents, with no family pride or affections, but filled with a bitter\nand savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship\nof the most injurious personality in American history. But Offitt's\nreal name was worse than Andrew Jackson--it was Ananias, and it was\nbestowed in this way: When he was about six years old, his father, a\nsmall farmer in Indiana, who had been a sodden, swearing, fighting\ndrunkard, became converted by a combined attack of delirium tremens and\ncamp-meeting, and resolved to join the church, he and his household.\nThe morning they were going to the town of Salem for that purpose, he\ndiscovered that his pocket had been picked, and the money it contained\nwas found on due perquisition in the blue jeans trousers of his son\nAndrew Jackson. The boy, on being caught, was so nimble and fertile in\nhis lies that the father, in a gust of rage, declared that he was not\nworthy the name of the great President, but that he should be called\nAnanias; and he was accordingly christened Ananias that morning in the\nmeeting-house at Salem. As long as the old man lived, he called him by\nthat dreadful name; but when a final attack of the trembling madness\nhad borne him away from earth, the widow called the boy Andrew again,\nwhenever she felt careless about her spiritual condition, and the youth\nbehaved himself, but used the name of Sapphira's husband when the lad\nvexed her, or the obligations of the christening came strongly back to\nher superstitious mind. The two names became equally familiar to young\nOffitt, and always afterward he was liable to lapses of memory when\ncalled on suddenly to give his prenomen; and he frequently caused\nhateful merriment among his associates by signing himself Ananias.\n\nWhen Sam presented himself at Captain Farnham's house the next morning,\nhe was admitted by Budsey, who took him to the library and showed him\nthe work he was to do. The heat of the room had shrunk the wood of the\nheavy doors of carved oak so that the locks were all out of position.\nFarnham was seated by his desk, reading and writing letters. He did not\nlook up as Sam entered, and paid no attention to the instructions\nBudsey was giving him. For the first time in his life, Sleeny found\nthat this neglect of his presence was vaguely offensive to him. A week\nbefore, he would no more have thought of speaking to Farnham, or being\nspoken to by him, than of entering into conversation with one of the\nbusts on the book-cases. Even now he had no desire to talk with the\nproprietor of the house. He had come there to do certain work which he\nwas capable of doing well, and he preferred to do it and not be\nbothered by irrelevant gossip. But, in spite of himself, he felt a\nrising of revolt in his heart, as he laid out his tools, against the\nquiet gentleman who sat with his back to him, engaged in his own work\nand apparently unconscious of Sleeny's presence. A week before, they\nhad been nothing to each other, but now a woman had come between them,\nand there is no such powerful conductor in nature. The quiet in which\nFarnham sat seemed full of insolent triumph to the luckless lover, and\nscraps of Offitt's sounding nonsense went through his mind: \"A man is\nmore than a money-bag\"; \"the laborer is the true gentleman\"; but they\ndid not give him much comfort. Not until he became interested in his\nwork did he recover the even beat of his pulse and the genuine\nworkmanlike play of his faculties. Then he forgot Farnham's presence in\nhis turn, and enjoyed himself in a rational way with his files and\nchisels and screwdrivers.\n\nHe had been at work for an hour at one door, and had finished it to his\nsatisfaction, and sat down before another, when he heard the bell ring,\nand Budsey immediately afterward ushered a lady through the hall and\ninto the drawing-room. His heart stood still at the rustle of the\ndress,--it sounded so like Maud's; he looked over his shoulder through\nthe open door of the library and saw, to his great relief, that there\nwere two female figures taking their seats in the softly lighted room\nbeyond. One sat with her back to the light, and her features were not\ndistinctly visible; the other was where he could see three-quarters of\nher face clearly relieved against the tapestry portiere. There is a\nkind of beauty which makes glad every human heart that gazes on it, if\nnot utterly corrupt and vile, and it was such a face as this that Sam\nSleeny now looked at with a heart that grew happier as he gazed. It was\na morning face, full of the calm joy of the dawn, of the sweet dreams\nof youth untroubled by love, the face of Aurora before she met\nTithonus. From the little curls of gold on the low brow to the smile\nthat hovered forever, half formed, on the softly curving lips and over\nthe rounded chin, there was a light of sweetness, and goodness, and\nbeauty, to be read of all men, and perhaps in God's good time to be\nworshipped by one.\n\nBudsey announced \"Mrs. Belding and Miss Halice,\" and Farnham hastened\nto greet them.\n\nIf Sam Sleeny had few happy hours to enjoy, he could at least boast\nhimself that one was beginning now. The lovely face bore to his heart\nnot only the blessing of its own beauty, but also a new and infinitely\nconsoling thought. He had imagined till this moment, in all\nseriousness, that Maud Matchin was the prettiest woman in the world,\nand that therefore all men who saw her were his rivals, the chief of\nwhom was Farnham. But now he reflected, with a joyful surprise, that in\nthis world of rich people there were others equally beautiful, and that\nhere, under Farnham's roof, on terms of familiar acquaintance with him,\nwas a girl as faultless as an angel,--one of his own kind. \"Why, of\ncourse,\" he said to himself, with a candid and happy self-contempt,\n\"that's _his_ girl--you dunderheaded fool--what are you botherin'\nabout?\"\n\nHe took a delight which he could not express in listening to the\nconversation of these friends and neighbors. The ladies had come over,\nin pursuance of an invitation of Farnham's, to see the additions which\nhad recently arrived from Europe to his collection of bronzes and\npottery, and some little pictures he had bought at the English\nwater-color exhibition. As they walked about the rooms, expressing their\nadmiration of the profusion of pretty things which filled the cabinets\nand encumbered the tables, in words equally pretty and profuse, Sleeny\nlistened to their voices as if it were music played to cheer him at his\nwork. He knew nothing of the things they were talking about, but their\ntones were gentle and playful; the young lady's voice was especially\nsweet and friendly. He had never heard such voices before; they are\nexceptional everywhere in America, and particularly in our lake\ncountry, where the late springs develop fine high sopranos, but leave\nmuch to be desired in the talking tones of women. Alice Belding had\nbeen taught to use her fine voice as it deserved and Cordelia's\nintonations could not have been more \"soft, gentle, and low,--an\nexcellent thing in woman.\"\n\nAfter awhile, the voices came nearer, and he heard Farnham say:\n\n\"Come in here a moment, please, and see my new netsukes; I got them at\na funny little shop in Ostend. It was on a Sunday afternoon, and the\nman of the house was keeping the shop, and I should have got a great\nbargain out of him, but his wife came in before we were through, and\nscolded him for an imbecile and sent him into the back room to tend the\nbaby, and made me pay twice what he had asked for my little monsters.\"\n\nBy this time they were all in the library, and the young lady was\nlaughing, not loudly, but musically, and Mrs. Belding was saying:\n\n\"Served you right for shopping on Sunday. But they are adorable little\nimages, for all that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Farnham, \"so the woman told me, and she added that they\nwere authentic of the twelfth century. I asked her if she could not\nthrow off a century or two in consideration of the hard, times, and she\nlaughed, and said I blagued, and honestly she didn't know how old they\nwere, but it was _drole, tout de meme, qu'on put adorer un petit bon\nDieu d'une laideur pareille._\"\n\n\"Really, I don't see how they can do it,\" said Mrs. Belden, solemnly;\nat which both the others laughed, and Miss Alice said, \"Why, mamma, you\nhave just called them adorable yourself.\"\n\nThey went about the room, admiring, and touching, and wondering, with\nthe dainty grace of ladies accustomed to rare and beautiful things,\nuntil the novelties were exhausted and they turned to go. But Budsey at\nthat moment announced luncheon, and they yielded to Farnham's eager\nimportunity, and remained to share his repast.\n\nThey went to the dining-room, leaving Sleeny more than content. He\nstill heard their voices, too distant to distinguish words; but he\npleased himself by believing that there was a tender understanding in\nthe tones of Farnham and Miss Belding when they addressed each other,\nand that it was altogether a family party. He had no longer any feeling\nof slight or neglect because none of them seemed aware of his presence\nwhile they were in the room with him. There was, on the contrary, a\nsort of comfort in the thought that he belonged to a different world\nfrom them; that he and Maud were shut out--shut out together--from the\nsociety and the interests which claimed the Beldings and the Farnhams.\n\"You was a dunderheaded fool,\" he said, cheerfully apostrophizing\nhimself again, \"to think everybody was crazy after your girl.\"\n\nHe was brought down to a lower level by hearing the door open, and the\nvoice of Offitt asking if Mr. Sleeny was in.\n\n\"No one of that name here,\" said Budsey.\n\n\"I was told at Matchin's he was here.\"\n\n\"Oh! the yonng man from Matchin's. He is in the library,\" and Offitt\ncame in, looking more disreputable than usual, as he had greased his\nhair inordinately for the occasion. Budsey evidently regarded him with\nno favorable eye; he said to Sleeny, \"This person says he comes from\nMatchin's; do you know him?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's all right,\" said Sam, who could say nothing less; but when\nBudsey had left them, he turned to Offitt with anything but welcome in\nhis eye.\n\n\"Well, you've come, after all.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Offitt answered, with an uneasy laugh. \"Curiosity gets us all,\nfrom Eve down. What a lay-out this is, anyhow,\" and his small eyes\ndarted rapidly around the room. \"Say, Sam, you know Christy Fore, that\nhauls for the Safe Company? He was telling me about the safe he put\ninto this room--said nobody'd ever guess it _was_ a safe. Where the\ndevil is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's none of my business, nor yours either.\"\n\n\"I guess you got up wrong foot foremost, Sam, you're so cranky. Where\ncan the ---- thing be? Three doors and two winders and a fire-place,\nand all the rest book-cases. By Jinx! there it is, I'll swear.\" He\nstepped over to one of the cases where a pair of oaken doors, rich with\narabesque carving, veiled a sort of cabinet. He was fingering at them\nwhen Sam seized him by the shoulder, and said:\n\n\"Look here, Andy, what _is_ your game, anyhow? I'm here on business,\nand I ain't no fence, and I'll just trouble you to leave.\"\n\nOffitt's face turned livid. He growled:\n\n\"Of all Andylusian jacks, you're the beat. I ain't agoin' to hurt you\nnor your friend Farnham. I've got all the p'ints I want for my story,\nand devilish little thanks to you, neither. And say, tell me, ain't\nthere a back way out? I don't want to go by the dinin'-room door.\nThere's ladies there, and I ain't dressed to see company. Why, yes,\nthis fits me like my sins,\" and he opened the French window, and\nstepped lightly to the gravel walk below, and was gone.\n\nSleeny resumed his work, ill content with himself and his friend. \"Andy\nis a smart fellow,\" he thought; \"but he had no right to come snoopin'\naround where I was at work, jist to get points to worry Mr. Farnham\nwith.\"\n\nThe little party in the drawing-room was breaking up. He heard their\npleasant last words, as the ladies resumed their wraps and Farnham\naccompanied them to the door. Mrs. Belding asked him to dinner, \"with\nnobody but ourselves,\" and he accepted with a pleased eagerness. Sleeny\ngot one more glimpse of the beautiful face under the gray hat and\nfeather, and blessed it as it vanished out of the door. As Farnham came\nback to the library, he stood for a moment by Sam, and examined what he\nhad done.\n\n\"That's a good job. I like your work on the green-house, too. I know\ngood work when I see it. I worked one winter as a boss carpenter\nmyself.\"\n\nIt seemed to Sleeny like the voice of a brother speaking to him. He\nthought the presence of the young lady had made everything in the house\nsoft and gentle.\n\n\"Where was you ever in that business?\" he asked.\n\n\"In the Black Hills. I sawed a million feet of lumber and built houses\nfor two hundred soldiers. I had no carpenters; so I had to make some. I\nknew more about it when I got through than when I began.\"\n\nSleeny laughed--a cordial laugh that wagged his golden beard and made\nhis white teeth glisten.\n\n\"I'll bet you did!\" he replied.\n\nThe two men talked a few minutes like old acquaintances; then Sleeny\ngathered up his tools and slung them over his shoulder, and as he\nturned to go both put out their hands at the same instant, with an\nimpulse that surprised each of them, and said \"Good-morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nGHOSTLY COUNSEL.\n\n\nA man whose intelligence is so limited as that of Sam Sleeny is always\ntoo rapid and rash in his inferences. Because he had seen Farnham give\nMaud a handful of roses, he was ready to believe things about their\nrelations that had filled him with fury; and now, because he had seen\nthe same man talking with a beautiful girl and her mother, the\nconviction was fixed in his mind that Farnham's affections were placed\nin that direction, and that he was therefore no longer to be dreaded as\na rival. He went home happier, in this belief, than he had been for\nmany a day; and so prompt was his progress in the work of deceiving\nhimself, that he at once came to the conclusion that little or nothing\nnow stood between him and the crowning of his hopes. His happiness made\nhim unusually loquacious, and at the supper-table he excited the\nadmiration of Matchin and the surprise of Maud by his voluble history\nof the events of the day. He passed over Offitt's visit in silence,\nknowing that the Matchins detested him; but he spoke with energetic\nemphasis of the beauty of the house, the handsome face and kindly\nmanners of Farnham, and the wonderful beauty and sweetness of Alice\nBelding.\n\n\"Did that bold thing go to call on him alone?\" cried Miss Maud,\nthoroughly aroused by this supposed offence against the proprieties of\nlife.\n\n\"Why, no, Mattie,\" said Sam, a little disconcerted. \"Her ma was along.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so, then?\" asked the unappeased beauty.\n\n\"I forgot all about the old lady, though she was more chinny than the\nyoung one. She just seemed like she was a-practisin' the mother-in-law,\nso as to do it without stumblin' when the time come.\"\n\n\"Hullo! Do you think they are strikin' a match?\" cried Saul, in high\nglee. \"That would be first-rate. Keep the money and the property all\ntogether. There's too many of our rich girls marryin' out of the State\nlately--keeps buildin' dull.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" Maud interposed. \"He ain't a man to be\ncaught by a simperin' schoolgirl. And as to money, He's got a plenty\nfor two. He can please himself when he marries.\"\n\n\"Yes, but may be he won't please you, Mattie, and that would be a\npity,\" said the ironical Saul.\n\nThe old man laughed loudly at his own sarcasm, and pushed his chair\nback from the table, and Maud betook herself to her own room, where she\nsat down, as her custom was, by the window, looking over the glowing\nlake, and striving to read her destiny as she gazed into the crimson\nand golden skies. She did not feel at all so sure as she pretended that\nthere was no danger of the result that Sleeny had predicted; and now\nthat she was brought face to face with it, she was confounded at\ndiscovering how much it meant to her. She was carrying a dream in her\nheart which would make or ruin her, according as it should prove true\nor false. She had not thought of herself as the future wife of Farnham\nwith any clearness of hope, but she found she could not endure the\nthought of his marrying any one else and passing forever out of her\nreach. She sat there, bitterly ruminating, until the evening glow had\ndied away from the lake and the night breeze spread its viewless wings\nand flapped heavily in over the dark ridge and the silent shore. Her\nthoughts had given her no light of consolation; her chin rested on her\nhands, her elbows on her knees; her large eyes, growing more luminous\nin the darkness, stared out at the gathering night, scarcely noting\nthat the sky she gazed at had changed from a pompous scene of red and\nyellow splendor to an infinite field of tender and dark violet, fretted\nwith intense small stars.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she thought. \"I am a woman. My father is poor. I\nhave got no chance. Jurildy is happier to-day than I am, and got more\nsense.\"\n\nShe heard a timid rap at her door, and asked, sharply:\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"It's me,\" said Sleeny's submissive voice.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked again, without moving.\n\n\"Mr. Bott give me two tickets to his seance tonight,\"--Sam called it\n\"seeuns,\"--\"and I thought mebbe you'd like to go.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Maud was thinking: \"At any rate it will\nbe better than to sit here alone and cry all the evening.\" So she said:\n\"I'll come down in a minute.\" She heard Sam's heavy step descending the\nstairs, and thought what a different tread another person had; and she\nwondered whether she would ever \"do better\" than take Sam Sleeny; but\nshe at once dismissed the thought. \"I can't do that; I can't put my\nhand in a hand that smells so strong of sawdust as Sam's. But he is a\ngood soul, and I am sorry for him, every time I look in the glass.\"\n\nLooking in the glass, as usual, restored her good humor, and she\nstarted off to the ghostly rendezvous with her faithful attendant. They\nnever talked very much when they were alone together, and this evening\nboth were thoughtful. Maud had never taken this commerce with ghosts\nmuch to heart. She had a feeling, which she could hardly have defined,\nthat it was a common and plebeian thing to believe in it, and if she\never heard it ridiculed she joined in the cry without mercy. But it was\nan excitement and an interest in a life so barren of both that she\ncould not afford to throw it away. She had not intelligence enough to\nbe disgusted or shocked by it. If pressed to explain the amount of her\nfaith in the whole business, she would probably have said she thought\n\"there was something in it,\" and stopped at that. In minds like hers,\nthere is no clearly drawn line between the unusual and the\nsupernatural. An apparent miracle pleased her as it would please a\nchild, without setting her to find out how it was done. She would\nconsult a wizard, taking the chances of his having occult sources of\ninformation, with the same irregular faith in the unlikely with which\nsome ladies call in homoeopathic practitioners.\n\nAll the way to the rooms of Bott, she was revolving this thought in her\nmind: \"Perhaps he could tell me something about Mr. Farnham. I don't\nthink much of Bott; he has too many knuckles on his hands. I never saw\na man with so many knuckles. I wouldn't mention Mr. Farnham to him to\nsave his life, but I might get something out of him without telling him\nanything. He is certainly a very smart man, and whether it's spirits or\nnot, he knows lots of things.\"\n\nIt was in this mood that she entered the little apartment where Bott\nheld what he called his \"Intermundane Seances.\" The room was small and\nstuffy. A simulacrum of a chest of drawers in one corner was really\nBott's bed, where the seer reposed at night, and which, tilted up\nagainst the wall during the day, contained the rank bedclothes, long\ninnocent of the wash-tub. There were a dozen or so of cane-bottom\nchairs, a little table for a lamp, but no other furniture. At one side\nof the room was a small closet without a door, but with a dark and\ndirty curtain hung before its aperture. Around it was a wooden railing,\nbreast high.\n\nA boy with a high forehead, and hair combed behind ears large and\nflaring like those of a rabbit, sat by the door, and took the tickets\nof invited guests and the half-dollars of the casuals. The seer\nreceived everybody with a nerveless shake of a clammy hand, showed them\nto seats, and exchanged a word or two about the weather, and the\n\"conditions,\" favorable or otherwise, to spiritual activity. When he\nsaw Maud and Sam his tallowy face flushed, in spots, with delight. He\ntook them to the best places the room afforded, and stammered his\npleasure that they had come.\n\n\"Oh! the pleasure is all ours,\" said Maud, who was always\nself-possessed when she saw men stammering. \"It's a great privilege to\nget so near to the truth as you bring us, Mr. Bott.\"\n\nThe prophet had no answer ready; he merely flushed again in spots, and\nsome new arrivals called him away.\n\nThe room was now pretty well filled with the unmistakable crowd which\nalways attend such meetings. They were mostly artisans, of more\nintellectual ambition than their fellows, whose love of the marvellous\nwas not held in control by any educated judgment. They had long,\nserious faces, and every man of them wore long hair and a soft hat.\nTheir women were generally sad, broken-spirited drudges, to whom this\nkind of show was like an opera or a ball. There were two or three\nshame-faced believers of the better class, who scoffed a little but\ntrembled in secret, and a few avowed skeptics, young clerks on a mild\nspree, ready for fun if any should present itself.\n\nBott stepped inside the railing by the closet, and placing his hands\nupon it, addressed the assembly. He did not know what peculiar shape\nthe manifestations of the evening might take. They were in search of\ntruth; all truth was good. They hoped for visitors from the unseen\nspeers; he could promise nothing. In this very room the spirits of the\ndeparted had walked and talked with their friends; perhaps they might\ndo it again; he knew not. How they mingled in the earth-life, he did\nnot pretend to say; perhaps they materialized through the mejum;\nperhaps they dematerialized material from the audience which they\nrematerialized in visible forms; as to that, the opinion of another--he\nsaid with a spacious magnanimity--was as good as his. He would now\nrequest two of the audience to step up and tie him. One of the\nlong-haired ruminant men stood up, and a young fellow, amid much\nnudging and giggling among the scorners, was also forced from his\nchair. They came forward, the believer with a business-like air, which\nshowed practice, and the young skeptic blushing and ill at ease. Bott\ntook a chair inside the curtain, and showed them how to tie him. They\nbound him hand and foot, the believer testified that the binding was\nsolid, and the skeptic went to his seat, playfully stepping upon the\ntoes of his scoffing friends. The curtain was lowered, and the lamp was\nturned down.\n\nIn a few moments, a scuffling sound was heard in the closet, and Bott's\ncoat came flying out into the room. The believer pulled back the\ncurtain, and Botts sat in his chair, his shirt sleeves gleaming white\nin the dust. His coat was laid over his shoulders, and almost as soon\nas the curtain was lowered he yelled for light, and was disclosed\nsitting tied as before, clothed in his right coat.\n\nAgain the curtain went down amid a sigh of satisfaction from the\nadmiring audience, and a choking voice, which tried hard not to sound\nlike Bott's, cried out from the closet: \"Turn down the light; we want\nmore power.\" The kerosene lamp was screwed down till hardly a spark\nillumined the visible darkness, and suddenly a fiery hand appeared at\nthe aperture of the closet, slowly opening and shutting its long\nfingers.\n\nA half dozen voices murmured: \"A spirit hand\"; but Sam Sleeny whispered\nto Maud: \"Them are Bott's knuckles, for coin.\" The hand was withdrawn\nand a horrible face took its place--a pallid corpse-like mask, with\nlambent fire sporting on the narrow forehead and the high cheek-bones.\nIt stayed only an instant, but Sam said, \"That's the way Bott will look\nin----\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Maud, who was growing too nervous to smile, for fear of\nlaughing or crying.\n\nA sound of sobbing came from a seat to the right of them. A poor woman\nhad recognized the face as that of her husband, who had died in the\narmy, and she was drawing the most baleful inferences from its fiery\nadjuncts.\n\nA moment later, Bott came out of the closet, crouching so low that his\nhead was hardly two feet from the ground. He had a sheet around his\nneck, covering his whole person, and a white cap over his head,\nconcealing most of his face. In this constrained attitude he hopped\nabout the clear space in front of the audience with a good deal of\ndexterity, talking baby-talk in a shrill falsetto. \"Howdy, pappa!\nHowdy, mamma! Itty Tudie tum adin!\"\n\nA rough man and woman, between joy and grief, were half hysterical.\nThey talked to the toad-like mountebank in the most endearing tones,\nevidently believing it was their dead baby toddling before them. Two or\nthree times the same horrible imposture was repeated. Bott never made\nhis appearance without somebody recognizing him as a dear departed\nfriend. The glimmering light, the unwholesome excitement, the servile\ncredulity fixed by long habit, seemed to produce a sort of passing\ndementia upon the regular habitues.\n\nWith these performances the first part came to an end. The light was\nturned on again, and the tying committee was requested to come forward\nand examine the cords with which Bott still seemed tightly bound. The\nskeptic remained scornfully in his seat, and so it was left for the\nbeliever to announce that not a cord had been touched. He then untied\nBott, who came out from the closet, stretching his limbs as if glad to\nbe free, and announced that there would be a short intermission for an\ninterchange of views.\n\n\nAs he came toward Maud, Sam rose and said:\n\n\"Whew! he smells like a damp match. I'll go out and smoke a minute, and\ncome back.\"\n\nBott dropped into the seat which Sleeny had left.\n\nTo one who has never attended one of these queer _cenacula_, it would\nbe hard to comprehend the unhealthy and even nauseous character of the\nfeeling and the conversation there prevalent. The usual decent\nrestraints upon social intercourse seem removed. Subjects which the\ncommon consent of civilized creatures has banished from mixed society\nare freely opened and discussed. To people like the ordinary run of the\nbelievers in spiritism, the opera, the ballet, and the annual Zola are\nunknown, and they must take their excitements where they can find them.\nThe dim light, the unhealthy commerce of fictitious ghosts, the\nunreality of act and sentiment, the unwonted abandon, form an\natmosphere in which these second-hand mystics float away into a sphere\nwhere the morals and the manners are altogether different from those of\ntheir working days.\n\nMiss Matchin had not usually joined in these morbid discussions. She\nwas of too healthy an organization to be tempted by so rank a mental\nfeast as that, and she had a sort of fierce maidenhood about her which\nrevolted at such exposures of her own thought. But to-night she was\nsorely perplexed. She had been tormented by many fancies as she looked\nout of her window into the deepening shadows that covered the lake. The\nwonders she had seen in that room, though she did not receive them with\nentire faith, had somewhat shaken her nerves; and now the seer sat\nbeside her, his pale eyes shining with his own audacity, his lank hair\ndripping with sweat, his hands uneasily rubbing together, his whole\nattitude expressive of perfect subjection to her will.\n\n\"Why isn't this a good chance?\" she thought. \"He is certainly a smart\nman. Horrid as he looks, he knows lots. May be he could tell me how to\nfind out.\"\n\nShe began in her airiest manner: \"Oh, Mr. Bott, what a wonderful gift\nyou have got! How you must look down on us poor mortals!\"\n\nBott grew spotted, and stammered:\n\n\"Far from it, Miss Matchin. I couldn't look down on you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are flattering. That's not right, because I believe every word\nyou say--and that ain't true.\"\n\nShe rattled recklessly on in the same light tone.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you something very particular. I don't know who can\ntell me, if you can't. How can a young lady find out whether a young\ngentleman is in love with her or not? Now, tell me the truth this\ntime,\" she said with a nervous titter, \"for it's very important.\"\n\nThis question from any one else would not have disconcerted Bott in the\nleast. Queries as absurd had frequently been put to him in perfect good\nfaith, and answered with ready and impudent ignorance. But, at those\ngiggling words of Maud Matchin, he turned livid and purple, and his\nbreath came heavily. There was room for but one thought in that narrow\nheart and brain. He had long cherished a rather cowardly fondness for\nMaud, and now that this question was put to him by the agitated girl,\nhis vanity would not suffer him to imagine that any one but himself was\nthe subject of her dreams. There was, to him, nothing especially out of\nthe way in this sort of indirect proposal on the part of a young woman.\nIt was entirely in keeping with the general tone of sentiment among the\npeople of his circle, which aimed at nothing less than the emancipation\nof the world from its old-fashioned decencies.\n\nBut he would not answer hastily; he had a coward's caution. He looked a\nmoment at the girl's brilliant color, her quick, high breathing, her\neager eyes, with a gloating sense of his good luck. But he wanted her\nthoroughly committed. So he said, with an air in which there was\nalready something offensively protecting:\n\n\"Well, Miss Matchin, that depends on the speer. If the affection be\nunilateral, it is one thing; if it be recippercal, it is another. The\ncurrents of soul works in different ways.\"\n\n\"But what I mean is, if a young lady likes a young gentleman pretty\nwell, how is she going to find out for sure whether he likes her?\" She\nwent intrepidly through these words, though her cheeks were burning,\nand her eyes would fall in spite of her, and her head was singing.\n\nThere was no longer any doubt in Bott's mind. He was filled with an\ninsolent triumph, and thought only of delaying as long as possible the\nlove chase of which he imagined himself the object. He said, slowly and\nseverely:\n\n\"The question is too imperious to be answered in haste. I will put\nmyself in the hands of the sperruts, and answer it as they choose after\nthe intermission.\"\n\nHe rose and bowed, and went to speak a word or two to his other\nvisitors. Sam came back and took his seat by Maud, and said:\n\n\"I think the fun is about over. Less go home.\"\n\n\"Go home yourself, if you want to,\" was the petulant reply. \"I am going\nto stay for the inspirational discourse.\"\n\n\"Oh, my!\" said Sam. \"That's a beautiful word. You don't know how pretty\nyour mouth looks when you say that.\" Sam had had his beer, and was\nbrave and good-natured.\n\nBott retired once more behind the railing, but took his seat in a chair\noutside the curtain, in full view of the audience. He sat for some\nminutes motionless, staring at vacancy. He then slowly closed his eyes,\nand a convulsive shudder ran through his frame. This was repeated at\nrapid intervals, with more or less violence. He next passed his hands\nalternately over his forehead, as if he were wiping it, and throwing\nsome invisible, sticky substance, with a vicious snap, to right and\nleft. At last, after a final shudder, which stiffened him into the\nimage of death for a moment, he rose to his feet and, leaning on the\nrailing, began to intone, in a dismal whine, a speech of which we need\ngive only the opening words.\n\n\"Dear brothers and sisters of the earth-life! On pearly wings of\ngossamer-down we float down from our shining speers to bring you\nmessages of the higher life. Let your earth-soul be lifted to meet our\nsperrut-soul; let your earth-heart blend in sweet accordion with our\nheaven-heart; that the beautiful and the true in this weary earth-life\nmay receive the bammy influence of the Eden flowrets, and rise, through\nspeers of disclosure, to the plane where all is beautiful and all is\ntrue.\"\n\nHe continued in this strain for some time, to the evident edification\nof his audience, who listened with the same conventional tolerance, the\nsame trust that it is doing your neighbor good, with which the ordinary\naudience sits under an ordinary sermon. Maud, having a special reason\nfor being alert, listened with a real interest. But during his speech\nproper he made no allusion to the subject on which she had asked for\nlight. It was after he had finished his harangue, and had gone through\nan _entr'acte_ of sighs and shudders, that he announced himself once\nmore in the hands of the higher intelligences, and ready to answer\nquestions. \"It does not need,\" he whined, \"the word of the month or the\nspeech of the tongue to tell the sperruts what your souls desire. The\nburden of your soul is open to the sperrut-eye. There sits in this room\na pure and lovely soul in quest of light. Its query is, How does heart\nmeet heart in mutual knowledge?\"\n\nMaud's cheek grew pale and then red, and her heart beat violently. But\nno one noticed her, and the seer went on. \"If a true heart longs for\nanother, there is no rest but in knowledge, there is no knowledge but\nin trewth, there is no trewth but in trust. Oh, my brother, if you love\na female, tell your love. Oh, my sister, if you love--hum--if you\nlove--hum--an individual of the opposite sex--oh, tell your love!--Down\nwith the shams of a false-hearted society; down with the chains of\nsilence that crushes your soul to the dust! If the object of your\nhearts' throbs is noble, he will respond. Love claims love. Love has a\nright to love. If he is base, go to a worthier one. But from your brave\nand fiery heart a light will kindle his, and dual flames will wrap two\nchosen natures in high-menial melodies, when once the revelating word\nis spoke.\"\n\nWith these words he subsided into a deep trance, which lasted till the\nfaithful grew tired of waiting, and shuffled slowly out of the door.\nWhen the last guest had gone, he rose from his chair, with no pretence\nof spiritual dignity, and counted his money and his tickets. He\nstretched himself in two chairs, drew his fingers admiringly through\nhis lank locks, while a fatuous grin of perfect content spread over his\nface, as he said aloud to himself, \"She has got it bad. I wonder\nwhether she will have the nerve to ask me. I'll wait awhile, anyhow.\nI'll lose nothing by waiting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Maud was walking rapidly home with Sam. She was excited and\nperplexed, and did not care to answer Sam's rather heavy pleasantries\nover the evening's performance. He ridiculed the spirit-lights, the\nvoices, and the jugglery, without provoking a reply, and at last he\nsaid:\n\n\"Well, what do you think of his advising the girls to pop? This ain't\nleap year!\"\n\n\"What of that?\" she answered, hastily. \"I don't see why a girl hasn't\nas good a right to speak her mind as a man.\"\n\n\"Why, Mattie,\" said Sam, with slow surprise, \"no decent girl would do\nthat.\"\n\nThey had come to Matchin's gate. She slipped in, then turned and said:\n\n\"Well, don't be frightened, Mr. Sleeny; I'm not going to propose to\nyou,\" and she was gone from his sight.\n\nShe went directly to her room, and walked up and down a few moments\nwithout taking off her hat, moving with the easy grace and the\nsuppressed passion of an imprisoned panther. Then she lighted her lamp\nand placed it on her bureau at one side of her glass. She searched in\nher closet and found a candle, which she lighted and placed on the\nother side of the glass. She undressed with reckless haste, throwing\nher clothes about on the floor, and sat down before her mirror with\nbare arms and shoulders, and nervously loosened her hair, watching\nevery movement with blazing eyes. The thick masses of her blue-black\ncurls fell down her back and over her sloping shoulders, which glowed\nwith the creamy light of old ivory. The unequal rays of the lamp and\ncandle made singular effects of shadow on the handsome face, the\nfloating hair, and the strong and wholesome color of her neck and arms.\nShe gazed at herself with eager eyes and parted lips, in an anxiety too\ngreat to be assuaged by her girlish pride in her own beauty. \"This is\nall very well,\" she said, \"but he will not see me this way. Oh! if I\nonly dared to speak first. I wonder if it would be as the spirits said.\n'If he is noble he will respond!' He _is_ noble, that's sure. 'Love\nclaims love,' they said. But I don't know as I love him. I _would_, if\nthat would fetch him, quick enough;\" and the hot blood came surging up,\ncovering neck and brow with crimson.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nA BUD AND A BLOSSOM.\n\n\nFarnham was sitting the next evening in his library, when Budsey\nentered and said Mr. Ferguson desired to see him. The gaunt Scotchman\ncame in and said with feverish haste: \"The cereus grandiflorus will be\ngoin' to bloom the night. The buds are tremblin' and laborin' now.\"\nFarnham put on his hat and went to the conservatory, which was\nseparated from the house by the entire extent of the garden. Arriving\nthere, the gardener took him hurriedly to an inner room, dimly\nlighted,--a small square piece between the ferns and the grapes,--where\nthe regal flower had a wall to itself. Two or three garden chairs were\ndisposed about the room. Ferguson mounted on one of them, and turned up\nthe gas so that its full light shone upon the plant. The bud was a very\nlarge one, perfect and symmetrical; the strong sheath, of a rich and\neven brown, as yet showed only a few fissures of its surface, but even\nnow a faint odor stole from the travailing sphere, as from a cracked\nbox of alabaster filled with perfume.\n\nThe face of the canny Fergus was lighted up with an eager joy. He had\nwatched the growth and progress of this plant from its infancy. He had\nleaned above its cradle and taken pride in its size and beauty. He had\ntrained it over the wall--from which he had banished every rival--in\nlarge and graceful curves, reaching from the door of the fernery to the\ndoor of the grapery, till it looked, in the usual half light of the dim\nchamber, like a well-regulated serpent maturing its designs upon the\nneighboring paradise; and now the time was come when he was to see the\nfruit of his patience and his care.\n\n\"Heaven be thankit,\" he murmured devoutly, \"that I was to the fore when\nit came.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Fergus, for calling me,\" said Farnham, smiling. \"I know\nit must have cost you an effort to divide such a sight with any one.\"\n\n\"It's your siller bought it,\" the Scotchman answered sturdily; \"but\nthere's nobody knows it, or cares for it, as I do,--and that's the\ntruth.\"\n\nHis glance was fixed upon the bud, which seemed to throb and stir as he\nspoke. The soft explosive force within was at work so strongly that the\neye could watch its operation. The fissures of the sheath widened\nvisibly and turned white as the two men looked at them.\n\n\"It is a shame to watch this beautiful thing happening for only us,\"\nFarnham said to the gardener. \"Go and tell Mrs. Belding, with my\ncompliments, and ask her and Miss Belding to come down.\" But observing\nhis crestfallen expression, he took compassion on him and said: \"No,\nyou had better remain, for fear something should happen in your\nabsence. I will go for the ladies.\"\n\n\"I hope ye'll not miss it,\" said Fergus, but his eyes and his heart\nwere fixed upon the bud, which was slowly gaping apart, showing a faint\ntinge of gold in its heart.\n\nFarnham walked rapidly up the garden, and found the Beldings at the\ndoor, starting for evening service with their prayer-books in their\nhands.\n\n\"Do you wish to see the prettiest thing you ever saw in your lives? of\ncourse I except your mirrors when in action,\" he began, without\nsalutation. \"If so, come this moment to my conservatory. My\nnight-blooming cereus has her coming-out party tonight.\"\n\nThey both exclaimed with delight, and were walking with him toward the\ngarden. Suddenly, Mrs. Belding stopped and said:\n\n\"Alice, run and get your sketch-book and pencil. It will be lovely to\ndraw the flower.\"\n\n\"Why, mamma! we shall not have time for a sketch.\"\n\n\"There, there! do as I tell you, and do not waste time in disputing.\"\n\nThe young girl hesitated a moment, and then, with instinctive\nobedience, went off to fetch the drawing materials, while her mother\nsaid to Farnham:\n\n\"Madame de Veaudrey says Alice is very clever with her pencil; but she\nis so modest I shall have to be severe with her to make her do\nanything. She takes after me. I was very clever in my lessons, but\nnever would admit it.\"\n\nAlice came down the steps. Farnham, seeing her encumbered by her books,\ntook them from her, and they went down the walks to the conservatory.\nThey found Ferguson sitting, with the same rapt observation, before his\ntropical darling. As the ladies entered, he rose to give them seats,\nand then retired to the most distant corner of the room, where he spent\nthe rest of the evening entirely unaware of any one's presence, and\ngiven up to the delight of his eyes. The bud was so far opened that the\ncreamy white of the petals could be seen within the riven sheath, whose\nstrong dark color exquisitely relieved the pallid beauty it had guarded\nso long. The silky stamens were still curled about the central style,\nbut the splendor of color which was coming was already suggested, and a\nbreath of intoxicating fragrance stole from the heart of the immaculate\nflower.\n\nThey spoke to each other in low tones, as if impressed with a sort of\nawe at the beautiful and mysterious development of fragrant and lovely\nlife going forward under their sight. The dark eyes of Alice Belding\nwere full of that vivid happiness which strange and charming things\nbring to intelligent girlhood. She was looking with all her soul, and\nher breath was quick and high, and her soft red lips were parted and\ntremulous. Farnham looked from her to the flower, and back again,\ngazing on both with equal safety, for the one was as unconscious of his\nadmiring glances as the other.\n\nSuddenly, the sound of bells floated in from the neighboring street,\nand both of the ladies started. \"No, don't you go,\" said Mrs. Belding\nto her daughter. \"I must, because I have to see my 'Rescue the\nPerishing.' But you can just as well stay here and make your sketch.\nMr. Farnham can take care of you, and I will be back in an hour.\"\n\n\"But, mamma!\" cried Miss Alice, too much scandalized to speak another\nword.\n\n\"I won't have you lose this chance,\" her mother continued. \"I am sure\nMr. Farnham will not object to taking care of you a little while; and\nif he hasn't the time, Fergus will bring you home--hm, Fergus?\"\n\n\"Ay, madam, with right guid will,\" the gardener said, his hard face\nsoftening into a smile.\n\n\"There, sit down in that chair and begin your sketch. It is lovely just\nas it is.\" She waited until Alice, whose confusion had turned her face\ncrimson, had taken her seat, opened her sketch-book, and taken her\npencils in her trembling hands, and then the brisk and hearty woman\ndrew her shawl about her and bustled to the door.\n\n\"I will walk to the church door with you,\" said Farnham, to the\ninfinite relief of Alice, who regained her composure at the instant,\nand began with interest to sketch the flower. She thought, while her\nbusy fingers were at work, that she had perhaps been too prudish in\nobjecting to her mother's plan. \"He evidently thinks nothing of it, and\nwhy should I?\"\n\nBy the time Farnham returned, the cereus had attained its full glory of\nbloom. Its vast petals were thrown back to their fullest extent, and\nshone with a luminous beauty in which its very perfume seemed visible;\nthe countless recurved stamens shot forth with the vigorous impulse and\nvitality of sun rays; from the glowing centre to the dark fringe with\nwhich the shattered sheath still accented its radiant outline it blazed\nforth, fully revealed; and its sweet breath seemed the voice of a pride\nand consciousness of beauty like that of the goddess on Mount Ida,\ncalmly triumphant in the certainty of perfect loveliness.\n\nAlice had grown interested in her task, and looked up for only an\ninstant with her frank, clear eyes as Farnham entered. \"Now, where\nshall I sit?\" he asked. \"Here, behind your right elbow, where I can\nlook over your shoulder and observe the work as it goes on?\"\n\n\"By no means. My hand would lose all its little cunning in that case.\"\n\n\"Then I will sit in front of you and study the artistic emotions in\nyour face.\"\n\n\"That would be still worse, for you would hide my subject. I am sure\nyou are very well as you are,\" she added, as he seated himself in a\nchair beside her, a little way off.\n\n\"Yes, that is very well. I have the flower three-quarters and you in\nprofile. I will study the one for a panel and the other for a medal.\"\n\nMiss Alice laughed gently. She laughed often from sheer good humor,\nanswering the intention of what was said to her better than by words.\n\n\"Can you sketch and talk too?\" asked Farnham.\n\n\"I can sketch and listen,\" she said. \"You will talk and keep me\namused.\"\n\n\"Amusement with malice aforethought! The order affects my spirits like\na Dead March. How do the young men amuse young ladies nowadays? Do they\nbegin by saying, 'Have you been very gay lately?'\"\n\nAgain Miss Alice laughed. \"She is an easy-laughing girl,\" thought\nFarnham. \"I like easy-laughing girls. When she laughs, she always\nblushes a very little. It is worth while talking nonsense to see a girl\nlaugh so pleasantly and blush so prettily.\"\n\nIt is not worth while, however, to repeat all the nonsense Farnham\nuttered in the next hour. He got very much interested in it himself,\nand was so eager sometimes to be amusing that he grew earnest, and the\ngentle laugh would cease and the pretty lips would come gravely\ntogether. Whenever he saw this he would fall back upon his trifling\nagain. He had the soldier's fault of point-blank compliment, but with\nit an open sincerity of manner which relieved his flattery of any\noffensiveness. He had practised it in several capitals with some\nsuccess. A dozen times this evening, a neat compliment came to his lips\nand stopped there. He could hardly understand his own reserve before\nthis laughing young lady. Why should he not say something pretty about\nher hair and eyes, about her graceful attitude, about the nimble play\nof her white fingers over the paper? He had uttered frank flatteries to\npeeresses without rebuke. But he held his hand before this school-girl,\nwith the open dark-brown eyes and a club of yellow hair at the back of\nher neck. He could not help feeling that, if he talked to her with any\nforcing of the personal accent, she would stop laughing and the clear\neyes would be troubled. He desired anything rather than that, and so\nthe conversation went rattling on as free from personalities as the\ntalk of two light-hearted and clever schoolboys.\n\nAt one moment he was describing a bill of fare in a Colorado hotel.\n\n\"With nice bread, though, one can always get on,\" she said.\n\n\"True,\" Farnham answered; \"but this bread was of a ghostly pallor and\nflatness, as if it had been baked by moonlight on a grave-stone.\"\n\n\"The Indian women cook well, do they not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Some are not so bad as others. One young chief boasted to me of his\nwife's culinary accomplishments. He had been bragging all the morning\nabout his own exploits, of the men he had killed and the horses he had\nstolen, and then to establish his standing clearly in my mind, he\nadded: 'My squaw same white squaw--savey pie.'\"\n\n\"Even there, then, the trail of the pie-crust is over them all.\"\n\n\"No! only over the aristocracy.\"\n\n\"I should like so much to see that wonderful country.\"\n\n\"It is worth seeing,\" he said, with a curious sinking of the heart, \"if\nyou are not under orders.\"\n\nHe could not help thinking what a pleasant thing a journey through that\nBrobdingnaggian fairy-land would be with company like the young girl\nbefore him. Nature would be twice as lovely reflected from those brown\neyes. The absurdities and annoyances of travel would be made delightful\nby that frank, clear laugh. The thought of his poor Nellie flitted by\nhim an instant, too gentle and feeble for reproach. Another stronger\nthought had occupied his mind.\n\n\"You ought to see it. Your mother will need rest before long from her\nRescue-the-Perishings, and you are overworking yourself dreadfully over\nthat sketch-book. There is a touch of malaria about the fountain in\nBluff Park. Colorado will do you both no end of good. I feel as if I\nneeded it myself. I haven't energy enough to read Mr. Martin's 'Life of\nthe Prince Consort.' I shall speak to Mrs. Belding as soon as she\nreturns.\"\n\n\"Do, by all means. I should like to go, but mamma would not spend three\nnights in a sleeping-car to see the Delectable Mountains themselves.\"\n\nHe rose and walked about the room, looking at the flower and the young\nartist from different points of view, and seeing new beauties in each\ncontinually. There were long lapses of conversation, in which Alice\nworked assiduously and Farnham lounged about the conservatory, always\nreturning with a quick word and a keen look at the face of the girl. At\nlast he said to himself: \"Look here! She is not a baby. She is nearly\ntwenty years old. I have been wondering why her face was so steady and\nwise.\" The thought that she was not a child tilled his heart with\npleasure and his face with light. But his volubility seemed to die\nsuddenly away. He sat for a good while in silence, and started a little\nas she looked up and said:\n\n\"Now, if you will be very gentle, you can see my sketch and tell me\nwhat to do next.\"\n\nIt was a pretty and unpretentious picture that she had made. The flower\nwas faithfully though stiffly given, and nothing especially remarkable\nhad been attempted or achieved. Farnham looked at the sketch with eyes\nin which there was no criticism. He gave Alice a word or two of\nheartier praise for her work than she knew she deserved. It was rather\nmore than she expected, and she was not altogether pleased to be so\nhighly commended, though she could hardly have said why. Perhaps it was\nbecause it made her think less of his critical faculty. This was not\nagreeable, for her admiration of him from her childhood had been one of\nthe greatest pleasures of her life. She had regarded him as children\nregard a brilliant and handsome young uncle. She did not expect from\nhim either gallantry or equality of treatment.\n\n\"There! Do not say too much about it--you will make me ashamed of it.\nWhat does it lack?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except something on the right to balance the other side. You\nmight sketch in roughly a half-opened flower on the vine about there,\"\nindicating the place.\n\nShe took her pencils and began obediently to do what he had suggested.\nHe leaned over her shoulder, so near her she could feel his breath on\nthe light curls that played about her ear. She wished he would move.\nShe grew nervous, and at last said:\n\n\"I am tired. You put in that flower.\"\n\nHe took the book and pencils from her, as she rose from her chair and\ngave him her place, and with a few strong and rapid strokes finished\nthe sketch.\n\n\"After all,\" she said to herself, with hearty appreciation, \"men do\nhave the advantage of girls. He bothered me dreadfully, and I did not\nbother him in the least. And yet I stood as near to him as he did to\nme.\"\n\nMrs. Belding came in a moment later. She was in high spirits. They had\nhad a good meeting--had converted a Jew, she thought. She admired the\nsketch very much; hoped Alice had been no trouble to Farnham. He walked\nhome with the ladies, and afterward smoked a cigar with great\ndeliberation under the limes.\n\nMrs. Belding asked Alice how they had got on.\n\n\"He did not eat you, you see. You must get out of your ideas of men,\nespecially men of Arthur Farnham's age. He never thinks of you. He is\nold enough to be your father.\"\n\nAlice kissed her mother and went to her own room, calculating on the\nway the difference between her age and Captain Farnham's.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nA DRAMA WITH TWO SPECTATORS.\n\n\nThe words of Bott lingered obstinately in Maud Matchin's mind. She gave\nherself no rest from dwelling on them. Her imagination was full, day\nafter day, of glowing pictures of herself and Farnham in tete-a-tete;\nshe would seek in a thousand ways to tell her love--but she could never\nquite arrange her avowal in a satisfactory manner. Long before she came\nto the decisive words which were to kindle his heart to flame in the\nimaginary dialogue, he would himself take fire by spontaneous\ncombustion, and, falling on his knees, would offer his hand, his heart,\nand his fortune to her in words taken from \"The Earl's Daughter\" or the\n\"Heir of Ashby.\"\n\n\"Oh, pshaw! that's the way it ought to be,\" she would say to herself.\n\"But if he won't--I wonder whether I ever could have the brass to do\nit? I don't know why I shouldn't. We are both human. Bott wouldn't have\nsaid that if there was nothing in it, and he's a mighty smart man.\"\n\nThe night usually gave her courage. Gazing into her glass, she saw\nenough to inspire her with an idea of her own invincibility; and after\nshe had grown warm in bed she would doze away, resolving with a stout\nheart that she would try her fate in the morning. But when day came,\nthe enterprise no longer seemed so simple. Her scanty wardrobe struck\nher with cowardice as she surveyed it. The broad daylight made\neverything in the house seem poor and shabby. When she went\ndown-stairs, her heart sank within her as she entered the kitchen to\nhelp her mother, and when she sat with the family at the breakfast-table,\nshe had no faith left in her dreams of the rosy midnight. This\nalternation of feeling bred in her, in the course of a few days, a sort\nof fever, which lent a singular beauty to her face, and a petulant tang\nto her speech. She rose one morning, after a sleepless night, in a\nstate of anger and excitement in which she had little difficulty in\ncharging upon Farnham all responsibility for her trouble of mind.\n\n\"I won't stand it any longer,\" she said aloud in her chamber. \"I shall\ngo to him this day and have it out. I shall ask him what he means by\ntreating me so.\"\n\nShe sat down by her bureau and began to crimp her hair with grim\nresolution. Her mother came and knocked at her door. \"I'm not coming to\nbreakfast, I've got a headache,\" she said, and added to herself, \"I\nsha'n't go down and get the smell of bacon on me this morning.\"\n\nShe continued her work of personal adornment for two hours, going\nseveral times over her whole modest arsenal of finery before she was\nready for the fray. She then went down in her street costume, and made\na hasty meal of bread and butter, standing by the pantry. Her mother\ncame in and found her there.\n\n\"Why, Mattie, how's your head?\"\n\n\"I'm going to take a walk and see what that will do.\"\n\nAs she walked rapidly out of Dean Street, the great clock of the\ncathedral was striking the hour of nine.\n\n\"Goodness!\" she exclaimed, \"that's too early to call on a gentleman.\nWhat shall I do?\"\n\nShe concluded to spend the time of waiting in the library, and walked\nrapidly in that direction, the fresh air flushing her cheeks, and\nblowing the frizzed hair prettily about her temples. She went straight\nto the reference rooms, and sat down to read a magazine. The girl who\nhad prompted her to apply for a place was there on duty. She gave a\nlittle cry of delight when she saw Maud, and said:\n\n\"I was just crazy to see you. I have got a great secret for you. I'm\nengaged!\"\n\nThe girls kissed each other with giggles and little screams, and the\nyoung woman told who _he_ was--in the lightning-rod business in\nKalamazoo, and doing very well; they were to be married almost\nimmediately.\n\n\"You never saw such a fellow, he just won't wait;\" and consequently her\nplace in the library would be vacant. \"Now, you must have it, Maud! I\nhaven't told a soul. Even the Doctor don't know it yet.\"\n\nMaud left the library and walked up the avenue with an easier mind. She\nhad an excuse for her visit now, and need not broach, unless she liked,\nthe tremendous subject that made her turn hot and cold to think of. She\nwent rustling up the wide thoroughfare at a quick pace; but before\narriving at Farnham's, moved by a momentary whim, she turned down a\nside street leading to Bishop's Lane. She said to herself, \"I will go\nin by that little gate once, if I never do again.\" As she drew near,\nshe thought, \"I hope Sam isn't there.\"\n\nSam was there, just finishing his work upon the greenhouse. Farnham was\nthere also; he had come down to inspect the job, and he and Sleeny were\nchatting near the gate as Maud opened it and came in. Farnham stepped\nforward to meet her. The unexpected rencounter made her shy, and she\nneither spoke to Sam nor looked toward him, which filled him with a\ndull jealousy.\n\n\"Could I have a few moments' conversation with you, sir?\" she asked,\nwith stiff formality.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Farnham, smiling. \"Shall we go into the house?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she rejoined, severely decorous. They walked up the\ngarden-path together, and Sam looked after them with an unquiet heart.\n\nShe was walking beside Farnham with a stately step, in spite of the\nscabbard-like narrowness of the dress she wore. She was nearly as tall\nas he, and as graceful as a young pine blown to and fro by soft winds.\nThe carpenter, with his heart heavy with love and longing, felt a\nbitter sense that she was too fine for him. They passed into the house,\nand he turned to his work with a sigh, often dropping his busy hands\nand looking toward the house with a dumb questioning in his eyes. After\na half hour which seemed endless to him, they reappeared and walked\nslowly down the lawn. There was trouble and agitation in the girl's\nface, and Farnham was serious also. As they came by the rose-house,\nMaud paused and looked up with a sorrowful smile and a question.\nFarnham nodded, and they walked to the open door of the long, low\nbuilding. He led the way in, and Maud, looking hastily around, closed\nthe door behind them.\n\n\"He's goin' to give her some more of them roses,\" said Sam, explaining\nthe matter to himself. But he worked for some time with his blond beard\non his shoulder in his impatience to see them come out. At last, he\ncould resist no longer. He knew a point where he could look through the\nglass and see whatever was taking place among the roses. He walked\nswiftly across the turf to that point. He looked in and saw Maud,\nwhose back was turned toward him, talking as if she were pleading for\nher life, while Farnham listened with a clouded brow. Sleeny stood\nstaring with stupid wonder while Maud laid her hand upon Farnham's\nshoulder. At that moment he heard footsteps on the gravel walk at some\ndistance from him, and he looked up and saw Mrs. Belding approaching.\nConfused at his attitude of espionage, he walked away from his post,\nand, as he passed her, Mrs. Belding asked him if he knew where Mr.\nFarnham was.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"he's in there. Walk right in;\" and in the midst of\nhis trouble of spirit he could hardly help chuckling at his own\ncleverness as he walked, in his amazement, back to the conservatory.\n\nWhile she was in the house, Maud had confined herself to the subject of\nthe vacancy in the library. She rushed at it, as a hunter at a hedge,\nto get away from the other matter which had tormented her for a week.\nWhen she found herself alone with Farnham she saw that it would be\n\"horrid\" to say what she had so long been rehearsing. \"Now I can get\nthat place, if you will help me. No earthly soul knows anything about\nit, and Minnie said she would give me a good chance before she let it\nout.\"\n\nFarnham tried to show her the difficulties in the way. He was led by\nher eagerness into a more detailed account of his differences with the\nrest of the board than he had ever given to any one, a fuller narrative\nthan was perhaps consistent with entire prudence. Whenever he paused,\nshe would insist with a woman's disconcerting directness:\n\n\"But they don't know anything about it this time--they can't combine on\nanybody. You can certainly get one of them.\"\n\nFarnham still argued against her sanguine hopes, till he at last\naffected her own spirits, and she grew silent and despondent. As she\nrose to go, he also took his hat to return to the garden, where he had\nleft Sleeny, and they walked over the lawn together. As they approached\nthe rose-house, she thought of her former visit and asked to repeat it.\nThe warm breath of the flowers saluted her as she crossed the\nthreshold, bringing so vivid a reminiscence of the enchantment of that\nother day, that there came with it a sudden and poignant desire to try\nthere, in that bewitched atmosphere, the desperate experiment which\nwould decide her fate. There was no longer any struggle in her mind.\nShe could not, for her life, have kept silent now. She walked slowly\nbeside him to the place where the pots of roses stood ranged on their\nframes, filling the air with dense fragrance. Her hands were icy cold\nand quick flushes passed through her, while her face reddened and paled\nlike a horizon smitten by heat-lightning in a sultry night of summer.\nShe looked at the moist brick pavement at her feet, her eyelids seemed\ntoo heavy to lift, and the long lashes nearly touched her cheeks.\n\n\"What sort will you have?\" said Farnham, reaching for the gardener's\nshears.\n\n\"Never mind the roses,\" she said, in a dry voice which she hardly\nrecognized as her own. \"I have something to say to you.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at her with surprise. She raised her eyes to his\nwith a great effort, and then, blushing fiery red, she said, in a\nclear, low voice, \"I love you.\"\n\nLike many another daughter and son of Eve, she was startled at the\neffect of these momentous words upon herself. Of all forms of speech\nthese three words are the most powerful, the most wonderworking upon\nthe being who utters them. It was the first time they had ever passed\nher lips, and they exalted and inebriated her. She was suddenly set\nfree from the bashful constraint which had held her, and with a leaping\npulse and free tongue she poured out her heart to the astonished and\nscandalized young man.\n\n\"Yes, I love you. You think it's horrid that I should say so, don't\nyou? But I don't care, I love you. I loved you the first time I saw\nyou, though you made me so angry about my glasses. But you were my\nmaster, and I knew it, and I never put them on again. And I thought of\nyou day and night, and I longed for the day to come when I might see\nyou once more, and I was glad when I did not get that place, so that I\ncould come again and see you and talk with you. I can tell you over\nagain every word you ever said to me. You were not like other men. You\nare the first real man I ever knew. I was silly and wild when I wanted\nto be your secretary. Of course, that wouldn't do. If I am not to be\nyour wife, I must never see you again; you know that, don't you?\" and,\ncarried away by her own reckless words, she laid her hand on his\nshoulder. His frown of amazement and displeasure shook her composure\nsomewhat. She turned pale and trembled, her eyes fell, and it seemed\nfor an instant as if she would sink to the floor at his feet. He put\nhis arm around her, to keep her from falling and pressed her closely to\nhim. She threw her head back upon his shoulder and lifted her face to\nhim. He looked down on her, and the frown passed from his brow as he\nsurveyed her flushed cheeks, her red full lips parted in breathless\neagerness; her dark eyes were wide open, the iris flecked with golden\nsparks and the white as clear and blue-tinged as in the eyes of a\nvigorous infant; her head lay on his shoulder in perfect content, and\nshe put up her mouth to him as simply and as sure of a response as a\npretty child. He was entirely aware of the ridiculousness of his\nposition, but he stooped and kissed her.\n\nHer work seemed all done; but her satisfaction lasted only a second.\nHer face broke into happy smiles.\n\n\"You do love me, do you not?\" she asked.\n\n\"I certainly do not,\" he answered; and at that instant the door opened\nand Mrs. Belding saw this pretty group of apparent lovers on a rich\nbackground of Jacqueminot roses.\n\nStartled more at the words of Farnham than at the entry of Mrs.\nBelding, Maud had started up, like Vivien, \"stiff as a viper frozen.\"\nHer first thought was whether she had crushed her hat on his shoulder,\nand her hands flew instinctively to her head-gear. She then walked\ntempestuously past the astonished lady out into the garden and brushed\nroughly by Sleeny, who tried to detain her.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Sam! I hate you and all men\"; and with this general\ndenunciation, she passed out of the place, flaming with rage and shame.\n\nMrs. Belding stood for a moment speechless, and then resorted to the\nuse of that hard-worked and useful monosyllable,\n\n\"Well!\" with a sharp, falling inflection.\n\n\"Well!\" returned Farnham, with an easy, rising accent; and then both of\nthem relieved the strained situation with a laugh.\n\n\"Come, now,\" said the good-natured woman, \"I am a sort of guardian of\nyours. Give an account of yourself.\"\n\n\"That is easily given,\" said Farnham. \"A young woman, whose name I\nhardly know, came to me in the garden this morning to ask for help to\nget some lady-like work to do. After discussing that subject\nthreadbare, she came in here for a rose, and, apropos of nothing, made\nme a declaration and a proposal of honorable wedlock, _dans toutes les\nformes_.\"\n\n\"The forms were evident as I entered,\" said Mrs. Belding, dryly.\n\n\"I could not let her drop on the damp floor,\" said Farnham, who was\nastonished to find himself positively blushing under the amused\nscrutiny of his mother-confessor. \"Consider, if you please, my dear\nmadam, that this is the first offer I have ever received, and I was\nnaturally somewhat awkward about declining it. We shall learn better\nmanners as we go along.\"\n\n\"You did decline, then?\" said Mrs. Belding, easily persuaded of the\nsubstantial truth of the story, and naturally inclined, as is the way\nof woman, to the man's side. Then, laughing at Arthur's discomfiture,\nshe added, \"I was about to congratulate you.\"\n\n\"I deserve only your commiseration.\"\n\n\"I must look about and dispose of you in some way. You are evidently\ntoo rich and too fascinating. But I came over to-day to ask you what I\nought to do about my Lake View farm. I have two offers for it; if I had\nbut one, I would take either--well, you know what I mean;\" and the\nconversation became practical. After that matter was disposed of, she\nsaid, with a keen side-glance at Farnham, \"That was a very pretty girl.\nI hope you will not be exposed to such another attack; I might not be\nso near the next time.\"\n\n\"That danger, thanks to you, is over; Mademoiselle will never return,\"\nhe answered, with an air of conviction.\n\nMrs. Belding went home with no impression left of the scene she had\nwitnessed but one of amusement. She thought of it only as \"a good joke\non Arthur Farnham.\" She kept chuckling to herself over it all day, and\nif she had had any especial gossip in the town, she would have put on\nher hat and hurried off to tell it. But she was a woman who lived very\nmuch at home, and, in fact, cared little for tattling. She was several\ntimes on the point of sharing the fun of it with her daughter, but was\nprevented by an instinctive feeling that it was hardly the sort of\nstory to tell a young girl about a personal acquaintance. So she\nrestrained herself, though the solitary enjoyment of it irritated her.\n\nThey were sitting on the wide porch which ran around two sides of the\nhouse just as twilight was falling. The air was full of drowsy calls\nand twitters from the grass and the trees. The two ladies had been\nsitting ever since dinner, enjoying the warm air of the early summer,\ntalking very little, and dropping often into long and contented\nsilences. Mrs. Belding had condescended to grenadine in consideration\nof the weather, and so looked less funereal than usual. Alice was\ndressed in a soft and vapory fabric of creamy bunting, in the midst of\nwhich her long figure lay reclined in an easy chair of Japanese bamboo;\nshe might have posed for a statue of graceful and luxurious repose.\nThere was light enough from the rising moon and the risen stars to show\nthe clear beauty of her face and the yellow lustre of her hair; and her\nmother cast upon her from time to time a glance of pride and fondness,\nas if she were a recovered treasure to which the attraction of novelty\nhad just been added anew.\n\n\"They say she looks as I did at her age,\" thought the candid lady; \"but\nthey must flatter me. My nose was never so straight as that: her nose\nis Belding all over. I wonder whom she will care about here? Mr. Furrey\nis a nice young man, but she is hardly polite to him. There he is now.\"\n\nThe young man came briskly up the walk, and ran up the steps so quickly\nthat he tripped on the last one and dropped his hat. He cleverly\nrecovered it, however, and made very elaborate bows to both the ladies,\nhoping that he found them quite well. Mrs. Belding bustled about to\ngive him a chair, at which Alice knitted her pretty brows a little. She\nhad scarcely moved her eyelashes to greet her visitor; but when Mrs.\nBelding placed a light chair near her daughter and invited Mr. Furrey\nto take it, the young lady rose from her reclining attitude and sat\nbolt upright with a look of freezing dignity. The youth was not at all\nabashed, but took his seat, with his hat held lightly by the brim in\nboth hands. He was elegantly dressed, in as faithful and reverent an\nimitation as home talent could produce of the costume of the gentlemen\nwho that year were driving coaches in New York. His collar was as stiff\nas tin; he had a white scarf, with an elaborate pin constructed of\nwhips and spurs and horseshoes. He wore dog-skin gloves, very tight and\nred. His hair was parted in the middle with rigorous impartiality and\nshed rather rank fragrance on the night. He began conversation with an\neasy air, in which there was something of pleasurable excitement mixed.\n\n\"I come to receive your congratulations, ladies!\"\n\n\"What, you are engaged?\" said Mrs. Belding, and even the placid face of\nMiss Alice brightened with a look of pleased inquiry.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no; how could you think so?\" he protested, with an arch look\nat Alice which turned her to marble again. \"I mean I have this day been\nappointed assistant cashier of our bank!\" Napoleon, informing Madame de\nBeauharnais [* - Perhaps Josephine told Napoleon herself, but I think\nshe was clever enough to let him imagine he owed the appointment to his\nmerits.] that he was to command the army of Italy, probably made less\nado about it.\n\nMrs. Belding made haste to murmur her congratulations. \"Very\ngratifying, I am sure,--at your age;\" to which Alice responded like a\nchorus, but without any initiative warmth, \"Very gratifying, I am\nsure.\"\n\nFurrey went on at some length to detail all the circumstances of the\nevent: how Mr. Lathers, the president of the bank, had sent for him,\nand how he complimented him; how he had asked him where he learned to\nwrite such a good hand; and how he had replied that it came sort of\nnatural to him to write well, that he could make the American eagle\nwith pen and ink before he was fifteen, all but the tail-feathers, and\nhow he discovered a year later that the tail-feathers had to be made by\nholding the pen between the first and second fingers; with much more to\nthe like innocent purpose, to which Mrs. Belding listened with nods and\nmurmurs of approval. This was all the amiable young man needed to\nencourage him to indefinite prattle. He told them all about the men in\nthe bank, their habits and their loves and their personal relations to\nhim, and how he seemed somehow to be a general favorite among them all.\nMiss Alice sat very still and straight in her chair, with an occasional\nsmile when the laughter of Mr. Furrey seemed to require it, but with\nher eyes turned to the moonlit night in vagrant reverie, and her mind\nin those distant and sacred regions where we cannot follow the minds of\npure and happy girls.\n\n\"Now, you would hardly understand, if I did not tell you,\" said Mr.\nFurrey, \"how it is that I have gained the confidence----\"\n\nAt this moment Alice, who had been glancing over Mr. Furrey's shoulder\nfor a moment with a look of interest in her eyes, which he thought was\nthe legitimate result of his entertaining story, cried:\n\n\"Why, there comes Mr. Farnham, mamma.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said her mother. \"I suppose he wants to see me. Don't move,\nMr. Furrey. Mr. Farnham and I will go into the house.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said that gentleman, who by this time had mounted the\nsteps. \"I was sitting all alone on my porch and saw by the moon that\nyours was inhabited; and so I came over to improve my mind and manners\nin your society.\"\n\n\"I will get a chair for you,\" said Mrs. Belding.\n\n\"No, thank you; this balustrade will bear my weight, and my ashes will\ndrop harmless on the flower-bed, if you will let me finish my cigar.\"\nAnd he seated himself between the chair of Furrey and the willow fabric\nin which Alice had resumed her place. This addition to the company was\nnot at all to the taste of the assistant cashier, who soon took his\nleave, shaking hands with the ladies, with his best bow.\n\n\"After all, I do prefer a chair,\" said Farnham, getting down from his\nbalustrade, and throwing away his cigar.\n\nHe sat with his back to the moonlight. On his left was Alice, who, as\nsoon as Furrey took his departure, settled back in her willow chair in\nher former attitude of graceful ease. On the right was Mrs. Belding, in\nher thin, cool dress of gauzy black. Farnham looked from one to the\nother as they talked, and that curious exercise, so common to young men\nin such circumstances, went through his mind. He tried to fancy how\nMrs. Belding looked at nineteen, and how Miss Belding would look at\nfifty, and the thought gave him singular pleasure. His eyes rested with\nsatisfaction on the kindly and handsome face of the widow, her fine\nshoulders and arms, and comfortable form, and then, turning to the pure\nand exquisite features of the tall girl, who was smiling so freshly and\nhonestly on him, his mind leaped forward through corning years, and he\nsaid to himself: \"What a wealth of the woman there is there--for\nsomebody.\" An aggressive feeling of disapproval of young Furrey took\npossession of him, and he said, sharply:\n\n\"What a very agreeable young man Mr. Furrey is?\"\n\nMrs. Belding assented, and Miss Alice laughed heartily, and his mind\nwas set at rest for the moment.\n\nThey passed a long time together. At first Mrs. Belding and Arthur\n\"made the expenses\" of the conversation; but she soon dropped away, and\nAlice, under the influence of the night and the moonlight and Farnham's\nfrank and gentle provocation, soon found herself talking with as much\nfreedom and energy as if it were a girls' breakfast. With far more,\nindeed,--for nature takes care of such matters, and no girl can talk to\nanother as she can to a man, under favoring stars. The conversation\nfinally took a personal turn, and Alice, to her own amazement, began to\ntalk of her life at school, and with sweet and loving earnestness sang\nthe praises of Madame de Veaudrey.\n\n\"I wish you could know her,\" she said to Farnham, with a sudden impulse\nof sympathy. He was listening to her intently, and enjoying her eager,\ningenuous speech as much as her superb beauty, as the moon shone full\non her young face, so vital and so pure at once, and played, as if glad\nof the privilege, about the curved lips, the flashing teeth, the soft\neyes under their long lashes, and the hair over the white forehead,\ngleaming as crisply brilliant as fine-spun wire of gold.\n\n\"By her fruits I know her, and I admire her very much,\" he said, and\nwas sorry for it the moment afterward, for it checked the course of the\nyoung girl's enthusiasm and brought a slight blush to her cheek.\n\n\"I ought to have known better,\" he said to himself with real penitence,\n\"than to utter a stupid commonplace to such a girl when she was talking\nso earnestly.\" And he tried to make amends, and succeeded in winning\nback her attention and her slow unconscious smiles by talking to her of\nthings a thousand miles away. The moon was silvering the tops of the\nlinden-trees at the gates before they thought of the flight of time,\nand they had quite forgotten the presence of Mrs. Belding when her\naudible repose broke in upon their talk. They looked at each other, and\nburst into a frank laugh, full of confidence and comradeship, which the\ngood lady heard in her dreams and waked, saying, \"What are you laughing\nat? I did not catch that last witticism.\"\n\nThe young people rose from their chairs. \"I can't repeat my own mots,\"\nsaid Arthur: \"Miss Belding will tell you.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall not,\" replied Alice. \"It was not one of his best,\nmamma.\"\n\nShe gave him her hand as he said \"Good-night,\" and it lay in his firm\ngrasp a moment without reserve or tremor.\n\n\"You are a queer girl, Alice,\" said Mrs. Belding, as they walked into\nthe drawing-room through the open window. \"You put on your stiffest\ncompany manners for Mr. Furrey, and you seem entirely at ease with Mr.\nFarnham, who is much older and cleverer, and is noted for his sarcastic\ncriticisms.\"\n\n\"I do not know why it is, mamma, but I do feel very much at home with\nMr. Farnham, and I do not want Mr. Furrey to feel at home with me.\"\n\nUpon this, Mrs. Belding laughed aloud. Alice turned in surprise, and\nher mother said, \"It is too good to keep. I must tell you. It is such a\njoke on Arthur;\" and, sitting in a low arm-chair, while Alice stood\nbefore her leaning upon the back of another, she told the whole story\nof the scene of the morning in the rose-house. She gave it in the\nfullest detail, interrupting herself here and there for soft\ncachinnations, unmindful of the stern, unsmiling silence with which her\ndaughter listened.\n\nShe finished, with a loud nourish of merriment, and then asked: \"Did\nyou ever hear anything so funny in your life?\"\n\nThe young lady was turning white and red in an ominous manner, and was\nbiting her nether lip. Her answer to her mother's question was swift\nand brief:\n\n\"I never heard anything so horrid,\" and she moved majestically away\nwithout another word.\n\nMrs. Belding sat for a moment abashed. \"There!\" she said to herself, \"I\nknew very well I ought not to tell her. But it was too good to keep,\nand I had nobody else to tell.\" She went to bed, feeling rather\nill-used. As she passed her daughter's door, she said, \"Good-night,\nAlice!\"  and a voice riot quite so sweet as usual replied, \"Good-night,\nmamma,\" but the door was not opened.\n\nAlice turned down her light and sat upon a cushioned seat in the\nembrasure of her open window. She looked up at the stars, which swam\nand glittered in her angry eyes. With trembling lips and clinched hands\nshe communed with herself. \"Why, why, why did mamma tell me that horrid\nstory? To think there should be such women in the world! To take such a\nliberty with him, of all men! She could not have done it without some\nencouragement--and he could not have encouraged her. He is not that\nkind of a vulgar flirt at all. But what do I know about men? They may\nall be--but I did not think--what business have I thinking about it? I\nhad better go to bed. I have spent all the evening talking to a man\nwho--Oh! I wish mamma had not told me that wretched story. I shall\nnever speak to him again. It is a pity, too, for we are such near\nneighbors, and he is so nice, if he were not--But I don't care how nice\nhe is, she has spoiled him. I wonder who she was. Pretty, was she? I\ndon't believe a word of it--some bold-faced, brazen creature. Oh! I\nshall hate myself if I cry;\" but that was past praying for, and she\nclosed her lattice and went to bed for fear the stars should witness\nher unwelcome tears.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nA WORD OUT OF SEASON.\n\n\nArthur Farnham awoke the next day with a flight of sweet hopes and\nfancies singing in his heart and brain. He felt cheerfully and kindly\ntoward the whole human race. As he walked down into the city to\ntransact some business he had there with his lawyer, he went out of his\nway to speak to little children. He gave all his acquaintances a\nheartier \"Good-morning\" than usual. He even whistled at passing dogs.\nThe twitter of the sparrows in the trees, their fierce contentions on\nthe grass, amused him. He leaned over the railing of the fountain in\nthe square with the idlers, and took a deep interest in the turtles,\nwho were baking their frescoed backs in the warm sun, as they floated\nabout on pine boards, amid the bubbles of the clear water.\n\nAs he passed by the library building, Dr. Buchlieber was standing in\nthe door. \"Good luck,\" he said; \"I was just wishing to see you. One of\nour young women resigned this morning, and I think there may be a\nchance for our handsome friend. The meeting, you remember, is this\nafternoon.\"\n\nFarnham hardly recalled the name of the young lady in whose success he\nhad been so interested, although recent intimate occurrences might have\nbeen expected to fix it somewhat permanently in his remembrance. But\nall female images except one had become rather vague in his memory. He\nassented, however, to what the doctor proposed, and going away\ncongratulated himself on the possibility of doing Maud a service and\nridding himself of the faintest tinge of remorse. He was not fatuous or\nconceited. He did not for a moment imagine that the girl was in love\nwith him. He attributed her demonstration in the rose-house to her\n\"congenital bad breeding,\" and thought it only one degree worse than\nother match-making manoeuvres of which he had been the object in the\ndifferent worlds he had frequented. He gave himself no serious thought\nabout it, and yet he was glad to find an apparent opportunity to be of\nuse to her. She was poor and pretty. He had taken an interest in her\nwelfare. It had not turned out very well. She had flung herself into\nhis arms and been heartily kissed. He could not help feeling there was\na balance against him.\n\nAs he turned the corner of the street which led to the attorney's\noffice where he was going, he saw a man standing by the wall with his\nhat off, bowing to him. He returned the unusual salutation and passed\non; it was some moments before he remembered that it was one of his\ncolleagues on the Library Board. He regretted not having stopped and\nmade the effort to engage his vote for Maud; but, on second thought, he\nreflected that it would be as well to rely upon the surprise of the\nthree to prevent a combination at the meeting. When he reached the\nentrance of the building where his lawyer's offices were, he turned,\nwith a sense of being pursued by a shuffling footstep which had\nhastened its speed the last few paces, and saw his colleague coming up\nthe steps after him with a perspiring but resolute face.\n\n\"Hold on, Cap,\" he said, coming into the shade of the passage. \"I was\nthinkin' o' comin' to see you, when I sighted you comin' round the\ncorner.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Mr. Pennybaker,\" said Arthur, taking the clumsy\nhand which was held out to him.\n\n\"Gettin' pretty hot, ain't it?\" said Pennybaker, wiping his brow with\nhis forefinger and dexterously sprinkling the floor with the proceeds\nof the action.\n\n\"No danger of frost, I think,\" Arthur assented, admiring the dexterity\nof Pennybaker, but congratulating himself that the shake-hands was\ndisposed of.\n\n\"You bet your life. We're going to have it just sizzling from now on.\"\n\n\"Were you wishing to see me about anything in particular?\" asked\nFarnham, who saw no other way of putting an end to a meteorological\ndiscussion which did not interest him.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" answered Pennybaker, getting around beside Farnham, and\ngazing at the wall opposite. \"I heerd this mornin' that Minnie Bell was\ngoin' to get married. My daughter is doing some sewing for her, and it\nslipped out that way. She was trying to keep it secret. Some girls is\nmighty funny that way. They will do anything to get engaged, and then\nthey will lie like Sam Hill to make believe they ain't. Well, that\nmakes a vacancy.\" He did not turn his head, but he cast a quick glance\nsideways at Farnham, who made no answer, and Pennybaker resumed: \"So I\nthought I would come to you, honor bright, and see if we couldn't agree\nwhat to do. That's me. I'm open and square like a bottle of bitters.\"\n\nFarnham gave no indication of his surprise at this burst of candor, but\nasked:\n\n\"What do you propose?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Pennybaker, promptly. \"I don't propose nothing--I\n_ex_pose. You hear me--I _ex_pose.\" He said this with great mystery,\none eye being shut fast and the other only half open. He perceived that\nhe had puzzled Farnham, and enjoyed it for a moment by repeating his\nmot with a chuckle that did not move a muscle of his face. \"I'll tell\nyou the whole thing. There's no use, between gentlemen, of playing the\nthing too fine.\" He took his knife from one pocket and from another a\ntwist of tobacco, and, cutting off a mouthful, began his story:\n\n\"You see, me and Bud Merritt and Joe Dorman have most generally agreed\non paternage, and that was all right. You are well fixed. You don't\nwant the bother of them little giblets of paternage. We've 'tended to\n'em for what there was in 'em and for the good of the party. Now Bud he\nwants to be auditor, and he's got Joe to go in with him, because, if he\ngits there, Joe's brother-in-law, Tim Dolan, will be his debbity. Bud\nis weak in the Third Ward, and he knows it, and he knows that Jake\nRunckel can swing that ward like a dead cat; and so they have fixed it\nall up to give the next vacancy to Jake for his sister. She's been\nturned out of the school for some skylarking, and weighs pretty heavy\non Jake's hands. Very well. That's the game, and I'm a-kickin'! Do you\nhear me? I'm a-kickin'!\"\n\nPennybaker pushed up his hat and looked Farnham fairly in the face. The\nassertion of his independence seemed to give him great gratification.\nHe said once more, slowly closing one eye and settling back in his\nformer attitude against the wall, while he aimed a deluge of\ntobacco-juice at the base of the wall before him: \"I'm a-kickin' like a\nTexas steer.\"\n\nHe waited a moment to allow these impressive words to have their full\neffect, while Farnham preserved a serious and attentive face.\n\n\"Well, this bein' the case,\" continued Pennybaker, \"I comes to you, as\none gentleman to another, and I asks whether we can't agree against\nthis selfish and corrupt game of Merritt and Dorman. For, you see, I\ndon't get a smell out of what they're doin'. I'm out in the cold if\ntheir slate goes through.\"\n\n\"I don't see that I can be of any service to you, Mr. Pennybaker. If I\nhave any influence in the matter, it shall be given to Miss Matchin,\nwhom I proposed once before.\"\n\n\"Exactly! Now you're talkin'. Miss Matchin shall have it, on one little\nproviso that won't hurt you nor me nor nobody. Say the word, and it's a\nwhack.\"\n\nAnd he lifted up his hand to strike the bargain.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Farnham, in a tone which was severe and\ncontemptuous, in spite of him.\n\n\"Namely, just this,\" answered Pennybaker, \"You ain't on the make;\nyou're fixed. You don't care about these d---- little things except to\nhelp a friend once 'n awhile,\" he said, in a large and generous way.\n\"But I ain't that kind yet. I've got to look out for myself--pretty\nlively, too. Now, I'll tell you what's my racket. You let me perpose\nMiss Matchin's name and then go and tell her father that I put it\nthrough, and it'll be done slick as a whistle. That's all solid, ain't\nit?\"\n\nFarnham's brow clouded. He did not answer at once. Pennybaker repeated\nhis question a little anxiously:\n\n\"That's all solid, ain't it?\"\n\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Pennybaker, if I do not quite understand your\nracket, as you call it. I do not see how you make anything out of this.\nMatchin is a poor man. You surely do not intend----\"\n\n\"To strike Saul for a divvy? Nothing of the sort,\" said Pennybaker,\nwithout the least offence. \"The whole thing lies just here. Among\ngentlemen there's no use being shy about it. My brother wants to be\nassessor in Saul Matchin's ward. Saul's got a lot of influence among\nthe boys in the planing-mills, and I want his help. You see?\"\n\nFarnham thought he saw, and, after assenting to Pennybaker's eager\ndemand, \"That's all solid?\" he walked away, too much relieved by the\nthought that Maud was provided for to question too closely the morality\nof the proceeding which the sordid rascal had exposed to him.\n\nIn the afternoon, at the meeting of the board, the programme agreed\nupon was strictly carried out.\n\nPennybaker proposed Miss Matchin's name as soon as the vacancy was\nannounced, to the amazement of his late confederates. They moved a\npostponement, but to no purpose; Maud was elected; and the angry\npoliticians had no better revenge than to say spitefully to Pennybaker\non the stairs, as they went away, \"How much did the Captain give you\nfor that sell-out?\"--a jeer which he met by a smile of conscious\nrectitude and a request to be informed the next time they organized a\nfreeze-out against him. It must be said, however, that he lost no time\nin going to Matchin, informing him that he had succeeded in carrying\nMaud in by unheard-of exertions, and demanding and receiving on the\nspot five per cent of her year's salary, which he called \"the usual\ncommission.\"\n\nSaul announced the appointment that evening at supper. Maud flushed\ncrimson, and the tears started to her eyes. She was about to declare\nshe would not have it, when her father's next words put a different\nface on the matter. \"And it's no thanks to Cap'n Farnham, neither. He\ntried it oncet, and couldn't make the riffle. But me and Joel\nPennybaker got together and done it. And now I hope, Mattie, you'll\nbehave yourself and save money. It's like a fortun' comin' to you, if\nyou're smart.\"\n\nMaud found no reply ready. She could not wholly believe her father's\nstory. She still fancied the appointment came from Farnham, and there\nwas a certain bitterness in it; but, on the whole, she received it not\nwithout a secret complacency. Mrs. Matchin's pleasure was checked by\nher daughter's morose confusion. Sam made no pretence of being pleased,\nbut sat, unmoved by Matchin's speech, in scowling silence, and soon\nwent out without a word of comment. The scene he had witnessed in the\nrose-house had poisoned his mind; yet, whenever he looked at Maud, or\ntried to speak to her, he was met with an air of such fierce and\nbeautiful defiance, that his eyes fell and his voice stuck in his\nthroat. So the piece of good fortune, so anxiously awaited in the\nhousehold, brought little delight when it came. Maud reported for duty\nnext day, and soon learned the routine of her work; but she grew more\nand more silent at home, and Saul's hope of a wedding in the family\ndied away.\n\nArthur Farnham walked away from the meeting with the feeling of a\nschool-boy who has finished a difficult task and who thinks he deserves\nsome compensating pleasure. The day had been fine and warm, but the\nbreeze of the late afternoon was already blowing in from the lake,\nlending freshness and life to the air. The sky was filled with soft\ngray clouds, which sailed along at a leisurely rate, evidently on very\ngood terms with the breeze. As Farnham walked up the avenue, he cast\nabout in his mind for the sort of dissipation with which he would\nreward himself for the day's work and he decided for a ride.\n\nBut as he was drawing on his boots, it occurred to him, for the first\ntime in his life, that it was a churlish and unneighborly proceeding\nfor him to go riding alone day after day, and that he would be doing no\nmore than his duty to offer his escort to Miss Belding. He said Miss\nBelding to his own thought--making it as formal and respectful as\npossible. So, sending an order to his groom to keep his horse at the\nstable for a moment, he walked over the lawn to the Belding cottage and\nasked for the ladies.\n\n\"I believe they are upstairs, sir. Walk into the drawing-room, and I\nwill see,\" said the neat housemaid, smiling at Farnham, as indeed was\nthe general custom of women. He took his seat in the cool and darkened\nroom facing the door-way, which commanded a view of the stairs. He sat\nin a large willow chair very much at his ease, looking about the pretty\nsalon, enjoying its pictures and ornaments and the fragrance of the\nroses in the vases, as if he had a personal interest in them. The maid\ncame back and said the ladies would be down in a moment.\n\nShe had announced Farnham to Mrs. Belding, who had replied, \"Tell him,\nin a moment.\" She was in the summer afternoon condition which the\nladies call \"dressing-sack,\" and after an inspection at the glass,\nwhich seemed unsatisfactory, she walked across the hall to her\ndaughter's room. She found Alice standing by the window, looking out\nupon the lake.\n\n\"There, I am glad you are all dressed. Arthur Farnham has called, and\nyou must go down and excuse me. I said I would come, but it will take\nme so long to dress, he will get tired of waiting. You run down and see\nhim. I suppose there is nothing particular.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma,\" said Alice, \"I don't want to see him, and especially not\nalone.\"\n\nMrs. Belding made large eyes in her surprise. \"Why, Alice, what has got\ninto you?\"\n\nAlice blushed and cast down her eyes. \"Mamma,\" she said, in a low\nvoice, \"do not ask me to go down. You know what you told me last\nnight.\"\n\n\"There, that will do,\" said the mother, with a tone of authority.\n\"Perhaps I was foolish to tell you that silly little story, but I am\nthe judge of who shall visit this house. You are too young to decide\nthese questions for me, and I insist that what I told you shall make no\ndifference in your treatment of Mr. Farnham. You think too much of your\nown part in the matter. He has come to see me, and not you, and I wish\nyou to go down and make my excuses for keeping him waiting. Will you\ngo?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will go,\" said the young girl. The blush had left her cheek and\nshe had become a trifle pale. She had not raised her eyes from the\nfloor during her mother's little speech; and when it was over and her\nmother had gone back to her room, Alice cast one glance at her mirror,\nand with a firm face walked down the stairs to the drawing-room.\nFarnham heard the rustle of her dress with a beating of the heart which\nfilled him with a delicious surprise. \"I am not past it, then,\" was the\nthought that came instantly to his mind, and in that one second was a\nsingular joy. When she came in sight on the stairs, it was like a\nsudden enchantment to him. Her beautiful head, crowned with its masses\nof hair drawn back into a simple Greek knot; her tall, strong figure,\ndraped in some light and clinging stuff which imposed no check on her\nnatural grace and dignity, formed a charming picture as she came down\nthe long stairs; and Farnham's eyes fastened eagerly upon her white\nhand as it glided along the dark walnut baluster. His heart went out to\nmeet her. He confessed to himself, with a lover's instantaneous\nconviction, that there was nothing in the world so utterly desirable as\nthat tall and fair-haired girl slowly descending the stairs. In the\nmidst of his tumultuous feeling a trivial thought occurred to him: \"I\nam shot through the heart by the blind archer,\" he said to himself; and\nhe no longer laughed at the old-fashioned symbol of the sudden and\nfatal power of love.\n\nBut with all this tumult of joy in the senses waking up to their\nallegiance, there came a certain reserve. The goddess-like creature who\nhad so suddenly become the mistress of his soul was a very serious\npersonage to confront in her new majesty. He did not follow the impulse\nof his heart and rush forward as she entered the room. He merely rose\nand bowed. She made the faintest possible salutation, and, without\ntaking a seat, conveyed her mother's excuses in a tone of such studied\ncoldness that it amused Farnham, who took it as a school-girl's\nassumption of a grand and ceremonious manner suitable to a tete-a-tete\nwith man.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, \"but I did not come especially to see your\nmother. My object was rather to see you.\" She did not smile or reply,\nand he went on, with a slight sensation of chill coming upon him from\nthis stony dignity, which, the more he observed it, seemed less and\nless amusing and not at all artificial. \"I came to ask if you would not\nlike to go to ride this afternoon. It is just gray enough for comfort.\"\n\n\"I thank you very much for being so kind as to think of me,\" she\nreplied, \"but it will not be convenient for me to go.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the morning will suit better. I will come to-morrow at any\nhour you say.\"\n\n\"I shall not be able to go to-morrow either, I think.\"\n\nEven while exchanging these few words, Alice felt herself growing\nslightly embarrassed, and it filled her with dismay. \"I am a poor\ncreature,\" she thought, \"if I cannot get this self-satisfied gentleman\nout of the house without breaking down. I can't stand here forever\nthough,\" and so she took a seat, and as Arthur resumed his willow chair\nwith an air of content, she could not but feel that as yet the skirmish\nwas not in her favor. She called her angry spirit to her aid, and\nnerved herself to say something which would promptly close the\ninterview.\n\nHis next words gave her the opportunity.\n\n\"But you surely do not intend to give up riding altogether?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I hope to ride a good deal. Andrews will go with me.\"\n\n\"Ah! Your objection to me as a groom is entirely personal, then.\"\n\n\"Now for it!\" she thought to herself, and she said firmly, \"Yes.\"\n\nBut the effort was too great, and after the word was launched her mouth\nbroke up into a nervous smile, for which she despised herself, but\nwhich she could not control for her life.\n\nFarnham was so pleased with the smile that he cared nothing for the\nword, and so he continued in a tone of anxious and coaxing good-nature,\nevery word increasing her trouble:\n\n\"You are wrong as you can be. I am a much better groom than Andrews. He\nhas rather more style, I admit, on account of his Scotch accent and his\nrheumatism. But I might acquire these. I will be very attentive and\nrespectful. I will ride at a proper distance behind you, if you will\noccasionally throw a word and a smile over your shoulder at me.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a quick vision flashed upon him of the loveliness of the\nhead and shoulder, and the coil of fair hair which he should have\nbefore him if he rode after her, and the illumination of the smile and\nthe word which would occasionally be thrown back to him from these\nperfect lips and teeth and eyes. His voice trembled with love and\neagerness as he pleaded for the privilege of taking her servant's\nplace. Alice no longer dared to interrupt him, and hardly ventured to\nlift her eyes from the floor. She had come down with the firm purpose\nof saying something to him which would put an end to all intimacy, and\nhere, before she had been five minutes in his presence, he was talking\nto her in a way that delighted her ears and her heart. He went rattling\non as if fearful that a pause might bring a change of mood. As she\nrarely looked up, he could feast his eyes upon her face, where now the\ncolor was coming and going, and on her shapely hands, which were\nclasped in her lap. He talked of Colorado as if it were settled that\nthey were to go there together, and they must certainly have some\npreliminary training in rough riding; and then, merely to make\nconversation, he spoke of other places that should only be visited on\nhorseback, always claiming in all of them his post of groom. Alice felt\nher trouble and confusion of spirit passing away as the light stream of\ntalk rippled on. She took little part in it at first, but from\nmonosyllables of assent she passed on to a word of reply from time to\ntime; and before she knew how it happened she was engaged in a frank\nand hearty interchange of thoughts and fancies, which brought her best\nfaculties into play and made her content with herself, in spite of the\noccasional intrusion of the idea that she had not been true to herself\nin letting her just anger die so quickly away.\n\nIf Farnham could have seen into the proud and honest heart of the young\ngirl he was talking to, he would have rested on the field he had won,\nand not tempted a further adventure. Her anger against him had been\ndissipated by the very effort she had made to give it effect, and she\nhad fallen insensibly into the old relation of good neighborhood and\nunreserved admiration with which she had always regarded him. She had\nsilenced her scruples by the thought that in talking pleasantly with\nhim she was obeying her mother, and that after all it was not her\nbusiness to judge him. If he could have known his own best interest, he\nwould have left her then, when her voice and her smile had become gay\nand unembarrassed according to their wont, with her conscience at ease\nabout his faults, and her mind filled with a pleasant memory of his\nvisit.\n\nBut such wisdom was beyond his reach. He had felt suddenly, and once\nfor all, in the last hour, the power and visible presence of his love.\nHe had never in his life been so moved by any passion as he was by the\njoy that stirred his heart when he heard the rustle of her dress in the\nhall and saw her white hand resting lightly on the dark wood of the\nstairs. As she walked into the parlor, from her face and her hair, from\nevery movement of her limbs, from every flutter of her soft and gauzy\ngarments, there came to him an assertion of her power over him that\nfilled him with a delicious awe. She represented to him, as he had\nnever felt it before, the embodied mystery and majesty of womanhood.\nDuring all the long conversation that had followed, he had been\nconscious of a sort of dual operation of his mind, like that familiar\nto the eaters of hashish. With one part of him he had been carrying on\na light and shallow conversation, as an excuse to remain in her\npresence and to keep his eyes upon her, and with all the more active\nenergies of his being he had been giving himself up to an act of\npassionate adoration of her. The thoughts that uttered themselves to\nhim, as he chatted about all sorts of indifferent things, were\nsomething like these: How can it have ever happened that such beauty,\nsuch dignity, such physical perfection could come together in one\nperson, and the best and sweetest heart have met them there? If she\nknew her value, her pride would ruin her. In her there is everything,\nand everything else beside: Galatea, the statue, with a Christian soul.\nShe is the best that could fall to any man, but better for me than for\nany one else. Anybody who sees her must love her, but I was made for\nnothing else but to love her. This is what mythologies meant. She is\nVenus: she loves laughter, and her teeth and lips are divine. She is\nDiana: she makes the night beautiful; she has the eye and the arm of an\nathlete goddess. But she is a woman: she is Mrs. Belding's daughter\nAlice. Thank heaven, she lives here. I can call and see her. To-morrow,\nI shall ride with her. She will love and marry some day like other\nwomen. Who is the man who shall ever kiss her between those straight\nbrows? And fancies more audacious and extravagant fed the fever of his\nheart as he talked deliberate small talk, still holding his hat and\nwhip in his hand.\n\nHe knew it was time he should go, but could not leave the joy of his\neyes and ears. At last his thoughts, like a vase too full, ran over\ninto speech. It was without premeditation, almost without conscious\nintention. The under-tone simply became dominant and overwhelmed the\nfrivolous surface talk. She had been talking of her mother's plans of\nsummer travel, and he suddenly interrupted her by saying in the most\nnatural tone in the world: \"I must see your mother before she decides.\nI hope you will make no plans without me. I shall go where you go. I\nshall never be away from you again, if I can help it. No, no, do not\nfrown about it. I must tell you. I love you; my whole life is yours.\"\n\nShe felt terribly shocked and alarmed, not so much at his words as at\nher own agitation. She feared for a moment she could not rise from her\nseat, but she did so with an effort. He rose and approached her,\nevidently held in check by her inflexible face; for the crisis had\nbrought a momentary self-control with it, and she looked formidable\nwith her knit brows and closed lips.\n\n\"Do not go,\" he pleaded. \"Do not think I have been wanting in respect\nand consideration. I could not help saying what I did. I cannot live\nwithout you any more than I can without light and sunshine. I ought to\nhave waited and not startled you. But I have only begun to live since I\nloved you, and I feel I must not waste time.\"\n\nShe was deeply disturbed at these wild and whirling words, but still\nbore herself bravely. She felt her heart touched by the vibration of\nhis ardent speech, but her maiden instinct of self defence enabled her\nto stand on her guard. Though beaten by the storm of his devotion, she\nsaid to herself that she could get away if she could keep from crying\nor sobbing, and one thought which came to her with the swiftness of\nlightning gave her strength to resist. It was this: \"If I cry, he will\ntake me in his arms, and we shall repeat the tableau mamma saw in the\nrose-house.\"\n\nStrong in that stimulating thought, she said: \"I am too sorry to hear\nyou say these things. You know how much we have always thought of you.\nIf you forget all this, and never repeat it, we may still be friends.\nBut if you renew this subject, I will never speak to you again alone,\nas long as I live.\"\n\nHe began to protest; but she insisted, with the calm cruelty of a woman\nwho sees her advantage over the man she loves. \"If you say another\nword, it is the end of our acquaintance, and perhaps it is best that it\nshould end. We can hardly be again as we were.\"\n\nFarnham was speechless, like one waked in the cold air out of a\ntropical dream. He had been carried on for the last hour in a whirlwind\nof emotion, and now he had met an obstacle against which it seemed that\nnothing could be done. If he had planned his avowal, he might have been\nprepared for rejection; but he had been hurried into it with no thought\nof what the result would be, and he was equally unprovided for either\nissue. In face of the unwavering voice and bearing of Alice, who seemed\nten times more beautiful than ever as she stood before him as steady\nand unresponsive as a young Fate, his hot speech seemed suddenly\nsmitten powerless. He only said:\n\n\"It shall be as you wish. If I ever offend you again, I will take my\npunishment upon myself and get out of your way.\"\n\nShe did not dare to say another word, for fear it would be too kind.\nShe gave him her hand; it was soft and warm as he pressed it; and if he\nhad only known how much softer and warmer her heart was, he would have\ncovered her hand with a thousand kisses. But he bowed and took his\nleave, and she stood by the lattice and saw him go away, with eyes full\nof tears and a breast filled with the tenderest ruth and pity--for him\nand for herself.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nTHE SANTA RITA SHERRY.\n\n\nFarnham walked down the path to the gate, then turned to go to his own\nhouse, with no very definite idea of what direction he was taking. The\ninterview he had just had was still powerfully affecting his senses, he\nwas conscious of no depression from the prompt and decided refusal he\nhad received. He was like a soldier in his first battle who has got a\nsharp wound which does not immediately cripple him, the perception of\nwhich is lost in the enjoyment of a new, keen, and enthralling\nexperience. His thoughts were full of his own avowal, of the beauty of\nhis young mistress, rather than of her coldness. Seeing his riding-whip\nin his hand, he stared at it an instant, and then at his boots, with a\nsudden recollection that he had intended to ride. He walked rapidly to\nthe stable, where his horse was still waiting, and rode at a brisk trot\nout of the avenue for a few blocks, and then struck off into a sandy\npath that led to the woods by the river-side.\n\nAs he rode, his thoughts were at first more of himself than of Alice.\nHe exulted over the discovery that he was in love as if some great and\nunimagined good fortune had happened to him. \"I am not past it, then,\"\nhe said to himself, repeating the phrase which had leaped from his\nheart when he saw Alice descending the stairs. \"I hardly thought that\nsuch a thing could ever happen to me. She is the only one.\" His\nthoughts ran back to a night in Heidelberg, when he sat in the shadow\nof the castle wall with a German student of his acquaintance, and\nlooked far over the valley at the lights of the town and the rippling\nwaves of the Neckar, silvered by the soft radiance of the summer moon.\n\n\"Poor Hammerstein! How he raved that night about little Bertha von\nEichholz. He called her _Die Einzige_ something like a thousand times.\nIt seemed an absurd thing to say; I knew dozens just like her, with\nblue eyes and Gretchen braids. But Hammerstein meant it, for he shot\nhimself the week after her wedding with the assessor. But mine _is_ the\nOnly One--though she is not mine. I would rather love her without hope\nthan be loved by any other woman in the world.\"\n\nA few days before he had been made happy by perceiving that she was no\nlonger a child; now he took infinite pleasure in the thought of her\nyouth; he tilled his mind and his senses with the image of her\nfreshness, her clear, pure color, the outline of her face and form.\n\"She is young and fragrant as spring; she has every bloom and charm of\nbody and soul,\" he said to himself, as he galloped over the shady\nwoodland road. In his exalted mood, he had almost forgotten how he had\nleft her presence. He delighted in his own roused and wakened passion,\nas a devotee in his devotions, without considering what was to come of\nit all. The blood was surging through his veins. He was too strong, his\nlove was too new and wonderful to him, to leave any chance for despair.\nIt was not that he did not consider himself dismissed. He felt that he\nhad played a great stake foolishly, and lost. But the love was there,\nand it warmed and cheered his heart, like a fire in a great hall,\nmaking even the gloom noble.\n\nHe was threading a bridle-path which led up a gentle ascent to a hill\noverlooking the river, when his horse suddenly started back with a\nsnort of terror as two men emerged from the thicket and grasped at his\nrein. He raised his whip to strike one of them down; the man dodged,\nand his companion said, \"None o' that, or I'll shoot your horse.\" The\nsun had set, but it was yet light, and he saw that the fellow had a\ncocked revolver in his hand.\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\" he asked.\n\n\"I want you to stop where you are and go back,\" said the man sullenly.\n\n\"Why should I go back? My road lies the other way. You step aside and\nlet me pass.\"\n\n\"You can't pass this way. Go back, or I'll make you,\" the man growled,\nshifting his pistol to his left hand and seizing Farnham's rein with\nhis right. His intention evidently was to turn the horse around and\nstart him down the path by which he had come. Farnham saw his\nopportunity and struck the hand that held the pistol a smart blow. The\nweapon dropped, but went off with a sharp report as it fell. The horse\nreared and plunged, but the man held firmly to the rein. His companion,\njoined by two or three other rough-looking men who rushed from the\nthicket, seized the horse and held him firmly, and pulled Farnham from\nthe saddle. They attempted no violence and no robbery. The man who had\nheld the pistol, a black-visaged fellow with a red face and dyed\nmustache, after rubbing his knuckles a moment, said: \"Let's take it out\no' the ---- whelp!\" But another, to whom the rest seemed to look as a\nleader, said: \"Go slow, Mr. Bowersox; we want no trouble here.\"\n\nFarnham at this addressed the last speaker and said, \"Can you tell me\nwhat all this means? You don't seem to be murderers. Are you\nhorse-thieves?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" said the man. \"We are Reformers.\"\n\nFarnham gazed at him with amazement. He was a dirty-looking man, young\nand sinewy, with long and oily hair and threadbare clothes, shiny and\nunctuous. His eyes were red and furtive, and he had a trick of passing\nhis hand over his mouth while he spoke. His mates stood around him,\nlistening rather studiedly to the conversation. They seemed of the lower\nclass of laboring men. Their appearance was so grotesque, in connection\nwith the lofty title their chief had given them, that Farnham could not\nhelp smiling, in spite of his anger.\n\n\"What is your special line of reform?\" he asked,--\"spelling, or civil\nservice?\"\n\n\"We are Labor Reformers,\" said the spokesman. \"We represent the toiling\nmillions against the bloated capitalists and grinding monopolies; we\nbelieve that man is better----\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt,\" interrupted Farnham; \"but how are you going to help\nthe toiling millions by stopping my horse on the highway?\"\n\n\"We was holding a meeting which was kep' secret for reasons\nsatisfactory to ourselves. These two gentlemen was posted here to keep\nout intruders from the lodge. If you had 'a' spoke civil to them, there\nwould have been no harm done. None will be done now if you want to go.\"\n\nFarnham at once mounted his horse. \"I would take it as a great favor,\"\nhe said, \"if you would give me your name and that of the gentleman with\nthe pistol. Where is he, by the way?\" he continued. The man they called\nBowersox had disappeared from the group around the spokesman. Farnham\nturned and saw him a little distance away directly behind him. He had\nrepossessed himself of his pistol and held it cocked in his hand.\n\n\"What do you want of our names?\" the spokesman asked.\n\nFarnham did not again lose sight of Bowersox. It occurred to him that\nthe interview might as well be closed. He therefore said, carelessly,\nwithout turning:\n\n\"A man has a natural curiosity to know the names of new acquaintances.\nBut no matter, I suppose the police know you,\" and rode away.\n\nBowersox turned to Offitt and said, \"Why in ---- did you let him go? I\ncould have knocked his head off and nobody knowed it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Offitt, coolly. \"And got hung for it.\"\n\n\"It would have been self-defence,\" said Bowersox. \"He hit me first.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Offitt, \"that closes up Greenwood Lodge. We\ncan't meet in this grass any more. I don't suppose he knows any of us\nby sight, or he'd have us up to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It was a piece of ---- nonsense, comin' out here, anyhow,\" growled\nBowersox, unwilling to be placated. \"You haven't done a ---- thing but\nlay around on the grass and eat peanuts and hear Bott chin.\"\n\n\"Brother Bott has delivered a splendid address on 'The Religion of\nNature,' and he couldn't have had a better hall than the Canopy to give\nit under,\" said Offitt. \"And now, gentlemen, we'd better get back our\nown way.\"\n\nAs Farnham rode home he was not much puzzled by his adventure in the\nwoods. He remembered having belonged, when he was a child of ten, to a\nweird and mysterious confraternity called \"Early Druids,\" which met in\nthe depths of groves, with ill-defined purposes, and devoted the hours\nof meeting principally to the consumption of confectionery. He had\nheard for the past few months of the existence of secret organizations\nof working-men--wholly outside of the trades-unions and unconnected\nwith them--and guessed at once that he had disturbed a lodge of one of\nthese clubs. His resentment did not last very long at the treatment to\nwhich he had been subjected; but still he thought it was not a matter\nof jest to have the roads obstructed by ruffians with theories in their\nheads and revolvers in their hands, neither of which they knew how to\nuse. He therefore promised himself to consult with the chief of police\nthe next morning in regard to the matter.\n\nAs he rode along, thinking of the occurrence, he was dimly conscious of\na pleasant suggestion in something he had seen among the hazel brush,\nand searching tenaciously in his recollection of the affair, it all at\nonce occurred to him that, among the faces of the men who came out of\nthe thicket in the scuffle, was that of the blonde-bearded, blue-eyed\nyoung carpenter who had been at work in his library the day Mrs.\nBelding and Alice lunched with him. He was pleased to find that the\npleasant association led him to memories of his love, but for a moment\na cloud passed over him at the thought of so frank and hearty a fellow\nand such a good workman being in such company. \"I must see if I cannot\nget him out of it,\" he said to himself, and then reverted again to\nthoughts of Alice.\n\nTwilight was falling, and its melancholy influence was beginning to\naffect him. He thought less and less of the joy of his love and more of\nits hopelessness. By the time he reached his house he had begun to\nconfront the possibility of a life of renunciation, and, after the\nmanner of Americans of fortune who have no special ties, his mind\nturned naturally to Europe. \"I cannot stay here to annoy her,\" he\nthought, and so began to plot for the summer and winter, and, in fancy,\nwas at the second cataract of the Nile before his horse's hoofs,\nringing on the asphalt of the stable-yard, recalled him to himself.\n\nThe next day, he was compelled to go to New York to attend to some\nmatters of business. Before taking the train, he laid his complaint of\nbeing stopped on the road before the chief of police, who promised to\nmake vigorous inquisition. Farnham remained several days in New York,\nand on his return, one warm, bright evening, he found his table\nprepared and the grave Budsey waiting behind his chair.\n\nHe ate his dinner hastily and in silence, with no great zest. \"You have\nnot forgot, sir,\" said Budsey, who was his external conscience in\nsocial matters, \"that you are going this evening to Mrs. Temple's?\"\n\n\"I think I shall not go.\"\n\n\"Mr. Temple was here this afternoon, sir, which he said it was most\nparticular. I asked him would he call again. He said no, he was sure of\nseeing you to-night. But it was most particular, he said.\"\n\nBudsey spoke in the tone of solemn and respectful tyranny which he\nalways assumed when reminding Farnham of his social duties, and which\nconveyed a sort of impression to his master that, if he did not do what\nwas befitting, his butler was quite capable of picking him up and\ndeferentially carrying him to the scene of festivity, and depositing\nhim on the door-step.\n\n\"What could Temple want to see me about 'most particular'?\" Farnham\nasked himself. \"After all, I may as well pass the evening there as\nanywhere.\"\n\nMr. Temple was one of the leading citizens of Buffland. He was the\nvice-president of the great rolling-mill company, whose smoke darkened\nthe air by day and lighted up the skies at night as with the flames of\nthe nether pit. He was very tall and very slender, with reddish-brown\nhair, eyes and mustache. Though a man of middle age, his trim figure,\nhis fashionable dress, and his clean shaven cheek and chin gave him an\nappearance of youth. He was president of the local jockey club, and the\njoy of his life was to take his place in the judges' stand, and sway\nthe destinies of the lean, keen-faced trainers who drove the trotting\nhorses. He had the eye of a lynx for the detection of any crookedness\nin driving, and his voice would ring out over the track like the trump\nof doom, conveying fines and penalties to the luckless trickster who\nwas trying to get some unfair advantage in the start. His voice, a deep\nbasso, rarely was heard, in fact, anywhere else. Though excessively\nsocial, he was also extremely silent. He gave delightful dinner-parties\nand a great many of them, but rarely spoke, except to recommend an\nespecially desirable wine to a favored guest. When he did speak,\nhowever, his profanity was phenomenal. Every second word was an oath.\nTo those who were not shocked by it there was nothing more droll and\nincongruous than to hear this quiet, reserved, well-dressed,\ngentleman-like person pouring out, on the rare occasions when he talked\nfreely, in a deep, measured, monotonous tone, a flood of imprecations\nwhich would have made a pirate hang his head. He had been, as a boy,\nclerk on a Mississippi River steamboat, and a vacancy occurring in the\noffice of mate, he had been promoted to that place. His youthful face\nand quiet speech did not sufficiently impose upon the rough deck-hands\nof that early day. They had been accustomed to harsher modes of address,\nand he saw his authority defied and in danger. So he set himself\nseriously to work to learn to swear; and though at first it made his\nheart shiver a little with horror and his cheek burn with shame, he\npersevered, as a matter of business, until his execrations amazed the\nroustabouts. When he had made a fortune, owned a line of steamboats, and\nfinally retired from the river, the habit had been fastened upon him,\nand oaths became to him the only form of emphatic speech. The hardest\nwork he ever did in his life was, while courting his wife, a Miss Flora\nBallston, of Cincinnati, to keep from mingling his ordinary forms of\nemphasis in his asseverations of affection. But after he was married,\nand thrown more and more into the company of women, that additional\nsense, so remarkable in men of his mould, came to him, and he never\nlapsed, in their presence, into his natural way of speech. Perhaps this\nwas the easier, as he rarely spoke at all when they were by--not that\nhe was in the least shy or timid, but because they, as a rule, knew\nnothing about stocks, or pig-iron, or wine, or trotting horses,--the\nonly subjects, in his opinion, which could interest any reasonable\ncreature.\n\nWhen Farnham arrived at his house, it was already pretty well filled\nwith guests. Mr. and Mrs. Temple were at the door, shaking hands with\ntheir friends as they arrived, she with a pleasant smile and word from\nher black eyes and laughing mouth, and he in grave and speechless\nhospitality.\n\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Farnham!\" said the good-natured lady. \"So glad to\nsee you. I began to be alarmed. So did the young ladies. They were\nafraid you had not returned. Show yourself in the drawing-room and\ndispel their fears. Oh, Mr. Harrison, I am so glad you resolved to stay\nover.\"\n\nFarnham gave way to the next comer, and said to Mr. Temple, who had\npressed his hand in silence:\n\n\"Did you want to see me for anything special to-day?\"\n\nMrs. Temple looked up at the word, and her husband said:\n\n\"No; I merely wanted you to take a drive with me.\"\n\nAnother arrival claimed Mrs. Temple's attention, and as Farnham moved\naway, Temple half-whispered in his ear, \"Don't go away till I get a\nchance to speak to you. There is merry and particular bloom of h---- to\npay.\"\n\nThe phrase, while vivid, was not descriptive, and Farnham could not\nguess what it meant. Perhaps something had gone wrong in the jockey\nclub; perhaps Goldsmith Maid was off her feed; perhaps pig-iron had\ngone up or down a dollar a ton. These were all subjects of profound\ninterest to Temple and much less to Farnham; so he waited patiently the\nhour of revelation, and looked about the drawing-room to see who was\nthere.\n\nIt was the usual drawing-room of provincial cities. The sofas and\nchairs were mostly occupied by married women, who drew a scanty\nentertainment from gossip with each other, from watching the\nproceedings of the spinsters, and chiefly, perhaps, from a\nconsciousness of good clothes. The married men stood grouped in corners\nand talked of their every-day affairs. The young people clustered\ntogether in little knots, governed more or less by natural selection--\nonly the veterans of several seasons pairing off into the discreet\nretirement of stairs and hall angles. At the further end of the long\ndrawing-room, Farnham's eyes at last lighted upon the object of his\nquest. Alice sat in the midst of a group of young girls who had\nintrenched themselves in a corner of the room, and defied all the\nefforts of skirmishing youths, intent upon flirtation, to dislodge\nthem. They seemed to be amusing themselves very well together, and the\ncorrect young men in white cravats and pointed shoes came, chatted, and\ndrifted away. They were the brightest and gayest young girls of the\nplace; and it would have been hard to detect any local color in them.\nYoung as they were, they had all had seasons in Paris and in\nWashington; some of them knew the life of that most foreign of all\ncapitals, New York. They nearly all spoke French and German better than\nthey did English, for their accent in those languages was very sweet\nand winning in its incorrectness, while their English was high-pitched\nand nasal, and a little too loud in company. They were as pretty as\ngirls are anywhere, and they wore dresses designed by Mr. Worth, or his\nNew York rivals, Loque and Chiffon; but they occasionally looked across\nthe room with candid and intelligent envy at maidens of less\npretensions, who were better dressed by the local artists.\n\nFarnham was stopped at some distance from the pretty group by a buxom\nwoman standing near the open window, cooling the vast spread of her\nbare shoulders in a current of air, which she assisted in its office\nwith a red-and-gold Japanese fan.\n\n\"Captain Farnham,\" she said, \"when are you going to give that\nlawn-tennis party you promised so long ago? My character for veracity\ndepends on it. I have told everybody it would be soon, and I shall be\ndisgraced if it is delayed much longer.\"\n\n\"That is the common lot of prophets, Mrs. Adipson,\" replied Farnham.\n\"You know they say in Wall Street that early and exclusive information\nwill ruin any man. But tell me, how is your club getting on?\" he\ncontinued disingenuously, for he had not the slightest interest in the\nclub; but he knew that once fairly started on the subject, Mrs. Adipson\nwould talk indefinitely, and he might stand there and torture his heart\nand delight his eyes with the beauty of Alice Belding.\n\nHe carried his abstraction a little too far, however, for the good lady\nsoon perceived, from his wandering looks and vague replies, that she\nwas not holding his attention. So she pettishly released him after\nfollowing the direction of his eyes, and said, \"There, I see you are\ncrazy to go and talk to Miss Dallas. I won't detain you. She _is_\nawfully clever, I suppose, though she never took the trouble to be\nbrilliant in my presence; and she is pretty when she wears her hair\nthat way--I never liked those frizzes.\"\n\nFarnham accepted his release with perhaps a little more gratitude than\ncourtesy, and moved away to take a seat which had just been vacated\nbeside Miss Dallas. He was filled with a boyish delight in Mrs.\nAdipson's error. \"That she should think I was worshipping Miss Dallas\nfrom afar! Where do women keep their eyes? To think that anybody should\nlook at Miss Dallas when Alice Belding was sitting beside her.\" It was\npleasant to think, however, that the secret of his unhappy love was\nsafe. Nobody was gossiping about it, and using the name of his beloved\nin idle conjectures. That was as it should be. His love was sacred from\nrude comment. He could go and sit by Miss Dallas, so near his beloved\nthat he could see every breath move the lace on her bosom. He could\nwatch the color come and go on her young cheek. He could hear every\nword her sweet voice uttered, and nobody would know he was conscious of\nher existence.\n\nFull of this thought, he sat down by Miss Dallas, who greeted him\nwarmly and turned her back upon her friends. By looking over her\nshining white shoulder, he could see the clear, pure profile of Alice\njust beyond, so near that he could have laid his hand on the crinkled\ngold of her hair. He then gave himself up to that duplex act to which\nall unavowed lovers are prone--the simultaneous secret worship of one\nwoman and open devotion to another. It never occurred to him that there\nwas anything unfair in this, or that it would be as reprehensible to\nthrow the name of Miss Dallas into the arena of gossip as that of Miss\nBelding. That was not his affair; there was only one person in the\nuniverse to be considered by him. And for Miss Dallas's part, she was\nthe last person in the world to suspect any one of being capable of the\ntreason and bad taste of looking over her shoulder at another woman.\nShe was, by common consent, the belle of Buffland. Her father was a\nwidowed clergyman, of good estate, of literary tendencies, of enormous\npersonal vanity, who had abandoned the pulpit in a quarrel with his\nsession several years before, and now occupied himself in writing poems\nand sketches of an amorous and pietistic nature, which in his opinion\nembodied the best qualities of Swinburne and Chalmers combined, but\nwhich the magazines had thus far steadily refused to print.\n\nHe felt himself infinitely superior to the society of Buffland,--with\none exception,--and only remained there because his property was not\neasily negotiable and required his personal care. The one exception was\nhis daughter Euphrasia. He had educated her after his own image. In\nfact, there was a remarkable physical likeness between them, and he had\nimpressed upon her every trick of speech and manner and thought which\ncharacterized himself. This is the young lady who turns her bright,\nkeen, beautiful face upon Farnham, with eyes eager to criticise, a\ntongue quick to flatter and to condemn, a head stuffed full of poetry\nand artificial passion, and a heart saved from all danger by its\nidolatry of her father and herself.\n\n\"So glad to see you--one sees so little of you--I can hardly believe my\ngood fortune--how have I this honor?\" All this in hard, rapid\nsentences, with a brilliant smile.\n\nFarnham thought of the last words of Mrs. Adipson, and said,\nintrepidly, \"Well, you know the poets better than I do, Miss Euphrasia,\nand there is somebody who says, 'Beauty draws us by the simple way she\ndoes her hair'--or something like it. That classic fillet was the first\nthing I saw as I entered the room, and _me voici!_\"\n\nWe have already said that the fault of Farnham's conversation with\nwomen was the soldier's fault of direct and indiscriminate compliment.\nBut this was too much in Euphrasia's manner for her to object to it.\nShe laughed and said, \"You deserve a _pensum_ of fifty lines for such a\nmisquotation. But, _dites-donc, monsieur_\"--for French was one of her\nfavorite affectations, and when she found a man to speak it with, she\nrode the occasion to death. There had been a crisis in the French\nministry a few days before, and she now began a voluble conversation on\nthe subject, ostensibly desiring Farnham's opinion on the crisis, but\nreally seizing the opportunity of displaying her familiarity with the\nnames of the new cabinet. She talked with great spirit and animation,\nsometimes using her fine eyes point-blank upon Farnham, sometimes\nglancing about to observe the effect she was creating; which gave\nFarnham his opportunity to sigh his soul away over her shoulder to\nwhere Alice was sweetly and placidly talking with her friends.\n\nShe had seen him come in, and her heart had stood still for a moment;\nbut her feminine instinct sustained her, and she had not once glanced\nin his direction. But she was conscious of every look and action of\nhis; and when he approached the corner where she was sitting, she felt\nas if a warm and embarrassing ray of sunshine was coming near her, She\nwas at once relieved and disappointed when he sat down by Miss Dallas.\nShe thought to herself: \"Perhaps he will never speak to me again. It is\nall my fault. I threw him away. But it was not my fault. It was his--it\nwas hers. I do not know what to think. He might have let me alone. I\nliked him so much. I have only been a month out of school. What shall I\ndo if he never speaks to me again?\" Yet such is the power which, for\nself-defence, is given to young maidens that, while these tumultuous\nthoughts were passing through her mind, she talked and laughed with the\ngirls beside her, and exchanged an occasional word with the young men\nin pointed shoes, as if she had never known a grief or a care.\n\nMr. Furrey came up to say good-evening, with his most careful bow.\nLowering his voice, he said:\n\n\"There's Miss Dallas and Captain Farnham flirting in Italian.\"\n\n\"Are you sure they are flirting?\"\n\n\"Of course they are. Just look at them!\"\n\n\"If you are sure they are flirting, I don't think it is right to look\nat them. Still, if you disapprove of it very much, you might speak to\nthem about it,\" she suggested, in her sweet, low, serious voice.\n\n\"Oh, that would never do for a man of my age,\" replied Furrey, in good\nfaith. He was very vain of his youth.\n\n\"What I wanted to speak to you about was this,\" he continued. \"There is\ngoing to be a Ree-gatta on the river the day after to-morrow, and I\nhope you will grant me the favor of your company. The Wissagewissametts\nare to row with the Chippagowaxems, and it will be the finest race this\nyear. Billy Raum, you know, is stroke of the------\"\n\nHer face was still turned to him, but she had ceased to listen. She was\nlost in contemplation of what seemed to her a strange and tragic\nsituation. Farnham was so near that she could touch him, and yet so far\naway that he was lost to her forever. No human being knew, or ever\nwould know, that a few days ago he had offered her his life, and she\nhad refused the gift. Nobody in this room was surprised that he did not\nspeak to her, or that she did not look at him. Nobody dreamed that he\nloved her, and she would die, she resolved deliberately, before she\nwould let anybody know that she loved him. \"For I do love him with my\nwhole heart,\" she said to herself, with speechless energy, which sent\nthe blood up to her temples, and left her, in another instant, as pale\nas a lily.\n\nFurrey at that moment had concluded his enticing account of the\nregatta, and she had quietly declined to accompany him. He moved away,\nindignant at her refusal, and puzzled by the blush which accompanied\nit.\n\n\"What did that mean?\" he mused. \"I guess it was because I said the\ncrews rowed in short sleeves.\"\n\nFarnham also saw the blush, in the midst of a disquisition which Miss\nDallas was delivering upon a new poem of Francois Coppee. He saw the\nclear, warm color rise and subside like the throbbing of an auroral\nlight in a starry night. He thought he had never seen anything so\nlovely, but he wondered \"what that oaf could have said to make her\nblush like that. Can it be possible that he----\" His brow knitted with\nanger and contempt.\n\n\"_Mais, qu'est-ce que vous avez donc?_\" asked Euphrasia.\n\nFarnham was saved from the necessity of an explanation by Mr. Temple,\nwho came up at that moment, and, laying a hand on Arthur's shoulder,\nsaid:\n\n\"Now we will go into my den and have a glass of that sherry. I know no\nless temptation than Tio Pepe could take you away from Miss Dallas.\"\n\n\"Thank you awfully,\" said the young lady. \"Why should you not give Miss\nDallas herself an opportunity to decline the Tio Pepe?\"\n\n\"Miss Dallas shall have some champagne in a few minutes, which she will\nlike very much better. Age and wickedness are required to appreciate\nsherry.\"\n\n\"Ah! I congratulate your sherry; it is about to be appreciated,\" said\nthe deserted beauty, tartly, as the men moved away.\n\nThey entered the little room which Temple called his den, which was a\nlitter of letter-books, stock-lists, and the advertising pamphlets of\nwine-merchants. The walls were covered with the portraits of trotting\nhorses; a smell of perpetual tobacco was in the air. Temple unlocked a\ncupboard, and took out a decanter and some glasses. He filled two, and\ngave one to Arthur, and held the other under his nose.\n\n\"Farnham,\" he said, with profound solemnity, \"if you don't call that\nthe\"--(I decline to follow him in the pyrotechnical combination of\noaths with which he introduced the next words)--\"best sherry you ever\nsaw, then I'm a converted pacer with the ringbone.\"\n\nArthur drank his wine, and did not hesitate to admit all that its owner\nhad claimed for it. He had often wondered how such a man as Temple had\nacquired such an unerring taste.\n\n\"Temple,\" he said, \"how did you ever pick up this wine; and, if you\nwill excuse the question, how did you know it when you got it?\"\n\nTemple smiled, evidently pleased with the question. \"You've been in\nSpain, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Farnham.\n\n\"You know this is the genuine stuff, then?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it.\"\n\n\"_How_ do you know?\"\n\n\"The usual way--by seeing and drinking it at the tables of men who know\nwhat they are about.\"\n\n\"Well, I have never been out of the United States, and yet I have\nlearned about wine in just the same way. I commenced in New Orleans\namong the old Spanish and French Creoles, and have kept it up since,\nhere and there. I can see in five minutes whether a man knows anything\nabout his wine. If he does, I remember every word he says--that is my\nstrong point--head and tongue. I can't remember sermons and speeches,\nbut I can remember every syllable that Sam Ward said one night at your\ngrandfather's ten years ago; and if I have once tasted a good wine, I\nnever forget its fashion of taking hold.\"\n\nThis is an expurgated edition of what he said; his profanity kept up a\nrunning accompaniment, like soft and distant rolling thunder.\n\n\"I got this wine at the sale of the Marquis of Santa Rita. I heard you\nspeak of him, I don't know how long ago, and the minute I read in the\npaper that he had turned up his toes, I cabled the consul at Cadiz--you\nknow him, a wild Irishman named Calpin--to go to the sale of his\neffects and get this wine. He cabled back, 'What shall I pay?' I\nanswered, 'Head your dispatch again: Get means get!' Some men have got\nno sense. I did not mind the price of the wine, but it riled me to have\nto pay for the two cables.\"\n\nHe poured out another glass and drank it drop by drop, getting, as he\nsaid, \"the worth of his money every time.\"\n\n\"Have some more?\" he said to Farnham.\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll put it away. No use of giving it to men who would prefer\nsixty-cent whiskey.\"\n\nHaving done this, he turned again to Farnham, and said, \"I told you the\nOld Boy was to pay. This is how. The labor unions have ordered a\ngeneral strike; day not fixed; they are holding meetings all over town\nto-night. I'll know more about it after midnight.\"\n\n\"What will it amount to?\" asked Farnham.\n\n\"Keen savey?\" replied Temple, in his Mississippi River Spanish. \"The\nfirst thing will be the closing of the mills, and putting anywhere from\nthree thousand to ten thousand men on the streets. Then, if the strike\ngains the railroad men, we shall be embargoed, ---- boiling, and\nsafety-valve riveted down.\"\n\nFarnham had no thought of his imperilled interests. He began instantly\nto conjecture what possibility of danger there might be of a\ndisturbance of public tranquillity, and to wish that the Beldings were\nout of town.\n\n\"How long have you known this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only certainly for a few hours. The thing has been talked about more\nor less for a month, but we have had our own men in the unions and did\nnot believe it would come to an extremity. To-day, however, they\nbrought ugly reports; and I ought to tell you that some of them concern\nyou.\"\n\nFarnham lifted his eyebrows inquiringly.\n\n\"We keep men to loaf with the tramps and sleep in the boozing kens. One\nof them told me to-day that at the first serious disturbance a lot of\nbad eggs among the strikers--not the unionists proper, but a lot of\nloose fish--intend to go through some of the principal houses on\nAlgonquin Avenue, and they mentioned yours as one of them.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I will try to be ready for them,\" said Farnham. But, cool\nand tried as was his courage, he could not help remembering, with\nsomething like dread, that Mrs. Belding's house was next to his own,\nand that in case of riot the two might suffer together.\n\n\"There is one thing more I wanted to say,\" Mr. Temple continued, with a\nslight embarrassment. \"If I can be of any service to you, in case of a\nrow, I want to be allowed to help.\"\n\n\"As to that,\" Farnham said with a laugh, \"you have your own house and\nstables to look after, which will probably be as much as you can\nmanage.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Temple, earnestly, \"that ain't the case. I will have to\nexplain to you\"--and a positive blush came to his ruddy face. \"They\nwon't touch me or my property. They say a man who uses such good horses\nand such bad language as I do--that's just what they say--is one of\nthem, and sha'n't be racketed. I ain't very proud of my popularity, but\nI am willing to profit by it and I'll come around and see you if\nanything more turns up. Now, we'll go and give Phrasy Dallas that glass\nof champagne.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nA HOLIDAY NOT IN THE CALENDAR.\n\n\nThe next morning while Farnham was at breakfast he received a note from\nMr. Temple in these words:\n\n\"Strikes will begin to-day, but will not be general. There will be no\ndisturbance, I think. They don't seem very gritty.\"\n\nAfter breakfast he walked down to the City Hall. On every street corner\nhe saw little groups of men in rather listless conversation. He met an\nacquaintance crossing the street.\n\n\"Have you heard the news?\" The man's face was flushed with pleasure at\nhaving something to tell--\"The firemen and stokers have all struck, and\nrun their engines into the round-house at Riverley, five miles out.\nThere won't be a train leave or come in for the present.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"No, that ain't a start. The Model Oil men have struck, and are all\nover the North End, shutting up the other shops. They say there won't\nbe a lick of work done in town the rest of the week.\"\n\n\"Except what Satan finds for idle hands,\" Farnham suggested, and\nhastened his steps a little to the municipal buildings.\n\nHe found the chief of police in his office, suffering from nervousness\nand a sense of importance. He began by reminding him of the occurrence\nof the week before in the wood. The chief waited with an absent\nexpression for the story to end, and then said, \"My dear sir, I cannot\npay any attention to such little matters with anarchy threatening our\ncity. I must protect life and property, sir--life and property.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" rejoined Farnham, \"I am informed that life and property\nare threatened in my own neighborhood. Can you detail a few policemen\nto patrol Algonquin Avenue, in case of a serious disturbance?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you, my dear sir; I will do the best I can by all\nsections. Why, man,\" he cried, in a voice which suddenly grew a shrill\nfalsetto in his agitation, \"I tell you I haven't a policeman for every\nten miles of street in this town. I can't spare but two for my own\nhouse!\"\n\nFarnham saw the case was hopeless, and went to the office of the mayor.\nThat official had assumed an attitude expressive of dignified and\ndauntless energy. He sat in a chair tilted back on its hind feet; the\nboots of the municipal authority were on a desk covered with official\npapers; a long cigar adorned his eloquent lips; a beaver hat shaded his\neyes.\n\nHe did not change his attitude as Farnham entered. He probably thought\nit could not be changed for the better.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Quinlin.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, sirr, to you.\" This salutation was uttered through teeth\nshut as tightly as the integrity of the cigar would permit.\n\n\"There is a great deal of talk of possible disturbance to-night, in\ncase the strikes extend. My own neighborhood, I am told, has been\ndirectly threatened. I called to ask whether, in case of trouble, I\ncould rely on any assistance from the city authorities, or whether we\nmust all look out for ourselves.\"\n\nThe mayor placed his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat, and\nthrew his head back so that he could stare at Farnham from below his\nhat brim. He then said, in a measured voice, as if addressing an\nassembly: \"Sirr! I would have you to know that the working-men of\nBuffland are not thieves and robbers. In this struggle with capital\nthey have my profound sympathy. I expect their conduct to be that of\nperr-fect gentlemen. I, at least, will give no orders which may tend to\narray one class of citizens against another. That is my answer, sirr; I\nhope it does not disappoint you.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Farnham, putting on his hat. \"It is precisely\nwhat I should have expected of you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sirr. Call again, sirr.\"\n\nAs Farnham disappeared, the chief magistrate of the city tilted his hat\nto one side, shut an eye with profoundly humorous significance, and\nsaid to the two or three loungers who had been enjoying the scene:\n\n\"That is the sort of T-rail I am. That young gentleman voted agin me,\non the ground I wasn't high-toned enough.\"\n\nFarnham walked rapidly to the office of the evening newspaper. He found\na man in the counting-room, catching flies and trimming their wings\nwith a large pair of office shears. He said, \"Can you put an\nadvertisement for me in your afternoon editions?\"\n\nThe man laid down his shears, but held on to his fly, and looked at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Have you got it ready?\"\n\n\"No, but I will not be a minute about it.\"\n\n\"Be lively! You haven't got but a minute.\"\n\nHe picked up his scissors and resumed his surgery, while Farnham wrote\nhis advertisement. The man took it, and threw it into a tin box, blew a\nwhistle, and the box disappeared through a hole in the ceiling. A few\nminutes later the boys were crying the paper in the streets. The\nadvertisement was in these words:\n\n\"Veterans, Attention! All able-bodied veterans of the Army of the\nPotomac, and especially of the Third Army Corps, are requested to meet\nat seven this evening, at No. -- Public Square.\"\n\nFrom the newspaper office Farnham went to a gunsmith's. The dealer was\na German and a good sportsman, whom Farnham knew very well, having\noften shot with him in the marshes west of the city. His name was\nLeopold Grosshammer. There were two or three men in the place when\nFarnham entered. He waited until they were gone, and then said:\n\n\"Bolty, have you two dozen repeating rifles?\"\n\n\"Ja wohl! Aber, Herr Gott, was machen Sie denn damit?\"\n\n\"I don't know why I shouldn't tell you. They think there may be a riot\nin town, and they tell me at the City Hall that everybody must look out\nfor himself. I am going to try to get up a little company of old\nsoldiers for patrol duty.\"\n\n\"All right, mine captain, and I will be the first freiwilliger. But I\ndon't dink you wants rifles. Revolvers and clubs--like the pleecemen--\ndat's de dicket.\"\n\n\"Have you got them?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, and the belts thereto. I got der gondract to furnish 'em to\nde city.\"\n\n\"Then you will send them, wrapped up in bundles, to my office in the\nSquare, and come yourself there at seven.\"\n\n\"Freilich,\" said Leopold, his white teeth glistening through his yellow\nbeard at the prospect of service.\n\nFarnham spent an hour or two visiting the proprietors of the large\nestablishments affected by the strikes. He found, as a rule, great\nannoyance and exasperation, but no panic. Mr. Temple said, \"The\npoor ------ fools! I felt sorry for them. They came up here to me this\nmorning,--their committee, they called it,--and told me they hated it,\nbut it was orders! 'Orders from where?' I asked. 'From the chiefs of\nsections,' they said; and that was all I could get out of them. Some of\nthe best fellows in the works were on the committee. They put 'em there\non purpose. The sneaks and lawyers hung back.\"\n\n\"What will they do if the strike should last?\" asked Farnham.\n\n\"They will be supported for awhile by the other mills. Our men are the\nonly ones that have struck so far. They were told off to make the move,\njust as they march out a certain regiment to charge a battery. If we\ngive in, then another gang will strike.\"\n\n\"Do you expect to give in?\"\n\n\"Between us, we want nothing better than ten days' rest. We want to\nrepair our furnaces, and we haven't a ---- thing to do. What I told you\nthis morning holds good. There won't be any riot. The whole thing is\nsolemn fooling, so far.\"\n\nThe next man Farnham saw was in a far less placid frame of mind. It was\nJimmy Nelson, the largest grocer in the city. He had a cargo of\nperishable groceries at the station, and the freight hands would not\nlet them be delivered. \"I talked to the rascals,\" he said. \"I asked\nthem what they had against _me_; that they was injuring Trade!\" a deity\nof which Mr. Nelson always spoke with profound respect. \"They laughed\nin my face, sir. They said, 'That's just our racket. We want to squeeze\nyou respectable merchants till you get mad and hang a railroad\npresident or two!' Yes, sir; they said that to me, and five thousand\ndollars of my stuff rotting in the depot.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go to the mayor?\" asked Farnham, though he could not\nsuppress a smile as he said it.\n\n\"Yes, I like that!\" screamed Jimmy. \"You are laughing at me. I suppose\nthe whole town has heard of it. Well, it's a fact. I went and asked\nthat infernal scoundrel what he was going to do. He said his function\nwas to keep the peace, and there wasn't a word in the statutes about\nNorth Carliny water-melons. If I live till he gets out of office, I'll\nlick him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think you won't do that, Jimmy.\"\n\n\"You think I won't!\" said Nelson, absolutely incandescent with the\nstory of his wrongs. \"I'll swear by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, that\nI will thrash the hide off him next spring--if I don't forget it.\"\n\nFarnham went home, mounted his horse, and rode about the city to see\nwhat progress the strike was making. There was little disorder visible\non the surface of things. The \"sections\" had evidently not ordered a\ngeneral cessation of labor; and yet there were curious signs of\ndemoralization, as if the spirit of work was partially disintegrating\nand giving way to something not precisely lawless, but rather listless.\nFor instance, a crowd of workmen were engaged industriously and, to all\nappearance, contentedly upon a large school-building in construction. A\ngroup of men, not half their number, approached them and ordered them\nto leave off work. The builders looked at each other and then at their\nexhorters in a confused fashion for a moment, and ended by obeying the\nsummons in a sullen and indifferent manner. They took off their aprons,\nwent to the hydrant and washed their hands, then put on their coats and\nwent home in silence and shamefacedness, amid the angry remonstrances\nof the master-builder. A little farther on Farnham saw what seemed like\na burlesque of the last performance. Several men were at work in a hole\nin the street; the tops of their heads were just visible above the\nsurface. A half-grown, ruffianly boy, with a boot-black's box slung\nover his shoulder, came up and shouted, \"You ---- ---- rats, come out\nof that, or we'll knock the scalps off'n you.\" The men, without even\nlooking to see the source of the summons, threw down their tools and\ngot out of the hole. The boy had run away; they looked about for a\nmoment, as if bewildered, and then one of them, a gray-headed Irishman,\nsaid, \"Well, we'd better be a lavin' off, if the rest is,\" and they all\nwent away.\n\nIn this fashion it came about that by nightfall all the squares and\npublic places were thronged with an idle and expectant crowd, not\nactively mischievous or threatening, but affording a vast mass of\ninflammable material in case the fire should start in any quarter. They\ngathered everywhere in dense groups, exchanging rumors and surmises, in\nwhich fact and fiction were fantastically mingled.\n\n\"The rolling-mills all close to-morrow,\" said a sallow and hollow-eyed\ntailor. \"That'll let loose twenty thousand men on the town,--big,\nbrawny fellows. I'm glad my wife is in Clairfield.\"\n\n\"All you know about it! Clairfield is twice as bad off as here. The\nmachine shops has all struck there, and the men went through the armory\nthis afternoon. They're camped all along Delaware street, every man\nwith a pair of revolvers and a musket.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" said the schneider, turning a shade more sallow.\n\"I'd better telegraph my wife to come home.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't hurry,\" was the impassive response. \"You don't know where\nwe'll be to-morrow. They have been drilling all day at Riverley, three\nthousand of 'em. They'll come in to-morrow, mebbe, and hang all the\nrailroad presidents. That may make trouble.\"\n\nThrough these loitering and talking crowds Farnham made his way in the\nevening to the office which he kept, on the public square of the town,\nfor the transaction of the affairs of his estate. He had given\ndirections to his clerk to be there, and when he arrived found that\nsome half-dozen men had already assembled in answer to his\nadvertisement. Some of them he knew; one, Nathan Kendall, a powerful\nyoung man, originally from the north of Maine, now a machinist in\nBuffland, had been at one time his orderly in the army. Bolty\nGrosshammer was there, and in a very short time some twenty men were in\nthe room. Farnham briefly explained to them his intention. \"I want\nyou,\" he said, \"to enlist for a few days' service under my orders. I\ncannot tell whether there will be any work to do or not; but it is\nlikely we shall have a few nights of patrol at least. You will get ten\ndollars apiece anyhow, and ordinary day's wages besides. If any of you\nget hurt, I will try to have you taken care of.\"\n\nAll but two agreed to the proposition. These two said \"they had\nfamilies and could not risk their skins. When they saw the\nadvertisement they had thought it was something about pensions, or the\ncounty treasurer's office. They thought soldiers ought to have the\nfirst chance at good offices.\" They then grumblingly withdrew.\n\nFarnham kept his men for an hour longer, arranging some details of\norganization, and then dismissed them for twenty-four hours, feeling\nassured that there would be no disturbance of public tranquillity that\nnight. \"I will meet you here to morrow evening,\" he said, \"and you can\nget your pistols and sticks and your final orders.\"\n\nThe men went out one by one, Bolty and Kendall waiting for a while\nafter they had gone and going out on the sidewalk with Farnham. They\nhad instinctively appointed themselves a sort of bodyguard to their old\ncommander, and intended to keep him in sight until he got home. As they\nreached the door, they saw a scuffle going on upon the sidewalk. A\nwell-dressed man was being beaten and kicked by a few rough fellows,\nand the crowd was looking on with silent interest. Farnham sprang\nforward and seized one of the assailants by the collar; Bolty pulled\naway another. The man who had been cuffed turned to Kendall, who was\nstanding by to help where help was needed, and cried, \"Take me away\nsomewhere; they will have my life;\" an appeal which only excited the\njeers of the crowd.\n\n\"Kendall, take him into my office,\" said Farnham, which was done in an\ninstant, Farnham and Bolty following. A rush was made,--not very\nvicious, however,--and the three men got safely inside with their\nprize, and bolted the door. A few kicks and blows shook the door, but\nthere was no movement to break it down; and the rescued man, when he\nfound himself in safety, walked up to a mirror there was in the room\nand looked earnestly at his face. It was a little bruised and bloody,\nand dirty with mud, but not seriously injured.\n\nHe turned to his rescuers with an air more of condescension than\ngratitude. \"Gentlemen, I owe you my thanks, although I should have got\nthe better of those scoundrels in a moment. Can you assist me in\nidentifying them?\"\n\n\"Oh! it is Mayor Quinlin, I believe,\" said Farnham, recognizing that\nfunctionary more by his voice than by his rumpled visage. \"No, I do not\nknow who they were. What was the occasion of this assault?\"\n\n\"A most cowardly and infamous outrage, sir,\" said the Mayor. \"I was\nwalking along the sidewalk to me home, and I came upon this gang of\nruffians at your door. Impatient at being delayed,--for my time is much\noccupied,--I rebuked them for being in me way. One of them turned to me\nand insolently inquired, 'Do you own this street, or have you just got\na lien on it?' which unendurable insult was greeted with a loud laugh\nfrom the other ruffians. I called them by some properly severe name,\nand raised me cane to force a passage,--and the rest you know. Now,\ngentlemen, is there anything I can do?\"\n\nFarnham did not scruple to strike while the iron was hot. He said:\n\"Yes, there is one thing your Honor may do, not so much for us as for\nthe cause of order and good government, violated to-night in your own\nperson. Knowing the insufficiency of the means at your disposal, a few\nof us propose to raise a subsidiary night-patrol for the protection of\nlife and property during the present excitement. We would like you to\ngive it your official sanction.\"\n\n\"Do I understand it will be without expense to my--to the city\ngovernment?\" Mr. Quinlin was anxious to make a show of economy in his\nannual message.\n\n\"Entirely,\" Farnham assured him.\n\n\"It is done, sir. Come to-morrow morning and get what papers you want.\nThe sperrit of disorder must be met and put down with a bold and\ndefiant hand. Now, gentlemen, if there is a back door to this\nestablishment, I will use it to make me way home.\"\n\nFarnham showed him the rear entrance, and saw him walking homeward up\nthe quiet street; and, coming back, found Bolty and Kendall writhing\nwith merriment.\n\n\"Well, that beats all,\" said Kendall. \"I guess I'll write home like the\nfellow did from Iowa to his daddy, 'Come out here quick. Mighty mean\nmen gits office in this country.'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Bolty. \"Dot burgermeister ish better as a circus mit a\ndrick mule.\"\n\n\"Don't speak disrespectfully of dignitaries,\" said Farnham. \"It's a bad\nhabit in soldiers.\"\n\nWhen they went out on the sidewalk the crowd had dispersed. Farnham\nbade his recruits good night and went up the avenue. They waited until\nhe was a hundred yards away, and then, without a word to each other,\nfollowed him at that distance till they saw him enter his own gate.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nA BUSY SUNDAY FOR THE MATCHINS.\n\n\nMatters were not going on pleasantly in the Matchin cottage. Maud's\nsuccess in gaining an eligible position, as it was regarded among her\nfriends, made her at once an object of greater interest than ever; but\nher temper had not improved with her circumstances, and she showed\nherself no more accessible than before. Her father, who naturally felt\na certain satisfaction at having, as he thought, established her so\nwell, regarded himself as justified in talking to her firmly and\nseriously respecting her future. He went about it in the only way he\nknew. \"Mattie,\" he said one evening, when they happened to be alone\ntogether, \"when are you and Sam going to make a match?\"\n\nShe lifted her eyes to him, and shot out a look of anger and contempt\nfrom under her long lashes that made her father feel very small and old\nand shabby.\n\n\"Never!\" she said, quietly.\n\n\"Come, come, now,\" said the old man; \"just listen to reason. Sam is a\ngood boy, and with what he makes and what you make----\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it. I won't discuss the matter any\nfurther. We have had it all out before. If it is ever mentioned again,\nSam or I will leave this house.\"\n\n\"Hoity-toity, Missy! is that the way you take good advice----\" but she\nwas gone before he could say another word. Saul walked up and down the\nroom a few moments, taking very short steps, and solacing his mind by\nmuttering to himself: \"Well, that's what I get by having a scholar in\nthe family. Learning goes to the head and the heels--makes 'em proud\nand skittish.\"\n\nHe punctually communicated his failure to Sam, who received the news\nwith a sullen quietness that perplexed still more the puzzled\ncarpenter.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon, a few days later, he received a visit from Mr.\nBott, whom he welcomed, with great deference and some awe, as an\nambassador from a ghostly world of unknown dignity. They talked in a\nstiff and embarrassed way for some time about the weather, the prospect\nof a rise in wages, and other such matters, neither obviously taking\nany interest in what was being said. Suddenly Bott drew nearer and\nlowered his voice, though the two were alone in the shop.\n\n\"Mr. Matchin,\" he said, with an uneasy grin, \"I have come to see you\nabout your daughter.\"\n\nMatchin looked at him with a quick suspicion.\n\n\"Well, who's got anything to say against my daughter?\"\n\n\"Oh, nobody that I know of,\" said Bott, growing suspicious in his turn.\n\"Has anything ever been said against her?\"\n\n\"Not as I know,\" said Saul. \"Well, what _have_ you got to say?\"\n\n\"I wanted to ask how you would like me as a son-in-law?\" said Bott,\nwishing to bring matters to a decision.\n\nSaul stood for a moment without words in his astonishment. He had\nalways regarded Bott as \"a professional character,\" even as a \"litrary\nman\"; he had never hoped for so lofty an alliance. And yet he could not\nsay that he wholly liked it. This was a strange creature--highly\ngifted, doubtless, but hardly comfortable. He was too \"thick\" with\nghosts. One scarcely knew whether he spent most of his time \"on earth\nor in hell,\" as Saul crudely phrased it. The faint smell of phosphorus\nthat he carried about with him, which was only due to his imperfect\nablutions after his seances, impressed Saul's imagination as going to\nshow that Bott was a little too intimate with the under-ground powers.\nHe stood chewing a shaving and weighing the matter in his mind a moment\nbefore he answered. He thought to himself, \"After all, he is making a\nliving. I have seen as much as five dollars at one of his seeunses.\"\nBut the only reply he was able to make to Bott's point-blank question\nwas:\n\n\"Well, I dunno.\"\n\nThe words were hardly encouraging, but the tone was weakly compliant.\nBott felt that his cause was gained, and thought he might chaffer a\nlittle.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"I would like to have a few things understood, to\nstart with. I am very particular in business matters.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Saul, who began to think that this was a very\nsystematic and methodical man.\n\n\"I am able to support a wife, or I would not ask for one,\" said Bott.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Saul, with effusion; \"that's just what I was saying to\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Oh, you was!\" said Bott, scowling and hesitating. \"You was, was you?\"\nThen, after a moment's pause, in which he eyed Saul attentively, he\ncontinued, \"Well--that's so. At the same time, I am a business man, and\nI want to know what you can do for your girl.\"\n\n\"Not much of anything, Mr. Bott, if you must know. Mattie is makin' her\nown living.\"\n\n\"Yes. That's all right. Does she pay you for her board?\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Bott, that ain't none of your business yet, anyhow. She\ndon't pay no board while she stays here; but that ain't nobody's\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Oh, no offence, sir, none in the world. Only I am a business man, and\ndon't want misunderstandings. So she don't. And I suppose you don't\nwant to part with your last child--now, do you? It's like breaking your\nheart-strings, now, ain't it?\" he said, in his most sentimental lecture\nvoice.\n\n\"Well, no, I can't say it is. Mattie's welcome in my house while I\nlive, but of course she'll leave me some day, and I'll wish her joy.\"\n\n\"Why should that be? My dear sir, why should that be?\" Bott's voice\ngrew greasy with sweetness and persuasion. \"Why not all live together?\nI will be to you as a son. Maud will soothe your declining years. Let\nit be as it is, Father Saul.\"\n\nThe old carpenter looked up with a keen twinkle of his eye.\n\n\"You and your wife would like to board with us when you are married?\nWell, mebbe we can arrange that.\"\n\nThis was not quite what Bott expected, but he thought best to say no\nmore on that subject for the moment.\n\nSaul then asked the question that had all along been hovering on his\nlips.\n\n\"Have you spoke to Mattie yet?\"\n\nThe seer blushed and simpered, \"I thought it my duty to speak first to\nyou; but I do not doubt her heart.\"\n\n\"Oh! you don't,\" said Saul, with a world of meaning. \"You better find\nout. You'll find her in the house.\"\n\nBott went to the house, leaving Saul pondering. Girls were queer\ncattle. Had Mattie given her word to this slab-sided, lanky fellow? Had\nshe given Sam Sleeny the mitten for him? Perhaps she wanted the glory\nof being Mrs. Professor Bott. Well, she could do as she liked; but Saul\nswore softly to himself, \"If Bott comes to live offen me, he's got to\npay his board.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the seer was walking, not without some inward perturbation,\nto the house, where his fate awaited him. It would have been hard to\nfind a man more confident and more fatuous; but even such fools as he\nhave their moments of doubt and faltering when they approach the not\naltogether known. He had not entertained the slightest question of\nMaud's devotion to him, the night she asked from him the counsel of the\nspirits. But he had seen her several times since that, and she had\nnever renewed the subject. He was in two minds about it. Sometimes he\nimagined she might have changed her purpose; and then he would comfort\nhimself with the more natural supposition that maiden modesty had been\ntoo much for her, and that she was anxiously awaiting his proffer. He\nhad at last girded up his loins like a man and determined to know his\ndoom. He had first ascertained the amount of Maud's salary at the\nlibrary, and then, as we see, had endeavored to provide for his\nsubsistence at Saul's expense; and now nothing was wanting but the\nmaiden's consent. He trembled a little, but it was more with hope than\nfear. He could not make himself believe that there was any danger--but\nhe wished it were over and all were well. He paused as he drew near the\ndoor. He was conscious that his hands were disagreeably cold and moist.\nHe took out his handkerchief and wiped them, rubbing them briskly\ntogether, though the day was clear and warm, and the perspiration stood\nbeaded on his forehead. But there was no escape. He knocked at the\ndoor, which was opened by Maud in person, who greeted him with a free\nand open kindness that restored his confidence. They sat down together,\nand Maud chatted gayly and pleasantly about the weather and the news. A\nNew York girl, the daughter of a wealthy furrier, was reported in the\nnewspaper as about to marry the third son of an English earl. Maud\ndiscussed the advantages of the match on either side as if she had been\nthe friend from childhood of both parties.\n\nSuddenly, while she was talking about the forthcoming wedding, the\nthought occurred to Bott, \"Mebbe this is a hint for me,\" and he plunged\ninto his avowal. Turning hot and cold at once, and wringing his moist\nhands as he spoke, he said, taking everything for granted:\n\n\"Miss Maud, I have seen your father and he gives his consent, and you\nhave only to say the word to make us both happy.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nAnger, surprise, and contempt were all in the one word and in the\nflashing eyes of the young woman, as she leaned back in her\nrocking-chair and transfixed her unhappy suitor.\n\n\"Why, don't you understand me? I mean----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I see what you mean. But I _don't_ mean; and if you had come\nto me, I'd have saved you the trouble of going to my father.\"\n\n\"Now, look here,\" he pleaded, \"you ain't a-going to take it that way,\nare you? Of course, I'd have come to you first if I had 'a' thought\nyou'd preferred it. All I wanted was----\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Maud, with perfect coolness and malice,--for in the last\nmoment she had begun heartily to hate Bott for his presumption,--\"I\nunderstand what _you_ want. But the question is what _I_ want--and I\ndon't want you.\"\n\nThe words, and still more the cold monotonous tone in which they were\nuttered, stung the dull blood of the conjurer to anger. His mud-colored\nface became slowly mottled with red.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, \"what did you mean by coming and consulting the\nsperrits, saying you was in love with a gentleman------\"\n\nMaud flushed crimson at the memory awakened by these words. Springing\nfrom her chair, she opened the door for Bott, and said, \"Great\ngoodness! the impudence of some men! You thought I meant _you?_\"\n\nBott went out of the door like a whipped hound, with pale face and\nhanging head. As he passed by the door of the shop, Saul hailed him and\nsaid with a smile, \"What luck?\"\n\nBott did not turn his head, he growled out a deep imprecation and\nwalked away. Matchin was hardly surprised. He mused to himself, \"I\nthought it was funny that Mattie should sack Sam Sleeny for that\nfellow. I guess he didn't ask the sperrits how the land lay,\" chuckling\nover the discomfiture of the seer. Spiritualism is the most convenient\nreligion in the world. You may disbelieve two-thirds of it and yet be\nperfectly orthodox. Matchin, though a pillar of the faith, always\nkeenly enjoyed the defeat and rout of a medium by his tricksy and\nrebellious ghosts.\n\nHe was still laughing to himself over the retreat of Bott, thinking\nwith some paternal fatuity of the attractiveness and spirit of his\ndaughter, when a shadow fell across him, and he saw Offitt standing\nbefore him.\n\n\"Why, Offitt. is that you? I did not hear you. You always come up as\nsoft as a spook!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's me. Where's Sam?\"\n\n\"Sam's gone to Shady Creek on an excursion with his lodge. My wife went\nwith him.\"\n\n\"I wanted to see him. I think a heap of Sam.\"\n\n\"So do I. Sam is a good fellow.\"\n\n\"Excuse my making so free, Mr. Matchin, but I once thought Sam was\ngoing to be a son-in-law of yours.\"\n\n\"Well, betwixt us, Mr. Offitt, I hoped so myself. But you know what\ngirls is. She jest wouldn't.\"\n\n\"So it's all done, is it? No chance for Sam?\" Offitt asked eagerly.\n\n\"Not as much as you could hold sawdust in your eye,\" the carpenter\nanswered.\n\n\"Well, now, Mr. Matchin, I have got something to say.\" (\"Oh, Lordy,\"\ngroaned Saul to himself, \"here's another one.\") \"I wouldn't take no\nadvantage of a friend; but if Sam's got no chance, as you say, why\nshouldn't I try? With your permission, sir, I will.\"\n\n\"Now look ye here, Mr. Offitt. I don't know as I have got anything\nagainst you, but I don't know nothing _fur_ you. If it's a fair\nquestion, how do you make your livin'?\"\n\n\"That's all right. First place, I have got a good trade. I'm a\nlocksmith.\"\n\n\"So I have heard you say. But you don't work at it.\"\n\n\"No,\" Offitt answered; and then, assuming a confidential air, he\ncontinued, \"As I am to be one of the family, I'll tell you. I don't\nwork at my trade, because I have got a better thing. I am a Reformer.\"\n\n\"You don't say!\" exclaimed Saul. \"I never heard o' your lecturin'.\"\n\n\"I don't lecture. I am secretary of a grand section of Labor Reformers,\nand I git a good salary for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Saul, not having the least idea of what it all meant.\nBut, like most fathers of his kind, he made no objection to the man's\nproposal, and told him his daughter was in the house. As Offitt walked\naway on the same quest where Bott had so recently come to wreck, Saul\nsat smiling, and nursing his senile vanity with the thought that there\nwere not many mechanics' daughters in Buffland that could get two\noffers in one Sunday from \"professional men.\" He sat with the contented\ninertness of old men on his well-worn bench, waiting to see what would\nbe the result of the interview.\n\n\"I don't believe she'll have him,\" he thought. \"He ain't half the man\nthat Sam is, nor half the scholar that Bott is.\"\n\nIt was well he was not of an impatient temperament. He sat quietly\nthere for more than an hour, as still as a knot on a branch, wondering\nwhy it took Offitt so much longer than Bott to get an answer to a plain\nquestion; but it never once occurred to him that he had a right to go\ninto his own house and participate in what conversation was going on.\nTo American fathers of his class, the parlor is sacred when the\ndaughter has company.\n\nThere were several reasons why Offitt stayed longer than Bott.\n\nThe seer had left Maud Matchin in a state of high excitement and anger.\nThe admiration of a man so splay and ungainly was in itself insulting,\nwhen it became so enterprising as to propose marriage. She felt as if\nshe had suffered the physical contact of something not clean or\nwholesome. Besides, she had been greatly stirred by his reference to\nher request for ghostly counsel, which had resulted in so frightful a\nfailure and mortification. After Bott had gone, she could not dismiss\nthe subject from her mind. She said to herself, \"How can I live, hating\na man as I hate that Captain Farnham? How can I breathe the same air\nwith him, blushing like a peony whenever I think of him, and turning\npale with shame when I hear his name? That ever I should have been\nrefused by a living man! What _does_ a man want,\" she asked, with her\nhead thrown back and her nostrils dilated, \"when he don't want me?\"\n\nAs she was walking to and fro, she glanced out of the window and saw\nOffitt approaching from the direction of the shop. She knew instantly\nwhat his errand would be, though he had never before said a word to her\nout of the common. \"I wonder if father has sent him to me--and how many\nmore has he got in reserve there in the shop? Well, I will make short\nwork of this one.\"\n\nBut when he had come in and taken his seat, she found it was not so\neasy to make short work of him.\n\nDealing with this one was very different from dealing with the other--\nabout the difference between handling a pig and a panther. Offitt was a\nhuman beast of prey--furtive, sly, and elusive, with all his faculties\nconstantly in hand. The sight of Maud excited him like the sight of\nprey. His small eyes fastened upon her; his sinewy hands tingled to lay\nhold of her. But he talked, as any casual visitor might, of immaterial\nthings.\n\nMaud, while she chatted with him, was preparing herself for the\ninevitable question and answer. \"What shall I say to him? I do not like\nhim. I never did. I never can. But what shall I do? A woman is of no\nuse in the world by herself. He is not such a dunce as poor Sam, and is\nnot such a gawk as Bott. I wonder whether he would make me mind? I am\nafraid he would, and I don't know whether I would like it or not. I\nsuppose if I married him I would be as poor as a crow all my days. I\ncouldn't stand that. I won't have him. I wish he would make his little\nspeech and go.\"\n\nBut he seemed in no hurry to go. He was talking volubly about himself,\nlying with the marvellous fluency which interest and practice give to\nsuch men, and Maud presently found herself listening intently to his\nstories. He had been in Mexico, it seemed. He owned a silver mine\nthere. He got a million dollars out of it, but took it into his head\none day to overturn the Government, and was captured and his money\ntaken; barely escaped the garrote by strangling his jailer; owned the\nmine still, and should go back and get it some day, when he had\naccomplished certain purposes in this country. There were plenty of\npeople who wished he was gone now. The President had sent for him to\ncome, to Washington; he went, and was asked to breakfast; nobody there\nbut them two; they ate off gold plates like he used to in Mexico; the\nPresident then offered him a hundred thousand to leave, was afraid he\nwould make trouble; told the President to make it a million and then he\nwouldn't. His grandfather was one of the richest men in Europe; his\nfather ran away with his mother out of a palace. \"You must have heard\nof my father, General Offitt, of Georgy? No? He was the biggest\nslaveholder in the State. I have got a claim against the Government,\nnow, that's good for a million if it's worth a cent; going to\nWashington next winter to prosecute it.\"\n\nMaud was now saying to herself, \"Why, if half this is true, he is a\nremarkable man,\" like many other credulous people, not reflecting that,\nwhen half a man says is false, the other half is apt to be also. She\nbegan to think it would be worth her while, a red feather in her cap,\nto refuse such a picturesque person; and then it occurred to her that\nhe had not proposed to marry her, and possibly had no such intention.\nAs his stream of talk, dwelling on his own acts of valor and craft, ran\non, she began to feel slightly piqued at its lack of reference to\nherself. Was this to be a mere afternoon call after all, with no combat\nand no victory? She felt drawn after awhile to bring her small\nresources of coquetry into play. She interrupted him with saucy doubts\nand questions; she cast at him smiles and glances, looking up that he\nmight admire her eyes, and down that her lashes might have their due\neffect.\n\nHe interpreted all these signs in a favorable sense, but still\nprudently refrained from committing himself, until directly challenged\nby the blush and simper with which she said:\n\n\"I suppose you must have seen a great many pretty ladies in Mexico?\"\n\nHe waited a moment, looking at her steadily until her eyelids trembled\nand fell, and then he said, seriously and gravely:\n\n\"I used to think so; but I never saw there or anywhere else as pretty a\nlady as I see at this minute.\"\n\nThis was the first time in her life that Maud had heard such words from\na man. Sam Sleeny, with all his dumb worship, had never found words to\ntell her she was beautiful, and Bott was too grossly selfish and dull\nto have thought of it. Poor Sleeny, who would have given his life for\nher, had not wit enough to pay her a compliment. Offitt, whose love was\nas little generous as the hunger of a tiger, who wished only to get her\ninto his power, who cared not in the least by what means he should\naccomplish this, who was perfectly willing to have her find out all his\nfalsehoods the day after her wedding, relying upon his brute strength\nto retain her then,--this conscienceless knave made more progress by\nthese words than Sam by months of the truest devotion. Yet the\nimpression he made was not altogether pleasant. Thirsting for\nadmiration as she did, there was in her mind an indistinct conscious\nness that the man was taking a liberty; and in the sudden rush of color\nto her cheek and brow at Offitt's words, there was at first almost as\nmuch anger as pleasure. But she had neither the dignity nor the\ntraining required for the occasion, and all the reply she found was:\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Offitt, how can you say so?\"\n\n\"I say so,\" he answered, with the same unsmiling gravity, \"because it's\nthe fact. I have been all over the world. I have seen thousands of\nbeautiful ladies, even queens and markisses, and I never yet saw and I\nnever expect to see such beauty as yours, Miss Maud Matchin, of\nBuffland.\"\n\nShe still found no means to silence him or defend herself. She said,\nwith an uneasy laugh, \"I am sure I don't see where the wonderful beauty\nis.\"\n\n\"That's because your modesty holds over your beauty. But I see where it\nis. It's in your eyes, that's like two stars of the night; in your\nforehead, that looks full of intellect and sense; in your rosy cheeks\nand smiling lips; in your pretty little hands and feet----\" Here she\nsuddenly rolled up her hands in her frilled white apron, and, sitting\nup straight, drew her feet under her gown. At this performance, they\nboth laughed loud and long, and Maud's nerves were relieved.\n\n\"What geese we are,\" she said at last. \"You know I don't believe a word\nyou say.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do. You've got eyes and a looking-glass. Come now, be\nhonest. You know you never saw a girl as pretty as yourself, and you\nnever saw a man that didn't love you on sight.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that.\"\n\n\"Don't all the men you know love you?\"\n\n\"There is one man I know hates me, and I hate him.\"\n\n\"Who is it? This is very interesting.\"\n\nMaud was suddenly seized with a desire to tell an adventure, something\nthat might match Offitt's tales of wonder.\n\n\"You'll never tell?\"\n\n\"Hope I may die.\"\n\n\"It's Arthur Farnham!\" She had succeeded in her purpose, for Offitt\nstared at her with looks of amazement. \"He once wanted to be rather too\nattentive to me, and I did not like it. So he hates me, and has tried\nto injure me.\"\n\n\"And you don't like him very well?\"\n\n\"I don't. I would owe a good deal to the man who would give him a\nbeating.\"\n\n\"All right. You give me--what?--a kiss, or a lock of your hair, and he\nshall have his thrashing.\"\n\n\"You do it and bring me the proofs, and we will talk about it.\"\n\n\"Well, I must be off,\" he said, picking tip his hat. He saw on her face\na slight disappointment. He put out his hand to take leave. She folded\nher arms.\n\n\"You needn't be in such a hurry,\" she said, poutingly. \"Mother won't be\nback for ever so long, and I was half asleep over my book when you came\nin.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said. \"That suits me.\" He walked deliberately\nacross the room, picked up a chair, and seated himself very near to\nMaud. She felt her heart beat with something like terror, and regretted\nasking him to stay. He had been very agreeable, but she was sure he was\ngoing to be disagreeable now. She was afraid that if he grew\ndisagreeable she could not manage him as she could the others. Her\nworst fears were realized with his first words.\n\n\"Miss Matchin, if you ask me to stay longer, you must take the\nconsequences. I am going to say to you what I never said to mortal\nwoman before: I love you, and I want you for my wife.\"\n\nShe tried to laugh. \"Oh, you do?\" but her face grew pale, and her hands\ntrembled.\n\n\"Yes, I do; and I am going to have you, too.\"\n\nHe tried to speak lightly, but his voice broke in spite of him.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" she replied, recovering herself with an effort. \"Perhaps\n_I'll_ have something to say about that, Mr. Confidence.\"\n\n\"Of course; excuse me for talking like a fool. Only have me, and you\nshall have everything else. All that wealth can buy shall be yours.\nWe'll leave this dull place and go around the world seeking pleasure\nwhere it can be found, and everybody will envy me my beauteous bride.\"\n\n\"That's very pretty talk, Mr. Offitt; but where is all this wealth to\ncome from?\"\n\nHe did not resent the question, but heard it gladly, as imposing a\ncondition he might meet. \"The money is all right. If I lay the money at\nyour feet, will you go with me? Only give me your promise.\"\n\n\"I promise nothing,\" said Maud; \"but when you are ready to travel,\nperhaps you may find me in a better humor.\"\n\nThe words seemed to fire him. \"That's promise enough for me,\" he cried,\nand put out his arms toward her. She struck down his hands, and\nprotested with sudden, cattish energy:\n\n\"Let me alone. Don't you come so near me. I don't like it. Now you can\ngo,\" she added. \"I have got a lot to think about.\"\n\nHe thought he would not spoil his success by staying. \"Good-by, then,\"\nhe said, kissing his fingers to her. \"Good-by for a little while, my\nown precious.\"\n\nHe turned at the door. \"This is between us, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, what there is of it,\" she said, with a smile that took all sting\nfrom the words.\n\nHe walked to the shop, and wrung the old man's hand. His look of\nexultation caused Saul to say, \"All settled, eh?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Offit; \"but I have hopes. And now, Mr. Matchin, you know\nyoung ladies and the ways of the world. I ask you, as a gentleman, not\nto say nothing about this, for the present, to nobody.\"\n\nSaul, proud of his secret, readily promised.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nCAPTAIN FARNHAM SEES ACTIVE SERVICE AGAIN.\n\n\nFarnham lost no time in calling upon the Mayor to fulfil his\nengagement. He found his Honor a little subdued by the news of the\nmorning. None of the strikers of the day before had gone back to work,\nand considerable accessions were reported from other trades. The worst\nsymptoms seemed to be that many shops were striking without orders. The\ncessation of work was already greater than seemed at first contemplated\nby the leading agitators themselves. They seemed to be losing their own\ncontrol of the workingmen, and a few tonguey vagrants and convicts from\nthe city and from neighboring towns, who had come to the surface from\nnobody knew where, were beginning to exercise a wholly unexpected\nauthority. They were going from place to place, haranguing the workmen,\npreaching what they called socialism, but what was merely riot and\nplunder. They were listened to without much response. In some places\nthe men stopped work; in others they drove out the agitators; in others\nthey would listen awhile, and then shout, \"Give us a rest!\" or \"Hire a\nhall!\" or \"Wipe off your chir!\" But all the while the crowds gradually\nincreased in the streets and public places; the strike, if it promised\nnothing worse, was taking the dimensions of a great, sad, anxious\nholiday. There was not the slightest intention on the part of the\nauthorities to interfere with it, and to do them justice, it is hard to\nsee what they could have done, with the means at their disposal. The\nMayor, therefore, welcomed Farnham with great cordiality, made him a\ncaptain of police, for special duty, on the spot, and enrolled his list\nof recruits of the night before as members of the police force of the\ncity, expressly providing that their employment should cost the city\nnothing, now or hereafter.\n\nFarnham again made his rounds of the city, but found nothing especially\nnoteworthy or threatening. The wide town, in spite of the large crowds\nin the streets, had a deserted look. A good many places of business\nwere closed. There was little traffic of vehicles. The whistle of the\nlocomotives and the rush of trains--sounds which had grown so familiar\nin that great railroad centre that the ear ceased to be affected by\nthem--being suddenly shut off, the silence which came in their place\nwas startling to the sense. The voices of the striking employees, who\nretained possession of the Union Passenger Depot, resounded strangely\nthrough the vast building, which was usually a babel of shrill and\nstrident sounds.\n\nOn the whole, the feature which most struck him in this violent and\nunnatural state of things was the singular good-nature of almost all\nclasses. The mass of the workingmen made no threats; the greater number\nof employers made no recriminations. All hoped for an arrangement,\nthough no one could say how it was to come. The day passed away in\nfruitless parleys, and at night the fever naturally rose, as is the way\nof fevers.\n\nWhen nightfall came, the crowd had become so great, in the public\nsquare that Farnham thought it might be better not to march his\nimprovised policemen in a body up-town. He therefore dispatched orders\nto Kendall to send them up with their arms, singly or by twos and\nthrees, to his house. By eight o'clock they were all there, and he\npassed an hour or so in putting them through a rude form of drill and\ngiving them the instructions which he had prepared during the day. His\nintention was to keep them together on his own place during the early\npart of the night, and if, toward midnight, all seemed quiet, to\nscatter them as a patrol about the neighborhood; in case of serious\ndisturbance anywhere else, to be ready to take part in restoring order.\n\nAbout nine o'clock a man was seen coming rapidly from the house to the\nrear garden, where Farnham and his company were. The men were dispersed\nabout the place; some on the garden seats, some lying on the grass in\nthe clear moonlight. Farnham was a little apart, talking with Kendall\nand Grosshammer. He started up to meet the intruder; it was Mr. Temple.\n\n\"What's all this?\" said Temple.\n\n\"The manly art of self-defence,\" said Farnham, smiling.\n\n\"I see, and I am glad to see it, too,\" answered Temple, warmly. \"One of\nmy men told me an hour ago that in the Tramps' Lodging House, last\nnight, it was the common talk that there would be a rush on the houses\nin this region to-night. I went to the Mayor and tried to see him, but\nhe was hiding, I think. I went to the Chief of Police, and he was in a\nblue funk. So I thought I would come up myself and see you. I knew you\ncould raise a few men among your servants over here, and I would bring\nhalf a dozen, and we could answer for a few tramps, anyhow. But you are\nall right, and there is nothing to do but wait for them.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you!\" said Farnham, \"though I am a thousand times obliged\nto you for your good-will. I won't forget it in a hurry, old man. Are\nyou going home now? I will walk a block or two with you.\"\n\n\"No, I am not going home--not by\"--[we draw the veil over Temple's\nlanguage at this point]. \"I have come to spend the evening. Have you\nany tools for me?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear fellow! there is not the least use of it. There is\nnot one chance in a million that there will be anything to do.\"\n\nThe two men were walking toward the house. Temple said: \"Don't be too\nsure of it. As I passed by the corner of the Square ten minutes ago,\nthere was a fellow in front of Mouchem's gin-mill, a longhaired,\nsallow-looking pill, who was making as ugly a speech to a crowd of\nruffians as I ever heard. One phrase was something like this: 'Yes, my\nfellow-toilers'--he looked like he had never worked a muscle in his\nlife except his jaw-tackle,--'the time has come. The hour is at hand.\nThe people rule. Tyranny is down. Enter in and take possession of the\nspoilers' gains. Algonquin Avenue is heaped with riches wrung from the\nsweat of the poor. Clean out the abodes of blood guiltiness.' And you\nought to have heard the ki-yi's that followed. That encouraged him, and\nhe went on: 'Algonquin Avenue is a robbers' cave, It's very handsome,\nbut it needs one thing more.' 'What's that?' some fellows yelled. 'An\naristocrat hung to every lamppost.' This was very popular too, you can\nbet your boots. On that I toddled off, so as to get you a chance to say\nyour peccavy, anyhow.\"\n\nWalking and talking together, they had passed the house and come to the\ngate opening on the Avenue.\n\n\"You might shut these wide gates,\" said Temple.\n\n\"I do not think they have been shut in ten years,\" Farnham answered.\n\"Let's try it.\"\n\nThe effort was unsuccessful. The heavy gates would not budge. Suddenly\na straggling, irregular cheer was heard from the direction of the\nSquare. \"There!\" said Temple, \"my friend the orator has got off another\ngood thing.\"\n\nBut Farnham, who had stepped outside at the sound and gazed on the\nmoon-lighted avenue, said, \"There they come now!\"\n\nThey both ran back to the house, Farnham blowing his watchman's\nwhistle. \"See here,\" said Temple, \"I must have some tools. You have a\nclub and revolver. Give me the club,\" which he took without more\nceremony. The men came up from the garden in an instant, and quickly\nfell in at Farnham's word of command. Masked by the shadows of the\ntrees and the shrubbery, they were not discernible from the street.\n\n\"Remember,\" said Farnham. \"Use your clubs as much as you see fit, if\nyou come to close quarters; but do not fire without orders, unless to\nsave your own lives. I don't think it is likely that these fellows are\narmed.\"\n\nThe clattering of feet grew louder on the sidewalk, and in a moment the\nleaders of the gang--it could hardly be called a mob--stopped by the\ngates. \"Here's the place. Come along boys!\" one of them shouted, but no\none stirred until the whole party came up. They formed a dense crowd\nabout the gates and half-filled the wide avenue. There was evidently a\nmoment of hesitation, and then three or four rushed through the gate,\nfollowed by a larger number, and at last by the bulk of the crowd. They\nhad come so near the porch that it could now be seen by the light of\nthe moon that few of them carried arms. Some had sticks; one or two men\ncarried heavy stones in their hands; one young man brandished an axe;\none had a hammer. There was evidently no attempt at organization\nwhatever.\n\nFarnham waited until they were only a few feet away, and then shouted:\n\n\"Forward! Guide right! Double time! March!\"\n\nThe men darted out from the shadow and began to lay about them with\ntheir clubs. A yell of dismay burst from the crowd. Those in front\nturned and met those behind, and the whole mass began striking out\nwildly at each other. Yelling and cursing, they were forced back over\nthe lawn to the gate. Farnham, seeing that no shots had been fired, was\nconfirmed in his belief that the rioters were without organization and,\nto a great extent, without arms. He therefore ordered his men to the\nright about and brought them back to the house. This movement evidently\nencouraged the mob. Loud voices were distinctly heard.\n\n\"Who's afraid of half a dozen cops?\" said a burly ruffian, who carried\na slunfg-shot. \"There's enough of us to eat 'em up.\"\n\n\"That's the talk, Bowersox,\" said another. \"You go in and get the first\nbite.\"\n\n\"That's my style,\" said Bowersox. \"Come along, Offitt. Where's Bott? I\nguess he don't feel very well. Come along, boys! We'll slug 'em this\ntime!\" And the crowd, inspirited by this exhortation and the apparent\nweakness of the police force, made a second rush for the house.\n\nTemple was standing next to Farnham. \"Arthur,\" he whispered, \"let's\nchange weapons a moment,\" handing Farnham his club and taking the\nrevolver from his hand. Farnham hardly noticed the exchange, so\nintently was he watching the advance of the crowd, which he saw, in a\nmoment, was far more serious than the first. They were coming up more\nsolidly, and the advantage of the surprise was now gone. He waited,\nhowever, until they were almost as near as they had been before, and\nthen gave the order to charge, in the same words as before, but in a\nmuch sharper and louder tone, which rang out like a sudden blast from a\ntrumpet.\n\nThe improvised policemen darted forward and attacked as vigorously as\never, but the assailants stood their ground. There were blows given as\nwell as taken this time. There was even a moment's confusion on the\nextreme right of the line, where the great bulk of Bowersox bore down\none of the veterans. Farnham sprang forward and struck the burly\nruffian with his club; but his foot slipped on the grass, and he\ndropped on one knee. Bowersox raised his slung-shot; a single report of\na pistol rang out, and he tumbled forward over Farnham, who sprang to\nhis feet and shouted, \"Now, men, drive 'em!\" Taking the right himself\nand profiting by the momentary shock of the shot, they got the crowd\nstarted again, and by vigorous clubbing drove them once more into the\nstreet.\n\n\nReturning to the shadow by the house, Farnham's first question was, \"Is\nanybody hurt?\"\n\n\"I've got a little bark knocked off,\" said one quiet fellow, who came\nforward showing a ghastly face bathed in blood from a wound in his\nforehead. Farnham looked at him a moment, and then, running to his\ndoor, opened it and called Budsey, who had been hiding in the cellar,\npraying to all his saints.\n\n\"Here, Budsey, take this man down to the coachman's house, and then go\nround the corner and bring Dr. Cutts. If he isn't there, get somebody\nelse. It does not amount to much, but there will be less scar if it is\nattended to at once.\"\n\nThe man was starting away with Budsey, when Temple said, \"Look here!\nYou won't need that arsenal any more to-night. Pass it over,\" and took\nthe man's belt, with club and pistol, and buckled them around his own\nslim waist. Handing Farnham his own pistol, he said: \"Thanks, Arthur. I\nowe you one cartridge.\"\n\n\"And I owe you, God knows how much!\"\n\nFarnham then briefly announced to his men that the shot which had just\nbeen fired was not by a member of the company, and was, therefore, not\na disobedience of orders. Catching sight of Bowersox lying motionless\non the grass, he ordered,\n\n\"Two file-closers from the right, go and bring in that man!\"\n\nBut at that moment Bowersox moved, sat up and looked about him, and,\nsuddenly remembering where he was, struggled to his feet and half-ran,\nhalf staggered to his friends in the street. They gathered about him\nfor a moment, and then two of them were seen supporting him on his way\ninto the town.\n\nFarnham was standing behind his men, and a little apart. He was\nthinking whether it might not be best to take them at once into the\nstreet and disperse the crowd, when he felt a touch at his elbow. He\nturned, and saw his gardener, Ferguson.\n\n\"If I might speak a word, sir!\"\n\n\"Certainly--what is it? But be quick about it.\"\n\n\"I think all is not right at the Widow Belding's. I was over there but\nnow, and a dozen men--I did not count them,--but--\"\n\n\"Heavens! why did I not think of that? Kendall, you take command of\nthese men for a moment. Bolty, you and the three files on the left come\nwith me. Come, Temple,--the back way.\" And he started at a pace so\nrapid that the others could hardly keep him in sight.\n\nAfter the first repulse of the crowd, Offitt, Bott, and a few more of\nthe Bread-winners, together with some of the tramps and jail-birds who\nhad come for plunder, gathered together across the street and agreed\nupon a diversion. It was evident, they said, that Farnham had a\nconsiderable police force with him to protect his property; it was\nuseless to waste any more time there; let the rest stay there and\noccupy the police; they could have more fun and more profit in some of\nthe good houses in the neighborhood. \"Yes,\" one suggested, \"Jairus\nBelding's widder lives just a step off. Lots o' silver and things. Less\ngo there.\"\n\nThey slipped away in the confusion of the second rush, and made their\nway through the garden to Mrs. Belding's. They tried the door, and,\nfinding it locked, they tore off the shutters and broke the windows,\nand made their way into the drawing-room, where Mrs. Belding and Alice\nwere sitting.\n\nThey had been alarmed by the noise and tumult in front of Farnham's\nhouse, and had locked and bolted their own doors in consequence.\nPassing through the kitchen in their rounds, they found Ferguson there\nin conversation with the cook. \"Why, Fergus!\" said the widow: \"why are\nyou not at home? They are having lively times over there, are they\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the gardener; \"but they have a plenty of men with arms, and\nI thought I'd e'en step over here and hearten up Bessie a bit.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she ought to be very much obliged,\" responded Mrs. Belding,\ndryly, though, to speak the truth, she was not displeased to have a man\nin the house, however little she might esteem his valor.\n\n\"I have no doubt he sneaked away from the fuss,\" she said to Alice;\n\"but I would rather have him in the kitchen than nothing.\"\n\nAlice assented. \"That is what they mean by moral support, I suppose.\"\n\nShe spoke with a smile, but her heart was ill at ease. The man she\nloved was, for all she knew, in deadly danger, and she could not show\nthat she cared at all for him, for fear of showing that she cared too\nmuch.\n\n\"I am really anxious about Arthur Farnham,\" continued Mrs. Belding. \"I\nhope he will not get himself into any scrape with those men.\"\n\nThe tumult on the street and on the lawn had as yet presented itself to\nher in no worse light than as a labor demonstration, involving cheers\nand rude language. \"I am afraid he won't be polite enough to them. He\nmight make them a little speech, complimenting Ireland and the American\nflag, and then they would go away. That's what your father did, in that\nstrike on the Wabash. It was in the papers at the time. But these\nsoldiers--I'm afraid Arthur mayn't be practical enough.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, we are not responsible for him,\" said Alice, whose heart\nwas beating violently.\n\n\"Why, Alice! what a heartless remark!\"\n\nAt this instant the windows came crashing in, and a half-dozen ruffians\nburst into the room. Alice sprang, pale and silent, to the side of her\nmother, who sat, paralyzed with fright, in her rocking-chair.\n\nA man came forward from the group of assailants. His soft hat was drawn\ndown over his eyes, and a red handkerchief concealed the lower part of\nhis face. His voice was that of Offitt, as he said, \"Ladies, we don't\nwant to do no violence; but, in the name of the Revolutionary\nCommittee, we have called to collect an assessment on you.\" This\nmachinery was an invention of the moment, and was received with great\nsatisfaction by the Bread-winners.\n\n\"That's what's the matter,\" they said, in chorus. \"Your assessment, and\nbe lively about it. All you've got handy.\"\n\n\"I have no money in the house,\" Mrs. Belding cried. \"What shall I do?\"\n\n\"You forget, mamma,\" said Alice. \"There is some upstairs. If these\ngentlemen will wait here a moment, I will go and get it.\"\n\nOffitt looked at her sharply. \"Well, run and get it. Bott, you go with\nher.\"\n\nBott turned angrily upon his chief. \"What's the use of calling names?\nWhat if I said your name was----\"\n\n\"There, there, don't keep the lady waiting.\"\n\nAlice turned from the room, closely followed by Bott. Reaching the\nstairs, she swept up the long flight with the swift grace of a swallow.\nBott hurried after her as fast as he could; but she gained her bedroom\ndoor enough in advance to shut and lock it between them, leaving him\nkicking and swearing in the hall. She ran to her open window, which\nlooked toward Farnham's, and sent the voice of her love and her trouble\ntogether into the clear night in one loud cry, \"Arthur!\"\n\nShe blushed crimson as the word involuntarily broke from her lips, and\ncried again as loudly as she could, \"Help!\"\n\n\"I hope he did not hear me at first,\" she said, covering her face with\nher hands, and again she cried, \"Help!\"\n\n\"Shut up that noise,\" said Bott, who was kicking violently at the door,\nbut could not break it down. \"Shut up, or I'll wring your neck.\"\n\nShe stopped, not on account of his threats, which suddenly ceased, but\nbecause she heard the noise of footsteps on the porch, and of a short\nbut violent scuffle, which showed that aid of some sort had arrived. In\na few moments she heard Bott run away from her door. He started toward\nthe stairs, but finding his retreat cut off ran to the front window,\nclosely pursued. She heard a scramble. Then a voice which made her\nheart beat tumultuously said. \"Look out below there.\"\n\nA moment after, the same voice said, \"Have you got him?\" and then, \"All\nright! keep him.\"\n\nA light knock on her door followed, and Farnham said, \"Miss Belding.\"\n\nAlice stood by the door a moment before she could open it. Her heart\nwas still thumping, her voice failed her, she turned white and red in a\nmoment. The strongest emotion of which she was conscious was the hope\nthat Arthur had not heard her call him by his name.\n\nShe opened the door with a gravity which was almost ludicrous. Her\nfirst words were wholly so.\n\n\"Good-evening, Captain Farnham,\" was all she could find to say. Then,\nstriving desperately to add something more gracious, she stammered,\n\"Mamma will be very----\"\n\n\"Glad to see me in the drawing room?\" Farnham laughed. \"I have no doubt\nof it. She is quite safe there; and your visitors have gone. Will you\njoin her now?\"\n\nShe could not help perceiving the slight touch of sarcasm in his tone.\nShe saw he was hurt by her coldness and shyness, and that made her\nstill more cold and shy. Without another word she walked before him to\nthe drawing-room, where Mrs. Belding still sat in her rocking-chair,\nmoaning and wringing her hands. Mr. Temple was standing beside her\ntrying to soothe her, telling her it was all over. Bolty was tying the\narms of one of the ruffians behind him, who lay on the floor on his\nface. There was no one else in the room.\n\nAlice knelt on the floor by her mother and took her in her arms. \"You\nare not hurt, are you, mamma dear?\" she said, in a soft, tender tone,\nas if she were caressing a crying child.\n\n\"Oh, no! I suppose not,\" said the widow; \"but I am not used to such\ndoings at this time of night, and I don't like them. Captain Farnham,\nhow shall I ever thank you? and you, Mr. Temple? Goodness knows what we\nshould have done without you. Alice, the moment you left the room, some\nof them ran to the sideboard for the silver, another one proposed to\nset the house afire, and that vile creature with the red handkerchief\nasked me for my ear-rings and my brooch. I was trying to be as long as\nI could about getting them off, when these gentlemen came in. I tell\nyou they looked like angels, and I'll tell your wife so when I see her,\nMr. Temple; and as for Arthur----\"\n\nAt this moment Bolty, having finished the last knot to his\nsatisfaction, rose and touched his prisoner with his foot. \"Captain,\"\nhe said, saluting Farnham, \"vot I shall do mit dis schnide?\"\n\n\"They have got the one I dropped from the window?\"\n\n\"Jawohl! on de gravel-walk draussen!\"\n\n\"Very well. Take them both to the stable behind my house for the\npresent, and make them fast together. Then come back here and stand\nguard awhile with the men on the porch, till I relieve you.\"\n\n\"All right. Git up mid yourself,\" he said, touching his prostrate foe\nnot so gently, \"and vorwaerts.\"\n\nAs they went out, Farnham turned to Mrs. Belding, and said, \"I think\nyou will have no more trouble. The men I leave as a guard will be quite\nsufficient, I have no doubt. I must hurry back and dismiss the friends\nwho have been serenading me.\"\n\nShe gazed at him, not quite comprehending, and then said, \"Well, if you\nmust go, good-night, and thank you a thousand times. When I have my\nwits about me I will thank you better.\"\n\nArthur answered laughingly as he shook hands. \"Oh, that is of no\nconsequence. It was merely neighborly. You would have done as much for\nme, I am sure.\" And the gentlemen took their leave.\n\nWhen the ladies were alone, Mrs. Belding resumed her story of the great\ntransaction. \"Why, it will be something to tell about as long as I\nlive,\" she said. \"You had hardly got upstairs when I heard a noise of\nfighting outside on the walk and the porch. Then Arthur and Mr. Temple\ncame through that window as if they were shot out of a cannon. The\nthief who stood by me, the red handkerchief one, did not stop, but\nburst through the hall into the kitchen and escaped the back way. Then\nMr. Temple took another one and positively threw him through the\nwindow, while Arthur, with that policeman's club, knocked the one down\nwhom you saw the German tying up. It was all done in an instant, and I\njust sat and screamed for my share of the work. Then Arthur came and\ncaught me by the shoulder, and almost shook me, and said, 'Where is\nAlice?' Upon my word, I had almost forgotten you. I said you were\nupstairs, and one of those wretches was there too. He looked as black\nas a fury, and went up in about three steps. I always thought he had\nsuch a sweet temper, but to-night he seemed just to _love_ to fight.\nNow I think of it, Alice, you hardly spoke to him. You must not let him\nthink we are ungrateful. You must write him a nice note to-morrow.\"\n\nAlice laid her head upon her mother's shoulder, where her wet eyes\ncould not be seen. \"Mamma,\" she asked, \"did he say 'Where is Alice?'\nDid he say nothing but 'Alice'?\"\n\n\"Now, don't be silly,\" said Mrs. Belding. \"Of course he said 'Alice.'\nYou wouldn't expect a man to be Miss Beldinging you at such a time. You\nare quite too particular.\"\n\n\"He called me Miss Belding when he came upstairs,\" said Alice, still\nhiding her face.\n\n\"And what did you say to him--for saving this house and all our lives?\"\n\nThe girl's overwrought nerves gave way. She had only breath enough to\nsay, \"I said 'Good evening, Captain Farnham!' Wasn't it too perfectly\nridiculous?\" and then burst into a flood of mingled laughter and tears,\nwhich nothing could check, until she had cried herself quiet upon her\nmother's bosom.\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nTHE WHIP OF THE SCYTHIANS.\n\n\nFarnham and Temple walked hastily back to where they had left Kendall\nwith the rest of the company. They found him standing like a statute\njust where he had been placed by Farnham. The men were ranged in the\nshadow of the shrubbery and the ivy-clad angle of the house. The moon\nshone full on the open stretch of lawn, and outside the gates a black\nmass on the sidewalk and the street showed that the mob had not left\nthe place. But it seemed sluggish and silent.\n\n\"Have they done anything new?\" asked Farnham.\n\n\"Nothin', but fire a shot or two--went agin the wall overhead; and once\nthey heaved a lot of rocks, but it was too fur--didn't git more'n half\nway. That's all.\"\n\n\"We don't want to stand here looking at each other all night,\" said\nFarnham.\n\n\"Let's go out and tell them it's bed-time,\" suggested Temple.\n\n\"Agreed!\" said Farnham. He turned to his men, and in a voice at first\nso low that it could not have been heard ten feet away, yet so clear\nthat every syllable was caught by his soldiers, he gave the words of\ncommand.\n\n\"Company, attention! Eight, forward. Fours right. Double time. March!\"\n\nThe last words rang out clear and loud, and startled the sullen crowd\nin the street. There was a hurried, irresolute movement among them,\nwhich increased as the compact little corps dashed out of the shadow\ninto the clear moonlight, and rushed with the rapid but measured pace\nof veterans across the lawn. A few missiles were thrown, without\neffect. One or two shots were heard, followed by a yell in the street--\nwhich showed that some rioter in his excitement had wounded one of his\nown comrades. Farnham and his little band took only a moment to reach\nthe gate, and the crowd recoiled as they burst through into the street.\nAt the first onslaught the rioters ran in both directions, leaving the\nstreet clear immediately in front of the gates.\n\nThe instant his company reached the middle of the avenue, Arthur,\nseeing that the greater number of the divided mob had gone to the left,\nshouted:\n\n\"Fours left. March--guide right.\"\n\nThe little phalanx wheeled instantly and made rapid play with their\nclubs, but only for a moment. The crowd began to feel the mysterious\npower which discipline backed by law always exerts, and they ran at\nfull speed up the street to the corner and there dispersed. The\nformation of the veterans was not even broken. They turned at Farnham's\norder, faced to the rear, and advanced in double time upon the smaller\ncrowd which still lingered a little way beyond the gate.\n\nIn this last group there was but one man who stood his ground and\nstruck out for himself. It was a tall young fellow with fair hair and\nbeard, armed with a carpenter's hammer, with which he maintained so\nformidable an attitude that, although two or three policemen were\nopposed to him, they were wary about closing in upon him. Farnham,\nseeing that this was all there was left of the fight, ordered the men\nto fall back, and, approaching the recalcitrant, said sharply:\n\n\"Drop that hammer, and surrender! We are officers of the law, and if\nyou resist any longer you'll be hurt.\"\n\n\"I don't mind that. I was waiting for _you_,\" the man said, and made a\nquick and savage rush and blow at Farnham. In all his campaigns, he had\nnever before had so much use for his careful broadsword training as\nnow. With his policeman's club against the workman's hammer, he\ndefended himself with such address, that in a few seconds, before his\nmen could interfere, his adversary was disarmed and stretched on the\nsidewalk by a blow over the head. He struggled to rise, but was seized\nby two men and held fast.\n\n\"Don't hit him,\" said Farnham. \"I think I have seen this man\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Kendall, \"that's Sam Sleeny, a carpenter in Dean Street. He\norter be in better business.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" said Farnham; \"he is a Reformer. Put him with the\nothers.\"\n\nAs they were tying his hands, Sam turned to Farnham and said, in a\nmanner which was made dignified by its slow, energetic malice, \"You've\nbeat me to-night, but I will get even with you yet--as sure as there's\na God.\"\n\n\"That's reasonably sure,\" said Farnham; \"but in the meanwhile, we'll\nput you where you can cool off a little.\"\n\nThe street was now cleared; the last fugitives were out of sight.\nFarnham returned to his garden, and then divided his men into squads\nfor patrolling the neighborhood. They waited for half an hour, and,\nfinding all was still quiet, then made arrangements for passing the\nnight. Farnham made Temple go into the house with him, and asked Budsey\nto bring some sherry. \"It is not so good as your Santa Rita,\" he said;\n\"but the exercise in the night air will give it a relish.\"\n\nWhen the wine came, the men filled and drank, in sober American\nfashion, without words; but in the heart of each there was the thought\nof eternal friendship, founded upon brave and loyal service.\n\n\"Budsey,\" said Farnham, \"give all the men a glass of this wine.\"\n\n\"Not this, sir?\" said Budsey, aghast.\n\n\"I said this,\" replied Farnham. \"Perhaps they won't enjoy it, but I\nshall enjoy giving it to them.\"\n\nFarnham and Temple were eating some bread and cheese and talking over\nthe evening, when Budsey came back with something which approached a\nsmile upon his grave countenance.\n\n\"Did they like it?\" asked Farnham.\n\n\"Half of 'em said they was temperance and wouldn't 'ave any. Some of\nthe rest said--you will excuse me, sir--as it was d---- poor cider,\"\nand Budsey went out of the room with a suspicious convulsion of the\nback.\n\n\"I'll go on that,\" said Mr. Temple. \"Goodnight. I think we will have\ngood news in the morning. There will be an attack made on those men at\nRiverley to-morrow which will melt them like an iceberg in Tartarus.\"\nMr. Temple was not classical, and, of course, did not say Tartarus.\n\nFarnham was left alone. The reaction from the excitement of the last\nfew hours was settling upon him. The glow of the fight and his success\nin it were dying away. Midnight was near, and a deep silence was\nfalling upon the city. There was no sound of bells, of steam-whistles,\nor of rushing trains. The breeze could be heard in the quiet, stirring\nthe young, soft leaves. Farnham felt sore, beaten, discomfited. He\nsmiled a little bitterly to himself when he considered that the cause\nof his feeling of discouragement was that Alice Belding had spoken to\nhim with coldness and shyness when she opened her door. He could not\nhelp saying to himself, \"I deserved a kinder greeting than she gave me.\nShe evidently wished me to understand that I am not to be permitted any\nfurther intimacy. I have forfeited that by presuming to love her. But\nhow lovely she is! When she took her mother in her arms, I thought of\nall the Greek heroines I ever read about. Still, 'if she be not fair\nfor me'--if I am not to be either lover or friend--this is no place for\nme.\"\n\nThe clock on the mantel struck midnight. \"A strange night,\" he mused.\n\"There is one sweet and one bitter thing about it. I have done her a\nservice, and she did not care.\"\n\nHe went to the door to speak to Kendall. \"I think our work is over for\nto-night. Have our prisoners taken down to the Refrigerator and turned\nover to the ordinary police. I will make charges to-morrow. Then divide\nthe men into watches and make yourself as comfortable as you can. If\nanything happens, call me. If nothing happens, good-night.\"\n\nHe returned to his library, turned down the gas, threw himself on the\nsofa, and was soon asleep; even before Alice, who sat, unhappy, as\nyouth is unhappy, by an open window, her eyes full of tears, her heart\nfull of remorse. \"It is too wretched to think of,\" she bemoaned\nherself. \"He is the only man in the world I could ever care for, and I\nhave driven him away. It never can be made right again; I am punished\njustly. If I thought he would take me, I believe I could go this minute\nand throw myself at his feet. But he would smile, and raise me up, and\nmake some pretty speech, very gentle, and very dreadful, and bring me\nback to mamma, and then I should die.\"\n\nBut at nineteen well-nourished maidens do not pass the night in\nmourning, however heavy their hearts may be, and Alice slept at last,\nand perhaps was happier in her innocent dreams.\n\nThe night passed without further incident, and the next day, though it\nmay have shown favorable signs to practised eyes, seemed very much, to\nthe public, like the day which had preceded it. There were fewer shops\nclosed in the back streets; there were not so many parties of wandering\napostles of plunder going about to warn laborers away from their work.\nBut in the principal avenues and in the public squares there were the\nsame dense crowds of idlers, some listless and some excited, ready to\nbelieve the wildest rumors and to applaud the craziest oratory.\nSpeakers were not lacking; besides the agitators of the town, several\nhad come in from neighboring places, and they were preaching, with\nfervor and perspiration, from street corners and from barrel-heads in\nthe beer-houses, the dignity of manhood and the overthrow of tyrants.\n\nBott, who had quite distinguished himself during the last few days, was\nnot to be seen. He had passed the night in the station-house, and, on\nbrief examination before a police-justice at an early hour of the\nmorning, on complaint of Farnham and Temple, had been, together with\nthe man captured in Mrs. Belding's drawing-room, bound over to stand\nhis trial for house-breaking at the next term of court. He displayed\nthe most abject terror before his trial, and would have made a full\nconfession of the whole affair had Offitt not had the address to convey\nto him the assurance that, if he stood firm, the Brotherhood of\nBread-winners would attend to his case and be responsible for his safety.\nRelying upon this, he plucked up his spirits and bore himself with\ncharacteristic impudence in the presence of the police-justice,\ninsisting upon being called Professor Bott, giving his profession as\ninspirational orator, his religion the divinity of humanity. When bound\nover for trial, he rose and gained a round of applause from the idlers\nin the court-room by shouting, \"I appeal from this outrage to the power\nof the people and the judgment of history.\"\n\nThis was his last recorded oration; for we may as well say at once\nthat, a month later, he stood his trial without help from any\nBrotherhood, and passed away from public life, though not entirely from\npublic employment, as he is now usefully and unobtrusively engaged in\nmaking shoes in the State penitentiary--and is said \"to take serious\nviews of life.\"\n\nThe cases of Sleeny and the men who were taken in the street by\nFarnham's policemen were also disposed of summarily through his\nintervention. He could not help liking the fair-bearded carpenter,\nalthough he had been caught in such bad company, and so charged him\nmerely with riotous conduct in the public streets, for which the\npenalty was a light fine and a few days' detention. Sleeny seemed\nconscious of his clemency, but gave him no look or expression of\ngratitude. He was too bitter at heart to feel gratitude, and too\nawkward to feign it.\n\nAbout noon, a piece of news arrived which produced a distinct\nimpression of discouragement among the strikers. It was announced in\nthe public square that the railway blockade was broken in Clairfield, a\ncity to the east of Buffland about a hundred miles. The hands had\naccepted the terms of the employers and had gone to work again. An\norator tried to break the force of this announcement by depreciating\nthe pluck of the Clairfield men. \"Why, gentlemen!\" he screamed, \"a\nten-year-old boy in this town has got twice the sand of a Clairfield\nman. They just leg the bosses to kick 'em. When they are fired out of\na shop door, they sneak down the chimbley and whine to be took on\nagain. We ain't made of that kind of stuff.\"\n\nBut this haughty style of eloquence did not avail to inspirit the\ncrowd, especially as the orator was just then interrupted to allow\nanother dispatch to be read, which said that the citizens of a town to\nthe south had risen in mass and taken the station there from the hands\nof the strikers. This news produced a feeling of isolation and\ndiscouragement which grew to positive panic, an hour later, on the\nreport that a brigade of regular troops was on its way to Buffland to\nrestore order. The report was of course unfounded, as a brigade of\nregular troops could not be got together in this country in much less\ntime than it would take to build a city; but even the name of the\nphantom army had its effect, and the crowds began to disperse from that\ntime. The final blow was struck, however, later in the day.\n\nFarnham learned it from Mr. Temple, at whose counting-room he had\ncalled, as usual, for news. Mr. Temple greeted him with a volley of\nexulting oaths.\n\n\"It's all up. You know what I told you last night about the attack that\nwas preparing on Riverley. I went out there myself, this forenoon. I\nknew some of the strikers, and I thought I would see if\nthe -- -- -- -- would let me send my horse Blue Ruin through to\nRochester to-morrow. He is entered for the races there, you know, and I\ndidn't want, by -- -- -- --, to miss my engagements, understand? Well,\nas I drove out there, after I got about half way, it began to occur to\nme that I never saw so many women since the Lord made me. The road was\nfull of them in carts, buggies, horseback, and afoot. I thought a\ncommittee of 'em was going; but I suppose they couldn't trust a\ncommittee, and so they all went. There were so many of 'em I couldn't\ndrive fast, and so I got there about the same time the head of the\ncolumn began to arrive. You never saw anything like it in your life.\nThe strikers had been living out there in a good deal of style--with\nsentries and republican government and all that. By the great\nhokey-pokey! they couldn't keep it up a minute when their wives came.\nThey knew 'em too well. They just bulged in without rhyme or rule.\nEvery woman went for her husband and told him to pack up and go home.\nSome of 'em--the artful kind--begged and wheedled and cried; said they\nwere so tired--wanted their sweethearts again. But the bigger part\ntalked hard sense,--told 'em their lazy picnic had lasted long enough,\nthat there was no meat in the house, and that they had got to come home\nand go to work. The siege didn't last half an hour. The men brazened it\nout awhile; some were rough; told their wives to dry up, and one big\nfellow slapped his wife for crying. By jingo! it wasn't half a flash\nbefore another fellow slapped _him_, and there they had it, rolling\nover and over on the grass, till the others pulled them apart by the\nlegs. It was a gone case from the start. They held a meeting off-hand;\nthe women stayed by to watch proceedings, and, not to make a long story\nabout it, when I started back a delegation of the strikers came with me\nto see the president of the roads, and trains will run through to-night\nas usual. I am devilish glad of it, for my part. There is nothing in\nRochester of any force but Rosin-the-Bow, and my horse can show him the\nway around the track as if he was getting a dollar an hour as a guide.\"\n\n\"That _is_ good news certainly. Is it generally known in the city?\"\n\n\"I think not. It was too late for the afternoon papers. I told Jimmy\nNelson, and he tore down to the depot to save what is left of his\nfruit. He swore so about it that I was quite shocked.\"\n\n\"What about the mill hands?\" asked Farnham.\n\n\"The whole thing will now collapse at once. We shall receive the\nproposition of the men who left us to-morrow, and re-engage on our own\nterms, next day, as many as we want. We shan't be hard on them. But one\nor two gifted orators will have to take the road. They are fit for\nnothing but Congress, and they can't all go from this district. If I\nwere you, Arthur, by the way, I wouldn't muster out that army of yours\ntill to-morrow. But I don't think there will be any more calls in your\nneighborhood. You are too inhospitable to visitors.\"\n\nThe sun was almost setting as Farnham walked through the public square\non his way home. He could hardly believe so sudden a change could have\nfallen upon the busy scene of a few hours before. The square was almost\ndeserted. Its holiday appearance was gone. A few men occupied the\nbenches. One or two groups stood beneath the trees and conversed in\nunder-tones. The orators had sought their hiding-places,\nunnecessarily--too fearful of the vengeance which never, in this happy\ncountry, attends the exercise of unbridled \"slack jaw.\" As Arthur\nwalked over the asphalt pavement there was nothing to remind him of\nthe great crowds of the last few days but the shells of the pea-nuts\ncrunching under his feet. It seems as if the American workman can\nnever properly invoke the spirit of liberty without a pocketful of\nthis democratic nut.\n\nAs he drew near his house, Farnham caught a glimpse of light drapery\nupon Mrs. Belding's piazza, and went over to relieve her from anxiety\nby telling her the news of the day. When he had got half way across the\nlawn, he saw Alice rise from beside her mother as if to go. Mrs.\nBelding signed for her to resume her seat. Farnham felt a slight\nsensation of anger. \"It is unworthy of her,\" he thought, \"to avoid me\nin that manner. I must let her see she is in no danger from me.\"\n\nHe gave his hand cordially to Mrs. Belding and bowed to Alice without a\nword. He then briefly recounted the news to the elder lady, and assured\nher that there was no probability of any farther disturbance of the\npeace.\n\n\"But we shall have our policemen here all the same to-night, so that\nyou may sleep with a double sense of security.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are very good,\" she said. \"I don't know what we should\nhave done without you last night, _and_ Mr. Temple. When it comes to\near-rings, there's no telling what they wouldn't have done.\"\n\n\"Two of your guests are in jail, with good prospects of their remaining\nthere. The others, I learn, were thieves from out of town; I doubt if\nwe shall capture them.\"\n\n\"For goodness' sake, let them run. I never want to see them again. That\nugly creature who went up with Alice for the money--you caught him? I\nam so glad. The impudence of the creature! going upstairs with my\ndaughter, as if she was not to be trusted. Well,\" she added candidly,\n\"she wasn't that time, but it was none of _his_ business.\"\n\nHere Alice and Farnham both laughed out, and the sound of the other's\nvoice was very pleasant to each of them, though they did not look\ntoward each other.\n\n\"I am beginning to think that the world is growing too wicked for\nsingle women,\" Mrs. Belding continued, philosophically. \"Men can take\ncare of themselves in so many ways. They can use a club as you do----\"\n\n\"Daily and habitually,\" assented Arthur.\n\n\"Or they can make a speech about Ireland and the old flag, as Mr.\nBelding used to; or they can swear like Mr. Temple. By the way, Alice,\nyou were not here when Mr. Temple swore so at those thieves. I was\nscandalized, but I had to admit it was very appropriate.\"\n\n\"I was also away from the room,\" said Farnham; \"but I can readily\nbelieve the comminatory clauses must have been very cogent.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! and such a nice woman _she_ is.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Temple is charming,\" said Farnham, rising.\n\n\"Arthur, do not go! Stay to dinner. It will be ready in one moment. It\nwill strengthen our nerves to have a man dine with us, especially a\nliberating hero like you. Why, you seemed to me last night like Perseus\nin the picture, coming to rescue What's-her-name from the rock.\"\n\nFarnham glanced at Alice. Her eyes were fixed upon the ground; her\nfingers were tightly clasped. She was wishing with all her energy that\nhe would stay, waiting to catch his first word of assent, but unable to\nutter a syllable.\n\n\"Alice,\" said Mrs. Belding rather sharply, \"I think Arthur does not\nregard my invitation as quite sufficient. Will you give it your\napproval?\"\n\nAlice raised her face at these words and looked up at Farnham. It was a\nbeautiful face at all times, and now it was rosy with confusion, and\nthe eyes were timid but kind. She said with lips that trembled a\nlittle: \"I should be very glad to have Captain Farnham stay to dinner.\"\n\nShe had waited too long, and the words were a little too formal, and\nArthur excused himself on the plea of having to look out for his\ncohort, and went home to a lonely dinner.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nOFFITT DIGS A PIT.\n\n\nA week had passed by; the great strike was already almost forgotten. A\nfew poor workmen had lost their places. A few agitators had been\ndismissed for excellent reasons, having no relation with the strike.\nThe mayor had recovered from his panic, and was beginning to work for a\nrenomination, on the strength of his masterly dealing with the labor\ndifficulties, in which, as he handsomely said in a circular composed by\nhimself and signed by his friends, he \"nobly accomplished the duty\nallotted him of preserving the rights of property while respecting the\nrights of the people, of keeping the peace according to his oath, and\nkeeping faith with the masses, to which he belonged, in their struggle\nagainst monopoly.\"\n\nThe rich and prosperous people, as their manner is, congratulated\nthemselves on their escape, and gave no thought to the questions which\nhad come so near to an issue of fire and blood. In this city of two\nhundred thousand people, two or three dozen politicians continued as\nbefore to govern it, to assess and to spend its taxes, to use it as\ntheir property and their chattel. The rich and intelligent kept on\nmaking money, building fine houses, and bringing up children to hate\npolitics as they did, and in fine to fatten themselves as sheep which\nshould be mutton whenever the butcher was ready. There was hardly a\nmillionaire on Algonquin Avenue who knew where the ward meetings of his\nparty were held. There was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew\nhis way to his ward club as well as to mass.\n\nAmong those who had taken part in the late exciting events and had now\nreverted to private life was Sam Sleeny. His short sentence had\nexpired; he had paid his fine and come back to Matchin's. But he was\nnot the quiet, contented workman he had been. He was sour, sullen, and\ndiscontented. He nourished a dull grudge against the world. He had\ntried to renew friendly relations with Maud, but she had repulsed him\nwith positive scorn. Her mind was full of her new prospects, and she\ndid not care to waste time with him. The scene in the rose-house\nrankled in his heart; he could not but think that her mind had been\npoisoned by Farnham, and his hate gained intensity every hour.\n\nIn this frame of mind he fell easily into the control of Offitt. That\nworthy had not come under the notice of the law for the part he took in\nthe attack on the Belding house; he had not been recognized by\nFarnham's men, nor denounced by his associates; and so, after a day or\ntwo of prudential hiding, he came to the surface again. He met Sam at\nthe very door of the House of Correction, sympathized with him,\nflattered him, gained his full confidence at last, and held him ready\nfor some purpose which was vague even in his own brain. He was\ndetermined to gain possession of Maud, and he felt it must be through\nsome crime, the manner of which was not quite clear to him. If he could\nuse Sam to accomplish his purpose and save his own skin, that would be\nbest. His mind ran constantly upon theft, forgery, burglary, and\nmurder; but he could frame no scheme which did not involve risks that\nturned him sick. If he could hit upon something where he might furnish\nthe brains, and Sam the physical force and the risk! He dwelt upon this\nday and night. He urged Sam to talk of his own troubles; of the\nMatchins; at last, of Maud and his love, and it was not long before the\ntortured fellow had told him what he saw in the rose-house. Strangely\nenough, the thought of his fiancee leaning on the shoulder of another\nman did not in the least diminish the ardor of Offitt. His passion was\nentirely free from respect or good-will. He used the story to whet the\nedge of Sam's hatred against Farnham.\n\n\"Why, Sam, my boy,\" he would say, \"your honor is at stake.\"\n\n\"I would as soon kill him as eat,\" Sam answered. \"But what good would\nthat do me? She cares no more for me than she does for you.\"\n\nOffitt was sitting alone in his room one afternoon; his eyes were\nstaring blankly at the opposite wall; his clinched hands were cold as\nice. He had been sitting in that way motionless for an hour, a prey to\na terrible excitement.\n\nIt had come about in this way. He had met in one of the shops he\nfrequented a machinist who rented one of Farnham's houses. Offitt had\nasked him at noon-time to come out and drink a glass of beer with him.\nThe man complied, and was especially careful to bring his waistcoat\nwith him, saying with a laugh, \"I lose my shelter if I lose that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Offitt.\n\n\"I've got a quarter's rent in there for Cap. Farnham.\"\n\n\"Why are you carrying it around all day?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, Farnham is a good sort of fellow, and to keep us from\nlosing time he lets us come to his house in the evening, after working\nhours, on quarter-day, instead of going to his office in the day-time.\nYou see, I trot up there after supper and get rid of this wad.\"\n\nOffitt's eyes twinkled like those of an adder.\n\n\"How many of you do this?\"\n\n\"Oh, a good many,--most everybody in our ward and some in the\nNineteenth.\"\n\n\"A good bit of money?\" said Offitt carelessly, though his mouth worked\nnervously.\n\n\"You bet your boots! If I had all the cash he takes in to-night, I'd\nbuy an island and shoot the machine business. Well, I must be gettin'\nback. So long.\"\n\nOffitt had walked directly home after this conversation, looking\nneither to the right nor the left, like a man asleep. He had gone to\nhis room, locked his door behind him, and sat down upon the edge of his\nbed and given himself up to an eager dream of crime. His heart beat,\nnow fast, now slow; a cold sweat enveloped him; he felt from time to\ntime half suffocated.\n\nSuddenly he heard a loud knocking at his door--not as if made by the\nhand, but as if some one were hammering. He started and gasped with a\nchoking rattle in his throat. His eyes seemed straining from their\nsockets. He opened his lips, but no sound came forth.\n\nThe sharp rapping was repeated, once and again. He made no answer. Then\na loud voice said:\n\n\"Hello, Andy, you asleep?\"\n\nHe threw himself back on his pillow and said yawningly, \"Yes. That you,\nSam? Why don't you come in?\"\n\n\"'Cause the door's locked.\"\n\nHe rose and let Sleeny in; then threw himself back on the bed,\nstretching and gaping.\n\n\"What did you make that infernal racket with?\"\n\n\"My new hammer,\" said Sam. \"I just bought it to day. Lost my old one\nthe night we give Farnham the shiveree.\"\n\n\"Lemme see it.\" Offitt took it in his hand and balanced and tested it.\n\"Pretty good hammer. Handle's a leetle thick, but--pretty good hammer.\"\n\n\"Ought to be,\" said Sam. \"Paid enough for it.\"\n\n\"Where d'you get it?\"\n\n\"Ware & Harden's.\"\n\n\"Sam,\" said Offitt,--he was still holding the hammer and giving himself\nlight taps on the head with it,--\"Sam.\"\n\n\"Well, you said that before.\"\n\nOffitt opened his mouth twice to speak and shut it again.\n\n\"What are you doin'?\" asked Sleeny. \"Trying to catch flies?\"\n\n\"Sam,\" said Offitt at last, slowly and with effort, \"if I was you, the\nfirst thing I did with that hammer, I'd crack Art Farnham's cocoa-nut.\"\n\n\"Well, Andy, go and crack it yourself if you are so keen to have it\ndone. You're mixing yourself rather too much in my affairs, anyhow,\"\nsaid Sam, who was nettled by these too frequent suggestions of Offitt\nthat his honor required repair.\n\n\"Sam Sleeny,\" said Offitt, in an impressive voice, \"I'm one of the kind\nthat stands by my friends. If you mean what you have been saying to me,\nI'll go up with you this very night, and we will together take it out\nof that aristocrat. Now, that's business.\"\n\nSleeny looked at his friend in surprise and with some distrust. The\noffer was so generous and reckless, that he could not help asking\nhimself what was its motive. He looked so long and so stupidly at\nOffitt, that the latter at last divined his feeling. He thought that,\nwithout telling Sleeny the whole scheme, he would test him one step\nfarther.\n\n\"I don't doubt,\" he said carelessly, \"but what we could pay ourselves\nwell for the job,--spoil the 'Gyptians, you know,--forage on the enemy.\nPlenty of portables in them houses, eh!\"\n\n\"I never said\"--Sam spoke slowly and deliberately--\"I wanted to\n'sassinate him, or rob him, or burgle him. If I could catch him and\nlick him, in a fair fight, I'd do it; and I wouldn't care how hard I\nhit him, or what with.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Offitt, curtly. \"You met him once in a fair fight,\nand he licked you. And you tried him another way,--courtin' the same\ngirl,--and he beat you there. But it's all right. I've got nothin'\nagainst him, if you hain't. Lemme mark your name on this hammer,\" and,\nturning the conversation so quickly that Sleeny had no opportunity to\nresent the last taunt, he took his knife and began dexterously and\nswiftly to cut Sam's initials in the handle of his hammer. Before,\nhowever, he had half completed his self-imposed task, he exclaimed,\n\"This is dry work. Let's go out and get some beer. I'll finish your\nhammer and bring it around after supper.\"\n\n\"There's one S on it,\" said Sam; \"that's enough.\"\n\n\"One S enough! It might mean Smith, or Schneider, or Sullivan. No, sir.\nI'll put two on in the highest style of art, and then everybody will\nknow and respect Sam Sleeny's tool.\"\n\nThey passed out of the room together, and drank their beer at a\nneighboring garden. They were both rather silent and preoccupied. As\nthey parted, Offitt said, \"I've got a scheme on hand for raising the\nwind, I want to talk to you about. Be at my room to-night between nine\nand ten, and wait till I come, if I am out. Don't fail.\" Sam stared a\nlittle, but promised, asking no questions.\n\nWhen Offitt came back, he locked the door again behind him. He bustled\nabout the room as if preparing to move. He had little to pack; a few\nshabby clothes were thrown into a small trunk, a pile of letters and\npapers were hastily torn up and pitched into the untidy grate. All this\nwhile he muttered to himself as if to keep himself in company. He said:\n\"I had to take the other shoot--he hadn't the sand to help--I couldn't\ntell him any more. . . . I wonder if she will go with me when I come\ntonight--ready? I shall feel I deserve her anyhow. She don't treat me\nas she did him, according to Sam's story. She makes me keep my\ndistance. She hasn't even shook hands with me since we was engaged.\nI'll pay her for that after awhile.\" He walked up and down his room\nbreathing quick and hard. \"I shall risk my neck, I know; but it won't\nbe the first time, and I never will have such a reason again. She beats\nanything I ever saw. I've _got_ to have the money--to suit such a\nwoman. . . . I'm almost sorry for Sam--but the Lord made some men to be\nother men's fools. . . .\"\n\nThis was the staple of his musings; other things less edifying still\nmay be omitted.\n\nWhile he was engaged in this manner he heard a timid knock at his door.\n\"Another visitor? I'm getting popular,\" he said, and went to open the\ndoor.\n\nA seedy, forlorn-looking man came in; he took off his shabby hat and\nheld it under his arm.\n\nHe said, \"Good-evenin',\" in a tone a little above a whisper.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter?\" asked Offitt.\n\n\"Have you heered about Brother Bowersox?\"\n\n\"Never mind the brothering--that's played out. What is there about\nBowersox?\"\n\n\"He's dangerous; they don't think he'll live through the night.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n\nThis was not encouraging, but the poor Bread-winner ventured to say, \"I\nthought some of the Brothers----\"\n\nBut Offitt closed the subject by a brutal laugh. \"The Brothers are\nlooking out for themselves these times. The less said about the\nBrotherhood the better. It's up the spout, do you hear?\"\n\nThe poor fellow shrunk away into his ragged clothes, and went out with\na submissive \"Good-evenin'.\"\n\n\"I'll never found another Brotherhood,\" Offitt said to himself. \"It's\nmore trouble than it brings in.\"\n\nIt was now growing dark. He took his hat and went down the stairs and\nout into the street. He entered a restaurant and ordered a beefsteak,\nwhich he ate, paid for, and departed after a short chat with the\nwaiter, whom he knew. He went around the corner, entered another\neating-house, called for a cup of coffee and a roll. There also he was\ncareful to speak with the man who served him, slapping him on the\nshoulder with familiarity. He went into a drug store a little later and\nbought a glass of soda-water, dropping the glass on the marble floor,\nand paying for it after some controversy. He then walked up to Dean\nStreet. He found the family all together in the sitting-room. He\nchatted awhile with them, and asked for Sleeny.\n\n\"I don't really know where Sam is. He ain't so reg'lar in his hours as\nhe used to be,\" said Saul. \"I hope he ain't gettin' wild.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Offitt, in a tone of real distress--then, after a\npause, \"You needn't mention my havin' asked for him. He may be\nsensitive about it.\"\n\nAs he came away, Maud followed him to the door. He whispered, \"Be\nready, my beauty, to start at a moment's notice. The money is on the\nway. You shall live like a queen before many days are gone.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" she answered, with a smile, but shutting the door\nbetween them.\n\nHe clinched his fists and muttered, \"I'll figure it all up and take my\npay, Missy. She's worth it. I will have to do some crooked things to\nget her; but by ----, I'd kill a dozen men and hang another, just to\nstand by and see her braid her hair.\"\n\nReturning to his house, he ran nimbly up the stairs, half fearing to\nfind Sleeny there, but he had not yet arrived. He seized the hammer,\nput it in his pocket, and came down again. Still intent upon accounting\nfor as much of the evening as possible, he thought of a variety-show in\nthe neighborhood, and went there. He spoke to some of the loafers at\nthe door. He then walked to the box-office and asked for a ticket,\naddressing the man who sold it to him as \"Jimmy,\" and asking how\nbusiness was. The man handed him his ticket without any reply, but\nturned to a friend beside him, and said, \"Who is that cheeky brother\nthat knows me so well?\"\n\n\"Oh! that's a rounder by the name of Offitt. He is a sort of Reformer--\nmakes speeches to the puddlers on the rights of man.\"\n\n\"Seems rather fresh,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"A little brine wouldn't hurt him.\"\n\nOffitt strolled into the theatre, which was well filled. The curtain\nwas down at the moment, and he walked the full extent of the centre\naisle to the orchestra, looking about him as if in search of some one.\nHe saw one or two acquaintances and nodded to them. He then walked back\nand took a seat near the door. The curtain rose, and the star of the\nevening bounded upon the stage,--a strapping young woman in the dress\nof an army officer. She was greeted with applause before she began her\nsong, and with her first notes Offitt quietly went out. He looked at\nthe clock on the City Hall, and saw that he had no more time to kill.\nHe walked, without hurrying or loitering, up the shady side of the\nstreet till he came to the quarter where Farnham lived. He then crossed\ninto the wide avenue, and, looking swiftly about him, approached the\nopen gates of Farnham's place. Two or three men were coming out, one or\ntwo were going in. He waited till the former had turned down the\nstreet, and the latter were on the door-step. He then walked briskly up\nthe path to the house; but instead of mounting the steps, he turned to\nthe left and lay down under the library windows behind a clump of\nlilacs.\n\n\"If they catch me here,\" he thought, \"they can only take me for a tramp\nand give me the grand bounce.\"\n\nThe windows opened upon a stone platform a few feet from the ground. He\ncould hear the sound of voices within. At last he heard the men rise,\npush back their chairs, and say \"Good-night.\" He heard their heavy\nshoes on the front steps. \"Now for it,\" he whispered. But at that\nmoment a belated tenant came in. He wanted to talk of some repairs to\nhis house. Offitt lay down again, resting his head on his arm. The soft\nturf, the stillness, the warmth of the summer night lulled him into\ndrowsiness. In spite of the reason he had for keeping awake, his eyes\nwere closing and his senses were fading, when a shrill whistle startled\nhim into broad wakefulness. It was the melancholy note of a\nwhippoorwill in the branches of a lime-tree in the garden. Offitt\nlistened for the sound of voices in the library. He heard nothing. \"Can\nI have slept through----no, there is a light.\" A shadow fell across the\nwindow. The heavy tread of Budsey approached. Farnham's voice was\nheard: \"Never mind the windows, Budsey. I will close them and the front\ndoor. I will wait here awhile; somebody else may come. You can go to\nbed.\"\n\n\"Good-night, sir.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"\n\nOffitt waited only a moment. He rose and looked cautiously in at the\nwindow. Farnham was seated at his desk. He had sorted, in the\nmethodical way peculiar to men who have held command in the army, the\npapers which he had been using with his tenants and the money he had\nreceived from them.\n\nThey were arranged on the desk before him in neat bundles, ready to be\ntransferred to the safe, across the room. He had taken up his pen to\nmake some final indorsement.\n\nOffitt drew off his shoes, leaped upon the platform, and entered the\nlibrary as swiftly and noiselessly as a panther walking over sand.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\nIN AND OUT OF WINDOWS.\n\n\nAlice Belding was seated before her glass braiding her long hair. Her\nmother had come in from her own room, as her custom often was, to chat\nwith her daughter in the half hour before bed-time. It gratified at\nonce her maternal love and her pride to watch the exquisite beauty of\nher child, as she sat, dressed in a white wrapper that made her seem\nstill taller than she was brushing and braiding the luxuriant tresses\nthat gave under the light every tint and reflection of which gold is\ncapable. The pink and pearl of the round arm as the loose sleeve would\nslip to the elbow, the poise of the proud head, the full white column\nof the neck, the soft curve of cheek and chin,--all this delighted her\nas it would have delighted a lover. But with all her light-headedness,\nthere was enough of discretion, or perhaps of innate New England\nreserve, to keep her from ever expressing to Alice her pleasure in her\nbeauty. So the wholesome-minded girl never imagined the admiration of\nwhich she was the object, and thought that her mother only liked to\nchat a little before sleeping. They talked of trivial matters, of the\ntea at Mrs. Hyson's, of Formosa Hyson's purple dress which made her\nsallower than ever, of rain and fair weather.\n\n\"I think,\" said Mrs. Bekling, \"that Phrasy Dallas gets more and more\nstylish every day. I don't wonder at Arthur Farnham's devotion. That\nwould make an excellent match--they are both so dreadfully clever. By\nthe way, he has not been here this week. And I declare! I don't believe\nyou have ever written him that note of thanks.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Alice, smiling--she had schooled herself by this time to\nspeak of him carelessly. \"I was too much frightened to thank him on the\nspot, and now it would be ancient history. We must save our thanks till\nwe see him.\"\n\n\"I want to see him about other things. You must write and ask him to\ndinner to-morrow or next day.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he would like it better if you would write?\"\n\n\"There you are again--as if it mattered. Write that 'Mamma bids me.'\nThere, your hair is braided. Write the note now, and I will send it\nover in the morning before he gets away.\"\n\nAlice rose and walked to her escritoire, her long robe trailing, her\nthick braids hanging almost to the floor, her fair cheek touched with a\ndelicate spot of color at the thought of writing a formal note to the\nman she worshipped. She took a pen and wrote \"My dear Mr. Farnham,\" and\nthe conventional address made her heart flutter and her eyes grow dim.\nWhile she was writing, she heard her mother say:\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nShe looked up, and saw that Mrs. Belding, having pushed open the\nshutters, had picked up her opera-glass and was looking through it at\nsomething out of the window.\n\n\"Do you know, Alice,\" she said, laughing, \"since that ailantus tree was\ncut down, you can see straight into his library from here. There he is\nnow, sitting at his desk.\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" pleaded Alice, rising and trying to take the glass away from\nher. \"Don't do that, I beg!\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said her mother, keeping her away with one hand and holding\nthe glass with the other. \"There comes Budsey to close the blinds. The\nshow is over. No; he goes away, leaving them open.\"\n\n\"Mamma, I will leave the room if----\"\n\n\"My goodness! look at that!\" cried the widow, putting the glass in her\ndaughter's hand and sinking into a chair with fright.\n\nAlice, filled with a nameless dread, saw her mother was pale and\ntrembling, and took the glass. She dropped it in an instant, and\nleaning from the window sent forth once more that cry of love and\nalarm, which rang through the stillness of night with all the power of\nher young throat:\n\n\"Arthur!\"\n\nShe turned, and sped down the stairs, and across the lawn like an arrow\nshot for life or death from a long-bow.\n\nFarnham heard the sweet, strong voice ringing out of the stillness like\nthe cry of an angel in a vision, and raised his head with a startled\nmovement from the desk where he was writing. Offitt heard it, too, as\nhe raised his hand to strike a deadly blow; and though it did not\nwithhold him from his murderous purpose, it disturbed somewhat the\nprecision of his hand. The hammer descended a little to the right of\nwhere he had intended to strike. It made a deep and cruel gash, and\nfelled Farnham to the floor, but it did not kill him. He rose, giddy\nand faint with the blow and half-blinded with the blood that poured\ndown over his right eye. He clapped his hand, with a soldier's\ninstinct, to the place where his sword-hilt was not, and then\nstaggered, rather than rushed, at his assailant, to grapple him with\nhis naked hands. Offitt struck him once more, and he fell headlong on\nthe floor, in the blaze of a myriad lights that flashed all at once\ninto deep darkness and silence.\n\nThe assassin, seeing that his victim no longer moved, threw down his\nreeking weapon, and, seizing the packages of money on the desk, thrust\nthem into his pockets. He stepped back through the open window and\nstooped to pick up his shoes. As he rose, he saw a sight which for an\ninstant froze him with terror. A tall and beautiful form, dressed all\nin white, was swiftly gliding toward him over the grass. It drew near,\nand he saw its pale features set in a terrible expression of pity and\nhorror. It seemed to him like an avenging spirit. He shut his eyes for\na moment in abject fright, and the phantom swept by him and leaped like\na white doe upon the platform, through the open window, and out of his\nsight. He ran to the gate, quaking and trembling, then walked quietly\nto the nearest corner, where he sat down upon the curb-stone and put on\nhis shoes.\n\nMrs. Belding followed, as rapidly as she could, the swift flight of her\ndaughter; but it was some minutes after the young girl had leaped\nthrough the window that her mother walked breathlessly through the\nfront door and the hall into the library. She saw there a sight which\nmade her shudder and turn faint. Alice was sitting on the floor,\nholding in her lap the blood-dabbled head of Farnham. Beside her stood\na glass of water, a pitcher, and several towels. Some of them were red\nand saturated, some were still fresh and neatly folded. She was\ncarefully cleansing and wiping the white forehead of the lifeless man\nof the last red drop.\n\n\"Oh, Alice, what is this?\" cried her mother.\n\n\"He is dead!\" she answered, in a hoarse, strained voice. \"I feared so\nwhen I first came in. He was lying on his face. I lifted him up, but he\ncould not see me. I kissed him, hoping he might kiss me again. But he\ndid not. Then I saw this water on the stand over there. I remembered\nthere were always towels there in the billiard-room. I ran and got\nthem, and washed the blood away from his face. See, his face is not\nhurt. I am glad of that. But there is a dreadful wound in his head.\"\nShe dropped her voice to a choking whisper at these words.\n\nHer mother gazed at her with speechless consternation. Had the shock\ndeprived her of reason?\n\n\"Alice,\" she said, \"this is no place for you. I will call the servants\nand send for a surgeon, and you must go home.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, mamma. I see I have frightened you, but there is no need to be\nfrightened. Yes, call the servants, but do not let them come in here\nfor awhile, not till the doctors come. They can do no good. He is\ndead.\"\n\nMrs. Belding had risen and rung the bell violently.\n\n\"Do, mamma, see the servants in the hall outside. Don't let them come\nin for a moment. Do! I pray! I pray! I will do anything for you.\"\n\nThere was such intensity of passion in the girl's prayer that her\nmother yielded, and when the servants came running in, half-dressed, in\nanswer to the bell, she stepped outside the door and said, \"Captain\nFarnham has been badly hurt. Two of you go for the nearest doctors. You\nneed not come in at present. My daughter and I will take care of him.\"\n\nShe went back, closing the door behind her. Alice was smiling. \"There,\nyou are a dear! I will love you forever for that! It is only for a\nmoment. The doctors will soon be here, and then I must give him up.\"\n\n\"Oh, Alice,\" the poor lady whimpered, \"why do you talk so wildly? What\ndo you mean?\"\n\n\"Don't cry, mamma! It is only for a moment. It is all very simple. I am\nnot crazy. He was my lover!\"\n\n\"Heaven help us!\"\n\n\"Yes, this dear man, this noble man offered me his love, and I refused\nit. I may have been crazy then, but I am not now. I can love him now. I\nwill be his widow--if I was not his wife. We will be two widows\ntogether--always. Now you know I am doing nothing wrong or wild. He is\nmine.\n\n\"Give me one of those towels,\" she exclaimed, suddenly. \"I can tie up\nhis head so that it will stop bleeding till the doctors come.\"\n\nShe took the towels, tore strips from her own dress, and in a few\nmoments, with singular skill and tenderness, she had stopped the flow\nof blood from the wound.\n\n\"There! He looks almost as if he were asleep, does he not? Oh, my love,\nmy love!\"\n\nUp to this moment she had not shed one tear. Her voice was strained,\nchoked, and sobbing, but her eyes were dry. She kissed him on his brow\nand his mouth. She bent over him and laid her smooth cheek to his. She\nmurmured:\n\n\"Good-by, good-by, till I come to you, my own love!\"\n\nAll at once she raised her head with a strange light in her eyes.\n\"Mamma!\" she cried, \"see how warm his cheek is. Heaven is merciful!\nperhaps he is alive.\"\n\nShe put both arms about him, and, gently but powerfully lifting his\ndead weight of head and shoulders, drew him to her heart. She held him\nto her warm bosom, rocking him to and fro. \"Oh, my beloved!\" she\nmurmured, \"if you will live, I will be so good to you.\"\n\nShe lowered him again, resting his head on her lap. A drop of blood,\nfrom the napkin in which his head was wrapped, had touched the bosom of\nher dress, staining it as if a cherry had been crushed there. She sat,\ngazing with an anguish of hope upon his pale face. A shudder ran\nthrough him, and he opened his eyes--only for a moment. He groaned, and\nslowly closed them.\n\nThe tears could no longer be restrained. They fell like a summer shower\nfrom her eyes, while she sobbed, \"Thank God! my darling is not dead.\"\n\nHer quick ear caught footsteps at the outer door. \"Here, mamma, take my\nplace. Let me hide before all those men come in.\"\n\nIn a moment she had leaped through the window, whence she ran through\nthe dewy grass to her home.\n\nAn hour afterward her mother returned, escorted by one of the surgeons.\nShe found Alice in bed, peacefully sleeping. As Mrs. Belding approached\nthe bedside, Alice woke and smiled. \"I know without your telling me,\nmamma. He will live. I began to pray for him,--but I felt sure he would\nlive, and so I gave thanks instead.\"\n\n\"You are a strange girl,\" said Mrs. Belding, gravely. \"But you are\nright. Dr. Cutts says, if he escapes without fever, there is nothing\nvery serious in the wound itself. The blow that made that gash in his\nhead was not the one which made him unconscious. They found another,\nbehind his ear; the skin was not broken. There was a bump about as big\nas a walnut. They said it was concussion of the brain, but no fracture\nanywhere. By the way, Dr. Cutts complimented me very handsomely on the\nway I had managed the case before his arrival. He said there was\npositively a professional excellence about my bandage. You may imagine\nI did not set him right.\"\n\nAlice, laughing and blushing, said, \"I will allow you all the credit.\"\n\nMrs. Belding kissed her, and said, \"Good-night,\" and walked to the\ndoor. There she paused a moment, and came back to the bed. \"I think,\nafter all, I had better say now what I thought of keeping till\nto-morrow. I thank you for your confidence to-night, and shall respect\nit. But you will see, I am sure, the necessity of being very\ncircumspect, under the circumstances. If you should want to do\nanything for Arthur while he is ill, I should feel it my duty to forbid\nit.\"\n\nAlice received this charge with frank, open eyes. \"I should not dream\nof such a thing,\" she said. \"If he had died, I should have been his\nwidow; but, as he is to live, he must come for me if he wants me. I was\nvery silly about him, but I must take the consequences. I can't now\ntake advantage of the poor fellow, by saving his life and establishing\na claim on it. So I will promise anything you want. I am so happy that\nI will promise easily. But I am also very sleepy.\"\n\nThe beautiful eyelids were indeed heavy and drooping. The night's\nexcitement had left her wearied and utterly content. She fell asleep\neven as her mother kissed her forehead.\n\nThe feeling of Offitt as he left Algonquin Avenue and struck into a\nside street was one of pure exultation. He had accomplished the boldest\nact of his life. He had shown address, skill, and courage. He had done\na thing which had appalled him in the contemplation, merely on account\nof its physical difficulties and dangers. He had done it successfully.\nHe had a large amount of money in his pocket--enough to carry his bride\nto the ends of the earth. When it was gone--well, at worst, he could\nleave her, and shift for himself again. He had not a particle of regret\nor remorse; and, in fact, these sentiments are far rarer than moralists\nwould have us believe. A ruffian who commits a crime usually glories in\nit. It exalts him in his own eyes, all the more that he is compelled to\nkeep silent about it. As Offitt walked rapidly in the direction of Dean\nStreet, the only shadow on his exultation was his sudden perception of\nthe fact that he had better not tell Maud what he had done. In all his\nplans he had promised himself the pleasure of telling her that she was\navenged upon her enemy by the hands of her lover; he had thought he\nmight extort his first kiss by that heroic avowal; but now, as he\nwalked stealthily down the silent street, he saw that nobody in the\nuniverse could be made his confidant.\n\n\"I'll never own it, in earth or hell,\" he said to himself.\n\nWhen he reached Matchin's cottage, all was dark and still. He tried to\nattract Maud's attention by throwing soft clods of earth against her\nwindow, but her sleep was too sound. He was afraid to throw pebbles for\nfear of breaking the panes and waking the family. He went into the\nlittle yard adjoining the shop, and found a ladder. He brought it out,\nand placed it against the wall. He perceived now for the first time\nthat his hands were sticky. He gazed at them a moment. \"Oh, yes,\" he\nsaid to himself, \"when he fell I held out my hands to keep his head\nfrom touching my clothes. Careless trick! Ought to have washed them,\nfirst thing.\" Then, struck by a sudden idea, he went to the well-curb,\nand slightly moistened his fingers. He then rubbed them on the\ndoor-knob, and the edge of the door of the cottage, and pressed them\nseveral times in different places on the ladder. \"Not a bad scheme,\"\nhe said, chuckling. He then went again to the well, and washed his\nhands thoroughly, afterward taking a handful of earth, and rubbing\nthem till they were as dirty as usual.\n\nAfter making all these preparations for future contingencies, he\nmounted the ladder, and tried to raise the window. It was already open\na few inches to admit the air, but was fastened there, and he could not\nstir it. He began to call and whistle in as low and penetrating a tone\nas he could manage, and at last awoke Maud, whose bed was only a few\nfeet away. She started up with a low cry of alarm, but saw in a moment\nwho it was.\n\n\"Well, what on earth are you doing here? Go away this minute, or I'll\ncall my father.\"\n\n\"Let me in, and I will tell you.\"\n\n\"I'll do nothing of the sort. Begone this instant.\"\n\n\"Maud, don't be foolish,\" he pleaded, in real alarm, as he saw that she\nwas angry and insulted. \"I have done as you told me. I have wealth for\nus both, and I have\"--he had almost betrayed himself, but he\nconcluded--\"I have come to take you away forever.\"\n\n\"Come to-morrow, at a decent hour, and I will talk to you.\"\n\n\"Now, Maud, my beauty, don't believe I am humbugging. I brought a lot\nof money for you to look at--I knew you wanted to be sure. See here!\"\nHe drew from his pocket a package of bank bills--he saw a glittering\nstain on them. He put them in the other pocket of his coat and took out\nanother package. \"And here's another, I've got a dozen like them.\nHandle 'em yourself.\" He put them in through the window. Maud was so\nnear that she could take the bills by putting out her hand. She saw\nthere was a large amount of money there--more than she had ever seen\nbefore.\n\n\"Come, my beauty,\" he said, \"this is only spending-money for a bridal\ntour. There are millions behind it. Get up and put on your dress. I\nwill wait below here. We can take the midnight train east, be married\nat Clairfield, and sail for Paris the next day. That's the world for\nyou to shine in. Come! Waste no time. No tellin' what may happen\ntomorrow.\"\n\nShe was strongly tempted. She had no longer any doubt of his wealth. He\nwas not precisely a hero in appearance, but she had never insisted upon\nthat--her romance having been always of a practical kind. She was about\nto assent--and to seal her doom--when she suddenly remembered that all\nher best clothes were in her mother's closet, which was larger than\nhers, and that she could not get them without passing through the room\nwhere her parents were asleep. That ended the discussion. It was out of\nthe question that she should marry this magnificent stranger in her\nevery-day dress and cotton stockings. It was equally impossible that\nshe should give that reason to any man. So she said, with dignity:\n\n\"Mr. Offitt, it is not proper for me to continue this conversation any\nlonger. You ought to see it ain't. I shall be happy to see you\nto-morrow.\"\n\nOffitt descended the ladder, grinding out curses between his set teeth.\nA hate, as keen as his passion, for the foolish girl fired him.\n\"Think,\" he hissed, \"a man that killed, half an hour ago, the biggest\nswell in Buffland, to be treated that way by a carpenter's wench.\"\n\"Wait awhile, Miss; it'll come my innings.\" He lifted up the ladder,\ncarried it carefully around the house, and leaned it against the wall\nunder the window of the room occupied by Sleeny.\n\nHe hurried back to his lodging in Perry Place, where he found Sam\nSleeny lying asleep on his bed. He was not very graciously greeted by\nhis drowsy visitor.\n\n\"Why didn't you stay out all night?\" Sam growled. \"Where have you been,\nanyhow?\"\n\n\"I've been at the variety-show, and it was the boss fraud of the\nseason.\"\n\n\"You stayed so long you must have liked it.\"\n\n\"I was waiting to see just how bad a show could be and not spoil.\"\n\n\"What did you want to see me about tonight?\"\n\n\"The fact is, I expected to meet a man around at the Varieties who was\nto go in with us into a big thing. But he wasn't there. I'll nail him\nto-morrow, and then we can talk. It's big money, Sammy, and no\ndiscount. What would you think of a thousand dollars a month?\"\n\n\"I'd a heap rather see it than hear you chin about it. Give me my\nhammer, and I'll go home.\"\n\n\"Why, I took it round to your shop this evening, and I tossed it in\nthrough the window. I meant to throw it upon the table, but it went\nover, I think from the sound, and dropped on the floor. You will find\nit among the shavings, I reckon,\"\n\n\"Well, I'm off,\" said Sam, by way of good-night.\n\n\"All right. Guess I'll see you to-morrow.\"\n\nOffitt waited till he could hear the heavy tread of Sleeny completing\nthe first flight of stairs and going around to the head of the second.\nHe then shut and locked his door, and hung his hat over the keyhole. He\nturned up his lamp and sat down by the table to count his night's\ngains. The first package he took from his pocket had a shining stain\nupon the outside bill. He separated the stained bill carefully from the\nrest, and held it a moment in his hand as if in doubt. He walked to his\nwash-stand, but at the moment of touching his pitcher he stopped short.\nHe took out his handkerchief, but shook his head and put it back.\nFinally, he lighted a match, applied it to the corner of the bill, and\nwatched it take fire and consume, until his fingers were scorched by\nthe blaze. \"Pity!\" he whispered--\"good money like that.\"\n\nHe seated himself again and began with a fierce, sustained delight to\narrange and sort the bank-bills, laying the larger denominations by\nthemselves, smoothing them down with a quick and tender touch, a\nkindling eye and a beating heart. In his whole life, past and future,\nthere was not such another moment of enjoyment. Money is, of course,\nprecious and acceptable to all men except idiots. But, if it means much\nto the good and virtuous, how infinitely more it means to the\nthoroughly depraved--the instant gratification of every savage and\nhungry devil of a passion which their vile natures harbor. Though the\nfirst and principal thing Offitt thought of was the possession of Maud\nMatchin, his excited fancy did not stop there. A long gallery of\nvicious pictures stretched out before his flaming eyes, as he reckoned\nup the harvest of his hand. The mere thought that each bill represented\na dinner, where he might eat and drink what he liked, was enough to\ninebriate a starved rogue whose excesses had always been limited by his\npoverty.\n\nWhen he had counted and sorted his cash, he took enough for his\nimmediate needs and put it in his wallet. The rest he made up into\nconvenient packages, which he tied compactly with twine and disposed in\nhis various pockets. \"I'll chance it,\" he thought, after some\ndeliberation. \"If they get me, they can get the money, too. But they\nsha'n't get it without me.\"\n\nHe threw himself on his bed, and slept soundly till morning.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nOFFITT PLANS A LONG JOURNEY.\n\n\nThe bright sun and the morning noises of the city waked Offitt from his\nsleep. As he dressed himself the weight of the packages in his pockets\ngave him a pleasant sensation to begin the day with. He felt as if he\nwere entering upon a new state of existence--a life with plenty of\nmoney. He composed in his mind an elaborate breakfast as he walked\ndown-stairs and took his way to a restaurant, which he entered with the\nassured step of a man of capital. He gave his order to the waiter with\nmore decision than usual, and told him in closing \"not to be all day\nabout it, either.\"\n\nWhile waiting for his breakfast, he opened the morning \"Bale Fire\" to\nsee if there was any account of \"The Algonquin Avenue Tragedy.\" This\nwas the phrase which he had arranged in his mind as the probable\nhead-line of the article. He had so convinced himself of the efficacy\nof his own precautions, that he anticipated the same pleasure in\nreading the comments upon his exploit that an author whose incognito\nis assured enjoys in reading the criticisms of his anonymous work.\nHe was at first disappointed in seeing no allusion to the affair in\nthe usual local columns; but at last discovered in a corner of the\npaper this double-leaded postscript:\n\n\"We stop the press to state that an appalling crime was last night\ncommitted in Algonquin Avenue. The mansion of Arthur Farnham, Esq., was\nentered by burglars between ten and eleven o'clock, and that gentleman\nassaulted and probably murdered.\n\n\"Full particulars in a later edition.\"\n\n\"LATER. Captain Farnham is still living, and some hopes are entertained\nof his recovery. The police have found the weapon with which the almost\nfatal blow was struck--a carpenter's hammer marked with a letter S. It\nis thought this clew will lead to the detection of the guilty parties.\"\n\nOffitt was not entirely pleased with the tone of this notice. He had\nexpected some reference to the address and daring of the burglar. But\nhe smiled to himself, \"Why should I care for Sam's reputation?\" and ate\nhis breakfast with a good appetite. Before he had finished, however, he\ngreatly modified his plan, which was to have the threads of evidence\nlead naturally, of themselves, to the conviction of Sleeny. He\ndetermined to frighten Sam, if possible, out of the city, knowing that\nhis flight would be conclusive evidence of guilt. He swallowed his\ncoffee hurriedly and walked down to Dean Street, where by good fortune\nhe found Sam alone in the shop. He was kicking about a pile of shavings\non the floor. He turned as Offitt entered and said: \"Oh, there you are.\nI can't find that hammer anywhere.\"\n\nOffitt's face assumed a grieved expression. \"Come, come, Sam, don't\nstand me off that way. I'm your friend, if you've got one in the world.\nYou mustn't lose a minute more. You've got time now to catch the 8.40.\nCome, jump in a hack and be off.\"\n\nHis earnestness and rapidity confused Sleeny, and drove all thoughts of\nthe hammer from his mind. He stared at Offitt blankly, and said, \"Why,\nwhat are you givin' me now?\"\n\n\"I'm a-givin' you truth and friendship, and fewest words is best. Come,\nlight out, and write where you stop. I'll see you through.\"\n\n\"See here,\" roared Sam, \"are you crazy or am I? Speak out! What's up?\"\n\n\"Oh! I've got to speak it out, raw and plain, have I? Very well! Art.\nFarnham was attacked and nearly murdered last night, and if you didn't\ndo it who did? Now come, for the Lord's sake, get off before the police\nget here. I never thought you had the sand--but I see you've got too\nmuch. Don't lose time talking any more. I'm glad you've killed him. You\ndone just right--but I don't want to see you hung for it.\"\n\nHis excitement and feigned earnestness had brought the tears to his\neyes. Sam saw them and was convinced.\n\n\"Andy,\" he said solemnly. \"I know you're my friend, and mean right.\nI'll swear before God it wasn't me, and I know nothing about it, and I\nwon't run away.\"\n\n\"But how will we prove it,\" said Offitt, wringing his hands in\ndistress. \"Where was you last night from ten to eleven?\"\n\n\"You know where I was--in your room. I went there just after nine and\nfell asleep waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, but who knows it? Sam, I believe you are innocent\nsince you say so. But see the circumstances. You _have_ talked about\ngoin' for him. You _have_ had a fight with him, and got put in jail for\nit, and--\" he was about to mention the hammer, but was afraid--\"I wish\nyou would take my advice and go off for a week or so till the truth\ncomes out. I'll lend you all the money you want. I'm flush this week.\"\n\n\"No, Andy,\" said Sleeny, \"nobody could be kinder than you. But I won't\nrun away. They can't put a man where he wasn't.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Offitt, \"I admire your pluck, and I'll swear a\nblue streak for you when the time comes. And perhaps I had better get\naway now so they won't know I've been with you.\"\n\nHe went without a moment's delay to the chief of police and told him\nthat he had a disagreeable duty to perform; that he knew the murderer\nof Captain Farnham; that the criminal was an intimate friend of his, a\nyoung man hitherto of good character named Sleeny.\n\n\"Ah-ha!\" said the chief. \"That was the fellow that Captain Farnham\nknocked down and arrested in the riot.\"\n\n\"The same,\" said Offitt. \"He has since that been furious against the\nCaptain. I have reasoned with him over and over about it. Yesterday he\ncame to see me; showed me a hammer he had just bought at Ware &\nHarden's; said he was going to break Arthur Farnham's skull with it. I\ndidn't believe he would, he had said it so often before. While we were\ntalking, I took the hammer and cut his initial on it, a letter S.\" The\nchief nodded, with a broad smile. \"He then left me, and when I came\nback to my room a little before midnight, I found him there. He looked\nexcited, and wanted me to go and get a drink with him. I declined, and\nhe went off. This morning when I heard about the murder I said: 'He's\nthe man that did the deed.'\"\n\n\"You have not seen him since last night?\"\n\n\"No; I suppose, of course, he has run away.\"\n\n\"Where did he live?\"\n\n\"Dean Street, at Matchin's the carpenter.\"\n\nThe chief turned to his telegraphic operator and rapidly gave orders\nfor the arrest of Sleeny by the police of the nearest station. He also\nsent for the clerks who were on duty the day before at Ware & Harden's.\n\n\"Mr. ----, I did not get your name,\" he said to Offitt, who gave him\nhis name and address. \"You have acted the part of a good citizen.\"\n\n\"The most painful act of my life,\" Offitt murmured.\n\n\"Of course. But duty before everything. I will have to ask you to wait\na little while in the adjoining room till we see whether this man can\nbe found.\"\n\nOffitt was shown into a small room, barely furnished, with two doors;\nthe one through which he had just come, and one opening apparently into\nthe main corridor of the building. Offitt, as soon as he was alone,\nwalked stealthily to the latter door and tried to open it. It was\nlocked, and there was no key. He glanced at the window; there was an\niron grating inside the sash, which was padlocked. A cold sweat bathed\nhim from head to foot. He sank into a chair, trembling like a leaf. He\nfelt for his handkerchief to wipe his wet forehead. His hand touched\none of the packages of money. He bounded from his chair in sudden joy.\n\"They did not search me, so they don't suspect. It is only to make sure\nof my evidence that they keep me here.\" Nevertheless, the time went\nheavily. At last an officer came in and said he was to come to the\npolice justice's for the preliminary examination of Sleeny.\n\n\"They have caught him, then?\" he asked, with assumed eagerness and\nsurprise. \"He had not got away?\"\n\n\"No,\" the man answered curtly.\n\nThey came to the court-room in a few steps. Sam was there between two\npolicemen. As Offitt entered, he smiled and slightly nodded. One or two\nmen who had been summoned as witnesses were standing near the justice.\nThe proceedings were summary.\n\nOne of the policemen said that he had gone to Matchin's shop to arrest\nthe prisoner; that the prisoner exhibited no surprise; his first words\nwere, \"Is Mr. Farnham dead yet?\"\n\nOffitt was then called upon, and he repeated, clearly and concisely,\nthe story he had told the chief of police. When he had concluded he was\nshown the hammer which had been picked up on the floor at Farnham's,\nand was asked, \"Is that the hammer you refer to?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is it.\"\n\nThese words were the signal for a terrible scene.\n\nWhen Sleeny saw Offitt step forward and begin to give his evidence, he\nleaned forward with a smile of pleased expectation upon his face. He\nhad such confidence in his friend's voluble cleverness that he had no\ndoubt Offitt would \"talk him free\" in a few minutes. He was confused a\nlittle by his opening words, not clearly seeing his drift; but as the\nstory went on, and Offitt's atrocious falsehood became clear to his\nmind, he was dumb with stupefaction, and felt a strange curiosity\nwakening in him to see how the story would end. He did not, for the\nmoment, see what object Offitt could have in lying so, until the\nthought occurred to him: \"May be there's a reward out!\" But when the\nblood-stained hammer was shown and identified by Offitt, all doubt was\ncleared away in a flash from the dull brain of Sleeny. He saw the whole\nhorrible plot of which he was the victim.\n\nHe rose from his seat before the officer could stop him, and roared\nlike a lion in the toils, in a voice filled equally with agony and\nrage:\n\n\"You murdering liar! I'll tear your heart out of you!\"\n\nThere was a wide table and several chairs between them, but Sleeny was\nover them in an instant. Offitt tried to escape, but was so hemmed in,\nthat the infuriated man had him in his hands before the officers could\ninterpose. If they had delayed a moment longer all would have been\nover, for already Sleeny's hands were at the throat of his betrayer.\nBut two powerful policemen with their clubs soon separated the\ncombatants, and Sleeny was dragged back and securely handcuffed.\n\nOffitt, ghastly pale and trembling, had sunk upon a bench. The justice,\nlooking at him narrowly, said: \"The man is going to faint; loosen his\ncollar.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Offitt, springing to his feet. \"I am perfectly well.\"\n\nIn his struggle with Sleeny a button of his coat had been torn away. He\nasked a by-stander for a pin, and carefully adjusted the garment. The\nthought in his mind was, \"I don't mind being killed; but I thought he\nmight tear off my coat, and show them my money.\" From this moment he\nkept his hand in such position that he might feel the packages in his\npockets.\n\nSleeny was still panting and screaming execrations at Offitt. The\njustice turned to him with sternness, and said, \"Silence there! Have\nyou not sense enough to see how your ferocious attack on the witness\ndamages you? If you can't restrain your devilish temper while your\nfriend is giving his evidence, it will be all the worse for you.\"\n\n\"Judge,\" cried Sam, now fairly beside himself, \"that's the murderer! I\nknow it. I can prove it. He ain't fit to live. I'll break his neck\nyet!\"\n\nOffitt raised his hands and eyes in deprecating sorrow.\n\n\"This is the wild talk of a desperate man,\" said the justice. \"But you\nmay as well tell us how you passed last evening.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Offitt, consulting his memory. \"Let me see. I took\nsupper about seven at Duffer's; I went to Glauber's drug-store next and\ngot a glass of soda water; if they don't know me, they'll remember my\nbreaking a glass; then I made a visit at Mr. Matchin's on Dean Street;\nthen I went to the Orleans theatre; I come out between the acts and got\na cup of coffee at Mouchem's--then I went back and stayed till the show\nwas over, that was about half-past eleven. Then I went home and found\nMr. Sleeny there.\"\n\n\"You had better go with Mr. Fangwell, and let him verify this\nstatement,\" said the justice.\n\nHe then called the policeman who arrived first at Farnham's house the\nnight before. He told his story and identified the hammer which had\nbeen shown to Offitt. A young man from Ware & Harden's swore that he\nhad sold the hammer the day before to Sleeny, whom he knew. The justice\nheld this evidence sufficient to justify Sleeny's detention.\n\n\"I should think so,\" said some of the by-standers. \"If it don't hang\nhim, there's a loud call for Judge Lynch.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said the justice. \"The prisoner will be taken for the\npresent to the city jail.\"\n\nSam was led out, and Offitt accompanied the chief of police back to the\nroom he had just quitted. He remained there several hours which seemed\nto him interminable. At last, however, the detective who had been sent\nto inquire as to the truth of the account he had given of himself,\nreturned with a full confirmation of it, and Offitt was suffered to go,\non his own engagement to give further evidence when called upon.\n\nHe left the City Hall with a great load off his mind. It was not\nwithout an effort that he had sworn away the character, the freedom,\nand perhaps the life of his comrade. If he could have accomplished his\npurpose without crushing Sleeny he would have preferred it. But the\nattack which his goaded victim had made upon him in the court-room was\nnow a source of lively satisfaction to him. It created a strong\nprejudice against the prisoner; it caused the justice at once to\nbelieve him guilty, and gave Offitt himself an injured feeling that was\nextremely comforting in view of what was to happen to Sleeny.\n\nHe went along the street tapping his various pockets furtively as he\nwalked. He was hungry. His diverse emotions had given him an appetite.\nHe went into an eating-house and commanded a liberal supper. He had an\nodd fancy as he gave his order. \"That's the sort of supper I would\nhave, if it was my last--if I was to be hanged tomorrow.\" He thought of\nSleeny and hoped they would treat him well in jail. He felt\nmagnanimously toward him. \"Who would have thought,\" he mused, \"that Sam\nhad such a devil of a temper? I most hope that Farnham won't die--it\nwould be rough on Sam. Though perhaps that would be best all round,\" he\nadded, thinking of Sam's purple face in the court-room and the eager\ngrip of his fingers.\n\nHe came out of the eating-house into the gathering twilight. The lamps\nwere springing into light in long straight lines down the dusky\nstreets. The evening breeze blew in from the great lake tempering the\nstale heat of the day. Boys were crying the late editions of the\nnewspapers with \"Full account arrest o' the Farnham burglar!\" He bought\none, but did not stop to open it. He folded it into the smallest\npossible compass, and stuffed it into his pocket, \"along with the other\ndocuments in the case,\" as he chuckled to himself; \"I'll read all about\nit in the train to-morrow--business before pleasure,\" he continued,\npleased with his wit.\n\nEvery moment he would put his hand into his side pocket and feel the\npackage containing the largest bills. He knew it was imprudent--that it\nmight attract the attention of thieves or detectives; but to save his\nlife he could not have kept from doing it. At last he scratched his\nhand on the pin which was doing duty for the button he had lost in his\nscuffle with Sleeny. \"Ah!\" he said to himself, with humorous banter,\n\"it won't do to be married in a coat with the buttons off.\"\n\nHe went into a little basement shop where a sign announced that\n\"Scouring and Repairing\" were done. A small and bald Hamburger stepped\nforward, rubbing his hands. Offitt told him what he wanted, and the man\ngot a needle and thread and selected from a large bowl of buttons on a\nshelf one that would suit. While he was sewing it on, he said:\n\n\"Derrible news apout Gabben Farnham.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Offitt. \"Is he dead?\"\n\n\"I don't know off he ish tet. Dey say he ish oud mid his het, und tat\nlooksh mighty pad. But one ting ish goot; dey cotch de murterer.\"\n\n\"They have?\" asked Offitt, with languid interest. \"What sort of fellow\nis he?\"\n\n\"Mutter Gottes!\" said the little German. \"De vorst kind. He would\nradder gill a man as drink a glass bier. He gome mighty near gillin'\nhis pest vrient to-day in de gourt-house droben, ven he vas dellin' vat\nhe knowed apout it alleweil.\"\n\n\"A regular fire-eater,\" said Offitt. \"So you've finished, have you? How\nmuch for the job!\"\n\nThe German was looking at a stain on the breast of the coat.\n\n\"Vot's dish?\" he said. \"Looksh like baint. Yust lemme take your coat\noff a minute and I gleans dot up like a nudel soup.\"\n\n\"Say, mind your own business, won't you?\" growled Offitt. \"Here's your\nmoney, and when I want any of your guff I'll let you know.\"\n\nHe hurried out, leaving the poor German amazed at the ill result of his\neffort to turn an honest penny and do a fellow-creature a service.\n\n\"Vunny beebles!\" he said to himself. \"But I got a kevarter off a tollar\nfor a den-cent chob.\"\n\nOffitt came out of the shop and walked at a rapid pace to Dean Street.\nHe was determined to make an end at once of Maud's scruples and\ncoquetry. He said to himself: \"If we are both alive to-morrow, we shall\nbe married.\" He believed if he could have her to himself for half an\nhour, he could persuade her to come with him. He was busy all the way\nplotting to get her parents out of the house. It would be easy enough\nto get them out of the room; but he wanted them out of hearing, out of\nreach of a cry for help even.\n\nHe found them all together in the sitting-room. The arrest of Sleeny\nhad fallen heavily upon them. They had no doubt of his guilt, from the\nreports they had heard, and their surprise and horror at his crime were\nnot lessened but rather increased by their familiar affection for him.\n\n\"To think,\" said Saul to his wife, \"that that boy has worked at the\nsame bench, and slept in the same house with me for so many years, and\nI never knowed the Satan that was in him!\"\n\n\"It's in all of us, Saul,\" said Mrs. Matchin, trying to improve the\noccasion for the edification of her unbelieving husband.\n\nMaud had felt mingled with her sorrow a suspicion of remorse. She could\nnot help remembering that Sam considered Farnham his rival, with how\nlittle reason she knew better than any one. She could understand how\nher beauty might have driven him to violence; but when the story of the\nrobbery transpired also--as it did in the course of the morning,--she\nwas greatly perplexed. When she joined in the lamentations of her\nparents and said she never could have believed that of Sam Sleeny, she\nwas thinking of the theft, and not of the furious assault. When they\nhad all, however, exhausted their limited store of reflections, a thing\ntook place which increased the horror and the certainty of Mr. and Mrs.\nMatchin, and left Maud a prey to a keener doubt and anxiety than ever.\nLate in the afternoon a sharp-faced man, with a bright eye and a red\nmustache, came to the house and demanded in the name of the law to be\nshown Sam's bedroom. He made several notes and picked up some trifling\narticles, for which he gave Mr. Matchin receipts. Corning out of the\nroom, he looked carefully at the door-knob. \"Seems all right,\" he said.\nThen turning to Matchin, he said, with professional severity, \"What\ndoor did he generally come in by?\"\n\n\"Sometimes one and sometimes another,\" said Saul, determined not to\ngive any more information than he must.\n\n\"Well, I'll look at both,\" the detective said.\n\nThe first one stood his scrutiny without effect, but at the second his\neye sparkled and his cheek flushed with pleasure, when he saw the\nfaint, red-dish-brown streaks which Offitt had left there the night\nbefore. He could not express his exultation; turning to Saul, \"There's\nwhere he came in last night, any way.\"\n\n\"He didn't do no such a thing,\" replied Saul. \"That door I locked\nmyself last night before he came in.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did? So you're sure he came in at the other door, are you. We\nwill see if he could get in any other way.\"\n\nWalking around the corner, he saw the ladder where Offitt had left it.\n\n\"Hello! that's his window, ain't it?\"\n\nWithout waiting for an answer the detective ran up the ladder, studying\nevery inch of its surface as he ran. He came down positively radiant,\nand slapped Saul heartily on the shoulder.\n\n\"All right, old man. I'll trouble you to keep that ladder and that door\njust as they are. They are important papers. Why don't you see?\" he\ncontinued--\"bless your innocent old heart, he comes home with his hands\njust reg'larly dripping with murder. He fumbles at that door, finds it\nlocked, and so gets that ladder, histes it up to the window, and hops\ninto bed as easy as any Christian schoolboy in town, and he thinks he's\nall right--but he never thinks of Tony Smart, your humble servant.\"\n\nThis view of the case was perfectly convincing to Saul and also to his\nwife when he repeated it at the supper-table; but it struck Maud with a\nsudden chill. She remembered that when she had dismissed Offitt from\nthat midnight conference at her casement, he had carefully taken the\nladder away from her window, and had set it against the house some\ndistance off. She had admired at the time his considerate chivalry, and\nthought how nice it was to have a lover so obedient and so careful of\nher reputation. But now, the detective's ghastly discovery turned her\nthought in a direction which appalled her. Could it be possible--and\nall that money--where did it come from? As she sat with her parents in\nthe gathering darkness, she kept her dreadful anxiety to herself. She\nhad been hoping all day to see her lover--now she feared to have him\ncome, lest her new suspicions might be confirmed. She quickly resolved\nupon one thing: she would not go away with him that night--not until\nthis horrible mystery was cleared up. If she was worth having she was\nworth waiting for a little while.\n\nThey all three started as the door opened and Offitt came in. He wasted\nno time in salutations, but said at once, \"It's a funny thing, but I\nhave got a message for each of you. The district attorney saw me coming\nup this way, Mr. Matchin, and asked me to tell you to come down as\nquick as you can to his office--something very important, he said. And,\nstranger than that, I met Mr. Wixham right out here by the corner, and\nhe asked me if I was comin' here, and if I would ask you, Mrs. Matchin,\nto come right up to their house. Jurildy is sick and wants to see you,\nand he has run off for the doctor.\"\n\nBoth the old people bustled up at this authoritative summons, and\nOffitt as they went out said, \"I'll stay a while and keep Miss Maud\nfrom gettin' lonesome.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" said Mrs. Matchin. \"The house seems creepy-like\nwith Sam where he is.\"\n\nMaud felt her heart sink at the prospect of being left alone with the\nman she had been longing all day to see. She said, \"Mother, I think I\nought to go with you!\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" her mother replied. \"You ain't wanted, and it wouldn't\nbe polite to Mr. Offitt.\"\n\nThe moment they were gone, Offitt sprang to the side of Maud, and\nseized her hands.\n\n\"Now, my beauty, you will be mine. Put on your hat and we will go.\"\n\nShe struggled to free her hands.\n\n\"Let go,\" she said, \"you hurt me. Why are you in such a terrible\nhurry?\"\n\n\"Why can you ask? Your parents will be back in a few minutes. Of\ncourse you know that story was only to get them out of our way. Come,\nmy beautiful Maud! my joy, my queen! To-morrow New York! next day the\nsea, and then Europe and love and pleasure all your life.\"\n\n\"I want to talk with you a minute,\" said Maud, in a voice which\ntrembled in spite of her efforts. \"I can't talk in the dark. Wait here,\ntill I get a lamp.\"\n\nShe slipped from the room before he could prevent her and left him\npacing the floor in a cold rage. It was only a moment, however, until\nshe returned, bringing a lamp, which she placed on a table, and then\nasked him to be seated, in a stiff, formal way, which at once irritated\nand enchanted him. He sat down and devoured her with his eyes. He was\nangry when she went for the lamp; but, as its light fell on her rich,\ndark hair, her high color, and her long, graceful figure, as she leaned\nback in her chair, he felt that the tenderest conversation with her in\nthe darkness would lose something of the pleasure that the eyes took in\nher. This he said to her, in his coarse but effective way.\n\nShe answered him with coquettish grace, willing to postpone the serious\ntalk she dreaded so. But the conversation was in stronger hands than\nhers, and she found herself forced, in a few minutes, to either go with\nhim, or give a reason why.\n\n\"The fact is, then,\" she stammered, with a great effort, \"I don't know\nyou well enough yet. Why cannot you wait a while?\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Come with me, and you will know me better in a day than you would here\nin a year. Do not waste these precious moments. Our happiness depends\nupon it. We have everything we can desire. I cannot be myself here. I\ncannot disclose my rank and my wealth to these people who have only\nknown me as an apostle of labor. I want to go where you will be a great\nlady. Oh, come!\" he cried, with an outburst of pent-up fire, throwing\nhimself on the floor at her feet, and laying his head upon her knee.\nShe was so moved by this sudden outbreak, which was wholly new to her\nexperience, that she almost forgot her doubts and fears. But a remnant\nof practical sense asserted itself. She rose from her chair, commanded\nhim once more to be seated, and said:\n\n\"I am afraid I am going to offend you, but I must ask you something.\"\n\n\"Ask me anything,\" he said, with a smile, \"except to leave you.\"\n\nShe thought the phrase so pretty that she could hardly find courage to\nput her question. She blushed and stammered, and then, rushing at it\nwith desperation, she said:\n\n\"That money--where did you get it?\"\n\n\"I will tell you when we are married. It is a secret.\"\n\nHe tried still to smile, but she saw the laughter dying away from his\nface.\n\nHer blood turned cold in her veins, but her heart grew stronger, and\nshe determined to know the worst. She was not a refined or clever\nwoman; but the depth of her trouble sharpened her wits, and she\ninstinctively made use of her woman's wiles to extort the truth from\nthe man who she knew was under the spell of her beauty, whatever else\nhe was.\n\n\"Come here!\" she said. Her face was pale, but her lips were smiling.\n\"Get down there where you were!\" she continued, with tender\nimperiousness. He obeyed her, hardly daring to trust his senses. \"Now\nput your hands between my hands,\" she said, still with that pale,\nsingular smile, which filled him with unquiet transports, \"and tell me\nthe truth, you bad boy!\"\n\n\"The truth,\" with a beating of the heart which made his utterance\nthick, \"the truth is, that you are the most glorious woman in the\nworld, and that you will be mine to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she almost whispered. \"But you must tell me something else.\nI am afraid you are a naughty boy, and that you love me too much. I\nonce told you I had an enemy, and that I wanted somebody to punish him.\nDid you go and punish him for me--tell me that?\"\n\nHer voice was soft and low and beguiling. She still smiled on him,\nleaving one hand in his, while she raised the forefinger of the other\nin coquettish admonition. The ruffian at her feet was inebriated with\nher beauty and her seductive playfulness. He thought she had divined\nhis act--that she considered it a fine and heroic test of love to which\nshe had subjected him. He did not hesitate an instant, but said:\n\n\"Yes, my beauty, and I am ready to do the same for anybody who gives\nyou a cross look.\"\n\nNow that she had gained the terrible truth, a sickening physical fear\nof the man came over her, and she felt herself growing faint. His voice\nsounded weak and distant as he said:\n\n\"Now you will go with me, won't you?\"\n\nShe could make no answer. So he continued:\n\n\"Run and get your hat. Nothing else. We can buy all you want. And\nhurry. They may come back any moment.\"\n\nShe perceived a chance of escape and roused herself. She thought if she\ncould only get out of the room she might save herself by flight or by\noutcry.\n\n\"Wait here,\" she whispered, \"and be very quiet.\"\n\nHe kissed his fingers to her without a word. She opened the door into\nthe next room, which was the kitchen and dining-room of the family, and\nthere, not three feet from her, in the dim light, haggard and wan,\nbareheaded, his clothes in rags about him, she saw Sam Sleeny.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\nA LEAP FOR SOMEBODY'S LIFE.\n\n\nWhen Sleeny was led from the room of the police justice in the\nafternoon, he was plunged in a sort of stupor. He could not recover\nfrom the surprise and sense of outrage with which he had listened to\nOffitt's story. What was to happen to him he accepted with a despair\nwhich did not trouble itself about the ethics of the transaction. It\nwas a disaster, as a stroke of lightning might be. It seemed to him the\nwork had been thoroughly and effectually done. He could see no way out\nof it; in fact, his respect for Offitt's intelligence was so great that\nhe took it for granted Andy had committed no mistakes, but that he had\nmade sure of his ruin. He must go to prison; if Farnham died, he must\nbe hanged. He did not weary his mind in planning for his defence when\nhis trial should come on. He took it for granted he should be\nconvicted. But if he could get out of prison, even if it were only for\na few hours, and see Andy Offitt once more--he felt the blood tingling\nthrough all his veins at the thought. This roused him from his lethargy\nand made him observant and alert. He began to complain of his\nhandcuffs; they were in truth galling his wrists. It was not difficult\nfor him to twist his hands so as to start the blood in one or two\nplaces. He showed these quietly to the policemen, who sat with him in a\nsmall anteroom leading to the portion of the city jail, where he was to\nbe confined for the night. He seemed so peaceable and quiet that they\ntook off the irons, saying good-naturedly, \"I guess we can handle you.\"\nThey were detained in this room for some time waiting for the warden of\nthe jail to come and receive their prisoner. There were two windows,\nboth giving view of a narrow street, where it was not bright at\nnoonday, and began to grow dark at sunset with the shade of the high\nhouses and the thick smoke of the quarter. The windows were open, as\nthe room was in the third story, and was therefore considered\nabsolutely safe. Sleeny got up several times and walked first to one\nwindow and then to another, casting quick but searching glances at the\nstreet and the walls. He saw that some five feet from one of the\nwindows a tin pipe ran along the wall to the ground. The chances were\nten to one that any one risking the leap would be dashed to pieces on\nthe pavement below. But Sleeny could not get that pipe out of his head.\n\"I might as well take my chance\" he said to himself. \"It would be no\nworse to die that way than to be hanged.\" He grew afraid to trust\nhimself in sight of the window and the pipe: it exercised so strong a\nfascination upon him. He sat down with his back to the light and leaned\nhis head on his hands. But he could think of nothing but his leap for\nliberty. He felt in fancy his hands and knees clasping that slender\nladder of safety; he began to think what he would do when he struck the\nsidewalk, if no bones were broken. First, he would bide from pursuit,\nif possible. Then he would go to Dean Street and get a last look at\nMaud, if he could; then his business would be to find Offitt. \"If I\nfind him,\" he thought, \"I'll give them something to try me for.\" But\nfinally he dismissed the matter from his mind,--for this reason. He\nremembered seeing a friend, the year before, fall from a scaffolding\nand break his leg. The broken bone pierced through the leg of his\ntrousers. This thought daunted him more than death on the gallows.\n\nThe door opened, and three or four policemen came in, each leading a\nman by the collar, the ordinary riffraff of the street, charged with\npetty offences. One was very drunk and abusive. He attracted the\nattention of everybody in the room by his antics. He insisted on\ndancing a breakdown which he called the \"Essence of Jeems' River\"; and\nin the scuffle which followed, first one and then the other policeman\nin charge of Sleeny became involved. Sleeny was standing with his back\nto the window, quite alone. The temptation was too much for him. He\nleaped upon the sill, gave one mighty spring, caught the pipe, and slid\nsafely to the ground. One or two passers-by saw him drop lightly to the\nsidewalk, but thought nothing of it. It was not the part of the jail in\nwhich prisoners were confined, and he might have been taken for a\ncarpenter or plumber who chose that unusual way of coming from the\nroof. His hat blew off in his descent, but he did not waste time in\nlooking for it. He walked slowly till he got to the corner, and then\nplunged through the dark and ill-smelling streets of the poor and\ncrowded quarter, till he came by the open gate of a coal-yard. Seeing\nhe was not pursued he went in, concealed himself behind a pile of\nboards and lay there until it was quite dark.\n\nHe then came out and walked through roundabout ways, avoiding the\ngas-lights and the broad thoroughfares, to Dean Street. He climbed the\nfence and crept through the garden to the back door of the house. He\nhad eaten nothing since early morning, and was beginning to be hungry.\nHe saw there were no lights in the rear of the house, and thought if he\ncould enter the kitchen he might get a loaf of bread without alarming\nthe household. He tried the back door and found it fastened. But\nknowing the ways of the house, he raised the cellar door, went down the\nsteps, shut the door down upon himself, groped his way to the inner\nstairs, and so gained the kitchen. He was walking to the cupboard when\nthe door opened and he saw Maud coming toward him.\n\nShe did not seem in the least startled to see him there. In the\nextremity of her terror, it may have seemed to her that he had been\nsent especially to her help. She walked up to him, laid her hands on\nhis shoulders and whispered, \"Oh, Sam, I am so glad to see you. Save\nme! Don't let him touch me! He is in there.\"\n\nSam hardly knew if this were real or not. A wild fancy assailed him for\nan instant--was he killed in jumping from the window? Surely this could\nnever happen to him on the earth; the girl who had always been so cold\nand proud to him was in his arms, her head on his shoulder, her warm\nbreath on his cheek. She was asking his help against some danger.\n\n\"All right, Mattie,\" he whispered. \"Nobody shall hurt you. Who is it?\"\nHe thought of no one but the police.\n\n\"Offitt,\" she said.\n\nHe brushed her aside as if she had been a cobweb in his path, and with\na wild cry of joy and vengeance he burst through the half-open door.\nOffitt turned at the noise, and saw Sam coming, and knew that the end\nof his life was there. His heart was like water within him. He made a\nfeeble effort at defence; but the carpenter, without a word, threw him\non the floor, planted one knee on his chest, and with his bare hands\nmade good the threat he uttered in his agony in the court-room,\ntwisting and breaking his neck.\n\nSleeny rose, pulled the cover from the centre-table in the room, and\nthrew it over the distorted face of the dead man.\n\nMaud, driven out of her wits by the dreadful scene, had sunk in a\nrocking-chair, where, with her face in her hands, she was sobbing and\nmoaning. Sam tried to get her to listen to him.\n\n\"Good-by, Mattie, I shall never see you again, I suppose. I must run\nfor my life. I want you to know I was innocent of what they charged me\nwith----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that, Sam,\" she sobbed.\n\n\"God bless you, Mattie, for saying so. I don't care so much for what\nhappens, now. I am right glad I got here to save you from that----\" he\npaused, searching for a word which would be descriptive and yet not\nimproper in the presence of a lady, but his vocabulary was not rich and\nhe said at last, \"that snide. But I should have done that to him\nanyhow; so don't cry on that account. Mattie, will you tell me\ngood-by?\" he asked with bashful timidity.\n\nShe rose and gave him her hand; but her eyes happening to wander to the\nshapeless form lying in the corner, she hid her face again on his\nshoulder and said with a fresh burst of tears. \"Oh, Sam, stay with me a\nlittle while. Don't leave me alone.\"\n\nHis mind travelled rapidly through the incidents that would result from\nhis staying--prison, trial, and a darker contingency still, rearing its\nhorrible phantom in the distance. But she said, \"You will stay till\nfather comes, won't you?\" and he answered simply:\n\n\"Yes, Mattie, if you want me to.\"\n\nHe led her to a seat and sat down beside her, to wait for his doom.\n\nIn a few minutes, they heard a loud altercation outside the door. The\nvoice of Saul Matchin was vehemently protesting, \"I tell ye he ain't\nhere,\" and another voice responded,\n\n\"He was seen to climb the fence and to enter the house. We've got it\nsurrounded, and there's no use for you to get yourself into trouble\naidin' and abettin'.\"\n\nSam walked to the door and said to the policeman, with grim humor,\n\"Come in! you'll find two murderers here, and neither one will show any\nfight.\"\n\nThe policemen blew their whistles to assemble the rest, and then came\nin warily, and two of them seized him at once.\n\n\"It's all very well to be meek and lowly, my friend,\" said one of them,\n\"but you'll not play that on us twice--least ways,\" he added with\nsarcastic intention, \"not twice the same day. See here, Tony Smart,\"\naddressing a third, who now entered, \"lend a hand with these\nbracelets,\" and in a moment Sam was handcuffed and pinioned.\n\n\"Where's the other one you was talking about?\" asked the policeman.\n\nSam pointed with his foot in the direction where Offitt lay. The\npoliceman lifted the cloth, and dropped it again with a horror which\nhis professional phlegm could not wholly disguise.\n\n\"Well, of all the owdacious villains ever I struck ---- Who do you\nthink it is?\" he asked, turning to his associates.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The witness this afternoon,--Offitt. Well, my man,\" he said, turning\nto Sam, \"you wanted to make a sure thing of it, I see. If you couldn't\nbe hung for one, you would for the other.\"\n\n\"Sam!\" said Saul Matchin who, pale and trembling, had been a silent\nspectator of the scene so far, \"for heaven's sake, tell us what all\nthis means.\"\n\n\"Mind now,\" said the officer, \"whatever you say will be reported.\"\n\n\"Very well, I've got nothing to hide,\" said Sam. \"I'll tell you and\nMother Matchin\" (who had just come in and was staring about her with\nconsternation, questioning Maud in dumb show) \"the whole story. I owe\nthat to you for you've always used me well. It's a mighty short one.\nThat fellow Offitt robbed and tried to murder Captain Farnham last\nnight, and then swore it onto me. I got away from the officers\nto-night, and come round here and found him 'saulting Mattie, and I\ntwisted his neck for him. If it's a hanging matter to kill snakes, I'll\nhave to stand it--that's all.\"\n\n\"Now, who do you think is going to believe that?\" said the captain of\nthe squad.\n\nMaud rose and walked up to where Sam was standing and said, \"I know\nevery word he has said is true. That man was the burglar at Captain\nFarnham's. He told me so himself to-night. He said he had the money in\nhis pocket and wanted to make me go with him.\"\n\nShe spoke firmly and resolutely, but she could not bring herself to say\nanything of previous passages between them; and when she opened her\nlips to speak of the ladder, the woman was too strong within her, and\nshe closed them again. \"I'll never tell that unless they go to hang\nSam, and then I won't tell anybody but the Governor,\" she swore to\nherself.\n\n\"It's easy to see about that story,\" said the officer still\nincredulous.\n\nThey searched the clothing of Offitt, and the face of the officer, as\none package of money after another was brought to light, was a singular\nstudy. The pleasure he felt in the recovery of the stolen goods was\nhardly equal to his professional chagrin at having caught the wrong\nman. He stood for a moment silent, after tying up all the packages in\none.\n\n\"It's no use dodging,\" he said at last. \"We have been barking up the\nwrong tree.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said the one called Tony Smart. \"Who has\nidentified this money? Who can answer for this young lady? How about\nthem marks on the door and the ladder? Anyhow there's enough to hold\nour prisoner on.\"\n\n\"Of course there is,\" said the captain. \"He hadn't authority to go\ntwisting people's necks in this county.\"\n\nAt this moment the wagon which had been sent for arrived. The body of\nOffitt was lifted in. The captain gathered up the money, notified\nMatchin that he and his family would be wanted as witnesses in the\nmorning, and they all moved toward the door. Sam turned to say\n\"Farewell.\" Pinioned as he was, he could not shake hands, and his voice\nfaltered as he took leave of them. Maud's heart was not the most\nfeeling one in the world, but her emotions had been deeply stirred by\nthe swift succession of events; and as she saw this young fellow going\nso bravely to meet an unknown fate, purely for her sake, the tears came\nto her eyes. She put out her hand to him; but she saw that his hands\nwere fastened and, seized with sudden pity, she put her arms about his\nneck and kissed him, whispering, \"Keep up a good heart, Sam!\" and he\nwent away, in all his danger and ignominy happier than he had been for\nmany a day.\n\nThe probabilities of the case were much discussed that night at police\nhead-quarters, in conferences from which the reporters were rigorously\nexcluded, and the next morning the city newspapers revelled in the\nsensation. They vied with each other in inventing attractive head-lines\nand startling theories. The _Bale-Fire_ began its leader with the\nimpressive sentence: \"Has a carnival of crime set in amongst us? Last\nnight the drama of Algonquin Avenue was supplemented by the tragedy of\nDean Street, and the public, aghast, demands 'What next?' A second\nmurder was accomplished by hands yet dripping with a previous crime.\nThe patriotic witness who, yesterday, with a bleeding heart, denounced\nthe criminality of his friend, paid last night with his life for his\nfidelity.\" In another column called for a \"monument, by popular\nsubscription for Andrew Jackson Offitt, who died because would not tell\na lie.\" On the other hand, _The Morning Astral_, representing the\nconservative opinion of the city, called for a suspension of judgment\non the part of its candid readers; said that there were shady\ncircumstances about the antecedents of Offitt, and intimated that\ndocuments of a compromising character had been found on his person;\ncongratulated the city on the improved condition of Captain Farnham;\nand, trusting in the sagacity and diligence of the authorities,\nconfidently awaited from them a solution of the mystery. Each of them,\nnevertheless, gave free space and license to their reporters, and\nOffitt was a saint, a miscreant, a disguised prince, and an escaped\nconvict, according to the state of the reporter's imagination or his\ndigestion; while the stories told of Sleeny varied from cannibalism to\nfeats of herculean goodness. They all agreed reasonably well, however,\nas to the personal appearance of the two men, and from this fact it\ncame about that, in the course of the morning, evidence was brought\nforward, from a totally unexpected quarter, which settled the question\nas to the burglary at Farnham's.\n\nMrs. Belding had been so busy the day before, in her constant\nattendance upon Farnham, that she had paid no attention to the story of\nthe arrest. She had heard that the man had been caught and his crime\nclearly established, and that he had been sent to jail for trial. Her\nfirst thought was, \"I am glad I was not called upon to give evidence.\nIt would have been very disagreeable to get up before a court-room full\nof men and say I looked with an opera-glass out of my daughter's window\ninto a young man's house. I should have to mention Alice's name, too,--\nand a young girl's name cannot be mentioned too seldom in the\nnewspapers. In fact, twice in a life-time is often enough, and one of\nthem should be a funeral notice.\"\n\nBut this morning, after calling at Farnham's and finding that he was\ngetting on comfortably, she sat down to read the newspapers. Alice was\nsitting near her, with hands and lap full of some feminine handiwork. A\nhappy smile played about her lips, for her mother had just repeated to\nher the surgeon's prediction that Captain Farnham would be well in a\nweek or two. \"He said the scalp wound was healing 'by the first\nintention,' which I thought was a funny phrase. I thought the maxim was\nthat second thoughts were best.\" Alice had never mentioned Farnham's\nname since the first night, but he was rarely out of her mind, and the\nthought that his life was saved made every hour bright and festal. \"He\nwill be well,\" she thought. \"He will have to come here to thank mamma\nfor her care of him. I shall see him again and he shall not complain of\nme. If he should never speak to me again, I shall love him and be good\nto him always.\" She was yet too young and too innocent to know how\nimpossible was the scheme of life she was proposing to herself, but she\nwas thoroughly happy in it.\n\nMrs. Belding, as she read, grew perplexed and troubled. She threw down\none newspaper and took up another, but evidently got no more comfort\nout of that. At last she sighed and said, \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I shall\nhave to go down there after all. They have got the wrong man!\"\n\nAlice looked up with wondering eyes.\n\n\"These accounts all agree that the assassin is a tall, powerful young\nman, with yellow hair and beard. The real man was not more than medium\nheight, very dark. Why, he was black and shiny as a cricket. I must go\nand tell them. I wonder who the lawyer is that does the indicting of\npeople?\"\n\n\"It must be the prosecuting attorney, Mr. Dalton,\" said Alice. \"I heard\nhe was elected this spring. You know him very well. You meet him\neverywhere.\"\n\n\"That elegant young fellow who leads germans? Well, if that is not too\nabsurd! I never should have thought of him, outside of a dress-coat. I\ndon't mind a bit going to see _him_. Order the carriage, while I get my\nthings on.\"\n\nShe drove down to the City Hall, and greatly astonished Mr. Dalton by\nwalking into his office and requesting a moment's private conversation\nwith him. Dalton was a dapper young man, exceedingly glib and well\ndressed, making his way in political and official, as he had already\nmade it in social life. He greeted Mrs. Belding with effusion, and was\nanxious to know how he might serve her, having first cleared the room\nof the half-dozen politicians who did their lounging there.\n\n\"It is a most delicate matter for a lady to appear in, and I must ask\nyou to keep my name as much in reserve as possible.\"\n\n\"Of course, you may count upon me,\" he answered, wondering where this\nstrange exordium would lead to.\n\n\"You have got the wrong man. I am sure of it. It was not the blonde\none. He was black as a cricket. I saw him as plainly as I see you. You\nknow we live next door to Captain Farnham----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Dalton cried. \"Certainly. I understand. This is most important.\nPray go on.\"\n\nWith a few interruptions from him, full of tact and intelligence, she\ntold the whole story, or as much of it as was required. She did not\nhave to mention Alice's name, or the opera-glass; though the clever\nyoung man said to himself, \"She is either growing very far-sighted, or\nshe was scouring the heavens with a field-glass that night--perhaps\nlooking for comets.\"\n\nHe rang his bell and gave a message to an usher who appeared. \"I will\nnot ask you to wait long,\" he said, and turned the conversation upon\nthe weather and social prospects for the season. In a few minutes the\ndoor opened, and Sleeny was brought into the room by an officer.\n\n\"Was this the man you saw, Mrs. Belding?\" asked Dalton.\n\n\"Not the slightest resemblance. This one is much taller, and entirely\ndifferent in color.\"\n\n\"That will do\"; and Sleeny and the officer went out.\n\n\"Now may I ask you to do a very disagreeable thing? To go with me to\nthe Morgue and see the remains of what I am now sure is the real\ncriminal?\" Dalton asked.\n\n\"Oh, mercy! I would rather not. Is it necessary?\"\n\n\"Not positively necessary, but it will enable me to dismiss the\nburglary case absolutely against young Sleeny.\"\n\n\"Very well. I'll go. I am so glad,\" she said to herself, \"that I did\nnot bring Alice.\"\n\nThey went in her carriage to the Morgue. Dalton said, \"I want to make\nit as easy as I can for you. Please wait a moment in your carriage.\" He\nwent in and arranged that the face of Offitt, which was horrible,\nshould be turned away as much as possible; the head, and shoulders and\nback being left exposed, and the hat placed on the head. He then\nbrought Mrs. Belding in.\n\n\"That is the man,\" she said, promptly, \"or at least some one exactly\nlike him.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, reconducting her to her carriage. \"The first\ncharge against Sleeny will be dismissed, though of course he must be\nheld for this homicide.\"\n\n\nA few weeks later Sleeny was tried for the killing of Offitt, on which\noccasion most of the facts of this history were given in evidence. Mrs.\nBelding had at last to tell what she knew in open court, and she had an\nevil quarter of an hour in the hands of Mr. Dalton, who seemed always\non the point of asking some question which would bring her opera-glass\ninto the newspapers; but he never proceeded to that extremity, and she\ncame away with a better opinion of the profession than she had ever\nbefore entertained. \"I suppose leading germans humanizes even a lawyer\nsomewhat,\" she observed, philosophically.\n\nMaud Matchin was, however, the most important witness for the defence.\nShe went upon the stand troubled with no abstract principles in regard\nto the administration of justice. She wanted Sam Sleeny to be set free,\nand she testified with an eye single to that purpose. She was perhaps a\ntrifle too zealous--even the attorney for the defence bit his lip\noccasionally at her dashing introduction of wholly irrelevant matter in\nSleeny's favor. But she was throughout true to herself also, and never\ngave the least intimation that Offitt had any right to consider himself\na favored suitor. Perhaps she had attained the talent, so common in\nmore sophisticated circles than any with which she was familiar, of\nforgetting all entanglements which it is not convenient to remember,\nand of facing a discarded lover with a visage of insolent unconcern and\na heart unstirred by a memory.\n\nThe result of it all was, of course, that Sleeny was acquitted, though\nit came about in a way which may be worth recording. The jury found a\nverdict of \"justifiable homicide,\" upon which the judge very properly\nsent them back to their room, as the verdict was flatly against the law\nand the evidence. They retired again, with stolid and unabashed\npatience, and soon reappeared with a verdict of acquittal, on the\nground of \"emotional insanity.\" But this remarkable jury determined to\ndo nothing by halves, and fearing that the reputation of being queer\nmight injure Sam in his business prospects, added to their verdict\nthese thoughtful and considerate words, which yet remain on the record,\nto the lasting honor and glory of our system of trial by jury:\n\n\"And we hereby state that the prisoner was perfectly sane up to the\nmoment he committed the rash act in question, and perfectly sane the\nmoment after, and that, in our opinion, there is no probability that\nthe malady will ever recur.\"\n\nAfter this memorable deliverance, Sam shook hands cordially and gravely\nwith each of the judicious jurymen, and then turned to where Maud was\nwaiting for him, with a rosy and happy face and a sparkling eye. They\nwalked slowly homeward together through the falling shadows.\n\nTheir lives were henceforth bound together for good or evil. We may not\nsay how much of good or how much of evil was to be expected from a\nwedlock between two natures so ill-regulated and untrained, where the\nwoman brought into the partnership the wreck of ignoble ambitions and\nthe man the memory of a crime.\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\n\"NOW DO YOU REMEMBER?\"\n\n\nFarnham's convalescence was rapid. When the first danger of fever was\nover, the wound on the head healed quickly, and one morning Mrs.\nBelding came home with the news that he was to drive out that\nafternoon. Alice sat in the shade by the front porch for an hour,\nwaiting to see him pass, and when at last his carriage appeared, she\nrose and waved her handkerchief by way of greeting and congratulation.\nHe bowed as he went by, and Alice retired to her own room, where she\nused her handkerchief once more to dry her wet and happy eyes.\n\nIt was not long after, that Farnham came to dine with them. They both\nlooked forward to this dinner as an occasion of very considerable\nimportance. Each felt that much depended upon the demeanor of the\nother. Each was conscientiously resolved to do and to say nothing which\nshould pain or embarrass the other. Each was dying to fall into the\nother's arms, but each only succeeded in convincing the other of his or\nher entire indifference and friendship.\n\nAs Farnham came in, Mrs. Belding went up to him with simple kindliness,\nkissed him, and made him sit down. \"You dear boy,\" she said, \"you do\nnot know how glad I am to see you here once more.\"\n\nAlice looked on, almost jealous of her mother's privilege. Then she\nadvanced with shy grace and took Arthur's hand, and asked: \"Do you\nbegin to feel quite strong again?\"\n\nFarnham smiled, and answered, \"Quite well, and the strength will soon\ncome. The first symptom of returning vitality, Mrs. Belding, was my\nhostility to gruel and other phantom dishes. I have deliberately come\nto dinner to-day to dine.\"\n\n\"I am delighted to hear of your appetite,\" said Mrs. Belding; \"but I\nthink you may bear a little watching at the table yet,\" she added, in a\ntone of kindly menace. She was as good as her word, and exercised\nrather a stricter discipline at dinner than was agreeable to the\nconvalescent, regulating his meat and wine according to ladylike ideas,\nwhich are somewhat binding on carnivorous man. But she was so kindly\nabout it, and Alice aided and abetted with such bashful prettiness,\nthat Farnham felt he could endure starvation with such accessories. Yet\nhe was not wholly at ease. He had hoped, in the long hours of his\nconfinement, to find the lady of his love kinder in voice and manner\nthan when he saw her last; and now, when she was sweeter and more\ntender than he had ever seen her before, the self-tormenting mind of\nthe lover began to suggest that if she loved him she would not be so\nkind. He listened to the soft, caressing tones of her voice as she\nspoke to him, which seemed to convey a blessing in every syllable; he\nmet the wide, clear beauty of her glance, so sweet and bright that his\nown eyes could hardly support it; he saw the ready smile that came to\nthe full, delicate mouth whenever he spoke; and instead of being made\nhappy by all this, he asked himself if it could mean anything except\nthat she was sorry for him, and wanted to be very polite to him, as she\ncould be nothing more. His heart sank within him at the thought; he\nbecame silent and constrained; and Alice wondered whether she had not\ngone too far in her resolute kindness. \"Perhaps he has changed his\nmind,\" she thought, \"and wishes me not to change mine.\" So these two\npeople, whose hands and hearts were aching to come together, sat in the\nsame drawing-room talking of commonplace things, while their spirits\ngrew heavy as lead.\n\nMrs. Belding was herself conscious of a certain constraint, and to\ndispel it asked Alice to sing, and Farnham adding his entreaties, she\nwent to the piano, and said, as all girls say, \"What shall I sing?\"\n\nShe looked toward Farnham, but the mother answered, \"Sing\n'Douglas'----\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mamma, not that.\"\n\n\"Why not? You were singing it last night. I like it better than any\nother of your songs.\"\n\n\"I do not want to sing it to-night.\"\n\nMrs. Belding persisted, until at last Alice said, with an odd\nexpression of recklessness, \"Oh, very well, if you must have it, I will\nsing it. But I hate these sentimental songs, that say so much and mean\nnothing.\" Striking the chords nervously she sang, with a voice at first\ntremulous but at last full of strong and deep feeling, that wail of\nhopeless love and sorrow:\n\n   \"Could you come back to me, Douglas, Douglas,\n     In the old likeness that I knew,\n   I would be so faithful, so loving,\n     Douglas, Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.\"\n\nThere had been tears of vexation in her eyes when her mother had forced\nher to sing this song of all others; but after she had begun, the music\ntook her own heart by storm, and she sang as she had never sung\nbefore--no longer fearing, but hoping that the cry of her heart might\nreach her lover and tell him of her love. Farnham listened in transport;\nhe had never until now heard her sing, and her beautiful voice seemed to\nhim to complete the circle of her loveliness. He was so entranced by\nthe full rich volume of her voice, and by the rapt beauty of her face\nas she sang, that he did not at first think of the words; but the\nsignificance of them seized him at last, and the thought that she was\nsinging these words to him ran like fire through his veins. For a\nmoment he gave himself up to the delicious consciousness that their\nsouls were floating together upon that tide of melody. As the song died\naway and closed with a few muffled chords, he was on the point of\nthrowing himself at her feet, and getting the prize which was waiting\nfor him. But he suddenly bethought himself that she had sung the song\nunwillingly and had taken care to say that the words meant nothing. He\nrose and thanked her for the music, complimented her singing warmly,\nand bidding both ladies good night, went home, thrilled through and\nthrough with a deeper emotion than he had yet known, but painfully\npuzzled and perplexed.\n\nHe sat for a long time in his library, trying to bring some order into\nhis thoughts. He could not help feeling that his presence was an\nembarrassment and a care to Alice Belding. It was evident that she had\na great friendship and regard for him, which he had troubled and\ndisturbed by his ill-timed declaration. She could no longer be easy and\nnatural with him; he ought not to stay to be an annoyance to her. It\nwas also clear that he could not be himself in her presence; she\nexercised too powerful an influence upon him to make it possible that\nhe could go in and out of the house as a mere friend of the family. He\nwas thus driven to the thought which always lay so near to the surface\nwith him, as with so many of his kind; he would exile himself for a\nyear or two, and take himself out of her way. The thought gave him no\ncontent. He could not escape a keen pang of jealousy when he thought of\nleaving her in her beautiful youth to the society of men who were so\nclearly inferior to her.\n\n\"I am inferior to her myself,\" he thought with genuine humility; \"but I\nfeel sure I can appreciate her better than any one else she will ever\nbe likely to meet.\"\n\nBy and by he became aware that something was perplexing him, which was\nfloating somewhere below the surface of his consciousness. A thousand\nthoughts, more or less puzzling, had arisen and been disposed of during\nthe hour that had elapsed since he left Mrs. Belding's. But still he\nbegan to be sure that there was one groping for recognition which as\nyet he had not recognized. The more ho dwelt upon it, the more it\nseemed to attach itself to the song Alice had sung, but he could not\ngive it any definiteness. After he had gone to bed, this undefined\nimpression of something significant attaching itself to the song\nbesieged him, and worried him with tantalizing glimpses, until he went\nto sleep.\n\nBut Farnham was not a dreamer, and the morning, if it brought little\ncomfort, brought at least decision. He made up his mind while dressing\nthat he would sail by an early steamer for Japan. He sent a telegram to\nSan Francisco, as soon as he had breakfasted, to inquire about\naccommodations, and busied himself during the day with arranging odds\nand ends of his affairs. Coming and going was easy to him, as he rarely\nspeculated and never touched anything involving anxious risks. But in\nthe afternoon an irresistible longing impelled him to the house of his\nneighbor.\n\n\"Why should I not allow myself this indulgence?\" he thought. \"It will\nbe only civil to go over there and announce my departure. As all is\nover, I may at least take this last delight to my eyes and heart. And I\nwant to hear that song again.\"\n\nAll day the song had been haunting him, not on account of anything in\nitself, but because it vaguely reminded him of something else--\nsomething of infinite importance, if he could only grasp it. It hung\nabout him so persistently, this vague glimmer of suggestion, that he\nbecame annoyed, and said at last to himself, \"It is time for me to be\nchanging my climate, if a ballad can play like that on my nerves.\"\n\nHe seized his hat and walked rapidly across the lawn, with the zest of\nair and motion natural to a strong man in convalescence. The pretty\nmaidservant smiled and bowed him into the cool, dim drawing-room, where\nAlice was seated at the piano. She rose and said instinctively to the\nservant, \"Tell mamma Captain Farnham is here,\" and immediately repented\nas she saw his brow darken a little. He sat down beside her, and said:\n\n\"I come on a twofold errand. I want to say good-by to you, and I want\nyou to sing 'Douglas' for me once more.\"\n\n\"Why, where are you going?\" she said, with a look of surprise and\nalarm.\n\n\"To Japan.\"\n\n\"But not at once, surely?\"\n\n\"The first steamer I can find.\"\n\nAlice tried to smile, but the attempt was a little woful.\n\n\"It will be a delightful journey, I am sure,\" she faltered, \"but I\ncan't get used to the idea of it, all at once. It is the end of the\nworld.\"\n\n\"I want to get there before the end comes. At the present rate of\nprogress there is not more than a year's purchase of bric-a-brac left\nin the empire. I must hurry over and get my share. What can I do for\nyou?\" he continued, seeing that she sat silent, twisting her white\nfingers together. \"Shall I not bring you the loot of a temple or two?\nThey say the priests have become very corruptible since our\nmissionaries got there--the false religion tumbling all to pieces\nbefore the true.\"\n\nStill she made no answer, and the fixed smile on her face looked as if\nshe hardly heard what he was saying. But he went on in the same light,\nbantering tone.\n\n\"Shall I bring you back a Jinrickishaw?\"\n\n\"What in the world is that--but, no matter what it is--tell me, are you\nreally going so soon?\"\n\nIf Farnham had not been the most modest of men, the tone in which this\nquestion was asked would have taught him that he need not exile\nhimself. But he answered seriously:\n\n\"Yes, I am really going.\"\n\n\"But why?\" The question came from unwilling lips, but it would have its\nway. The challenge was more than Farnham could endure. He spoke out\nwith quick and passionate earnestness:\n\n\"Must I tell you then? Do you not know? I am going because you send\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she murmured, with flaming cheeks and downcast eyes.\n\n\"I am going because I love you, and I cannot bear to see you day by\nday, and know that you are not for me. You are too young and too good\nto understand what I feel. If I were a saint like you, perhaps I might\nrejoice in your beauty and your grace without any selfish wish--but I\ncannot. If you are not to be mine, I cannot enjoy your presence. Every\ncharm you have is an added injury, if I am to be indifferent to you.\"\n\nHer hands flew up and covered her eyes. She was so happy that she\nfeared he would see it and claim her too soon and too swiftly.\n\nHe mistook the gesture, and went on in his error.\n\n\"There! I have made you angry, or wounded you again. It would be so\ncontinually, if I should stay. I should be giving you offence every\nhour in the day. I cannot help loving you, any more than I can help\nbreathing. This is nothing to you or worse than nothing, but it is all\nmy life to me. I do not know how it will end. You have filled every\nthought of my mind, every vein of my body. I am more you than myself.\nHow can I separate myself from you?\"\n\nAs he poured out these words, and much more, hot as a flood of molten\nmetal, Alice slowly recovered her composure. She was absolutely and\ntranquilly happy--so perfectly at rest that she hardly cared for the\npain her lover was confessing. She felt she could compensate him for\neverything, and every word he said filled her with a delight which she\ncould not bear to lose by replying. She sat listening to him with\nhalf-shut eyes, determined not to answer until he had made an end of\nspeaking. But she said to herself, with a tenderness which made her\nheart beat more than her lover's words, \"How surprised he will be when\nI tell him he shall not go.\"\n\nThe rustling of Mrs. Belding's ample approach broke in upon her trance\nand Farnham's litany. He rose, not without some confusion, to greet\nher, and Alice, with bright and even playful eyes, said, \"Mamma, what\ndo you think this errant young cavalier has come to say to us?\"\n\nMrs. Belding looked with puzzled inquiry from one to the other.\n\n\"Simply,\" continued Alice, \"that he is off for Japan in a day or two,\nand he wants to know if we have any commissions for him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Arthur, I won't listen to it. Come over to dinner this\nevening and tell me all about it. I've got an appointment this very\nminute at our Oriental Gospel rooms and cannot wait to talk to you now.\nBut this evening, you must tell me what it all means, and I hope you\nwill have changed your mind by that time.\"\n\nThe good lady did not even sit down, but rustled briskly away. Perhaps\nshe divined more of what was toward than appeared--but she did as she\nwould have wished to be done by, when she was young, and left the young\npeople to their own devices.\n\nFarnham turned to Alice, who was still standing, and said, \"Alice, my\nown love, can you not give me one word of hope to carry with me? I\ncannot forget you. My mind cannot change. Perhaps yours may, when the\nocean is between us, and you have time to reflect on what I have said.\nI spoke too soon and too rashly. But I will make amends for that by\nlong silence. Then perhaps you will forgive me--perhaps you will recall\nme. I will obey your call from the end of the world.\"\n\nHe held out his hand to her. She gave him hers with a firm warm grasp.\nHe might have taken courage from this, but her composure and her\ninscrutable smile daunted him.\n\n\"You are not going yet,\" she said. \"You have forgotten what you came\nfor.\"\n\n\"Yes--that song. I must hear it again. You must not think I am growing\ndaft, but that song has haunted me all day in the strangest way. There\nis something in the way _you_ sing it--the words and your voice\ntogether--that recall some association too faint for me to grasp. I can\nneither remember what it is, nor forget it. I have tried to get it out\nof my mind, but I have an odd impression that I would better cherish\nit--that it is important to me--that life or death are not more\nimportant. There! I have confessed all my weakness to you, and now you\nwill say that I need a few weeks of salt breeze.\"\n\n\"I will sing you the song first. Perhaps we may pluck out its mystery.\"\n\nShe preluded a moment and sang, while Farnham waited with a strained\nsense of expectancy, as if something unspeakably serious was impending.\nShe sang with far more force and feeling than the night before. Her\nheart was full of her happy love, as yet unspoken, and her fancy was\npleased with that thought that, under the safe cover of her music, she\ncould declare her love without restraint. She sang with the innocent\nrapture of a mavis in spring, in notes as rich and ardent as her own\nmaiden dreams. Farnham listened with a pleasure so keen that it\nbordered upon pain. When she came to the line,\n\n   \"I would be so tender, so loving, Douglas,\"\n\nhe started and leaned forward in his chair, holding his hands to his\ntemples, and cried,\n\n\"Can't you help me to think what that reminds me of?\"\n\nAlice rose from the piano, flushing a pink as sweet and delicate as\nthat of the roses in her belt. She came forward a few paces and then\nstopped, bent slightly toward him, with folded hands. In her long,\nwhite, clinging drapery, with her gold hair making the dim room bright,\nwith her red lips parted in a tender but solemn smile, with something\nlike a halo about her of youth and purity and ardor, she was a sight so\nbeautiful that Arthur Farnham as he gazed up at her felt his heart grow\nheavy with an aching consciousness of her perfection that seemed to\nremove her forever from his reach. But the thought that was setting her\npulses to beating was as sweetly human as that of any bride since Eve.\nShe was saying to herself in the instant she stood motionless before\nhim, looking like a pictured angel, \"I know now what he means. He loves\nme. I am sure of him. I have a right to give myself to him.\"\n\nShe held out her hands. He sprang up and seized them.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, \"I know what you are trying to remember, and I will\nmake you remember it.\"\n\nHe was not greatly surprised, for love is a dream, and dreams have\ntheir own probabilities. She led him to a sofa and seated him beside\nher. She put her arms around his neck and pressed his head to her\nbeating heart, and said in a voice as soft as a mother's to an ailing\nchild, \"My beloved, if you will live, I will be so good to you.\" She\nkissed him and said gently,\n\n\"Now do you remember?\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\n\n\nHarper's\nPopular 12mo series\n\nCloth, Ornamental, 75 Cents Each\n\nWith Frontispiece Portraits of Authors\n\nTHE HOUSE-BOAT ON THE STYX.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":546,"split":"train"}
