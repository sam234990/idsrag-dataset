{"ori_id":"cd282be1ad0f0215565df1809daa573f90381eb4","title":"Virginia (novel)","context":"Virginia (novel)\n Born in 1864 to a clergyman and his dutiful wife, Virginia grows up as a Southern belle in the town of Dinwiddie, Virginia. Her education is strictly limited to the bare minimum, with anything that might disturb her quiet and comfortable existence vigorously avoided. Thus prepared for life, Virginia falls for the first handsome young man who crosses her path\u2014Oliver Treadwell, the black sheep of a family of capitalist entrepreneurs who, during the time of Reconstruction, brought industry and the railroad to the South. Oliver, who has been abroad and has only recently arrived in Dinwiddie, is a dreamer and an intellectual. An aspiring playwright, his literary ambitions are more important to him than money, and he refuses his uncle's offer to work in his bank. However, when Virginia falls in love with him he realizes that he must be able to support a family, and eventually accepts his uncle's offer to work for the railroad.\nThe young couple get married and have three children, a boy and two girls. Gradually perfecting her household skills, Virginia is able to get by on very little money. When, after many years, Oliver's first play is put on the stage in New York City, his expectations are high. However, the show is a complete failure as the play is far too intellectual and radical for a Broadway audience who wants to be entertained rather than reformed. Reading about the flop in the local newspaper, Virginia for the first time in her life leaves her children, asking her mother to take care of them for a day or two, and takes the night train to New York to be with, and console, her husband\u2014only to be rejected by him, who is in a state of severe depression. When he has recovered from the shock, Oliver makes yet another concession to society and public taste and starts writing \"trash\".\nThroughout the years, Virginia leads a vicarious life: She is happy when her husband and children are happy; she makes sure their clothes are in perfect condition while neglecting her own outward appearance; and she is eager to provide for her children the education she herself has been denied. When, at one point, she realizes that the women her age whom she has known since childhood still look quite young while she has aged prematurely, she quickly persuades herself to believe that a life of altruistic subservience is more than worthwhile, that living and acting the way she does is her duty and God's will. Her father's sudden if honourable death\u2014he unsuccessfully tries to prevent the lynching of an innocent young African American and is stabbed in the process by an angry and drunken young man\u2014adds to the gloom that starts creeping into her life, especially when she sees that, as a widow, her mother suddenly loses all her will to live. When she dies only a few months after her husband, Virginia has a premonition that her own fate when losing Oliver could be a similar one.\nMeanwhile, Oliver's first successful play\u2014a trashy one\u2014premi\u00e8res in New York, with some more to follow in quick succession, and, as the money keeps pouring in, the family move into a bigger house in Dinwiddie. They now employ a number of servants, including an African American butler. With the children gone\u2014their son and one daughter are at college, while the other daughter has married a much older widower with two grown-up children and has also flown the nest\u2014and Oliver frequently in New York to supervise the staging of his plays, Virginia's life becomes increasingly empty. Having \"outlived her usefulness\", the days seem endless to her, and with all the servants about the house there is absolutely no housework for her to do either. Now in her mid-forties, Virginia for the first time in her life spends Christmas alone at home.\nThe biggest blow, however, is yet to come: When she accompanies Oliver to New York for a premi\u00e8re, she finds out to her dismay that he has been betraying her with a famous actress who stars in one of his plays. For the last time summoning up all her courage, she takes a taxi and pays her an unexpected call but immediately realizes when talking to her that she has no chance of winning her husband back. Without many words, Oliver asks her to let him divorce her, but clinging to the only thing she has left in her life\u2014her marriage\u2014she refuses. The novel ends on a somewhat optimistic note when Virginia, again alone in the empty house in Dinwiddie, receives a letter from her son telling her that he is going to leave Oxford before he has completed his two-year course at the university in order to come back and stay with his mother.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Virginia, by Ellen Glasgow\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The\nday had been hot, and the fitful wind, which had risen in the direction\nof the river, was just beginning to blow in soft gusts under the old\nmulberry trees in the street, and to scatter the loosened petals of\nsyringa blossoms in a flowery snow over the grass. For a moment Miss\nPriscilla turned her flushed face to the scented air, while her eyes\nrested lovingly on the narrow walk, edged with pointed bricks and\nbordered by cowslips and wallflowers, which led through the short garden\nto the three stone steps and the tall iron gate. She was a shapeless yet\nmajestic woman of some fifty years, with a large mottled face in which a\nsteadfast expression of gentle obstinacy appeared to underly the more\nevanescent ripples of thought or of emotion. Her severe black silk gown,\nto which she had just changed from her morning dress of alpaca, was\nsoftened under her full double chin by a knot of lace and a cameo brooch\nbearing the helmeted profile of Pallas Athene. On her head she wore a\nthree-cornered cap trimmed with a ruching of organdie, and beneath it\nher thin gray hair still showed a gleam of faded yellow in the sunlight.\nShe had never been handsome, but her prodigious size had endowed her\nwith an impressiveness which had passed in her youth, and among an\nindulgent people, for beauty. Only in the last few years had her\nfleshiness, due to rich food which she could not resist and to lack of\nexercise for which she had an instinctive aversion, begun seriously to\ninconvenience her.\n\nBeyond the wire cage, in which the canary spent his involuntarily\ncelibate life, an ancient microphylla rose-bush, with a single imperfect\nbud blooming ahead of summer amid its glossy foliage, clambered over a\ngreen lattice to the gabled pediment of the porch, while the delicate\nshadows of the leaves rippled like lace-work on the gravel below. In the\nminiature garden, where the small spring blossoms strayed from the prim\nbeds into the long feathery grasses, there were syringa bushes, a little\noverblown; crape-myrtles not yet in bud; a holly tree veiled in bright\ngreen near the iron fence; a flowering almond shrub in late bloom\nagainst the shaded side of the house; and where a west wing put out on\nthe left, a bower of red and white roses was steeped now in the faint\nsunshine. At the foot of the three steps ran the sunken moss-edged\nbricks of High Street, and across High Street there floated, like\nwind-blown flowers, the figures of Susan Treadwell and Virginia\nPendleton.\n\nOpening the rusty gate, the two girls tripped with carefully held\nflounces up the stone steps and between the cowslips and wallflowers\nthat bordered the walk. Their white lawn dresses were made with the\nclose-fitting sleeves and the narrow waists of the period, and their\nelaborately draped overskirts were looped on the left with graduated\nbows of light blue ottoman ribbon. They wore no hats, and Virginia, who\nwas the shorter of the two, had fastened a Jacqueminot rose in the thick\ndark braid which was wound in a wreath about her head. Above her arched\nblack eyebrows, which lent an expression of surprise and animation to\nher vivid oval face, her hair was parted, after an earlier fashion,\nunder its plaited crown, and allowed to break in a mist of little curls\nover her temples. Even in repose there was a joyousness in her look\nwhich seemed less the effect of an inward gaiety of mind than of some\nhappy outward accident of form and colour. Her eyes, very far apart and\nset in black lashes, were of a deep soft blue--the blue of wild\nhyacinths after rain. By her eyes, and by an old-world charm of\npersonality which she exhaled like a perfume, it was easy to discern\nthat she embodied the feminine ideal of the ages. To look at her was to\nthink inevitably of love. For that end, obedient to the powers of Life,\nthe centuries had formed and coloured her, as they had formed and\ncoloured the wild rose with its whorl of delicate petals. The air of a\nspoiled beauty which rested not ungracefully upon her was sweetened by\nher expression of natural simplicity and goodness.\n\nFor an instant she stood listening in silence to the querulous pipes of\nthe bird and the earnest exhortations of the teacher on the joys of cage\nlife for both bird and lady. Then plucking the solitary early bud from\nthe microphylla rose-bush, she tossed it over the railing of the porch\non the large and placid bosom of Miss Priscilla.\n\n\"Do leave Dicky alone for a minute!\" she called in a winning soprano\nvoice.\n\nAt the sound, Miss Priscilla dropped the bit of cake she held, and\nturned to lean delightedly over the walk, while her face beamed like a\nbeneficent moon through the shining cloud of rose-leaves.\n\n\"Why, Jinny, I hadn't any idea that you and Susan were there!\"\n\nHer smile included Virginia's companion, a tall, rather heavy girl, with\nintelligent grey eyes and fair hair cut in a straight fringe across her\nforehead. She was the daughter of Cyrus Treadwell, the wealthiest and\ntherefore the most prominent citizen of the town, and she was also as\nintellectual as the early eighties and the twenty-one thousand\ninhabitants of Dinwiddie permitted a woman to be. Her friendship for\nVirginia had been one of those swift and absorbing emotions which come\nto women in their school-days. The stronger of the two, she dominated\nthe other, as she dominated every person or situation in life, not by\ncharm, but by the force of an energetic and capable mind. Though her\ndress matched Virginia's in every detail, from the soft folds of tulle\nat the neck to the fancy striped stockings under the _bouffant_\ndraperies, the different shapes of the wearers gave to the one gown an\nair of decorous composure and to the other a quaint and appealing grace.\nFlushed, ardent, expectant, both girls stood now at the beginning of\nwomanhood. Life was theirs; it belonged to them, this veiled, radiant\nthing that was approaching. Nothing wonderful had come as yet--but\nto-morrow, the day after, or next year, the miracle would happen, and\neverything would be different! Experience floated in a luminous mystery\nbefore them. The unknown, which had borrowed the sweetness and the\ncolour of their illusions, possessed them like a secret ecstasy and\nshone, in spite of their shyness, in their startled and joyous look.\n\n\"Father asked me to take a message over to General Goode,\" explained\nVirginia, with a little laugh as gay as the song of a bird, \"but I\ncouldn't go by without thanking you for the cherry bounce. I made mother\ndrink some of it before dinner, and it almost gave her an appetite.\"\n\n\"I knew it was what she needed,\" answered Miss Priscilla, showing her\npleasure by an increasing beam. \"It was made right here in the house,\nand there's nothing better in the world, my poor mother used to say, to\nkeep you from running down in the spring. But why can't you and Susan\ncome in and sit a while?\"\n\n\"We'll be straight back in a minute,\" replied Susan before Virginia\ncould answer. \"I've got a piece of news I want to tell you before any\none else does. Oliver came home last night.\"\n\n\"Oliver?\" repeated Miss Priscilla, a little perplexed. \"You don't mean\nthe son of your uncle Henry, who went out to Australia? I thought your\nfather had washed his hands of him because he had started play-acting or\nsomething?\" Curiosity, that devouring passion of the middle-aged, worked\nin her breast, and her placid face grew almost intense in expression.\n\n\"Yes, that's the one,\" replied Susan. \"They went to Australia when\nOliver was ten years old, and he's now twenty-two. He lost both his\nparents about three years ago,\" she added.\n\n\"I know. His mother was my cousin,\" returned Miss Priscilla. \"I lost\nsight of her after she left Dinwiddie, but somebody was telling me the\nother day that Henry's investments all turned out badly and they came\ndown to real poverty. Sarah Jane was a pretty girl and I was always very\nfond of her, but she was one of the improvident sort that couldn't make\ntwo ends meet without tying them into a bow-knot.\"\n\n\"Then Oliver must be just like her. After his mother's death he went to\nGermany to study, and he gave away the little money he had to some\nstudent he found starving there in a garret.\"\n\n\"That was generous,\" commented Miss Priscilla thoughtfully, \"but I\nshould hardly call it sensible. I hope some day, Jinny, that your father\nwill tell us in a sermon whether there is biblical sanction for\nimmoderate generosity or not.\"\n\n\"But what does he say?\" asked Virginia softly, meaning not the rector,\nbut the immoderate young man.\n\n\"Oh, Oliver says that there wasn't enough for both and that the other\nstudent is worth more to the world than he is,\" answered Susan. \"Then,\nof course, when he got so poor that he had to pawn his clothes or\nstarve, he wrote father an almost condescending letter and said that as\nmuch as he hated business, he supposed he'd have to come back and go to\nwork. 'Only,' he added, 'for God's sake, don't make it tobacco!' Wasn't\nthat dreadful?\"\n\n\"It was extremely impertinent,\" replied Miss Priscilla sternly, \"and to\nCyrus of all persons! I am surprised that he allowed him to come into\nthe house.\"\n\n\"Oh, father doesn't take any of his talk seriously. He calls it\n'starvation foolishness,' and says that Oliver will get over it as soon\nas he has a nice little bank account. Perhaps he will--he is only\ntwenty-two, you know--but just now his head is full of all kinds of new\nideas he picked up somewhere abroad. He's as clever as he can be,\nthere's no doubt of that, and he'd be really good-looking, too, if he\ndidn't have the crooked nose of the Treadwells. Virginia has seen him\nonly once in the street, but she's more than half in love with him\nalready.\"\n\n\"Do come, Susan!\" remonstrated Virginia, blushing as red as the rose in\nher hair. \"It's past six o'clock and the General will have gone if we\ndon't hurry.\" And turning away from the porch, she ran between the\nflowering syringa bushes down the path to the gate.\n\nHaving lost his bit of cake, the bird began to pipe shrilly, while Miss\nPriscilla drew a straight wicker chair (she never used rockers) beside\nthe cage, and, stretching out her feet in their large cloth shoes with\nelastic sides, counted the stitches in an afghan she was knitting in\nnarrow blue and orange strips. In front of her, the street trailed\nbetween cool, dim houses which were filled with quiet, and from the hall\nat her back there came a whispering sound as the breeze moved like a\nghostly footstep through an alcove window. With that strange power of\nreflecting the variable moods of humanity which one sometimes finds in\ninanimate objects, the face of the old house had borrowed from the face\nof its mistress the look of cheerful fortitude with which her generation\nhad survived the agony of defeat and the humiliation of reconstruction.\nAfter nineteen years, the Academy still bore the scars of war on its\nbattered front. Once it had watched the spectre of famine stalk over the\ngrass-grown pavement, and had heard the rattle of musketry and the roar\nof cannon borne on the southern breeze that now wafted the sounds of the\nsaw and the hammer from an adjacent street. Once it had seen the flight\nof refugees, the overflow of the wounded from hospitals and churches,\nthe panic of liberated slaves, the steady conquering march of the army\nof invasion. And though it would never have occurred to Miss Priscilla\nthat either she or her house had borne any relation to history (which\nshe regarded strictly as a branch of study and visualized as a list of\ndates or as a king wearing his crown), she had, in fact, played a modest\nyet effective part in the rapidly changing civilization of her age. But\nevents were powerless against the genial heroism in which she was\narmoured, and it was characteristic of her, as well as of her race,\nthat, while she sat now in the midst of encircling battlefields, with\nher eyes on the walk over which she had seen the blood of the wounded\ndrip when they were lifted into her door, she should be brooding not\nover the tremendous tragedies through which she had passed, but over the\nlesson in physical geography she must teach in the morning. Her lips\nmoved gently, and a listener, had there been one, might have heard her\nmurmur: \"The four great alluvial plains of Asia--those of China and of\nthe Amoo Daria in temperate regions; of the Euphrates and Tigris in the\nwarm temperate; of the Indus and Ganges under the Tropic--with the Nile\nvalley in Africa, were the theatres of the most ancient civilizations\nknown to history or tradition----\"\n\nAs she ended, a sigh escaped her, for the instruction of the young was\nfor her a matter not of choice, but of necessity. With the majority of\nmaiden ladies left destitute in Dinwiddie after the war, she had turned\nnaturally to teaching as the only nice and respectable occupation which\nrequired neither preparation of mind nor considerable outlay of money.\nThe fact that she was the single surviving child of a gallant\nConfederate general, who, having distinguished himself and his\ndescendants, fell at last in the Battle of Gettysburg, was sufficient\nrecommendation of her abilities in the eyes of her fellow citizens. Had\nshe chosen to paint portraits or to write poems, they would have rallied\nquite as loyally to her support. Few, indeed, were the girls born in\nDinwiddie since the war who had not learned reading, penmanship (\"up to\nthe right, down to the left, my dear\"), geography, history, arithmetic,\ndeportment, and the fine arts, in the Academy for Young Ladies. The\nbrilliant military record of the General still shed a legendary lustre\nupon the school, and it was earnestly believed that no girl, after\nleaving there with a diploma for good conduct, could possibly go wrong\nor become eccentric in her later years. To be sure, she might remain a\ntrifle weak in her spelling (Miss Priscilla having, as she confessed, a\npoor head for that branch of study), but, after all, as the rector had\nonce remarked, good spelling was by no means a necessary accomplishment\nfor a lady; and, for the rest, it was certain that the moral education\nof a pupil of the Academy would be firmly rooted in such fundamental\nverities as the superiority of man and the aristocratic supremacy of the\nEpiscopal Church. From charming Sally Goode, now married to Tom\nPeachey, known familiarly as \"honest Tom,\" the editor of the Dinwiddie\n_Bee_, to lovely Virginia Pendleton, the mark of Miss Priscilla was\nineffaceably impressed upon the daughters of the leading families.\n\nRemembering this now, as she was disposed to do whenever she was\nknitting without company, Miss Priscilla dropped her long wooden needles\nin her lap, and leaning forward in her chair, gazed out upon the town\nwith an expression of child-like confidence, of touching innocence. This\ninnocence, which belonged to the very essence of her soul, had survived\nboth the fugitive joys and the brutal disillusionments of life.\nExperience could not shatter it, for it was the product of a courage\nthat feared nothing except opinions. Just as the town had battled for a\nprinciple without understanding it, so she was capable of dying for an\nidea, but not of conceiving one. She had suffered everything from the\nwar except the necessity of thinking independently about it, and, though\nin later years memory had become so sacred to her that she rarely\nindulged in it, she still clung passionately to the habits of her\nancestors under the impression that she was clinging to their ideals.\nLittle things filled her days--the trivial details of the classroom and\nof the market, the small domestic disturbances of her neighbours, the\nmoral or mental delinquencies of her two coloured servants--and even her\nreligious veneration for the Episcopal Church had crystallized at last\ninto a worship of customs.\n\nTo-day, at the beginning of the industrial awakening of the South, she\n(who was but the embodied spirit of her race) stood firmly rooted in all\nthat was static, in all that was obsolete and outgrown in the Virginia\nof the eighties. Though she felt as yet merely the vague uneasiness with\nwhich her mind recoiled from the first stirrings of change, she was\nbeginning dimly to realize that the car of progress would move through\nthe quiet streets before the decade was over. The smoke of factories was\nalready succeeding the smoke of the battlefields, and out of the ashes\nof a vanquished idealism the spirit of commercial materialism was born.\nWhat was left of the old was fighting valiantly, but hopelessly, against\nwhat had come of the new. The two forces filled the streets of\nDinwiddie. They were embodied in classes, in individuals, in articles of\nfaith, in ideals of manners. The symbol of the one spirit was the\nmemorial wreaths on the battlefields; of the other it was the prophetic\nsmoke of the factories. From where she stood in High Street, she could\nsee this incense to Mammon rising above the spires of the churches,\nabove the houses and the hovels, above the charm and the provincialism\nwhich made the Dinwiddie of the eighties. And this charm, as well as\nthis provincialism, appeared to her to be so inalienable a part of the\nold order, with its intrepid faith in itself, with its militant\nenthusiasm, with its courageous battle against industrial evolution,\nwith its strength, its narrowness, its nobility, its blindness, that,\nlooking ahead, she could discern only the arid stretch of a civilization\nfrom which the last remnant of beauty was banished forever. Already she\nfelt the breaking of those bonds of sympathy which had held the\ntwenty-one thousand inhabitants of Dinwiddie, as they had held the\nentire South, solidly knit together in a passive yet effectual\nresistance to the spirit of change. Of the world beyond the borders of\nVirginia, Dinwiddians knew merely that it was either Yankee or foreign,\nand therefore to be pitied or condemned according to the Evangelical or\nthe Calvinistic convictions of the observer. Philosophy, they regarded\nwith the distrust of a people whose notable achievements have not been\nin the direction of the contemplative virtues; and having lived\ncomfortably and created a civilization without the aid of science, they\ncould afford not unreasonably to despise it. It was a quarter of a\ncentury since \"The Origin of Species\" had changed the course of the\nworld's thought, yet it had never reached them. To be sure, there was an\nold gentleman in Tabb Street whose title, \"the professor,\" had been\nconferred in public recognition of peaceful pursuits; but since he never\nwent to church, his learning was chiefly effective when used to point a\nmoral from the pulpit. There was, also, a tradition that General Goode\nhad been seen reading Plato before the Battle of Seven Pines; and this\npicturesque incident had contributed the distinction of the scholar to\nthe more effulgent glory of the soldier. But for purely abstract\nthought--for the thought that did not construct an heroic attitude or a\nconcrete image--there was as little room in the newer industrial system\nas there had been in the aristocratic society which preceded it. The\nworld still clung to the belief that the business of humanity was\nconfined to the preservation of the institutions which existed in the\npresent moment of history--and Dinwiddie was only a quiet backwater into\nwhich opinions, like fashions, were borne on the current of some\ntributary stream of thought. Human nature in this town of twenty-one\nthousand inhabitants differed from human nature in London or in the\nDesert of Sahara mainly in the things that it ate and the manner in\nwhich it carried its clothes. The same passions stirred its heart, the\nsame instincts moved its body, the same contentment with things as they\nare, and the same terror of things as they might be, warped its mind.\n\nThe canary fluted on, and from beyond the mulberry trees there floated\nthe droning voice of an aged negress, in tatters and a red bandanna\nturban, who persuasively offered strawberries to the silent houses.\n\n\"I'se got sw-eet straw-ber'-ies! I'se got swe-e-t str-aw-ber'-ies!\nYes'm, I'se got sw-e-et straw-ber'ies des f'om de coun-try!\"\n\nThen, suddenly, out of nothing, it seemed to Miss Priscilla, a miracle\noccurred! The immemorial calm of High Street was broken by the sound of\nrapidly moving wheels (not the jingling rattle of market wagons nor the\ncomfortable roll of doctors' buggies), and a strange new vehicle,\nbelonging to the Dinwiddie Livery Stables, and containing a young man\nwith longish hair and a flowing tie, turned the corner by Saint James'\nChurch, and passed over the earthen roadbed in front of the green\nlattice. As the young man went by, he looked up quickly, smiled with the\nengaging frankness of a genial nature, and lifting his hat with a\ncharming bow, revealed to Miss Priscilla's eyes the fact that his hair\nwas thick and dark as well as long and wavy. While he looked at her, she\nnoticed, also, that he had a thin, high-coloured face, lighted by a pair\nof eager dark eyes which lent a glow of impetuous energy to his\nfeatures. The Treadwell nose, she recognized, but beneath the Treadwell\nnose there was a clean-shaven, boyish mouth which belied the Treadwell\nnature in every sensitive curve and outline.\n\n\"I'd have known him anywhere from Susan's description,\" she thought, and\nadded suspiciously, \"I wonder why he peered so long around that corner?\nIt wouldn't surprise me a bit if those girls were coming back that way.\"\n\nImpelled by her mounting excitement, she leaned forward until the ball\nof orange-coloured yarn rolled from her short lap and over the polished\nfloor of the porch. Before she could stoop to pick it up, she was\narrested by the reappearance of the two girls at the corner beyond which\nOliver had gazed so intently. Then, as they drew nearer, she saw that\nVirginia's face was pink and her eyes starry under their lowered lashes.\nAn inward radiance shone in the girl's look, and appeared to shape her\nsoul and body to its secret influence. Miss Priscilla, who had known her\nsince the first day she came to school (with her lunch, from which she\nrefused to be parted, tightly tied up in a red and white napkin), felt\nsuddenly that she was a stranger. A quality which she had never realized\nher pupil possessed had risen supreme in an instant over the familiar\nattributes of her character. So quickly does emotion separate the\nindividual from the inherent soul of the race.\n\nSusan, who was a little in advance, came rapidly up the walk, and the\nolder woman greeted her with the words:\n\n\"My dear, I have seen him!\"\n\n\"Yes, he just passed us at the corner, and I wondered if you were\nlooking. Do tell us what you think of him.\"\n\nShe sat down in a low chair by the teacher's side, while Virginia went\nover to the cage and stood gazing thoughtfully at the singing bird.\n\n\"Well, I don't think his nose spoils him,\" replied Miss Priscilla after\na minute, \"but there's something foreign looking about him, and I hope\nCyrus isn't thinking seriously about putting him into the bank.\"\n\n\"That was the first thing that occurred to father,\" answered Susan, \"but\nOliver told me last night while we were unpacking his books--he has a\nquantity of books and he kept them even when he had to sell his\nclothes--that he didn't see to save his life how he was going to stand\nit.\"\n\n\"Stand what?\" inquired Miss Priscilla, a trifle tartly, for after the\nvicissitudes of her life it was but natural that she should hesitate to\nregard so stable an institution as the Dinwiddie Bank as something to be\n\"stood.\" \"Why, I thought a young man couldn't do better than get a place\nin the bank. Jinny's father was telling me in the market last Saturday\nthat he wanted his nephew John Henry to start right in there if they\ncould find room for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, it's just what John Henry would like,\" said Virginia,\nspeaking for the first time.\n\n\"Then if it's good enough for John Henry, it's good enough for Oliver, I\nreckon,\" rejoined Miss Priscilla. \"Anybody who has mixed with beggars\noughtn't to turn up his nose at a respectable bank.\"\n\n\"But he says it's because the bank is so respectable that he doesn't\nthink he could stand it,\" answered Susan.\n\nVirginia, who had been looking with her rapt gaze down the deserted\nstreet, quivered at the words as if they had stabbed her.\n\n\"But he wants to be a writer, Susan,\" she protested. \"A great many very\nnice people are writers.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't he go about it in a proper way, if he isn't ashamed of\nit?\" asked the teacher, and she added reflectively after a pause, \"I\nwish he'd write a good history of the war--one that doesn't deal so much\nwith the North. I've almost had to stop teaching United States history\nbecause there is hardly one written now that I would let come inside my\ndoors.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to write histories,\" replied Susan. \"Father suggested\nto him at supper last night that if he would try his hand at a history\nof Virginia, and be careful not to put in anything that might offend\nanybody, he could get it taught in every private school in the State.\nBut he said he'd be shot first.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's a genius,\" said Virginia in a startled voice. \"Geniuses\nare always different from other people, aren't they?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Susan doubtfully. \"He talks of things I never\nheard of before, and he seems to think that they are the most important\nthings in the world.\"\n\n\"What things?\" asked Virginia breathlessly.\n\n\"Oh, I can't tell you because they are so new, but he seems on fire when\nhe talks of them. He talks for hours about art and its service to\nhumanity and about going down to the people and uplifting the masses.\"\n\n\"I hope he doesn't mean the negroes,\" commented Miss Priscilla\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"He means the whole world, I believe,\" responded Susan. \"He quotes all\nthe time from writers I've never heard of, and he laughs at every book\nhe sees in the house. Yesterday he picked up one of Mrs. Southworth's\nnovels on mother's bureau and asked her how she could allow such immoral\nstuff in her room. She had got it out of the bookcase to lend to Miss\nWilly Whitlow, who was there making my dress, but he scolded her so\nabout it that at last Miss Willy went off with Mill's 'Essay on\nLiberty,' and mother burned all of Mrs. Southworth's that she had in the\nhouse. Oliver has been so nice to mother that I believe she would make a\nbonfire of her furniture if he asked her to do it.\"\n\n\"Is he really trying to unsettle Miss Willy's mind?\" questioned the\nteacher anxiously. \"How on earth could she go out sewing by the day if\nshe didn't have her religious convictions?\"\n\n\"That's just what I asked him,\" returned Susan, who, besides being\ndangerously clever, had a remarkably level head to keep her balanced.\n\"But he answered that until people got unsettled they would never move,\nand when I wanted to find out where he thought poor little Miss Willy\ncould possibly move to, he only got impatient and said that I was trying\nto bury the principle under the facts. We very nearly quarrelled over\nMiss Willy, but of course she took the book to please Oliver and\ncouldn't worry through a line of it to save her soul.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything about his work? What he wants to do, I mean?\" asked\nVirginia, and her voice was so charged with feeling that it gave an\nemotional quality to the question.\n\n\"He wants to write,\" replied Susan. \"His whole heart is in it, and when\nhe isn't talking about reaching the people, he talks about what he calls\n'technique.'\"\n\n\"Are you sure it isn't poetry?\" inquired Miss Priscilla, humming back\nlike a bee to the tempting sweets of conjecture. \"I've always heard that\npoetry was the ruination of Poe.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't poetry--not exactly at least--it's plays,\" answered Susan.\n\"He talked to me till twelve o'clock last night while we were arranging\nhis books, and he told me that he meant to write really great dramas,\nbut that America wasn't ready for them yet and that was why he had had\nto sell his clothes. He looked positively starved, but he says he\ndoesn't mind starving a while if he can only live up to his ideal.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder what his ideal is?\" remarked Miss Priscilla grimly.\n\n\"It has something to do with his belief that art can grow only out of\nsacrifice,\" said Susan. \"I never heard anybody--not even Jinny's father\nin church--talk so much about sacrifice.\"\n\n\"But the rector doesn't talk about sacrifice for the theatre,\" retorted\nthe teacher, and she added with crushing finality, \"I don't believe\nthere is a particle of sense in it. If he is going to write, why on\nearth doesn't he sit straight down and do it? Why, when little Miss\nAmanda Sheppard was left at sixty without a roof over her head, she\nbegan at once, without saying a word to anybody, to write historical\nnovels.\"\n\n\"It does seem funny until you talk with him,\" admitted Susan. \"But he is\nso much in earnest that when you listen to him, you can't help believing\nin him. He is so full of convictions that he convinces you in spite of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Convictions about what?\" demanded Miss Priscilla. \"I don't see how a\nyoung man who refuses to be confirmed can have any convictions.\"\n\n\"Well, he has, and he feels just as strongly about them as we do about\nours.\"\n\n\"But how can he possibly feel as strongly about a wrong conviction as we\ndo about a right one?\" insisted the older woman stubbornly, for she\nrealized vaguely that they were approaching dangerous ground and set out\nto check their advance in true Dinwiddie fashion, which was strictly\nprohibitive.\n\n\"I like a man who has opinions of his own and isn't ashamed to stand up\nfor them,\" said Virginia with a resolution that made her appear suddenly\ntaller.\n\n\"Not _false_ opinions, Jinny!\" rejoined Miss Priscilla, and her manner\ncarried them with a bound back to the schoolroom, for her mental vision\nsaw in a flash the beribboned diploma for good conduct which her\nfavourite pupil had borne away from the Academy on Commencement day two\nyears ago, and a shudder seized her lest she should have left a single\nunprotected breach in the girl's mind through which an unauthorized idea\nmight enter. Had she trusted too confidently to the fact that Virginia's\nfather was a clergyman, and therefore spiritually armed for the defence\nand guidance of his daughter? Virginia, in spite of her gaiety, had been\nwhat Miss Priscilla called \"a docile pupil,\" meaning one who\ndeferentially submitted her opinions to her superiors, and to go through\nlife perpetually submitting her opinions was, in the eyes of her parents\nand her teacher, the divinely appointed task of woman. Her education\nwas founded upon the simple theory that the less a girl knew about life,\nthe better prepared she would be to contend with it. Knowledge of any\nsort (except the rudiments of reading and writing, the geography of\ncountries she would never visit, and the dates of battles she would\nnever mention) was kept from her as rigorously as if it contained the\ngerms of a contagious disease. And this ignorance of anything that could\npossibly be useful to her was supposed in some mysterious way to add to\nher value as a woman and to make her a more desirable companion to a man\nwho, either by experience or by instinct, was expected \"to know his\nworld.\" Unlike Susan (who, in a community which offered few\nopportunities to women outside of the nursery or the kitchen, had been\nborn with the inquiring spirit and would ask questions), Virginia had\nuntil to-day accepted with humility the doctrine that a natural\ncuriosity about the universe is the beginning of infidelity. The chief\nobject of her upbringing, which differed in no essential particular from\nthat of every other well-born and well-bred Southern woman of her day,\nwas to paralyze her reasoning faculties so completely that all danger of\nmental \"unsettling\" or even movement was eliminated from her future. To\nsolidify the forces of mind into the inherited mould of fixed beliefs\nwas, in the opinion of the age, to achieve the definite end of all\neducation. When the child ceased to wonder before the veil of\nappearances, the battle of orthodoxy with speculation was over, and Miss\nPriscilla felt that she could rest on her victory. With Susan she had\nfailed, because the daughter of Cyrus Treadwell was one of those\ninexplicable variations from ancestral stock over which the naturalists\nwere still waging their merry war; but Virginia, with a line of earnest\ntheologians and of saintly self-effacing women at her back, offered as\nlittle resistance as some exquisite plastic material in the teacher's\nhands.\n\nNow, as if the same lightning flash which had illuminated the beribboned\ndiploma in Miss Priscilla's mind had passed to Virginia also, the girl\nbit back a retort that was trembling on her lips. \"I wonder if she can\nbe getting to know things?\" thought the older woman as she watched her,\nand she added half resentfully, \"I've sometimes suspected that Gabriel\nPendleton was almost too mild and easy going for a clergyman. If the\nLord hadn't made him a saint, Heaven knows what would have become of\nhim!\"\n\n\"Don't try to put notions into Jinny's head, Susan,\" she said after a\nthoughtful pause. \"If Oliver were the right kind of young man, he'd give\nup this nonsense and settle down to some sober work. The first time I\nget a chance I'm going to tell him so.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it will be any use,\" responded Susan. \"Father tried to\nreason with him last night, and they almost quarrelled.\"\n\n\"Quarrelled with Cyrus!\" gasped the teacher.\n\n\"At one time I thought he'd walk out of the house and never come back,\"\npursued Susan. \"He told father that his sordid commercialism would end\nby destroying all that was charming in Dinwiddie. Afterward he\napologized for his rudeness, but when he did so, he said, 'I meant every\nword of it.'\"\n\n\"Well, I never!\" was Miss Priscilla's feeble rejoinder. \"The idea of\nhis daring to talk that way when Cyrus had to pay his fare down from New\nYork.\"\n\n\"Of course father brought it on,\" returned Susan judicially. \"You know\nhe doesn't like anybody to disagree with him, and when Oliver began to\nargue about its being unscrupulous to write history the way people\nwanted it, he lost his temper and said some angry things about the\ntheatre and actors.\"\n\n\"I suppose a great man like your father may expect his family to bow to\nhis opinions,\" replied the teacher, for so obscure was her mental\nconnection between the construction of the future and the destruction of\nthe past, that she could honestly admire Cyrus Treadwell for possessing\nthe qualities her soul abhorred. The simple awe of financial success,\nwhich occupies in the American mind the vacant space of the monarchical\ncult, had begun already to generate the myth of greatness around Cyrus,\nand, like all other myths, this owed its origin less to the wilful\nconspiracy of the few than it did to the confiding superstition of the\nmany.\n\n\"I hope Oliver won't do anything rash,\" said Susan, ignoring Miss\nPriscilla's tribute. \"He is so impulsive and headstrong that I don't see\nhow he can get on with father.\"\n\nAt this Virginia broke her quivering silence. \"Can't you make him\ncareful, Susan?\" she asked, and without waiting for an answer, bent over\nand kissed Miss Priscilla on the cheek. \"I must be going now or mother\nwill worry,\" she added before she tripped ahead of Susan down the steps\nand along the palely shining path to the gate.\n\nRising from her chair, Miss Priscilla leaned over the railing of the\nporch, and gazed wistfully after the girls' vanishing figures.\n\n\"If there was ever a girl who looked as if she were cut out for\nhappiness, it is Jinny Pendleton,\" she said aloud after a minute. A tear\nwelled in her eye, and rolling over her cheek, dropped on her bosom.\nFrom some obscure corner of her memory, undevastated by war or by ruin,\nher own youth appeared to take the place of Virginia's. She saw herself,\nas she had seen the other an instant before, standing flushed and\nexpectant before the untrodden road of the future. She heard again the\nwings of happiness rustling unseen about her, and she felt again the\ngreat hope which is the challenge that youth flings to destiny. Life\nrose before her, not as she had found it, but as she had once believed\nit to be. The days when little things had not filled her thoughts\nreturned in the fugitive glow of her memory--for she, also, middle-aged,\nobese, cumbered with trivial cares, had had her dream of a love that\nwould change and glorify the reality. The heritage of woman was hers as\nwell as Virginia's. And for the first time, standing there, she grew\ndimly conscious of the portion of suffering which Nature had allotted to\nthem both from the beginning. Was it all waiting--waiting, as it had\nbeen while battles were fought and armies were marching? Did the future\nhold this for Virginia also? Would life yield nothing more to that\nradiant girl than it had yielded to her or to the other women whom she\nhad known? Strange how the terrible innocence of youth had moved her\nplacid middle-age as if it were sadness!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHER INHERITANCE\n\n\nA block away, near the head of High Street, stood the old church of\nSaint James, and at its back, separated by a white paling fence from the\nsquat pinkish tower and the solitary grave in the churchyard (which was\nthat of a Southern soldier who had fallen in the Battle of Dinwiddie),\nwas the oblong wooden rectory in which Gabriel Pendleton had lived since\nhe had exchanged his sword for a prayer-book and his worn Confederate\nuniform for a surplice. The church, which was redeemed from\narchitectural damnation by its sacred cruciform and its low ivied\nbuttresses where innumerable sparrows nested, cast its shadow, on clear\ndays, over the beds of bleeding hearts and lilies-of-the-valley in the\nneglected garden, to the quaint old house, with its spreading wings, its\noutside chimneys, and its sloping shingled roof, from which five\ndormer-windows stared in a row over the slender columns of the porch.\nThe garden had been planned in the days when it was easy to put a dozen\nslaves to uprooting weeds or trimming flower beds, and had passed in\nlater years to the breathless ministrations of negro infants, whose\nexperience varied from the doubtful innocence of the crawling age to the\ncomplete sophistication of six or seven years. Dandelion and wire-grass\nrioted, in spite of their earnest efforts, over the crooked path from\nthe porch, and periwinkle, once an intruder from the churchyard, spread\nnow in rank disorder down the terraced hillside on the left, where a\nsteep flight of steps fell clear to the narrow cross street descending\ngradually into the crowded quarters of the town. Directly in front of\nthe porch on either side of the path grew two giant paulownia trees,\nroyal at this season in a mantle of violet blossoms, and it was under\ntheir arching boughs that the girls stopped when they had entered the\ngarden. Ever since Virginia could remember, she had heard threats of\ncutting down the paulownias because of the litter the falling petals\nmade in the spring, and ever since she could lisp at all she had begged\nher father to spare them for the sake of the enormous roots, into which\nshe had loved to cuddle and hide.\n\n\"If I were ever to go away, I believe they would cut down these trees,\"\nshe said now a little wistfully, but she was not thinking of the\npaulownias.\n\n\"Why should they when they give such splendid shade? And, besides, they\nwouldn't do anything you didn't like for worlds.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course they wouldn't, but as soon as I was out of sight they\nmight persuade themselves that I liked it,\" answered Virginia, with a\ntender laugh. Though she was not by nature discerning, there were\nmoments when she surprised Susan by her penetrating insight into the\ncharacter of her parents, and this insight, which was emotional rather\nthan intellectual, had enabled her to dominate them almost from infancy.\n\nSilence fell between them, while they gazed through the veil of twilight\nat the marble shaft above the grave of the Confederate soldier. Then\nsuddenly Susan spoke in a constrained voice, without turning her head.\n\n\"Jinny, Oliver isn't one bit of a hero--not the kind of hero we used to\ntalk about.\" It was with difficulty, urged by a vigorous and\nuncompromising conscience, that she had uttered the words.\n\n\"And besides,\" retorted Virginia merrily, \"he is in love with Abby\nGoode.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that. They stayed in the same boarding-house once, and\nyou know how Abby is about men.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, and it's just the way men are about Abby.\"\n\n\"Well, Oliver isn't, I'm sure. I don't believe he's ever given her more\nthan a thought, and he told me last night that he couldn't abide a\nbouncing woman.\"\n\n\"Does Abby bounce?\"\n\n\"You know she does--dreadfully. But it wasn't because of Abby that I\nsaid what I did.\"\n\nSomething quivered softly between them, and a petal from the Jacqueminot\nrose in Virginia's hair fluttered like a crimson moth out into the\ntwilight. \"Was it because of him, then?\" she asked in a whisper.\n\nFor a moment Susan did not answer. Her gaze was on the flight of steps,\nand drawing Virginia with her, she began to walk slowly toward the\nterraced side of the garden. An old lamplighter, carrying his ladder to\na lamp-post at the corner, smiled up at them with his sunken toothless\nmouth as he went by.\n\n\"Partly, darling,\" said Susan. \"He is so--I don't know how to make you\nunderstand--so unsettled. No, that isn't exactly what I mean.\"\n\nHer fine, serious face showed clear and pale in the twilight. From the\nhigh forehead, under the girlish fringe of fair hair, to the thin, firm\nlips, which were too straight and colourless for beauty, it was the\nface of a woman who could feel strongly, but whose affections would\nnever blur the definite forms or outlines of life. She looked out upon\nthe world with level, dispassionate eyes in which there was none of\nVirginia's uncritical, emotional softness. Temperamentally she was\nuncompromisingly honest in her attitude toward the universe, which\nappeared to her, not as it did to Virginia, in mere formless masses of\ncolour out of which people and objects emerged like figures painted on\nair, but as distinct, impersonal, and final as a geometrical problem.\nShe was one of those women who are called \"sensible\" by their\nacquaintances--meaning that they are born already disciplined and\nconfirmed in the quieter and more orderly processes of life. Her natural\nintelligence having overcome the defects of her education, she thought\nnot vaguely, but with clearness and precision, and something of this\nclearness and precision was revealed in her manner and in her\nappearance, as if she had escaped at twenty years from the impulsive\njudgments and the troublous solicitudes of youth. At forty, she would\nprobably begin to grow young again, and at fifty, it is not unlikely\nthat she would turn her back upon old age forever. Just now she was too\ntremendously earnest about life, which she treated quite in the large\nmanner, to take a serious interest in living.\n\n\"Promise me, Jinny, that you'll never let anybody take my place,\" she\nsaid, turning when they had reached the head of the steps.\n\n\"You silly Susan! Why, of course, they shan't,\" replied Virginia, and\nthey kissed ecstatically.\n\n\"Nobody will ever love you as I do.\"\n\n\"And I you, darling.\"\n\nWith arms interlaced they stood gazing down into the street, where the\nshadow of the old lamplighter glided like a ghost under the row of pale\nflickering lights. From a honeysuckle-trellis on the other side of the\nporch, a penetrating sweetness came in breaths, now rising, now dying\naway. In Virginia's heart, Love stirred suddenly, and blind, wingless,\nimprisoned, struggled for freedom.\n\n\"It is late, I must be going,\" said Susan. \"I wish we lived nearer each\nother.\"\n\n\"Isn't it too dark for you to go alone? John Henry will stop on his way\nfrom work, and he'll take you--if you really won't stay to supper.\"\n\n\"No, I don't mind in the least going by myself. It isn't night, anyway,\nand people are sitting out on their porches.\"\n\nA minute afterwards they parted, Susan going swiftly down High Street,\nwhile Virginia went back along the path to the porch, and passing under\nthe paulownias, stopped beside the honeysuckle-trellis, which extended\nto the ruined kitchen garden at the rear of the house. Once vegetables\nwere grown here, but except for a square bed of mint which spread\nhardily beneath the back windows of the dining-room, the place was left\nnow a prey to such barbarian invaders as burdock and moth mullein. On\nthe brow of the hill, where the garden ended, there was a gnarled and\ntwisted ailanthus tree, and from its roots the ground fell sharply to a\ndistant view of rear enclosures and grim smoking factories. Some clothes\nfluttered on a line that stretched from a bough of the tree, and turning\naway as if they offended her, Virginia closed her eyes and breathed in\nthe sweetness of the honeysuckle, which mingled deliciously with the\nstrange new sense of approaching happiness in her heart. The awakening\nof her imagination--an event more tumultuous in its effects than the\nmere awakening of emotion--had changed not only her inner life, but the\nordinary details of the world in which she lived. Because a young man,\nwho differed in no appreciable manner from dozens of other young men,\nhad gazed into her eyes for an instant, the whole universe was altered.\nWhat had been until to-day a vague, wind-driven longing for happiness,\nthe reaching out of the dream toward the reality, had assumed suddenly a\nfixed and definite purpose. Her bright girlish visions had wrapped\nthemselves in a garment of flesh. A miracle more wonderful than any she\nhad read of had occurred in the streets of Dinwiddie--in the very spot\nwhere she had walked, with blind eyes and deaf ears, every day since she\ncould remember. Her soul blossomed in the twilight, as a flower\nblossoms, and shed its virginal sweetness. For the first time in her\ntwenty years she felt that an unexplored region of happiness surrounded\nher. Life appeared so beautiful that she wanted to grasp and hold each\nfugitive sensation before it escaped her. \"This is different from\nanything I've ever known. I never imagined it would be like this,\" she\nthought, and the next minute: \"I wonder why no one has ever told me that\nit would happen? I wonder if it has ever really happened before, just\nlike this, since the world began? Of all the ways I've dreamed of his\ncoming, I never thought of this way--no, not for an instant. That I\nshould see him first in the street like any stranger--that he should be\nSusan's cousin--that we should not have spoken a word before I knew it\nwas he!\" Everything about him, his smile, his clothes, the way he held\nhis head and brushed his hair straight back from his forehead, his\nmanner of reclining with a slight slouch on the seat of the cart, the\npicturesque blue dotted tie he wore, his hands, his way of bowing, the\nred-brown of his face, and above all the eager, impetuous look in his\ndark eyes--these things possessed a glowing quality of interest which\nirradiated a delicious excitement over the bare round of living. It was\nenough merely to be alive and conscious that some day--to-morrow, next\nweek, or the next hour, perhaps, she might meet again the look that had\ncaused this mixture of ecstasy and terror in her heart. The knowledge\nthat he was in the same town with her, watching the same lights,\nthinking the same thoughts, breathing the same fragrance of\nhoneysuckle--this knowledge was a fact of such tremendous importance\nthat it dwarfed to insignificance all the proud historic past of\nDinwiddie. Her imagination, seizing upon this bit of actuality, spun\naround it the iridescent gossamer web of her fancy. She felt that it was\nsufficient happiness just to stand motionless for hours and let this\nthought take possession of her. Nothing else mattered as long as this\none thing was blissfully true.\n\nLights came out softly like stars in the houses beyond the church-tower,\nand in the parlour of the rectory a lamp flared up and then burned dimly\nunder a red shade. Looking through the low window, she could see the\nprim set of mahogany and horsehair furniture, with its deep, heavily\ncarved sofa midway of the opposite wall and the twelve chairs which\ncustom demanded arranged stiffly at equal distances on the faded\nAxminster carpet.\n\nFor a moment her gaze rested on the claw-footed mahogany table, bearing\na family Bible and a photograph album bound in morocco; on the engraving\nof the \"Burial of Latane\" between the long windows at the back of the\nroom; on the cloudy, gilt-framed mirror above the mantel, with the two\nstanding candelabra reflected in its surface--and all these familiar\nobjects appeared to her as vividly as if she had not lived with them\nfrom her infancy. A new light had fallen over them, and it seemed to her\nthat this light released an inner meaning, a hidden soul, even in the\nclaw-footed table and the threadbare Axminster carpet. Then the door\ninto the hall opened and her mother entered, wearing the patched black\nsilk dress which she had bought before the war and had turned and darned\never since with untiring fingers. Shrinking back into the dusk, Virginia\nwatched the thin, slightly stooping figure as it stood arrested there in\nthe subdued glow of the lamplight. She saw the pale oval face, so\ntransparent that it was like the face of a ghost, the fine brown hair\nparted smoothly under the small net cap, the soft faded eyes in their\nhollowed and faintly bluish sockets, and the sweet, patient lips, with\ntheir expression of anxious sympathy, as of one who had lived not in her\nown joys and sorrows, but in those of others. Vaguely, the girl realized\nthat her mother had had what is called \"a hard life,\" but this knowledge\nbrought no tremor of apprehension for herself, no shadow of disbelief in\nher own unquestionable right to happiness. A glorious certainty\npossessed her that her own life would be different from anything that\nhad ever been in the past.\n\nThe front door opened and shut; there was a step on the soft grass under\nthe honeysuckle-trellis, and her father came towards her, with his long\nblack coat flapping about him. He always wore clothes several sizes too\nlarge for him under the impression that it was a point of economy and\nthat they would last longer if there was no \"strain\" put upon them. He\nwas a small, wiry man, with an amazing amount of strength for his build,\nand a keen, humorous face, ornamented by a pointed chin beard which he\ncalled his \"goatee.\" His eyes were light grey with a twinkle which\nrarely left them except at the altar, and the skin of his cheeks had\nnever lost the drawn and parchment-like look acquired during the last\nyears of the war. One of the many martial Christians of the Confederacy,\nhe had laid aside his surplice at the first call for troops to defend\nthe borders, and had resumed it immediately after the surrender at\nAppomattox. It was still an open question in Dinwiddie whether Gabriel\nPendleton, who was admitted to have been born a saint, had achieved\ngreater distinction as a fighter or a clergyman; though he himself had\naccepted the opposite vocations with equal humility. Only in the dead of\nsweltering summer nights did he sometimes arouse his wife with a groan\nand the halting words, \"Lucy, I can't sleep for thinking of those men I\nkilled in the war.\" But with the earliest breeze of dawn, his remorse\nusually left him, and he would rise and go about his parochial duties\nwith the serene and child-like trust in Providence that had once carried\nhim into battle. A militant idealism had ennobled his fighting as it now\nexalted his preaching. He had never in his life seen things as they are\nbecause he had seen them always by the white flame of a soul on fire\nwith righteousness. To reach his mind, impressions of persons or objects\nhad first to pass through a refining atmosphere in which all baser\nsubstances were eliminated, and no fact had ever penetrated this medium\nexcept in the flattering disguise of a sentiment. Having married at\ntwenty an idealist only less ignorant of the world than himself, he had,\ninspired by her example, immediately directed his energies towards the\nwhitewashing of the actuality. Both cherished the na\u00c3\u00afve conviction that\nto acknowledge an evil is in a manner to countenance its existence, and\nboth clung fervently to the belief that a pretty sham has a more\nintimate relation to morality than has an ugly truth. Yet so unconscious\nwere they of weaving this elaborate tissue of illusion around the world\nthey inhabited that they called the mental process by which they\ndistorted the reality, \"taking a true view of life.\" To \"take a true\nview\" was to believe what was pleasant against what was painful in spite\nof evidence: to grant honesty to all men (with the possible exception of\nthe Yankee army and a few local scalawags known as Readjusters); to deny\nvirtue to no woman, not even to the New England Abolitionist; to regard\nthe period before the war in Virginia as attained perfection, and the\npresent as falling short of that perfection only inasmuch as it had\noccurred since the surrender. As life in a small place, among a simple\nand guileless class of gentlefolk, all passionately cherishing the same\nopinions, had never shaken these illusions, it was but natural that they\nshould have done their best to hand them down as sacred heirlooms to\ntheir only child. Even Gabriel's four years of hard fighting and scant\nrations were enkindled by so much of the disinterested idealism that\nhad sent his State into the Confederacy, that he had emerged from them\nwith an impoverished body, but an enriched spirit. Combined with his\ninherent inability to face the facts of life, there was an almost\nsuperhuman capacity for cheerful recovery from the shocks of adversity.\nSince he had married by accident the one woman who was made for him, he\nhad managed to preserve untarnished his innocent assumption that\nmarriages were arranged in Heaven--for the domestic infelicities of many\nof his parishioners were powerless to affect a belief that was founded\nupon a solitary personal experience. Unhappy marriages, like all other\nmisfortunes of society, he was inclined to regard as entirely modern and\ndue mainly to the decay of antebellum institutions. \"I don't remember\nthat I ever heard of a discontented servant or an unhappy marriage in my\nboyhood,\" he would say when he was forced against his will to consider\neither of these disturbing problems. Not progress, but a return to the\n\"ideals of our ancestors,\" was his sole hope for the future; and in\nVirginia's childhood she had grown to regard this phrase as second in\nreverence only to that other familiar invocation: \"If it be the will of\nGod.\"\n\nAs he stood now in the square of lamplight that streamed from the\ndrawing-room window, she looked into his thin, humorous face, so\nspiritualized by poverty and self-sacrifice that it had become merely\nthe veil for his soul, and the thought came to her that she had never\nreally seen him as he was until to-day.\n\n\"You're out late, daughter. Isn't it time for supper?\" he asked, putting\nhis arm about her. Beneath the simple words she felt the profound\naffection which he rarely expressed, but of which she was conscious\nwhenever he looked at her or spoke to her. Two days ago this affection,\nof which she never thought because it belonged to her by right like the\nair she breathed, had been sufficient to fill her life to overflowing;\nand now, in less than a moment, the simplest accident had pushed it into\nthe background. In the place where it had been there was a restless\nlonging which seemed at one instant a part of the universal stirring of\nthe spring, and became the next an importunate desire for the coming of\nthe lover to whom she had been taught to look as to the fulfilment of\nher womanhood. At times this lover appeared to have no connection with\nOliver Treadwell; then the memory of his eager and searching look would\nflush the world with a magic enchantment. \"He might pass here at any\nminute,\" she thought, and immediately every simple detail of her life\nwas illuminated as if a quivering rosy light had fallen aslant it. His\ndrive down High Street in the afternoon had left a trail of glory over\nthe earthen roadbed.\n\n\"Yes, I was just going in,\" she replied to the rector's question, and\nadded: \"How sweet the honeysuckle smells! I never knew it to be so\nfragrant.\"\n\n\"The end of the trellis needs propping up. I noticed it this morning,\"\nhe returned, keeping his arm around her as they passed over the short\ngrassy walk and up the steps to the porch. Then the door of the rectory\nopened, and the silhouette of Mrs. Pendleton, in her threadbare black\nsilk dress with her cameo-like profile softened by the dark bands of her\nhair, showed motionless against the lighted space of the hall.\n\n\"We're here, Lucy,\" said the rector, kissing her; and a minute later\nthey entered the dining-room, which was on the right of the staircase.\nThe old mahogany table, scarred by a century of service, was laid with\na simple supper of bread, tea, and sliced ham on a willow dish. At one\nend there was a bowl of freshly gathered strawberries, with the dew\nstill on them, and Mrs. Pendleton hastened to explain that they were a\npresent from Tom Peachey, who had driven out into the country in order\nto get them. \"Well, I hope his wife has some, also,\" commented the\nrector. \"Tom's a good fellow, but he could never keep a closed fist,\nthere's no use denying it.\"\n\nMrs. Pendleton, who had never denied anything in her life, except the\nbiblical sanction for the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution,\nshook her head gently and began to talk in the inattentive and anxious\nmanner she had acquired at scantily furnished tables. Ever since the\nwar, with the exception of the Reconstruction period, when she had lived\npractically on charity, she had managed to exist with serenity, and\nnumerous negro dependents, on the rector's salary of a thousand dollars\na year. Simple and wholesome food she had supplied to her family and her\nfollowers, and for their desserts, as she called the sweet things of\nlife, she had relied with touching confidence upon her neighbours. What\nthey would be for the day, she did not know, but since poverty, not\nprosperity, breeds the generous heart, she was perfectly assured that\nwhen Miss Priscilla was putting up raspberries, or Mrs. Goode was making\nlemon pie, she should not be forgotten. During the terrible war years,\nit had become the custom of Dinwiddie housekeepers to remember the wife\nof the rector who had plucked off his surplice for the Confederacy, and\namong the older generation the habit still persisted, like all other\nlinks that bound them to a past which they cherished the more\npassionately because it guarded a defeated cause. Like the soft\napologetic murmur of Mrs. Pendleton's voice, which was meant to distract\nattention rather than to impart information, this impassioned memory of\nthe thing that was dead sweetened the less romantic fact of the things\nthat were living. The young were ignorant of it, but the old _knew_.\nMrs. Pendleton, who was born a great lady, remained one when the props\nand the background of a great lady had crumbled around her; and though\nthe part she filled was a narrow part--a mere niche in the world's\nhistory--she filled it superbly. From the dignity of possessions she had\npassed to the finer dignity of a poverty that can do without. All the\nintellect in her (for she was not clever) had been transmuted into\ncharacter by this fiery passage from romance into reality, and though\nlife had done its worst with her, some fine invincible blade in the\ndepths of her being she had never surrendered. She would have gone to\nthe stake for a principle as cheerfully as she had descended from her\naristocratic niche into unceasing poverty and self-denial, but she would\nhave gone wearing garlands on her head and with her faint, grave smile,\nin which there was almost every quality except that of humour, touching\nher lips. Her hands, which were once lovely, were now knotted and worn;\nfor she had toiled when it was necessary, though she had toiled always\nwith the manner of a lady. Even to-day it was a part of her triumph that\nthis dignity was so vital a factor in her life that there was none of\nher husband's laughter at circumstances to lighten her burden. To her\nthe daily struggle of keeping an open house on starvation fare was not a\npathetic comedy, as with Gabriel, but a desperately smiling tragedy.\nWhat to Gabriel had been merely the discomfort of being poor when\neverybody you respected was poor with you, had been to his wife the slow\nagony of crucifixion. It was she, not he, who had lain awake to wonder\nwhere to-morrow's dinner could be got without begging; it was she, also,\nwho had feared to doze at dawn lest she should oversleep herself and not\nbe downstairs in time to scrub the floors and the furniture before the\nneighbours were stirring. Uncle Isam, whose knees were crippled with\nrheumatism, and Docia, who had a \"stitch\" in her side whenever she\nstooped, were the only servants that remained with her, and the nursing\nof these was usually added to the pitiless drudgery of her winter. But\nthe bitter edge to all her suffering was the feeling which her husband\nspoke of in the pulpit as \"false pride\"--the feeling she prayed over\nfervently yet without avail in church every Sunday--and this was the\nignoble terror of being seen on her knees in her old black calico dress\nbefore she had gone upstairs again, washed her hands with cornmeal,\npowdered her face with her pink flannel starchbag, and descended in her\nbreakfast gown of black cashmere or lawn, with a net scarf tied daintily\naround her thin throat, and a pair of exquisitely darned lace ruffles\nhiding her wrists.\n\nAs she sat now, smiling and calm, at the head of her table, there was no\nhint in her face of the gnawing anxiety behind the delicate blue-veined\nhollows in her forehead. \"I thought John Henry would come to supper,\"\nshe observed, while her hands worked lovingly among the old white and\ngold teacups which had belonged to her mother, \"so I gathered a few\nflowers.\"\n\nIn the centre of the table there was a handful of garden flowers\narranged, with a generous disregard of colour, in a cut-glass bowl, as\nthough all blossoms were intended by their Creator to go peaceably\ntogether. Only on formal occasions was such a decoration used on the\ntable of the rectory, since the happiest adornment for a meal was\nsupposed to be a bountiful supply of visible viands; but the hopelessly\nmended mats had pierced Mrs. Pendleton's heart, and the cut-glass bowl,\nlike her endless prattle, was but a pitiful subterfuge.\n\n\"Oh, I like them!\" Virginia had started to answer, when a hearty voice\ncalled, \"May I come in?\" from the darkness, and a large, carelessly\ndressed young man, with an amiable and rather heavy countenance, entered\nthe hall and passed on into the dining-room. In reply to Mrs.\nPendleton's offer of tea, he answered that he had stopped at the\nTreadwells' on his way up from work. \"I could hardly break away from\nOliver,\" he added, \"but I remembered that I'd promised Aunt Lucy to take\nher down to Tin Pot Alley after supper, so I made a bolt while he was\nconvincing me that it's better to be poor with an idea, as he calls it,\nthan rich without one.\" Then turning to Virginia, he asked suddenly:\n\"What's the matter, little cousin? Been about too much in the sun?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's only the rose in my hair,\" responded Virginia, and she felt\nthat there was a fierce joy in blushing like this even while she told\nherself that she would give everything she possessed if she could only\nstop it.\n\n\"If you aren't well, you'd better not go with us, Jinny,\" said Mrs.\nPendleton. \"It was so sweet of John Henry to remember that I'd promised\nto take Aunt Ailsey some of the bitters we used to make before the war.\"\nEverything was \"so sweet\" to her, the weather, her husband's sermons,\nthe little trays that came continually from her neighbours, and she\nlived in a perpetual state of thankfulness for favours so insignificant\nthat a less impressionable soul would have accepted them as undeserving\nof more than the barest acknowledgment.\n\n\"I am perfectly well,\" insisted Virginia, a little angry with John Henry\nbecause he had been the first to notice her blushes.\n\nRising hurriedly from the table, she went to the door and stood looking\nout into the spangled dusk under the paulownias, while her mother\nwrapped the bottle in a piece of white tissue paper and remarked with an\nanimation which served to hide her fatigue from the unobservant eyes of\nher husband, that a walk would do her good on such a \"perfectly lovely\nnight.\"\n\nGabriel, who loved her as much as a man can love a wife who has\nsacrificed herself to him wisely and unwisely for nearly thirty years,\nhad grown so used to seeing her suffer with a smile that he had drifted\nat last into the belief that it was the only form of activity she really\nenjoyed. From the day of his marriage he had never been able to deny her\nanything she had set her heart upon--not even the privilege of working\nherself to death for his sake when the opportunity offered.\n\n\"Well, well, if you feel like it, of course you must go, my dear,\" he\nreplied. \"I'll step over and sit a minute with Miss Priscilla while you\nare away. Never could bear the house without you, Lucy.\"\n\nWhile this protest was still on his lips, he followed her from the\nhouse, and turned with Virginia and John Henry in the direction of the\nYoung Ladies' Academy. From the darkness beyond the iron gate there came\nthe soothing flow of Miss Priscilla's voice entertaining an evening\ncaller, and when the rector left them, as if irresistibly drawn toward\nthe honeyed sound of gossip, Virginia walked on in silence between John\nHenry and her mother. At each corner a flickering street lamp burned\nwith a thin yellow flame, and in the midst of the narrow orbit of its\nlight several shining moths circled swiftly like white moons revolving\nabout a sun. In the centre of the blocks, where the darkness was broken\nonly by small flower-like flakes of light that fell in clusters through\nboughs of mulberry or linden trees, there was the sound of whispering\nvoices and of rustling palm-leaf fans on the crowded porches behind\nscreens of roses or honeysuckle. Mrs. Pendleton, whose instinct prompted\nher to efface herself whenever she made a third at the meeting of maid\nand man (even though the man was only her nephew John Henry), began to\ntalk at last after waiting modestly for her daughter to begin the\nconversation. The story of Aunt Ailsey, of her great age, and her\ndictatorial temper, which made living with other servants impossible to\nher, started valiantly on its familiar road, and tripped but little when\nthe poor lady realized that neither John Henry nor Virginia was\nlistening. She was so used to talking for the sake of the sound she made\nrather than the impression she produced that her silvery ripple had\nbecome almost as lacking in self-consciousness as the song of a canary.\n\nBut Virginia, walking so quietly at her side, was inhabiting at the\nmoment a separate universe--a universe smelling of honeysuckle and\nfilled with starry pathways to happiness. In this universe Aunt Ailsey\nand her peculiarities, her mother's innocent prattle, and the solid body\nof John Henry touching her arm, were all as remote and trivial as the\nnight moths circling around the lamps. Looking at John Henry from under\nher lowered lashes, she felt a sudden pity for him because he was so\nfar--so very far indeed from being the right man. She saw him too\nclearly as he was--he stood before her in all the hard brightness of the\nreality, and first love, like beauty, depends less upon the truth of an\noutline than it does upon the softening quality of an atmosphere. There\nwas no mystery for her in the simple fact of his being. There was\nnothing left to discover about his great stature, his excellent heart,\nand his safe, slow mind that had been compelled to forego even the sort\nof education she had derived from Miss Priscilla. She knew that he had\nleft school at the age of eight in order to become the support of a\nwidowed mother, and she was pitifully aware of the tireless efforts he\nhad made after reaching manhood to remedy his ignorance of the\nelementary studies he had missed. Never had she heard a complaint from\nhim, never a regret for the sacrifice, never so much as an idle wonder\nwhy it should have been necessary. If the texture of his soul was not\nfinely wrought, the proportions of it were heroic. In him the Pendleton\nidealism had left the skies and been transmuted into the common\nsubstance of clay. He was of a practical bent of mind and had developed\na talent for his branch of business, which, to the bitter humiliation of\nhis mother, was that of hardware, with a successful specialty in\nbathtubs. Until to-day Virginia had always believed that John Henry\ninterested her, but now she wondered how she had ever spent so many\nhours listening to his talk about business. And with the thought her\nwhole existence appeared to her as dull and commonplace as those hours.\nA single instant of experience seemed longer to her than all the years\nshe had lived, and this instant had drained the colour and the sweetness\nfrom the rest of life. The shape of her universe had trembled suddenly\nand altered. Dimly she was beginning to realize that sensation, not\ntime, is the true measure of life. Nothing and everything had happened\nto her since yesterday.\n\nAs they turned into Short Market Street, Mrs. Pendleton's voice trailed\noff at last into silence, and she did not speak again while they passed\nhurriedly between the crumbling houses and the dilapidated shops which\nrose darkly on either side of the narrow cinder-strewn walks. The scent\nof honeysuckle did not reach here, and when they stopped presently at\nthe beginning of Tin Pot Alley, there floated out to them the sharp\nacrid odour of huddled negroes. In these squalid alleys, where the lamps\nburned at longer distances, the more primitive forms of life appeared to\nswarm like distorted images under the transparent civilization of the\ntown. The sound of banjo strumming came faintly from the dimness beyond,\nwhile at their feet the Problem of the South sprawled innocently amid\ntomato cans and rotting cabbage leaves.\n\n\"Wait here just a minute and I'll run up and speak to Aunt Ailsey,\"\nremarked Mrs. Pendleton with the dignity of a soul that is superior to\nsmells; and without noticing her daughter's reproachful nod of\nacquiescence, she entered the alley and disappeared through the doorway\nof the nearest hovel. A minute later her serene face looked down at them\nover a patchwork quilt which hung airing at half length from the window\nabove. \"But this is not life--it has nothing to do with life,\" thought\nVirginia, while the Pendleton blood in her rose in a fierce rebellion\nagainst all that was ugly and sordid in existence. Then her mother's\ntread was heard descending the short flight of steps, and the sensation\nvanished as quickly and as inexplicably as it had come.\n\n\"I tried not to keep you waiting, dear,\" said Mrs. Pendleton, hastening\ntoward them while she fanned herself rapidly with the small black fan\nshe carried. Her face looked tired and worn, and before moving on, she\npaused a moment and held her hand to her thin fluttering breast, while\ndeep bluish circles appeared to start out under the expression of\npathetic cheerfulness in her eyes. This pathetic cheerfulness, so\ncharacteristic of the women of her generation, was the first thing,\nperhaps, that a stranger would have noticed about her face; yet it was a\ntrait which neither her husband nor her child had ever observed. There\nwas a fine moisture on her forehead, and this added so greatly to the\nnatural transparency of her features that, standing there in the wan\nlight, she might have been mistaken for the phantom of her daughter's\nvivid flesh and blood beauty. \"I wonder if you would mind going on to\nBolingbroke Street, so I may speak to Belinda Treadwell a minute?\" she\nasked, as soon as she had recovered her breath. \"I want to find out if\nshe has engaged Miss Willy Whitlow for the whole week, or if there is\nany use my sending a message to her over in Botetourt. If she doesn't\nbegin at once, Jinny, you won't have a dress to wear to Abby Goode's\nparty.\"\n\nVirginia's heart gave a single bound of joy and lay quiet. Not for\nworlds would she have asked to go to the Treadwells', yet ever since\nthey had started, she had longed unceasingly to have her mother suggest\nit. The very stars, she felt, had worked together to bring about her\ndesire.\n\n\"But aren't you tired, mother? It really doesn't matter about my dress,\"\nshe murmured, for it was not in vain that she had wrested a diploma for\ndeportment from Miss Priscilla.\n\n\"Why can't I take the message for you, Aunt Lucy? You look tired to\ndeath,\" urged John Henry.\n\n\"Oh, I shan't mind the walk as soon as we get out into the breeze,\"\nreplied Mrs. Pendleton. \"It's a lovely night, only a little close in\nthis alley.\" And as she spoke she looked gently down on the Problem of\nthe South as the Southern woman had looked down on it for generations\nand would continue to look down on it for generations still to\ncome--without seeing that it was a problem.\n\n\"Well, it's good to get a breath of air, anyway!\" exclaimed John Henry\nwith fervour, when they had passed out of the alley into the lighted\nstreet. Around them the town seemed to beat with a single heart, as if\nit waited, like Virginia, in breathless suspense for some secret that\nmust come out of the darkness. Sometimes the sidewalks over which they\npassed were of flag-stones, sometimes they were of gravel or of strewn\ncinders. Now and then an old stone house, which had once sheltered\ncrinoline and lace ruffles, or had served as a trading station with the\nIndians before Dinwiddie had become a city, would loom between two small\nshops where the owners, coatless and covered with sweat, were selling\nflat beer to jaded and miserable customers. Up Bolingbroke Street a\nfaint breeze blew, lifting the moist satin-like hair on Mrs. Pendleton's\nforehead. Already its ancient dignity had deserted the quarter in which\nthe Treadwells lived, and it had begun to wear a forsaken and injured\nlook, as though it resented the degradation of commerce into which it\nhad descended.\n\n\"I can't understand why Cyrus Treadwell doesn't move over to Sycamore\nStreet,\" remarked John Henry after a moment of reflection in which he\nhad appeared to weigh this simple sentence with scrupulous exactness.\n\"He's rich enough, I suppose, to buy anything he wants.\"\n\n\"I've heard Susan say that it was her mother's old home and she didn't\ncare to leave it,\" said Mrs. Pendleton.\n\n\"I don't believe it's that a bit,\" broke in Virginia with characteristic\nimpulsiveness. \"The only reason is that Mr. Treadwell is stingy. With\nall his money, I know Mrs. Treadwell and Susan hardly ever have a dollar\nthey can spend on themselves.\"\n\nThough she spoke with her accustomed energy, she was conscious all the\ntime that the words she uttered were not the ones in her thoughts. What\ndid Cyrus Treadwell's stinginess matter when his only relation to life\nconsisted in his being the uncle of Oliver? It was as if a single shape\nmoved alive through a universe peopled with shadows. Only a borrowed\nradiance attached itself now to the persons and objects that had\nillumined the world for her yesterday. Yet she approached the crisis of\nher life so silently that those around her did not recognize it beneath\nthe cover of ordinary circumstances. Like most great moments it had come\nunheralded; and though the rustling of its wings filled her soul,\nneither her mother nor John Henry heard a stir in the quiet air that\nsurrounded them. Walking between the two who loved her, she felt that\nshe was separated from them both by an eternity of experience.\n\nThere were several blocks of Bolingbroke Street to walk before the\nTreadwells' house was reached, and as they sauntered slowly past decayed\ndwellings, Virginia's imagination ran joyously ahead of her to the\nmeeting. Would it happen this time as it had happened before when he\nlooked at her that something would pass between them which would make\nher feel that she belonged to him? So little resistance did she offer to\nthe purpose of Life that she seemed to have existed from the beginning\nmerely as an exquisite medium for a single emotion. It was as if the\ndreams of all the dead women of her race, who had lived only in loving,\nwere concentrated into a single shining centre of bliss--for the\naccumulated vibrations of centuries were in her soul when she trembled\nfor the first time beneath the eyes of a lover. And yet all this\nblissful violence was powerless to change the most insignificant\nexternal fact in the universe. Though it was the greatest thing that\ncould ever happen to her, it was nothing to the other twenty-one\nthousand human beings among whom she lived; it left no mark upon that\nprocession of unimportant details which they called life.\n\nThey were in sight of the small old-fashioned brick house of the\nTreadwells, with its narrow windows set discreetly between outside\nshutters, and she saw that the little marble porch was deserted except\nfor the two pink oleander trees, which stood in green tubs on either\nside of the curved iron railings. A minute later John Henry's\nimperative ring brought a young coloured maid to the door, and Virginia,\nwho had lingered on the pavement, heard almost immediately an effusive\nduet from her mother and Mrs. Treadwell.\n\n\"Oh, do come in, Lucy, just for a minute!\"\n\n\"I can't possibly, my dear; I only wanted to ask you if you have engaged\nMiss Willy Whitlow for the entire week or if you could let me have her\nfor Friday and Saturday? Jinny hasn't a rag to wear to Abby Goode's lawn\nparty and I don't know anybody who does quite so well for her as poor\nMiss Willy. Oh, that's so sweet of you! I can't thank you enough! And\nyou'll tell her without my sending all the way over to Botetourt!\"\n\nBy this time Susan had joined Virginia on the sidewalk, and the liquid\nhoney of Mrs. Pendleton's voice dropped softly into indistinctness.\n\n\"Oh, Jinny, if I'd only known you were coming!\" said Susan. \"Oliver\nwanted me to take him to see you, and when I couldn't, he went over to\ncall on Abby.\"\n\nSo this was the end of her walk winged with expectancy! A disappointment\nas sharp as her joy had been pierced her through as she stood there\nsmiling into Susan's discomfited face. With the tragic power of youth to\ncreate its own torment, she told herself that life could never be the\nsame after this first taste of its bitterness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nFIRST LOVE\n\n\nThe next morning, so indestructible is the happiness of youth, she awoke\nwith her hope as fresh as if it had not been blighted the evening\nbefore. As she lay in bed, with her loosened hair making a cloud over\nthe pillows, and her eyes shining like blue flowers in the band of\nsunlight that fell through the dormer-window, she quivered to the early\nsweetness of honeysuckle as though it were the charmed sweetness of love\nof which she had dreamed in the night. She was only one of the many\nmillions of women who were awaking at the same hour to the same miracle\nof Nature, yet she might have been the first woman seeking the first man\nthrough the vastness and the mystery of an uninhabited earth. Impossible\nto believe that an experience so wonderful was as common as the bursting\nof the spring buds or the humming of the thirsty bees around the\nhoneysuckle arbour!\n\nSlipping out of bed, she threw her dressing-gown over her shoulders, and\nkneeling beside the window, drank in the flower-scented air of the May\nmorning. During the night, the paulownia trees had shed a rain of violet\nblossoms over the wet grass, where little wings of sunshine, like golden\nmoths, hovered above them. Beyond the border of lilies-of-the-valley she\nsaw the squat pinkish tower of the church, and beneath it, in the\nnarrow churchyard, rose the gleaming shaft above the grave of the\nConfederate soldier. On her right, in the centre of the crooked path,\nthree negro infants were prodding earnestly at roots of wire-grass and\ndandelion; and brushing carelessly their huddled figures, her gaze\ndescended the twelve steps of the almost obliterated terrace, and\nfollowed the steep street down which a mulatto vegetable vendor was\nurging his slow-footed mule.\n\nA wave of joy rose in her breast, and she felt that her heart melted in\ngratitude for the divine beauty of life. The world showed to her as a\nplace filled with shining vistas of happiness, and at the end of each of\nthese vistas there awaited the unknown enchanting thing which she called\nin her thoughts \"the future.\" The fact that it was the same world in\nwhich Miss Priscilla and her mother lived their narrow and prosaic lives\ndid not alter by a breath her unshakable conviction that she herself was\npredestined for something more wonderful than they had ever dreamed of.\n\"He may come this evening!\" she thought, and immediately the light of\nmagic suffused the room, the street outside, and every scarred roof in\nDinwiddie.\n\nAt the head of her bed, wedged in between the candle stand and the\nwindow, there was a cheap little bookcase of walnut which contained the\nonly volumes she had ever been permitted to own--the poems of Mrs.\nHemans and of Adelaide Anne Procter, a carefully expurgated edition of\nShakespeare, with an inscription in the rector's handwriting on the\nflyleaf; Miss Strickland's \"Lives of the Queens of England\"; and several\nworks of fiction belonging to the class which Mrs. Pendleton vaguely\ncharacterized as \"sweet stories.\" Among the more prominent of these\nwere \"Thaddeus of Warsaw,\" a complete set of Miss Yonge's novels, with a\nconspicuously tear-stained volume of \"The Heir of Redclyffe,\" and a\nromance or two by obscure but innocuous authors. That any book which\ntold, however mildly, the truth about life should have entered their\ndaughter's bedroom would have seemed little short of profanation to both\nthe rector and Mrs. Pendleton. The sacred shelves of that bookcase\n(which had been ceremoniously presented to her on her fourteenth\nbirthday) had never suffered the contaminating presence of realism. The\nsolitary purpose of art was, in Mrs. Pendleton's eyes, to be \"sweet,\"\nand she scrupulously judged all literature by its success or failure in\nthis particular quality. It seemed to her as wholesome to feed her\ndaughter's growing fancy on an imaginary line of pious heroes, as it\nappeared to her moral to screen her from all suspicion of the existence\nof immorality. She did not honestly believe that any living man\nresembled the \"Heir of Redclyffe,\" any more than she believed that the\npath of self-sacrifice leads inevitably to happiness; but there was no\ndoubt in her mind that she advanced the cause of righteousness when she\ntaught these sanctified fallacies to Virginia.\n\nAs she rose from her knees, Virginia glanced at her white dress, which\nwas too crumpled for her to wear again before it was smoothed, and\nthought regretfully of Aunt Docia's heart, which invariably gave warning\nwhenever there was extra work to be done. \"I shall have to wear either\nmy blue lawn or my green organdie this evening,\" she thought. \"I wish I\ncould have the sleeves changed. I wonder if mother could run a tuck in\nthem?\"\n\nIt did not occur to her that she might smooth the dress herself, because\nshe knew that the iron would be wrested from her by her mother's hands,\nwhich were so knotted and worn that tears came to Virginia's eyes when\nshe looked at them. She let her mother slave over her because she had\nbeen born into a world where the slaving of mothers was a part of the\nnatural order, and she had not as yet become independent enough to\nquestion the morality of the commonplace. At any minute she would gladly\nhave worked, too, but the phrase \"spare Virginia\" had been uttered so\noften in her hearing that it had acquired at last almost a religious\nsignificance. To have been forced to train her daughter in any\nprofitable occupation which might have lifted her out of the class of\nunskilled labour in which indigent gentlewomen by right belonged, would\nhave been the final dregs of humiliation in Mrs. Pendleton's cup. On one\nof Aunt Docia's bad days, when Jinny had begged to be allowed to do part\nof the washing, she had met an almost passionate refusal from her\nmother. \"It will be time enough to spoil your hands after you are\nmarried, darling!\" And again, \"Don't do that rough sewing, Jinny. Give\nit to me.\" From the cradle she had borne her part in this racial custom\nof the sacrifice of generation to generation--of the perpetual\nimmolation of age on the flowery altars of youth. Like most customs in\nwhich we are nurtured, it had seemed natural and pleasant enough until\nshe had watched the hollows deepen in her mother's temples and the\ntireless knotted hands stumble at their work. Then a pang had seized her\nand she had pleaded earnestly to be permitted to help.\n\n\"If you only knew how unhappy it makes me to see you ruining your pretty\nfingers, Jinny. My child, the one comfort I have is the thought that I\nam sparing you.\"\n\nSparing her! Always that from the first! Even Gabriel chimed in when it\nbecame a matter of Jinny. \"Let me wash the dishes, Lucy,\" he would\nimplore. \"What? Will you trust me with other people's souls, but not\nwith your china?\"\n\n\"It's not a man's work, Mr. Pendleton. What would the neighbours think?\"\n\n\"They would think, I hope, my dear, that I was doing my duty.\"\n\n\"But it would not be dignified for a clergyman. No, I cannot bear the\nsight of you with a dishcloth.\"\n\nIn the end she invariably had her way with them, for she was the\nstrongest. Jinny must be spared, and Gabriel must do nothing\nundignified. About herself it made no difference unless the neighbours\nwere looking; she had not thought of herself, except in the indomitable\nfailing of her \"false pride,\" since her marriage, which had taken place\nin her twentieth year. A clergyman's wife might do menial tasks in\nsecret, and nobody minded, but they were not for a clergyman.\n\nFor a minute, while she was dressing, Virginia thought of these\nthings--of how hard life had been to her mother, of how pretty she must\nhave been in her youth. What she did not think of was that her mother,\nlike herself, was but one of the endless procession of women who pass\nperpetually from the sphere of pleasure into the sphere of service. It\nwas as impossible for her to picture her mother as a girl of twenty as\nit was for her to imagine herself ever becoming a woman of fifty.\n\nWhen she had finished dressing she closed the door softly after her as\nif she were afraid of disturbing the silence, and ran downstairs to the\ndining-room, where the rector and Mrs. Pendleton greeted her with\nsubdued murmurs of joy.\n\n\"I was afraid I'd miss you, daughter,\" from the rector, as he drew her\nchair nearer.\n\n\"I was just going to carry up your tray, Jinny,\" from her mother. \"I\nkept a nice breast of chicken for you which one of the neighbours sent\nme.\"\n\n\"I'd so much rather you'd eat it, mother,\" protested Jinny, on the point\nof tears.\n\n\"But I couldn't, darling, I really couldn't manage it. A cup of coffee\nand a bit of toast is all I can possibly stand in the morning. I was up\nearly, for Docia was threatened with one of her heart attacks, and it\nalways gives me a little headache to miss my morning nap.\"\n\n\"Then you can't go to market, Lucy; it is out of the question,\" insisted\nthe rector. \"After thirty years you might as well make up your mind to\ntrust me, my dear.\"\n\n\"But the last time you went you gave away our shoulder of lamb to a\nbeggar,\" replied his wife, and she hastened to add tenderly, lest he\nshould accept the remark as a reproof, \"it's sweet of you, dearest, but\na little walk will be good for my head if I am careful to keep on the\nshady side of the street. I can easily find a boy to bring home the\nthings, and I am sure it won't hurt me a bit.\"\n\n\"Why can't I go, mother?\" implored Virginia. \"Susan always markets for\nMrs. Treadwell.\" And she felt that even the task of marketing was\nirradiated by this inner glow which had changed the common aspect of\nlife.\n\n\"Oh, Jinny, you know how you hate to feel the chickens, and one can\nnever tell how plump they are by the feathers.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll feel them, mother, if you'll let me try.\"\n\n\"No, darling, but you may go with me and carry my sunshade. I'm so sorry\nDocia can't smooth your dress. Was it much crumpled?\"\n\n\"Oh, dreadfully! And I did so want to wear it this evening. Do you think\nAunt Docia could show me how to iron?\"\n\nDocia, who stood like an ebony image of Bellona behind her mistress's\nchair, waving a variegated tissue paper fly screen over the coffee-urn,\nwas heard to think aloud that \"dish yer stitch ain' helt up er blessed\nminute sence befo' daylight.\" Not unnaturally, perhaps, since she was\nthe most prominent figure in her own vision of the universe, she had\ncome at last to regard her recurrent \"stitch\" as an event of greater\nconsequence than Virginia's appearance in immaculate white muslin. An\nuncertain heart combined with a certain temper had elevated her from a\nservile position to one of absolute autocracy in the household.\nEverybody feared her, so nobody had ever dared ask her to leave. As she\nhad rebelled long ago against the badge of a cap and an apron, she\nappeared in the dining-room clad in garments of various hues, and her\ndress on this particular morning was a purple calico crowned\nmajestically by a pink cotton turban. There was a tradition still afloat\nthat Docia had been an excellent servant before the war; but this\namiable superstition had, perhaps, as much reason to support it as had\nGabriel's innocent conviction that there were no faithless husbands when\nthere were no divorces.\n\n\"I'm afraid Docia can't do it,\" sighed Mrs. Pendleton, for her ears had\ncaught the faint thunder of the war goddess behind her chair, and her\nsoul, which feared neither armies nor adversities, trembled before her\nformer slaves. \"But it won't take me a minute if you'll have it ready\nright after dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, of course I couldn't let you for anything. I only thought\nAunt Docia might be able to teach me how to iron.\"\n\nAt this, Docia muttered audibly that she \"ain' got no time ter be\nsho'in' nobody nuttin'.\"\n\n\"There, now, Docia, you mustn't lose your temper,\" observed Gabriel as\nhe rose from his chair. It was at such moments that the remembered joys\nof slavery left a bitter after taste on his lips. Clearly it was\nimpossible to turn into the streets a servant who had once belonged to\nyou!\n\nWhen they were in the hall together, Mrs. Pendleton whispered nervously\nto her husband that it must be \"poor Docia's heart that made her so\ndisagreeable and that she would feel better to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be possible, my dear?\" inquired the rector in his pulpit\nmanner, to which his wife's only answer was a startled \"Sh-sh-ush.\"\n\nAn hour later the door of Gabriel's study opened softly, and Mrs.\nPendleton entered with the humble and apologetic manner in which she\nalways intruded upon her husband's pursuits. There was an accepted\ntheory in the family, shared even by Uncle Isam and Aunt Docia, that\nwhenever Gabriel was left alone for an instant, his thoughts naturally\ndeflected into spiritual paths. In the early days of his marriage he had\ntried honestly to live up to this exalted idea of his character; then\nfinding the effort beyond him, and being a man with an innate\ndetestation of hypocrisy, he had earnestly endeavoured to disabuse his\nwife's imagination of the mistaken belief in his divinity. But a notion\nonce firmly fixed in Mrs. Pendleton's mind might as well have been\nembedded in rock. By virtue of that gentle obstinacy which enabled her\nto believe in an illusion the more intensely because it had vanished,\nshe had triumphed not only over circumstances, but over truth itself. By\nvirtue of this quality, she had created the world in which she moved and\nhad wrought beauty out of chaos.\n\n\"Are you busy with your sermon, dear?\" she asked, pausing in the\ndoorway, and gazing reverently at her husband over the small black silk\nbag she carried. Like the other women of Dinwiddie who had lost\nrelatives by the war, she had never laid aside her mourning since the\nsurrender; and the frame of crape to her face gave her the pensive look\nof one who has stepped out of the pageant of life into the sacred\nshadows of memory.\n\n\"No, no, Lucy, I'm ready to start out with you,\" replied the rector\napologetically, putting a box of fishing tackle he had been sorting back\ninto the drawer of his desk. He was as fond as a child of a day's sport,\nand never quite so happy as when he set out with his rod and an old\ntomato can filled with worms, which he had dug out of the back garden,\nin his hands; but owing to the many calls upon him and his wife's\nconception of his clerical dignity, he was seldom able to gratify his\nnatural tastes.\n\n\"Oh, father, please hurry!\" called Virginia from the porch, and rising\nobediently, he followed Mrs. Pendleton through the hall and out into the\nMay sunshine, where the little negroes stopped an excited chase of a\nblack and orange butterfly to return doggedly to their weeding.\n\n\"Are you sure you wouldn't rather I'd go to market, Lucy?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, dear,\" replied his wife, sniffing the scent of\nlilies-of-the-valley with her delicate, slightly pinched nostrils. \"I\nthought you were going to see Mr. Treadwell about putting John Henry\ninto the bank,\" she added. \"It is such a pity to keep the poor boy\nselling bathtubs. His mother felt it so terribly.\"\n\n\"Ah, so I was--so I was,\" reflected Gabriel, who, though both of them\nwould have been indignant at the suggestion, was as putty in the hands\nof his wife. \"Well, I'll look into the bank on Cyrus after I've paid my\nsick calls.\"\n\nWith that they parted, Gabriel going on to visit a bedridden widow in\nthe Old Ladies' Home, while Mrs. Pendleton and Virginia turned down a\ncross street that led toward the market. At every corner, it seemed to\nVirginia, middle-aged ladies, stout or thin, wearing crape veils and\nholding small black silk bags in their hands, sprang out of the shadows\nof mulberry trees, and barred their leisurely progress. And though\nnothing had happened in Dinwiddie since the war, and Mrs. Pendleton had\nseen many of these ladies the day before, she stopped for a sympathetic\nchat with each one of them, while Virginia, standing a little apart,\npatiently prodded the cinders of the walk with the end of her sunshade.\nAll her life the girl had been taught to regard time as the thing of\nleast importance in the universe; but occasionally, while she listened\nin silence to the liquid murmur of her mother's voice, she wondered\nvaguely how the day's work was ever finished in Dinwiddie. The story of\nDocia's impertinence was told and retold a dozen times before they\nreached the market. \"And you really mean that you can't get rid of her?\nWhy, my dear Lucy, I wouldn't stand it a day! Now, there was my Mandy.\nSuch an excellent servant until she got her head turned----\" This from\nMrs. Tom Peachey, an energetic little woman, with a rosy face and a\nstraight gray \"bang\" cut short over her eyebrows. \"But, Lucy, my child,\nare you doing right to submit to impertinence? In the old days, I\nremember, before the war----\" This from Mrs. William Goode, who had been\nSally Peterson, the beauty of Dinwiddie, and who was still superbly\nhandsome in a tragic fashion, with a haunted look in her eyes and masses\nof snow-white hair under her mourning bonnet. Years ago Virginia had\nimagined her as dwelling perpetually with the memory of her young\nhusband, who had fallen in his twenty-fifth year in the Battle of Cold\nHarbor, but she knew now that the haunted eyes, like all things human,\nwere under the despotism of trifles. To the girl, who saw in this\nuniversal acquiescence in littleness merely the pitiful surrender of\nfeeble souls, there was a passionate triumph in the thought that her own\ndreams were larger than the actuality that surrounded her. Youth's scorn\nof the narrow details of life left no room in her mind for an\nunderstanding of the compromise which middle-age makes with necessity.\nThe pathos of resignation--of that inevitable submission to the petty\npowers which the years bring--was lost upon the wistful ignorance of\ninexperience. While she waited dutifully, with her absent gaze fixed on\nthe old mulberry trees, which whitened as the wind blew over them and\nthen slowly darkened again, she wondered if servants and gossip were the\nonly things that Oliver had heard of in his travels? Then she remembered\nthat even in Dinwiddie men were less interested in such matters than\nthey were in the industries of peanuts and tobacco. Was it only women,\nafter all, who were in subjection to particulars?\n\nWhen they turned into Old Street, John Henry hailed them from the\ndoorway of a shop, where he stood flanked by a row of spotless bathtubs.\nHe wore a loose pongee coat, which sagged at the shoulders, his straight\nflaxen hair had been freshly cut, and his crimson necktie had got a\nstain on it at breakfast; but to Virginia's astonishment, he appeared\nsublimely unconscious both of his bathtubs and his appearance. He was\ndoubtless under the delusion that a pongee coat, being worn for comfort,\nwas entirely successful when it achieved that end; and as for his\nbusiness, it was beyond his comprehension that a Pendleton could have\nreason to blush for a bathtub or for any other object that afforded him\nan honest livelihood.\n\nHe called to them at sight, and Mrs. Pendleton, following her instinct\nof fitness, left the conversation to youth.\n\n\"John Henry, father is going to see Mr. Treadwell about the place in the\nbank. Won't it be lovely if he gives it to you!\"\n\n\"He won't,\" replied John Henry. \"I'll bet you anything he's keeping it\nfor his nephew.\"\n\nVirginia's blush came quickly, and turning her head away, she gazed\nearnestly down the street to the octagonal market, which stood on the\nspot where slaves were offered for sale when she was born.\n\n\"Mr. Treadwell is crossing the street now,\" she said after a minute. \"I\nwonder why he keeps his mouth shut so tight when he is alone?\"\n\nA covered cart, which had been passing slowly, moved up the hill, and\nfrom beyond it there appeared the tall spare figure of a man with\niron-gray hair, curling a little on the temples, a sallow skin,\nsplotched with red over the nose, and narrow colourless lips that looked\nas if they were cut out of steel. As he walked quickly up the street,\nevery person whom he passed turned to glance after him.\n\n\"I wonder if it is true that he hasn't made his money honestly?\" asked\nVirginia.\n\n\"Oh, I hope not!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pendleton, who in her natural desire to\nbelieve only good about people was occasionally led into believing the\ntruth.\n\n\"Well, I don't care,\" retorted Virginia, \"he's mean. I know just by the\nway his wife dresses.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jinny!\" gasped Mrs. Pendleton, and glanced in embarrassment at her\nnephew, whose face, to her surprise, was beaming with enjoyment. The\ntruth was that John Henry, who would have condemned so unreasonable an\naccusation had it been uttered by a full-grown male, was enraptured by\nthe piquancy of hearing it on the lovely lips of his cousin. To demand\nthat a pretty woman should possess the mental responsibility of a human\nbeing would have seemed an affront to his inherited ideas of gallantry.\nHis slow wit was enslaved by Jinny's audacity as completely as his kind\nox-like eyes were enthralled by the young red and white of her beauty.\n\n\"But he's a great man. You can't deny that,\" he said with the playful\nmanner in which he might have prodded a kitten in order to make it claw.\n\n\"A great man! Just because he has made money!\"\n\n\"Well, he couldn't have got rich, you know, if he hadn't had the sense\nto see how to do it,\" replied the young man with enthusiasm. Like most\nSoutherners who had been forced without preparation into the hard school\nof industry, he had found that his standards followed inevitably the\nchanging measure of his circumstances. From his altered point of view,\nthe part of owing property appeared so easy, and the part of winning it\nso difficult, that his respect for culture had yielded almost\nunconsciously to his admiration for commerce. When the South came again\nto the front, he felt instinctively that it would come, shorn of its\ntraditional plumage, a victor from the hard-fought industrial\nbattlefields of the century; and because Cyrus Treadwell led the way\ntoward this triumph, he was ready to follow him. Of the whole town, this\ngrim, half legendary figure (passionately revered and as passionately\nhated) appeared to him to stand alone not for the decaying past, but for\nthe growing future. The stories of the too rapid development of the\nTreadwell fortune he cast scornfully aside as the malicious slanders of\nfailure. What did all this tittle-tattle about a great man prove anyhow\nexcept his greatness? Suppose he _had_ used his railroad to make a\nfortune--well, but for him where would the Dinwiddie and Central be\nto-day if not in the junk shop? Where would the lumber market be? the\ncotton market? the tobacco market? For around Cyrus, standing alone and\nsolitary on his height, there had gathered the great illusion that\nmakes theft honest and falsehood truth--the illusion of Success; and\nsimple John Henry Pendleton, who, after nineteen years of poverty and\nmemory, was bereft alike of classical pedantry and of physical comforts,\nhad grown a little weary of the endless lip-worship of a single moment\nin history. Granted even that it was the greatest moment the world had\nseen, still why couldn't one be satisfied to have it take its place\nbeside the wars of the Spartans and of the ancient Britons? Perpetual\nmourning was well enough for ladies in crape veils and heroic gentlemen\non crutches; but when your bread and meat depended not upon the graves\nyou had decorated, but upon the bathtubs you had sold, surely something\ncould be said for the Treadwell point of view.\n\nAs Virginia could find no answer to this remark, the three stood in\nsilence, gazing dreamily, with three pairs of Pendleton eyes, down\ntoward the site of the old slave market. Directly in their line of\nvision, an over-laden mule with a sore shoulder was straining painfully\nunder the lash, but none of them saw it, because each of them was\nmorally incapable of looking an unpleasant fact in the face if there was\nany honourable manner of avoiding it. What they beheld, indeed, was the\nmost interesting street in the world, filled with the most interesting\npeople, who drove happy animals that enjoyed their servitude and needed\nthe sound of the lash to add cheer and liveliness to their labours.\nNever had the Pendleton idealism achieved a more absolute triumph over\nthe actuality.\n\n\"Well, we must go on,\" murmured Mrs. Pendleton, withdrawing her\nvisionary gaze from the hot street littered with fruit rinds and\nblood-stained papers from a neighbouring butcher shop. \"It was lovely\nto have this glimpse of you, John Henry. What nice bathtubs you have!\"\nSmiling her still lovely smile into the young man's eyes, she proceeded\non her leisurely way, while Virginia raised the black silk sunshade over\nher head. In front of them they could see long rows of fish-carts and\nvegetable stalls around which hovered an army of eager housekeepers. The\nsocial hours in Dinwiddie at that period were the early morning ones in\nthe old market, and Virginia knew that she should hear Docia's story\nrepeated again for the benefit of the curious or sympathetic listeners\nthat would soon gather about her mother. Mrs. Pendleton's marketing,\nunlike the hurried and irresponsible sort of to-day, was an affair of\ntime and ceremony. Among the greetings and the condolences from other\nmarketers there would ensue lengthy conversations with the vendors of\npoultry, of fish, or of vegetables. Every vegetable must be carefully\nselected by her own hands and laid aside into her special basket, which\nwas in the anxious charge of a small coloured urchin. While she felt the\nplump breasts of Mr. Dewlap's chickens, she would inquire with\nflattering condescension after the members of Mr. Dewlap's family. Not\nonly did she remember each one of them by name, but she never forgot\neither the dates of their birthdays or the number of turkeys Mrs. Dewlap\nhad raised in a season. If marketing is ever to be elevated from an\noccupation to an art, it will be by a return to Mrs. Pendleton's method.\n\n\"Mother, please buy some strawberries,\" begged Virginia.\n\n\"Darling, you know we never buy fruit, or desserts. Somebody will\ncertainly send us something. I saw Mrs. Carrington whipping syllabub on\nher back porch as we passed.\"\n\n\"But they're only five cents a basket.\"\n\n\"Well, put a basket with my marketing, Mr. Dewlap. Yes, I'll take that\nwhite pullet if you're sure that she is plumper than the red one.\"\n\nShe moved on a step or two, while the white pullet was handed over by\nits feet to the small coloured urchin and to destruction. If Mrs.\nPendleton had ever reflected on the tragic fate of pullets, she would\nprobably have concluded that it was \"best\" for them to be fried and\neaten, or Providence, whose merciful wisdom she never questioned, would\nnot have permitted it. So, in the old days, she had known where the\nslave market stood, without realizing in the least that men and women\nwere sold there. \"Poor things, it does seem dreadful, but I suppose it\nis better for them to have a change sometimes,\" she would doubtless have\nreasoned had the horror of the custom ever occurred to her--for her\nheart was so sensitive to pain that she could exist at all only by\ninventing a world of exquisite fiction around her.\n\n\"Aren't you nearly through, mother?\" pleaded Virginia at last. \"The sun\nwill be so hot going home that it will make your head worse.\"\n\nMrs. Pendleton, who was splitting a pea-shell with her thumb in order to\nascertain the size and quality of the peas, murmured soothingly, \"Just a\nminute, dear\"; and the girl, finding it impossible to share her mother's\nenthusiasm for slaughtered animals, fell back again into the narrow\nshade of the stalls. She revolted with a feeling of outrage against the\nside of life that confronted her--against the dirty floor, strewn with\nwithered vegetables above which flies swarmed incessantly, and against\nthe pathos of the small bleeding forms which seemed related neither to\nthe lamb in the fields nor to the Sunday roast on the table. That divine\ngift of evasion, which enabled Mrs. Pendleton to see only the thing she\nwanted to see in every occurrence, was but partially developed as yet in\nVirginia; and while she stood there in the midst of her unromantic\nsurroundings, the girl shuddered lest Oliver Treadwell should know that\nshe had ever waited, hot, perspiring, with a draggled skirt, and a bag\nof tomatoes grasped in her hands, while her mother wandered from stall\nto stall in a tireless search for peas a few cents cheaper than those of\nMr. Dewlap. Youth, with its ingenuous belief that love dwells in\nexternal circumstances, was protesting against the bland assumption of\nage that love creates its own peculiar circumstances out of itself. It\nwas absurd, she knew, to imagine that her father's affection for her\nmother would alter because she haggled over the price of peas; yet the\nemotion with which she endowed Oliver Treadwell was so delicate and\nelusive that she felt that the sight of a soiled skirt and a perspiring\nface would blast it forever. It appeared imperative that he should see\nher in white muslin, and she resolved that if it cost Docia her life she\nwould have the flounces of her dress smoothed before evening. She, who\nwas by nature almost morbidly sensitive to suffering, became, in the\nhands of this new and implacable power, as ruthless as Fate.\n\n\"Now I'm ready, Jinny dear. Are you tired waiting?\" asked Mrs.\nPendleton, coming toward her with the coloured urchin in her train.\n\"Why, there's Susan Treadwell. Have you spoken to her?\"\n\nThe next instant, before the startled girl could turn, a voice cried out\ntriumphantly: \"O Jinny!\" and in front of her, looking over Susan's\nshoulder, she saw the eager eyes and the thin, high-coloured face of\nOliver Treadwell. For a moment she told herself that he had read her\nthoughts with his penetrating gaze, which seemed to pierce through her;\nand she blushed pink while her eyes burned under her trembling lashes.\nThen the paper bag, containing the tomatoes, burst in her hands, and its\ncontents rolled, one by one, over the littered floor to his feet. Both\nstooped at once to recover it, and while their hands touched amid wilted\ncabbage leaves, the girl felt that love had taken gilded wings and\ndeparted forever!\n\n\"Put them in the basket, dear,\" Mrs. Pendleton could be heard saying\ncalmly in the midst of her daughter's agony--for, having lived through\nthe brief illumination of romance, she had come at last into that steady\nglow which encompasses the commonplace.\n\n\"This is my cousin Oliver, Virginia,\" remarked Susan as casually as if\nthe meeting of the two had not been planned from all eternity by the\nbeneficent Powers.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've spoiled your nice red tomatoes,\" said a voice that\nfilled Virginia's whirling mind with a kind of ecstatic dizziness. As\nthe owner of the voice held out his hand, she saw that it was long and\nthin like the rest of him, with blue veins crossing the back, and\nslender, slightly crooked fingers that hurt hers with the strength of\ntheir pressure. \"To confess the truth,\" he added gaily after an instant,\n\"my breath was quite taken away because, somehow, this was the last\nplace on earth in which I expected to find you. It's a dreadful\nspot--don't you think so? If we've got to be cannibals, why in Heaven's\nname make a show and a parade of it?\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary young man!\" said Mrs. Pendleton's eyes; and\nVirginia found herself blushing again because she felt that her mother\nhad not understood him. A delicious embarrassment--something different\nand more vivid than any sensation she had ever known--held her\nspeechless while he looked at her. Had her life depended on it, she\ncould not have uttered a sentence--could hardly even have lifted her\nlashes, which seemed suddenly to have become so heavy that she felt the\nburden of them weighing over her eyes. All the picturesque phrases she\nhad planned to speak at their first meeting had taken wings with\nperfidious romance, yet she would have given her dearest possession to\nhave been able to say something really clever. \"He thinks me a\nsimpleton, of course,\" she thought--perfectly unconscious that Oliver\nwas not thinking of her wits at all, but of the wonderful rose-pink of\nher flesh. At one and the same instant, she felt that this silence was\nthe most marvellous thing that had ever happened to her and longed to\nbreak it with some speech so brilliant that he would never forget it.\nLittle thrills of joy, like tiny flames, ran over her, and the light in\nher eyes shone on him through the quivering dusk of her lashes. Even\nwhen she looked away from him, she could still see his expression of\ntender gaiety, as though he were trying in vain to laugh himself free\nfrom an impulse that was fast growing too strong for him. What she did\nnot know was that the spring was calling to him through her youth and\nsex as it was calling through the scented winds and the young buds on\nthe trees. She was as ignorant that she offered herself to him through\nher velvet softness, through the glow in her eyes, through her quivering\nlips, as the flower is that it allures the bee by its perfume. So subtly\ndid Life use her for its end that the illusion of choice in first love\nremained unimpaired. Though she was young desire incarnate, he saw in\nher only the unique and solitary woman of his dreams.\n\n\"Do you come here every day?\" he asked, and immediately the blue sky and\nthe octagonal market spun round at his voice.\n\nAs nothing but commonplace words would come to her, she was obliged at\nlast to utter them. \"Oh, no, not every day.\"\n\n\"I've always had a tremendous sympathy for women because they have to\nmarket and housekeep. I wonder if they won't revolt some time?\"\n\nThis was so heretical a point of view that she tried earnestly to\ncomprehend it; but all the time her heart was busy telling her how\ndifferent he was from every other man--how much more interesting! how\nimmeasurably superior! Her attention, in spite of her efforts at serious\nthought, would not wander from the charm of his voice, from the peculiar\nwhimsical trick of his smile, which lifted his mouth at one corner and\nmade odd little wrinkles come and go about his eyes. His manner was full\nof sudden nervous gestures which surprised and enchanted her. All other\nmen were not merely as clay beside him--they were as straw! Seeing that\nhe was waiting for a response, she made a violent endeavour to think of\none, and uttered almost inaudibly: \"But don't they like it?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's just it,\" he answered as seriously as if she hadn't known\nthat her speech bordered on imbecility. \"Do they really like it? or have\nthey been throwing dust in our eyes through the centuries?\" And he gazed\nat her as eagerly as if he were hanging upon her answer. Oh, if she\ncould only say something clever! If she could only say the sort of thing\nthat would shock Miss Priscilla! But nothing came of her wish, and she\nwas reduced at last to the pathetic rejoinder, \"I don't know. I'm afraid\nI've never thought about it.\"\n\nFor a moment he stared at her as though he were enraptured by her reply.\nWith such eyes and such hair, she might have been as simple as she\nappeared and he would never have known it. \"Of course you haven't, or\nyou wouldn't be you!\" he responded; and by the time she came to her\nsenses, she was following her mother and the negro urchin out of the\nmarket. Though she was in reality walking over cinders, she felt that\nher feet were treading on golden air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE TREADWELLS\n\n\nAbove the Dinwiddie of Virginia's girlhood, rising sharply out of the\nsmoothly blended level of personalities, there towered, as far back as\nshe could remember, the grim and yet strangely living figure of Cyrus\nTreadwell. From the intimate social life of the town he had remained\nimmovably detached; but from the beginning it had been impossible for\nthat life to ignore him. Among a people knit by a common pulse, yet\nseparated by a multitude of individual differences, he stood aloof and\nindispensable, like one of the gaunt iron bridges of his great railroad.\nHe was at once the destroyer and the builder--the inexorable foe of the\nold feudal order and the beneficent source of the new industrialism.\nThough half of Dinwiddie hated him, the other half (hating him, perhaps\nnone the less) ate its bread from his hands. The town, which had lived,\nfought, lost, and suffered not as a group of individuals, but as a\npsychological unit, had surrendered at last, less to the idea of\nreadjustment than to the indomitable purpose of a single mind.\n\nAnd yet nobody in Dinwiddie, not even Miss Willy Whitlow, who sewed out\nby the day, and knew the intimate structure of every skeleton in every\ncloset of the town--nobody could tell the precise instant at which Cyrus\nhad ceased to be an ordinary man and become a great one. A phrase,\nwhich had started as usual, \"The Mr. Treadwell, you know, who married\npoor Belinda Bolingbroke--\" swerved suddenly to \"Cyrus Treadwell told me\nthat, and you must admit that _he_ knows what he is talking about\"--and\na reputation was made! His marriage to \"poor Belinda,\" which had at\nfirst appeared to be the most conspicuous fact in his career, dwindled\nto insignificance beside the rebuilding of the tobacco industry and his\nimmediate elevation to the vacant presidency of one of the Machlin\nrailroads.\n\nIt was true that in the meantime he had fought irreproachably, but\nwithout renown, through a number of battles; and returning to a\nvanquished and ruined city, had found himself still young enough to go\nto school again in matters of finance. Whether he had learned from\nAntrum, the despised carpet-bagger for Machlin & Company, or had taken\nhis instructions at first hand from the great Machlin himself, was in\nthe eighties an open question in Dinwiddie. The choice was probably\ngiven him to learn or starve; and aided by the keen understanding and\nthe acute sense of property he had inherited from his Scotch-Irish\nparentage, he had doubtless decided that to learn was, after all, the\neasier way. Saving he had always been, and yet with such strange and\nsudden starts of generosity that he had been known to seek out distant\nobscure maiden relatives and redeem the mortgaged roof over their heads.\nHis strongest instinct, which was merely an attenuated shoot from his\nsupreme feeling for possessions, was that of race, though he had\nestranged both his son and his daughter by his stubborn conviction that\nhe was not doing his duty by them except when he was making their lives\na burden. For, as with most men who have suffered in their youth under\noppression, his ambition was not so much to relieve the oppressed as to\nbecome in his turn the oppressor. Owing, perhaps, to his fine\nScotch-Irish blood, which ran a little muddy in his veins, he had never\nlost a certain primitive feeling of superstition, like the decaying root\nof a religious instinct; and he was as strict in his attendance upon\nchurch as he was loose in applying the principles of Christianity to his\ndaily life. Sunday was vaguely associated in his mind with such popular\nfetiches as a frock coat and a roast of beef; and if the roast had been\nabsent from dinner, he would have felt precisely the same indefinite\ndisquietude that troubled him when the sermon was left out of the\nservice. So completely did his outward life shape itself around the\ninner structure of his thought, that, except for the two days of the\nweek which he spent with unfailing regularity in Wall Street, he might\nhave been said to live only in his office. Once when his doctor had\nprescribed exercise for a slight dyspepsia, he had added a few\nadditional blocks to his morning and evening walk, and it was while he\nwas performing this self-inflicted penance that he came upon Gabriel,\nwho was hastening toward him in behalf of John Henry.\n\nFor an instant a gleam of light shone on Cyrus's features, and they\nstood out, palely illuminated, like the features of a bronze statue\nabove which a torch suddenly flares. His shoulders, which stooped until\nhis coat had curved in the back, straightened themselves with a jerk,\nwhile he held out his hand, on which an old sabre cut was still visible.\nThis faded scar had always seemed to Gabriel the solitary proof that\nthe great man was created of flesh and blood.\n\n\"I've come about a little matter of business,\" began the rector in an\napologetic tone, for in Cyrus's presence he was never without an uneasy\nfeeling that the problems of the spirit were secondary to the problems\nof finance.\n\n\"Well, I'm just going into the office. Come in and sit down. I'm glad to\nsee you. You bring back the four happiest years of my life, Gabriel.\"\n\n\"And of mine, too. It's queer, isn't it, how the savage seems to sleep\nin the most peaceable of men? We were half starved in those days, half\nnaked, and without the certainty that we'd live until sunset--but,\ndreadful as it sounds, I was happier then--God help me!--than I've ever\nbeen before or since.\"\n\nPassing through an outer office, where a number of young men were\nbending over ledgers, they entered Cyrus's private room, and sat down in\ntwo plain pine chairs under the coloured lithograph of an engine which\nornamented the largest space on the wall. The room was bare of the most\nordinary comforts, as though its owner begrudged the few dollars he must\nspend to improve his surroundings.\n\n\"Well, those days are over, and you say it's business that you've come\nabout?\" retorted Cyrus, not rudely, but with the manner of a man who\nseldom wastes words and whose every expenditure either of time or of\nmoney must achieve some definite result.\n\n\"Yes, it's business.\" The rector's tone had chilled a little, and he\nadded in spite of his judgment, \"I'm afraid it's a favour. Everybody\ncomes begging to you, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Then, it's the Sunday-school picnic, I reckon. I haven't forgotten it.\nSmithson!\" An alert young man appeared at the door. \"Make a note that\nMr. Pendleton wants coaches for the Saint James' Church picnic on the\ntwenty-ninth. You said twenty-ninth, didn't you, Gabriel?\"\n\n\"If the weather's good,\" replied Gabriel meekly, and then as Smithson\nwithdrew, he glanced nervously at the lithograph of the engine. \"But it\nwasn't about the picnic that I came,\" he said. \"The fact is, I wanted to\nask you to use your influence in the matter of getting John Henry a\nplace in the bank. He has done very well at the night school, and I\nbelieve that you would find him entirely satisfactory.\"\n\nAt the first mention of the bank, a look of distrust crept into Cyrus's\nface--a look cautious, alert, suspicious, such as he wore at directors'\nmeetings when there was a chance that something might be got out of him\nif for a minute he were to go off his guard.\n\n\"I feel a great responsibility for him,\" resumed Gabriel almost sternly,\nthough he was painfully aware that his assurance had deserted him.\n\n\"Why don't you go to James? James is the one to see about such a\nmatter.\"\n\nIf the rector had spoken the thought in his mind, he would have\nanswered, \"Because James reminds me of a fish and I can't abide him\";\nbut instead, he replied simply, \"I know James so slightly that I don't\nfeel in a position to ask a favour of him.\"\n\nThe expression of suspicion left Cyrus's face, and he relaxed from the\nstrained attitude in which he had sat ever since the Sunday-school\npicnic had been dismissed from the conversation. Leaning back in his\nchair, he drew two cigars from the pocket of his coat, and after\nglancing a little reluctantly at them both, offered one to the rector.\n\"I believe he really wanted me to refuse it!\" flashed through Gabriel's\nmind like an arrow--though the other's hesitation had been, in fact,\nonly an unconscious trick of manner which he had acquired during the\nlong lean years when he had fattened chiefly by not giving away. The\ngift of a cigar could mean nothing to a man who willingly contributed to\nevery charity in town, but the trivial gestures that accompany one's\nearly habits occasionally outlast the peculiar circumstances from which\nthey spring.\n\nFor a few minutes they smoked in silence. Then Cyrus remarked in his\nprecise voice: \"James is a clever fellow--a clever fellow.\"\n\n\"I've heard that he is as good as right hand to you. That's a fine thing\nto say of a son.\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't know what I should do without James. He's a saving hand,\nand, I tell you, there are more fortunes made by saving than by\ngambling.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think James need ever give you any concern on that\naccount,\" replied Gabriel, not without gentle satire, for he recalled\nseveral unpleasant encounters with the younger Treadwell on the subject\nof charity. \"But I've heard different tales of that nephew of yours who\nhas just come back from God knows what country.\"\n\n\"He's Henry's son,\" replied Cyrus with a frown. \"You haven't forgotten\nHenry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember. Henry and George both went out to Australia to open\nthe tobacco market, and Henry died poor while George lived and got rich,\nI believe?\"\n\n\"George kept free of women and attended to his affairs,\" returned Cyrus,\nwho was as frank about his family as he was secretive about his\nbusiness.\n\n\"But what about Henry's son? He's a promising chap, isn't he?\"\n\n\"It depends upon what you call promising, I reckon. Before he came I\nthought of putting him into the bank, but since I've seen him, I can't,\nfor the life of me, think of anything to do with him. Unless, of course,\nyou could see your way toward taking him into the ministry,\" he\nconcluded with sardonic humour.\n\n\"His views on theology would prevent that, I fear,\" replied the rector,\nwhile all the kindly little wrinkles leaped out around his eyes.\n\n\"Views? What do anybody's views matter who can't make a living? But to\ntell the truth, there's something about him that I don't trust. He isn't\nlike Henry, so he must take after that pretty fool Henry married. Now,\nif he had James's temper, I could make something out of him, but he's\ndifferent--he's fly-up-the-creek--he's as flighty as a woman.\"\n\nGabriel, who had been a little cheered to learn that the young man, with\nall his faults, did not resemble James, hastened to assure Cyrus that\nthere might be some good in the boy, after all--that he was only\ntwenty-two, and that, in any case, it was too soon to pass judgment.\n\n\"I can't stand his talk,\" returned the other grimly. \"I've never heard\nanybody but a preacher--I beg your pardon, Gabriel, nothing\npersonal!--who could keep going so long when nobody was listening. A\nmere wind-bag, that's what he is, with a lot of nonsensical ideas about\nhis own importance. If there wasn't a girl in the house, it would be no\ngreat matter, but that Susan of mine is so headstrong that I'm half\nafraid she'll get crazy and imagine she's fallen in love with him.\"\n\nThis proof of parental anxiety touched Gabriel in his tenderest spot.\nAfter all, though Cyrus had a harsh surface, there was much good at the\nbottom of him. \"I can enter into your feelings about that,\" he answered\nsympathetically, \"though my Jinny, I am sure, would never allow herself\nto think seriously about a man without first asking my opinion of him.\"\n\n\"Then you're fortunate,\" commented Cyrus dryly, \"for I don't believe\nSusan would give a red cent for what I'd think if she once took a fancy.\nShe'd as soon elope with that wild-eyed scamp as eat her dinner, if it\nonce entered her head.\"\n\nA knock came at the door, and Smithson entered and conferred with his\nemployer over a telegram, while Gabriel rose to his feet.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Cyrus, turning abruptly from his secretary and\nstopping the rector as he was about to pass out of the door, \"I was just\nwondering if you remembered the morning after Lee's surrender, when we\nstarted home on the road together?\"\n\n\"Why, yes.\" There was a note of surprise in Gabriel's answer, for he\nremembered, also, that he had sold his watch a little later in the day\nto a Union soldier, and had divided the eighty dollars with Cyrus. For\nan instant, he almost believed that the other was going to allude for\nthe first time to that incident.\n\n\"Well, I've never forgotten that green persimmon tree by the roadside,\"\npursued the great man, \"and the way you stopped under it and said, 'O\nLord, wilt Thou not work a miracle and make persimmons ripen in the\nspring?'\"\n\n\"No, I'd forgotten it,\" rejoined Gabriel coolly, for he was hurt by the\npiece of flippancy and was thinking the worst of Cyrus again.\n\n\"You'd forgotten it? Well, I've a long memory, and I never forget.\nThat's one thing you may count on me for,\" he added, \"a good memory. As\nfor John Henry--I'll see James about it. I'll see what James has to\nsay.\"\n\nWhen Gabriel had gone, accompanied as far as the outer door by the\nsecretary, Cyrus turned back to the window, and stood gazing over a\nsteep street or two, and past the gabled roof of an old stone house, to\nwhere in the distance the walls of the new building of the Treadwell\nTobacco Company were rising. Around the skeleton structure he could see\nthe workmen moving like ants, while in a widening circle of air the\nsmoke of other factories floated slowly upward under a brazen sky.\n\"There are too many of them,\" he thought bitterly. \"It's competition\nthat kills. There are too many of them.\"\n\nSo rapt was his look while he stood there that there came into his face\nan expression of yearning sentiment that made it almost human. Then his\ngaze wandered to the gleaming tracks of the two great railroads which\nran out of Dinwiddie toward the north, uncoiling their length like\nserpents between the broad fields sprinkled with the tender green of\nyoung crops. Beside them trailed the ashen country roads over which\nfarmers were crawling with their covered wagons; but, while Cyrus\nwatched from his height, there was as little thought in his mind for the\nmen who drove those wagons through the parching dust as for the beasts\nthat drew them. It is possible even that he did not see them, for just\nas Mrs. Pendleton's vision eliminated the sight of suffering because her\nheart was too tender to bear it, so he overlooked all facts except those\nwhich were a part of the dominant motive of his life. Nearer still,\nwithin the narrow board fences which surrounded the backyards of negro\nhovels, under the moving shadows of broad-leaved mulberry or sycamore\ntrees, he gazed down on the swarms of mulatto children; though to his\nmind that problem, like the problem of labour, loomed vague, detached,\nand unreal--a thing that existed merely in the air, not in the concrete\nimages that he could understand.\n\n\"Well, it's a pity Gabriel never made more of himself,\" he thought\nkindly. \"Yes, it's a pity. I'll see what I can do for him.\"\n\nAt six o'clock that evening, when the end of his business day had come,\nhe joined James at the door for his walk back to Bolingbroke Street.\n\n\"Have you done anything about Jones's place in the bank?\" was the first\nquestion he asked after his abrupt nod of greeting.\n\n\"No, sir. I thought you were waiting to find out about Oliver.\"\n\n\"Then you thought wrong. The fellow's a fool. Look up that nephew of\nGabriel Pendleton, and see if he is fit for the job. I am sorry Jones is\ndead,\" he added with a touch of feeling. \"I remember I got him that\nplace the year after the war, and I never knew him to be ten minutes\nlate during all the time that I worked with him.\"\n\n\"But what are we to do with Oliver?\" inquired James after a pause. \"Of\ncourse he wouldn't be much good in the bank, but----\"\n\nAnd without finishing his sentence, he glanced up in a tentative,\nnon-committal manner into Cyrus's face. He was a smaller and somewhat\nimperfect copy of his father, naturally timid, and possessed of a\nsuperstitious feeling that he should die in an accident. His thin an\u00c3\u00a6mic\nfeatures lacked the strength of the Treadwells, though in his cautious\nand taciturn way he was very far indeed from being the fool people\ngenerally thought him. Since he had never loved anything with passion\nexcept money, he was regarded by his neighbours as a man of\nunimpeachable morality.\n\nAt the end of the block, while the long pointed shadows of their feet\nkept even pace on the stone crossing, Cyrus answered abruptly: \"Put him\nanywhere out of my sight. I can't bear the look of him.\"\n\n\"How would you like to give him something to do on the road? Put him\nunder Borrows, for instance, and let him learn a bit about freight?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't care. Only don't let me see him--he turns my stomach.\"\n\n\"Then as long as we've got to support him, I'll tell him he may try his\nhand at the job of assistant freight agent, if he wants to earn his\nkeep.\"\n\n\"He'll never do that--just as well put him down under 'waste,' and have\ndone with him,\" replied Cyrus, chuckling.\n\nA little girl, rolling a hoop, tripped and fell at his feet, and he\nnodded at her kindly, for he had a strong physical liking for children,\nthough he had never stopped to think about them in a human or personal\nway. He had, indeed, never stopped to think about anything except the\nabsorbing problem of how to make something out of nothing. Everything\nelse, even his marriage, had made merely a superficial impression upon\nhim. What people called his \"luck\" was only the relentless pursuit of an\nidea; and in this pursuit all other sides of his nature had been sapped\nof energy. From the days when he had humbly accepted small commissions\nfrom the firm of Machlin & Company, to the last few years, when he had\ncome to be regarded almost superstitiously as the saviour of sinking\nproperties, he had moved quietly, cautiously, and unswervingly in one\ndirection. The blighting panic of ten years before had hardly touched\nhim, so softly had he ventured, and so easy was it for him to return to\nhis little deals and his diet of crumbs. They were bad times, those\nyears, alike for rich and poor, for Northerner and Southerner; but in\nthe midst of crashing firms and noiseless factories, he had cut down his\nhousehold expenses to a pittance and had gone on as secretively as\never--waiting, watching, hoping, until the worst was over and Machlin &\nCompany had found their man. Then, a little later, with the invasion of\nthe cigarette, there went up the new Treadwell factory which the subtle\nminded still attributed to the genius of Cyrus. Even before George and\nHenry had sailed for Australia, the success of the house in Dinwiddie\nwas assured. There was hardly a drug store in America in those days that\ndid not offer as its favourite James's crowning triumph, the Magnolia\ncigarette. A few years later, competition came like a whirlwind, but in\nthe beginning the Treadwell brand held the market alone, and in those\nfew years Cyrus's fortune was made.\n\n\"Heard from George lately?\" he inquired, when they had traversed,\naccompanied by their long and narrow shadows, another couple of blocks.\nThe tobacco trade had always been for him merely a single pawn in the\nsplendid game he was playing, but he had suspected recently that James\nfelt something approaching a sentiment for the Magnolia cigarette, and\ntrue to the Treadwell scorn of romance, he was forever trying to trick\nhim into an admission of guilt.\n\n\"Not since that letter I showed you a month ago,\" answered James. \"Too\nmuch competition, that's the story everywhere. They are flooding the\nmarket with cigarettes, and if it wasn't for the way the Magnolia holds\non, we'd be swamped in little or no time.\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon the Claypole would pull us through,\" commented Cyrus.\nThe Claypole was an old brand of plug tobacco with which the first\nTreadwell factory had started. \"But you're right about competition. It's\ngot to stop or we'll be driven clean out of the business.\"\n\nHe drew out his latchkey as he spoke, for they had reached the corner of\nBolingbroke Street, and the small dingy house in which they lived was\nonly a few doors away. As they passed between the two blossoming\noleanders in green tubs on the sidewalk, James glanced up at the flat\nsquare roof, and observed doubtfully, \"You'll be getting out of this old\nplace before long now, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Oh, someday, someday,\" answered Cyrus. \"There'll be time enough when\nthe market settles and we can see where the money is coming from.\"\n\nOnce every year, in the spring, James asked his father this question,\nand once every year he received exactly the same answer. In his mind,\nCyrus was always putting off the day when he should move into a larger\nhouse, for though he got richer every week, he never seemed to get quite\nrich enough to commit himself to any definite change in his\ncircumstances. Of course, in the nature of things, he knew that he ought\nto have left Bolingbroke Street long ago; there was hardly a family\nstill living there with whom his daughter associated, and she complained\ndaily of having to pass saloons and barber shops whenever she went out\nof doors. But the truth was that in spite of his answer to James's\nannual question, neither of them wanted to move away from the old home,\nand each hoped in his heart that he should never be forced into doing\nso. Cyrus had become wedded to the house as a man becomes wedded to a\nhabit, and since the clinging to a habit was the only form of sentiment\nof which he was capable, he shrank more and more from what he felt to be\nthe almost unbearable wrench of moving. A certain fidelity of purpose,\nthe quality which had lifted him above the petty provincialism that\ncrippled James, made the display of wealth as obnoxious to him as the\npossession of it was agreeable. As long as he was conscious that he\ncontrolled the industrial future of Dinwiddie, it was a matter of\nindifference to him whether people supposed him to be a millionaire or a\npauper. In time he would probably have to change his way of living and\nput an end to his life-long practice of saving; but, meanwhile, he was\nquite content to go on year after year mending the roof and the chimneys\nof the old house into which he had moved the week after his marriage.\n\nEntering the hall, he hung his hat on the walnut hat-rack in the dark\ncorner behind the door, and followed the worn strip of blue and red\noilcloth which ran up the narrow staircase to the floor above. Where the\nstaircase bent sharply in the middle, the old-fashioned mahogany\nbalustrade shone richly in the light of a gas-jet which jutted out on a\nbrass stem from the wall. Although a window on the upper floor was\nopened wide to the sunset, the interior of the house had a close musty\nsmell, as if it had been shut up, uninhabited, for months. Cyrus had\nnever noticed the smell, for his senses, which were never acute, had\nbeen rendered even duller than usual by custom.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, a coloured washerwoman, accompanied by a\nbright mulatto boy, who carried an empty clothes basket on his head,\nwaited humbly in the shadow for the two men to pass. She was a dark\nglistening creature, with ox-like eyes, and the remains of a handsome\nfigure, now running to fat.\n\n\"Howdy, Marster,\" she murmured under her breath as Cyrus reached her, to\nwhich he responded brusquely, \"Howdy, Mandy,\" while he glanced with\nunseeing eyes at the mulatto boy at her side. Then, as he walked rapidly\ndown the hall, with James at his heels, the woman turned back for a\nminute and gazed after him with an expression of animal submission and\nacquiescence. So little personal to Cyrus and so free from individual\nconsciousness was this look, that it seemed less the casual glance from\na servant to a master than the intimate aspect of a primitive racial\nattitude toward life.\n\nAt the end of the hall, beyond the open door of the bedroom (which he\nstill occupied with his wife from an ineradicable conviction that all\nrespectable married persons slept together no matter how uncomfortable\nthey might be), Cyrus discerned the untidy figure of Mrs. Treadwell\nreflected in a mirror before which she stood brushing her back hair\nstraight up from her neck to a small round knot on the top of her head.\nShe was a slender, flat-chested woman, whose clothes, following some\nnatural bent of mind, appeared never to be put on quite straight or\nproperly hooked and buttoned. It was as if she perpetually dressed in a\npanic, forgetting to fasten her placket, to put on her collar or to mend\nthe frayed edges of her skirt. When she went out, she still made some\nspasmodic attempts at neatness; but Susan's untiring efforts and\nremonstrances had never convinced her that it mattered how one looked in\nthe house--except indeed when a formal caller arrived, for whom she\nhastily tied a scarf at the neck of her dirty basque and flung a purple\nwool shawl over her shoulders. Her spirit had been too long broken for\nher to rebel consciously against her daughter's authority; but her mind\nwas so constituted that the sense of order was missing, and the pretty\ncoquetry of youth, which had masqueraded once as the more enduring\nquality of self-respect, was extinguished in the five and thirty\npenitential years of her marriage. She had a small vacant face, where\nthe pink and white had run into muddiness, a mouth that sagged at the\ncorners like the mouth of a frightened child, and eyes of a sickly\npurple, which had been compared by Cyrus to \"sweet violets,\" in the only\ncompliment he ever paid her. Thirty-five years ago, in one of those\nattacks of indiscretion which overtake the most careful man in the\nspring, Cyrus had proposed to her; and when she declined him, he had\nimmediately repeated his offer, animated less by any active desire to\npossess her, than by the dogged male determination to over-ride all\nobstacles, whether feminine or financial. And pretty Belinda\nBolingbroke, being alone and unsupported by other suitors at the\ninstant, had entwined herself instinctively around the nearest male prop\nthat offered. It had been one of those marriages of opposites which\npeople (ignoring the salient fact that love has about as much part in it\nas it has in the pursuit of a spring chicken by a hawk) speak of with\nsentiment as \"a triumph of love over differences.\" Even in the first\ndays of their engagement, there could be found no better reason for\ntheir marriage than the meeting of Cyrus's stubborn propensity to have\nhis way with the terror of imaginary spinsterhood which had seized\nBelinda in a temporary lapse of suitors. Having married, they\nimmediately proceeded, as if by mutual consent, to make the worst of it.\nShe, poor fluttering dove-like creature, had lost hope at the first\nrebuff, and had let go all the harmless little sentiments that had\nsweetened her life; while he, having married a dove by choice and\nbecause of her doveliness, had never forgiven her that she did not\ndevelop into a brisk, cackling hen of the barnyard. As usually happens\nin the cases where \"love triumphs over differences,\" he had come at last\nto hate her for the very qualities which had first caught his fancy. His\nideal woman (though he was perfectly unconscious that she existed) was a\nmanaging thrifty soul, in a starched calico dress, with a natural\ncapacity for driving a bargain; and Life, with grim humour, had rewarded\nthis respectable preference by bestowing upon him feeble and insipid\nBelinda, who spent sleepless nights trying to add three and five\ntogether, but who could never, to save her soul, remember to put down\nthe household expenses in the petty cash book. It was a case, he\nsometimes told himself, of a man, who had resisted temptation all his\nlife, being punished for one instant's folly more harshly than if he\nwere a practised libertine. No libertine, indeed, could have got himself\ninto such a scrape, for none would have surrendered so completely to a\nsingle manifestation of the primal force. To play the fool once, he\nreflected bitterly, when his brief intoxication was over, is after all\nmore costly than to play it habitually. Had he pursued a different pair\nof violet eyes every evening, he would never have ended by embracing the\nphantom that was Belinda.\n\nBut it was more than thirty years since Cyrus had taken the trouble to\nturn his unhappiness into philosophy--for, aided by time, he had become\nreconciled to his wife as a man becomes reconciled to a physical\ninfirmity. Except for that one eventful hour in April, women had stood\nfor so little in his existence, that he had never stopped to wonder if\nhis domestic relations might have been pleasanter had he gone about the\nbusiness of selection as carefully as he picked and chose the tobacco\nfor his factory. Even the streak of sensuality in his nature did not run\nwarm as in the body of an ordinary mortal, and his vices, like his\nvirtues, had become so rarefied in the frozen air of his intelligence\nthat they were no longer recognizable as belonging to the common\nfrailties of men.\n\n\"Ain't you dressed yet?\" he inquired without looking at his wife as he\nentered--for having long ago lost his pride of possession in her, he had\nceased to regard her as of sufficient importance to merit the ordinary\ncivilities.\n\n\"I was helping Miss Willy whip one of Susan's flounces,\" she answered,\nturning from the mirror, with the hairbrush held out like a peace\noffering before her. \"We wanted to get through to-day,\" she added\nnervously, \"so Miss Willy can start on Jinny Pendleton's dress the first\nthing in the morning.\"\n\nIf Cyrus had ever permitted himself the consolation of doubtful\nlanguage, he would probably have exclaimed with earnestness, \"Confound\nMiss Willy!\" but he came of a stock which condemned an oath, or even an\nexpletive, on its face value, so this natural outlet for his irritation\nwas denied him. Instead, therefore, of replying in words, he merely\nglanced sourly at the half-open door, through which issued the whirring\nnoise of the little dressmaker at her sewing. Now and then, in the\nintervals when her feet left the pedal, she could be heard humming\nsoftly to herself with her mouth full of pins.\n\n\"Isn't she going?\" asked Cyrus presently, while he washed his hands at\nthe washstand in one corner and dried them on a towel which Belinda had\nelaborately embroidered in red. Peering through the crack of the door as\nhe put the question, he saw Miss Willy hurriedly pulling basting threads\nout of a muslin skirt, and the fluttering bird-like motions of her hands\nincreased the singular feeling of repulsion with which she inspired him.\nThough he was aware that she was an entirely harmless person, and,\nmore-over, that her \"days\" supplied the only companionship his wife\nreally enjoyed, he resented angrily the weeks of work and gossip which\nthe little seamstress spent under his roof. Put two gabbling women like\nthat together and you could never tell what stories would be set going\nabout you before evening! A suspicion, unfortunately too well founded,\nthat his wife had whimpered out her heart to the whirring accompaniment\nof Miss Willy's machine, had caused him once or twice to rise in his\nauthority and forbid the dressmaker the house; but, in doing so, he had\nreckoned without the strength which may lie in an unscrupulous weakness.\nBelinda, who had never fought for anything else in her life, refused\nabsolutely to give up her dressmaker. \"If I can't see her here, I'll go\nto her house,\" she had said, and Cyrus had yielded at last as the bully\nalways yields before the frenzied violence of his victim.\n\nAfter a hasty touch to the four round flat curls on her forehead, Mrs.\nTreadwell turned from the bureau with her habitually hopeless air, and\nslipped her thin arms into the tight sleeves of a black silk basque\nwhich she took up from the bed.\n\n\"Did you see Oliver when you came in?\" she asked. \"He was in here\nlooking for you a few minutes ago.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't see him, but I'm going to. He's got to give up this\nhighfaluting nonsense of his if he expects me to support him. There's\none thing the fellow's got to understand, and that is that he can choose\nbetween his precious stuff and his bread and meat. Before I give him a\njob, he'll have to let me see that he is done with all this business of\nplay-writing.\"\n\nA frightened look came into his wife's face, and indifferently glancing\nat her as he finished, he was arrested by something enigmatical and yet\nfamiliar in her features. A dim vision of the way she had looked at him\nin the early days of their marriage floated an instant before him.\n\n\"Do you think he wants to do that?\" she asked, with a little sound as if\nshe had drawn her breath so sharply that it whistled. What in thunder\nwas the matter with the woman? he wondered irritably. Of course she was\na fool about the scamp--all the women, even Susan, lost their heads over\nhim--but, after all, why should it make any difference to her whether he\nwrote plays or took freight orders, as long as he managed to feed\nhimself?\n\n\"Well, I don't reckon it has come to a question of what he wants,\" he\nrejoined shortly.\n\n\"But the boy's heart is bound up in his ambition,\" urged Belinda, with\nan energy he had witnessed in her only once before in her life, and that\nwas on the occasion of her historic defence of the seamstress.\n\nFor a moment Cyrus stared at her with attention, almost with curiosity.\nThen he opened his lips for a crushing rejoinder, but thinking better of\nhis impulse, merely repeated dryly, \"His heart?\" before he turned toward\nthe door. On the threshold he looked back and added, \"The next time you\nsee him, tell him I'd like a word with him.\"\n\nLeft alone in her room, Mrs. Treadwell sat down in a rocking-chair by\nthe window, and clasped her hands tightly in her lap with a nervous\ngesture which she had acquired in long periods of silent waiting on\ndestiny. Her mental attitude, which was one of secret, and usually\npassive, antagonism to her husband, had stamped its likeness so\nindelibly upon her features, that, sitting there in the wan light, she\nresembled a woman who suffers from the effects of some slow yet deadly\nsickness. Lacking the courage to put her revolt into words, she had\nallowed it to turn inward and embitter the hidden sources of her being.\nIn the beginning she had asked so little of life that the denial of that\nlittle by Fate had appeared niggardly rather than tragic. A man--any man\nwho would have lent himself gracefully as an object of worship--would\nhave been sufficient material for the building of her happiness.\nMarriage, indeed, had always appeared to her so desirable as an end in\nitself, entirely apart from the personal peculiarities or possibilities\nof a husband, that she had awakened almost with surprise one morning to\nthe knowledge that she was miserable. It was not so much that her\nromance had met with open disaster as that it had simply faded away.\nThis gradual fading away of sentiment, which she had accepted at the\ntime as only one of the inevitable stages in the slow process of\nemotional adjustment, would perhaps have made but a passing impression\non a soul to whom every other outlet into the world had not been closed\nby either temperament or tradition. But love had been the one window\nthrough which light could enter her house of Life; and when this\ndarkened, her whole nature had sickened and grown morbid. Then at last\nall the corroding bitterness in her heart had gathered to a canker which\nached ceaselessly, like a physical sore, in her breast.\n\n\"He saw I'd taken to Oliver--that's why he's anxious to spite him,\" she\nthought resentfully as she stared with unseeing eyes out into the gray\ntwilight. \"It's all just to worry me, that's why he is doing it. He\nknows I couldn't be any fonder of the boy if he had come of my own\nblood.\" And she who had been a Bolingbroke set her thin lips together\nwith the only consciousness of superiority to her husband that she had\never known--the secret consciousness that she was better born. Out of\nthe wreck of her entire life, this was the floating spar to which she\nstill clung with a sense of security, and her imagination, by long\nconcentration upon the support that it offered, had exaggerated its\nimportance out of all proportion to the other props among which it had\nits place. Like its imposing symbol, the Saint Memin portrait of the\ngreat Archibald Bolingbroke, which lent distinction, by its very\ninappropriateness, to the wall on which it hung, this hidden triumph\nimparted a certain pathetic dignity to her manner.\n\n\"That's all on earth it is,\" she repeated with a kind of smothered\nfierceness. But, even while the words were on her lips, her face changed\nand softened, for in the adjoining room a voice, full of charm, could be\nheard saying: \"Sewing still, Miss Willy? Don't you know that you are\nguilty of an immoral act when you work overtime?\"\n\n\"I'm just this minute through, Mr. Oliver,\" answered the seamstress in\nfluttering tones. \"As soon as I fold this skirt, I'm going to quit and\nput on my bonnet.\"\n\nA few more words followed, and then the door opened wider and Oliver\nentered--with his ardent eyes, his irresolute mouth, and his physical\ncharm which brought an air of vital well-being into the depressing\nsultriness of the room.\n\n\"I missed you downstairs, Aunt Belinda. You haven't a headache, I hope,\"\nhe said, and there was the same caressing kindness in his tone which he\nhad used to the dressmaker. It was as if his sympathy, like his charm,\nwhich cost him so little because it was the gift of Nature, overflowed\nin every casual expression of his temperament.\n\n\"No, I haven't a headache, dear,\" replied Mrs. Treadwell, putting up her\nhand to his cheek as he leaned over her. \"Your uncle is waiting for you\nin the library, so you'd better go down at once,\" she added, catching\nher breath as she had done when Cyrus first spoke to her about Oliver.\n\n\"Have you any idea what it means? Did he tell you?\"\n\n\"Yes, he wants to talk to you about business.\"\n\n\"The deuce he does! Well, if that's it, I'd be precious glad to get out\nof it. You don't suppose I could cut it, do you? Susan is going to take\nme to the Pendletons' after supper, and I'd like to run upstairs now and\nmake a change.\"\n\n\"No, you'd better go down to him. He doesn't like to be kept waiting.\"\n\n\"All right, then--since you say so.\"\n\nMeeting the dressmaker on the threshold, he forgot to answer her\ndeprecating bow in his eagerness to have the conversation with Cyrus\nover and done with.\n\n\"I declare, he does startle a body when you ain't used to him,\" observed\nMiss Willy, with a bashful giggle. She was a diminutive, sparrow-like\ncreature, with a natural taste for sick-rooms and death-beds, and an\ninexhaustible fund of gossip. As Mrs. Treadwell, for once, did not\nrespond to her unspoken invitation to chat, she tied her bonnet strings\nunder her sharp little chin, and taking up her satchel went out again,\nafter repeating several times that she would be \"back the very minute\nMrs. Pendleton was through with her.\" A few minutes later, Belinda,\nstill seated by the window, saw the shrunken figure ascend the area\nsteps and cross the dusty street with a rapid and buoyant step, as\nthough she, also, plain, overworked and penniless, was feeling the\ndelicious restlessness of the spring in her blood. \"I wonder what on\nearth she's got to make her skip like that,\" thought Belinda not without\nbitterness. \"I reckon she thinks she's just as important as anybody,\"\nshe added after an instant, touching, though she was unaware of it, the\nprofoundest truth of philosophy. \"She's got nothing in the world but\nherself, yet I reckon to her that is everything, even if it doesn't make\na particle of difference to anybody else whether she is living or dead.\"\n\nHer eyes were still on Miss Willy, who stepped on briskly, swinging her\nbag joyously before her, when the sound of Cyrus's voice, raised high in\nanger, came up to her from the library. A short silence followed; then a\ndoor opened and shut quickly, and rapid footsteps passed up the\nstaircase and along the hall outside of her room. While she waited,\novercome by the nervous indecision which attacked her like palsy\nwhenever she was forced to take a definite action, Susan ran up the\nstairs and called her name in a startled and shaking voice.\n\n\"Oh, mother, father has quarrelled dreadfully with Oliver and ordered\nhim out of the house!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOLIVER, THE ROMANTIC\n\n\nAn hour later Oliver stood before the book-shelves in his room, wrapping\neach separate volume in newspapers. Downstairs in the basement, he knew,\nthe family were at supper, but he had vowed, in his splendid scorn of\nmaterial things, that he would never eat another morsel under Cyrus's\nroof. Even when his aunt, trembling in every limb, had brought him\nsecretly from the kitchen a cup of coffee and a plate of waffles, he had\nrefused to unlock his door and permit her to enter. \"I'll come out when\nI am ready to leave,\" he had replied to her whispered entreaties.\n\nIt was a small room, furnished chiefly by book-shelves, which were still\nunfinished, and with a depressing view from a single window of red tin\nroofs and blackened chimneys. Above the chimneys a narrow band of sky,\nspangled with a few stars, was visible from where Oliver stood, and now\nand then he stopped in his work and gazed up at it with an exalted and\nresolute look. Sometimes a thin shred of smoke floated in from the\nkitchen chimney, and hung, as if drawn and held there by some magnetic\nattraction, around the kerosene lamp on a corner of the washstand. The\nsultriness of the night, which was oppressive even in the street, was\nalmost stifling in the little room with its scant western exposure.\n\nBut the flame burning in Oliver's breast had purged away such petty\nconsiderations as those for material comforts. He had risen above the\nheat, above the emptiness of his pockets, above the demands of his\nstomach. It was a matter of complete indifference to him whether he\nslept in a house or out of doors, whether he ate or went hungry. His\nexaltation was so magnificent that while it lasted he felt that he had\nconquered the physical universe. He was strong! He was free! And it was\ncharacteristic of his sanguine intellect that the future should appear\nto him at the instant as something which existed not beyond him, but\nactually within his grasp. Anger had liberated his spirit as even art\nhad not done; and he felt that all the blood in his body had rushed to\nhis brain and given him the mastery over circumstances. He forgot\nyesterday as easily as he evaded to-day and subjugated to-morrow. The\npast, with its starved ambitions, its tragic failures, its blighting\ndespondencies, melted away from him into obscurity; and he remembered\nonly the brief alternating hours of ecstasy and of accomplishment. With\nhis wind-blown, flame-like temperament, oscillating in the heat of youth\nbetween the inclinations he miscalled convictions, he was still, though\nCyrus had disowned him, only a romantic variation from the Treadwell\nstock. Somewhere, in the depths of his being, the essential Treadwell\npersisted. He hated Cyrus as a man hates his own weakness; he revolted\nfrom materialism as only a materialist in youth revolts.\n\nA knock came at his door, and pausing, with a volume of Heine still\nunwrapped in his hand, he waited in silence until his visitor should\nretire down the stairs. But instead of Mrs. Treadwell's trembling\ntones, he heard, after a moment, the firm and energetic voice of Susan.\n\n\"Oliver, I must speak to you. If you won't unlock your door, I'll sit\ndown on the steps and wait until you come out.\"\n\n\"I'm packing my books. I wish you'd go away, Susan.\"\n\n\"I haven't the slightest intention of going away until I've talked with\nyou----\" and, then, being one of those persons who are born with the\nnatural gift of their own way, she laid her hand on the door-knob while\nOliver impatiently turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"Since you are here, you might as well come in and help,\" he remarked\nnone too graciously, as he made way for her to enter.\n\n\"Of course I'll help you--but, oh, Oliver, what in the world are you\ngoing to do?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought. I'm too busy, but I'll manage somehow.\"\n\n\"Father was terrible. I heard him all the way upstairs in my room. But,\"\nshe looked at him a little doubtfully, \"don't you think he will get over\nit?\"\n\n\"He may, but I shan't. I'd rather starve than live under a petty tyranny\nlike that?\"\n\n\"I know,\" she nodded, and he saw that she understood him. It was\nwonderful how perfectly, from the very first instant, she had understood\nhim. She grasped things, too, by intelligence, not by intuition, and he\nfound this refreshing in an age when the purely feminine was in fashion.\nNever had he seen a finer example of young, buoyant, conquering\nwomanhood--of womanhood freed from the consciousness and the\ndisabilities of sex. \"She's not the sort of girl a man would lose his\nhead over,\" he reflected; \"there's too little of the female about\nher--she's as free from coquetry as she is from the folderol of\nsentimentality. She's a free spirit, and God knows how she ever came out\nof the Treadwells.\" Her beauty even wasn't of the kind that usually goes\nby the name. He didn't suppose there were ten men in Dinwiddie who would\nturn to look back at her--but, by Jove, if she hadn't beauty, she had\nthe character that lends an even greater distinction. She looked as if\nshe could ride Life like a horse--could master it and tame it and break\nit to the bridle.\n\n\"It's amazing how you know things, Susan,\" he said, \"and you've never\nbeen outside of Dinwiddie.\"\n\n\"But I've wanted to, and I sometimes think the wanting teaches one more\nthan the going.\"\n\nHe thought over this for an instant, and then, as if the inner flame\nwhich consumed him had leaped suddenly to the surface, he burst out\njoyously: \"I've come to the greatest decision of my life in this last\nhour, Susan.\"\n\nHer eyes shone. \"You mean you've decided not to do what father asks no\nmatter what happens?\"\n\n\"I've decided not to accept his conditions--no matter what happens,\" he\nanswered.\n\n\"He was in earnest, then, about wanting you to give up writing?\"\n\n\"So much in earnest that he would give me a job only on those terms.\"\n\n\"And you declined absolutely?\"\n\n\"Of course I declined absolutely.\"\n\n\"But how will you live, Oliver?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can easily make thirty dollars a month by reviewing German books\nfor New York papers, and I dare say I can manage to pull through on\nthat. I'll have to stay in Dinwiddie, of course, because I couldn't live\nanywhere else on nearly so little, and, besides, I shouldn't be able to\nbuy a ticket away.\"\n\n\"That will be twenty dollars for your board,\" said the practical Susan,\n\"and you will have to make ten dollars a month cover all your other\nexpenses. Do you think you can do it?\"\n\n\"I've got to. Better men have done worse things, haven't they? Better\nmen have done worse things and written great plays while they were about\nthem.\"\n\n\"I believe Mrs. Peachey would let you have a back room and board for\nthat,\" pursued Susan. \"But it will cost you something to get your books\nmoved and the shelves put up there.\"\n\n\"As soon as I get through this I'll go over and see her. Oh, I'm free,\nSusan, I'm happy! Did you ever see an absolutely happy man before? I\nfeel as if a weight had rolled off my shoulders. I'm tired--dog-tired of\ncompromise and commercialism and all the rest of it. I've got something\nto say to the world, and I'll go out and make my bed in the gutter\nbefore I'll forfeit the opportunity of saying it. Do you know what that\nmeans, Susan? Do you know what it is to be willing to give your life if\nonly you can speak out the thing that is inside of you?\" The colour in\nhis face mounted to his forehead, while his eyes grew black with\nemotion. In the smoky little room, Youth, with its fierce revolts, its\nimpassioned egoism, its inextinguishable faith in itself, delivered its\nultimatum to Life. \"I've got to be true to myself, Susan! A man who\nwon't starve for his ambition isn't worth his salt, is he? And, besides,\nthe best work is all done not in plenty, but in poverty--the most\nperfect art has grown from the poorest soil. If I were to accept Uncle\nCyrus's offer, I'd grow soft to the core in a month and be of no more\nuse than a rotten apple.\"\n\nHis conviction lent a golden ring to his voice, and so winning to Susan\nwas the impetuous flow of his words, that she felt herself swept away\nfrom all the basic common sense of her character. She saw his ambition\nas clearly as he saw it; she weighed his purpose, as he weighed it, in\nthe imaginary scales of his judgment; she accepted his estimate of his\npowers as passionately as he accepted it.\n\n\"Of course you mustn't give up, Oliver; you couldn't,\" she said.\n\n\"You're right, I couldn't.\"\n\n\"If you can get steady reviewing, I believe you can manage,\" she\nresumed. \"Living in Dinwiddie costs really so very little.\" Her voice\nthrilled suddenly. \"It must be beautiful to have something that you feel\nabout like this. Oh, I wish I were you, Oliver! I wish a thousand times\nI were you!\"\n\nWithdrawing his eyes from the sky at which he had been gazing, he turned\nto look at her as if her words had arrested him. \"You're a dear girl,\"\nhe answered kindly, \"and I think all the world of you.\" As he spoke he\nthought again what a fine thing it would be for the man who could fall\nin love with her. \"It would be the best thing that could happen to any\nman to marry a woman like that,\" he reflected; \"she'd keep him up to the\nmark and never let him grow soft. Yes, it would be all right if only\none could manage to fall in love with her--but I couldn't. She might as\nwell be a rose-bush for all the passion she'd ever arouse in me.\" Then\nhis charming egoism asserted itself, and he said caressingly: \"I don't\nbelieve I could stand Dinwiddie but for you, Susan.\"\n\nShe smiled back at him, but there was a limpid clearness in her look\nwhich made him feel that she had seen through him while he was thinking.\nThis clearness, with its utter freedom from affectation or\nsentimentality, embarrassed him by its unlikeness to all the attributes\nhe mentally classified as feminine. To look straight seemed to him\nalmost as unwomanly as to throw straight, and Susan would, doubtless, be\nquite capable of performing either of these difficult feats. He liked\nher fine brow under the short fringe, which he hated, and he liked the\narched bridge of her nose and the generous curve of her mouth. Yet had\nhe stopped to analyze her, he would probably have said that the woman\nspirit in her was expressed through character rather than through\nemotion--a manifestation disconcerting to one whose vision of her sex\nwas chiefly as the irresponsible creature of drama. The old\nshackles--even the shackles of that drama whose mistress and slave woman\nhad been--were out of place on the spirit which was incarnated in Susan.\nAmid the cramping customs of the period, she moved large, free, and\nsimple, as though she walked already in the purer and more bracing air\nof the future.\n\n\"I wish I could help you,\" she said, stooping to pick up a newspaper\nfrom a pile on the floor. \"Here, let me wrap that Spinoza. I'm afraid\nthe back will come off if you aren't careful.\"\n\n\"Of course a man has to work out his own career,\" he replied, as he\nhanded over the volume. \"I doubt, when it comes to that, if anybody can\nbe of much help to another where his life's work is concerned. The main\nthing, after all, is not to get in one's way, not to cripple one's\nenergy. I've got to be free--that's all there is about it. I've got to\nbelong to myself every instant.\"\n\n\"And you know already just what you are going to do? About your writing,\nI mean.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. I've ideas enough to fill fifty ordinary lifetimes. I'm\nsimply seething with them. Why, that box over there in the corner is\nfull of plays that would start a national drama if the fool public had\nsense enough to see what they are about. The trouble is that they don't\nwant life on the stage; they want a kind of theatrical wedding-cake.\nAnd, by Jove, they get it! Any dramatist who tries to force people to\neat bread and meat when they are crying for sugar plums may as well\nprepare to starve until the public begins to suffer from acute\nindigestion. Then, if he isn't dead--or, perhaps, if he is--his hour\nwill come, and he will get his reward either here or in heaven.\"\n\n\"So you'll go on just the same and wait until they're ready for you?\"\nasked Susan, laughing from sheer pride in him. \"You'll never, never\ncheapen yourself, Oliver?\" For the first time in her life she was face\nto face with an intellectual passion, and she felt almost as if she\nherself were inspired.\n\n\"Never. I've made my choice. I'll wait half a century if need be, but\nI'll wait. I know, too, what I am talking about, for I could do the\nother thing as easily as I could eat my dinner. I've got the trick of\nit. I could make a fortune to-morrow if I were to lose my intellectual\nhonesty and go in simply for the making of money. Why, I am a Treadwell,\nafter all, just as you are, my dear cousin, and I could commercialize\nthe stage, I haven't a doubt, as successfully as your father has\ncommercialized the railroad. It's in the blood--the instinct, you\nknow--and the only thing that has kept it down in me is that I\nsincerely--yes, I sincerely and enthusiastically believe that I am a\ngenius. If I didn't, do you think I'd stick at this starvation business\nanother fortnight? That's the whole story, every blessed word of it, and\nI'm telling you because I feel expansive to-night--I'm such a tremendous\negoist, you know, and because--well, because you are Susan.\"\n\n\"I think I understand a little bit how you feel,\" replied Susan. \"Of\ncourse, I'm not a genius, but I've thought sometimes that I should\nalmost be willing to starve if only I might go to college.\"\n\nChecking the words on his lips, he looked at her with sympathy. \"It's a\nshame you can't, but I suppose Uncle Cyrus won't hear of it.\"\n\n\"I haven't asked him, but I am going to do it. I am so afraid of a\nrefusal--and, of course, he'll refuse--that I've lacked the courage to\nspeak of it.\"\n\n\"Good God! Why is one generation left so absolutely at the mercy of the\nother?\" he demanded, turning back to the strip of sky over the roof. \"It\nmakes a man rage to think of the lives that are spoiled for a whim.\nMoney, money--curse it!--it all comes to that in the end. Money makes us\nand destroys us.\"\n\n\"Do you remember what father said to you the other night--that you would\ncome at last to what you called the property idea and be exactly like\nJames and himself?\"\n\n\"If I thought that, I'd go out and hang myself. I can understand a man\nselling his soul for drink, though I rarely touch a drop, or for women,\nthough I've never bothered about them, but never, not even in the last\nextremity, for money.\"\n\nA door creaked somewhere on the second floor and a minute afterwards the\nslow and hesitating feet of Mrs. Treadwell were heard ascending the\nstairs.\n\n\"Let her come in just a moment, Oliver,\" begged Susan, and her tone was\nfull of the impatient, slightly arrogant affection with which she\nregarded her mother. There was little sympathy and less understanding\nbetween them, but on Susan's side there was a feeling of protective\ntenderness which was almost maternal. This tenderness was all her own,\nwhile the touch of arrogance in her manner belonged to the universal\ninability of youth to make allowances for age.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Oliver indifferently; and going to the door, he opened\nit and stood waiting for Mrs. Treadwell to enter.\n\n\"I came up to ask if you wouldn't eat something, dear?\" she asked. \"But\nI suppose Susan has brought you your supper?\"\n\n\"He won't touch a morsel, mother; it is useless to ask him. He is going\naway just as soon as we have finished packing.\"\n\n\"But where is he going? I didn't know that he had any place to go to.\"\n\n\"Oh, a man can always find a place somewhere.\"\n\n\"How can you take it so lightly, Susan,\" protested Mrs. Treadwell,\nbeginning to cry.\n\n\"That's the only sensible way to take it, isn't it, Oliver?\" asked\nSusan, gaily.\n\n\"Don't get into a fidget about me, Aunt Belinda,\" said Oliver, pushing\nthe pile of newspapers out of her way, while she sat down nervously on\nthe end of a packing-case and wiped her eyes on the fringe of her purple\nshawl. The impulsive kindness with which he had spoken to her a few\nhours before had vanished from his tone, and left in its place an accent\nof irritation. His sympathy, which was never assumed, resulted so\nentirely from his mood that it was practically independent of the person\nor situation which appeared to inspire it. There were moments when,\nbecause of a sensation of mental or physical well-being, he overflowed\nwith a feeling of tenderness for the beggar at the crossing; and there\nwere longer periods, following a sudden despondency, when the suffering\nof his closest friend aroused in him merely a sense of personal outrage.\nSo complete, indeed, was his absorption in himself, that even his\nphilosophy was founded less upon an intellectual conception of the\nuniverse than it was upon an intense preoccupation with his own\npersonality.\n\n\"But you don't mean that you are going for good?--that you'll never come\nback to see Susan and me again?\" whimpered his aunt, while her sagging\nmouth trembled.\n\n\"You can't expect me to come back after the things Uncle Cyrus has said\nto me.\"\n\nA look so bitter that it was almost venomous crept into Mrs. Treadwell's\nface. \"He just did it to worry me, Oliver. He has done everything he\ncould think of to worry me ever since he persuaded me to marry him. I\nsometimes believe,\" she added, gloating over the idea like a decayed\nremnant of the aristocratic spirit, \"that he has always been jealous of\nme because I was born a Bolingbroke.\"\n\nTo Oliver, who had not like Susan grown accustomed through constant\nrepetition to Mrs. Treadwell's delusion, this appeared so fresh a view\nof Cyrus's character, that it caught his interest even in the midst of\nhis own absorbing perplexities. Until he saw Susan's head shake\nominously over her mother's shoulder, it did not occur to him that his\naunt, whom he supposed to be without imagination, had created this\nconsoling belief out of her own mental vacancy.\n\n\"Oh, he wanted to worry me all right, there's no doubt about that,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"He hasn't spoken to me when he could help it for twenty years,\" pursued\nhis aunt, who was so possessed by the idea of her own relation to her\nhusband that she was incapable of dwelling upon any other.\n\n\"I wouldn't talk about it, mother, if I were you,\" said Susan with\nresolute cheerfulness.\n\n\"I don't know why I shouldn't talk about it. It's all I've got to talk\nabout,\" returned Mrs. Treadwell peevishly; and she added with smothered\nresentment, \"Even my children haven't been any comfort to me since they\nwere little. They've both turned against me because of the way their\nfather treats me. James hardly ever has so much as a word to say to me.\"\n\n\"But I do, mother. How can you say such an unkind thing to me?\"\n\n\"You never do the things that I want you to. You know I'd like you to go\nout and enjoy yourself and have attention as other girls do.\"\n\n\"You are disappointed because I'm not a belle like Abby Goode or Jinny\nPendleton,\" said Susan with the patience that is born of a basic sense\nof humour. \"But I couldn't help that, could I?\"\n\n\"Any girl in my day would have felt badly if she wasn't admired,\"\npursued Mrs. Treadwell with the venom of the embittered weak, \"but I\ndon't believe you'd care a particle if a man never looked at you twice.\"\n\n\"If one never looked at me once, I don't see why you should want me to\nbe miserable about it,\" was Susan's smiling rejoinder; \"and if the girls\nin your day couldn't be happy without admiration, they must have been\nsilly creatures. I've a life of my own to live, and I'm not going to let\nmy happiness depend on how many times a man looks at me.\" In the clear\nlight of her ridicule, the spectre of spinsterhood, which was still an\nobject of dread in the Dinwiddie of the eighties, dissolved into a\nshadow.\n\n\"Well, we've about finished, I believe,\" remarked Oliver, closing the\ncase over which he was stooping, and devoutly thanking whatever\nbeneficent Powers had not created him a woman. \"I'll send for these\nsometime to-morrow, Aunt Belinda.\"\n\n\"You'd just as well spend the night,\" urged Mrs. Treadwell stubbornly.\n\"He need never know of it.\"\n\n\"But I'd know of it--that's the great thing--and I'd never forget it.\"\n\nRising unsteadily from the box, she stood with the ends of her purple\nshawl clutched tightly over her flat bosom. \"Then you'll wait just a\nminute. I've got something downstairs I'd like to give you,\" she said.\n\n\"Why, of course, but won't you let me fetch it?\"\n\n\"You'd never find it,\" she answered mysteriously, and hurried out while\nhe held the door open to light her down the dark staircase.\n\nWhen her tread was heard at last on the landing below, Susan glanced at\nthe books that were still left on the shelves. \"I'll pack the rest for\nyou to-morrow, Oliver, and your clothes, too. Have you any money?\"\n\n\"A little left from selling my watch in New York. My clothes don't\namount to much. I've got them all in that bag, but I'll leave my books\nin your charge until I can find a place for them.\"\n\n\"I'll take good care of them. O Oliver!\" her face grew disturbed. \"I\nforgot all about my promise to Virginia that I'd bring you to see her\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Well, I've no time to meet girls now, of course, but that doesn't mean\nthat I'm not awfully knocked up about it.\"\n\n\"I hate so to disappoint her.\"\n\n\"She won't think of it twice, the beauty!\"\n\n\"But she will. I'm sure she will. Hush! Mother is coming.\"\n\nAs he turned to the door, it opened slowly to admit the figure of his\naunt, who was panting heavily from her hurried ascent of the stairs. Her\nill-humour toward Susan had entirely disappeared, for the only\nresentment she had ever harboured for more than a few minutes was the\nlife-long one which she had borne her husband.\n\n\"It was not in the place where I had put it, so I thought one of the\nservants had taken it,\" she explained. \"Mandy was alone in my room\nto-day while I was at dinner.\"\n\nIn her hand she held a small pasteboard box bearing a jeweller's\nimprint, and opening this, she took out a roll of money and counted out\nfifty dollars on the top of a packing-case. \"I've saved this up for six\nmonths,\" she said. \"It came from selling some silver forks that belonged\nto the Bolingbrokes, and I always felt easier to think that I had a\nlittle laid away that he had nothing to do with. From the very day that\nI married him, he was always close about money,\" she added.\n\nThe sordid tragedy--not of poverty, but of meanness--was in the gesture\nwith which she gathered up the notes and pressed them into his shrinking\nhands. And yet Cyrus Treadwell was a rich man--the richest man living in\nDinwiddie! Oliver understood now why she was crushed--why she had become\nthe hopeless victim of the little troubles of life. \"From the very day\nof our marriage, he was always close about money.\"\n\n\"I had three dozen forks and spoons in the beginning,\" she resumed as if\nthere were no piercing significance in the fact she stated so simply,\n\"but I've sold them all now, one or two at a time, when I needed a\nlittle money of my own. He has always paid the bills, but he never gave\nme a cent in my life to do as I pleased with.\"\n\n\"I can't take it from you, Aunt Belinda. It would burn my fingers.\"\n\n\"It's mine. I've got a right to do as I choose with it,\" she persisted\nalmost passionately, \"and I'd rather give it to you than buy anything in\nthe world.\" Something in her face--the look of one who has risen to a\ngenerous impulse and finds happiness in the sacrifice--checked the hand\nwith which he was thrusting the money away from him. He was deeply\ntouched by her act; it was useless for him to pretend either to her or\nto himself that she had not touched him. The youth in him, unfettered,\nstrong, triumphant, pitied her because she was no longer young; the\nartist in him pitied her because she was no longer beautiful. Without\nthese two things, or at least one of these two, what was life worth to a\nwoman?\n\n\"I'll take it on condition that you'll let me pay it back as soon as I\nget out of debt to Uncle Cyrus,\" he said in obedience to Susan's\nimploring nod.\n\nTo this she agreed after an ineffectual protest. \"You needn't think\nabout paying it back to me,\" she insisted; \"I haven't anything to spend\nmoney on now, so it doesn't make much difference whether I have any or\nnot. I can help you a little more after a while,\" she finished with\nenthusiasm. \"I'm raising a few squabs out in the back yard, and Meadows\nis going to buy them as soon as they are big enough to eat.\"\n\nAn embarrassment out of all proportion to the act which produced it held\nhim speechless while he gazed at her. He felt at first merely a sense of\nphysical revolt from the brutality of her self-revelation--from the\nnakedness to which she had stripped the horror of her marriage under the\neyes of her daughter. Nothing, not even the natural impulse to screen\none's soul from the gaze of the people with whom one lived, had\nprevented the appalling indignity of this exposure. The delusion that it\nis possible for a woman by mere virtue of being a woman to suffer in\nsweetness and silence, evaporated as he looked at her. He had believed\nher to be a nonentity, and she was revealing an inner life as intense,\nas real, as acutely personal as his own. A few words of casual kindness\nand he had made a slave of her. He regretted it. He was embarrassed. He\nwas sorry. He wished to heaven she hadn't brought him the money--and yet\nin spite of his regret and his embarrassment, he was profoundly moved.\nIt occurred to him as he took it from her how easy it would have been\nfor Cyrus to have subjugated and satisfied her in the beginning. All it\nneeded was a little kindness, the cheapest virtue, and the tragedy of\nher ruined soul might have been averted. To make allowances! Ah, that\nwas the philosophy of human relations in a word! If men and women would\nonly stop judging each other and make allowances!\n\n\"Well, I shan't starve just yet, thanks to you, Aunt Belinda,\" he said\ncheerfully enough as he thrust the notes into his pocket. It was a small\nthing, after all, to make her happy by the sacrifice of his pride. Pride\nwas not, he remembered, included among the Christian virtues, and,\nbesides, as he told himself the next instant, trifling as the sum was,\nit would at least tide him over financially until he received the next\npayment for his reviewing. \"I'd better go, it's getting late,\" he said\nwith a return of his old gaiety, while he bent over to kiss her. He was\nhalf ashamed of the kiss--not because he was self-conscious about\nkissing, since he had long since lost that mark of provincialism--but\nbecause of the look of passionate gratitude which glowed in her face.\nGratitude always made him uncomfortable. It was one of the things he was\nforever evading and yet forever receiving. He hated it, he had never in\nhis life done anything to deserve it, but he could never escape it.\n\n\"Good-bye, Susan.\" His lips touched hers, and though he was moving only\na few streets away, the caress contained all the solemnity of a last\nparting. Words wouldn't come when he searched for them, and the bracing\nsense of power he had felt half an hour ago was curiously mingled now\nwith an enervating tenderness. He was still confident of himself, but he\nbecame suddenly conscious that these women were necessary to his\nhappiness and his success, that his nature demanded the constant daily\ntonic of their love and service. He understood now the primal necessity\nof woman, not as an individual, but as an incentive and an appendage to\nthe dominant personality of man.\n\n\"Send for me if you need me,\" said Susan, resting her loving eyes upon\nhim; \"and, Oliver, please promise me to be very careful about money.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful, never fear!\" he replied with a laugh, as he took up\nhis bag and opened the door. A few minutes later, when he was leaving\nthe house, he reflected that the fifty dollars in his pocket would keep\nlife in him for a considerable time in Dinwiddie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA TREADWELL IN REVOLT\n\n\nYork Street, in which Mrs. Peachey lived and supplied the necessaries of\nlife to a dozen boarders, ran like a frayed seam of gentility between\nthe prosperous and the impoverished quarters of Dinwiddie; and in order\nto reach it, Oliver was obliged to pass the rectory, where, though he\ndid not see her, Virginia sat in stiffly starched muslin on the old\nhorsehair sofa. The fragrance of honeysuckle floated to his nostrils\nfrom the dim garden, but so absorbed was he in the engrossing problems\nof the moment, that only after he had passed the tower of the church did\nhe remember that the house behind him sheltered the girl who reminded\nhim of one of the adorable young virgins of Perugino. For an instant he\npermitted himself to dwell longingly on the expression of gentle\ngoodness that looked from her face; but this memory proved so\ndisturbing, that he put it obdurately away from him while he returned to\nthe prudent consideration of the fifty dollars in his pocket. The appeal\nof first love had been almost as urgent to him as to Virginia; but the\nemotion which had visited both alike had affected each differently, and\nthis difference was due to the fundamental distinction between woman,\nfor whom love is the supreme preoccupation of being, and man, to whom it\nis at best a partial manifestation of energy. To the woman nothing else\nreally mattered; to the man at least a dozen other pursuits mattered\nvery nearly as much.\n\nThe sultriness of the weather dampened his body, but not his spirits,\nand as he walked on, carrying his heavy bag, along York Street, his\nconsciousness of the tremendous importance to the world of his decision\nexhilarated him like a tonic. He had freed himself from Cyrus and from\ncommercialism at a single blow, and it had all been as easy as talking!\nThe joke about starvation he had of course indulged in merely for the\nexquisite pleasure of arousing Susan. He wasn't going to starve; nobody\nwas going to starve in Dinwiddie on thirty dollars a month, and there\nwas no doubt in the world of his ability to make that much by his\nreviewing. It was all simple enough. What he intended to do was to write\nthe national drama and to practise economy.\n\nHe had, indeed, provided for everything in his future, he was to\ndiscover a little later, except for the affable condescension of Mrs.\nPeachey toward the profession of letters. Cyrus's antagonism he had\nattributed to the crass stupidity of the commercial mind; but it was a\nblow to him to encounter the same misconception, more discreetly veiled,\nin a woman of the charm and the character of Mrs. Peachey. Bland, plump,\nand pretty, she received the modest avowal of his occupation with the\nsmiling skepticism peculiar to a race whose genius has been chiefly\nmilitary.\n\n\"I understand--it is very interesting,\" she observed sweetly. \"But what\ndo you do besides--what do you do, I mean, for a living?\"\n\nHere it was again, this fatuous intolerance! this incomprehensible\nprovincialism! And the terrible part of it was that he had suddenly the\nsensation of being overwhelmed by the weight of it, of being smothered\nunder a mountain of prejudice. The flame of his anger against Cyrus went\nout abruptly, leaving him cold. It was the world now against which he\nrebelled. He felt that the whole world was provincial.\n\n\"I shall write reviews for a New York paper,\" he answered, trying in\nvain to impress her by a touch of literary hauteur. At the moment it\nseemed to him that he could cheerfully bear anything if they would only\nat least pretend to take him seriously. What appalled him was not the\nopposition, but the utter absence of comprehension. And he could never\nhope to convince them! Even if he were to write great plays, they would\nstill hold as obstinately by their assumption that the writing of plays\ndid not matter--that what really mattered was to create and then to\nsatisfy an inordinate appetite for tobacco. This was authentic success,\nand by no illegitimate triumph of genius could he persuade an industrial\ncountry that he was as great a man as his uncle. The smiling incredulity\nin Mrs. Peachey's face ceased to be individual and became a part of the\nAmerican attitude toward the native-born artist. This attitude, he\nadmitted, was not confined to Dinwiddie, since it was national. He had\nencountered it in New York, but never had the destructive force of it\nimpressed him as it did on the ripe and charming lips of the woman\nbefore him. In that illuminating instant he understood why the American\nconsciousness in literature was still unawakened, why the creative\nartist turned manufacturer, why the original thinker bent his knee in\nthe end to the tin gods of convention.\n\nHer eyes--beautiful as the eyes of all happy women are beautiful--dwelt\non him kindly while he struggled to explain his mission. All the dread\nof the unusual, all the inherited belief in the sanctity of fixed\nopinions, all the passionate distrust of ideas that have not stood the\ntest of centuries--these things which make for the safety and the\npermanence of the racial life, were in the look of motherly indulgence\nwith which she regarded him. She had just risen from a rocking-chair on\nthe long porch, where honest Tom sat relating ponderous war anecdotes to\nan attentive group of boarders; and beyond her in the dimly lighted hall\nhe could see the wide old staircase climbing leisurely into the\nmysterious silence of the upper storeys.\n\n\"I have a small room at the back that I might rent to you,\" she said\nhesitatingly after a pause. \"I am afraid you will find it warm in\nsummer, as it is just under the roof and has a western exposure, but I\nhardly think I could do better for you at the price you are able to pay.\nI understood that you intended to live with your uncle,\" she added in a\nburst of enthusiasm. \"My husband has always been one of his greatest\nadmirers.\"\n\nThe mention of Cyrus was like a spur to Oliver's ambition, and he\nrealized with gratitude that it was merely his sensibility, not his\nresolution, which had been shaken.\n\n\"I'll take the room,\" he returned, ignoring what she had said as well as\nwhat she had implied about Cyrus. Then as she tripped ahead of him, he\nentered the dismantled hall, filled with broken pieces of fine old\nfurniture, and ascended the stairs as far as the third storey. When she\nturned a loosened door-knob and passed before him into the little room\nat the back, he saw first of all the narrow window, with its torn green\nshade, beyond which clustered a blur of silvery foliage in the midst of\nred roofs and huddled chimneys. From this hilltop, he could look down\nunseen on that bit of the universal life which was Dinwiddie. He could\nwatch the town at work and at play; he could see those twenty-one\nthousand souls either moved as a unit by the secret forces which ignore\nindividuality, or separated and enclosed by that impenetrable wall of\npersonality which surrounded each atom among them. He could follow the\ndivisions of class and the still deeper divisions of race as they were\nsymbolized in the old brick walls, overgrown with young grasses, which\ngirdled the ancient gardens in High Street. From the dazzling glimpses\nof white muslin under honeysuckle arbours, to the dusky forms that\nswarmed like spawn in the alleys, the life of Dinwiddie loved, hated,\nenjoyed, and suffered beneath him. And over this love and this hatred,\nthis enjoyment and this suffering, there presided--an outward and\nvisible sign of the triumph of industrialism--the imposing brick walls\nof the new Treadwell tobacco factory.\n\nA soft voice spoke in his ear, and turning, he looked into the face of\nMrs. Peachey, whom he had almost forgotten.\n\n\"You will find the sun warm in the afternoon, I am afraid,\" she\nmurmured, still with her manner of pleasantly humouring him which he\nfound later to be an unconscious expression of her half maternal,\nwholly feminine attitude toward his sex.\n\n\"Oh, I daresay it will be all right,\" he responded. \"I shall work so\nhard that I shan't have time to bother about the weather.\"\n\nLeaving the window, he gazed around the little room with an impulse of\ncuriosity. Who had lived here before him? A clerk? A travelling\nsalesman? Perhaps one of the numerous indigent gentlewomen that formed\nso large and so important a part of the population of Dinwiddie? The\nwalls were smeared with a sickly blue wash, and in several places there\nwere the marks left from the pictures of the preceding lodger. An old\nmahogany bureau, black with age and ill usage, stood crosswise in the\ncorner behind the door, and reflected in the dim mirror he saw his own\nface looking back at him. A film of dust lay over everything in the\nroom, over the muddy blue of the walls, over the strip of discoloured\nmatting on the floor, over the few fine old pieces of furniture, fallen\nnow into abject degradation. The handsome French bed, placed\nconveniently between door and window, stood naked to the eyes, with its\ncheap husk mattress rolled half back, and its bare slats, of which the\ntwo middle ones were tied together with rope, revealing conspicuously\nits descent from elegance into squalor. As he saw it, the room was the\nepitome of tragedy, yet in the centre of it, on one of the battered and\nbroken-legged Heppelwhite chairs, sat Mrs. Peachey, rosy, plump, and\npretty, regarding him with her slightly quizzical smile. \"Yes, life, of\ncourse, is sad if you stop to think about it,\" her smile seemed to\nassure him; \"but the main thing, after all, is to be happy in spite of\nit.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to stay here to-night?\" she asked, seeing that he had put\ndown his bag.\n\n\"If you will let me. But I am afraid it will be inconvenient.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Not if you don't mind the dust. The room has been\nshut up for weeks, and the dust is so dreadful in the spring. The\nservants have gone out,\" she added, \"but I'll bring you some sheets for\nyour bed, and you can fill your pitcher from the spout at the end of the\nhall. Only be careful not to stumble over the step there. It is hard to\nsee when the gas is not lit.\"\n\n\"You won't object to my putting shelves around the walls?\" he asked,\nwhile she pushed the mattress into place with the light and\ncondescending touch of one who preserves the aristocratic manner not\nonly in tragedy, but even in toil. It was, indeed, her peculiar\ndistinction, he came to know afterward, that she worked as gracefully as\nother women played.\n\n\"Couldn't you find room enough without them?\" she inquired while her\ngaze left the mattress and travelled dubiously to the mantelpiece. \"It\nseems a pity for you to go to any expense about shelves, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, they won't cost much. I'll do the work myself, and I'll do it in\nthe mornings when it won't disturb anybody. I daresay I'll have to push\nthat bed around a bit in order to make space.\"\n\nSomething in his vibrant voice--so full of the richness and the buoyant\nenergy of youth--made her look at him as she might have looked at one\nof her children, or at that overgrown child whom she had married. And\njust as she had managed Tom all his life by pretending to let him have\nhis way, so she proceeded now by instinct to manage Oliver. \"You dear\nboy! Of course you may turn things upside down if you want to. Only wait\na few days until you are settled and have seen how you like it.\"\n\nThen she tripped out with her springy step, which had kept its\nelasticity through war and famine, while Oliver, gazing after her,\nwondered whether it was philosophy or merely a love of pleasure that\nsustained her? Was it thought or the absence of thought that produced\nher wonderful courage?\n\nHe heard her tread on the stairs; then the sound passed to the front\nhall; and a minute later there floated up the laughter with which the\nassembled boarders received her. Closing the door, which she had left\nopen, he turned back to the window and stared from his hilltop down on\nthe red roofs of Dinwiddie. White as milk, the moonlight lay on the\nbrick wall at the foot of the garden, and down the gradual hill rows of\nchimneys were outlined against the faintly dappled sky in the west. In\nthe next yard a hollow tree looked as if it were cut out of silver, and\nbeneath its boughs, which drooped into the alley, he could see the\nhuddled figure of an aged negress who had fallen asleep on a flagstone.\nSo still was the night that the very smoke appeared to hang suspended\nabove the tops of the chimneys, as though it were too heavy to rise and\nyet too light to float downward toward the motionless trees. Under the\npale beams the town lost its look of solidity and grew spectral. Nothing\nseemed to hold it to the earth except the stillness which held the\nfallen flowers of the syringa there also. Even the church towers showed\nlike spires of thistledown, and the winding streets, which ran beside\nclear walls and dark shining gardens, trailed off from the ground into\nthe silvery air. Only the black bulk of the Treadwell factory beside the\nriver defied the magic of the moon's rays and remained a solid reminder\nof the brevity of all enchantment.\n\nGradually, while Oliver waited for Mrs. Peachey's return, he ceased to\nthink of the furniture in his room; he ceased to think even of the way\nin which he should manage to do his work, and allowed his mind to dwell,\nalmost with a feeling of ecstasy, on the memory of Virginia. He saw the\nmist of little curls on her temples, her blue eyes, with their good and\ngentle expression, and the look of radiant happiness which played like\nlight over her features. The beauty of the night acted as a spur to his\nsenses. He wanted companionship. He wanted the smile and the touch of a\nwoman. He wanted to fall in love with a girl who had blue eyes and a\nmouth like a flower!\n\n\"It wouldn't take me ten minutes to become a fool about her,\" he\nthought. \"Confound this moonlight, anyhow. It's making an idiot of me.\"\n\nLike many persons of artistic sensibility, he had at times the feeling\nthat his imagination controlled his conduct, and under the sharp\npressure of it now, he began to picture what the end would be if he were\nto fling himself headlong in the direction where his desires were\nleading him. If he could only let himself go! If he could only defy the\nfuture! If he could only forget in a single crisis that he was a\nTreadwell!\n\n\"If I were the right sort, I suppose I'd rush in and make her fall in\nlove with me, and then marry her and let her starve,\" he thought. \"But\nsomehow I can't. I'm either not enough of a genius or not enough of a\nTreadwell. When it comes to starving a woman in cold blood, my\nconscience begins to balk. There's only one thing it would balk at more\nviolently, and that is starving my work. That's what Uncle Cyrus would\nlike--nothing better. By Jove! the way he looked when he had the nerve\nto make that proposition! And I honestly believe he thought I was going\nto agree to it. I honestly believe he was surprised when I stood out\nagainst him. He's a downright idiot, that's what is the matter with him.\nWhy, it would be a crime, nothing less than a crime, for me to give up\nand go hunting after freight orders. Any ninny can do that. James can do\nthat--but he couldn't see, he positively couldn't see that I'd be wasted\nat it.\"\n\nThe vision of Cyrus had banished the vision of Virginia, and leaving the\nwindow, Oliver began walking rapidly back and forth between the\nwashstand and the bare bedstead. The fire of his ambition, which\nopposition had fanned into a blaze, had never burned more brightly in\nhis heart than it did at that instant. He felt capable not only of\nrenouncing Virginia, but of reforming the world. While he walked there,\nhe dedicated himself to art as exclusively as Cyrus had ever dedicated\nhimself to money--since Nature, who had made the individual, had been\npowerless to eradicate this basic quality of the type. A Treadwell had\nalways stood for success, and success meant merely seeing but one thing\nat a time and seeing that thing at every instant. It meant to Cyrus and\nto James the thought of money as absolutely as it meant to Oliver the\nthought of art. The way to it was the same, only the ideas that pointed\nthe way were different. To Cyrus and to James, indeed, as to all\nTreadwells everywhere, the idea was hardly an idea at all, since it had\nbeen crystallized by long usage into a fact. The word \"success\" (and\nwhat was success except another name for the universal Treadwell\nspirit?) invariably assumed the image of the dollar in the mind of\nCyrus, while to Oliver, since his thinking was less carefully\nco\u00c3\u00b6rdinated, it was without shape or symbol. Pacing the dusty floor,\nwith the pale moonlight brooding like a flock of white birds over the\ngarden, the young man would have defined the word as embracing all the\nlofty aspirations in the human soul. It was the hour when youth scaled\nthe heights and wrested the divine fire from the heavens. At the moment\nhe was less an individual than the embodied age of two-and-twenty. He\nwas intellect in adolescence--intellect finding its strength--intellect\nin revolt against the tyranny of industrialism.\n\nThe staircase creaked softly, and following a knock at the door, Mrs.\nPeachey entered with her arms full of bed-clothes.\n\n\"I am so sorry I kept you waiting, Mr. Treadwell, but I was obliged to\nstop to speak to a caller. Oh, thank you. Do you really know how to make\nup a bed? How very clever of you! I'm sure Mr. Peachey couldn't do such\na thing if his life depended upon it. Men are so helpless that it\nsurprises me--it really does--when they know how to do anything. Oh, of\ncourse, you have lived about the world so much that you have had to\nlearn how to manage. And you've been abroad? How very interesting! Some\nday when I have the time you must tell me about it. Not that I should\never care to go myself, but I love to hear other people talk about their\ntravels. Professor Trimble--he lived over there a great many years--gave\na talk before the Ladies' Aid Society of our church, and everybody said\nit was quite as instructive as going one's self. And then, too, one\nescaped all the misery of seasickness.\"\n\nAll the time she was busily spreading his bed, while he assisted her\nwith what she described to her husband afterward as \"the most charming\nmanner, just as if he enjoyed it.\" This charming manner, which was the\noutward expression of an inborn kindliness, won her entirely to his side\nbefore the bed-making was over. That any one so frank and pleasant, with\nsuch nice boyish eyes, and so rich a colour, should prove untrustworthy,\nwas unbelievable to that part of her which ruled her judgment. And since\nthis ruling part was not reason, but instinct, she possessed, perhaps,\nas infallible a guide to opinions as ever falls to the lot of erring\nhumanity. \"I know he's all right. Don't ask me _how_ I know it, Mr.\nPeachey,\" she observed while she brushed her hair for the night; \"I\ndon't know how I know it, but I do know it.\"\n\nOliver, meanwhile, had thrown off his coat, and settled down to work\nunder the flickering gas, at the end of the mantelpiece. Inspiration had\nseized him while he helped Mrs. Peachey make his bed, and his \"charming\nmanner,\" which had at first been natural enough, had become at last\nsomething of an effort. He was writing the second act of a play in\nwhich he meant to supplant the pretty shams of the stage by the aspect\nof sober reality. The play dealt with woman--with the new woman who has\ngrown so old in the last twenty years--with the woman whose past is a\ncross upon which she crucifies both herself and the public. Like most\nmen of twenty-two, he was convinced that he understood all about women,\nand like most men of any age, he was under the impression that women\nacted, thought, and felt, not as individuals, but as a sex. The classic\nphrases, \"women are like that,\" and \"women think so queerly about\nthings,\" were on his lips as constantly as if he were an average male\nand not an earnest-minded student of human nature. But while the average\nmale applies general principles loosely and almost unconsciously, with\nOliver the habit was the result of a distinctly formulated philosophy.\nHe had, as he would probably have put it, a feeling for reality, and the\nstage appeared to him, on the whole, to be the most effective vehicle\nfor revealing the universe to itself. If he was not a genius, he\npossessed the unconquerable individualism of genius; and he possessed,\nalso, a cleverness which could assume the manner of genius without\napparent effort. His ability, which no one but Cyrus had ever\nquestioned, may not have been of the highest order, but at least it was\nbetter stuff than had ever gone into the making of American plays. In\nthe early eighties profound darkness still hung over the stage, for the\nintellect of a democracy, which first seeks an outlet in statesmanship,\nsecondly in commerce, and lastly in art and literature, had hardly begun\nto express itself, with the immaturity of youth, in several of these\nlatter fields. It was Oliver's distinction as well as his misfortune\nthat he lived before his country was ready for him. Coming a quarter of\na century later, he might have made a part of a national emancipation of\nintellect. Coming when he did, he stood merely for one of the spasmodic\nreactions against the dominant spirit. Unwritten history is full of such\nreactions, since it is by the accumulated energy of their revolts that\nthe world moves on its way.\n\nBut at the age of twenty-two, though he was assured that he understood\nboth woman and the universe in which she belonged, he was pathetically\nignorant of his own place in the extravagance of Nature. With the rest\nof us, he would have been astounded at the suggestion that he might have\nbeen born to be wasted. Other things were wasted, he knew, since those\nwho called Nature an economist had grossly flattered her. Types and\nraces and revolutions were squandered with royal prodigality--but that\nhe himself should be so was clearly unthinkable. Deep down in him there\nwas the obstinate belief that his existence was a vital matter to the\nawful Power that ruled the universe; and while he worked that May\nevening at the second act of his great play, with the sweat raining from\nhis brow in the sweltering heat, it was as impossible for him to\nconceive of ultimate failure as it was for him to realize that he should\never cease to exist. The air was stagnant, the light was bad, his\nstomach was empty, and he was tormented by the stinging of the gnats\nthat circled around the flame--but he was gloriously happy with the\nhappiness of a man who has given himself to an idea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE ARTIST IN PHILISTIA\n\n\nAt dawn, after a sleepless night, Oliver dressed himself and made a cup\nof coffee on the spirit lamp he carried in his bag. While he drank, a\nsense of power passed over him like warmth. He was cheered, he was even\nexhilarated. A single cup of this miraculous fluid, and his depression\nwas vanquished as no argument could have vanquished it. Without\nsermonizing, without logic even, the demon of pessimism, which has its\nhome in an empty stomach, was expelled into spiritual darkness. He\nremembered that he had eaten nothing for almost twenty-four hours\n(having missed yesterday's dinner), and this thought carried him\ndownstairs, where he begged a roll from a yawning negro cook in the\nkitchen. Coming up to his room again, he poured out a second cup of\ncoffee, added a dash of cream, which he had brought with him in a\nhandleless pitcher, and leaning comfortably back in the worn horsehair\ncovered chair by the window, relapsed into a positive orgy of enjoyment.\nHis whole attitude toward the universe had been altered by a bubbling\npotful of brown liquid, and the tremendous result--so grotesquely out of\nproportion to its cause--appeared to him at the minute entirely right\nand proper. Everything was entirely right and proper, and he felt able\nto approve with a clear conscience the Divine arrangement of existence.\n\nOutside, the sunrise, which he could not see, was flooding the roofs of\nDinwiddie with a dull golden light. The heat had given way before the\nsoft wind which smelt of flowers, and scattered tiny shreds of mist,\nlike white rose-leaves, over the moist gardens. The look of unreality,\nwhich had been a fiction of the moonlight, faded gradually as the day\nbroke, and left the harsh outlines and the blackened chimneys of the\ntown unsoftened by any shadow of illusion. Presently, as the sunlight\nfell aslant the winding streets, there was a faint stir in the house;\nbut since the day was Sunday, and Dinwiddie observed the Sabbath by\nsleeping late, this stir was slow and drowsy, like the movement of\npeople but half awake. First, a dilapidated milk wagon rumbled through\nthe alleys to the back gates, where dishevelled negro maids ran out with\nearthenware pitchers, which went back foaming around the brims. Then the\ndoors of the houses opened slowly; the green outside shutters were flung\nwide; and an army of coloured servants bearing brooms, appeared on the\nporches, and made expressive gestures to one another over the railings.\nOccasionally, when one lifted a doormat in order to beat the dust out of\nit, she would forget to put it down again while she stared after the\nmilk cart. Nobody--not even the servants--seemed to regard the wasted\nhours as of any importance. It struck Oliver that the only use Dinwiddie\nmade of time was to kill it.\n\nHe fell to work with enthusiasm, and he was still working when the\nreverberations of the breakfast bell thundered in his ears. Going\ndownstairs to the dining-room, he found several thin and pinched looking\nyoung women, with their hats on and Sunday-school lessons beside their\nplates. Mrs. Peachey, still smiling her quizzical smile, sat at the head\nof the table, pouring coffee out of an old silver coffee-pot, which was\nbattered in on one side as if it had seen active service in the war.\nWhen, after a few hurried mouthfuls, he asked permission to return to\nhis work, she received his excuses with the same cheerful acquiescence\nwith which she accepted the decrees of Providence. It is doubtful,\nindeed, if her serenity, which was rooted in an heroic hopelessness,\ncould have been shaken either by the apologies of a boarder or by the\nappearance of an earthquake. Her happiness was of that invulnerable sort\nwhich builds its nest not in the luxuriant gardens of the emotions, but\nin the bare, rock-bound places of the spirit. Courage, humour, an\nadherence to conviction which is wedded to an utter inability to respect\nany opinion except one's own; loyalty which had sprung from a principle\ninto a passion; a fortifying trust, less in the Power that rules the\nuniverse than in the peculiar virtues of the Episcopal prayer-book when\nbound in black; a capacity for self-sacrifice which had made the South a\nnation of political martyrs; complacency, exaltation, narrowness of\nvision, and uncompromising devotion to an ideal--these were the\nqualities which had passed from the race into the individual and through\nthe individual again back into the very blood and the fibre of the race.\n\n\"Do you work on Sunday?\" she inquired sweetly, yet with the faintest\ntinge of disapproval in her tone.\n\nHe nodded. \"Once in a while.\"\n\n\"Saint James' Church is only a few minutes' walk from here; but I\nsuppose you are a Presbyterian, like your uncle?\"\n\nHis respectability he saw hung in the balance--for to have avowed\nhimself a freethinker would have dyed him socially only one shade less\nblack than to have declared himself a Republican--so, escaping without a\nfurther confession of faith, he ascended to his room and applied himself\nanew to the regeneration of the American drama. The dull gold light,\nwhich slept on the brick walls, began presently to slant in long beams\nover the roofs, which mounted like steps up the hillside, while as the\nmorning advanced, the mellow sound of chimes floated out on the\nstillness, calling Dinwiddians to worship, as it had called their\nfathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers before them. The Sabbath\ncalm, so heavy that an axe could hardly have dispelled it, filled the\ncurving streets and the square gardens like an invisible fog--a fog that\ndulled the brain and weighed down the eyelids and made the grim walls of\nthe Treadwell tobacco factory look as if they were rising out of a\ndream. Into this dream, under the thick boughs of mulberry trees, there\npassed presently a thin file of people, walking alone or in pairs. The\nmen were mostly old; but the women were of every age, and all except the\nvery young were clad in mourning and wore hanging veils on their\nbonnets. Though Oliver did not know it, he was, in reality, watching a\nprocession of those who, having once embraced a cause and lost it, were\ncontent to go on quietly in a hush of memory for the rest of life.\nPassion had once inflamed them, but they moved now in the inviolable\npeace which comes only to those who have nothing left that they may\nlose. At the end of the line, in the middle of the earthen roadbed\nwalked an old horse, with an earnest face and a dump cart hitched to\nhim, and in the cart were the boxes of books which Susan had helped\nOliver to pack the evening before. \"Who'd have thought she'd get them\nhere so soon?\" he said to himself. \"By George, she is a wonder! And\nSunday too!\"\n\nThe old horse, having reached the hilltop, disappeared behind the next\nhouse, and ten minutes later Mrs. Peachey escorted the smallest of his\nboxes into his bedroom.\n\n\"Your cousin is downstairs, but I didn't know whether you wanted me to\nbring her up here or not?\" she said.\n\n\"Of course you do, don't you, Oliver?\" asked Susan's voice, and entering\nthe room, she coolly presented her cheek to him. This coolness, which\nimpressed him almost as much as her extraordinary capability, made him\nfeel sometimes as if she had built a stone wall between them. Years\nafterwards he asked himself if this was why his admiration for her had\nnever warmed into love?\n\n\"Well, you're a good one!\" he exclaimed, as she drew back from the\ncasual embrace.\n\n\"I knew you were here,\" she answered, \"because John Henry Pendleton\"\n(was it his imagination or did the faintest blush tinge her face?) \"saw\nMajor Peachey last night and told me on his way home.\"\n\n\"You can't help me straighten up, I suppose? The room looks a sight.\"\n\n\"Not now--I'm on my way to church, and I'll be late if I don't hurry.\"\nShe wore a grey cashmere dress, made with a draped polonaise which\naccentuated her rather full hips, and a hat with a steeple crown that\ndid not suit the Treadwell arch of her nose. He thought she looked\nplain, but he did not realize that in another dress and hat she might\nhave been almost beautiful--that she was, indeed, one of those\nlarge-minded, passionately honest women who, in their scorn of pretence\nor affectation, rarely condescend to make the best of their appearances.\nTo have consciously selected a becoming hat would have seemed to her a\nspecies of coquetry, and coquetry, even the most innocent, she held in\nabhorrence. Her sincerity was not only intellectual; it was of that\nrarer sort which has its root in a physical instinct.\n\nAfter she had gone, he worked steadily for a couple of hours, and then\nopened one of the boxes Susan had brought and arranged a few of his\nbooks in a row on the mantelpiece. It was while he stood still undecided\nwhether to place \"The Origin of Species\" or \"The Critique of Pure\nReason\" on the end nearest his bed, that a knock came at his door, and\nthe figure of Miss Priscilla Batte, attired in a black silk dolman with\nbugle trimmings, stood revealed on the threshold.\n\n\"Sally Peachey just told me that you were here,\" she said, enfolding him\nin the embrace which seemed common to Dinwiddie, \"so I thought I would\nspeak to you on my way back from church. I don't suppose you've ever\nheard of me, but I am your cousin Priscilla Batte.\"\n\nThough he was entirely unaware of it, the moment was a momentous one in\nhis experience. The visit of Miss Priscilla may have appeared an\ninsignificant matter to those who have not learned that the\ninsignificant is merely the significant seen from another angle--but the\ntruth was that it marked a decisive milestone in his emotional history.\nEven Mrs. Peachey, who had walked back from church with her, and who\nharboured the common delusion that Life selects only slim bodies for its\nsecret agents, did not dream as she watched that enormous figure toil up\nthe staircase that she was gazing upon the movement of destiny. Had\nOliver been questioned as to the dominant influence in shaping his\ncareer, he would probably have answered blindly, but sincerely, \"The\nCritique of Pure Reason\"--so far was he from suspecting that his\nphilosophy had less control over his future than had the accident that\nhis mother was the third cousin of Priscilla Batte.\n\nHe pushed a chair into the widest space he could find, and she seated\nherself as modestly as if she were not the vehicle of the invisible\nPowers. The stiff grosgrain strings of her bonnet stood out like small\nwings under her double chin, and on her massive bosom he saw the cameo\nbrooch bearing the war-like profile of Athene. As she sat there, beaming\ncomplacently upon him, with her prayer-book and hymnal held at a decent\nangle in front of her, she seemed to Oliver to dominate the situation\nsimply by the solid weight of her physical presence. In her single\nperson she managed to produce the effect of a majority. As a mere mass\nof humanity she carried conviction.\n\n\"I was sorry not to see you at church,\" she said, \"but I suppose you\nwent with Cyrus.\" As he shook his head silently, she added hastily, \"I\nhope there's nothing wrong between you and him.\"\n\n\"Nothing except that I have decided not to go into the tobacco\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"But what in the world are you going to do? How are you going to live if\nhe doesn't provide for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll manage somehow. You needn't worry, Cousin Priscilla.\" He\nsmiled at her across the unfinished page of his play, and this smile won\nher as it had won Mrs. Peachey. Like most spinsters she had remained a\ncreature of sentiment, and the appeal of the young and masculine she\nfound difficult to resist. After all he was a charming boy, her heart\ntold her. What he needed was merely some good girl to take care of him\nand convert him to the Episcopal Church. And immediately, as is the way\nwith women, she became as anxious to sacrifice Virginia to this possible\nredemption of the male as she had been alarmed by the suspicion that\nsuch a desire existed in Susan. Though it would have shocked her to hear\nthat she held any opinion in common with Mohammed (who appeared in the\nuniversal history she taught only in a brief list of \"false prophets\"),\nthere existed deep down in her the feeling that a man's soul was of\ngreater consequence than a woman's in the eyes of God.\n\n\"I hope you haven't been foolish, Oliver,\" she said in a tone which\nconveyed an emotional sympathy as well as a moral protest.\n\n\"That depends upon what you mean by foolishness,\" he returned, still\nsmiling.\n\n\"Well, I don't think you ought to quarrel with Cyrus. He may not be\nperfect. I am not saying that he mightn't have been a better husband,\nfor instance--though I always hold the woman to blame when a marriage\nturns out a failure--but when all's said and done, he is a great man,\nOliver.\"\n\nHe shook his head impatiently. \"I've heard that until I'm sick of\nit--forgive me, Cousin Priscilla.\"\n\n\"Everybody admires him--that is, everybody except Belinda.\"\n\n\"I should say she'd had excellent opportunities for forming an opinion.\nWhat's he ever done, anyhow, that's great,\" he asked almost angrily,\n\"except accumulate money? It seems to me that you've gone mad over money\nin Dinwiddie. I suppose it's the reaction from having to do without it\nso long.\"\n\nMiss Priscilla, whose native serenity drew strength from another's loss\nof temper, beamed into his flushed face as if she enjoyed the spectacle\nof his heightened colour.\n\n\"You oughtn't to talk like that, Oliver,\" she said. \"How on earth are\nyou going to fall in love and marry, if you haven't any money to keep a\nwife? What you need is a good girl to look after you. I never married,\nmyself, but I am sometimes tempted to believe that even an unhappy\nmarriage is better than none at all. At least it gives you something to\nthink about.\"\n\n\"I have enough to think about already. I have my work.\"\n\n\"But work isn't a wife.\"\n\n\"I know it isn't, but I happen to like it better.\"\n\nHer matchmaking instinct had received a check, but the placid\ndetermination which was the basis of her character was merely reinforced\nthereby to further efforts. It was for his good to marry (had not her\nmother and her grandmother instilled into her the doctrine that an early\nmarriage was the single masculine safeguard, since, once married, a\nman's morality became not his own business, but his wife's), and marry\nhim she was resolved to do, either with his cheerful co-operation, or,\nif necessary, without it. He had certainly looked at Virginia as if he\nadmired her, and surely a girl like that--lovely, loving, unselfish to a\nfault, and trained from her infancy to excel in all the feminine\nvirtues--surely, this perfect flower of sex specialization could have\nbeen designed by Providence only for the delight and the sanctification\nof man.\n\n\"Then, if that is the way your mind is made up I hope you will be\ncareful not to trifle with the feelings of a girl like Jinny Pendleton,\"\nshe retorted severely.\n\nBy a single stroke of genius, inspired by the diplomacy inherent in a\nsex whose chief concern has been the making of matches, she transfixed\nhis imagination as skilfully as she might have impaled a butterfly on a\nbodkin. While he stared at her she could almost see the iridescent wings\nof his fancy whirling madly around the idea by which she had arrested\ntheir flight. Trifle with Virginia! Trifle with that radiant vision of\ngirlhood! All the chivalry of youth revolted from the suggestion, and he\nthought again of the wistful adoration in the eyes of a Perugino virgin.\nWas it possible that she could ever look at him with that angelic\nexpression of weakness and surrender? The fire of first love, which had\nsmouldered under the weight of his reason, burst suddenly into flame.\nHis thoughts, which had been as clear as a geometrical figure, became\nsuddenly blurred by the mystery upon which passion lives. He was seized\nby a consuming wonder about Virginia, and this wonder was heightened\nwhen he remembered the appealing sweetness in her face as she smiled up\nat him. Did she already love him? Had he conquered by a look the\nexquisite modesty of her soul? With this thought the memory of her\nvirginal shyness stung his senses as if it were the challenge of sex.\nChivalry, love, vanity, curiosity--all these circled helplessly around\nthe invisible axis of Miss Priscilla's idea.\n\n\"What do you mean? Surely you don't suppose--she hasn't said\nanything----\"\n\n\"You don't imagine that Jinny is the kind of girl who would say\nanything, do you?\" inquired Miss Priscilla.\n\n\"But there must be some reason why you should have----\"\n\n\"If there is, my dear boy, I'm not going to tell it,\" she answered with\na calmness which he felt, in his excited state, to be positively\ninfernal. \"All I meant was to warn you not to trifle with any girl as\ninnocent of life as Jinny Pendleton is. I don't want her to get her\nheart broken before she has the chance to make some man happy.\"\n\n\"Do you honestly mean to imply that I could break her heart if I tried\nto?\"\n\n\"I don't mean to imply anything. I am only telling you that she is just\nthe kind of girl a man would want to marry. She is her mother all over\nagain, and I don't believe Lucy has ever thought of herself a minute\nsince she married.\"\n\n\"She looks like an angel,\" he said, \"but----\"\n\n\"And she isn't a bit the kind of girl that Susan is, though they are so\ndevoted. Now, I can understand a man not wanting to marry Susan,\nbecause she is so full of ideas, and has a mind of her own about\nthings. But Jinny is different.\"\n\nThen, seeing that she had \"unsettled\" his mind sufficiently for her\npurpose, she rose and looked around the room with the inordinate\ncuriosity about details which kept her still young in spite of her sixty\nyears.\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me you brought all those books with you,\nOliver?\" she asked. \"Why on earth don't you get rid of some of them?\"\n\n\"I can't spare any of them. I never know which one I may want next.\"\n\n\"What are those you're putting on the mantelpiece? Isn't Darwin the name\nof the man who said we were all descended from monkeys?\"\n\nAs he made no answer to this except to press her hand and thank her for\ncoming, she left the mantelpiece and wandered to the window, where her\ngaze rested, with a look of maternal satisfaction, on the roofs of\nDinwiddie.\n\n\"It's a jolly view of the town, isn't it?\" he said. \"There's nothing\nlike looking down from a hilltop to give one a sense of superiority.\"\n\n\"You can see straight into Mrs. Goode's backyard,\" she replied, \"and I\nnever knew before that she left her clothes hanging on the line on\nSunday. That comes, I suppose, from not looking after her servants and\ngadding about on all sorts of charities. She told me the other day that\nshe belonged to every charitable organization in Dinwiddie.\"\n\n\"Is she Abby's mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, but you'd never imagine they were any relation. Abby gave me more\ntrouble than any girl I ever taught. She never would learn the\nmultiplication table, and I don't believe to this day she knows it.\nThere isn't any harm in her except that she is a scatter-brain, and will\nmake eyes or burst. I sometimes think it isn't her fault--that she was\njust born man-crazy.\"\n\n\"She's awfully good fun,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Are you going to her garden party on Wednesday?\"\n\n\"I accepted before I quarrelled with Uncle Cyrus, but I'll have to get\nout of it now.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't. All the pretty girls in town will be there.\"\n\n\"Are there any plain ones? And what becomes of them?\"\n\n\"The Lord only knows! Old Judge Bassett used to say that there wouldn't\nbe any preserves and pickles in the world if all women were born\ngood-looking. I declare I never realized how small the tower of Saint\nJames' Church is!\"\n\nFor a moment he hesitated, and when he spoke his voice had taken a\ndeeper tone. \"Will Virginia Pendleton be at the party?\" he asked.\n\n\"She wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. Miss Willy Whitlow was\nsewing there yesterday on a white organdie dress for her to wear. Have\nyou ever seen Jinny in white organdie? I always tell Lucy the child\nlooks sweet enough to eat when she puts it on.\"\n\nHe laughed again, but not as he had laughed at her description of Abby.\n\"Ask her please to put blue bows on her flounces and a red rose in her\nhair,\" he said.\n\n\"Then you are going?\"\n\n\"Not if I can possibly keep away. Oh, Cousin Priscilla, why didn't I\ninherit my soul from your side of the family.\"\n\n\"Well, for my part I don't believe in all this talk about inheritance.\nNobody ever heard of inheriting anything but money when I was a girl.\nYou've got the kind of soul the good Lord wanted to put into you and\nthat's all there is about it.\"\n\nWhen he returned from assisting her in her panting and difficult descent\nof the stairs, he sat down again before the unfinished act of his play,\nbut his eyes wandered from the manuscript to the town, which lay as\nbright and still in the sunlight as if it were imprisoned in crystal.\nThe wonder aroused in his mind by Miss Priscilla's allusion to Virginia\npersisted as a disturbing element in the background of his thoughts.\nWhat had she meant? Was it possible that there was truth in the wildest\nimaginings of his vanity? Virginia's face, framed in her wreath of hair,\nfloated beneath the tower of Saint James' Church at which he was gazing,\nand the radiant goodness in her look mounted like a draught of strong\nwine to his brain. Passion, which he had discounted in his plans for the\nfuture, appeared suddenly to shake the very foundations of his life.\nNever before had the spirit and the flesh united in the appeal of a\nwoman to his imagination. Never before had the divine virgin of his\ndreams assumed the living red and white of young girlhood. He thought\nhow soft her hair must be to the touch, and how warm her mouth would\nglow from his kisses. With a kind of wonder he realized that this was\nfirst love--that it was first love he had felt when he met her eyes\nunder the dappled sunlight in High Street. The memory of her beauty was\nlike a net which enmeshed his thoughts when he tried to escape it. Look\nwhere he would he saw always a cloud of dark hair and two deep blue eyes\nthat shone as softly as wild hyacinths after a shower. Think as he would\nhe met always the haunting doubt--\"What did she mean? Can it be true\nthat she already loves me?\" So small an incident as Miss Priscilla's\nSunday call had not only upset his work for the morning, but had changed\nin an instant the even course of his future. He decided suddenly that he\nmust see Virginia again--that he would go to Abby Goode's party, and\nthough the party was only three days off, it seemed to him that the\nwaiting would be almost unbearable. Only after he had once seen her\nwould it be possible, he felt, to stop thinking of her and to return\ncomfortably to his work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWHITE MAGIC\n\n\nIn the centre of her bedroom, with her back turned to that bookcase\nwhich was filled with sugared false-hoods about life, Virginia was\nstanding very straight while Miss Willy Whitlow knelt at her feet and\nsewed pale blue bows on her overskirt of white organdie. Occasionally,\nthe door opened softly, and the rector or one of the servants looked in\nto see \"Jinny\" or \"Miss Jinny dressed for the party,\" and when such\ninterruptions occurred, Mrs. Pendleton, who sat on an ottoman at the\ndressmaker's right hand and held a spool of thread and a pair of\nscissors in her lap, would say sternly, \"Don't move, Jinny, stand\nstraight or Miss Willy won't get the bows right.\" At these warning\nwords, Virginia's thin shoulders would spring back and the filmy ruffles\nstir gently over her girlish breast.\n\nThrough the open window, beyond the drooping boughs of the paulownia\ntrees, a few wistful stars shone softly through the web of purple\ntwilight. The night smelt of a thousand flowers--all the mingled\nsweetness of old gardens floated in on the warm wind and caressed the\nfaded figure of Miss Willy as lovingly as it did the young and radiant\nvision of Virginia. Once or twice the kneeling seamstress had glanced up\nat the girl and thought: \"I wonder how it feels to be as lovely as\nthat?\" Then she sighed as one who had missed her heritage, for she had\nbeen always plain, and went on patiently sewing the bows on Virginia's\noverskirt. \"You can't have everything in this world, and I ought to be\nthankful that I've kept out of the poorhouse,\" she added a minute later\nwhen a little stab of envy went through her at hearing the girl laugh\nfrom sheer happiness.\n\n\"Am I all right, mother? Tell me how I look.\"\n\n\"Lovely, darling. There won't be any one there sweeter than you are.\"\n\nThe maternal passion lit Mrs. Pendleton's eyes with splendour, and her\nworn face was illuminated as if a lamp had been held suddenly close to\nit. All day, in spite of a neuralgic pain in her temples, she had worked\nhard hemming the flounces for Virginia's dress, and into every stitch\nhad gone something of the divine ecstasy of martyrdom. Her life centred\nso entirely in her affections that apart from love she could be hardly\nsaid to exist at all. In spite of her trials she was probably the\nhappiest woman in Dinwiddie, for she had found her happiness in the only\nway it is ever won--by turning her back on it. Never once had she\nthought of it as an end to be pursued, never even as a flower to be\nplucked from the wayside. It is doubtful if she had ever stopped once in\nthe thirty years of her marriage to ask herself the questions: \"Is this\nwhat I want to do?\" or \"Does this make me happy?\" Love meant to her not\ngrasping, but giving, and in serving others she had served herself\nunawares. Even her besetting sin of \"false pride\" she indulged not on\nher own account, but because she, who could be humble enough for\nherself, could not bear to associate the virtue of humility with either\nher husband or her daughter.\n\nThe last blue bow was attached to the left side of the overskirt, and\nwhile Miss Willy rose from her knees, Virginia crossed to the window and\ngazed up at the pale stars over the tops of the paulownias. A joy so\nvibrant that it was like living music swelled in her breast. She was\nyoung! She was beautiful! She was to be loved! This preternatural\ncertainty of happiness was so complete that the chilling disappointments\nof the last few days had melted before it like frost in the sunlight. It\nwas founded upon an instinct so much deeper, so much more primitive than\nreason, that it resisted the logic of facts with something of the\nexalted obstinacy with which faith has resisted the arguments of\nphilosophy. Like all young and inexperienced creatures, she was\npossessed by the feeling that there exists a magnetic current of\nattraction between desire and the object which it desires. \"Something\ntold\" her that she was meant for happiness, and the voice of this\n\"something\" was more convincing than the chaotic march of phenomena.\nSorrow, decay, death--these appeared to her as things which must happen\ninevitably to other people, but from which she should be forever\nshielded by some beneficent Providence. She thought of them as vaguely\nas she did of the remote tragedies of history. They bore no closer\nrelation to her own life than did the French Revolution or the beheading\nof Charles the First. It was natural, if sad, that Miss Willy Whitlow\nshould fade and suffer. The world, she knew, was full of old people, of\nweary people, of blighted people; but she cherished passionately the\nbelief that these people were all miserable because, somehow, they had\nnot chosen to be happy. There appeared something positively\nreprehensible in a person who could go sighing upon so kind and\nbeautiful a planet. All things, even joy, seemed to her a mere matter of\nwilling. It was impossible that any hostile powers should withstand the\nradiant energy of her desire.\n\nLeaning there from the window, with her face lifted to the stars, and\nher mother's worshipping gaze on her back, she thought of the\n\"happiness\" which would be hers in the future: and this \"happiness\"\nmeant to her only the solitary experience of love. Like all the women of\nher race, she had played gallantly and staked her world upon a single\nchance. Whereas a man might have missed love and still have retained\nlife, with a woman love and life were interchangeable terms. That one\nemotion represented not only her sole opportunity of joy, it constituted\nas well her single field of activity. The chasm between marriage and\nspinsterhood was as wide as the one between children and pickles. Yet so\nsecret was this intense absorption in the thought of romance, that Mrs.\nPendleton, forgetting her own girlhood, would have been startled had she\npenetrated that lovely head and discovered the ecstatic dreams that\nflocked through her daughter's brain. Though love was the one window\nthrough which a woman might look on a larger world, she was fatuously\nsupposed neither to think of it nor to desire it until it had offered\nitself unsolicited. Every girl born into the world was destined for a\nheritage of love or of barrenness--yet she was forbidden to exert\nherself either to invite the one or to avoid the other. For, in spite of\nthe fiery splendour of Southern womanhood during the war years, to be\nfeminine, in the eyes of the period, was to be morally passive.\n\n\"Your father has come to see your dress, dear,\" said her mother in the\nvoice of a woman from whom sentiment overflowed in every tone, in every\nlook, in every gesture.\n\nTurning quickly, Virginia met the smiling eyes of the rector--those\nyoung and visionary eyes, which Nature, with a wistful irony, had placed\nbeneath beetling brows in the creased and wrinkled face of an old man.\nThe eyes were those of a prophet--of one who had lived his life in the\nlight of a transcendent inspiration rather than by the prosaic rule of\npractical reason; but the face belonged to a man who had aged before his\ntime under the accumulated stress of physical burdens.\n\n\"How do I look, father? Am I pretty?\" asked Virginia, stretching her\nthin young arms out on either side of her, and waiting with parted lips\nto drink in his praise.\n\n\"Almost as beautiful as your mother, and she grows lovelier every day\nthat she lives, doesn't she?\"\n\nHis adoring gaze, which held the spirit of beauty as a crystal holds the\nspirit of light, passed from the glowing features of Virginia to the\nlined and pallid face of his wife. In that gaze there had been no shadow\nof alteration for thirty years. It is doubtful even if he had seen any\nchange in her since he had first looked upon her face, and thought it\nalmost unearthly in its angelic fairness. From the physical union they\nhad entered into that deeper union of souls in which the body dissolves\nas the shadow dissolves into the substance, and he saw her always as\nshe had appeared to him on that first morning, as if the pool of\nsunlight in which she had stood had never darkened around her. Yet to\nVirginia his words brought a startled realization that her mother--her\nown mother, with her faded face and her soft, anxious eyes--had once\nbeen as young and radiant as she. The love of her parents for each other\nhad always seemed to her as natural and as far removed from the\ncloudless zone of romance as her own love for them--for, like most young\ncreatures, she regarded love as belonging, with bright eyes and rosy\ncheeks, to the blissful period of youth.\n\n\"I hear John Henry's ring, darling. Are you ready?\" asked Mrs.\nPendleton.\n\n\"In a minute. Is the rose right in my hair?\" replied Virginia, turning\nher profile towards her mother, while she flung a misty white scarf over\nher shoulders.\n\n\"Quite right, dear. I hope you will have a lovely time. I shall sit up\nfor you, so you needn't bother to take a key.\"\n\n\"But you'll be so tired. Can't you make her go to bed, father?\"\n\n\"I couldn't close my eyes till I knew you were safely home, and heard\nhow you'd enjoyed yourself,\" answered Mrs. Pendleton, as they slowly\ndescended the staircase, Virginia leading the way, and the rest\nfollowing in a procession behind her. Turning at the gate, with her arm\nin John Henry's, the girl saw them standing in the lighted doorway, with\ntheir tender gaze following her, and the faces of the little seamstress\nand the two coloured servants staring over their shoulders. Trivial as\nthe incident was, it was one of the moments which stood out afterwards\nin Virginia's memory as though a white light had fallen across it. Of\nsuch simple and expressive things life is woven, though the years had\nnot taught her this on that May evening.\n\nOn the Goodes' lawn lanterns bloomed, like yellow flowers among the\nbranches of poplar trees, and beneath them Mrs. Goode and Abby--a loud,\nhandsome girl, with a coarsened complexion and a \"sporting\"\nmanner--received their guests and waved them on to a dancing platform\nwhich had been raised between a rose-crowned summer-house and the old\nbrick wall at the foot of the garden. Ropes were stretched over the\nplatform, from the roof of the summer-house to a cherry tree at the end\nof the walk, and on these more lanterns of red, blue, and yellow paper\nwere hanging. The air was scented with honeysuckle, and from an obscure\ncorner behind a trellis the sound of a waltz floated. As music it was\nnot of a classic order, but this did not matter since nobody was aware\nof it; and Dinwiddie, which developed quite a taste for Wagner at the\nbeginning of the next century, could listen in the eighties with what\nwas perhaps a sincerer pleasure, to stringed instruments, a little\nrough, but played with fervour by mulatto musicians. As Virginia drifted\noff in John Henry's arms for the first dance, which she had promised\nhim, she thought: \"I wonder if he will not come after all?\" and a pang\nshot through her heart where the daring joy had been only a moment\nbefore. Then the music grew suddenly heavy while she felt her feet drag\nin the waltz. The smell of honeysuckle made her sad as if it brought\nback to her senses an unhappy association which she could not remember,\nand it seemed to her that her soul and body trembled, like a bent flame,\ninto an attitude of expectancy.\n\n\"Let me stop a minute. I want to watch the others,\" she said, drawing\nback into the scented dusk under a rose arbour.\n\n\"But don't you want to fill your card? If the men once catch sight of\nyou, you won't have a dance left.\"\n\n\"No--no, I want to watch a while,\" she said, with so strange an accent\nof irritation that he stared at her in surprise. The suspense in her\nheart hurt her like a drawn cord in throbbing flesh, and she felt angry\nwith John Henry because he was so dull that he could not see how she\nsuffered. In the distance, under the waving gilded leaves of the\npoplars, she saw Abby laughing up into a man's face, and she thought:\n\"Can he possibly be in love with Abby? Some men are mad about her, but I\nknow he isn't. He could never like a loud woman, and, besides, he\ncouldn't have looked at me that way if he hadn't cared.\" Then it seemed\nto her that something of the aching suspense in her own heart stole into\nAbby's laughing face while she watched it, and from Abby it passed\nonward into the faces of all the girls who were dancing on the raised\nplatform. Suspense! Was that a woman's life, after all? Never to be able\nto go out and fight for what one wanted! Always to sit at home and wait,\nwithout moving a foot or lifting a hand toward happiness! Never to dare\ngallantly! Never even to suffer openly! Always to will in secret, always\nto hope in secret, always to triumph or to fail in secret. Never to be\none's self--never to let one's soul or body relax from the attitude of\nexpectancy into the attitude of achievement. For the first time, born\nof the mutinous longing in her heart, there came to her the tragic\nvision of life. The faces of the girls, whirling in white muslin to the\nmusic of the waltz, became merged into one, and this was the face of all\nwomanhood. Love, sorrow, hope, regret, wonder, all the sharp longing and\nthe slow waiting of the centuries--above all the slow waiting--these\nthings were in her brief vision of that single face that looked back at\nher out of the whirling dance. Then the music stopped, the one face\ndissolved into many faces, and from among them Susan passed under the\nswinging lanterns and came towards her.\n\n\"Oh, Jinny, where have you been hiding? I promised Oliver I would find\nyou for him. He says he came only to look at you.\"\n\nThe music began joyously again; the young leaves, gilded by the yellow\nlantern-light, danced in the warm wind as if they were seized by the\nspirit of melody; and from the dusk of the trellis the ravished\nsweetness of honeysuckle flooded the garden with fragrance. With the\nvanished sadness in her heart there fled the sadness in the waltz and in\nthe faces of the girls who danced to the music. Waiting no longer seemed\npain to her, for it was enriched now by the burning sweetness of\nfulfilment.\n\nSuddenly, for she had not seen him approach, she was conscious that he\nwas at her side, looking down at her beneath a lantern which was\nbeginning to flicker. A sense of deep peace--of perfect contentment with\nthe world as God planned it--took possession of her. Even the minutes of\nsuspense seemed good because they had brought at last this swift rush\nof happiness. Every line of his face--of that face which had captured\nher imagination as though it had been the face of her dreams--was\nillumined by the quivering light that gilded the poplars. His eyes were\nso close to hers that she saw little flecks of gold on the brown, and\nshe grew dizzy while she looked into them, as if she stood on a height\nand feared to turn lest she should lose her balance and fall. A\ndelicious stillness, which began in her brain and passed to her\nthrobbing pulses, enveloped her like a perfume. While she stood there\nshe was incapable of thought--except the one joyous thought that this\nwas the moment for which she had waited since the hour of her birth.\nNever could she be the same afterwards! Never could she be unhappy again\nin the future! For, like other mortals in other ecstatic instants, she\nsurrendered herself to the intoxicating illusion of their immortality.\n\nAfter that silence, so charged with emotion for them both, it seemed\nthat when he spoke it must be to utter words that would enkindle the\nworld to beauty; but he said merely: \"Is this dance free? I came only to\nspeak to you.\"\n\nHis look added, \"I came because my longing had grown unbearable\"; and\nthough she replied only to his words, it was his look that made the\nhoneysuckle-trellis, the yellow lanterns, and the sky, with its few soft\nstars, go round like coloured balls before her eyes. The world melted\naway from her, and the distance between her and the whirling figures in\nwhite muslin seemed greater than the distance between star and star. She\nhad the sense of spiritual remoteness, of shining isolation, which\necstasy brings to the heart of youth, as though she had escaped from\nthe control of ordinary phenomena and stood in a blissful pause beyond\ntime and space. It was the supreme moment of love; and to her, whose\nsoul acknowledged no other supremacy than that of love, it was, also,\nthe supreme moment of life.\n\nHis face, as he gazed down at her under the swinging leaves, seemed to\nher as different from all other faces as the exquisite violence in her\nsoul was different from all other emotions she had ever known. She knew\nnothing more of him than that she could not be happy away from him. She\nneeded no more infallible proof of his perfection than the look in his\neyes when he smiled at her. So convincing was the argument of his smile\nthat it was not only impregnable against any assault of facts, but\nrendered futile even the underlying principle of reason. Had Aristotle\nhimself risen from his grave to prove to her that blind craving when\nmultiplied by blind possession does not equal happiness, his logic would\nhave been powerless before that unconquerable instinct which denied its\ntruth. And around them little white moths, fragile as rose-leaves,\ncircled deliriously in the lantern-light, for they, also, obeyed an\nunconquerable instinct which told them that happiness dwelt in the flame\nabove which they were whirling.\n\n\"I am glad you wore blue ribbons\" he said suddenly.\n\nHer lashes trembled and fell, but they could not hide the glow that\nshone in her eyes and in the faint smile which trembled, like an edge of\nlight, on her lips.\n\n\"Will you come into the summer-house and sit out this dance?\" he asked\nwhen she did not speak, and she followed him under the hanging clusters\nof early roses to a bench in the dusk beside a little rustic table.\nHere, after a moment's silence, he spoke again recklessly, yet with a\ncertain constraint of manner.\n\n\"I suppose I oughtn't to have come here to-night.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Their glances, bright as swords, crossed suddenly, and it\nseemed to her that the music grew louder. Had it been of any use, she\nwould have prayed Life to dole the minutes out, one by one, like a\nmiser. And all the time she was thinking: \"This is the moment I've\nwaited for ever since I was born. It has come. I am in the midst of it.\nHow can I keep it forever?\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't any business thinking about anything but my work,\" he\nanswered. \"I've broken with my uncle, you know. I'm as poor as a church\nmouse and I'll never be better off until I get a play on the stage. For\nthe next few years I've got to cut out everything but hard work.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Her tongue was paralyzed; she couldn't say what she felt, and\neverything else seemed to her horribly purposeless and ineffectual. She\nwondered passionately if he thought her a fool, for she could not look\ninto his mind and discover how adorable he found her monosyllabic\nresponses. The richness of her beauty combined with the poverty of her\nspeech made an irresistible appeal to the strongest part of him, which\nwas not his heart, but his imagination. He wondered what she would say\nif she were really to let herself go, and this wonder began gradually to\nenslave him.\n\n\"That's the reason I hadn't any business coming here,\" he added, \"but\nthe truth is I've wanted to see you again ever since that first\nafternoon. I got to wondering whether,\" he laughed in an embarrassed\nway, and added with an attempt at levity, \"whether you would wear a red\nrose in your hair.\"\n\nAt his change of tone, she reached up suddenly, plucked the rose from\nher hair and flung it out on the grass. Her action, which belied her\ngirlish beauty so strangely that only her mother would have recognized\nit as characteristic of the hidden force of the woman, held him for an\ninstant speechless under her laughing eyes. Then turning away, he picked\nup the rose and put it into his pocket.\n\n\"I suppose you will never tell me why you did that?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I can't tell. I don't know. Something took me.\"\n\n\"Did you think I came just for the rose?\"\n\n\"I didn't think.\"\n\n\"If I came for the rose, I ought to go. I wish I could. Do you suppose\nI'll be able to work again now that I've seen you? I've told myself for\nthree days that if I could only see you again I'd be able to stop\nthinking about you.\"\n\nShe was not looking at him, but in every line of her figure, in every\nquiver of her lashes, in every breath that she drew, he read the effect\nof his words. It was as if her whole palpitating loveliness had become\nthe vehicle of an exquisite entreaty. Her soul seemed to him to possess\nthe purity, not of snow, but of flame, and this flame, in whose light\nnothing evil could live, curved towards him as if blown by a wind. He\nfelt suddenly that he was swept onward by some outside power which was\nstronger than his will. An enchantment had fallen over him, and at one\nand the same instant he longed to break the power of the spell and knew\nthat life would cease to be worth living if he were ever to do so. He\nsaw her eyes, like blue flowers in the soft dusk, and the mist of curls\non her temples stirred gently in the scented breeze that blew over the\ngarden. All the sweetness of the world was gathered into the little\nspace that she filled. Every impulse of joy he had ever felt--memories\nof autumn roads, of starlit mountains, of summer fields where bees\ndrifted in golden clouds--all these were packed like honey into that\nsingle minute of love. And with the awakening of passion, there came the\nexaltation, the consciousness of illimitable possibilities which passion\nbrings to the young. Never before had he realized the power that was in\nhim! Never until this instant had he seen his own soul in the making!\nAll the unquenchable faith of youth burned at white heat in the flame\nwhich his desire had kindled. He felt himself divided between an\ninvincible brutality and an invincible tenderness. He would have fought\nwith beasts for the sake of the gentle and passive creature beside him,\nyet he would have died rather than sully the look of angelic goodness\nwith which she regarded him. To have her always gentle, always passive,\nnever reaching out her hand, never descending to his level, but sitting\nforever aloof and colourless, waiting eternally, patient, beautiful and\nunwearied, to crown the victory--this was what the conquering male in\nhim demanded.\n\n\"I ought to go,\" he said, so ineffectual was speech to convey the tumult\nwithin his brain. \"I am keeping you from the others.\"\n\nShe had shrunk back into the dimness beyond the circle of lanterns, and\nhe saw her face like a pale moon under the clustering rose-leaves. Her\nvery breath seemed suspended, and there was a velvet softness in her\nlook and in the gesture of timid protest with which she responded to his\nhalting words. She was putting forth all her woman's power as innocently\nas the honeysuckle puts forth its fragrance. The white moths whirling in\ntheir brief passion over the lantern-flame were not more helpless before\nthe movement of those inscrutable forces which we call Life. A strange\nstillness surrounded her--as though she were separated by a circle of\nsilence from the dancers beyond the rose-crowned walls of the\nsummer-house--and into this stillness there passed, like an invisible\ncurrent, the very essence of womanhood. The longing of all the dead\nwomen of her race flowed through her into the softness of the spring\nevening. Things were there which she could know only through her\nblood--all the mute patience, all the joy that is half fear, all the\nage-long dissatisfaction with the merely physical end of love--these\nwere in that voiceless entreaty for happiness; and mingled with them,\nthere were the inherited ideals of self-surrender, of service, pity,\nloyalty, and sacrifice.\n\n\"I wish I could help you,\" she said, and her voice thrilled with the\ncraving to squander herself magnificently in his service.\n\n\"You are an angel, and I'm a selfish beast to bring you my troubles.\"\n\n\"I don't think you are selfish--of course you have to think of your\nwork--a man's work means so much to him.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful of you to feel that,\" he replied; and, indeed, at the\ninstant while he searched her eyes in the dusk, the words seemed to him\nto embody all the sympathetic understanding with which his imagination\nendowed her. How perfectly her face expressed the goodness and\ngentleness of her soul! What a companion she would make to a man! What a\nlover! What a wife! Always soft, exquisite, tender, womanly to the\ninnermost fibre of her being, and perfect in unselfishness as all\nwomanly women are. How easy it would be to work if she were somewhere\nwithin call, ready to fly to him at a word! How glorious to go out into\nthe world if he knew that she sat at home waiting--always waiting, with\nthose eyes like wells of happiness, until he should return to her! A new\nmeaning had entered swiftly into life. A feeling that was like a\nreligious conversion had changed not only his spiritual vision, but the\nmaterial aspect of nature. Whatever happened, he felt that he could\nnever be the same man again.\n\n\"I shall see you soon?\" he said, and the words fell like snow on the\ninner flame of his senses.\n\n\"Oh, soon!\" she answered, bending a little towards him while a sudden\nglory illumined her features. Her voice, which was vibrant as a harp,\nhad captured the wistful magic of the spring--the softness of the winds,\nthe sweetness of flowers, the mellow murmuring of the poplars.\n\nShe rose from the bench, moving softly as if she were under an\nenchantment which she feared to break by a gesture. An ecstasy as\ninarticulate as grief kept him silent, and it was into this silence that\nthe voice of Abby floated, high, shrill, and dominant.\n\n\"Oh, Virginia, I've looked everywhere for you,\" she cried. \"Mr.\nCarrington is simply dying to dance with you!\"\n\nShe bounced, as only the solid actuality can bounce, into the dream,\nprecipitating the unwelcome presence of Mr. Carrington--a young man with\na golden beard and the manner of a commercial minor prophet--there also.\nA few minutes later, as Virginia drifted away in his arms to the music\nof the waltz, she saw, over the heads of the dancers, Oliver and Abby\nwalking slowly in the direction of the gate. A feeling of unreality\nseized her, as though she were looking through an azure veil at the\nworld. The dancers among whom she whirled, the anxious mothers sitting\nuneasily on chairs under the poplars, the flowering shrubs, the\nrose-crowned summer-house, the yellow lanterns with the clouds of white\nmoths circling around them--all these things had turned suddenly to\nshadows; and through a phantom garden, the one living figure moved\nbeside an empty shape, which was Abby. Her feet had wings. She flew\nrather than danced in the arms of a shadow through this blue veil which\nenveloped her. Life burned within her like a flame in a porcelain vase,\nand this inner fire separated her, as genius separates its possessor,\nfrom the ordinary mortals among whom she moved.\n\nWalking home with John Henry after the party was over, it seemed to her\nthat she was lifted up and cradled in all the wonderful freshness of the\nspring. The sweet moist air fanned her face; the morning stars shone\nsoftly on her through the pearly mist; and the pale fingers of dawn were\nspread like a beneficent hand, above the eastern horizon. \"To-morrow!\"\ncried her heart, overflowing with joy; and something of this joy passed\ninto the saddest hour of day and brightened it to radiance.\n\nAt the gate she parted from John Henry, and running eagerly along the\npath, opened the front door, which was unlocked, and burst into the\ndining-room, where her mother, wearied of her long watch, had fallen\nasleep beside the lamp, which was beginning to flicker.\n\n\"To-morrow!\" still sang her heart, and the wild, sweet music of it\nfilled the world. \"To-morrow!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE GREAT MAN MOVES\n\n\nSeveral weeks later, at the close of a June afternoon, Cyrus Treadwell\nsat alone on the back porch of his house in Bolingbroke Street. He was\nsmoking, and, between the measured whiffs of his pipe, he leaned over\nthe railing and spat into a bed of miniature sunflowers which grew along\nthe stone ledge of the area. For thirty years these flowers had sprung\nup valiantly every spring in that bleak strip of earth, and for thirty\nyears Cyrus had spat among them while he smoked alone on the back porch\non June afternoons.\n\nWhile he sat there a great peace enfolded and possessed him. The street\nbeyond the sagging wooden gate was still; the house behind him was\nstill; the kitchen, in which showed the ebony silhouette of a massive\ncook kneading dough, was still with the uncompromising stillness of the\nSabbath. In the midst of this stillness, his thoughts, which were\nusually as angular as lean birds on a bough, lost their sharpness of\noutline and melted into a vague and feathery mass. At the moment it was\nimpossible to know of what he was thinking, but he was happy with the\nhappiness which visits men of small parts and of sterile imagination. By\nvirtue of these limitations and this sterility he had risen out of\nobscurity--for the spiritual law which decrees that to gain the world\none must give up one's soul, was exemplified in him as in all his\nclass. Success, the shibboleth of his kind, had controlled his thoughts\nand even his impulses so completely for years that he had come at last\nto resemble an animal less than he resembled a machine; and Nature (who\nhas a certain large and careless manner of dispensing justice) had\npunished him in the end by depriving him of the ordinary animal capacity\nfor pleasure. The present state of vacuous contentment was, perhaps, as\nnear the condition of enjoyment as he would ever approach.\n\nHalf an hour before he had had an encounter with Susan on the subject of\nher going to college, but even his victory, which had been sharp and\nswift, was robbed of all poignant satisfaction by his native inability\nto imagine what his refusal must have meant to her. The girl had stood\nstraight and tall, with her commanding air, midway between the railing\nand the weather-stained door of the house.\n\n\"Father, I want to go to college,\" she had said quite simply, for she\nwas one who used words very much as Cyrus used money, with a\ntemperamental avoidance of all extravagance.\n\nHer demand was a direct challenge to the male in Cyrus, and, though this\ncreature could not be said to be either primitive or predatory, he was\nstill active enough to defend himself from the unprovoked assault of an\noffspring.\n\n\"Tut-tut,\" he responded. \"If you want something to occupy you, you'd\nbetter start about helping your mother with her preserving.\"\n\n\"I put up seventy-five jars of strawberries.\"\n\n\"Well, the blackberries are coming along. I was always partial to\nblackberries.\"\n\nHe sat there, bald, shrunken, yellow, as soulless as a steam engine, and\nyet to Susan he represented a pitiless manifestation of destiny--of\nthose deaf, implacable forces by which the lives of men and women are\nwrecked. He had the power to ruin her life, and yet he would never see\nit because he had been born blind. That in his very blindness had lain\nhis strength, was a fact which, naturally enough, escaped her for the\nmoment. The one thought of which she was conscious was a fierce\nresentment against life because such men possessed such power over\nothers.\n\n\"If you will lend me the money, I will pay it back to you as soon as I\ncan take a position,\" she said, almost passionately.\n\nSomething that was like the ghost of a twinkle appeared in his eyes, and\nhe let fall presently one of his rare pieces of humour.\n\n\"If you'd like a chance to repay me for your education,\" he said,\n\"there's your schooling at Miss Priscilla's still owing, and I'll take\nit out in help about the housekeeping.\"\n\nThen Susan went, because going in silence was the only way that she\ncould save the shreds of dignity which remained to her, and bending\nforward, with a contented chuckle, Cyrus spat benevolently down upon the\nminiature sunflowers.\n\nIn the half hour that followed he did not think of his daughter. From\nlong discipline his mind had fallen out of the habit of thinking of\npeople except in their relation to the single vital interest of his\nlife, and this interest was not fatherhood. Susan was an incident--a\nless annoying incident, it is true, than Belinda--but still an incident.\nAn inherent contempt for women, due partly to qualities of temperament\nand partly to the accident of a disillusioning marriage, made him\naddress them always as if he were speaking from a platform. And, as is\noften the case with men of cold-blooded sensuality, women, from Belinda\ndownward, had taken their revenge upon him.\n\nThe front door-bell jangled suddenly, and a little later he heard a\nspringy step passing along the hall. Then the green lattice door of the\nporch opened, and the face of Mrs. Peachey, wearing the look of\nunnatural pleasantness which becomes fixed on the features of persons\nwho spend their lives making the best of things, appeared in the spot\nwhere Susan had been half an hour before. She had trained her lips to\nsmile so persistently and so unreasonably, that when, as now, she would\nhave preferred to present a serious countenance to an observer, she\nfound it impossible to relax the muscles of her mouth from their\nexpression of perpetual cheerfulness. Cyrus, who had once remarked of\nher that he didn't believe she could keep a straight face at her own\nfuneral, wondered, while he rose and offered her a chair, whether the\nperiodical sprees of honest Tom were the cause or the result of the look\nof set felicity she wore. For an instant he was tempted to show his\nannoyance at the intrusion. Then, because she was a pretty woman and did\nnot belong to him, he grew almost playful, with the playfulness of an\nuncertain tempered ram that is offered salt.\n\n\"It is not often that I am honoured by a visit from you,\" he said.\n\n\"The honour is mine. Mr. Treadwell,\" she replied, and she really felt\nit. \"I was on my way upstairs to see Belinda, and it just crossed my\nmind as I saw you sitting out here, that I'd better stop and speak to\nyou about your nephew. I wonder Belinda doesn't plant a few rose-bushes\nalong that back wall,\" she added.\n\n\"I'd pay you fifty dollars, ma'am, if you'd get Belinda to plant\nanything\"--which was not delicately put, perhaps, but was, after all,\nspoken in the only language that Cyrus knew.\n\n\"I thought she was so fond of flowers. She used to be as a girl.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" was Cyrus's rejoinder, and then: \"Well, what about my nephew,\nmadam?\" Clasping his bony hands over his knee, he leaned forward and\nwaited, not without curiosity, for her answer. He did not admire\nOliver--he even despised him--but when all was said, the boy had\nsucceeded in riveting his attention. However poorly he might think of\nhim, the fact remained that think of him he did. The young man was in\nthe air as inescapably as if he were the measles.\n\n\"I'm worrying about him, Mr. Treadwell; I can't help myself. You know he\nboards with me.\"\n\n\"Yes'm, I know,\" replied Cyrus--for he had heard the fact from Miss\nPriscilla on his way home from church one Sunday.\n\n\"And he's not well. There's something the matter with him. He's so\nnervous and irritable that he's almost crazy. He doesn't eat a morsel,\nand I can hear him pacing up and down his room until daybreak. Once I\ngot up and went upstairs to ask him if he was sick, but he said that he\nwas perfectly well and was walking about for exercise. I am sure I don't\nknow what it can be, but if it keeps up, he'll land in an asylum before\nthe summer is over.\"\n\nThe look of satisfaction which her first words had brought to Cyrus's\nface deepened gradually as her story unfolded. \"He's wanting money, I\nreckon,\" he commented, his imagination seizing upon the only medium in\nwhich it could work. As a philosopher may discern in all life different\nmanifestations of the Deity, so he saw in all affliction only the\nwanting of money under varied aspects. Sorrows in which the lack of\nmoney did not bear a part always seemed to him to be unnecessary and\ngenerally self-inflicted by the sufferers. Of such people he would say\nimpatiently that they took a morbid view of their troubles and were\n\"nursing grief.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's that,\" said Mrs. Peachey. \"He always pays his bills\npromptly on the first day of the month, and I know that he gets checks\nfrom New York for the writing he does. I'm sometimes tempted to believe\nthat he has fallen in love.\"\n\n\"Love? Pshaw!\" said Cyrus, and dismissed the passion.\n\n\"But it goes hard with some people, and he's one of that kind,\" rejoined\nthe little lady, with spirit, for in spite of her wholesome awe of\nCyrus, she could not bear to hear the sentiment derided. \"We aren't all\nas sensible as you are, Mr. Treadwell.\"\n\n\"Well, if he is in love, as you say, whom is he in love with?\" demanded\nCyrus.\n\n\"It's all guesswork,\" answered Mrs. Peachey. \"He isn't paying attention\nto any girl that I know of--but, I suppose, if it's anybody, it must be\nVirginia Pendleton. All the young men are crazy about her.\"\n\nShe had been prepared for opposition--she had been prepared, being a\nlady, for anything, as she told Tom afterwards, short of an oath--but to\nher amazement the unexpected, which so rarely happened in the case of\nCyrus, happened at that minute. Human nature, which she had treated\nalmost as a science, proved suddenly that it was not even an art. One of\nthose glaring inconsistencies which confute every theory and overturn\nall psychology was manifested before her.\n\n\"That's the daughter of old Gabriel, aint it?\" asked Cyrus, and\nunconsciously to himself, his voice softened.\n\n\"Yes, she's Gabriel's daughter, and one of the sweetest girls that ever\nlived.\"\n\n\"Gabriel's a good man,\" said Cyrus. \"I always liked Gabriel. We fought\nthrough the war together.\"\n\n\"A better man never lived, nor a better woman than Lucy. If she's got a\nfault on earth, it's that she's too unselfish.\"\n\n\"Well, if this girl takes after them, the young fool has shown more\nsense than I gave him credit for.\"\n\n\"I don't think he's a fool,\" returned Mrs. Peachey, reflecting how\nwonderfully she had \"managed\" the great man, \"but, of course, he's\nqueer--all writers are queer, aren't they?\"\n\n\"He's kept it up longer than I thought, but I reckon he's about ready to\ngive in,\" pursued Cyrus, ignoring her question as he did all excursions\ninto the region of abstract wonder. \"If he'll start in to earn his\nliving now, I'll let him have a job on the railroad out in Matoaca City.\nI meant to teach him a lesson, but I shouldn't like Henry's son to\nstarve. I've nothing against Henry except that he was too soft. He was\na good brother as brothers go, and I haven't forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, if you'd talk to Oliver,\" suggested Mrs. Peachey. \"I'm afraid\nI couldn't induce him to come to you, but----\"\n\n\"Oh, I ain't proud--I don't need to be,\" interrupted Cyrus with a\nchuckle. \"Only fools and the poor have any use for pride. I'll look in\nupon him sometime along after supper, and see if he's come to his wits\nsince I last talked to him.\"\n\n\"Then, I'm glad I came to you. Tom would be horrified almost to death if\nhe knew of it--but I've always said that when an idea crosses my mind\njust like that,\" she snapped her thumb and forefinger, \"there's\nsomething in it.\"\n\nAs she rose from her seat, she looked up at him with the coquetry which\nwas so inalienable an attribute of her soul that, had the Deity assumed\nmasculine shape before her, she would instinctively have used this\nweapon to soften the severity of His judgment. \"It was so kind of you\nnot to send me away, Mr. Treadwell,\" she said in honeyed accents.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to meet such a sensible woman,\" replied Cyrus, with\nawkward gallantry. Her flattery had warmed him pleasantly, and in the\nmidst of the dried husks of his nature, he was conscious suddenly that a\nsingle blade of living green still survived. He had ceased to feel\nold--he felt almost young again--and this rejuvenation had set in merely\nbecause a middle-aged woman, whom he had known since childhood, had\nshown an innocent pleasure in his society. Mrs. Peachey's traditional\nbelief in the power of sex had proved its own justification.\n\nWhen she had left him, Cyrus sat down again, and took up his pipe from\nthe railing where he had placed it. \"I'll go round and have some words\nwith the young scamp,\" he thought. \"There's no use waiting until after\nsupper. I'll go round now while it is light.\"\n\nThen, as if the softening impulse were a part of the Sabbath stillness,\nhe leaned over the bed of sunflowers, and fixed his eyes on the pinkish\ntower of Saint James' Church, which he could see palely enkindled\nagainst the afterglow. A single white cloud floated like a dove in the\nwest, and beneath it a rain of light fell on the shadowy roofs of the\ntown. The air was so languorous that it was as if the day were being\nslowly smothered in honeysuckle, the heavy scent of which drifted to him\nfrom the next garden. A vast melancholy--so vast that it seemed less the\neffect of a Southern summer than of a universal force residing in\nnature--was liberated, with the first cooling breath of the evening,\nfrom man and beast, from tree and shrub, from stock and stone. The very\nbricks, sun-baked and scarred, spoke of the weariness of heat, of the\nparching thirst of the interminable summers.\n\nBut to Cyrus the languor and the intense sweetness of the air suggested\nonly that the end of a hot day had come. \"It's likely to be a drought,\"\nhe was thinking while his upward gaze rested on the illuminated tower of\nthe church. \"A drought will go hard with the tobacco.\"\n\nHaving emptied his pipe, he was about to take down his straw hat from a\nnail on the wall, when the sound of the opening gate arrested him, and\nhe waited with his eyes fixed on the winding brick walk, where the negro\nwasherwoman appeared presently with a basket of clean clothes on her\nhead. Beneath her burden he saw that there were some primitive attempts\nat Sunday adornment. She wore a green muslin dress, a little discoloured\nby perspiration, but with many compensating flounces; a bit of yellow\nribbon floated from her throat, and in her hand she carried the festive\nhat which would decorate her head after the removal of the basket. Her\nfigure, which had once been graceful, had grown heavy; and her face, of\na light gingerbread colour, with broad, not unpleasant features, wore a\nhumble, inquiring look--the look of some trustful wild animal that man\nhas tamed and only partly domesticated. Approaching the steps, she\nbrought down the basket from her head, and came on, holding it with a\ndeprecating swinging movement in front of her.\n\n\"Howdy, Marster,\" she said, as if uncertain whether to stop or to pass\non into the doorway.\n\n\"Howdy, Mandy,\" responded Cyrus. \"There's a hot spell coming, I reckon.\"\n\nLowering the basket to the floor of the porch, the woman drew a red\nbandanna handkerchief from her bosom and began slowly to wipe the drops\nof sweat from her face and neck. The acrid odour of her flesh reached\nCyrus, but he made no movement to draw away from her.\n\n\"I'se been laid up wid er stitch in my side, Marster, so I'se jes got\ndese yer close done dis mawnin'. Dar wan' noner de chillen at home ter\ntote um down yer, so I low I 'uz gwine ter drap by wid um on my way ter\nchurch.\"\n\nAs he did not reply, she hesitated an instant and over her features,\nwhich looked as if they had been flattened by a blow, there came an\nexpression which was half scornful, half inviting, yet so little\npersonal that it might have been worn by one of her treetop ancestors\nwhile he looked down from his sheltering boughs on a superior species of\nthe jungle. The chance effect of light and shadow on a grey rock was\nhardly less human or more primitive.\n\n\"I'se gittin' moughty well along, Marster,\" she said; \"I reckon I'se\ngittin' on toward a hunnard.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Mandy, you ain't a day over thirty-five. There's a plenty of\nlife left in you yet.\"\n\n\"Go way f'om yer, Marster; you knows I'se a heap older 'n dat. How long\nago was hit I done fust come yer ter you all?\"\n\nHe thought a moment. A question of calculation always interested him,\nand he prided himself on his fine memory for dates.\n\n\"You came the year our son Henry died, didn't you? That was in\n'66--eighteen years ago. Why, you couldn't have been over fifteen that\nsummer.\"\n\nFor the first time a look of cunning--of the pathetic cunning of a child\npitted against a man--awoke in her face.\n\n\"En Miss Lindy sent me off befo' de year was up, Marster. My boy Jubal\nwas born de mont' atter she done tu'n me out.\" She hesitated a minute,\nand then added, with a kind of savage coquetry, \"I 'uz a moughty likely\ngal, Marster. You ain't done furgit dat, is you?\"\n\nHer words touched Cyrus like the flick of a whip on a sore, and he drew\nback quickly while his thin lips grew tight.\n\n\"You'd better take that basket into the house,\" he said sharply.\n\nIn the negress's face an expression of surprise wavered for a second and\nthen disappeared. Her features resumed their usual passive and humble\nlook--a look which said, if Cyrus could have read human nature as easily\nas he read finance, \"I don't understand, but I submit without\nunderstanding. Am I not what you have made me? Have I not been what you\nwanted? And yet you despise me for being the thing you made.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean nuttin', Marster. I didn't mean nuttin',\" she protested\naloud.\n\n\"Then get into the house,\" retorted Cyrus harshly, \"and don't stand\ngaping there. Any more of your insolence and I'll never let you set foot\nin this yard again.\"\n\n\"'Fo' de Lawd, I didn't mean nuttin'! Gawd a' moughty, I didn't mean\nnuttin'! I jes lowed as you mought be willin' ter gun me fo' dollars a\nmont' fur de washin'. My boy Jubal----\"\n\n\"I'll not give you a red cent more. If you don't want it, you can leave\nit. Get out of here!\"\n\nAll the primitive antagonism of race--that instinct older than\ncivilization--was in the voice with which he ordered her out of his\nsight. \"It was downright blackmail. The fool was trying to blackmail\nme,\" he thought. \"If I'd yielded an inch I'd have been at her mercy.\nIt's a pretty pass things have come to when men have to protect\nthemselves from negro women.\" The more he reflected on her impudence,\nthe stronger grew his conviction that he had acted remarkably well.\n\"Nipped it in the root. If I hadn't----\" he thought.\n\nAnd behind him in the doorway the washerwoman continued to regard him,\nover the lowered clothes basket, with her humble and deprecating look,\nwhich said, like the look of a beaten animal: \"I don't understand, but\nI submit without understanding because you are stronger than I.\"\n\nTaking down his hat, Cyrus turned away from her, and descended the\nsteps. \"I'll look up Henry's son before supper,\" he was thinking. \"Even\nif the boy's a fool, I'm not one to let those of my own blood come to\nwant.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOLIVER SURRENDERS\n\n\nWhen Cyrus's knock came at his door, Oliver crossed the room to let in\nhis visitor, and then fell back, startled, at the sight of his uncle. \"I\nwonder what has brought him here?\" he thought inhospitably. But even if\nhe had put the question, it is doubtful if Cyrus could have enlightened\nhim--for the great man was so seldom visited by an impulse that when, as\nnow, one actually took possession of him, he obeyed the pressure almost\nunconsciously. Like most men who pride themselves upon acting solely\nfrom reason, he was the abject slave of the few instincts which had\nmanaged to take root and thrive in the stony ground of his nature. The\nfeeling for family, which was so closely entwined with his supreme\nfeeling for property that the two had become inseparable, moved him\nto-day as it had done on the historic occasion when he had redeemed the\nmortgaged roof over the heads of his spinster relations. Perhaps, too,\nsome of the vague softness of June had risen in him and made him gentler\nin his judgments of youth.\n\n\"I didn't expect you or I'd have straightened up a bit,\" said Oliver,\nnot overgraciously, while he hastily pushed his supper of bread and tea\nto one end of the table. He resented what he called in his mind \"the\nintrusion,\" and he had no particular objection to his uncle's observing\nhis resentment. His temper, never of the most perfect equilibrium, had\nbeen entirely upset by the effects of a June Sunday in Dinwiddie, and\nthe affront of Cyrus's visit had become an indignity because of his\nunfortunate selection of the supper hour. Some hidden obliquity in the\nTreadwell soul, which kept it always at cross-purposes with life,\nprevented any lessening of the deep antagonism between the old and the\nyoung of the race. And so incurable was this obliquity in the soul of\nCyrus, that it forced him now to take a tone which he had resolutely set\nhis mind against from the moment of Mrs. Peachey's visit. He wanted to\nbe pleasant, but something deep down within him--some inherited tendency\nto bully--was stronger than his will.\n\n\"I looked in to see if you hadn't about come to your senses,\" he began.\n\n\"If you mean come to your way of looking at things--then I haven't,\"\nreplied Oliver, and added in a more courteous tone, \"Won't you sit\ndown?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I can stand long enough to say what I came to say,\" retorted\nthe other, and it seemed to him that the pleasanter he tried to make his\nvoice, the harsher grew the sound of it in his ears. What was it about\nthe rascal that rubbed him the wrong way only to look at him?\n\n\"As you please,\" replied Oliver quietly. \"What in thunder has he got to\nsay to me?\" he thought. \"And why can't he say it and have it over?\"\nWhile Cyrus merely despised him, he detested Cyrus with all the fiery\nintolerance of his age. \"Standing there like an old turkey gobbler,\nugh!\" he said contemptuously to himself.\n\n\"So you ain't hungry yet?\" asked the old man, and felt that the words\nwere forced out of him by that obstinate cross-grain in his nature over\nwhich he had no control.\n\n\"I've just had tea.\"\n\n\"You haven't changed your mind since you last spoke to me, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't changed my mind. Why should I?\"\n\n\"Getting along pretty well, then?\"\n\n\"As well as I expected to.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said Cyrus mildly. \"That's good. I just dropped in to\nmake sure that you were getting along, that's all.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" responded Oliver, and tried from the bottom of his soul to\nmake the words sincere.\n\n\"If the time ever comes when you feel that you have changed your mind,\nI'll find a place out at Matoaca City for you. I just wanted you to\nunderstand that I'd do as much for Henry's son then as now. If you\nweren't Henry's son, I shouldn't think twice about you.\"\n\n\"You mean that you'll still give me the job if I stop writing plays?\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't make a point of that as long as it doesn't interfere with\nyour work. You may write in off hours as much as you want to. I won't\nmake a point of that.\"\n\n\"You mean to be generous, I can see--but I don't think it likely that I\nshall ever make up my mind to take a regular job. I'm not built for it.\"\n\n\"You're not thinking about getting married, then, I reckon?\"\n\nA dark flush rose to Oliver's forehead, and turning away, he stared with\nunseeing eyes out of the window.\n\n\"No. I haven't any intention of that,\" he responded.\n\nA certain craftiness appeared in Cyrus's face.\n\n\"Well, well, you're young yet, and you may be in want of a wife before\nyou're many years older.\"\n\n\"I'm not the kind to marry. I'm too fond of my freedom.\"\n\n\"Most of us have felt like that at one time or another, but when the\nthought of a woman takes you by the throat, you'll begin to see things\ndifferently. And if you ever do, a good steady job at twelve hundred a\nyear will be what you'll look out for.\"\n\n\"I suppose a man could marry on that down here,\" said Oliver, half\nunconscious that he was speaking aloud.\n\n\"I married on less, and I've known plenty of others that have done so. A\ngood saving wife puts more into a man's pocket than she takes out of\nit.\"\n\nAs he paused, Oliver's attention, which had wandered off into a vague\nmist of feeling, became suddenly riveted to the appalling spectacle of\nhis uncle's marriage. He saw the house in Bolingbroke Street, with the\nworn drab oilcoth in the hall, and he smelt the smell of stale cooking\nwhich floated through the green lattice door at the back. All the\nsweetness of life, all the beauty, all the decency even, seemed\nstrangled in that smell as if in some malarial air. And in the midst of\nit, the unkempt, slack figure of Belinda, with her bitter eyes and her\nsagging skirt, passed perpetually under the flickering gas-jet up and\ndown the dimly lighted staircase. This was how one marriage had\nended--one marriage among many which had started out with passion and\ncourage and the belief in happiness. Knowing but little of the April\nbrevity of his uncle's mating impulse, he had mentally embroidered the\nbare instinct with some of the idealism in which his own emotion was\nclothed. His imagination pictured Cyrus and Belinda starting as\nlight-hearted adventurers to sail the chartless seas of romance. What\nremained of their gallant ship to-day except a stark and battered hulk\nwrecked on the pitiless rocks of the actuality? A month ago that\nmarriage had seemed merely ridiculous to him. Standing now beside the\nlittle window, where the wan face of evening, languid and fainting\nsweet, looked in from the purple twilight, he was visited by one of\nthose rare flashes of insight which come to men of artistic sensibility\nafter long periods of spiritual warfare. Pity stabbed him as sharply as\nridicule had done a moment before, and with the first sense of human\nkinship he had ever felt to Cyrus, he understood suddenly the tragedy\nthat underlies all comic things. Could there be a deeper pathos, after\nall, than simply being funny? This absurd old man, with his lean,\ncrooked figure, his mottled skin, and his piercing bloodshot eyes, like\nthe eyes of an overgorged bird of prey, appeared now as an object that\nmoved one to tears, not to laughter. And yet because of this very\nquality which made him pitiable--this vulture-like instinct to seize and\ndevour the smaller--he stood to-day the most conspicuously envied figure\nin Dinwiddie.\n\n\"I'm not the kind of man to marry,\" he repeated, but his tone had\nchanged.\n\n\"Well, perhaps you're wise,\" said Cyrus, \"but if you should ever want\nto----\" The confidence which had gone out of Oliver had passed into him.\nWith his strange power of reading human nature--masculine human nature,\nfor the silliest woman could fool him hopelessly--he saw that his nephew\nwas already beginning to struggle against the temptation to yield. And\nhe was wise enough to know that this temptation would become stronger as\nsoon as Oliver felt that the outside pressure was removed. The young\nman's passion was putting forward a subtler argument than Cyrus could\noffer.\n\nWhen his visitor had gone, Oliver turned back to the window, and resting\nhis arms on the sill, leaned out into the velvet softness of the\ntwilight. His wide vision had deserted him. It was as if his gaze had\nnarrowed down to a few roofs and the single street without a\nturning--but beyond them the thought of Virginia lay always like an\nenclosed garden of sweetness and bloom. To think of her was to pass from\nthe scorching heat of the day to the freshness of dew-washed flowers\nunder the starlight.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" he said aloud, and immediately, as if in answer to a\nchallenge, a thousand proofs came to him that other men were doing the\nimpossible every day. How many writers--great writers, too--would have\njumped at a job on a railroad to insure them against starvation? How\nmany had married young and faced the future on less than twelve hundred\ndollars a year? How many had let love lead them where it would without\nbutting their brains forever against the damned wall of expediency?\n\n\"It's impossible,\" he said again, and turning from the window, made\nhimself ready to go out. While he brushed his hair and pulled the end of\nhis necktie through the loop, his gaze wandered back over the roofs to\nwhere a solitary mimosa tree drooped against the lemon-coloured\nafterglow. The dust lay like gauze over the distance. Not a breath\nstirred. Not a leaf fell. Not a figure moved in the town--except the\ncrouching figure of a stray cat that crawled, in search of food, along\nthe brick wall under the dead tree.\n\n\"God! What a life!\" he cried suddenly. And beyond this parching desert\nof the present he saw again that enclosed garden of sweetness and bloom,\nwhich was Virginia. His resolution, weakened by the long hot afternoon,\nseemed to faint under the pressure of his longing. All the burden of the\nday--the heat, the languor, the scorching thirst of the fields, the\nbrazen blue of the sky, the stillness as of a suspended breath which\nwrapt the town--all these things had passed into the intolerableness of\nhis desire. He felt it like a hot wind blowing over him, and it seemed\nto him that he was as helpless as a leaf in the current of this wind\nwhich was sweeping him onward. Something older than his will was driving\nhim; and this something had come to him from out the twilight, where the\nmimosa trees drooped like a veil against the afterglow.\n\nTaking up his hat, he left the room and descended the stairs to the wide\nhall where Tom Peachey sat, gasping for breath, midway of two open\ndoors.\n\n\"I'll be darned if I can make a draught,\" muttered the old soldier\nirascibly, while he picked up his alpaca coat from the balustrade, and\nslipped into it before going out upon the front porch into the possible\npresence of ladies. His usually cheerful face was clouded, for his\nhabitual apathy had deserted him, and he had reached the painful\ndecision that when you looked things squarely in the face there was\nprecious little that was worth living for--a conclusion to which he had\nbeen brought by the simple accident of an overdose of Kentucky rye in\nhis mint julep after church. The overdose had sent him to sleep too soon\nafter his Sunday dinner, and when he had awakened from his heavy and by\nno means quiet slumber, he had found himself confronting a world of\ngloom.\n\n\"I'm damned tired making the best of things, if you want to know what is\nthe matter with me,\" he had remarked crossly to his wife.\n\n\"The idea, Mr. Peachey! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" that\nsprightly lady had responded while she prepared herself for her victory\nover Cyrus.\n\n\"Well, I ain't,\" honest Tom had retorted. \"I've gone on pretending for\nfifty years and I'm going to stop it. What good has it done, anyway? It\nhasn't put a roof on, has it?\"\n\n\"I told you you oughtn't to go to sleep right on top of your dinner,\"\nshe had replied soothingly. \"I declare you're perfectly purple. I never\nsaw you so upset. Here, take this palm-leaf fan and go and see if you\ncan't find a draught. You know it's downright sinful to talk that way\nafter the Lord has been so good to you.\"\n\nBut Philosophy, though she is unassailable when she clings to her\nsafeguard of the universal, meets her match whenever she descends to an\nopen engagement with the particular.\n\n\"W-what's He done for me?\" demanded not Tom, but the whiskey inside of\nhim.\n\nDriven against that bleak rock of fact upon which so many shining\ngeneralizations have come to wreck, Mrs. Peachey had cast about\nhelplessly for some floating spar of logic which might bear her to the\nfirm ground of established optimism. \"I declare, Tom, I believe you are\nout of your head!\" she exclaimed, adding immediately, \"You ought to be\nashamed of yourself to be so ungrateful when the good Lord has kept you\nout of the poorhouse. If you weren't tipsy, I'd give you a hard shaking.\nNow, you take that palm-leaf fan and go right straight downstairs.\"\n\nSo Tom had gone, for his wife, who lacked the gift of argument,\npossessed the energy of character which renders such minor attributes\nunnecessary; and Oliver, passing through the hall a couple of hours\nlater, found him still helplessly seeking the draught towards which she\nhad directed him.\n\n\"Any chance of a breeze springing up?\" inquired the young man as they\nmoved together to the porch.\n\nThe force which was driving him out of the house into the suffocating\nstreets was in his voice when he spoke, but honest Tom did not hear it.\nAfter the four war years in which he had been almost sublime, the old\nsoldier had gradually ceased even to be human, and that vegetable calm\nwhich envelops persons who have fallen into the habit of sitting still,\nhad endowed him at last with the perfect serenity of a cabbage. The only\nactive principle which ever moved in him was the borrowed principle of\nalcohol--for when that artificial energy subsided, he sank back, as he\nwas beginning to do now, into the spiritual inertia which sustains those\nwho have outlived their capacity for the heroic.\n\n\"I ain't felt a breath,\" he replied, peering southward where the stars\nwere coming out in a cloudless sky. \"I don't reckon we'll get it till on\nabout eleven.\"\n\n\"Looks as if we were in for a scorching summer, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"You never can tell. There's always a spell in June.\" And he who had\nbeen a hero, sat down in his cane-bottomed chair and waved the palm-leaf\nfan feebly in front of him. He had had his day; he had fought his fight;\nhe had helped to make the history of battles--and now what remained to\nhim? The stainless memory of the four years when he was a hero; a\nsmoldering ember still left from that flaming glory which was his soul!\n\nIn the street the dust lay thick and still, and the wilted foliage of\nthe mulberry trees hung motionless from the great arching boughs. Only\nan aspen at the corner seemed alive and tremulous, while sensitive\nlittle shivers ran through the silvery leaves, which looked as if they\nwere cut out of velvet. As Oliver left the house, the town awoke slowly\nfrom its lethargy, and the sound of laughter floated to him from the\nporches behind their screens of honeysuckle or roses. But even this\nlaughter seemed to him to contain the burden of weariness which\noppressed and disenchanted his spirit. The pall of melancholy spread\nfrom the winding yellow river at the foot of the hill to the procession\nof cedars which stood pitch-black against the few dim stars on the\neastern horizon.\n\n\"What is the use?\" he asked himself suddenly, uttering aloud that grim\nquestion which lies always beneath the vivid, richly clustering\nimpressions in the imaginative mind. Of his struggle, his sacrifice--of\nhis art even--what was the use? A bitter despondency--the crushing\ndespondency of youth which age does not feel and has forgotten--weighed\nupon him like a physical burden. And because he was young and not\nwithout a certain pride in the intensity of his suffering, he increased\nhis misery by doggedly refusing to trace it back to its natural origin\nin an empty stomach.\n\nBut the laws that govern the variable mind of man are as inscrutable as\nthe secret of light. Turning into a cross street, he came upon the tower\nof Saint James' Church, and he grew suddenly cheerful. The quickening of\nhis pulses changed the aspect of the town as completely as if an\ninvigorating shower had fallen upon it. The supreme, haunting interest\nof life revived.\n\nHe had meant merely to pass the rectory without stopping; but as he\nturned into the slanting street at the foot of the twelve stone steps,\nhe saw a glimmer of white on the terrace, and the face of Virginia\nlooked down at him over the palings of the gate. Immediately it seemed\nto him that he had known from the beginning that he should meet her. A\nsense of recognition so piercingly sweet that it stirred his pulses like\nwine was in his heart as he moved towards her. The whole universe\nappeared to him to have been planned and perfected for this instant. The\nlanguorous June evening, the fainting sweetness of flowers, the strange\nlemon-coloured afterglow, and her face, shining there like a star in the\ntwilight--these had waited for him, he felt, since the beginning of\nearth. That fatalistic reliance upon an outside Power, which assumed for\nhim the radiant guise of first love, and for Susan the stark certainties\nof Presbyterianism, dominated him as completely as if he were the\npredestined vehicle of its expression. Ardent, yet passive, Virginia\nleaned above him on the dim terrace. So still she seemed that her breath\nleft her parted lips as softly as the perfume detached itself from the\nopening rose-leaves. She made no gesture, she said no word--but suddenly\nhe became aware that her stillness was stronger to draw him than any\nspeech. All her woman's mystery was brooding there about her in the June\ntwilight; and in this strange strength of quietness Nature had placed,\nfor once, an invincible weapon in the weaker hands. Her appeal had\nbecome a part of the terrible and beneficent powers of Life.\n\nCrossing the street, he went up the steps to where she leaned on the\ngate.\n\n\"It has been so long,\" he said, and the words seemed to him hideously\nempty. \"I have not seen you but three times since the party.\"\n\nShe did not answer, and as he looked at her closer, he saw that her eyes\nwere full of tears.\n\n\"Virginia!\" he cried out sharply, and the next instant, at her first\nmovement away from him, his arms were around her and his lips seeking\nhers.\n\nThe world stopped suddenly while a starry eternity enveloped them. All\nyouth was packed into that minute, all the troubled sweetness of desire,\nall the fugitive ecstasy of fulfilment.\n\n\"I--I thought you did not care,\" she murmured beneath his kisses.\n\nHe could not speak--for it was a part of his ironic destiny that he, who\nwas prodigal of light words, should find himself stricken dumb in any\ncrucial instant.\n\n\"You know--you know----\" he stammered, holding her closer.\n\n\"Then it--it is not all a dream?\" she asked.\n\n\"I adored you from the first minute--you saw that--you knew it. I've\nwanted you day and night since I first looked at you.\"\n\n\"But you kept away. You avoided me. I couldn't understand.\"\n\n\"It was because I knew I couldn't be with you five minutes without\nkissing you. And I oughtn't to--it's madness in me--for I'm desperately\npoor, darling; I've no right to marry you.\"\n\nA little smile shone on her lips. \"As if I cared about that, Oliver.\"\n\n\"Then you'll marry me? You'll marry me, my beautiful?\"\n\nShe lifted her face from his breast, and her look was like the enkindled\nglory of the sunrise. \"Don't you see? Haven't you seen from the\nbeginning?\" she asked.\n\n\"I was afraid to see, darling--but, Virginia--oh, Virginia, let it be\nsoon!\"\n\nWhen he went from her a little later, it seemed to him that all of life\nhad been pressed down into the minute when he had held her against his\nbreast; and as he walked through the dimly lighted streets, among the\nshadows of men who, like himself, were pursuing some shadowy joy, he\ncarried with him that strange vision of a heaven on earth which has\nhaunted mortal eyes since the beginning of love. Happiness appeared to\nhim as a condition which he had achieved by a few words, by a kiss, in a\nminute of time, but which belonged to him so entirely now that he could\nnever be defrauded of it again in the future. Whatever happened to him,\nhe could never be separated from the bliss of that instant when he had\nheld her.\n\nHe was going to Cyrus while his ecstasy ennobled even the prosaic fact\nof the railroad. And just as on that other evening, when he had rushed\nin anger away from the house of his uncle, so now he was exalted by the\nconsciousness that he was following the lead of the more spiritual part\nof his nature--for the line of least resistance was so overgrown with\nexquisite impressions that he no longer recognized it. The sacrifice of\nart for love appeared to him to-day as splendidly romantic as the\nsacrifice of comfort for art had seemed to him a few months ago. His\ndesire controlled him so absolutely that he obeyed its different\npromptings under the belief that he was obeying the principles whose\nnames he borrowed. The thing he wanted was transmuted by the fire of his\ntemperament into some artificial likeness to the thing that was good for\nhim.\n\nOn the front steps, between the two pink oleanders, Cyrus was standing\nwith his gaze fixed on a small grocery store across the street, and at\nthe sight of his nephew a look of curiosity, which was as personal an\nemotion as he was in the habit of feeling, appeared on his lean yellow\nface. Behind him, the door into the hall stood open, and his stooping\nfigure was outlined against the light of the gas-jet by the staircase.\n\n\"You see I've come,\" said Oliver; for Cyrus, who never spoke first\nunless he was sure of dominating the situation, had waited for him to\nbegin.\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" replied the old man, not unkindly. \"I expected you, but\nhardly so soon--hardly so soon.\"\n\n\"It's about the place on the railroad. If you are still of the same\nmind, I'd like you to give me a trial.\"\n\n\"When would you want to start?\"\n\n\"The sooner the better. I'd rather get settled there before the autumn.\nI'm going to be married sometime in the autumn--October, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Cyrus softly, and Oliver was grateful to him because he\ndidn't attempt to crow.\n\n\"We haven't told any one yet--but I wanted to make sure of the job. It's\nall right, then, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it's all right, if you do your part. She's Gabriel Pendleton's\ngirl, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She's Virginia Pendleton. You know her, of course.\" He tried honestly\nto be natural, but in spite of himself he could not keep a note of\nconstraint out of his voice. Merely to discuss Virginia with Cyrus\nseemed, in some subtle way, an affront to her. Yet he knew that the old\nman wanted to be kind, and the knowledge touched him.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know her. She's a good girl, and there doesn't live a better\nman than Gabriel.\"\n\n\"I don't deserve her, of course. But, then, there never lived a man who\ndeserved an angel.\"\n\n\"Ain't you coming in?\" asked Cyrus.\n\n\"Not this evening. I only wanted to speak to you. I suppose I'd better\ngo down to the office to-morrow and talk to Mr. Burden, hadn't I?\"\n\n\"Come about noon, and I'll tell him to expect you. Well, if you ain't\ncoming in, I reckon I'll close this door.\"\n\nLooking up a minute later from the pavement Oliver saw his aunt rocking\nslowly back and forth at the window of her room, and the remembrance of\nher fell like a blight over his happiness.\n\nBy the time he reached High Street a wind had risen beyond the hill near\nthe river, and the scattered papers on the pavement fled like grey wings\nbefore him into the darkness. As the air freshened, faces appeared in\nthe doors along the way, and the whole town seemed drinking in the\ncooling breeze as if it were water. On the wind sped, blowing over the\nslack figure of Mrs. Treadwell; blowing over the conquering smile of\nSusan, who was unbinding her long hair; blowing over the joy-brightened\neyes of Virginia, who dreamed in the starlight of the life that would\ncome to her; blowing over the ghost-haunted face of her mother, who\ndreamed of the life that had gone by her; blowing at last, beyond the\nriver, over the tired hands of the little seamstress, who dreamed of\nnothing except of how she might keep her living body out of the\npoorhouse and her dead body out of the potter's field. And over the\ntown, with its twenty-one thousand souls, each of whom contained within\nitself a separate universe of tragedy and of joy, of hope and of\ndisappointment, the wind passed as lightly it passed over the unquiet\ndust in the streets below.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nTHE REALITY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nVIRGINIA PREPARES FOR THE FUTURE\n\n\n\"Mother, I'm so happy! Oh! was there ever a girl so happy as I am?\"\n\n\"I was, dear, once.\"\n\n\"When you married father? Yes, I know,\" said Virginia, but she said it\nwithout conviction. In her heart she did not believe that marrying her\nfather--perfect old darling that he was!--could ever have caused any\ngirl just the particular kind of ecstasy that she was feeling. She even\ndoubted whether such stainless happiness had ever before visited a\nmortal upon this planet. It was not only wonderful, it was not only\nperfect, but it felt so absolutely new that she secretly cherished the\nbelief that it had been invented by the universe especially for Oliver\nand herself. It was ridiculous to imagine that the many million pairs of\nlovers that were marrying every instant had each experienced a miracle\nlike this, and yet left the earth pretty much as they had found it\nbefore they fell in love.\n\nIt was a week before her wedding, and she stood in the centre of the\nspare room in the west wing, which had been turned over to Miss Willy\nWhitlow. The little seamstress knelt now at her feet, pinning up the hem\nof a black silk polonaise, and turning her head from time to time to ask\nMrs. Pendleton if she was \"getting the proper length.\" For a quarter of\na century, no girl of Virginia's class had married in Dinwiddie without\nthe crowning benediction of a black silk gown, and ever since the\nannouncement of Virginia's betrothal her mother had cramped her small\neconomies in order that she might buy \"grosgrain\" of the best quality.\n\n\"Is that right, mother? Do you think I might curve it a little more in\nfront?\" asked the girl, holding her feet still with difficulty because\nshe felt that she wanted to dance.\n\n\"No, dear, I think it will stay in fashion longer if you don't shorten\nit. Then it will be easier to make over the more goods you leave in it.\"\n\n\"It looks nice on me, doesn't it?\" Standing there, with the stiff silk\nslipping away from her thin shoulders, and the dappled sunlight falling\nover her neck and arms through the tawny leaves of the paulownia tree in\nthe garden, she was like a slim white lily unfolding softly out of its\nsheath.\n\n\"Lovely, darling, and it will be so useful. I got the very best quality,\nand it ought to wear forever.\"\n\n\"I made Mrs. William Goode one ten years ago, and she's still wearing\nit,\" remarked Miss Willy, speaking with an effort through a mouthful of\npins.\n\nA machine, which had been whirring briskly by the side window, stopped\nsuddenly, and the girl who sewed there--a sickly, sallow-faced creature\nof Virginia's age, who was hired by Mrs. Pendleton, partly out of\ncharity because she supported an invalid father who had been crippled in\nthe war, and partly because, having little strength and being an\nunskilled worker, her price was cheap--turned for an instant and stared\nwistfully at the black silk polonaise over the strip of organdie which\nshe was hemming. All her life she had wanted a black silk dress, and\nthough she knew that she should probably never have one, and should not\nhave time to wear it if she ever had, she liked to linger over the\nthought of it, very much as Virginia lingered over the thought of her\nlover, or as little Miss Willy lingered over the thought of having a\ntombstone over her after she was dead. In the girl's face, where at\nfirst there had been only admiration, a change came gradually. A quiver,\nso faint that it was hardly more than a shadow, passed over her drawn\nfeatures, and her gaze left the trailing yards of silk and wandered to\nthe blue October sky over the swinging leaves of the paulownia. But\ninstead of the radiant autumn weather at which she was looking, she\nstill saw that black silk polonaise which she wanted as she wanted youth\nand pleasure, and which she knew that she should never have.\n\n\"Everything is finished but this, isn't it, Miss Willy?\" asked Virginia,\nand at the sound of her happy voice, that strange quiver passed again\nthrough the other girl's face.\n\n\"Everything except that organdie and a couple of nightgowns.\" There was\nno quiver in Miss Willy's face, for from constant consideration of the\npoorhouse and the cemetery, she had come to regard the other problems of\nlife, if not with indifference, at least with something approaching a\nmild contempt. Even love, when measured by poverty or by death, seemed\nto lose the impressiveness of its proportions.\n\n\"And I'll have enough clothes to last me for years, shan't I, mother?\"\n\n\"I hope so, darling. Your father and I have done the best that we could\nfor you.\"\n\n\"You've been angels. Oh, how I shall hate to leave you!\"\n\n\"If only you weren't going away, Jinny!\" Then she broke down, and\ndropping the tomato-shaped pin-cushion she had been holding, she slipped\nfrom the room, while Virginia thrust the polonaise into Miss Willy's\nhands and fled breathlessly after her.\n\nIn the girl's room, with her head bowed on the top of the little\nbookcase, above those thin rows of fiction, Mrs. Pendleton was weeping\nalmost wildly over the coming separation. She, who had not thought of\nherself for thirty years, had suddenly broken the constraint of the long\nhabit. Yet it was characteristic of her, that even now her first\nfeeling, when Virginia found her, should be one of shame that she had\nclouded for an instant the girl's happiness.\n\n\"It is nothing, darling. I have a little headache, and--oh, Jinny!\nJinny!----\"\n\n\"Mother, it won't be long. We are coming back to live just as soon as\nOliver can get work. It isn't as if I were going for good, is it? And\nI'll write you every day--every single day. Mother, dearest, darling\nmother, I can't stay away from you----\"\n\nThen Virginia wept, too, and Mrs. Pendleton, forgetting her own sorrow\nat sight of the girl's tears, began to comfort her.\n\n\"Of course, you'll write and tell me everything. It will be almost as if\nI were with you.\"\n\n\"And you love Oliver, don't you, mother?\"\n\n\"How could I help it, dear--only I can't quite get used to your calling\nyour husband by his name, Jinny. It would have horrified your\ngrandmother, and somehow it does seem lacking in respect. However, I\nsuppose I'm old-fashioned.\"\n\n\"But, mother, he laughs if I call him 'Mr. Treadwell.' He says it\nreminds him of his Aunt Belinda.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's right, darling. Anyway, he prefers it, and I fancy your\ngrandfather wouldn't have liked to hear his wife address him so\nfamiliarly. Times have changed since my girlhood.\"\n\n\"And Oliver has lived out in the world so much, mother.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pendleton, but her voice was without enthusiasm. The\n\"world\" to her was a vague and sinister shape, which looked like a\nbubble, and exerted a malignant influence over those persons who lived\nbeyond the borders of Virginia. Her imagination, which seldom wandered\nfarther afield than the possibility of the rector or of Virginia falling\nill, or the dreaded likelihood that her market bills would overrun her\nweekly allowance, was incapable of grasping a set of standards other\nthan the one which was accepted in Dinwiddie.\n\n\"Wherever you are, Jinny, I hope that you will never forget the ideas\nyour father and I have tried to implant in you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll always try to be worthy of you, mother.\"\n\n\"Your first duty now, of course, is to your husband. Remember, we have\nalways taught you that a woman's strength lies in her gentleness. His\nwill must be yours now, and wherever your ideas cross, it is your duty\nto give up, darling. It is the woman's part to sacrifice herself.\"\n\n\"I know, mother, I know.\"\n\n\"I have never forgotten this, dear, and my marriage has been very happy.\nOf course,\" she added, while her forehead wrinkled nervously, \"there are\nnot many men like your father.\"\n\n\"Of course not, mother, but Oliver----\"\n\nIn Mrs. Pendleton's soft, anxious eyes the shadow darkened, as if for\nthe first time she had grown suspicious of the traditional wisdom which\nshe was imparting. But this suspicion was so new and young that it could\nnot struggle for existence against the archaic roots of her inherited\nbelief in the Pauline measure of her sex. It was characteristic of\nher--and indeed of most women of her generation--that she would have\nendured martyrdom in support of the consecrated doctrine of her\ninferiority to man.\n\n\"Even in the matter of religion you ought to yield to him, darling,\" she\nsaid after a moment in which she had appealed to that orthodox arbiter,\nher conscience. \"Your father and I were talking about what church you\nshould go to, and I said that I supposed Oliver was a Presbyterian, like\nall of the Treadwells.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, I didn't tell you before because I hoped I could change\nhim--but he doesn't go to any church--he says they all bore him equally.\nHe has broken away from all the old ideas, you know. He is\ndreadfully--unsettled.\"\n\nThe anxiety, which had been until then merely a shadow in Mrs.\nPendleton's eyes, deepened into a positive pain.\n\n\"Your father must have known, for he talked to him--but he wouldn't tell\nme,\" she said.\n\n\"I made father promise not to. I hoped so I could change Oliver, and\nmaybe I can after we're married, mother.\"\n\n\"If he has given up the old spiritual standards, what has he in place of\nthem?\" asked Mrs. Pendleton, and she had suddenly a queer feeling as if\nlittle fine needles were pricking her skin.\n\n\"I don't know, but he seems to have a great deal, more than any of us,\"\nanswered Virginia, and she added passionately, \"He is good, mother.\"\n\n\"I never doubted it, darling, but he is young, and his character cannot\nbe entirely formed at his age. A man must be very strong in order to be\ngood without faith.\"\n\n\"But he has faith, mother--of some kind.\"\n\n\"I am not judging him, my child, and neither your father nor I would\never criticise your husband to you. Your happiness was set on him, and\nwe can only pray from our hearts that he will prove worthy of your love.\nHe is very lovable, and I am sure that he has fine, generous traits.\nYour father has been completely won over by him.\"\n\n\"He likes me to be religious, mother. He says the church has cultivated\nthe loveliest type of woman the world has ever seen.\"\n\n\"Then by fulfilling that ideal you will please him best.\"\n\n\"I shall try to be just what you have been to father--just as unselfish,\njust as devoted.\"\n\n\"I have made many mistakes, Jinny, but I don't think I have ever failed\nin love--not in love, at least.\"\n\nThen the pain passed out of her eyes, and because it was impossible for\nher to look on any fact in life except through the transfiguring\nidealism with which the ages had endowed her, she became immediately\nconvinced that everything, even the unsettling of Oliver's opinions, had\nbeen arranged for the best. This assurance was the more solacing because\nit was the result, not of external evidence, but of that instinctive\ndecision of temperament which breeds the deepest conviction of all.\n\n\"Love is the only thing that really matters, isn't it, mother?\"\n\n\"A pure and noble love, darling. It is a woman's life. God meant it so.\"\n\n\"You are so good! If I can only be half as good as you are.\"\n\n\"No, Jinny, I'm not really good. I have had many temptations--for I was\nborn with a high temper, and it has taken me a lifetime to learn really\nto subdue it. I had--I have still an unfortunate pride. But for your\nfather's daily example of humility and patience, I don't know how I\ncould have supported the trials and afflictions we have known. Pray to\nbe better than your mother, my child, if you want to become a perfect\nwife. What I am that seems good to you, your father has made me----\"\n\n\"And father says that he would have been a savage but for you.\"\n\nA tremor passed through Mrs. Pendleton's thin bosom, and bending over,\nshe smoothed a fine darn in the skirt of her alpaca dress.\n\n\"We have loved each other,\" she answered. \"If you and Oliver love as\nmuch, you will be happy whatever comes to you.\" Then choking down the\nhard lump in her throat, she took up her leather key basket from the\nlittle table beside the bed, and moved slowly towards the door. \"I must\nsee about supper now, dear,\" she said in her usual voice of quiet\ncheerfulness.\n\nLeft to herself, Virginia opened the worn copy of the prayer-book, which\nshe kept at her bedside, and read the marriage service from beginning to\nend, as she had done every day since her engagement to Oliver. The words\nseemed to her, as they seemed to her mother, to be almost divine in\ntheir nobility and beauty. She was troubled by no doubt as to the\ninspired propriety of the canonical vision of woman. What could be more\nbeautiful or more sacred than to be \"given\" to Oliver--to belong to him\nas utterly as she had belonged to her father? What could make her\nhappier than the knowledge that she must surrender her will to his from\nthe day of her wedding until the day of her death? She embraced her\ncircumscribed lot with a passion which glorified its limitations. The\nsingle gift which the ages permitted her was the only one she desired.\nHer soul craved no adventure beyond the permissible adventure of being\nsought in marriage. Love was all that she asked of a universe that was\noverflowing with manifold aspects of life.\n\nBeyond the window the tawny leaves of the paulownia were swinging in the\nOctober sunshine, and so gay they seemed that it was impossible to\nimagine them insensible to the splendour of the Indian Summer. Under the\nhalf bared boughs, on the green grass in the yard, those that had\nalready fallen sped on, like a flock of frightened brown birds, towards\nthe white paling fence of the churchyard.\n\nWhile she sat there, with her prayer-book in her hand, and her eyes on\nthe purple veil of the distance, it seemed to her that her joy was so\ncomplete that there was nothing left even to hope for. All her life she\nhad looked forward to the coming of what she thought of vaguely as\n\"happiness,\" and now that it was here, she felt that it put an end to\nthe tremulous expectancy which had filled her girlhood with such wistful\ndreams. Marriage appeared to her (and indeed to Oliver, also) as a\nmiraculous event, which would make not only herself, but every side of\nlife, different for the future. After that there would be no vain\nlongings, no spring restlessness, no hours of drab weariness, when the\ninterests of living seemed to crumble from mere despondency. After that\nthey would be always happy, always eager, always buoyantly alive.\n\nLeaving the marriage service, her thoughts brooded in a radiant\nstillness on the life of love which would begin for her on the day of\nher wedding. A strange light--the light that quivered like a golden wing\nover the autumn fields--shone, also, into the secret chambers of her\nsoul, and illumined the things which had appeared merely dull and\ncommonplace until to-day. Those innumerable little cares which fill the\nlives of most women were steeped in the magic glow of this miraculous\ncharm. She thought of the daily excitement of marketing, of the\nperpetual romance of mending his clothes, of the glorified monotony of\npouring his coffee, as an adventurer on sunrise seas might dream of the\nrosy islands of hidden treasure. And then, so perfectly did she conform\nin spirit to the classic ideal of her sex, her imagination ecstatically\npictured her in the immemorial attitude of woman. She saw herself\nwaiting--waiting happily--but always waiting. She imagined the thrilling\nexpectancy of the morning waiting for him to come home to his dinner;\nthe hushed expectancy of the evening waiting for him to come home to his\nsupper; the blissful expectancy of hoping that he might be early; the\npainful expectancy of fearing that he might be late. And it seemed to\nher divinely right and beautiful that, while he should have a hundred\nother absorbing interests in his life, her whole existence should\nperpetually circle around this single centre of thought. One by one, she\nlived in anticipation all the exquisite details of their life together,\nand in imagining them, she overlooked all possible changes that the\nyears might bring, as entirely as she ignored the subtle variations of\ntemperament which produce in each individual that fluid quantity we call\ncharacter. She thought of Oliver, as she thought of herself, as though\nthe fact of marriage would crystallize him into a shape from which he\nwould never alter or dissolve in the future. And with a reticence\npeculiar to her type, she never once permitted her mind to stray to her\ncrowning beatitude--the hope of a child; for, with that sacred\ninconsistency possible only to fixed beliefs, though motherhood was\nsupposed to comprise every desire, adventure, and activity in the life\nof woman, it was considered indelicate for her to dwell upon the thought\nof it until the condition had become too obvious for refinement to deny.\n\nThe shadow of the church tower lengthened on the grass, and at the end\nof the cross street she saw Susan appear and stop for a minute to speak\nto Miss Priscilla, who was driving by in a small wagonette. Then the\ngirl and the teacher parted, and ten minutes later there came Susan's\nimperative knock at Virginia's door.\n\n\"Miss Willy told mother that your wedding dress was finished, Jinny, and\nI am dying to see it!\"\n\nGoing to the closet, which was built into one corner of the wall,\nVirginia unpinned a long white sheet scented with rose-leaves, and\nbrought out a filmy mass of satin and lace. Her face as she looked down\nupon it was the face of girlhood incarnate. All her virginal dreams\nclustered there like doves quivering for flight. Its beauty was the\nbeauty of fleeting things--of the wind in the apple blossoms at dawn, of\nthe music of bees on an August afternoon.\n\n\"Mother wouldn't let me be married in anything but satin,\" she said,\nwith a catch in her voice. \"I believe it is the first time in her life\nshe was ever extravagant, but she felt so strongly about it that I had\nto give in and not have white muslin as I wanted to do.\"\n\n\"And it's so lovely,\" said Susan. \"I had no idea Miss Willy could do it.\nShe's as proud, too, as if it were her own.\"\n\n\"She took a pleasure in every stitch, she told me. Oh, Susan, I\nsometimes feel that I haven't any right to be so happy. I seem to have\neverything and other women to have nothing.\"\n\nFor the first time Susan smiled, but it was a smile of understanding.\n\"Perhaps they have more than you think, darling.\"\n\n\"But there's Miss Willy--what has she ever got out of life?\"\n\n\"Well, I really believe she gets a kind of happiness out of saving up\nthe money to pay for her tombstone. It's a funny thing, but the people\nwho ought to be unhappy, somehow never are. It doesn't seem to be a\nmatter of what you have, but of the way you are born. Now, according to\nus, Miss Willy ought to be miserable, but the truth is that she isn't a\nbit so. Mother saw her once skipping for pure joy in the spring.\"\n\n\"But people who haven't things can't be as grateful to God as those who\nhave. I feel that I'd like to spend every minute of my life on my knees\nthanking Him. I don't see how I can ever have a disappointed or a\nselfish thought again. I wonder if you can understand, you precious\nSusan, but I want to open my arms and take the whole world into them.\"\n\n\"Jinny,\" said Susan suddenly, \"don't spoil Oliver.\"\n\n\"I couldn't--not if I tried every minute.\"\n\n\"I don't know, dear. He is very lovable, he has fine generous traits, he\nhas the making of a big man in him--but his character isn't formed yet,\nyou must remember. So much of him is imagination that he will take\nlonger than most men to grow up to his stature.\"\n\n\"Oh, Susan!\" exclaimed Virginia, and turned away.\n\n\"Perhaps I oughtn't to have said it, Jinny--but, no, I ought to tell you\njust what I think, and I don't regret it.\"\n\n\"Mother said the same thing to me,\" responded Virginia, looking as if\nshe were on the point of tears; \"but that is just because neither of you\nknow him as I do.\"\n\n\"He is a Treadwell and so am I, and the chief characteristic of every\nTreadwell is that he is going to get the thing he wants most. It doesn't\nmake any difference whether it is money or love or fame, the thing he\nwants most he will get sooner or later. So all I mean is that you\nneedn't spoil Oliver by giving him the universe before he wants it.\"\n\n\"I can't give him the universe. I can only give him myself.\"\n\nStooping over, Susan kissed her.\n\n\"Happy, happy little Jinny!\"\n\n\"There are only two things that trouble me, dear--one is going away from\nmother and father, and the other is that you are not so happy as I am.\"\n\n\"Some day I may get the thing I want like every other Treadwell.\"\n\n\"Do you mean going to college?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan, \"I don't mean that,\" and into her calm grey eyes a new\nlight shone for an instant.\n\nA clairvoyance, deeper than knowledge, came to Virginia while she looked\nat her.\n\n\"You darling!\" she exclaimed. \"I never suspected!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to suspect, Jinny. I was only joking.\"\n\n\"Why, it never crossed my mind that you would think of him for a\nminute.\"\n\n\"He hasn't thought of me for a minute yet.\"\n\n\"The idea! He'd be wild about you in ten seconds if he ever thought----\"\n\n\"He was wild about you ten seconds ago, dear.\"\n\n\"He never was. It was just his fancy. Why, you are made for each other.\"\n\nA laugh broke from Susan, but with that large and quiet candour which\nwas characteristic of her, she did not seek to evade or deny Virginia's\nsuspicion. That her friend should discover her feeling for John Henry\nseemed to her as natural as that she should be conscious of it\nherself--for they were intimate with that full and perfect intimacy\nwhich exists only between two women who trust each other.\n\n\"There goes Miss Willy,\" said Susan, looking through the window to where\nthe little dressmaker tripped down the stone steps to the street.\n\"Mother wants to have early supper, so I must be running away.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, darling. Oh, Susan, I never loved you as I do now. It will be\nall right--I trust and pray that it will! And, just think, you will walk\nout of church together at my wedding!\"\n\nFor a minute, standing on the threshold, Susan looked back at her with\nan expression of tender amusement in her eyes. \"Don't imagine that I'm\nunhappy, dear,\" she said, \"because I'm not--it isn't that kind--and,\nafter all, even an unrequited affection may be simply an added interest\nin life, if we choose to take it that way.\"\n\nWhen she had gone, Virginia lingered over her wedding dress, while she\nwondered what the wise Susan could see in the simple John Henry? Was it\npossible that John Henry was not so simple, after all? Or did Susan,\nforsaking the ancient tradition of love, care about him merely because\nhe was good?\n\nFor a week the hours flew by with golden wings, and at last the most\nsacred day of her life dawned softly in a sunrise of rose and flame.\nWhen she looked back on it afterwards, there were three things which\nstood out unforgettably in her memory--the kiss that her mother gave her\nwhen she turned to leave her girlhood's room for the last time; the\nsound of her father's voice as he spoke her name at the altar; and the\nlook in Oliver's eyes when she put her hand into his. All the rest was\nenveloped in a shining mist which floated, like her wedding veil,\nbetween the old life and the new.\n\n\"It has been so perfect--so perfect--if I can only be worthy of this day\nand of you, Oliver,\" she said as the carriage started from the rectory\ngate to the station.\n\n\"You angel!\" he murmured ecstatically.\n\nHer eyes hung blissfully on his face for an instant, and then, moved by\na sudden stab of reproach, she leaned from the window and looked back at\nher mother and father, who stood, with clasped hands, gazing after her\nover the white palings of the gate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nVIRGINIA'S LETTERS\n\n\n    MATOACA CITY, West Virginia, October 16, 1884.\n    DEAREST, DEAREST MOTHER:\n\nWe got here this morning after a dreadful trip--nine or ten hours\nlate--and this is the first minute I've had when I could sit down and\nwrite to you. All the way on the train I was thinking of you and dear\nfather, and longing for you so that I could hardly keep back the tears.\nI don't see how I can possibly stay away from you for a whole year.\nOliver says he wants to take me home for Christmas if everything goes\nall right with us here and his work proves satisfactory to the manager.\nOh, mother, he is the loveliest thing to me! I don't believe he has\nthought of himself a single minute since I married him. He says the only\nwish he has on earth is to make me happy--and he is so careful about me\nthat I'm afraid I'll be spoiled to death before you see me again. He\nsays he loves the little grey dress of shot silk, with the bonnet that\nmakes me look like a Quaker. I wish now I'd got my other hat the bonnet\nshape as you wanted me to do--but perhaps, after all, it will be more\nuseful and keep in fashion longer as it is. When I took out my clothes\nthis morning, while Oliver was downstairs, and remembered how you had\nfolded and packed everything, I just sat down on the floor in the midst\nof them and had a good cry. I never realized how much I loved you until\nI got into the carriage to come away. Then I wanted to jump out and put\nmy arms around you and tell you that you are the best and dearest mother\na girl ever had. My things were so beautifully packed that there wasn't\na single crease anywhere--not even in the black silk polonaise that we\nwere so afraid would get rumpled. I don't see how on earth you folded\nthem so smoothly. By the way, I hardly think I shall have any need of my\nwedding dress while I am here, so you may as well put it away at home\nuntil I come back. This place seems to be just a mining town, with very\nfew people of our class, and those all connected with the railroad. Of\ncourse, I may be mistaken, but from my first impressions I doubt if I'll\never want to have much to do with anybody that I've seen. It doesn't\nmake a bit of difference, of course, because I shan't be lonesome a\nminute with the house to look after and Oliver's clothes to attend to;\nand, besides, I don't think a married woman ought to make many new\nfriends. Her husband ought to be enough for her. Mrs. Payson, the\nmanager's wife, was here to welcome me, but I hope I shan't see very\nmuch of her, because she isn't just exactly what I should call ladylike.\nOf course I wouldn't breathe this to any other living soul, but I\nthought her entirely too free and easy in her manner, and she dresses in\nsuch very bright colours. Why, she had a red feather in her hat, and she\nmust have been married at least fifteen years. Oliver says he doesn't\nbelieve she's a day under forty-five. He says he likes her well enough\nand thinks she's a good sort, but he is awfully glad that I'm not that\nkind of woman. I feel sorry for her husband, for I'm sure no man wants\nhis wife to make herself conspicuous, and they say she even makes\nspeeches when she is in the North. Maybe she isn't to blame, because she\nwas brought up that way, but I am going to see just as little of her as\nI can.\n\nAnd now I must tell you about our house, for I know you are dying to\nhear how we are fixed. It's the tiniest one you ever imagined, with a\nfront yard the size of a pocket handkerchief, and it is painted the most\nperfectly hideous shade of yellow--the shade father always calls\nbilious. I can't understand why they made it so ugly, but, then, the\nwhole town is just as ugly as our house is. The people here don't seem\nto have the least bit of taste. All the porches have dreadful brown\nornaments along the top of them, and they look exactly as if they were\nmade out of gingerbread. There are very few gardens, and nobody takes\nany care of these. I suppose one reason is that it is almost impossible\nto get servants for love or money. There are hardly any darkies here,\nthey say, and the few they have are perfectly worthless. Mrs.\nMidden--the woman who opened my house for me--hasn't been able to get me\na cook, and we'll either have to take our meals at a boarding-house\nacross the street, or I shall have to put to practise the lessons you\ngave me. I am so glad you made me learn how to housekeep and to cook,\nbecause I am certain that I shall have greater need of both of these\naccomplishments than of either drawing or music. Oliver was simply\nhorrified when I told him so. He said he'd rather starve than see me in\nthe kitchen, and he urged me to get you to send us a servant from\nDinwiddie--but things are so terribly costly here--you never dreamed of\nsuch prices--that I really don't believe we can afford to have one come.\nThen, Mrs. Midden says that they get ruined just as soon as they are\nbrought here. Everybody tries it at first, she told me, and it has\nalways proved a disappointment in the end. I am perfectly sure that I\nshan't mind cooking at all--and as for cleaning up this little\nhouse--why, it won't take me an hour--but Oliver almost weeps every time\nI mention it. He is afraid every instant he is away from me that I am\nlonesome or something has happened to me, and whenever he has ten\nminutes free he runs up here to see what I am doing. Do you know he has\nmade me promise not to go out by myself until I am used to the place.\nIsn't that too absurd?\n\nDearest mother, I must stop now, and write some notes of thanks for my\npresents. The barrels of china haven't come yet, but the silver box got\nhere almost as soon as we did. Freight takes a long time, Oliver says.\nIt will be such fun unpacking all my presents and putting them away on\nthe shelves. I was so excited those last few days that I hardly paid any\nattention to the things that came. Now I shall have time really to enjoy\nthem, and to realize how sweet and lovely everybody has been to me.\nWasn't it too dear of Miss Priscilla to give me that beautiful tea-set?\nAnd I was so touched by poor little Miss Willy spending her hard-earned\nmoney on that vase. I wish she hadn't. It makes me feel badly to think\nof it--but I don't see what I could do about it, do you? I think I'll\ntry to send her a cloak or something at Christmas.\n\nI haven't said half that I want to--but I shall keep the rest for\nto-morrow.\n\n    With a dozen kisses and my dearest love to father,\n    Your ever, ever loving and grateful daughter,\n    VIRGINIA\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. December 25, 1884.\n    DEAREST MOTHER:\n\nIt almost broke my heart not to be able to go home for Christmas. It\ndoesn't seem like Christmas at all away from you--though, of course, I\ntry not to let Oliver see how I mind it. He has so much to bother him,\npoor dear, that I keep all of my worries, big and little, in the\nbackground. When anything goes wrong in the house I never tell him,\nbecause he has so many important things on his mind that I don't think I\nought to trouble him about small ones. We have given up going to the\nboarding-house for our meals, because neither of us could eat a morsel\nof the food they had there--did you ever hear of such a thing as having\npie and preserves for breakfast?--and Oliver says it used to make him\nsick to see me in the midst of all of those people. They came from all\nover the country, and hardly anybody could speak a grammatical sentence.\nThe man who sat next to me always said \"he don't\" and \"I ain't feeling\ngood to-day\" and once even \"I done it\"--can you imagine such a thing?\nEvery other word was \"guess,\" and yet they had the impertinence to laugh\nat me when I said \"reckon,\" which, I am sure father told me was\nShakespearian English. Well, we stood it as long as we could, and then\nwe started having our meals here, and it is so much nicer. Oliver says\nthe change from the boarding-house has given him a splendid appetite,\nand he enjoys everything that I make so much--particularly the waffles\nby Aunt Ailsey's recipe. Be sure to tell her. At first I had a servant,\nbut she was so dreadful that I let her go at the end of the month, and I\nreally get on ever so much better without her. She hadn't the faintest\nidea how to cook, and had never made a piece of light bread in her life.\nBesides, she was too untidy for anything, and actually swept the trash\nunder the bed except once a week when she pretended to give a thorough\ncleaning. The first time she changed the sheets, I found that she had\nsimply put on one fresh one, and was going to use the bottom one on top.\nShe said she'd never heard of doing it any other way, and I had to laugh\nwhen I thought of how your face would have looked if you could have\nheard her. It really is the greatest relief to get rid of her, and I'd a\nhundred times rather do the work myself than have another of that kind.\nAt first Oliver hated dreadfully to have me do everything about the\nhouse, but he is beginning to get used to it now, because, of course, I\nnever let him see if anything happens to worry me or if I am tired when\nhe comes home. It takes every minute of my time, but, then, there is\nnothing else here that I care to do, and I never leave the house except\nto take a little walk with Oliver on Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Midden says\nthat I make a mistake to give a spring cleaning every day, but I love to\nkeep the house looking perfectly spick and span, and I make hot bread\ntwice a day, because Oliver is so fond of it. He is just as sweet and\ndear as he can be and wants to help about everything, but I hate to see\nhim doing housework. Somehow it doesn't seem to me to look manly. We\nhave had our first quarrel about who is to get up and make the fires in\nthe morning. Oliver insisted that he was to do it, but I wake so much\nearlier than he does, because I've got the bread on my mind, that I\nalmost always have the wood burning before he gets up. The first few\ntimes he was really angry about it, and he didn't seem to understand why\nI hated so to wake him. He says he hates still worse to see my hands get\nrough--but I am so thankful that I am not one of those girls (like Abby\nGoode) who are forever thinking of how they look. But Oliver made such a\nfuss about the fires that I didn't tell him that I went down to the\ncellar one morning and brought up a basket of coal. The boy didn't come\nthe day before, so there wasn't any to start the kitchen fire with, and\nI knew that by the time Oliver got up and dressed it would be too late\nto have hot rolls for breakfast. By the way, could you have a bushel of\ncornmeal sent to me from Dinwiddie? The kind they have here isn't the\nleast bit like the water-ground sort we have at home, and most of it is\nyellow. Nobody ever has batterbread here. All the food is different from\nours. I suppose that is because most of the people are from the North\nand West.\n\nI have the table all set for our Christmas dinner, and in a few minutes\nI must put the turkey into the oven. I was so glad to get the plum\npudding in the Christmas box, because I could never have made one half\nso good as yours, and the fruit cake will last me forever--it is so big.\nI wrote you about the box yesterday just as soon as it came, but after I\nhad sent my letter, I went back to it and found that rose point scarf of\ngrandmother's wrapped in tissue paper in the bottom. Darling mother, it\nmade me cry. You oughtn't to have given it to me. It always looked so\nlovely on your black silk, and it was almost the last thing you had\nleft. I don't believe I shall ever make up my mind to wear it. I have on\nmy little grey silk to-day, and it looks so nice. You must tell Miss\nWilly that it has been very much admired. Mrs. Payson asked me if it was\nmade in Dinwiddie, and, you know, she gets all of her clothes from New\nYork. That must have been why I thought her over-dressed when I first\nsaw her. By the way, I've almost changed my mind about her since I wrote\nyou what I thought of her. I believe now that the whole trouble with her\nis simply that she isn't a Southern lady. She means well, I am sure, but\nshe isn't what I should call exactly refined. There's something \"horsey\"\nabout her--I can't think of any other way to express it--something that\nreminds me just a little bit of Abby--and, you remember, we always said\nAbby got that from being educated in the North. Tell dearest Susan I\nreally think it is fortunate that she did not go to one of their\ncolleges. Mrs. Payson is a college woman and it seems to me that she is\nalways trying to appear as clever as a man. She talks in a way sometimes\nthat sounds as if she believed in woman's rights and all that sort of\nthing. I told Oliver about it, and he laughed and said that men hated\ntalk like that. He says all a man admires in a woman is her power of\nloving, and that when she begins to ape a man she loses her charm for\nhim. I can't understand why Mr. Payson married his wife. He said such\nnice things to me the other day about my being so domestic and such a\nhome lover, that I really felt sorry for him. When I told him that I\nwas so fond of staying indoors that I would never cross my threshold if\nOliver didn't make me, he laughed and said that he wished I'd convert\nhis wife to my way of thinking. Yet he seems to have the greatest\nadmiration for her, and, do you know, I believe he even admires that red\nfeather, though he doesn't approve of it. He never turns his eyes away\nfrom her when they are together, which isn't very much, as she goes\nabout just as she pleases without him. Can you understand how a person\ncan both admire and disapprove of a thing? Oliver says he knows how it\nis, but I must say that I don't. I hope and pray that our marriage will\nalways be different from theirs. Oliver and I are never apart for a\nsingle minute except when he is at work in the office. He hasn't written\na line since we came here, but he is going to begin as soon as we get\nsettled, and then he says that I may sit in the room and sew if I want\nto. I can't believe that people really love each other unless they want\nto be together every instant, no matter what they are doing. Why, if\nOliver went out to men's dinners without me as Mr. Payson does (though\nshe doesn't seem to mind it) I should just sit at home by myself and cry\nmy eyes out. I think love, if it is love, ought to be all in all. I am\nperfectly sure that if I live to be a hundred I shall never want any\nsociety but Oliver's. He is the whole world to me, and when he is not\nhere I spend my time, unless I am at work, just sitting and thinking\nabout him. My one idea is to make him as happy as I can, and when a\nwoman does this for a man I don't think she has time to run around by\nherself as Mrs. Payson does. Tell dearest father that I so often think\nof his sermons and the beautiful things he said about women. The rector\nhere doesn't compare with him as a preacher.\n\nThis is such a long letter it will take two stamps. I've just let myself\nrun on without thinking what I was writing, so if I have made any\nmistakes in grammar or in spelling, please don't let father see them but\nread my letter aloud to him. I can shut my eyes and see you sitting at\ndinner, with Docia bringing in the plum pudding, and I know you will\ntalk of me while you help to it. Write me who comes to dinner with you.\nI wonder if Miss Priscilla and John Henry are there as usual. Do you\nknow whether John Henry ever goes to the Treadwell's or not? I wish you\nwould ask him to take Susan to see his old mammy in Pink Alley. Now that\nI am not there to go to see her occasionally, I am afraid she will get\nlonesome.\n\nGood-bye, dearest mother. I will write to you before New Year. I am so\nbusy that I don't have time to write every day, but you will understand\nand so will father.\n\n    With my heart's fondest love to you both,\n    Your\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. June 6, 1885.\n    DARLING MOTHER:\n\nThe little patterns were exactly what I wanted--thank you a thousand\ntimes. I knew you would be overjoyed at the news, and you are the only\nperson I've breathed it to--except, of course, dear Oliver, who is\nfrightened to death already. He has made me stop everything at once, and\nwhenever he sees me lift my hand, he begins to get nervous and begs me\nnot to do it. Oh, mother, he loves me so that it is really pathetic to\nsee his anxiety. And--can you believe it--he doesn't appear to be the\nleast bit glad about it. When I told him, he looked amazed--as if he had\nnever thought of its happening--and said, \"Oh, Virginia, not so soon!\"\nHe told me afterwards that, of course, he'd always thought we'd have\nchildren after a while, before we were middle-aged, but that he had\nwanted to stay like this for at least five or ten years. When the baby\ncomes, he says he supposes he'll like it, but that he can't honestly say\nhe is glad. It's funny how frightened he is, because I am not the least\nbit so. All women must expect to have children when they marry, and if\nGod makes them suffer for it, it must be because it is best that they\nshould. Perhaps they wouldn't love their babies so much if they got them\neasily. I never think of the pain a minute. It all seems so beautiful\nand sacred to me that I can't understand why Oliver isn't enraptured\njust as I am. To think of a new life starting into the world from me--a\nlife that is half mine and half Oliver's, and one that would never be at\nall except for our love. The baby will seem from the very first minute\nto be our love made into flesh. I don't see how a woman who feels this\ncould waste a thought on what she has to suffer.\n\nI am so glad you are going to send me a nurse from Dinwiddie, because\nI'm afraid I could never get one here that I could trust. The servant\nOliver got me is no earthly account, and I still do as much of the\ncooking as I can. The house doesn't look nearly so nice as it used to,\nbut the doctor tells me that I mustn't sweep, so I only do the light\ndusting. I sew almost all the time, and I've already finished the little\nslips. To-day I'm going to cut out the petticoats. I couldn't tell from\nthe pattern you sent whether they fasten in front or in the back. There\nare no places for buttonholes. Do you use safety pins to fasten them\nwith? The embroidery is perfectly lovely, and will make the sweetest\ntrimming. I am using pink for the basket because Oliver and I both hope\nthe baby will be a girl. If it is, I shall name her after you, of\ncourse, and I want her to be just exactly like you. Oliver says he can't\nunderstand why anybody ever wants a boy--girls are so much nicer. But\nthen he insists that if she isn't born with blue eyes, he will send her\nto the orphanage.\n\nI am trying to do just as you tell me to, and to be as careful as I\npossibly can. The doctor thinks I've stayed indoors too much since I\ncame here, so I go out for a little walk with Oliver every night. I am\nso afraid that somebody will see me that I really hate to go out at all,\nand always choose the darkest streets I can find. Last night I had a bad\nstumble, and Oliver says he doesn't care if the whole town discovers us,\nhe's not going to take me down any more unlighted alleys.\n\nIt has been terribly hot all day--not a breath of air stirring--and I\nnever felt the heat so much in my life. The doctor says it's because of\nmy condition--and last night, after Oliver went to sleep, I got up and\nsat by the window until daybreak. At first I was dreadfully frightened,\nand thought I was going to stifle--but poor Oliver had come home so\ntired that I made up my mind I wasn't going to wake him if I could\npossibly help it. This morning I didn't tell him a word about it, and he\nhasn't the least idea that I didn't sleep soundly all night. I suppose\nthat's why I feel so dragged and worn out to-day, just as if somebody\nhad given me a good beating. I was obliged to lie down most of the\nafternoon, but I am going to take a bath in a few minutes and try to\nmake myself look nice and fresh before Oliver comes home. I have let out\nthat flowered organdie--the one you liked so much--and I wear it almost\nevery evening. I know I look dreadfully, but Oliver says I am more\nbeautiful than ever. It seems to me sometimes that men are born blind\nwhere women are concerned, but perhaps God made it that way on purpose.\nDo you know Oliver really admires Mrs. Payson, and he thinks that red\nfeather very becoming to her. He says she's much too good for her\nhusband, but I have been obliged to disagree with him about that. Even\nif Mr. Payson does drink a little, I am sure it is only because he gets\nlonesome when he is left by himself, and that she could prevent it if\nshe tried. Oliver and I never talk about these things because he sees\nthat I feel so strongly about them.\n\nOh, darling mother, I shall be so glad to see you! I hope and pray that\nfather will be well enough for you to come a whole month ahead. In that\ncase you will be here in less than two months, won't you? If the baby\ncomes on the twelfth of August, she (I am perfectly sure it will be a\ngirl) and father will have the same birthday. I am so anxious that she\nshall be born on that day.\n\nWell, I must stop now, though I could run on forever. I never see a\nliving soul from one day to another--Mrs. Payson is out of town--so when\nOliver stays late at the office, and I am too tired to work, I get a\nlittle--just a little bit lonesome. Mr. Payson sent me a pile of novels\nby Oliver the other night--but I haven't looked into them. I always feel\nthat it is a waste of time to read when there are things about the house\nthat ought to be done. I wish everything didn't cost so much here. Money\ndoesn't go half as far as it does in Dinwiddie. The price of meat is\nalmost three times as much as it is at home, and chickens are so\nexpensive that we have them only twice a week. It is hard to housekeep\non a small allowance, and now that we have to save for the baby's\ncoming, I have to count every penny. I have bought a little book like\nyours, and I put down all that I spend during the day, and then add it\nup at night before going to bed. Oliver says I'm dreadfully frugal, but\nI am always so terribly afraid of running over my allowance (which is\nevery cent that we can afford) and not having the money to pay the\ndoctor's bills when they are due. Nobody could be more generous with\nmoney than Oliver is--I couldn't endure being married to a stingy man\nlike Mr. Treadwell--and the other day when one of the men in the office\ndied, he sent the most beautiful wreath that cost ten dollars. I am\ntrying to save enough out of the housekeeping balance to pay for it, for\nOliver always runs out of his pocket money before the middle of the\nmonth. I haven't bought anything for the baby because you sent me all\nthe materials I needed, and I have been sewing on those ever since they\ncame. Of course my own clothes are still as good as new, so the only\nexpense will be the doctor and the nurse and the extra things I shall be\nobliged to have to eat when I am sick.\n\nGive dear father a dozen kisses from me, and tell him to hurry and get\nwell so he can christen his granddaughter.\n\n    Your devoted and ever grateful\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. August 11, 1885.\n    DARLING MOTHER:\n\nJust a line to say that I am so, so sorry you can't come, but that you\nmustn't worry a minute, because everything is going beautifully, and I\nam not the least bit afraid. The doctor says he never saw any one in a\nbetter frame of mind or so little nervous. Give my dear love to father.\nI am so distressed that he should suffer as he does. Rheumatism must be\nsuch terrible pain, and I don't wonder that you are frightened lest it\nshould go to his heart. I shall send you a telegram as soon as the baby\ncomes.\n\n    Your devoted daughter,\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. August 29, 1885.\n    MY PRECIOUS MOTHER:\n\nThis is the first time I have sat up in bed, and I am trying to write a\nlittle note to you on a pillow instead of a desk. My hand shakes so that\nI'm afraid you won't be able to read it, but I felt that I wanted to\nsend you a few words of my very own, not dictated to the nurse or to\nMrs. Payson. I can't tell you how perfectly lovely Mrs. Payson has been\nto me. She was here all that dreadful night, and I believe I should have\ndied without her. The doctor said I had such a hard time because I'd let\nmyself get run down and stayed indoors too much. But I'm getting all\nright now--and the rest is over and doesn't matter. As soon as I am\nstrong again I shall be perfectly happy.\n\nOh, mother, aren't you delighted that the baby is a girl, after all? It\nwas the first question I asked when I came back to consciousness the\nnext morning, and when they told me it was, I said, \"Her name is Lucy\nPendleton,\" and that was all. I was so weak they wouldn't let me open my\nlips again, and Oliver was kept out of the room for almost ten days\nbecause I would talk to him. Poor fellow, it almost killed him. He is as\nwhite as a sheet still, and looks as if he had been through tortures. It\nmust have been terrible for him, because I was really very, very ill at\none time.\n\nBut it is all over now, and the baby is the sweetest thing you ever\nimagined. I believe she knows me already, and Mrs. Payson says she is\nexactly like me, though I can see the strongest resemblance to Oliver,\neven if she has blue eyes and he hasn't. Wasn't it lovely how everything\ncame just as we wanted it to--a girl, born on father's birthday, with\nblue eyes, and named Lucy? But, mother, darling, the most wonderful\nthing of all was that you seemed to be with me all through it. The whole\ntime I was unconscious I thought you were here, and the nurse tells me\nthat I was calling \"Mother! Mother!\" all that night. Nothing ever made\nme feel as close to you as having a baby of my own. I never knew before\nwhat you were to me, and how dearly, dearly I love you.\n\nThe nurse is taking the pencil away from me.\n\n    Your loving\n    VIRGINIA.\n\nIsn't it funny that Oliver won't take any interest in the baby at all?\nHe says she caused more trouble than she is worth. Was father like that?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. April 3, 1886.\n    DEAREST MOTHER:\n\nMy last letter was written an age ago, but I have been so busy since\nMarthy left that I've hardly had a moment in which to draw breath. It\nwas a blow to me that she wouldn't stay for she was really an excellent\nnurse and the baby got on so well with her, but there aren't any\ncoloured people of her kind here, and she got so homesick for Dinwiddie\nthat I thought she would lose her mind if she stayed. You know how\ndependent they are upon company, and going out on Sunday afternoon and\nall that kind of thing, and there really wasn't any amusement for her\nexcept taking the baby out in the morning. She got so low spirited that\nit was almost a relief when she went, but of course I feel her loss\ndreadfully. I haven't let the baby out of my sight because I wouldn't\ntrust Daisy with her for anything in the world. She is so terribly\nflighty. I have the crib brought into my room (though Oliver hates it)\nand I take entire charge of her night and day. I should love to do it if\nonly Oliver didn't mind it so much. He says I think more of the baby now\nthan I do of him. Isn't that absurd? But of course she does take every\nsingle minute of my time, and I can't dress myself for him every evening\nas carefully as I used to do and look after all the housekeeping\narrangements. Daisy is a very poor cook and she simply throws the things\non the table, but it seems to me that my first duty is to the baby, so I\ntry to put up with the discomforts as well as I can. It is hard to eat\nwhat she cooks since everything tastes exactly alike, but I try to\nswallow as much as I can because the doctor says that if I don't keep up\nmy strength I shall have to stop nursing the baby. Wouldn't that be\ndreadful? It almost breaks my heart to think of it, and I am sure we'd\nnever get any artificial food to agree with her. She is perfectly well\nnow, the sweetest, fattest thing you ever saw, and a real beauty, and\nshe is so devoted to me that she cries whenever I go out of her sight. I\nam never tired of watching her, and even when she is asleep I sit\nsometimes for an hour by her crib just thinking how pretty she looks\nwith her eyes closed and wishing you could see her. Oliver says I spoil\nher to death, but how can a baby of seven months be spoiled. He doesn't\nenjoy her half as much as I do, and sometimes I almost think that he\ngets impatient of seeing her always in my arms. At first he absolutely\nrefused to have her crib brought into our room, but when I cried, he\ngave in and was very sweet about it. I feel so ashamed sometimes of the\nway the house looks, but there doesn't seem to be any help for it\nbecause the doctor says if I let myself get tired it will be bad for the\nbaby. Of course I wouldn't put my own health before his comfort, but I\nam obliged to think first of the baby, am I not? Last night, for\ninstance, the poor little thing was ill with colic and I was up and down\nwith her until daybreak. Then this morning she woke early and I had to\nnurse her and give her her bath, and, added to everything else, Daisy's\ncousin died and she sent word she couldn't come. I slipped on a wrapper\nbefore taking a bath or fixing my hair and ran down to try and get\nOliver's breakfast, but the baby began to cry and he came after me and\nsaid he wanted to make the coffee himself. Then he brought a cup\nupstairs to me, but I was so tired and nervous that I couldn't drink it.\nHe didn't seem to understand why, feeling as badly as I did, I wouldn't\njust put the baby back into her crib and make her stay there until I got\nsome rest, but the little thing was so wide awake that I hadn't the\nheart to do it. Besides, it is so important to keep regular hours with\nher, isn't it? I don't suppose a man ever realizes how a woman looks at\nthese things, but you will understand, won't you, mother?\n\nI am all alone in the house to-night because a play is in town that\nOliver wanted to see and I made him go to it. He wanted to ask Mrs.\nMidden to sit downstairs (she has offered over and over again to do it)\nso that I might go too, but of course I wouldn't let him. I really\ncouldn't have enjoyed it a minute for thinking of the baby, and besides\nI never cared for the theatre. Then, too, he doesn't know (for I never\ntell him) how very tired I am by the time night comes. Sometimes when\nOliver comes home and we sit in the dining-room (we never use the\ndrawing-room, because it is across the hall and I'm afraid I shouldn't\nhear the baby cry) it is as much as I can do to keep my eyes open. I try\nnot to let him notice it, but one night when he read me the first act of\na play he is writing, I went to sleep, and though he didn't say\nanything, I could see that he was very much hurt. He worries a good deal\nabout my health, too, and he even went out one day and engaged a nurse\nwithout saying anything to me about it. After I had talked to her\nthough, I saw that she would never do, so I sent her away before he came\nhome. I wish I could get really strong and feel well again, but the\ndoctor insists I never will until I get out of doors and use my\nmuscles. But you stay in the house all the time and so did grandmother,\nso I don't believe there's a word of truth in what he says. Anyway, I go\nout every day now with the baby.\n\nThank you so much for the little bands. They are just what I wanted.\n\n    With dearest love,\n    Your devoted\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. June 10, 1886.\n    DEAREST MOTHER:\n\nDaisy left a week ago and we couldn't find another servant until to-day.\nI must say that I prefer coloured servants. They are so much more\ndependable. I didn't know until the evening before Daisy left that she\nwas going, and I had to send Oliver straight out to see if he could find\nsomebody to come in and help me. There wasn't a soul to be had until\nto-day, however, so for a week I was obliged to make Oliver get his\ndinner at the boarding-house. It doesn't make any difference what I have\nbecause I haven't a particle of appetite, and I'd just as soon eat tea\nand toast as anything else. Of course, but for the baby I could have\nmanaged perfectly well--but she has been so fretful of late that she\ndoesn't let me put her down a minute. The doctor says her teeth are\nbeginning to hurt her, and that I must expect to have trouble the first\nsummer. She has been so well until now that he thinks it has been really\nremarkable. He tells me he never knew a healthier baby, but of course I\nam terribly anxious about her teething in the hot weather. If she grows\nmuch more fretful I'm afraid I shall have to take her to the country\nfor July and August. It seems dreadful to leave Oliver all alone, but I\ndon't see how I can help it if the doctor advises me to go. Oliver has\ngone to some musical comedy at the Academy to-night, and I am so tired\nthat I am going to bed just as soon as I finish this letter. I hope and\npray that the baby will have a quiet night. Don't you think that Daisy\ntreated me very badly considering how kind I had been to her? Only a\nweek ago when she was taken with pain in the night, I got up and made\nher a mustard plaster and sat by her bed until she felt easier. The next\nday I did all of her work, and yet she has so little gratitude that she\ncould leave me this way when she knows perfectly well that I am worried\nto death about the baby's first summer. I'd give anything if I could go\nhome in July as you suggest, but it is such a long trip, and the heat\nwill probably be quite as bad in Dinwiddie as here. Of course, it would\nmake all the difference in the world to me to be where I could have you\nto advise me about the baby, and I'd go to-morrow if it only wasn't so\nfar. Mrs. Midden has told me of a boarding-house in the country not more\nthan twenty miles from here where Oliver could come down every evening,\nand we may decide to go there for a month or two. I can't help feeling\nvery anxious, especially as Mrs. Scott's little boy--he is just the age\nof baby--was taken ill the other night, and they thought he would die\nbefore they could get a doctor.\n\nThis letter is full of my worries, but in spite of them I am the\nhappiest woman that ever lived. Oliver is the best thing to me you can\nimagine, and the baby is so fascinating that I enjoy every minute I am\nwith her. It is the greatest fun to watch her in her bath. I know you\nwould simply go into raptures over her--and she is so bright that she\nalready understands every word that I say. She grows more like Oliver\nall the time, and the other day while I was watching her playing with\nher rubber doll, she looked so beautiful that it almost frightened me.\n\nI am so glad dear father is well, and what you wrote me about John\nHenry's admiration for Susan interested me so much that I sat straight\ndown and wrote to him. Why do you think that it is only friendship and\nthat he isn't in love with her? If he really thinks her the \"finest girl\nin the world,\" I should imagine he was beginning to be pretty serious. I\nam delighted to hear that he is going to take her to the festival. Tell\nSusan from me that I shall never be satisfied until she is as happy as I\nam. Mr. Treadwell was right, I believe, not to let her go to college,\nthough of course I want dear Susan to have whatever she sets her heart\non. But, when all is said, you were wise in teaching me that nothing\nmatters to a woman except love. More and more I am learning that if we\nonly love unselfishly enough, everything else will work out for good to\nus. My little worries can't keep me from being so blissfully happy that\nI want to sing all the time. Work is a joy to me because I feel that I\nam doing it for Oliver and the baby. And with two such treasures to live\nfor I should be the most ungrateful creature alive if I ever complained.\n\n    Your ever loving daughter,\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY, July 1, 1886.\n    DEAREST MOTHER:\n\nWe are leaving suddenly for the country, and I'll send our address just\nas soon as we get there. The doctor thinks I ought to take the baby\naway from town, so I am going to the boarding-house I wrote you about.\nOliver will come down every evening--it's only an hour's trip.\n\nI am so tired from packing that I can't write any more.\n\n    Lovingly,\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. September 15, 1886.\n    DEAREST MOTHER:\n\nHere we are back again in our home, and I was never so thankful in my\nlife to get away from any place. I wrote you how dreadfully inconvenient\nit was, but it would take pages to tell you all of my experiences in the\nlast few days. Such people you never saw in your life! And the food got\nso uneatable that I lived on crackers for the last fortnight.\nFortunately, I was still nursing the baby, but the doctor has just told\nme that I must stop. I am so distressed about it. Do you think it will\ngo hard with her after the first year? She is as fat and well as she can\nbe now, but I live in hourly terror of her getting sick. If anything\nshould happen to her, I believe it would kill me.\n\nOliver sends love. He is working very hard at the office now, and he\nhates it.\n\n    Your loving\n    VIRGINIA.\n\nI forgot to tell you that Mrs. Midden has found me such a nice servant.\nShe is a very young coloured girl, but looks so kind and capable, and\nsays she is perfectly devoted to children. Her name is Marthy, and I\nfeel that she's going to be a great comfort to me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    MATOACA CITY. October 12, 1886.\n    MY DARLING MOTHER:\n\nI was overjoyed to find your letter in the hall when I came out from\nbreakfast. Has it really been two weeks since I wrote to you? That seems\ndreadful, but the days go by so fast that I hardly realize how long it\nis between my letters.\n\nWe are all well, and Marthy has become the greatest help to me. Of\ncourse, I don't let her do anything for the baby, but she is so careful\nand trustworthy that I am going to try having her take out the carriage\nin the morning. At first I shan't let her go off the block, so that I\ncan have my eye on her all the time. Little Lucy took a fancy to her at\nonce, and really enjoys playing with her. This makes it possible for me\nto do a little sewing, and I am working hard trying to make over one or\ntwo of my dresses. Oliver wants me to have a dressmaker do it, but we\nhave so many extra expenses all the time that I don't feel we can afford\nto put out any sewing. We have spent a great deal on doctors since we\nwere married, but of course with a young child we can't very well expect\nanything else.\n\nAnd now, dearest mother, I have something to tell you, which no one\nknows--not even Oliver--except Doctor Marshall and myself. We are going\nto have another darling baby in March, if everything goes as it ought\nto. I have kept it a secret because Oliver has had a good many business\nworries, and I knew it would make him miserable. It never seems to have\nentered his head that it might happen again so soon, and for his sake I\ndo wish we could have waited until we got a little more money in the\nbank, but I suppose I oughtn't to say this because God would certainly\nnot send children into the world unless it was right for them to be\nborn. I try to remember what dear grandmamma said when somebody condoled\nwith her at the time she was expecting her tenth child--that she hoped\nshe was too good a Christian to dictate to the Lord as to how many souls\nHe should send into the world. As for me, I should be perfectly\ndelighted--it will be so much better for baby to have a little brother\nor sister to play with when she gets bigger--but I can't help worrying\nabout Oliver's peculiar attitude of mind. I am sure that father wouldn't\nhave felt that way, and think how poor he has always been. Perhaps it\ncomes from dear Oliver having lived abroad so much and away from the\nChristian influences, which have been one of the greatest blessings of\nmy life. I have put off telling him every day just because I dread to\nthink of the blow it will be to him. He is the dearest and best husband\nthat ever lived, and I worship the ground he walks on, but, do you know,\nthings are always a surprise to him when they happen? He never looks\nahead a single minute. I am sometimes afraid that he isn't the least bit\npractical, and it makes him impatient when I talk to him about trying to\ncut down expenses. Of course, I have to save as much as I can and I\ncount every single penny, or we'd never have enough money to get through\nthe month. I never buy a stitch for either the baby or myself, though\nOliver complains now and then that I don't dress as well as I used to\ndo. But how can I when I've worn the same things ever since my marriage,\nbesides making the baby's clothes out of my old ones? You can understand\nfrom this how grateful I am for the check you sent--but, dearest mother,\nI know that you oughtn't to have done it, and that you sacrificed your\nown comfort and father's to give it to me.\n\nI wish Oliver could get something to do in Dinwiddie. He will never be\nhappy here, and we could live on so much less money at home--in a little\nhouse near the rectory.\n\n    Your loving child,\n    VIRGINIA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE RETURN\n\n\nOn a February morning five years later, Mrs. Pendleton, who was\nreturning from her daily trip to the market, met Susan Treadwell at the\ncorner of Old Street.\n\n\"You are coming up to welcome Jinny, aren't you, Susan?\" she asked. \"The\ntrain gets in at four o'clock.\"\n\n\"Why, of course. I couldn't sleep a wink until I'd seen her. It has been\nseven years, and it seems a perfect eternity.\"\n\n\"She hasn't changed much--at least she hadn't six months ago when I was\nout there at the birth of her last baby. The little thing lived only two\nhours, you know, and I thought at first his death would kill her.\"\n\n\"It was a great blow--but she has been fortunate never to have had a\nday's sickness with the other three. I am dying to see them--especially\nthe eldest. That's your namesake, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's Lucy. She's six years old now, and as good as an angel, but\nshe hasn't fulfilled her promise of beauty. Virginia says she was the\nprettiest baby she ever saw.\"\n\n\"Everybody says that Jenny, the youngest, is a perfect beauty.\"\n\n\"That's why her father makes so much of her, I reckon. I told him when I\nwas out there that he oughtn't to show such a difference between them.\nDo you know, Susan, I wouldn't say it to anybody else, but I don't\nbelieve Oliver has a real fondness for children. He gets tired of having\nthem always about, and that makes him impatient. Now, Virginia is a born\nmother, just like her grandmother and all the women of our family.\"\n\n\"I should think Oliver would be crazy about the boy. He was named after\nhis father, too.\"\n\n\"Virginia felt she ought to name him Henry, but we call him Harry. No,\nOliver hardly ever takes any notice of him. I don't mean, of course,\nthat he isn't nice and kind to them--but he isn't wrapped up in them\nheart and soul as Virginia is. I really believe he is more absorbed in\nthis play he has written than he is in the children.\"\n\n\"I am so glad to hear that two of his plays are going to be staged.\nThat's splendid, isn't it?\"\n\n\"He is coming back to Dinwiddie because of it. Now that he is assured of\nrecognition, he says he is going to devote all his time to writing. Poor\nfellow, he did so hate the work out at Matoaca City, though I must say\nhe was very faithful and persevering about it.\"\n\n\"You've taken that little house in Prince Street for them, where old\nMiss Franklin used to live, haven't you? The last time I saw you, you\nhadn't quite decided about it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't resist it because it is only three squares from the rectory.\nMr. Pendleton set his heart on it from the first minute.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm so glad,\" said Susan, shifting the small basket of fruit she\ncarried from one arm to the other, \"and I'll certainly run in and see\nthem this evening--I suppose they'll be at the rectory for supper?\"\n\n\"Why, no. Jinny said she couldn't bear to be away from the children the\nfirst night, so we are all going there. I shall send Docia over to cook\nsupper before they get here, and I've just been to market to see if I\ncould find anything that Oliver would particularly like. He used to be\nso fond of sweetbreads.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dewlap has some very nice ones. I got one for mother. She hasn't\nbeen well for the last few days.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that. Give her my love and tell her I'll come down\njust as soon as I get Jinny settled. I've been so taken up getting the\nhouse ready that I haven't thought of another thing for three weeks.\"\n\n\"When will Oliver's play be put on in New York?\" asked Susan, turning\nback after they had parted.\n\n\"In three weeks. He is going back again for the last rehearsals. I wish\nJinny could go with him, but I don't believe she would spend a night\naway from the children for anything on earth.\"\n\n\"Isn't it beautiful that her marriage has turned out so well?\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't believe she could be any happier if she tried, and I must\nsay that Oliver makes a much better husband than I ever thought he\nwould. I never heard them disagree the whole time I was there. Of\ncourse, Jinny gives up to him in everything except where the children\nare concerned, but, then, a woman always expects to do that. One thing\nI'm certain of--he couldn't have found a better wife if he'd searched\nthe world over. She never thinks of herself a minute, and you know how\nfond she used to be of pretty clothes and of fixing herself up. Now,\nshe simply lives in Oliver and the children, and she is the proudest\nthing of his plays! The rector says that she thinks he is Shakespeare\nand Milton rolled into one.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be nicer,\" said Susan, \"and it is all such a happy\nsurprise to me. Of course, I always thought Oliver very\nattractive--everybody does--but he seemed to me to be selfish and\nundisciplined, and I wasn't at all sure that Jinny was the kind of woman\nto bring out the best in him.\"\n\n\"You'll think so when you see them together.\"\n\nThen they smiled and parted, Mrs. Pendleton hurrying back to the little\nhouse, while Susan turned down Old Street, in the direction of her home.\nShe walked rapidly, with an easy swinging pace seldom seen in the women\nof Dinwiddie, and not heartily approved by the men. At twenty-seven she\nwas far handsomer than she had been at twenty, for her figure had grown\nmore shapely and her face had lost the look of intense preoccupation\nwhich had once marred its charm. Strong, capable, conquering, she still\nappeared; but in some subtle way she had grown softer. Mrs. Pendleton\nwould probably have said that she had \"settled.\"\n\nAt the first corner she met John Henry on his way to the bank, and\nturning, he walked with her to the end of the block, where they stood a\nmoment discussing Virginia's return.\n\n\"I've just been to attend to some bills,\" he explained; \"that's why I'm\nout at this hour. You never come into the bank now, I notice.\"\n\n\"Not often. Are you going to see Jinny this evening?\"\n\n\"If you'll let me bring you home. I can't imagine Virginia with three\nchildren, can you? I'm half afraid to see her again.\"\n\n\"You mean you think she may have changed? Mrs. Pendleton says not.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's Aunt Lucy all over. If Virginia had got as fat as Miss\nPriscilla, she'd still believe she hadn't altered a particle.\"\n\n\"Well, she isn't fat, anyway. She weighs less than she ever did.\"\n\nHer serious eyes dwelt on him under the green sunshade she held, and it\nis possible that she wondered vaguely what it was about John Henry that\nhad made her love him unsought ever since she could remember. He was\ncertainly not handsome--though he was less stout and much better looking\nthan he used to be: he was not particularly clever, even if he was\nsuccessful with the work Cyrus had given him. She was under no delusion\nconcerning him (being a remarkably clear-sighted young person), yet she\nknew that taking him just as he was, large, slow, kind, good, he aroused\nin her a tenderness that was almost ridiculous. She had waited patiently\nseven years for him to discover that he cared for her--a fact which had\nbeen perfectly evident to her long before his duller wit had perceived\nit.\n\n\"Do you want to be there to welcome Jinny?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'd thought I'd go up about five, so I could get a glimpse of the\nchildren before they are put to bed.\"\n\n\"Then I'll meet you there and bring you home. I wouldn't take anything\nfor meeting you, Susan. There's something about you that always cheers\nme.\"\n\nShe met his eyes frankly. \"Well, I'm glad of that,\" she replied in her\nconfident way, and held out her hand through the handle of the basket.\nAn instant later, when she passed on into Bolingbroke Street, there was\na smile on her face which made it almost pretty.\n\nThe front door was open, and as she entered the house her mother came\ngroping toward her out of the close-smelling dusk of the hall.\n\n\"I thought you'd never get back, Susan. I've had such a funny feeling.\"\n\n\"What kind of feeling, mother? It must be just nervousness. Here are\nsome beautiful grapes I've brought you.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't leave me alone. I don't like to be left alone.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't leave you any more than I'm obliged to, but if I stay\nshut up here I feel as if I'd smother. I've asked Miss Willy to come and\nsit with you this evening while I run up to welcome Virginia.\"\n\n\"Is she coming back? Nobody told me. Nobody tells me anything.\"\n\n\"But I did tell you. Why, we've been talking about it for weeks. You\nmust have forgotten.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have forgotten it. I'm sure I shouldn't have forgotten it\nif you had told me. But you keep everything from me. You are just like\nyour father. You and James are both just like your father.\" Her voice\nhad grown peevish, and an expression of fury distorted her usually\npassive features.\n\n\"Why, mother, what in the world is the matter?\" asked Susan, startled by\nher manner. \"Come upstairs and lie down. I don't believe you are well.\nYou didn't eat a morsel of breakfast, so I'm going to fix you a nice\nlittle lunch. I got you a beautiful sweetbread from Mr. Dewlap.\"\n\nPutting her arm about her, she led her up the long flight of steps to\nher room, where Mrs. Treadwell, pacified by the attention, began\nimmediately to doze on the chintz-covered couch by the window.\n\n\"I don't see what on earth ever made me marry your father, Susan,\" she\nsaid, starting up half an hour later, when her daughter appeared with\nthe tray. \"Everybody knew the Treadwells couldn't hold a candle to my\nfamily.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about that now, mother,\" replied Susan briskly, while\nshe placed the tray on a little table at the head of the couch. \"Sit up\nand eat these oysters.\"\n\n\"I'm obliged to worry over it,\" returned Mrs. Treadwell irritably, while\nshe watched her daughter arrange her plate and pour out the green tea\nfrom the little Rebecca-at-the-well teapot. \"I don't see what got into\nmy head and made me do it. Why, his branch of the Treadwells had petered\nout until they were as common as dirt.\"\n\n\"Well, it's too late to mend matters, so we'd better turn in and try to\nmake the best of them.\" She held out an oyster on the end of a fork, and\nher mother received and ate it obediently.\n\n\"If I could only once understand why I did it, I think I could rest\neasier, Susan.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you were in love with each other. I've heard of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Well, if I was going to fall in love, I reckon I could have found\nsomebody better to fall in love with,\" retorted Mrs. Treadwell with the\nsame strange excitement in her manner. Then she took up her knife and\nfork and began to eat her luncheon with relish.\n\nAt five o'clock that afternoon, when Susan reached the house in Prince\nStreet, Virginia, with her youngest child in her arms, was just stepping\nout of a dilapidated \"hack,\" from which a grinning negro driver handed a\ncollection of lunch baskets into the eager hands of the rector and Mrs.\nPendleton, who stood on the pavement.\n\n\"Here's Susan!\" called Mrs. Pendleton in her cheerful voice, rather as\nif she feared her daughter would overlook her friend in the excitement\nof homecoming.\n\n\"Oh, you darling Susan!\" exclaimed Virginia, kissing her over the head\nof a sleeping child in her arms. \"This is Jenny--poor little thing, she\nhasn't been able to keep her eyes open. Don't you think she is the\nliving image of our Saint Memin portrait of great-grandmamma?\"\n\n\"She's a cherub,\" said Susan. \"Let me look at you first, Jinny. I want\nto see if you've changed.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't expect me to look exactly as I did before I had four\nbabies!\" returned Virginia with a happy laugh. She was thinner, and\nthere were dark circles of fatigue from the long journey under her eyes,\nbut the Madonna-like possibilities in her face were fulfilled, and it\nseemed to Susan that she was, if anything, lovelier than before. The\nloss of her girlish bloom was forgotten in the expression of love and\ngoodness which irradiated her features. She wore a black cloth skirt,\nand a blouse of some ugly blue figured silk finished at the neck with\nthe lace scarf Susan had sent her at Christmas. Her hat was a\ncharacterless black straw trimmed with a bunch of yellow daisies; and\nby its shape alone, Susan discerned that Virginia had ceased to consider\nwhether or not her clothes were becoming. But she shone with an air of\ncalm and radiant happiness in which all trivial details were\ntransfigured as by a flood of light.\n\n\"This is Lucy. She is six years old, and to think that she has never\nseen her dear Aunt Susan,\" said Virginia, while she pulled forward the\nlittle girl who was shyly clinging to her skirt. \"And the other is\nHarry. Marthy, bring Harry here and let him speak to Miss Susan. He is\nnearly four, and so big for his age. Where is Harry, Marthy?\"\n\n\"He's gone into the yard, ma'am, I couldn't keep him back,\" said Marthy.\n\"As soon as he caught sight of that pile of bricks he wanted to begin\nbuilding.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll go, too,\" replied Virginia. \"That child is simply crazy\nabout building. Has Oliver paid the driver, mother? And what has become\nof him? Susan, have you spoken to Oliver?\"\n\nNo, Susan hadn't, but as they turned, he appeared on the porch and came\neagerly forward. Her first impression was that he had grown handsomer\nthan she had ever believed possible; and the next minute she asked\nherself how in the world he had managed to exercise his vitality in\nMatoaca City. He was one of those men, she saw, in whom the spirit of\nyouth burned like a flame. Every year would pass as a blessing, not as a\ncurse, to him, and already, because of her intenser emotions and her\nnarrower interests, Virginia was beginning to look older than he. There\nwas a difference, too, in their dress, for he had the carefully groomed\nand well-brushed appearance so rare in Dinwiddie, while Virginia's\nclothes might have been worn, with equal propriety, by Miss Priscilla\nBatte. She was still lovely, but it was a loveliness, Susan felt with a\npang, that would break early.\n\n\"Why, there's Susan!\" exclaimed Oliver, coming toward her with an eager\npleasure in his face which made it more boyish than ever. \"Well, well,\nit's good to see you, Susan. Are you the same old dear I left behind\nme?\"\n\n\"The same,\" said Susan laughing. \"And so glad about your plays, Oliver,\nso perfectly delighted.\"\n\n\"By Jove, you're the first person to speak of them,\" he replied. \"Nobody\nelse seems to think a play is worth mentioning as long as a baby is in\nsight. That's a delusion of Virginia's, too. I wish you'd convince her,\nSusan, that a man is of some use except as a husband and a father.\"\n\n\"But they are such nice babies, Oliver.\"\n\n\"Oh, nice enough as babies go. The boy's a trump. He'd be a man already\nif his mother would let him. But babies ought to have their season like\neverything else under the sun. For God's sake, Susan, talk to me about\nsomething else!\" he added in mock despair.\n\nVirginia was already in the house, and when Oliver and Susan joined her,\nthey found Mrs. Pendleton trying to persuade her to let Marthy carry the\nsleeping Jenny up to the nursery.\n\n\"Give me that child, Jinny,\" said Oliver, a trifle sharply. \"You know\nthe doctor told you not to carry her upstairs.\"\n\n\"But I'm sure it won't hurt me,\" she responded, with an angelic\nsweetness of voice. \"It will wake her to be changed, and the poor\nlittle thing has had such a trying day.\"\n\n\"Well, you aren't going to carry her, if she wakes twenty times,\"\nretorted Oliver. \"Here, Marthy, if she thinks I'd drop her, suppose you\ntry it.\"\n\n\"Why, bless you, sir, I can take her so she won't know it,\" returned\nMarthy reassuringly, and coming forward, she proved her ability by\nsliding the unconscious child from Virginia's arms into her own.\n\n\"Where is Harry?\" asked Mrs. Pendleton anxiously. \"Nobody has seen Harry\nsince we got here.\"\n\n\"I is, ma'am,\" replied the cheerful Marthy over her shoulder, as she\ntoiled up the stairs, with Virginia and little Lucy noiselessly\nfollowing. \"I've undressed him and I was obliged to hide his clothes to\nkeep him from putting 'em on again. He's near daft with excitement.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better go up and help get them to bed,\" said Mrs.\nPendleton, turning from the rector to Oliver. \"I'm afraid Jinny will be\ntoo tired to enjoy her supper. Harry is in such a gale of spirits I can\nhear him talking.\"\n\n\"You might as well, my dear,\" rejoined the rector mildly, as he stooped\nover to replace one of the baby's bottles in the basket from which it\nhad slipped. \"Don't you think we might get some of these things out of\nthe way?\" he added. \"If you take that alcohol stove, Oliver, I'll follow\nwith these caps and shawls.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" rejoined Oliver readily. He always addressed the\nrector as \"sir,\" partly because it seemed to him to be appropriate,\npartly because he knew that the older man expected him to do so. It was\none of Oliver's most engaging characteristics that he usually adapted\nhimself with perfect ease to whatever life or other people expected of\nhim.\n\nWhile they were carrying the baskets into the passage at the back of the\ndining-room, Mrs. Pendleton, whose nervous longing had got at last\nbeyond her control, deserted Susan, with an apology, and flitted up the\nstairs.\n\n\"Come up and tell Jinny good-night before you go, dear,\" she added; \"I'm\nafraid she will not get down again to see you.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about me,\" replied Susan. \"I want to say a few words to\nOliver, and then I'm coming up to see Harry. Harry appears to me to be a\nman of personality.\"\n\n\"He's a darling child,\" replied Mrs. Pendleton, a little vaguely, \"and\nJinny says she never saw him so headstrong before. He is usually as good\nas gold.\"\n\n\"Well, well, it's a fine family,\" said the rector, beaming upon his\nson-in-law, when they returned from the passage. \"I never saw three\nhealthier children. It's a pity you lost the other one,\" he added in a\ngraver tone, \"but as he lived such a short time, Virginia couldn't take\nit so much to heart as if he had been older. She seems to have got over\nthe disappointment.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think she's got over it,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"It will be good for her to be back in Dinwiddie. I never felt satisfied\nto think of her so far away.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm glad we could come back,\" agreed Oliver pleasantly, though he\nappeared to Susan's quick eye to be making an effort.\n\n\"By the way, I haven't spoken of your literary work,\" remarked the\nrector, with the manner of a man who is saying something very agreeable.\n\"I have never been to the theatre, but I understand that it is losing a\ngreat deal of its ill odour. I always remember when anything is said\nabout the stage that, after all, Shakespeare was an actor. We may be\nold-fashioned in Dinwiddie,\" he pursued in the complacent tone in which\nthe admission of this failing is invariably made, \"but I don't think we\ncan have any objection to sweet, clean plays, with an elevating moral\ntone to them. They are no worse, anyway, than novels.\"\n\nThough Oliver kept his face under such admirable control, Susan,\nglancing at him quickly, saw a shade of expression, too fine for\namusement, too cordial for resentment, pass over his features. His\ncolour, which was always high, deepened, and raising his head, he\nbrushed the smooth dark hair back from his forehead. Through some\nintuitive strain of sympathy, Susan understood, while she watched him,\nthat his plays were as vital a matter in his life as the children were\nin Virginia's.\n\n\"I must run up and see Harry before he goes to sleep,\" she said, feeling\ninstinctively that the conversation was becoming a strain.\n\nAt the allusion to his grandson, the rector's face lost immediately its\nexpression of forced pleasantness and relapsed into its look of genial\ncharm.\n\n\"You ought to be proud of that boy, Oliver,\" he observed, beaming.\n\"There's the making of a fine man in him, but you mustn't let Jinny\nspoil him. It took all my strength and authority to keep Lucy from\nruining Jinny, and I've always said that my brother-in-law Tom Bland\nwould have been a first-rate fellow if it hadn't been for the way his\nmother raised him. God knows, I like a woman to be wrapped up heart and\nsoul in her household--and I don't suppose anybody ever accused the true\nSouthern lady of lacking in domesticity--but if they have a failing,\nwhich I refuse to admit, it is that they are almost too soft-hearted\nwhere their children--especially their sons--are concerned.\"\n\n\"I used to tell Virginia that she gave in to Harry too much when he was\na baby,\" said Oliver, who was evidently not without convictions\nregarding the rearing of his offspring; \"but she hasn't been nearly so\nbad about it since Jenny came. Jenny is the one I'm anxious about now.\nShe is a headstrong little beggar and she has learned already how to get\naround her mother when she wants anything. It's been worse, too,\" he\nadded, \"since we lost the last poor little chap. Ever since then\nVirginia has been in mortal terror for fear something would happen to\nthe others.\"\n\n\"It was hard on her,\" said the rector. \"We men can't understand how\nwomen feel about a thing like that, though,\" he added gently. \"I\nremember when we lost our babies--you know we had three before Virginia\ncame, but none of them lived more than a few hours--that I thought Lucy\nwould die of grief and disappointment. You see they have all the burden\nand the anxiety of it, and I sometimes think that a child begins to live\nfor a woman a long time before a man ever thinks of it as a human\nbeing.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" returned Oliver in the softened tone which\nproved to Susan that he was emotionally stirred. \"I tried to be as\nsympathetic with Virginia as I could, but--do you know?--I stopped to\nask myself sometimes if I could really understand. It seemed to her so\nstrange that I wasn't knocked all to pieces by the thing--that I could\ngo on writing as if nothing had happened.\"\n\n\"I am not sure that it isn't beyond the imagination of a man to enter\ninto a woman's most sacred feeling,\" remarked the rector, with a touch\nof the sentimentality in which he religiously shrouded the feminine sex.\nSo ineradicable, indeed, was his belief in the inherent virtue of every\nwoman, that he had several times fallen a helpless victim in the\nfinancial traps of conscienceless Delilahs. But since his innocence was\nas temperamental a quality as was Virginia's maternal passion,\nexperience had taught him nothing, and the fact that he had been\ndeceived in the past threw no shadow of safeguard around his steps in\nthe present. This endearing trait, which made him so successful as a\nhusband, was probably the cause of his unmitigated failure as a\nreformer. In looking at a woman, it was impossible for him to see\nanything except perfection.\n\nWhen Susan reached the top of the staircase, Mrs. Pendleton called to\nher, through the half open door of the nursery, to come in and hear how\nbeautifully Lucy was saying her prayers. Her voice was full of a\nsuppressed excitement; there was a soft pink flush in her cheeks; and it\nseemed to Susan that the presence of her grandchildren had made her\nalmost a girl again. She sat on the edge of a trundle-bed slipping a\nnightgown over the plump shoulders of little Lucy, who held herself very\nstill and prim, for she was a serious child, with a natural taste for\npropriety. Her small plain face, with its prominent features and pale\nblue eyes, had a look of intense earnestness and concentration, as\nthough the business of getting to bed absorbed all her energies; and the\nonly movement she made was to toss back the slender and very tight\nbraid of brown hair from her shoulders. She said her prayer as if it\nwere the multiplication table, and having finished, slid gently into\nbed, and held up her face to be kissed.\n\n\"Jenny wouldn't drink but half of her bottle, Miss Virginia,\" said\nMarthy, appearing suddenly on the threshold of Virginia's bedroom, for\nthe youngest child slept in the room with her mother. \"She dropped off\nto sleep so sound that I couldn't wake her.\"\n\n\"I hope she isn't sick, Marthy,\" responded Virginia in an anxious tone.\n\"Did she seem at all feverish?\"\n\n\"Naw'm, she ain't feverish, she's jest sleepy headed.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll come and look at her as soon as I can persuade Harry to\nfinish his prayers. He stopped in the middle of them, and he refuses to\nbless anybody but himself.\"\n\nShe spoke gravely, gazing with her exhaustless patience over the impish\nyellow head of Harry, who knelt, in his little nightgown, on the rug at\nher feet. His roving blue eyes met Susan's as she came over to him,\nwhile his chubby face broke into a delicious smile.\n\n\"Don't notice him, Susan,\" said Virginia, in her lovely voice which was\nas full of tenderness and as lacking in humour as her mother's. \"Harry,\nyou shan't speak to Aunt Susan until you've been good and finished your\nprayers.\"\n\n\"Don't want to speak to Aunt Susan,\" retorted the monster of infant\ndepravity, slipping his bare toes through a rent in the rug, and\ndoubling up with delight at his insubordination.\n\n\"I never knew him to behave like this before,\" said Virginia, almost in\ntears from shame and weariness. \"It must be the excitement of getting\nhere. He is usually so good. Now, Harry, begin all over again. 'God\nbless dear papa, God bless dear mamma, God bless dear grandmamma, God\nbless dear grandpapa, God bless dear Lucy, God bless dear Jenny, God\nbless all our dear friends.'\"\n\n\"God bless dear Harry,\" recited the monster.\n\n\"He has gone on like that ever since I started,\" said poor Virginia. \"I\ndon't know what to do about it. It seems dreadful to let him go to bed\nwithout saying his prayers properly. Now, Harry, please, please be good;\npoor mother is so tired, and she wants to go and kiss little Jenny\ngood-night. 'God bless dear papa,' and I'll let you get in bed.\"\n\n\"God bless Harry,\" was the imperturbable rejoinder to this pleading.\n\n\"Don't you want your poor mother to have some supper, Harry?\" inquired\nSusan severely.\n\n\"Harry wants supper,\" answered the innocent.\n\n\"I suppose I'll have to let him go,\" said Virginia, distractedly, \"but\nOliver will be horrified. He says I don't reason with them enough.\nHarry,\" she concluded sternly, \"don't you understand that it is naughty\nof you to behave this way and keep mamma away from poor little Jenny?\"\n\n\"Bad Jenny,\" said Harry.\n\n\"If you don't say your prayers this minute, you shan't have any\npreserves on your bread to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Bad preserves,\" retorted Harry.\n\n\"Well, if he won't, I don't see how I can make him,\" said Virginia.\n\"Come, then, get into bed, Harry, and go to sleep. You have been a bad\nboy and hurt poor mamma's feelings so that she is going to cry. She\nwon't be able to eat her supper for thinking of the way you have\ndisobeyed her.\"\n\nJumping into bed with a bound, Harry dug his head into the pillows,\ngurgled, and then sat up very straight.\n\n\"God bless dear papa, God bless dear mamma, God bless dear grandmamma,\nGod bless dear grandpapa, God bless dear Lucy, God bless dear Jenny, God\nbless our dear friends everywhere,\" he repeated in a resounding voice.\n\n\"Oh, you precious lamb!\" exclaimed Virginia. \"He couldn't bear to hurt\npoor mamma, could he?\" and she kissed him ecstatically before hastening\nto the slumbering Jenny in the adjoining room.\n\n\"I like the little scamp,\" said Susan, when she reported the scene to\nJohn Henry on the way home, \"but he manages his mother perfectly.\nAlready his sense of humour is better developed than hers.\"\n\n\"I can't get over seeing Virginia with children,\" observed John Henry,\nas if the fact of Virginia's motherhood had just become evident to him.\n\"It suits her, though. She looked happier than I ever saw her--and so,\nfor that matter, did Aunt Lucy.\"\n\n\"It made me wonder how Mrs. Pendleton had lived away from them for seven\nyears. Why, you can't imagine what she is--she doesn't seem to have any\nlife at all until you see her with Virginia's children.\"\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing,\" said John Henry slowly, \"and it taught me a\nlot just to look at them. I don't know why, but it seemed to make me\nunderstand how much I care about you, Susan.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you suspected it before?\" asked Susan as calmly as he had\nspoken. Emotionalism, she knew, she would never find in John Henry's\nwooing, and, though she could not have explained the reason of it to\nherself, she liked the brusque directness of his courtship. It was part\nof that large sincerity of nature which had first attracted her to him.\n\n\"Of course, in a way I knew I cared more for you than for anybody\nelse--but I didn't realize that you were more to me than Virginia had\never been. I had got so in the habit of thinking I was in love with her\nthat it came almost as a surprise to me to find that it was over.\"\n\n\"I knew it long ago,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Why didn't you make me see it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I waited for you to find it out yourself. I was sure that you would\nsome day.\"\n\n\"Do you think you could ever care for me, Susan?\"\n\nA smile quivered on Susan's lips as she looked up at him, but with the\nreticence which had always characterized her, she answered simply:\n\n\"I think I could, John Henry.\"\n\nHis hand reached down and closed over hers, and in the long look which\nthey exchanged under the flickering street lamp, she felt suddenly that\nperfect security which is usually the growth of happy years. Whatever\nthe future brought to them, she knew that she could trust John Henry's\nlove for her.\n\n\"And we've lost seven years, dearest,\" he said, with a catch in his\nvoice. \"We've lost seven years just because I happened to be born a\nfool.\"\n\n\"But we've got fifty ahead of us,\" she replied with a joyous laugh.\n\nAs she spoke, her heart cried out, \"Fifty years of the thing I want!\"\nand she looked up into the kind, serious face of John Henry as if it\nwere the face of incarnate happiness. A tremendous belief in life\nsurged from her brain through her body, which felt incredibly warm and\nyoung. She thought exultantly of herself as of one who did not accept\ndestiny, but commanded it.\n\nThey walked the rest of the way in silence, but he held her hand pressed\nclosely against his heart, and once or twice he turned in the deserted\nstreet and looked into her eyes as if he found there all the words that\nhe needed.\n\n\"We won't waste any more time, will we, Susan?\" he asked when they\nreached the house. \"Let's be married in December.\"\n\n\"If mother is better by then. She hasn't been well, and I am anxious\nabout her.\"\n\n\"We'll go to housekeeping at once. I'll begin looking about to-morrow.\nGod bless you, darling, for what you are giving me.\"\n\nShe caressed his hand gently with her fingers, and he was about to speak\nagain, when the door behind them opened and the head of Cyrus appeared\nlike that of a desolate bird of prey.\n\n\"Is that you, Susan?\" he inquired. \"Where have you been all this time?\nYour mother was taken ill more than an hour ago, and the doctor says\nthat she has been paralyzed.\"\n\nBreaking away from John Henry, Susan ran up the steps and past her\nfather into the hall, where Miss Willy stood weeping.\n\n\"I was all by myself with her. There wasn't another living soul in the\nhouse,\" sobbed the little dressmaker. \"She fell over just like that,\nwith her face all twisted, while I was talking to her.\"\n\n\"Oh, poor mother, poor mother!\" cried the girl as she ran upstairs. \"Is\nshe in her room, and who is with her?\"\n\n\"The doctor has been there for over an hour, and he says that she'll\nnever be able to move again. Oh, Susan, how will she stand it?\"\n\nBut Susan had already outstripped her, and was entering the sick-room,\nwhere Mrs. Treadwell lay unconscious, with her distorted face turned\ntoward the door, as though she were watching expectantly for some one\nwho would never come. As the girl fell on her knees beside the couch,\nher happiness seemed to dissolve like mist before the grim facts of\nmortal anguish and death. It was not until dawn, when the night's watch\nwas over and she stood alone beside her window, that she said to herself\nwith all the courage she could summon:\n\n\"And it's over for me, too. Everything is over for me, too. Oh, poor,\npoor mother!\"\n\nLove, which had seemed to her last night the supreme spirit in the\nuniverse, had surrendered its authority to the diviner image of Duty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHER CHILDREN\n\n\n\"Poor Aunt Belinda was paralyzed last night, Oliver,\" said Virginia the\nnext morning at breakfast. \"Miss Willy Whitlow just brought me a message\nfrom Susan. She spent the night there and was on her way this morning to\nask mother to go.\"\n\nOliver had come downstairs in one of his absent-minded moods, but by the\ntime Virginia had repeated her news he was able to take it in, and to\nshow a proper solicitude for his aunt.\n\n\"Are you going there?\" he asked. \"I am obliged to do a little work on my\nplay while I have the idea, but tell Susan I'll come immediately after\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I'll stop to inquire on my way back from market, but I won't be able to\nstay, because I've got all my unpacking to do. Can you take the children\nout this afternoon so Marthy can help me?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I simply can't. I've got to get on with this idea while\nI have control of it, and if I go out with the children I shan't be able\nto readjust my thoughts for twenty-fours hours.\"\n\n\"I'd like to go out with papa,\" said Lucy, who sat carefully drinking\nher cambric tea, so that she might not spill a drop on the mahogany\ntable.\n\n\"I want to go with papa,\" remarked Harry obstreperously, while he began\nto drum with his spoon on the red tin tray which protected the table\nfrom his assaults.\n\n\"Papa can't go with you, darling, but if mamma finishes her unpacking in\ntime, she'll come out into the park and play with you a little while. Be\ncareful, Harry, you are spilling your milk. Let mamma take your spoon\nout for you.\"\n\nHer coffee, which she had poured out a quarter of an hour ago, stood\nuntasted and tepid beside her plate, but from long habit she had grown\nto prefer it in that condition. When the waffles were handed to her, she\nhad absent-mindedly helped herself to one, while she watched Harry's\nreckless efforts to cut up his bacon, and it had grown sodden before she\nremembered that it ought to be buttered. She wore the black skirt and\nblue blouse in which she had travelled, for she had neglected to unpack\nher own clothes in her eagerness to get out the things that Oliver and\nthe children might need. Her hair had been hastily coiled around her\nhead, without so much as a glance in the mirror, but the expression of\nunselfish goodness in her face lent a charm even to the careless fashion\nin which she had put on her clothes. She was one of those women whose\nbeauty, being essentially virginal, belongs, like the blush of the rose,\nto a particular season. The delicacy of her skin invited the mark of\ntime or of anxiety, and already fine little lines were visible, in the\nstrong light of the morning, at the corners of her eyes and mouth. Yet\nneither the years or her physical neglect of herself could destroy the\nlook of almost angelic sweetness and love which illumined her features.\n\n\"Are you obliged to go to New York next week, Oliver?\" she asked,\ndividing her attention equally between him and Harry's knife and fork.\n\"Can't they rehearse 'The Beaten Road' just as well without you?\"\n\n\"No, I want to be there. Is there any reason why I shouldn't?\"\n\n\"Of course not. I was only thinking that Harry's birthday comes on\nFriday, and we should miss you.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm awfully sorry, but he'll have to grow old without me. By the\nway, why can't you run on with me for the first night, Virginia? Your\nmother can look after the babies for a couple of days, can't she?\"\n\nBut the absent-minded look of young motherhood had settled again on\nVirginia's face, for the voice of Jenny, raised in exasperated demand,\nwas heard from the nursery above.\n\n\"I wonder what's the matter?\" she said, half rising in her chair, while\nshe glanced nervously at the door. \"She was so fretful last night,\nOliver, that I'm afraid she is going to be sick. Will you keep an eye on\nHarry while I run up and see?\"\n\nTen minutes later she came down again, and began, with a relieved\nmanner, to stir her cold coffee.\n\n\"What were you saying, Oliver?\" she inquired so sweetly that his\nirritation vanished.\n\n\"I was just asking you if you couldn't let your mother look after the\nyoungsters for a day or two and come on with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd give anything in the world to see it, but I couldn't possibly\nleave the children. I'd be so terribly anxious for fear something would\nhappen.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I get in a blue funk about that play,\" he said seriously.\n\"I've staked so much on it that I'll be pretty well cut up, morally and\nfinancially, if it doesn't go.\"\n\n\"But of course it will go, Oliver. Anybody could tell that just to read\nit. Didn't Mr. Martin write you that he thought it one of the strongest\nplays ever written in America--and I'm sure that is a great deal for a\nmanager to say. Nobody could read a line of it without seeing that it is\na work of genius.\"\n\nFor an instant he appeared to draw assurance from her praise; then his\nface clouded, and he responded doubtfully:\n\n\"But you thought just as well of 'April Winds,' and nobody would look at\nthat.\"\n\n\"Well, that was perfect too, of its kind, but of course they are\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"I never thought much of that,\" he said, \"but I honestly believe that\n'The Beaten Road' is a great play. That's my judgment, and I'll stand by\nit.\"\n\n\"Of course it's great,\" she returned emphatically. \"No, Harry, you can't\nhave any more syrup on your buckwheat cake. You have eaten more already\nthan sister Lucy, and she is two years older than you are.\"\n\n\"Give it to the little beggar. It won't hurt him,\" said Oliver\nimpatiently, as Harry began to protest.\n\n\"But he really oughtn't to have it, Oliver. Well, then, just a drop. Oh,\nOliver, you've given him a great deal too much. Here, take mamma's plate\nand give her yours, Harry.\"\n\nBut Harry made no answer to her plea, because he was busily eating the\nsyrup as fast as he could under pressure of the fear that he might lose\nit all if he procrastinated.\n\n\"He'll be sick before night and you'll have yourself to blame, Oliver,\"\nsaid Virginia reproachfully.\n\nEver since the babies had come she had assumed naturally that Oliver's\ninterest in the small details of his children's clothes or health was\nperpetually fresh and absorbing like her own, and her habit of not\nseeing what she did not want to see in life had protected her from the\npainful discovery that he was occasionally bored. Once he had even tried\nto explain to her that, although he loved the children better than\neither his plays or the political fate of nations, there were times when\nthe latter questions interested him considerably more; but the humour\nwith which he inadvertently veiled his protest had turned the point of\nit entirely away from her comprehension. A deeper impression was made\nupon her by the fact that he had refused to stop reading about the last\nPresidential campaign long enough to come and persuade Harry to swallow\na dose of medicine. She, who seldom read a newspaper, and was innocent\nof any desire to exert even the most indirect influence upon the\nelections, had waked in the night to ask herself if it could possibly be\ntrue that Oliver loved the children less passionately than she did.\n\n\"I've got to get to work now, dear,\" he said, rising. \"I haven't had a\nquiet breakfast since Harry first came to the table. Don't you think\nMarthy might feed him upstairs again?\"\n\n\"Oh, Oliver! It would break his heart. He would think that he was in\ndisgrace.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure that he oughtn't to be. Now, Lucy's all right. She\nbehaves like a lady--but if you consider Harry an appetizing table\ncompanion, I don't.\"\n\n\"But, dearest, he's only a baby! And boys are different from girls. You\ncan't expect them to have as good manners.\"\n\n\"I can't remember that I ever made a nuisance of myself.\"\n\n\"Your father was very strict with you. But surely you don't think it is\nright to make your children afraid of you?\"\n\nThe genuine distress in her voice brought a laugh from him.\n\n\"Oh, well, they are your children, darling, and you may do as you please\nwith them.\"\n\n\"Bad papa!\" said Harry suddenly, chasing the last drop of syrup around\nhis plate with a bit of bread crumb.\n\n\"Oh, no, precious; good papa! You must promise papa to be a little\ngentleman or he won't let you breakfast with him any more.\"\n\nIt was Virginia's proud boast that Harry's smile would melt even his\ngreat-uncle, Cyrus, and she watched him with breathless rapture as he\nturned now in his high chair and tested the effect of this magic charm\non his father. His baby mouth broadened deliciously, showing two rows of\nsmall irregular teeth; his blue eyes shone until they seemed full of\nsparkles; his roguish, irresistible face became an incarnation of infant\nentreaty.\n\n\"I want to bekfast wid papa, an' I want more 'lasses,\" he remarked.\n\n\"He's a fascinating little rascal, there's no doubt of that,\" observed\nOliver, in response to Virginia's triumphant look. Then, bending over,\nhe kissed her on the cheek, before he picked up his newspapers and went\ninto his study at the back of the parlour.\n\nSome hours later, at their early dinner, she reported the result of her\nvisit to the Treadwells.\n\n\"It is too awful, Oliver. Aunt Belinda has not spoken yet, and she can't\nmove the lower part of her body at all. The doctor says she may live for\nyears, but he doesn't think she will ever be able to walk again. I feel\nso sorry for her and for poor Susan. Do you know, Susan engaged herself\nto John Henry last night just before her mother was paralyzed, and they\nwere to be married in December. But now she says she will give him up.\"\n\n\"John Henry!\" exclaimed Oliver in amazement. \"Why, what in the world\ndoes she see in John Henry?\"\n\n\"I don't know--one never knows what people see in each other, but she\nhas been in love with him all her life, I believe.\"\n\n\"Well, it's rough on her. Is she obliged to break off with him now?\"\n\n\"She says it wouldn't be fair to him not to. Her whole time must be\ngiven to nursing her mother. There's something splendid about Susan,\nOliver. I never realized it as much as I did to-day. Whatever she does,\nyou may be sure it will be because it is right to do it. She sees\neverything so clearly, and her wishes never obscure her judgment.\"\n\n\"It's a pity. She'd make a great mother, wouldn't she? But life doesn't\nseem able to get along without a sacrifice of the fittest.\"\n\nIn the afternoon Mrs. Pendleton came over, but the two women were so\nbusy arranging the furniture in its proper place, and laying away\nOliver's and the children's things in drawers and closets, that not\nuntil the entire house had been put in order, did they find time to sit\ndown for a few minutes in the nursery and discuss the future of Susan.\n\n\"I believe John Henry will want to marry her and go to live at the\nTreadwells', if Susan will let him,\" remarked Mrs. Pendleton.\n\n\"How on earth could he get on with Uncle Cyrus?\" Ever since her marriage\nVirginia had followed Oliver's habit and spoken of Cyrus as \"uncle.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't suppose even John Henry could do that, but perhaps he\nthinks anything would be better than losing Susan.\"\n\n\"And he's right,\" returned Virginia loyally, while she got out her\nwork-bag and began sorting the array of stockings that needed darning.\n\"Do you know, mother, Oliver seems to think that I might go to New York\nwith him.\"\n\n\"And leave the children, Jinny?\"\n\n\"Of course I've told him that I can't, but he's asked me two or three\ntimes to let you look after them for a day or two.\"\n\n\"I'd love to do it, darling--but you've never spent a night away from\none of them since Lucy was born, have you?\"\n\n\"No, and I'd be perfectly miserable--only I can't make Oliver understand\nit. Of course, they'd be just as safe with you as with me, but I'd keep\nimagining every minute that something had happened.\"\n\n\"I know exactly how you feel, dear. I never spent a night outside my\nhome after my first child came until you grew up. I don't see how any\ntrue woman could bear to do it, unless, of course, she was called away\nbecause of a serious illness.\"\n\n\"If Oliver were ill, or you, or father, I'd go in a minute unless one of\nthe children was really sick--but just to see a play is different, and\nI'd feel as if I were neglecting my duty. The funny part is that Oliver\nis so wrapped up in this play that he doesn't seem to be able to get his\nmind off it, poor darling. Father was never that way about his sermons,\nwas he?\"\n\n\"Your father never thought of himself or of his own interests enough,\nJinny. If he ever had a fault, it was that. But I suppose he approaches\nperfection as nearly as a man ever did.\"\n\nSlipping the darning gourd into the toe of one of Lucy's little white\nstockings, Virginia gazed attentively at a small round hole while she\nheld her needle arrested slightly above it. So exquisitely Madonna-like\nwas the poise of her head and the dreaming, prophetic mystery in her\nface, that Mrs. Pendleton waited almost breathlessly for her words.\n\n\"There's not a single thing that I would change in Oliver, if I could,\"\nshe said at last.\n\n\"It is so beautiful that you feel that way, darling. I suppose all\nhappily married women do.\"\n\nA week later, across Harry's birthday cake, which stood surrounded by\nfour candles in the centre of the rectory table, Virginia offered her\ncheerful explanation of Oliver's absence, in reply to a mild inquiry\nfrom the rector. \"He was obliged to go to New York yesterday about the\nrehearsal of 'The Beaten Road,' father. We were both so sorry he\ncouldn't be here to-day, but it was impossible for him to wait over.\"\n\n\"It's a pity,\" said the rector gently. \"Harry will never be just four\nyears old again, will you, little man?\" Even the substantial fact that\nOliver's play would, it was hoped, provide a financial support for his\nchildren, did not suffice to lift it from the region of the unimportant\nin the mind of his father-in-law.\n\n\"But he'll have plenty of other birthdays when papa will be here,\"\nremarked Virginia brightly. Though she had been a little hurt to find\nthat Oliver had arranged to leave home the night before, and that he had\nappeared perfectly blind to the importance of his presence at Harry's\ncelebration, her native good sense had not permitted her to make a\ngrievance out of the matter. On her wedding day she had resolved that\nshe would not be exacting of Oliver's time or attention, and the\nsweetness of her disposition had smoothed away any difficulties which\nhad intervened between her and her ideal of wifehood. From the first,\nlove had meant to her the opportunity of giving rather than the\nprivilege of receiving, and her failure to regard herself as of supreme\nconsequence in any situation had protected her from the minor troubles\nand disillusionments of marriage.\n\n\"It is too bad to think that dear Oliver will have to be away for two\nwhole weeks,\" said Mrs. Pendleton.\n\n\"Is he obliged to stay that long?\" asked the rector, sympathetically.\nNever having missed an anniversary since the war, he could look upon\nOliver's absence as a fit subject for condolence.\n\n\"He can't possibly come home until the play is produced, and that won't\nbe for two weeks yet,\" replied Virginia.\n\n\"But I thought it rested with the actors now. Couldn't they go on just\nas well without him?\"\n\n\"He thinks not, and, of course, it is such a great play that he doesn't\nwant to take any risks with it.\"\n\n\"Of course he doesn't,\" assented Mrs. Pendleton, who had believed that\nthe stage was immoral until Virginia's husband began to write for it.\n\n\"I know he'll come back the very first minute that he can get away,\"\nsaid Virginia with conviction, before she stooped to comfort Harry, who\nwas depressed by the discovery that he was not expected to eat his\nentire cake, but instantly hopeful when he was promised a slice of\nsister Lucy's in the summer.\n\nLate in the afternoon, when the children, warmly wrapped in extra shawls\nby Mrs. Pendleton, were led back through the cold to the house in Prince\nStreet, one and all of the party agreed that it was the nicest birthday\nthat had ever been. \"I like grandma's cake better than our cake,\"\nannounced Harry above his white muffler. \"Why can't we have cake like\nthat, mamma?\"\n\nHe was trotting sturdily, with his hand in Virginia's, behind the\nperambulator, which contained a much muffled Jenny, and at his words\nMrs. Pendleton, who walked a little ahead, turned suddenly and hugged\nhim tight for an instant.\n\n\"Just listen to the darling boy!\" she exclaimed, in a choking voice.\n\n\"Because nobody else can make such good cake as grandma's,\" answered\nVirginia, quite as pleased as her mother. \"And she's going to give you\none every birthday as long as you live.\"\n\n\"Can't I have another birthday soon, mamma?\"\n\n\"Not till after sister Lucy's. You want sister Lucy to have one, don't\nyou? and dear little Jenny?\"\n\n\"But why can't I have a cake without a birthday, mamma?\"\n\n\"You may, precious, and grandma will make you one,\" said Mrs. Pendleton,\nas she helped Marthy wheel the perambulator over the slippery crossing\nand into the front gate.\n\nOn the hall table there was a telegram from Oliver, and Virginia tore it\nopen while her mother and Marthy unfastened the children's wraps.\n\n\"He's at the Hotel Bertram,\" she said joyously, \"and he says the\nrehearsals are going splendidly.\"\n\n\"Did he mention Harry's birthday?\" asked Mrs. Pendleton, trying to hide\nthe instinctive dread which the sight of a telegram aroused in her.\n\n\"He must have forgotten it. Can't you come upstairs to the nursery with\nus, mother?\"\n\n\"No, your father is all alone. I must be getting back,\" replied Mrs.\nPendleton gently.\n\nAn hour or two later, when Virginia sat in her rocking-chair before the\nnursery fire, with Harry, worn out with his play and forgetful of the\ndignity of his four years, asleep in her lap, she opened the telegram\nagain and reread it hungrily while the light of love shone in her face.\nShe knew intuitively that Oliver had sent the telegram because he had\nnot written--and would not write, probably, until he had finished with\nthe hardest work of his play. It was an easy thing to do--it took\nconsiderably less of his time than a letter would have done; but she had\ninherited from her mother the sentimental vision of life which\nunconsciously magnifies the meaning of trivial attentions. She looked\nthrough her emotions as through a prism on the simple fact of his\ntelegraphing, and it became immediately transfigured. How dear it was of\nhim to realize that she would be anxious until she heard from him! How\nlonely he must be all by himself in that great city! How much he must\nhave wanted to be with Harry on his birthday! Sitting there in the\nfire-lit nursery, her heart sent out waves of love and sympathy to him\nacross the distance and the twilight. On the rug at her feet Lucy rocked\nin her little chair, crooning to her doll with the beginnings of the\nmother instinct already softening her voice, and in the adjoining room\nJenny lay asleep in her crib while the faithful Marthy watched by her\nside. Beyond the window a fine icy rain had begun to fall, and down the\nlong street she could see the lamps flickering in revolving circles of\nfrost. In the midst of the frozen streets, that little centre of red\nfirelight separated her as completely from the other twenty-one thousand\nhuman beings among whom she lived as did the glow of personal joy that\nsuffused her thoughts. From the dusk below she heard the tapping of a\nblind beggar's stick on the pavement, and the sound made, while it\nlasted, a plaintive accompaniment to the lullaby she was singing. \"Two\nwhole weeks,\" she thought, while her longing reached out to that unknown\nroom in which she pictured Oliver sitting alone. \"Two whole weeks. How\nhard it will be for him.\" In her guarded ignorance of the world she\ncould not imagine that Oliver was suffering less from this enforced\nabsence from all he loved than she herself would have suffered had she\nbeen in his place. Of course, men were different from women--that\nancient dogma was embodied in the leading clause of her creed of life;\nbut she had always understood that this difference vanished in some\nmiraculous way after marriage. She knew that Oliver had to work, of\ncourse--how otherwise could he support his family?--but the idea that\nhis work might ever usurp the place in his heart that belonged to her\nand the children would have been utterly incomprehensible to her had she\never thought of it. Jealousy was an alien weed, which could not take\nroot in the benign soil of her nature.\n\nFor a week there was no letter from Oliver, and at the end of that time\na few lines scrawled on a sheet of hotel paper explained that he spent\nevery minute of his time at the theatre.\n\n\"Poor fellow, it's dreadfully hard on him, isn't it?\" Virginia said to\nher mother, when she showed her the imposing picture of the hotel at the\nhead of his letter.\n\nThere was no hint of compassion for herself in her voice. Her pity was\nentirely for Oliver, constrained to be away for two whole weeks from his\nchildren, who grew more interesting and delightful every day that they\nlived. \"Harry has gone into the first reader,\" she added, turning from\nthe storeroom shelves on which she was laying strips of white oilcloth.\n\"He will be able to read his lesson to Oliver when he comes home.\"\n\n\"I have always understood that your father could read his Bible at the\nage of four,\" remarked Mrs. Pendleton, who passionately treasured this\nsolitary proof of the rector's brilliancy.\n\n\"I am afraid Harry is backward. He hates his letters--especially the\nletter A--so much that it takes me an hour sometimes to get him to say\nit after me. My only comfort is that Oliver says he couldn't read a line\nuntil he was over seven years old. Would you scallop this oilcloth,\nmother, or leave it plain?\"\n\n\"I always scallop mine. Mrs. Treadwell must be better, Jinny; Susan sent\nme a dessert yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she will never be able to move herself. Do you think that poor\nSusan will marry John Henry now?\"\n\n\"I wonder?\" replied Mrs. Pendleton vaguely. Then the sound of Harry's\nlaughter floated in suddenly from the backyard, and her eyes, following\nVirginia's, turned automatically to the pantry window.\n\n\"They've come home for a snack, I suppose?\" she said. \"Shall I fix some\nbread and preserves for them?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll do it,\" responded Virginia, while she reached for the crock of\nblackberry jam on the shelf at her side.\n\nAnother week passed and there was no word from Oliver, until Mrs.\nPendleton came in at dusk one evening, with an anxious look on her face\nand a folded newspaper held tightly in her hand.\n\n\"Have you seen any of the accounts of Oliver's play, Jinny?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I haven't had time to look at the papers to-day--Harry has hurt his\nfoot.\"\n\nShe spoke placidly, looking up from the nursery floor, where she knelt\nbeside a basin of warm water at Harry's feet. \"Poor little fellow, he\nfell on a pile of bricks,\" she added, \"but he's such a hero he never\neven whimpered, did he, darling?\"\n\n\"But it hurt bad,\" said Harry eagerly.\n\n\"Of course, it hurt dreadfully, and if he hadn't been a man he would\nhave cried.\"\n\n\"Sister would have cried,\" exulted the hero.\n\n\"Indeed, sister would have cried. Sister is a girl,\" responded Virginia,\nsmothering him with kisses over the basin of water.\n\nBut Mrs. Pendleton refused to be diverted from her purpose even by the\nheroism of her grandson.\n\n\"John Henry found this in a New York paper and brought it to me. He\nthought you ought to see it, though, of course, it may not be so\nserious as it sounds.\"\n\n\"Serious?\" repeated Virginia, letting the soapy washrag fall back into\nthe basin while she stretched out her moist and reddened hand for the\npaper.\n\n\"It says that the play didn't go very well,\" pursued her mother\nguardedly. \"They expect to take it off at once, and--and Oliver is not\nwell--he is ill in the hotel----\"\n\n\"Ill?\" cried Virginia, and as she rose to her feet the basin upset and\ndeluged Harry's shoes and the rug on which she had been kneeling. Her\nmind, unable to grasp the significance of a theatrical failure, had\nseized upon the one salient fact which concerned her. Plays might\nsucceed or fail, and it made little difference, but illness was another\nmatter--illness was something definite and material. Illness could\nneither be talked away by religion nor denied by philosophy. It had its\nplace in her mind not with the shadow, but with the substance of things.\nIt was the one sinister force which had always dominated her, even when\nit was absent, by the sheer terror it aroused in her thoughts.\n\n\"Let me see,\" she said chokingly. \"No, I can't read it--tell me.\"\n\n\"It only says that the play was a failure--nobody understood it, and a\ngreat many people said it was--oh, Virginia--_immoral!_--There's\nsomething about its being foreign and an attack on American ideals--and\nthen they add that the author refused to be interviewed and they\nunderstood that he was ill in his room at the Bertram.\"\n\nThe charge of immorality, which would have crushed Virginia at another\ntime, and which, even in the intense excitement of the moment, had been\nan added stab to Mrs. Pendleton, was brushed aside as if it were the\npestiferous attack of an insect.\n\n\"I am going to him now--at once--when does the train leave, mother?\"\n\n\"But, Jinny, how can you? You have never been to New York. You wouldn't\nknow where to go.\"\n\n\"But he is ill. Nothing on earth is going to keep me away from him. Will\nyou please wipe Harry's feet while I try to get on my clothes?\"\n\n\"But, Jinny, the children?\"\n\n\"You and Marthy must look after the children. Of course I can't take\nthem with me. Oh, Harry, won't you please hush and let poor mamma dress?\nShe is almost distracted.\"\n\nSomething--a secret force of character which even her mother had not\nsuspected that she possessed--had arisen in an instant and dominated the\nsituation. She was no longer the gentle and doting mother of a minute\nago, but a creature of a fixed purpose and an iron resolution. Even her\nface appeared to lose its soft contour and hardened until Mrs. Pendleton\ngrew almost frightened. Never had she imagined that Virginia could look\nlike this.\n\n\"I am sure there is some mistake about it. Don't take it so terribly to\nheart, Jinny,\" she pleaded, while she knelt down, cowed and obedient, to\nwipe Harry's feet.\n\nVirginia, who had already torn off her house dress, and was hurriedly\nbuttoning the navy blue waist in which she had travelled, looked at her\ncalmly without pausing for an instant in her task.\n\n\"Will you bind up his foot with some arnica?\" she asked. \"There's an\nold handkerchief in my work basket. I want you and father to come here\nand stay until I get back. It will be less trouble than moving all their\nthings over to the rectory.\"\n\n\"Very well, darling,\" replied Mrs. Pendleton meekly. \"We'll do\neverything that we can, of course,\" and she added timidly, \"Have you\nmoney enough?\"\n\n\"I have thirty dollars. I just got it out of the bank to-day to pay\nMarthy and my housekeeping bills. Do you think that will be as much as\nI'll need?\"\n\n\"I should think so, dear. Of course, if you find you want more, you can\ntelegraph your father.\"\n\n\"The train doesn't leave for two hours, so I'll have plenty of time to\nget ready. It's just half-past six now, and Oliver didn't leave the\nhouse till eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Won't you take a little something to eat before you go?\"\n\n\"I couldn't swallow a morsel, but I'll sit with you and the children as\nsoon as I've put the things in my satchel. I couldn't possibly need but\nthis one dress, could I? If Oliver isn't really ill, I hope we can start\nhome to-morrow. That will be two nights that I'll spend away. Oh,\nmother, ask father to pray that he won't be ill.\"\n\nHer voice broke, but she fiercely bit back the sob before it escaped her\nlips.\n\n\"I will, dear, I promise you. We will both think of you and pray for you\nevery minute. Jinny, are you sure it's wise? Couldn't we send some\none--John Henry would go, I know--in your place?\"\n\nA spasm of irritation contracted Virginia's features. \"Please don't,\nmother,\" she begged, \"it just worries me. Whatever happens, I am\ngoing.\" Then she sobbed outright. \"He wanted me to go with him at first,\nand I wouldn't because I thought it was my duty to stay at home with the\nchildren. If anything should happen to him, I'd never forgive myself.\"\n\nShe was slipping her black cloth skirt over her head as she spoke, and\nher terror-stricken face disappeared under the pleats before Mrs.\nPendleton could turn to look at her. When her head emerged again above\nthe belt of her skirt, the expression of her features had grown more\nnatural.\n\n\"You'll go down in a carriage, won't you?\" inquired her mother, whose\nmind achieved that perfect mixture of the sentimental and the practical\nwhich is rarely found in any except Southern women.\n\n\"I suppose I'll have to. Then I can take my satchel with me, and that\nwill save trouble. You won't forget, mother, that I give Lucy a\nteaspoonful of cod-liver oil after each meal, will you? She has had that\nhacking cough for three weeks, and I want to break it up.\"\n\n\"I'll remember, Jinny, but I'm so miserable about your going alone.\"\n\nTurning to the closet, Virginia unearthed an old black satchel from\nbeneath a pile of toys, and began dusting it inside with a towel. Then\nshe took out some underclothes from a bureau drawer and a few toilet\narticles, which she wrapped in pieces of tissue paper. Her movements\nwere so methodical that the nervousness in Mrs. Pendleton's mind slowly\ngave way to astonishment. For the first time in her life, perhaps, the\nmother realized that her daughter was no longer a child, but a woman,\nand a woman whose character was as strong and as determined as her own.\nVaguely she understood, without analyzing the motives that moved\nVirginia, that this strength and this determination which so impressed\nher had arisen from those deep places in her daughter's soul where\nemotion and not thought had its source. Love was guiding her now as\nsurely as it had guided her when she had refused to go with Oliver to\nNew York, or when, but a few minutes ago, she had knelt down to wash and\nbandage Harry's little earth-stained feet. It was the only power to\nwhich she would ever surrender. No other principle would ever direct or\ncontrol her.\n\nMarthy, who appeared with Jenny's supper, was sent out to order the\ncarriage and to bear a message to the rector, and Virginia took the\nlittle girl in her lap and began to crumble the bread into the bowl of\nmilk.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like me to do that, dear?\" asked Mrs. Pendleton, with a\nsubmission in her tone which she had never used before except to the\nrector. \"Don't you want to fix your hair over?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I'll keep on my hat till I go to bed, so it doesn't matter. I'd\nrather you'd finish my packing if you don't mind. There's nothing more\nto go in except some collars and my bedroom slippers and that red\nwrapper hanging behind the door in the closet.\"\n\n\"Are you going to take any medicine?\"\n\n\"Only that bottle of camphor and some mustard plasters. Yes, you'd\nbetter put in the brandy flask and the aromatic ammonia. You can never\ntell when you will need them. Now, my darlings, mother is going away and\nyou must keep well and be as good as gold until she comes back.\"\n\nTo the amazement of Mrs. Pendleton (who reflected that you really never\nknew what to expect of children), this appeal produced an immediate and\nextraordinary result. Lucy, who had been fidgeting about and trying to\nhelp with the packing, became suddenly solemn and dignified, while an\nennobling excitement mounted to Harry's face. Never particularly\nobedient before, they became, as soon as the words were uttered, as\namenable as angels. Even Jenny stopped feeding long enough to raise\nherself and pat her mother's cheek with ten caressing, milky fingers.\n\n\"Mother's going away,\" said Lucy in a solemn voice, and a hush fell on\nthe three of them.\n\n\"And grandma's coming here to live,\" added Harry after the silence had\ngrown so depressing that Virginia had started to cry.\n\n\"Not to live, precious,\" corrected Mrs. Pendleton quickly. \"Just to\nspend two days with you. Mother will be home in two days.\"\n\n\"Mother will be home in two days,\" repeated Lucy. \"May I stay away from\nschool while you're away, mamma?\"\n\n\"And may I stop learning my letters?\" asked Harry.\n\n\"No, darlings, you must do just as if I were here. Grandma will take\ncare of you. Now promise me that you will be good.\"\n\nThey promised obediently, awed to submission by the stupendous\nimportance of the change. It is probable that they would have observed\nwith less surprise any miraculous upheaval in the orderly phenomena of\nnature.\n\n\"I don't see how I can possibly leave them--they are so good, and they\nbehave exactly as if they realized how anxious I am,\" wept Virginia,\nbreaking down when Marthy came to announce that the rector had come and\nthe carriage was at the door.\n\n\"Suppose you give it up, Jinny. I--I'll send your father,\" pleaded Mrs.\nPendleton, in desperation as she watched the tragedy of the parting.\n\nBut that strange force which the situation had developed in Virginia\nyielded neither to her mother's prayers nor to the last despairing wails\nof the children, who realized, at the sight of the black bag in Marthy's\nhands, that their providence was actually deserting them. The deepest of\nher instincts--the instinct that was at the root of all her mother\nlove--was threatened, and she rose to battle. The thing she loved best,\nshe had learned, was neither husband nor child, but the one that needed\nher.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFAILURE\n\n\nShe had lain down in her clothes, impelled by the feeling that if there\nwere to be a wreck she should prefer to appear completely dressed; so\nwhen the chill dawn came at last and the train pulled into Jersey City,\nshe had nothing to do except to adjust her veil and wait patiently until\nthe porter came for her bag. His colour, which was black, inspired her\nwith confidence, and she followed him trustfully to the platform, where\nhe delivered her to another smiling member of his race. The cold was so\npenetrating that her teeth began to chatter as she turned to obey the\norders of the dusky official who had assumed command of her. Never had\nshe felt anything so bleak as the atmosphere of the station. Never in\nher life had she been so lonely as she was while she hurried down the\nlong dim platform in the direction of a gate which looked as if it led\ninto a prison. She was chilled through; her skin felt as if it had\nturned to india rubber; there was a sickening terror in her soul; and\nshe longed above all things to sit down on one of the inhospitable\ntracks and burst into tears; but something stronger than impulse urged\nher shivering body onward and controlled the twitching muscles about her\nmouth. \"In a few minutes I shall see Oliver. Oliver is ill and I am\ngoing to him,\" she repeated over and over to herself as if she were\nreciting a prayer.\n\nInside the station she declined the offer of breakfast, and was\nconducted to the ferry, where she was obliged to run in order to catch\nthe boat that was just leaving. Seated on one of the long benches in the\nsaloon, with her bag at her feet and her umbrella grasped tightly in her\nhand, she gazed helplessly at the other passengers and wondered if any\none of them would tell her what to do when she reached the opposite\nside. The women, she thought, looked hard and harassed, and the men she\ncould not see because of the rows of newspapers behind which they were\nhidden. Once her wandering gaze caught the eyes of a middle-aged woman\nin rusty black, who smiled at her above the head of a sleeping child.\n\n\"That's a pretty woman,\" said a man carelessly, as he put down his\npaper, and she realized that he was talking about her to his companion.\nThen, as the terrible outlines of the city grew more distinct on the\nhorizon, he got up and strolled as carelessly past her to the deck. He\nhad spoken of her as indifferently as he might have spoken of the\nweather.\n\nAs the tremendous battlements (which were not tremendous to any of the\nother passengers) emerged slowly from the mist and cleft the sombre\nlow-hanging clouds, from which a few flakes of snow fell, her terror\nvanished suddenly before the excitement which ran through her body. She\nforgot her hunger, her loneliness, her shivering flesh, her benumbed and\naching feet. A sensation not unlike the one with which the rector had\nmarched into his first battle, fortified and exhilarated her. The\nfighting blood of of her ancestors grew warm in her veins. New York\ndeveloped suddenly from a mere spot on a map into a romance made into\nbrick; and when a ray of sunlight pierced the heavy fog, and lay like a\nwhite wing aslant the few falling snowflakes, it seemed to her that the\nshadowy buildings lost their sinister aspect and softened into a\nhaunting and mysterious beauty. Somewhere in that place of mystery and\nadventure Oliver was waiting for her! He was a part of that vast\nmovement of life into which she was going. Then, youth, from which hope\nis never long absent, flamed up in her, and she was glad that she was\nstill beautiful enough to cause strangers to turn and look at her.\n\nBut this mood, also, passed quickly, and a little later, while she\nrolled through the grey streets, into which the slant sunbeams could\nbring no colour, she surrendered again to that terror of the unknown\nwhich had seized her when she stood in the station. The beauty had\ndeparted from the buildings; the pavements were dirty; the little\ndiscoloured piles of snow made the crossings slippery and dangerous; and\nshe held her breath as they passed through the crowded streets on the\nwest side, overcome by the fear of \"catching\" some malign malady from\nthe smells and the filth. The negro quarters in Dinwiddie were dirty\nenough, but not, she thought with a kind of triumph, quite so dirty as\nNew York. When the cab turned into Fifth Avenue, she took her\nhandkerchief from her nostrils; but this imposing street, which had not\nyet emerged from its evil dream of Victorian brownstone, impressed her\nchiefly as a place of a thousand prisons. It was impossible to believe\nthat those frowning walls, undecorated by a creeper or the shadow of a\ntree, could really be homes where people lived and children were born.\n\nAt first she had gazed with a childish interest and curiosity on the\nhouses she was passing; then the sense of strangeness gave place\npresently to the exigent necessity of reaching Oliver as soon as\npossible. But the driver appeared indifferent to her timid taps on the\nglass at his back, while the horse progressed with the feeble activity\nof one who had spent a quarter of a century ineffectually making an\neffort. Her impatience, which she had at first kept under control, began\nto run in quivers of nervousness through her limbs. The very richness of\nher personal life, which had condensed all experience into a single\nemotional centre, and restricted her vision of the universe to that\nsolitary window of the soul through which she looked, prevented her now\nfrom seeing in the city anything except the dreary background of\nOliver's illness and failure. The na\u00c3\u00afve wonder with which she had\nwatched the gigantic outlines shape themselves out of the white fog, had\nfaded utterly from her mind. She ached with longing to reach Oliver and\nto find him well enough to take the first train back to Dinwiddie.\n\nAt the hotel her bag and umbrella were wrested from her by an imperious\nuniformed attendant, and in what seemed to her an incredibly short space\nof time, she was following him along a velvet lined corridor on the\ntenth floor. The swift ascent in the elevator had made her dizzy, and\nthe physical sensation reminded her that she was weak for food. Then the\nattendant rapped imperatively at a door just beyond a shining staircase,\nand she forgot herself as completely as it had been her habit to do\nsince her marriage.\n\n\"Come in!\" responded a muffled voice on the inside, and as the door\nswung open, she saw Oliver, in his dressing-gown, and with an unshaved\nface, reading a newspaper beside a table on which stood an untasted cup\nof coffee.\n\n\"I didn't ring,\" he began impatiently, and then starting to his feet, he\nuttered her name in a voice which held her standing as if she were\nsuddenly paralyzed on the threshold. \"Virginia!\"\n\nA sob rose in her throat, and her faltering gaze passed from him to the\nhotel attendant, who responded to her unspoken appeal as readily as if\nit were a part of his regular business. Pushing her gently inside, he\nplaced her bag and umbrella on an empty chair, took up the breakfast\ntray from the table, and inquired, with a kindness which strangely\nhumbled her, if she wished to give an order. When she had helplessly\nshaken her head, he bowed and went out, closing the door softly upon\ntheir meeting.\n\n\"What in thunder, Virginia?\" began Oliver, and she realized that he was\nangry.\n\n\"I heard you were sick--that the play had failed. I was so sorry I\nhadn't come with you--\" she explained; and then, understanding for the\nfirst time the utter foolishness of what she had done, she put her hands\nup to her face and burst into tears.\n\nHe had risen from his chair, but he made no movement to come nearer to\nher, and when she took down her hands in order to wipe her eyes, she saw\nan expression in his face which frightened her by its strangeness. She\nhad caught him when that guard which every human being--even a\nhusband--wears, had fallen away, though in her ignorance it seemed to\nher that he had become suddenly another person. That she had entered\ninto one of those awful hours of self-realization, when the soul must\nface its limitations alone and make its readjustments in silence, did\nnot occur to her, because she, who had lived every minute of her life\nunder the eyes of her parents or her children, could have no\ncomprehension of the hunger for solitude which was devouring Oliver's\nheart. She saw merely that he did not want her--that she had not only\nstartled, but angered him by coming; and the bitterness of that instant\nseemed to her more than she was able to bear. Something had changed him;\nhe was older, he was harder, he was embittered.\n\n\"I--I am so sorry,\" she stammered; and because even in the agony of this\nmoment she could not think long of herself, she added almost humbly,\n\"Would you rather that I should go back again?\" Then, by the haggard\nlook of his face as he turned away from her towards the window, she saw\nthat he, also, was suffering, and her soul yearned over him as it had\nyearned over Harry when he had had the toothache. \"Oh, Oliver!\" she\ncried, and again, \"Oh, Oliver, won't you let me help you?\"\n\nBut he was in the mood of despairing humiliation when one may support\nabuse better than pity. His failure, he knew, had been undeserved, and\nhe was still smarting from the injustice of it as from the blows of a\nwhip. For twenty-four hours his nerves had been on the rack, and his one\ndesire had been to hide himself in the spiritual nakedness to which he\nwas stripped. Had he been obliged to choose a witness to his suffering,\nit is probable that he would have selected a stranger from the street\nrather than his wife. The one thing that could have helped him, an\nintelligent justification of his work, she was powerless to give. In his\nneed she had nothing except love to offer; and love, she felt\ninstinctively, was not the balm for his wound.\n\nAfraid and yet passionately longing to meet his eyes, she let her gaze\nfall away from him and wander timidly, as if uncertain where to rest,\nabout the disordered room, with its dull red walls, its cheap Nottingham\nlace curtains tied back with cords, its elaborately carved walnut\nfurniture, and its litter of days old newspapers upon the bed. She saw\nhis neckties hanging in an uneven row over the oblong mirror, and she\ncontrolled a nervous impulse to straighten them out and put them away.\n\n\"Why didn't you telegraph me?\" he asked, after a pause in which she had\nstruggled vainly to look as if it were the most natural thing in the\nworld that he should receive her in this way. \"If I had known you were\ncoming, I should have met you.\"\n\n\"Father wanted to, but I wouldn't let him,\" she answered. \"I--I thought\nyou were sick.\"\n\nIn spite of his despair, it is probable that at the moment she was\nsuffering more than he was--since a wound to love strikes deeper, after\nall, than a wound to ambition. Where she had expected to find her\nhusband, she felt vaguely that she had encountered a stranger, and she\nwas overwhelmed by that sense of irremediable loss which follows the\ndiscovery of terrible and unfamiliar qualities in those whom we have\nknown and loved intimately for years. The fact that he was plainly\nstruggling to disguise his annoyance, that he was trying as hard as she\nto assume a manner he did not feel, only added a sardonic humour to\npoignant tragedy.\n\n\"Have you had anything to eat?\" he asked abruptly, and remembering that\nhe had not kissed her when she entered, he put his arm about her and\nbrushed her cheek with his lips.\n\n\"No, I waited to breakfast with you. I was in such a hurry to get here.\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, and going over to the bell, he touched it with\nthe manner of a man who is delighted that anything so perfectly\npractical as food exists in the world.\n\nWhile he was speaking to the waiter, she took off her hat, and washed\nthe stains of smoke and tears from her face. Her hair was a sight, she\nthought, but while she gazed back at her stricken eyes in the little\nmirror over the washstand, she recalled with a throb of gratitude that\nthe stranger on the boat had said she was pretty. She felt so humble\nthat she clung almost with desperation to the thought that Oliver always\nliked to have people admire her.\n\nWhen she turned from the washstand, he was reading the newspaper again,\nand he put it aside with a forced cheerfulness to arrange the table for\nbreakfast.\n\n\"Aren't you going to have something too?\" she asked, looking\ndisconsolately at the tray, for all her hunger had departed. If he would\nonly be natural she felt that she could bear anything! If he would only\nstop trying to pretend that he was not miserable and that nothing had\nhappened! After all, it couldn't be so very bad, could it? It wasn't in\nthe least as if one of the children were ill.\n\nShe poured out a cup of coffee for him before drinking her own, and\nputting it down on the table at his side, waited patiently until he\nshould look up again from his paper. A lump as hard as lead had risen\nin her throat and was choking her.\n\n\"Are the children well?\" he asked presently, and she answered with an\naffected brightness more harrowing than tears, \"Yes, mother is taking\ncare of them. Lucy still has the little cough, but I'm giving her\ncod-liver oil. And, what do you think? I have a surprise for you. Harry\ncan read the first lesson in his reader.\"\n\nHe smiled kindly back at her, but from the vacancy in his face, she\nrealized that he had not taken in a word that she had said. His trouble,\nwhatever it was, could absorb him so utterly that he had ceased even to\nbe interested in his children. He, who had borne so calmly the loss of\nthat day-old baby for whom she had grieved herself to a shadow, was\nplunged into this condition of abject hopelessness merely because his\nplay was a failure! It was not only impossible for her to share his\nsuffering; she realized, while she watched him, that she could not so\nmuch as comprehend it. Her limitations, of which she had never been\nacutely conscious until to-day, appeared suddenly insurmountable. Love,\nwhich had seemed to her to solve all problems and to smooth all\ndifficulties, was helpless to enlighten her. It was not love--it was\nsomething else that she needed now, and of this something else she knew\nnot even so much as the name.\n\nShe drank her coffee quickly, fearing that if she did not take food she\nshould lose control of herself and anger him by a display of hysterics.\n\n\"I don't wonder you couldn't drink your coffee,\" she said with a\nquivering little laugh. \"It must have been made yesterday.\" Then, unable\nto bear the strain any longer, she cried out sharply: \"Oh, Oliver,\nwon't you tell me what is the matter?\"\n\nHis look grew hard, while a spasm of irritation contracted his mouth.\n\n\"There's nothing you need worry about--except that I've borrowed money,\nand I'm afraid we'll have to cut down things a bit until I manage to pay\nit back.\"\n\n\"Why, of course we'll cut down things,\" she almost laughed in her\nrelief. \"We can live on a great deal less, and I'll market so carefully\nthat you will hardly know the difference. I'll put Marthy in the kitchen\nand take care of the children myself. It won't be the least bit of\ntrouble.\"\n\nShe knew by his face that he was grateful to her, though he said merely:\n\"I'm a little knocked up, I suppose, so you mustn't mind. I've got a\nbeast of a headache. Martin is going to take 'The Beaten Road' off at\nthe end of the week, you know, and he doesn't think now that he will\nproduce the other. There wasn't a good word for me from the critics, and\nyet, damn them, I know that the play is the best one that's ever come\nout of America. But it's real--that's why they fell foul of it--it isn't\nstuffed with sugar plums.\"\n\n\"Why, what in the world possessed them?\" she returned indignantly. \"It\nis a beautiful play.\"\n\nShe saw him flinch at the word, and the sombre irritation which his\noutburst had relieved for a minute, settled again on his features. Her\npraise, she understood, only exasperated him, though she did not realize\nthat it was the lack of discrimination in it which aroused his\nirritation. At the moment, intelligent appreciation of his work would\nhave been bread and meat to him, but her pitiful attempts at flattery\nwere like bungling touches on raw flesh. Had he written the veriest rags\nof sentimental rubbish, he knew she would as passionately have defended\ntheir \"beauty.\"\n\n\"I'll get dressed quickly and look after some business,\" he said, \"and\nwe'll go home to-night.\"\n\nHer eyes shone, and she began to eat her eggs with a resolution born of\nthe consoling memory of Dinwiddie. If only they could be at home again\nwith the children, she felt that all this trouble and misunderstanding\nwould vanish. With a strange confusion of ideas, it seemed to her that\nOliver's suffering had been in some mysterious way produced by New York,\nand that it existed merely within the circumscribed limits of this\ndreadful city.\n\n\"Oh, Oliver, that will be lovely!\" she exclaimed, and tried to subdue\nthe note of joy in her voice.\n\n\"I shan't be able to get back to lunch, I'm afraid. What will you do\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Don't bother about me, dearest. I'll dress and take a little walk just\nto see what Fifth Avenue is like. I can't get lost if I go perfectly\nstraight up the street, can I?\"\n\n\"Fifth Avenue is only a block away. You can't miss it. Now I'll hurry\nand be off.\"\n\nShe knew that he was anxious to be alone, and so firmly was she\nconvinced that this mood of detachment would leave him as soon as he was\nin the midst of his family again, that she was able to smile tolerantly\nwhen he kissed her hastily, and seizing his hat, rushed from the room.\nFor a time after he had gone she amused herself putting his things in\norder and packing the little tin trunk he had brought with him; but the\nred walls and the steam heat in the room sickened her at last, and when\nshe had bathed and dressed and there seemed nothing left for her to do\nexcept get out her work-bag and begin darning his socks, she decided\nthat she would put on her hat and go out for a walk. It did not occur to\nher to feel hurt by the casual manner in which Oliver had shifted the\nresponsibility of her presence--partly owing to a personal inability to\ntake a selfish point of view about anything, and partly because of that\nracial habit of making allowances for the male in which she had been\nsedulously trained from her infancy.\n\nAt the door the porter directed her to Fifth Avenue, and she ventured\ncautiously as far as the flowing rivulet at the corner, where she would\nprobably have stood until Oliver's return, if a friendly policeman had\nnot observed her stranded helplessness and assisted her over. \"How on\nearth am I to get back again?\" she thought, smiling up at him; and this\nanxiety engrossed her so completely that for a minute she forgot to look\nat the amazing buildings and the curious crowds that hurried frantically\nin their shadows. Then a pale finger of sunlight pointed suddenly across\nthe high roofs in front of her, and awed, in spite of her preoccupation,\nby the strangeness of the scene, she stopped and watched the moving\ncarriages in the middle of the street and the never ending stream of\npeople that passed on the wet pavements. Occasionally, while she stood\nthere, some of the passers-by would turn and look at her with friendly\nadmiring eyes, as though they found something pleasant in her lovely\nwistful face and her old-fashioned clothes; and this pleased her so much\nthat she lost her feeling of loneliness. It was a kindly crowd, and\nbecause she was young and pretty and worth looking at, a part of the\nexhilaration of this unknown life passed into her, and she felt for a\nlittle while as though she belonged to it. The youth in her responded to\nthe passing call of the streets, to this call which fluted like the\nsound of pipes in her blood, and lifted her for a moment out of the\nnarrow track of individual experience. It was charming to feel that all\nthese strangers looked kindly upon her, and she tried to show that she\nreturned their interest by letting a little cordial light shine in her\neyes. For the first time in her life the personal boundaries of sympathy\nfell away from her, and she realized, in a fleeting sensation, something\nof the vast underlying solidarity of human existence. A humble baby in a\ngo-cart waited at one of the crossings for the traffic to pass, and\nbending over, she hugged him ecstatically, not because he reminded her\nof Harry, but simply because he was a baby.\n\n\"He is so sweet I just had to squeeze him,\" she said to his mother, a\nworking woman in a black shawl, who stood behind him.\n\nThen the two women smiled at each other in that freemasonry of\nmotherhood of which no man is aware, and Virginia wondered why people\nhad ever foolishly written of the \"indifference of a crowd.\" The chill\nwhich had lain over her heart since her meeting with Oliver melted\nutterly in the glow with which she had embraced the baby at the\ncrossing. With the feeling of his warm little body in her arms,\neverything had become suddenly right again. New York was no longer a\ndreadful city, and Oliver's failure appeared as brief as the passing\npang of a toothache. Her natural optimism had returned like a rosy mist\nto embellish and obscure the prosaic details of the situation. Like the\ncheerful winter sunshine, which transfigured the harsh outlines of the\nhouses, her vision adorned the reality in the mere act of beholding it.\n\nMidway of the next block there was a jeweller's window full of gems set\nin intricate patterns, and stopping before it, she studied the trinkets\ncarefully in the hope of being able to describe them to Lucy. Then a man\nselling little automatic pigs at the corner attracted her attention, and\nshe bought two for Harry and Jenny, and carried them triumphantly away\nin boxes under her arm. She knew that she looked countrified and\nold-fashioned, and that nobody she met was wearing either a hat or a\ndress which in the least resembled the style of hers; but the knowledge\nof this did not trouble her, because in her heart she preferred the kind\nof clothes which were worn in Dinwiddie. The women in New York seemed to\nher artificial and affected in appearance, and they walked, she thought,\nas if they were trying to make people look at them. The bold way they\nlaced in their figures she regarded as almost indecent, and she noticed\nthat they looked straight into the eyes of men instead of lowering their\nlashes when they passed them. Her provincialism, like everything else\nwhich belonged to her and had become endeared by habit and association,\nseemed to her so truly beautiful and desirable that she would not have\nparted with it for worlds.\n\nTurning presently, she walked down Fifth Avenue as far as Twenty-third\nStreet, and then, confused by the crossing, she passed into Broadway,\nwithout knowing that it was Broadway, until she was enlightened by a\nstranger to whom she appealed. When she began to retrace her steps, she\ndiscovered that she was hungry, and she longed to go into one of the\nplaces where she saw people eating at little tables; but her terror of\nwhat she had heard of the high prices of food in New York restaurants\nrestrained her. General Goode still told of paying six dollars and a\nhalf for a dinner he had ordered in a hotel in Fifth Avenue, and her\ntemperamental frugality, reinforced by anxiety as to Oliver's debts,\npreferred to take no unnecessary risks with the small amount in her\npocket book. Oliver, of course, would have laughed at her petty\neconomies, and have ordered recklessly whatever attracted his appetite;\nbut, as she gently reminded herself again, men were different. On the\nwhole, this lordly prodigality pleased her rather than otherwise. She\nfelt that it was in keeping with the bigness and the virility of the\nmasculine ideal; and if there were pinching and scraping to be done, she\nimmeasurably preferred that it should fall to her lot to do it and not\nto Oliver's.\n\nAt the hotel she found that Oliver had not come in, and after a belated\nluncheon of tea and toast in the dining-room, she went upstairs and sat\ndown to watch for his return between the Nottingham lace curtains at the\nwindow. From the terrific height, on which she felt like a sparrow, she\ncould see a row of miniature puppets passing back and forth at the\ncorner of Fifth Avenue. For hours she tried in vain to distinguish the\nfigure of Oliver in the swiftly moving throng, and in spite of herself\nshe could not repress a feeling of pleasant excitement. She knew that\nOliver would think that she ought to be depressed by his failure, yet\nshe could not prevent the return of a child-like confidence in the\nprofound goodness of life. Everything would be right, everything was\neternally bound to be right from the beginning. That inherited casuistry\nof temperament, which had confused the pleasant with the true for\ngenerations, had become in her less a moral conviction than a fixed\nquality of soul. To dwell even for a minute on \"the dark side of things\"\nawoke in her the same instinct of mortal sin that she had felt at the\ndiscovery that Oliver was accustomed to \"break\" the Sabbath by reading\nprofane literature.\n\nWhen, at last, as the dusk fell in the room, she heard his hasty step in\nthe corridor, a wave of joyful expectancy rose in her heart and trembled\nfor utterance on her lips. Then the door opened; he came from the gloom\ninto the pale gleam of light that shone in from the window, and with her\nfirst look into his face her rising joy ebbed quickly away. A new\nelement, something for which neither her training nor her experience had\nprepared her, entered at that instant into her life. Not the external\nworld, but the sacred inner circle in which they had loved and known\neach other was suddenly clouded. Everything outside of this was the\nsame, but the fact confronted her there as grimly as a physical sore.\nThe evil struck at the very heart of her love, since it was not life,\nbut Oliver that had changed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE SHADOW\n\n\nOliver had changed; for months this thought had lain like a stone on her\nheart. She went about her life just as usual, yet never for an instant\nduring that long winter and spring did she lose consciousness of its\ndreadful presence. It was the first thing to face her in the morning,\nthe last thing from which she turned when, worn out with perplexity, she\nfell asleep at night. During the day the children took her thoughts away\nfrom it for hours, but never once, not even while she heard Harry's\nlessons or tied the pink or the blue bows in Lucy's and Jenny's curls,\ndid she ever really forget it. Since the failure of Oliver's play, which\nhad seemed to her such a little thing in itself, something had gone out\nof their marriage, and this something was the perfect understanding\nwhich had existed between them. There were times when her sympathy\nappeared to her almost to infuriate him. Even her efforts towards\neconomy--for since their return from New York she had put Marthy into\nthe kitchen and had taken entire charge of the children--irritated\nrather than pleased him. And the more she irritated him, the more she\nsought zealously, by innumerable small attentions, to please and to\npacify him. Instead of leaving him in the solitude which he sought, and\nwhich might have restored him to his normal balance of mind, she became\npossessed, whenever he shut himself in his study or went alone for a\nwalk, with a frenzied dread lest he should permit himself to \"brood\"\nover the financial difficulties in which the wreck of his ambition had\nplaced them. She, who feared loneliness as if it were the smallpox,\ndevised a thousand innocent deceptions by which she might break in upon\nhim when he sat in his study and discover whether he was actually\nreading the papers or merely pretending to do so. In her natural\nsimplicity, it never occurred to her to penetrate beneath the surface\ndisturbances of his mood. These engrossed her so completely that the\ncause of them was almost forgotten. Dimly she realized that this\nstrange, almost physical soreness, which made him shrink from her\npresence as a man with weak eyes shrinks from the light, was the outward\nsign of a secret violence in his soul, yet she ministered helplessly to\neach passing explosion of temper as if it were the cause instead of the\nresult of his suffering. Introspection, which had lain under a moral ban\nin a society that assumed the existence of an unholy alliance between\nthe secret and the evil, could not help her because she had never\nindulged in it. Partly because of the ingenuous candour of the Pendleton\nnature, and partly owing to the mildness of a climate which made it more\ncomfortable for Dinwiddians to live for six months of the year on their\nfront porches and with their windows open, she shared the ingrained\nSouthern distrust of any state of mind which could not cheerfully\nsupport the observation of the neighbours. She knew that he had turned\nfrom his work with disgust, and if he wasn't working and wasn't reading,\nwhat on earth could he be doing alone unless he had, as she imagined in\ndesperation, begun wilfully to \"nurse his despondency?\" Even the rector\ncouldn't help her here--for his knowledge of character was strictly\nlimited to the types of the soldier and the churchman, and his\nson-in-law did not belong, he admitted, in either of these familiar\nclassifications. At the bottom of his soul the good man had always\nentertained for Oliver something of the kindly contempt with which his\ngeneration regarded a healthy male, who, it suspected, would decline\neither to preach a sermon or to kill a man in the cause of morality. But\non one line of treatment father and daughter were passionately\nagreed--whatever happened, it was not good that Oliver should be left by\nhimself for a minute. When he was in the bank, of course, where Cyrus\nhad found him a place as a clerk on an insignificant salary, it might be\nsafely assumed that he was cheered by the unfailing company of his\nfellow-workers; but when he came home, the responsibility of his\ndistraction and his cure rested upon Virginia and the children. And\nsince her opinion of her own power to entertain was modest, she fell\nback with a sublime confidence on the unrivalled brilliancy and the\ninfinite variety of the children's prattle. During the spring, as he\ngrew more and more indifferent and depressed, she arranged that the\nchildren should be with him every instant while he was in the house. She\nbrought Jenny's high chair to the table in order that the adorable\ninfant might breakfast with her father; she kept Harry up an hour later\nat night so that he might add the gaiety of his innocent mirth to their\notherwise long and silent evenings. Though she would have given anything\nto drop into bed as soon as the babies were undressed, she forced\nherself to sit up without yawning until Oliver turned out the lights,\nbolted the door, and remarked irritably that she ought to have been\nasleep hours ago.\n\n\"You aren't used to sitting up so late, Virginia; it makes you dark\nunder the eyes,\" he said one June night as he came in from the porch\nwhere he had been to look up at the stars.\n\n\"But I can't go to bed until you do, darling. I get so worried about\nyou,\" she answered.\n\n\"Why in heaven's name, should you worry about me? I am all right,\" he\nresponded crossly.\n\nShe saw her mistake, and with her unvarying sweetness, set out to\nrectify it.\n\n\"Of course, I know you are--but we have so little time together that I\ndon't want to miss the evenings.\"\n\n\"So little!\" he echoed, not unkindly, but in simple astonishment.\n\n\"I mean the children sit up late now, and of course we can't talk while\nthey are playing in the room.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you might get them to bed earlier? They are becoming\nrather a nuisance, aren't they?\"\n\nHe said it kindly enough, yet tears rushed to her eyes as she looked at\nhim. It was impossible for her to conceive of any mood in which the\nchildren would become \"rather a nuisance\" to her, and the words hurt her\nmore than he was ever to know. It seemed the last straw that she could\nnot bear, said her heart as she turned away from him. She had borne the\nextra work without a complaint; she had pinched and scraped, if not\nhappily, at least with a smile; she had sat up while her limbs ached\nwith fatigue and the longing to be in bed--and all these things were as\nnothing to the tragic confession that the children had become \"rather a\nnuisance.\" Of the many trials she had had to endure, this, she told\nherself, was the bitterest.\n\nThough her feet burned and her muscles throbbed with fatigue, she lay\nawake for hours, with her eyes wide open in the moonlight. All the small\nharassing duties of the morrow, which usually swarmed like startled bees\nthrough her brain at night, were scattered now by this vague terror\nwhich assumed no definite shape. The delicacy of Lucy's chest, Harry's\nstubborn refusal to learn to spell, and even the harrowing certainty\nthat the children's appetites were fast outstripping the frugal fare she\nprovided--these stinging worries had flown before a new anxiety which\nwas the more poignant, she felt, because she could not give it a name.\nThe Pendleton idealism was powerless to dispel this malign shadow which\ncorresponded so closely to that substance of evil whose very existence\nthe Pendleton idealism eternally denied. To battle with a delusion was\nvirtually to admit one's belief in its actuality, and this, she\nreflected passionately, lying awake there in the darkness, was the last\nthing she was prepared at the moment to do. Oliver was changed, and yet\nher duty was plainly to fortify herself with the consoling assurance\nthat, whatever happened, Oliver could never really change. Deep down in\nher that essential fibre of her being which was her soul--which drew its\nvitality from the racial structure of which it was a part, and yet which\ndistinguished and separated her from every other person and object in\nthe universe--this essential fibre was compacted of innumerable\nPendleton refusals to face the reality. Even with Lucy's chest and\nHarry's lessons and the cost of food, she had always felt a soothing\nconviction that by thinking hard enough about them she could make them\nevery one come out right in the morning. As a normal human being in a\nworld which was not planned on altruistic principles, it was out of the\nquestion that she should entirely escape an occasional hour of\ndespondency; but with the narrow outlook of women who lead intense\npersonal lives, it would have been impossible for her to see anything\nreally wrong in the universe while Oliver and all the children were\nwell. God was in His heaven as long as the affairs of her household\nworked together for good. \"It can't be that he is different--I must have\nimagined it,\" she thought now, breathing softly lest she should disturb\nthe sleeping Oliver. \"It is natural that he should be worried about his\ndebts, and the failure of the play went very hard with him, of\ncourse--but if he appears at times to have grown bitter, it must be only\nthat I have come to exact too much of him. I oughtn't to expect him to\ntake the same interest in the children that I do----\"\n\nThen, rising softly on her elbow, she smoothed the sheet over Jenny's\ndimpled little body, and bent her ear downward to make sure that the\nchild was breathing naturally in her sleep. In spite of her depression\nthat rosy face framed in hair like spun yellow silk, aroused in her a\nfeeling of ecstasy. Whenever she looked at one of her children--at her\nyoungest child especially--her maternal passion seemed to turn to flame\nin her blood. Even first love had not been so exquisitely satisfying, so\ninterwoven of all imaginable secret meanings of bliss. Jenny's thumb was\nin her mouth, and removing it gently, Virginia bent lower and laid her\nhot cheek on the soft shining curls. Some vital power, an emanation\nfrom that single principle of Love which ruled her life, passed from the\nbreath of the sleeping child into her body. Peace descended upon her,\nswift and merciful like sleep, and turning on her side, she lay with her\nhand on Jenny's crib, as though in clinging to her child she clung to\nall that was most worth while in the universe.\n\nThe next night Oliver telephoned from the Treadwells' that he would not\nbe home to supper, and when he came in at eleven o'clock, he appeared\nannoyed to find her sitting up for him.\n\n\"You ought to have gone to bed, Virginia. You look positively haggard,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I wasn't sleepy. Mother came in for a few minutes, and we put the\nchildren to bed. Jenny wanted to say good-night to you, and she cried\nwhen I told her you had gone out. I believe she loves you better than\nshe does anybody in the world, Oliver.\"\n\nHe smiled with something of the casual brilliancy which had first\ncaptivated her imagination. In spite of the melancholy which had clouded\nhis charm of late, he had lost neither his glow of physical well-being\nnor the look of abounding intellectual energy which distinguished him\nfrom all other men whom she knew. It was this intellectual energy, she\nsometimes thought, which purified his character of that vein of\nearthiness which she had looked upon as the natural, and therefore the\npardonable, attribute of masculine human nature.\n\n\"If she keeps her looks, she'll leave her mother behind some day,\" he\nanswered. \"You need a new dress, Jinny. I hate that old waist and skirt.\nWhy don't you wear the swishy blue silk I always liked on you?\"\n\n\"I made it over for Lucy, dear. She had to have a dress to wear to Lily\nCarrington's birthday party, and I didn't want to buy one. It looks ever\nso nice on her.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, but I like it better on you.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter what I wear, but Lucy is so fond of pretty things,\nand children dress more now than they used to do. What did Susan have to\nsay?\"\n\nHe had turned to bolt the front door, and while his back was towards\nher, she raised her hand to smother a yawn. All day she had been on her\nfeet, except for the two hours when she had worked at her\nsewing-machine, while Harry and Jenny were taking their morning nap. She\nhad not had time to change her dress until after supper, and she had\nfelt so tired then that it had not seemed worth while to do so. There\nwas, in fact, nothing to change to, since she had made over the blue\nsilk, except an old black organdie, cut square in the neck, which she\nhad worn in the months before Jenny's birth. As a girl she had loved\npretty clothes; but there were so many other things to think about now,\nand from the day that her first child had come to her it had seemed to\nmatter less and less what she wore or how she appeared. Nothing had\nreally counted in life except the supreme privilege of giving herself,\nbody and soul, in the service of love. All that she was--all that she\nhad--belonged to Oliver and to his children, so what difference could it\nmake to them, since she gave herself so completely, whether she wore new\nclothes or old?\n\nWhen he turned to her, she had smothered the yawn, and was smiling. \"Is\nAunt Belinda just the same?\" she asked, for he had not answered her\nquestion about Susan.\n\n\"To tell the truth, I forgot to ask,\" he replied, with a laugh. \"Susan\nseemed very cheerful, and John Henry was there, of course. It wouldn't\nsurprise me to hear any day that they are to be married. By the way,\nVirginia, why did you never tell me what a good rider you are? Abby\nGoode says you would have been a better horsewoman than she is if you\nhadn't given up riding.\"\n\n\"Why, I haven't been in the saddle for years. I stopped when we had to\nsell my horse Bess, and that was before you came back to Dinwiddie. How\ndid Abby happen to be there?\"\n\n\"She stopped to see Susan about something, and then we got to\ntalking--the bunch of us. John Henry asked me to exercise his horse for\nhim when he doesn't go. I rather hope I'll get a chance to go\nfox-hunting in the autumn. Abby was talking about it.\"\n\n\"Has she changed much? I haven't seen her for years. She is hardly ever\nin Dinwiddie.\"\n\n\"Well, she's fatter, but it's becoming to her. It makes her look softer.\nShe's a bit coarse, but she tells a capital story. I always liked Abby.\"\n\n\"Yes, I always liked Abby, too,\" answered Virginia, and it was on the\ntip of her tongue to add that Abby had always liked Oliver. \"If he\nhadn't seen me, perhaps he might have married her,\" she thought, and the\nremote possibility of such bliss for poor defrauded Abby filled her with\nan incredible tenderness. She would never have believed that bouncing,\nboisterous Abby Goode could have aroused in her so poignant a sympathy.\n\nHe appeared so much more cheerful than she had seen him since his\ndisastrous trip to New York, that, moved by an unselfish impulse of\ngratitude towards the cause of it, she put out her hand to him, while he\nraised his arm to extinguish the light.\n\n\"I am so glad about the horse, dear,\" she said. \"It will be nice for you\nto go sometimes with Abby.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you come too, Jinny?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't have time--and, besides, I gave it up long ago. I don't\nthink a mother has any business on horseback.\"\n\n\"All the same I wish you wouldn't let yourself go to pieces. What have\nyou done to your hands? They used to be so pretty.\"\n\nShe drew them hastily away, while the tears rose in a mist to her eyes.\nIt was like a man--it was especially like Oliver--to imagine that she\ncould clean up half a house and take charge of three children, yet keep\nher hands as white and soft as they had been when she was a girl and did\nnothing except wait for a lover. In a flash of memory, she saw the\nreddened and knotted hands of her mother, and then a procession of hands\nbelonging to all the mothers of her race that had gone before her. Were\nher own but a single pair in that chain of pathetic hands that had\nworked in the exacting service of Love?\n\n\"It is so hard to keep them nice,\" she said; but her heart cried, \"What\ndo my hands matter when it is for your sake that I have spoiled them?\"\nWith her natural tendency to undervalue the physical pleasures of life,\nshe had looked upon her beauty as a passing bloom which would attract\nher lover to the veiled wonders of her spirit. Fleshly beauty as an end\nin itself would have appeared to her as immoral a cult as the wilful\npursuit of a wandering desire in the male.\n\n\"I never noticed until to-night what pretty hands Abby has,\" he said,\ninnocently enough, as he turned off the gas.\n\nA strange sensation--something which was so different from anything she\nhad ever felt before that she could not give it a name--pierced her\nheart like an arrow. Then it fled as suddenly as it had come, and left\nher at ease with the thought: \"Abby has had nothing to hurt her hands.\nWhy shouldn't they be pretty?\" But not for Abby's hands would she have\ngiven up a single hour when she had washed Jenny's little flannels or\ndug enchanted garden beds with Harry's miniature trowel.\n\n\"She used to have a beautiful figure,\" she said with perfect sincerity.\n\n\"Well, she's got it still, though she's a trifle too large for my taste.\nYou can't help liking her--she's such jolly good company, but, somehow,\nshe doesn't seem womanly. She's too fond of sport and all that sort of\nthing.\"\n\nHis ideal woman still corresponded to the type which he had chosen for\nhis mate; for true womanliness was inseparably associated in his mind\nwith those qualities which had awakened for generations the impulse of\nsexual selection in the men of his race. Though he enjoyed Abby, he\nrefused stubbornly to admire her, since evolution, which moves rapidly\nin the development of the social activities, had left his imagination\nstill sacredly cherishing the convention of the jungle in the matter of\nsex. He saw woman as dependent upon man for the very integrity of her\nbeing, and beyond the divine fact of this dependency, he did not see her\nat all. But there was nothing sardonic in his point of view, which had\nbecome considerably strengthened by his marriage to Virginia, who shared\nit. It was one of those mental attitudes, indeed, which, in the days of\nloose thinking and of hazy generalizations, might have proved its divine\ndescent by its universality. Oliver, his Uncle Cyrus, the rector, and\nhonest John Henry, however they may have differed in their views of the\nuniverse or of each other, were one at least in accepting the historical\ndogma of the supplementary being of woman.\n\nAnd yet, so strange is life, so inexplicable are its contradictions,\nthere were times when Oliver's ideal appeared almost to betray him, and\nthe intellectual limitations of Virginia bored rather than delighted\nhim. Habit, which is a sedative to a phlegmatic nature, acts not\ninfrequently as a positive irritant upon the temperament of the artist;\nand since he had turned from his work in a passion of disgust at the\ndramatic obtuseness of his generation, he had felt more than ever the\nneed of some intellectual outlet for the torrent of his imagination. As\na wife, Virginia was perfect; as a mental companion, she barely existed\nat all. She was, he had come to recognize, profoundly indifferent to the\nactual world. Her universe was a fiction except the part of it that\nconcerned him or the children. He had never forgotten that he had read\nhis play to her one night shortly after Jenny's birth, and she had\nleaned forward with her chin on her palm and a look in her face as if\nshe were listening for a cry which never came from the nursery. Her\npraise had had the sound of being recited by rote, and had aroused in\nhim a sense of exasperation which returned even now whenever she\nmentioned his work. In the days of his courtship the memory of her\nsimplicities clung like an exquisite bouquet to the intoxicating image\nof her; but in eight years of daily intimacy the flavour and the\nperfume of mere innocence had evaporated. The quality which had first\ncharmed him was, perhaps, the first of which he had grown weary. He\nstill loved Virginia, but he had ceased to talk to her. \"If you go into\nthe refrigerator, Oliver, don't upset Jenny's bottle of milk,\" she said,\nlooking after him as he turned towards the dining-room.\n\nHer foot was already on the bottom step of the staircase, for she had\nheard, or imagined that she had heard, a sound from the nursery, and she\nwas impatient to see if one of the children had awakened and got out of\nbed. All the evening, while she had changed the skin-tight sleeves of\nthe eighties to the balloon ones of the nineties in an old waist which\nshe had had before her marriage and had never worn because it was\nunbecoming, her thoughts had been of Harry, whom she had punished for\nsome act of flagrant rebellion during the afternoon. Now she was eager\nto comfort him if he was awake and unhappy, or merely to cuddle and kiss\nhim if he was fast asleep in his bed.\n\nAt the top of the staircase she saw the lowered lamp in the nursery, and\nbeside it stood Harry in his little nightgown, with a toy ship in his\narms.\n\n\"Mamma, I'm tired of bed and I want to play.\"\n\n\"S--sush, darling, you will wake Jenny. It isn't day yet. You must go\nback to bed.\"\n\n\"But I'm tired of bed.\"\n\n\"You won't be after I tuck you in.\"\n\n\"Will you sit by me and tell me a story?\"\n\n\"Yes, darling, I'll tell you a story if you'll promise not to talk.\"\n\nHer eyes were heavy with sleep, and her limbs trembled from the\nexhaustion of the long June day; but she remembered the punishment of\nthe afternoon, and as she looked at him her heart seemed melting with\ntenderness.\n\n\"And you'll promise not to go away until I'm fast asleep?--you'll\npromise, mamma?\"\n\n\"I'll promise, precious. No, you mustn't take your ship to bed with you.\nThat's a darling.\"\n\nThen, as Oliver was heard coming softly up the stairs for fear of\narousing the children, she caught Harry's moist hand in hers and stole\nwith him into the nursery.\n\nTo Virginia in the long torrid days of that summer there seemed time for\nneither anxiety nor disappointment. Every minute of her eighteen waking\nhours was spent in keeping the children washed, dressed, and\ngood-humoured. She thought of herself so little that it never occurred\nto her to reflect whether she was happy or unhappy--hardly, even,\nwhether she was awake or asleep. Twice a week John Henry's horse carried\nOliver for a ride with Abby and Susan, and on these evenings he stayed\nso late that Virginia ceased presently even to make a pretence of\nwaiting supper. Several times, on September afternoons, when the country\nburned with an illusive radiance as if it were seen through a mirage,\nshe put on her old riding-habit, which she had hunted up in the attic at\nthe rectory, and mounting one of Abby's horses, started to accompany\nthem; but her conscience reproached her so bitterly at the thought that\nshe was seeking pleasure away from the children, that she hurried\nhomeward across the fields before the others were ready to turn. As with\nmost women who are born for motherhood, that supreme fact had not only\nabsorbed the emotional energy of her girlhood, but had consumed in its\necstatic flame even her ordinary capacities for enjoyment. While\nfatherhood left Oliver still a prey to dreams and disappointments, the\nmore exclusive maternal passion rendered Virginia profoundly indifferent\nto every aspect of life except the intimate personal aspect of her\nmarriage. She couldn't be happy--she couldn't even be at ease--while she\nremembered that the children were left to the honest, yet hardly tender,\nmercies of Marthy.\n\n\"I shall never go again,\" she thought, as she slipped from her saddle at\nthe gate, and, catching up her long riding-skirt, ran up the short walk\nto the steps. \"I must be getting old. Something has gone out of me.\"\n\nAnd there was no regret in her heart for this _something_ which had fled\nout of her life, for the flashing desires and the old breathless\npleasures of youth which she had lost. For a month this passive joy\nlasted--the joy of one whose days are full and whose every activity is\nin useful service. Then there came an October afternoon which she never\nforgot because it burned across her life like a prairie fire and left a\nscarred track of memory behind it. It had been a windless day, filled\nwith glittering blue lights that darted like birds down the long\nash-coloured roads, and spun with a golden web of air which made the\nfields and trees appear as thin and as unsubstantial as dreams. The\nchildren were with Marthy in the park, and Virginia, attired in the old\nwaist with the new sleeves, was leaning on the front gate watching the\nslow fall of the leaves from the gnarled mulberry tree at the corner,\nwhen Mrs. Pendleton appeared on the opposite side of the street and\ncrossed the cobblestones of the road with her black alpaca skirt\ntrailing behind her.\n\n\"I wonder why in the world mother doesn't hold up her skirt?\" thought\nVirginia, swinging back the little wooden gate while she waited.\n\"Mother, you are letting your train get all covered with dust!\" she\ncalled, as soon as Mrs. Pendleton came near enough to catch her\nhalf-whispered warning.\n\nReaching down indifferently, the older woman caught up a handful of her\nskirt and left the rest to follow ignominiously in the dust. From the\ncarelessness of the gesture, Virginia saw at once that her mother's mind\nwas occupied by one of those rare states of excitement or of distress\nwhen even the preservation of her clothes had sunk to a matter of\nsecondary importance. When the small economies were banished from Mrs.\nPendleton's consciousness, matters had assumed indeed a serious aspect.\n\n\"Why, mother, what on earth has happened?\" asked Virginia, hurrying\ntoward her.\n\n\"Let me come in and speak to you, Jinny. I mean inside the house. One\ncan never be sure that some of the neighbours aren't listening,\" she\nsaid in a whisper.\n\nHurrying past her daughter, she went into the hall, and, then turning,\nfaced her with her hand on the door-knob. In the dim light of the hall\nher face showed white and drawn, like the face of a person who has been\nsuddenly stricken with illness. \"Jinny, I've just had a visit from Mrs.\nCarrington--you know what a gossip she is--but I think I ought to tell\nyou that she says people are talking about Oliver's riding so much with\nAbby.\"\n\nA pain as sharp as if the teeth of a beast had fastened in her heart,\npierced Virginia while she stood there, barring the door with her hands.\nHer peace, which had seemed indestructible a moment ago, was shattered\nby a sensation of violent anger--not against Abby, not against Oliver,\nnot even against the gossiping old women of Dinwiddie--but against her\nown blindness, her own inconceivable folly! At the moment the\ncivilization of centuries was stripped from her, and she was as simple\nand as primitive as a female of the jungle. On the surface she was still\ncalm, but to her own soul she felt that she presented the appalling\nspectacle of a normal woman turned fury. It was one of those instants\nthat are so unexpected, so entirely unnatural and out of harmony with\nthe rest of life, that they obliterate the boundaries of character which\nseparate the life of the individual from the ancient root of the race.\nNot Virginia, but the primeval woman in her blood, shrieked out in\nprotest as she saw her hold on her mate threatened. The destruction of\nthe universe, as long as it left her house standing in its bit of\nground, would have overwhelmed her less utterly.\n\n\"But what on earth can they say, mother? It was all my fault. I made him\ngo. He never lifted his finger for Abby.\"\n\n\"I know, darling, I know. Of course, Oliver is not to blame, but people\nwill talk, and I think Abby ought to have known better.\"\n\nFor an instant only Virginia hesitated. Then something stronger than the\nprimitive female in her blood--the spirit of a lady--spoke through her\nlips.\n\n\"I don't believe Abby was to blame, either,\" she said.\n\n\"But women ought to know better, Jinny, and Abby is nearly thirty.\"\n\n\"She always wanted me to go, mother. I don't believe she thought for a\nminute that she was doing anything wrong. Abby is a little coarse, but\nshe's perfectly good. Nobody will make me think otherwise.\"\n\n\"Well, it can't go on, dear. You must stop Oliver's riding with her. And\nMrs. Carrington says she hears that he is going to Atlantic City with\nthem in General Goode's private car on Thursday.\"\n\n\"Abby asked me, too, but of course I couldn't leave the children.\"\n\n\"Of course not. Oliver must give it up, too. Oh, Jinny, a scandal, even\nwhere one is innocent, is so terrible. A woman--a true woman--would\nendure death rather than be talked about. I remember your cousin Jane\nPendleton made an unhappy marriage, and her husband used to get drunk\nand beat her and even carry on dreadfully with the coloured\nservants--but she said that was better than the disgrace of a\nseparation.\"\n\n\"But all that has nothing to do with me, mother. Oliver is an angel, and\nthis is every bit my fault, not Abby's.\" The violence in her soul had\npassed, and she felt suddenly calm.\n\n\"Of course, darling, of course. Now that you see what it has led to, you\ncan stop it immediately.\"\n\nThey were so alike as they stood there facing each other, mother and\ndaughter, that they might have represented different periods of the same\nlife--youth and age meeting together. Both were perfect products of that\nsocial order whose crowning grace and glory they were. Both were\ncreatures trained to feel rather than think, whose very goodness was the\nresult not of reason, but of emotion. And, above all, both were\ngentlewomen to the innermost cores of their natures. Passion could not\nbanish for long that exquisite forbearance which generations had\ndeveloped from a necessity into an art.\n\n\"I can't stop his going with her, because that would make people think I\nbelieved the things they say--but I can go, too, mother, and I will.\nI'll borrow Susan's horse and go fox-hunting with them to-morrow.\"\n\nOnce again, as on the afternoon when she had heard of Oliver's illness\nin New York, Mrs. Pendleton realized that her daughter's strength was\nmore than a match for hers when the question related to Oliver.\n\n\"But the children, dear--and then, oh, Jinny, you might get hurt.\"\n\nTo her surprise Jinny laughed.\n\n\"I shan't get hurt, mother--and if I did----\"\n\nShe left her sentence unfinished, but in the break there was the first\nnote of bitterness that her mother had ever heard from her lips. Was it\npossible, after all, that there was \"more in it\" than she had let appear\nin her words? Was it possible that her passionate defence of Abby had\nbeen but a beautiful pretence?\n\n\"I'll go straight down to the Treadwells' to ask Susan for her horse,\"\nshe added cheerfully, \"and you'll come over very early, won't you, to\nstay with the children? Oliver always starts before daybreak.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling, I'll get up at dawn and come over--but, Jinny, promise me\nto be careful.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll be careful,\" responded Virginia lightly, as she went out on\nthe porch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE WILL TO LIVE\n\n\n\"It's all horrid talk. There's not a word of truth in it,\" she thought,\ntrue to the Pendleton point of view, as she turned into Old Street on\nher way to the Treadwells'. Then the sound of horses' hoofs rang on the\ncobblestones, and, looking past the corner, she saw Oliver and Abby\ngalloping under the wine-coloured leaves of the oak tree at the\ncrossing. His face was turned back, as if he were looking over his\nshoulder at the red sunset, and he was laughing as she had not heard him\nlaugh since that dreadful morning in the bedroom of the New York hotel.\nWhat a boy he was still! As she watched him, it seemed to her that she\nwas old enough to be his mother, and the soreness in her heart changed\ninto an exquisite impulse of tenderness. Then he looked from the sunset\nto Abby, and at the glance of innocent pleasure that passed between them\na stab of jealousy entered her heart like a blade. Before it faded, they\nhad passed the corner, and were cantering wildly up Old Street in the\ndirection of Abby's home.\n\n\"It is my fault. I am too settled. I am letting my youth go,\" she said,\nwith a passionate determination to catch her girlhood and hold it fast\nbefore it eluded her forever. \"I am only twenty-eight and I dress like a\nwoman of forty.\" And it seemed to her that the one desirable thing in\nlife was this fleet-winged spirit of youth, which passed like a breath,\nleaving existence robbed of all romance and beauty. An hour before she\nhad not cared, and she would not care now if only Oliver could grow\nmiddle-aged and old at the moment when she did. Ah, there was the\ntragedy! All life was for men, and only a few radiant years of it were\ngiven to women. Men were never too old to love, to pursue and capture\nwhatever joy the fugitive instant might hold for them. But women, though\nthey were allowed only one experience out of the whole of life, were\nasked to resign even that one at the very minute when they needed it\nmost. \"I wonder what will become of me when the children grow big enough\nto be away all the time as Oliver is,\" she thought wistfully. \"I wish\none never grew too old to have babies.\"\n\nThe front door of the Treadwell house stood open, and in the hall Susan\nwas arranging golden-rod and life-ever-lasting in a blue china bowl.\n\n\"Of course, you may have Belle to-morrow,\" she said in answer to\nVirginia's faltering request. \"Even if I intended going, I'd be only too\nglad to lend her to you--but I can't leave mother anyway. She always\ngets restless if I stay out over an hour.\"\n\nMrs. Treadwell's illness had become one of those painful facts which\npeople accept as naturally as they accept the theological dogma of\ndamnation. It was terrible, when they thought of it, but they seldom\nthought of it, thereby securing tranquillity of mind in the face of both\nfacts and dogmas. Even Virginia had ceased to make her first question\nwhen she met Susan, \"How is your mother?\"\n\n\"But, Susan, you need the exercise. I thought that was why the doctor\nmade Uncle Cyrus get you a horse.\"\n\n\"It was, but I only go for an hour in the afternoon. I begrudge every\nminute I spend away from mother. Oh, Jinny, she is so pathetic! It\nalmost breaks my heart to watch her.\"\n\n\"I know, dearest,\" said Virginia; but at the back of her brain she was\nthinking, \"They looked so happy together, yet he could never really\nadmire Abby. She isn't at all the kind of woman he likes.\"\n\nSo preoccupied was she by this problem of her own creation, that her\nvoice had a strangely far off sound, as though it came from a distance.\n\"I wish I could help you, dear Susan. If you ever want me, day or night,\nyou know you have only to send for me. I'd let nothing except desperate\nillness stand in the way of my coming.\"\n\nIt was true, and because she knew that it was true, Susan stooped\nsuddenly and kissed her.\n\n\"You are looking tired, Jinny. What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing except that I'm a sight in this old waist. I made it over to\nsave buying one, but I wish now I hadn't. It makes me look so settled.\"\n\n\"You need some clothes, and you used to be so fond of them.\"\n\n\"That was before the children came. I've never cared much since. It's\njust as if life were a completed circle, somehow. There's nothing more\nto expect or to wait for--you'll understand what I mean some day,\nSusan.\"\n\n\"I think I do now. But only women are like that? Men are different----\"\n\nIt was the classic phrase again, but on Susan's lips it sounded with a\nnew significance.\n\n\"And some women are different, too,\" replied Virginia. \"Now there's Abby\nGoode--Susan, what do you honestly think of Abby?\"\n\nThere was a wistful note in the question, and around her gentle blue\neyes appeared a group of little lines, brought out by the nervous\ncontraction of her forehead. Was it the wan, smoky light of the\ndusk?--Susan wondered, or was Virginia really beginning to break so\nsoon?\n\n\"Why, I like Abby. I always did,\" she answered, trying to look as if she\ndid not understand what Virginia had meant. \"She's a little bit what\nJohn Henry calls 'loud,' but she has a good heart and would do anybody a\nkindness.\"\n\nShe had evaded answering, just as Virginia had evaded asking, the\nquestion which both knew had passed unuttered between them--was Abby to\nbe trusted to keep inviolate the ancient unwritten pledge of honourable\nwomanhood? Her character was being tested by the single decisive virtue\nexacted of her sex.\n\n\"I am glad you feel that way,\" said Virginia in a relieved manner after\na minute, \"because I should hate not to believe in Abby, and some people\ndon't understand her manner--mother among them.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's all right. I'm sure of it,\" answered Susan, with heartiness.\n\nThe wistful sound had passed out of Virginia's voice, while the little\nlines faded as suddenly from the corners of her eyes. She looked better\nalready--only she really ought not to wear such dowdy clothes, even\nthough she was happily married, reflected Susan, as she watched her, a\nfew minutes later, pass over the mulberry leaves, which lay, thick and\nstill, on the sidewalk.\n\nAt the corner of Sycamore Street a shopkeeper was putting away his goods\nfor the night, and in the window Virginia saw a length of hyacinth-blue\nsilk, matching her eyes, which she had remotely coveted for weeks--never\nexpecting to possess it, yet never quite reconciling herself to the\nthought that it might be worn by some other woman. That length of silk\nhad grown gradually to symbolize the last glimmer of girlish vanity\nwhich motherhood had not extinguished in her heart; and while she looked\nat it now, in her new recklessness of mood, a temptation, born of the\nperversity which rules human fate, came to her to go in and buy it while\nshe was still desperate enough to act foolishly and not be afraid. For\nthe first time in her life that immemorial spirit of adventure which\nlies buried under the dead leaves of civilization at the bottom of every\nhuman heart--with whose re-arisen ghost men have moved mountains and\nploughed jungles and charted illimitable seas--this imperishable spirit\nstirred restlessly in its grave and prompted her for once to be\nuncalculating and to risk the future. In the flickering motive which\nguided her as she entered the shop, one would hardly have recognized the\nlusty impulse which had sent her ancestors on splendid rambles of\nknight-errantry, yet its hidden source was the same. The simple purchase\nof twelve yards of blue silk which she had wanted for weeks! To an\noutsider it would have appeared a small matter, yet in the act there was\nthe intrepid struggle of a personal will to enforce its desire upon\ndestiny. She would win back the romance and the beauty of living at the\ncost of prudence, at the cost of practical comforts, at the cost, if\nneed be, of those ideals of womanly duty to which the centuries had\ntrained her! For eight years she had hardly thought of herself, for\neight years she had worked and saved and planned and worried, for eight\nyears she had given her life utterly and entirely to Oliver and the\nchildren--and the result was that he was happier with Abby--with Abby\nwhom he didn't even admire--than he was with the wife whom he both\nrespected and loved! The riddle not only puzzled, it enraged her. Though\nshe was too simple to seek a psychological answer, the very fact that it\nexisted became an immediate power in her life. She forgot the lateness\nof the evening, she forgot the children who were anxiously watching for\nher return. The forces of character, which she had always regarded as\ndivinely fixed and established, melted and became suddenly fluid. She\nwasn't what she had been the minute before--she wasn't even, she began\ndimly to realize, what she would probably be the minute afterwards. Yet\nthe impulse which governed her now was as despotic as if it had reigned\nin undisputed authority since the day of her birth. She knew that it was\na rebel against the disciplined and moderate rule of her conscience, but\nthis knowledge, which would have horrified her had she been in a normal\nmood, aroused in her now merely a breathless satisfaction at the\nspectacle of her own audacity. The natural Virginia had triumphed for an\ninstant over the Virginia whom the ages had bred.\n\nAt home she found Oliver waiting for supper, and the three children in\ntears for fear she should decide to stay out forever.\n\n\"Oh, mother, we thought you'd gone away never to come back,\" sobbed\nLucy, throwing herself into her arms, \"and what would little Jenny have\ndone?\"\n\n\"Where in the world have you been, Virginia?\" asked Oliver, a trifle\nimpatiently, for he was not used to having her absent from the house at\nmeal hours. \"I was afraid somebody had been taken ill at the rectory, so\nI went around to inquire.\"\n\n\"No, nobody was ill,\" answered Virginia quietly. Though her resolution\nmade her tremble all over, it did not occur to her for an instant that\neven now she might recede from it. As the rector had gone to the war, so\nshe was going now to battle with Abby. She was afraid, but that quality\nwhich had made the Pendletons despise fear since the beginning of\nDinwiddie's history, which they had helped to make, enabled her to\ncontrol her quivering muscles and to laugh at the reproachful protests\nwith which the children surrounded her. Through her mind there shot the\nthought: \"I have a secret from Oliver,\" and she felt suddenly guilty\nbecause for the first time since her marriage she was keeping something\nback from him. Then, following this, there came the knowledge, piercing\nher heart, that she must keep her secret because even if she told him,\nhe would not understand. With the casualness of a man's point of view\ntowards an emotion, he would judge its importance, she felt, chiefly by\nthe power it possessed of disturbing the course of his life.\nUnobservant, and ever ready to twist and decorate facts as she was, it\nhad still been impossible for her to escape the truth that men are by\nnature incapable of a woman's characteristic passion for nursing\nsentiment. To struggle to keep a feeling alive for no better reason than\nthat it was a feeling, would appear as wastefully extravagant to Oliver\nas to the unimaginative majority of his sex. Such pure, sublime,\nuncalculating folly belonged to woman alone!\n\nWhen, at last, supper was over and the children were safely in bed, she\ncame downstairs to Oliver, who was smoking a cigar over a newspaper, and\nasked carelessly:\n\n\"At what time do you start in the morning?\"\n\n\"I'd like to be up by five,\" he replied, without lowering his paper.\n\"We're to meet the hounds at Croswell's store at a quarter of six, so\nI'll have to get off by five at the latest. I wanted my horse fresh for\nto-morrow, that's why I only went a mile or two this afternoon,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"Susan's to lend me Belle. I'm going with you,\" she said, after a pause\nin which he had begun to read his paper again. This habit of treating\nher as if she were not present when he wanted to read or to work, was,\nshe remembered, one of the things she had insisted upon in the beginning\nof her marriage.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, and the paper dropped from his hands. \"I'm\njolly glad, but what will you do about the children?\"\n\n\"Mother is coming to look after them. I'll be back in time to hear\nHarry's lessons, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Why, of course; but, look here, you'll be awfully sore. You haven't\nridden after the hounds since I knew you. You might even get a fall.\"\n\n\"I used to go, though, a great deal--and it won't hurt me to be stiff\nfor a few days. Besides, I want to take up hunting again.\"\n\nHer motive was beyond him--perhaps because of her nearness, which\nprevented his getting the proper perspective of vision. For all his\nkeenness of insight, he failed utterly to see into the mysterious mind\nof his wife. He could not penetrate that subtle interplay of traditional\nvirtues and discover that she was in the clutch of one of the oldest and\nmost savage of the passions.\n\n\"Then you'd better go to bed early and get some sleep,\" he said. \"I\nsuppose we'll have a cup of coffee before starting.\"\n\n\"I'll make it on the oil stove while I am dressing. Marthy won't be up\nthen.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll come upstairs in ten minutes,\" he replied, taking up his\npaper again. \"I only want to finish this article.\"\n\nIn the morning when she opened the old green shutters and looked out of\nthe window, the horses, having been saddled by candlelight, were\nstanding under the mulberry tree at the gate. Eight years ago, in her\ngirlhood, she would have awakened in a delicious excitement on the\nmorning of a fox-hunt, and have dressed as eagerly as if she were going\nto a ball; but to-day, while she lit the oil-stove in the hall room and\nput on the kettle of water, she was supported not by the hope of\npleasure, but by a dull, an almost indefinable sensation of dread. The\ninstinct of woman to adjust her personality to the changing ideals of\nthe man she loves--this instinct older than civilization, rooted in\ntragedy, and existing by right of an unconquerable necessity--rose\nsuperior at the moment to that more stable maternal passion with which\nit has conflicted since the beginning of motherhood. While she put on\nher riding-habit and tied up the plait of her hair, the one thought in\nVirginia's mind was that she must be, at all costs, the kind of woman\nthat Oliver wanted.\n\nA little later, when they set out under the mulberry trees, she glanced\nat him wistfully, as though she wanted him to praise the way she looked\nin the saddle. But his eyes were on the end of the street, where a\nlittle company of riders awaited them, and before she could ask a\nquestion, Abby's high voice was heard exclaiming pleasantly upon her\npresence. Not a particularly imposing figure, because of her rather\nshort legs, when she was on the ground, it was impossible for Virginia\nto deny that Abby was amazingly handsome on horseback. Plump, dark, with\na superb bosom, and a colour in her cheeks like autumnal berries, she\nhad never appeared to better advantage than she did, sitting on her\nspirited bay mare under an arch of scarlet leaves which curved over her\nhead. Turning at their approach, she started at a brisk canter up the\nroad, and as Virginia followed her, the sound of the horn floated, now\nloud, now faint, out of the pale mist that spun fanciful silken webs\nover the trees and bushes.\n\n\"Remember to look out for the creeks. That's where the danger comes,\"\nsaid Oliver, riding close to her, and he added nervously, \"Don't try to\nkeep up with Abby.\"\n\nAhead of them stretched a deserted Virginia road, with its look of\nbrooding loneliness, as if it had waited patiently through the centuries\nfor a civilization which had never come; and on the right of it, beyond\na waste of scarlet sumach and sassafras and a winding creek screened in\nelder bushes, the dawn was breaking slowly under a single golden-edged\ncloud. Somebody on Virginia's left--a large, raw-boned, passionate\nhuntsman, in an old plum-coloured overcoat with a velvet collar--was\ncomplaining loudly that they had started too late and the fox would have\ngone to his lair before they reached the main party. Except for an oath,\nwhich he rapped out by way of an emphasis not intended for the ladies,\nhe might have been conducting a religious revival, so solemnly\nenergetic, so deeply moved, was his manner. The hunt, which observed\nnaturally the characteristics of a society that was ardently\nindividualistic even in its sports, was one of those informal,\n\"go-as-you-please\" affairs in which the supreme joy of killing is not\nhampered by tedious regulations or unnecessary restrictions. The chief\nthing was to get a run--to start a rare red fox, if luck was good,\nbecause he was supposed to run straight by nature and not to move in\ncircles after the inconsiderate manner of the commoner grey sort. But\nProvidence, being inattentive to the needs of hunters in the\nneighbourhood of Dinwiddie, had decreed that the red fox should live\nthere mainly in the vivid annals of old sportsmen.\n\n\"A grey fox with red ears. The best run I ever had. Tried to get in the\ncrotch of a hickory tree at the end. Was so exhausted he couldn't stir a\nfoot when the hounds got him.\" While they waited at the crossroads\nbefore a little country store, where the pack of hounds, lean, cringing,\nhabitually hungry creatures, started from beneath an old field pine on\nthe right, Virginia heard the broken phrases blown on the wind, which\ncarried the joyous notes of the horn over the meadows. The casual\ncruelty of the words awoke no protest in her mind, because it was a\ncruelty to which she was accustomed. If the sport had been unknown in\nDinwiddie, and she had read of it as the peculiar activity of the\ninhabitants of the British Islands, she would probably have condemned it\nas needlessly brutal and degrading. But with that universal faculty of\nthe human mind to adjust its morality to fit its inherited physical\nhabits, she regarded \"the rights of the fox\" to-day with something of\nthe humorous scorn of sentimental rubbish with which her gentler\ngrandmother had once regarded \"the rights of the slave.\" For centuries\nthe hunt had been one of the cherished customs of Dinwiddians; and\nthough she could not bear to see a fly caught in a web, it would never\nhave occurred to her to question the humanity of any sport in which her\nancestors had delighted. In her girlhood the sound of the horn had\ncalled to her blood with all the intoxicating associations it awoke in\nthe raw-boned, energetic rider in the plum-coloured coat--but to-day\nboth the horn and the familiar landscape around her had grown strange\nand unhomelike. For the first time since her birth she and the country\nwere out of harmony.\n\nIn the midst of the hounds, in the centre of the old field on the right,\nthe huntsman, who was at the same time master and owner of the dogs,\nbrandished a long raw-hide whip, flexible from the handle, which was\npleasantly known in Dinwiddie as a \"mule-skinner.\" His face, burned to\nthe colour of ripe wheat, wore a rapt and exalted look, as though the\nchasing of a small animal to its death had called forth his latent\nspiritual ardours. Beyond him, like a low, smouldering fire, ran the red\nand gold of the abandoned field.\n\n\"Please be careful, Virginia,\" said Oliver again, as they left the road\nand cantered in the direction of a clump of pine woods in a hollow\nbeyond a rotting \"snake\" fence.\n\nBut she had seen his eyes on Abby a minute before, and had heard his\nlaugh as he answered her. A wave of recklessness broke over her, and she\nfelt that she despised fear with all her Pendleton blood, which loved a\nfight only less passionately than it loved a sermon. Whatever\nhappened--if she broke her neck--she resolved that she would keep up\nwith Abby! With the drumming of the blood in her ears, an almost savage\njoy awoke in her. Deep down in her, so deep that it was buried beneath\nthe Virginia Pendleton whom she and her world knew, there stirred\nfaintly the seeds of that ancient lust of cruelty from which have sprung\nthe brutal pleasures of men. The part of her--that small secret\npart--which was primitive answered to the impulse of jealousy as it did\nto the rapturous baying of the hounds out of the red and gold distance.\nA branch grazed her cheek; her hat went as she raced down the high banks\nof a stream; the thicket of elder tore the ribbon from her head, and\nloosened her dark flying hair from its braid. In that desolate country,\nin the midst of the October meadows, with the cries of the hounds\nrising, like the voice of mortal tragedy, out of the tinted mist on the\nmarshes, the drama of human passions--which is the only drama for the\nworld's stage--was played out to an ending: love, jealousy, envy,\ndesire, desperation, regret--\n\nBut when the hunt was over, and she rode home, with a bedraggled brush,\nwhich had once been grey, tied to her bridle, all the gorgeous pageantry\nof the autumnal landscape seemed suddenly asking her: \"What is the use?\"\nHer mood had altered, and she felt that her victory was as worthless as\nthe mud-stained fox's brush that swung mockingly back and forth from her\nbridle. The excitement of the chase had ebbed away, leaving only the\nlifeless satisfaction of the reward. She had neglected her children, she\nhad risked her life--and all for the sake of wresting a bit of dead fur\nout of Abby's grasp. A spirit which was not her spirit, which was so old\nthat she no longer recognized that it had any part in her, which was yet\nso young that it burned in her heart with the unquenchable flame of\nyouth--this spirit, which was at the same time herself and not herself,\nhad driven her, as helpless as a fallen leaf, in a chase that she\ndespised, towards a triumph that was worthless.\n\n\"By Jove, you rode superbly, Virginia! I had no idea you could do it,\"\nsaid Oliver, as they trotted into Dinwiddie.\n\nShe smiled back at him, and her smile was tired, dust-stained,\nenigmatical.\n\n\"No, you did not know that I could do it,\" she answered.\n\n\"You'll keep it up now, won't you?\" he asked pleadingly.\n\nFor an instant, looking away from him over the radiant fields, she\npondered the question. The silence which had settled around her was\nunbroken by the sound of the horses' hoofs, by the laughter of the\nhunters, by the far-off soughing of the pine trees in the forest; and\ninto this silence, which seemed to cover an eternity, the two\nVirginias--the Virginia who desired and the Virginia who had learned\nfrom the ages to stifle her desire--wrestled for the first time\ntogether.\n\n\"Virginia!\" floated Abby's breezy tones from the street behind her, and\nturning, she rode back to the Goodes' gate, where the others were\ndismounting. \"Virginia, aren't you going to Atlantic City with us\nto-morrow?\"\n\nAgain she hesitated. Almost unconsciously her gaze passed from Abby to\nOliver, and she saw his pride in her in the smile with which he watched\nher.\n\n\"Yes, I'll go with you,\" she replied after a minute.\n\nShe had, for once in her life, done the thing she wanted to do simply\nbecause she wanted to do it. She had won back what she was losing; she\nhad fought a fair fight and she had triumphed; yet as she rode down the\nstreet to her gate, there was none of the exultation of victory, none of\nthe fugitive excitement of pleasure even in her heart. Like other\nmortals in other triumphant instants, she was learning that the fruit of\ndesire may be sweet to the eyes and bitter on the lips. She had\nsacrificed duty to pleasure, and suddenly she had discovered that to one\nwith her heritage of good and evil the two are inseparable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE PANG OF MOTHERHOOD\n\n\nIn the night Harry awoke crying. He had dreamed, he said between his\nsobs, when Virginia, slipperless and in her nightdress, bent over him,\nthat his mother was going away from him forever.\n\n\"Only for two nights, darling. Here, lean close against mother. Don't\nyou know that she wouldn't stay away from her precious boy?\"\n\n\"But two nights are so long. Aren't two nights almost forever?\"\n\n\"Why, my lamb, it was just two nights ago that grandma came over and\ntold you the Bible story about Joseph and his brothers. That was only a\nteeny-weeny time ago, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"But you were here, then mamma. And this morning was almost forever. You\nstayed out so long that Lucy said you weren't coming back any more.\"\n\n\"That was naughty of Lucy because she is old enough to know better. Why\ndo you choke that way? Does your throat hurt you?\"\n\n\"It hurts because you are going away, mamma.\"\n\n\"But I'm going only to be with papa, precious. Don't you want poor papa\nto have somebody with him?\"\n\n\"He's so big he can go by himself. But suppose the black man should come\nin the night while you are away, and I'd get scared and nobody would\nhear me.\"\n\n\"Grandma would hear you, Harry, and there isn't any black man that comes\nin the night. You must put that idea out of your head, dear. You're\ngetting too big a boy to be afraid of the dark.\"\n\n\"Four isn't big, is it?\"\n\n\"You're nearer five than four now, honey. Let me button your nightgown,\nand lie down and try to go to sleep while mamma sings to you. Does your\nthroat really hurt you?\"\n\n\"It feels as if it had teensy-weensy marbles in it. They came there when\nI woke up in the dark and thought that you were going away to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Well, if your throat hurts you, of course mamma won't leave you. Open\nyour mouth wide now so I can look at it.\"\n\nShe lighted a candle while Harry, kneeling in the middle of his little\nbed, followed her with his blue eyes, which looked three times their\nusual size because of his flushed cheeks and his mounting excitement.\nHis throat appeared slightly inflamed when she held the candle close to\nit, and after tucking him beneath the bed-clothes, she poured a little\ncamphorated oil into a cup and heated it on the small alcohol lamp she\nkept in the nursery.\n\n\"Mamma is going to put a nice bandage on your throat, and then she is\ngoing to lie down beside you and sing you to sleep,\" she said\ncheerfully, as she cut off a strip of flannel from an old petticoat and\nprepared to saturate it with the heated oil.\n\n\"Will you stay here all night?\"\n\n\"All night, precious, if you'll be good and go fast asleep while I am\nsinging.\"\n\nHolding tightly to her nightdress, Harry cuddled down between the\npillows with a contented sigh. \"Then I don't mind about the marbles in\nmy throat,\" he said.\n\n\"But mamma minds, and she wants to cure them before morning. Now lie\nvery still while she wraps this good flannel bandage over the sore\nplaces.\"\n\n\"I'll lie very still if you'll hold me, mamma.\"\n\nBlowing out the candle, she crept into the little bed beside him, and\nlay singing softly until his hands released their desperate grasp of her\nnightdress, and he slipped quietly off to sleep. Even then, remembering\nher promise, she did not go back to her bedroom until daylight.\n\n\"I wonder what makes Harry so afraid of the dark?\" she asked, when\nOliver awoke and turned questioningly towards her. \"He worked himself\nreally sick last night just from pure nervousness. I had to put\ncamphorated oil on his throat and chest, and lie beside him until\nmorning. He is sleeping quietly now, but it simply frightens me to death\nwhen one of them complains of sore throat.\"\n\n\"You've spoiled him, that's what's the matter,\" replied Oliver, yawning.\n\"As long as you humour him, he'll never outgrow these night terrors.\"\n\n\"But how can you tell whether the fright makes him sick or sickness\nbrings on the fright? His throat was really red, there's no doubt about\nthat, but I couldn't see last night that it was at all ulcerated.\"\n\n\"He gives you more trouble than both the other children put together.\"\n\n\"Well, he's a boy, and boys do give one more trouble. But, then, you\nhave less patience with him, Oliver.\"\n\n\"That's because he's a boy, and I like boys to show some pluck even when\nthey are babies. Lucy and Jenny never raise these midnight rows whenever\nthey awake in the dark.\"\n\n\"They are not nearly so sensitive. You don't understand Harry.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I don't, but I can see that you are ruining him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Oliver! How can you say such a cruel thing to me?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to be cruel, Jinny, and you know it, but all the same it\nmakes me positively sick to see you make a slave of yourself over the\nchildren. Why, you look as if you hadn't slept for a week. You are\npositively haggard.\"\n\n\"But I have to be up with Harry when he is ill. How in the world could I\nhelp it?\"\n\n\"You know he kicks up these rows almost every night, and you humour\nevery one of his whims as if it were the first one. Don't you ever get\ntired?\"\n\n\"Of course I do, but I can't let my child suffer even if it is only from\nfear. You haven't any patience, Oliver. Don't you remember the time when\nyou used to be afraid of things?\"\n\n\"I was never afraid of the dark in my life. No sensible child is, if he\nis brought up properly.\"\n\n\"Do you mean I am not bringing up my children----\" Her tears choked her\nand she could not finish the sentence.\n\n\"I don't mean anything except that you are making an old woman of\nyourself before your time. You've let yourself go until you look ten\nyears older than----\"\n\nHe checked himself in time, but she understood without his words that he\nhad started to say, \"ten years older than Abby.\" Yes, Abby did look\nyoung--amazingly young--but, then, what else had she to think of?\n\nShe lay down, but she was trembling so violently that she sat up quickly\nagain in order to recover her self-possession more easily. It seemed to\nher that the furious beating of her heart must make him understand how\nhe had wounded her. It was the first discussion approaching a quarrel\nthey had had since their marriage, for she, who was so pliable in all\nother matters, had discovered that she could become as hard as iron\nwhere the difference related to Harry.\n\n\"You are unjust, Oliver. I think you ought to see it,\" she said in a\nvoice which she kept by an effort from breaking.\n\n\"I'll never see it, Jinny,\" and some dogged impulse to hurt her more\nmade him add, \"It's for Harry's sake as well as yours that I'm\nspeaking.\"\n\n\"For Harry's sake? Oh, you don't mean--you can't really mean that you\nthink I'm not doing the best for my child, Oliver?\"\n\nA year ago Oliver would have surrendered at once before the terror in\nher eyes; but in those twelve long months of effort, of hope, of balked\nambition, of bitter questioning, and of tragic disillusionment, a new\nquality had developed in his character, and the generous sympathy of\nyouth had hardened at thirty-four to the cautious cynicism of\nmiddle-age. It is doubtful if even he himself realized how transient\nsuch a state must be to a nature whose hidden springs were moved so\neasily by the mere action of change--by the effect of any alteration in\nthe objects that surrounded him. Because the enthusiasm of youth was\nexhausted at the minute, it seemed to him that he had lost it forever.\nAnd to Virginia, who saw but one thing at a time and to whom that one\nthing was always the present instant, it seemed that the firm ground\nupon which she trod had crumbled beneath her.\n\n\"Well, if you want the truth,\" he said quietly (as if any mother ever\nwanted the truth about such a matter), \"I think you make a mistake to\nspoil Harry as you do.\"\n\n\"But,\" she brought out the words with a pathetic quiver, \"I treat him\njust as I do the others, and you never say anything about my spoiling\nthem.\"\n\n\"Oh, the others are girls. Girls aren't so easily ruined somehow. They\ndon't get such hard knocks later on, so it makes less difference about\nthem.\"\n\nAs she sat there in bed, propped up on her elbow, which trembled\nviolently against the pillows, with her cambric nightdress, trimmed only\nwith a narrow band of crocheted lace, opened at her slender throat, and\nher hair, which was getting thin at the temples, drawn unbecomingly back\nfrom her forehead, she looked, indeed, as Oliver had thought, \"at least\nten years older than Abby.\" Though she was not yet thirty, the delicate,\nflower-like bloom of her beauty was already beginning to fade. The\nspirit which had animated her yesterday appeared to have gone out of her\nnow. He thought how lovely she had been at twenty when he saw her for\nthe first time after his return to Dinwiddie; and a sudden anger seized\nhim because she was letting herself break, because she was so needlessly\nsacrificing her youth and her beauty.\n\nAn hour later she got up and dressed herself, with the feeling that she\nhad not rested a minute during the night. Harry was listless and fretful\nwhen he awoke, and while she put on his clothes, she debated with\nherself whether or not she should summon old Doctor Fraser from around\nthe corner. When his lesson hour came, he climbed into her lap and went\nto sleep with his hot little head on her shoulder, and though he seemed\nbetter by evening, she was still so anxious about him that she forgot\nthat she had promised Abby to go with them to Atlantic City until Oliver\ncame in at dusk and reminded her.\n\n\"Aren't you going, Virginia?\" he inquired, as he hunted in the closet\nfor his bag which she had not had time to pack.\n\n\"I can't, Oliver. Harry isn't well. He has been unlike himself all day,\nand I am afraid to leave him.\"\n\n\"He looks all right,\" he remarked, bending over the child in Virginia's\nlap. \"Does anything hurt you, Harry?\"\n\n\"He doesn't seem to know exactly what it is,\" answered Virginia, \"but if\nhe isn't well by morning, I'll send for Doctor Fraser.\"\n\n\"He's got a good colour, and I believe he's as well as he ever was,\"\nreplied Oliver, while a curious note of hostility sounded in his voice.\n\"There's nothing the matter with the boy,\" he added more positively\nafter a minute. \"Aren't you coming, Virginia?\"\n\nShe looked up at him from the big rocking-chair in which she sat with\nHarry in her arms, and as she did so, both became conscious that the\nissue had broadened from a question of her going to Atlantic City into a\ndirect conflict of wills. The only thing that could make her oppose him\nhad happened for the first time since her marriage. The feminine impulse\nto yield was overmatched by the maternal impulse to protect. She would\nhave surrendered her soul to him for the asking; but she could not\nsurrender, even had she desired to do so, the mother love which had\npassed into her from out the ages before she had been, and which would\npass through her into the ages to come after her.\n\n\"Of course, if the little chap were really suffering, I'd be as anxious\nabout staying as you are,\" said Oliver impatiently; \"but there's nothing\nthe matter. You're all right, aren't you, Harry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm all right,\" repeated Harry, yawning and snuggling closer to\nVirginia, \"but I'm sleepy.\"\n\n\"He isn't all right,\" insisted Virginia obstinately. \"There's something\nwrong with him. I don't know what it is, but he isn't in the least like\nhimself.\"\n\n\"It's just your imagination. You've got the children on the brain,\nVirginia. Don't you remember the time you woke me in the night and sent\nme after Doctor Fraser because Jenny had a bad attack of the hiccoughs?\"\n\n\"I know,\" acknowledged Virginia humbly. She could be humble enough, but\nwhat good did that do when she was, as he told himself irritably, \"as\nstubborn as a mule\"? Her softness--she had seemed as soft as flowers\nwhen he married her--had been her greatest charm for him after her\nbeauty; and now, at the end of eight years in which she had appeared as\ndelightfully invertebrate as he could have desired, she revealed to his\nastonished eyes a backbone that was evidently made of iron. She was\nimmovable, he admitted, and because she was immovable he was conscious\nof a sharp unreasonable impulse to reduce her to the pliant curves of\nher girlhood. After eight years of an absolute supremacy, which had been\nfar from good for him, his will had been tripped up at last by so small\na thing as a mere whim of Virginia's.\n\n\"You told Abby you would go,\" he urged, exasperated rather than soothed\nby her humility. \"And it's too late now for her to ask any one else.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, dear, but I never once thought about it. I've been so\nworried all day.\"\n\nHe looked at the child, lying flushed and drowsy in Virginia's arms, and\nhis face hardened until a latent brutality crept out around his\nhandsome, but loosely moulded, lips. The truth was that Harry had never\nlooked healthier than he did at that instant in the firelight, and the\nwhole affair appeared to Oliver only another instance of what he called\nVirginia's \"sensational motherhood.\"\n\n\"Can't you see for yourself that he's perfectly well?\" he asked.\n\n\"I know he looks so, dear, but he isn't.\"\n\n\"Well, here's your mother. Leave it to her. She will agree with me.\"\n\n\"Why, what is it, Jinny?\" asked Mrs. Pendleton, laying her bundle on the\ncouch (for she had come prepared to spend the night), and regarding\nOliver with the indulgent eyes of an older generation.\n\n\"Virginia says at the last minute that she won't go with us,\" said\nOliver, angry, yet caressing as he always was in his manner to his\nmother-in-law, to whom he was sincerely devoted. \"She's got into her\nhead that there's something wrong with Harry, but you can tell by\nlooking at the child that he is perfectly well.\"\n\n\"But I was up with him last night, mother. His throat hurts him,\" broke\nin Virginia in a voice that was full of emotion.\n\n\"He certainly looks all right,\" remarked Mrs. Pendleton, \"and I can take\ncare of him if anything should be wrong.\" Then she added very gravely,\n\"If you can't go, of course Oliver must stay at home, too, Virginia.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Oliver; \"not just for a whim, anyway. It would break up\nthe party. Besides, I didn't get a holiday all summer, and I'll blow up\nthat confounded bank unless I take a change.\"\n\nIn the last quarter of an hour the trip had become of tremendous\nimportance to him. From a trivial incident which he might have\nrelinquished a week ago without regret, the excursion with Abby had\nattained suddenly the dignity and the power of an event in his life.\nOpposition had magnified inclination into desire.\n\n\"I don't think it will do for Oliver to go without you, Jinny,\" said\nMrs. Pendleton, and the gravity of her face showed how carefully she was\nweighing her words.\n\n\"But I can't go, mother. You don't understand,\" replied Virginia, while\nher lips worked convulsively. No one could understand--not even her\nmother. Of the three of them, it is probable that she alone realized the\ncomplete significance of her decision.\n\n\"Well, it's too late now, anyway,\" remarked Oliver shortly. \"You\nwouldn't have time to dress and catch the train even if you wanted to.\"\n\nTaking up his bag, he kissed her carelessly, shook hands with Mrs.\nPendleton, and throwing a \"Good-bye, General!\" to Harry, went out of the\ndoor.\n\nAs he vanished, Virginia started up quickly, called \"Oliver!\" under her\nbreath, and then sat down again, drawing her child closer in her arms.\nHer face had grown grey and stricken like the face of an old woman.\nEvery atom of her quivered with the longing to run after him, to yield\nto his wish, to promise anything he asked of her. Yet she knew that if\nhe came back, they would only pass again through the old wearing\nstruggle of wills. She had chosen not as she desired to, but as she\nmust, and already she was learning that life forces one in the end to\nabide by one's choices.\n\n\"Oh, Virginia, I am afraid it was a mistake,\" said Mrs. Pendleton in an\nagonized tone. The horror of a scandal, which was stronger in the women\nof her generation than even the horror of illness, still darkened her\nmind.\n\nA shiver passed through Virginia and left her stiller and graver than\nbefore.\n\n\"No, it was not a mistake, mother,\" she answered quietly. \"I did what I\nwas obliged to do. Oliver could not understand.\"\n\nAs she uttered the words, she saw Oliver's face turned to Abby with the\ngay and laughing expression she had seen on it when the two rode down\nOld Street together, and a wave of passionate jealousy swept over her.\nShe had let him go alone; he was angry with her; and for three days he\nwould be with Abby almost every minute. And suddenly, she heard spoken\nby a mocking voice at the back of her brain: \"You look at least ten\nyears older than Abby.\"\n\n\"It does seem as if he might have stayed at home,\" remarked Mrs.\nPendleton; \"but he is so used to having his own way that it is harder\nfor him to give it up than for the rest of us. Your father says you have\nspoiled him.\"\n\nShe had spoiled him--this she saw clearly now, she who had never seen\nanything clearly until it was too late for sentimentality to work its\nharm. From the day of her marriage she had spoiled him because spoiling\nhim had been for her own happiness as well as for his. She had yielded\nto him since her chief desire had been simply to yield and to satisfy.\nHer unselfishness had been merely selfishness cloaked in the familiar\naspect of duty. Another vision of him, not as he looked when he was\nriding with Abby, but as he had appeared to her in the early days of\ntheir marriage, floated before her. He had been hers utterly then--hers\nwith his generous impulses, his high ideals, his undisciplined emotions.\nAnd what had she done with him? What were her good intentions--what was\nher love, even, worth--when her intentions and her love alike had been\nso lacking in wisdom? It was as if she condemned herself with a judgment\nwhich was not her own, as if her life-long habit of seeing only the\npresent instant had suddenly deserted her.\n\n\"He has been so nervous and unlike himself ever since the failure of his\nplay, mother,\" she said. \"It's hard to understand, but it meant more to\nhim than a woman can realize.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" returned Mrs. Pendleton sympathetically. \"Your father\nsays that he spoke to him bitterly the other day about being a failure.\nOf course, he isn't one in the least, darling,\" she added reassuringly.\n\n\"I sometimes think that Oliver's ambition was the greatest thing in his\nlife,\" said Virginia musingly. \"It meant to him, I believe, a great deal\nof what the children mean to me. He felt that it was himself, and yet in\na way closer than himself. Until that dreadful time in New York I never\nunderstood what his work may mean to a man.\"\n\n\"I wish you could have gone with him, Jinny.\"\n\n\"I couldn't,\" replied Virginia, as she had replied so often before. \"I\nknow Harry doesn't look sick,\" she went on with that soft obstinacy\nwhich never attacked and yet never yielded a point, \"but something tells\nme that he isn't well.\"\n\nAn hour later, when she put him to bed, he looked so gay and rosy that\nshe almost allowed herself the weakness of a regret. Suppose nothing was\nwrong, after all? Suppose, as Oliver had said, she was merely\n\"sensational\"? While she undressed in the dark for fear of awaking\nJenny, who was sleeping soundly in her crib on Virginia's side of the\nbed, her mind went back over the two harrowing days through which she\nhad just lived, and she asked herself, not if she had triumphed for good\nover Abby, but if she had really done what was right both for Oliver and\nthe children. After all, the whole of life came back simply to doing the\nthing that was right. So unused was she to the kind of introspection\nwhich weighs emotions as if they were facts, that she thought slowly,\nfrom sheer lack of practice in the subtler processes of reasoning.\nWorry, the plain, ordinary sort of worry with which she was unhappily\nfamiliar, had not prepared her for the piercing anguish which follows\nthe probing of the open wounds in one's soul. To lie sleepless over\nbutchers' bills was different, somehow, from lying sleepless over the\npossible loss of Oliver's love. It was different, and yet, just as she\nhad asked herself over and over again on those other nights if she had\ndone right to run up so large an account at Mr. Dewlap's, so she\nquestioned her conscience now in the hope of finding justification for\nOliver. \"Ought I to have gone on the hunt yesterday?\" she asked\nkneeling, with sore and aching limbs, by the bedside. \"Had I a right to\nrisk my life when the children are so young that they need me every\nminute? It is true nothing happened. Providence watched over me; but,\nthen, something might have happened, and I could have blamed only\nmyself. I was jealous--for the first time in my life, I was jealous--and\nbecause I was jealous, I did wrong and neglected my duty. Yesterday I\nsacrificed the children to Oliver, and to-day I sacrificed Oliver to the\nchildren. I love Oliver as much, but I have made the children. They came\nonly because I brought them into the world. I am responsible for them--I\nam responsible for them,\" she repeated passionately; and a moment later,\nshe prayed softly: \"O Lord, help me to want to do what is right.\"\n\nThrough the night, tired and sore as she was, she hardly closed her\neyes, and she was lying wide awake, with her hand on the railing of\nJenny's crib, and her gaze on the half-bared bough of the old mulberry\ntree in the street, when a cry, or less than a cry, a small, choking\nwhimper, from the nursery, caused her to spring out of bed with a start\nand slip into her wrapper which lay across the edge of the quilt.\n\n\"I'm coming, darling,\" she called softly, and the answer came back in\nHarry's voice: \"Mamma, I'm afraid!\"\n\nWithout waiting to put on her slippers, for one of them had slid under\nthe bed, she ran across the carpet and through the doorway into the\nadjoining room.\n\n\"What is it, my lamb? Does anything hurt you?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"I'm afraid, mamma.\"\n\n\"What are you afraid of? Mamma is here, precious.\"\n\nHis little hands were hot when she clasped them, and the pathetic wonder\nin his blue eyes made her heart stand still with a fear greater than\nHarry's. Ever since the children had come she had lived in terror of a\nserious illness attacking them.\n\n\"Where does it hurt you, darling? Can't you tell me?\"\n\n\"It feels so funny when I swallow, mamma. It's all full of flannel.\"\n\n\"Will you open your mouth wide, then, and let mamma mop your throat with\nturpentine?\"\n\nBut Harry hated turpentine even more than he hated the sore throat, and\nhe protested with tears while she found the bottle in the bathroom and\nswathed the end of the wire mop in cotton. When she brought it to his\nbedside, he fought so strenuously that she was obliged at last to give\nup. His fever had excited him, and he sobbed violently while she\napplied the bandages to his throat and chest.\n\n\"Is it any better, dear?\" she asked desperately at the end of an hour in\nwhich he had lain, weeping and angry, in her arms.\n\n\"It feels funny. I don't like it,\" he sobbed, pushing her from him.\n\n\"Then I'll send for Doctor Fraser. He'll make you well.\"\n\nBut he didn't want Doctor Fraser, who gave the meanest medicines. He\ndidn't want anybody. He hated everybody. He hated Lucy. He hated Jenny.\nWhen at last day came, and Marthy appeared to know what Virginia wanted\nfor breakfast, he was still vowing passionately that he hated them all.\n\n\"Marthy, run at once for Doctor Fraser. Harry is quite sick,\" said\nVirginia, pale to the lips.\n\n\"But I won't see him, mamma, and I won't take his medicines. They are\nthe meanest medicines.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he won't give you any, precious, and if he does, mamma will\ntaste every single one for you.\"\n\nThen Jenny began to beg to get up, and Lucy, who had been watching with\ndispassionate curiosity from the edge of her little bed, was sent to\namuse her until Marthy's return.\n\n\"Suppose I had gone!\" thought Virginia, while an overwhelming\nthankfulness swept the anxiety out of her mind. Not until the servant\nreappeared, dragging the fat old doctor after her, did Virginia remember\nthat she was still barefooted, and go into her bedroom to search for her\nslippers.\n\n\"You don't think he is seriously sick, do you, doctor? Is there any\nneed to be alarmed?\" she asked, and her voice entreated him to allay her\nanxiety.\n\nThe doctor, a benevolent soul in a body which had run to fat from lack\nof exercise, was engaged in holding Harry's tongue down with a silver\nspoon, while, in spite of the child's furious protests, he leisurely\nexamined his throat. When the operation was over, and Harry, crying,\nchoking, and kicking, rolled into Virginia's arms, she put the question\nagain, vaguely rebelling against the gravity in the kind old face which\nwas turned half away from her:\n\n\"There's nothing really the matter, is there, doctor?\"\n\nHe turned to her, and laid a caressing, if heavy, hand on her shoulder,\nwhich shook suddenly under the thin folds of her dressing-gown. After\nforty years in which he had watched suffering and death, he preserved\nstill his native repugnance to contact with any side of life that did\nnot have a comfortable feeling to it.\n\n\"Oh, we'll get him all right soon, with some good nursing,\" he said\ngently, \"but I think we're going to have a bit of an illness on our\nhands.\"\n\n\"But not serious, doctor? It isn't anything serious?\"\n\nShe felt suddenly so weak that she could hardly stand, and instinctively\nshe reached out to grasp the large, protecting arm of the physician.\nEven then his bland professional smile, which had in it something of the\nserene detachment of the everlasting purpose of which it was a part, did\nnot fade, hardly changed even, on his features.\n\n\"Well, I think we'd better get the other children away. It might be\nserious if they all had it on our hands.\"\n\n\"Had it? Had what? Oh, doctor--not--diphtheria?\"\n\nShe brought out the word with a face of such unutterable horror that he\nturned his eyes away, lest the memory of her look should interfere with\nhis treatment of the next case he visited. There was something infernal\nin the sound of the thing which always knocked over the mothers of his\ngeneration. He had never seen one of them who could hear it without\ngoing to pieces on his hands; and for that reason he never mentioned the\ndisease by name unless they drove him to it. They feared it as they\nmight have feared the plague--and even more! If the medical profession\nwould begin calling it something else, he wondered if the unmitigated\nterror of it wouldn't partially subside?\n\n\"Well, it looks like that now, Jinny,\" he said soothingly; \"but we'll\ncome out all right, never fear. It isn't a bad case, you know, and the\nchief thing is to get the other children out of danger.\"\n\nAt this she went over like a log on the bed, and it was only after he\nhad found the bottle of camphor on the mantelpiece and held it to her\nnostrils, that she revived sufficiently to sit up again. But as soon as\nher strength came back, her courage surprised and rejoiced him. After\nthat one sign of weakness, she became suddenly strong, and he knew by\nthe expression of her face, for he had had great experience with\nmothers, that he could count on her not to break down again while he\nneeded her.\n\n\"I'd like to get a tent made of some sheets and keep a kettle boiling\nunder it,\" he said, for he was an old man and belonged to the dark ages\nof medicine. \"But first of all I'll get the children over to your\nmother's. They'd better not come in here again. I'll ask the servant to\nattend to them.\"\n\n\"You'll find her in the dining-room,\" replied Virginia, while she\nstraightened Harry's bed and made him more comfortable. The weakness had\npassed, leaving a numbed and hardened feeling as though she had turned\nto wood; and when, a little later, she looked out of the door to wave\ngood-bye to Lucy and Jenny, she was amazed to find that she felt almost\nindifferent. Every emotion, even her capacity for physical sensation,\nseemed to respond to the immediate need of her, to the exhaustless\ndemands on her bodily strength and her courage. As long as there was\nanything to be done, she was sure now that she should be able to keep up\nand not lose control of herself.\n\n\"May we come back soon, mamma?\" asked Lucy, standing on tiptoe to wave\nat her.\n\n\"Just as soon as Harry is well, darling. Ask grandpa to pray that he\nwill be well soon, won't you?\"\n\n\"Jenny'll pay,\" lisped the baby, from Doctor Fraser's arms, where, with\nher cap on one side and her little feet kicking delightedly, she was\nbeguiled by the promise of a birthday cake over at grandma's.\n\n\"I'll look in again in an hour or two,\" said the doctor in his jovial\ntones as he swung down the stairs. Then Lucy pattered after him, and in\na few minutes the front door closed loudly behind them, and Virginia\nwent back to the nursery, where Harry was coughing the strangling cough\nthat tore at her heart.\n\nBy nightfall he had grown very ill, and when the next dawn came, it\nfound her, wan, haggard, and sleepless, fighting beside the old doctor\nunder the improvised tent of sheets which covered the little bed. The\nthought of self went from her so utterly that she only remembered she\nwas alive when Marthy brought food and tried to force it between her\nlips.\n\n\"But you must swallow it, ma'am. You need to keep up your strength.\"\n\n\"How do you think he looks, Marthy? Does he feel quite so hot to you? He\nseems to breathe a little better, doesn't he?\"\n\nAnd during the long day, while the patch of sunlight grew larger, lay\nfor an hour like yellow silk on the windowsill, and then slowly dwindled\ninto the shadow, she sat, without moving, between the bed and the table\non which stood the bottles of medicine, a glass, and a pitcher of water.\nWhen the child slept, overcome by the stupor of fever, she watched him,\nwith drawn breath, lest he should fade away from her if she were to\nwithdraw her passionate gaze for an instant. When he awoke and lay\nmoaning, while his little body shook with the long stifling gasps that\nstruggled between his lips, she held him tightly clasped in her arms,\nwith a woman's pathetic faith in the power of a physical pressure to\nwithstand the immaterial forces of death. A hundred times during the day\nhe aroused himself, stirred faintly in his feverish sleep, and called\nher name in the voice of terror with which he used to summon her in the\nnight.\n\n\"It isn't the black man now, darling, is it? Remember there is no black\nman, and mamma is close here beside you.\"\n\nNo, it wasn't the black man; he wasn't afraid of the darkness now, but\nhe would like to have his ship. When she brought it, he played for a\nfew minutes, and dozed off still grasping the toy in his hands. At\ntwelve the doctor came, and again at four, when the patch of sunlight,\nby which she told the hours, had begun to grow fainter on the\nwindowsill.\n\n\"He is better, doctor, isn't he? Don't you notice that he struggles less\nwhen he breathes?\"\n\nHe looked at her with an expression of contemplative pity in his old\nwatery eyes, and she gave a little cry and stretched out her hands,\nblindly groping.\n\n\"Doctor, I'll do anything--anything, if you'll only save him.\" An\nimpulse to reach beyond him to some impersonal, cosmic Power greater\nthan he was, made her add desperately: \"I'll never ask for anything else\nin my life. I'll give up everything, if you'll only promise me that you\nwill save him.\"\n\nShe stood up, drawing her thin figure, as tense as a cord, to its full\nheight, and beneath the flowered blue dressing-gown her shoulder blades\nshowed sharply under their fragile covering of flesh. Her hair, which\nshe had not undone since the first shock of Harry's illness, hung in\nstraight folds on either side of her pallid and haggard face. Even the\ncolour of her eyes seemed to have changed, for their flower-like blue\nhad faded to a dull grey.\n\n\"If we can pull through the night, Jinny,\" he said huskily, and added\nalmost sternly, \"you must bear up, so much depends on you. Remember, it\nis your first serious illness, but it may not be your last. You've got\nto take the pang of motherhood along with the pleasure, my dear----\"\n\nThe pang of motherhood! Long after he had left her, and she had heard\nthe street gate click behind him, she sat motionless, repeating the\nwords, by Harry's little bed. The pang of motherhood--this was what she\nwas suffering--the poignant suspense, the quivering waiting, the abject\nterror of loss, the unutterable anguish of the nerves, as if one's heart\nwere being slowly torn out of one's body. She had had the joy, and now\nshe was enduring the inevitable pang which is bound up, like a hidden\npulse, in every mortal delight. Never pleasure without pain, never\ngrowth without decay, never life without death. The Law ruled even in\nlove, and all the pitiful little sacrifices which one offered to\nOmnipotence, which one offered blindly to the Power that might separate,\nwith a flaming sword, the cause from the effect, the substance from the\nshadow--what of them? While Harry lay there, wrapped in that burning\nstupor, she prayed, not as she had been taught to pray in her childhood,\nnot with the humble and resigned worship of civilization, but in the\nwild and threatening lament of a savage who seeks to reach the ears of\nan implacable deity. In the last twenty-four hours the Unknown Power she\nentreated had changed, in her imagination, to an idol who responded only\nto the shedding of blood.\n\n\"Only spare my child and I will give up everything else!\" she cried from\nthe extremity of her anguish. The sharp edge of the bed hurt her bosom\nand she pressed frantically against it. Had it been possible to lacerate\nher body, to cut her flesh with knives, she might have found some\npitiable comfort in the mere physical pain. Beside the agony in her\nmind, a pang of the flesh would have been almost a joy.\n\nWhen at last she rose from her knees, Harry lay, breathing quietly,\nwith his eyes closed and the toy ship on the blanket beside him. His\nchildish features had shrunken in a day until they appeared only half\ntheir natural size, and a faint bluish tinge had crept over his face,\nwiping out all the sweet rosy colour. But he had swallowed a few\nspoonfuls of his last cup of broth, and the painful choking sound had\nceased for a minute. The change, slight as it was, had followed so\nclosely upon her prayers, that, while it lasted, she passed through one\nof those spiritual crises which alter the whole aspect of life. An\nemotion, which was a curious mixture of superstitious terror and\nreligious faith, swept over her, reviving and invigorating her heart.\nShe had abased herself in the dust before God--she had offered all her\nlife to Him if He would spare her child--and had He not answered? Might\nnot Harry's illness, indeed, have been sent to punish her for her\nneglect? A shudder of abhorrence passed through her as she remembered\nthe fox-hunt, and her passion of jealousy. The roll of blue silk, lying\nupstairs in a closet in the third storey, appeared to her now not as a\ntemptation to vanity, but as a reminder of the mortal sin which had\nalmost cost her the life of her child. And suppose God had not stopped\nher in time--suppose she had gone to Atlantic City as Oliver had begged\nher to do?\n\nIn the room the light faded softly, melting first like frost from the\nmirror in the corner beyond the Japanese screen, creeping slowly across\nthe marble surface of the washstand, lingering, in little ripples, on\nthe green sash of the windowsill. Out of doors it was still day, and\nfrom where she sat by Harry's bed, she could see, under the raised tent,\nevery detail of the street standing out distinctly in the grey\ntwilight. Across the way the houses were beginning to show lights at the\nwindows, and the old lamplighter was balancing himself unsteadily on his\nladder at the corner. On the mulberry tree near the crossing the broad\nbronze leaves swung back and forth in the wind, which sighed restlessly\naround the house and drove the naked tendrils of a summer vine against\nthe green shutters at the window. The fire had gone down, and after she\nhad made it up very softly, she bent over Harry again, as if she feared\nthat he might have slipped out of her grasp while she had crossed the\nroom.\n\n\"If he only lives, I will let everything else go. I will think of\nnothing except my children. It will make no difference to me if I do\nlook ten years older than Abby does. Nothing on earth will make any\ndifference to me, if only God will let him get well.\"\n\nAnd with the vow, it seemed to her that she laid her youth down on the\naltar of that unseen Power whose mercy she invoked. Let her prayer only\nbe heard and she would demand nothing more of life--she would spend all\nher future years in the willing service of love. Was it possible that\nshe had imagined herself unhappy thirty-six hours ago--thirty-six hours\nago when her child was not threatened? As she looked back on her past\nlife, it seemed to her that every minute had been crowned with\nhappiness. Even the loss of her newborn baby appeared such a little\nthing--such a little thing beside the loss of Harry, her only son. Mere\nfreedom from anxiety showed to her now as a condition of positive bliss.\n\nSix o'clock struck, and Marthy knocked at the door with a cup of milk.\n\"Do you think he'll be able to swallow any of it?\" she asked, and there\nwere tears in her eyes.\n\n\"He is better, Marthy, I am sure he is better. Has mother been here this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"She stopped at the door, but she didn't like to come in on account of\nthe children. They are both well, she says, and send you their love. Do\nyou want any more water in the kettle, ma'am?\"\n\nThe kettle, which was simmering away beside Harry's bed, under the tent\nof sheets, was passed to Marthy through the crack in the door; and when\nin a few minutes the girl returned with fresh water, Virginia whispered\nto her that he had taken three spoonfuls of milk.\n\n\"And he let me mop his throat with turpentine,\" she said in quivering\ntones. \"I am sure--oh, I am sure he is better.\"\n\n\"I am praying every minute,\" replied Marthy, weeping; and it seemed\nsuddenly to Virginia that a wave of understanding passed between her and\nthe ignorant mulatto girl, whom she had always regarded as of different\nclay from herself. With that miraculous power of grief to level all\nthings, she felt that the barriers of knowledge, of race, of all the\npitiful superiorities with which human beings have obscured and\ndecorated the underlying spirit of life, had melted back into the\nnothingness from which they had emerged in the beginning. This feeling\nof oneness, which would have surprised and startled her yesterday,\nappeared so natural to her now, that, after the first instant of\nrecognition, she hardly thought of it again.\n\n\"Thank you, Marthy,\" she answered gently, and closing the door, went\nback to her chair under the raised corner of the sheet. When the doctor\ncame at nine o'clock she was sitting there, in the same position, so\nstill and tense that she seemed hardly to be breathing, so ashen grey\nthat the sheet hanging above her head showed deadly white by contrast\nwith her face. In those three hours she knew that the clinging tendrils\nof personal desire had relaxed their hold forever on life and youth.\n\n\"If he doesn't get worse, we'll pull through,\" said the doctor, turning\nfrom his examination of Harry to lay his hand, which felt as heavy as\nlead, on her shoulder. \"We've an even chance--if his heart doesn't go\nback on us.\" And he added, \"Most mothers are good nurses, Jinny, but I\nnever saw a better one than you are--unless it was your own mother. You\nget it from her, I reckon. I remember when you went through diphtheria\nhow she sent your father to stay with one of the neighbours, and shut\nherself up with old Ailsey to nurse you. I don't believe she undressed\nor closed her eyes for a week.\"\n\nHer own mother! So she was not the only one who had suffered this\nanguish--other women, many women, had been through it before she was\nborn. It was a part of that immemorial pang of motherhood of which the\nold doctor had spoken. \"But, was I ever in danger? Was I as ill as\nHarry?\" she asked.\n\n\"For twenty-four hours we thought you'd slip through our fingers every\nminute. 'Twas only your mother's nursing that kept you alive--I've told\nher that twenty times. She never spared herself an instant, and, it may\nhave been my imagination, but she never seemed to me to be the same\nwoman afterwards. Something had gone out of her.\"\n\nNow she understood, now she knew, something had gone out of her, also,\nand this something was youth. No woman who had fought with death for a\nchild could ever be the same afterwards--could ever value again the\nsmall personal joys, when she carried the memory of supreme joy or\nsupreme anguish buried within her heart. She remembered that her mother\nhad never seemed young to her, not even in her earliest childhood; and\nshe understood now why this had been so, why the deeper experiences of\nlife rob the smaller ones of all vividness, of all poignancy. It had\nbeen so easy for her mother to give up little things, to deny herself,\nto do without, to make no further demands on life after the great\ndemands had been granted her. How often had she said unthinkingly in her\ngirlhood, \"Mother, you never want anything for yourself.\" Ah, she knew\nnow what it meant, and with the knowledge a longing seized her to throw\nherself into her mother's arms, to sob out her understanding and her\nsympathy, to let her feel before it was too late that she comprehended\nevery step of the way, every throb of the agony!\n\n\"I'd spend the night with you, Jinny, if I didn't have to be with Milly\nCarrington, who has two children down with it,\" said the doctor; \"but if\nthere's any change, get Marthy to come for me. If not, I'll be sure to\nlook in again before daybreak.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, she moved the night lamp to the corner of the\nwashstand, and after swallowing hastily a cup of coffee which Marthy had\nbrought to her before the doctor's visit, and which had grown quite\ntepid and unpalatable, she resumed her patient watch under the raised\nend of the sheet. The whole of life, the whole of the universe even, had\nnarrowed down for her into that faint circle of light which the lamp\ndrew around Harry's little bed. It was as if this narrow circle beat\nwith a separate pulse, divided from the rest of existence by its\nintense, its throbbing vitality. Here was concentrated for her all that\nthe world had to offer of hope, fear, rapture, or anguish. The\nlittleness and the terrible significance of the individual destiny were\ngathered into that faintly quivering centre of space--so small a part of\nthe universe, and yet containing the whole universe within itself!\n\nOutside, in the street, she could see a half-bared bough of the mulberry\ntree, arching against a square of window, from which the white curtains\nwere drawn back; and in order to quiet her broken and disjointed\nthoughts, she began to count the leaves as they fell, one by one,\nturning softly at the stem, and then floating out into the darkness\nbeyond. \"One. Two. How long that leaf takes to loosen. He is better. The\ndoctor certainly thought that he was better. If he only gets well. O\nGod, let him get well, and I will serve you all my life!\nThree--four--five--For twenty-four hours we thought you would slip\nthrough our fingers. Somebody said that--somebody--it must have been the\ndoctor. And he was talking of me, not of Harry. That was twenty-six\nyears ago, and my mother was enduring then all this agony that I am\nfeeling to-night. Twenty-six years ago--perhaps at this very hour, she\nsat beside me alone as I am sitting now by Harry. And before that other\nwomen went through it. All the world over, wherever there are\nmothers--north, south, east, west--from the first baby that was born on\nthe earth--they have every one suffered what I am suffering now--for it\nis the pang of motherhood! To escape it one must escape birth and escape\nthe love that is greater than one's self.\" And she understood suddenly\nthat suffering and love are inseparable, that when one loves another\nmore than one's self, one has opened the gate by which anguish will\nenter. She had forgotten to count the leaves, and when she remembered\nand looked again, the last one had fallen. Against the parted white\ncurtains, the naked bough arched black and solitary. Even the small\nsilent birds that had swayed dejectedly to and fro on the branches all\nday had flown off into the darkness. Presently, the light in the window\nwent out, and as the hours wore on, a fine drizzling rain began to fall,\nas soft as tears, from the starless sky over the mulberry tree. A sense\nof isolation greater than any she had ever known attacked her like a\nphysical chill, and rising, she went over to the fire and stirred the\npile of coal into a flame. She was alone in her despair, and she\nrealized, with a feeling of terror, that one is always alone when one\ndespairs, that there is a secret chamber in every soul where neither\nlove nor sympathy can follow one. If Oliver were here beside her--if he\nwere standing close to her in that throbbing circle around the bed--she\nwould still be separated from him by the immensity of that inner space\nwhich is not measured by physical distances. \"No, even if he were here,\nhe could not reach me,\" she said, and an instant later, with one of\nthose piercing illuminations which visit even perfectly normal women in\nmoments of great intensity, she thought quickly, \"If every woman told\nthe truth to herself, would she say that there is something in her which\nlove has never reached?\" Then, reproaching herself because she had left\nthe bed for a minute, she went back again and bent over the unconscious\nchild, her whole slender body curving itself passionately into an\nembrace. His face was ashen white, except where the skin around his\nmouth was discoloured with a faint bluish tinge. His flesh, even his\nbones, appeared to have shrunk almost away in twenty-four hours. It was\nimpossible to imagine that he was the rosy, laughing boy, who had\ncrawled into her arms only two nights ago. The disease held him like\nsome unseen spiritual enemy, against which all physical weapons were as\nuseless as the little toys of a child. How could one fight that sinister\npower which had removed him to an illimitable distance while he was\nstill in her arms? The troubled stupor, which had in it none of the\nquiet and the restfulness of sleep, terrorized her as utterly as if it\nhad been the personal spirit of evil. The invisible forces of Life and\nDeath seemed battling in the quivering air within that small circle of\nlight.\n\nWhile she bent over him, he stirred, raised himself, and then fell back\nin a paroxysm of coughing. The violence of the spasm shook his fragile\nlittle body as a rough wind shakes a flower on a stalk. Over his face\nthe bluish tinge spread like a shadow, and into his eyes there came the\nexpression of wondering terror which she had seen before only in the\neyes of young startled animals. For an instant it seemed almost as if\nthe devil of disease were wrestling inside of him, as if the small\nvital force she called life would be beaten out in the struggle. Then\nthe agony passed; the strangling sound ceased, and he grew quiet, while\nshe wiped the poison from his mouth and nostrils, and made him swallow a\nfew drops of milk out of a teaspoon.\n\nAt the moment, while she fell on her knees by his bedside, it seemed to\nher that she had reached that deep place beyond which there is nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You've pulled him through. We'll have him out of bed before many days\nnow,\" said the old doctor at daybreak, and he added cheerfully, \"By the\nway, your husband came in the front door with me. He wanted to rush up\nhere at once, but I'm keeping him away because he is obliged to go back\nto the bank.\"\n\n\"Poor Oliver,\" said Virginia gently. \"It is terrible on him. He must be\nso anxious.\" But even while she uttered the words, she was conscious of\na curious sensation of unreality, as though she were speaking of a\nperson whom she had known in another life. It was three days since she\nhad seen Oliver, and in those three days she had lived and died many\ntimes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF THE SOUTH\n\n\n\"Father, I want to marry John Henry,\" said Susan, just as she had said\nalmost ten years ago, \"Father, I want to go to college.\"\n\nIt was a March afternoon, ashen and windy, with flocks of small fleecy\nclouds hurrying across a changeable blue sky, and the vague, roving\nscents of early spring in the air. After his dinner, which he had taken\nfor more than fifty years precisely at two o'clock, Cyrus had sat down\nfor a peaceful pipe on the back porch before returning to the office.\nBetween the sunken bricks in the little walled-in yard, blades of vivid\ngreen grass had shot up, seeking light out of darkness, and along the\ngrey wooden ledge of the area the dauntless sunflowers were unfolding\ntheir small stunted leaves. On the railing of the porch a moth-eaten\ncat--the only animal for whom Cyrus entertained the remotest\nrespect--was contentedly licking the shabby fur on her side.\n\n\"Father, I want to marry John Henry,\" repeated Susan, raising her voice\nto a higher key and towering like a flesh and blood image of Victory\nover the sagging cane chair in which he sat.\n\nTaking his pipe from his mouth, he looked up at her; and so little had\nhe altered in ten years, that the thought flashed through her mind that\nhe had actually suffered no change of expression since the afternoon on\nwhich she had asked him to send her to college. As a man he may not have\nbeen impressive, but as a defeating force who could say that he had not\nattained his fulfilment? It was as if the instinct of patriarchal\ntyranny had entrenched itself in his person as in a last stronghold of\nthe disappearing order. When he died many things would pass away out of\nDinwiddie--not only the soul and body of Cyrus Treadwell, but the\nvanishing myth of the \"strong man,\" the rule of the individual despot,\nthe belief in the inalienable right of the father to demand blood\nsacrifices. For in common with other men of his type, he stood equally\nfor industrial advancement and for domestic immobility. The body social\nmight move, but the units that formed the body social must remain\nstationary.\n\n\"Well, I don't think I'd worry about marrying, if I were you,\" he\nreplied, not unkindly, for Susan inspired him with a respect against\nwhich he had struggled in vain. \"You are very comfortable now, ain't\nyou? And I'll see that you are well provided for after my death. John\nHenry hasn't anything except his salary, I reckon.\"\n\nMarriage as an economic necessity was perfectly comprehensible to him,\nbut it was difficult for him to conceive of anybody indulging in it\nsimply as a matter of sentiment. That April afternoon was so far away\nnow that it had ceased to exist even as an historical precedent.\n\n\"Yes, but I want to marry him, and I am going to,\" replied Susan\ndecisively.\n\n\"What arrangements would you make about your mother? It seems to me that\nyour mother needs your attention.\"\n\n\"Of course I couldn't leave mother. If you agree to it, John Henry is\nwilling to come here to live as long as I have to look after her. If\nnot, I shall take her away with me; I have spoken to her, and she is\nperfectly willing to go.\"\n\nThe ten years which had left Cyrus at a standstill had developed his\ndaughter from a girl into a woman. She spoke with the manner of one who\nrealizes that she holds the situation in her hands, and he yielded to\nthis assumption of strength as he would have yielded ten years ago had\nshe been clever enough to use it against him. It was his own manner in a\nmore attractive guise, if he had only known it; and the Treadwell\ndetermination to get the thing it wanted most was asserting itself in\nSusan's desire to win John Henry quite as effectively as it had asserted\nitself in Cyrus's passion to possess the Dinwiddie and Central Railroad.\nThough the ends were different, the quality which moved father and\ndaughter towards these different ends was precisely the same. In Cyrus,\nit was force degraded; in Susan, it was force refined; but the peculiar\nattribute which distinguished and united them was the possession of the\npower to command events.\n\n\"Take your mother away?\" he repeated. \"Why, where on earth would you\ntake her?\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to agree to John Henry's coming here. It won't make\nany difference to you, of course. You needn't see him except at the\ntable.\"\n\n\"But what would James say about it?\" he returned, with the cowardice\nnatural to the habitual bully. The girl had character, certainly, and\nthough he disliked character in a woman, he was obliged to admit that\nshe had not failed to make an impression.\n\n\"James won't care, and besides,\" she added magnificently, \"it is none of\nhis business.\"\n\n\"And it's none of mine, either, I reckon,\" said Cyrus, with a chuckle.\n\n\"Well, of course, it's more of mine,\" agreed Susan, and her delicious\nlaugh drowned his chuckle.\n\nShe had won her point, and strange to say, she had pleased him rather\nthan otherwise. He had suddenly a comfortable feeling in his digestive\norgans as well as a sense of virtue in his soul. It was impossible not\nto feel proud of her as she towered there above him with her superb\nbody, as fine and as supple as the body of a race horse, and her\nsplendid courage that made him wish while he looked at her that she,\ninstead of James, had been born a male. She was not pretty--she had\nnever been pretty--but he realized for the first time that there might\nbe something better even for a woman than beauty.\n\n\"Thank you, father,\" she said as she turned away, and he was glad again\nto feel that she had conquered him. To be conquered by one's own blood\nwas different from being conquered by a business acquaintance.\n\n\"You mustn't disturb the household, you know,\" he said, but his voice\ndid not sound as dry as he had endeavoured to make it.\n\n\"I shan't disturb anybody,\" responded Susan, with the amiability of a\nwoman who, having gained her point, can afford to be pleasant. Then,\nwheeling about suddenly on the threshold, she added, \"By the way, I\nforgot to tell you that Mandy was here three times this morning asking\nto see you. She is in trouble about her son. He was arrested for\nshooting a policeman over at Cross's Corner, you know, and the people\ndown there are so enraged, she's afraid of a lynching. You read about it\nin the paper, didn't you?\"\n\nYes, he had read about the shooting--Cross's Corner was only three miles\naway--but, if he had ever known the name of Mandy's son, he had\nforgotten it so completely that seeing it in print had suggested nothing\nto his mind.\n\n\"Well, she doesn't expect me to interfere, does she?\" he asked shortly.\n\n\"I believe she thought you might go over and do something--I don't know\nwhat--help her engage a lawyer probably. She was very pitiable, but\nafter all, what can one do for a negro that shoots a policeman? There's\nMiss Willy calling me!\"\n\nShe ran indoors, and taking his pipe, which was still smoking, from his\nmouth, Cyrus leaned back in his chair and stared intently at the small\nfleecy clouds in the west. The cat, having cleaned herself to her\nsatisfaction, jumped down from the railing, and after rubbing against\nhis thin legs, leaped gently into his lap.\n\n\"Tut-tut!\" he remarked grimly; but he did not attempt to dislodge the\nanimal, and it may be that some secret part of him was gratified by the\nattention. He was still sitting there some minutes later, when he heard\nthe warning click of the back gate, and the figure of Mandy, appeared at\nthe corner of the kitchen wall. Rising from his chair, he shook the cat\nfrom his knees, and descending the steps, met the woman in the centre of\nthe walk, where a few hardy dandelions were flattened like buttons\nbetween the bricks.\n\n\"Howdy, Mandy. I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with that\nboy of yours.\" He saw at once that she was racked by a powerful emotion,\nand any emotion affected him unpleasantly as something extravagant and\nindecent. Sweat had broken out in glistening clusters over her face and\nneck, and her eyes, under the stray wisps of hair, had in them an\nexpression of dumb and uncomprehending submission.\n\n\"Ain't you gwineter git 'im away, Marster?\" she began, and stronger even\nthan her terror was the awe of Cyrus which subdued her voice to a tone\nof servile entreaty.\n\n\"Why did he shoot a policeman? He knew he'd hang for it,\" returned Cyrus\nsharply, and he added, \"Of course I can't get him away. He'll have to\ntake his deserts. Your race has got to learn that when you break the\nlaw, you must pay for it.\"\n\nAt first he had made as if to push by her, but when she did not move, he\nthought better of it and waited for her to speak. The sound of her heavy\nbreathing, like the breathing of some crouching beast, awoke in him a\ncurious repulsion. If only one could get rid of such creatures after\ntheir first youth was over! If only every careless act could perish with\nthe impulse that led to it! If only the dried husks of pleasure did not\nturn to weapons against one! These thoughts--or disjointed snatches of\nthoughts like these--passed in a confused whirl through his brain as he\nstood there. For an instant it was almost as if his accustomed lucidity\nof purpose had deserted him; then the disturbance ceased, and with the\nrenewal of order in his mind, his life-long habit of prompt decision\nreturned to him.\n\n\"Your race has got to learn that when you break the law you must pay for\nit,\" he repeated--for on that sound principle of justice he felt that he\nmust unalterably take his stand.\n\n\"He's all de boy I'se got, Marster,\" rejoined the negress, with an\nindifference to the matter of justice which had led others of her colour\ninto those subterranean ways where abstract principles are not. \"You\nain' done furgot 'im, Marster,\" she added piteously. \"He 'uz born jes\ntwo mont's atter Miss Lindy turnt me outer hyer--en he's jes ez w'ite ez\nef'n he b'longed ter w'ite folks.\"\n\nBut she had gone too far--she had outraged that curious Anglo-Saxon\ninstinct in Cyrus which permitted him to sin against his race's\nintegrity, yet forbade him to acknowledge, even to himself, that he bore\nany part in the consequences of that sin. Illogical, he might have\nadmitted, but there are some truths so poisonous that no honest man\ncould breathe the same air with them.\n\nTaking out his pocket-book, he slowly drew a fifty dollar bill from its\ninnermost recesses, and as slowly unfolded it. He always handled money\nin that careful fashion--a habit which he had inherited from his father\nand his grandfather before him, and of which he was entirely\nunconscious. Filtering down through so many generations, the mannerism\nhad ceased at last to be merely a physical peculiarity, and had become\nstrangely spiritual in its suggestion. The craving for possession, the\nsingleness of desire, the tenacity of grasp, the dread of\nrelinquishment, the cold-blooded determination to keep intact the thing\nwhich it had cost so much to acquire--all that was bound up in the\nspirit of Cyrus Treadwell, and all that would pass at last with that\nspirit from off the earth, was expressed in the gesture with which he\nheld out the bit of paper to the woman who had asked for his help. \"Take\nthis--it is all I can do for you,\" he said, \"and don't come whining\naround me any more. Black or white, the man that commits a murder has\ngot to hang for it.\"\n\nA sound broke from the negress that resembled a human cry of grief less\nthan it did the inarticulate moan of an animal in mortal pain. Then it\nstopped suddenly, strangled by that dull weight of usage beneath which\nthe primal impulse in her was crushed back into silence. Instinctively,\nas if in obedience to some reflex action, she reached out and took the\nmoney from his hand, and still instinctively, with the dazed look of one\nwho performs in delirium the customary movements of every day, she fell\nback, holding her apron deprecatingly aside while he brushed past her.\nAnd in her eyes as she gazed after him there dawned the simple wonder of\nthe brute that asks of Life why it suffers.\n\nBeyond the alley into which the gate opened, Cyrus caught sight of\nGabriel's erect figure hurrying down the side street in the direction of\nthe Old Ladies' Home, and calling out to him, he scrambled over the ash\nheaps and tomato cans, and emerged, irritated but smiling, into the\nsunlight.\n\n\"I'm on my way to the bank. We'll walk down together,\" he remarked\nalmost gently, for, though he disapproved of Gabriel's religious\nopinions and distrusted his financial judgment, the war-like little\nrector represented the single romance of his life.\n\n\"I had intended stopping at the Old Ladies' Home, but I'll go on with\nyou instead,\" responded Gabriel. \"I've just had a message from one of\nour old servants calling me down to Cross's Corner,\" he pursued, \"so I'm\nin a bit of a hurry. That's a bad thing, that murder down there\nyesterday, and I'm afraid it will mean trouble for the negroes. Mr.\nBlylie, who came to market this morning, told me a crowd had tried to\nlynch the fellow last night.\"\n\n\"Well, they've got to hang when they commit hanging crimes,\" replied\nCyrus stubbornly. \"There's no way out of that. It's just, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" admitted Gabriel, \"though, for my part, I've a\nfeeling against capital punishment--except, of course, in cases of rape,\nwhere, I confess, my blood turns against me.\"\n\n\"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth--that's the law of God, ain't\nit?\"\n\n\"The old law, yes--but why not quote the law of Christ instead?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do--not with the negroes,\" returned Cyrus, who entertained\nfor the Founder of Christianity something of the sentimental respect\nmingled with an innate distrust of His common-sense with which he\nregarded His disciple.\n\n\"We can't condemn it until we've tried it,\" said Gabriel thoughtfully,\nand he went on after a moment:\n\n\"The terrible thing for us about the negroes is that they are so grave\na responsibility--so grave a responsibility. Of course, we aren't to\nblame--we didn't bring them here; and yet I sometimes feel as if we had\nreally done so.\"\n\nThis was a point of view which Cyrus had never considered, and he felt\nan immediate suspicion of it. It looked, somehow, as if it were\ninsidiously leading the way to an appeal for money.\n\n\"It's the best thing that could have happened to them,\" he replied\nshortly. \"If they'd remained in Africa, they'd never have been civilized\nor--or Christianized.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is just where the responsibility rests on us. We stand for\ncivilization to them; we stand even--or at least we used to stand--for\nChristianity. They haven't learned yet to look above or beyond us, and\nthe example we set them is one that they are condemned, for sheer lack\nof any finer vision, to follow. The majority of them are still hardly\nmore than uneducated children, and that very fact makes an appeal to\none's compassion which becomes at times almost unbearable.\"\n\nBut this was more than Cyrus could stand even from the rector, whose\nconversation he usually tolerated because of the perverse, inexplicable\nliking he felt for the man. The charm that Gabriel exercised over him\nwas almost feminine in its subtlety and in its utter defiance of any\nrational sanction. It may have been that his nature, incapable though it\nwas of love, was not entirely devoid of the rarer capacity for\nfriendship--or it may have been that, with the inscrutable irony which\nappears to control all human attractions, the caged brutality in his\nheart was soothed by the unconscious flattery of the other's belief in\nhim. Now, however, he felt that Gabriel's highfaluting nonsense was\ncarrying him away. It was well enough to go on like that in the pulpit;\nbut on week days, when there was business to think of and every minute\nmight mean the loss of a dollar, there was no use dragging in either\nreligion or sentiment. Had he put his thoughts plainly, he would\nprobably have said: \"That's not business, Gabriel. The trouble with\nyou--and with most of you old-fashioned Virginians--is that you don't\nunderstand the first principles of business.\" These words, indeed, were\nalmost on his lips, when, catching the rector's innocent glance\nwandering round to him, he contented himself with remarking satirically:\n\n\"Well, you were always up in the clouds. It doesn't hurt you, I reckon,\nthough I doubt if it does much toward keeping your pot boiling.\"\n\n\"I must turn off here,\" said Gabriel gently. \"It's the shortest way to\nCross's Corner.\"\n\n\"Do you think any good will come of your going?\"\n\n\"Probably not--but I couldn't refuse.\"\n\nMuch as he respected Cyrus, he was not sorry to part from him, for their\nwalk together had left him feeling suddenly old and incompetent to\nbattle with the problems of life. He knew that Cyrus, even though he\nliked him, considered him a bit of a fool, and with a humility which was\nunusual in him (for in his heart he was absolutely sure that his own\nconvictions were right and that Cyrus's were wrong) he began to ask\nhimself if, by any chance, the other's verdict could be secretly\njustified. Was he in reality the failure that Cyrus believed him to be?\nOr was it merely that he had drifted into that \"depressing view\" of\nexistence against which he so earnestly warned his parishioners? Perhaps\nit wasn't Cyrus after all who had produced this effect. Perhaps the\ntouch of indigestion he had felt after dinner had not entirely\ndisappeared. Perhaps it meant that he was \"getting on\"--sixty-five his\nlast birthday. Perhaps--but already the March wind, fresh and\nbud-scented, was blowing away his despondency. Already he was beginning\nto feel again that fortifying conviction that whatever was unpleasant\ncould not possibly be natural.\n\nAhead of him the straight ashen road flushed to pale red where it\nclimbed a steep hillside, and when he gained the top, the country lay\nbefore him in all the magic loveliness of early spring. Out of the rosy\nearth innumerable points of tender green were visible in the sunlight\nand invisible again beneath the faintly rippling shadows that filled the\nhollows. From every bough, from every bush, from every creeper which\nclung trembling to the rail fences, this wave of green, bursting through\nthe sombre covering of winter, quivered, as delicate as foam, in the\nbrilliant sunshine. On either side labourers were working, and where the\nploughs pierced the soil they left narrow channels of darkness.\n\nIn the soul of Gabriel, that essence of the spring, which is immortally\nyoung and restless, awakened and gave him back his youth, as it gave the\nnew grass to the fields and the longing for joy to the hearts of the\nploughmen. He forgot that he was \"getting on.\" He forgot the unnatural\ndepression which had made him imagine for a moment that the world was a\nmore difficult place than he had permitted himself to believe--so\ndifficult a place, indeed, that for some people there could be no\nsolution of its injustice, its brutality, its dissonance, its\ninequalities. The rapture in the song of the bluebirds was sweeter than\nthe voice of Cyrus to which he had listened. And in a meadow on the\nright, an old grey horse, scarred, dim-eyed, spavined, stood resting one\ncrooked leg, while he gazed wistfully over the topmost rail of the fence\ninto the vivid green of the distance--for into his aching old bones,\nalso, there had passed a little of that longing for joy which was born\nof the miraculous softness and freshness of the spring. To him, as well\nas to Gabriel and to the ploughmen and to the bluebirds flitting, like\nbits of fallen sky, along the \"snake fences,\" Nature, the great healer,\nhad brought her annual gift of the resurrection of hope.\n\n\"Cyrus means well,\" thought Gabriel, with a return of that natural\nself-confidence without which no man can exist happily and make a\nliving. \"He means well, but he takes a false view of life.\" And he added\nafter a minute: \"It's odd how the commercial spirit seems to suck a man\ndry when it once gets a hold on him.\"\n\nHe walked on rapidly, leaving the old horse and the ploughmen behind\nhim, and around his energetic little figure the grey dust, as fine as\npowder, spun in swirls and eddies before the driving wind, which had\ngrown boisterous. As he moved there alone in the deserted road, with his\nlong black coat flapping against his legs, he appeared so insignificant\nand so unheroic that an observer would hardly have suspected that the\ngreatest belief on the earth--the belief in Life--in its universality\nin spite of its littleness, in its justification in spite of its\ncruelties--that this belief shone through his shrunken little body as a\nflame shines through a vase.\n\nAt the end of the next mile, midway between Dinwiddie and Cross's\nCorner, stood the small log cabin of the former slave who had sent for\nhim, and as he approached the narrow path that led, between oyster\nshells, from the main road to the single flat brown rock before the\ndoorstep, he noticed with pleasure how tranquil and happy the little\nrustic home appeared under the windy brightness of the March sky.\n\n\"People may say what they please, but there never were happier or more\ncontented creatures than the darkeys,\" he thought. \"I doubt if there's\nanother peasantry in the world that is half so well off or half so\npicturesque.\"\n\nA large yellow rooster, pecking crumbs from the threshold, began to\nscold shrilly, and at the sound, the old servant, a decrepit negress in\na blue gingham dress, hobbled out into the path and stood peering at him\nunder her hollowed palm. Her forehead was ridged and furrowed beneath\nher white turban, and her bleared old eyes looked up at him with a blind\nand groping effort at recognition.\n\n\"I got your message, Aunt Mehitable. Don't you know me?\"\n\n\"Is dat you, Marse Gabriel? I made sho' you wan' gwineter let nuttin'\nstop you f'om comin'.\"\n\n\"Don't I always come when you send for me?\"\n\n\"You sutney do, suh. Dat's de gospel trufe--you sutney do.\"\n\nAs he looked at her standing there in the strong sunlight, with her\npalsied hand, which was gnarled and roughened until it resembled the\nshell of a walnut, curving over her eyes, he felt that a quality at once\nalien and enigmatical separated her not only from himself, but from\nevery other man or woman who was born white instead of black. He had\nlived beside her all his life--and yet he could never understand her,\ncould never reach her, could never even discern the hidden stuff of\nwhich she was made. He could make laws for her, but no child of a white\nmother could tell whether those laws ever penetrated that surface\nimitation of the superior race and reached the innate differences of\nthought, feeling, and memory which constituted her being. Was it\ndevelopment or mimicry that had brought her up out of savagery and\nclothed her in her blue gingham dress and her white turban, as in the\noutward covering of civilization?\n\nHer look of crumbling age and the witch-like groping of her glance had\ncast a momentary spell over him. When it was gone, he said cheerfully:\n\n\"You mustn't be having troubles at your time of life, Aunt Mehitable,\"\nand in his voice there was the subtle recognition of all that she had\nmeant to his family in the past, of all that his family had meant to\nher. Her claim upon him was the more authentic because it existed only\nin his imagination, and in hers. The tie that knit them together was\nwoven of impalpable strands, but it was unbreakable while he and his\ngeneration were above the earth.\n\n\"Dar ain' no end er trouble, Marse Gabriel, ez long ez dar's yo' chillen\nen de chillen er yo' chillen ter come atter you. De ole ain' so\ntechy--dey lets de hornet's nes' hang in peace whar de Lawd put\nhit--but de young dey's diff'rent.\"\n\n\"I suppose the neighbourhood is stirred up about the murder. What in\nGod's name was that boy thinking of?\"\n\nThe old blood crimes that never ceased where the white and the black\nraces came together! The old savage folly and the new freedom! The old\nignorance, the old lack of understanding, and the new restlessness, the\nnew enmity!\n\n\"He wan' thinkin' er nuttin', Marse Gabriel. We ole uns kin set down en\nsteddy, but de young dey up en does wid dere brains ez addled ez de\ninside uv er bad aig. 'T wan' dat ar way in de old days w'en we all hed\nde say so ez ter w'at wuz en w'at wan't de way ter behave.\"\n\nLike an institution left from the ruins of the feudal system, which had\ncrumbled as all ancient and decrepit things must crumble when the wheels\nof progress roll over them, she stood there wrapped in the beliefs and\ncustoms of that other century to which she belonged. Her sentiments had\nclustered about the past, as his had done, until the border-line between\nthe romance and the actuality had vanished. She could not help him\nbecause she, also, possessed the retrospective, not the constructive,\nvision. He was not conscious of these thoughts, and yet, although he was\nunconscious of them, they coloured his reflections while he stood there\nin the sunlight, which had begun to fall aslant the blasted pine by the\nroadside. The wind had lowered until it came like the breath of spring,\nbud-scented, caressing, provocative. Even Gabriel, whose optimism lay in\nhis blood and bone rather than in his intellect, yielded for a moment\nto this call of the spring as one might yield to the delicious\nmelancholy of a vagrant mood. The long straight road, without bend or\nfork, had warmed in the paling sunlight to the colour of old ivory; in a\nneighbouring field a young maple tree rose in a flame of buds from the\nridged earth where the ploughing was over; and against the azure sky in\nthe south a flock of birds drifted up, like blown smoke, from the\nmarshes.\n\n\"Tell me your trouble, then,\" he said, dropping into the cane-seated\nchair she had brought out of the cabin and placed between the flat stone\nat the doorstep and the well-brink, on which the yellow rooster stood\nspreading his wings. But Aunt Mehitable had returned to the cabin, and\nwhen she reappeared she was holding out to him a cracked saucer on which\nthere was a piece of preserved watermelon rind and a pewter spoon.\n\n\"Dish yer is de ve'y same sort er preserves yo' mouf use'n ter water fur\nw'en you wuz a chile,\" she remarked as she handed the sweet to him.\nWhatever her anxiety or affliction could have been, the importance of\nhis visit had evidently banished it from her mind. She hovered over him\nas his mother may have done when he was in his cradle, while the\ncheerful self-effacement in which slavery had trained her lent a\npathetic charm to her manner.\n\n\"How peaceful it looks,\" he thought, sitting there, with the saucer in\nhis hand, and his eyes on the purple shadows that slanted over the\nploughed fields. \"You have a good view of the low-grounds, Aunt\nMehitable,\" he said aloud, and added immediately, \"What's that noise in\nthe road? Do you hear it?\"\n\nThe old woman shook her head.\n\n\"I'se got sorter hard er heahin', Marse Gabriel, but dar's al'ays a\ntur'able lot er fuss gwine on w'en de chillen begin ter come up f'om de\nfields. 'T wuz becase uv oner dem ar boys dat I sont fur you,\" she\npursued. \"He went plum outer his haid yestiddy en fout wid a w'ite man\ndown yonder at Cross's Co'nder, en dar's gwine ter be trouble about'n\nhit des ez sho' ez you live.\"\n\nSeated on the flat stone, with her hands hanging over her knees, and her\nturbaned head swaying gently back and forth as she talked, she waited as\ntranquilly as the rock waited for the inevitable processes of nature.\nThe patience in her look was the dumb patience of inanimate things; and\nher half-bared feet, protruding from the broken soles of her shoes, were\nencrusted with the earth of the fields until one could hardly\ndistinguish them from the ground on which they rested.\n\n\"It looks as if there was something like a fight down yonder by the\nblasted pine,\" said the rector, rising from his chair. \"I reckon I'd\nbetter go and see what they're quarrelling about.\"\n\nThe negress rose also, and her dim eyes followed him while he went down\nthe little path between the borders of oyster shells. As he turned into\nthe open stretch of the road, he glanced back at her, and stopping for a\nmoment, waved his hand with a gesture that was careless and reassuring.\nThe fight, or whatever it was that made the noise, was still some\ndistance ahead in the shadow of the pine-tree, and as he walked towards\nit he was thinking casually of other matters--of the wretched condition\nof the road after the winter rains, of the need of greater thrift among\nthe farmers, both white and black, of the touch of indigestion which\nstill troubled him. There was nothing to warn him that he was\napproaching the supreme event in his life, nothing to prepare him for a\nchange beside which all the changes of the past would appear as\nunsubstantial as shadows. His soul might have been the soul in the\ngrass, so little did its coming or its going affect the forces around\nhim.\n\n\"If this shooting pain keeps up, I'll have to get a prescription from\nDoctor Fraser,\" he thought, and the next minute he cried out suddenly:\n\"God help us!\" and began to run down the road in the direction of the\nblasted pine. There was hardly a breath between the instant when he had\nthought of his indigestion and the instant when he had called out\nsharply on the name of God, yet that flash of time had been long enough\nto change the ordinary man into the hero. The spark of greatness in his\nnature flamed up and irradiated all that had been merely dull and common\nclay a moment before. As he ran on, with his coat tails flapping around\nhim, and his thin legs wobbling from the unaccustomed speed at which he\nmoved, he was so unimposing a figure that only the Deity who judges the\nmotives, not the actions, of men would have been impressed by the\nspectacle. Even the three hearty brutes--and it took him but a glance to\nsee that two of them were drunk, and that the third, being a sober\nrascal, was the more dangerous--hardly ceased their merry torment of the\nyoung negro in their midst when he came up with them.\n\n\"I know that boy,\" he said. \"He is the grandson of Aunt Mehitable. What\nare you doing with him?\"\n\nA drunken laugh answered him, while the sober scoundrel--a lank, hairy\nne-er-do-well, with a tendency to epilepsy, whose name he remembered to\nhave heard--pushed him roughly to the roadside.\n\n\"You git out of this here mess, parson. We're goin' to teach this damn\nnigger a lesson, and I reckon when he's learned it in hell, he won't\nturn his grin on a white woman again in a jiffy.\"\n\n\"Fo' de Lawd, I didn't mean nuttin', Marster!\" screamed the boy, livid\nwith terror. \"I didn't know de lady was dar--fo' de Lawd Jesus, I\ndidn't! My foot jes slipped on de plank w'en I wuz crossin', en I\nknocked up agin her.\"\n\n\"He jostled her,\" observed one of the drunken men judicially, \"an' we'll\nbe roasted befo' we'll let a damn nigger jostle a white lady--even if\nshe ain't a lady--in these here parts.\"\n\nIn the rector's bone and fibre, drilled there by the ages that had\nshaped his character before he began to be, there was all the white\nman's horror of an insult to his womankind. But deeper even than this\nlay his personal feeling of responsibility for any creature whose\nfathers had belonged to him and had toiled in his service.\n\n\"I believe the boy is telling the truth,\" he said, and he added with one\nof his characteristic bursts of impulsiveness, \"but whether he is or\nnot, you are too drunk to judge.\"\n\nThere was going to be a battle, he saw, and in the swiftness with which\nhe discerned this, he made his eternal choice between the preacher and\nthe fighter. Stripping off his coat, he reached down for a stick from\nthe roadside; then spinning round on the three of them he struck out\nwith all his strength, while there floated before him the face of a man\nhe had killed in his first charge at Manassas. The old fury, the old\ntriumph, the old blood-stained splendour returned to him. He smelt the\nsmoke again, he heard the boom of the cannon, the long sobbing rattle of\nmusketry, and the thought stabbed through him, \"God forgive me for\nloving a fight!\"\n\nThen the fight stopped. There was a patter of feet in the dust as the\nyoung negro fled like a hare up the road in the direction of Dinwiddie.\nOne of the men leaped the fence and disappeared into the tangled thicket\nbeyond; while the other two, sobered suddenly, began walking slowly over\nthe ploughed ground on the right. Ten minutes later Gabriel was lying\nalone, with the blood oozing from his mouth, on the trodden weeds by the\nroadside. The shadow of the pine had not moved since he watched it; on\nthe flat rock in front of the cabin the old negress stood, straining her\neyes in the faint sunshine; and up the long road the March wind still\nblew, as soft, as provocative, as bud-scented.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD\n\nTHE ADJUSTMENT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE CHANGING ORDER\n\n\n\"So this is life,\" thought Virginia, while she folded her mourning veil,\nand laid it away in the top drawer of her bureau. Like all who are\nsuddenly brought face to face with tragedy, she felt at the moment that\nthere was nothing else in existence. All the sweetness of the past had\nvanished so utterly that she remembered it only as one remembers a dream\nfrom which one has abruptly awakened. Nothing remained except this\nhorrible sense of the pitiful insufficiency of life, of the inexorable\nfinality of death. It was a week since the rector's death, and in that\nweek she had passed out of her girlhood forever. Of all the things that\nshe had lived through, this alone had had the power to crush the hope in\nher and the odour of crape which floated through the crack of the drawer\nsickened her with its reminder of that agonized sense of loss which had\nsettled over her at the funeral. She was only thirty--the best of her\nlife should still be in the future--yet as she looked back at her white\nface in the mirror it seemed to her that she should never emerge from\nthe leaden hopelessness which had descended like a weight on her body.\nAbove the harsh black of her dress, which added ten years to her\nappearance, she saw the darkened circles rimming her eyes, the faded\npallor of her skin, the lustreless wave of her hair, which had once had\na satiny sheen on its ripples.\n\n\"Grief makes a person look like this,\" she thought. \"I shall never be a\ngirl again--Oliver was right: I am the kind to break early.\" Then,\nbecause to think of herself in the midst of such sorrow seemed to her\nalmost wicked, she turned away from the mirror, and laid her\ncrape-trimmed hat on the shelf in the wardrobe. She was wearing a dress\nof black Henrietta cloth, which had been borrowed from one of her\nneighbours who had worn mourning, and the blouse and sleeves hung with\nan exaggerated fullness over her thin arms and bosom. All that had\ndistinguished her beauty--the radiance, the colour the flower-like\ndelicacy of bloom and sweetness--these were blotted out by her grief and\nby the voluminous mourning dress of the nineties. A week had changed\nher, as even Harry's illness had not changed her, from a girl into a\nwoman; and horrible beyond belief, with the exception of her mother, it\nhad changed nothing else in the universe! The tragedy that had ruined\nher life had left the rest of the world--even the little world of\nDinwiddie--moving as serenely, as indifferently, on its way towards\neternity. On the morning of the funeral she had heard the same market\nwagons rumble over the cobblestones, the same droning songs of the\nhucksters, the same casual procession of feet on the pavement. A\npassionate indignation had seized her because life could be so brutal to\ndeath, because the terror and the pity that flamed in her soul shed no\nburning light on the town where her father had worked and loved and\nfought and suffered and died. A little later the ceaseless tread of\nvisitors to the rectory door had driven this thought from her mind, but\nthrough every minute, while he lay in the closed room downstairs, while\nshe sat beside her mother in the slow crawling carriage that went to the\nold churchyard, while she stood with bowed head listening to the words\nof the service--through it all there had been the feeling that something\nmust happen to alter a world in which such a thing had been possible,\nthat life must stop, that the heavens must fall, that God must put forth\nHis hand and work a miracle in order to show His compassion and His\nhorror.\n\nBut nothing had changed. After the funeral her mother had come home with\nher, and the others, many with tear-stained faces, had drifted in\nseparate ways back to eat their separate dinners. For a few hours\nDinwiddie had been shaken out of its phlegmatic pursuit of happiness;\nfor a few hours it had attained an emotional solidarity which swept it\nup from the innumerable bypaths of the personal to a height where the\npersonal rises at last into the universal. Then the ebb had come; the\nsense of tragedy had lessened slowly with the prolongation of feeling;\nand the universal vision had dissolved and crystallized into the\npitiless physical needs of the individual. After the funeral a wave\nalmost of relief had swept over the town at the thought that the\nsuspension and the strain were at an end. The business of keeping alive,\nand the moral compulsion of keeping abreast of one's neighbours,\nreasserted their supremacy even while the carriages, quickening their\npace a trifle on the return drive, rolled out of the churchyard. Now at\nthe end of a week only Virginia and her mother would take the time from\nliving to sit down and remember.\n\nIn the adjoining room, which was the nursery, Mrs. Pendleton was sitting\nbeside the window, with her Bible open on her knees, and her head bent a\nlittle in the direction of Miss Priscilla, who was mending a black dress\nby the table.\n\n\"It is so sweet of you, dear Miss Priscilla,\" she murmured in her vague\nand gentle voice as Virginia entered. So old, so pallid, so fragile she\nlooked, that she might have been mistaken by a stranger for a woman of\neighty, yet the impossibility of breaking the habit of a lifetime kept\nthe lines of her face still fixed in an expression of anxious\ncheerfulness. For more than forty years she had not thought of herself,\nand now that the opportunity had come for her to do so, she found that\nshe had almost forgotten the way that one went about it. Even grief\ncould not make her selfish any more than it could make her untidy. Her\nmanner, like her dress, was so little a matter of impulse, and so\nlargely a matter of discipline and of conscience, that it expressed her\nbroken heart hardly more than did the widow's cap on her head or the\nmourning brooch that fastened the crape folds of her collar.\n\n\"Do you want anything, mother darling? What can I do for you?\" asked\nVirginia, stooping to kiss her.\n\n\"Nothing, dear. I was just telling Miss Priscilla that I had had a visit\nfrom Mr. Treadwell, and that\"--her voice quivered a little--\"he showed\nmore feeling than I should have believed possible. He even wanted to\nmake me an allowance.\"\n\nMiss Priscilla drew out her large linen handkerchief, which was like a\nman's, and loudly blew her nose. \"I always said there was more in Cyrus\nthan people thought,\" she observed. \"Here, I've shortened this dress,\nJinny, until it's just about your mother's length.\"\n\nShe tried to speak carelessly, for though she did not concur in the\npopular belief that to ignore sorrow is to assuage it, her social\ninstinct, which was as strongly developed as Mrs. Pendleton's,\nencouraged her to throw a pleasant veil over affliction.\n\n\"You're looking pale for want of air, Jinny,\" she added, after a minute\nin which she had thought, \"The child has broken so in the last few days\nthat she looks years older than Oliver.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to make her go driving,\" said Mrs. Pendleton, leaning\nforward over the open page of her Bible.\n\n\"But I can't go, mother; I haven't the heart for it,\" replied Virginia,\nchoking down a sob.\n\n\"I don't like to see you looking so badly, dear. You must keep up your\nstrength for the children's sake, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" answered Virginia, but her voice had a weary sound.\n\nA little later, when Miss Priscilla had gone, and Oliver came in to urge\nher to go with him, she shook her head again, still palely resolute,\nstill softly obstinate.\n\n\"But, Jinny, it isn't right for you to let your health go,\" he urged.\n\"You haven't had a breath of air for days and you're getting sallow.\"\n\nHis own colour was as fine as ever; he grew handsomer, if a trifle\nstouter, as he grew older; and at thirty-five there was all the vigour\nand the charm of twenty in his face and manner. In one way only he had\naltered, and of this alteration, he, as well as Virginia, was beginning\nfaintly to be aware. Comfort was almost imperceptibly taking the place\nof conviction, and the passionate altruism of youth would yield before\nmany years to the prudential philosophy of middle-age. Life had defeated\nhim. His best had been thrown back at him, and his nature, embittered by\nfailure, was adjusting itself gradually to a different and a lower\nstandard of values. Though he could not be successful, it was still\npossible, even within the narrow limits of his income and his\nopportunities, to be comfortable. And, like other men who have lived day\nby day with heroically unselfish women, he had fallen at last into the\nhabit of thinking that his being comfortable was, after all, a question\nof supreme importance to the universe. Deeply as he had felt the\nrector's death, he, in common with the rest of Dinwiddie, was conscious\nof breathing more easily after the funeral was over. To his\nimpressionable nature, alternations of mood were almost an essential of\nbeing, and there was something intolerable to him in any slowly\nharrowing grief. To watch Virginia nursing every memory of her father\nbecause she shrank from the subtle disloyalty of forgetfulness, aroused\nin him a curious mingling of sympathy and resentment.\n\n\"I wish you'd go, even if you don't feel like it--just to please me,\nVirginia,\" he urged, and after a short struggle she yielded to his\naltered tone, and got down her hat from the shelf of the wardrobe.\n\nA little later, as the dog-cart rolled out of Dinwiddie into the country\nroad, she looked through her black grenadine veil on a world which\nappeared to have lost its brightness. The road was the one along which\nshe had ridden on the morning of the fox-hunt; ahead of them lay the\nsame fields, sown now with the tender green of the spring; the same\ncreeks ran there, screened by the same thickets of elder; the same pines\nwafted their tang on the March wind that blew, singing, out of the\nforest. It was all just as it had been on that morning--and yet what a\ndifference!\n\n\"Put up your veil, Virginia--it's enough to smother you.\"\n\nBut she only shook her head, shrinking farther down into the shapeless\nborrowed dress as though she felt that it protected her. Following the\nhabit of people whose choice has been instinctive rather than\ndeliberate, a choice of the blood, not of the brain, they had long ago\nexhausted the fund of conversation with which they had started. There\nwas nothing to talk about--since Virginia had never learned to talk of\nherself, and Oliver had grown reticent recently about the subjects that\ninterested him. When the daily anecdotes of the children had been aired\nbetween them with an effort at breeziness, nothing remained except the\nendless discussion of Harry's education. Even this had worn threadbare\nof late, and with the best intentions in the world, Virginia had failed\nto supply anything else of sufficient importance to take its place. An\ninherited habit, the same habit which had made it possible for Mrs.\nPendleton to efface her broken heart, prompted her to avoid any allusion\nto her grief in which she sat shrouded as in her mourning veil.\n\n\"The spring is so early this year,\" she remarked once, with her gaze on\nthe rosy billows of an orchard. \"The peach trees have almost finished\nblooming.\"\n\nThen, as he made no answer except to flick at John Henry's bay mare\nwith his whip, she asked daringly, \"Are you writing again, Oliver?\"\n\nA frown darkened his forehead, and she saw the muscles about his mouth\ntwitch as though he were irritated. For all his failure and his\nbitterness, he did not look a day older, she thought, than when she had\nfirst seen him driving down High Street in that unforgettable May. He\nwas still as ardent, still as capable of inspiring first love in the\nimagination of a girl. The light and the perfume of that enchanted\nspring seemed suddenly to envelop her, and moved by a yearning to\nrecapture them for an instant, she drew closer to him, and slipped her\nhand through his arm.\n\n\"Oh, I'm trying my luck with some trash. Nothing but trash has any\nchance of going in this damned business.\"\n\n\"You mean it's different from your others? It's less serious?\"\n\n\"Less serious? Well, I should say so. It's the sort of ice-cream\nsoda-water the public wants. But if I can get it put on, it ought to\nrun, and a play that runs is obliged to make money. I doubt if there's\nanything much better than money, when it comes to that.\"\n\n\"You used to say it didn't matter.\"\n\n\"Did I? Well, I was a fool and I've learned better. These last few years\nhave taught me that nothing else on earth matters much.\"\n\nThis was so different from what that other Oliver--the Oliver of her\nfirst love--might have said, that involuntarily her clasp on his arm\ntightened. The change in him, so gradual at first that her mind, unused\nto subtleties, had hardly grasped it, was beginning to frighten her.\n\n\"You have such burdens, dear,\" she said, and he noticed that her voice\nhad acquired the toneless sweetness of her mother's. \"I've tried to be\nas saving as I could, but the children have been sick so much that it\nseems sometimes as if we should never get out of debt. I am trying now\nto pay off the bills I was obliged to make while Harry was ill in\nOctober. If I could only get perfectly strong, we might let Marthy go,\nnow that Jenny is getting so big.\"\n\n\"You work hard enough as it is, Virginia. You've been awfully good about\nit,\" he answered, but his manner was almost casual, for he had grown to\ntake for granted her unselfishness with something of the unconcern with\nwhich he took for granted the comfortable feeling of the spring weather.\nIn the early days of their marriage, when her fresh beauty had been a\npower to rule him, she had taught him to assume his right to her\nself-immolation on the altar of his comfort; and with the taste of\nbitterness which sometimes follows the sweets of memory, she recalled\nthat their first quarrel had arisen because she had insisted on getting\nout of bed to make the fires in the morning. Then, partly because the\nrecollection appeared to reproach him, and partly because, not\npossessing the critical faculty, she had never learned to acknowledge\nthe existence of a flaw in a person she loved, she edged closer to him,\nand replied cheerfully:\n\n\"I don't mind the work a bit, if only the children will keep well so we\nshan't have to spend any more money. I shan't need any black clothes,\"\nshe added, with a trembling lip. \"Mrs. Carrington has given me this\ndress, as she has gone out of mourning, and I've got a piece of blue\nsilk put away that I am going to have dyed.\"\n\nHe glanced at the shapeless dress, not indignantly as he would once have\ndone, but with a tinge of quiet amusement.\n\n\"It makes you look every day of forty.\"\n\n\"I know it isn't becoming, but at least it will save having to buy one.\"\n\nIn spite of the fact that her small economies had made it possible for\nthem to live wholesomely, and with at least an appearance of decency, on\nhis meagre salary, they had always aroused in him a sense of bitter\nexasperation. He respected her, of course, for her saving, yet in his\nheart he knew that she would probably have charmed him more had she been\na spendthrift--since the little virtues are sometimes more deadly to the\npassion of love than are the large vices. While he nodded, without\ndisputing the sound common sense in her words, she thought a little\nwistfully how nice it would be to have pretty things if only one could\nafford them. Someday, when the children's schooling was over and Oliver\nhad got a larger salary, she would begin to buy clothes that were\nbecoming rather than durable. But that was in the future, and,\nmeanwhile, how much better it was to grudge every penny she spent on\nherself as long as there were unpaid bills at the doctor's and the\ngrocer's. All of which was, of course, perfectly reasonable, and like\nother women who have had a narrow experience of life, she cherished the\ndelusion that a man's love, as well as his philosophy, is necessarily\nrooted in reason.\n\nWhen they turned homeward, the bay mare, pricked by desire for her\nstable, began to travel more rapidly, and the fall of her hoofs,\naccompanied by the light roll of the wheels, broke the silence which had\nalmost imperceptibly settled upon them. Not until the cart drew up at\nthe gate did Virginia realize that they had hardly spoken a dozen words\non the drive back.\n\n\"I feel better already, Oliver,\" she said, gratefully, as he helped her\nto alight. Then hastening ahead of him, she ran up the walk and into the\nhall, where her mother, looking wan and unnatural in her widow's cap,\ngreeted her with the question:\n\n\"Did you have a pleasant drive, dear?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor six months Mrs. Pendleton hid her broken heart under a smile and\nwent softly about the small daily duties of the household, facing death,\nas she had faced life, with a sublime unselfishness and the manner of a\nlady. Her hopes, her joys, her fears even, lay in the past; there was\nnothing for her to look forward to, nothing for her to dread in the\nfuture. Life had given her all that it had to offer of bliss or sorrow,\nand for the rest of her few years she would be like one who, having\nfinished her work before the end of the day, sits waiting patiently for\nthe words of release to be spoken. As the months went on, she moved like\na gentle shadow about her daughter's little home. So wasted and pallid\nwas her body that at times Virginia feared to touch her lest she should\nmelt like a phantom out of her arms. Yet to the last she never faltered,\nnever cried out for mercy, never sought to hasten by a breath that end\nwhich was to her as the longing of her eyes, as the brightness of the\nsunlight, as the sweetness of the springtime. Once, looking up from\nLucy's lesson which she was hearing, she said a little wistfully, \"I\ndon't think, Jinny, it will be long now,\" and then checking herself\nreproachfully, she added, \"But God knows best. I can trust Him.\"\n\nIt was the only time that she had ever spoken of the thought which was\nin her mind day and night, for when she could no longer welcome her\ndestiny, she had accepted it. Her faith, like her opinions, was\nchild-like and uncritical--the artless product of a simple and incurious\nage. The strength in her had gone not into the building of knowledge,\nbut into the making of character, and she had judged all thought as\ninnocently as she had judged all literature, by its contribution to the\nexternal sweetness of living. A child of ten might have demolished her\ntheories, and yet because of them, or in spite of them, she had\ntranslated into action the end of all reasoning, the profoundest meaning\nin all philosophy. But she was born to decorate instead of to reason.\nThough her mind had never winnowed illusions from realities, her hands\nhad patiently woven both illusions and realities into the embroidered\nfabric of Life.\n\nFor six months she went about the house and helped Virginia with the\nsewing, which had become burdensome since the children, and especially\nHarry, were big enough to wear daily holes in their stockings. Then,\nwhen the half year was over, she took to her bed one evening after she\nhad carefully undressed, folded her clothes out of sight, and read a\nchapter in her Bible. In the morning she did not get up, and at the end\nof a fortnight, in which she apologized for making extra work whenever\nfood was brought to her, she clasped her hands on her thin breast,\nsmiled once into Virginia's face, and died so quietly that there was\nhardly a perceptible change in her breathing. She had gone through life\nwithout giving trouble, and she gave none at the end. As she lay there\nin her little bed in Virginia's spare room, to which she had moved after\nGabriel's death in order that the rectory might be got ready for the new\nrector, she appeared so shadowy and unearthly that it was impossible to\nbelieve that she had ever been a part of the restless strivings and the\nsombre violences of life. On the candle-stand by her bed lay her\nspectacles, with steel rims because she had never felt that she could\nafford gold ones; and a single October rose, from which a golden petal\nhad dropped, stood in a vase beside the Bible. On the foot of the bed\nhung her grey flannelette wrapper, with a patch in one sleeve over which\nHarry had spilled a bottle of shoe polish, while through the\nhalf-shuttered window the autumn sunshine fell in long yellow bars over\nthe hemp rugs on the floor. And she was dead! Her mother was dead--no\nmatter how much she needed her, she would never come back. Out of the\nvacancy around her, some words of her own, spoken in her girlhood,\nreturned to her. \"There is only one thing I couldn't bear, and that is\nlosing my mother.\" Only one thing! And now that one thing had happened,\nand she was not only bearing it, she was looking ahead to a future in\nwhich that one thing would be always beside her, always in her memory.\nWhatever the years brought to her, they could never bring her mother\nagain--they could never bring her a love like her mother's.\n\nOut of that same vacancy, which seemed to swallow and to hold\neverything, which seemed to exist both within and outside of herself, a\nmultitude of forgotten images and impressions flashed into being. She\nsaw the nursery fireside in the rectory, and her mother, with hair that\nstill shone like satin, rocking back and forth in the black wicker chair\nwith the sagging bottom. She saw her kneeling on the old frayed red and\nblue drugget, her skirt pinned up at the back of her waist, while she\nbathed her daughter's scratched and aching feet in the oblong tin\nfoot-tub. She saw her, as beautiful as an angel, in church on Sunday\nmornings, her worshipful eyes lifted to the pulpit, an edge of\ntinted light falling on the open prayer-book in her hand. She saw\nher, thin and stooping, a shadow of all that she had once\nbeen--waiting--waiting----She had always been there. It was impossible\nto realize that a time could ever come when she would not be there--and\nnow she was gone!\n\nAnd behind all the images, all the impressions, the stubborn thought\npersisted that this was life--that one could never escape it--that\nwhatever happened, one must come back to it at the last. \"I have my\nchildren still left--but for my children I could not live!\" she thought,\ndropping on her knees by the bedside, and hiding her face in the grey\nwrapper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter this it seemed to her that she ceased to live except in the lives\nof her children, and her days passed so evenly, so monotonously, that\nshe only noticed their flight when one of the old people in Dinwiddie\nremarked to her with a certain surprise: \"You've almost a grown\ndaughter now, Jinny,\" or \"Harry will soon be getting as big as his\nfather. Have you decided where you will send him to college?\" She was\nnot unhappy--had she ever stopped to ask herself the question, she would\nprobably have answered, \"If only mother and father were living, I should\nbe perfectly satisfied\"; yet in spite of her assurances, there existed\ndeep down in her--so deep that her consciousness had never fully grasped\nthe fact of its presence--a dumb feeling that something was missing out\nof life, that the actuality was a little less bright, a little less\nperfect than it had appeared through the rosy glamour of her virgin\ndreams. Was this \"something missing\" merely one of the necessary\nconditions of mortal existence? Or was there somewhere on the earth that\nstainless happiness which she had once believed her marriage would bring\nto her? \"I should be perfectly satisfied if only----\" she would\nsometimes say in the night, and then check herself before she had ended\nthe sentence. The lack, real as it was, was still too formless to lend\nitself to the precision of words; it belonged less to circumstances than\nto the essential structure of life. And yet, as she put it to herself in\nher rare moments of depression, she had so much to be thankful for! The\nchildren grew stronger as they grew older--since Harry's attack of\ndiphtheria, indeed, there had been no serious illness in the family, and\nas she approached middle-age, her terror of illness increased rather\nthan diminished. The children made up for much--they ought to have made\nup for everything--and yet did they? There was no visible fault that she\ncould attribute to them. With her temperamental inability to see flaws,\nshe was accustomed to think of them as perfect children, as children\nwhom she would not change, had she the power, by so much as a hair or an\noutline. They grew up, straight, fine, and fearless, full of the new\nspirit, eager to test life, to examine facts, possessed by that\nawakening feeling for truth which had always frightened her a little in\nSusan. Vaguely, without defining the sensation, she felt that they were\ngrowing beyond her, that she could no longer keep up with them, that,\nevery year, they were leaving her a little farther behind them. They\nwere fond of her, but she understood from something Jenny said one day,\nthat they had ceased to be proud of her. It was while they were looking\nover an old photograph album of Susan's that, coming to a picture of\nVirginia, taken the week before her wedding, Jenny cried out: \"Why,\nthere's mother!\" and slipped it out of the page.\n\n\"I never saw that before,\" Lucy said, leaning over with a laugh. \"You\nwere so young when you married, mother, and you wore such tight sleeves,\nand a bustle!\"\n\n\"Would you ever have believed she was as pretty as that?\" asked Jenny,\nwith the unconscious brutality of childhood.\n\n\"If you are ever as beautiful as your mother was, you may thank your\nstars,\" said Susan dryly, and by the expression in her face Virginia\nknew that she was thinking, \"If that was my child, I'd slap her!\"\n\nHarry, who had been stuffing fruitcake on the sofa--sweets were his\nweakness--rose suddenly and came over to the group.\n\n\"If you are ever as beautiful as she is now, you may thank your stars,\nMiss Yellow Frisk!\" he remarked crushingly.\n\nIt was a little thing--so little that it seemed ridiculous to think of\nit as among the momentous happenings in a life--but with that\nextraordinary proneness of the little to usurp the significant places of\nmemory, it had become at last one of the important milestones in her\nexperience. At the end, when she forgot everything else, she would not\nforget Harry's foolish words, nor the look in his indignant boyish face\nwhen he uttered them. Until then she had not admitted to herself that\nthere was a difference in her feeling for her children, but with the\ntouch of his sympathetic, not over clean, hand on her shoulder, she knew\nthat she should never again think of the three of them as if they were\none in her interest and her love. The girls were good children, dear\nchildren--she would have let herself be cut in pieces for either of them\nhad it been necessary--but between Harry and herself there was a\ndifferent bond, a closer and a deeper dependency, which strengthened\nalmost insensibly as he grew older. Her daughters she loved, but her\nson, as is the inexplicable way of women, she adored blindly and without\nwisdom. If it had been possible to ruin him, she would have done so,\nbut, unlike many other sons, he seemed, by virtue of that invincible\nstrength with which he had been born, to be proof against both spoiling\nand flattery. He was a nice boy even to strangers, even to Susan, with\nher serene judgment of persons, he appeared a thoroughly nice boy! He\nwas not only a tall, lean, habitually towselled-headed youngster, with a\nhandsome sunburned face and a pair of charming, slightly quizzical blue\neyes, but he was, as his teachers and his school reports bore witness,\npossessed of an intellectual brilliancy which made study as easy, and\nquite as interesting to him, as play. Unlike his father, he had entered\nlife endowed with a cheerful outlook upon the world and with that\ntemperament of success which usually, but by no means inevitably,\naccompanies it. Whatever happened, he would make the best of it, he\nwould \"get on,\" and it was impossible to imagine him in any hole so deep\nthat he could not, sooner or later, find the way out of it. The\nPendleton and the Treadwell spirits had contributed their best to him.\nIf he derived from Cyrus, or from some obscure strain in Cyrus's\nancestry, a wholesome regard for material success, a robust\ndetermination to achieve results combined with that hard, clear vision\nof affairs which makes such achievement easy, he had inherited from\nGabriel his genial temper, his charm of manner, and his faith in life,\nwhich, though it failed to move mountains, had sweetened and enriched\nthe mere act of living. Though he was less demonstrative than Lucy, who\nhad outgrown the plainness and the reticence of her childhood and was\ndeveloping into a coquettish, shallow-minded girl, with what Miss\nPriscilla called \"a glib tongue,\" Virginia learned gradually, in the\nsecret way mothers learn things, that his love for her was, after his\nambition, the strongest force in his character. Between him and his\nfather there had existed ever since his babyhood a curious, silent, yet\nineradicable hostility. Whether the fault was Oliver's or Harry's,\nwhether the father resented the energy and the initiative of his son, or\nthe son resented the indifference and the self-absorption of his father,\nVirginia had never discovered. For years she fought against admitting\nthe discord between them. Then, at last, on the occasion of a quarrel,\nwhen it was no longer possible to dissemble, she followed Oliver into\nhis study, which had once been the \"back parlour,\" and pleaded with him\nto show a little patience, a little sympathy with his son. \"He's a boy\nany father would be proud of----\" she finished, almost in tears.\n\n\"I know he is,\" he answered irritably, \"but the truth is he rubs me the\nwrong way. I suppose the trouble is that you have spoiled him.\"\n\n\"But he isn't spoiled. Everybody says----\"\n\n\"Oh, everybody!\" he murmured disdainfully, with a shrug of his fine\nshoulders.\n\nHe looked back at her with the sombre fire of anger still in his eyes,\nand she saw, without trying to see, without even knowing that she did\nsee, all the changes that years had wrought in his appearance.\nPhysically, he was a finer animal than he had been when she married him,\nfor time, which had sapped her youth and faded her too delicate bloom,\nhad but added a deeper colour to the warm brown of his skin, a steadier\nglow to his eyes, a more silvery gloss to his hair. At forty, he was a\nhandsomer man than he had been at twenty-five, yet, in spite of this,\nsome virtue had gone out of him--here, too, as in life, \"something was\nmissing.\" The generous impulses, the high heart for adventure, the\nenthusiasm of youth, and youth's white rage for perfection--where were\nthese? It was as if a rough hand had passed over him, coarsening here,\nblotting out there, accentuating elsewhere. The slow, insidious devil of\ncompromise had done its work. Once he had made one of the small band of\nfighters who fight not for advantage, but for the truth; now he stood in\nthat middle place with the safe majority who are \"neither for God nor\nfor His enemies.\" Life had done this to him--life and Virginia. It was\nnot only that he had \"grown soft,\" as he would have expressed it, nor\nwas it even wholly that he had grown selfish, for the canker which ate\nat the roots of his personality had affected not his character merely,\nbut the very force of his will. Though the imperative he obeyed had\nalways been not \"I must,\" but \"I want,\" his natural loftiness of purpose\nmight have saved him from the results of his weakness had he not lost\ngradually the capacity for successful resistance with which he had\nstarted. If only in the beginning she had upheld not his inclinations,\nbut his convictions; if only she had sought not to soothe his weakness,\nbut to stimulate his strength; if only she had seen for once the thing\nas it was, not as it ought to have been----\n\nHe was buried in his work now, and there were months during this year\nwhen she appeared hardly to see him, so engrossed, so self-absorbed had\nhe become. Sometimes she would remember, stifling the pang it caused,\nthe nights when he had written his first plays in Matoaca City, and that\nhe had made her sit beside him with her sewing because he could not\nthink if she were out of the room. Now, he could write only when he was\nalone; he hated an interruption so much that she often let the fire go\nout rather than open his closed door to see if it was burning. If she\nwent in to speak to him, he laid his pen down and did not take it up\nagain while she was there. Yet this change had come so stealthily that\nit had hardly affected her happiness. She had grown accustomed to the\ndifference before she had realized it sufficiently to suffer. Sometimes\nshe would say to herself a little wonderingly, \"Oliver used to be so\nromantic;\" for with the majority of women whose marriages have\nsurrendered to an invasion of the commonplace, she accepted the\ncomfortable theory that the alteration was due less to circumstances\nthan to the natural drying of the springs of sentiment in her husband's\ncharacter. Occasionally, she would remember with a smile her three days'\njealousy of Abby; but the brevity and the folly of this had established\nher the more securely in her impregnable position of unquestioning\nbelief in him. She had started life believing, as the women of her race\nhad believed for ages before her, that love was a divine gift which came\nbut once in a lifetime, and which, coming once, remained forever\nindestructible. People, of course, grew more practical and less intense\nas they left youth farther behind them; and though this misty principle\nwould have dissolved at once had she applied it to herself (for she\nbecame more sentimental as she approached middle-age), behind any\nsuspicious haziness of generalization there remained always the sacred\nformula, \"Men are different.\" Once, when a sharp outbreak of the primal\nforce had precipitated a scandal in the home of one of her neighbours,\nshe had remarked to Susan that she was \"devoutly thankful that Oliver\ndid not have that side to his nature.\"\n\n\"It must be a disagreeable side to live with,\" Susan, happily married to\nJohn Henry, and blissfully expectant of motherhood, had replied, \"but as\nfar as I know, Oliver never had a light fancy for a woman in his\nlife--not even before he was married. I used to tell him that it was\nbecause he expected too much. Physical beauty by itself never seemed to\nattract him--it was the angel in you that he first fell in love with.\"\n\nA glow of pleasure flushed Virginia's sharpened features, mounting to\nthe thin little curls on her forehead. These little curls, to which she\nsentimentally clung in spite of the changes in the fashions, were a\ncause of ceaseless worry to Lucy, who had developed into a \"stylish\"\ngirl, and would have died sooner than she would have rejected the\nuniversal pompadour of the period. It was the single vanity that\nVirginia had ever permitted herself, this adhering at middle-age to the\nquaint and rather coquettish hairdressing of her girlhood: and Fate had\npunished her by threading the little curls with grey, while Susan's\nstiff roll (she had adopted the newer mode) remained bravely flaxen. But\nSusan was one of those women who, lacking a fine fair skin and defying\ntradition, are physically at their best between forty and fifty.\n\n\"Oliver used to be so romantic,\" said Virginia, as she had said so often\nto herself, while the glow paled slowly from her cheeks, leaving them\nthe colour of faded rose-leaves.\n\n\"Not so romantic as you were, Jinny.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am still,\" she laughed softly. \"Lucy says I take more interest in\nher lovers now than she does,\" and she added after a minute, \"Girls are\nso different to-day from what they used to be--they are so much less\nsentimental.\"\n\n\"But I thought Lucy was. She has enough flirtations for her age, hasn't\nshe?\"\n\n\"She has enough attention, of course--for the funny part is that, though\nshe's only sixteen and not nearly so pretty as Jenny, the men are all\ncrazy, as Miss Willy says, about her. But, somehow, it's different. Lucy\nenjoys it, but it isn't her life. As for Jenny, she's still too young to\nhave taken shape, I suppose, but she has only one idea in her head and\nthat is going to college. She never gives a boy a thought.\"\n\n\"That's queer, because she promises already to be the most beautiful\ngirl in Dinwiddie.\"\n\n\"She is beautiful. I am quite sure that it isn't because she is my\ndaughter that I think so. But, all the same, I'm afraid she'll never be\nas popular as Lucy is. She is so distant and overbearing to men that\nthey are shy of her.\"\n\n\"And you'll let her go to college?\"\n\n\"If we can afford it--and now that Oliver hopes to get one of his plays\nput on, we may have a little more money. But it seems such a waste to\nme. I never saw that it could possibly do a woman any good to go to\ncollege--though of course I always sympathized with your disappointment,\ndear Susan. Jenny is bent on it now, but I feel so strongly that it\nwould be better for her to come out in Dinwiddie and go to parties and\nhave attention.\"\n\n\"And does Oliver feel that, too?\"\n\n\"Oh, he doesn't care. Jenny is his favourite, and he will let her do\nanything he thinks she has set her heart on. But he has never put his\nwhole life into the children's as I have done.\"\n\n\"But if she goes, will you be able to send Harry?\"\n\n\"Of course, Harry's education must come before everything else--even\nOliver realizes that. Do you know, I've hardly bought a match for ten\nyears that I haven't stopped to ask myself if it would take anything\nfrom Harry's education. That's why I've gone as shabby as this almost\never since he was born--that and my longing to give the girls a few\npretty things.\"\n\n\"You haven't bought a dress for yourself since I can remember. I should\nthink you would wear your clothes out making them over.\"\n\nThe look in Virginia's face showed that the recollection Susan had\ninvoked was not entirely a pleasant one.\n\n\"I've done with as little as I could,\" she answered. \"Only once was I\nreally extravagant, and that was when I bought a light blue silk which I\ndidn't have made up until years afterwards when it was dyed black. Dyed\nthings never hold their own,\" she concluded pensively.\n\n\"You are too unselfish--that is your only fault,\" said Susan\nimpulsively. \"I hope they appreciate all you have been to them.\"\n\n\"Oh, they appreciate me,\" returned Virginia with a laugh. \"Harry does,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"I believe Harry is your darling, Jinny.\"\n\n\"I try not to make any difference in my feeling--they are all the best\nchildren that ever lived--but--Susan, I wouldn't breathe this to anybody\non earth but you--I can't help thinking that Harry loves me more than\nthe others do. He--he has so much more patience with me. The girls\nsometimes laugh at me because I am old-fashioned and behind the times,\nand I can see that it annoys them because I am ignorant of things which\nthey seem to have been born knowing.\"\n\n\"But it was for their sake that you let yourself go--you gave up\neverything else for them from the minute that they were born.\"\n\nA tear shone in Virginia's eye, and Susan knew, without having it put\ninto words, that a wound somewhere in that gentle heart was still\nhurting. \"I'd like to slap them!\" she thought fiercely, and then she\nsaid aloud with a manner of cheerful conviction:\n\n\"You are a great deal too good for them, Jinny, and some day they will\nknow it.\"\n\nA longing came over her to take the thin little figure in her arms and\nshake back into her something of the sparkle and the radiance of her\ngirlhood. Why did beauty fade? Why did youth grow middle-aged? Above\nall, why did love and sacrifice so often work their own punishment?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE PRICE OF COMFORT\n\n\nVirginia knelt on the cushioned seat in the bay-window of her bedroom,\ngazing expectantly down on the pavement below. It was her forty-fifth\nbirthday, and she was impatiently waiting for Harry, who was coming home\nfor a few days before going abroad to finish his studies at Oxford. The\nhouse was a new, impeccably modern dwelling, produced by a triumph of\nthe utilitarian genius of the first decade of the twentieth century, and\nOliver had bought it at a prodigious price a few years after his\ndramatic success had lifted him from poverty into comfort. The girls,\ncharmed to have made the momentous passage into Sycamore Street, were\ndelighted with the space and elegance of their new home, but Virginia\nhad always felt somehow as if she were visiting. The drawing-room, and\nespecially the butler's pantry, awed her. She had not dared to wash\nthose august shelves with soda, nor to fasten her favourite strips of\nwhite oilcloth along their shining surfaces. The old joy of \"fixing up\"\nher storeroom had been wrested from her by the supercilious mulatto\nbutler, who wore immaculate shirt fronts, but whom she suspected of\nbeing untidy beneath his magnificent exterior. Once when she had\ndiscovered a bucket of apple-parings tucked away under the sink, where\nit had stood for days, he had given \"notice\" so unexpectedly and so\nhaughtily that she had been afraid ever since to look under dish-towels\nor into hidden places while he was absent. Out of the problem of the\nSouth \"the servant question\" had arisen to torment and intimidate the\nhousekeepers of Dinwiddie; and inferior service at high wages was\nregarded of late as a thing for which one had come to be thankful. Had\nthey still lived in the little house, Virginia would gladly have done\nher work for the sake of the peace and the cleanliness which it would\nhave ensured; but since the change in their circumstances, Oliver and\nthe girls had grown so dependent upon the small luxuries of living that\nshe put up with anything--even with the appalling suspicion that every\nmouthful she ate was not clean--rather than take the risk of having her\nthree servants desert in a body. When she had unwisely complained to\nOliver, he had remarked impatiently that he couldn't be bothered about\nthe housekeeping, and Lucy had openly accused her of being \"fussy.\"\n\nAfter this she had said nothing more, but gathering suddenly all her\nenergies, she had precipitated a scene with the servants (which ended to\nher relief in the departure of the magnificent butler) and had\nreorganized at a stroke the affairs of her household. For all her\ngentleness, she was not incapable of decisive action, and though it had\nalways been easier for her to work herself than to direct others, her\nnative talent for domesticity had enabled her to emerge triumphantly out\nof this crisis. Now, on her forty-fifth birthday, she could reflect with\npride (the pride of a woman who has mastered her traditional _m\u00c3\u00a9tier de\nfemme_) that there was not a house in Dinwiddie which had better food\nor smoother service than she provided in hers. For more and more, as\nOliver absorbed himself in his work, which kept him in New York many\nmonths of the year, and the children grew so big that they no longer\nneeded her, did her life centre around the small monotonous details of\ncooking and cleaning. Only when, as occasionally happened, the rest of\nthe family were absent together, Oliver about his plays, Lucy on a visit\nto Richmond, and Harry and Jenny at college, an awful sense of futility\ndescended upon her, and she felt that both the purpose and the\ninitiative were sapped from her character. Sometimes, during such days\nor weeks of loneliness, she would think of her mother's words, uttered\nso often in the old years at the rectory: \"There isn't any pleasure in\nmaking things unless there's somebody to make them for.\"\n\nBeyond the window, the November day, which had been one of placid\ncontentment for her, was slowly drawing to its close. The pale red line\nof an autumn sunset lingered in the west above the huddled roofs of the\ntown, while the mournful dusk of evening was creeping up from the earth.\nA few chilled and silent sparrows hopped dejectedly along the bared\nboughs of the young maple tree in front of the house, and every now and\nthen a brisk pedestrian would pass on the concrete pavement below.\nInside, a cheerful fire burned in the grate, and near it, on one end of\nthe chintz-covered couch, lay Oliver's present to her--a set of black\nbear furs, which he had brought down with him from New York. Turning\naway from the window, she slipped the neck-piece over her shoulders, and\nas she did so, she tried to stifle the wonder whether he would have\nbought them--whether even he would have remembered the date--if Harry\nhad not been with him. Last year he had forgotten her birthday--and\nnever before had he given her so costly a present as this. They were\nbeautiful furs, but even she, with her ignorance of the subtler arts of\ndress, saw that they were too heavy for her, that they made her look\nshrunken and small and accentuated the pallor of her skin, which had the\ncolour and the texture of withered rose-leaves. \"They are just what\nJenny has always wanted, and they would be so becoming to her. I wonder\nif Oliver would mind my letting her take them back to Bryn Mawr after\nthe holidays?\"\n\nIf Oliver would mind! The phrase still remained after the spirit which\nsanctified it had long departed. In her heart she knew--though her\nhappiness rested upon her passionate evasion of the knowledge--that\nOliver had not only ceased to mind, that he had even ceased to notice\nwhether she wore his gifts or gave them to Jenny.\n\nA light step flitted along the hall; her door opened without shutting\nagain, and Lucy, in a street gown made in the princess style, hurried\nacross the room and turned a slender back appealingly towards her.\n\n\"Oh, mother, please unhook me as fast as you can. The Peytons are going\nto take me in their car over to Richmond, and I've only a half hour in\nwhich to get ready.\"\n\nThen, as Virginia's hands fumbled a little at an obstinate hook, Lucy\ngave an impatient pull of her shoulders, and reached back, straining her\narms, until she tore the offending fastenings from her dress. She was a\nsmall, graceful girl, not particularly pretty, not particularly clever,\nbut possessing some indefinable quality which served her as\nsuccessfully as either beauty or cleverness could have done. Though she\nwas the most selfish and the least considerate of the three children,\nVirginia was like wax in her hands, and regarded her dashing, rather\ncynical, worldliness with na\u00c3\u00afve and uncomprehending respect. She\nsecretly disapproved of Lucy, but it was a disapproval which was\ntempered by admiration. It seemed miraculous to her that any girl of\ntwenty-two should possess so clearly formulated and critical a\nphilosophy of life, or should be so utterly emancipated from the last\nshackles of reverence. As far as her mother could discern, Lucy\nrespected but a single thing, and that single thing was her own opinion.\nFor authority she had as little reverence as a savage; yet she was not a\nsavage, for she represented instead the perfect product of\nover-civilization. The world was bounded for her by her own personality.\nShe was supremely interested in what she thought, felt, or imagined, and\nbeyond the limits of her individuality, she was frankly bored by\nexistence. The joys, sorrows, or experiences of others failed even to\narrest her attention. Yet the very simplicity and sincerity of her\negoism robbed it of offensiveness, and raised it from a trait of\ncharacter to the dignity of a point of view. The established law of\nself-sacrifice which had guided her mother's life was not only\npersonally distasteful to her--it was morally indefensible. She was\nengaged not in illustrating precepts of conduct, but in realizing her\nindependence; and this realization of herself appeared to her as the\nsupreme and peculiar obligation of her being. Though she was less fine\nthan Jenny, who in her studious way was a girl of much character, she\nwas by no means as superficial as she appeared, and might in time,\naided by fortuitous circumstances, make a strong and capable woman. Her\nfaults, after all, were due in a large measure to a training which had\nconsistently magnified in her mind the space which she would ultimately\noccupy in the universe.\n\nAnd she had charm. Without beauty, without intellect, without culture,\nshe was still able to dominate her surroundings by her inexplicable but\nundeniable charm. She was one of those women of whom people say, \"It is\nimpossible to tell what attracts men in a woman.\" She was indifferent,\nshe was casual, she was even cruel; yet every male creature she met fell\na victim before her. Her slightest gesture had a fascination for the\nmasculine mind; her silliest words a significance. \"I declare men are\nthe biggest fools where women are concerned,\" Miss Priscilla had\nremarked, watching her; and the words had adequately expressed the\nopinion of the feminine half of Dinwiddie's population.\n\nFrom sixteen to twenty-two she had remained as indifferent as a star to\nthe impassioned moths flitting around her. Then, a month after her\ntwenty-second birthday, she had coolly announced her engagement to a man\nwhom she had seen but six times--a widower at that, twelve years older\nthan herself, and the father of two children. The blow had fallen,\nwithout warning, upon Virginia, who had never seen the man, and did not\nlike what she had heard of him. Unwisely, she had attempted to\nremonstrate, and had been met by the reply, \"Mother, dear, you must\nallow me to decide what is for my happiness,\" and a manner which said,\n\"After all, you know so much less of life than I do, how can you advise\nme?\"\n\nIt was intolerable, of course, and the worst of it was that, rebel as\nshe might against the admission, Virginia could not plausibly deny the\ntruth of either the remark or the manner. On the face of it, Lucy must\nknow best what she wanted, and as for knowledge of life, she was\ncertainly justified in considering her mother a child beside her.\nOliver, when the case was put before him, showed a sympathy with\nVirginia's point of view and a moral inability to coerce his daughter\ninto accepting it. \"She knows I never liked Craven,\" he said, \"but after\nall what are we going to do about it? She's old enough to decide for\nherself, and you can't in this century put a girl on bread and water\nbecause she marries as she chooses.\"\n\nNothing about duty! nothing about consideration for her family! nothing\nabout the awful responsibility of entering lightly into such sacred\nrelations! Lucy was evidently in love--if she hadn't been, why on earth\nshould she have precipitated herself into an affair whose only reason\nwas a lack of reason that was conclusive?--but she might have been\nengaging a chauffeur for all the solemnity she put into the\narrangements. She had selected her clothes and planned her wedding with\na practical wisdom which had awed and saddened her mother. All the\nwistful sentiments, the tender evasions, the consecrated dreams that had\ngone into the preparations for Virginia's marriage, were buried\nsomewhere under the fragrant past of the eighties--and the memory of\nthem made her feel not forty-five, but a hundred. Yet the thing that\ntroubled her most was a feeling that she was in the power of forces\nwhich she did not understand--a sense that there were profound\ndisturbances beneath the familiar surface of life.\n\nWhen Lucy had gone out, with her dress open down the back and a glimpse\nof her smooth girlish shoulders showing between the fastenings, Virginia\nwent over to the window again, and was rewarded by the sight of Harry's\nathletic figure crossing the street.\n\nIn a minute he came in, kissing her with the careless tenderness which\nwas one of her secret joys.\n\n\"Halloo! little mother! All alone? Where are the others?\" He was the\nonly one of her children who appeared to enjoy her, and sometimes when\nthey were alone together, he would turn and put his arms about her, or\nstroke her hands with an impulsive, protecting sympathy. There were\nmoments when it seemed to her that he pitied her because the world had\nmoved on without her; and others when he came to her for counsel about\nthings of which she was not only ignorant, but even a little afraid.\nOnce he had consulted her as to whether he should go on the football\nteam at his college, and had listened respectfully enough to her timid\nobjections. Respect, indeed, was the quality in which he had never\nfailed her, and this, even more than his affection, had become a balm to\nher in recent years, when Lucy and Jenny occasionally lost patience and\nshowed themselves openly amused by her old-fashioned opinions. She had\nnever forgotten that he had once taken her part when the girls had tried\nto persuade her to brush back the little curls from her temples and wear\nher hair in a pompadour.\n\n\"It would look so much more suitable for a woman of your age, mother\ndear,\" Lucy had remarked sweetly with a condescending deference which\nhad made Virginia feel as if she were a thousand.\n\n\"And it would be more becoming, too, now that your hair is turning\ngrey,\" Jenny had added, with an intention to be kind and helpful which\nhad gone wrong somehow and turned into officiousness.\n\n\"Shut up, and don't be silly geese,\" Harry had growled at them, and his\nrudeness in her behalf had given Virginia a delicious thrill, which was\nincreased by the knowledge that his manners were usually excellent even\nto his sisters. \"You let them fuss all they want to, mother,\" he\nconcluded, \"but your hair is a long sight better than theirs, and don't\nyou let them nag you into making a mess of it.\"\n\nAll of which had been sweet beyond words to Virginia, though she was\nobliged to admit that his judgment was founded upon a deplorable lack of\ndiscrimination in the matter of hairdressing--since Lucy and Jenny both\nhad magnificent hair, while her own had long since lost its gloss and\ngrown thin from neglect. But if it had been really the truth, it could\nnot have been half so sweet to her.\n\n\"Lucy is dressing to motor over to Richmond with the Peytons, and your\nfather went out to ride. Harry, why won't you let me go on to New York\nto see you off?\"\n\nHe was sailing the following week for England, and he had forbidden her\nto come to his boat, or even to New York, for a last glimpse of him.\n\n\"Oh, I hate having a scene at the boat, mother. It always makes me feel\ncreepy to say good-bye. I never do it if I can help.\"\n\n\"I know you don't, darling--you sneaked off after the holidays without\ntelling me what train you were going by. But this is for such a long\ntime. Two years, Harry.\"\n\nHer voice broke, and turning away, she gazed through the window at the\nyoung maple tree as though her very soul were concentrated upon the\nleafless boughs.\n\nHe stirred uneasily, for like most men of twenty-one, he had a horror of\nsentiment.\n\n\"Oh, well, you may come over next summer, you know. I'll speak to father\nabout it. If his play goes over to London, he'll have to be there, won't\nhe?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" she replied, choking down her tears, and becoming\nsuddenly cheerful. \"And you'll write to me once a week, Harry?\"\n\n\"You bet! By the way, I've had nothing to eat since ten o'clock, and I\nfeel rather gone. Have you some cake around anywhere?\"\n\n\"But we'll have supper in half an hour, and I've ordered waffles and\nfried chicken for you. Hadn't you better wait?\"\n\nHer cheerfulness was not assumed now, for with the turn to practical\nmatters, she felt suddenly that the universe had righted itself. Even\nHarry's departure was forgotten in the immediate necessity of providing\nfor his appetite.\n\n\"Well, I'll wait, but I hope you've prepared for an army. I could eat a\nhundred waffles.\"\n\nHe snapped his jaws, and she laughed delightedly. For all his twenty-one\nyears, and the scholarship which he had won so easily and which was\ntaking him abroad, he was as boyish and as natural as he had been at\nten. Even his love of sweets had not lessened with the increase of his\ndignity. To think of his demanding cake the minute after he had entered\nthe house!\n\n\"Father's play made a great hit,\" he said presently, still steering\ncarefully away from the reefs of emotion. \"I suppose you read all about\nit in the papers?\"\n\nShe shook her head, smiling. Though she tried her best to be as natural\nand as unemotional as he was, she could not keep her adoration out of\nher eyes, which feasted on him like the eyes of one who had starved for\nmonths. How handsome he was, with his broad shoulders, his fine\nsunburned face, and his frank, boyish smile. It was a pity he had to\nwear glasses--yet even his glasses seemed to her individual and\ncharming. She couldn't imagine a single way in which he could be\nimproved, and all the while she was perfectly sure that it wasn't in the\nleast because she was his mother--that she wasn't a bit prejudiced in\nher judgment. It appeared out of the question that anybody--even a\nstranger--could have found fault with him. \"No, I haven't had time to\nread the papers--I've been so busy getting ready for Lucy's wedding,\"\nshe answered. \"But your father told me about it. It must be\nsplendid--only I wish he wouldn't speak so contemptuously of it,\" she\nadded regretfully. \"He says it's trash, and yet I'm sure everybody spoke\nwell of it, and they say it is obliged to make a great deal of money. I\ncan't understand why his success seems to irritate rather than please\nhim.\"\n\n\"Well, he thinks, you know, that it is only since he's cheapened himself\nthat he has had any hearing.\"\n\n\"Cheapened himself?\" she repeated wistfully. \"But his first plays failed\nentirely, so these last ones must be a great deal better if they are\nsuch splendid successes.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it's hard for us to understand his point of view. We\ntalked about it one night in New York when we were dining with Margaret\nOldcastle--she takes the leading part in 'Pretty Fanny,' you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. What is she like?\"\n\nA strange, still look came into her face, as though she waited with\nsuspended breath for his answer.\n\n\"She's a charmer on the stage. I heard father tell her that she made the\nplay, and I'm not sure that he wasn't right.\"\n\n\"But you saw her off the stage, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, she asked me to dinner. She didn't look nearly so young, then,\nand she's not exactly pretty; but, somehow, it didn't seem to matter.\nShe's got genius--you couldn't be with her ten minutes without finding\nout that. I never saw any one in my life so much alive. When she's in a\nroom, even if she doesn't speak, you can't keep your eyes off her. She's\nlike a bright flame that you can't stop looking at--not even if there\nare a lot of prettier women there, too.\"\n\n\"Is she dark or fair?\"\n\nHe stopped to think for a moment.\n\n\"To save my life I can't remember--but I think she's dark--at least, her\neyes are, though her hair may be light. But you never think of her\nappearance when she's talking. I believe she's the best talker I ever\nheard--better even than father.\"\n\nHis enthusiasm had got the better of him, and it was evident that\nOliver's success had banished for a time at least the secret hostility\nwhich had existed between father and son. That passion for material\nresults, which could not be separated from the Treadwell spirit without\nrobbing that spirit of its vitality, had gradually altered the family\nattitude toward Oliver's profession. Art, like business, must justify\nitself by its results, and to a commercial age there could be no\njustifiable results that could not bear translation into figures.\nSuccess was the chief end of man, and success could be measured only in\nterms of money.\n\n\"There's your father's step,\" said Virginia, whose face looked drawn and\npallid in the dusk. \"Let me light the lamp, darling. He hates to read\nhis paper by anything but lamplight.\"\n\nBut he had jumped up before she had finished and was hunting for matches\nin the old place under the clock on the mantelpiece. She was such a\nlittle, thin, frail creature that he laughed as she tried to help him.\n\n\"So Lucy is going to marry that old rotter, is she?\" he asked pleasantly\nas his father entered. \"Well, father! I was just asking mother why she\nlet Lucy marry that old rotter?\"\n\n\"But the dear child has set her heart on him, and he is really very nice\nto us,\" replied Virginia hurriedly. Though she was disappointed in\nLucy's choice, it seemed dreadful to her to speak of a man who was about\nto enter the family as a \"rotter.\"\n\n\"You stop it, Harry, if you have the authority. I haven't,\" answered\nOliver carelessly. \"Is your neuralgia better, Virginia?\"\n\n\"It's quite gone, dear. Doctor Powell gave me some aspirin and it cured\nit.\" She smiled gratefully at him, with a touching pleasure in the fact\nthat he had remembered to ask. As she glanced quickly from father to\nson, eager to see them reconciled, utterly forgetful of herself,\nsomething of the anxious cheerfulness of Mrs. Pendleton's spirit\nappeared to live again in her look. Though her freshness had withered,\nshe was still what is called \"a sweet looking woman,\" and her\nexpression of simple goodness lent an appealing charm to her features.\n\n\"Are you going back to New York soon, father?\" asked Harry, turning\npolitely in Oliver's direction. From his manner, which had lost its\nboyishness, Virginia knew that he was trying with all his energy to be\nagreeable, yet that he could not overcome the old feeling of constraint\nand lack of sympathy.\n\n\"Next week. 'The Home' is to be put on in February, and I'm obliged to\nbe there for the rehearsals.\"\n\n\"Does Miss Oldcastle take the leading part?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nCrossing the room, Oliver held out his hands to the fire, and then\nturning, stretched his arms, with a stifled yawn, above his head. The\nonly fault that could be urged against his appearance was that his\nfigure was becoming a trifle square, that he was beginning to look a\nlittle too well-fed, a little too comfortable. For the rest, his hair,\nwhich had gone quite grey, brought out the glow and richness of his\ncolour and lent a striking emphasis to his dark, shining eyes.\n\n\"Do you think that the new play is as good as 'Pretty Fanny'?\" asked\nVirginia.\n\n\"Well, they're both rot, you know,\" he answered, with a laugh.\n\n\"Oh, Oliver, how can you, when all the papers spoke so admiringly of\nit?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't they? It is perfectly innocuous. The kind of thing any\nfather might take his daughter to see. We shan't dispute that, anyhow.\"\n\nHis flippancy not only hurt, it confused her. It was painful enough to\nhave him speak so slightingly of his success, but worse than this was\nthe feeling it aroused in her that he was defying authority. Even if her\ninnate respect for the printed word had not made her accept as final the\njudgment of the newspapers, there was still the incontestable fact that\nso many people had paid to see \"Pretty Fanny\" that both Oliver and Miss\nOldcastle had reaped a small fortune. She glanced in a helpless way at\nHarry, and he said suddenly:\n\n\"Don't you think Jenny ought to come home to be with mother after Lucy\nmarries? You are obliged to go to New York so often that she will get\nlonely.\"\n\n\"It's a good idea,\" agreed Oliver amiably, \"but there's another case\nwhere you'll have to use greater authority than mine. When I stopped\nreforming people,\" he added gaily, \"I began with my own family.\"\n\n\"The dear child would come in a minute if I suggested it,\" said\nVirginia, \"but she enjoys her life at college so much that I wouldn't\nhave her give it up for anything in the world. It would make me\nmiserable to think that any of my children made a sacrifice for me.\"\n\n\"You needn't worry. We've trained them differently,\" said Oliver, and\nthough his tone was slightly satirical, the satire was directed at\nhimself, not at his wife.\n\n\"I am sure it is what I should never want,\" insisted Virginia, almost\npassionately, while she rose in response to the announcement of supper,\nand met Lucy, in trailing pink chiffon, on the threshold.\n\n\"Are you sure your coat is warm enough, dear?\" she asked. \"Wouldn't you\nlike to wear my furs? They are heavier than yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd love to, if you wouldn't mind, mother.\"\n\nRaising herself on tiptoe, Lucy kissed Harry, and then ran to the\nmirror, eager to see if the black fur looked well on her.\n\n\"They're just lovely on me, mother. I feel gorgeous!\" she exclaimed\ntriumphantly, and indeed her charming girlish face rose like a white\nflower out of the rich dark furs.\n\nIn Virginia's eyes, as she turned back in the doorway to watch her,\nthere was a radiant self-forgetfulness which illumined her features. For\na moment she lived so completely in her daughter's youth that her body\nseemed to take warmth and colour from the emotion which transfigured\nher.\n\n\"I am so glad, darling,\" she said. \"It gives me more pleasure to see you\nin them than it does to wear them myself.\" And though she did not know\nit, she embodied her gentle philosophy of life in that single sentence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMIDDLE-AGE\n\n\nJenny had promised to come home a week before Lucy's wedding, but at the\nlast moment, while they waited supper for her, a telegram announced with\nserious brevity that she was \"detained.\" Twenty-four hours later a\nsecond telegram informed them that she would not arrive until the\nevening before the marriage, and at six o'clock on that day, Virginia,\nwho had been packing Lucy's trunks ever since breakfast, looked out of\nthe window at the sound of the door-bell, and saw the cab which had\ncontained her second daughter standing beside the curbstone.\n\n\"Mother, have you the change to pay the driver?\" asked a vision of stern\nloveliness floating into the room. With the winter's glow in her cheeks\nand eyes and the bronze sheen on her splendid hair, which was brushed in\nrippling waves from her forehead and coiled in a severely simple knot on\nher neck, she might have been a wandering goddess, who had descended,\nwith immortal calm, to direct the affairs of the household. Her white\nshirtwaist, with its starched severity, suited her austere beauty and\nher look of almost superhuman composure.\n\n\"Take off your hat, darling, and lie down on the couch while I finish\nLucy's packing,\" said Virginia, when she had sent the servant downstairs\nto pay the cabman. Her soul was in her eyes while she watched Jenny\nremove her plain felt hat, with its bit of blue scarf around the\ncrown--a piece of millinery which presented a deceptive appearance of\ninexpensiveness--and pass the comb through the shining arch of her hair.\n\n\"I am so sorry, mother dear, I couldn't come before, but there were some\nimportant lectures I really couldn't afford to miss. I am specializing\nin biology, you know.\"\n\nHer manner, calm, sweet, and gently condescending, was such as she might\nhave used to a child whom she loved and with whom she possessed an\ninfinite patience. One felt that while talking, she groped almost\nunconsciously for the simplest and shortest words in which her meaning\nmight be conveyed. She did not lie down as Virginia had suggested, but\nstraightening her short skirt, seated herself in an upright chair by the\ntable and crossed her slender feet in their sensible, square-toed shoes.\nWhile she gazed at her, Virginia remembered, with a smile, that Harry\nhad once said his sister was as flawless as a geometrical figure, and he\ncouldn't look at her without wanting to twist her nose out of shape. In\nspite of her beauty, she was not attractive to men, whom she awed and\nintimidated by a candid assumption of superiority. For Lucy's\nconscienceless treatment of the male she had unmitigated contempt. Her\nsister, indeed, had she not been her sister, would have appeared to her\nas an object for frank condemnation--\"one of those women who waste\nthemselves in foolish flirtations.\" As it was, loving Lucy, and being a\nloyal soul, with very scientific ideas of her own responsibility for her\nsister as well as for that abstract creature whom she classified as \"the\nworking woman,\" she thought of Lucy tenderly as a \"dear girl, but\nsimple.\" Her mother, of course, was, also, \"simple\"; but, then, what\ncould one expect of a woman whose only education had been at the\nDinwiddie Academy for Young Ladies? To Jenny, education had usurped the\nplace which the church had always occupied in the benighted mind of her\nmother. All the evils of our civilization--and these evils shared with\nthe working woman the first right to her attention--she attributed to\nthe fact that the former generations of women had had either no\neducation at all, or worse even than that, had had the meretricious\nbrand of education which was supplied by an army of Miss Priscillas. For\nMiss Priscilla herself, entirely apart from the Academy, which she\ndescribed frankly, to Virginia's horror, as \"a menace,\" she entertained\na sincere devotion, and this ability to detach her judgments from her\naffections made her appear almost miraculously wise to her mother, who\nhad been born a Pendleton.\n\n\"No, I'm not tired. Is there anything I can help you about, mother?\" she\nasked, for she was a good child and very helpful--the only drawback to\nher assistance being that when she helped she invariably commanded.\n\n\"Oh, no, darling, I'll be through presently--just as soon as I get this\ntrunk packed. Lucy's things are lovely. I wish you had come in time to\nsee them. Miss Willy and I spent all yesterday running blue ribbons in\nher underclothes, and though we began before breakfast, we had to sit up\nuntil twelve o'clock so as to get through in time to begin on the trunks\nthis morning.\"\n\nHer eyes shone as she spoke, and she would have enjoyed describing all\nLucy's clothes, for she loved pretty things, though she never bought\nthem for herself, finding it impossible to break the habit of more than\ntwenty years of economy; but Jenny, who was proud of her sincerity,\nlooked so plainly bored that she checked her flowing descriptions.\n\n\"I hope you brought something beautiful to wear to-morrow, Jenny?\" she\nventured timidly, after a silence.\n\n\"Of course I had to get a new dress, as I'm to be maid of honour, but it\nseemed so extravagant, for I had two perfectly good white chiffons\nalready.\"\n\n\"But it would have hurt Lucy, dear, if you hadn't worn something new.\nShe even wanted me to order my dress from New York, but I was so afraid\nof wounding poor little Miss Willy--she has made my clothes ever since I\ncould remember--that I persuaded the child to let her make it. Of\ncourse, it won't be stylish, but nobody will look at me anyway.\"\n\n\"I hope it is coloured, mother. You wear black too much. The\npsychological effect is not good for you.\"\n\nWith her knees on the floor and her back bent over the trunk into which\nshe was packing a dozen pairs of slippers wrapped in tissue paper,\nVirginia turned her head and stared in bewilderment at her daughter,\nwhose classic profile showed like marble flushed with rose in the\nlamplight.\n\n\"But at my time of life, dear? Why, I'm in my forty-sixth year.\"\n\n\"But forty-six is still young, mother. That was one of the greatest\nmistakes women used to make--to imagine that they must be old as soon as\nmen ceased to make love to them. It was all due to the idea that men\nadmired only schoolgirls and that as soon as a woman stopped being\nadmired she had stopped living.\"\n\n\"But they didn't stop living really. They merely stopped fixing up.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. They spent the rest of their lives in the storeroom or\nthe kitchen slaving for the comfort of the men they could no longer\namuse.\"\n\nThis so aptly described Virginia's own situation that her interest in\nLucy's trousseau faded abruptly, while a wave of heartsickness swept\nover her. It was as if the sharp and searching light of truth had fallen\nsuddenly upon all the frail and lovely pretences by which she had helped\nherself to live and to be happy. A terror of the preternatural insight\nof youth made her turn her face away from Jenny's too critical eyes.\n\n\"But what else could they do, Jenny? They believed that it was right to\nstep back and make room for the young,\" she said, with a pitiful attempt\nat justification of her exploded virtues.\n\n\"Oh, _mother_!\" exclaimed Jenny still sweetly, \"whoever heard of a man\nof that generation stepping back to make room for anybody?\"\n\n\"But men are different, darling. One doesn't expect them to give up like\nwomen.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother!\"--this time the sweetness had borrowed an edge of irony. It\nwas Science annihilating tradition, and the tougher the tradition, the\nkeener the blade which Science must apply.\n\n\"I can't help it, dear, it is the way I was taught. My darling mother\nfelt like that\"--a tear glistened in her eye--\"and I am too old to\nchange my way of thinking.\"\n\n\"Mother, mother, you silly pet!\" Rising from her chair, Jenny put her\narms about her and kissed her tenderly. \"You can't help being\nold-fashioned, I know. You are not to blame for your ideas; it is Miss\nPriscilla.\" Her voice grew stern with condemnation as she uttered the\nname. \"But don't you think you might try to see things a little more\nrationally? It is for your own sake I am speaking. Why should you make\nyourself old by dressing as if you were eighty simply because your\ngrandmother did so?\"\n\nShe was right, of course, for the trouble with Science is not its\nblindness, but its serene infallibility. As useless to reject her\nconclusions as to deny the laws and the principles of mathematics! After\nall manner of denials, the laws and the principles would still remain.\nVirginia, who had never argued in her life, did not attempt to do so\nwith her own daughter. She merely accepted the truth of Jenny's\ninflexible logic; and with that obstinate softness which is an\ninalienable quality of tradition, went on believing precisely what she\nhad believed before. To have made them think alike, it would have been\nnecessary to melt up the two generations and pour them into one--a task\nas hopeless as an endeavour to blend the Dinwiddie Young Ladies' Academy\nwith a modern college. Jenny's clearly formulated and rather loud\nmorality was unintelligible to her mother, whose conception of duty was\nthat she should efface herself and make things comfortable for those\naround her. The obligation to think independently was as\nincomprehensible to Virginia as was that wider altruism which had swept\nJenny's sympathies beyond the home into the factory and beyond the\nfactory into the world where there were \"evils.\" Her own instinct had\nalways been the true instinct of the lady to avoid \"evil,\" not to seek\nit, to avoid it, honestly if possible, and, if not honestly--well, to\navoid it at any cost. The love of truth for truth's sake was one of the\nlast of the virtues to descend from philosophy into a working theory of\nlife, and it had been practically unknown to Virginia until Jenny had\nreturned, at the end of her first year, from college. To be sure, Oliver\nused to talk like that long ago, but it was so long ago that she had\nalmost forgotten it.\n\n\"You are very clever, dear--much too clever for me,\" she said, rising\nfrom her knees. \"I wonder if Lucy has anything else she wants to go into\nthis trunk? It might be packed a little tighter.\"\n\nIn response to her call, the door opened and Lucy entered breathlessly,\nwith her hair, which she had washed and not entirely dried, hanging over\nher shoulders.\n\n\"What is it, mother? Oh, Jenny, you have come! I'm so glad!\"\n\nThe sisters kissed delightedly. In spite of their lack of sympathy, they\nwere very fond of each other.\n\n\"Do you want to put anything else in this trunk before I lock it, Lucy?\"\n\n\"Could you find room for my blue flannel bath robe? I'll want it on top\nwhere I can get it out without unpacking, and, oh, mother, won't you\nplease put my alcohol stove and curling irons in my travelling bag?\"\n\nShe was prettily excited, and during the last few days she had shown an\nalmost child-like confidence in her mother's opinions about the trivial\nmatters of packing.\n\n\"Mother, I don't want to come down yet--my hair isn't dry. Will you send\nsupper up to me? I'll dress about nine o'clock when Bertie and the girls\nare coming.\"\n\n\"Of course I will, darling. I'll go straight downstairs and fix your\ntray. Is there anything you can think of that you would like?\"\n\nAt this Jenny broke into a laugh: \"Why, anybody would think she was\ndying instead of being married!\"\n\n\"Just a cup of coffee. I really couldn't swallow a morsel,\" replied\nLucy, whose single manifestation of sentiment had been a complete loss\nof appetite. \"You needn't laugh, Jenny. Wait until you are going to be\nmarried, and see if you are able to eat anything.\"\n\nPutting the tray back into the trunk, Virginia closed it almost\ncaressingly. For twenty-four hours, as Lucy's wedding began to draw\nnearer, she had been haunted by the feeling that she was losing her\nfavourite child, and though her reason told her that this was not\ntrue--that Lucy was, in fact, less fond of her than either of the\nothers, and far less dear to her heart than Harry--still she was unable\nwholly to banish the impression. It seemed only yesterday that she had\nsat waiting, month after month, week after week, day after day, for her\nto be born. Only yesterday that she had held her, a baby, in her arms,\nand now she was packing the clothes which that baby would carry away\nwhen she went off with her husband! Something of the hushed expectancy\nof those long months of approaching motherhood enveloped her again with\nthe thought of Lucy's wedding to-morrow. After all, Lucy was her first\nchild--neither of the others had been awaited with quite the same\nbrooding ecstasy, with quite the same radiant dreams. To neither of the\nothers had she given herself at the hour of birth with such an\nabandonment of her soul and body. And she had been a good child--all day\nwith a lump in her throat Virginia had assured herself again and again\nthat no child could have been better. A hundred little charming ways, a\nhundred bright delicious tricks of expression and of voice, followed her\nfrom room to room, as though Lucy had indeed, as Jenny said, been dying\nupstairs instead of waiting to be married. And all the time, while she\narranged the supper tray and attended to the making of the coffee so\nthat it might be perfect, she was thinking, \"Mother must have felt like\nthis when I was married and I never knew it, I never suspected.\" She saw\nher little bedroom at the rectory, with her own figure, in the floating\ntulle veil, reflected in the mirror, and her mother's face, that face\nfrom which all remembrance of self seemed to have vanished, looking at\nher over the bride's bouquet of white roses. If only she had told her\nthen that she understood! If only she had ever really understood until\nto-night! If only it was not too late to turn back now and gather that\nplaintive figure, waiting with the white roses, into her arms!\n\nThe next morning she was up at daybreak, finishing the packing,\npreparing the house before leaving for church, making the final\narrangements for the wedding breakfast. When at last Lucy, with reddened\neyes and tightly curled hair, appeared in the pantry while her mother\nwas helping to wash a belated supply of glass and china which had\narrived from the caterer's, Virginia felt that the parting was worse\neven than Harry's going to college.\n\n\"Mother, I've the greatest mind on earth not to do it.\"\n\n\"My pet, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine why I ever thought I wanted to marry! I don't want to\ndo it a bit. I don't want to go away and leave you and father. And,\nmother, I really don't believe that I love him!\"\n\nIt was so like Lucy after months of cool determination, of perfect\nassurance, of stubborn resistance to opposition--it was so exactly like\nher to break down when it was too late and to begin to question whether\nshe really wanted her own way after she had won it. And it was so like\nVirginia that at the first sign of weakness in her child she should grow\nsuddenly strong and efficient.\n\n\"My darling, it is only nervousness. You will be better as soon as you\nbegin to dress. Come upstairs and I will fix you a dose of aromatic\nammonia.\"\n\n\"Do you really think it's too late to stop it?\"\n\n\"Not if you feel you are going to regret it, but you must be very sure\nthat it isn't merely a mood, Lucy.\"\n\nAt the first sign that the step was not yet irrevocable, the girl's\ncourage returned.\n\n\"Well, I suppose I'll have to get married now,\" she said, \"but if I\ndon't like it, I'm not going to live with him.\"\n\n\"Not live with your husband! Why, Lucy!\"\n\n\"It's perfectly absurd to think I'll have to live with a man if I find I\ndon't love him. Ask Jenny if it isn't.\"\n\nAsk Jenny! This was her incredible suggestion! This was her reverence\nfor authority, for duty, for the thundering admonitions of Saint Paul!\nAs far as Saint Paul was concerned, he might as well have been the\nponderous anecdotal minister in the brick Presbyterian church around the\ncorner.\n\n\"But Jenny is so--so----\" murmured Virginia, and stopped because words\nfailed her. Had Jenny been born in any family except her own, she would\nprobably have described her as \"dangerous,\" but it was impossible to\nbrand her daughter with so opprobrious an epithet. The word, owing to\nthe metaphorical yet specific definition of it which she had derived\nfrom the rector's sermons in her childhood, invariably suggested fire\nand brimstone to her imagination.\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to do it unless I want to,\" returned Lucy\npositively. \"And you may look as shocked as you please, mother, but you\nneedn't pretend that you wouldn't be glad to see me.\"\n\nThe difference between the two girls, as far as Virginia could see, was\nthat Jenny really believed her awful ideas were right, and Lucy merely\nbelieved that they might help her the more effectively to follow her\nwishes.\n\n\"Of course I'd be glad to see you, but, Lucy, it pains me so to hear you\nspeak flippantly of your marriage. It is the most sacred day in your\nlife, and you treat it as lightly as if it were a picnic.\"\n\n\"Do I? Poor little day, have I hurt its feelings?\"\n\nThey were on the way upstairs, following a procession of wedding\npresents which had just arrived by express, and glancing round over the\nheads of the servants, she made a laughing face at her mother. Clearly,\nshe was incorrigible, and her passing fear, which had evidently been\nentirely due, as Virginia had suspected, to one of her rare attacks of\nnervousness, had entirely disappeared. In her normal mood she was\nperfectly capable of taking care of herself not only within the estate\nof matrimony, but in an African jungle. She would in either situation\ninevitably get what she wanted, and in order to get it she would shrink\nas little from sacrificing a husband as from enslaving a savage.\n\nAnd yet a few hours later, when she stood beneath her bridal veil and\ngazed at her image in the cheval-glass in her bedroom, she presented so\nenchanting a picture of virgin innocence, that Virginia could hardly\nbelieve that she harboured in her breast, under the sacred white satin\nof her bride's gown, the heretical opinions which she had uttered\ndownstairs in the pantry. Her charming face had attuned its expression\nso perfectly to the dramatic values of the moment that she appeared, in\nthe words of that sentimental soul, Miss Priscilla, to be listening\nalready to \"The Voice that Breathed o'er Eden.\"\n\n\"Doesn't mother look sweet?\" she asked, catching sight of Virginia's\nface in the mirror. \"I love her in pale grey--only she ought to have\nsome flowers.\"\n\n\"I told father to order her a bunch of violets,\" answered Jenny. \"I\nwonder if he remembered to do it.\"\n\nA look of pleasure, the first she had worn for days, flitted over\nVirginia's face. She had all her mother's touching appreciation of\ninsignificant favours, and, perhaps because her pleasure was so\nexcessive, people shrank a little from arousing it. Like most persons\nwho thought perpetually of others, she was not accustomed to being\nthought of very often in return.\n\nBut Oliver had remembered, and when the purple box was brought up to\nher, and Jenny pinned the violets on her dress, a blush mantled her thin\ncheeks, and she looked for a moment almost as young and lovely as her\ndaughters. Then Oliver came after Lucy, and gathering up her train, the\ngirl smiled at her mother and hurried out of the room. At the last\nminute her qualms appeared suddenly to depart. Whatever happened in the\nmonths and years that came afterwards, she had determined to get all she\ncould out of the excitement of the wedding. She had cast no loving\nglance about the little room, where she was leaving her girlhood behind\nher; but Virginia, lingering for an instant after the others had gone\nout, looked with tear-dimmed eyes at the small white bed and the white\nfurniture decorated in roses. She suffered in that minute with an\nintensity and a depth of feeling that Lucy had never known in the\npast--that she would never know in the future--for it is given to\nmothers to live not once, but twice or thrice or as many times as they\nhave children to live for. And the sunlight, entering through the high\nwindow, fell very gently on the anxious love in her eyes, on the fading\nwhite rose-leaves of her cheeks, and on the silvery mist of curls\nframing her forehead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat afternoon, when Lucy had motored off with her husband, and Oliver\nand Jenny had gone riding together, Virginia went back again into the\nroom and put away the scattered clothes the girl had left. On the bed\nwas the little pillow, with the embroidered slip over a cover of pink\nsatin Virginia had made, and taking it from the bed she put it into one\nof the boxes which had been left open until the last minute. As she did\nso, it was as if a miraculous wand was waved over her memory, softening\nLucy's image until she appeared to her in all the angelic sweetness and\ncharm of her childhood. Her egoism, her selfishness, her lack of\nconsideration and of reverence, all those faults of an excessive\nindividualism embodied in the girl, vanished so completely that she even\nforgot they had ever existed. Once again she felt in her breast the\nburning rapture of young motherhood; once again she gathered her\nfirst-born child--hers alone, hers out of the whole world of\nchildren!--into her arms. A choking sensation rose in her throat, and,\ndropping a handful of photographs which she had started to put away, she\nhurried from the room, as though she were leaving something dead there\nthat she loved.\n\nDownstairs, the caterers and the florists were in possession, carting\naway glass and china, dismantling decorations, and ejecting palms as\nsummarily as though they had come uninvited. The servants were busy\nsweeping floors and moving chairs and sofas back into place, and in the\nkitchen the negro cook was placidly beginning preparations for supper.\nFor a time Virginia occupied herself returning the ornaments to the\ndrawing-room mantelpiece, and the illustrated gift books to the centre\ntable. When this was over she looked about her with the nervous\nexpectancy of a person who has been overwhelmed for months by a\nmultitude of exigent cares, and realized, with a start, that there was\nnothing for her to do. To-morrow Oliver and Jenny were both going\naway--he to New York to attend the rehearsals of his play, and she back\nto finish her year at college--and Virginia would be left in an empty\nhouse with all her pressing practical duties suddenly ended.\n\n\"You will have such a nice long rest now, mother dear,\" Lucy had said as\nshe clung to her before stepping into the car, and Virginia had agreed\nunthinkingly that a rest for a little while would, perhaps, do her good.\nNow, turning away from the centre table, where she had laid the last\nuseless volume in place, she walked slowly through the library to the\ndining-room, and then from the dining-room into the pantry. Here, the\ndishes were all washed, the cup-towels were drying in an orderly row\nbeside the sink, and the two maids and the butler were \"drawing a\nbreath\" in wooden chairs by the stove.\n\n\"There was enough chicken salad and ice cream left for supper, wasn't\nthere, Wotan?\"\n\nOn being assured that there was enough for a week, she gave a few\ndirections about the distribution of the other food left from the\nwedding breakfast, and then went out again and into Oliver's study. A\nfeeling of restlessness more acute than any she had ever known kept her\nwalking back and forth between the door and the window, which looked out\ninto a square of garden, where a few lonely sticks protruded out of the\ndiscoloured snow on the grass. She had lived for others so long that\nshe had at last lost the power of living for herself.\n\nThere was nothing to do to-day; there would be nothing to do to-morrow;\nand, unless Jenny came home to be married, there would be nothing to do\nnext year or the years after that. While Oliver was in Dinwiddie, she\nhad, of course, the pleasure of supplying his food and of watching him\neat it; but beyond that, even when he sat in the room with her, there\nwas little conversation between them. She herself loved to talk, for she\nhad inherited her mother's ability to keep up a honeyed flow of sound\nabout little things; but she had learned long ago that there were times\nwhen her voice, rippling on about nothing, only irritated him, and with\nher feminine genius for adaptability, she had made a habit of silence.\nHe never spoke to her of his work except in terms of flippant ridicule\nwhich pained her, and the supreme topic of the children's school reports\nhad been absent now for many years. Companionship of a mental sort had\nalways been lacking between them, yet so reverently did she still accept\nthe traditional fictions of marriage, that she would have been\nastonished at the suggestion that a love which could survive the shocks\nof tragedy might at last fade away from a gradual decline of interest.\nNothing had happened. There had been no scenes, no quarrels, no\njealousies, no recriminations--merely a gentle, yet deliberate,\nwithdrawal of personalities. He had worshipped her at twenty-two, and\nnow, at forty-seven, there were moments when she realized with a stab of\npain that she bored him; but beyond this she had felt no cause for\nunhappiness, and until the last year no cause even for apprehension.\nThe libertine had always been absent from his nature; and during all the\nyears of their marriage he had, as Susan put it, hardly so much as\nlooked at another woman. Whatever came between them, it would not be\nphysical passion, but a far subtler thing.\n\nGoing to his desk, she took up a photograph of Margaret Oldcastle and\nstudied it for a moment--not harshly, not critically, but with a pensive\nquestioning. It was hardly a beautiful face, but in its glowing\nintellectuality, it was the face of a woman of power. So different was\nthe look of noble reticence it wore from that of the conventional type\nof American actress, that while she gazed at it Virginia found herself\nasking vaguely, \"I wonder why she went on the stage?\" The woman was not\na pretty doll--she was not a voluptuous enchantress--the coquetry of the\none and the flesh of the other were missing. If the stories Virginia had\nheard of her were to be trusted, she had come out of poverty not by the\neasy steps of managers' favours, but by hard work, self-denial, and\ndiscipline. Though Virginia had never seen her, she felt instinctively\nthat she was an \"honest woman.\"\n\nAnd yet why did this face, which had in it none of the charms of the\nseductress, disturb her so profoundly? She was too little given to\nintrospection, too accustomed to think always in concrete images, to\nanswer the question; but her intuition, rather than her thought, made\nher understand dimly that the things she feared in Margaret Oldcastle\nwere the qualities in which she herself was lacking. Whatever power the\nwoman possessed drew its strength and its completeness from a source\nwhich Virginia had never recognized as being necessary or even\nbeneficent to love. After all, was it not petty and unjust in her to be\nhurt by Oliver's friendship for a woman who had been of such tremendous\nassistance to him in his work? Had he not said a hundred times that she\nhad succeeded in making his plays popular without making them at the\nsame time ridiculous?\n\nPutting the photograph back in its place on the desk, she turned away\nand began walking again over the strip of carpet which led from the door\nto the window. In the yard the dried stalks of last year's flowers\nlooked so lonely in the midst of the dirty snow, that she felt a sudden\nimpulse of sympathy. Poor things, they had outlived their usefulness.\nThe phrase occurred to her again, and she remembered how often her\nfather had applied it to women whose children had all married and left\nthem.\n\n\"Poor Matilda! She is restless and dissatisfied, and she doesn't\nunderstand that it is because she has outlived her usefulness.\" At that\ntime \"poor Matilda\" had seemed to her an old woman--but, perhaps, she\nwasn't in reality much over forty. How soon women grew old a generation\nago! Why, she felt as young to-day as she did the morning on which she\nwas married. She felt as young, and yet her hair was greying, her face\nwas wrinkled, and, like poor Matilda, she had outlived her usefulness.\nWhile she stood there that peculiar sensation which comes to women when\ntheir youth is over--the sensation of a changed world--took possession\nof her. She felt that life was slipping, slipping past her, and that she\nwas left behind like a bit of the sentiment or the law of the last\ncentury. Though she still felt young, it was not with the youth of\nto-day. She had no part in the present; her ideals were the ideals of\nanother period; even her children had outgrown her. She saw now with a\npiercing flash of insight, so penetrating, so impersonal, that it seemed\nthe result of some outside vision rather than of her own uncritical\njudgment, that life had treated her as it treats those who give, but\nnever demand. She had made the way too easy for others; she had never\nexacted of them; she had never held them to the austerity of their\nideals. Then the illumination faded as if it had been the malicious act\nof a demon, and she reproached herself for allowing such thoughts to\nenter her mind for an instant.\n\n\"I don't know what can be the matter with me. I never used to brood. I\nwonder if it can be my time of life that makes me so nervous and\napprehensive?\"\n\nFor so long she had waited for some definite point of time, for the\nchildren to begin school, for them to finish school, for Harry to go off\nto college, for Lucy to be married, that now, when she realized that\nthere was nothing to expect, nothing to prepare for, her whole nature,\nwith all the multitudinous fibres which had held her being together,\nseemed suddenly to relax from its tension. To be sure, Oliver would come\nhome for a time at least after his rehearsals were over, Jenny would\nreturn for as much of the holidays as her philanthropic duties\npermitted, and, if she waited long enough, Harry would occasionally pay\nher a visit. They all loved her; not one of them, she told herself,\nwould intentionally neglect her--but not one of them needed her! She had\noutlived her usefulness!\n\nThe next afternoon, when Oliver and Jenny had driven off to the station,\nshe put on her street clothes, and went out to call on Susan, who lived\nin a new house in High Street. Mrs. Treadwell, having worn out\neverybody's patience except Susan's, had died some five years before,\nand the incorrigible sentimentalists of Dinwiddie--there were many of\nthem--expressed publicly the belief that Cyrus had never been \"the same\nman since his wife's death.\" As a matter of fact, Cyrus, who had retired\nfrom active finance in the same year that he lost Belinda, had missed\nhis business considerably more than he had missed his wife, whose loss,\nif he had ever analyzed it, would have resolved itself into the absence\nof somebody to bully. But on the very day that he had retired from work\nhe had begun to age rapidly, and now, standing on Susan's porch, he\nsuggested to Virginia an orange from which every drop of juice had been\nsqueezed. Of late he had taken to giving rather lavishly to churches,\nwith a vague, superstitious hope, perhaps, that he might buy the\nsalvation he had been too busy to work out in other ways. And so acute\nhad become his terror of death, Virginia had heard, that after every\nattack of dyspepsia he dispatched a check to the missionary society of\nthe church he attended.\n\nUpstairs, in her bedroom, Susan, who had just come in, was \"taking off\nher things,\" and she greeted Virginia with a delight which seemed, in\nsome strange way, to be both a balm and a stimulant. One thing, at\nleast, in her life had not altered with middle-age, and that was\nSusan's devotion. She was a large, young, superbly vigorous woman of\nforty-five, with an abundant energy which overflowed outside of her\nhousehold in a dozen different directions. She loved John Henry, but she\ndid not love him to the exclusion of other people; she loved her\nchildren, but they did not absorb her. There was hardly a charity or a\npublic movement in Dinwiddie in which she did not take a practical\ninterest. She had kept her mind as alert as her body, and the number of\nbooks she read had always shocked Virginia a little, who felt that time\nfor reading was obliged to be time subtracted from more important\nduties.\n\n\"I've thought of you so much, Jinny, darling. You mustn't let yourself\nbegin to feel lonely.\"\n\nVirginia shook her head with a smile, but in spite of her effort not to\nappear depressed, there was a touching wistfulness in her eyes.\n\n\"Of course I miss the dear children, but I'm so thankful that they are\nhappy.\"\n\n\"I wish Jenny would come back home to stay with you.\"\n\n\"She would if I asked her, Susan\"--her face showed her pleasure at the\nthought of Jenny's willingness for the sacrifice--\"but I wouldn't have\nher do it for the world. She's so different from Lucy, who was quite\nhappy as long as she could have attention and go to parties. Of course,\nit seems to me more natural for a girl to be like that, especially a\nSouthern girl, but Jenny says that she is obliged to have something to\nthink about besides men. I wonder what my dear father would have thought\nof her?\"\n\n\"She'll take you by surprise some day, and marry as suddenly as Lucy\ndid.\"\n\n\"That's what Oliver says, but Miss Priscilla is sure she'll be an old\nmaid, because she's so fastidious. It's funny how much more women exact\nof men now than they used to. Don't you remember what a heroine the\nwomen of Miss Priscilla's generation thought Mrs. Tom Peachey was\nbecause she supported Major Peachey by taking boarders while he just\ndrank himself into his grave? Well, somebody mentioned that to Jenny the\nother day and she said it was 'disgusting.'\"\n\n\"I always thought so,\" said Susan, \"but, Jinny, I'm more interested in\nyou than I am in Mrs. Peachey. What are you going to do with yourself?\"\nAlmost unconsciously both had eliminated Oliver as the dominant figure\nin Virginia's future.\n\n\"I don't know, dear. I wish my children were as young as yours. Bessie\nis just six, isn't she?\"\n\n\"You ought to have had a dozen children. Didn't you realize that Nature\nintended you to do it?\"\n\n\"I know\"--a pensive look came into her face--\"but we were very poor, and\nafter the three came so quickly, and the little one that I lost, Oliver\nfelt that we could not afford to have any others. I've so often thought\nthat I was never really happy except when I had a baby in my arms.\"\n\n\"It's a devilish trick of Nature's that she makes them stop coming at\nthe very time that you want them most. Forty-five is not much more than\nhalf a lifetime, Jinny.\"\n\n\"And when one has lived in their children as I have done, of course, one\nfeels a little bit lost without them. Then, if Oliver were not obliged\nto be away so much----\"\n\nHer voice broke, and Susan, leaning forward impulsively, put her arms\nabout her.\n\n\"Jinny, darling, I never saw you depressed before.\"\n\n\"I was never like this until to-day. It must be the weather--or my age.\nI suppose I shall get over it.\"\n\n\"Of course you will get over it--but you mustn't let it grow on you. You\nmustn't be too much alone.\"\n\n\"How can I help it? Oliver will be away almost all winter, and when he\nis at home, he is so absorbed in his work that he sometimes doesn't\nspeak for days. Of course, it isn't his fault,\" she added hastily; \"it\nis the only way he can write.\"\n\n\"And you're alone now for the first time for twenty-five years. That's\nwhy you feel it so keenly.\"\n\nThe look of unselfish goodness which made Virginia's face almost\nbeautiful at times passed like an edge of light across her eyes and\nmouth. \"Don't worry about me, Susan. I'll get used to it.\"\n\n\"You will, dear, but it isn't right. I wish Harry could have stayed in\nDinwiddie. He would have been such a comfort to you.\"\n\n\"But I wouldn't have had him do it! The boy is so brilliant. He has a\nfuture before him. Already he has had several articles accepted by the\nmagazines\"--her face shone--\"and I hope that he will some day be as\nsuccessful as Oliver has been without going through the long struggle.\"\n\n\"Can't you go to England to see him in the summer?\"\n\n\"That's what I want to do.\" It was touching to see how her animation and\ninterest revived when she began talking of Harry. \"And when Oliver's\nplay is put on in February, he has promised to take me to New York for\nthe first night.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that. But, meanwhile, you mustn't sit at home and think\ntoo much, Jinny. It isn't good for you. Can't you find an interest? If\nyou would only take up reading again. You used to be fond of it.\"\n\n\"I know, but one gets out of the habit. I gave it up after the children\ncame, when there was so much that was really important for me to do, and\nnow, to save my life, I can't get interested in a book except for an\nhour or two at a time. I'm always stopping to ask myself if I'm not\nneglecting something, just as I used to do while the children were\nlittle. You see, I'm not a clever woman like you. I was made just to be\na wife and mother, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"But you're obliged to be something else now. You are only forty-five.\nThere may be forty more years ahead of you, and you can't go on being a\nmother every minute of your time. Even if you have grandchildren, they\nwon't be like your own. You can't slave over them in the way you used to\ndo over yours. The girls' husbands and Harry's wife would have something\nto say about it.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Susan, I try not to be little and jealous, but when you\nsaid 'Harry's wife' so carelessly just now it brought a lump to my\nthroat.\"\n\n\"He will marry some day, darling, and you might as well accustom\nyourself to the thought.\"\n\n\"I know, and I want him to do it. I shall love his wife as if she were\nmy daughter--but--but it seems to me at this minute as if I could not\nbear it!\"\n\nThe grey twilight, entering through the high window above her head,\nenveloped her as tenderly as if it were the atmosphere of those romantic\nearly eighties to which she belonged. The small aristocratic head, with\nits quaint old-fashioned clusters of curls on the temples, the delicate\nstooping figure, a little bent in the chest, the whole pensive,\nexquisite personality which expressed itself in that manner of gentle\nself-effacement--these things spoke to Susan's heart, through the\nsoftness of the dusk, with all the touching appeal of the past. It was\nas if the inscrutable enigma of time waited there, shrouded in mystery,\nfor a solution which would make clear the meaning of the blighted\npromises of life. She saw herself and Virginia on that May afternoon\ntwenty-five years ago, standing with eager hearts on the edge of the\nfuture; she saw them waiting, with breathless, expectant lips, for the\nmiracle that must happen! Well, the miracle had happened, and like the\nmajority of miracles, it had descended in the act of occurrence from the\nzone of the miraculous into the region of the ordinary. This was life,\nand looking back from middle-age, she felt no impulse to regret the\nrapturous certainties of youth. Experience, though it contained an\ninevitable pang, was better than ignorance. It was good to have been\nyoung; it was good to be middle-aged; and it would be good to be old.\nFor she was one of those who loved life, not because it was beautiful,\nbut because it was life.\n\n\"I must go,\" said Virginia, rising in the aimless way of a person who is\nnot moving toward a definite object.\n\n\"Stay and have supper with us, Jinny. John Henry will take you home\nafterward.\"\n\n\"I can't, dear. The--the servants are expecting me.\"\n\nShe kissed Susan on the cheek, and taking up her little black silk bag,\nturned to the door.\n\n\"Jinny, if I come by for you to-morrow, will you go with me to a board\nmeeting or two? Couldn't you possibly take an interest in some charity?\"\nIt was a desperate move, but at the moment she could think of no other\nto make.\n\n\"Oh, I am interested, Susan--but I have no executive ability, you know.\nAnd--and, then, poor dear father used to have such a horror of women who\nwere always running about to meetings. He would never even let mother do\nchurch work--except, of course, when there was a cake sale or a fair of\nthe missionary society.\"\n\nSusan's last effort had failed, and as she followed Virginia downstairs\nand to the front door, a look almost of gloom settled on her large\ncheerful face.\n\n\"Try to pay some calls every afternoon, won't you, dear?\" she said at\nthe door. \"I'll come in to see you in the morning when we get back from\nmarketing.\"\n\nThen she added softly, \"If you are ever lonesome and want me, telephone\nfor me day or night. There's nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you,\nJinny.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes were wonderful with love and gratitude as they shone on\nher through the twilight. \"We've been friends since we were two years\nold, Susan, and, do you know, there is nobody in the world that I would\nask anything of as soon as I would of you.\"\n\nA look of unutterable understanding and fidelity passed between them;\nthen turning silently away, Virginia descended the steps and walked\nquickly along the path to the pavement, while Susan, after watching her\nthrough the gate, shut the door and went upstairs to the nursery.\n\nThe town lay under a thin crust of snow, which was beginning to melt in\nthe chill rain that was falling. Raising her umbrella, Virginia picked\nher way carefully over the icy streets, and Miss Priscilla, who was\nlooking in search of diversion out of her front window, had a sudden\npalpitation of the heart because it seemed to her for a minute that\n\"Lucy Pendleton had returned to life.\" So one generation of gentle\nshades after another had moved in the winter's dusk under the frosted\nlamps of High Street.\n\nThrough the windows of her house a cheerful light streamed out upon the\npiles of melting snow in the yard, and at the door one of her coloured\nservants met her with the news that a telegram was on the hall table.\nBefore opening it she knew what it was, for Oliver's correspondence with\nher had taken this form for more than a year.\n\n\"Arrived safely. Very busy. Call on John Henry if you need anything.\"\n\nShe put it down and turned hastily to letters from Harry and Jenny. The\nfirst was only a scrawl in pencil, written with that boyish reticence\nwhich always overcame Harry when he wrote to one of his family; but\nbeneath the stilted phrases she could read his homesickness and his\nlonging for her in every line.\n\n\"Poor boy, I am afraid he is lonely,\" she thought, and caressed the\npaper as tenderly as if it had been the letter of a lover. He had\nwritten to her every Sunday since he had first gone off to college and\nseveral times she knew that he had denied himself a pleasure in order to\nsend her her weekly letter. Already, she had begun to trust to his\n\"sense of responsibility\" as she had never, even in the early days of\nher marriage, trusted to Oliver's.\n\nOpening the large square envelope which was addressed in Jenny's\nimpressive handwriting, she found four closely written pages\nentertainingly descriptive of the girl's journey back to college and of\nthe urgent interests she found awaiting her there. In this letter there\nwas none of the weakness of implied sentiment, there was none of the\nplaintive homesickness she had read in Harry's. Jenny wrote regularly\nand affectionately because she felt that it was her duty to do so, for,\nunlike Lucy, who was heard from only when she wanted something, she was\na girl who obeyed sedulously the promptings of her conscience. But if\nshe loved her mother, she was plainly not interested in her. Her\nattitude towards life was masculine rather than feminine; and Virginia\nhad long since learned that in the case of a man it is easier to inspire\nlove than it is to hold his attention. Harry was different, of\ncourse--there was a feminine, or at least a poetic, streak in him which\nendowed him with that natural talent for the affections which is\nsupposed to be womanly--but Jenny resembled Oliver in her preference for\nthe active rather than for the passive side of experience.\n\nGoing upstairs, Virginia took off her hat and coat, and, without\nchanging her dress, came down again with a piece of fancy-work in her\nhands. Placing herself under the lamp in Oliver's study, she took a few\ncareful stitches in the centrepiece she was embroidering for Lucy, and\nthen letting her needle fall, sat gazing into the wood-fire which\ncrackled softly on the brass andirons. From the lamp on the desk an\namber glow fell on the dull red of the leather-covered furniture, on the\npale brown of the walls, on the rich blending of oriental colours in the\nrug at her feet. It was the most comfortable room in the house, and for\nthat reason she had fallen into the habit of using it when Oliver was\naway. Then, too, his personality had impressed itself so ineffaceably\nupon the surroundings which he had chosen and amid which he had worked,\nthat she felt nearer to him while she sat in his favourite chair,\nbreathing the scent of the wood-fire he loved.\n\nShe thought of the \"dear children,\" of how pleased she was that they\nwere all well and happy, of how \"sweet\" Harry and Jenny were about\nwriting to her; and so unaccustomed was she to thinking in the first\nperson, that not until she took up her embroidery again and applied her\nneedle to the centre of a flower, did she find herself saying aloud: \"I\nmust send for Miss Willy to-morrow and engage her for next week. That\nwill be something to do.\"\n\nAnd looking ahead she saw days of endless stitching and basting, of\nendless gossip accompanied by the cheerful whirring of the little\ndressmaker's machine. \"I used to pity Miss Willy because she was obliged\nto work,\" she thought with surprise, \"but now I almost envy her. I\nwonder if it is work that keeps her so young and brisk? She's never had\nanything in her life, and yet she is so much happier than some people\nwho have had everything.\"\n\nThe maid came to announce supper, and, gathering up her fancy-work,\nVirginia laid it beside the lamp on the end of Oliver's writing table.\nAs she did so, she saw that her photograph, taken the year of her\nmarriage, which he usually carried on his journeys, had been laid aside\nand overlooked when he was packing his papers. It was the first time he\nhad forgotten it, and a little chill struck her heart as she put it back\nin its place beside the bronze letter rack. Then the chill sharpened\nsuddenly until it became an icy blade in her breast, for she saw that\nthe picture of Margaret Oldcastle was gone from its frame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nLIFE'S CRUELTIES\n\n\nThere was a hard snowstorm on the day Oliver returned to Dinwiddie, and\nVirginia, who had watched from the window all the afternoon, saw him\ncrossing the street through a whirl of feathery flakes. The wind drove\nviolently against him, but he appeared almost unconscious of it, so\nbuoyant, so full of physical energy was his walk. Never had he looked\nmore desirable to her, never more lovable, than he did at that instant.\nSomething, either a trick of imagination or an illusion produced by the\nflying whiteness of the storm, gave him back for a moment the glowing\neyes and the eager lips of his youth. Then, as she turned towards the\ndoor, awaiting his step on the stairs, the mirror over the mantel showed\nher her own face, with its fallen lines, its soft pallor, its look of\nfading sweetness. She had laid her youth down on the altar of her love,\nwhile he had used love, as he had used life, merely to feed the flame of\nthe unconquerable egoism which burned like genius within him.\n\nHe came in, brushing a few flakes of snow from his sleeve, and it seemed\nto her that the casual kindness of his kiss fell like ice on her cheek\nas he greeted her. It was almost three months since he had seen her, for\nhe had been unable to come home for Christmas, but from his manner he\nmight have parted from her only yesterday. He was kind--he had never\nbeen kinder--but she would have preferred that he should strike her.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked gently, turning to warm his hands at the\nfire. \"Beastly cold, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am all right, dear. The play is a great success, isn't it?\"\n\nHis face clouded. \"As such things go. It's awful rot, but it's made a\nhit--there's no doubt of that.\"\n\n\"And the other one, 'The Home'--when is the first night of that?\"\n\n\"Next week. On Thursday. I must get back for it.\"\n\n\"And I am to go with you, am I not? I have looked forward to it all\nwinter.\"\n\nAt the sound of her anxious question, a contraction of pain, the look of\none who has been touched on the raw, crossed his face. Though she was\nnot penetrating enough to discern it, there were times when his pity for\nher amounted almost to a passion, and at such moments he was conscious\nof a blind anger against Life, as against some implacable personal\nforce, because it had robbed him of the hard and narrow morality on\nwhich his ancestors leaned. The scourge of a creed which had kept even\nCyrus walking humbly in the straight and flinty road of Calvinism,\nappeared to him in such rare instants as one of the spiritual luxuries\nwhich a rationalistic age had destroyed; for it is not granted to man to\nlook into the heart of another, and so he was ignorant alike of the\nsanctities and the passions of Cyrus's soul. What he felt was merely\nthat the breaking of the iron bonds of the old faith had weakened his\npowers of resistance as inevitably as it had liberated his thought. The\nsound of his own rebellion was in his ears, and filled with the noise of\nit, he had not stopped to reflect that the rebellion of his ancestors\nhad seemed less loud only because it was inarticulate. Was it really\nthat his generation had lost the capacity for endurance, the spiritual\ngrace of self-denial, or was it simply that it had lost its reticence\nand its secrecy with the passing of its inflexible dogmas?\n\n\"Why, certainly you must go if you would care to,\" he answered.\n\n\"Perhaps Jenny will come over from Bryn Mawr to join us. The dear child\nwas so disappointed that she couldn't come home for Christmas.\"\n\n\"If I'd known in time that she wasn't coming, I'd have found a way of\ngetting down just for dinner with you. I hope you weren't alone,\nVirginia.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Miss Priscilla came to spend the day with me. You know she used\nto take dinner with us every Christmas at the rectory.\"\n\nA troubled look clouded his face. \"Jenny ought to have been here,\" he\nsaid, and asked suddenly, as if it were a relief to him to change the\nsubject: \"Have you had news of Harry?\"\n\nThe light which the name of Harry always brought to her eyes shone there\nnow, enriching their faded beauty. \"He writes to me every week. You know\nhe hasn't missed a single Sunday letter since he first went off to\nschool. He is wild about Oxford, but I think he gets a little homesick\nsometimes, though of course he'd never say so.\"\n\n\"He'll do well, that boy. The stuff is in him.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he's a genius if there ever was one, Oliver. Only yesterday\nProfessor Trimble was telling me that Harry was far and away the most\nbrilliant pupil he had ever had.\"\n\n\"Well, he's something to be proud of. And now what about Lucy? Is she\nstill satisfied with Craven?\"\n\n\"She never writes about anything else except about her house. Her\nmarriage seems to have turned out beautifully. You remember I wrote you\nthat she was perfectly delighted with her stepchildren, and she really\nappears to be as happy as the day is long.\"\n\n\"You never can tell. I thought she'd be back again before two months\nwere up.\"\n\n\"I know. We all prophesied dreadful things--even Susan.\"\n\n\"That reminds me--I came down on the train with John Henry, and he said\nthat Uncle Cyrus was breaking rapidly.\"\n\n\"He has never been the same since his wife's death,\" replied Virginia,\nwho was a victim of this sentimental fallacy. \"It's strange--isn't\nit?--because we used to think they got on so badly.\"\n\n\"I wonder if it is really that? Well, is there any other news? Has\nanything else happened?\"\n\nWith his back to the fire, he stood looking down on her with kindly,\nquestioning eyes. He had done his best; from the moment when he had\nentered the room and met the touching brightness in her face, he had\nstruggled to be as natural, to be as affectionate even, as she desired.\nAt the moment, so softened, so self-reproachful was his mood, he would\nwillingly have cut off his arm for her could the sacrifice in any manner\nhave secured her happiness. But there were times when it seemed easier\nto give his life for her than to live it with her; when to shed his\nblood would have cost less than to make conversation. He yearned over\nVirginia, but he could not talk to her. Some impregnable barrier of\npersonality separated them as if it were a wall. Already they belonged\nto different generations; they spoke in the language of different\nperiods. At forty-seven, that second youth, the Indian summer of the\nemotions, which lingers like autumnal sunshine in the lives of most men\nand of a few women, was again enkindling his heart. And with this return\nof youth, he felt the awakening of infinite possibilities of feeling, of\nthe ancient ineradicable belief that happiness lies in possession. Love,\nwhich had used up her spirit and body in its service, had left him\nuntouched by its exactions. While she, having fulfilled her nature, was\ncontent to live anew not in herself, but in her children, the force of\npersonal desire was sweeping over him again, with all the flame and\nsplendour of adolescence. The \"something missing\" waited there, just a\nlittle beyond, as he had seen it waiting in that enchanted May when he\nfell in love with Virginia. And between him and his vision of happiness\nthere interposed merely his undisciplined conscience, his variable,\nthough honest, desire to do the thing that was right. Duty, which had\ncontrolled Virginia's every step, was as remote and aloof from his life\nas was the creed of his fathers. Like his age, he was adrift among\ndisestablished beliefs, among floating wrecks of what had once been\nrules of conduct by which men had lived. And the widening\nresponsibilities, the deepening consciousness of a force for good\ngreater than creed or rules, all the awakening moral strength which\nwould lend balance and power to his age, these things had been weakened\nin his character by the indomitable egoism which had ordered his life.\nThere was nothing for him to fall back upon, nothing that he could\nplace above the restless surge of his will.\n\nSitting there in the firelight, with her loving eyes following his\nmovements, she told him, bit by bit, all the latest gossip of Dinwiddie.\nSusan's eldest girl had developed a beautiful voice and was beginning to\ntake lessons; poor Miss Priscilla had had a bad fall in Old Street while\nshe was on the way to market, and at first they feared she had broken\nher hip, but it turned out that she was only dreadfully bruised; Major\nPeachey had died very suddenly and she had felt obliged to go to his\nfuneral; Abby Goode had been home on a visit and everybody said she\ndidn't look a day over twenty-five, though she was every bit of\nforty-four. Then, taking a little pile of samples from her work basket\nwhich stood on the table, she showed him a piece of black brocaded\nsatin. \"Miss Willy is making me a dress out of this to wear in New York\nwith you. I don't suppose you noticed whether or not they were wearing\nbrocade.\"\n\nNo, he hadn't noticed, but the sample was very pretty, he thought. \"Why\ndon't you buy a dress there, Virginia? It would save you so much\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Poor little Miss Willy has set her heart on making it, Oliver. And,\nbesides, I shan't have time if we go only the day before.\"\n\nA flush had come to her face; at the corners of her mouth a tender\nlittle smile rippled; and her look of faded sweetness gave place for an\ninstant to the warmth and the animation of girlhood. But the excitement\nof girlhood could not restore to her the freshness of youth. Her\npleasure was the pleasure of middle-age; the wistful expectancy in her\nface was the expectancy of one whose interests are centred on little\nthings. That inviolable quality of self-sacrifice, the quality which\nknit her soul to the enduring soul of her race, had enabled her to find\nhappiness in the simple act of renouncement. The quiet years had kept\nundiminished the inordinate capacity for enjoyment, the exaggerated\nappreciation of trivial favours, which had filled Mrs. Pendleton's life\nwith a flutter of thankfulness; and while Virginia smoothed the piece of\nblack brocade on her knee, she might have been the re-arisen pensive\nspirit of her mother. Of the two, perhaps because she had ceased to wish\nfor anything for herself, she was happier than Oliver.\n\nAll through dinner, while her soft anxious eyes dwelt on him over the\nbowl of pink roses in the centre of the table, he tried hard to throw\nhimself into her narrow life, to talk only of things in which he felt\nthat she was interested. Slight as the effort was, he could see her\ngratitude in her face, could hear it in the gentle silvery sound of her\nvoice. When he praised the dinner, she blushed like a girl; when he made\nher describe the dress which Miss Willy was making, she grew as excited\nas if she had been speaking of the sacred white satin she had worn as a\nbride. So little was needed to make her happy--that was the pathos! She\nwas satisfied with the crumbs of life, and yet they were denied her.\nThough she had been alone ever since Lucy's wedding, she accepted his\nbelated visit as thankfully as if it were a gratuitous gift. \"It is so\ngood of you to come down, dear, when you are needed every minute in New\nYork,\" she murmured, with a caressing touch on his arm, and, looking at\nher, he was reminded of Mrs. Pendleton's tremulous pleasure in the\nsweets that came to her on little trays from her neighbours. Once she\nhad said eagerly, \"It will be so nice to see Miss Oldcastle, Oliver,\"\nand he had answered in a constrained tone which he tried to make light\nand casual, \"I am not sure that the part is going to suit her.\"\n\nThen he had changed the subject abruptly by rising from the table and\nasking her to let him see her latest letter from Harry.\n\nThe next morning he went out after breakfast to consult Cyrus about some\ninvestments, while Virginia laid out the lengths of brocade on the bed\nin the spare room, and sat down to wait for the arrival of the\ndressmaker. Outside, the trees were still white from the storm, and the\nwind, blowing through them, made a dry crackling sound as if it were\nrattling thorns in a forest. Though it was intensely cold, the sunshine\nfell in golden bars over the pavement and filled the town with a\ndazzling brilliancy through which the little seamstress was seen\npresently making her way. Alert, bird-like, consumed with her insatiable\ninterest in other people, she entered, after she had removed her bonnet\nand wraps, and began to spread out her patterns. It was twenty-odd years\nsince she had made the white satin dress in which Virginia was married,\nyet she looked hardly a day older than she had done when she knelt at\nthe girl's feet and envied her happiness while she pinned up the shining\ntrain. Failing love, she had filled her life with an inextinguishable\ncuriosity; and this passion, being independent of the desires of others,\nwas proof alike against disillusionment and the destructive processes of\ntime.\n\n\"So Mr. Treadwell has come home,\" she remarked, with a tentative\nflourish of the scissors. \"I declare he gets handsomer every day that\nhe lives. It suits him somehow to fill out, or it may be that I'm\npartial to fat like my poor mother before me.\"\n\n\"He does look well, but I'd hardly call him fat, would you?\"\n\n\"Well, he's stouter than he used to be, anyway. Did he say when he was\ngoing to take you back with him?\"\n\n\"Next Wednesday. We'll have to hurry to get this dress ready in time.\"\n\n\"I'll start right in at it. Have you made up your mind whether you'll\nhave it princess or a separate waist and skirt?\"\n\n\"I'm a little too thin for a princess gown, don't you think? Hadn't I\nbetter have it made like that black poplin which everybody thought\nlooked so well on me?\"\n\n\"But it ain't half so stylish as the princess. You just let me put a few\ncambric ruffles inside the bust and you'll stand out a plenty. I was\nreading in a fashion sheet only yesterday that they are trying to look\nas flat as they can manage in Paris.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll try it,\" murmured Virginia uncertainly, for her standards of\ndress were so vague that she was thankful to be able to rely on Miss\nWilly's self-constituted authority.\n\n\"You just leave it to me,\" was the dressmaker's reply, while she thrust\nthe point of the scissors into the gleaming brocade on the bed.\n\nThe morning passed so quickly amid cutting, basting, and gossip, that it\ncame as a surprise to Virginia when she heard the front door open and\nshut and Oliver's rapid step mounting the stairs. Meeting him in the\nhall, she led the way into her bedroom, and asked with the caressing,\nslightly conciliatory manner which expressed so perfectly her attitude\ntoward life:\n\n\"Did you see Uncle Cyrus?\"\n\n\"Yes, and he was nicer than I have ever known him to be. By the way,\nVirginia, I've transferred enough property to you to bring you in a\nseparate income. This was really what I went down about.\"\n\n\"But what is the matter, dear? Don't you feel well? Have you had any\nworries that you haven't told me?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right, but it's better so in case something should happen.\"\n\n\"But what could possibly happen? I never saw you look better. Miss Willy\nwas just saying so.\"\n\nHe turned away, not impatiently, but as one who is seeking to hide an\nemotion which has become too strong. Then without replying to her\nquestion, he muttered something about \"a number of letters to write\nbefore dinner,\" and hurried out of the room and downstairs to his study.\n\n\"I wonder if he has lost money,\" she thought, vaguely troubled, as she\ninstinctively straightened the brushes he had disarranged on the bureau.\n\"Poor Oliver! He seems to think about nothing but money now, and he used\nto be so romantic.\"\n\nHe used to be so romantic! She repeated this to Susan that evening when,\nafter Miss Willy's departure for the night, she took her friend into the\nspare room to show her the first shapings of the princess gown.\n\n\"Do you remember that we used to call him an incurable Don Quixote?\" she\nasked. \"And now he has become so different that at times it makes me\nsmile to think of him as he was when I first knew him. I suppose it's\nbetter so, it's more normal. He used to be what Uncle Cyrus called\n'flighty,' bent on reforming the world and on improving people, you\nknow, and now he doesn't seem to care whether outside things are good or\nbad, just as long as his plays go well and he can give us all the money\nwe want.\"\n\n\"It's natural, isn't it?\" asked Susan. \"One can't stay young forever,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"And yet in some ways he doesn't appear to be a bit older. I like his\nhair being grey, don't you? It makes his colour look even richer than\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, \"I like his hair and I like him. Only I wish he\ndidn't have to leave you by yourself so much of the time.\"\n\n\"He is going to take me back with him on Wednesday. Miss Willy is making\nthis dress for me to wear. I want to look nice because, of course,\neverybody will be noticing Oliver.\"\n\n\"It's lovely, and I'm sure you'll look as sweet as the angel that you\nare, Jinny,\" answered Susan, stooping to kiss her.\n\nBy Tuesday night the dress was finished, and Virginia was stuffing the\nsleeves with tissue paper before packing it into her trunk, when Oliver\ncame into the room and stood watching her in silence.\n\n\"I do hope it won't get crumpled,\" she said anxiously as she spread a\ntowel over the tray. \"Miss Willy is so proud of it, and I don't believe\nI could have got anything prettier in New York.\"\n\n\"Virginia,\" he said suddenly, \"you've set your heart on going to-morrow,\nhaven't you?\"\n\nTurning from the trunk, she looked up at him with a tender, inquiring\nsmile. Above her head the electric light, with which Oliver and the\ngirls had insisted on replacing the gas-jets that she preferred, cast a\nhard glitter over the hollowed lines of her face and over the thinning\ncurls which she had striven to brush back from her temples. Her figure,\nunassisted as yet by Miss Willy's ruffles, looked so fragile in the\npitiless glare that his heart melted in one of those waves of\nsentimentality which, because they were impotent to affect his conduct,\ncost him so little. As she stood there, he realized more acutely than he\nhad ever done before how utterly stationary she had remained since he\nmarried her. With her sweetness, her humility, her old-fashioned\ncourtesy and consideration for others, she belonged still in the\nhoney-scented twilight of the eighties. While he had moved with the\nworld, she, who was confirmed in the traditions of another age, had\nnever altered in spirit since that ecstatic moment when he had first\nloved her. The charm, the grace, the virtues, even the look of gentle\ngoodness which had won his heart, were all there just as they had been\nwhen she was twenty. Except for the fading flesh, the woman had not\nchanged; only the needs and the desires of the man were different. Only\nthe resurgent youth in him was again demanding youth for its mate.\n\n\"Why, my trunk is all packed,\" she replied. \"Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I was only wondering how you would manage to amuse yourself.\nYou know I shall be at the theatre most of the time.\"\n\n\"But you mustn't have me on your mind a minute, Oliver. I won't go a\nstep unless you promise me not to worry about me a bit. It's all so new\nto me that I shall enjoy just sitting in the hotel and watching the\npeople.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better go to the Waldorf. That might interest you more.\"\n\nHis eagerness to provide entertainment for her touched her as deeply as\nif it had been a proof of his love instead of his anxiety, and she\ndetermined in her heart that if she were lonesome a minute he must never\nsuspect it. Ennui, having its roots in an egoism she did not possess,\nwas unknown to her.\n\n\"That will be lovely, dear. Lucy wrote me when she was there on her\nwedding trip that she used to sit for hours in the corridor looking at\nthe people that went by, and that it was as good as a play.\"\n\n\"That settles it. I'll telegraph for rooms,\" he said cheerfully,\nrelieved to find that she fell in so readily with his suggestion.\n\nShe was giving a last caressing pat to the tray before closing the\ntrunk, and the look of her thin hands, with their slightly swollen\nknuckles, caused him to lean forward suddenly and wrest the keys away\nfrom her.\n\n\"Let me do that. I hate to see you stooping,\" he said.\n\nThe telegram was sent, and late the next evening, as they rolled through\nthe brilliant streets towards the hotel, Virginia's interest was as\neffervescent as if she were indeed the girl that she almost felt herself\nto have become. The sound of the streets excited her like martial music,\nand little gasps of surprise and pleasure broke from her lips as the\ntaxicab turned into Broadway. It was all so different from her other\nvisit when she had come alone to find Oliver, sick with failure, in the\ndismal bedroom of that hotel. Now it seemed to her that the city had\ngrown younger, that it was more awake, that it was brighter, gayer, and\nthat she herself had a part in its brightness and its gaiety. The crowds\non Broadway seemed keeping step to some happy tune, and she felt that\nher heart was dancing with them, so elated, so girlishly irresponsible\nwas her mood.\n\n\"Why, Oliver, there is a sign of your play with a picture of Miss\nOldcastle on it!\" she exclaimed delightedly, pointing to an\nadvertisement before a theatre they were passing. Then, suddenly, it\nappeared to her that the whole city was waving this advertisement.\nWherever she turned \"The Home\" stared back at her, an orgy of red and\nblue surrounding the smiling effigy of the actress. And this proof of\nOliver's fame thrilled her as she had not been thrilled since the\ntelegram had come announcing that Harry had won the scholarship which\nwould take him to Oxford. The woman's power of sinking her ambition and\neven her identity into the activities of the man was deeply interwoven\nwith all that was essential and permanent in her soul. Her keenest joys,\nas well as her sharpest sorrows, had never belonged to herself, but to\nothers. It was doubtful, indeed, if, since the day of her marriage, she\nhad been profoundly moved by any feeling which was centred merely in a\npersonal desire. She had wanted things for Oliver and for the children,\nbut for herself there had been no separate existence apart from them.\n\n\"Oliver, I never dreamed that it would be like this. The play will be a\ngreat success--even a greater one than the last, won't it, dear?\" Her\nface, with its exquisite look of exaltation, of self-forgetfulness, was\nturned eagerly towards the crowd of feverish pleasure-seekers that\npassed on, pursuing its little joys, under the garish signs of the\nstreet.\n\n\"Well, it ought to be,\" he returned; \"it's bad enough anyway.\"\n\nHis eyes, like hers, were fixed on the thronging streets, but, unlike\nhers, they reflected the restless animation, the pathetic hunger, which\nmade each of those passing faces appear to be the plastic medium of an\ninsatiable craving for life. Handsome, well-preserved, a little\nover-coloured, a little square of figure, with his look of worldly\nimportance, of assured material success, he stood to-day, as Cyrus had\nstood a quarter of a century ago, as an imposing example of that\nTreadwell spirit from which his youth had revolted.\n\nThat night, when they had finished dinner, and Oliver, in response to a\ntelephone message, had hurried down to the theatre, Virginia went\nupstairs to her room, and, after putting on the lavender silk\ndressing-gown which Miss Willy had made for the occasion, sat down to\nwrite her weekly letter to Harry.\n\n     MY DARLING BOY.\n\n     I know you will be surprised to see from this letter that I am\n     really in New York at last--and at the Waldorf! It seems almost\n     like a dream to me, and whenever I shut my eyes, I find myself\n     forgetting that I am not in Dinwiddie--but, you remember, your\n     father had always promised me that I should come for the first\n     night of his new play, which will be acted to-morrow. You simply\n     can't imagine till you get here how famous he is and how interested\n     people are in everything about him, even the smallest trifles.\n     Wherever you look you see advertisements of his plays (he has three\n     running now) and coming up Broadway for only a block or two last\n     night, I am sure that I saw Miss Oldcastle's picture a dozen times.\n     I should think she would hate dreadfully to have to make herself so\n     conspicuous--for she has a nice, refined face--but Oliver says all\n     actresses have to do it if they want to get on. He takes all the\n     fuss they make over him just as if he despised it, though I am sure\n     that in his heart he can't help being pleased. While we were having\n     dinner, everybody in the dining-room was turning to look at him,\n     and if I hadn't known, of course, that not a soul was thinking of\n     me, I should have felt badly because I hadn't time to change my\n     dress after I got here. All the other women were beautifully\n     dressed (I never dreamed that there were so many diamonds in the\n     world. Miss Willy would simply go crazy over them), but I didn't\n     mind a bit, and if anybody thought of me at all, of course, they\n     knew that I had just stepped off the train. After dinner your\n     father went to the theatre, and I sat downstairs alone in the\n     corridor for a while and watched the people coming and going. It\n     was perfectly fascinating at first. I never saw so many beautiful\n     women, and their hair was arranged in such a lovely way, all just\n     alike, that it must have taken hours to do each head. The fashions\n     that are worn here are not in the least like those of Dinwiddie,\n     though Miss Willy made my black brocade exactly like one in a\n     fashion plate that came directly from Paris, but I know that you\n     aren't as much interested in this as Lucy and Jenny would be. The\n     dear girls are both well, and Lucy is carried away with her\n     stepchildren. She says she doesn't see why every woman doesn't\n     marry a widower. Isn't that exactly like Lucy? She is always so\n     funny. If only one of you were here with me, I should enjoy every\n     minute, but after I'd sat there for a while in the midst of all\n     those strangers, I began to feel a little lonely, so I came\n     upstairs to write you this letter. New York is a fascinating place\n     to visit, but I am glad I live in Dinwiddie where everybody knows\n     me.\n\n     And now, my dearest boy, I must tell you how perfectly overjoyed I\n     was to get your last letter, and to know that you are so delighted\n     with Oxford. I think of you every minute, and I pray for you the\n     last thing at night before I get into bed. Try to keep well and\n     strong, and if you get a cold, be sure not to let it run on till it\n     turns to a hacking cough. Remember that Doctor Fraser always used\n     to say that every cough, no matter how slight, is dangerous. I hope\n     you aren't studying too hard or overdoing athletics. It is so easy\n     to tax one's strength too much when one gets excited. I am sure I\n     don't know what to think of the English students being\n     \"standoffish\" with Americans. It seems very foolish of them not to\n     be nice and friendly, especially to Virginians, who were really\n     English in the beginning. But I am glad that you don't mind, and\n     that you would rather be a countryman of George Washington than a\n     countryman of George the Third. Of course England is the greatest\n     country in the world--you remember your grandfather always said\n     that--and we owe it everything that we have, but I think it very\n     silly of English people to be stiff and ill-mannered.\n\n     I hope you still read your Bible, darling, and that you find time\n     to go to church once every Sunday. Even if it seems a waste of time\n     to you, it would have pleased your grandfather, and for his sake I\n     hope you will go whenever you can possibly do so. It was so sweet\n     of you to write in Addison's Walk because you did not want to miss\n     my Sunday letter and yet the day was too beautiful not to be out of\n     doors. God only knows, my boy, what a comfort you are to me. There\n     was never a better son nor one who was loved more devotedly.\n\n     YOUR MOTHER.\n\nIn the morning, with the breakfast tray, there arrived a bunch of\norchids from one of Oliver's theatrical friends, who had heard that his\nwife was in town; and while Virginia laid the box carefully in the\nbathtub, her eyes shone with the grateful light which came into them\nwhenever some one did her a small kindness or courtesy.\n\n\"They will be lovely for me to wear to-night, Oliver. It was so nice of\nhim to send them, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was rather nice,\" Oliver replied, looking up from his paper at\nthe pleased sound of her voice. Ever since his return at a late hour\nlast night, she had noticed the nervousness in his manner and had\nsympathetically attributed it to his anxiety about the fate of his play.\nIt was so like Oliver to be silent and self-absorbed when he was\nanxious.\n\nThrough the day he was absent, and when he returned, in the evening, to\ndress for the theatre, she was standing before the mirror fastening the\nbunch of orchids on the front of her gown. As he entered, she turned\ntoward him with a look of eager interest, of pleasant yet anxious\nexcitement. She had never in her life, except on the morning of her\nwedding day, taken so long to dress; but it seemed to her important that\nas Oliver's wife she should look as nice as she could.\n\n\"Am I all right?\" she asked timidly, while she cast a doubtful glance in\nthe mirror at the skirt of the black brocade.\n\n\"Yes, you're all right,\" he responded, without looking at her, and the\nsuppressed pain in his voice caused her to move suddenly toward him with\nthe question, \"Aren't you well, Oliver?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm well, but I'm tired. I had a headache on the way up and I\nhaven't been able to shake it off.\"\n\n\"Shall I get you something for it?\"\n\n\"No, it will pass. I'd like a nap, but I suppose it's time for me to\ndress.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's half-past six, and we've ordered dinner for seven.\"\n\nHe went into the dressing-room, and turning again to the mirror, she\nchanged the position of the bunch of orchids, and gave a little\ndissatisfied pat to the hair on her forehead. If only she could bring\nback some of the bloom and the freshness of youth! The glow had gone out\nof her eyes; the winged happiness, which had given her face the look as\nof one flying towards life, had passed, leaving her features a little\nwan and drawn, and fading her delicate skin to the colour of withered\nflowers. Yet the little smile, which lingered like autumn sunshine\naround her lips, was full of that sweetness which time could not\ndestroy, because it belonged not to her flesh, but to an unalterable\nquality of her soul; and this sweetness, which she exhaled like a\nfragrance, would cause perhaps one of a hundred strangers to glance\nafter her with the thought, \"How lovely that woman must once have been!\"\n\n\"Are you ready?\" asked Oliver, coming out of his dressing-room, and\nagain she started and turned quickly towards him, because it seemed to\nher that she was hearing his voice for the first time. So nervous, so\nirritable, so quivering with suppressed feeling, was the sound of it,\nthat she hesitated between the longing to offer sympathy and the fear\nthat her words might only add to his suffering.\n\n\"Yes, I am quite ready,\" she answered, without adding that she had been\nready for more than an hour; and picking up her wrap from the bed, she\npassed ahead of him through the door which he had opened. As he stopped\nto draw the key from the lock, her eyes rested with pride on the gloss\nof his hair, which had gone grey in the last year, and on his figure,\nwith its square shoulders and its look of obvious distinction, as of a\nman who had achieved results so emphatically that it was impossible\neither to overlook or to belittle them. How splendid he looked! And what\na pity that, after all his triumphs, he should still be so nervous on\nthe first night of a play!\n\nIn the elevator there was a woman in an ermine wrap, with Titian hair\nunder a jewelled net; and Virginia's eyes were suffused with pleasure as\nshe gazed at her. \"I never saw any one so beautiful!\" she exclaimed to\nOliver, as they stepped out into the hall; but he merely replied\nindifferently: \"Was she? I didn't notice.\" Then his tone lost its\ndeadness. \"If you'll wait here a minute, I'd like to speak to Cranston\nabout something,\" he said, almost eagerly. \"I shan't keep you a second.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me,\" she answered cheerfully, pleased at the sudden\nchange in his manner. \"Stay as long as you like. I never get tired\nwatching the people.\"\n\nHe hurried off, while, dazzled by the lights, she drew back behind a\nsheltering palm, and stood a little screened from the brilliant crowd in\nwhich she took such innocent pleasure. \"How I wish Miss Willy could be\nhere,\" she thought, for it was impossible for her to feel perfect\nenjoyment while there existed the knowledge that another person would\nhave found even greater delight in the scene than she was finding\nherself. \"How gay they all look--and there are not any old people.\nEverybody, even the white-haired women, dress as if they were girls. I\nwonder what it is that gives them all this gloss as if they had been\npolished, the same gloss that has come on Oliver since he has been so\nsuccessful? What a short time he stayed. He is coming back already, and\nevery single person is turning to look at him.\"\n\nThen a voice beyond the palm spoke as distinctly as if the words were\nuttered into her ear. \"That's Treadwell over there--a good-looking man,\nisn't he?--but have you seen the dowdy, middle-aged woman he is married\nto? It's a pity that all great men marry young--and now they say, you\nknow, that he is madly in love with Margaret Oldcastle----\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBITTERNESS\n\n\nIn the night, after a restless sleep, she awoke in terror. A hundred\nincidents, a hundred phrases, looks, gestures, which she had thought\nmeaningless until last evening, flashed out of the darkness and hung\nthere, blazing, against the background of the night. Yesterday these\nthings had appeared purposeless; and now it seemed to her that only her\nincredible blindness, only her childish inability to face any painful\nfact until it struck her between the eyes, had kept her from discovering\nthe truth before it was thrust on her by the idle chatter of strangers.\nA curious rigidity, as if she had been suddenly paralyzed, passed from\nher heart, which seemed to have ceased beating, and crept through her\nlimbs to her motionless hands and feet. Though she longed to call out\nand awaken Oliver, who, complaining of insomnia, spent the night in the\nadjoining room, this immobility, which was like the graven immobility of\ndeath, held her imprisoned there as speechless and still as if she lay\nin her coffin. Only her brain seemed on fire, so pitilessly, so horribly\nalive had it become.\n\nFrom the street beyond the dim square of the window, across which the\ncurtains were drawn, she could hear the ceaseless passing of carriages\nand motor cars; but her thoughts had grown so confused that for a long\nwhile, as she lay there, chill and rigid under the bed-clothes, she\ncould not separate the outside sounds from the tumult within her brain.\n\"Now that I know the truth I must decide what is best to do,\" she\nthought quite calmly. \"As soon as this noise stops I must think it all\nover and decide what is best to do.\" But around this one lucid idea the\ndiscordant roar of the streets seemed to gather force until it raged\nwith the violence of a storm. It was impossible to think clearly until\nthis noise, which, in some strange way, was both in the street outside\nand within the secret chambers of her soul, had subsided and given place\nto the quiet of night again. Then gradually the tempest of sound died\naway, and in the midst of the stillness which followed it she lived over\nevery hour, every minute, of that last evening when it had seemed to her\nthat she was crucified by Oliver's triumph. She saw him as he came\ntowards her down the shining corridor, easy, brilliant, impressive, a\nlittle bored by his celebrity, yet with the look of vital well-being, of\nsecond youth, which separated and distinguished him from the curious\ngazers among whom he moved. She saw him opposite to her during the long\ndinner, which she could not eat; she saw him beside her in the car which\ncarried them to the theatre; and clearer than ever, as if a burning iron\nhad seared the memory into her brain, she saw him lean on the railing of\nthe box, with his eyes on the stage where Margaret Oldcastle, against\nthe lowered curtain, smiled her charming smile at the house. It had been\na wonderful night, and through it all she had felt the iron nails of her\ncrucifixion driven into her soul.\n\nBreaking away from that chill of terror with which she had awakened,\nshe left the bed and went over to the window, where she drew the heavy\ncurtains aside. In Fifth Avenue the electric lights sparkled like frost\non the pavement, while beyond the roofs of the houses the first\nmelancholy glow of a winter's sunrise was suffusing the sky with red.\nWhile she watched it, a wave of unutterable loneliness swept over\nher--of that profound spiritual loneliness which comes to one at dawn in\na great city, when knowledge of the sleeping millions within reach seems\nonly to intensify the fact of individual littleness and isolation. She\nfelt that she stood alone, not merely in the world, but in the universe;\nand the thought that Oliver slept there in the next room made more\npoignant this feeling, as though she were solitary and detached in the\nmidst of limitless space. Even if she called him and he came to her, she\ncould not reach him. Even if he stood at her side, the immeasurable\ndistance between them would not lessen.\n\nWhen the morning came, she dressed herself in her prettiest gown, a\nviolet cloth, with ruffles of old lace at the throat and wrists; but\nthis dress, of which she had been so proud in Dinwiddie that she had\nsaved it for months in order to have it fresh for New York, appeared\nsomehow to have lost its charm and distinction, and she knew that last\nevening had not only destroyed her happiness, but had robbed her of her\nconfidence in the taste and the workmanship of Miss Willy. Knowledge,\nshe saw now, had shattered the little beliefs of life as well as the\nlarge ones.\n\nOliver liked to breakfast in his dressing-gown, fresh from his bath and\neager for the papers, so when he came hurriedly into the sitting-room,\nthe shining tray was already awaiting him, and she sat pouring his\ncoffee in a band of sunlight beside the table. This sunlight, so\nmerciful to the violet gown, shone pitilessly on the darkened hollows\nwhich the night had left under her eyes, and on the little lines which\nhad gathered around her bravely smiling mouth.\n\n\"It was a wonderful success, all the papers say so, Oliver,\" she said,\nwhen he had seated himself at the other end of the table and taken the\ncoffee from her hand, which shook in spite of her effort.\n\n\"Yes, it went off well, there's no doubt of it,\" he answered cheerfully,\nso cheerfully that for a minute a blind hope shot trembling through her\nmind. Could it all have been a dream? Was there some dreadful mistake?\nWould she presently discover that she had imagined that night of useless\nagony through which she had passed?\n\n\"The audience was so sympathetic. I saw a number of women crying in the\nlast act when the heroine comes back to her old home.\"\n\n\"It caught them. I thought it would. It's the kind of thing they like.\"\n\nHe opened a paper as he spoke, and seeing that he wanted to read the\ncriticisms, she broke his eggs for him, and then turning to her own\nbreakfast tried in vain to swallow the piece of toast which she had\nbuttered. But it was useless. She could not eat; she could not even\ndrink her coffee, which had stood so long that it had grown tepid. A\nfeeling of spiritual nausea, beside which all physical sensations were\nas trivial and meaningless as the stinging of wasps, pervaded her soul\nand body, and choked her, like unshed tears, whenever she tried to force\na bit of food between her trembling lips. All the casual interests with\nwhich she filled her days, those seemingly small, yet actually\ntremendous interests without which daily life becomes almost unlivable,\nflagged suddenly and died while she sat there. Nothing mattered any\nlonger, neither the universe nor that little circle of it which she\ninhabited, neither life nor death, neither Oliver's success nor the food\nwhich she was trying to eat. This strange sickness which had fallen upon\nher affected not only her soul and body, but everything that surrounded\nher, every person or object at which she looked, every stranger in the\nstreet below, every roof which she could see sharply outlined against\nthe glittering blue of the sky. Something had passed out of them all,\nsome essential quality which united them to reality, some inner secret\nof being without which the animate and the inanimate alike became no\nbetter than phantoms. The spirit which made life vital had gone out of\nthe world. And she felt that this would always be so, that the next\nminute and the next year and all the years that came afterwards would\nbring to her merely the effort of living--since Life, having used her\nfor its dominant purpose, had no further need of her. Once only the\nthought occurred to her that there were women who might keep their own\neven now by fighting against the loss of it, by passionately refusing to\nsurrender what they could no longer hold as a gift. But with the idea\nthere came also that self-knowledge which told her that she was not one\nof these. The strength in her was the strength of passiveness; she could\nendure, but she could not battle. Long ago, as long ago as the night on\nwhich she had watched in the shadow of death beside Harry's bed, she\nhad lost that energy of soul which had once flamed up in her with her\nthree days' jealousy of Abby. It was her youth and beauty then which had\ninspirited her, and she was wise enough to know that the passions which\nbecome youth appear ridiculous in middle-age.\n\nHaving drunk his coffee, Oliver passed his cup to her, and laid down his\npaper.\n\n\"You look tired, Virginia. I hope it hasn't been too much for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Have you quite got over your headache?\"\n\n\"Pretty much, but those lights last night were rather trying. Don't put\nany cream in this time. I want the stimulant.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it has got cold. Shall I ring for fresh?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter. This will do quite as well. Have you any shopping\nthat you would like to do this morning?\"\n\nShopping! When her whole world had crumbled around her! For an instant\nthe lump in her throat made speech impossible; then summoning that mild\nyet indestructible spirit, which was as the spirit of all those\ngenerations of women who lived in her blood, she answered gently:\n\n\"Yes, I had intended to buy some presents for the girls.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better take a taxicab for the morning. I suppose you know\nthe names of the shops you want to go to?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I know the names. Are you going to the theatre?\"\n\n\"I've got to change a few lines in the play, and the sooner I go about\nit the better.\"\n\n\"Then don't bother about me, dear. I'll just put on my long coat over\nthis dress and go out right after breakfast.\"\n\n\"But you haven't eaten anything,\" he remarked, glancing at her plate.\n\n\"I wasn't hungry. The fresh air will do me good. It has turned so much\nwarmer, and the snow is all melting.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she rose from the table and began to prepare herself for\nthe street, putting on the black hat with the ostrich tip and the bunch\nof violets on one side, which didn't seem just right since she had come\nto New York, and carefully wrapping the ends of her fur neck-piece\naround her throat. It was already ten o'clock, for Oliver had slept\nlate, and she must be hurrying if she hoped to get through her shopping\nbefore luncheon. While she dressed, a wan spirit of humour entered into\nher, and she saw how absurd it was that she should rush about from shop\nto shop, buying things that did not matter in order to fill a life that\nmattered as little as they did. To her, whose mental outlook had had in\nit so little humour, it seemed suddenly that the whole of life was\nridiculous. Why should she have sat there, pouring Oliver's coffee and\ntalking to him about insignificant things, when her heart was bursting\nwith this sense of something gone out of existence, with this torturing\nrealization of the irretrievable failure of love?\n\nTaking up her muff and her little black bag from the bureau, she looked\nback at him with a smile as she turned towards the door.\n\n\"Good-bye. Will you be here for luncheon?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't. I've an appointment down-town, but I'll come back\nas early as I can.\"\n\nThen she went out and along the hall to the elevator, in which there was\na little girl, who reminded her of Jenny, in charge of a governness in\nspectacles. She smiled at her almost unconsciously, so spontaneous, so\ninterwoven with her every mood was her love for children; but the little\ngirl, being very proper for her years, did not smile back, and a stab of\npain went through Virginia's heart.\n\n\"Even children have ceased to care for me,\" she thought.\n\nAt the door, where she waited a few minutes for her taxicab, a young\nbride, with her eyes shining with joy, stood watching her husband while\nhe talked with an acquaintance, and it seemed to Virginia that it was a\nvision of her own youth which had risen to torment her. \"That was the\nway I looked at Oliver twenty-five years ago,\" she said to herself;\n\"twenty-five years ago, when I was young and he loved me.\" Then, even\nwhile the intolerable pain was still in her heart, she felt that\nsomething of the buoyant hopefulness of that other bride entered into\nher and restored her courage. A resolution, so new that it was born of\nthe joyous glance of a stranger, and yet so old that it seemed a part of\nthat lost spirit of youth which had once carried her in a wild race over\nthe Virginian meadows, a resolution which belonged at the same time to\nthis other woman and to herself, awoke in her and mingled like a draught\nof wine with her blood. \"I will not give up,\" she thought. \"I will go to\nher. Perhaps she does not know--perhaps she does not understand. I will\ngo to her, and everything may be different.\" Then her taxicab was\ncalled, and stepping into it, she gave the name not of a shop, but of\nthe apartment house in which Margaret Oldcastle lived.\n\nIt was one of those February days when, because of the promise of spring\nin the air, men begin suddenly to think of April. The sky was of an\nintense blue, with little clouds, as soft as feathers, above the western\nhorizon. On the pavement the last patches of snow were rapidly melting,\nand the gentle breeze which blew in at the open window of the cab, was\nlike a caressing breath on Virginia's cheek. \"It must be that she does\nnot understand,\" she repeated, and this thought gave her confidence and\nfilled her with that unconquerable hope of the future without which she\nfelt that living would be impossible. Even the faces in the street\ncheered her, for it seemed to her that if life were really what she had\nbelieved it to be last night, these men and women could not walk so\nbuoyantly, could not smile so gaily, could not spend so much thought and\ntime on the way they looked and the things they wore. \"No, it must have\nbeen a mistake, a ghastly mistake,\" she insisted almost passionately.\n\"Some day we shall laugh over it together as we laughed over my jealousy\nof Abby. He never loved Abby, not for a minute, and yet I imagined that\nhe did and suffered agony because of it.\" And her taxicab went on\nmerrily between the cheerful crowds on the pavements, gliding among\ngorgeous motor cars and carriages drawn by high-stepping horses and\npedlers' carts drawn by horses that stepped high no longer, among rich\npeople and poor people, among surfeited people and hungry people, among\ngay people and sad people, among contented people and rebellious\npeople--among all these, who hid their happiness or their sorrow under\nthe mask of their features, her cab spun onward bearing her lightly on\nthe most reckless act of her life.\n\nAt the door of the apartment house she was told that Miss Oldcastle\ncould not be seen, but, after sending up her card and waiting a few\nmoments in the hall before a desk which reminded her of a gilded\nsquirrel-cage, she was escorted to the elevator and borne upward to the\nninth landing. Here, in response to the tinkle of a little bell outside\nof a door, she was ushered into a reception room which was so bare alike\nof unnecessary furniture and of the Victorian tradition to which she was\naccustomed, that for an instant she stood confused by the very\nstrangeness of her surroundings. Then a charming voice, with what\nsounded to her ears as an affected precision of speech, said: \"Mrs.\nTreadwell, this is so good of you!\" and, turning, she found herself face\nto face with the other woman in Oliver's life.\n\n\"I saw you at the play last night,\" the voice went on, \"and I hoped to\nget a chance to speak to you, but the reporters simply invaded my\ndressing-room. Won't you sit here in the sunshine? Shall I close the\nwindow, or, like myself, are you a worshipper of the sun?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, leave it open. I like it.\" At any other moment she would have\nbeen afraid of an open window in February; but it seemed to her now that\nif she could not feel the air in her face she should faint. With the\nfirst sight of Margaret Oldcastle, as she looked into that smiling\nface, in which the inextinguishable youth was less a period of life than\nan attribute of spirit, she realized that she was fighting not a woman,\nbut the very structure of life. The glamour of the footlights had\ncontributed nothing to the flame-like personality of the actress. In her\nsimple frock of brown woollen, with a wide collar of white lawn turned\nback from her splendid throat, she embodied not so much the fugitive\ncharm of youth, as that burning vitality over which age has no power.\nThe intellect in her spoke through her noble rather than beautiful\nfeatures, through her ardent eyes, through her resolute mouth, through\nevery perfect gesture with which she accompanied her words. She stood\nnot only for the elemental forces, but for the free woman; and her\nfreedom, like that of man, had been built upon the strewn bodies of the\nweaker. The law of sacrifice, which is the basic law of life, ruled here\nas it ruled in mother-love and in the industrial warfare of men. Her\ntriumph was less the triumph of the individual than of the type. The\njustice not of society, but of nature, was on her side, for she was one\nwith evolution and with the resistless principle of change. Vaguely,\nwithout knowing that she realized these things, Virginia felt that the\nstruggle was useless; and with the sense of failure there awoke in her\nthat instinct of good breeding, that inherited obligation to keep the\nsurface of life sweet, which was so much older and so much stronger than\nthe revolt in her soul.\n\n\"You were wonderful last night. I wanted to tell you how wonderful I\nthought you,\" she said gently. \"You made the play a success--all the\npapers say so this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, it was an easy play to make successful,\" replied the other, while\na fleeting curiosity, as though she were trying to explain something\nwhich she did not quite understand, appeared in her face and made it,\nwith its redundant vitality, almost coarse for an instant. \"It's the\nkind the public wants, you couldn't help making it go.\"\n\nThe almost imperceptible conflict which had flashed in their eyes when\nthey met, had died suddenly down, and the dignity which had been on the\nside of the other woman appeared to have passed from her to Virginia.\nThis dignity, which was not that of triumph, but of a defeat which\nsurrenders everything except the inviolable sanctities of the spirit,\nshielded her like an impenetrable armour against both resentment and\npity. She stood there wrapped in a gentleness more unassailable than any\npassion.\n\n\"You did a great deal for it and a great deal for my husband,\" she said,\nwhile her voice lingered unconsciously over the word. \"He has told me\noften that without your acting he could never have reached the position\nhe holds.\"\n\nThen, because it was impossible to say the things she had come to say,\nbecause even in the supreme crises of life she could not lay down the\nmanner of a lady, she smiled the grave smile with which her mother had\nwalked through a ruined country, and taking up her muff, which she had\nlaid on the table, passed out into the hall. She had let the chance go\nby, she had failed in her errand, yet she knew that, even though it cost\nher her life, even though it cost her a thing far dearer than life--her\nhappiness--she could not have done otherwise. In the crucial moment it\nwas principle and not passion which she obeyed; but this principle,\nfiltering down through generations, had become so inseparable from the\nsources of character, that it had passed at last through the intellect\ninto the blood. She could no more have bared her soul to that other\nwoman than she could have stripped her body naked in the market-place.\n\nAt the door her cab was still waiting, and she gave the driver the name\nof the toy shop at which she intended to buy presents for Lucy's\nstepchildren. Though her heart was breaking within her, there was no\nimpatience in her manner when she was obliged to wait some time before\nshe could find the particular sort of doll for which Lucy had written;\nand she smiled at the apologetic shopgirl with the forbearing\nconsideration for others which grief could not destroy. She put her own\nanguish aside as utterly in the selection of the doll as she would have\ndone had it been the peace of nations and not a child's pleasure that\ndepended upon her effacement of self. Then, when the purchase was made,\nshe took out her shopping list from her bag and passed as\nconscientiously to the choice of Jenny's clothes. Not until the morning\nhad gone, and she rolled again up Fifth Avenue towards the hotel, did\nshe permit her thoughts to return to the stifled agony within her heart.\n\nTo her surprise Oliver was awaiting her in their sitting-room, and with\nher first look into his face, she understood that he had reached in her\nabsence a decision against which he had struggled for days. For an\ninstant her strength seemed fainting as before an impossible effort.\nThen the shame in his eyes awoke in her the longing to protect him, to\nspare him, to make even this terrible moment easier for him than he\ncould make it alone. With the feeling, a crowd of memories thronged\nthrough her mind, as though called there by that impulse to shield which\nwas so deeply interwoven with the primal passion of motherhood. She saw\nOliver's face as it had looked on that spring afternoon when she had\nfirst seen him; she saw it as he put the ring on her hand at the altar;\nshe saw it bending over her after the birth of her first child; and then\nsuddenly his face changed to the face of Harry, and she saw again the\nlittle bed under the hanging sheet and herself sitting there in the\nfaintly quivering circle of light. She watched again the slow fall of\nthe leaves, one by one, as they turned at the stem and drifted against\nthe white curtains of the window across the street.\n\n\"Oliver,\" she said gently, so gently that she might have been speaking\nto her sick child, \"would you rather that I should go back to Dinwiddie\nto-night?\"\n\nHe did not answer, but, turning away from her, laid his head down on his\narm, which he had outstretched on the table, and she saw a shiver of\npain pass through his body as if it had been struck a physical blow. And\njust as she had put herself aside when she bought the doll, so now she\nforgot her own suffering in the longing to respond to his need.\n\n\"I can take the night train--now that I have seen the play there is no\nreason why I should stay. I have got through my shopping.\"\n\nRaising his head, he looked up into her face. \"Whatever happens,\nVirginia, will you believe that I never wanted to hurt you?\" he asked.\n\nFor a moment she felt that the strain was intolerable, and a fear\nentered her mind lest she should faint or weep and so make things harder\nthan they should be able to bear.\n\n\"You mean that something must happen--that there will be a break between\nus?\" she said.\n\nLeaving the table, he walked to the window and back before he answered\nher.\n\n\"I can't go on this way. I'm not that sort. A generation ago, I suppose,\nwe should have done it--but we've lost grip, we've lost endurance.\" Then\nhe cried out suddenly, as if he were justifying himself: \"It is hell.\nI've been in hell for a year--don't you see it?\"\n\nAfter his violence, her voice sounded almost lifeless, so quiet, so\nutterly free from passion, was its quality.\n\n\"As long as that--for a year?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, longer, but it has got worse. It has got unendurable. I've\nfought--God knows I've fought--but I can't stand it. I've got to do\nsomething. I've got to find a way. You must have seen it coming,\nVirginia. You must have seen that this thing is stronger than I am.\"\n\n\"Do--do you want her so much?\" and she, who had learned from life not to\nwant, looked at him with the pity which he might have seen in her eyes\nhad he stabbed her.\n\n\"So much that I'm going mad. There's no other end to it. It's been\ncoming on for two years--all the time I've been away from Dinwiddie I've\nbeen fighting it.\"\n\nShe did not answer, and when, after the silence had grown oppressive, he\nturned back from the window through which he had been gazing, he could\nnot be sure that she had heard him. So still she seemed that she was\nlike a woman of marble.\n\n\"You're too good for me, that's the trouble. You've been too good for me\nfrom the beginning,\" he said.\n\nUnfastening her coat, which she had kept on, she laid it on the sofa at\nher back, and then put up her hands to take out her hatpins.\n\n\"I must pack my things,\" she said suddenly. \"Will you engage my berth\nback to Dinwiddie for to-night?\"\n\nHe nodded without speaking, and she added hastily, \"I shan't go down\nagain before starting. But there is no need that you should go to the\ntrain with me.\"\n\nAt this he turned back from the door where he had waited with his hand\non the knob. \"Won't you let me do even that?\" he asked, and his voice\nsounded so like Harry's that a sob broke from her lips. The point was so\nsmall a one--all points seemed to her so small--that her will died down\nand she yielded without protest. What did it matter--what did anything\nmatter to her now?\n\n\"I'll send up your luncheon,\" he added almost gratefully. \"You will be\nill if you don't eat something.\"\n\n\"No, please don't. I am not hungry,\" she answered, and then he went out\nsoftly, as though he were leaving a sick-room, and left her alone with\nher anguish--and her packing.\n\nWithout turning in her chair, without taking off her hat, from which she\nhad drawn the pins, she sat there like a woman in whom the spirit has\nbeen suddenly stricken. Beyond the window the perfect day, with its\nhaunting reminder of the spring, was lengthening slowly into afternoon,\nand through the slant sunbeams the same gay crowd passed in streams on\nthe pavements. On the roof of one of the opposite houses a flag was\nflying, and it seemed to her that the sight of that flag waving under\nthe blue sky was bound up forever with the intolerable pain in her\nheart. And with that strange passivity of the nerves which nature\nmercifully sends to those who have learned submission to suffering, to\nthose whose strength is the strength, not of resistance, but of\nendurance, she felt that as long as she sat there, relaxed and\nmotionless, she had in a way withdrawn herself from the struggle to\nlive. If she might only stay like this forever, without moving, without\nthinking, without feeling, while she died slowly, inch by inch, spirit\nand body.\n\nA knock came at the door, and as she moved to answer it, she felt that\nlife returned in a slow throbbing agony, as if her blood were forced\nback again into veins from which it had ebbed. When the tray was placed\non the table beside her, she looked up with a mild, impersonal curiosity\nat the waiter, as the dead might look back from their freedom and\ndetachment on the unreal figures of the living. \"I wonder what he thinks\nabout it all?\" she thought vaguely, as she searched in her bag for his\ntip. \"I wonder if he sees how absurd and unnecessary all the things are\nthat he does day after day, year after year, like the rest of us? I\nwonder if he ever revolts with this unspeakable weariness from waiting\non other people and watching them eat?\" But the waiter, with his long\nsallow face, his inscrutable eyes, and his general air of having\npetrified under the surface, was as enigmatical as life.\n\nAfter he had gone out, she rose from her untasted luncheon, and going\ninto her bedroom, took the black brocaded gown off the hanger and\nstuffed the sleeves with tissue paper as carefully as if the world had\nnot crumbled around her. Then she packed away her wrapper and her\nbedroom slippers and shook out and folded the dresses she had not worn.\nFor a time she worked on mechanically, hardly conscious of what she was\ndoing, hardly conscious even that she was alive. Then slowly, softly,\nlike a gentle rain, her tears fell into the trunk, on each separate\ngarment as she smoothed it and laid it away.\n\nAt half-past eight o'clock she was waiting with her hat and coat on when\nOliver came in, followed by the porter who was to take down her bags.\nShe knew that he had brought the man in order to avoid all possibility\nof an emotional scene; and she could have smiled, had her spirit been\nless wan and stricken, at this sign of a moral cowardice which was so\ncharacteristic. It was his way, she understood now, though she did not\nput the thought into words, to take what he wanted, escaping at the same\ntime the price which nature exacts of those who have not learned to\nrelinquish. Out of the strange colourless stillness which surrounded\nher, some old words of Susan's floated back to her as if they were\nspoken aloud: \"A Treadwell will always get the thing he wants most in\nthe end.\" But while he stabbed her, he would look away in order that he\nmight be spared the memory of her face.\n\nWithout a word, she followed her bags from the room without a word she\nentered the elevator, which was waiting, and without a word she took her\nplace in the taxicab standing beside the curbstone. There was no\nrebellion in her thoughts, merely a dulled consciousness of pain, like\nthe consciousness of one who is partially under an an\u00c3\u00a6sthetic. The\nfighting courage, the violence of revolt, had no part in her soul, which\nhad been taught to suffer and to renounce with dignity, not with\nheroics. Her submission was the submission of a flower that bends to a\nstorm.\n\nAs she sat there in silence, with her eyes on the brilliant street,\nwhere the signs of his play stared back at her under the flaring lights,\nshe began to think with automatic precision, as though her brain were\nmoved by some mechanical power over which she had no control. Little\nthings crowded into her mind--the face of the doll she had bought for\nLucy's stepchild that morning, the words on one of the electric signs on\nthe top of a building they were passing, the leopard skin coat worn by a\nwoman on the pavement. And these little things seemed to her at the\nmoment to be more real, more vital, than her broken heart and the\nknowledge that she was parting from Oliver. The agony of the night and\nthe morning appeared to have passed away like a physical pang, leaving\nonly this deadness of sensation and the strange, almost unearthly\nclearness of external objects. \"It is not new. It has been coming on for\nyears,\" she thought. \"He said that, and it is true. It is so old that it\nhas been here forever, and I seem to have been suffering it all my\nlife--since the day I was born, and before the day I was born. It seems\nolder than I am. Oliver is going from me. He has always been going from\nme--always since the beginning,\" she repeated slowly, as if she were\ntrying to learn a lesson by heart. But so remote and shadowy did the\nwords appear, that she found herself thinking the next instant, \"I must\nhave forgotten my smelling-salts. The bottle was lying on the bureau,\nand I can't remember putting it into my bag.\" The image of this little\nglass bottle, with the gold top, which she had left behind was distinct\nin her memory; but when she tried to think of the parting from Oliver\nand of all that she was suffering, everything became shadowy and unreal\nagain.\n\nAt the station she stood beside the porter while he paid the driver, and\nthen entering the doorway, they walked hurriedly, so hurriedly that she\nfelt as if she were losing her breath, in the direction of the gate and\nthe waiting train. And with each step, as they passed down the long\nplatform, which seemed to stretch into eternity, she was thinking: \"In a\nminute it will be over. If I don't say something now, it will be too\nlate. If I don't stop him now, it will be over forever--everything will\nbe over forever.\"\n\nBeside the night coach, in the presence of the conductor and the porter,\nwho stood blandly waiting to help her into the train, she stopped\nsuddenly, as though she could not go any farther, as though the strength\nwhich had supported her until now had given way and she were going to\nfall. Through her mind there flashed the thought that even now she might\nhold him if she were to make a scene, that if she were to go into\nhysterics he would not leave her, that if she were to throw away her\npride and her self-respect and her dignity, she might recover by\nviolence the outer shell at least of her happiness. How could he break\naway from her if she were only to weep and to cling to him? Then, while\nthe idea was still in her mind, she knew that to a nature such as hers\nviolence was impossible. It took passion to war with passion, and in\nthis she was lacking. Though she were wounded to the death, she could\nnot revolt, could not shriek out in her agony, could not break through\nthat gentle yet invincible reticence which she had won from the past.\n\nDown the long platform a child came running with cries of pleasure,\nfollowed by a man with a red beard, who carried a suitcase. As they\napproached the train, Virginia entered the coach, and walked rapidly\ndown the aisle to where the porter was waiting beside her seat.\n\nFor the first time since they had reached the station Oliver spoke. \"I\nam sorry I couldn't get the drawing-room for you,\" he said. \"I am afraid\nyou will be crowded\"; and this anxiety about her comfort, when he was\nruining her life, did not strike either of them, at the moment, as\nridiculous.\n\n\"It does not matter,\" she answered; and he put out his hand.\n\n\"Good-bye, Virginia,\" he said, with a catch in his voice.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she responded quietly, and would have given her soul for the\npower to shriek aloud, to overcome this indomitable instinct which was\nstronger than her personal self.\n\nTurning away, he passed between the seats to the door of the coach, and\na minute later she saw his figure hurrying back along the platform down\nwhich they had come together a few minutes ago.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\n\nA chill rain was falling when Virginia got out of the train the next\nmorning, and the raw-boned nags hitched to the ancient \"hacks\" in the\nstreet appeared even more dejected and forlorn than she had remembered\nthem. Then one of the noisy negro drivers seized her bag, and a little\nlater she was rolling up the long hill in the direction of her home.\nDinwiddie was the same; nothing had altered there since she had left\nit--and yet what a difference! The same shops were unclosing their\nshutters; the same crippled negro beggar was taking his place at the\ncorner of the market; the same maids were sweeping the sidewalks with\nthe same brooms; the same clerk bowed to her from the drug store where\nshe bought her medicines; and yet something--the only thing which had\never interested her in these people and this place--had passed out of\nthem. Just as in New York yesterday, when she had watched the sunrise,\nso it seemed to her now that the spirit of reality had faded out of the\nworld. What remained was merely a mirage in which phantoms in the guise\nof persons made a pretence of being alive.\n\nThe front door of her house stood open, and on the porch one of the\ncoloured maids was beating the dust out of the straw mat. \"As if dust\nmakes any difference when one is dead,\" Virginia thought wearily; and\nan unutterable loathing passed over her for all the little acts by which\none rendered tribute to the tyranny of appearances. Then, as she entered\nthe house, she felt that the sight of the familiar objects she had once\nloved oppressed her as though the spirit of melancholy resided in the\npieces of furniture, not in her soul. This weariness, so much worse than\npositive pain, filled her with disgust for all the associations and the\nsentiments she had known in the past. Not only the house and the\nfurniture and the small details of housekeeping, but the street and the\ntown and every friendly face of a neighbour, had become an intolerable\nreminder that she was still alive.\n\nIn her room, where a bright fire was burning, and letters from the girls\nlay on the table, she sat down in her wraps and gazed with unseeing eyes\nat the flames. \"The children must not know. I must keep it from the\nchildren as long as possible,\" she thought dully, and it was so natural\nto her to plan sparing them, that for a minute the idea took her mind\naway from her own anguish. \"If I could only die like this, then they\nneed never know,\" she found herself reflecting coldly a little later, so\ncoldly that she seemed to have no personal interest, no will to choose\nin the matter. \"If I could only die like this, nobody need be\nhurt--except Harry,\" she added.\n\nFor the first time, with the thought of Harry, her restraint suddenly\nfailed her. \"Yes, it would hurt Harry. I must live because Harry would\nwant me to,\" she said aloud; and as though her strength were reinforced\nby the words, she rose and prepared herself to go downstairs to\nbreakfast--prepared herself, too, for the innumerable little agonies\nwhich would come with the day, for the sight of Susan, for the visits\nfrom the neighbours, for the eager questions about the fashions in New\nYork which Miss Willy would ask. And all the time she was thinking\nclearly, \"It can't last forever. It must end some time. Who knows but it\nmay stop the next minute, and one can stand a minute of anything.\"\n\nThe day passed, the week, the month, and gradually the spring came and\nwent, awakening life in the trees, in the grass, in the fields, but not\nin her heart. Even the dried sticks in the yard put out shoots of living\ngreen and presently bore blossoms, and in the borders by the front gate,\nthe crocuses, which she had planted with her own hands a year ago, were\nablaze with gold. All nature seemed joining in the resurrection of life,\nall nature, except herself, seemed to flower again to fulfilment. She\nalone was dead, and she alone among the dead must keep up this pretence\nof living which was so much harder than death.\n\nOnce every week she wrote to the children, restrained yet gently flowing\nletters in which there was no mention of Oliver. It had been so long,\nindeed, since either Harry or the girls had associated their parents\ntogether, that the omission called forth no question, hardly, she\ngathered, any surprise. Their lives were so full, their interests were\nso varied, that, except at the regular intervals when they sat down to\nwrite to her, it is doubtful if they ever seriously wondered about her.\nIn July, Jenny came home for a month, and Lucy wrote regretfully that\nshe was \"so disappointed that she couldn't join mother somewhere in the\nmountains\"; but beyond this, the girls' lives hardly appeared to touch\nhers even on the surface. In the month that Jenny spent in Dinwiddie,\nshe organized a number of societies and clubs for the improvement of\nconditions among working girls, and in spite of the intense heat (the\nhottest spell of the summer came while she was there), she barely\nallowed herself a minute for rest or for conversation with her mother.\n\n\"If you would only go to the mountains, mother,\" she remarked the\nevening before she left. \"I am sure it isn't good for you to stay in\nDinwiddie during the summer.\"\n\n\"I am used to it,\" replied Virginia a little stubbornly, for it seemed\nto her at the moment that she would rather die than move.\n\n\"But you ought to think of your health. What does father say about it?\"\n\nA contraction of pain crossed Virginia's face, but Jenny, whose vision\nwas so wide that it had a way of overlooking things which were close at\nhand, did not observe it.\n\n\"He hasn't said anything,\" she answered, with a strange stillness of\nvoice.\n\n\"I thought he meant to take you to England, but I suppose his plays are\nkeeping him in New York.\"\n\nRising from her chair at the table--they had just finished\nsupper--Virginia reached for a saucer and filled it with ice cream from\na bowl in front of her.\n\n\"I think I'll send Miss Priscilla a little of this cream,\" she remarked.\n\"She is so fond of strawberry.\"\n\nThe next day Jenny went, and again the silence and the loneliness\nsettled upon the house, to which Virginia clung with a morbid terror of\nchange. Had her spirit been less broken, she might have made the effort\nof going North as Jenny had urged her to do, but when her life was over,\none place seemed as desirable as another, and it was a matter of\nprofound indifference to her whether it was heat or cold which afflicted\nher body. She was probably the only person in Dinwiddie who did not hang\nout of her window during the long nights in search of a passing breeze.\nBut with that physical insensibility which accompanies prolonged torture\nof soul, she had ceased to feel the heat, had ceased even to feel the\nold neuralgic pain in her temples. There were times when it seemed to\nher that if a pin were stuck into her body she should not know it. The\none thing she asked--and this Life granted her except during the four\nweeks of Jenny's visit--was freedom from the need of exertion, freedom\nfrom the obligation to make decisions. Her housekeeping she left now to\nthe servants, so she was spared the daily harassing choices of the\nmarket and the table. There remained nothing for her to do, nothing even\nfor her to worry about, except her broken heart. Her friends she had\navoided ever since her return from New York, partly from an unbearable\nshrinking from the questions which she knew they would ask whenever they\nmet her, partly because her mind was so engrossed with the supreme fact\nthat her universe lay in ruins, that she found it impossible to lend a\ncasual interest to other matters. She, who had effaced herself for a\nlifetime, found suddenly that she could not see beyond the immediate\npresence of her own suffering.\n\nUsually she stayed closely indoors through the summer days, but several\ntimes, at the hour of dusk, she went out alone and wandered for hours\nabout the streets which were associated with her girlhood. In High\nStreet, at the corner where she had first seen Oliver, she stood one\nevening until Miss Priscilla, who had caught sight of her from the porch\nof the Academy (which, owing to the changing fashions in education and\nthe infirmities of the teacher, was the Academy no longer), sent out her\nnegro maid to beg her to come in and sit with her. \"No, I'm only looking\nfor something,\" Virginia had answered, while she hurried back past the\nchurch and down the slanting street to the twelve stone steps which led\nup the terraced hillside at the rectory. Here, in the purple summer\ntwilight, spangled with fireflies, she felt for a minute that her youth\nwas awaiting her; and opening the gate, she passed as softly as a ghost\nalong the crooked path to the two great paulownias, which were beginning\nto decay, and to the honeysuckle arbour, where the tendrils of the\ncreeper brushed her hair like a caress. Under the light of a young moon,\nit seemed to her that nothing had changed since that spring evening when\nshe had stood there and felt the wonder of first love awake in her\nheart. Nothing had changed except that love and herself. The paulownias\nstill shed their mysterious shadows about her, the red and white roses\nstill bloomed by the west wing of the house, the bed of mint still grew,\nrank and fragrant, beneath the dining-room window. When she put her hand\non the bole of the tree beside which she stood, she could still feel the\ninitials V. O. which Oliver had cut there in the days before their\nmarriage. A light burned in the window of the room which had been the\nparlour in the days when she lived there, and as she gazed at it, she\nalmost expected to see the face of her mother, with its look of pathetic\ncheerfulness, smiling at her through the small greenish panes. And then\nthe past in which Oliver had no part, the past which belonged to her and\nto her parents, that hallowed, unforgettable past of her childhood,\nwhich seemed bathed in love as in a flood of light--this past enveloped\nher as the magic of the moonbeams enveloped the house in which she had\nlived. While she stood there, it was more living than the present, more\nreal than the aching misery in her heart.\n\nThe door of the house opened and shut; she heard a step on the gravelled\npath; and bending forward out of the shadow, she waited breathlessly for\nthe sound of her father's voice. But it was a young rector, who had\nrecently accepted the call to Saint James' Church, and his boyish face,\nrising out of the sacred past, awoke her with a shock from the dream\ninto which she had fallen.\n\n\"Good-evening, Mrs. Treadwell. Were you coming to see me?\" he asked\neagerly, pleased, she could see, by the idea that she was seeking his\nservices.\n\n\"No, I was passing, and the garden reminded me so of my girlhood that I\ncame in for a minute.\"\n\n\"It hasn't changed much, I suppose?\" His alert, business-like gaze swept\nthe hillside.\n\n\"Hardly at all. One might imagine that those were the same roses I left\nhere.\"\n\n\"An improvement or two wouldn't hurt it,\" he remarked with animation.\n\"These old trees make such a litter in the spring that my wife is\nanxious to get them down. Women like tidiness, you know, and she says,\nwhile they are blooming, it is impossible to keep the yard clean.\"\n\n\"I remember. Their flowers cover everything when they fall, but I always\nloved them.\"\n\n\"Well, one does get attached to things. I hope you have had a pleasant\nsummer in spite of the heat. It must have been a delight to have your\ndaughter at home again. What a splendid worker she is. If we had her in\nDinwiddie for good it wouldn't be long before the old town would awaken.\nWhy, I'd been trying to get those girls' clubs started for a year, and\nshe took the job out of my hands and managed it in two weeks.\"\n\n\"The dear child is very clever. Is your wife still in the mountains?\"\n\n\"She's coming back next week. We didn't feel that it was safe to bring\nthe baby home until that long spell of heat had broken.\" Then, as she\nturned towards the step, he added hastily, \"Won't you let me walk home\nwith you?\"\n\nBut this, she felt, was more than she could bear, and making the excuse\nof an errand on the next block, she parted from him at the gate, and\nhurried like a shadow back along High Street.\n\nUntil October there was no word from Oliver, and then at last there came\na letter, which she threw, half read, into the fire. The impulsive act,\nso unlike the normal Virginia, soothed her for an instant, and she said\nover and over to herself, while she moved hurriedly about the room, as\nthough she were seeking an escape from the moment before her, \"I'm glad\nI didn't finish it. I'm glad I let it burn.\" Though she did not realize\nit, this passionate refusal to look at or to touch the thing that she\nhated was the last stand of the Pendleton idealism against the triumph\nof the actuality. It is possible that until that moment she had felt far\ndown in her soul that by declining to acknowledge in words the fact of\nOliver's desertion, by hiding it from the children, by ignoring the\nprocesses which would lead to his freedom, she had, in some obscure way,\ndeprived that fact of all power over her life. But now while his letter,\nblaming himself and yet pleading with her for his liberty, lay there,\ncrumbling slowly to ashes, under her eyes, her whole life, with its\npathos, its subterfuge, its losing battle against the ruling spirit of\nchange, seemed crumbling there also, like those ashes, or like that\nvanished past to which she belonged. \"I'm glad I let it burn,\" she\nrepeated bitterly, and yet she knew that the words had never really\nburned, that the flame which was consuming them would never die until\nshe lay in her coffin. Stopping in front of the fire, she stood looking\ndown on the last shred of the letter, as though it were in reality the\nruins of her life which she was watching. A dull wonder stirred in her\nmind amid her suffering--a vague questioning as to why this thing, of\nall things, should have happened? \"If I could only know why it was--if I\ncould only understand, it might be easier,\" she thought. \"But I tried so\nhard to do what was right, and, whatever the fault was, at least I never\nfailed in love. I never failed in love,\" she repeated. Her gaze, leaving\nthe fire, rested for an instant on a little alabaster ash-tray which\nstood on the end of the table, and a spasm crossed her face, which had\nremained unmoved while she was reading his letter. Every object in the\nroom seemed suddenly alive with memories. That was his place on the\nrug; the deep chintz-covered chair by the hearth was the one in which he\nused to sit, watching the fire at night, before going to bed; the clock\non the mantel was the one he had selected; the rug, which was threadbare\nin places, he had helped her to choose; the pile of English reviews on\nthe table he had subscribed to; the little glass water bottle on the\ncandle-stand by the bed, she had bought years ago because he liked to\ndrink in the night. There was nothing in which he did not have a part.\nEvery trivial incident of her life was bound up with the thought of him.\nShe could no more escape the torment of these associations than she\ncould escape the fact of herself. For so long she had been one with him\nin her thoughts that their relationship had passed, for her, into that\nprofound union of habit which is the strongest union of all. Even the\nyears in which he had grown gradually away from her had appeared to her\nto leave untouched the deeper sanctities of their marriage.\n\nA knock came at the door, and the cook, with a list of groceries in her\nhand, entered to inquire if her mistress were going to market. With the\nbeginning of the autumn Virginia had tried to take an interest in her\nhousekeeping again, and the daily trip to the market had relieved, in a\nmeasure, the terrible vacancy of her mornings. Now it seemed to her that\nthe remorseless exactions of the material details of living offered the\nonly escape from the tortures of memory. \"Yes, I'll go,\" she said,\nreaching out her hand for the list, and her heart cried, \"I cannot live\nif I stay in this room any longer. I cannot live if I look at these\nthings.\" As she turned away to put on her hat, she was seized by a\nsuperstitious feeling that she might escape her suffering by fleeing\nfrom these inanimate reminders of her marriage. It was as though the\nchair and the rug and the clock had become possessed with some\ndemoniacal spirit. \"If I can only get out of doors I shall feel better,\"\nshe insisted; and when she had hurriedly pinned on her hat and tied her\ntulle ruff at her throat, she caught up her gloves and ran quickly down\nthe stairs and out into the street. But as soon as she had reached the\nsidewalk, the agony, which she had thought she was leaving behind her in\nthe closed room upstairs, rushed over her in a wave of realization, and\nturning again, she started back into the yard, and stopped, with a\nsensation of panic, beside the bed of crimson dahlias at the foot of the\nsteps. Then, while she hesitated, uncertain whether to return to her\nbedroom or to force herself to go on to the market, those hated familiar\nobjects flashed in a blaze of light through her mind, and, opening the\ngate, she passed out on the sidewalk, and started at a rapid step down\nthe deserted pavement of Sycamore Street. \"At least nobody will speak to\nme,\" she thought; but while the words were still on her lips, she saw a\ndoor in the block open wide, and one of her neighbours come out on his\nway to his business. Turning hastily, she fled into a cross street, and\nthen gathering courage, went on, trembling in every limb, towards the\nold market, which she used because her mother and her grandmother had\nused it before her.\n\nThe fish-carts were still there just as they had been when she was a\ngirl, but the army of black-robed housekeepers had changed or melted\naway. Here, also, the physical details of life had survived the beings\nfor whose use or comfort they had come into existence. The meat and the\nvegetable stalls were standing in orderly rows about the octagonal\nbuilding; wilted cabbage leaves littered the dusty floor; flies swarmed\naround the bleeding forms hanging from hooks in the sunshine; even Mr.\nDewlap, hale and red-cheeked, offered her white pullets out of the\nwooden coop at his feet. So little had the physical scene changed since\nthe morning, more than twenty-five years ago, of her meeting with\nOliver, that while she paused there beside Mr. Dewlap's stall, one of\nthe older generation might have mistaken her for her mother.\n\n\"My dear Virginia,\" said a voice at her back, and, turning, she found\nMrs. Peachey, a trifle rheumatic, but still plump and pretty. \"I'm so\nglad you come to the old market, my child. I suppose you cling to it\nbecause of your mother, and then things are really so much dearer\nuptown, don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say they are, but I've got into the habit of coming here.\"\n\n\"One does get into habits. Now I've bought chickens from Mr. Dewlap for\nforty years. I remember your mother and I used to say that there were no\nchickens to compare with his white pullets.\"\n\n\"I remember. Mother was a wonderful housekeeper.\"\n\n\"And you are too, my dear. Everybody says that you have the best table\nin Dinwiddie!\" Her small rosy face, framed in the shirred brim of her\nblack silk bonnet, was wrinkled with age, but even her wrinkles were\ncheerful ones, and detracted nothing from the charming archness of her\nexpression. Unconquerable still, she went her sprightly way, on\nrheumatic limbs, towards the grave.\n\n\"Have you seen dear Miss Priscilla?\" asked Virginia, striving to turn\nthe conversation away from herself, and shivering with terror lest the\nother should ask after Oliver, whom she had always adored.\n\n\"I stopped to inquire about her on my way down. She had had a bad night,\nthe maid said, and Doctor Fraser is afraid that the cold she got when\nshe went driving the other day has settled upon her lungs.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry!\" exclaimed Virginia, but she was conscious of an\nimmeasurable relief because Miss Priscilla's illness was absorbing Mrs.\nPeachey's thoughts.\n\n\"Well, I must be going on,\" said the little lady, and though she\nflinched with pain when she moved, the habitual cheerfulness of her face\ndid not alter. \"Come to see me as often as you can, Jinny. I can't get\nabout much now, and it is such a pleasure for me to have somebody to\nchat with. People don't visit now,\" she added regretfully, \"as much as\nthey used to.\"\n\n\"So many things have changed,\" said Virginia, and her eyes, as she gazed\nup at the blue sky over the market, had a yearning look in them. So many\nthings had changed--ah, there was the pang!\n\nOn her way home, overcome by the fear that Miss Priscilla might die\nthinking herself neglected, Virginia stopped at the Academy, and was\nshown into the chamber behind the parlour, which had once been a\nclassroom. In the middle of her big tester bed, the teacher was lying,\npropped among pillows, with her cameo brooch fastening the collar of her\nnightgown and a purple wool shawl, which Virginia had knit for her,\nthrown over her shoulders.\n\n\"Dear Miss Priscilla, I've thought of you so often. Are you better\nto-day?\"\n\n\"A little, Jinny, but don't worry about me. I'll be out of bed in a day\nor two.\" Though she was well over eighty-five, she still thought of\nherself as a middle-aged woman, and her constant plans for the future\namazed Virginia, whose hold upon life was so much slighter, so much less\ntenacious. \"Have you been to market, dear? I miss so being able to sit\nby the window and watch people go by. Then I always knew when you and\nSusan were on your way to Mr. Dewlap.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've begun to go again. It fills in the day.\"\n\n\"I never approved of your letting your servants market for you, Jinny.\nIt would have shocked your mother dreadfully.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Virginia, and her voice, in spite of her effort to speak\ncheerfully, had a weary sound, which made her add with sudden energy,\n\"I've brought you a partridge. Mr. Dewlap had such nice ones. You must\ntry to eat it for supper.\"\n\n\"How like you that was, Jinny. You are your mother all over again. I\ndeclare I am reminded of her more and more every time that I see you.\"\n\nTears sprang to Virginia's eyes, while her thin blue-veined hands gently\ncaressed Miss Priscilla's swollen and knotted fingers.\n\n\"You couldn't tell me anything that would please me more,\" she answered.\n\n\"I used to think that Lucy would take after her, but she grew up\ndifferently.\"\n\n\"Yes, neither of the girls is like her. They are dear, good children,\nbut they are very modern.\"\n\n\"Have you heard from them recently?\"\n\n\"A few days ago, and they are both as well as can be.\"\n\n\"And what about Harry? I've always believed that Harry was your\nfavourite, Jinny.\"\n\nFor an instant Virginia hesitated, with her eyes on the pot of red\ngeraniums blooming between the white muslin curtains at the window. In\nhis little cage in the sunlight, Miss Priscilla's canary, the last of\nmany generations of Dickys, burst suddenly into song.\n\n\"I believe that Harry loves me more than anybody else in the world\ndoes,\" she answered at last. \"He'd come to me to-morrow if he thought I\nneeded him.\"\n\nLying there in her great white bed, with her enormous body, which she\ncould no longer turn, rising in a mountain of flesh under the linen\nsheet, the old teacher closed her eyes lest Virginia should see her soul\nyearning over her as it had yearned over Lucy Pendleton after the\nrector's death. She thought of the girl, with the flower-like eyes and\nthe braided wreath of hair, flitting in white organdie and blue ribbons,\nunder the dappled sunlight in High Street, and she said to herself, as\nshe had said twenty-five years ago, \"If there was ever a girl who looked\nas if she were cut out for happiness, it was Jinny Pendleton.\"\n\n\"They say that Abby Goode is going to be married at last,\" remarked\nVirginia abruptly, for she knew that such bits of gossip supplied the\nonly pleasant excitement in Miss Priscilla's life.\n\n\"Well, it's time. She waited long enough,\" returned the teacher, and she\nadded, \"I always knew that she was crazy about Oliver by the way she\nflung herself at his head.\" She had never liked Abby, and her\nprejudices, which had survived the shocks of life, were not weakened by\nthe approaching presence of Death. It was characteristic of her that she\nshould pass into eternity with both her love and her scorn undiminished.\n\n\"She was a little boisterous as a girl, but I never believed any harm of\nher,\" answered Virginia mildly; and then as Miss Priscilla's lunch was\nbrought in on a tray, she kissed her tenderly, with a curious feeling\nthat it was for the last time, and went out of the door and down the\ngravelled walk into High Street. An exhaustion greater than any she had\never known oppressed her as she dragged her body, which felt dead,\nthrough the glorious October weather. Once, when she passed Saint James'\nChurch, she thought wearily, \"How sorry mother would be if she knew,\"\nwhile an intolerable pain, which seemed her mother's pain as well as her\nown, pierced her heart. Then, as she hurried on, with that nervous haste\nwhich she could no longer control, the terrible haunted blocks appeared\nto throng with the faded ghosts of her youth. A grey-haired woman\nleaning out of the upper window of an old house nodded to her with a\nsmile, and she found herself thinking, \"I rolled hoops with her once in\nthe street, and now she is watching her grandchild go out in its\ncarriage.\" At any other moment she would have bent, enraptured, over the\nperambulator, which was being wheeled, by a nurse and a maid, down the\nfront steps into the street; but to-day the sight of the soft baby\nfeatures, lovingly surrounded by lace and blue ribbons, was like the\nturn of a knife in her wound. \"And yet mother always said that she was\nnever so happy as she was with my children,\" she reflected, while her\npersonal suffering was eased for a minute by the knowledge of what her\nreturn to Dinwiddie had meant to her mother. \"If she had died while I\nlived away, I could never have got over it--I could never have forgiven\nmyself,\" she added, and there was an exquisite relief in turning even\nfor an instant away from the thought of herself.\n\nWhen she reached home luncheon was awaiting her; but after sitting down\nat the table and unfolding her napkin, a sudden nausea seized her, and\nshe felt that it was impossible to sit there facing the mahogany\nsideboard, with its gleaming rows of silver, and watch the precise,\nslow-footed movements of the maid, who served her as she might have\nserved a wooden image. \"I took such trouble to train her, and now it\nmakes me sick to look at her,\" she thought, as she pushed back her chair\nand fled hastily from the room into Oliver's study across the hall. Here\nher work-bag lay on the table, and taking it up, she sat down before the\nfire, and spread out the centrepiece, which she was embroidering, in an\nintricate and elaborate design, for Lucy's Christmas. It was almost a\nyear now since she had started it, and into the luxuriant sprays and\ngarlands there had passed something of the restless love and yearning\nwhich had overflowed from her heart. Usually she was able to work on it\nin spite of her suffering, for she was one of those whose hands could\naccomplish mechanically tasks from which her soul had revolted; but\nto-day even her obedient fingers faltered and refused to keep at their\nlabour. Her eyes, leaving the needle she held, wandered beyond the\nwindow to the branches of the young maple tree, which rose, like a\npointed flame, toward the cloudless blue of the sky.\n\nIn the evening, when Susan came in, with a newspaper in her hand, and a\npassionate sympathy in her face, Virginia was still sitting there,\ngazing at the dim outline of the tree and the strip of sky which had\nfaded from azure to grey.\n\n\"Oh, Jinny, my darling, you never told me!\"\n\nTaking up the piece of embroidery from her lap, Virginia met her\nfriend's tearful caress with a frigid and distant manner. \"There was\nnothing to tell. What do you mean?\" she asked.\n\n\"Is--is it true that Oliver has left you? That--that----\" Susan's voice\nbroke, strangled by emotion, but Virginia, without looking up from the\nrose on which she was working in the firelight, answered quietly:\n\n\"Yes, it is true. He wants to be free.\"\n\n\"But you will not do it, darling? The law is on your side.\"\n\nWith her eyes on the needle which she held carefully poised for the next\nstitch, Virginia hesitated while the muscles of her face quivered for an\ninstant and then grew rigid again.\n\n\"What good would it do,\" she asked, \"to hold him to me when he wishes to\nbe free?\" And then, with one of those flashes of insight which came to\nher in moments of great emotional stress, she added quietly, \"It is not\nthe law, it is life.\"\n\nPutting her arms around her, Susan pressed her to her bosom as she might\nhave pressed a suffering child whom she was powerless to help or even to\nmake understand.\n\n\"Jinny, Jinny, let me love you,\" she begged.\n\n\"How did you know?\" asked Virginia, as coldly as though she had not\nheard her. \"Has it got into the papers?\"\n\nFor an instant Susan's pity struggled against her loyalty. \"General\nGoode told me that there had been a good deal about Oliver and--and Miss\nOldcastle in the New York papers for several days,\" she answered, \"and\nthis morning a few lines were copied in the Dinwiddie _Bee_. Oliver is\nso famous it was impossible to keep things hushed up, I suppose. But you\nknew all this, Jinny darling.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I knew that,\" answered Virginia; then, rising suddenly from\nher chair, she said almost irritably: \"Susan, I want to be alone. I\ncan't think until I am alone.\" By her look Susan knew that until that\nminute some blind hope had kept alive in her, some childish pretence\nthat it might all be a dream, some passionate evasion of the ultimate\noutcome.\n\n\"But you'll let me come back? You'll let me spend the night with you,\nJinny?\"\n\n\"If you want to, you may come. But I don't need you. I don't need\nanybody. I don't need anybody,\" she repeated bitterly; and this\nbitterness appeared to change not only her expression, but her features\nand her carriage and that essential attribute of her being which had\nbeen the real Virginia.\n\nAwed in spite of herself, Susan put on her hat again, and bent over to\nkiss her. \"I'll be back before bed-time, Jinny. Don't shut me away,\ndear. Let me share your pain with you.\"\n\nAt this something that was like a smile trembled for an instant on\nVirginia's face.\n\n\"You are good, Susan,\" she responded, but there was no tenderness, no\ngratitude even, in her voice. She had grown hard with the implacable\nhardness of grief.\n\nWhen the door had closed behind her friend, she stood looking through\nthe window until she saw her pass slowly, as though she were reluctant\nto go, down Sycamore Street in the direction of her home. \"I am glad she\nhas gone,\" she thought coldly. \"Susan is good, but I am glad she has\ngone.\" Then, turning back to the fire, she took up the piece of\nembroidery and mechanically folded it before she laid it away. While her\nhands were still on the bag in which she kept it, a shiver went through\nher body, and a look of resolution passed over her features, making them\nappear as if they were sculptured in marble.\n\n\"He will be sorry some day,\" she thought. \"He will be sorry when it is\ntoo late, and if I were there now--if I were to see him, it might all be\nprevented. It might all be prevented and we might be happy again.\" In\nher distorted mind, which worked with the quickness and the intensity of\ndelirium, this idea assumed presently the prominence and the force of an\nhallucination. So powerful did it become that it triumphed over all the\nqualities which had once constituted her character--over the patience,\nthe sweetness, the unselfish goodness--as easily as it obscured the\nrashness and folly of the step which she planned. \"If I could see him,\nit might all be prevented,\" she repeated obstinately, as though some one\nhad opposed her; and, going upstairs to her bedroom, she packed her\nlittle handbag and put on the travelling dress which she had worn in New\nYork. Then, very softly, as though she feared to be stopped by the\nservants, she went down the stairs and out of the front door; and, very\nsoftly, carrying her bag, she passed into the street and walked\nhurriedly in the direction of the station. And all the way she was\nthinking, \"If I can only see him again, this may not happen and\neverything may be as it was before when he still loved me.\" So just and\nrational did this idea appear to her, that she found herself wondering\npassionately why she had not thought of it before. It was so easy a way\nout of her wretchedness that it seemed absurd of her to have overlooked\nit. And this discovery filled her with such tremulous excitement, that\nwhen she opened her purse to buy her ticket, her hands shook as if they\nwere palsied, and the porter, who held her bag, was obliged to count out\nthe money. The whole of life, which had looked so dark an hour ago, had\nbecome suddenly illuminated.\n\nOnce in the train, her nervousness left her, and when an acquaintance\njoined her after they had started, she was able to talk connectedly of\ntrivial occurrences in Dinwiddie. He was a fat, apoplectic looking man,\nwith a bald head which shone like satin, and a drooping moustache\nslightly discoloured by tobacco. His appearance, which she had never\nobjected to before, seemed to her grotesque; but in spite of this, she\ncould smile almost naturally at his jokes, which she thought\ninconceivably stupid.\n\n\"I suppose you heard about Cyrus Treadwell's accident,\" he said at last\nwhen she rose to go to her berth. \"Got knocked down by an automobile as\nhe was getting off a street car at the bank. It isn't serious, they say,\nbut he was pretty well stunned for a while.\"\n\n\"No, I hadn't heard,\" she answered, and thought, \"I wonder why Susan\ndidn't tell me.\" Then she said good-night and disappeared behind the\ncurtains of her berth, where she lay, without undressing, until morning.\n\n\"This is the way--there is no other way to stop it,\" she thought, and\nall night the rumble of the train and the flashing of the lights in the\ndarkness outside of her window kept up a running accompaniment to the\nwords. \"It is a sin--and there is no other way to stop it. He is\ncommitting a sin, and when I see him he will understand it, and it will\nbe as it was before.\" This idea, which was as fixed as an obsession of\ndelirium, seemed to occupy some central space in her brain, leaving room\nfor a crowd of lesser thoughts which came and went fantastically around\nit like the motley throng of a circus. She thought of Cyrus Treadwell's\naccident, of the stupid jokes the man from Dinwiddie had told her, of\nthe noises of the train, which would not let one sleep, of the stations\nwhich blazed out, here and there, in the darkness. But in the midst of\nthis confusion of images and impressions, a clear voice was repeating\nsomewhere in her brain: \"This is the way--there is no other way to stop\nit before it is too late.\"\n\nIn the morning, when she got out in New York, and gave the driver the\nname of the little hotel at which she had stopped on her first visit,\nthis glowing certainty faded like the excitement of fever from her mind,\nand she relapsed into the stricken hopelessness of the last six months.\nThe bleakness of her spirits fell like a cloud on the brilliant October\nday, and the sunshine, which lay in golden pools on the pavements,\nappeared to increase the sense of universal melancholy which had\nfollowed so sharply on the brief exaltation of the night. \"I must see\nhim--it is the only way,\" her brain still repeated, but the ring of\nconviction was gone from the words. Her flight from Dinwiddie showed to\nher now in all the desperate folly with which it might have appeared to\na stranger. The impulse which had brought her had ebbed away, and with\nthe impulse had passed also the confidence and the energy of her\nresolve.\n\nAt the hotel, where the red bedroom into which they ushered her appeared\nto have waited unaltered for the second tragedy of her life, she bathed\nand dressed herself, and after a cup of black coffee, taken because a\nsensation of dizziness had alarmed her lest she should faint in the\nstreet, she put on her hat again and went out into Fifth Avenue. She\nremembered the name of the hotel at the head of Oliver's letter, and she\ndirected her steps towards it now with an automatic precision of which\nher mind seemed almost unconscious. All thought of asking for him had\nvanished, yet she was drawn to the place where he was by a force which\nwas more irresistible than any choice of the will. An instinct stronger\nthan reason was guiding her steps.\n\nIn Fifth Avenue the crowd was already beginning to stream by on the\nsidewalks, and as she mingled with it, she recalled that other morning\nwhen she had moved among these people and had felt that they looked at\nher kindly because she was beautiful and young. Now the kindness had\ngiven way to indifference in their eyes. They no longer looked at her;\nand when a shop window, which she was passing, showed her a reflection\nof herself, she saw only a commonplace middle-aged figure, with a look\nof withered sweetness in the face, which had grown suddenly wan. And\nthe sight of this figure fell like a weight on her heart, destroying the\nlast vestige of courage.\n\nBefore the door of the hotel in which Oliver was staying, she stood so\nlong, with her vacant gaze fixed on the green velvet carpet within the\nhall, that an attendant in livery came up at last and inquired if she\nwished to see any one. Arousing herself with a start, she shook her head\nhurriedly and turned back into the street, for when the crucial moment\ncame her decision failed her. Just as she had been unable to make a\nscene on the night when they had parted, so now it was impossible for\nher to descend to the vulgarity of thrusting her presence into his life.\nUnless the frenzy of delirium seized her again, she knew that she should\nnever have the strength to put the desperation of thought into the\ndesperation of action. What she longed for was not to fight, not to\nstruggle, but to fall, like a wounded bird, to the earth, and be\nforgotten.\n\nAt the crossing, where there was a crush of motor cars and carriages,\nshe stopped for a moment and thought how easy it would be to die in the\ncrowded street before returning to Dinwiddie. \"All I need do is to slip\nand fall there, and in a second it would be over.\" But so many cars went\nby that she knew she should never be able to do it, that much as she\nhated life, something bound her to it which she lacked the courage to\nbreak. There shot through her mind the memory of a soldier her father\nused to tell about, who was always first on the field of battle, but had\nnever found the courage to charge. \"He was like me--for I might stand\nhere forever and yet not find the courage to die.\"\n\nA beggar came up to her and she thought, \"He is begging of me, and yet I\nam more miserable than he is.\" Then, while she searched in her bag for\nsome change, it seemed to her that the faces gliding past her became\nsuddenly distorted and twisted as though the souls of the women in the\nrapidly moving cars were crucified under their splendid furs. \"That\nwoman in the sable cloak is beautiful, and yet she, also, is in\ntorture,\" she reflected with an impersonal coldness and detachment. \"I\nwas beautiful, too, but how did it help me?\" And she saw herself as she\nhad been in her girlhood with the glow of happiness, as of one flying,\nin her face, and her heart filled with the joyous expectancy of the\nmiracle which must happen. \"I am as old now as Miss Willy was then--and\nhow I pitied her!\" Tears rushed to her eyes, which had been so dry a\nminute before, while the memory of that lost gaiety of youth came over\nher in a wave that was like the sweetness of the honeysuckle blooming in\nthe rectory garden.\n\nA policeman, observing that she had waited there so long, held up the\ntraffic until she had crossed the street, and after thanking him, she\nwent on again towards the hotel in which she was staying. \"He was kind\nabout helping me over,\" she said to herself, with an impulse of\ngratitude; and this casual kindness seemed to her the one spot of light\nin the blackness which surrounded her.\n\nAs she approached the hotel, her step flagged, and she felt suddenly\nthat even that passive courage which was hers--the courage of\nendurance--had deserted her. She saw the dreadful hours that must ensue\nbefore she went back to Dinwiddie, the dreadful days that would follow\nafter she got there, the dreadful weeks that would run on into the\ndreadful years. Silent, grey, and endless, they stretched ahead of her,\nand through them all she saw herself, a little hopeless figure, moving\ntowards that death which she had not had the courage to die. The\nthoughts of the familiar streets, of the familiar faces, of the house,\nof the furniture, of the leaf-strewn yard in which her bed of dahlias\nwas blooming--all these aroused in her the sense of spiritual nausea\nwhich she had felt when she went back to them after her parting from\nOliver. Nothing remained except the long empty years, for she had\noutlived her usefulness.\n\nAt the door of the hotel, the hall porter met her with a cheerful face,\nand she turned to him with the instinctive reliance on masculine\nprotection which had driven her to the friendly shelter of the policeman\nat the crossing in Fifth Avenue. In reply to her helpless questions, he\nlooked up the next train to Dinwiddie, which left within the hour, and\nafter buying her ticket, assisted her smilingly into the taxicab. While\nshe sat there, in the middle of the seat, with her little black bag\nrocking back and forth as the cab turned the corners, all capacity for\nfeeling, all possibility of sensation even, seemed to have passed out of\nher body. The impulse which was carrying her to Dinwiddie was the\nphysical impulse which drives a wounded animal back to die in its\nshelter. Even the flaring advertisements of Oliver's play, which was\nstill running in a Broadway theatre, aroused no pain, hardly any thought\nof him or of the past, in her mind. She had ceased to suffer, she had\nceased even to think; and when, a little later, she followed the station\nporter down the long platform, she was able to brush aside the memory of\nher parting from Oliver as lightly as though it were the trivial sting\nof a wasp. When she remembered the agony of the last year, of yesterday,\nof the morning through which she had just lived, it appeared almost\nridiculous. That death which she had lacked the courage to die seemed\ncreeping over her soul before it reached the outer shell of her body.\n\nIn the train, she was attacked by a sensation of faintness, and\nremembering that she had eaten nothing all day, she went into the\ndining-car, and sat down at one of the little tables. When her luncheon\nwas brought, she ate almost ravenously for a minute. Then her sudden\nhunger was followed by a disgust for the look of the dishes and the\ncinders on the table-cloth, and after paying her bill, for which she\nwaited an intolerable time, she went back to her chair in the next\ncoach, and watched, with unseeing eyes, the swiftly moving landscape,\nwhich rushed by in all the brilliant pageantry of October. Several seats\nahead of her, two men were discussing politics, and one of them, who\nwore a clerical waistcoat, raised his voice suddenly so high that his\nwords penetrated the wall of blankness which surrounded her thoughts, \"I\ntell you it is the greatest menace to our civilization!\" and then, as he\ncontrolled his excitement, his speech dropped quickly into\nindistinctness.\n\n\"How absurd of him to get so angry about it,\" thought Virginia with\nsurprise, \"as if a civilization could make any difference to anybody on\nearth.\" And she watched the clergyman for a minute, as if fascinated by\nthe display of his earnestness. \"What on earth can it matter to him?\"\nshe wondered mildly, \"and yet to look at him one would think that his\nheart was bound up in the question.\" But in a little while she turned\naway from him again, and lying back in her chair, stared across the\nsmooth plains to the pale golden edge of the distant horizon. Through\nthe long day she sat, without moving, without taking her eyes from the\nlandscape, while the sunlight faded slowly away from the fields and the\nafterglow flushed and waned, and the stars shone out, one by one,\nthrough the silver web of the twilight. Once, when the porter had\noffered her a pillow, she had looked round to thank him; once when a\nchild, toddling along the aisle, had fallen at her feet, she had bent\nover to lift it, but beyond this, she had stirred only to hand her\nticket to the conductor when he aroused her by touching her arm. Where\nthe sunset and the afterglow had been, she saw at last only the lights\nof the train reflected in the smeared glass of the window, but so\nunconscious was she of any change in that utter vacancy at which she\nlooked, that she could not have told whether it was an hour or a day\nafter leaving New York that she came back to Dinwiddie. Even then she\nwould still have sat there, speechless, inert, unseeing, had not the\nporter taken her bag from the rack over her head and accompanied her\nfrom the glare of the train out into the dimness of the town, where the\ncrumbling \"hacks\" hitched to the decrepit horses still waited. Here her\nbag was passed over to a driver, whom she vaguely remembered, and a few\nminutes later she rolled, in one of the ancient vehicles, under the\npale lights of the street which led to her home. In the drug store at\nthe corner she saw Miss Priscilla's maid buying medicines, and she\nwondered indifferently if the teacher had grown suddenly worse. Then, as\nshe passed John Henry's house, she recognized his large shadow as it\nmoved across the white shade at the window of the drawing-room. \"Susan\nwas coming to spend last night with me,\" she said aloud, and for the\nfirst and last time in her life, an ironic smile quivered upon her lips.\n\nWith a last jolt the carriage drew up at the sidewalk before her home;\nthe driver dismounted, grinning, from his box; and in the lighted\ndoorway, she saw the figure of her maid, in trim cap and apron, waiting\nto welcome her. Not a petal had fallen from the bed of crimson dahlias\nbeside the steps; not a leaf had changed on the young maple tree, which\nrose in a spire of flame toward the stars. Inside, she knew, there would\nbe the bright fire, the cheerful supper table, the soft bed turned\ndown--and the future.\n\nOn the porch she stopped and looked back into the street as she might\nhave looked back at the door of a prison. The negro driver, having\nplaced her bag in the hall, stood waiting expectantly, with his hat in\nhis hand, and his shining black eyes on her face; and opening her purse,\nshe paid him, before walking past the maid over the threshold. Ahead of\nher stretched the staircase which she would go up and down for the rest\nof her life. On the right, she could look into the open door of the\ndining-room, and opposite to it, she knew that the lamp was lit and the\nfire burning in Oliver's study. Then, while a wave of despair, like a\nmortal sickness, swept over her, her eyes fell on an envelope which lay\non the little silver card-tray on the hall table, and as she tore it\nopen, she saw that it contained but a single line:\n\n     \"Dearest mother, I am coming home to you,\n     \"HARRY.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nBY THE SAME AUTHOR\n\nTHE MILLER OF OLD CHURCH\n\nTHE ROMANCE OF A PLAIN MAN\n\nTHE ANCIENT LAW\n\nTHE WHEEL OF LIFE\n\nTHE DELIVERANCE\n\nTHE BATTLEGROUND\n\nTHE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE\n\nPHASES OF AN INFERIOR PLANET\n\nTHE DESCENDANT\n\nTHE FREEMAN, AND OTHER POEMS\n\n\nTHE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS GARDEN CITY, N.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":887,"split":"train"}
