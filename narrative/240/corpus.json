They have little chance of doing well on their handmade wooden skates, but the prospect of the race and the prize of the silver skates excites them and fires their dreams.\nHans' father, Raff Brinker, is sick and amnesiac, with violent episodes, because of a head injury caused by a fall from a dike, and he cannot work. Mrs. Brinker, Hans, and Gretel must all work to support the family and are looked down upon in the community because of their low income and poor status. Hans has a chance meeting with the famous surgeon Dr. Boekman and begs him to treat their father, but the doctor is expensive and gruff in nature following the loss of his wife and disappearance of his son. Eventually, Dr. Boekman is persuaded to examine the Brinkers' father. He diagnoses pressure on the brain, which can be cured by a risky and expensive operation involving trephining.\nHans offers his own money, saved in the hope of buying steel skates, to the doctor to pay for his father's operation. Touched by this gesture, Dr. Boekman provides the surgery for free, and Hans is able to buy good skates for both himself and Gretel to skate in the race. Gretel wins the girls' race, but Hans lets a friend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who needs it more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 win the precious prize, the Silver Skates, in the boys' race.\nMr. Brinker's operation is successful, and he is restored to health and memory. Dr. Boekman is also changed, losing his gruff ways, thanks in part to being able to be reunited with his lost son through the unlikely aid of Mr. Brinker. The Brinkers' fortunes are changed further by the almost miraculous recovery of Mr. Brinker's savings, thought lost or stolen ten years ago.\nThe Brinker parents live a long and happy life. Dr. Boekman helps Hans go to medical school, and Hans becomes a successful doctor. Gretel also grows up to enjoy a happy adult life.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Hans Brinker, by Mary Mapes Dodge\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Throughout its pages the\ndescriptions of Dutch localities, customs, and general characteristics,\nhave been given with scrupulous care. Many of its incidents are drawn\nfrom life, and the story of Raff Brinker is founded strictly upon fact.\n\nWhile acknowledging my obligations to many well-known writers on Dutch\nhistory, literature, and art, I turn with especial gratitude to those\nkind Holland friends, who, with generous zeal, have taken many a\nbackward glance at their country for my sake, seeing it as it looked\ntwenty years ago, when the Brinker home stood unnoticed in sunlight and\nshadow.\n\nShould this simple narrative serve to give my young readers a just idea\nof Holland and its resources, or present true pictures of its\ninhabitants and their every-day life, or free them from certain current\nprejudices concerning that noble and enterprising people, the leading\ndesire in writing it will have been satisfied.\n\nShould it cause even one heart to feel a deeper trust in God's goodness\nand love, or aid any in weaving a life, wherein, through knots and\nentanglements, the golden thread shall never be tarnished or broken, the\nprayer with which it was begun and ended will have been answered.\n\nM. M. D.\n\n\n\n\nA LETTER FROM HOLLAND\n\n\nAMSTERDAM, July 30, 1873.\n\n_Dear Boys and Girls at Home:_\n\nAs Messrs. Scribner, Armstrong and Company, of New York, are printing\nfor you the story of \"The Silver Skates,\" perhaps you would like to have\na letter from this land of the Brinkers.\n\nIf you all could be here with me to-day, what fine times we might have\nwalking through this beautiful Dutch city! How we should stare at the\ncrooked houses, standing with their gable ends to the street; at the\nlittle slanting mirrors fastened outside of the windows; at the wooden\nshoes and dog-carts near by; the windmills in the distance; at the great\nwarehouses; at the canals, doing the double duty of streets and rivers,\nand at the singular mingling of trees and masts to be seen in every\ndirection. Ah, it would be pleasant, indeed! But here I sit in a great\nhotel looking out upon all these things, knowing quite well that not\neven the spirit of the Dutch, which seems able to accomplish anything,\ncan bring you at this moment across the ocean. There is one comfort,\nhowever, in going through these wonderful Holland towns without you--it\nwould be dreadful to have any of the party tumble into the canals; and\nthen these lumbering Dutch wagons, with their heavy wheels, so very far\napart: what should I do if a few dozen of you were to fall under _them_?\nand, perhaps, one of the wildest of my boys might harm a stork, and then\nall Holland would be against us! No. It is better as it is. You will be\ncoming, one by one, as the years go on, to see the whole thing for\nyourselves.\n\nHolland is as wonderful to-day as it was when, more than twenty years\nago, Hans and Gretel skated on the frozen Y. In fact, more wonderful,\nfor every day increases the marvel of its not being washed away by the\nsea. Its cities have grown, and some of its peculiarities have been\nbrushed away by contact with other nations; but it is Holland still, and\nalways will be--full of oddity, courage and industry--the pluckiest\nlittle country on earth. I shall not tell you in this letter of its\ncustoms, its cities, its palaces, churches, picture-galleries, and\nmuseums--for these are described in the story--except to say that they\nare here still, just the same, in this good year 1873, for I have seen\nthem nearly all within a week.\n\nTo-day an American boy and I seeing some children enter an old house in\nthe business part of Amsterdam, followed them in--and what do you think\nwe found? An old woman, here in the middle of summer, selling hot water\nand fire! She makes her living by it. All day long she sits tending her\ngreat fires of peat and keeping the shining copper-tanks above them\nfilled with water. The children who come and go, carry away in a curious\nstone pail their kettle of boiling water and their blocks of burning\npeat. For these they give her a Dutch cent, which is worth less than\nhalf of one of ours. In this way persons who cannot afford to keep a\nfire burning in hot weather, may yet have their cup of tea or coffee and\ntheir bit of boiled fish and potato.\n\nAfter leaving the old fire-woman, who nodded a pleasant good-bye to us,\nand willingly put our stivers in her great outside pocket, we drove\nthrough the streets enjoying the singular sights of a public washing\nday. Yes, in certain quarters of the city, away from the canals, the\nstreets were lively with washerwomen hard at work. Hundreds of them in\nclumsy wooden shoes, with their tucked-up skirts, bare arms and\nclose-fitting caps, were bending over tall wooden tubs that reached as\nhigh as their waists--gossiping and rubbing, rubbing and gossiping--with\nperfect unconcern, in the public thoroughfare, and all washing with cold\nwater instead of using hot, as we do. What a grand thing it would be for\nour old fire-woman if boiling water were suddenly to become the fashion\non these public washing days!\n\nBut I forget. If this letter ever reaches you, it must do so by being\nput in the place where prefaces belong, a small place, you know, that\nholds very little, and where, to tell the truth, readers generally wish\nto find still less.\n\nSo, good-bye. O! I must tell you one more thing. We found to-day in an\nAmsterdam bookstore this story of Hans Brinker told in Dutch. It is a\nqueer looking volume, beautifully printed, and with colored pictures,\nbut filled with such astonishing words that it really made me feel sorry\nfor the little Hollanders who are to read them.\n\nGood-bye, again, in the touching words of our Dutch translator with whom\nI'm sure you'll heartily agree: Toch ben ik er mijn landgenooten dank\nbaar voor, die mijn arbeid steeds zoo welwillend outvangen en wier\ngenegenheid ik voortdurend hoop te verdienen.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nI.

Most of the\ngood Hollanders were enjoying a placid morning nap; even Mynheer von\nStoppelnoze, that worthy old Dutchman, was still slumbering \"in\nbeautiful repose.\"\n\nNow and then some peasant woman, poising a well filled basket upon her\nhead, came skimming over the glassy surface of the canal; or a lusty\nboy, skating to his day's work in the town, cast a good-natured grimace\ntoward the shivering pair as he flew along.\n\nMeanwhile, with many a vigorous puff and pull, the brother and sister,\nfor such they were, seemed to be fastening something upon their\nfeet--not skates, certainly, but clumsy pieces of wood narrowed and\nsmoothed at their lower edge, and pierced with holes, through which were\nthreaded strings of rawhide.\n\nThese queer looking affairs had been made by the boy Hans. His mother\nwas a poor peasant-woman, too poor to even think of such a thing as\nbuying skates for her little ones. Rough as these were, they had\nafforded the children many a happy hour upon the ice; and now as with\ncold, red fingers our young Hollanders tugged at the strings--their\nsolemn faces bending closely over their knees--no vision of impossible\niron runners came to dull the satisfaction glowing within.\n\nIn a moment the boy arose, and with a pompous swing of the arms, and a\ncareless \"come on, Gretel,\" glided easily across the canal.\n\n\"Ah, Hans,\" called his sister plaintively, \"this foot is not well yet.\nThe strings hurt me on last Market day; and now I cannot bear them tied\nin the same place.\"\n\n\"Tie them higher up, then,\" answered Hans, as without looking at her he\nperformed a wonderful cat's-cradle step on the ice.\n\n\"How can I? The string is too short.\"\n\nGiving vent to a good-natured Dutch whistle, the English of which was\nthat girls were troublesome creatures, he steered toward her.\n\n\"You are foolish to wear such shoes, Gretel, when you have a stout\nleather pair. Your klompen[1] would be better than these.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: Wooden Shoes.]\n\n\"Why, Hans! Do you forget? The father threw my beautiful new shoes in\nthe fire. Before I knew what he had done they were all curled up in the\nmidst of the burning peat. I can skate with these, but not with my\nwooden ones.--Be careful now----\"\n\nHans had taken a string from his pocket. Humming a tune as he knelt\nbeside her, he proceeded to fasten Gretel's skate with all the force of\nhis strong young arm.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" she cried, in real pain.\n\nWith an impatient jerk Hans unwound the string. He would have cast it\nupon the ground in true big-brother style, had he not just then spied a\ntear trickling down his sister's cheek.\n\n\"I'll fix it--never fear,\" he said, with sudden tenderness, \"but we must\nbe quick; the mother will need us soon.\"\n\nThen he glanced inquiringly about him, first at the ground, next at some\nbare willow branches above his head, and finally at the sky now gorgeous\nwith streaks of blue, crimson and gold.\n\nFinding nothing in any of these localities to meet his need, his eye\nsuddenly brightened as, with the air of a fellow who knew what he was\nabout, he took off his cap and removing the tattered lining, adjusted it\nin a smooth pad over the top of Gretel's worn-out shoe.\n\n\"Now,\" he cried triumphantly, at the same time arranging the strings as\nbriskly as his benumbed fingers would allow, \"can you bear some\npulling?\"\n\nGretel drew up her lips as if to say \"hurt away,\" but made no further\nresponse.\n\nIn another moment they were laughing together, as hand in hand they flew\nalong the canal, never thinking whether the ice would bear or not, for\nin Holland, ice is generally an all-Winter affair. It settles itself\nupon the water in a determined kind of way, and so far from growing thin\nand uncertain every time the sun is a little severe upon it, it gathers\nits forces day by day and flashes defiance to every beam.\n\nPresently, squeak! squeak! sounded something beneath Hans' feet. Next\nhis strokes grew shorter, ending ofttimes with a jerk, and finally, he\nlay sprawling upon the ice, kicking against the air with many a\nfantastic flourish.\n\n\"Ha! Ha!\" laughed Gretel, \"that was a fine tumble!\" But a tender heart\nwas beating under her coarse blue jacket and, even as she laughed, she\ncame, with a graceful sweep, close to her prostrate brother.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Hans? oh, you are laughing! catch me now\"--and she darted\naway shivering no longer, but with cheeks all aglow, and eyes sparkling\nwith fun.\n\nHans sprang to his feet and started in brisk pursuit, but it was no easy\nthing to catch Gretel. Before she had traveled very far, her skates,\ntoo, began to squeak.\n\nBelieving that discretion was the better part of valor she turned\nsuddenly and skated into her pursuer's arms.\n\n\"Ha! ha! I've caught you!\" cried Hans.\n\n\"Ha! ha! I caught _you_,\" she retorted, struggling to free herself.\n\nJust then a clear, quick voice was heard calling \"Hans! Gretel!\"\n\n\"It's the mother,\" said Hans, looking solemn in an instant.\n\nBy this time the canal was gilded with sunlight. The pure morning air\nwas very delightful, and skaters were gradually increasing in numbers.\nIt was hard to obey the summons. But Gretel and Hans were good children;\nwithout a thought of yielding to the temptation to linger, they pulled\noff their skates, leaving half the knots still tied. Hans, with his\ngreat square shoulders, and bushy yellow hair, towered high above his\nblue-eyed little sister as they trudged homeward. He was fifteen years\nold and Gretel was only twelve. He was a solid, hearty-looking boy, with\nhonest eyes and a brow that seemed to bear a sign \"goodness within\" just\nas the little Dutch zomerhuis[2] wears a motto over its portal. Gretel\nwas lithe and quick; her eyes had a dancing light in them, and while you\nlooked at her cheek the color paled and deepened just as it does upon a\nbed of pink and white blossoms when the wind is blowing.\n\n[Footnote 2: Summer-house.]\n\nAs soon as the children turned from the canal they could see their\nparents' cottage. Their mother's tall form, arrayed in jacket and\npetticoat and close-fitting cap, stood, like a picture, in the crooked\nframe of the doorway. Had the cottage been a mile away, it would still\nhave seemed near. In that flat country every object stands out plainly\nin the distance; the chickens show as distinctly as the windmills.\nIndeed, were it not for the dykes and the high banks of the canals, one\ncould stand almost anywhere in middle Holland without seeing a mound or\na ridge between the eye and the \"jumping-off place.\"\n\nNone had better cause to know the nature of these same dykes than Dame\nBrinker and the panting youngsters now running at her call. But before\nstating why, let me ask you to take a rocking-chair trip with me to that\nfar country where you may see, perhaps for the first time, some curious\nthings that Hans and Gretel saw every day.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nHOLLAND\n\n\nHolland is one of the queerest countries under the sun. It should be\ncalled Odd-land or Contrary-land, for in nearly everything it is\ndifferent from other parts of the world. In the first place, a large\nportion of the country is lower than the level of the sea. Great dykes\nor bulwarks have been erected at a heavy cost of money and labor, to\nkeep the ocean where it belongs. On certain parts of the coast it\nsometimes leans with all its weight against the land, and it is as much\nas the poor country can do to stand the pressure. Sometimes the dykes\ngive way, or spring a leak, and the most disastrous results ensue. They\nare high and wide, and the tops of some of them are covered with\nbuildings and trees. They have even fine public roads upon them, from\nwhich horses may look down upon wayside cottages. Often the keels of\nfloating ships are higher than the roofs of the dwellings. The stork\nclattering to her young on the house-peak may feel that her nest is\nlifted far out of danger, but the croaking frog in neighboring bulrushes\nis nearer the stars than she. Water-bugs dart backward and forward above\nthe heads of the chimney swallows; and willow trees seem drooping with\nshame, because they cannot reach as high as the reeds near by.\n\nDitches, canals, ponds, rivers and lakes are everywhere to be seen.\nHigh, but not dry, they shine in the sunlight, catching nearly all the\nbustle and the business, quite scorning the tame fields stretching\ndamply beside them. One is tempted to ask, \"Which is Holland--the shores\nor the water?\" The very verdure that should be confined to the land has\nmade a mistake and settled upon the fish-ponds. In fact the entire\ncountry is a kind of saturated sponge or, as the English poet, Butler,\ncalled it,\n\n     \"A land that rides at anchor, and is moor'd,\n     In which they do not live, but go aboard.\"\n\nPersons are born, live and die, and even have their gardens on\ncanal-boats. Farmhouses, with roofs like great slouched hats pulled over\ntheir eyes, stand on wooden legs with a tucked-up sort of air, as if to\nsay \"we intend to keep dry if we can.\" Even the horses wear a wide stool\non each hoof to lift them out of the mire. In short, the landscape\neverywhere suggests a paradise for ducks. It is a glorious country in\nsummer for barefooted girls and boys. Such wadings! such mimic ship\nsailing! Such rowing, fishing and swimming! Only think of a chain of\npuddles where one can launch chip boats all day long, and never make a\nreturn trip! But enough. A full recital would set all young America\nrushing in a body toward the Zuider Zee.\n\nDutch cities seem at first sight to be a bewildering jungle of houses,\nbridges, churches and ships, sprouting into masts, steeples and trees.\nIn some cities vessels are hitched like horses to their owners'\ndoor-posts and receive their freight from the upper windows. Mothers\nscream to Lodewyk and Kassy not to swing on the garden gate for fear\nthey may be drowned! Water-roads are more frequent there than\ncommon-roads and rail-ways; water-fences in the form of lazy green\nditches, enclose pleasure-ground, polder and garden.\n\nSometimes fine green hedges are seen; but wooden fences such as we have\nin America are rarely met with in Holland. As for stone fences, a\nDutchman would lift his hands with astonishment at the very idea. There\nis no stone there, excepting those great masses of rock, that have been\nbrought from other lands to strengthen and protect the coast. All the\nsmall stones or pebbles, if there ever were any, seem to be imprisoned\nin pavements or quite melted away. Boys with strong, quick arms may grow\nfrom pinafores to full beards without ever finding one to start the\nwater-rings or set the rabbits flying. The water-roads are nothing less\nthan canals intersecting the country in every direction. These are of\nall sizes, from the great North Holland Ship Canal, which is the wonder\nof the world, to those which a boy can leap. Water-omnibuses, called\n_trekschuiten_,[3] constantly ply up and down these roads for the\nconveyance of passengers; and water drays, called _pakschuyten_,[3] are\nused for carrying fuel, and merchandise. Instead of green country lanes,\ngreen canals stretch from field to barn and from barn to garden; and the\nfarms or _polders_, as they are termed, are merely great lakes pumped\ndry. Some of the busiest streets are water, while many of the country\nroads are paved with brick. The city boats with their rounded sterns,\ngilded prows and gaily painted sides, are unlike any others under the\nsun; and a Dutch wagon with its funny little crooked pole, is a perfect\nmystery of mysteries.\n\n[Footnote 3: Canal-boats. Some of the first named are over thirty feet\nlong. They look like green houses lodged on barges, and are drawn by\nhorses walking along the bank of the canal. The trekschuiten are divided\ninto two compartments, first and second class, and when not too crowded\nthe passengers make themselves quite at home in them; the men smoke, the\nwomen knit or sew, while children play upon the small outer deck. Many\nof the canal-boats have white, yellow, or chocolate-colored sails. This\nlast color is caused by a preparation of tan which is put on to preserve\nthem.]\n\n\"One thing is clear,\" cries Master Brightside, \"the inhabitants need\nnever be thirsty.\" But no, Odd-land is true to itself still.\nNotwithstanding the sea pushing to get in, and the lakes struggling to\nget out, and the overflowing canals, rivers and ditches, in many\ndistricts there is no water fit to swallow; our poor Hollanders must go\ndry, or drink wine and beer, or send far into the inland to Utrecht, and\nother favored localities, for that precious fluid older than Adam yet\nyoung as the morning dew. Sometimes, indeed, the inhabitants can swallow\na shower when they are provided with any means of catching it; but\ngenerally they are like the Albatross-haunted sailors in Coleridge's\nfamous poem of \"The Ancient Mariner\"--they see\n\n     \"Water, water everywhere,\n     Nor any drop to drink!\"\n\nGreat flapping windmills all over the country make it look as if flocks\nof huge sea-birds were just settling upon it. Everywhere one sees the\nfunniest trees, bobbed into fantastical shapes, with their trunks\npainted a dazzling white, yellow or red. Horses are often yoked three\nabreast. Men, women and children go clattering about in wooden shoes\nwith loose heels; peasant girls who cannot get beaux for love, hire them\nfor money to escort them to the Kermis;[4] and husbands and wives\nlovingly _harness_ themselves side by side on the bank of the canal and\ndrag their pakschuyts to market.\n\n[Footnote 4: Fair.]\n\nAnother peculiar feature of Holland is the _dune_ or sand-hill. These\nare numerous along certain portions of the coast. Before they were sown\nwith coarse reed-grass and other plants, to hold them down, they used to\nsend great storms of sand over the inland. So, to add to the oddities,\nfarmers sometimes dig down under the surface to find their soil, and on\nwindy days _dry_ showers (of sand) often fall upon fields that have\ngrown wet under a week of sunshine.\n\nIn short, almost the only familiar thing we Yankees can meet with in\nHolland is a harvest-song which is quite popular there, though no\nlinguist could translate it. Even then we must shut our eyes and listen\nonly to the tune which I leave you to guess.\n\n     \"Yanker didee dudel down\n       Didee dudel lawnter;\n     Yankee viver, voover, vown,\n       Botermelk und Tawnter!\"\n\nOn the other hand, many of the oddities of Holland serve only to prove\nthe thrift and perseverance of the people. There is not a richer, or\nmore carefully tilled garden-spot in the whole world than this leaky,\nspringy little country. There is not a braver, more heroic race than its\nquiet, passive-looking inhabitants. Few nations have equaled it in\nimportant discoveries and inventions; none has excelled it in commerce,\nnavigation, learning and science,--or set as noble examples in the\npromotion of education, and public charities; and none in proportion to\nits extent has expended more money and labor upon public works.\n\nHolland has its shining annals of noble and illustrious men and women;\nits grand, historic records of patience, resistance and victory; its\nreligious freedom, its enlightened enterprise, its art, its music and\nits literature. It has truly been called, \"the battle-field of Europe,\"\nas truly may we consider it the Asylum of the world, for the oppressed\nof every nation have there found shelter and encouragement. If we\nAmericans, who after all, are homeopathic preparations of Holland stock,\ncan laugh at the Dutch, and call them human beavers, and hint that their\ncountry may float off any day at high tide, we can also feel proud, and\nsay they have proved themselves heroes, and that their country will\n_not_ float off while there is a Dutchman left to grapple it.\n\nThere are said to be at least ninety-nine hundred large windmills in\nHolland, with sails ranging from eighty to one hundred and twenty feet\nlong. They are employed in sawing timber, beating hemp, grinding, and\nmany other kinds of work; but their principal use is for pumping water\nfrom the lowlands into the canals, and for guarding against the inland\nfreshets that so often deluge the country. Their yearly cost is said to\nbe nearly ten millions of dollars. The large ones are of great power.\nTheir huge, circular tower, rising sometimes from the midst of factory\nbuildings, is surmounted with a smaller one tapering into a cap-like\nroof. This upper tower is encircled at its base with a balcony, high\nabove which juts the axis turned by its four prodigious, ladder-backed\nsails.\n\nMany of the windmills are primitive affairs, seeming sadly in need of\nYankee \"improvements\"; but some of the new ones are admirable. They are\nso constructed that, by some ingenious contrivance, they present their\nfans, or wings, to the wind in precisely the right direction to work\nwith the requisite power. In other words, the miller may take a nap and\nfeel quite sure that his mill will study the wind, and make the most of\nit, until he wakens. Should there be but a slight current of air, every\nsail will spread itself to catch the faintest breath; but if a heavy\n\"blow\" should come, they will shrink at its touch, like great mimosa\nleaves, and only give it half a chance to move them.\n\nOne of the old prisons of Amsterdam, called the Rasphouse, because the\nthieves and vagrants who were confined there were employed in rasping\nlog-wood, had a cell for the punishment of lazy prisoners. In one corner\nof this cell was a pump and, in another, an opening through which a\nsteady stream of water was admitted. The prisoner could take his choice,\neither to stand still and be drowned, or to work for dear life at the\npump and keep the flood down until his jailer chose to relieve him. Now\nit seems to me that, throughout Holland, Nature has introduced this\nlittle diversion on a grand scale. The Dutch have always been forced to\npump for their very existence and probably must continue to do so to the\nend of time.\n\nEvery year millions of dollars are spent in repairing dykes, and\nregulating water levels. If these important duties were neglected the\ncountry would be uninhabitable. Already dreadful consequences, as I have\nsaid, have followed the bursting of these dykes. Hundreds of villages\nand towns have from time to time been buried beneath the rush of waters,\nand nearly a million of persons have been destroyed. One of the most\nfearful inundations ever known occurred in the autumn of the year 1570.\nTwenty-eight terrible floods had before that time overwhelmed portions\nof Holland, but this was the most terrible of all. The unhappy country\nhad long been suffering under Spanish tyranny; now, it seemed, the\ncrowning point was given to its troubles. When we read Motley's history\nof the Rise of the Dutch Republic we learn to revere the brave people\nwho have endured, suffered and dared so much.\n\nMr. Motley in his thrilling account of the great inundation tells us how\na long continued and violent gale had been sweeping the Atlantic waters\ninto the North Sea, piling them against the coasts of the Dutch\nprovinces; how the dykes, tasked beyond their strength, burst in all\ndirections; how even the Hand-bos, a bulwark formed of oaken piles,\nbraced with iron, moored with heavy anchors and secured by gravel and\ngranite, was snapped to pieces like packthread; how fishing boats and\nbulky vessels floating up into the country became entangled among the\ntrees, or beat in the roofs and walls of dwellings, and how at last all\nFriesland was converted into an angry sea. \"Multitudes of men, women,\nchildren, of horses, oxen, sheep, and every domestic animal, were\nstruggling in the waves in every direction. Every boat and every article\nwhich could serve as a boat, were eagerly seized upon. Every house was\ninundated, even the graveyards gave up their dead. The living infant in\nhis cradle, and the long-buried corpse in his coffin, floated side by\nside. The ancient flood seemed about to be renewed. Everywhere, upon the\ntops of trees, upon the steeples of churches, human beings were\nclustered, praying to God for mercy, and to their fellowmen for\nassistance. As the storm at last was subsiding, boats began to ply in\nevery direction, saving those who were struggling in the water, picking\nfugitives from roofs and tree tops, and collecting the bodies of those\nalready drowned.\" No less than one hundred thousand human beings had\nperished in a few hours. Thousands upon thousands of dumb creatures lay\ndead upon the waters; and the damage done to property of every\ndescription was beyond calculation.\n\nRobles, the Spanish Governor, was foremost in noble efforts to save life\nand lessen the horrors of the catastrophe. He had formerly been hated by\nthe Dutch because of his Spanish or Portuguese blood, but by his\ngoodness and activity in their hour of disaster, he won all hearts to\ngratitude. He soon introduced an improved method of constructing the\ndykes, and passed a law that they should in future be kept up by the\nowners of the soil. There were fewer heavy floods from this time, though\nwithin less than three hundred years six fearful inundations swept over\nthe land.\n\nIn the Spring there is always great danger of inland freshets,\nespecially in times of thaw, because the rivers, choked with blocks of\nice, overflow before they can discharge their rapidly rising waters into\nthe ocean. Added to this, the sea chafing and pressing against the\ndykes, it is no wonder that Holland is often in a state of alarm. The\ngreatest care is taken to prevent accidents. Engineers and workmen are\nstationed all along in threatened places and a close watch is kept up\nnight and day. When a general signal of danger is given, the inhabitants\nall rush to the rescue, eager to combine against their common foe. As,\neverywhere else, straw is supposed to be of all things the most helpless\nin the water, of course in Holland it must be rendered the mainstay\nagainst a rushing tide. Huge straw mats are pressed against the\nembankments, fortified with clay and heavy stone, and once adjusted, the\nocean dashes against them in vain.\n\nRaff Brinker, the father of Gretel and Hans, had for years been employed\nupon the dykes. It was at the time of a threatened inundation, when in\nthe midst of a terrible storm, in darkness and sleet, the men were\nlaboring at a weak spot near the Veermyk sluice, that he fell from the\nscaffolding, and was taken home insensible. From that hour he never\nworked again; though he lived on, mind and memory were gone.\n\nGretel could not remember him otherwise than as the strange, silent man,\nwhose eyes followed her vacantly whichever way she turned; but Hans had\nrecollections of a hearty, cheerful-voiced father who was never tired of\nbearing him upon his shoulder, and whose careless song still seemed\nechoing near when he lay awake at night and listened.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE SILVER SKATES\n\n\nDame Brinker earned a scanty support for her family by raising\nvegetables, spinning and knitting. Once she had worked on board the\nbarges plying up and down the canal, and had occasionally been harnessed\nwith other women to the towing rope of a pakschuyt plying between Broek\nand Amsterdam. But when Hans had grown strong and large, he had insisted\nupon doing all such drudgery in her place. Besides, her husband had\nbecome so very helpless of late, that he required her constant care.\nAlthough not having as much intelligence as a little child, he was yet\nstrong of arm and very hearty, and Dame Brinker had sometimes great\ntrouble in controlling him.\n\n\"Ah! children, he was so good and steady,\" she would sometimes say, \"and\nas wise as a lawyer. Even the Burgomaster would stop to ask him a\nquestion, and now alack! he don't know his wife and little ones. You\nremember the father, Hans, when he was himself--a great brave man--don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, mother, he knew everything, and could do anything under\nthe sun--and how he would sing! why, you used to laugh and say it was\nenough to set the windmills dancing.\"\n\n\"So I did. Bless me! how the boy remembers! Gretel, child, take that\nknitting needle from your father, quick; he'll get it in his eyes may\nbe; and put the shoe on him. His poor feet are like ice half the time,\nbut I can't keep 'em covered all I can do----\" and then half wailing,\nhalf humming, Dame Brinker would sit down, and fill the low cottage with\nthe whirr of her spinning wheel.\n\nNearly all the outdoor work, as well as the household labor, was\nperformed by Hans and Gretel. At certain seasons of the year the\nchildren went out day after day to gather peat, which they would stow\naway in square, brick-like pieces, for fuel. At other times, when\nhome-work permitted, Hans rode the towing-horses on the canals, earning\na few stivers[5] a day; and Gretel tended geese for the neighboring\nfarmers.\n\n[Footnote 5: A stiver is worth about two cents of our money.]\n\nHans was clever at carving in wood, and both he and Gretel were good\ngardeners. Gretel could sing and sew and run on great, high, home-made\nstilts better than any girl for miles around. She could learn a ballad\nin five minutes, and find, in its season, any weed or flower you could\nname; but she dreaded books, and often the very sight of the\nfiguring-board in the old schoolhouse would set her eyes swimming. Hans,\non the contrary, was slow and steady. The harder the task, whether in\nstudy or daily labor, the better he liked it. Boys who sneered at him\nout of school, on account of his patched clothes and scant leather\nbreeches, were forced to yield him the post of honor in nearly every\nclass. It was not long before he was the only youngster in the school\nwho had not stood at least _once_ in the corner of horrors, where hung a\ndreaded whip, and over it this motto:\n\n     \"Leer, leer! jou luigaart, of dit endje touw zal je le\n     ren!\"[6]\n\n[Footnote 6: (Learn! learn! you idler, or this rope's end shall teach\nyou.)]\n\nIt was only in winter that Gretel and Hans could be spared to attend\nschool; and for the past month they had been kept at home because their\nmother needed their services. Raff Brinker required constant attention,\nand there was black bread to be made, and the house to be kept clean,\nand stockings and other things to be knitted and sold in the\nmarket-place.\n\nWhile they were busily assisting their mother on this cold December\nmorning, a merry troop of girls and boys came skimming down the canal.\nThere were fine skaters among them, and as the bright medley of costumes\nflitted by, it looked from a distance as though the ice had suddenly\nthawed, and some gay tulip-bed were floating along on the current.\n\nThere was the rich burgomaster's daughter Hilda van Gleck, with her\ncostly furs and loose-fitting velvet sack; and, near by, a pretty\npeasant girl, Annie Bouman, jauntily attired in a coarse scarlet jacket\nand a blue skirt just short enough to display the gray homespun hose to\nadvantage. Then there was the proud Rychie Korbes, whose father, Mynheer\nvan Korbes, was one of the leading men of Amsterdam; and, flocking\nclosely around her, Carl Schummel, Peter and Ludwig[7] van Holp, Jacob\nPoot, and a very small boy rejoicing in the tremendous name of\nVoostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck. There were nearly twenty other boys and\ngirls in the party, and one and all seemed full of excitement and\nfrolic.\n\n[Footnote 7: Ludwig, Gretel, and Carl were named after German friends.\nThe Dutch form would be Lodewyk, Grietje and Karel.]\n\n[Illustration: _Hans was clever at carving in wood_]\n\nUp and down the canal, within the space of a half mile they skated,\nexerting their racing powers to the utmost. Often the swiftest among\nthem was seen to dodge from under the very nose of some pompous\nlaw-giver or doctor, who with folded arms was skating leisurely toward\nthe town; or a chain of girls would suddenly break at the approach of a\nfat old burgomaster who, with gold-headed cane poised in air, was\npuffing his way to Amsterdam. Equipped in skates wonderful to behold,\nfrom their superb strappings, and dazzling runners curving over the\ninstep and topped with gilt balls, he would open his fat eyes a little\nif one of the maidens chanced to drop him a courtesy, but would not dare\nto bow in return for fear of losing his balance.\n\nNot only pleasure-seekers and stately men of note were upon the canal.\nThere were work-people, with weary eyes, hastening to their shops and\nfactories; market-women with loads upon their heads; peddlers bending\nwith their packs; barge-men with shaggy hair and bleared faces, jostling\nroughly on their way; kind-eyed clergymen speeding perhaps to the\nbedsides of the dying; and, after a while, groups of children, with\nsatchels slung over their shoulders, whizzing past, toward the distant\nschool. One and all wore skates excepting, indeed, a muffled-up farmer\nwhose queer cart bumped along on the margin of the canal.\n\nBefore long our merry boys and girls were almost lost in the confusion\nof bright colors, the ceaseless motion, and the gleaming of skates\nflashing back the sunlight. We might have known no more of them had not\nthe whole party suddenly come to a standstill and, grouping themselves\nout of the way of the passers-by, all talked at once to a pretty little\nmaiden, whom they had drawn from the tide of people flowing toward the\ntown.\n\n\"Oh Katrinka!\" they cried, in a breath, \"have you heard of it? The\nrace--We want you to join!\"\n\n\"What race?\" asked Katrinka, laughing--\"Don't all talk at once, please,\nI can't understand.\"\n\nEvery one panted and looked at Rychie Korbes, who was their acknowledged\nspokeswoman.\n\n\"Why,\" said Rychie, \"we are to have a grand skating match on the\ntwentieth, on Meurouw[8] van Gleck's birthday. It's all Hilda's work.\nThey are going to give a splendid prize to the best skater.\"\n\n[Footnote 8: Mrs. or Madame (pronounced Meffrow).]\n\n\"Yes,\" chimed in half a dozen voices, \"a beautiful pair of silver\nskates--perfectly magnificent! with, oh! such straps and silver bells\nand buckles!\"\n\n\"_Who_ said they had bells?\" put in the small voice of the boy with the\nbig name.\n\n\"_I_ say so, Master Voost,\" replied Rychie.\n\n\"So they have,\"--\"No, I'm sure they haven't,\"--\"_Oh_, how can you say\nso?\"--\"It's an arrow\"--\"And Mynheer van Korbes told _my_ mother they had\nbells,\"--came from sundry of the excited group; but Mynheer\nVoostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck essayed to settle the matter with a\ndecisive--\n\n\"Well, you don't any of you know a single thing about it; they haven't a\nsign of a bell on them, they----\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" and the chorus of conflicting opinion broke forth again.\n\n\"The girls' pair are to have bells,\" interposed Hilda, quietly, \"but\nthere is to be another pair for the boys with an arrow engraved upon the\nsides.\"\n\n\"_There!_ I told you so!\" cried nearly all the youngsters in a breath.\n\nKatrinka looked at them with bewildered eyes.\n\n\"Who is to try?\" she asked.\n\n\"All of us,\" answered Rychie. \"It will be such fun! And you must, too,\nKatrinka. But it's school time now, we will talk it all over at noon.\nOh! you will join of course.\"\n\nKatrinka, without replying, made a graceful pirouette, and laughing out\na coquettish--\"Don't you hear the last bell? Catch me!\"--darted off\ntoward the schoolhouse, standing half a mile away, on the canal.\n\nAll started, pell-mell, at this challenge, but they tried in vain to\ncatch the bright-eyed, laughing creature who, with golden hair streaming\nin the sunlight, cast back many a sparkling glance of triumph as she\nfloated onward.\n\nBeautiful Katrinka! Flushed with youth and health, all life and mirth\nand motion, what wonder thine image, ever floating in advance, sped\nthrough one boy's dreams that night! What wonder that it seemed his\ndarkest hour when, years afterward, thy presence floated away from him\nforever.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nHANS AND GRETEL FIND A FRIEND\n\n\nAt noon our young friends poured forth from the schoolhouse intent upon\nhaving an hour's practicing upon the canal.\n\nThey had skated but a few moments when Carl Schummel said mockingly to\nHilda:\n\n\"There's a pretty pair just coming upon the ice! The little rag-pickers!\nTheir skates must have been a present from the king direct.\"\n\n\"They are patient creatures,\" said Hilda, gently. \"It must have been\nhard to learn to skate upon such queer affairs. They are very poor\npeasants, you see. The boy has probably made the skates himself.\"\n\nCarl was somewhat abashed.\n\n\"Patient they may be, but as for skating, they start off pretty well\nonly to finish with a jerk. They could move well to your new _staccato_\npiece I think.\"\n\nHilda laughed pleasantly and left him. After joining a small detachment\nof the racers, and sailing past every one of them, she halted beside\nGretel who, with eager eyes, had been watching the sport.\n\n\"What is your name, little girl?\"\n\n\"Gretel, my lady,\" answered the child, somewhat awed by Hilda's rank,\nthough they were nearly of the same age, \"and my brother is called\nHans.\"\n\n\"Hans is a stout fellow,\" said Hilda, cheerily, \"and seems to have a\nwarm stove somewhere within him, but _you_ look cold. You should wear\nmore clothing, little one.\"\n\nGretel, who had nothing else to wear, tried to laugh as she answered:\n\n\"I am not so very little. I am past twelve years old.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon. You see I am nearly fourteen, and so large of my\nage that other girls seem small to me, but that is nothing. Perhaps you\nwill shoot up far above me yet; not unless you dress more warmly,\nthough--shivering girls never grow.\"\n\nHans flushed as he saw tears rising in Gretel's eyes.\n\n\"My sister has not complained of the cold; but this is bitter weather\nthey say----\" and he looked sadly upon Gretel.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said Gretel. \"I am often warm--too warm when I am\nskating. You are good, jufvrouw,[9] to think of it.\"\n\n[Footnote 9: Miss--Young lady (pronounced yuffrow). In studied or polite\naddress it would be jongvrowe (pronounced youngfrow).]\n\n\"No, no,\" answered Hilda, quite angry at herself. \"I am careless, cruel;\nbut I meant no harm. I wanted to ask you--I mean--if----\" and here\nHilda, coming to the point of her errand, faltered before the poorly\nclad but noble-looking children she wished to serve.\n\n\"What is it, young lady?\" exclaimed Hans eagerly. \"If there is any\nservice I can do? any----\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no,\" laughed Hilda, shaking off her embarrassment, \"I only\nwished to speak to you about the grand race. Why do you not join it? You\nboth can skate well, and the ranks are free. Any one may enter for the\nprize.\"\n\nGretel looked wistfully at Hans, who tugging at his cap, answered\nrespectfully.\n\n\"Ah, jufvrouw, even if we could enter, we could skate only a few\nstrokes with the rest. Our skates are hard wood you see,\" (holding up\nthe sole of his foot), \"but they soon become damp, and then they stick\nand trip us.\"\n\nGretel's eyes twinkled with fun as she thought of Hans' mishap in the\nmorning, but she blushed as she faltered out timidly:\n\n\"Oh no, we can't join; but may we be there, my lady, on the great day to\nlook on?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Hilda, looking kindly into the two earnest faces,\nand wishing from her heart that she had not spent so much of her monthly\nallowance for lace and finery. She had but eight kwartjes[10] left, and\nthey would buy but one pair of skates, at the furthest.\n\n[Footnote 10: A kwartje is a small silver coin worth one quarter of a\nguilder, or 10 cents in American currency.]\n\nLooking down with a sigh at the two pairs of feet so very different in\nsize, she asked:\n\n\"Which of you is the better skater?\"\n\n\"Gretel,\" replied Hans, promptly.\n\n\"Hans,\" answered Gretel, in the same breath.\n\nHilda smiled.\n\n\"I cannot buy you each a pair of skates, or even one good pair; but here\nare eight kwartjes. Decide between you which stands the best chance of\nwinning the race, and buy the skates accordingly. I wish I had enough to\nbuy better ones--good-bye!\" and, with a nod and a smile, Hilda, after\nhanding the money to the electrified Hans, glided swiftly away to rejoin\nher companions.\n\n\"Jufvrouw! jufvrouw von Gleck!\" called Hans in a loud tone, stumbling\nafter her as well as he could, for one of his skate-strings was untied.\n\nHilda turned, and with one hand raised to shield her eyes from the sun,\nseemed to him to be floating through the air, nearer and nearer.\n\n\"We cannot take this money,\" panted Hans, \"though we know your goodness\nin giving it.\"\n\n\"Why not indeed?\" asked Hilda flushing.\n\n\"Because,\" replied Hans, bowing like a clown, but looking with the eye\nof a prince at the queenly girl, \"we have not earned it.\"\n\nHilda was quick-witted. She had noticed a pretty wooden chain upon\nGretel's neck.\n\n\"Carve me a chain, Hans, like the one your sister wears.\"\n\n\"That I will, lady, with all my heart; we have white wood in the house,\nfine as ivory; you shall have one to-morrow,\" and Hans hastily tried to\nreturn the money.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Hilda decidedly. \"That sum will be but a poor price for\nthe chain,\" and off she darted, out-stripping the fleetest among the\nskaters.\n\nHans sent a long, bewildered gaze after her; it was useless he felt to\nmake any further resistance.\n\n\"It is right,\" he muttered, half to himself, half to his faithful\nshadow, Gretel, \"I must work hard every minute, and sit up half the\nnight if the mother will let me burn a candle; but the chain shall be\nfinished. We may keep the money, Gretel.\"\n\n\"What a good little lady!\" cried Gretel clapping her hands with delight,\n\"oh! Hans, was it for nothing the stork settled on our roof last summer?\nDo you remember how the mother said it would bring us luck and how she\ncried when Janzoon Kolp shot him? And she said it would bring him\ntrouble. But the luck has come to us at last! Now, Hans, if mother sends\nus to town to-morrow you can buy the skates in the market-place.\"\n\nHans shook his head. \"The young lady would have given us the money to\nbuy skates, but if I _earn_ it, Gretel, it shall be spent for wool. You\nmust have a warm jacket.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Gretel, in real dismay, \"not buy the skates! Why, I am not\noften cold! Mother says the blood runs up and down in poor children's\nveins humming 'I must keep 'em warm! I must keep 'em warm.'\n\n\"Oh, Hans,\" she continued with something like a sob, \"don't say you\nwon't buy the skates, it makes me feel just like crying--besides, I want\nto be cold--I mean I'm real, awful warm--so now!\"\n\nHans looked up hurriedly. He had a true Dutch horror of tears, or\nemotion of any kind, and, most of all, he dreaded to see his sister's\nblue eyes overflowing.\n\n\"Now mind,\" cried Gretel, seeing her advantage, \"I'll feel awful if you\ngive up the skates. _I_ don't want them. I'm not such a stingy as that;\nbut I want _you_ to have them, and then when I get bigger they'll do for\nme--oh-h--count the pieces, Hans. Did ever you see so many!\"\n\nHans turned the money thoughtfully in his palm. Never in all his life\nhad he longed so intensely for a pair of skates, for he had known of the\nrace and had, boy-like, fairly ached for a chance to test his powers\nwith the other children. He felt confident that with a good pair of\nsteel runners, he could readily distance most of the boys on the canal.\nThen, too, Gretel's argument was so plausible. On the other hand, he\nknew that she, with her strong but lithe little frame, needed but a\nweek's practice on good runners, to make her a better skater than\nRychie Korbes or even Katrinka Flack. As soon as this last thought\nflashed upon him his resolve was made. If Gretel would not have the\njacket, she should have the skates.\n\n\"No, Gretel,\" he answered at last, \"I can wait. Some day I may have\nmoney enough saved to buy a fine pair. You shall have these.\"\n\nGretel's eyes sparkled; but in another instant she insisted, rather\nfaintly:\n\n\"The young lady gave the money to _you_, Hans. I'd be real bad to take\nit.\"\n\nHans shook his head, resolutely, as he trudged on, causing his sister to\nhalf skip and half walk in her effort to keep beside him; by this time\nthey had taken off their wooden \"rockers,\" and were hastening home to\ntell their mother the good news.\n\n\"Oh! _I_ know!\" cried Gretel, in a sprightly tone. \"You can do this. You\ncan get a pair a little too small for you, and too big for me, and we\ncan take turns and use them. Won't that be fine?\" and Gretel clapped her\nhands again.\n\nPoor Hans! This was a strong temptation, but he pushed it away from him,\nbrave-hearted fellow that he was.\n\n\"Nonsense, Gretel. You could never get on with a big pair. You stumbled\nabout with these, like a blind chicken, before I curved off the ends.\nNo, you must have a pair to fit exactly, and you must practice every\nchance you can get, until the Twentieth comes. My little Gretel shall\nwin the silver skates.\"\n\nGretel could not help laughing with delight at the very idea.\n\n\"Hans! Gretel!\" called out a familiar voice.\n\n\"Coming, mother!\" and they hastened toward the cottage, Hans still\nshaking the pieces of silver in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the following day, there was not a prouder nor a happier boy in all\nHolland than Hans Brinker, as he watched his sister, with many a\ndexterous sweep, flying in and out among the skaters who at sundown\nthronged the canal. A warm jacket had been given her by the kind-hearted\nHilda, and the burst-out shoes had been cobbled into decency by Dame\nBrinker. As the little creature darted backward and forward, flushed\nwith enjoyment, and quite unconscious of the many wondering glances bent\nupon her, she felt that the shining runners beneath her feet had\nsuddenly turned earth into Fairy-land, while \"Hans, dear, good Hans!\"\nechoed itself over and over again in her grateful heart.\n\n\"By den donder!\" exclaimed Peter van Holp to Carl Schummel, \"but that\nlittle one in the red jacket and patched petticoat skates well. Gunst!\nshe has toes on her heels, and eyes in the back of her head! See her. It\nwill be a joke if she gets in the race and beats Katrinka Flack, after\nall.\"\n\n\"Hush! not so loud!\" returned Carl, rather sneeringly. \"That little lady\nin rags is the special pet of Hilda van Gleck. Those shining skates are\nher gift, if I make no mistake.\"\n\n\"So! so!\" exclaimed Peter, with a radiant smile, for Hilda was his best\nfriend. \"She has been at her good work there, too!\" And Mynheer van\nHolp, after cutting a double 8 on the ice, to say nothing of a huge P,\nthen a jump, and an H, glided onward until he found himself beside\nHilda.\n\nHand in hand, they skated together, laughingly at first, then staidly\ntalking in a low tone.\n\nStrange to say, Peter van Holp soon arrived at a sudden conviction that\nhis little sister needed a wooden chain just like Hilda's.\n\nTwo days afterward, on St. Nicholas' Eve, Hans, having burned three\ncandle-ends, and cut his thumb into the bargain, stood in the\nmarket-place at Amsterdam, buying another pair of skates.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nSHADOWS IN THE HOME\n\n\nGood Dame Brinker! As soon as the scanty dinner had been cleared away\nthat noon, she had arrayed herself in her holiday attire, in honor of\nSaint Nicholas. \"It will brighten the children,\" she thought to herself,\nand she was not mistaken. This festival dress had been worn very seldom\nduring the past ten years; before that time it had done good service,\nand had flourished at many a dance and Kermis, when she was known, far\nand wide, as the pretty Meitje Klenck. The children had sometimes been\ngranted rare glimpses of it as it lay in state in the old oaken chest.\nFaded and threadbare as it was, it was gorgeous in their eyes, with its\nwhite linen tucker, now gathered to her plump throat, and vanishing\nbeneath the trim bodice of blue homespun, and its reddish brown skirt\nbordered with black. The knitted woolen mitts, and the dainty cap\nshowing her hair, which generally was hidden, made her seem almost like\na princess to Gretel, while master Hans grew staid and well-behaved as\nhe gazed.\n\nSoon the little maid, while braiding her own golden tresses, fairly\ndanced around her mother in an ecstasy of admiration.\n\n\"Oh, mother, mother, mother, how pretty you are! Look, Hans! isn't it\njust like a picture?\"\n\n\"Just like a picture,\" assented Hans, cheerfully, \"_just_ like a\npicture--only I don't like those stocking things on the hands.\"\n\n\"Not like the mitts, brother Hans! why, they're very\nimportant--see--they cover up all the red. Oh, mother, how white your\narm is where the mitt leaves off, whiter than mine, oh, ever so much\nwhiter. I declare, mother, the bodice is tight for you. You're growing!\nYou're surely growing!\"\n\nDame Brinker laughed.\n\n\"This was made long ago, lovey, when I wasn't much thicker about the\nwaist than a churn-dasher. And how do you like the cap?\" turning her\nhead from side to side.\n\n\"Oh, _ever_ so much, mother. It's b-e-a-u-tiful! see! The father is\nlooking!\"\n\nWas the father looking? Alas, only with a dull stare. His vrouw turned\ntoward him with a start, something like a blush rising to her cheeks, a\nquestioning sparkle in her eye.--The bright look died away in an\ninstant.\n\n\"No, no,\" she sighed, \"he sees nothing. Come, Hans\" (and the smile crept\nfaintly back again), \"don't stand gaping at me all day, and the new\nskates waiting for you at Amsterdam.\"\n\n\"Ah, mother,\" he answered, \"you need many things. Why should I buy\nskates?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, child. The money was given to you on purpose, or the work\nwas--it's all the same thing--Go while the sun is high.\"\n\n\"Yes, and hurry back, Hans!\" laughed Gretel; \"we'll race on the canal\nto-night, if the mother lets us.\"\n\nAt the very threshold he turned to say--\"Your spinning wheel wants a new\ntreadle, mother.\"\n\n\"You can make it, Hans.\"\n\n\"So I can. That will take no money. But you need feathers, and wool and\nmeal, and----\"\n\n\"There, there! That will do. Your silver cannot buy everything. Ah!\nHans, if our stolen money would but come back on this bright Saint\nNicholas' Eve, how glad we would be! Only last night I prayed to the\ngood Saint----\"\n\n\"Mother!\" interrupted Hans in dismay.\n\n\"Why not, Hans! Shame on you to reproach me for that! I'm as true a\nprotestant, in sooth, as any fine lady that walks into church, but it's\nno wrong to turn sometimes to the good Saint Nicholas. Tut! It's a\nlikely story if one can't do that, without one's children flaring up at\nit--and he the boys' and girls' own saint--Hoot! mayhap the colt is a\nsteadier horse than the mare?\"\n\nHans knew his mother too well to offer a word in opposition, when her\nvoice quickened and sharpened as it did now (it was often sharp and\nquick when she spoke of the missing money) so he said, gently:\n\n\"And what did you ask of good Saint Nicholas, mother?\"\n\n\"Why, to never give the thieves a wink of sleep till they brought it\nback, to be sure, if he's power to do such things, or else to brighten\nour wits that we might find it ourselves. Not a sight have I had of it\nsince the day before the dear father was hurt--as you well know, Hans.\"\n\n\"That I do, mother,\" he answered sadly, \"though you have almost pulled\ndown the cottage in searching.\"\n\n\"Aye; but it was of no use,\" moaned the dame, \"_'hiders_ make best\nfinders.'\"\n\nHans started. \"Do you think the father could tell aught?\" he asked\nmysteriously.\n\n\"Aye, indeed,\" said Dame Brinker, nodding her head, \"I think so, but\nthat is no sign. I never hold the same belief in the matter two days.\nMayhap the father paid it off for the great silver watch we have been\nguarding since that day. But, no--I'll never believe it.\"\n\n\"The watch was not worth a quarter of the money, mother.\"\n\n\"No, indeed; and your father was a shrewd man up to the last moment. He\nwas too steady and thrifty for silly doings.\"\n\n\"Where _did_ the watch come from, I wonder,\" muttered Hans, half to\nhimself.\n\nDame Brinker shook her head, and looked sadly toward her husband, who\nsat staring blankly at the floor. Gretel stood near him, knitting.\n\n\"That we shall never know, Hans. I have shown it to the father many a\ntime, but he does not know it from a potato. When he came in that\ndreadful night to supper he handed the watch to me and told me to take\ngood care of it until he asked for it again. Just as he opened his lips\nto say more, Broom Klatterboost came flying in with word that the dyke\nwas in danger. Ah! the waters were terrible that holy Pinxter-week! My\nman, alack, caught up his tools and ran out. That was the last I ever\nsaw of him in his right mind. He was brought in again by midnight,\nnearly dead, with his poor head all bruised and cut. The fever passed\noff in time but never the dullness--_that_ grew worse every day. We\nshall never know.\"\n\nHans had heard all this before. More than once he had seen his mother,\nin hours of sore need, take the watch from its hiding-place,\nhalf-resolved to sell it, but she had always conquered the temptation.\n\n\"No, Hans,\" she would say, \"we must be nearer starving than this before\nwe turn faithless to the father!\"\n\nA memory of some such scene crossed her son's mind now; for, after\ngiving a heavy sigh, and filliping a crumb of wax at Gretel across the\ntable, he said:\n\n\"Aye, mother, you have done bravely to keep it--many a one would have\ntossed it off for gold long ago.\"\n\n\"And more shame for them!\" exclaimed the dame, indignantly. \"_I_ would\nnot do it. Besides, the gentry are so hard on us poor folks that if they\nsaw such a thing in our hands, even if we told all, they might suspect\nthe father of----\"\n\nHans flushed angrily.\n\n\"They would not _dare_ to say such a thing, mother! If they\ndid--I'd----\"\n\nHe clenched his fist, and seemed to think that the rest of his sentence\nwas too terrible to utter in her presence.\n\nDame Brinker smiled proudly through her tears at this interruption.\n\n\"Ah, Hans, thou'rt a true, brave lad. We will never part company with\nthe watch. In his dying hour the dear father might wake and ask for it.\"\n\n\"Might _wake_, mother!\" echoed Hans, \"wake--and know us?\"\n\n\"Aye, child,\" almost whispered his mother, \"such things have been.\"\n\nBy this time Hans had nearly forgotten his proposed errand to Amsterdam.\nHis mother had seldom spoken so familiarly with him. He felt himself now\nto be not only her son, but her friend, her adviser.\n\n\"You are right, mother. We must never give up the watch. For the\nfather's sake, we will guard it always. The money, though, may come to\nlight when we least expect it.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Dame Brinker, taking the last stitch from her needle with\na jerk, and laying the unfinished knitting heavily upon her lap. \"There\nis no chance! One thousand guilders! and all gone in a day! One thousand\nguilders--Oh! what ever _did_ become of them? If they went in an evil\nway, the thief would have confessed by this on his dying bed--he would\nnot dare to die with such guilt on his soul!\"\n\n\"He may not be dead yet,\" said Hans, soothingly; \"any day we may hear of\nhim.\"\n\n\"Ah, child,\" she said in a changed tone, \"what thief would ever have\ncome _here_? It was always neat and clean, thank God! but not fine; for\nthe father and I saved and saved that we might have something laid by.\n'Little and often soon fills the pouch.' We found it so, in truth;\nbesides, the father had a goodly sum, already, for service done to the\nHeernocht lands, at the time of the great inundation. Every week we had\na guilder left over, sometimes more; for the father worked extra hours,\nand could get high pay for his labor. Every Saturday night we put\nsomething by, except the time when you had the fever, Hans, and when\nGretel came. At last the pouch grew so full that I mended an old\nstocking and commenced again. Now that I look back, it seems that the\nmoney was up to the heel in a few sunny weeks. There was great pay in\nthose days if a man was quick at engineer work. The stocking went on\nfilling with copper and silver--aye, and gold. You may well open your\neyes, Gretel. I used to laugh and tell the father it was not for poverty\nI wore my old gown;--and the stocking went on filling--so full that\nsometimes when I woke at night, I'd get up, soft and quiet, and go feel\nit in the moonlight. Then, on my knees, I would thank our Lord that my\nlittle ones could in time get good learning, and that the father might\nrest from labor in his old age. Sometimes, at supper, the father and I\nwould talk about a new chimney and a good winter-room for the cow; but\nmy man forsooth had finer plans even than that. 'A big sail,' says he,\n'catches the wind--we can do what we will soon,' and then we would sing\ntogether as I washed my dishes. Ah, 'a smooth sea makes an easy\nrudder,'--not a thing vexed me from morning till night. Every week the\nfather would take out the stocking, and drop in the money and laugh and\nkiss me as we tied it up together.--Up with you, Hans! there you sit\ngaping, and the day a-wasting!\" added Dame Brinker tartly, blushing to\nfind that she had been speaking too freely to her boy; \"it's high time\nyou were on your way.\"\n\nHans had seated himself and was looking earnestly into her face. He\narose, and, in almost a whisper, asked:\n\n\"Have you ever _tried_, mother?\"\n\nShe understood him.\n\n\"Yes, child, often. But the father only laughs, or he stares at me so\nstrange I am glad to ask no more. When you and Gretel had the fever last\nWinter, and our bread was nearly gone, and I could earn nothing, for\nfear you would die while my face was turned, oh! I tried then! I\nsmoothed his hair, and whispered to him soft as a kitten, about the\nmoney--where it was--who had it? Alack! he would pick at my sleeve, and\nwhisper gibberish till my blood ran cold. At last, while Gretel lay\nwhiter than snow, and you were raving on the bed, I SCREAMED to him--it\nseemed as if he _must_ hear me--'Raff, where is our money? Do you know\naught of the money, Raff?--the money in the pouch and the stocking, in\nthe big chest?'--but I might as well have talked to a stone--I might\nas----\"\n\nThe mother's voice sounded so strangely, and her eye was so bright, that\nHans, with a new anxiety, laid his hand upon her shoulder.\n\n\"Come, mother,\" he said, \"let us try to forget this money. I am big and\nstrong--Gretel, too, is very quick and willing. Soon all will be\nprosperous with us again. Why, mother, Gretel and I would rather see\nthee bright and happy, than to have all the silver in the\nworld--wouldn't we, Gretel?\"\n\n\"The mother knows it,\" said Gretel, sobbing.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nSUNBEAMS\n\n\nDame Brinker was startled at her children's emotion, glad, too, for it\nproved how loving and true they were.\n\nBeautiful ladies, in princely homes, often smile suddenly and sweetly,\ngladdening the very air around them; but I doubt if their smile be more\nwelcome in God's sight than that which sprang forth to cheer the roughly\nclad boy and girl in the humble cottage. Dame Brinker felt that she had\nbeen selfish. Blushing and brightening, she hastily wiped her eyes, and\nlooked upon them as only a mother can.\n\n\"Hoity! Toity! pretty talk we're having, and Saint Nicholas' Eve almost\nhere! What wonder the yarn pricks my fingers! Come, Gretel, take this\ncent,[11] and while Hans is trading for the skates you can buy a waffle\nin the market-place.\"\n\n[Footnote 11: The Dutch cent is worth less than half of an American\ncent.]\n\n\"Let me stay home with you, mother,\" said Gretel, looking up with eyes\nthat sparkled through their tears. \"Hans will buy me the cake.\"\n\n\"As you will, child, and Hans--wait a moment. Three turns of the needle\nwill finish this toe, and then you may have as good a pair of hose as\never were knitted (owning the yarn is a grain too sharp,) to sell to the\nhosier on the Heireen Gracht.[12] That will give us three\nquarter-guilders if you make good trade; and as it's right hungry\nweather, you may buy four waffles. We'll keep the Feast of Saint\nNicholas after all.\"\n\n[Footnote 12: A street in Amsterdam.]\n\nGretel clapped her hands. \"That will be fine! Annie Bouman told me what\ngrand times they will have in the big houses to-night. But we will be\nmerry too. Hans will have beautiful new skates,--and then there'll be\nthe waffles! Oh-h! Don't break them, brother Hans. Wrap them well, and\nbutton them under your jacket very carefully.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Hans quite gruff with pleasure and importance.\n\n\"Oh! mother!\" cried Gretel in high glee, \"soon you will be busied with\nthe father, and now you are only knitting. Do tell us all about Saint\nNicholas!\"\n\nDame Brinker laughed to see Hans hang up his hat and prepare to listen.\n\"Nonsense, children,\" she said, \"I have told it to you often.\"\n\n\"Tell us again! oh, _do_ tell us again!\" cried Gretel, throwing herself\nupon the wonderful wooden bench that her brother had made on the\nmother's last birthday. Hans, not wishing to appear childish, and yet\nquite willing to hear the story, stood carelessly swinging his skates\nagainst the fireplace.\n\n\"Well, children, you shall hear it, but we must never waste the daylight\nagain in this way. Pick up your ball, Gretel, and let your sock grow as\nI talk. Opening your ears needn't shut your fingers. Saint Nicholas, you\nmust know, is a wonderful saint. He keeps his eye open for the good of\nsailors, but he cares most of all for boys and girls. Well, once upon a\ntime, when he was living on the earth, a merchant of Asia sent his three\nsons to a great city, called Athens, to get learning.\"\n\n\"Is Athens in Holland, mother?\" asked Gretel.\n\n\"I don't know, child. Probably it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, mother,\" said Hans, respectfully. \"I had that in my geography\nlessons long ago. Athens is in Greece.\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed the mother, \"what matter? Greece may belong to the King,\nfor aught we know. Anyhow, this rich merchant sent his sons to Athens.\nWhile they were on their way, they stopped one night at a shabby inn,\nmeaning to take up their journey in the morning. Well, they had very\nfine clothes,--velvet and silk, it may be, such as rich folks' children,\nall over the world, think nothing of wearing--and their belts, likewise,\nwere full of money. What did the wicked landlord do, but contrive a plan\nto kill the children, and take their money and all their beautiful\nclothes himself. So that night, when all the world was asleep he got up\nand killed the three young gentlemen.\"\n\nGretel clasped her hands and shuddered, but Hans tried to look as if\nkilling and murder were every-day matters to him.\n\n\"That was not the worst of it,\" continued Dame Brinker, knitting slowly,\nand trying to keep count of her stitches as she talked, \"that was not\nnear the worst of it. The dreadful landlord went and cut up the young\ngentlemen's bodies into little pieces, and threw them into a great tub\nof brine, intending to sell them for pickled pork!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Gretel, horror-stricken, though she had often heard the\nstory before. Hans still continued unmoved, and seemed to think that\npickling was the best that could be done under the circumstances.\n\n\"Yes, he pickled them, and one might think that would have been the last\nof the young gentlemen. But no. That night Saint Nicholas had a\nwonderful vision, and in it he saw the landlord cutting up the\nmerchant's children. There was no need of his hurrying, you know, for\nhe was a saint; but in the morning he went to the inn and charged the\nlandlord with the murder. Then the wicked landlord confessed it from\nbeginning to end, and fell down on his knees, begging forgiveness. He\nfelt so sorry for what he had done that he asked the saint to bring the\nyoung masters to life.\"\n\n\"And did the saint do it?\" asked Gretel, delighted, well knowing what\nthe answer would be.\n\n\"Of course he did. The pickled pieces flew together in an instant, and\nout jumped the young gentlemen from the brine-tub. They cast themselves\nat the feet of Saint Nicholas and he gave them his blessing, and--oh!\nmercy on us, Hans, it will be dark before you get back if you don't\nstart this minute!\"\n\nBy this time Dame Brinker was almost out of breath and quite out of\ncommas. She could not remember when she had seen the children idle away\nan hour of daylight in this manner, and the thought of such luxury quite\nappalled her. By way of compensation she now flew about the room in\nextreme haste. Tossing a block of peat upon the fire, blowing invisible\ndust from the table, and handing the finished hose to Hans, all in an\ninstant--\n\n\"Come, Hans,\" she said, as her boy lingered by the door, \"what keeps\nthee?\"\n\nHans kissed his mother's plump cheek, rosy and fresh yet, in spite of\nall her troubles.\n\n\"My mother is the best in the world, and I would be right glad to have a\npair of skates, but\"--and, as he buttoned his jacket, he looked, in a\ntroubled way, toward a strange figure crouching by the hearth-stone--\"If\nmy money would bring a meester[13] from Amsterdam to see the father,\nsomething might yet be done.\"\n\n[Footnote 13: Doctor (dokter in Dutch) called meester by the lower\nclass.]\n\n\"A meester would not come, Hans, for twice that money, and it would do\nno good if he did. Ah! how many guilders I once spent for that; but the\ndear, good father would not waken. It is God's will. Go, Hans, and buy\nthe skates.\"\n\nHans started with a heavy heart, but since the heart was young, and in a\nboy's bosom, it set him whistling in less than five minutes. His mother\nhad said \"thee\" to him, and that was quite enough to make even a dark\nday sunny. Hollanders do not address each other, in affectionate\nintercourse, as the French and Germans do. But Dame Brinker had\nembroidered for a Heidelberg family in her girlhood, and she had carried\nits \"thee\" and \"thou\" into her rude home, to be used in moments of\nextreme love and tenderness.\n\nTherefore, \"what keeps thee, Hans?\" sang an echo song beneath the boy's\nwhistling, and made him feel that his errand was blest.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nHANS HAS HIS WAY\n\n\nBroek, with its quiet, spotless streets, its frozen rivulets, its yellow\nbrick pavements, and bright wooden houses, was near by. It was a village\nwhere neatness and show were in full blossom; but the inhabitants seemed\nto be either asleep or dead.\n\nNot a footprint marred the sanded paths, where pebbles and sea-shells\nlay in fanciful designs. Every window-shutter was closed as tightly as\nthough air and sunshine were poison; and the massive front doors were\nnever opened except on the occasion of a wedding, christening, or a\nfuneral.\n\nSerene clouds of tobacco-smoke were floating through hidden apartments,\nand children, who otherwise might have awakened the place, were studying\nin out-of-the-way corners, or skating upon the neighboring canal. A few\npeacocks and wolves stood in the gardens, but they had never enjoyed the\nluxury of flesh and blood. They were cut out in growing box, and seemed\nguarding the grounds with a sort of green ferocity. Certain lively\nautomata, ducks, women and sportsmen, were stowed away in summer-houses,\nwaiting for the spring-time, when they could be wound up, and rival\ntheir owners in animation; and the shining, tiled roofs, mosaic\ncourtyards and polished house-trimmings flashed up a silent homage to\nthe sky, where never a speck of dust could dwell.\n\nHans glanced toward the village, as he shook his silver kwartjes, and\nwondered whether it were really true, as he had often heard, that some\nof the people of Broek were so rich that they used kitchen utensils of\nsolid gold.\n\nHe had seen Mevrouw van Stoop's sweet-cheeses in market, and he knew\nthat the lofty dame earned many a bright, silver guilder in selling\nthem. But did she set the cream to rise in golden pans? Did she use a\ngolden skimmer? When her cows were in winter quarters, were their tails\nreally tied up with ribbons?\n\nThese thoughts ran through his mind as he turned his face toward\nAmsterdam, not five miles away, on the other side of the frozen Y.[14]\nThe ice upon the canal was perfect; but his wooden runners, so soon to\nbe cast aside, squeaked a dismal farewell, as he scraped and skimmed\nalong.\n\n[Footnote 14: Pronounced Eye, an arm of the Zuider Zee.]\n\nWhen crossing the Y, whom should he see skating toward him but the great\nDr. Boekman, the most famous physician and surgeon in Holland. Hans had\nnever met him before, but he had seen his engraved likeness in many of\nthe shop-windows of Amsterdam. It was a face that one could never\nforget. Thin and lank, though a born Dutchman, with stern, blue eyes,\nand queer, compressed lips, that seemed to say \"no smiling permitted,\"\nhe certainly was not a very jolly or sociable looking personage, nor one\nthat a well-trained boy would care to accost unbidden.\n\nBut Hans _was_ bidden, and that, too, by a voice he seldom\ndisregarded--his own conscience.\n\n\"Here comes the greatest doctor in the world,\" whispered the voice. \"God\nhas sent him; you have no right to buy skates when you might, with the\nsame money, purchase such aid for your father!\"\n\nThe wooden runners gave an exultant squeak. Hundreds of beautiful skates\nwere gleaming and vanishing in the air above him. He felt the money\ntingle in his fingers. The old doctor looked fearfully grim and\nforbidding. Hans' heart was in his throat, but he found voice enough to\ncry out, just as he was passing:\n\n\"Mynheer Boekman!\"\n\nThe great man halted, and sticking out his thin under lip, looked\nscowlingly about him.\n\nHans was in for it now.\n\n\"Mynheer,\" he panted, drawing close to the fierce-looking doctor, \"I\nknew you could be none other than the famous Boekman. I have to ask a\ngreat favor----\"\n\n\"Humph!\" muttered the doctor, preparing to skate past the\nintruder,--\"Get out of the way--I've no money--never give to beggars.\"\n\n\"I am no beggar, Mynheer,\" retorted Hans proudly, at the same time\nproducing his mite of silver with a grand air. \"I wish to consult with\nyou about my father. He is a living man, but sits like one dead. He\ncannot think. His words mean nothing--but he is not sick. He fell on the\ndykes.\"\n\n\"Hey? what?\" cried the doctor beginning to listen.\n\nHans told the whole story in an incoherent way, dashing off a tear once\nor twice as he talked, and finally ending with an earnest,\n\n\"Oh, do see him, Mynheer. His body is well--it is only his mind--I know\nthis money is not enough; but take it, Mynheer, I will earn more--I know\nI will--Oh! I will toil for you all my life, if you will but cure my\nfather!\"\n\nWhat was the matter with the old doctor? A brightness like sunlight\nbeamed from his face. His eyes were kind and moist; the hand that had\nlately clutched his cane, as if preparing to strike, was laid gently\nupon Hans' shoulder.\n\n\"Put up your money, boy, I do not want it--we will see your father. It\nis a hopeless case, I fear. How long did you say?\"\n\n\"Ten years, Mynheer,\" sobbed Hans, radiant with sudden hope.\n\n\"Ah! a bad case; but I shall see him. Let me think. To-day I start for\nLeyden, to return in a week, then you may expect me. Where is it?\"\n\n\"A mile south of Broek, Mynheer, near the canal. It is only a poor,\nbroken-down hut. Any of the children thereabout can point it out to your\nhonor,\" added Hans, with a heavy sigh; \"they are all half afraid of the\nplace; they call it the idiot's cottage.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the doctor, hurrying on, with a bright backward nod\nat Hans, \"I shall be there. A hopeless case,\" he muttered to himself,\n\"but the boy pleases me. His eye is like my poor Laurens. Confound it,\nshall I never forget that young scoundrel!\" and, scowling more darkly\nthan ever, the doctor pursued his silent way.\n\nAgain Hans was skating toward Amsterdam on the squeaking wooden runners;\nagain his fingers tingled against the money in his pocket; again the\nboyish whistle rose unconsciously to his lips.\n\n\"Shall I hurry home,\" he was thinking, \"to tell the good news, or shall\nI get the waffles and the new skates first? Whew! I think I'll go on!\"\n\nAnd so Hans bought the skates.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nINTRODUCING JACOB POOT AND HIS COUSIN\n\n\nHans and Gretel had a fine frolic early on that Saint Nicholas' Eve.\nThere was a bright moon; and their mother, though she believed herself\nto be without any hope of her husband's improvement, had been made so\nhappy at the prospect of the meester's visit, that she had yielded to\nthe children's entreaties for an hour's skating before bedtime.\n\nHans was delighted with his new skates, and in his eagerness to show\nGretel how perfectly they \"worked\" did many things upon the ice, that\ncaused the little maid to clasp her hands in solemn admiration. They\nwere not alone, though they seemed quite unheeded by the various groups\nassembled upon the canal.\n\nThe two Van Holps, and Carl Schummel were there, testing their fleetness\nto the utmost. Out of four trials Peter van Holp had beaten three times.\nConsequently Carl, never very amiable, was in anything but a good humor.\nHe had relieved himself by taunting young Schimmelpenninck who, being\nsmaller than the others, kept meekly near them, without feeling exactly\nlike one of the party; but now a new thought seized Carl, or rather he\nseized the new thought and made an onset upon his friends.\n\n\"I say, boys, let's put a stop to those young rag-pickers from the\nidiot's cottage joining the race. Hilda must be crazy to think of it.\nKatrinka Flack and Rychie Korbes are furious at the very idea of racing\nwith the girl; and for my part, I don't blame them. As for the boy, if\nwe've a spark of manhood in us we will scorn the very idea of----\"\n\n\"Certainly we will!\" interposed Peter van Holp, purposely mistaking\nCarl's meaning, \"who doubts it? No fellow with a spark of manhood in him\nwould refuse to let in two good skaters just because they were poor!\"\n\nCarl wheeled about savagely:\n\n\"Not so fast, master! and I'd thank you not to put words in other\npeople's mouths. You'd best not try it again.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed little Voostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck, delighted at\nthe prospect of a fight, and sure that, if it should come to blows, his\nfavorite Peter could beat a dozen excitable fellows like Carl.\n\nSomething in Peter's eye made Carl glad to turn to a weaker offender. He\nwheeled furiously upon Voost.\n\n\"What are you shrieking about, you little weasel! You skinny herring\nyou, you little monkey with a long name for a tail!\"\n\nHalf a dozen bystanders and by-skaters set up an applauding shout at\nthis brave witticism; and Carl, feeling that he had fairly vanquished\nhis foes, was restored to partial good humor. He, however, prudently\nresolved to defer plotting against Hans and Gretel until some time when\nPeter should not be present.\n\nJust then, his friend, Jacob Poot, was seen approaching. They could not\ndistinguish his features at first; but as he was the stoutest boy in the\nneighborhood there could be no mistaking his form.\n\n\"Hola! here comes Fatty!\" exclaimed Carl, \"and there's some one with\nhim, a slender fellow, a stranger.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! that's like good bacon,\" cried Ludwig; \"a streak of lean and a\nstreak of fat.\"\n\n\"That's Jacob's English cousin,\" put in Master Voost, delighted at being\nable to give the information, \"that's his English cousin, and, oh! he's\ngot such a funny little name,--BEN DOBBS. He's going to stay with him\nuntil after the grand race.\"\n\nAll this time the boys had been spinning, turning, \"rolling\" and doing\nother feats upon their skates, in a quiet way, as they talked; but now\nthey stood still, bracing themselves against the frosty air as Jacob\nPoot and his friend drew near.\n\n\"This is my cousin, boys,\" said Jacob, rather out of breath--\"Benjamin\nDobbs. He's a John Bull and he's going to be in the race.\"\n\nAll crowded, boy-fashion, about the newcomers. Benjamin soon made up his\nmind that the Hollanders, notwithstanding their queer gibberish, were a\nfine set of fellows.\n\nIf the truth must be told, Jacob had announced his cousin as \"Penchamin\nDopps,\" and called him a \"Shon Pull,\" but as I translate every word of\nthe conversation of our young friends, it is no more than fair to mend\ntheir little attempts at English. Master Dobbs felt at first decidedly\nawkward among his cousin's friends. Though most of them had studied\nEnglish and French, they were shy about attempting to speak either, and\nhe made very funny blunders when he tried to converse in Dutch. He had\nlearned that _vrouw_ means wife, and _ja_, yes; and _spoorweg_, railway;\n_kanaals_, canals; _stoomboot_, steamboat; _ophaalbruggen_, drawbridges;\n_buiten plasten_, country seats; _mynheer_, \"mister;\" _tweegevegt_, duel\nor _two-fights_; _koper_, copper; _zadel_, saddle; but he could not\nmake a sentence out of these, nor use the long list of phrases he had\nlearned in his \"Dutch dialogues.\" The topics of the latter were fine,\nbut were never alluded to by the boys. Like the poor fellow who had\nlearned in Ollendorf to ask in faultless German \"have you seen my\ngrandmother's red cow?\" and when he reached Germany discovered that he\nhad no occasion to inquire after that interesting animal, Ben found that\nhis book-Dutch did not avail him as much as he had hoped. He acquired a\nhearty contempt for Jan van Gorp, a Hollander who wrote a book in Latin\nto prove that Adam and Eve spoke Dutch; and he smiled a knowing smile\nwhen his uncle Poot assured him that Dutch \"had great likeness mit\nZinglish but it vash much petter languish, much petter.\"\n\nHowever, the fun of skating glides over all barriers of speech. Through\nthis, Ben soon felt that he knew the boys well; and when Jacob (with a\nsprinkling of French and English for Ben's benefit) told of a grand\nproject they had planned, his cousin could now and then put in a \"ja,\"\nor a nod, in quite a familiar way.\n\nThe project _was_ a grand one, and there was to be a fine opportunity\nfor carrying it out; for, besides the allotted holiday of the Festival\nof Saint Nicholas, four extra days were to be allowed for a general\ncleaning of the schoolhouse.\n\nJacob and Ben had obtained permission to go on a long skating\njourney--no less a one than from Broek to the Hague, the capital of\nHolland, a distance of nearly fifty miles![15]\n\n[Footnote 15: Throughout this narrative distances are given according to\nour standard, the English statute mile of 5280 ft. The Dutch mile is\nmore than four times as long as ours.]\n\n\"And now, boys,\" added Jacob, when he had told the plan, \"who will go\nwith us?\"\n\n\"I will! I will!\" cried the boys eagerly.\n\n\"And so will I!\" ventured little Voostenwalbert.\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Jacob, holding his fat sides, and shaking his puffy\ncheeks, \"_you_ go? Such a little fellow as you? Why, youngster, you\nhaven't left off your pads yet!\"\n\nNow in Holland very young children wear a thin, padded cushion around\ntheir heads, surmounted with a framework of whalebone and ribbon, to\nprotect them in case of a fall; and it is the dividing line between\nbabyhood and childhood when they leave it off. Voost had arrived at this\ndignity several years before; consequently Jacob's insult was rather too\ngreat for endurance.\n\n\"Look out what you say!\" he squeaked. \"Lucky for you when you can leave\noff _your_ pads--you're padded all over!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" roared all the boys except Master Dobbs, who could not\nunderstand. \"Ha! ha!\"--and the good-natured Jacob laughed more than any.\n\n\"It ish my fat--yaw--he say I bees pad mit fat!\" he explained to Ben.\n\nSo a vote was passed unanimously in favor of allowing the now popular\nVoost to join the party, if his parents would consent.\n\n\"Good-night!\" sang out the happy youngster, skating homeward with all\nhis might.\n\n\"Good-night!\"\n\n\"We can stop at Haarlem, Jacob, and show your cousin the big organ,\"\nsaid Peter van Holp, eagerly, \"and at Leyden, too, where there's no end\nto the sights; and spend a day and night at the Hague, for my married\nsister, who lives there, will be delighted to see us; and the next\nmorning we can start for home.\"\n\n\"All right!\" responded Jacob, who was not much of a talker.\n\nLudwig had been regarding his brother with enthusiastic admiration.\n\n\"Hurrah for you, Pete! It takes you to make plans! Mother'll be as full\nof it as we are when we tell her we can take her love direct to sister\nVan Gend. My! but it's cold,\" he added, \"cold enough to take a fellow's\nhead off his shoulders. We'd better go home.\"\n\n\"What if it is cold, old Tender-skin?\" cried Carl, who was busily\npracticing a step which he called the \"double edge.\" \"Great skating we\nshould have by this time, if it was as warm as it was last December.\nDon't you know if it wasn't an extra cold winter, and an early one into\nthe bargain, we couldn't go?\"\n\n\"I know it's an extra cold night anyhow,\" said Ludwig. \"Whew! I'm going\nhome!\"\n\nPeter van Holp took out a bulgy gold watch, and holding it toward the\nmoonlight as well as his benumbed fingers would permit, called out:\n\n\"Hollo! it's nearly eight o'clock! Saint Nicholas is about by this time,\nand I, for one, want to see the little ones stare. Good-night!\"\n\n\"Good-night!\" cried one and all,--and off they started, shouting,\nsinging, and laughing as they flew along.\n\nWhere were Gretel and Hans?\n\nAh! how suddenly joy sometimes comes to an end!\n\nThey had skated about an hour, keeping aloof from the others--quite\ncontented with each other, and Gretel had exclaimed, \"Ah, Hans, how\nbeautiful! how fine! to think that we both have skates! I tell you the\nstork brought us good luck!\"--when they heard something!\n\nIt was a scream--a very faint scream! No one else upon the canal\nobserved it, but Hans knew its meaning too well. Gretel saw him turn\nwhite in the moonlight as he hastily tore off his skates.\n\n\"The father!\" he cried, \"he has frightened our mother!\" and Gretel ran\nafter him toward the house as rapidly as she could.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE FESTIVAL OF SAINT NICHOLAS\n\n\nWe all know how, before the Christmas tree began to flourish in the\nhome-life of our country, a certain \"right jolly old elf,\" with \"eight\ntiny reindeer,\" used to drive his sleigh-load of toys up to our\nhousetops, and then bound down the chimney to fill the stockings so\nhopefully hung by the fireplace. His friends called him Santa Claus, and\nthose who were most intimate ventured to say \"Old Nick.\" It was said\nthat he originally came from Holland. Doubtless he did; but, if so, he\ncertainly like many other foreigners changed his ways very much after\nlanding upon our shores. In Holland, Saint Nicholas is a veritable\nsaint, and often appears in full costume, with his embroidered robes,\nglittering with gems and gold, his mitre, his crozier and his jeweled\ngloves. _Here_ Santa Claus comes rollicking along, on the twenty-fifth\nof December, our holy Christmas morn. But in Holland, Saint Nicholas\nvisits earth on the fifth, a time especially appropriated to him. Early\non the morning of the sixth, he distributes his candies, toys and\ntreasures, then vanishes for a year.\n\nChristmas day is devoted by the Hollanders to church rites and pleasant\nfamily visiting. It is on Saint Nicholas' Eve that their young people\nbecome half wild with joy and expectation. To some of them it is a sorry\ntime, for the saint is very candid, and if any of them have been bad\nduring the past year, he is quite sure to tell them so. Sometimes he\ncarries a birch rod under his arm and advises the parents to give them\nscoldings in place of confections, and floggings instead of toys.\n\nIt was well that the boys hastened to their abodes on that bright winter\nevening, for in less than an hour afterward, the saint made his\nappearance in half the homes of Holland. He visited the king's palace\nand in the selfsame moment appeared in Annie Bouman's comfortable home.\nProbably one of our silver half dollars would have purchased all that\nhis saintship left at the peasant Bouman's; but a half-dollar's worth\nwill sometimes do for the poor what hundreds of dollars may fail to do\nfor the rich; it makes them happy and grateful, fills them with new\npeace and love.\n\nHilda van Gleck's little brothers and sisters were in a high state of\nexcitement that night. They had been admitted into the grand parlor;\nthey were dressed in their best, and had been given two cakes apiece at\nsupper. Hilda was as joyous as any. Why not? Saint Nicholas would never\ncross a girl of fourteen from his list, just because she was tall and\nlooked almost like a woman. On the contrary, he would probably exert\nhimself to do honor to such an august looking damsel. Who could tell? So\nshe sported and laughed and danced as gaily as the youngest, and was the\nsoul of all their merry games. Father, mother and grandmother looked on\napprovingly; so did grandfather, before he spread his large red\nhandkerchief over his face, leaving only the top of his skullcap\nvisible. This kerchief was his ensign of sleep.\n\nEarlier in the evening all had joined in the fun. In the general\nhilarity, there had seemed to be a difference only in bulk between\ngrandfather and the baby. Indeed a shade of solemn expectation now and\nthen flitting across the faces of the younger members, had made them\nseem rather more thoughtful than their elders.\n\nNow the spirit of fun reigned supreme. The very flames danced and\ncapered in the polished grate. A pair of prim candles that had been\nstaring at the Astral lamp began to wink at other candles far away in\nthe mirrors. There was a long bell-rope suspended from the ceiling in\nthe corner, made of glass beads netted over a cord nearly as thick as\nyour wrist. It generally hung in the shadow and made no sign; but\nto-night it twinkled from end to end. Its handle of crimson glass sent\nreckless dashes of red at the papered wall turning its dainty blue\nstripes into purple. Passers-by halted to catch the merry laughter\nfloating, through curtain and sash, into the street, then skipped on\ntheir way with a startled consciousness that the village was wide awake.\nAt last matters grew so uproarious that the grandsire's red kerchief\ncame down from his face with a jerk. What decent old gentleman could\nsleep in such a racket! Mynheer Van Gleck regarded his children with\nastonishment. The baby even showed symptoms of hysterics. It was high\ntime to attend to business. Madame suggested that if they wished to see\nthe good Saint Nicholas, they should sing the same loving invitation\nthat had brought him the year before.\n\nThe baby stared and thrust his fist into his mouth as Mynheer put him\ndown upon the floor. Soon he sat erect, and looked with a sweet scowl at\nthe company. With his lace and embroideries, and his crown of blue\nribbon and whalebone (for he was not quite past the tumbling age) he\nlooked like the king of the babies.\n\nThe other children, each holding a pretty willow basket, formed at once\nin a ring, and moved slowly around the little fellow, lifting their\neyes, meanwhile, for the saint to whom they were about to address\nthemselves was yet in mysterious quarters.\n\nMadame commenced playing softly upon the piano; soon the voices\nrose--gentle youthful voices--rendered all the sweeter for their tremor:\n\n     \"Welcome, friend! Saint Nicholas, welcome!\n       Bring no rod for us, to-night!\n     While our voices bid thee, welcome,\n       Every heart with joy is light!\n\n                 Tell us every fault and failing,\n                 We will bear thy keenest railing,\n                 So we sing--so we sing--\n                 Thou shalt tell us everything!\n\n     Welcome, friend! Saint Nicholas, welcome!\n       Welcome to this merry band!\n     Happy children greet thee, welcome!\n       Thou art glad'ning all the land!\n\n                 Fill each empty hand and basket,\n                 'Tis thy little ones who ask it,\n                 So we sing--so we sing--\n                 Thou wilt bring us everything!\"\n\nDuring the chorus, sundry glances, half in eagerness, half in dread, had\nbeen cast toward the polished folding doors. Now a loud knocking was\nheard. The circle was broken in an instant. Some of the little ones,\nwith a strange mixture of fear and delight, pressed against their\nmother's knee. Grandfather bent forward, with his chin resting upon his\nhand; grandmother lifted her spectacles; Mynheer van Gleck, seated by\nthe fireplace, slowly drew his meerschaum from his mouth, while Hilda\nand the other children settled themselves beside him in an expectant\ngroup.\n\nThe knocking was heard again.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Madame, softly.\n\nThe door slowly opened, and Saint Nicholas, in full array, stood before\nthem. You could have heard a pin drop!\n\nSoon he spoke. What a mysterious majesty in his voice! what kindliness\nin his tones!\n\n\"Karel van Gleck, I am pleased to greet thee, and thy honored vrouw\nKathrine, and thy son and his good vrouw Annie!\n\n\"Children, I greet ye all! Hendrick, Hilda, Broom, Katy, Huygens, and\nLucretia! And thy cousins, Wolfert, Diedrich, Mayken, Voost, and\nKatrina! Good children ye have been, in the main, since I last accosted\nye. Diedrich was rude at the Haarlem fair last Fall, but he has tried to\natone for it since. Mayken has failed of late in her lessons, and too\nmany sweets and trifles have gone to her lips, and too few stivers to\nher charity-box. Diedrich, I trust, will be a polite, manly boy for the\nfuture, and Mayken will endeavor to shine as a student. Let her\nremember, too, that economy and thrift are needed in the foundation of a\nworthy and generous life. Little Katy has been cruel to the cat more\nthan once. Saint Nicholas can hear the cat cry when its tail is pulled.\nI will forgive her if she will remember from this hour that the smallest\ndumb creatures have feeling and must not be abused.\"\n\nAs Katy burst into a frightened cry, the saint graciously remained\nsilent until she was soothed.\n\n\"Master Broom,\" he resumed, \"I warn thee that boys who are in the habit\nof putting snuff upon the foot-stove of the school mistress may one day\nbe discovered and receive a flogging----\"\n\n[Illustration: _The door slowly opened_]\n\n[Master Broom colored and stared in great astonishment.]\n\n\"But thou art such an excellent scholar, I shall make thee no further\nreproof.\n\n\"Thou, Hendrick, didst distinguish thyself in the archery match last\nSpring, and hit the Doel[16], though the bird was swung before it to\nunsteady thine eye. I give thee credit for excelling in manly sport and\nexercise--though I must not unduly countenance thy boat-racing since it\nleaves thee too little time for thy proper studies.\n\n[Footnote 16: Bull's-Eye.]\n\n\"Lucretia and Hilda shall have a blessed sleep to-night. The\nconsciousness of kindness to the poor, devotion in their souls, and\ncheerful, hearty obedience to household rule will render them happy.\n\n\"With one and all I avow myself well content. Goodness, industry,\nbenevolence and thrift have prevailed in your midst. Therefore, my\nblessing upon you--and may the New Year find all treading the paths of\nobedience, wisdom and love. To-morrow you shall find more substantial\nproofs that I have been in your midst. Farewell!\"\n\nWith these words came a great shower of sugar-plums, upon a linen sheet\nspread out in front of the doors. A general scramble followed. The\nchildren fairly tumbled over each other in their eagerness to fill their\nbaskets. Madame cautiously held the baby down in their midst, till the\nchubby little fists were filled. Then the bravest of the youngsters\nsprang up and burst open the closed doors--in vain they peered into the\nmysterious apartment--Saint Nicholas was nowhere to be seen.\n\nSoon there was a general rush to another room, where stood a table,\ncovered with the finest and whitest of linen damask. Each child, in a\nflutter of excitement, laid a shoe upon it. The door was then carefully\nlocked, and its key hidden in the mother's bedroom. Next followed\ngood-night kisses, a grand family-procession to the upper floor, merry\nfarewells at bedroom doors--and silence, at last, reigned in the Van\nGleck mansion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly the next morning, the door was solemnly unlocked and opened in the\npresence of the assembled household, when lo! a sight appeared proving\nSaint Nicholas to be a saint of his word!\n\nEvery shoe was filled to overflowing, and beside each stood many a\ncolored pile. The table was heavy with its load of presents--candies,\ntoys, trinkets, books and other articles. Every one had gifts, from\ngrandfather down to the baby.\n\nLittle Katy clapped her hands with glee, and vowed, inwardly, that the\ncat should never know another moment's grief.\n\nHendrick capered about the room, flourishing a superb bow and arrows\nover his head. Hilda laughed with delight as she opened a crimson box\nand drew forth its glittering contents. The rest chuckled and said \"Oh!\"\nand \"Ah!\" over their treasures, very much as we did here in America on\nlast Christmas day.\n\nWith her glittering necklace in her hands, and a pile of books in her\narms, Hilda stole toward her parents and held up her beaming face for a\nkiss. There was such an earnest, tender look in her bright eyes that her\nmother breathed a blessing as she leaned over her.\n\n\"I am delighted with this book, thank you, father,\" she said, touching\nthe top one with her chin. \"I shall read it all day long.\"\n\n\"Aye, sweetheart,\" said Mynheer, \"you cannot do better. There is no one\nlike Father Cats. If my daughter learns his 'MORAL EMBLEMS' by heart,\nthe mother and I may keep silent. The work you have there is the\nEmblems--his best work. You will find it enriched with rare engravings\nfrom Van de Venne.\"\n\n[Considering that the back of the book was turned away, Mynheer\ncertainly showed a surprising familiarity with an unopened volume,\npresented by Saint Nicholas. It was strange, too, that the saint should\nhave found certain things made by the elder children, and had actually\nplaced them upon the table, labeled with parents' and grandparents'\nnames. But all were too much absorbed in happiness to notice slight\ninconsistencies. Hilda saw, on her father's face, the rapt expression he\nalways wore when he spoke of Jacob Cats, so she put her armful of books\nupon the table and resigned herself to listen.]\n\n\"Old Father Cats, my child, was a great poet, not a writer of plays like\nthe Englishman, Shakespeare, who lived in his time. I have read them in\nthe German and very good they are--very, very good--but not like Father\nCats. Cats sees no daggers in the air; he has no white women falling in\nlove with dusky Moors; no young fools sighing to be a lady's glove; no\ncrazy princes mistaking respectable old gentlemen for rats. No, no. He\nwrites only sense. It is great wisdom in little bundles, a bundle for\nevery day of your life. You can guide a state with Cats' poems, and you\ncan put a little baby to sleep with his pretty songs. He was one of the\ngreatest men of Holland. When I take you to the Hague I will show you\nthe Kloosterkerk where he lies buried. _There_ was a man for you to\nstudy, my sons! he was good through and through. What did he say?\n\n     \"'Oh, Lord, let me obtain this from Thee\n     To live with patience, and to die with pleasure!'[17]\n\n[Footnote 17:\n\n     O Heere! laat my dat van uwen hand verwerven,\n     Te leven met gedult, en met vermaak te sterven.]\n\n\"Did patience mean folding his hands? No, he was a lawyer, statesman,\nambassador, farmer, philosopher, historian, and poet. He was keeper of\nthe Great Seal of Holland! He was a--Bah! there is too much noise here,\nI cannot talk\"--and Mynheer, looking with astonishment into the bowl of\nhis meerschaum--for it had \"gone out\"--nodded to his vrouw and left the\napartment in great haste.\n\nThe fact is, his discourse had been accompanied throughout with a\nsubdued chorus of barking dogs, squeaking cats and bleating lambs, to\nsay nothing of a noisy ivory cricket, that the baby was whirling with\ninfinite delight. At the last, little Huygens taking advantage of the\nincreasing loudness of Mynheer's tones, had ventured a blast on his new\ntrumpet, and Wolfert had hastily attempted an accompaniment on the drum.\nThis had brought matters to a crisis, and well for the little creatures\nthat it had. The saint had left no ticket for them to attend a lecture\non Jacob Cats. It was not an appointed part of the ceremonies. Therefore\nwhen the youngsters saw that the mother looked neither frightened nor\noffended, they gathered new courage. The grand chorus rose triumphant,\nand frolic and joy reigned supreme.\n\nGood Saint Nicholas! For the sake of the young Hollanders, I, for one,\nam willing to acknowledge him, and defend his reality against all\nunbelievers.\n\nCarl Schummel was quite busy during that day, assuring little children,\nconfidentially, that not Saint Nicholas, but their own fathers and\nmothers had produced the oracle and loaded the tables. But _we_ know\nbetter than that.\n\nAnd yet if this were a saint, why did he not visit the Brinker cottage\nthat night? Why was that one home, so dark and sorrowful, passed by?\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nWHAT THE BOYS SAW AND DID IN AMSTERDAM\n\n\n\"Are we all here?\" cried Peter, in high glee, as the party assembled\nupon the canal early the next morning, equipped for their skating\njourney. \"Let me see. As Jacob has made me captain, I must call the\nroll. Carl Schummel----You here?\"\n\n\"Ya!\"\n\n\"Jacob Poot!\"\n\n\"Ya!\"\n\n\"Benjamin Dobbs!\"\n\n\"Ya-a!\"\n\n\"Lambert van Mounen!\"\n\n\"Ya!\"\n\n\"[That's lucky! Couldn't get on without _you_, as you're the only one\nwho can speak English.] Ludwig van Holp!\"\n\n\"Ya!\"\n\n\"Voostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Ah! the little rogue has been kept at home. Now, boys, it's just eight\no'clock--glorious weather, and the Y is as firm as a rock--we'll be at\nAmsterdam in thirty minutes. One, Two, Three, START!\"\n\nTrue enough, in less than half an hour they had crossed a dyke of solid\nmasonry, and were in the very heart of the great metropolis of the\nNetherlands--a walled city of ninety-five islands and nearly two hundred\nbridges. Although Ben had been there twice since his arrival in Holland,\nhe saw much to excite wonder; but his Dutch comrades, having lived near\nby all their lives, considered it the most matter-of-course place in the\nworld. Everything interested Ben; the tall houses with their forked\nchimneys and gable ends facing the street; the merchants' warerooms,\nperched high up under the roofs of their dwellings, with long, arm-like\ncranes hoisting and lowering goods past the household windows; the grand\npublic buildings erected upon wooden piles driven deep into the marshy\nground; the narrow streets; the canals everywhere crossing the city; the\nbridges; the locks; the various costumes, and, strangest of all, shops\nand dwellings crouching close to the fronts of the churches, sending\ntheir long, disproportionate chimneys far upward along the sacred walls.\n\nIf he looked up, he saw tall, leaning houses, seeming to pierce the sky\nwith their shining roofs; if he looked down, there was the queer street,\nwithout crossing or curb--nothing to separate the cobblestone pavement\nfrom the foot-path of brick--and if he rested his eyes half-way, he saw\ncomplicated little mirrors [_spionnen_] fastened upon the outside of\nnearly every window, so arranged that the inmates of the houses could\nobserve all that was going on in the street, or inspect whoever might be\nknocking at the door, without being seen themselves.\n\nSometimes a dog-cart, heaped with wooden ware, passed him; then a donkey\nbearing a pair of panniers filled with crockery or glass; then a sled\ndriven over the bare cobblestones (the runners kept greased with a\ndripping oil rag so that it might run easily); and then, perhaps, a\nshowy, but clumsy family-carriage, drawn by the brownest of Flanders\nhorses, swinging the whitest of snowy tails.\n\nThe city was in full festival array. Every shop was gorgeous in honor of\nSaint Nicholas. Captain Peter was forced, more than once, to order his\nmen away from the tempting show-windows, where everything that is, has\nbeen, or can be thought of in the way of toys was displayed. Holland is\nfamous for this branch of manufacture. Every possible thing is copied in\nminiature for the benefit of the little ones; the intricate mechanical\ntoys that a Dutch youngster tumbles about in stolid unconcern would\ncreate a stir in our Patent Office. Ben laughed outright at some of the\nmimic fishing boats. They were so heavy and stumpy, so like the queer\ncraft that he had seen about Rotterdam. The tiny trekschuiten, however,\nonly a foot or two long, and fitted out, complete, made his heart\nache--he so longed to buy one at once for his little brother in England.\nHe had no money to spare, for with true Dutch prudence, the party had\nagreed to take with them merely the sum required for each boy's\nexpenses, and to consign the purse to Peter for safekeeping.\nConsequently Master Ben concluded to devote all his energies to\nsightseeing, and to think as seldom as possible of little Robby.\n\nHe made a hasty call at the Marine school and envied the sailor students\ntheir full-rigged brig and their sleeping-berths swung over their trunks\nor lockers; he peeped into the Jews' Quarter of the city, where the rich\ndiamond cutters and squalid old-clothes men dwell, and wisely resolved\nto keep away from it; he also enjoyed hasty glimpses of the four\nprincipal avenues of Amsterdam--the Prinsen gracht, Keizers gracht,\nHeeren gracht and Singel. These are semicircular in form, and the first\nthree average more than two miles in length. A canal runs through the\ncentre of each, with a well-paved road on either side, lined with\nstately buildings. Rows of naked elms, bordering the canal, cast a\nnetwork of shadows over its frozen surface; and everything was so clean\nand bright that Ben told Lambert it seemed to him like petrified\nneatness.\n\nFortunately the weather was cold enough to put a stop to the usual\nstreet-flooding, and window-washing, or our young excursionists might\nhave been drenched more than once. Sweeping, mopping and scrubbing form\na passion with Dutch housewives, and to soil their spotless mansions is\nconsidered scarcely less than a crime. Everywhere a hearty contempt is\nfelt for those who neglect to rub the soles of their shoes to a polish\nbefore crossing the door-sill; and, in certain places, visitors are\nexpected to remove their heavy shoes before entering.\n\nSir William Temple, in his Memoirs of \"What passed in Christendom from\n1672 to 1679,\" tells a story of a pompous magistrate going to visit a\nlady of Amsterdam. A stout Holland lass opened the door, and told him in\na breath that the lady was at home and that his shoes were not very\nclean. Without another word, she took the astonished man up by both\narms, threw him across her back, carried him through two rooms, set him\ndown at the bottom of the stairs, seized a pair of slippers that stood\nthere and put them upon his feet. Then, and not until then, she spoke,\ntelling him that her mistress was on the floor above, and that he might\ngo up.\n\nWhile Ben was skating, with his friends, upon the crowded canals of the\ncity, he found it difficult to believe that the sleepy Dutchmen he saw\naround him, smoking their pipes so leisurely, and looking as though\ntheir hats might be knocked off their heads without their making any\nresistance, were capable of those outbreaks that had taken place in\nHolland--that they were really fellow-countrymen of the brave, devoted\nheroes of whom he had read in Dutch history.\n\nAs his party skimmed lightly along he told Van Mounen of a burial-riot\nwhich in 1696 had occurred in that very city, where the women and\nchildren turned out, as well as the men, and formed mock funeral\nprocessions through the town, to show the burgomasters that certain new\nregulations, with regard to burying the dead, would not be acceded\nto--how at last they grew so unmanageable, and threatened so much damage\nto the city that the burgomasters were glad to recall the offensive law.\n\n\"There's the corner,\" said Jacob, pointing to some large buildings,\n\"where, about fifteen years ago, the great corn-houses sank down in the\nmud. They were strong affairs, and set up on good piles, but they had\nover seventy thousand hundred-weight of corn in them; and that was too\nmuch.\"\n\nIt was a long story for Jacob to tell and he stopped to rest.\n\n\"How do you know there were seventy thousand hundred-weight in them?\"\nasked Carl sharply--\"you were in your swaddling clothes then.\"\n\n\"My father knows all about it,\" was Jacob's suggestive reply. Rousing\nhimself with an effort, he continued--\"Ben likes pictures. Show him\nsome.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the captain.\n\n\"If we had time, Benjamin,\" said Lambert van Mounen in English, \"I\nshould like to take you to the City Hall or _Stadhuis_. There are\nbuilding-piles for you! It is built on nearly fourteen thousand of\nthem, driven seventy feet into the ground. But what I wish you to see\nthere is the big picture of Van Speyk blowing up his ship--great\npicture.\"\n\n\"Van _who_?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Van Speyk. Don't you remember? He was in the height of an engagement\nwith the Belgians, and when he found that they had the better of him and\nwould capture his ship, he blew it up, and himself too, rather than\nyield to the enemy.\"\n\n\"Wasn't that Van Tromp?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Van Tromp was another brave fellow. They've a monument to him\ndown at Delft Haven--the place where the Pilgrims took ship for\nAmerica.\"\n\n\"Well, what about Van Tromp? He was a great Dutch Admiral; wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was in more than thirty sea-fights. He beat the Spanish fleet\nand an English one, and then fastened a broom to his masthead to show\nthat he had swept the English from the sea. Takes the Dutch to beat, my\nboy!\"\n\n\"Hold up!\" cried Ben, \"broom or no broom, the English conquered him at\nlast. I remember all about it now. He was killed somewhere on the Dutch\ncoast, in an engagement in which the British fleet was victorious. Too\nbad,\" he added maliciously, \"wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Ahem! where are we?\" exclaimed Lambert changing the subject. \"Hollo!\nthe others are way ahead of us--all but Jacob. Whew! how fat he is!\nHe'll break down before we're half-way.\"\n\nBen of course enjoyed skating beside Lambert, who though a staunch\nHollander, had been educated near London, and could speak English as\nfluently as Dutch; but he was not sorry when Captain van Holp called\nout:\n\n\"Skates off! There's the Museum!\"\n\nIt was open, and there was no charge on that day for admission. In they\nwent, shuffling, as boys will, when they have a chance, just to hear the\nsound of their shoes on the polished floor.\n\nThis Museum is in fact a picture gallery where some of the finest works\nof the Dutch masters are to be seen, beside nearly two hundred\nportfolios of rare engravings.\n\nBen noticed, at once, that some of the pictures were hung on panels\nfastened to the wall with hinges. These could be swung forward like a\nwindow-shutter, thus enabling the subject to be seen in the best light.\nThe plan served them well in viewing a small group by Gerard Douw,\ncalled the \"Evening School,\" enabling them to observe its exquisite\nfinish and the wonderful way in which the picture seemed to be lit\nthrough its own windows. Peter pointed out the beauties of another\npicture by Douw, called \"The Hermit,\" and he also told them some\ninteresting anecdotes of the artist, who was born at Leyden in 1613.\n\n\"Three days painting a broom handle!\" echoed Carl in astonishment, while\nthe captain was giving some instances of Douw's extreme slowness of\nexecution.\n\n\"Yes, sir; three days. And it is said that he spent five in finishing\none hand in a lady's portrait. You see how very bright and minute\neverything is in this picture. His unfinished works were kept carefully\ncovered, and his painting materials were put away in airtight boxes as\nsoon as he had finished using them for the day. According to all\naccounts, the studio itself must have been as close as a band-box. The\nartist always entered it on tiptoe, besides sitting still, before he\ncommenced work, until the slight dust caused by his entrance had\nsettled. I have read somewhere that his paintings are improved by being\nviewed through a magnifying glass. He strained his eyes so badly with\nthis extra finishing, that he was forced to wear spectacles before he\nwas thirty. At forty he could scarcely see to paint, and he couldn't\nfind a pair of glasses anywhere that would help his sight. At last, a\npoor old German woman asked him to try hers. They suited him exactly,\nand enabled him to go on painting as well as ever.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" exclaimed Ludwig, indignantly, \"that was high! What did _she_\ndo without them, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Peter, laughing, \"likely she had another pair. At any rate\nshe insisted upon his taking them. He was so grateful that he painted a\npicture of the spectacles for her, case and all, and she sold it to a\nburgomaster for a yearly allowance that made her comfortable for the\nrest of her days.\"\n\n\"Boys!\" called Lambert, in a loud whisper, \"come look at this Bear\nHunt.\"\n\nIt was a fine painting by Paul Potter, a Dutch artist of the seventeenth\ncentury, who produced excellent works before he was sixteen years old.\nThe boys admired it because the subject pleased them. They passed\ncarelessly by the masterpieces of Rembrandt and Van der Helst, and went\ninto raptures over an ugly picture by Van der Venne, representing a\nsea-fight between the Dutch and English. They also stood spellbound\nbefore a painting of two little urchins, one of whom was taking soup and\nthe other eating an egg. The principal merit in this work was that the\nyoung egg-eater had kindly slobbered his face with the yolk for their\nentertainment.\n\nAn excellent representation of the \"Feast of Saint Nicholas\" next had\nthe honor of attracting them.\n\n\"Look, Van Mounen,\" said Ben to Lambert, \"could anything be better than\nthis youngster's face? He looks as if he _knows_ he deserves a whipping\nbut hopes Saint Nicholas may not have found him out. That's the kind of\npainting _I_ like; something that tells a story.\"\n\n\"Come, boys!\" cried the captain, \"ten o'clock, time we were off!\"\n\nThey hastened to the canal.\n\n\"Skates on! Are you ready? ONE, TWO--hollo! where's Poot?\"\n\nSure enough where _was_ Poot?\n\nA square opening had just been cut in the ice not ten yards off. Peter\nobserved it, and without a word skated rapidly toward it.\n\nAll the others followed, of course.\n\nPeter looked in. They all looked in; then stared anxiously at each\nother.\n\n\"Poot!\" screamed Peter, peering into the hole again. All was still. The\nblack water gave no sign; it was already glazing on top.\n\nVan Mounen turned mysteriously to Ben.\n\n\"_Didn't he have a fit once?_\"\n\n\"My goodness! yes!\" answered Ben, in a great fright.\n\n\"Then, depend upon it, he's been taken with one in the Museum!\"\n\nThe boys caught his meaning. Every skate was off in a twinkling. Peter\nhad the presence of mind to scoop up a cap-full of water from the hole,\nand off they scampered to the rescue.\n\nAlas! They did indeed find poor Jacob in a fit--but it was a fit of\nsleepiness. There he lay in a recess of the gallery, snoring like a\ntrooper! The chorus of laughter that followed this discovery brought an\nangry official to the spot.\n\n\"What now! None of this racket! Here, you beer-barrel, wake up!\" and\nMaster Jacob received a very unceremonious shaking.\n\nAs soon as Peter saw that Jacob's condition was not serious, he hastened\nto the street to empty his unfortunate cap. While he was stuffing his\nhandkerchief to prevent the already frozen crown from touching his head,\nthe rest of the boys came down, dragging the bewildered and indignant\nJacob in their midst.\n\nThe order to start was again given. Master Poot was wide awake at last.\nThe ice was a little rough and broken just there, but every boy was in\nhigh spirits.\n\n\"Shall we go on by the canal or the river?\" asked Peter.\n\n\"Oh, the river, by all means,\" said Carl. \"It will be such fun; they say\nit is perfect skating all the way, but it's much farther.\"\n\nJacob Poot instantly became interested.\n\n\"_I_ vote for the canal!\" he cried.\n\n\"Well, the canal it shall be,\" responded the captain, \"if all are\nagreed.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" they echoed, in rather a disappointed tone--and Captain Peter\nled the way.\n\n\"All right--come on--we can reach Haarlem in an hour!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nBIG MANIAS AND LITTLE ODDITIES\n\n\nWhile skating along at full speed, they heard the cars from Amsterdam\ncoming close behind them.\n\n\"Hollo!\" cried Ludwig, glancing toward the rail-track--\"who can't beat a\nlocomotive? Let's give it a race!\"\n\nThe whistle screamed at the very idea--so did the boys--and at it they\nwent.\n\nFor an instant the boys were ahead, hurrahing with all their might--only\nfor an instant, but even _that_ was something.\n\nThis excitement over, they began to travel more leisurely, and indulge\nin conversation and frolic. Sometimes they stopped to exchange a word\nwith the guards who were stationed at certain distances along the canal.\nThese men, in Winter, attend to keeping the surface free from\nobstruction and garbage. After a snow-storm they are expected to sweep\nthe feathery covering away before it hardens into a marble pretty to\nlook at but very unwelcome to skaters. Now and then the boys so far\nforgot their dignity as to clamber among the ice-bound canal-boats\ncrowded together in a widened harbor off the canal, but the watchful\nguards would soon spy them out and order them down with a growl.\n\nNothing could be straighter than the canal upon which our party were\nskating, and nothing straighter than the long rows of willow trees that\nstood, bare and wispy, along the bank. On the opposite side, lifted high\nabove the surrounding country, lay the carriage road on top of the\ngreat dyke built to keep the Haarlem Lake within bounds; stretching out\nfar in the distance until it became lost in a point, was the glassy\ncanal with its many skaters, its brown-winged ice-boats, its push-chairs\nand its queer little sleds, light as cork, flying over the ice by means\nof iron-pronged sticks in the hands of the riders. Ben was in ecstasy\nwith the scene.\n\nLudwig van Holp had been thinking how strange it was that the English\nboy should know so much of Holland. According to Lambert's account he\nknew more about it than the Dutch did. This did not quite please our\nyoung Hollander. Suddenly he thought of something that he believed would\nmake the \"Shon Pull\" open his eyes; he drew near Lambert with a\ntriumphant:\n\n\"Tell him about the tulips!\"\n\nBen caught the word \"_tulpen_.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said he eagerly, in English, \"the Tulip Mania--are you\nspeaking of that? I have often heard it mentioned, but know very little\nabout it. It reached its height in Amsterdam, didn't it?\"\n\nLudwig moaned; the words were hard to understand, but there was no\nmistaking the enlightened expression on Ben's face; Lambert, happily,\nwas quite unconscious of his young countryman's distress as he replied:\n\n\"Yes, here and in Haarlem, principally; but the excitement ran high all\nover Holland, and in England too for that matter.\"\n\n\"Hardly in England,[18] I think,\" said Ben, \"but I am not sure, as I was\nnot there at the time.\"\n\n[Footnote 18: Although the Tulip Mania did not prevail in England as in\nHolland, the flower soon became an object of speculation and brought\nvery large prices. In 1636, Tulips were publicly sold on the Exchange of\nLondon. Even as late as 1800, a common price was fifteen guineas for one\nbulb. Ben did not know that in his own day a single Tulip plant, called\nthe \"Fanny Kemble\" had been sold in London for more than 70 guineas.\n\nMr. Mackay in his \"Memoirs of Popular Delusions\" tells a funny story of\nan English botanist who happened to see a tulip bulb lying in the\nconservatory of a wealthy Dutchman. Ignorant of its value, he took out\nhis penknife and, cutting the bulb in two, became very much interested\nin his investigations. Suddenly the owner appeared, and pouncing\nfuriously upon him, asked him if he knew what he was doing. \"Peeling a\nmost extraordinary onion,\" replied the philosopher. \"Hundert tousant\ntuyvel!\" shouted the Dutchman, \"it's an Admiral Vander Eyk!\" \"Thank\nyou,\" replied the traveler, immediately writing the name in his note\nbook; \"pray are these very common in your country?\" \"Death and the\ntuyvel!\" screamed the Dutchman, \"come before the Syndic and you shall\nsee!\" In spite of his struggles the poor investigator, followed by an\nindignant mob, was taken through the streets to a magistrate. Soon he\nlearned to his dismay that he had destroyed a bulb worth 4,000 florins\n($1,600). He was lodged in prison until securities could be procured for\nthe payment of the sum.]\n\n\"Ha! ha! that's true, unless you are over two hundred years old. Well, I\ntell you, sir, there was never anything like it before nor since. Why,\npersons were so crazy after tulip bulbs in those days, that they paid\ntheir weight in gold for them.\"\n\n\"What, the weight of a man?\" cried Ben, showing such astonishment in his\neyes, that Ludwig fairly capered.\n\n\"No, no, the weight of a _bulb_. The first tulip was sent here from\nConstantinople about the year 1560. It was so much admired that the rich\npeople of Amsterdam sent to Turkey for more. From that time they grew to\nbe the rage, and it lasted for years. Single roots brought from one to\nfour thousand florins; and one bulb, the Semper Augustus, brought\nfifty-five hundred.\"\n\n\"That's more than four hundred guineas of our money,\" interposed Ben.\n\n\"Yes, and I know I'm right, for I read it in a translation from\nBeckman, only day before yesterday. Well, sir, it was great. Every one\nspeculated in Tulips, even the barge-men and rag-women, and\nchimney-sweeps. The richest merchants were not ashamed to share the\nexcitement. People bought bulbs and sold them again at a tremendous\nprofit without ever seeing them. It grew into a kind of gambling. Some\nbecame rich by it in a few days, and some lost everything they had.\nLand, houses, cattle and even clothing went for Tulips when people had\nno ready money. Ladies sold their jewels and finery to enable them to\njoin in the fun. Nothing else was thought of. At last the States-general\ninterfered. People began to see what geese they were making of\nthemselves, and down went the price of Tulips. Old tulip debts couldn't\nbe collected. Creditors went to law, and the law turned its back upon\nthem; debts made in gambling were not binding, it said. Then, there was\na time! Thousands of rich speculators reduced to beggary in an hour. As\nold Beckman says, 'the bubble was burst at last.'\"\n\n\"Yes, and a big bubble it was,\" said Ben, who had listened with great\ninterest. \"By the way, did you know that the name Tulip came from a\nTurkish word, signifying turban?\"\n\n\"I had forgotten that,\" answered Lambert, \"but it's a capital idea. Just\nfancy a party of Turks in full head-gear, squatted upon a lawn--perfect\ntulip bed! Ha! ha! capital idea!\"\n\n[\"There,\" groaned Ludwig to himself, \"he's been telling Lambert\nsomething wonderful about Tulips--I knew it!\"]\n\n\"The fact is,\" continued Lambert, \"you can conjure up quite a human\npicture out of a tulip bed in bloom, especially when it is nodding and\nbobbing in the wind. Did you ever notice it?\"\n\n\"Not I. It strikes me, Van Mounen, that you Hollanders are prodigiously\nfond of the flower to this day.\"\n\n\"Certainly. You can't have a garden without them, prettiest flower that\ngrows, _I_ think. My uncle has a magnificent bed of the finest varieties\nat his summer-house on the other side of Amsterdam.\"\n\n\"I thought your uncle lived in the city?\"\n\n\"So he does; but his summer-house, or pavilion, is a few miles off. He\nhas another one built out over the river. We passed near it when we\nentered the city. Everybody in Amsterdam has a pavilion somewhere, if he\ncan.\"\n\n\"Do they ever live there?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Bless you, no! They are small affairs, suitable only to spend a few\nhours in on Summer afternoons. There are some beautiful ones on the\nsouthern end of the Haarlem Lake--now that they've commenced to drain it\ninto polders, it will spoil _that_ fun. By the way, we've passed some\nred-roofed ones since we left home. You noticed them I suppose with\ntheir little bridges, and ponds and gardens, and their mottoes over the\ndoor-way.\"\n\nBen nodded.\n\n\"They make but little show, now,\" continued Lambert, \"but in warm\nweather they are delightful. After the willows sprout, uncle goes to his\nsummer-house every afternoon. He dozes and smokes; aunt knits, with her\nfeet perched upon a foot-stove, never mind how hot the day; my cousin\nRika and the other girls fish in the lake from the windows, or chat with\ntheir friends rowing by; and the youngsters tumble about, or hang upon\nthe little bridges over the ditch. Then they have coffee and cakes;\nbesides a great bunch of water-lilies on the table--it's very fine, I\ncan tell you; only (between ourselves) though I was born here, I shall\nnever fancy the odor of stagnant water that hangs about most of the\nsummer-houses. Nearly every one you see is built over a ditch. Probably\nI feel it more, from having lived so long in England.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall notice it, too,\" said Ben, \"if a thaw comes. This early\nwinter has covered up the fragrant waters for my benefit--much obliged\nto it. Holland without this glorious skating wouldn't be the same thing\nto me at all.\"\n\n\"How very different you are from the Poots!\" exclaimed Lambert, who had\nbeen listening in a sort of brown study, \"and yet you are cousins--I\ncannot understand it.\"\n\n\"We _are_ cousins, or rather we have always considered ourselves such,\nbut the relationship is not very close. Our grandmothers were\nhalf-sisters. _My_ side of the family is entirely English, while his is\nentirely Dutch. Old Great-grandfather Poot married twice, you see, and I\nam a descendant of his English wife. I like Jacob, though, better than\nhalf of my English cousins put together. He is the truest-hearted,\nbest-natured boy I ever knew. Strange as you may think it, my father\nbecame accidentally acquainted with Jacob's father while on a business\nvisit to Rotterdam. They soon talked over their relationship--in French,\nby the way--and they have corresponded in that language ever since.\nQueer things come about in this world. My sister Jenny would open her\neyes at some of Aunt Poot's ways. Aunt is a thorough lady, but so\ndifferent from mother--and the house, too, and furniture, and way of\nliving, everything is different.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" assented Lambert, complacently, as if to say, \"you could\nscarcely expect such general perfection anywhere else than in Holland,\"\n\"but you will have all the more to tell Jenny when you go back.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I can say one thing--if cleanliness is, as they claim,\nnext to godliness, Broek is safe. It is the cleanest place I ever saw in\nmy life. Why, my Aunt Poot, rich as she is, scrubs half the time, and\nher house looks as if it were varnished all over. I wrote to mother\nyesterday that I could see my double always with me, feet to feet, in\nthe polished floor of the dining-room.\"\n\n\"Your _double_! that word puzzles me; what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, my reflection, my apparition. Ben Dobbs number two.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" exclaimed Van Mounen. \"Have you ever been in your Aunt\nPoot's grand parlor?\"\n\nBen laughed. \"Only once, and that was on the day of my arrival. Jacob\nsays I shall have no chance of entering it again until the time of his\nsister Kenau's wedding, the week after Christmas. Father has consented\nthat I shall remain to witness the great event. Every Saturday Aunt\nPoot, and her fat Kate, go into that parlor and sweep, and polish, and\nscrub; then it is darkened and closed until Saturday comes again; not a\nsoul enters it in the meantime; but the _schoonmaken_, as she calls it,\nmust be done, just the same.\"\n\n\"That is nothing. Every parlor in Broek meets with the same treatment,\"\nsaid Lambert. \"What do you think of these moving figures in her\nneighbor's garden?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're well enough; the swans must seem really alive gliding about\nthe pond in summer; but that nodding Mandarin in the corner, under the\nchestnut trees, is ridiculous, only fit for children to laugh at. And\nthen the stiff garden patches, and the trees all trimmed and painted.\nExcuse me, Van Mounen, but I shall never learn to admire Dutch taste.\"\n\n\"It will take time,\" answered Lambert, condescendingly, \"but you are\nsure to agree with it at last. I saw much to admire in England, and I\nhope I shall be sent back with you, to study at Oxford; but take\neverything together, I like Holland best.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" said Ben, in a tone of hearty approval, \"you\nwouldn't be a good Hollander if you didn't. Nothing like loving one's\ncountry. It is strange, though, to have such a warm feeling for such a\ncold place. If we were not exercising all the time we should freeze\noutright.\"\n\nLambert laughed.\n\n\"That's your English blood, Benjamin. _I'm_ not cold. And look at the\nskaters here on the canal--they're red as roses, and happy as lords.\nHallo! good Captain van Holp,\" called out Lambert in Dutch, \"what say\nyou to stopping at yonder farmhouse and warming our toes?\"\n\n\"Who is cold?\" asked Peter, turning around.\n\n\"Benjamin Dobbs.\"\n\n\"Benjamin Dobbs shall be warmed,\" and the party was brought to a halt.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nON THE WAY TO HAARLEM\n\n\nOn approaching the door of the farmhouse the boys suddenly found\nthemselves in the midst of a lively domestic scene. A burly Dutchman\ncame rushing out, closely followed by his dear _vrouw_, and she was\nbeating him smartly with a long-handled warming-pan. The expression on\nher face gave our boys so little promise of a kind reception that they\nprudently resolved to carry their toes elsewhere to be warmed.\n\nThe next cottage proved to be more inviting. Its low roof of bright red\ntiles, extended over the cow-stable, that, clean as could be, nestled\nclose to the main building. A neat, peaceful-looking old woman sat at\none window, knitting. At the other could be discerned part of the\nprofile of a fat figure that, pipe in mouth, sat behind the shining\nlittle panes and snowy curtain. In answer to Peter's subdued knock, a\nfair-haired, rosy-cheeked lass in holiday attire opened the upper half\nof the green door (which was divided across the middle) and inquired\ntheir errand.\n\n\"May we enter and warm ourselves, jufvrouw?\" asked the captain\nrespectfully.\n\n\"Yes, and welcome,\" was the reply, as the lower half of the door swung\nsoftly toward its mate. Every boy before entering rubbed long and\nfaithfully upon the rough mat, and each made his best bow to the old\nlady and gentleman at the windows. Ben was half inclined to think that\nthese personages were automata like the moving figures in the garden at\nBroek; for they both nodded their heads slowly, in precisely the same\nway, and both went on with their employment as steadily and stiffly as\nthough they worked by machinery. The old man puffed! puffed! and his\nvrouw clicked her knitting-needles, as if regulated by internal\ncog-wheels. Even the real smoke issuing from the motionless pipe, gave\nno convincing proof that they were human.\n\nBut the rosy-cheeked maiden. Ah! how she bustled about. How she gave the\nboys polished high-backed chairs to sit upon, how she made the fire\nblaze up as if it were inspired, how she made Jacob Poot almost weep for\njoy by bringing forth a great square of gingerbread, and a stone jug of\nsour wine! How she laughed and nodded as the boys ate like wild animals\non good behavior, and how blank she looked when Ben politely but firmly\nrefused to take any black bread and sour-krout! How she pulled off\nJacob's mitten, which was torn at the thumb, and mended it before his\neyes, biting off the thread with her white teeth, and saying, \"now it\nwill be warmer,\" as she bit; and finally, how she shook hands with every\nboy in turn and (throwing a deprecating glance at the female automaton)\ninsisted upon filling their pockets with gingerbread!\n\nAll this time the knitting-needles clicked on, and the pipe never missed\na puff.\n\nWhen the boys were fairly on their way again, they came in sight of\nZwanenburg Castle with its massive stone front, and its gateway towers,\neach surmounted with a sculptured swan.\n\n\"Halfweg,[19] boys,\" said Peter, \"off with your skates.\"\n\n[Footnote 19: Half-way.]\n\n\"You see,\" explained Lambert to his companion, \"the Y and the Haarlem\nLake meeting here make it rather troublesome. The river is five feet\nhigher than the land--so we must have everything strong in the way of\ndykes and sluice-gates, or there would be wet work at once. The sluice\narrangements here are supposed to be something extra--we will walk over\nthem and you shall see enough to make you open your eyes. The spring\nwater of the lake, they say, has the most wonderful bleaching powers of\nany in the world; all the great Haarlem bleacheries use it. I can't say\nmuch upon that subject--but I can tell you _one_ thing from personal\nexperience.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Why, the lake is full of the biggest eels you ever saw--I've caught\nthem here, often--perfectly prodigious! I tell you they're sometimes a\nmatch for a fellow; they'd almost wriggle your arm from the socket if\nyou were not on your guard. But you're not interested in eels, I\nperceive. The castle's a big affair. Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. What do those swans mean? Anything?\" asked Ben, looking up at the\nstone gate-towers.\n\n\"The swan is held almost in reverence by us Hollanders. These give the\nbuilding its name, Zwanenburg--swan-castle. That is all I know. This is\na very important spot; for it is here that the wise ones hold council\nwith regard to dyke matters. The castle was once the residence of the\ncelebrated Christiaan Brunings.\"\n\n\"What about _him_?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Peter could answer you better than I,\" said Lambert, \"if you could only\nunderstand each other, or were not such cowards about leaving your\nmother-tongues. But I have often heard my grandfather speak of Brunings.\nHe is never tired of telling us of the great engineer--how good he was,\nand how learned, and how when he died the whole country seemed to mourn\nas for a friend. He belonged to a great many learned societies, and was\nat the head of the State department intrusted with the care of the\ndykes, and other defences against the sea. There's no counting the\nimprovements he made in dykes and sluices and water-mills, and all that\nkind of thing. We Hollanders, you know, consider our great engineers as\nthe highest of public benefactors. Brunings died years ago; they've a\nmonument to his memory in the cathedral of Haarlem. I have seen his\nportrait, and I tell you, Ben, he was right noble-looking. No wonder the\ncastle looks so stiff and proud. It is something to have given shelter\nto such a man!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Ben. \"I wonder, Van Mounen, whether you or I will\never give any old building a right to feel proud--Heigho! there's a\ngreat deal to be done yet in this world and some of us who are boys now,\nwill have to do it. Look to your shoe latchet, Van, it's unfastened.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nA CATASTROPHE\n\n\nIt was nearly one o'clock when Captain van Holp and his command entered\nthe grand old city of Haarlem. They had skated nearly seventeen miles\nsince morning, and were still as fresh as young eagles. From the\nyoungest (Ludwig van Holp, who was just fourteen) to the eldest, no less\na personage than the captain himself, a veteran of seventeen, there was\nbut one opinion--that this was the greatest frolic of their lives. To be\nsure, Jacob Poot had become rather short of breath, during the last mile\nor two, and perhaps he felt ready for another nap; but there was enough\njollity in him yet for a dozen. Even Carl Schummel, who had become very\nintimate with Ludwig during the excursion, forgot to be ill-natured. As\nfor Peter, he was the happiest of the happy, and had sung and whistled\nso joyously while skating that the staidest passers-by had smiled as\nthey listened.\n\n\"Come, boys! it's nearly tiffin[20] hour,\" he said, as they neared a\ncoffee-house on the main street. \"We must have something more solid than\nthe pretty maiden's gingerbread\"--and the captain plunged his hands into\nhis pockets as if to say, \"There's money enough here to feed an army!\"\n\n[Footnote 20: Lunch.]\n\n\"Hollo!\" cried Lambert, \"what ails the man?\"\n\nPeter, pale and staring, was clapping his hands upon his breast and\nsides--he looked like one suddenly becoming deranged.\n\n\"He's sick!\" cried Ben.\n\n\"No, he's lost something,\" said Carl.\n\nPeter could only gasp--\"the pocketbook! with all our money in it--it's\ngone!\"\n\nFor an instant all were too much startled to speak.\n\nCarl at last came out with a gruff,\n\n\"No sense in letting one fellow have all the money. I said so from the\nfirst. Look in your other pocket.\"\n\n\"I did--it isn't there.\"\n\n\"Open your under jacket----\"\n\nPeter obeyed mechanically. He even took off his hat and looked into\nit--then thrust his hand desperately into every pocket.\n\n\"It's gone, boys,\" he said at last, in a hopeless tone. \"No tiffin for\nus, nor dinner neither. What is to be done? We can't get on without\nmoney. If we were in Amsterdam I could get as much as we want, but there\nis not a man in Haarlem from whom I can borrow a stiver. Don't one of\nyou know any one here who would lend us a few guilders?\"\n\nEach boy looked into five blank faces. Then something like a smile\npassed around the circle, but it got sadly knotted up when it reached\nCarl.\n\n\"That wouldn't do,\" he said crossly. \"I know some people here, rich\nones, too, but father would flog me soundly, if I borrowed a cent from\nany one. He has 'AN HONEST MAN NEED NOT BORROW,' written over the\ngateway of his summer-house.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" responded Peter, not particularly admiring the sentiment just\nat that moment.\n\nThe boys grew desperately hungry at once.\n\n\"It wash my fault,\" said Jacob, in a penitent tone, to Ben. \"I say\nfirst, petter all de boys put zair pursh into Van Holp's monish.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Jacob; you did it all for the best.\"\n\nBen said this in such a sprightly tone that the two Van Holps and Carl\nfelt sure he had proposed a plan that would relieve the party at once.\n\n\"What? what? Tell us, Van Mounen,\" they cried.\n\n\"He says it is not Jacob's fault that the money is lost--that he did it\nfor the best, when he proposed that Van Holp should put all of our money\ninto his purse.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" said Ludwig dismally; \"he need not have made such a fuss\nin just saying _that_. How much money have we lost?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember?\" said Peter. \"We each put in exactly ten guilders.\nThe purse had sixty guilders in it. I am the stupidest fellow in the\nworld; little Schimmelpenninck would have made you a better captain. I\ncould pommel myself for bringing such a disappointment upon you.\"\n\n\"Do it then,\" growled Carl. \"Pooh,\" he added, \"we all know it was an\naccident, but that doesn't help matters. We must have money, Van\nHolp--even if you have to sell your wonderful watch.\"\n\n\"Sell my mother's birthday present! Never! I will sell my coat, my hat,\nanything but my watch.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Jacob pleasantly, \"we are making too much of this\naffair. We can go home and start again in a day or two.\"\n\n\"_You_ may be able to get another ten-guilder piece,\" said Carl, \"but\nthe rest of us will not find it so easy. If we go home, we stay home,\nyou may depend.\"\n\nOur captain, whose good-nature had not yet forsaken him for a moment,\ngrew indignant.\n\n\"Do you think I will let you suffer for my carelessness,\" he exclaimed.\n\"I have three times sixty guilders in my strong box at home!\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Carl, hastily, adding in a surlier tone,\n\"well, I see no better way than to go back hungry.\"\n\n\"I see a better plan than that,\" said the captain.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried all the boys.\n\n\"Why, to make the best of a bad business and go back pleasantly, and\nlike men,\" said Peter, looking so gallant and handsome as he turned his\nfrank face and clear blue eyes upon them--that they caught his spirit.\n\n\"Ho! for the captain,\" they shouted.\n\n\"Now, boys, we may as well make up our minds there's no place like\nBroek, after all--and that we mean to be there in two hours--is that\nagreed to?\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" cried all, as they ran to the canal.\n\n\"On with your skates! Are you ready? Here, Jacob, let me help you.\"\n\n\"Now. One, two, three, start!\"\n\nAnd the boyish faces that left Haarlem at that signal were nearly as\nbright as those that had entered it with Captain Peter half an hour\nbefore.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nHANS\n\n\n\"Donder and Blixin!\" cried Carl angrily, before the party had skated\ntwenty yards from the city gates, \"if here isn't that wooden-skate\nragamuffin in the patched leather breeches. That fellow is everywhere,\nconfound him! We'll be lucky,\" he added, in as sneering a tone as he\ndared to assume, \"if our captain doesn't order us to halt and shake\nhands with him.\"\n\n\"Your captain is a terrible fellow,\" said Peter, pleasantly, \"but this\nis a false alarm, Carl--I cannot spy your bugbear anywhere among the\nskaters--ah! there he is! why, what is the matter with the lad?\"\n\nPoor Hans! His face was pale, his lips compressed. He skated like one\nunder the effects of a fearful dream. Just as he was passing, Peter\nhailed him:\n\n\"Good day, Hans Brinker!\"\n\nHans' countenance brightened at once.--\"Ah! Mynheer, is that you? It is\nwell we meet!\"\n\n\"Just like his impertinence,\" hissed Carl Schummel, darting scornfully\npast his companions, who seemed inclined to linger with their captain.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Hans,\" responded Peter, cheerily, \"but you look\ntroubled. Can I serve you?\"\n\n\"I have a trouble, mynheer,\" answered Hans, casting down his eyes. Then\nlifting them again with almost a happy expression, he added, \"but it is\nHans who can help Mynheer van Holp _this_ time.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Peter, making, in his blunt Dutch way, no attempt to\nconceal his surprise.\n\n\"By giving you _this_, mynheer\"--and Hans held forth the missing purse.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted the boys taking their cold hands from their pockets to\nwave them joyfully in the air. But Peter said \"Thank you, Hans Brinker,\"\nin a tone that made Hans feel as if the king had knelt to him.\n\nThe shout of the delighted boys reached the muffled ears of the fine\nyoung gentleman who, under a full pressure of pent-up wrath, was skating\ntoward Amsterdam. A Yankee boy would have wheeled about at once and\nhastened to satisfy his curiosity. But Carl only halted, and with his\nback toward his party wondered what on earth had happened. There he\nstood, immovable, until, feeling sure that nothing but the prospect of\nsomething to eat could have made them hurrah so heartily, he turned and\nskated slowly toward his excited comrades.\n\nMeantime Peter had drawn Hans aside from the rest.\n\n\"How did you know it was my purse?\" he asked.\n\n\"You paid me three guilders yesterday, mynheer, for making the\nwhite-wood chain, telling me that I must buy skates.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"I saw your purse then; it was of yellow leather.\"\n\n\"And where did you find it to-day?\"\n\n\"I left my home this morning, mynheer, in great trouble, and as I\nskated, I took no heed until I stumbled against some lumber, and while I\nwas rubbing my knee I saw your purse nearly hidden under a log.\"\n\n\"That place! Ah, I remember, now; just as we were passing it I pulled my\ntippet from my pocket, and probably flirted out the purse at the same\ntime. It would have been gone but for you, Hans. Here\"--pouring out the\ncontents--\"you must give us the pleasure of dividing the money with\nyou----\"\n\n\"No, mynheer,\" answered Hans. He spoke quietly, without pretence, or any\ngrace of manner, but Peter, somehow, felt rebuked, and put the silver\nback without a word.\n\n\"I like that boy, rich or poor,\" he thought to himself, then added\naloud, \"May I ask about this trouble of yours, Hans?\"\n\n\"Ah, mynheer, it is a sad case--but I have waited here too long. I am\ngoing to Leyden to see the great Dr. Boekman----\"\n\n\"Dr. Boekman!\" exclaimed Peter in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes, mynheer, and I have not a moment to lose. Good day!\"\n\n\"Stay, I am going that way. Come, my lads! Shall we return to Haarlem?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried the boys, eagerly--and off they started.\n\n\"Now,\" said Peter, drawing near Hans, both skimming the ice so easily\nand lightly as they skated on together that they seemed scarce conscious\nof moving, \"we are going to stop at Leyden, and if you are going there\nonly with a message to Dr. Boekman cannot I do the errand for you? The\nboys may be too tired to skate so far to-day, but I will promise to see\nhim early to-morrow if he is to be found in the city.\"\n\n\"Ah, mynheer, that would be serving me indeed; it is not the distance I\ndread, but leaving my mother so long.\"\n\n\"Is she ill?\"\n\n\"No, mynheer. It is the father. You may have heard it; how he has been\nwithout wit for many a year--ever since the great Schlossen mill was\nbuilt; but his body has been well and strong. Last night, the mother\nknelt upon the hearth to blow the peat (it is his only delight to sit\nand watch the live embers; and she will blow them into a blaze every\nhour of the day to please him). Before she could stir, he sprang upon\nher like a giant and held her close to the fire, all the time laughing\nand shaking his head. I was on the canal; but I heard the mother scream\nand ran to her. The father had never loosened his hold, and her gown was\nsmoking. I tried to deaden the fire, but with one hand he pushed me off.\nThere was no water in the cottage or I could have done better--and all\nthat time he laughed--such a terrible laugh, mynheer; hardly a sound,\nbut all in his face--I tried to pull her away, but that only made it\nworse--then--it was dreadful, but could I see the mother burn? I beat\nhim--beat him with a stool. He tossed me away. The gown was on fire! I\n_would_ put it out. I can't remember well after that; I found myself\nupon the floor and the mother was praying--It seemed to me that she was\nin a blaze, and all the while I could hear that laugh. My sister Gretel\nscreamed out that he was holding the mother close to the very coals. _I_\ncould not tell! Gretel flew to the closet and filled a porringer with\nthe food he liked, and put it upon the floor. Then, mynheer, he left the\nmother and crawled to it like a little child. She was not burnt, only a\npart of her clothing--ah, how kind she was to him all night, watching\nand tending him--He slept in a high fever, with his hand pressed to his\nhead. The mother says he has done that so much of late, as though he\nfelt pain there--Ah, mynheer, I did not mean to tell you. If the father\nwas himself, he would not harm even a kitten----\"\n\nFor a moment the two boys moved on in silence--\n\n\"It is terrible,\" said Peter at last--\"How is he to-day?\"\n\n\"Very sick, mynheer----\"\n\n\"Why go for Dr. Boekman, Hans? There are others in Amsterdam who could\nhelp him, perhaps;--Boekman is a famous man, sought only by the\nwealthiest and they often wait upon him in vain.\"\n\n\"He _promised_, mynheer, he promised me yesterday to come to the father\nin a week--but now that the change has come, we cannot wait--we think\nthe poor father is dying--Oh! mynheer, you can plead with him to come\nquick--he will not wait a whole week and our father dying--the good\nmeester is so kind----\"\n\n\"_So kind!_\" echoed Peter, in astonishment. \"Why, he is known as the\ncrossest man in Holland!\"\n\n\"He looks so because he has no fat, and his head is busy but his heart\nis kind, I know--Tell the meester what I have told you, mynheer, and he\nwill come.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Hans, with all my heart. You are in haste to turn homeward,\nI see. Promise me that should you need a friend, you will go to my\nmother, at Broek. Tell her I bade you see her; and, Hans Brinker--not as\na reward--but as a gift--take a few of these guilders.\"\n\nHans shook his head resolutely.\n\n\"No, no, mynheer--I cannot take it. If I could find work in Broek or at\nthe South Mill I would be glad, but it is the same story\neverywhere--'wait till Spring.'\"\n\n\"It is well you speak of it,\" said Peter eagerly, \"for my father needs\nhelp at once--Your pretty chain pleased him much--he said 'that boy has\na clean cut, he would be good at carving'--There is to be a carved\nportal to our new summer-house, and father will pay well for the job.\"\n\n\"God is good!\" cried Hans in sudden delight--\"Oh! mynheer, that would be\ntoo much joy--I have never tried big work--but I can do it--I know I\ncan.\"\n\n\"Well, tell my father you are the Hans Brinker of whom I spoke. He will\nbe glad to serve you.\"\n\nHans stared in honest surprise.\n\n\"Thank you, mynheer.\"\n\n\"Now, captain,\" shouted Carl, anxious to appear as good-humored as\npossible, by way of atonement, \"here we are in the midst of Haarlem, and\nno word from you yet--we await your orders, and we're as hungry as\nwolves.\"\n\nPeter made a cheerful answer, and turned hurriedly to Hans.\n\n\"Come get something to eat, and I will detain you no longer.\"\n\nWhat a quick, wistful look Hans threw upon him! Peter wondered that he\nhad not noticed before that the poor boy was hungry.\n\n\"Ah, mynheer, even now the mother may need me, the father may be\nworse--I must not wait--May God care for you\"--and, nodding hastily,\nHans turned his face homeward and was gone.\n\n\"Come, boys,\" sighed Peter, \"now for our tiffin!\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nHOMES\n\n\nIt must not be supposed that our young Dutchmen had already forgotten\nthe great skating-race which was to take place on the Twentieth. On the\ncontrary, they had thought and spoken of it very often during the day.\nEven Ben, though he had felt more like a traveler than the rest, had\nnever once, through all the sightseeing, lost a certain vision of silver\nskates which, for a week past, had haunted him night and day.\n\nLike a true \"John Bull,\" as Jacob had called him, he never doubted that\nhis English fleetness, English strength, English everything, could at\nany time enable him, on the ice, to put all Holland to shame, and the\nrest of the world, too, for that matter. Ben certainly was a superb\nskater. He had enjoyed not half the opportunities for practicing that\nhad fallen to his new comrades; but he had improved his share to the\nutmost; and was, besides, so strong of frame, so supple of limb--in\nshort such a tight, trim, quick, graceful fellow in every way, that he\nhad taken to skating as naturally as a chamois to leaping, or an eagle\nto soaring.\n\nOnly to the heavy heart of poor Hans had the vision of the Silver Skates\nfailed to appear during that starry winter night and the brighter sunlit\nday.\n\nEven Gretel had seen them flitting before her as she sat beside her\nmother through those hours of weary watching--not as prizes to be won,\nbut as treasures passing hopelessly beyond her reach.\n\nRychie, Hilda and Katrinka--why they had scarcely known any other\nthought than \"the race! the race! It will come off on the Twentieth!\"\n\nThese three girls were friends. Though of nearly the same age, talent\nand station, they were as different as girls could be.\n\nHilda van Gleck you already know, a warm-hearted, noble girl of\nfourteen. Rychie Korbes was beautiful to look upon, far more sparkling\nand pretty than Hilda, but not half so bright and sunny within. Clouds\nof pride, of discontent and envy had already gathered in her heart, and\nwere growing bigger and darker every day. Of course these often relieved\nthemselves very much after the manner of other clouds--But who saw the\nstorms and the weeping? Only her maid, or her father, mother and little\nbrother--those who loved her better than all. Like other clouds, too,\nhers often took queer shapes, and what was really but mist and vapory\nfancy, assumed the appearance of monster wrongs, and mountains of\ndifficulty. To her mind, the poor peasant-girl Gretel was not a human\nbeing, a God-created creature like herself--she was only something that\nmeant poverty, rags and dirt. Such as Gretel had no right to feel, to\nhope; above all, they should never cross the paths of their\nbetters--that is, not in a disagreeable way. They could toil and labor\nfor them at a respectful distance, even admire them, if they would do it\nhumbly, but nothing more. If they rebel, put them down--If they suffer,\ndon't trouble me about it, was Rychie's secret motto. And yet how witty\nshe was, how tastefully she dressed, how charmingly she sang; how much\nfeeling she displayed (for pet kittens and rabbits), and how completely\nshe could bewitch sensible, honest-minded lads like Lambert van Mounen\nand Ludwig van Holp!\n\nCarl was too much like her, within, to be an earnest admirer, and\nperhaps he suspected the clouds. He, being deep and surly, and always\nuncomfortably in earnest, of course preferred the lively Katrinka, whose\nnature was made of a hundred tinkling bells. She was a coquette in her\ninfancy, a coquette in her childhood, and now a coquette in her\nschool-days. Without a thought of harm, she coquetted with her studies,\nher duties, even her little troubles. They shouldn't know when they\nbothered her, not they. She coquetted with her mother, her pet lamb, her\nbaby brother, even with her own golden curls--tossing them back as if\nshe despised them. Every one liked her, but who could love her? She was\nnever in earnest. A pleasant face, a pleasant heart, a pleasant\nmanner--these only satisfy for an hour. Poor, happy Katrinka! such as\nshe, tinkle, tinkle so merrily through their early days; but Life is so\napt to coquette with them in turn, to put all their sweet bells out of\ntune, or to silence them one by one!\n\nHow different were the homes of these three girls from the tumbling old\ncottage where Gretel dwelt. Rychie lived in a beautiful house near\nAmsterdam, where the carved sideboards were laden with services of\nsilver and gold, and where silken tapestries hung in folds from ceiling\nto floor.\n\nHilda's father owned the largest mansion in Broek. Its glittering roof\nof polished tiles, and its boarded front, painted in half a dozen\nvarious colors, were the admiration of the neighborhood.\n\nKatrinka's home, not a mile distant, was the finest of Dutch\ncountry-seats. The garden was so stiffly laid out in little paths and\npatches that the birds might have mistaken it for a great Chinese puzzle\nwith all the pieces spread out ready for use. But in summer it was\nbeautiful; the flowers made the best of their stiff quarters, and, when\nthe gardener was not watching, glowed and bent and twined about each\nother in the prettiest way imaginable. Such a tulip bed! Why, the Queen\nof the Fairies would never care for a grander city in which to hold her\ncourt! but Katrinka preferred the bed of pink and white hyacinths. She\nloved their freshness and fragrance, and the light-hearted way in which\ntheir bell-shaped blossoms swung in the breeze.\n\nCarl was both right and wrong when he said that Katrinka and Rychie were\nfurious at the very idea of the peasant Gretel joining in the race. He\nhad heard Rychie declare it was \"disgraceful, shameful, TOO BAD!\" which\nin Dutch, as in English, is generally the strongest expression an\nindignant girl can use; and he had seen Katrinka nod her pretty head,\nand heard her sweetly echo \"shameful, too bad!\" as nearly like Rychie as\ntinkling bells can be like the voice of real anger. That had satisfied\nhim. He never suspected that had Hilda, not Rychie, first talked with\nKatrinka upon the subject, the bells would have jingled as willing an\necho. She would have said, \"Certainly, let her join us,\" and would have\nskipped off thinking no more about it. But now Katrinka with sweet\nemphasis pronounced it a shame that a goose-girl, a forlorn little\ncreature like Gretel should be allowed to spoil the race.\n\nRychie being rich and powerful (in a schoolgirl way) had other\nfollowers, besides Katrinka, who were induced to share her opinions\nbecause they were either too careless or too cowardly to think for\nthemselves.\n\nPoor little Gretel! Her home was sad and dark enough now. Raff Brinker\nlay moaning upon his rough bed, and his vrouw, forgetting and forgiving\neverything, bathed his forehead, his lips, weeping and praying that he\nmight not die. Hans, as we know, had started in desperation for Leyden\nto search for Dr. Boekman, and induce him, if possible, to come to their\nfather at once. Gretel, filled with a strange dread, had done the work\nas well as she could, wiped the rough brick floor, brought peat to build\nup the slow fire, and melted ice for her mother's use. This\naccomplished, she seated herself upon a low stool near the bed, and\nbegged her mother to try and sleep a while.\n\n\"You are so tired,\" she whispered, \"not once have you closed your eyes\nsince that dreadful hour last night. See, I have straightened the willow\nbed in the corner, and spread everything soft upon it I could find, so\nthat the mother might lie in comfort. Here is your jacket. Take off that\npretty dress, I'll fold it away very careful, and put it in the big\nchest before you go to sleep.\"\n\nDame Brinker shook her head without turning her eyes from her husband's\nface.\n\n\"I can watch, mother,\" urged Gretel, \"and I'll wake you every time the\nfather stirs. You are so pale, and your eyes are so red--oh, mother,\n_do_!\"\n\nThe child pleaded in vain. Dame Brinker would not leave her post.\n\nGretel looked at her in troubled silence, wondering whether it were very\nwicked to care more for one parent than for the other--and sure, yes,\nquite sure, that she dreaded her father, while she clung to her mother\nwith a love that was almost idolatry.\n\n\"Hans loves the father so well,\" she thought, \"why cannot I? Yet I could\nnot help crying when I saw his hand bleed that day, last month, when he\nsnatched the knife--and now, when he moans, how I ache, ache all over.\nPerhaps I love him, after all, and God will see I am not such a bad,\nwicked girl as I thought. Yes, I love the poor father--almost as Hans\ndoes--not quite, for Hans is stronger and does not fear him. Oh, will\nthat moaning go on forever and ever! Poor mother, how patient she is;\n_she_ never pouts, as I do, about the money that went away so strange.\nIf he only could, just for one instant, open his eyes and look at us, as\nHans does, and tell us where mother's guilders went, I would not care\nfor the rest--yes, I would care--I don't want the poor father to die, to\nbe all blue and cold like Annie Bouman's little sister--I _know_ I\ndon't--dear God, I don't want father to die.\"\n\nHer thoughts merged into a prayer. When it ended, the poor child\nscarcely knew. Soon she found herself watching a little pulse of light\nat the side of the fire, beating faintly but steadily, showing that\nsomewhere in the dark pile there was warmth and light that would\noverspread it at last. A large earthen cup filled with burning peat\nstood near the bedside; Gretel had placed it there to \"stop the father's\nshivering\" she said. She watched it as it sent a glow around the\nmother's form, tipping her faded skirt with light, and shedding a sort\nof newness over the threadbare bodice. It was a relief to Gretel to see\nthe lines in that weary face soften as the firelight flickered gently\nacross it.\n\nNext she counted the window-panes, broken and patched as they were; and\nfinally, after tracing every crack and seam in the walls, fixed her gaze\nupon a carved shelf made by Hans. The shelf hung as high as Gretel\ncould reach. It held a large leather-covered Bible, with brass clasps, a\nwedding present to Dame Brinker from the family at Heidelberg.\n\n\"Ah, how handy Hans is! If he were here he could turn the father some\nway so the moans would stop--dear! dear! if this sickness lasts, we\nshall never skate any more. I must send my new skates back to the\nbeautiful lady. Hans and I will not see the race,\" and Gretel's eyes,\nthat had been dry before, grew full of tears.\n\n\"Never cry, child,\" said her mother soothingly. \"This sickness may not\nbe as bad as we think. The father has lain this way before.\"\n\nGretel sobbed now.\n\n\"Oh, mother, it is not that alone--you do not know all--I am very, very\nbad and wicked!\"\n\n\"_You_, Gretel! you so patient and good!\" and a bright, puzzled look\nbeamed for an instant upon the child. \"Hush, lovey, you'll wake him.\"\n\nGretel hid her face in her mother's lap, and tried not to cry.\n\nHer little hand, so thin and brown, lay in the coarse palm of her\nmother, creased with many a hard day's work. Rychie would have shuddered\nto touch either, yet they pressed warmly upon each other. Soon Gretel\nlooked up with that dull, homely look which, they say, poor children in\nshanties are apt to have, and said in a trembling voice:\n\n\"The father tried to burn you--he did--I saw him, and he was\n_laughing_!\"\n\n\"Hush, child!\"\n\nThe mother's words came so suddenly and sharply, that Raff Brinker,\ndead as he was to all that was passing round him, twitched slightly upon\nthe bed.\n\nGretel said no more, but plucked drearily at the jagged edge of a hole\nin her mother's holiday gown. It had been burned there--well for Dame\nBrinker that the gown was woolen.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nHAARLEM.--THE BOYS HEAR VOICES\n\n\nRefreshed and rested, our boys came forth from the coffee-house just as\nthe big clock in the Square, after the manner of certain Holland\ntimekeepers, was striking TWO with its half-hour bell, for half-past\nTWO.\n\nThe captain was absorbed in thought, at first, for Hans Brinker's sad\nstory still echoed in his ears. Not until Ludwig rebuked him with a\nlaughing \"Wake up, Grandfather!\" did he reassume his position as gallant\nboy-leader of his band.\n\n\"Ahem! this way, young gentlemen!\"\n\nThey were walking through the streets of the city, not on a curbed\n_sidewalk_, for such a thing is rarely to be found in Holland, but on\nthe brick pavement that lay on the borders of the cobblestone\ncarriage-way without breaking its level expanse.\n\nHaarlem, like Amsterdam, was gayer than usual, in honor of St. Nicholas.\n\nA strange figure was approaching them. It was a small man dressed in\nblack, with a short cloak; he wore a wig and a cocked hat from which a\nlong crape streamer was flying.\n\n\"Who comes here?\" cried Ben; \"what a queer-looking object.\"\n\n\"That's the aanspreeker,\" said Lambert; \"some one is dead.\"\n\n\"Is that the way men dress in mourning in this country?\"\n\n\"Oh no. The aanspreeker attends funerals, and it is his business, when\nany one dies, to notify all the friends and relatives.\"\n\n\"What a strange custom.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lambert \"we needn't feel very badly about this particular\ndeath, for I see another man has lately been born to the world to fill\nup the vacant place.\"\n\nBen stared. \"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Don't you see that pretty red pincushion hanging on yonder door?\" asked\nLambert in return.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a boy.\"\n\n\"A boy! what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that here in Haarlem whenever a boy is born, the parents have a\nred pincushion put out at the door. If our young friend had been a girl\ninstead of a boy the cushion would have been white. In some places they\nhave much more fanciful affairs, all trimmed with lace, and even among\nthe very poorest houses you will see a bit of ribbon or even a string\ntied on the door-latch----\"\n\n\"Look!\" almost screamed Ben, \"there _is_ a white cushion, at the door of\nthat double-jointed house with the funny roof.\"\n\n\"I don't see any house with a funny roof.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course not,\" said Ben. \"I forget you're a native; but all the\nroofs are queer to me, for that matter. I mean the house next to that\ngreen building.\"\n\n\"True enough--there's a girl! I tell you what, captain,\" called out\nLambert, slipping easily into Dutch, \"we must get out of this street as\nsoon as possible. It's full of babies! They'll set up a squall in a\nmoment.\"\n\nThe captain laughed. \"I shall take you to hear better music than that,\"\nhe said; \"we are just in time to hear the organ of St. Bavon. The church\nis open to-day.\"\n\n\"What, the great Haarlem organ?\" asked Ben. \"That will be a treat\nindeed. I have often read of it, with its tremendous pipes, and its _vox\nhumana_[21] that sounds like a giant singing.\"\n\n[Footnote 21: An organ stop which produces an effect resembling the\nhuman voice.]\n\n\"The same,\" answered Lambert van Mounen.\n\nPeter was right. The church was open, though not for religious services.\nSome one was playing upon the organ. As the boys entered, a swell of\nsound rushed forth to meet them. It seemed to bear them, one by one,\ninto the shadows of the building.\n\nLouder and louder it grew until it became like the din and roar of some\nmighty tempest, or like the ocean surging upon the shore. In the midst\nof the tumult a tinkling bell was heard; another answered, then another,\nand the storm paused as if to listen. The bells grew bolder; they rang\nout loud and clear. Other deep toned bells joined in; they were tolling\nin solemn concert--ding, dong! ding, dong! The storm broke forth again\nwith redoubled fury--gathering its distant thunder. The boys looked at\neach other, but did not speak. It was growing serious. What was that?\n_Who_ screamed? _What_ screamed--that terrible, musical scream? Was it\nman or demon? Or was it some monster shut up behind that carved brass\nframe--behind those great silver columns--some despairing monster\nbegging, screaming for freedom? It was the Vox Humana!\n\nAt last an answer came,--soft, tender, loving, like a mother's song. The\nstorm grew silent; hidden birds sprang forth filling the air with glad,\necstatic music, rising higher and higher until the last faint note was\nlost in the distance.\n\nThe Vox Humana was stilled; but in the glorious hymn of thanksgiving\nthat now arose, one could almost hear the throbbing of a human heart.\nWhat did it mean? That man's imploring cry should in time be met with a\ndeep content? That gratitude would give us freedom? To Peter and Ben it\nseemed that the angels were singing. Their eyes grew dim, and their\nsouls dizzy with a strange joy. At last, as if borne upward by invisible\nhands, they were floating away on the music, all fatigue forgotten, and\nwith no wish but to hear forever those beautiful sounds--when suddenly\nVan Holp's sleeve was pulled impatiently and a gruff voice beside him\nasked:\n\n\"How long are you going to stay here, captain--blinking at the ceiling\nlike a sick rabbit? It's high time we started.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Peter, only half aroused.\n\n\"Come, man! Let's go,\" said Carl, giving the sleeve a second pull.\n\nPeter turned reluctantly; he would not detain the boys against their\nwill. All but Ben were casting rather reproachful glances upon him.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" he whispered, \"we will go. Softly now.\"\n\n\"That's the greatest thing I've seen or heard since I've been in\nHolland!\" cried Ben, enthusiastically, as soon as they reached the open\nair. \"It's glorious!\"\n\nLudwig and Carl laughed slyly at the English boy's _wartaal_, or\ngibberish; Jacob yawned; Peter gave Ben a look that made him instantly\nfeel that he and Peter were not so very different after all, though one\nhailed from Holland and the other from England; and Lambert, the\ninterpreter, responded with a brisk--\n\n\"You may well say so. I believe there are one or two organs nowadays\nthat are said to be as fine; but for years and years this organ of St.\nBavon was the grandest in the world.\"\n\n\"Do you know how large it is?\" asked Ben. \"I noticed that the church\nitself was prodigiously high and that the organ filled the end of the\ngreat aisle almost from floor to roof.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Lambert, \"and how superb the pipes looked--just like\ngrand columns of silver. They're only for show, you know; the _real_\npipes are behind them, some big enough for a man to crawl through, and\nsome smaller than a baby's whistle. Well, sir, for size, the church is\nhigher than Westminster Abbey, to begin with, and, as you say, the organ\nmakes a tremendous show even then. Father told me last night that it is\none hundred and eight feet high, fifty feet broad, and has over five\nthousand pipes; it has sixty-four _stops_, if you know what they are,\n_I_ don't, and three keyboards.\"\n\n\"Good for you!\" said Ben. \"You have a fine memory. _My_ head is a\nperfect colander for figures; they slip through as fast as they're\npoured in. But other facts and historical events stay behind--that's\nsome consolation.\"\n\n\"There we differ,\" returned Van Mounen. \"I'm great on names and figures,\nbut history, take it altogether, seems to me to be the most hopeless\nkind of a jumble.\"\n\nMeantime Carl and Ludwig were having a discussion concerning some square\nwooden monuments they had observed in the interior of the church; Ludwig\ndeclared that each bore the name of the person buried beneath, and Carl\ninsisted that they had no names, but only the heraldic arms of the\ndeceased painted on a black ground, with the date of the death in gilt\nletters.\n\n\"I ought to know,\" said Carl, \"for I walked across to the east side, to\nlook for the cannon-ball which mother told me was embedded there. It was\nfired into the church, in the year fifteen hundred and something, by\nthose rascally Spaniards, while the services were going on. There it was\nin the wall, sure enough, and while I was walking back, I noticed the\nmonuments--I tell you they haven't a sign of a name upon them.\"\n\n\"Ask Peter,\" said Ludwig, only half convinced.\n\n\"Carl is right,\" replied Peter, who though conversing with Jacob, had\noverheard their dispute. \"Well, Jacob, as I was saying, Handel the great\ncomposer chanced to visit Haarlem and of course he at once hunted up\nthis famous organ. He gained admittance, and was playing upon it with\nall his might, when the regular organist chanced to enter the building.\nThe man stood awe-struck; he was a good player himself, but he had never\nheard such music before. 'Who is there?' he cried. 'If it is not an\nangel or the devil, it must be Handel!' When he discovered that it _was_\nthe great musician, he was still more mystified! 'But how is this?' said\nhe; 'you have done impossible things--no ten fingers on earth can play\nthe passages you have given; human hands couldn't control all the keys\nand stops!' 'I know it,' said Handel, coolly, 'and for that reason, I\nwas forced to strike some notes with the end of my nose.' Donder! just\nthink how the old organist must have stared!\"\n\n\"Hey! What?\" exclaimed Jacob, startled when Peter's animated voice\nsuddenly became silent.\n\n\"Haven't you heard me, you rascal?\" was the indignant rejoinder.\n\n\"Oh, yes--no--the fact is--I heard you at first--I'm awake now, but I do\nbelieve I've been walking beside you half asleep,\" stammered Jacob, with\nsuch a doleful, bewildered look on his face, that Peter could not help\nlaughing.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nTHE MAN WITH FOUR HEADS\n\n\nAfter leaving the church, the boys stopped near by in the open\nmarket-place, to look at the bronze statue of Laurens Janzoon Coster,\nwho is believed by the Dutch to have been the inventor of printing. This\nis disputed by those who award the same honor to Johannes Gutenberg of\nMayence; while many maintain that Faustus, a servant of Coster, stole\nhis master's wooden types on a Christmas eve, when the latter was at\nchurch, and fled with his booty, and his secret, to Mayence. Coster was\na native of Haarlem, and the Hollanders are naturally anxious to secure\nthe credit of the invention for their illustrious townsman. Certain it\nis, that the first book he printed, is kept, by the city, in a silver\ncase wrapped in silk, and is shown with great caution as a most precious\nrelic. It is said, he first conceived the idea of printing from cutting\nhis name upon the bark of a tree, and afterward pressing a piece of\npaper upon the characters.\n\nOf course Lambert and his English friend fully discussed this subject.\nThey also had rather a warm argument concerning another invention.\nLambert declared that the honor of giving both the telescope and\nmicroscope to the world lay between Metius and Jansen, both Hollanders;\nwhile Ben as stoutly insisted that Roger Bacon, an English monk of the\nthirteenth century, \"wrote out the whole thing, sir, perfect\ndescriptions of microscopes and telescopes, too, long before either of\nthose other fellows were born.\"\n\nOn one subject, however, they both agreed: that the art of curing and\npickling herrings was discovered by William Beukles of Holland, and that\nthe country did perfectly right in honoring him as a national\nbenefactor, for its wealth and importance had been in a great measure\ndue to its herring trade.\n\n\"It is astonishing,\" said Ben, \"in what prodigious quantities those fish\nare found. I don't know how it is here, but on the coast of England, off\nYarmouth, the herring shoals have been known to be six and seven feet\ndeep with fish.\"\n\n\"That is prodigious, indeed,\" said Lambert, \"but you know your word\nherring is derived from the German _heer_, an army, on account of a way\nthe fish have of coming in large numbers.\"\n\nSoon afterward, while passing a cobbler's shop, Ben exclaimed:\n\n\"Hollo! Lambert, here is the name of one of your greatest men over a\ncobbler's stall! Boerhaave--if it were only Herman Boerhaave instead of\nHendrick, it would be complete.\"\n\nLambert knit his brows reflectively, as he replied:\n\n\"Boerhaave--Boerhaave--the name is perfectly familiar; I remember, too,\nhe was born in 1668, but the rest is all gone, as usual. There have been\nso many famous Hollanders, you see, it is impossible for a fellow to\nknow them all. What was he? Did he have two heads? or was he one of your\ngreat, natural swimmers like Marco Polo?\"\n\n\"He had _four_ heads,\" answered Ben, laughing, \"for he was a great\nphysician, naturalist, botanist and chemist. I am full of him just now,\nfor I read his life a few weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Pour out a little then,\" said Lambert; \"only walk faster, we shall lose\nsight of the other boys.\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Ben, quickening his pace, and looking with great\ninterest at everything going on in the crowded street. \"This Dr.\nBoerhaave was a great anspewker.\"\n\n\"A great _what_?\" roared Lambert.\n\n\"Oh, I beg pardon--I was thinking of that man over there, with the\ncocked hat. He's an anspewker, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's an aanspreeker--if that is what you mean to say. But what\nabout your friend with the four heads?\"\n\n\"Well, as I was going to say, the doctor was left a penniless orphan at\nsixteen without education or friends.\"\n\n\"Jolly beginning!\" interposed Lambert.\n\n\"Now don't interrupt. He was a poor friendless orphan at sixteen, but he\nwas so persevering and industrious, so determined to gain knowledge,\nthat he made his way, and in time became one of the most learned men of\nEurope. All the----What is that?\"\n\n\"Where? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, that paper on the door opposite. Don't you see? Two or three\npersons are reading it; I have noticed several of these papers since\nI've been here.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's only a health-bulletin. Somebody in the house is ill, and to\nprevent a steady knocking at the door, the family write an account of\nthe patient's condition on a placard, and hang it outside the door, for\nthe benefit of inquiring friends--a very sensible custom, I'm sure.\nNothing strange about it that I can see--go on, please--you said 'all\nthe'--and there you left me hanging.\"\n\n\"I was going to say,\" resumed Ben, \"that all the--all the--how comically\npersons do dress here, to be sure! Just look at those men and women with\ntheir sugar-loaf hats--and see this woman ahead of us with a\nstraw-bonnet like a scoop-shovel tapering to a point in the back. Did\never you see anything so funny? And those tremendous wooden shoes,\ntoo--I declare she's a beauty!\"\n\n\"Oh, they are only back-country folk,\" said Lambert, rather\nimpatiently--\"You might as well let old Boerhaave drop, or else shut\nyour eyes----\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! Well, I was _going_ to say--all the big men of his day sought\nout this great professor. Even Peter the Great when he came over to\nHolland from Russia to learn ship-building, attended his lectures\nregularly. By that time Boerhaave was professor of Medicine and\nChemistry and Botany in the University of Leyden. He had grown to be\nvery wealthy as a practicing physician; but he used to say that the poor\nwere his best patients because God would be their pay-master. All Europe\nlearned to love and honor him. In short, he became so famous that a\ncertain mandarin of China addressed a letter to 'The illustrious\nBoerhaave, physician in Europe,' and the letter found its way to him\nwithout any difficulty.\"\n\n\"My goodness! That is what I call being a public character. The boys\nhave stopped. How now, Captain van Holp, what next?\"\n\n\"We propose to move on,\" said Van Holp; \"there is nothing to see at this\nseason in the Bosch--the Bosch is a noble wood, Benjamin, a grand Park\nwhere they have most magnificent trees, protected by law--Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Ya!\" nodded Ben, as the captain proceeded:\n\n\"Unless you all desire to visit the Museum of Natural History, we may go\non the grand canal again. If we had more time it would be pleasant to\ntake Benjamin up the Blue Stairs.\"\n\n\"What are the Blue Stairs, Lambert?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"They are the highest point of the Dunes. You have a grand view of the\nocean from there, besides a fine chance to see how wonderful these Dunes\nare. One can hardly believe that the wind could ever heap up sand in so\nremarkable a way. But we have to go through Bloemendal to get there--not\na very pretty village, and some distance from here. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am ready for anything. For my part, I would rather steer direct\nfor Leyden, but we'll do as the captain says--hey, Jacob?\"\n\n\"Ya, dat ish goot,\" said Jacob, who felt decidedly more like taking\nanother nap, than ascending the Blue Stairs.\n\nThe captain was in favor of going to Leyden.\n\n\"It's four long miles from here. (Full sixteen of your English miles,\nBenjamin.) We have no time to lose if you wish to reach there before\nmidnight. Decide quickly, boys--Blue Stairs or Leyden?\"\n\n\"Leyden,\" they answered--and were out of Haarlem in a twinkling,\nadmiring the lofty, tower-like windmills and pretty country-seats as\nthey left the city behind them.\n\n\"If you really wish to see Haarlem,\" said Lambert to Ben, after they had\nskated a while in silence, \"you should visit it in summer. It is the\ngreatest place in the world for beautiful flowers. The walks around the\ncity are superb; and the 'Wood' with its miles of noble elms, all in\nfull feather, is something to remember. You need not smile, old fellow,\nat my saying 'full feather'--I was thinking of waving plumes, and got my\nwords mixed up a little. But a Dutch elm beats everything; it is the\nnoblest tree on earth, Ben--if you except the English oak----\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Ben, solemnly, \"_if_ you except the English oak\"--and for\nsome moments he could scarcely see the canal because Robby and Jenny\nkept bobbing in the air before his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nFRIENDS IN NEED\n\n\nMeantime, the other boys were listening to Peter's account of an\nincident which had long ago occurred[22] in a part of the city where\nstood an ancient castle, whose lord had tyrannized over the burghers of\nthe town to such an extent, that they surrounded his castle, and laid\nsiege to it. Just at the last extremity, when the haughty lord felt that\nhe could hold out no longer, and was preparing to sell his life as\ndearly as possible, his lady appeared on the ramparts, and offered to\nsurrender everything, provided she was permitted to bring out, and\nretain, as much of her most precious household goods as she could carry\nupon her back. The promise was given--and forth came the lady from the\ngateway bearing her husband upon her shoulders. The burghers' pledge\npreserved him from the fury of the troops, but left them free to wreak\ntheir vengeance upon the castle.\n\n[Footnote 22: Sir Thomas Carr's Tour through Holland.]\n\n\"Do you _believe_ that story, Captain Peter?\" asked Carl, in an\nincredulous tone.\n\n\"Of course, I do; it is historical. Why should I doubt it?\"\n\n\"Simply because no woman could do it--and, if she could, she wouldn't.\nThat is _my_ opinion.\"\n\n\"And _I_ believe there are many who _would_.--That is, to save any one\nthey really cared for,\" said Ludwig.\n\nJacob, who in spite of his fat and sleepiness, was of rather a\nsentimental turn, had listened with deep interest.\n\n\"That is right, little fellow,\" he said, nodding his head approvingly.\n\"I believe every word of it. I shall never marry a woman who would not\nbe glad to do as much for _me_.\"\n\n\"Heaven help her!\" cried Carl, turning to gaze at the speaker; \"why,\nPoot, three _men_ couldn't do it!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Jacob quietly--feeling that he had asked rather too\nmuch of the future Mrs. Poot. \"But she must be _willing_, that is all.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" responded Peter's cheery voice, \"willing heart makes nimble\nfoot--and who knows, but it may make strong arms also.\"\n\n\"Pete,\" asked Ludwig, changing the subject, \"did you tell me last night\nthat the painter Wouvermans was born in Haarlem?\"\n\n\"Yes, and Jacob Ruysdael and Berghem too. I like Berghem because he was\nalways good-natured--they say he always sang while he painted, and\nthough he died nearly two hundred years ago, there are traditions still\nafloat concerning his pleasant laugh. He was a great painter, and he had\na wife as cross as Xantippe.\"\n\n\"They balanced each other finely,\" said Ludwig; \"he was kind and she was\ncross. But, Peter, before I forget it, wasn't that picture of St. Hubert\nand the Horse painted by Wouvermans? You remember father showed us an\nengraving from it last night.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; there is a story connected with that picture.\"\n\n\"Tell us!\" cried two or three, drawing closer to Peter as they skated\non.\n\n\"Wouvermans,\" began the captain, oratorically, \"was born in 1620, just\nfour years before Berghem. He was a master of his art, and especially\nexcelled in painting horses. Strange as it may seem, people were so long\nfinding out his merits, that, even after he had arrived at the height of\nhis excellence, he was obliged to sell his pictures for very paltry\nprices. The poor artist became completely discouraged, and, worse than\nall, was over head and ears in debt. One day he was talking over his\ntroubles with his father-confessor, who was one of the few who\nrecognized his genius. The priest determined to assist him, and\naccordingly lent him six hundred guilders, advising him at the same time\nto demand a better price for his pictures. Wouvermans did so, and in the\nmeantime paid his debts. Matters brightened with him at once. Everybody\nappreciated the great artist who painted such costly pictures. He grew\nrich. The six hundred guilders were returned, and in gratitude,\nWouvermans sent also a work which he had painted, representing his\nbenefactor as St. Hubert kneeling before his horse--the very picture,\nLudwig, of which we were speaking last night.\"\n\n\"So! so!\" exclaimed Ludwig, with deep interest. \"I must take another\nlook at the engraving as soon as we get home.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that same hour, while Ben was skating with his companions beside the\nHolland dyke, Robby and Jenny stood in their pretty English schoolhouse,\nready to join in the duties of their reading class.\n\n\"Commence! Master Robert Dobbs,\" said the teacher, \"page 242; now, sir,\nmind every stop.\"\n\nAnd Robby, in a quick childish voice, roared forth at schoolroom pitch:\n\n\n\"LESSON 62.--THE HERO OF HAARLEM.\n\n\"Many years ago, there lived in Haarlem, one of the principal cities of\nHolland, a sunny-haired boy, of gentle disposition. His father was a\n_sluicer_, that is, a man whose business it was to open and close the\nsluices, or large oaken gates, that are placed at regular distances\nacross the entrances of the canals, to regulate the amount of water that\nshall flow into them.\n\n\"The sluicer raises the gates more or less according to the quantity of\nwater required, and closes them carefully at night, in order to avoid\nall possible danger of an over supply running into the canal, or the\nwater would soon overflow it and inundate the surrounding country. As a\ngreat portion of Holland is lower than the level of the sea, the waters\nare kept from flooding the land, only by means of strong dykes, or\nbarriers, and by means of these sluices, which are often strained to the\nutmost by the pressure of the rising tides. Even the little children in\nHolland know that constant watchfulness is required to keep the rivers\nand ocean from overwhelming the country, and that a moment's neglect of\nthe sluicer's duty may bring ruin and death to all.\"\n\n[\"Very good,\" said the teacher; \"now, Susan.\"]\n\n\"One lovely autumn afternoon, when the boy was about eight years old, he\nobtained his parents' consent to carry some cakes to a blind man who\nlived out in the country, on the other side of the dyke. The little\nfellow started on his errand with a light heart, and having spent an\nhour with his grateful old friend, he bade him farewell and started on\nhis homeward walk.\n\n\"Trudging stoutly along by the canal, he noticed how the autumn rains\nhad swollen the waters. Even while humming his careless, childish song,\nhe thought of his father's brave old gates and felt glad of their\nstrength, for thought he, 'if _they_ gave way, where would father and\nmother be? These pretty fields would be all covered with the angry\nwaters--father always calls them the _angry_ waters; I suppose he thinks\nthey are mad at him for keeping them out so long.' And with these\nthoughts just flitting across his brain, the little fellow stooped to\npick the pretty blue flowers that grew along his way. Sometimes he\nstopped to throw some feathery seed-ball in the air, and watch it as it\nfloated away; sometimes he listened to the stealthy rustling of a\nrabbit, speeding through the grass, but oftener he smiled as he recalled\nthe happy light he had seen arise on the weary, listening face of his\nblind old friend.\"\n\n[\"Now, Henry,\" said the teacher, nodding to the next little reader.]\n\n\"Suddenly the boy looked around him in dismay. He had not noticed that\nthe sun was setting: now he saw that his long shadow on the grass had\nvanished. It was growing dark, he was still some distance from home, and\nin a lonely ravine, where even the blue flowers had turned to gray. He\nquickened his foot-steps; and with a beating heart recalled many a\nnursery tale of children belated in dreary forests. Just as he was\nbracing himself for a run, he was startled by the sound of trickling\nwater. Whence did it come? He looked up and saw a small hole in the dyke\nthrough which a tiny stream was flowing. Any child in Holland will\nshudder at the thought of a _leak in the dyke_! The boy understood the\ndanger at a glance. That little hole, if the water were allowed to\ntrickle through, would soon be a large one, and a terrible inundation\nwould be the result.\n\n\"Quick as a flash, he saw his duty. Throwing away his flowers, the boy\nclambered up the heights, until he reached the hole. His chubby little\nfinger was thrust in, almost before he knew it. The flowing was stopped!\n'Ah!' he thought, with a chuckle of boyish delight, 'the angry waters\nmust stay back now! Haarlem shall not be drowned while _I_ am here!'\n\n\"This was all very well at first, but the night was falling rapidly;\nchill vapors filled the air. Our little hero began to tremble with cold\nand dread. He shouted loudly; he screamed 'Come here! come here!' but no\none came. The cold grew more intense, a numbness, commencing in the\ntired little finger, crept over his hand and arm, and soon his whole\nbody was filled with pain. He shouted again, 'Will no one come? Mother!\nmother!' Alas, his mother, good, practical soul, had already locked the\ndoors, and had fully resolved to scold him on the morrow, for spending\nthe night with blind Jansen without her permission. He tried to whistle;\nperhaps some straggling boy might heed the signal; but his teeth\nchattered so, it was impossible. Then he called on God for help; and the\nanswer came, through a holy resolution--'I will stay here till\nmorning.'\"\n\n[\"Now, Jenny Dobbs,\" said the teacher. Jenny's eyes were glistening, but\nshe took a long breath and commenced:]\n\n\"The midnight moon looked down upon that small solitary form, sitting\nupon a stone, half-way up the dyke. His head was bent but he was not\nasleep, for every now and then one restless hand rubbed feebly the\nout-stretched arm that seemed fastened to the dyke--and often the pale,\ntearful face turned quickly at some real or fancied sounds.\n\n\"How can we know the sufferings of that long and fearful watch--what\nfalterings of purpose, what childish terrors came over the boy as he\nthought of the warm little bed at home, of his parents, his brothers and\nsisters, then looked into the cold, dreary night!\n\n\"If he drew away that tiny finger, the angry waters, grown angrier\nstill, would rush forth, and never stop until they had swept over the\ntown. No, he would hold it there till daylight--if he lived! He was not\nvery sure of living. What did this strange buzzing mean? and then the\nknives that seemed pricking and piercing him from head to foot? He was\nnot certain now that he could draw his finger away, even if he wished\nto.\n\n\"At daybreak a clergyman, returning from the bed-side of a sick\nparishioner, thought he heard groans as he walked along on the top of\nthe dyke. Bending, he saw, far down on the side, a child apparently\nwrithing with pain.\n\n\"'In the name of wonder, boy,' he exclaimed, 'what are you doing there?'\n\n\"'I am keeping the water from running out,' was the simple answer of the\nlittle hero. 'Tell them to come quick.'\n\n\"It is needless to add that they did come quickly and that----\"\n\n[\"Jenny Dobbs,\" said the teacher, rather impatiently, \"if you cannot\ncontrol your feelings so as to read distinctly, we will wait until you\nrecover yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Jenny, quite startled.]\n\nIt was strange; but at that very moment, Ben, far over the sea, was\nsaying to Lambert:\n\n\"The noble little fellow! I have frequently met with an account of the\nincident, but I never knew, till now, that it was really true.\"\n\n\"True! Of course it is,\" said Lambert, kindling. \"I have given you the\nstory just as mother told it to me, years ago. Why, there is not a child\nin Holland who does not know it. And, Ben, you may not think so, but\nthat little boy represents the spirit of the whole country. Not a leak\ncan show itself anywhere either in its politics, honor, or public\nsafety, that a million fingers are not ready to stop it, at any cost.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" cried Master Ben, \"big talking that!\"\n\n\"It's _true_ talk anyway,\" rejoined Lambert, so very quietly that Ben\nwisely resolved to make no further comment.\n\n[Illustration: _The ice seemed fairly alive_]\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nON THE CANAL\n\n\nThe skating season had commenced unusually early; our boys were by no\nmeans alone upon the ice. The afternoon was so fine, that men, women,\nand children, bent upon enjoying the holiday, had flocked to the grand\ncanal from far and near. Saint Nicholas had evidently remembered the\nfavorite pastime; shining new skates were everywhere to be seen. Whole\nfamilies were skimming their way to Haarlem or Leyden or the neighboring\nvillages. The ice seemed fairly alive. Ben noticed the erect, easy\ncarriage of the women, and their picturesque variety of costume. There\nwere the latest fashions, fresh from Paris, floating past dingy,\nmoth-eaten garments that had seen service through two generations;\ncoal-scuttle bonnets perched over freckled faces bright with holiday\nsmiles; stiff muslin caps, with wings at the sides, flapping beside\ncheeks rosy with health and contentment; furs, too, encircling the\nwhitest of throats; and scanty garments fluttering below faces ruddy\nwith exercise--In short every quaint and comical mixture of dry-goods\nand flesh that Holland could furnish, seemed sent to enliven the scene.\n\nThere were belles from Leyden, and fishwives from the border villages;\ncheese women from Gouda, and prim matrons from beautiful country-seats\non the Haarlemmer Meer. Gray-headed skaters were constantly to be seen;\nwrinkled old women, with baskets upon their heads; and plump little\ntoddlers on skates clutching at their mother's gowns. Some women\ncarried their babies upon their backs, firmly secured with a bright\nshawl. The effect was pretty and graceful as they darted by, or sailed\nslowly past, now nodding to an acquaintance, now chirruping, and\nthrowing soft baby-talk, to the muffled little ones they carried.\n\nBoys and girls were chasing each other, and hiding behind the one-horse\nsleds, that, loaded high with peat or timber, pursued their cautious way\nalong the track marked out as \"safe.\" Beautiful, queenly women were\nthere, enjoyment sparkling in their quiet eyes. Sometimes a long file of\nyoung men, each grasping the coat of the one before him, flew by with\nelectric speed; and sometimes the ice squeaked under the chair of some\ngorgeous old dowager, or rich burgomaster's lady--who, very red in the\nnose, and sharp in the eyes, looked like a scare-thaw invented by old\nfather Winter for the protection of his skating grounds. The chair would\nbe heavy with footstoves and cushions, to say nothing of the old lady.\nMounted upon shining runners it slid along, pushed by the sleepiest of\nservants, who, looking neither to the right nor the left, bent himself\nto his task while she cast direful glances upon the screaming little\nrowdies who invariably acted as body-guard.\n\nAs for the men, they were pictures of placid enjoyment. Some were\nattired in ordinary citizen's dress; but many looked odd enough with\ntheir short woolen coats, wide breeches, and big silver buckles. These\nseemed to Ben like little boys who had, by a miracle, sprung suddenly\ninto manhood, and were forced to wear garments that their astonished\nmothers had altered in a hurry. He noticed, too, that nearly all the men\nhad pipes, as they passed him whizzing and smoking like so many\nlocomotives. There was every variety of pipes from those of common clay\nto the most expensive meerschaums mounted in silver and gold. Some were\ncarved into extraordinary and fantastic shapes, representing birds,\nflowers, heads, bugs, and dozens of other things; some resembled the\n\"Dutchman's pipe\" that grows in our American woods; some were red, and\nmany were of a pure snowy white; but the most respectable were those\nwhich were ripening into a shaded brown--The deeper and richer the\nbrown, of course the more honored the pipe, for it was a proof that the\nowner, if honestly shading it, was deliberately devoting his manhood to\nthe effort--What pipe would not be proud to be the object of such a\nsacrifice!\n\nFor a while, Ben skated on in silence. There was so much to engage his\nattention that he almost forgot his companions. Part of the time he had\nbeen watching the ice-boats as they flew over the great Haarlemmer Meer\n(or Lake), the frozen surface of which was now plainly visible from the\ncanal. These boats had very large sails, much larger, in proportion,\nthan those of ordinary vessels, and were set upon a triangular frame\nfurnished with an iron \"runner\" at each corner,--the widest part of the\ntriangle crossing the bow, and its point stretching beyond the stern.\nThey had rudders for guiding, and brakes for arresting their progress;\nand were of all sizes and kinds, from small, rough affairs managed by a\nboy, to large and beautiful ones filled with gay pleasure parties, and\nmanned by competent sailors, who smoking their stumpy pipes, reefed and\ntacked and steered with great solemnity and precision.\n\nSome of the boats were painted and gilded in gaudy style and flaunted\ngay pennons from their mastheads; others white as snow, with every\nspotless sail rounded by the wind, looked like swans borne onward by a\nresistless current. It seemed to Ben as, following his fancy, he watched\none of these in the distance, that he could almost hear its helpless,\nterrified cry, but he soon found that the sound arose from a nearer and\nless romantic cause--from an ice-boat not fifty yards from him, using\nits brakes to avoid a collision with a peat-sled.\n\nIt was a rare thing for these boats to be upon the canal and their\nappearance generally caused no little excitement among skaters,\nespecially among the timid; but to-day every ice-boat in the country\nseemed afloat or rather aslide, and the canal had its full share.\n\nBen, though delighted at the sight, was often startled at the swift\napproach of the resistless, high-winged things threatening to dart in\nany and every possible direction. It required all his energies to keep\nout of the way of the passers-by, and to prevent those screaming little\nurchins from upsetting him with their sleds. Once he halted to watch\nsome boys who were making a hole in the ice preparatory to using their\nfishing spears. Just as he concluded to start again, he found himself\nsuddenly bumped into an old lady's lap. Her push chair had come upon him\nfrom the rear. The old lady screamed, the servant who was propelling her\ngave a warning hiss--In another instant Ben found himself apologizing to\nempty air; the indignant old lady was far ahead.\n\nThis was a slight mishap compared with one that now threatened him. A\nhuge ice-boat, under full sail, came tearing down the canal, almost\nparalyzing Ben with the thought of instant destruction. It was close\nupon him! He saw its gilded prow, heard the schipper shout, felt the\ngreat boom fairly whizz over his head, was blind, deaf and dumb all in\nan instant, then opened his eyes, to find himself spinning some yards\nbehind its great, skate-like rudder. It had passed within an inch of his\nshoulder, but he was safe! safe to see England again, safe to kiss the\ndear faces that for an instant had flashed before him one by\none--father, mother, Robby and Jenny--that great boom had dashed their\nimages into his very soul. He knew now how much he loved them. Perhaps\nthis knowledge made him face complacently the scowls of those on the\ncanal who seemed to feel that a boy in danger was necessarily a _bad_\nboy needing instant reprimand.\n\nLambert chided him roundly.\n\n\"I thought it was all over with you, you careless fellow! Why don't you\nlook where you are going? Not content with sitting on all the old\nladies' laps, you must make a Juggernaut of every ice-boat that comes\nalong. We shall have to hand you over to the aanspreekers yet, if you\ndon't look out!\"\n\n\"Please don't,\" said Ben, with mock humility--then seeing how pale\nLambert's lips were, added in a low tone:\n\n\"I do believe I _thought_ more in that one moment, Van Mounen, than in\nall the rest of my past life.\"\n\nThere was no reply, and, for a while, the two boys skated on in silence.\n\nSoon a faint sound of distant bells reached their ears.\n\n\"Hark!\" said Ben, \"what is that?\"\n\n\"The carillons,\" replied Lambert. \"They are trying the bells in the\nchapel of yonder village. Ah! Ben, you should hear the chimes of the\n'New Church' at Delft; they are superb--nearly five hundred sweet-toned\nbells, and one of the best carilloneurs of Holland to play upon them.\nHard work, though; they say the fellow often has to go to bed from\npositive exhaustion, after his performances. You see, the bells are\nattached to a kind of keyboard, something like they have on\npiano-fortes; there are also a set of pedals for the feet; when a brisk\ntune is going on, the player looks like a kicking frog fastened to his\nseat with a skewer.\"\n\n\"For shame,\" said Ben, indignantly.\n\nPeter had, for the present, exhausted his stock of Haarlem anecdotes,\nand now, having nothing to do but to skate, he and his three companions\nwere hastening to \"catch up\" with Lambert and Ben.\n\n\"That English lad is fleet enough,\" said Peter; \"if he were a born\nHollander he could do no better. Generally these John Bulls make but a\nsorry figure on skates--Hollo! Here you are, Van Mounen; why, we hardly\nhoped for the honor of meeting you again. Who were you flying from in\nsuch haste?\"\n\n\"Snails,\" retorted Lambert. \"What kept you?\"\n\n\"We have been talking--and, beside, we halted once to give Poot a chance\nto rest.\"\n\n\"He begins to look rather worn out,\" said Lambert in a low voice.\n\nJust then a beautiful ice-boat with reefed sail, and flying streamers,\nswept leisurely by. Its deck was filled with children muffled up to\ntheir chins. Looking at them from the ice you could see only smiling\nlittle faces imbedded in bright-colored, woolen wrappings. They were\nsinging a chorus in honor of Saint Nicholas. The music, starting in the\ndiscord of a hundred childish voices, floated, as it rose, into\nexquisite harmony:\n\n     Friend of sailors, and of children!\n       Double claim have we,\n     As in youthful joy we're sailing,\n       O'er a frozen sea!\n                     Nicholas! Saint Nicholas!\n                         Let us sing to thee.\n\n     While through Wintry air we're rushing,\n       As our voices blend,\n     Are you near us? Do you hear us,\n       Nicholas, our friend?\n                     Nicholas! Saint Nicholas!\n                         Love can never end.\n\n     Sunny sparkles, bright before us,\n       Chase away the cold!\n     Hearts where sunny thoughts are welcome\n       Never can grow old--\n                     Nicholas! Saint Nicholas!--\n                         Never can grow old!\n\n     Pretty gift and loving lesson,\n       Festival and glee,\n     Bid us thank thee as we're sailing\n       O'er the frozen sea--\n                     Nicholas! Saint Nicholas!\n                         So we sing to thee!\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nJACOB POOT CHANGES THE PLAN\n\n\nThe last note died away in the distance. Our boys, who in their vain\nefforts to keep up with the boat, had felt that they were skating\nbackward, turned to look at one another.\n\n\"How beautiful that was!\" exclaimed Van Mounen.\n\n\"Just like a dream!\" said Ludwig.\n\nJacob drew close to Ben, giving his usual approving nod, as he spoke:\n\n\"Dat ish goot. Dat ish te pest vay--I shay petter to take to Leyden mit\na poat!\"\n\n\"Take a boat!\" exclaimed Ben, in dismay--\"why, man, our plan was to\n_skate_, not to be carried like little children----\"\n\n\"Tuyfels!\" retorted Jacob, \"dat ish no little--no papies--to go for\npoat!\"\n\nThe boys laughed, but exchanged uneasy glances. It would be great fun to\njump on an ice-boat, if they had a chance; but to abandon so shamefully\ntheir grand undertaking--Who could think of such a thing?\n\nAn animated discussion arose at once.\n\nCaptain Peter brought his party to a halt.\n\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"it strikes me that we should consult Jacob's wishes in\nthis matter. He started the excursion, you know.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" sneered Carl, throwing a contemptuous glance at Jacob, \"who's\ntired? We can rest all night at Leyden.\"\n\nLudwig and Lambert looked anxious and disappointed. It was no slight\nthing to lose the credit of having skated all the way from Broek to the\nHague, and back again; but both agreed that Jacob should decide the\nquestion.\n\nGood-natured, tired Jacob! He read the popular sentiment at a glance.\n\n\"Oh! no,\" he said, in Dutch. \"I was joking. We will skate, of course.\"\n\nThe boys gave a delighted shout, and started on again with renewed\nvigor--\n\nAll but Jacob. He tried his best not to seem fatigued, and, by not\nsaying a word, saved his breath and energy for the great business of\nskating. But in vain. Before long, the stout body grew heavier and\nheavier--the tottering limbs weaker and weaker. Worse than all, the\nblood, anxious to get far as possible from the ice, mounted to the\npuffy, good-natured cheeks, and made the roots of his thin, yellow hair\nglow into a fiery red.\n\nThis kind of work is apt to summon Vertigo, of whom good Hans Andersen\nwrites--the same who hurls daring young hunters from the mountains, or\nspins them from the sharpest heights of the glaciers, or catches them as\nthey tread the stepping-stones of the mountain torrent.\n\nVertigo came, unseen, to Jacob. After tormenting him a while, with one\ntouch sending a chill from head to foot, with the next, scorching every\nvein with fever, she made the canal rock and tremble beneath him, the\nwhite sails bow and spin as they passed, then cast him heavily upon the\nice.\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried Van Mounen. \"There goes Poot!\"\n\nBen sprang hastily forward.\n\n\"Jacob! Jacob, are you hurt?\"\n\nPeter and Carl were lifting him. The face was white enough now. It\nseemed like a dead face--even the good-natured look was gone.\n\nA crowd collected. Peter unbuttoned the poor boy's jacket, loosened his\nred tippet, and blew between the parted lips.\n\n\"Stand off, good people!\" he cried, \"give him air!\"\n\n\"Lay him down,\" called out a woman from the crowd.\n\n\"Stand him upon his feet,\" shouted another.\n\n\"Give him wine,\" growled a stout fellow who was driving a loaded sled.\n\n\"Yes! yes, give him wine!\" echoed everybody.\n\nLudwig and Lambert shouted in concert:\n\n\"Wine! wine! Who has wine!\"\n\nA sleepy-eyed Dutchman began to fumble mysteriously under the heaviest\nof blue jackets, saying as he did so:\n\n\"Not so much noise, young masters, not so much noise! The boy was a fool\nto faint off like a girl.\"\n\n\"Wine, quick!\" cried Peter who, with Ben's help, was rubbing Jacob from\nhead to foot.\n\nLudwig stretched forth his hand imploringly toward the Dutchman, who\nwith an air of great importance was still fumbling beneath the jacket.\n\n\"_Do_ hurry! He will die! Has any one else any wine?\"\n\n\"He _is_ dead!\" said an awful voice from among the bystanders.\n\nThis startled the Dutchman.\n\n\"Have a care!\" he said, reluctantly drawing forth a small blue flask,\n\"this is schnaps. A little is enough.\"\n\nA little _was_ enough. The paleness gave way to a faint flush. Jacob\nopened his eyes, and--half bewildered, half ashamed,--feebly tried to\nfree himself from those who were supporting him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no alternative, now, for our party but to have their exhausted\ncomrade carried, in some way, to Leyden. As for expecting him to skate\nany more that day, the thing was impossible. In truth, by this time each\nboy began to entertain secret yearnings toward ice-boats, and to avow a\nSpartan resolve not to desert Jacob. Fortunately a gentle, steady breeze\nwas setting southward. If some accommodating schipper[23] would but come\nalong, matters would not be quite so bad after all.\n\n[Footnote 23: Skipper. Master of a small trading vessel,--a\npleasure-boat or ice-boat.]\n\nPeter hailed the first sail that appeared; the men in the stern would\nnot even look at him. Three drays on runners came along, but they were\nalready loaded to the utmost. Then an ice-boat, a beautiful, tempting\nlittle one, whizzed past like an arrow. The boys had just time to stare\neagerly at it when it was gone. In despair, they resolved to prop up\nJacob with their strong arms, as well as they could, and take him to the\nnearest village.\n\nAt that moment a very shabby ice-boat came in sight. With but little\nhope of success, Peter hailed it, at the same time taking off his hat\nand flourishing it in the air.\n\nThe sail was lowered, then came the scraping sound of the brake, and a\npleasant voice called out from the deck:\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"Will you take us on?\" cried Peter hurrying with his companions as fast\nas he could, for the boat was \"bringing to\" some distance ahead, \"will\nyou take us on?\"\n\n\"We'll pay for the ride!\" shouted Carl.\n\nThe man on board scarcely noticed him except to mutter something about\nits not being a trekschuit. Still looking toward Peter he asked:\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Six.\"\n\n\"Well, it's Nicholas' day--up with you! Young gentleman sick?\" (nodding\ntoward Jacob).\n\n\"Yes--broken down--skated all the way from Broek,\" answered Peter--\"Do\nyou go to Leyden?\"\n\n\"That's as the wind says--It's blowing that way now--Scramble up!\"\n\nPoor Jacob! if that willing Mrs. Poot had only appeared just then, her\nservices would have been invaluable. It was as much as the boys could do\nto hoist him into the boat. All were in at last. The schipper, puffing\naway at his pipe, let out the sail, lifted the brake, and sat in the\nstern with folded arms.\n\n\"Whew! How fast we go!\" cried Ben. \"This is something like! Feel better,\nJacob?\"\n\n\"Much petter, I tanks you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll be as good as new in ten minutes. This makes a fellow feel\nlike a bird.\"\n\nJacob nodded, and blinked his eyes.\n\n\"Don't go to sleep, Jacob; it's too cold. You might never wake up, you\nknow. Persons often freeze to death in that way.\"\n\n\"I no sleep,\" said Jacob confidently--and in two minutes he was snoring.\n\nCarl and Ludwig laughed.\n\n\"We must wake him!\" cried Ben; \"it is dangerous, I tell you,--Jacob!\nJa-a-c----\"\n\nCaptain Peter interfered, for three of the boys were helping Ben for the\nfun of the thing.\n\n\"Nonsense! don't shake him! Let him alone, boys. One never snores like\nthat when one's freezing. Cover him up with something. Here, this cloak\nwill do; hey, schipper?\" and he looked toward the stern for permission\nto use it.\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"There,\" said Peter, tenderly adjusting the garment, \"let him sleep. He\nwill be frisky as a lamb when he wakes. How far are we from Leyden,\nschipper?\"\n\n\"Not more'n a couple of pipes,\" replied a voice, rising from smoke like\nthe genii in fairy tales (puff! puff!), \"likely not more'n one an' a\nhalf (puff! puff!) if this wind holds!\" (puff! puff! puff!).\n\n\"What is the man saying, Lambert?\" asked Ben, who was holding his\nmittened hands against his cheeks to ward off the cutting air.\n\n\"He says we're about two pipes from Leyden. Half the boors here on the\ncanal measure distances by the time it takes them to finish a pipe.\"\n\n\"How ridiculous.\"\n\n\"See here, Benjamin Dobbs,\" retorted Lambert, growing unaccountably\nindignant at Ben's quiet smile; \"see here, you've a way of calling every\nother thing you see on _this_ side of the German ocean, 'ridiculous.' It\nmay suit _you_, this word, but it don't suit _me_. When you want\nanything ridiculous just remember your English custom of making the Lord\nMayor of London, at his installation, count the nails in a horseshoe to\nprove _his learning_.\"\n\n\"Who told you we had any such custom as that?\" cried Ben, looking grave\nin an instant.\n\n\"Why, I _know_ it, no use of any one telling me. It's in all the\nbooks--and it's true. It strikes me,\" continued Lambert, laughing in\nspite of himself, \"that you have been kept in happy ignorance of a good\nmany ridiculous things on _your_ side of the map.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" exclaimed Ben, trying not to smile. \"I'll inquire into that\nLord Mayor business when I get home. There must be some mistake.\nB-r-r-roooo! How fast we're going. This is glorious!\"\n\nIt was a grand sail, or ride, I scarce know which to call it; perhaps\n\"fly\" would be the best word; for the boys felt very much as Sinbad did\nwhen, tied to the roc's leg, he darted through the clouds; or as\nBellerophon felt when he shot through the air on the back of his winged\nhorse Pegasus.\n\nSailing, riding, or flying, whichever it was, everything was rushing\npast, backward--and, before they had time to draw a long breath, Leyden\nitself, with its high peaked-roofs, flew half-way to meet them.\n\nWhen the city came in sight it was high time to waken the sleeper. That\nfeat accomplished, Peter's prophecy came to pass. Master Jacob was quite\nrestored and in excellent spirits.\n\nThe schipper made a feeble remonstrance when Peter, with hearty thanks,\nendeavored to slip some silver pieces into his tough, brown palm.\n\n\"Ye see, young master,\" said he, drawing away his hand, \"the regular\nline o' trade's _one_ thing, and a favor's another.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Peter, \"but those boys and girls of yours will want\nsweets when you get home. Buy them some in the name of Saint Nicholas.\"\n\nThe man grinned. \"Aye, true enough, I've young 'uns in plenty, a clean\nboat-load of them. You are a sharp young master at guessing.\"\n\nThis time, the knotty hand hitched forward again, quite carelessly, it\nseemed, but its palm was upward. Peter hastily dropped in the money and\nmoved away.\n\nThe sail soon came tumbling down. Scrape, scrape went the brake,\nscattering an ice shower round the boat.\n\n\"Good-bye, schipper!\" shouted the boys, seizing their skates and leaping\nfrom the deck one by one, \"many thanks to you!\"\n\n\"Good-bye! good-b----Hold! here! stop! I want my coat.\"\n\nBen was carefully assisting his cousin over the side of the boat.\n\n\"What is the man shouting about? Oh, I know, you have his wrapper round\nyour shoulders!\"\n\n\"Dat ish true,\" answered Jacob, half jumping, half tumbling down upon\nthe framework, \"dat ish vot make him sho heavy.\"\n\n\"Made _you_ so heavy, you mean, Poot?\"\n\n\"Ya, made you sho heavy--dat ish true,\" said Jacob innocently, as he\nworked himself free from the big wrapper; \"dere, now you hands it mit\nhim straits way and tells him I voz much tanks for dat.\"\n\n\"Ho! for an inn!\" cried Peter, as they stepped into the city. \"Be brisk,\nmy fine fellows!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nMYNHEER KLEEF AND HIS BILL OF FARE\n\n\nThe boys soon found an unpretending establishment near the Breedstraat\n(Broad Street) with a funnily painted lion over the door. This was the\nROODE LEEUW or Red Lion, kept by one Huygens Kleef, a stout Dutchman\nwith short legs and a very long pipe.\n\nBy this time they were in a ravenous condition. The tiffin, taken at\nHaarlem, had served only to give them an appetite, and this had been\nheightened by their exercise, and swift sail upon the canal.\n\n\"Come, mine host! give us what you can!\" cried Peter rather pompously.\n\n\"I can give you anything--everything,\" answered Mynheer Kleef,\nperforming a difficult bow.\n\n\"Well, give us sausage and pudding.\"\n\n\"Ah, mynheer, the sausage is all gone. There is no pudding.\"\n\n\"Salmagundi, then, and plenty of it.\"\n\n\"That is out also, young master.\"\n\n\"Eggs, and be quick.\"\n\n\"Winter eggs are _very_ poor eating,\" answered the innkeeper, puckering\nhis lips, and lifting his eyebrows.\n\n\"No eggs? well--Caviare.\"\n\nThe Dutchman raised his fat hands:\n\n\"Caviare! That is made of gold! Who has caviare to sell?\"\n\nPeter had sometimes eaten it at home; he knew that it was made of the\nroes of the sturgeon, and certain other large fish, but he had no idea\nof its cost.\n\n\"Well, mine host, what have you?\"\n\n\"What have I? Everything. I have rye-bread, sour-krout, potato-salad and\nthe fattest herring in Leyden.\"\n\n\"What do you say, boys?\" asked the captain; \"will that do?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried the famished youths, \"if he'll only be quick.\"\n\nMynheer moved off like one walking in his sleep, but soon opened his\neyes wide at the miraculous manner in which his herring were made to\ndisappear. Next came, or rather went, potato-salad, rye-bread and\ncoffee--then Utrecht water flavored with orange, and, finally, slices of\ndry gingerbread. This last delicacy was not on the regular bill of fare;\nbut Mynheer Kleef, driven to extremes, solemnly produced it from his own\nprivate stores, and gave only a placid blink when his voracious young\ntravelers started up, declaring they had eaten enough.\n\n\"I should think so!\" he exclaimed internally, but his smooth face gave\nno sign.\n\nSoftly rubbing his hands, he asked:\n\n\"Will your worships have beds?\"\n\n\"Will your worships have beds?\" mocked Carl--\"what do you mean? Do we\nlook sleepy?\"\n\n\"Not at all, master; but I would cause them to be warmed and aired. None\nsleep under damp sheets at the Red Lion.\"\n\n\"Ah, I understand. Shall we come back here to sleep, captain?\"\n\nPeter was accustomed to finer lodgings; but this was a frolic.\n\n\"Why not?\" he replied; \"we can fare excellently here.\"\n\n\"Your worship speaks only the truth,\" said mynheer with great deference.\n\n\"How fine to be called 'your worship,'\" laughed Ludwig aside to Lambert,\nwhile Peter replied:\n\n\"Well, mine host, you may get the rooms ready by nine.\"\n\n\"I have one beautiful chamber, with three beds, that will hold all of\nyour worships,\" said Mynheer Kleef coaxingly.\n\n\"That will do.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled Carl when they reached the street.\n\nLudwig started. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Nothing--only Mynheer Kleef of the Red Lion little thinks how we shall\nmake things spin in that same room to-night--We'll set the bolsters\nflying!\"\n\n\"Order!\" cried the captain. \"Now, boys, I must seek this great Dr.\nBoekman before I sleep. If he is in Leyden it will be no great task to\nfind him, for he always puts up at the Golden Eagle when he comes here.\nI wonder that you did not all go to bed at once--Still, as you are\nawake, what say you to walking with Ben up by the Museum or the\nStadhuis?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Ludwig and Lambert; but Jacob preferred to go with Peter.\nIn vain Ben tried to persuade him to remain at the Inn and rest. He\ndeclared that he never felt \"petter,\" and wished of all things to take a\nlook at the city, for it was his first \"stop mit Leyden.\"\n\n\"Oh, it will not harm him,\" said Lambert. \"How long the day has\nbeen--and what glorious sport we have had. It hardly seems possible that\nwe left Broek only this morning.\"\n\nJacob yawned.\n\n\"I have enjoyed it well,\" he said, \"but it seems to me at least a week\nsince we started.\"\n\nCarl laughed, and muttered something about \"twenty naps----\"\n\n\"Here we are at the corner; remember, we all meet at the Red Lion at\neight,\" said the captain, as he and Jacob walked away.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nTHE RED LION BECOMES DANGEROUS\n\n\nThe boys were glad to find a blazing fire awaiting them upon their\nreturn to the \"Red Lion.\" Carl and his party were there first. Soon\nafterward Peter and Jacob came in. They had inquired in vain concerning\nDr. Boekman. All they could ascertain was that he had been seen in\nHaarlem that morning.\n\n\"As for his being in Leyden,\" the landlord of the Golden Eagle had said\nto Peter, \"the thing is impossible. He always lodges here when in town.\nBy this time there would be a crowd at my door waiting to consult\nhim--Bah! people make such fools of themselves!\"\n\n\"He is called a great surgeon,\" said Peter.\n\n\"Yes, the greatest in Holland. But what of that? What of being the\ngreatest pill-choker and knife-slasher in the world? The man is a bear.\nOnly last month on this very spot, he called me _a pig_, before three\ncustomers!\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Peter, trying to look surprised and indignant.\n\n\"Yes, master--A PIG,\" repeated the landlord, puffing at his pipe with an\ninjured air. \"Bah! if he did not pay fine prices and bring customers to\nmy house I would sooner see him in the Vliet canal than give him\nlodgment.\"\n\nPerhaps mine host felt that he was speaking too openly to a stranger, or\nit may be he saw a smile lurking in Peter's face, for he added sharply:\n\n\"Come, now, what more do you wish? Supper? Beds?\"\n\n\"No, mynheer, I am but searching for Dr. Boekman.\"\n\n\"Go find him. He is not in Leyden.\"\n\nPeter was not to be put off so easily. After receiving a few more rough\nwords, he succeeded in obtaining permission to leave a note for the\nfamous surgeon, or rather, he _bought_ from his amiable landlord the\nprivilege of writing it there, and a promise that it should be promptly\ndelivered when Dr. Boekman arrived. This accomplished, Peter and Jacob\nreturned to the \"Red Lion.\"\n\nThis inn had once been a fine house, the home of a rich burgher; but,\nhaving grown old and shabby, it had passed through many hands, until\nfinally it had fallen into the possession of Mynheer Kleef. He was fond\nof saying as he looked up at its dingy, broken walls--\"mend it, and\npaint it, and there's not a prettier house in Leyden.\" It stood six\nstories high from the street. The first three were of equal breadth but\nof various heights, the last three were in the great, high roof, and\ngrew smaller and smaller like a set of double steps until the top one\nwas lost in a point. The roof was built of short, shining tiles, and the\nwindows, with their little panes, seemed to be scattered irregularly\nover the face of the building, without the slightest attention to\noutward effect. But the public room on the ground floor was the\nlandlord's joy and pride. He never said \"mend it, and paint it,\" there,\nfor everything was in the highest condition of Dutch neatness and order.\nIf you will but open your mind's eye you may look into the apartment.\n\nImagine a large, bare room, with a floor that seemed to be made of\nsquares cut out of glazed earthen pie-dishes, first a yellow piece, then\na red, until the whole looked like a vast checker-board. Fancy a dozen\nhigh-backed wooden chairs standing around; then a great hollow\nchimney-place all aglow with its blazing fire, reflected a hundred times\nin the polished steel fire-dogs; a tiled hearth, tiled sides, tiled top,\nwith a Dutch sentence upon it; and over all, high above one's head, a\nnarrow mantel-shelf, filled with shining brass candle-sticks,\npipe-lighters and tinder-boxes. Then see in one end of the room, three\npine tables; in the other, a closet and a deal dresser. The latter is\nfilled with mugs, dishes, pipes, tankards, earthen and glass bottles,\nand is guarded at one end by a brass-hooped keg standing upon long legs.\nEverything dim with tobacco smoke, but otherwise clean as soap and sand\ncan make it. Next picture two sleepy, shabby-looking men, in wooden\nshoes, seated near the glowing fireplace, hugging their knees and\nsmoking short, stumpy pipes; Mynheer Kleef walking softly and heavily\nabout, clad in leather knee breeches, felt shoes and a green jacket\nwider than it is long:--then throw a heap of skates in the corner, and\nput six tired, well-dressed boys, in various attitudes, upon the wooden\nchairs, and you will see the coffee-room of the \"Red Lion\" just as it\nappeared at nine o'clock on the evening of December 6th, 184--. For\nsupper, gingerbread again; slices of Dutch sausage, rye-bread sprinkled\nwith annis-seed; pickles; a bottle of Utrecht water, and a pot of very\nmysterious coffee. The boys were ravenous enough to take all they could\nget, and pronounce it excellent. Ben made wry faces, but Jacob declared\nhe had never eaten a better meal. After they had laughed and talked a\nwhile, and counted their money by way of settling a discussion that\narose concerning their expenses, the captain marched his company off to\nbed, led on by a greasy pioneer-boy who carried skates and a candlestick\ninstead of an axe.\n\nOne of the ill-favored men by the fire had shuffled toward the dresser,\nand was ordering a mug of beer, just as Ludwig, who brought up the rear,\nwas stepping from the apartment.\n\n\"I don't like that fellow's eye,\" he whispered to Carl; \"he looks like a\npirate, or something of that kind.\"\n\n\"Looks like a granny!\" answered Carl in sleepy disdain.\n\nLudwig laughed uneasily.\n\n\"Granny or no granny,\" he whispered, \"I tell you he looks just like one\nof those men in the 'voetspoelen.'\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" sneered Carl, \"I knew it. That picture was too much for you.\nLook sharp now, and see if yon fellow with the candle doesn't look like\nthe other villain.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, his face is as honest as a Gouda cheese. But, I say, Carl,\nthat really was a horrid picture.\"\n\n\"Humph! What did you stare at it so long for?\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it.\"\n\nBy this time the boys had reached the \"beautiful room with three beds in\nit.\" A dumpy little maiden with long earrings met them at the doorway,\ndropped them a courtesy, and passed out. She carried a long-handled\nthing that resembled a frying-pan with a cover.\n\n\"I am glad to see that,\" said Van Mounen to Ben.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why, the warming-pan. It's full of hot ashes; she's been heating our\nbeds.\"\n\n\"Oh! a warming-pan, eh! Much obliged to her, I'm sure,\" said Ben, too\nsleepy to make any further comment.\n\nMeantime, Ludwig still talked of the picture that had made such a strong\nimpression upon him. He had seen it in a shop window during their walk.\nIt was a poorly-painted thing, representing two men tied back to back,\nstanding on shipboard, surrounded by a group of seamen who were\npreparing to cast them together into the sea. This mode of putting\nprisoners to death was called _voetspoelen_, or feet-washing, and was\npractised by the Dutch upon the pirates of Dunkirk in 1605; and, again,\nby the Spaniards upon the Dutch, in the horrible massacre that followed\nthe siege of Haarlem. Bad as the painting was, the expression upon the\npirates' faces was well given. Sullen and despairing as they seemed,\nthey wore such a cruel, malignant aspect, that Ludwig had felt a secret\nsatisfaction in contemplating their helpless condition. He might have\nforgotten the scene by this time but for that ill-looking man by the\nfire. Now, while he capered about, boy-like, and threw himself with an\nantic into his bed, he inwardly hoped that the \"voetspoelen\" would not\nhaunt his dreams.\n\nIt was a cold, cheerless room; a fire had been newly kindled in the\nburnished stove, and seemed to shiver even while it was trying to burn.\nThe windows, with their funny little panes, were bare and shiny, and the\ncold, waxed floor looked like a sheet of yellow ice. Three rush-bottomed\nchairs stood stiffly against the wall, alternating with three narrow\nwooden bedsteads that made the room look like the deserted ward of a\nhospital. At any other time the boys would have found it quite\nimpossible to sleep in pairs, especially in such narrow quarters; but\nto-night they lost all fear of being crowded, and longed only to lay\ntheir weary bodies upon the feather beds that lay lightly upon each cot.\nHad the boys been in Germany instead of Holland they might have been\ncovered, also, by a bed of down or feathers. This peculiar form of\nluxury was at that time adopted only by wealthy or eccentric Hollanders.\n\nLudwig, as we have seen, had not quite lost his friskiness; but the\nother boys, after one or two feeble attempts at pillow-firing, composed\nthemselves for the night with the greatest dignity. Nothing like fatigue\nfor making boys behave themselves.\n\n\"Good-night, boys!\" said Peter's voice from under the covers.\n\n\"Good-night,\" called back everybody but Jacob, who already lay snoring\nbeside the captain.\n\n\"I say,\" shouted Carl, after a moment, \"don't sneeze, anybody. Ludwig's\nin a fright!\"\n\n\"No such thing,\" retorted Ludwig in a smothered voice. Then there was a\nlittle whispered dispute, which was ended by Carl saying:\n\n\"For _my_ part, I don't know what fear is. But you really are a timid\nfellow, Ludwig.\"\n\nLudwig grunted sleepily, but made no further reply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the middle of the night. The fire had shivered itself to death,\nand, in place of its gleams, little squares of moonlight lay upon the\nfloor, slowly, slowly shifting their way across the room. Something else\nwas moving also, but they did not see it. Sleeping boys keep but a poor\nlookout. During the early hours of the night, Jacob Poot had been\ngradually but surely winding himself with all the bed covers. He now lay\nlike a monster chrysalis beside the half-frozen Peter, who,\naccordingly, was skating with all his might over the coldest, bleakest\nof dreamland icebergs.\n\nSomething else, I say, besides the moonlight, was moving across the\nbare, polished floor--moving not quite so slowly, but quite as\nstealthily.\n\nWake up, Ludwig! The voetspoelen pirate is growing real!\n\nNo. Ludwig does not waken, but he moans in his sleep.\n\nDoes not Carl hear it--Carl the brave, the fearless?\n\nNo. Carl is dreaming of the race.\n\nAnd Jacob? Van Mounen? Ben?\n\nNot they. They, too, are dreaming of the race; and Katrinka is singing\nthrough their dreams--laughing, flitting past them; now and then a wave\nfrom the great organ surges through their midst.\n\nStill the thing moves, slowly, slowly.\n\nPeter! Captain Peter, there is danger!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter heard no call; but, in his dream, he slid a few thousand feet from\none iceberg to another, and the shock awoke him.\n\nWhew! How cold he was! He gave a hopeless, desperate tug at the\nchrysalis. In vain; sheet, blanket and spread were firmly wound about\nJacob's inanimate form. Peter looked drowsily toward the window.\n\n\"Clear moonlight,\" he thought; \"we shall have pleasant weather\nto-morrow. Hallo! what's that?\"\n\nHe saw the moving thing, or rather something black crouching upon the\nfloor, for it had halted as Peter stirred.\n\nHe watched in silence.\n\nSoon it moved again, nearer and nearer. It was a man crawling upon hands\nand feet!\n\nThe captain's first impulse was to call out; but he took an instant to\nconsider matters.\n\nThe creeper had a shining knife in one hand. This was ugly; but Peter\nwas naturally self-possessed. When the head turned, Peter's eyes were\nclosed as if in sleep; but at other times nothing could be keener,\nsharper than the captain's gaze.\n\nCloser, closer crept the robber. His back was very near Peter now. The\nknife was laid softly upon the floor; one careful arm reached forth\nstealthily to drag the clothes from the chair by the captain's bed--the\nrobbery was commenced.\n\nNow was Peter's time! Holding his breath, he sprang up and leaped with\nall his strength upon the robber's back, stunning the rascal with the\nforce of the blow. To seize the knife was but a second's work. The\nrobber began to struggle, but Peter sat like a giant astride the\nprostrate form.\n\n\"If you stir,\" said the brave boy in as terrible a voice as he could\ncommand, \"stir but one inch, I will plunge this knife into your neck.\nBoys! Boys! wake up!\" he shouted, still pressing down the black head,\nand holding the knife at pricking distance, \"give us a hand! I've got\nhim! I've got him!\"\n\nThe chrysalis rolled over, but made no other sign.\n\n\"Up, boys!\" cried Peter, never budging. \"Ludwig! Lambert! Thunder! Are\nyou all dead?\"\n\nDead! not they. Van Mounen and Ben were on their feet in an instant.\n\n\"Hey? What now?\" they shouted.\n\n\"I've got a robber here,\" said Peter, coolly. \"(Lie still, you\nscoundrel, or I'll slice your head off!) Now, boys, cut out your bed\ncord--plenty of time--he's a dead man if he stirs.\"\n\nPeter felt that he weighed a thousand pounds. So he did, with that knife\nin his hand.\n\nThe man growled and swore, but dared not move.\n\nLudwig was up, by this time. He had a great jack-knife, the pride of his\nheart, in his breeches pocket. It could do good service now. They bared\nthe bedstead in a moment. It was laced backward and forward with a rope.\n\n\"I'll cut it,\" cried Ludwig, sawing away at the knot; \"hold him tight,\nPete!\"\n\n\"Never fear!\" answered the captain, giving the robber a warning prick.\n\nThe boys were soon pulling at the rope like good fellows. It was out at\nlast--a long, stout piece.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" commanded the captain, \"lift up his rascally arms! Cross\nhis hands over his back! That's right--excuse me for being in the\nway--tie them tight!\"\n\n\"Yes, and his feet too, the villain!\" cried the boys in great\nexcitement, tying knot after knot with Herculean jerks.\n\nThe prisoner changed his tone.\n\n\"Oh--oh!\" he moaned, \"spare a poor sick man--I was but walking in my\nsleep.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" grunted Lambert, still tugging away at the rope, \"asleep, were\nyou? well, we'll wake you up.\"\n\nThe man muttered fierce oaths between his teeth--then cried in a piteous\nvoice, \"Unbind me, good young masters! I have five little children at\nhome. By Saint Bavon I swear to give you each a ten-guilder piece if\nyou will but free me!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Peter.\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed the other boys.\n\nThen came threats--threats that made Ludwig fairly shudder, though he\ncontinued to bind and tie with re-doubled energy.\n\n\"Hold up! mynheer house-breaker,\" said Van Mounen in a warning voice.\n\"That knife is very near your throat. If you make the captain nervous,\nthere is no telling what may happen.\"\n\nThe robber took the hint, and fell into a sullen silence.\n\nJust at this moment the chrysalis upon the bed stirred and sat erect.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked, without opening his eyes.\n\n\"Matter!\" echoed Ludwig, half trembling, half laughing, \"get up, Jacob.\nHere's work for you. Come sit on this fellow's back while we get into\nour clothes; we're half perished.\"\n\n\"What fellow? Donder!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for Poot!\" cried all the boys, as Jacob sliding quickly to the\nfloor, bedclothes and all, took in the state of affairs at a glance, and\nsat heavily beside Peter on the robber's back.\n\nOh, didn't the fellow groan, then!\n\n\"No use in holding him down any longer, boys,\" said Peter, rising, but\nbending as he did so to draw a pistol from his man's belt. \"You see,\nI've been keeping guard over this pretty little weapon for the last ten\nminutes. It's cocked and the least wriggle might have set it off. No\ndanger now. I must dress myself. You and I, Lambert, will go for the\npolice. I'd no idea it was so cold.\"\n\n\"Where is Carl?\" asked one of the boys.\n\nThey looked at one another. Carl certainly was not among them.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Ludwig, frightened at last, \"where is he? Perhaps he's had a\nfight with the robber, and got killed.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Peter quietly, as he buttoned his stout jacket.\n\"Look under the beds.\"\n\nThey did so. Carl was not there.\n\nJust then they heard a commotion on the stairway. Ben hastened to open\nthe door. The landlord almost tumbled in; he was armed with a big\nblunderbuss. Two or three lodgers followed; then the daughter, with an\nupraised frying-pan in one hand, and a candle in the other; and, behind\nher, looking pale and frightened, the gallant Carl!\n\n\"There's your man, mine host,\" said Peter, nodding toward the prisoner.\n\nMine host raised his blunderbuss, the girl screamed, and Jacob, more\nnimble than usual, rolled quickly from the robber's back.\n\n\"Don't fire,\" cried Peter; \"he is tied, hand and foot. Let's roll him\nover, and see what he looks like.\"\n\nCarl stepped briskly forward, with a blustering \"Yes. _We'll_ turn him\nover, in a way he won't like. Lucky we've caught him!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Ludwig, \"where were you, Master Carl?\"\n\n\"Where was I?\" retorted Carl, angrily; \"why, I went to give the alarm,\nto be sure!\"\n\nAll the boys exchanged glances; but they were too happy and elated to\nsay anything ill-natured. Carl certainly was bold enough now. He took\nthe lead while three others aided him in turning the helpless man.\n\nWhile the robber lay, face up, scowling and muttering, Ludwig took the\ncandlestick from the girl's hand.\n\n\"I must have a good look at the beauty,\" he said, drawing closer, but\nthe words were no sooner spoken than he turned pale and started so\nviolently that he almost dropped the candle.\n\n\"THE VOETSPOELEN!\" he cried; \"why, boys, it's the man who sat by the\nfire!\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" answered Peter; \"we counted our money before him like\nsimpletons. But what have we to do with voetspoelen, brother Ludwig? A\nmonth in jail is punishment enough.\"\n\nThe landlord's daughter had left the room. She now ran in, holding up a\npair of huge wooden shoes. \"See, father,\" she cried, \"here are his great\nugly boats. It's the man that we put in the next room after the young\nmasters went to bed. Ah! it was wrong to send the poor young gentlemen\nup here so far out of sight and sound.\"\n\n\"The scoundrel!\" hissed the landlord, \"he has disgraced my house. I go\nfor the police at once!\"\n\nIn less than fifteen minutes two drowsy looking officers were in the\nroom. After telling Mynheer Kleef that he must appear early in the\nmorning with the boys and make his complaint before a magistrate, they\nmarched off with their prisoner.\n\nOne would think the captain and his band could have slept no more that\nnight; but the mooring has not yet been found that can prevent youth and\nan easy conscience from drifting down the river of dreams. The boys\nwere too much fatigued to let so slight a thing as capturing a robber\nbind them to wakefulness. They were soon in bed again, floating away to\nstrange scenes made of familiar things. Ludwig and Carl had spread their\nbedding upon the floor. One had already forgotten the voetspoelen, the\nrace--everything; but Carl was wide awake. He heard the carrilons\nringing out their solemn nightly music, and the watchman's noisy clapper\nputting in discord at the quarter-hours; he saw the moonshine glide away\nfrom the window, and the red morning light come pouring in, and all the\nwhile he kept thinking:\n\n\"Pooh! what a goose I have made of myself!\"\n\nCarl Schummel, alone, with none to look or to listen, was not quite so\ngrand a fellow as Carl Schummel strutting about in his boots.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nBEFORE THE COURT\n\n\nYou may believe the landlord's daughter bestirred herself to prepare a\ngood meal for the boys next morning. Mynheer had a Chinese gong that\ncould make more noise than a dozen of breakfast bells. Its hideous\nreveille, clanging through the house, generally startled the drowsiest\nlodgers into activity, but the maiden would not allow it to be sounded\nthis morning:\n\n\"Let the brave young gentlemen sleep,\" she said, to the greasy kitchen\nboy; \"they shall be warmly fed when they waken.\"\n\nIt was ten o'clock when Captain Peter and his band came straggling down\none by one.\n\n\"A pretty hour,\" said mine host, gruffly. \"It is high time we were\nbefore the court. Fine business this for a respectable inn. You will\ntestify truly, young masters, that you found most excellent fare and\nlodgment at the Red Lion?\"\n\n\"Of course we will,\" answered Carl, saucily, \"and pleasant company, too,\nthough they visit at rather unseasonable hours.\"\n\nA stare and a \"humph!\" was all the answer Mynheer made to this, but the\ndaughter was more communicative. Shaking her earrings at Carl she said\nsharply:\n\n\"Not so very pleasant either, master traveler, if one could judge by the\nway _you_ ran away from it!\"\n\n\"Impertinent creature!\" hissed Carl under his breath, as he began busily\nto examine his skate-straps. Meantime the kitchen-boy, listening outside\nat the crack of the door, doubled himself with silent laughter.\n\nAfter breakfast the boys went to the Police Court, accompanied by\nHuygens Kleef and his daughter. Mynheer's testimony was principally to\nthe effect that such a thing as a robber at the \"Red Lion\" had been\nunheard of until last night; and as for the \"Red Lion,\" it was a most\nrespectable inn, as respectable as any house in Leyden. Each boy, in\nturn, told all he knew of the affair, and identified the prisoner in the\nbox as the same man who entered their room in the dead of night. Ludwig\nwas surprised to find that the robber was a man of ordinary\nsize--especially after he had described him, under oath, to the Court as\na tremendous fellow, with great square shoulders, and legs of prodigious\nweight. Jacob swore that he was awakened by the robber kicking and\nthrashing upon the floor; and, immediately afterward, Peter and the rest\n(feeling sorry that they had not explained the matter to their sleepy\ncomrade) testified that the man had not moved a muscle from the moment\nthe point of the dagger touched his throat, until, bound from head to\nfoot, he was rolled over for inspection. The landlord's daughter made\none boy blush, and all the court smile, by declaring that, \"if it hadn't\nbeen for that handsome young gentleman there\" (pointing to Peter) they\n\"might have all been murdered in their beds; for the dreadful man had a\ngreat, shining knife most as long as your honor's arm,\" and _she_\nbelieved \"the handsome young gentleman had struggled hard enough to get\nit away from him, but he was too modest, bless him! to say so.\"\n\nFinally, after a little questioning, and cross-questioning from the\npublic Prosecutor the witnesses were dismissed, and the robber was\nhanded over to the consideration of the Criminal Court.\n\n\"The scoundrel!\" said Carl, savagely, when the boys reached the street.\n\"He ought to be sent to jail at once. If I had been in your place,\nPeter, I certainly should have killed him outright!\"\n\n\"He was fortunate, then, in falling into gentler hands,\" was Peter's\nquiet reply; \"it appears he has been arrested before under a charge of\nhouse-breaking. He did not succeed in robbing this time, but he broke\nthe door-fastenings, and that I believe makes a burglary in the eye of\nthe law. He was armed with a knife, too, and that makes it worse for\nhim, poor fellow!\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" mimicked Carl; \"one would think he was your brother!\"\n\n\"So he is my brother, and yours, too, Carl Schummel, for that matter,\"\nanswered Peter, looking into Carl's eye. \"We cannot say what we might\nhave become under other circumstances. _We_ have been bolstered up from\nevil, since the hour we were born. A happy home and good parents might\nhave made that man a fine fellow instead of what he is. God grant that\nthe law may cure and not crush him!\"\n\n\"Amen to that!\" said Lambert, heartily, while Ludwig van Holp looked at\nhis brother in such a bright, proud way that Jacob Poot, who was an only\nson, wished from his heart that the little form buried in the old church\nat home had lived to grow up beside him.\n\n\"Humph!\" said Carl, \"it's very well to be saintly and forgiving, and all\nthat sort of thing, but I'm naturally hard. All these fine ideas seem to\nrattle off of me like hailstones--and it's nobody's business, either, if\nthey do.\"\n\nPeter recognized a touch of good feeling in this clumsy concession;\nholding out his hand, he said in a frank, hearty tone:\n\n\"Come, lad, shake hands, and let us be good friends even if we don't\nexactly agree on all questions.\"\n\n\"We do agree better than you think,\" sulked Carl, as he returned Peter's\ngrasp.\n\n\"All right,\" responded Peter briskly. \"Now Van Mounen, we await\nBenjamin's wishes. Where would he like to go?\"\n\n\"To the Egyptian Museum,\" answered Lambert, after holding a brief\nconsultation with Ben.\n\n\"That is on the Breede Straat. To the Museum let it be. Come, boys!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nTHE BELEAGUERED CITIES\n\n\n\"This open square before us,\" said Lambert, as he and Ben walked on\ntogether, \"is pretty in summer, with its shady trees. They call it the\nRuine. Years ago it was covered with houses, and the Rapenburg canal,\nhere, ran through the street. Well, one day a barge loaded with forty\nthousand pounds of gunpowder, bound for Delft, was lying alongside, and\nthe bargemen took a notion to cook their dinner on the deck; and before\nany one knew it, sir, the whole thing blew up, killing lots of persons\nand scattering about three hundred houses to the winds.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Ben, \"did the explosion destroy three hundred houses!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, my father was in Leyden at the time. He says it was terrible.\nThe explosion occurred just at noon, and was like a volcano. All this\npart of the town was on fire in an instant, buildings tumbling down, and\nmen, women and children groaning under the ruins--The King himself came\nto the city and acted nobly, father says, staying out in the streets all\nnight, encouraging the survivors in their efforts to arrest the fire,\nand rescue as many as possible from under the heaps of stone and\nrubbish. Through his means a collection for the benefit of the sufferers\nwas raised throughout the kingdom, besides a hundred thousand guilders\npaid out of the treasury. Father was only nineteen years old then; it\nwas in 1807, I believe, but he remembers it perfectly. A friend of his,\nProfessor Luzac, was among the killed. They have a tablet erected to his\nmemory, in Saint Peter's Church, further on--the queerest thing you ever\nsaw--with an image of the professor carved upon it representing him just\nas he looked when he was found after the explosion.\"\n\n\"What a strange idea! Isn't Boerhaave's monument in Saint Peter's also?\"\n\n\"I cannot remember. Perhaps Peter knows.\"\n\nThe captain delighted Ben by saying that the monument was there and that\nhe thought they might be able to see it during the day.\n\n\"Lambert,\" continued Peter, \"ask Ben if he saw Van der Werf's portrait\nat the Town Hall last night?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lambert, \"I can answer for him. It was too late to go in. I\nsay, boys, it is really wonderful how much Ben knows. Why, he has told\nme a volume of Dutch history already. I'll wager he has the siege of\nLeyden at his tongue's end.\"\n\n\"His tongue must burn then,\" interposed Ludwig, \"for if Bilderdyk's\naccount is true it was a pretty hot affair.\"\n\nBen was looking at them with an inquiring smile.\n\n\"We are speaking of the siege of Leyden,\" explained Lambert.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Ben, eagerly, \"I had forgotten all about it. This was\nthe very place--Let's give old Van der Werf three cheers--Hur----\"\n\nVan Mounen uttered a hasty \"hush!\" and explained that, patriotic as the\nDutch were, the police would soon have something to say if a party of\nboys cheered in the street at midday.\n\n\"What! not cheer Van der Werf?\" cried Ben, indignantly. \"One of the\ngreatest chaps in history? Only think! Didn't he hold out against those\nmurderous Spaniards for months and months! There was the town,\nsurrounded on all sides by the enemy; great black forts sending fire and\ndeath into the very heart of the city--but no surrender! Every man a\nhero--women, and children, too, brave and fierce as lions--provisions\ngiving out, the very grass from between the paving-stones gone--till\npeople were glad to eat horses and cats and dogs and rats. Then came the\nPlague--hundreds dying in the streets--but no surrender! Then when they\ncould bear no more--when the people, brave as they were, crowded about\nVan der Werf in the public square begging him to give up; what did the\nnoble old burgomaster say:--'I have sworn to defend this city, and with\nGod's help, _I mean to do it_! If my body can satisfy your hunger, take\nit, and divide it among you--but expect no surrender so long as I am\nalive'--Hurrah! hur----\"\n\nBen was getting uproarious; Lambert playfully clapped his hand over his\nfriend's mouth. The result was one of those quick india-rubber scuffles\nfearful to behold, but delightful to human nature in its polliwog state.\n\n\"Vat wash te matter, Pen?\" asked Jacob, hurrying forward.\n\n\"Oh! nothing at all,\" panted Ben, \"except that Van Mounen was afraid of\nstarting an English riot in this orderly town. He stopped my cheering\nfor old Van der----\"\n\n\"Ya! ya--it ish no goot to sheer--to make te noise for dat--You vill\nshee old Van der Does' likeness mit te Stadhuis.\"\n\n\"See old Van der Does? I thought it was Van der Werf's picture they had\nthere----\"\n\n\"Ya,\" responded Jacob, \"Van der Werf--vell, vot of it! both ish just ash\ngoot----\"\n\n\"Yes, Van der Does was a noble old Dutchman, but he was not Van der\nWerf. I know he defended the city like a brick, and----\"\n\n\"Now vot for you shay dat, Penchamin? He no defend te citty mit breek,\nhe fight like goot soltyer mit his guns. You like make te fun mit\neffrysinks Tutch.\"\n\n\"No! no! no! I said he defended the city like a brick. That is very high\npraise, I would have you understand. We English call even the Duke of\nWellington a brick.\"\n\nJacob looked puzzled; but his indignation was already on the ebb.\n\n\"Vell, it ish no matter. I no tink, before, soltyer mean breek, but it\nish no matter.\"\n\nBen laughed good-naturedly, and seeing that his cousin was tired of\ntalking in English, he turned to his friend of the two languages:\n\n\"Van Mounen! they say the very carrier-pigeons that brought news of\nrelief to the besieged city are somewhere here in Leyden. I really\nshould like to see them. Just think of it! At the very height of the\ntrouble if the wind didn't turn, and blow in the waters, and drown\nhundreds of the Spaniards, and enable the Dutch boats to sail in right\nover the land with men and provisions to the very gates of the city. The\npigeons, you know, did great service, in bearing letters to and fro. I\nhave read somewhere that they were reverently cared for from that day,\nand, when they died, they were stuffed, and placed for safe keeping in\nthe Town Hall. We must be sure to have a look at them.\"\n\nVan Mounen laughed. \"On that principle, Ben, I suppose when you go to\nRome you'll expect to see the identical goose who saved the Capitol. But\nit will be easy enough to see the pigeons. They are in the same building\nwith Van der Werf's portrait. Which was the greatest defence, Ben, the\nsiege of Leyden or the siege of Haarlem?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Ben, thoughtfully, \"Van der Werf is one of my heroes; we\nall have our historical pets, you know, but I really think the siege of\nHaarlem brought out a braver, more heroic resistance even, than the\nLeyden one; besides they set the Leyden sufferers an example of courage\nand fortitude, for their turn came first.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about the Haarlem siege,\" said Lambert, \"except that\nit was in 1573. Who beat?\"\n\n\"The Spaniards,\" said Ben. \"The Dutch had stood out for months. Not a\nman would yield nor a woman either for that matter. They shouldered arms\nand fought gallantly beside their husbands and fathers. Three hundred of\nthem did duty under Kanau Hesselaer, a great woman, and brave as Joan of\nArc. All this time the city was surrounded by the Spaniards under\nFrederic of Toledo, son of that beauty, the Duke of Alva. Cut off from\nall possible help from without, there seemed to be no hope for the\ninhabitants, but they shouted defiance over the city walls. They even\nthrew bread into the enemy's camps to show that they were not afraid of\nstarvation. Up to the last they held out bravely, waiting for the help\nthat never could come--growing bolder and bolder until their provisions\nwere exhausted. Then it was terrible. In time hundreds of famished\ncreatures fell dead in the streets, and the living had scarcely strength\nto bury them. At last, they made the desperate resolution, that rather\nthan perish by lingering torture, the strongest would form in a square,\nplacing the weakest in the centre, and rush in a body to their death,\nwith the faint chance of being able to fight their way through the\nenemy. The Spaniards received a hint of this, and believing there was\nnothing the Dutch would not dare to do, they concluded to offer terms.\"\n\n\"High time, I should think.\"\n\n\"Yes, with falsehood and treachery they soon obtained an entrance into\nthe city, promising protection and forgiveness to all except those whom\nthe citizens themselves would acknowledge as deserving of death.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" said Lambert, quite interested; \"that ended the\nbusiness, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" returned Ben, \"for the Duke of Alva had already given\nhis son orders to show mercy to none.\"\n\n\"Ah! there was where the great Haarlem massacre came in. I remember now.\nYou can't wonder that the Hollanders dislike Spain when you read of the\nway they were butchered by Alva and his hosts, though I admit that our\nside sometimes retaliated terribly. But as I have told you before, I\nhave a very indistinct idea of historical matters. Everything is utter\nconfusion--from the Flood to the battle of Waterloo. One thing is plain,\nhowever, the Duke of Alva was about the worst specimen of a man that\never lived.\"\n\n\"That gives only a faint idea of him,\" said Ben, \"but I hate to think of\nsuch a wretch. What if he _had_ brains, and military skill, and all\nthat sort of thing! Give me such men as Van der Werf, and--what now?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Van Mounen, who was looking up and down the street, in a\nbewildered way. \"We've walked right past the Museum, and I don't see the\nboys. Let us go back.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nLEYDEN\n\n\nThe boys met at the Museum, and were soon engaged in examining its\nextensive collection of curiosities, receiving a new insight into\nEgyptian life ancient and modern. Ben and Lambert had often visited the\nBritish Museum, but that did not prevent them from being surprised at\nthe richness of the Leyden collection. There were household utensils,\nwearing apparel, weapons, musical instruments, sarcophagi, and mummies\nof men, women, and cats, ibexes and other creatures. They saw a massive\ngold armlet that had been worn by an Egyptian King at a time when some\nof these same mummies, perhaps, were nimbly treading the streets of\nThebes; and jewels and trinkets such as Pharaoh's daughter wore, and the\nchildren of Israel borrowed when they departed out of Egypt.\n\nThere were other interesting relics, from Rome and Greece, and some\ncurious Roman pottery which had been discovered in digging near the\nHague--relics of the days when the countrymen of Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar had\nsettled there. Where have they not settled? I for one would hardly be\nastonished if relics of the ancient Romans should some day be found deep\nunder the grass growing round the Bunker-hill monument.\n\nWhen the boys left this Museum, they went to another and saw a wonderful\ncollection of fossil animals, skeletons, birds, minerals, precious\nstones and other natural specimens, but as they were not learned men,\nthey could only walk about and stare, enjoy the little knowledge of\nnatural history they possessed, and wish with all their hearts they had\nacquired more. Even the skeleton of the mouse puzzled Jacob. What\nwonder? He was not used to seeing the cat-fearing little creatures\nrunning about in their bones--and how could he ever have imagined their\nnecks to be so queer?\n\nBesides the Museum of Natural History, there was Saint Peter's Church to\nbe visited, containing Professor Luzac's Memorial, and Boerhaave's\nMonument of white and black marble, with its urn and carved symbols of\nthe four ages of life, and its medallion of Boerhaave, adorned with his\nfavorite motto \"Simplex sigillum veri.\" They also obtained admittance to\na tea-garden, which in summer was a favorite resort of the citizens, and\npassing naked oaks and fruit-trees, ascended a high mound which stood in\nthe centre. This was the site of a round tower now in ruins, said by\nsome to have been built by Hengist the Anglo Saxon king, and by others\nto have been the castle of one of the ancient counts of Holland.\n\nAs the boys walked about on the top of its stone wall, they could get\nbut a poor view of the surrounding city. The tower stood higher when,\nmore than two centuries ago, the inhabitants of beleaguered Leyden\nshouted to the watcher on its top their wild, despairing cries--\"Is\nthere any help? Are the waters rising? What do you see?\"\n\nAnd for months he could only answer--\"No help. I see around us nothing\nbut the enemy.\"\n\nBen pushed these thoughts away; and resolutely looking down into the\nbare tea-garden, filled it in imagination with gay summer groups. He\ntried to forget old battle-clouds, and picture only curling wreaths of\ntobacco-smoke, rising from among men, women and children enjoying their\ntea and coffee in the open air. But a tragedy came in spite of him.\n\nPoot was bending over the edge of the high wall. It would be just like\nhim to grow dizzy and tumble off. Ben turned impatiently away. If the\nfellow with his weak head knew no better than to be venturesome, why,\nlet him tumble. Horror! what meant that heavy, crashing sound?\n\nBen could not stir. He could only gasp:\n\n\"Jacob!\"\n\n\"Jacob!\" cried another startled voice and another. Ready to faint, Ben\nmanaged to turn his head. He saw a crowd of boys on the edge of the wall\nopposite--but Jacob was not there!\n\n\"Good Heaven!\" he cried, springing forward, \"where is my cousin?\"\n\nThe crowd parted. It was only four boys, after all. There sat Jacob in\ntheir midst, holding his sides and laughing heartily.\n\n\"Did I frighten you all?\" he said in his native Dutch. \"Well, I will\ntell you how it was. There was a big stone lying on the wall and I put\nmy--my foot out just to push it a little, you see--and the first thing I\nknew, down went the stone all the way to the bottom, and left me sitting\nhere on top with both my feet in the air. If I had not thrown myself\nback at that moment, I certainly should have rolled over after the\nstone. Well, it is no matter. Help me up, boys.\"\n\n\"You are hurt, Jacob!\" said Ben, seeing a shade of seriousness pass over\nhis cousin's face as they lifted him to his feet.\n\nJacob tried to laugh again. \"Oh, no--I feels little hurt ven I stant up,\nbut it ish no matter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe monument to Van der Werf in the Hooglandsche Kerk was not accessible\nthat day; but the boys spent a few pleasant moments in the Stadhuis or\nTown Hall, a long irregular structure somewhat in the Gothic style,\nuncouth in architecture, but picturesque from age. Its little steeple,\ntuneful with bells, seemed to have been borrowed from some other\nbuilding and hastily clapped on as a finishing touch.\n\nAscending the grand staircase the boys soon found themselves in rather a\ngloomy apartment, containing the masterpiece of Lucas van Leyden, or\nHugens, a Dutch artist, born three hundred and seventy years ago, who\npainted well when he was ten years of age, and became distinguished in\nart when only fifteen. This picture, called the Last Judgment,\nconsidering the remote age in which it was painted, is truly a\nremarkable production. The boys, however, were less interested in\ntracing out the merits of the work, than they were in the fact of its\nbeing a triptych--that is, painted on three divisions, the two outer\nones swung on hinges so as to close, when required, over the main\nportion.\n\nThe historical pictures by Harel de Moor and other famous Dutch artists\ninterested them for a while, and Ben had to be almost pulled away from\nthe dingy old portrait of Van der Werf.\n\nThe Town Hall, as well as the Egyptian Museum, is on the Breede Straat,\nthe longest and finest street in Leyden. It has no canal running through\nit, and the houses, painted in every variety of color, have a\npicturesque effect as they stand with their gable ends to the street;\nsome are very tall, with half of their height in their step-like roofs;\nothers crouch before the public edifices and churches. Being clean,\nspacious, well-shaded and adorned with many elegant mansions, it\ncompares favorably with the finer portions of Amsterdam. It is kept\nscrupulously neat; many of the gutters are covered with boards that open\nlike trap-doors; and it is supplied with pumps surmounted with shining\nbrass ornaments kept scoured and bright at the public cost. The city is\nintersected by numerous water-roads formed by the river Rhine, there\ngrown sluggish, fatigued by its long travel; but more than one hundred\nand fifty stone bridges reunite the dissevered streets. The same\nworld-renowned river, degraded from the beautiful, free-flowing Rhine,\nserves as a moat around the rampart that surrounds Leyden, and is\ncrossed by draw-bridges at the imposing gateways that give access to the\ncity. Fine broad promenades, shaded by noble trees, border the canals,\nand add to the retired appearance of the houses behind, heightening the\neffect of scholastic seclusion that seems to pervade the place.\n\nBen as he scanned the buildings on the Rapenburg canal, was somewhat\ndisappointed in the appearance of the great University of Leyden. But\nwhen he recalled its history--how, attended with all the pomp of a grand\ncivic display, it had been founded by the Prince of Orange as a tribute\nto the citizens for the bravery displayed during the siege; when he\nremembered the great men in religion, learning and science who had once\nstudied there, and thought of the hundreds of students now sharing the\nbenefits of its classes and its valuable scientific museums--he was\nquite willing to forego architectural beauty, though, he could not help\nfeeling that no amount of it could have been misplaced on such an\ninstitution.\n\nPeter and Jacob regarded the building with even a deeper, more practical\ninterest, for they were to enter it as students, in the course of a few\nmonths.\n\n\"Poor Don Quixote would have run a hopeless tilt in this part of the\nworld,\" said Ben, after Lambert had been pointing out some of the\noddities and beauties of the suburbs--\"it is all windmills. You remember\nhis terrific contest with one, I suppose.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lambert, bluntly.\n\n\"Well, I don't either, that is, not definitely. But there was something\nof that kind in his adventures, and if there wasn't, there should have\nbeen--Look at them, how frantically they whirl their great arms--just\nthe thing to excite the crazy knight to mortal combat. It bewilders one\nto look at them; help me to count all those we can see, Van Mounen. I\nwant a big item for my note-book\"--and after a careful reckoning,\nsuperintended by all the party, Master Ben wrote in pencil, \"Saw,\nDec.,--184-- ninety-eight windmills within full view of Leyden.\"\n\nHe would have been glad to visit the old brick mill in which the painter\nRembrandt was born; but he abandoned the project upon learning that it\nwould take them out of their way. Few boys as hungry as Ben was by this\ntime, would hesitate long between Rembrandt's home a mile off, and\ntiffin close by. Ben chose the latter.\n\nAfter tiffin, they rested a while, and then--took another, which, for\nform sake, they called dinner. After dinner the boys sat warming\nthemselves, at the inn; all but Peter, who occupied the time in another\nfruitless search for Dr. Boekman.\n\nThis over, the party once more prepared for skating. They were thirteen\nmiles from the Hague and not as fresh as when they had left Broek early\non the previous day; but they were in good spirits and the ice was\nexcellent.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nTHE PALACE AND THE WOOD\n\n\nAs the boys skated onward, they saw a number of fine country seats, all\ndecorated and surrounded according to the Dutchest of Dutch taste, but\nimpressive to look upon, with their great, formal houses, elaborate\ngardens, square hedges, and wide ditches--some crossed by a bridge,\nhaving a gate in the middle to be carefully locked at night. These\nditches, everywhere traversing the landscape, had long ago lost their\nsummer film, and now shone under the sunlight, like trailing ribbons of\nglass.\n\nThe boys traveled bravely, all the while performing the surprising feat\nof producing gingerbread from their pockets and causing it to vanish\ninstantly.\n\nTwelve miles were passed. A few more long strokes would take them to the\nHague, when Van Mounen proposed that they should vary their course, by\nwalking into the city through The Bosch.\n\n\"Agreed!\" cried one and all--and their skates were off in a twinkling.\n\nThe Bosch is a grand park or wood, nearly two miles long, containing the\ncelebrated House in the Wood--_Huis in't Bosch_--sometimes used as a\nroyal residence.\n\nThis building, though plain outside for a palace, is elegantly furnished\nwithin, and finely frescoed--that is, the walls and ceiling are covered\nwith groups and designs painted directly upon them while the plaster was\nfresh. Some of the rooms are tapestried with Chinese silk, beautifully\nembroidered. One contains a number of family portraits, among them a\ngroup of royal children who in time were orphaned by a certain axe which\nfigures very frequently in European history. These children were painted\nmany times by the Dutch artist Van Dyck, who was court-painter to their\nfather, Charles the First of England. Beautiful children they were--what\na deal of trouble the English nation would have been spared, had they\nbeen as perfect in heart and soul, as they were in form!\n\nThe park surrounding the palace is charming, especially in summer, for\nflowers and birds make it bright as fairyland. Long rows of magnificent\noaks rear their proud heads, conscious that no profaning hand will ever\nbring them low. In fact the Wood has for ages been held as an almost\nsacred spot. Children are never allowed to meddle with its smallest\ntwig; the axe of the Woodman has never resounded there. Even war and\nriot have passed it reverently, pausing for a moment in their\ndevastating way. Philip of Spain, while he ordered Dutchmen to be mowed\ndown by hundreds, issued a mandate that not a bough of the beautiful\nWood should be touched--and once when in a time of great necessity the\nState was about to sacrifice it to assist in filling a nearly exhausted\ntreasury, the people rushed to the rescue, and nobly contributed the\nrequired amount rather than that the Bosch should fall.\n\nWhat wonder then that the oaks have a grand, fearless air? Birds from\nall Holland have told them how, elsewhere, trees are cropped and bobbed\ninto shape--but _they_ are untouched. Year after year, they expand in\nunclipped luxuriance and beauty; their wide-spreading foliage, alive\nwith song, casts a cool shade over lawn and pathway, or bows to its\nimage in the sunny ponds.\n\nMeanwhile, as if to reward the citizens for allowing her to have her way\nfor once, Nature departs from the invariable level, wearing gracefully\nthe ornaments that have been reverently bestowed upon her--So the lawn\nslopes in a velvety green; the paths wind in and out; flower-beds glow\nand send forth perfume; and ponds and sky look at each other in mutual\nadmiration.\n\nEven on that winter day the Bosch was beautiful. Its trees were bare,\nbut beneath them still lay the ponds, every ripple smoothed into glass.\nThe blue sky was bright overhead, and as it looked down through the\nthicket of boughs, it saw another blue sky, not nearly so bright,\nlooking up from the dim thicket under the ice.\n\nNever had the sunset appeared more beautiful to Peter than when he saw\nit exchanging farewell glances with the windows and shining roofs of the\ncity before him. Never had the Hague itself seemed more inviting. He was\nno longer Peter van Holp, going to visit a great city, nor a fine young\ngentleman bent on sightseeing; he was a knight, an adventurer,\ntravel-soiled and weary, a Hop-o'-my-Thumb grown large, a Fortunatus\napproaching the enchanted castle where luxury and ease awaited him--for\nhis own sister's house was not half a mile away.\n\n\"At last, boys,\" he cried, in high glee, \"we may hope for a royal\nresting-place--good beds, warm rooms and something fit to eat. I never\nrealized before what a luxury such things are. Our lodgings at the Red\nLion have made us appreciate our own homes.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nTHE MERCHANT PRINCE, AND THE SISTER-PRINCESS\n\n\nWell might Peter feel that his sister's house was like an enchanted\ncastle. Large and elegant as it was, a spell of quiet hung over it. The\nvery lion crouching at its gate seemed to have been turned into stone\nthrough magic. Within, it was guarded by genii, in the shape of\nred-faced servants, who sprang silently forth at the summons of bell or\nknocker. There was a cat, also, who appeared as knowing as any\nPuss-in-Boots; and a brass gnome in the hall whose business it was to\nstand with outstretched arms ready to receive sticks and umbrellas. Safe\nwithin the walls bloomed a Garden of Delight, where the flowers firmly\nbelieved it was summer, and a sparkling fountain was laughing merrily to\nitself because Jack Frost could not find it. There was a Sleeping\nBeauty, too, just at the time of the boys' arrival; but when Peter, like\na true prince, flew lightly up the stairs, and kissed her eyelids, the\nenchantment was broken. The princess became his own good sister, and the\nfairy castle just one of the finest, most comfortable houses of the\nHague.\n\nAs may well be believed, the boys received the heartiest of welcomes.\nAfter they had conversed a while with their lively hostess, one of the\ngenii summoned them to a grand repast in a red-curtained room, where\nfloor and ceiling shone like polished ivory, and the mirrors suddenly\nblossomed into rosy-cheeked boys as far as the eye could reach.\n\nThey had caviare now, and salmagundi, and sausage and cheese, besides\nsalad and fruit and biscuit and cake. How the boys could partake of such\na medley was a mystery to Ben; for the salad was sour, and the cake was\nsweet; the fruit was dainty, and the salmagundi heavy with onions and\nfish. But, while he was wondering, he made a hearty meal, and was soon\nabsorbed in deciding which he really preferred, the coffee or the\nanisette cordial. It was delightful, too--this taking one's food from\ndishes of frosted silver and liqueur glasses from which Titania herself\nmight have sipped. The young gentleman afterward wrote to his mother\nthat pretty and choice as things were at home, he had never known what\ncut-glass, china and silver services were until he visited the Hague.\n\nOf course Peter's sister soon heard of all the boys' adventures. How\nthey had skated over forty miles and seen rare sights on the way; how\nthey had lost their purse and found it again. How one of the party had\nfallen and given them an excuse for a grand sail in an ice-boat; how\nabove all, they had caught a robber, and so for a second time saved\ntheir slippery purse.\n\n\"And now, Peter,\" said the lady, when the story was finished, \"you must\nwrite at once to tell the good people of Broek that your adventures have\nreached their height, that you and your fellow-travelers have all been\ntaken prisoners.\"\n\nThe boys looked startled.\n\n\"Indeed, I shall do no such thing,\" laughed Peter; \"we must leave\nto-morrow at noon.\"\n\nBut the sister had already decided differently, and a Holland lady is\nnot to be easily turned from her purpose. In short, she held forth such\nstrong temptations, and was so bright and cheerful, and said so many\ncoaxing and unanswerable things, both in English and Dutch, that the\nboys were all delighted when it was settled that they should remain at\nthe Hague for at least two days.\n\nNext the grand skating-race was talked over; Mevrouw van Gend gladly\npromised to be present on the occasion--\"I shall witness your triumph,\nPeter,\" she said, \"for you are the fastest skater I ever knew.\"\n\nPeter blushed and gave a slight cough, as Carl answered for him.\n\n\"Ah, mevrouw, he is swift, but all the Broek boys are fine skaters--even\nthe rag-pickers\"--and he thought bitterly of poor Hans.\n\nThe lady laughed. \"That will make the race all the more exciting,\" she\nsaid--\"but I shall wish each of you to be the winner.\"\n\nAt this moment her husband Mynheer van Gend came in, and the enchantment\nfalling upon the boys was complete.\n\nThe invisible fairies of the household at once clustered about them\nwhispering that Jasper van Gend had a heart as young and fresh as their\nown, and if he loved anything in this world more than industry, it was\nsunshine and frolic. They hinted also something about his having a heart\nfull of love and a head full of wisdom, and finally gave the boys to\nunderstand that when Mynheer said a thing he meant it.\n\nTherefore his frank \"Well now, this is pleasant,\" as he shook hands with\nthem all, made the boys feel quite at home and as happy as squirrels.\n\nThere were fine paintings in the drawing-room and exquisite statuary,\nand portfolios filled with rare Dutch engravings; besides many\nbeautiful and curious things from China and Japan. The boys felt that it\nwould require a month to examine all the treasures of the apartment.\n\nBen noticed with pleasure English books lying upon the table. He saw\nalso over the carved, upright piano, life-sized portraits of William of\nOrange and his English queen, a sight that, for a time, brought England\nand Holland side by side in his heart. William and Mary have left a halo\nround the English throne to this day, he the truest patriot that ever\nserved an adopted country, she the noblest wife that ever sat upon a\nBritish throne, up to the time of Victoria and Albert the Good. As Ben\nlooked at the pictures, he remembered accounts he had read of King\nWilliam's visit to the Hague in the winter of 1691. He who sang the\nBattle of Ivry had not yet told the glowing story of that day, but Ben\nknew enough of it, to fancy that he could almost hear the shouts of the\ndelighted populace as he looked from the portraits to the street, which\nat this moment was aglow with a bonfire, kindled in a neighboring\nsquare.\n\nThat royal visit was one never to be forgotten. For two years William of\nOrange had been monarch of a foreign land, his head working faithfully\nfor England, but his whole heart yearning for Holland. Now when he\nsought its shores once more, the entire nation bade him welcome.\nMultitudes flocked to the Hague to meet him--\"many thousands came\nsliding or skating along the frozen canals from Amsterdam, Rotterdam,\nLeyden, Haarlem, Delft.\"[24] All day long the festivities of the capital\nwere kept up, the streets were gorgeous with banners, evergreen arches,\ntrophies, and mottoes of welcome and emblems of industry. William saw\nthe deeds of his ancestors and scenes of his own past life depicted on\nbanners and tapestries along the streets. At night, superb fireworks\nwere displayed upon the ice. Its glassy surface was like a mirror.\nSparkling fountains of light sprang up from below to meet the glittering\ncascades leaping upon it. Then a feathery fire of crimson and green\nshook millions of rubies and emeralds, into the ruddy depths of the\nice--and all this time the people were shouting--God bless William of\nOrange--long live the King! They were half mad with joy and enthusiasm.\nWilliam their own prince, their stadtholder, had become the ruler of\nthree kingdoms; he had been victorious in council and in war, and now in\nhis hour of greatest triumph, had come as a simple guest to visit them.\nThe king heard their shouts with a beating heart. It is a great thing to\nbe beloved by one's country. His English courtiers complimented him upon\nhis reception. \"Yes,\" said he, \"but the shouting is nothing to what it\nwould have been if Mary had been with me!\"\n\n[Footnote 24: Macaulay's History of England.]\n\nWhile Ben was looking at the portraits, Mynheer van Gend was giving the\nboys an account of a recent visit to Antwerp. As it was the birthplace\nof Quentin Matsys the blacksmith who for love of an artist's daughter,\nstudied until he became a great painter, the boys asked their host if he\nhad seen any of Matsys' works.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" he replied, \"and excellent they are. His famous triptych\nin a chapel of the Antwerp cathedral, with the Descent from the Cross on\nthe centre panel, is especially fine; but I confess I was more\ninterested in his well.\"\n\n\"What well, mynheer?\" asked Ludwig.\n\n\"One in the heart of the city, near this same Cathedral, whose lofty\nsteeple is of such delicate workmanship, that the French Emperor said it\nreminded him of Mechlin lace. The well is covered with a Gothic canopy\nsurmounted by the figure of a knight in full armor. It is all of metal,\nand proves that Matsys was an artist at the forge as well as at the\neasel; indeed his great fame is mainly derived from his miraculous skill\nas an artificer in iron.\"\n\nNext, mynheer showed the boys some exquisite Berlin castings, which he\nhad purchased in Antwerp. They were _iron jewelry_, and very\ndelicate--beautiful medallions designed from rare paintings, bordered\nwith fine tracery and open work--worthy he said of being worn by the\nfairest lady of the land. Consequently the necklace was handed with a\nbow and a smile to the blushing Mevrouw van Gend.\n\nSomething in the lady's aspect, as she bent her bright young face over\nthe gift, caused mynheer to add earnestly:\n\n\"I can read your thoughts, sweetheart.\"\n\nShe looked up in playful defiance.\n\n\"Ah! now I am sure of them. You were thinking of those noble-hearted\nwomen, but for whom Prussia might have fallen. I know it by that proud\nlight in your eye.\"\n\n\"The proud light in my eye plays me false, then,\" she answered. \"I had\nno such grand matter in my mind. To confess the simple truth, I was only\nthinking how lovely this necklace would be with my blue brocade.\"\n\n\"So! so!\" exclaimed the rather crestfallen spouse.\n\n\"But I _can_ think of the other, Jasper, and it will add a deeper value\nto your gift. You remember the incident, do you not, Peter? How when\nthe French were invading Prussia and for lack of means, the country was\nunable to defend itself against the enemy, the women turned the scale by\npouring their plate and jewels into the public treasury----\"\n\n\"Aha!\" thought mynheer, as he met his vrouw's kindling glance. \"The\nproud light is there, now, in earnest.\"\n\nPeter remarked maliciously that the women had still proved true to their\nvanity on that occasion, for jewelry they would have. If gold or silver\nwere wanted by the kingdom, they would relinquish it and use iron, but\nthey could not do without their ornaments.\n\n\"What of that?\" said the vrouw, kindling again. \"It is no sin to love\nbeautiful things, if you adapt your material to circumstances. All _I_\nhave to say is, the women saved their country and, indirectly,\nintroduced a very important branch of manufacture. Is not that so,\nJasper?\"\n\n\"Of course it is, sweetheart,\" said mynheer, \"but Peter needs no word of\nmine to convince him that all the world over, women have never been\nfound wanting in their country's hour of trial, though (bowing to\nMevrouw) his own countrywomen stand foremost in the records of female\npatriotism and devotion.\"\n\nThen turning to Ben, the host talked with him in English of the fine old\nBelgian city. Among other things, he told the origin of its name. Ben\nhad been taught that Antwerp was derived from _ae'nt werf_ (on the\nwharf), but Mynheer van Gend gave him a far more interesting derivation.\n\nIt appears that about three thousand years ago, a great giant, named\nAntigonus, lived on the river Scheld, on the site of the present city\nof Antwerp. This giant claimed half the merchandise of all navigators\nwho passed his castle. Of course some were inclined to oppose this\nsimple regulation. In such cases, Antigonus, by way of teaching them to\npractice better manners next time, cut off and threw into the river the\nright hands of the merchants. Thus hand-werpen (or hand-throwing),\nchanged to Antwerp, came to be the name of the place. The escutcheon or\narms of the city has two hands upon it; what better proof than this\ncould one have of the truth of the story, especially when one wishes to\nbelieve it!\n\nThe giant was finally conquered and thrown into the Scheld by a hero\ncalled Brabo, who in turn gave a name to the district known as Brabant.\nSince then the Dutch merchants have traveled the river in peace; but I\nfor one thank old Antigonus for giving the city so romantic an origin.\n\nWhen Mynheer van Gend had related in two languages this story of\nAntwerp, he was tempted to tell other legends--some in English, some in\nDutch; and so the moments, borne upon the swift shoulders of gnomes and\ngiants, glided rapidly away toward bedtime.\n\nIt was hard to break up so pleasant a party, but the Van Gend household\nmoved with the regularity of clockwork. There was no lingering at the\nthreshold when the cordial \"good-night!\" was spoken. Even while our boys\nwere mounting the stairs, the invisible household fairies again\nclustered around them, whispering that system and regularity had been\nchief builders of the master's prosperity.\n\nBeautiful chambers with three beds in them, were not to be found in\nthis mansion. Some of the rooms contained two, but each visitor slept\nalone. Before morning, the motto of the party evidently was, \"every boy\nhis own chrysalis\"--and Peter, at least, was not sorry to have it so.\n\nTired as he was, Ben after noting a curious bell-rope in the corner,\nbegan to examine his bedclothes. Each article filled him with\nastonishment--the exquisitely fine pillow-spread trimmed with costly\nlace and embroidered with a gorgeous crest and initial, the _dekbed_\ncover (a great silk bag, large as the bed, stuffed with swan's-down) and\nthe pink satin quilts, embroidered with garlands of flowers. He could\nscarcely sleep for thinking what a queer little bed it was, so\ncomfortable and pretty, too, with all its queerness. In the morning he\nexamined the top coverlet with care, for he wished to send home a\ndescription of it in his next letter. It was a Japanese spread,\nmarvelous in texture as well as in its variety of brilliant coloring,\nand worth, as Ben afterward learned, not less than three hundred\ndollars.\n\nThe floor was of polished wooden mosaic, nearly covered with a rich\ncarpet bordered with thick, black fringe. Another room displayed a\nmargin of satin-wood around the carpet. Hung with tapestry, its walls of\ncrimson silk were topped with a gilded cornice which shot down gleams of\nlight far into the polished floor.\n\nOver the doorway of the room in which Jacob and Ben slept was a bronze\nstork who, with outstretched neck, held a lamp to light the guests into\nthe apartment. Between the two narrow beds, of carved white-wood and\nebony, stood the household treasure of the Van Gends, a massive oaken\nchair upon which the Prince of Orange had once sat, during a council\nmeeting. Opposite, stood a quaintly carved clothes-press, waxed and\npolished to the utmost, and filled with precious stores of linen; beside\nit a table holding a large Bible, whose great golden clasps looked poor\ncompared with its solid, ribbed binding made to outlast six generations.\n\nThere was a ship model on the mantel-shelf, and over it hung an old\nportrait of Peter the Great, who, you know, once gave the dockyard cats\nof Holland a fine chance to look at a king, which is one of the special\nprerogatives of cats. Peter, though czar of Russia, was not too proud to\nwork as a common shipwright in the dockyards of Saardam and Amsterdam,\nthat he might be able to introduce among his countrymen Dutch\nimprovements in ship-building. It was this willingness to be thorough in\neven the smallest beginnings that earned for him the title of Peter the\nGreat.\n\nPeter the little (comparatively speaking) was up first, the next\nmorning; knowing the punctual habits of his brother-in-law, he took good\ncare that none of the boys should oversleep themselves. A hard task he\nfound it to wake Jacob Poot; but after pulling that young gentleman out\nof bed, and, with Ben's help, dragging him about the room for a while,\nhe succeeded in arousing him.\n\nWhile Jacob was dressing, and moaning within him, because the felt\nslippers, provided him as a guest, were too tight for his swollen feet,\nPeter wrote to inform their friends at Broek of the safe arrival of his\nparty at the Hague. He also begged his mother to send word to Hans\nBrinker that Dr. Boekman had not yet reached Leyden, but that a letter\ncontaining Hans' message had been left at the hotel, where the doctor\nalways lodged during his visits to the city. \"Tell him, also,\" wrote\nPeter, \"that I shall call there again, as I pass through Leyden. The\npoor boy seemed to feel sure that 'the meester' would hasten to save his\nfather, but we, who know the gruff old gentleman better, may be\nconfident he will do no such thing. It would be a kindness to send a\nvisiting physician from Amsterdam to the cottage at once, if\nJufvrouw[25] Brinker will consent to receive any but the great king of\nthe meesters, as Dr. Boekman certainly is.\n\n[Footnote 25: In Holland, women of the lower grades of society do not\ntake the title of Mrs. (or Mevrouw) when they marry, as with us. They\nassume their husband's name, but are still called Miss (Jufvrouw,\npronounced Yuffrow).]\n\n\"You know, mother,\" added Peter, \"that I have always considered sister\nVan Gend's house as rather quiet and lonely; but I assure you, it is not\nso now. Sister says our presence has warmed it for the whole winter.\nBrother van Gend is very kind to us all. He says we make him wish that\nhe had a houseful of boys of his own. He has promised to let us ride on\nhis noble black horses. They are gentle as kittens, he says, if one have\nbut a firm touch at the rein. Ben, according to Jacob's account, is a\nglorious rider, and your son Peter is not a very bad hand at the\nbusiness; so we two are to go out together this morning mounted like\nknights of old. After we return, brother van Gend says he will lend\nJacob his English pony and obtain three extra horses; and all of the\nparty are to trot about the city, in a grand cavalcade, led on by him.\nHe will ride the black horse which father sent him from Friesland. My\nsister's pretty roan with the long white tail is lame and she will ride\nnone other; else she would accompany us. I could scarce close my eyes\nlast night after sister told me of the plan. Only the thought of poor\nHans Brinker and his sick father checked me--but for that I could have\nsung for joy. Ludwig has given us a name already--the Broek Cavalry. We\nflatter ourselves that we shall make an imposing appearance, especially\nin single file....\"\n\nThe Broek Cavalry were not disappointed. Mynheer van Gend readily\nprocured good horses; and all the boys could ride, though none were as\nperfect horsemen (or horseboys) as Peter and Ben. They saw the Hague to\ntheir hearts' content; and the Hague saw them--expressing its\napprobation, loudly, through the mouths of small boys and cart-dogs;\nsilently, through bright eyes that, not looking very deeply into things,\nshone as they looked at the handsome Carl, and twinkled with fun as a\ncertain portly youth with shaking cheeks rode past \"bumpetty, bumpetty,\nbump!\"\n\nOn their return, the boys pronounced the great porcelain stove in the\nfamily sitting-room a decidedly useful piece of furniture, for they\ncould gather round it and get warm without burning their noses or\nbringing on chilblains. It was so very large that, though hot no-where,\nit seemed to send out warmth by the houseful--Its pure white sides and\npolished brass rings made it a pretty object to look upon,\nnotwithstanding the fact that our ungrateful Ben, while growing\nthoroughly warm and comfortable beside it, concocted a satirical\nsentence for his next letter, to the effect that a stove in Holland must\nof course resemble a great tower of snow or it wouldn't be in keeping\nwith the oddity of the country.\n\nTo describe all the boys saw and did on that day and the next, would\nrender this little book a formidable volume indeed. They visited the\nbrass cannon foundry, saw the liquid fire poured into moulds and\nwatched the smiths who, half naked, stood in the shadow, like demons\nplaying with flame. They admired the grand public buildings and massive\nprivate houses, the elegant streets, and noble Bosch--pride of all\nbeauty-loving Hollanders. The palace with its brilliant mosaic floors,\nits frescoed ceilings and gorgeous ornament, filled Ben with delight; he\nwas surprised that some of the churches were so very plain--elaborate\nsometimes in external architecture, but bare and bleak within with their\nblank, whitewashed walls.\n\nIf there were no printed record, the churches of Holland would almost\ntell her story. I will not enter into the subject here, except to say\nthat Ben--who had read of her struggles and wrongs, and of the terrible\nretribution she from time to time dealt forth--could scarcely tread a\nHolland town without mentally leaping horror-stricken over the bloody\nstepping-stones of its history. He could not forget Philip of Spain nor\nthe Duke of Alva even while rejoicing in the prosperity that followed\nthe Liberation. He looked in the meekest of Dutch eyes, for something of\nthe fire that once lit the haggard faces of those desperate, lawless\nmen, who wearing with pride the title of \"beggars\" which their\noppressors had mockingly cast upon them, became the terror of land and\nsea. In Haarlem, he had wondered that the air did not still resound with\nthe cries of Alva's three thousand victims. In Leyden, his heart had\nswelled in sympathy as he thought of the long procession of scarred and\nfamished creatures who after the siege, with Adrian van der Werf at\ntheir head, tottered to the great church to sing a glorious anthem\nbecause Leyden was free! He remembered that this was even before they\nhad tasted the bread brought by the Dutch ships. They would praise God\nfirst, then eat. Thousands of trembling voices were raised in glad\nthanksgiving. For a moment, it swelled higher and higher--then suddenly\nchanged to sobbing--not one of all the multitude could sing another\nnote. But who shall say that the anthem, even to its very end, was not\nheard in Heaven!\n\nHere, in the Hague, other thoughts came to Ben--Of how Holland in later\nyears unwillingly put her head under the French yoke, and how, galled\nand lashed past endurance, she had resolutely jerked it out again. He\nliked her for that. What nation of any spirit, thought he, could be\nexpected to stand such work, paying all her wealth into a foreign\ntreasury and yielding up the flower of her youth under foreign\nconscription. It was not so very long ago, either, since English guns\nhad been heard booming close by in the German Ocean; well--all the\nfighting was over at last. Holland was a snug little monarchy now in her\nown right, and Ben, for one, was glad of it. Arrived at this charitable\nconclusion, he was prepared to enjoy to the utmost all the wonders of\nher capital; he quite delighted Mynheer van Gend with his hearty and\nintelligent interest--so, in fact, did all the boys, for a merrier, more\nobservant party never went sightseeing.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nTHROUGH THE HAGUE\n\n\nThe picture gallery, in the Maurits Huis,[26] one of the finest in the\nworld, seemed only to have flashed by the boys during a two hours'\nvisit, so much was there to admire and examine. As for the Royal Cabinet\nof curiosities, in the same building, they felt that they had but\nglanced at it though they were there nearly half a day. It seemed to\nthem that Japan had poured all her treasures within its walls. For a\nlong period, Holland, always foremost in commerce, was the only nation\nallowed to have any intercourse with Japan. One can well forego a\njourney to that country if he can but visit the Museum at the Hague.\n\n[Footnote 26: A building erected by Prince Maurice of Nassau.]\n\nRoom after room is filled with collections from the Hermit\nEmpire--Costumes peculiar to various ranks and pursuits, articles of\nornament, household utensils, weapons, armor and surgical instruments.\nThere is also an ingenious Japanese model of the Island of Desina, the\nDutch factory in Japan. It appears almost as the Island itself would if\nseen through a reversed opera-glass, and makes one feel like a Gulliver\ncoming unexpectedly upon a Japanese Lilliput. There you see hundreds of\npeople in native costumes, standing, kneeling, stooping, reaching--all\nat work, or pretending to be--and their dwellings, even their very\nfurniture, spread out before you, plain as day. In another room a huge\ntortoise shell baby-house fitted up in Dutch style and inhabited by\ndignified Dutch dolls, stands ready to tell you at a glance how people\nlive in Holland.\n\nGretel, Hilda, Katrinka, even the proud Rychie Korbes, would have been\ndelighted with this; but Peter and his gallant band passed it by without\na glance. The war implements had the honor of detaining them for an\nhour; such clubs, such murderous krits, or daggers, such firearms, and,\nabove all, such wonderful Japanese swords, quite capable of performing\nthe accredited Japanese feat, of cutting a man in two at a single\nstroke!\n\nThere were Chinese and other oriental curiosities in the collection.\nNative historical relics, too, upon which our young Dutchmen gazed very\nsoberly, though they were secretly proud to show them to Ben.\n\nThere was a model of the cabin at Saardam in which Peter the Great lived\nduring his short career as a ship-builder. Also, wallets and bowls--once\ncarried by the \"Beggar\" Confederates who, uniting under the Prince of\nOrange, had freed Holland from the tyranny of Spain; the sword of\nAdmiral Van Speyk who about ten years before had perished in voluntarily\nblowing up his own ship; and Van Tromp's armor with the marks of bullets\nupon it. Jacob looked around, hoping to see the broom which the plucky\nadmiral fastened to his mast-head--but it was not there. The waistcoat\nwhich William Third[27] of England wore during the last days of his\nlife, possessed great interest for Ben; and one and all gazed with a\nmixture of reverence and horror-worship at the identical clothing worn\nby William the Silent[27] when he was murdered at Delft by Balthazar\nGeraerts. A tawny leather doublet and plain surcoat of gray cloth, a\nsoft felt hat, and a high neck-ruff from which hung one of the\n\"Beggars'\" medals--these were not in themselves very princely objects,\nthough the doublet had a tragic interest from its dark stains, and\nbullet holes. Ben could readily believe, as he looked upon the garments,\nthat the Silent Prince, true to his greatness of character, had been\nexceedingly simple in his attire. His aristocratic prejudices were,\nhowever, decidedly shocked when Lambert told him of the way in which\nWilliam's bride first entered the Hague.\n\n[Footnote 27: William, Prince of Orange, who became King of England, was\na great grandson of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, who was\nmurdered by Geraerts (or Gerard) July 10th, 1584.]\n\n\"The beautiful Louisa de Coligny, whose father and former husband both\nhad fallen at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, was coming to be fourth\nwife to the Prince, and of course,\" said Lambert, \"we Hollanders were\ntoo gallant to allow the lady to enter the town on foot. No, sir, we\nsent (or rather my ancestors did) a clean, open post-wagon to meet her,\nwith a plank across it for her to sit upon!\"\n\n\"Very gallant indeed!\" exclaimed Ben with almost a sneer in his polite\nlaugh--\"and she the daughter of an Admiral of France.\"\n\n\"Was she? Upon my word I had nearly forgotten that. But, you see Holland\nhad very plain ways in the good old time, in fact we are a very simple,\nfrugal people to this day. The Van Gend establishment is a decided\nexception, you know.\"\n\n\"A very agreeable exception, I think,\" said Ben.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly. But, between you and me, Mynheer van Gend, though\nhe has wrought his own fortunes, can afford to be magnificent, and yet\nbe frugal.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said Ben profoundly; at the same time stroking his upper\nlip and chin, which latterly he believed had been showing delightful\nand unmistakable signs of coming dignities.\n\nWhile tramping on foot through the city, Ben often longed for a good\nEnglish sidewalk. Here, as in the other towns, there was no curb, no\nraised pavement for foot travelers--but the streets were clean and even,\nand all vehicles were kept scrupulously within a certain tract. Strange\nto say, there were nearly as many sleds as wagons to be seen, though\nthere was not a particle of snow. The sleds went scraping over the\nbricks or cobblestones; some provided with an apparatus in front for\nsprinkling water, to diminish the friction, and some rendered less\nmusical by means of a dripping oil rag, which the driver occasionally\napplied to the runners.\n\nBen was surprised at the noiseless way in which Dutch laborers do their\nwork. Even around the warehouses and docks there was no bustle, no\nshouting from one to another. A certain twitch of the pipe, or turn of\nthe head or, at most, a raising of the hand, seemed to be all the signal\nnecessary. Entire loads of cheeses or herrings are pitched from cart or\ncanal-boat into the warehouses without a word; but the passer-by must\ntake his chance of being pelted, for a Dutchman seldom looks before or\nbehind him while engaged at work.\n\nPoor Jacob Poot, who seemed destined to bear all the mishaps of the\njourney, was knocked nearly breathless by a great cheese, which a fat\nDutchman was throwing to a fellow-laborer; but he recovered himself, and\npassed on without evincing the least indignation.\n\nBen professed great sympathy on the occasion, but Jacob insisted that it\nwas \"notting.\"\n\n\"Then why did you screw your face so when it hit you?\"\n\n\"What for screw mine face?\" repeated Jacob soberly; \"vy, it vash\nde--de----\"\n\n\"The what?\" insisted Ben, maliciously.\n\n\"Vy, de--de--vat you call dis, vat you taste mit de nose?\"\n\nBen laughed.\n\n\"Oh, you mean the smell.\"\n\n\"Yesh. Dat ish it,\" said Jacob eagerly--\"it wash de shmell. I draw mine\nface for dat!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" roared Ben, \"that's a good one. A Dutch boy smell a cheese.\nYou can never make me believe _that_!\"\n\n\"Vell, it ish no matter,\" replied Jacob, trudging on beside Ben in\nperfect good humor--\"vait till you hit mit cheese--dat ish all.\"\n\nSoon he added pathetically--\"Penchamin, I no likes be call Tutch--dat\nish no goot. I bees a Hollander.\"\n\nJust as Ben was apologizing, Lambert hailed him.\n\n\"Hold up! Ben. Here is the Fish Market. There is not much to be seen at\nthis season. But we can take a look at the storks if you wish.\"\n\nBen knew that storks were held in peculiar reverence in Holland, and\nthat the bird figured upon the arms of the Capital. He had noticed\ncart-wheels placed upon the roofs of Dutch cottages to entice storks to\nsettle upon them; he had seen their huge nests, too, on many a thatched\ngable roof from Broek to the Hague. But it was winter now. The nests\nwere empty. No greedy birdlings opened their mouths--or rather their\nheads--at the approach of a great white winged thing, with outstretched\nneck and legs, bearing a dangling something for their breakfast. The\nlong-bills were far away, picking up food on African shores; and before\nthey would return in the Spring, Ben's visit to the land of dykes would\nbe over.\n\nTherefore he pressed eagerly forward, as Van Mounen led the way through\nthe fish market, anxious to see if storks in Holland were anything like\nthe melancholy specimens he had seen in the Zo\u00c3\u00b6logical Gardens of\nLondon.\n\nIt was the same old story. A tamed bird is a sad bird, say what you\nwill. These storks lived in a sort of kennel, chained by the feet like\nfelons, though supposed to be honored by being kept at the public\nexpense. In summer they were allowed to walk about the market, where the\nfish-stalls were like so many free dining-saloons to them. Untasted\ndelicacies in the form of raw fish and butcher's offals, lay about their\nkennels now, but the city-guests preferred to stand upon one leg,\ncurving back their long neck and leaning their head sidewise, in a\nblinking reverie. How gladly they would have changed their petted state,\nfor the busy life of some hard-working stork mother, or father, bringing\nup a troublesome family on the roof of a rickety old building, where\nflapping windmills frightened them half to death every time they\nventured forth on a frolic.\n\nBen soon made up his mind, and rightly, too, that the Hague with its\nfine streets and public parks shaded with elms, was a magnificent city.\nThe prevailing costume was like that of London or Paris, and his British\nears were many a time cheered by the music of British words. The shops\nwere different in many respects from those on Oxford Street and the\nStrand, but they often were illumined by a printed announcement that\nEnglish was \"spoken within.\" Others proclaimed themselves to have\nLondon Stout for sale--and one actually promised to regale its customers\nwith ENGLISH ROAST BEEF.\n\nOver every possible shop-door was the never-failing placard, \"Tabak te\nKoop\" (tobacco to be sold). Instead of colored glass globes in the\nwindows, or high jars of leeches, the drug-stores had a gaping Turk's\nhead at the entrance--or, if the establishment were particularly fine, a\nwooden mandarin entire, indulging in a full yawn.\n\nSome of these queer faces amused Ben exceedingly; they seemed to have\njust swallowed a dose of physic; but Van Mounen declared he could not\nsee anything funny about them. A druggist showed his sense by putting a\n_Gaper_ before his door, so that his place could be known at once as an\n\"apotheek\" and that was all there was about it.\n\nAnother thing attracted Ben--the milkmen's carts. These were small\naffairs, filled with shiny brass kettles, or stone jars, and drawn by\ndogs. The milkman walked meekly beside his cart, keeping his dog in\norder, and delivering the milk to customers. Certain fish dealers had\ndog-carts, also, and when a herring-dog chanced to meet a milk-dog, he\ninvariably put on airs and growled as he passed him. Sometimes a\nmilk-dog would recognize an acquaintance before another milk-cart across\nthe street, and then how the kettles would rattle, especially if they\nwere empty! Each dog would give a bound and, never caring for his\nmaster's whistle, insist upon meeting the other half-way. Sometimes they\ncontented themselves with an inquisitive sniff, but generally the\nsmaller dog made an affectionate snap at the larger one's ear, or a\nfriendly tussle was engaged in by way of exercise. Then wo! to the milk\nkettles, and wo! to the dogs!\n\nThe whipping over, each dog, expressing his feelings as best he could,\nwould trot leisurely back to his work.\n\nIf some of these animals were eccentric in their ways, others were\nremarkably well-behaved. In fact, there was a school for dogs in the\ncity, established expressly for training them; Ben probably saw some of\nits graduates. Many a time he noticed a span of barkers trotting along\nthe street with all the dignity of horses, obeying the slightest hint of\nthe man walking briskly beside them. Sometimes, when their load was\ndelivered, the dealer would jump in the cart, and have a fine drive to\nhis home beyond the gates of the city; and sometimes, I regret to say, a\npatient vrouw would trudge beside the cart, with fish-basket upon her\nhead, and a child in her arms--while her lord enjoyed his drive,\ncarrying no heavier burden than a stumpy clay pipe, the smoke of which\nmounted lovingly into her face.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nA DAY OF REST\n\n\nThe sightseeing came to an end at last, and so did our boys' visit to\nthe Hague. They had spent three happy days and nights with the Van\nGends, and, strange to say, had not once, in all that time, put on\nskates. The third day had indeed been one of rest. The noise and bustle\nof the city was hushed; sweet Sunday bells sent blessed, tranquil\nthoughts into their hearts. Ben felt, as he listened to their familiar\nmusic, that the Christian world is one, after all, however divided by\nsects and differences it may be. As the clock speaks every one's native\nlanguage in whatever land it may strike the hour, so church-bells are\nnever foreign if our hearts but listen.\n\nLed on by those clear voices, our party, with Mevrouw van Gend and her\nhusband, trod the quiet but crowded streets, until they came to a fine\nold church in the southern part of the city.\n\nThe interior was large and, notwithstanding its great stained windows,\nseemed dimly lighted, though the walls were white, and dashes of red and\npurple sunshine lay brightly upon pillar and pew.\n\nBen saw a few old women moving softly through the aisles, each bearing a\nhigh pile of foot-stoves which she distributed among the congregation by\nskillfully slipping out the under one, until none were left. It puzzled\nhim that mynheer should settle himself with the boys in a comfortable\nside-pew, after seating his vrouw in the body of the church, which was\nfilled with chairs exclusively appropriated to the women. But Ben was\nlearning only a common custom of the country.\n\nThe pews of the nobility and the dignitaries of the city were circular\nin form, each surrounding a column. Elaborately carved, they formed a\nmassive base to their great pillars standing out in bold relief against\nthe blank, white walls beyond. These columns, lofty and\nwell-proportioned, were nicked and defaced from violence done to them\nlong ago; yet it seemed quite fitting that, before they were lost in the\ndeep arches overhead, their softened outlines should leaf out as they\ndid into richness and beauty.\n\nSoon, Ben lowered his gaze to the marble floor. It was a pavement of\ngravestones. Nearly all the large slabs, of which it was composed,\nmarked the resting-places of the dead. An armorial design engraved upon\neach stone, with inscription and date, told whose form was sleeping\nbeneath, and sometimes three of a family were lying one above the other\nin the same sepulchre.\n\nHe could not but think of the solemn funeral procession winding by\ntorch-light through those lofty aisles, and bearing its silent burden\ntoward a dark opening whence a slab had been lifted, in readiness for\nits coming. It was something to feel that his sister Mabel, who died in\nher flower, was lying in a sunny church-yard, where a brook rippled and\nsparkled in the daylight, and waving trees whispered together all night\nlong; where flowers might nestle close to the headstone and moon and\nstars shed their peace upon it, and morning birds sing sweetly overhead.\n\nThen he looked up from the pavement and rested his eyes upon the carved,\noaken pulpit, exquisitely beautiful in design and workmanship. He could\nnot see the minister--though, not long before, he had watched him slowly\nascending its winding stair--a mild-faced man wearing a ruff about his\nneck, and a short cloak reaching nearly to the knee.\n\nMeantime the great church had been silently filling. Its pews were\nsombre with men and its centre radiant with women in their fresh Sunday\nattire. Suddenly a soft rustling spread through the building. All eyes\nwere turned toward the minister now appearing above the pulpit.\n\nAlthough the sermon was spoken slowly, Ben could understand little of\nwhat was said; but when the hymn came, he joined in with all his heart.\nA thousand voices lifted in love and praise, offered a grander language\nthat he could readily comprehend.\n\nOnce he was startled, during a pause in the service, by seeing a little\nbag suddenly shaken before him. It had a tinkling bell at its side, and\nwas attached to a long stick carried by one of the deacons of the\nchurch. Not relying solely upon the mute appeal of the poor-boxes\nfastened to the columns near the entrance, this more direct method was\nresorted to, of awaking the sympathies of the charitable.\n\nFortunately Ben had provided himself with a few stivers, or the musical\nbag must have tinkled before him in vain.\n\nMore than once, a dark look rose on our English boy's face that morning.\nHe longed to stand up and harangue the people concerning a peculiarity\nthat filled him with pain. Some of the men wore their hats during the\nservice, or took them off whenever the humor prompted, and many put\ntheirs on in the church as soon as they arose to leave. No wonder Ben's\nsense of propriety was wounded; and yet a higher sense would have been\nexercised had he tried to feel willing that Hollanders should follow the\ncustoms of their country. But his English heart said over and over again\n\"it is outrageous! it is sinful!\"\n\nThere is an Angel called Charity who often would save our hearts a great\ndeal of trouble if we would but let her in.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND\n\n\nOn Monday morning, bright and early, our boys bade farewell to their\nkind entertainers and started on their homeward journey.\n\nPeter lingered a while at the lion-guarded door, for he and his sister\nhad many parting words to say.\n\nAs Ben saw them bidding each other \"good-bye,\" he could not help feeling\nthat kisses as well as clocks were wonderfully alike everywhere. The\nEnglish kiss that his sister Jennie gave when he left home had said the\nsame thing to him that the Vrouw van Gend's Dutch kiss said to Peter.\nLudwig had taken his share of the farewell in the most matter-of-fact\nmanner possible, and though he loved his sister well, had winced a\nlittle at her making such a child of him as to put an extra kiss \"for\nmother\" upon his forehead.\n\nHe was already upon the canal with Carl and Jacob. Were they thinking\nabout sisters or kisses? Not a bit of it. They were so happy to be on\nskates once more, so impatient to dart at once into the very heart of\nBroek, that they spun and wheeled about like crazy fellows, relieving\nthemselves, meantime, by muttering something about \"Peter and donder\"\nnot worth translating.\n\nEven Lambert and Ben who had been waiting at the street-corner began to\ngrow impatient.\n\nThe captain joined them at last; they were soon on the canal with the\nrest.\n\n\"Hurry up, Peter,\" growled Ludwig--\"we're freezing by inches--there! I\nknew you'd be the last after all to get on your skates!\"\n\n\"Did you?\" said his brother looking up with an air of deep\ninterest--\"clever boy!\"\n\nLudwig laughed, but tried to look cross, as he said--\"I'm in earnest,\nanyhow. We must get home some time this year.\"\n\n\"Now, boys,\" cried Peter springing up, as he fastened the last buckle.\n\"There's a clear way before us! We will imagine it's the grand race.\nReady! One--two--three--START!\"\n\nI assure you very little was said for the first half hour. They were six\nMercuries skimming the ice. In plain English they went like\nlightning--no, that is imaginary too. The fact is, one cannot decide\nwhat to say when half a dozen boys are whizzing past at such a rate. I\ncan only tell you that each did his best, flying, with bent body, and\neager eyes, in and out among the placid skaters on the canal, until the\nvery guard shouted to them to \"hold up!\" This only served to send them\nonward with a two-boy power that startled all beholders.\n\nBut the laws of inertia are stronger even than canal guards.\n\nAfter a while Jacob slackened his speed--then Ludwig--then Lambert--then\nCarl.\n\nThey soon halted to take a long breath, and finally found themselves\nstanding in a group gazing after Peter and Ben who were still racing in\nthe distance as if their lives were at stake.\n\n\"It is very evident,\" said Lambert, as he and his three companions\nstarted on again, \"that neither of them will give up until he can't help\nit.\"\n\n\"What foolishness!\" growled Carl, \"to tire themselves at the beginning\nof the journey--but they're racing in earnest--that's certain. Hallo!\nPeter's flagging!\"\n\n\"Not so!\" cried Ludwig--\"catch him being beaten!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" sneered Carl. \"I tell you, boy, Benjamin is ahead.\"\n\nNow if Ludwig disliked anything in this world, it was to be called a\nboy--probably because he was nothing else. He grew indignant at once.\n\n\"Humph, what are _you_, I wonder. There, sir! _now_ look and see if\nPeter isn't ahead!\"\n\n\"_I_ think he _is_,\" interposed Lambert, \"but I can't quite tell at this\ndistance.\"\n\n\"_I_ think he isn't!\" retorted Carl.\n\nJacob was growing anxious--he always abhorred an argument--so he said in\na coaxing tone--\"Don't quarrel--don't quarrel!\"\n\n\"Don't quarrel!\" mocked Carl, looking back at Jacob as he skated. \"Who's\nquarreling? Poot, you're a goose!\"\n\n\"I can't help that,\" was Jacob's meek reply. \"See! they are nearing the\nturn of the canal.\"\n\n\"_Now_ we can see!\" cried Ludwig in great excitement.\n\n\"Peter will make it first, I know.\"\n\n\"He can't--for Ben is ahead!\" insisted Carl. \"Gunst! That ice-boat will\nrun over him. No! he is clear! They're a couple of geese anyhow. Hurrah!\nthey're at the turn. Who's ahead?\"\n\n\"PETER!\" cried Ludwig, joyfully.\n\n\"Good for the captain!\" shouted Lambert and Jacob.\n\nAnd Carl condescended to mutter:\n\n\"It _is_ Peter after all. I thought, all the time, that head fellow was\nBen.\"\n\nThis turn in the canal had evidently been their goal, for the two racers\ncame to a sudden halt after passing it.\n\nCarl said something about being \"glad that they had sense enough to stop\nand rest,\"--and the four boys skated on in silence to overtake their\ncompanions.\n\nAll the while, Carl was secretly wishing that he had kept on with Peter\nand Ben, as he felt sure he could easily have come out winner. He was a\nvery rapid, though by no means a graceful skater.\n\nBen was looking at Peter with mingled vexation, admiration and surprise,\nas the boys drew near.\n\nThey heard him saying in English:\n\n\"You're a perfect bird on the ice, Peter van Holp. The first fellow that\never beat me in a fair race, I can tell you!\"\n\nPeter, who understood the language better than he could speak it,\nreturned a laughing bow at Ben's compliment, but made no further reply.\nPossibly he was scant of breath at the time.\n\n\"Now, Penchamin, vat you do mit yourself? get so hot as a\nfire-brick--dat ish no goot,\" was Jacob's plaintive comment.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" answered Ben. \"This frosty air will cool me soon enough. I\nam not tired.\"\n\n\"You are beaten, though, my boy,\" said Lambert in English, \"and fairly,\ntoo. How will it be, I wonder, on the day of the grand race?\"\n\nBen flushed, and gave a proud, defiant laugh, as if to say:\n\n\"This was mere pastime. I'm _determined_ to beat then, come what will!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\nBOYS AND GIRLS\n\n\nBy the time the boys reached the village of Voorhout which stands near\nthe grand canal, about half-way between the Hague and Haarlem, they were\nforced to hold a council. The wind, though moderate at first, had grown\nstronger and stronger, until at last they could hardly skate against it.\nThe weather-vanes throughout the country had evidently entered into a\nconspiracy.\n\n\"No use trying to face such a blow as this,\" said Ludwig. \"It cuts its\nway down a man's throat like a knife.\"\n\n\"Keep your mouth shut, then,\" grunted the affable Carl, who was\nstrong-chested as a young ox. \"I'm for keeping on.\"\n\n\"In this case,\" interposed Peter, \"we must consult the weakest of the\nparty rather than the strongest.\"\n\nThe captain's principle was all right, but its application was not\nflattering to Master Ludwig; shrugging his shoulders, he retorted:\n\n\"Who's weak? Not I, for one--but the wind's stronger than any of us. I\nhope you'll condescend to admit that!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Van Mounen, who could barely keep his feet, \"so it\nis.\"\n\nJust then the weather-vanes telegraphed to each other by a peculiar\ntwitch--and, in an instant, the gust came. It nearly threw the\nstrong-chested Carl; it almost strangled Jacob; and quite upset Ludwig.\n\n\"This settles the question,\" shouted Peter; \"off with your skates! We'll\ngo into Voorhout.\"\n\nAt Voorhout they found a little inn with a big yard. The yard was well\nbricked, and better than all, was provided with a complete set of\nskittles, so our boys soon turned the detention into a frolic. The wind\nwas troublesome even in that sheltered quarter, but they were on good\nstanding-ground--and did not mind it.\n\nFirst a hearty dinner--then the game. With pins as long as their arms,\nand balls as big as their heads, plenty of strength left for rolling,\nand a clean sweep of sixty yards for the strokes--no wonder they were\nhappy.\n\nThat night Captain Peter and his men slept soundly. No prowling robber\ncame to disturb them; and, as they were distributed in separate rooms,\nthey did not even have a bolster-battle in the morning.\n\nSuch a breakfast as they ate! The landlord looked frightened. When he\nhad asked them where they \"belonged,\" he made up his mind that the Broek\npeople starved their children. It was a shame, \"such fine young\ngentlemen, too!\"\n\nFortunately the wind had tired itself out, and fallen asleep in the\ngreat sea-cradle beyond the Dunes. There were signs of snow; otherwise,\nthe weather was fine.\n\nIt was mere child's-play for the well-rested boys to skate to Leyden.\nHere they halted a while, for Peter had an errand at the \"Golden Eagle.\"\nHe left the city with a lightened heart; Dr. Boekman had been at the\nhotel, read the note containing Hans' message, and departed for Broek.\n\n\"I cannot say it was your letter sent him off so soon,\" explained the\nlandlord; \"some rich lady in Broek was taken bad very sudden, and he\nwas sent for in haste.\"\n\nPeter turned pale.\n\n\"What was the name?\" he asked.\n\n\"Indeed, it went in one ear, and out of the other--for all I hindered\nit. Plague to people who can't see a traveler in comfortable lodgings,\nbut they must whisk him off, before one can breathe.\"\n\n\"A lady in Broek, did you say?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" very gruffly; \"and other business, young master?\"\n\n\"No, mine host--except that I and my comrades here would like a bite of\nsomething, and a drink of hot coffee.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the landlord, sweetly, \"a bite you shall have, and coffee\ntoo, the finest in Leyden. Walk up to the stove, my masters--now I think\nagain--that was a widow lady--from Rotterdam, I think they\nsaid--visiting at one Van Stoepel's if I mistake not.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Peter, greatly relieved. \"They live in the white house by the\nSchlossen Mill--now, mynheer, the coffee, please!\"\n\n\"What a goose I was,\" thought he, as the party left the Golden Eagle,\n\"to feel so sure it was my mother--but she may be somebody's mother,\npoor woman, for all that. Who can she be, I wonder?\"\n\nThere were not many upon the canal that day, between Leyden and Haarlem.\nHowever, as the boys neared Amsterdam, they found themselves once more\nin the midst of a moving throng. The big _Ysbreeker_[28]\n\n[Footnote 28: Ice-breaker--A heavy machine armed with iron spikes for\nbreaking the ice as it is dragged along. Some of the small ones are\nworked by men--but the large ones are drawn by horses--sixty or seventy\nof which are sometimes attached to one Ysbreeker.] had been at work for\nthe first time that season, but there was any amount of skating ground\nleft yet.\n\n\"Three cheers for home!\" cried Van Mounen, as they came in sight of the\ngreat Western dock (Westelijk Dok). \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" shouted one and\nall. \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\"\n\nThis trick of cheering was an importation among our party. Lambert van\nMounen had brought it from England. As they always gave it in English,\nit was considered quite an exploit and, when circumstances permitted,\nalways enthusiastically performed, to the sore dismay of their\nquiet-loving countrymen.\n\nTherefore, their arrival at Amsterdam created a great sensation,\nespecially among the small boys on the wharfs.\n\nThe Y was crossed. They were on the Broek canal.\n\nLambert's home was reached first.\n\n\"Good-bye, boys!\" he cried, as he left them. \"We've had the greatest\nfrolic ever known in Holland.\"\n\n\"So we have. Good-bye, Van Mounen!\" answered the boys.\n\n\"Good-bye!\"\n\nPeter hailed him. \"I say, Van Mounen, the classes begin to-morrow!\"\n\n\"I know it. Our holiday is over. Good-bye, again.\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\"\n\nBroek came in sight. Such meetings! Katrinka was on the canal! Carl was\ndelighted. Hilda was there! Peter felt rested in an instant. Rychie was\nthere! Ludwig and Jacob nearly knocked each other over in their\neagerness to shake hands with her.\n\nDutch girls are modest and generally quiet; but they have very glad\neyes. For a few moments, it was hard to decide whether Hilda, Rychie or\nKatrinka felt the most happy.\n\nAnnie Bouman was also on the canal, looking even prettier than the other\nmaidens, in her graceful, peasant's costume. But she did not mingle with\nRychie's party; neither did she look unusually happy.\n\nThe one she liked most to see was not among the newcomers. Indeed he was\nnot upon the canal at all. She had not been near Broek before, since the\nEve of St. Nicholas, for she was staying with her sick grandmother in\nAmsterdam, and had been granted a brief resting-spell, as the\ngrandmother called it, because she had been such a faithful little nurse\nnight and day.\n\nAnnie had devoted her resting-spell to skating with all her might toward\nBroek, and back again, in the hope of meeting her mother or some of her\nfamily on the canal, or, it might be, Gretel Brinker--Not one of them\nhad she seen--and she must hurry back, without ever catching a glimpse\nof her mother's cottage--for the poor helpless grandmother, she knew,\nwas by this time moaning for some one to turn her upon her cot.\n\nWhere can Gretel be? thought Annie, as she flew over the ice; she can\nalmost always steal a few moments from her work at this time of\nday--poor Gretel--what a dreadful thing it must be to have a dull\nfather--I should be wofully afraid of him, I know--So strong, and yet so\nstrange!\n\nAnnie had not heard of his illness. Dame Brinker and her affairs\nreceived but little notice from the people of the place.\n\nIf Gretel had not been known as a goose-girl she might have had more\nfriends among the peasantry of the neighborhood. As it was, Annie Bouman\nwas the only one who did not feel ashamed to avow herself by word and\ndeed the companion of Gretel and Hans.\n\nWhen the neighbors' children laughed at her for keeping such poor\ncompany, she would simply flush when Hans was ridiculed, or laugh in a\ncareless, disdainful way; but to hear little Gretel abused always\nawakened her wrath.\n\n\"Goose-girl, indeed!\" she would say. \"I can tell you any of you are\nfitter for the work than she. My father often said last summer that it\ntroubled him to see such a bright-eyed, patient little maiden tending\ngeese. Humph! She would not harm them, as you would, Janzoon Kolp; and\nshe would not tread upon them, as you might, Kate Wouters.\"\n\nThis would be pretty sure to start a laugh at the clumsy, ill-natured\nKate's expense; and Annie would walk loftily away from the group of\nyoung gossips. Perhaps some memory of Gretel's assailants crossed her\nmind as she skated rapidly toward Amsterdam, for her eyes sparkled\nominously and she more than once gave her pretty head a defiant toss.\nWhen that mood passed, such a bright, rosy, affectionate look illumined\nher face, that more than one weary working man turned to gaze after her,\nand to wish that he had a glad contented lass like that for a daughter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were five joyous households in Broek that night.\n\nThe boys were back safe and sound; and they found all well at home. Even\nthe sick lady at neighbor Van Stoepel's was out of danger.\n\nBut the next morning! Ah, how stupidly school-bells will ding-dong!\nding-dong, when one is tired.\n\nLudwig was sure he had never listened to anything so odious. Even Peter\nfelt pathetic on the occasion. Carl said it was a shame for a fellow to\nhave to turn out when his bones were splitting--and Jacob soberly bade\nBen \"Goot-Pye!\" and walked off with his satchel as if it weighed a\nhundred pounds.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\nTHE CRISIS\n\n\nWhile the boys are nursing their fatigue, we will take a peep into the\nBrinker cottage.\n\nCan it be that Gretel and her mother have not stirred since we saw them\nlast? That the sick man upon the bed has not even turned over? It was\nfour days ago and there is the sad group just as it was before. No, not\nprecisely the same, for Raff Brinker is paler; his fever is gone, though\nhe knows nothing of what is passing. Then, they were alone in the bare,\nclean room. Now there is another group in an opposite corner.\n\nDr. Boekman is there, talking in a low tone with a stout young man who\nlistens intently. The stout young man is his student and assistant. Hans\nis there also. He stands near the window respectfully waiting until he\nshall be accosted.\n\n\"You see, Vollenhoven,\" said Dr. Boekman, \"it is a clear case of\"--and\nhere the doctor went off into a queer jumble of Latin and Dutch that I\ncannot conveniently translate.\n\nAfter a while, as Vollenhoven looked at him rather blankly, the learned\nman condescended to speak to him in simpler phrase.\n\n\"It is probably like Rip Donderdunck's case,\" he explained, in a low,\nmumbling tone. \"He fell from the top of Voppelploot's windmill. After\nthe accident the man was stupid, and finally became idiotic. In time he\nlay helpless like yon fellow on the bed, moaned, too, like him, and\nkept constantly lifting his hand to his head. My learned friend Von\nChoppem performed an operation upon this Donderdunck, and discovered\nunder the skull a small dark sac, which pressed upon the brain. This had\nbeen the cause of the trouble. My friend Von Choppem removed it--a\nsplendid operation! You see according to Celsus\"--and here the doctor\nagain went off into Latin.\n\n\"Did the man live?\" asked the assistant, respectfully.\n\nDr. Boekman scowled. \"That is of no consequence. I believe he died, but\nwhy not fix your mind on the grand features of the case. Consider a\nmoment how\"--and he plunged into Latin mysteries more deeply than ever.\n\n\"But, mynheer,\" gently persisted the student, who knew that the doctor\nwould not rise to the surface for hours unless pulled at once from his\nfavorite depths. \"Mynheer, you have other engagements to-day, three legs\nin Amsterdam, you remember, and an eye in Broek, and that tumor up the\ncanal.\"\n\n\"The tumor can wait,\" said the doctor reflectively. \"That is another\nbeautiful case--a beautiful case! The woman has not lifted her head from\nher shoulder for two months--magnificent tumor, sir!\"\n\nThe doctor by this time was speaking aloud. He had quite forgotten where\nhe was.\n\nVollenhoven made another attempt.\n\n\"This poor fellow on the bed, mynheer. Do you think you can save him?\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed, certainly,\" stammered the doctor, suddenly perceiving that\nhe had been talking rather off the point--\"certainly, that is--I hope\nso----\"\n\n\"If any one in Holland can, mynheer,\" murmured the assistant with honest\nbluntness--\"it is yourself.\"\n\nThe doctor looked displeased--growled out a tender request for the\nstudent to talk less, and beckoned Hans to draw near.\n\nThis strange man had a great horror of speaking to women, especially on\nsurgical matters. \"One can never tell,\" he said, \"what moment the\ncreatures will scream or faint.\" Therefore he explained Raff Brinker's\ncase to Hans and told him what he believed should be done to save the\npatient.\n\nHans listened attentively, growing red and pale by turns, and throwing\nquick, anxious glances toward the bed.\n\n\"It may _kill_ the father--did you say, mynheer?\" he exclaimed at last,\nin a trembling whisper.\n\n\"It may, my boy. But I have a strong belief that it will cure and not\nkill. Ah! if boys were not such dunces, I could lay the whole matter\nbefore you, but it would be of no use.\"\n\nHans looked blank at this compliment.\n\n\"It would be of no use,\" repeated Dr. Boekman indignantly; \"a great\noperation is proposed--but one might as well do it with a hatchet. The\nonly question asked is--'will it kill?'\"\n\n\"The question is _everything_ to us, mynheer,\" said Hans, with tearful\ndignity.\n\nDr. Boekman looked at him in sudden dismay.\n\n\"Ah! exactly so. You are right, boy, I am a fool. Good boy. One does not\nwish one's father killed--of course not. I am a fool.\"\n\n\"Will he die, mynheer, if this sickness goes on?\"\n\n\"Humph! this is no new illness. The same thing growing worse every\ninstant--pressure on the brain--will take him off soon like _that_,\"\nsaid the doctor, snapping his fingers.\n\n\"And the operation _may_ save him,\" pursued Hans. \"How soon, mynheer,\ncan we know?\"\n\nDr. Boekman grew impatient.\n\n\"In a day, perhaps, an hour. Talk with your mother, boy, and let her\ndecide. My time is short.\"\n\nHans approached his mother; at first, when she looked up at him, he\ncould not utter a syllable; then turning his eyes away he said in a firm\nvoice:\n\n\"I must speak with the mother alone.\"\n\nQuick little Gretel, who could not quite understand what was passing,\nthrew rather an indignant look at Hans, and walked away.\n\n\"Come back, Gretel, and sit down,\" said Hans sorrowfully.\n\nShe obeyed.\n\nDame Brinker and her boy stood by the window while the doctor and his\nassistant, bending over the bed-side, conversed together in a low tone.\nThere was no danger of disturbing the patient. He appeared like one\nblind and deaf. Only his faint, piteous moans showed him to be a living\nman. Hans was talking earnestly, and in a low voice, for he did not wish\nhis sister to hear.\n\nWith dry, parted lips, Dame Brinker leaned toward him searching his\nface, as if suspecting a meaning beyond his words. Once she gave a\nquick, frightened sob that made Gretel start, but, after that, listened\ncalmly.\n\nWhen Hans ceased to speak, his mother turned, gave one long, agonized\nlook at her husband, lying there so pale and unconscious, and threw\nherself on her knees, beside the bed.\n\nPoor little Gretel! what did all this mean? She looked with questioning\neyes at Hans; he was standing, but his head was bent as if in\nprayer;--at the doctor; he was gently feeling her father's head, and\nlooked like one examining some curious stone;--at the assistant; the man\ncoughed and turned away;--at her mother; Ah! little Gretel, that was the\nbest you could do--to kneel beside her and twine your warm, young arms\nabout her neck--to weep and implore God to listen.\n\nWhen the mother arose, Dr. Boekman, with a show of trouble in his eyes,\nasked gruffly, \"Well, jufvrouw, shall it be done?\"\n\n\"Will it pain him, mynheer?\" she asked in a trembling voice.\n\n\"I cannot say. Probably not. Shall it be done?\"\n\n\"It may _cure_ him, you said, and--mynheer, did you tell my boy\nthat--perhaps--perhaps\"--she could not finish.\n\n\"Yes, jufvrouw, I said the patient might sink under the operation--but\nwe will hope it may prove otherwise.\" (He looked at his watch. The\nassistant moved impatiently toward the window.) \"Come, jufvrouw, time\npresses. Yes, or no?\"\n\nHans wound his arm about his mother. It was not his usual way. He even\nleaned his head against her shoulder.\n\n\"The meester awaits an answer,\" he whispered.\n\nDame Brinker had long been the head of her house in every sense--Many a\ntime she had been very stern with Hans, ruling him with a strong hand,\nand rejoicing in her motherly discipline--_now_ she felt so weak, so\nhelpless. It was something to feel that firm embrace. There was strength\neven in the touch of that yellow hair.\n\nShe turned to her boy imploringly.\n\n\"Oh, Hans! What shall I say?\"\n\n\"Say what God tells thee, mother,\" answered Hans, bowing his head.\n\nOne quick, questioning prayer to Heaven rose from the mother's heart.\n\nThe answer came.\n\nShe turned toward Dr. Boekman.\n\n\"It is right, mynheer. I consent.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" grunted the doctor, as if to say you've been long enough about\nit. Then he conferred a moment with his assistant, who listened with\ngreat outward deference but was inwardly rejoicing at the grand joke he\nwould have to tell his fellow students. He had actually seen a tear in\n\"old Boekman's\" eye.\n\nMeanwhile Gretel looked on in trembling silence--but when she saw the\ndoctor open a leathern case, and take out one sharp, gleaming instrument\nafter another, she sprang forward.\n\n\"Oh mother--the poor father meant no wrong. Are they going to _murder_\nhim?\"\n\n\"I do not know, child,\" screamed Dame Brinker looking fiercely at\nGretel. \"I DO NOT KNOW.\"\n\n\"This will not do, jufvrouw,\" said Dr. Boekman sternly, and at the same\ntime he cast a quick, penetrating look at Hans--\"you and the girl must\nleave the room. The boy may stay.\"\n\nDame Brinker drew herself up in an instant. Her eyes flashed. Her whole\ncountenance was changed. She looked like one who had never wept, never\nfelt a moment's weakness. Her voice was low but decided. \"I stay with my\nhusband, mynheer.\"\n\nDr. Boekman looked astonished. His orders were seldom disregarded in\nthis style. For an instant his eye met hers.\n\n\"You may remain, jufvrouw,\" he said in an altered voice.\n\nGretel had already disappeared.\n\nIn one corner of the cottage was a small closet where her rough,\nbox-like bed was fastened against the wall: none would think of the\ntrembling little creature crouching there in the dark.\n\nDr. Boekman took off his heavy coat; he filled an earthen basin with\nwater and placed it near the bed. Then turning to Hans he asked:\n\n\"Can I depend upon you, boy?\"\n\n\"You can, mynheer.\"\n\n\"I believe you. Stand at the head, here--your mother may sit at your\nright--so,\" and he placed a chair near the cot.\n\n\"Remember, jufvrouw, there must be no cries, no fainting.\"\n\nDame Brinker answered him with a look.\n\nHe was satisfied.\n\n\"Now, Vollenhoven.\"\n\nOh! that case with the terrible instruments. The assistant lifted them.\nGretel who had been peering, with brimming eyes, through the crack of\nthe closet door, could remain silent no longer.\n\nShe rushed frantically across the apartment, seized her hood, and ran\nfrom the cottage.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nGRETEL AND HILDA\n\n\nIt was recess-hour. At the first stroke of the school-house bell, the\ncanal seemed to give a tremendous shout, and grow suddenly alive with\nboys and girls. The sly thing, shining so quietly under the noonday sun,\nwas a kaleidoscope at heart, and only needed a shake from that great\nclapper to start it into dazzling changes.\n\nDozens of gaily clad children were skating in and out among each other,\nand all their pent-up merriment of the morning was relieving itself in\nsong and shout and laughter. There was nothing to check the flow of\nfrolic. Not a thought of school-books came out with them into the\nsunshine. Latin, Arithmetic, Grammar, all were locked up for an hour in\nthe dingy schoolroom. The teacher might be a noun if he wished, and a\nproper one at that, but _they_ meant to enjoy themselves. As long as the\nskating was as perfect as this, it made no difference whether Holland\nwere on the North Pole or the Equator; and, as for Philosophy, how could\nthey bother themselves about inertia and gravitation and such things,\nwhen it was as much as they could do to keep from getting knocked over\nin the commotion.\n\nIn the height of the fun, one of the children called out:\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"What? Where?\" cried a dozen voices.\n\n\"Why--don't you see? That dark thing over there by the idiot's\ncottage.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything,\" said one.\n\n\"I do,\" shouted another, \"it's a dog!\"\n\n\"Where's any dog?\" put in a squeaky voice that we have heard\nbefore--\"It's no such thing--it's a heap of rags.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Voost,\" retorted another gruffly, \"that's about as near the fact\nas you ever get; it's the goose-girl, Gretel, looking for rats.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" squeaked Voost; \"isn't _she_ a bundle of rags, I'd\nlike to know?\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! Pretty good for you, Voost! You'll get a medal for wit yet, if\nyou keep on.\"\n\n\"You'd get something else, if her brother Hans were here. I'll warrant\nyou would!\" said a muffled up little fellow, with a cold in his head.\n\nAs Hans was _not_ there, Voost could afford to scout the insinuation.\n\n\"Who cares for _him_, little sneezer? I'd fight a dozen like him any\nday, and you in the bargain.\"\n\n\"You would! would you? I'd like to catch you at it,\" and, by way of\nproving his words, the sneezer skated off at the top of his speed.\n\nJust then a general chase after three of the biggest boys of the school\nwas proposed,--and friend and foe, frolicsome as ever, were soon united\nin a common cause.\n\nOnly one of all that happy throng remembered the dark little form by the\nidiot's cottage. Poor, frightened Gretel! She was not thinking of them,\nthough their merry laughter floated lightly toward her, making her feel\nlike one in a dream.\n\nHow loud the moans were behind the darkened window--What if those\nstrange men were really killing her father!\n\nThe thought made her spring to her feet with a cry of horror!\n\n\"Ah! no,\" she sobbed, sinking upon the frozen mound of earth where she\nhad been sitting, \"mother is there, and Hans. They will care for him.\nBut how pale they were. And even Hans was crying!\n\n\"Why did the cross old meester keep _him_, and send me away,\" she\nthought. \"I could have clung to the mother and kissed her. That always\nmakes her stroke my hair and speak gentle, even after she has scolded\nme. How quiet it is now! Oh, if the father should die, and Hans, and the\nmother, what _would_ I do?\" and Gretel, shivering with cold, buried her\nface in her arms, and cried as if her heart would break.\n\nThe poor child had been tasked beyond her strength during the past four\ndays. Through all, she had been her mother's willing little handmaiden,\nsoothing, helping and cheering the half-widowed woman by day, and\nwatching and praying beside her all the long night. She knew that\nsomething terrible and mysterious was taking place at this moment,\nsomething that had been too terrible and mysterious for even kind, good\nHans to tell.\n\nThen new thoughts came. Why had not Hans told her? It was a shame. It\nwas _her_ father as well as his. She was no baby. She had once taken a\nsharp knife from the father's hand. She had even drawn him away from the\nmother on that awful night when Hans, big as he was, could not help her.\nWhy then must she be treated like one who could do nothing? Oh, how very\nstill it was--how bitter, bitter cold! If Annie Bouman had only stayed\nhome instead of going to Amsterdam it wouldn't be so lonely. How cold\nher feet were growing--was it the moaning that made her feel as if she\nwere floating in the air!\n\nThis would not do--the mother might need her help at any moment!\n\nRousing herself with an effort, Gretel sat upright, rubbing her eyes and\nwondering--wondering that the sky was so bright and blue--wondering at\nthe stillness in the cottage--more than all, at the laughter rising and\nfalling in the distance.\n\nSoon she sank down again, the strange medley of thought growing more and\nmore confused in her bewildered brain.\n\nWhat a strange lip the meester had! How the stork's nest upon the roof\nseemed to rustle and whisper down to her! How bright those knives were,\nin the leathern case--brighter perhaps than the silver skates. If she\nhad but worn her new jacket she would not shiver so. The new jacket was\npretty--the only pretty thing she had ever worn. God had taken care of\nher father so long, He would do it still, if those two men would but go\naway. Ah, now the meesters were on the roof, they were clambering to the\ntop--no--it was her mother and Hans,--or the storks--it was so dark who\ncould tell? and the mound rocking, swinging in that strange way. How\nsweetly the birds were singing. They must be winter birds, for the air\nwas thick with icicles--not one bird--but twenty. Oh! hear them,\nmother--wake me, mother, for the race--I am so tired with crying, and\ncrying----\n\nA firm hand was laid upon her shoulder.\n\n\"Get up, little girl!\" cried a kind voice. \"This will not do, for you to\nlie here and freeze.\"\n\nGretel slowly raised her head. She was so sleepy that it seemed nothing\nstrange to her that Hilda van Gleck should be leaning over her, looking\nwith kind, beautiful eyes into her face. She had often dreamed it\nbefore.\n\nBut she had never dreamed that Hilda was shaking her roughly, almost\ndragging her by main force--never dreamed that she heard her saying,\n\"Gretel! Gretel Brinker! you _must_ wake!\"\n\nThis was real. Gretel looked up. Still the lovely delicate young lady\nwas shaking, rubbing, fairly pounding her. It must be a dream. No, there\nwas the cottage--and the stork's nest, and the meester's coach by the\ncanal. She could see them now quite plainly. Her hands were tingling,\nher feet throbbing--Hilda was forcing her to walk.\n\nAt last Gretel began to feel like herself again.\n\n\"I have been asleep,\" she faltered, rubbing her eyes with both hands and\nlooking very much ashamed.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, entirely too much asleep,\" laughed Hilda, whose lips were\nvery pale, \"but you are well enough now--lean upon me, Gretel; there,\nkeep moving--you will soon be warm enough to go by the fire--now let me\ntake you into the cottage.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! no! no! jufvrouw, not in there! the meester is there. He sent\nme away!\"\n\nHilda was puzzled, but she wisely forbore to ask at present for an\nexplanation. \"Very well, Gretel--try to walk faster--I saw you upon the\nmound some time ago; but I thought you were playing--that is right--keep\nmoving.\"\n\nAll this time the kind-hearted girl had been forcing Gretel to walk up\nand down, supporting her with one arm, and, with the other, striving as\nwell as she could to take off her own warm sacque.\n\nSuddenly Gretel suspected her intention.\n\n\"Oh, jufvrouw! jufvrouw!\" she cried imploringly. \"_Please_ never think\nof such a thing as _that_--oh! please keep it on, I am burning all over,\njufvrouw! I really am burning--not burning exactly--but pins and needles\npricking all over me--oh! jufvrouw, don't.\"\n\nThe poor child's dismay was so genuine that Hilda hastened to reassure\nher.\n\n\"Very well, Gretel, move your arms then--so. Why, your cheeks are as\npink as roses, already. I think the meester would let you in now--he\ncertainly would--is your father so very ill?\"\n\n\"Ah, jufvrouw,\" cried Gretel, weeping afresh, \"he is dying, I think.\nThere are two meesters in with him at this moment, and the mother has\nscarce spoken to-day. Can you hear him moan, jufvrouw?\" she added, with\nsudden terror; \"the air buzzes so I cannot hear. He may be dead! oh, I\ndo wish I could hear him!\"\n\nHilda listened. The cottage was very near, but not a sound could be\nheard.\n\nSomething told her that Gretel was right. She ran to the window.\n\n\"You cannot see there, my lady,\" sobbed Gretel eagerly; \"the mother has\noiled paper hanging inside. But at the other one, in the south end of\nthe cottage, you can look in where the paper is torn.\"\n\nHilda in her anxiety ran round, past the corner where the low roof was\nfringed with its loosened thatch.\n\nA sudden thought checked her.\n\n\"It is not right for me to peep into another's house in this way,\" she\nsaid to herself--then softly calling to Gretel, she added, in a whisper,\n\"You may look--perhaps he is only sleeping.\"\n\nGretel tried to walk briskly toward the spot, but her limbs were\ntrembling. Hilda hastened to her support.\n\n\"You are sick, yourself, I fear,\" she said kindly.\n\n\"No, not sick, jufvrouw--but my heart cries all the time now, even when\nmy eyes are as dry as yours--why! Jufvrouw, your eyes are not dry! Are\nyou crying for _us_! Oh, jufvrouw--if God sees you! Oh! I know father\nwill get better now----\" and the little creature, even while reaching to\nlook through the tiny window, kissed Hilda's hand again and again.\n\nThe sash was sadly patched and broken, a torn piece of paper hung\nhalf-way down across it. Gretel's face was pressed to the window.\n\n\"Can you see anything?\" whispered Hilda at last.\n\n\"Yes--the father lies very still, his head is bandaged and all their\neyes are fastened upon him. Oh, jufvrouw!\" almost screamed Gretel, as\nshe started back, and by a quick, dexterous movement shook off her heavy\nwooden shoes, \"I _must_ go in to my mother! Will you come with me?\"\n\n\"Not now; the bell is ringing. I shall come again soon. Good-bye!\"\n\nGretel scarce heard the words. She remembered for many a day afterward\nthe bright, pitying smile on Hilda's face, as she turned away.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\nTHE AWAKENING\n\n\nAn angel could not have entered the cottage more noiselessly. Gretel,\nnot daring to look at any one, slid softly to her mother's side.\n\nThe room was very still. She could hear the old doctor breathe. She\ncould almost hear the sparks as they fell into the ashes on the hearth.\nThe mother's hand was very cold but a burning spot glowed on her cheek;\nand her eyes were like a deer's--so bright, so sad, so eager.\n\nAt last there was a movement upon the bed, very slight, but enough to\ncause them all to start; Dr. Boekman leaned eagerly forward.\n\nAnother movement. The large hand, so white and soft for a poor man's\nhand, twitched--then raised itself steadily toward the forehead.\n\nIt felt the bandage, not in a restless, crazy way, but with a\nquestioning movement, that caused even Dr. Boekman to hold his breath.\nThen the eyes opened slowly.\n\n\"Steady! steady!\" said a voice that sounded very strangely to Gretel.\n\"Shift that mat higher, boys! now throw on the clay. The waters are\nrising fast--no time to----\"\n\nDame Brinker sprang forward like a young panther.\n\nShe seized his hands, and leaning over him, cried, \"Raff! Raff, boy,\nspeak to me!\"\n\n\"Is it you, Meitje?\" he asked faintly--\"I have been asleep, hurt, I\nthink--where is little Hans?\"\n\n\"Here I am, father!\" shouted Hans half mad with joy. But the doctor held\nhim back.\n\n\"He knows us!\" screamed Dame Brinker. \"Great God! he knows us! Gretel!\nGretel! come, see your father!\"\n\nIn vain Dr. Boekman commanded \"silence!\" and tried to force them from\nthe bedside. He could not keep them off.\n\nHans and his mother laughed and cried together, as they hung over the\nnewly-awakened man. Gretel made no sound, but gazed at them all with\nglad, startled eyes. Her father was speaking in a faint voice.\n\n\"Is the baby asleep, Meitje?\"\n\n\"The baby!\" echoed Dame Brinker. \"Oh, Gretel! that is _you_! And he\ncalls Hans, 'little Hans.' Ten years asleep! Oh, mynheer, you have saved\nus all. He has known nothing for ten years! Children, why don't you\nthank the meester?\"\n\nThe good woman was beside herself with joy. Dr. Boekman said nothing;\nbut as his eye met hers, he pointed upward. She understood. So did Hans\nand Gretel.\n\nWith one accord they knelt by the cot, side by side. Dame Brinker felt\nfor her husband's hand even while she was praying. Dr. Boekman's head\nwas bowed; the assistant stood by the hearth with his back toward them.\n\n\"Why do you pray?\" murmured the father, looking feebly from the bed, as\nthey rose. \"Is it God's day?\"\n\nIt was not Sunday; but his vrouw bowed her head--she could not speak.\n\n[Illustration: _There was a movement upon the bed_]\n\n\"Then we should have a chapter,\" said Raff Brinker, speaking slowly, and\nwith difficulty. \"I do not know how it is. I am very, very weak. Mayhap\nthe minister will read to us.\"\n\nGretel lifted the big Dutch Bible from its carved shelf. Dr. Boekman,\nrather dismayed at being called a minister, coughed and handed the\nvolume to his assistant.\n\n\"Read,\" he muttered; \"these people must be kept quiet or the man will\ndie yet.\"\n\nWhen the chapter was finished, Dame Brinker motioned mysteriously to the\nrest by way of telling them that her husband was asleep.\n\n\"Now, jufvrouw,\" said the doctor in a subdued tone, as he drew on his\nthick woolen mittens, \"there must be perfect quiet. You understand. This\nis truly a most remarkable case. I shall come again to-morrow. Give the\npatient no food to-day,\" and, bowing hastily, he left the cottage,\nfollowed by his assistant.\n\nHis grand coach was not far away; the driver had kept the horses moving\nslowly up and down by the canal, nearly all the time the doctor had been\nin the cottage.\n\nHans went out also.\n\n\"May God bless you, mynheer!\" he said, blushing and trembling. \"I can\nnever repay you, but if----\"\n\n\"Yes, you can,\" interrupted the doctor, crossly. \"You can use your wits\nwhen the patient wakes again. This clacking and snivelling is enough to\nkill a well man, let alone one lying on the edge of his grave. If you\nwant your father to get well, keep 'em quiet.\"\n\nSo saying, Dr. Boekman, without another word, stalked off, to meet his\ncoach, leaving Hans standing there with eyes and mouth wide open.\n\nHilda was reprimanded severely that day for returning late to school\nafter recess, and for imperfect recitations.\n\nShe had remained near the cottage until she heard Dame Brinker laugh,\nuntil she had heard Hans say, \"Here I am, father!\" and then she had gone\nback to her lessons. What wonder that she missed them! How could she get\na long string of Latin verbs by heart, when her heart did not care a fig\nfor them, but would keep saying to itself, \"Oh, I am so glad! I am so\nglad!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\nBONES AND TONGUES\n\n\nBones are strange things. One would suppose that they knew nothing at\nall about school affairs, but they do. Even Jacob Poot's bones, buried\nas they were in flesh, were sharp in the matter of study hours.\n\nEarly on the morning of his return they ached through and through,\ngiving Jacob a twinge at every stroke of the school-bell--as if to say\n\"stop that clapper! There's trouble in it.\" After school, on the\ncontrary, they were quiet and comfortable; in fact, seemed to be taking\na nap among their cushions.\n\nThe other boys' bones behaved in a similar manner--but that is not so\nremarkable. Being nearer the daylight than Jacob's, they might be\nexpected to be more learned in the ways of the world. Master Ludwig's,\nespecially, were like beauty, only skin deep; they were the most knowing\nbones you ever heard of. Just put before him ever so quietly, a\nGrammar-book with a long lesson marked in it, and immediately the sly\nbone over his eyes would set up such an aching! Request him to go to the\ngarret for your foot-stove--instantly the bones would remind him that he\nwas \"too tired.\" Ask him to go to the confectioner's, a mile away, and\n_presto!_ not a bone would remember that it ever had been used before.\n\nBearing all this in mind you will not wonder when I tell you that our\nfive boys were among the happiest of the happy throng pouring forth from\nthe schoolhouse that day.\n\nPeter was in excellent spirits. He had heard through Hilda of Dame\nBrinker's laugh and of Hans' joyous words, and he needed no further\nproof that Raff Brinker was a cured man. In fact the news had gone forth\nin every direction, for miles around. Persons who had never before cared\nfor the Brinkers, or even mentioned them, except with a contemptuous\nsneer or a shrug of pretended pity, now became singularly familiar with\nevery point of their history. There was no end to the number of\nridiculous stories that were flying about.\n\nHilda, in the excitement of the moment, had stopped to exchange a word\nwith the doctor's coachman, as he stood by the horses, pommelling his\nchest and clapping his hands. Her kind heart was overflowing. She could\nnot help pausing to tell the cold, tired-looking man that she thought\nthe doctor would be out soon; she even hinted to him that she\nsuspected--only suspected--that a wonderful cure had been performed--an\nidiot brought to his senses. Nay, she was _sure_ of it--for she had\nheard his widow laugh--no, not his widow, of course, but his wife--for\nthe man was as much alive as anybody, and, for all she knew, sitting up\nand talking like a lawyer.\n\nAll this was very indiscreet. Hilda in an impenitent sort of way felt it\nto be so.\n\nBut it is always so delightful to impart pleasant or surprising news!\n\nShe went tripping along by the canal, quite resolved to repeat the sin,\n_ad infinitum_, and tell nearly every girl and boy in the school.\n\nMeantime, Janzoon Kolp came skating by. Of course, in two seconds, he\nwas striking slippery attitudes, and shouting saucy things to the\ncoachman, who stared at him in indolent disdain.\n\nThis, to Janzoon, was equivalent to an invitation to draw nearer. The\ncoachman was now upon his box gathering up the reins and grumbling at\nhis horses.\n\nJanzoon accosted him.\n\n\"I say. What's going on at the idiot's cottage? Is your boss in there?\"\n\nCoachman nodded mysteriously.\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled Janzoon, drawing closer. \"Old Brinker dead?\"\n\nThe driver grew big with importance, and silent in proportion.\n\n\"See here, old pincushion, I'd run home yonder and get you a chunk of\ngingerbread if I thought you could open your mouth.\"\n\nOld pincushion was human--long hours of waiting had made him ravenously\nhungry. At Janzoon's hint, his countenance showed signs of a collapse.\n\n\"That's right, old fellow,\" pursued his tempter, \"hurry up--what\nnews--old Brinker dead?\"\n\n\"No--CURED! got his wits,\" said the coachman, shooting forth his words,\none at a time, like so many bullets.\n\nLike bullets (figuratively speaking) they hit Janzoon Kolp. He jumped as\nif he had been shot.\n\n\"Goede Gunst! you don't say so!\"\n\nThe man pressed his lips together, and looked significantly toward\nMaster Kolp's shabby residence.\n\nJust then Janzoon saw a group of boys in the distance. Hailing them in a\nrowdy style, common to boys of his stamp all over the world, whether in\nAfrica, Japan, Amsterdam or Paris--he scampered toward them, forgetting\ncoachman, gingerbread, everything but the wonderful news.\n\nTherefore by sundown it was well known throughout the neighboring\ncountry that Dr. Boekman chancing to stop at the cottage had given the\nidiot Brinker a tremendous dose of medicine, as brown as gingerbread. It\nhad taken six men to hold him while it was poured down. The idiot had\nimmediately sprung to his feet, in full possession of all his\nfaculties--knocked over the doctor, or thrashed him (there was admitted\nto be a slight uncertainty as to which of these penalties was\ninflicted), then sat down and addressed him for all the world like a\nlawyer. After that he had turned and spoken beautifully to his wife and\nchildren. Dame Brinker had laughed herself into violent hysterics. Hans\nhad said, \"Here I am, father! your own dear son,\" and Gretel had said,\n\"Here I am, father, your own dear Gretel!\" and the doctor had afterward\nbeen seen leaning back in his carriage looking just as white as a\ncorpse.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\nA NEW ALARM\n\n\nWhen Dr. Boekman called the next day at the Brinker cottage, he could\nnot help noticing the cheerful, comfortable aspect of the place. An\natmosphere of happiness breathed upon him as he opened the door. Dame\nBrinker sat complacently knitting beside the bed, her husband was\nenjoying a tranquil slumber, and Gretel was noiselessly kneading rye\nbread on the table in the corner.\n\nThe doctor did not remain long. He asked a few simple questions,\nappeared satisfied with the answers, and after feeling his patient's\npulse, said--\"Ah, very weak yet, jufvrouw; very weak, indeed. He must\nhave nourishment. You may begin to feed the patient, ahem! not too much,\nbut what you do give him let it be strong and of the best.\"\n\n\"Black bread we have, mynheer, and porridge,\" replied Dame Brinker,\ncheerily; \"they have always agreed with him well.\"\n\n\"Tut! tut!\" said the doctor frowning, \"nothing of the kind. He must have\nthe juice of fresh meat, white bread, dried and toasted, good Malaga\nwine, and--ahem! The man looks cold--give him more covering, something\nlight and warm. Where is the boy?\"\n\n\"Hans, mynheer, has gone into Broek to look for work. He will be back\nsoon. Will the meester please be seated?\"\n\nWhether the hard polished stool offered by Dame Brinker did not look\nparticularly tempting, or whether the dame herself frightened him,\npartly because she was a woman, and partly because an anxious,\ndistressed look had suddenly appeared in her face, I cannot say. Certain\nit is that our eccentric doctor looked hurriedly about him, muttered\nsomething about \"extraordinary case,\" bowed, and disappeared, before\nDame Brinker had time to say another word.\n\nStrange that the visit of their good benefactor should have left a\ncloud, yet so it was. Gretel frowned, an anxious childish frown, and\nkneaded the bread-dough violently, without looking up. Dame Brinker\nhurried to her husband's bedside, leaned over him, and fell into silent\nbut passionate weeping.\n\nIn a moment Hans entered.\n\n\"Why, mother,\" he whispered in alarm, \"what ails thee? Is the father\nworse?\"\n\nShe turned her quivering face toward him, making no attempt to conceal\nher distress.\n\n\"Yes. He is starving--perishing. The meester said it.\"\n\nHans turned pale.\n\n\"What does this mean, mother? We must feed him at once. Here, Gretel,\ngive me the porridge.\"\n\n\"Nay!\" cried his mother, distractedly, yet without raising her voice,\n\"it may kill him. Our poor fare is too heavy for him. Oh, Hans, he will\ndie--the father will _die_ if we use him this way. He must have meat,\nand sweet wine, and a dek-bed. Oh, what shall I do? what shall I do?\"\nshe sobbed, wringing her hands. \"There is not a stiver in the house.\"\n\nGretel pouted; it was the only way she could express sympathy just then;\nher tears fell one by one into the dough.\n\n\"Did the meester say he _must_ have these things, mother?\" asked Hans.\n\n\"Yes, he did.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, don't cry, _he shall have them_; I shall bring meat and\nwine before night. Take the cover from my bed. I can sleep in the\nstraw.\"\n\n\"Yes, Hans; but it is heavy, scant as it is. The meester said he must\nhave something light and warm. He will perish. Our peat is giving out,\nHans. The father has wasted it sorely, throwing it on when I was not\nlooking, dear man.\"\n\n\"Never mind, mother,\" whispered Hans, cheerfully. \"We can cut down the\nwillow tree and burn it, if need be; but I'll bring home something\nto-night. There _must_ be work in Amsterdam, though there's none in\nBroek. Never fear, mother; the worst trouble of all is past. We can\nbrave anything now that the father is himself again.\"\n\n\"Aye!\" sobbed Dame Brinker, hastily drying her eyes, \"that is true\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. Look at him, mother, how softly he sleeps. Do you\nthink God would let him starve, just after giving him back to us. Why,\nmother, I'm as _sure_ of getting all the father needs, as if my pocket\nwas bursting with gold. There, now, don't fret.\" And hurriedly kissing\nher, Hans caught up his skates and slipped from the cottage.\n\nPoor Hans! Disappointed in his morning's errand, half sickened with this\nnew trouble, he wore a brave look, and tried to whistle as he tramped\nresolutely off with the firm intention of mending matters.\n\nWant had never before pressed as sorely upon the Brinker family. Their\nstock of peat was nearly exhausted, and all the flour in the cottage\nwas in Gretel's dough. They had scarcely cared to eat during the past\nfew days--scarcely realized their condition. Dame Brinker had felt so\nsure that she and the children could earn money before the worst came,\nthat she had given herself up to the joy of her husband's recovery. She\nhad not even told Hans that the few pieces of silver in the old mitten\nwere quite gone.\n\nHans reproached himself, now, that he had not hailed the doctor when he\nsaw him enter his coach and drive rapidly away in the direction of\nAmsterdam.\n\n\"Perhaps there is some mistake,\" he thought. \"The meester surely would\nhave known that meat and sweet wine were not at our command; and yet the\nfather looks very weak--he certainly does. I _must_ get work. If Mynheer\nvan Holp were back from Rotterdam I could get plenty to do. But Master\nPeter told me to let him know if he could do aught to serve us. I shall\ngo to him at once. Oh, if it were but summer!\"\n\nAll this time Hans was hastening toward the canal. Soon his skates were\non, and he was skimming rapidly toward the residence of Mynheer van\nHolp.\n\n\"The father must have meat and wine at once,\" he muttered, \"but how can\nI earn the money in time to buy them to-day? There is no other way but\nto go, as I _promised_, to Master Peter. What would a gift of meat and\nwine be to him? When the father is once fed, I can rush down to\nAmsterdam and earn the morrow's supply.\"\n\nThen came other thoughts--thoughts that made his heart thump heavily and\nhis cheeks burn with a new shame--\"It is _begging_, to say the least.\nNot one of the Brinkers has ever been a beggar. Shall I be the first?\nShall my poor father just coming back into life learn that his family\nhave asked for charity--he, always so wise and thrifty? No,\" cried Hans\naloud, \"better a thousand times to part with the watch.\n\n\"I can at least borrow money on it, in Amsterdam!\" he thought, turning\naround. \"That will be no disgrace. I can find work at once, and get it\nback again. Nay, perhaps I can even _speak to the father about it_!\"\n\nThis last thought almost made the lad dance for joy. Why not, indeed,\nspeak to the father? He was a rational being now. \"He may wake,\" thought\nHans, \"quite bright and rested--may tell us the watch is of no\nconsequence, to sell it of course! Hoezza!\" and Hans almost flew over\nthe ice.\n\nA few moments more and the skates were again swinging from his arm. He\nwas running toward the cottage.\n\nHis mother met him at the door.\n\n\"Oh, Hans!\" she cried, her face radiant with joy, \"the young lady has\nbeen here with her maid. She brought everything--meat, jelly, wine and\nbread--a whole basketful! Then the meester sent a man from town with\nmore wine, and a fine bed and blankets for the father. Oh! he will get\nwell now. God bless them!\"\n\n\"God bless them!\" echoed Hans, and for the first time that day, his eyes\nfilled with tears.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\nTHE FATHER'S RETURN\n\n\nThat evening Raff Brinker felt so much better that he insisted upon\nsitting up a while on the rough, high-backed chair by the fire. For a\nfew moments there was quite a commotion in the little cottage. Hans was\nall-important on the occasion, for his father was a heavy man, and\nneeded something firm to lean upon. The dame, though none of your\nfragile ladies, was in such a state of alarm and excitement at the bold\nstep they were taking in lifting him without the meester's orders, that\nshe came near pulling her husband over, even while she believed herself\nto be his main prop and support.\n\n\"Steady, vrouw, steady,\" panted Raff; \"have I grown old and feeble, or\nis it the fever makes me thus helpless?\"\n\n\"Hear the man!\" laughed Dame Brinker, \"talking like any other Christian.\nWhy, you're only weak from the fever, Raff. Here's the chair, all fixed\nsnug and warm; now, sit thee down--hi-di-didy--there we are!\"\n\nWith these words, Dame Brinker let her half of the burden settle slowly\ninto the chair. Hans prudently did the same.\n\nMeanwhile Gretel flew about generally, bringing every possible thing to\nher mother to tuck behind the father's back and spread over his knees.\nThen she twitched the carved bench under his feet, and Hans kicked the\nfire to make it brighter.\n\nThe father was \"sitting up\" at last. What wonder that he looked about\nhim like one bewildered. \"Little Hans\" had just been almost carrying\nhim. \"The baby\" was over four feet long, and was demurely brushing up\nthe hearth with a bundle of willow wisps. Meitje, the vrouw, winsome and\nfair as ever, had gained at least fifty pounds in what seemed to him a\nfew hours. She also had some new lines in her face that puzzled him. The\nonly familiar things in the room were the pine table that he had made\nbefore he was married, the Bible upon the shelf, and the cupboard in the\ncorner.\n\nAh! Raff Brinker, it was only natural that your eyes should fill with\nhot tears even while looking at the joyful faces of your loved ones. Ten\nyears dropped from a man's life are no small loss; ten years of manhood,\nof household happiness and care; ten years of honest labor, of conscious\nenjoyment of sunshine and outdoor beauty, ten years of grateful\nlife--One day looking forward to all this; the next, waking to find them\npassed, and a blank. What wonder the scalding tears dropped one by one\nupon your cheek!\n\nTender little Gretel! The prayer of her life was answered through those\ntears. She _loved_ her father from that moment. Hans and his mother\nglanced silently at each other when they saw her spring toward him and\nthrow her arms about his neck.\n\n\"Father, _dear_ father,\" she whispered, pressing her cheek close to his,\n\"don't cry. We are all here.\"\n\n\"God bless thee,\" sobbed Raff, kissing her again and again. \"I had\nforgotten that!\"\n\nSoon he looked up again, and spoke in a cheerful voice: \"I should know\nher, vrouw,\" he said, holding the sweet young face between his hands,\nand gazing at it as though he were watching it grow. \"I should know\nher. The same blue eyes, and the lips, and, ah! me, the little song she\ncould sing almost before she could stand. But that was long ago,\" he\nadded, with a sigh, still looking at her dreamily, \"long ago; it's all\ngone now.\"\n\n\"Not so, indeed,\" cried Dame Brinker, eagerly. \"Do you think I would let\nher forget it? Gretel, child, sing the old song thou hast known so\nlong!\"\n\nRaff Brinker's hands fell wearily and his eyes closed, but it was\nsomething to see the smile playing about his mouth, as Gretel's voice\nfloated about him like an incense.\n\nIt was a simple air; she had never known the words.\n\nWith loving instinct she softened every note, until Raff almost fancied\nthat his two-year-old baby was once more beside him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as the song was finished, Hans mounted a wooden stool and began\nto rummage in the cupboard.\n\n\"Have a care, Hans,\" said Dame Brinker, who through all her poverty was\never a tidy housewife. \"Have a care, the wine is there at your right,\nand the white bread beyond it.\"\n\n\"Never fear, mother,\" answered Hans, reaching far back on an upper\nshelf, \"I shall do no mischief.\"\n\nJumping down, he walked toward his father, and placed an oblong block of\npine-wood in his hands. One of its ends was rounded off, and some deep\ncuts had been made on the top.\n\n\"Do you know what it is, father?\" asked Hans.\n\nRaff Brinker's face brightened. \"Indeed I do, boy; it is the boat I was\nmaking you yest--alack, not yesterday, but years ago.\"\n\n\"I have kept it ever since, father; it can be finished when your hand\ngrows strong again.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not for you, my lad. I must wait for the grandchildren. Why,\nyou are nearly a man. Have you helped your mother, boy, through all\nthese years?\"\n\n\"Aye, and bravely,\" put in Dame Brinker.\n\n\"Let me see,\" muttered the father, looking in a puzzled way at them all,\n\"how long is it since the night when the waters were coming in? 'Tis the\nlast I remember.\"\n\n\"We have told thee true, Raff. It was ten years last Pinxter-week.\"\n\n\"Ten years--and I fell then, you say. Has the fever been on me ever\nsince?\"\n\nDame Brinker scarce knew how to reply. Should she tell him all? Tell him\nthat he had been an idiot, almost a lunatic? The doctor had charged her\non no account to worry or excite his patient.\n\nHans and Gretel looked astonished when the answer came.\n\n\"Like enough, Raff,\" she said, nodding her head, and raising her\neyebrows, \"when a heavy man like thee falls on his head, it's hard to\nsay what will come--but thou'rt well _now_, Raff. Thank the good Lord!\"\n\nThe newly-awakened man bowed his head.\n\n\"Aye, well enough, mine vrouw,\" he said, after a moment's silence, \"but\nmy brain turns somehow like a spinning-wheel. It will not be right till\nI get on the dykes again. When shall I be at work, think you?\"\n\n\"Hear the man!\" cried Dame Brinker delighted, yet frightened, too, for\nthat matter; \"we must get him on the bed, Hans. Work, indeed!\"\n\nThey tried to raise him from the chair--but he was not ready yet.\n\n\"Be off with ye!\" he said, with something like his old smile (Gretel had\nnever seen it before); \"does a man want to be lifted about like a log? I\ntell you before three suns I shall be on the dykes again. Ah! there'll\nbe some stout fellows to greet me. Jan Kamphuisen and young Hoogsvliet.\nThey have been good friends to thee, Hans, I'll warrant.\"\n\nHans looked at his mother. Young Hoogsvliet had been dead five years.\nJan Kamphuisen was in the jail at Amsterdam.\n\n\"Aye, they'd have done their share no doubt,\" said Dame Brinker,\nparrying the inquiry, \"had we asked them. But what with working and\nstudying, Hans has been busy enough without seeking comrades.\"\n\n\"Working and studying,\" echoed Raff, in a musing tone; \"can the\nyoungsters read and cipher, Meitje?\"\n\n\"You should hear them!\" she answered proudly. \"They can run through a\nbook while I mop the floor. Hans there is as happy over a page of big\nwords as a rabbit in a cabbage patch--as for ciphering----\"\n\n\"Here, lad, help a bit,\" interrupted Raff Brinker. \"I must get me on the\nbed again.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\nTHE THOUSAND GUILDERS\n\n\nNone seeing the humble supper eaten in the Brinker cottage that night\nwould have dreamed of the dainty fare hidden away near by. Hans and\nGretel looked rather wistfully toward the cupboard as they drank their\ncupful of water and ate their scanty share of black bread; but even in\nthought they did not rob their father.\n\n\"He relished his supper well,\" said Dame Brinker nodding sidewise toward\nthe bed, \"and fell asleep the next moment--Ah, the dear man will be\nfeeble for many a day. He wanted sore to sit up again, but while I made\nshow of humoring him, and getting ready, he dropped off. Remember that,\nmy girl, when you have a man of your own (and many a day may it be\nbefore that comes to pass), remember you can never rule by differing;\n'humble wife is husband's boss----' Tut! tut! never swallow such a\nmouthful as that again, child; why, I could make a meal off of two such\npieces. What's in thee, Hans? One would think there were cob-webs on the\nwall.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, mother, I was only thinking----\"\n\n\"Thinking, about what? Ah, no use asking,\" she added in a changed tone.\n\"I was thinking of the same a while ago--well, well--It's no blame if we\n_did_ look to hear something by this time about the thousand guilders;\nbut, not a word--no--it's plain enough he knows naught about them.\"\n\nHans looked up anxiously, dreading lest his mother should grow\nagitated, as usual, when speaking of the lost money; but she was\nsilently nibbling her bread and looking with a doleful stare toward the\nwindow.\n\n\"Thousand guilders,\" echoed a faint voice from the bed. \"Ah, I am sure\nthey have been of good use to you, vrouw, through the long years while\nyour man was idle.\"\n\nThe poor woman started up. These words quite destroyed the hope that of\nlate had been glowing within her.\n\n\"Are you awake, Raff?\" she faltered.\n\n\"Yes, Meitje, and I feel much better. Our money was well saved, vrouw, I\nwas saying. Did it last through all these ten years?\"\n\n\"I--I--have not got it, Raff, I----\" She was going to tell him the whole\ntruth, when Hans lifted his finger warningly and whispered:\n\n\"Remember what the meester told us; the father must not be worried.\"\n\n\"Speak to him, child,\" she answered, trembling.\n\nHans hurried to the bedside.\n\n\"I am glad you are feeling better,\" he said, leaning over his father;\n\"another day will see you quite strong again.\"\n\n\"Aye, like enough. How long did the money last, Hans? I could not hear\nyour mother. What did she say?\"\n\n\"I said, Raff,\" stammered Dame Brinker in great distress, \"that it was\nall gone.\"\n\n\"Well, well, wife, do not fret at that; one thousand guilders is not so\nvery much for ten years, and with children to bring up; but it has\nhelped to make you all comfortable. Have you had much sickness to\nbear?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" sobbed Dame Brinker lifting her apron to her eyes.\n\n\"Tut--tut, woman, why do you cry?\" said Raff, kindly; \"we will soon fill\nanother pouch, when I am on my feet again. Lucky I told you all about it\nbefore I fell.\"\n\n\"Told me what, man?\"\n\n\"Why, that I buried the money. In my dream just now, it seemed I had\nnever said aught about it.\"\n\nDame Brinker started forward. Hans caught her arm.\n\n\"Hist! mother,\" he whispered, hastily leading her away, \"we must be very\ncareful.\" Then while she stood with clasped hands waiting in breathless\nanxiety, he once more approached the cot. Trembling with eagerness he\nsaid:\n\n\"That was a troublesome dream. Do you remember _when_ you buried the\nmoney, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy. It was before daylight on the same day I was hurt. Jan\nKamphuisen said something, the sundown before, that made me distrust his\nhonesty. He was the only one living besides mother who knew we had saved\na thousand guilders--so I rose up that night and buried the\nmoney--blockhead that I was ever to suspect an old friend!\"\n\n\"I'll be bound, father,\" pursued Hans in a laughing voice, motioning to\nhis mother and Gretel to remain quiet--\"that you've forgotten where you\nburied it.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! not I, indeed--but good-night, my son, I can sleep again.\"\n\nHans would have walked away, but his mother's gestures were not to be\ndisobeyed--so he said gently:\n\n\"Good-night, father. Where did you say you buried the money? I was only\na little one then.\"\n\n\"Close by the willow sapling behind the cottage,\" said Raff Brinker\ndrowsily.\n\n\"Ah, yes. North side of the tree, wasn't it, father?\"\n\n\"No, the south side. Ah, you know the spot well enough, you rogue--like\nenough you were there when your mother lifted it. Now, son--easy--shift\nthis pillow--so. Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, father!\" said Hans, ready to dance for joy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe moon rose very late that night, shining in, full and clear, at the\nlittle window; but its beams did not disturb Raff Brinker. He slept\nsoundly, so did Gretel. As for Hans and his mother, they had something\nelse to do.\n\nAfter making a few hurried preparations, they stole forth with bright\nexpectant faces, bearing a broken spade and a rusty implement that had\ndone many a day's service when Raff was a hale worker on the dykes.\n\nIt was so light out of doors they could see the willow tree distinctly.\nThe frozen ground was hard as stone, but Hans and his mother were\nresolute. Their only dread was that they might disturb the sleepers in\nthe cottage.\n\n\"This ysbrekker is just the thing, mother,\" said Hans striking many a\nvigorous blow--\"but the ground has set so firm it'll be a fair match for\nit.\"\n\n\"Never fear, Hans,\" she answered, watching him eagerly; \"here, let me\ntry a while.\"\n\nThey soon succeeded in making an impression; one opening, and the rest\nwas not so difficult.\n\nStill they worked on, taking turns and whispering cheerily to one\nanother. Now and then Dame Brinker stepped noiselessly over the\nthreshold and listened, to be certain that her husband slept.\n\n\"What grand news it will be for him,\" she said, laughing, \"when he is\nstrong enough to bear it. How I should like to put the pouch and the\nstocking, just as we find them, all full of money, near him this blessed\nnight, for the dear man to see when he wakens.\"\n\n\"We must get them, first, mother,\" panted Hans, still tugging away at\nhis work.\n\n\"There's no doubt of that. They can't slip away from us now,\" she\nanswered, shivering with cold and excitement, as she crouched beside the\nopening. \"Like enough we'll find them stowed in the old earthen pot I\nlost long ago.\"\n\nBy this time Hans, too, began to tremble, but not with cold. He had\npenetrated a foot deep for quite a space on the south side of the tree.\nAt any moment they might come upon the treasure.\n\nMeantime the stars winked and blinked at each other as if to say, \"Queer\ncountry, this Holland! How much we do see to be sure!\"\n\n\"Strange that the dear father should have put it down so woeful deep,\"\nsaid Dame Brinker, in rather a provoked tone. \"Ah, the ground was soft\nenough then, I warrant. How wise of him to mistrust Jan Kamphuisen, and\nJan in full credit at the time. Little I thought that handsome fellow\nwith his gay ways would ever go to jail! Now, Hans, let me take a\nturn--it's lighter work, d'ye see? the deeper we go. I'd be loath to\nkill the tree, Hans--will we harm it, think you?\"\n\n\"I cannot say,\" he answered, gravely.\n\nHour after hour, mother and son worked on. The hole grew larger and\ndeeper. Clouds began to gather in the sky, throwing elfish shadows as\nthey passed. Not until moon and stars faded away and streaks of daylight\nbegan to appear, did Meitje Brinker and Hans look hopelessly into each\nother's face.\n\nThey had searched thoroughly, desperately, all round the tree; south,\nnorth, east, west. _The hidden money was not there!_\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\nGLIMPSES\n\n\nAnnie Bouman had a healthy distaste for Janzoon Kolp. Janzoon Kolp, in\nhis own rough way, adored Annie. Annie declared she could not \"to save\nher life\" say one civil word to that odious boy. Janzoon believed her to\nbe the sweetest, sauciest creature in the world. Annie laughed among her\nplaymates at the comical flapping of Janzoon's tattered and dingy\njacket; he sighed in solitude over the floating grace of her jaunty blue\npetticoat. She thanked her stars that her brothers were not like the\nKolps; and he growled at his sister because she was not like the\nBoumans. They seemed to exchange natures whenever they met. His presence\nmade her harsh and unfeeling; and the very sight of _her_ made him\ngentle as a lamb. Of course they were thrown together very often. It is\nthus that in some mysterious way we are convinced of error and cured of\nprejudice. In this case, however, the scheme failed. Annie detested\nJanzoon more and more at each encounter; and Janzoon liked her better\nand better every day.\n\n\"He killed a stork, the wicked old wretch!\" she would say to herself.\n\n\"She knows I am strong and fearless,\" thought Janzoon.\n\n\"How red and freckled and ugly he is!\" was Annie's secret comment when\nshe looked at him.\n\n\"How she stares, and stares!\" thought Janzoon. \"Well, I am a fine,\nweather-beaten fellow, anyway.\"\n\n\"Janzoon Kolp, you impudent boy, go right away from me!\" Annie often\nsaid. \"I don't want any of your company.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Janzoon to himself, \"girls never say what they mean.\nI'll skate with her every chance I can get.\"\n\nAnd so it came to pass that the pretty maid would not look up that\nmorning when, skating homeward from Amsterdam, she became convinced that\na great burly boy was coming down the canal, toward her.\n\n\"Humph! if I look at him,\" thought Annie, \"I'll----\"\n\n\"Good-morrow, Annie Bouman,\" said a pleasant voice.\n\n[How a smile brightens a girl's face!]\n\n\"Good-morrow, Master Hans, I am right glad to meet you.\"\n\n[How a smile brightens a boy's face!]\n\n\"Good-morrow again, Annie. There has been a great change at our house\nsince you left.\"\n\n\"How so?\" she exclaimed, opening her eyes very wide.\n\nHans, who had been in a great hurry, and rather moody, grew talkative\nand quite at leisure in Annie's sunshine.\n\nTurning about, and skating slowly with her toward Broek, he told the\ngood news of his father. Annie was so true a friend that he told her\neven of their present distress, of how money was needed, and how\neverything depended upon his obtaining work, and he could find nothing\nto do in the neighborhood.\n\nAll this was not said as a complaint, but just because she was looking\nat him, and really wished to know. He could not speak of last night's\nbitter disappointment, for that secret was not wholly his own.\n\n\"Good-bye, Annie!\" he said at last. \"The morning is going fast, and I\nmust haste to Amsterdam and sell these skates. Mother must have money at\nonce. Before nightfall I shall certainly find a job somewhere.\"\n\n\"Sell your new skates, Hans!\" cried Annie; \"you, the best skater around\nBroek! Why, the race is coming off in five days!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" he answered resolutely. \"Good-bye! I shall skate home again\non the old wooden ones.\"\n\nSuch a bright glance! So different from Janzoon's ugly grin--and Hans\nwas off like an arrow.\n\n\"Hans! come back,\" she called.\n\nHer voice changed the arrow into a top. Spinning around, he darted, in\none long, leaning sweep, toward her.\n\n\"Then you really are going to sell your new skates if you can find a\ncustomer.\"\n\n\"Of course I am,\" he replied looking up with a surprised smile.\n\n\"Well, Hans, if you _are_ going to sell your skates,\" said Annie,\nsomewhat confused, \"I mean if you----Well, I know somebody who would\nlike to buy them--that's all.\"\n\n\"Not Janzoon Kolp?\" asked Hans, flushing.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she pouted, \"he is not one of my friends.\"\n\n\"But you _know_ him,\" persisted Hans.\n\nAnnie laughed. \"Yes, I know him, and it's all the worse for him that I\ndo. Now please, Hans, don't ever talk any more to me about Janzoon. I\nhate him!\"\n\n\"Hate him! _you_ hate any one, Annie?\"\n\nShe shook her head saucily. \"Yes; and I'll hate you too, if you persist\nin calling him one of my friends. You boys may like him because he\ncaught the greased goose at the Kermis last summer, and climbed the pole\nwith his great, ugly body tied up in a sack, but I don't care for such\nthings. I've disliked him ever since I saw him try to push his little\nsister out of the merry-go-round at Amsterdam; and it's no secret up\n_our_ way who killed the stork on your mother's roof. But we mustn't\ntalk about such a bad, wicked fellow. Really, Hans, I know somebody who\nwould be glad to buy your skates. You won't get half a price for them in\nAmsterdam. _Please_ give them to me. I'll take you the money this very\nafternoon.\"\n\nIf Annie was charming even when she said \"hate,\" there was no\nwithstanding her when she said \"please\"; at least Hans found it to be\nso.\n\n\"Annie,\" he said, taking off the skates, and rubbing them carefully with\na snarl of twine before handing them to her, \"I am sorry to be so\nparticular; but if your friend should not want them, will you bring them\nback to me to-day? I must buy peat and meal for the mother early\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"My friend _will_ want them,\" laughed Annie, nodding gaily, and skating\noff at the top of her speed.\n\nAs Hans drew forth the wooden \"runners\" from his capacious pockets and\nfastened them on as best he could, he did not hear Annie murmur, \"I wish\nI had not been so rude; poor, brave Hans; what a noble boy he is!\" And\nas Annie skated homeward filled with pleasant thoughts, she did not hear\nHans say, \"I grumbled like a bear--but bless her! some girls are like\nangels!\"\n\nPerhaps it was all for the best. One cannot be expected to know\neverything that is going on in the world.\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\nLOOKING FOR WORK\n\n\nLuxuries unfit us for returning to hardships easily endured before. The\nwooden runners squeaked more than ever. It was as much as Hans could do\nto get on with the clumsy old things; still he did not regret that he\nhad parted with his beautiful skates--but resolutely pushed back the\nboyish trouble that he had not been able to keep them just a little\nlonger, at least until after the race.\n\n\"Mother surely will not be angry with me,\" he thought, \"for selling them\nwithout her leave. She has had care enough already. It will be full time\nto speak of it when I take home the money.\"\n\nHans went up and down the streets of Amsterdam that day, looking for\nwork. He succeeded in earning a few stivers by assisting a man who was\ndriving a train of loaded mules into the city, but he could not secure\nsteady employment anywhere. He would have been glad to obtain a\nsituation as porter or errand-boy, but though he passed, on his way,\nmany a loitering, shuffling urchin, laden with bundles, there was no\nplace for him. Some shopkeepers had just supplied themselves; others\nneeded a trimmer, more lightly-built fellow (they meant better dressed,\nbut did not choose to say so); others told him to call again in a month\nor two, when the canals would probably be broken up; and many shook\ntheir heads at him without saying a word.\n\nAt the factories he met with no better luck. It seemed to him that in\nthose great buildings, turning out respectively such tremendous\nquantities of woolen, cotton and linen stuffs, such world-renowned dyes\nand paints, such precious diamonds cut from the rough, such supplies of\nmeal, of bricks, of glass and china--that in at least one of these, a\nstrong-armed boy, able and eager to work, could find something to do.\nBut no--nearly the same answer met him everywhere, \"no need of more\nhands just now. If he had called before Nicholas' day they might have\ngiven him a job, as they were hurried then; but at present they had more\nboys than they needed.\" Hans wished they could see, just for a moment,\nhis mother and Gretel. He did not know how the anxiety of both looked\nout from his eyes, and how more than once, the gruffest denials were\nuttered with an uncomfortable consciousness that the lad ought not to be\nturned away. Certain fathers, when they went home that night, spoke more\nkindly than usual to their own youngsters, from memory of a frank, young\nface saddened at their words; and before morning one man actually\nresolved that if the Broek boy came in again he would instruct his head\nman Blankert to set him at something.\n\nBut Hans knew nothing of all this. Toward sundown he started on his\nreturn to Broek, uncertain whether the strange, choking sensation in his\nthroat arose from discouragement or resolution. There was certainly one\nmore chance. Mynheer van Holp might have returned by this time. Master\nPeter it was reported had gone to Haarlem the night before, to attend to\nsomething connected with the great Skating Race. Still Hans would go and\ntry.\n\nFortunately, Peter had returned early that morning. He was at home when\nHans reached there, and was just about starting for the Brinker cottage.\n\n\"Ah, Hans!\" he cried as the weary boy approached the door. \"You are the\nvery one I wished to see. Come in and warm yourself.\"\n\nAfter tugging at his well-worn hat, which always _would_ stick to his\nhead when he was embarrassed, Hans knelt down--not by way of making a\nnew style of oriental salute--nor to worship the goddess of cleanliness\nwho presided there--but because his heavy shoes would have filled the\nsoul of a Broek housewife with horror. When their owner stepped softly\ninto the house, they were left outside to act as sentinels until his\nreturn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHans left the Van Holp mansion with a lightened heart. Peter had brought\nword from Haarlem that young Brinker was to commence working upon the\nsummer-house doors immediately. There was a comfortable workshop on the\nplace and it was to be at his service until the carving was done.\n\nPeter did not tell Hans that he had skated all the way to Haarlem for\nthe purpose of arranging this plan with Mynheer van Holp. It was enough\nfor him to see the glad, eager look rise on young Brinker's face.\n\n\"I _think_ I can do it,\" said Hans, \"though I have never learned the\ntrade.\"\n\n\"I am _sure_ you can,\" responded Peter, heartily. \"You will find every\ntool you require in the workshop. It is nearly hidden yonder by that\nwall of twigs. In summer when the hedge is green, one cannot see the\nshop from here at all. How is your father to-day?\"\n\n\"Better, mynheer--he improves every hour.\"\n\n\"It is the most astonishing thing I ever heard of. That gruff old doctor\nis a great fellow after all.\"\n\n\"Ah! mynheer,\" said Hans, warmly, \"he is more than great. He is good.\nBut for the meester's kind heart and great skill my poor father would\nyet be in the dark. I think, mynheer,\" he added, with kindling eyes,\n\"surgery is the very noblest science in the world!\"\n\nPeter shrugged his shoulders. \"Very noble it may be, but not quite to my\ntaste. This Dr. Boekman certainly has skill. As for his heart--defend me\nfrom such hearts as his!\"\n\n\"Why do you say so, mynheer?\" asked Hans.\n\nJust then a lady slowly entered from an adjoining apartment. It was\nMevrouw van Holp arrayed in the grandest of caps, and the longest of\nsatin aprons ruffled with lace. She nodded placidly as Hans stepped back\nfrom the fire bowing as well as he knew how.\n\nPeter at once drew a high-backed oaken chair toward the fire, and the\nlady seated herself. There was a block of cork on each side of the\nchimney-place. One of these he placed under his mother's feet.\n\nHans turned to go.\n\n\"Wait a moment, if you please, young man,\" said the lady. \"I\naccidentally overheard you and my son speaking I think of my friend Dr.\nBoekman. You are right, young man. Dr. Boekman has a very kind heart.\nYou perceive, Peter, we may be quite mistaken in judging of a person\nsolely by their manners, though a courteous deportment is by no means to\nbe despised.\"\n\n\"I intended no disrespect, mother,\" said Peter, \"but surely one has no\nright to go growling and snarling through the world, as they say he\ndoes.\"\n\n\"They say. Ah, Peter, 'they' means everybody or nobody. Surgeon Boekman\nhas had a great sorrow. Many years ago he lost his only child, under\nvery painful circumstances, a fine lad, except that he was a thought too\nhasty and high spirited. Before then Gerard Boekman was one of the most\nagreeable gentlemen I ever knew.\"\n\nSo saying, Mevrouw van Holp, looking kindly upon the two boys, arose and\nleft the room with the same dignity with which she had entered.\n\nPeter, only half convinced, muttered something about \"the sin of\nallowing sorrow to turn all one's honey into gall,\" as he conducted his\nvisitor to the narrow side-door. Before they parted, he advised Hans to\nkeep himself in good skating order, \"for,\" he added, \"now that your\nfather is all right, you will be in fine spirits for the race. That will\nbe the prettiest skating show ever seen in this part of the world.\nEverybody is talking of it; you are to try for the prize, remember.\"\n\n\"I shall not be in the race, mynheer,\" said Hans, looking down.\n\n\"Not be in the race! Why not indeed?\" and immediately Peter's thoughts\nswept on a full tide of suspicion toward Carl Schummel.\n\n\"Because I cannot, mynheer,\" answered Hans, as he bent to slip his feet\ninto his big shoes.\n\nSomething in the boy's manner warned Peter that it would be no kindness\nto press the matter further. He bade Hans \"good-bye,\" and stood\nthoughtfully watching him as he walked away.\n\nIn a minute Peter called out:\n\n\"Hans Brinker!\"\n\n\"Yes, mynheer.\"\n\n\"I'll take back all I said about Dr. Boekman.\"\n\n\"Yes, mynheer.\"\n\nBoth were laughing. But Peter's smile changed to a look of puzzled\nsurprise when he saw Hans kneel down by the canal and put on the wooden\nskates.\n\n\"Very queer,\" muttered Peter shaking his head as he turned to go into\nthe house; \"why in the world don't the boy wear his new ones?\"\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\nTHE FAIRY GODMOTHER\n\n\nThe sun had gone down quite out of sight when our hero--with a happy\nheart but with something like a sneer on his countenance, as he jerked\noff the wooden \"runners\"--trudged hopefully toward the tiny hut-like\nbuilding, known of old as the Idiot's cottage.\n\nDuller eyes than his would have discerned two slight figures moving near\nthe doorway.\n\nThat gray, well-patched jacket and the dull blue skirt covered with an\napron of still duller blue, that faded, close-fitting cap, and those\nquick little feet in their great boat-like shoes, they were Gretel's of\ncourse. He would have known them anywhere.\n\nThat bright coquettish red jacket, with its pretty skirt, bordered with\nblack, that graceful cap bobbing over the gold earrings, that dainty\napron, and those snug leather shoes that seemed to have grown with the\nfeet--Why if the Pope of Rome had sent them to him by express, Hans\ncould have sworn they were Annie's.\n\nThe two girls were slowly pacing up and down in front of the cottage.\nTheir arms were entwined, of course, and their heads were nodding and\nshaking as emphatically as if all the affairs of the kingdom were under\ndiscussion.\n\nWith a joyous shout, Hans hastened toward them.\n\n\"Huzza, girls, I've found work!\"\n\nThis brought his mother to the cottage door.\n\nShe, too, had pleasant tidings. The father was still improving. He had\nbeen sitting up nearly all day, and was now sleeping as Dame Brinker\ndeclared, \"just as quiet as a lamb.\"\n\n\"It is my turn now, Hans,\" said Annie, drawing him aside after he had\ntold his mother the good word from Mynheer van Holp. \"Your skates are\nsold and here's the money.\"\n\n\"Seven guilders!\" cried Hans counting the pieces in astonishment; \"why,\nthat is three times as much as I paid for them.\"\n\n\"I cannot help that,\" said Annie. \"If the buyer knew no better, it is\nnot our fault.\"\n\nHans looked up quickly.\n\n\"Oh, Annie!\"\n\n\"Oh, Hans!\" she mimicked, pursing her lips, and trying to look\ndesperately wicked and unprincipled.\n\n\"Now, Annie, I know you would never mean that! You must return some of\nthis money.\"\n\n\"But I'll not do any such thing,\" insisted Annie; \"they're sold, and\nthat's an end of it,\" then seeing that he looked really pained she added\nin a lower tone:\n\n\"Will you believe me, Hans, when I say that there has been no\nmistake--that the person who bought your skates _insisted_ upon paying\nseven guilders for them?\"\n\n\"I will,\" he answered--and the light from his clear blue eyes seemed to\nsettle and sparkle under Annie's lashes.\n\nDame Brinker was delighted at the sight of so much silver, but when she\nlearned that Hans had parted with his treasures to obtain it, she\nsighed, as she exclaimed:\n\n\"Bless thee, child! That will be a sore loss for thee!\"\n\n\"Here, mother,\" said the boy, plunging his hands far into his pockets,\n\"here is more--we shall be rich if we keep on!\"\n\n\"Aye, indeed,\" she answered, eagerly reaching forth her hand. Then,\nlowering her voice, added, \"we _would_ be rich but for that Jan\nKamphuisen. He was at the willow tree years ago, Hans--depend upon it!\"\n\n\"Indeed, it seems likely,\" sighed Hans. \"Well, mother, we must give up\nthe money bravely. It is certainly gone; the father has told us all he\nknows. Let us think no more about it.\"\n\n\"That's easy saying, Hans. I shall try, but it's hard, and my poor man\nwanting so many comforts. Bless me! How girls fly about. They were here\nbut this instant. Where did they run to?\"\n\n\"They slipped behind the cottage,\" said Hans, \"like enough to hide from\nus. Hist! I'll catch them for you! They both can move quicker and softer\nthan yonder rabbit, but I'll give them a good start first.\"\n\n\"Why, there _is_ a rabbit, sure enough. Hold, Hans, the poor thing must\nhave been in sore need to venture from its burrow this bitter weather.\nI'll get a few crumbs for it within.\"\n\nSo saying, the good woman bustled into the cottage. She soon came out\nagain, but Hans had forgotten to wait, and the rabbit after taking a\ncool survey of the premises had scampered off to unknown quarters.\nTurning the corner of the cottage, Dame Brinker came upon the children.\nHans and Gretel were standing before Annie who was seated carelessly\nupon a stump.\n\n\"That is as good as a picture!\" cried Dame Brinker halting in admiration\nof the group. \"Many a painting have I seen at the grand house at\nHeidelberg not a whit prettier. My two are rough chubs, Annie, but\n_you_ look like a fairy.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" laughed Annie, sparkling with animation. \"Well then, Gretel and\nHans, imagine I'm your godmother just paying you a visit. Now I'll grant\nyou each a wish. What will you have, Master Hans?\"\n\nA shade of earnestness passed over Annie's face as she looked up at\nhim--perhaps it was because she wished from the depths of her heart that\nfor once she could have a fairy's power.\n\nSomething whispered to Hans that, for the moment, she was more than\nmortal.\n\n\"I wish,\" said he, solemnly, \"I could find something I was searching for\nlast night.\"\n\nGretel laughed merrily. Dame Brinker moaned, \"Shame on you, Hans!\" and\npassed wearily into the cottage.\n\nThe fairy godmother sprang up and stamped her foot three times.\n\n\"Thou shalt have thy wish,\" said she, \"let them say what they will.\"\nThen with playful solemnity, she put her hand in her apron pocket and\ndrew forth a large glass bead. \"Bury this,\" said she, giving it to Hans,\n\"where I have stamped, and ere moonrise thy wish shall be granted.\"\n\nGretel laughed more merrily than ever.\n\nThe godmother pretended great displeasure.\n\n\"Naughty child,\" said she, scowling terribly. \"In punishment for\nlaughing at a fairy, _thy_ wish shall not be granted.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Gretel in high glee, \"better wait till you're asked,\ngodmother. I haven't made any wish!\"\n\nAnnie acted her part well. Never smiling, through all their merry\nlaughter, she stalked away, the embodiment of offended dignity.\n\n\"Good-night, fairy!\" they cried again and again.\n\n\"Good-night, mortals!\" she called out at last as she sprang over a\nfrozen ditch, and ran quickly homeward.\n\n\"Oh, isn't she--just like flowers--so sweet and lovely!\" cried Gretel,\nlooking after her in great admiration, \"and to think how many days she\nstays in that dark room with her grandmother--Why, brother Hans! What is\nthe matter? What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Wait and see!\" answered Hans as he plunged into the cottage and came\nout again, all in an instant, bearing the spade and ysbrekker in his\nhands--\"I'm going to bury my magic bead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRaff Brinker still slept soundly; his wife took a small block of peat\nfrom her nearly exhausted store, and put it upon the embers. Then\nopening the door, she called gently:\n\n\"Come in, children.\"\n\n\"Mother! mother! See here!\" shouted Hans.\n\n\"Holy St. Bavon!\" exclaimed the dame, springing over the door-step.\n\"What ails the boy!\"\n\n\"Come quick, mother,\" he cried, in great excitement, working with all\nhis might, and driving in the ysbrekker at each word. \"Don't you see?\n_This_ is the spot--right here on the south side of the stump.\nWhy didn't we think of it last night? _The stump_ is the old\nwillow-tree--the one you cut down last spring because it shaded the\npotatoes. That little tree wasn't here when father--Huzzah!\"\n\nDame Brinker could not speak. She dropped on her knees beside Hans just\nin time to see him drag forth--_the old stone pot_!\n\nHe thrust in his hand and took out--a piece of brick--then another--then\nanother--then, the stocking and the pouch, black and mouldy, but filled\nwith the long lost treasure!\n\nSuch a time! Such laughing! Such crying! Such counting, after they went\ninto the cottage! It was a wonder that Raff did not waken. His dreams\nwere pleasant, however, for he smiled in his sleep.\n\nDame Brinker and her children had a fine supper, I can assure you. No\nneed of saving the delicacies now.\n\n\"We'll get father some nice fresh things, to-morrow,\" said the dame, as\nshe brought forth cold meat, wine, bread and jelly, and placed them on\nthe clean pine table. \"Sit by, children, sit by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, Annie fell asleep wondering whether it was a knife Hans had\nlost, and thinking how funny it would be if he should find it, after\nall.\n\nHans had scarce closed his eyes, before he found himself trudging\nthrough a thicket; pots of gold were lying all around, and watches, and\nskates, and glittering beads were swinging from every branch.\n\nStrange to say, each tree, as he approached it, changed into a stump,\nand on the stump sat the prettiest fairy imaginable, clad in a scarlet\njacket, and blue petticoat.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Good-night,\" they cried_]\n\n\n\n\nXLII\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS WATCH\n\n\nSomething else than the missing guilders was brought to light on the day\nof the fairy godmother's visit. This was the story of the watch that for\nten long years had been so jealously guarded by Raff's faithful vrouw.\nThrough many an hour of sore temptation she had dreaded almost to look\nupon it, lest she might be tempted to disobey her husband's request. It\nhad been hard to see her children hungry and to know that the watch, if\nsold, would enable the roses to bloom in their cheeks again--\"but nay,\"\nshe would exclaim, \"Meitje Brinker is not one to forget her man's last\nbidding, come what may.\"\n\n\"Take good care of this, mine vrouw,\" he had said, as he handed it to\nher--that was all. No explanation followed, for the words were scarcely\nspoken, when one of his fellow workmen rushed into the cottage, crying,\n\"Come, man! the waters are rising! you're wanted on the dykes.\"\n\nRaff had started at once, and that, as Dame Brinker has already told\nyou, was the last she saw of him in his right mind.\n\nOn the day when Hans was in Amsterdam looking for work, and Gretel,\nafter performing her household labors, was wandering about in search of\nchips, twigs--anything that could be burned, Dame Brinker with\nsuppressed excitement had laid the watch in her husband's hand.\n\n\"It wasn't in reason,\" as she afterward said to Hans, \"to wait any\nlonger, when a word from the father would settle all; no woman living\nbut would want to know how he came by that watch.\" Raff Brinker turned\nthe bright, polished thing over and over in his hand--then he examined\nthe bit of smoothly ironed black ribbon fastened to it; he seemed hardly\nto recognize it. At last he said, \"Ah, I remember this! Why, you've been\nrubbing it, vrouw, till it shines like a new guilder.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Dame Brinker nodding her head complacently.\n\nRaff looked at it again. \"Poor boy!\" he murmured, then fell into a brown\nstudy.\n\nThis was too much for the dame. \"Poor boy!\" she echoed, somewhat tartly.\n\"What do you think I'm standing here for, Raff Brinker, and my spinning\na-waiting, if not to hear more than that?\"\n\n\"I told ye all, long since,\" said Raff, positively, as he looked up in\nsurprise.\n\n\"Indeed, and you never did!\" retorted the vrouw.\n\n\"Well, if not--since it's no affair of ours--we'll say no more about\nit,\" said Raff, shaking his head sadly; \"like enough while I've been\ndead on the earth, all this time, the poor boy's died and been in\nHeaven. He looked near enough to it, poor lad!\"\n\n\"Raff Brinker! If you're going to treat me this way, and I nursing you\nand bearing with you since I was twenty-two years old, it's a shame!\naye, and a disgrace,\" cried the vrouw growing quite red, and scant of\nbreath.\n\nRaff's voice was feeble yet. \"Treat you _what_ way, Meitje?\"\n\n\"What way,\" said Dame Brinker, mimicking his voice and manner, \"what\nway? why just as every woman in the world is treated after she's stood\nby a man through the worst, like a----\"\n\n\"Meitje!\"\n\nRaff was leaning forward, with outstretched arms. His eyes were full of\ntears.\n\nIn an instant Dame Brinker was at his feet, clasping his hands in hers.\n\n\"Oh! what have I done! Made my good man cry, and he not back with me\nfour days! Look up, Raff! nay, Raff, my own boy, I'm sorry I hurt thee.\nIt's hard not to be told about the watch after waiting ten years to\nknow--but I'll ask thee no more, Raff. Here, we'll put the thing away\nthat's made the first trouble between us, after God just giving thee\nback to me.\"\n\n\"I was a fool to cry, Meitje,\" he said, kissing her, \"and it's no more\nthan right ye should know the truth. But it seemed like it might be\ntelling the secrets of the dead to talk about the matter.\"\n\n\"Is the man--the lad--thou wert talking of dead, think thee?\" asked the\nvrouw, hiding the watch in her hand, but seating herself expectantly on\nthe end of his long foot-bench.\n\n\"It's hard telling,\" he answered.\n\n\"Was he so sick, Raff?\"\n\n\"No, not sick, I may say; but troubled, vrouw, very troubled.\"\n\n\"Had he done any wrong, think ye?\" she asked lowering her voice.\n\nRaff nodded.\n\n\"_Murder?_\" whispered the wife, not daring to look up.\n\n\"He said it was like to that, indeed.\"\n\n\"Oh! Raff, you frighten me--tell me more--you speak so strange--and you\ntremble. I must know all.\"\n\n\"If I tremble, mine vrouw, it must be from the fever. There is no guilt\non my soul, thank God!\"\n\n\"Take a sip of this wine, Raff. There, now you are better. It was like\nto a crime you were saying.\"\n\n\"Aye, Meitje, like to murder; _that_ he told me himself. But I'll never\nbelieve it. A likely lad, fresh and honest looking as our own youngster,\nbut with something not so bold and straight about him.\"\n\n\"Aye, I know,\" said the dame, gently, fearing to interrupt the story.\n\n\"He came upon me quite sudden,\" continued Raff. \"I had never seen his\nface before, the palest, frightenedest face that ever was. He caught me\nby the arm. 'You look like an honest man,' says he.\"\n\n\"Aye, he was right in that,\" interrupted the dame, emphatically.\n\nRaff looked somewhat bewildered.\n\n\"Where was I, mine vrouw?\"\n\n\"The lad took hold of your arm, Raff,\" she said, gazing at him\nanxiously.\n\n\"Aye, so. The words come awkward to me, and everything is half like a\ndream, ye see.\"\n\n\"S-stut! What wonder, poor man,\" sighed the dame, stroking his hand. \"If\nye had not head enough for a dozen, the wit would never have come to ye\nagain. Well, the lad caught ye by the arm, and said ye looked honest\n(well he might!). What then? Was it noon-time?\"\n\n\"Nay; before daylight--long before early chimes.\"\n\n\"It was the same day you were hurt,\" said the dame. \"I know it seemed\nyou went to your work in the middle of the night. You left off, where\nhe caught your arm, Raff.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed her husband--\"and I can see his face this minute--so\nwhite and wild looking. 'Take me down the river a way,' says he. I was\nworking then, you'll remember, far down on the line, across from\nAmsterdam. I told him I was no boatman. 'It's an affair of life and\ndeath,' says he; 'take me on a few miles--yonder skiff is not locked,\nbut it may be a poor man's boat and I'd be loath to rob him!' (The words\nmight differ some, vrouw, for it's all like a dream.) Well, I took him\ndown; it might be six or eight miles, and then he said he could run the\nrest of the way on shore. I was in haste to get the boat back. Before he\njumped out, he says, sobbing-like, 'I can trust you. I've done a\nthing--God knows I never intended it--but the man is dead. I must fly\nfrom Holland.'\"\n\n\"What was it, did he say, Raff? Had he been shooting at a comrade, like\nthey do down at the University at Gottingen?\"\n\n\"I can't recall that. Mayhap he told me; but it's all like a dream. I\nsaid it wasn't for me, a good Hollander, to cheat the laws of my country\nby helping him off that way; but he kept saying, 'God knows I am\ninnocent!' and looked at me in the starlight as fair, now, and\nclear-eyed as our little Hans might--and I just pulled away faster.\"\n\n\"It must have been Jan Kamphuisen's boat,\" remarked Dame Brinker, dryly;\n\"none other would have left his oars out that careless.\"\n\n\"Aye--it was Jan's boat sure enough. The man will be coming in to see me\nSunday, likely, if he's heard; and young Hoogsvliet too. Where was I?\"\n\n[It was lucky the dame restrained herself. To have spoken at all of Jan\nafter the last night's cruel disappointment would have been to have let\nout more sorrow and suspicion than Raff could bear.]\n\n\"Where were you? Why not very far, forsooth--the lad hadn't yet given ye\nthe watch--alack I misgive whether he came by it honestly!\"\n\n\"Why, vrouw,\" exclaimed Raff in an injured tone, \"he was dressed soft\nand fine as the prince himself. The watch was his own, clear enough.\"\n\n\"How came he to give it up?\" asked the dame, looking uneasily at the\nfire, for it needed another block of peat.\n\n\"I told ye just now,\" he answered with a puzzled air.\n\n\"Tell me again,\" said Dame Brinker, wisely warding off another\ndigression.\n\n\"Well, just before jumping from the boat, he says, handing me the watch,\n'I'm flying from my country as I never thought I could. I'll trust you\nbecause you look honest. Will you take this to my father--not to-day but\nin a week, and tell him his unhappy boy sent it; and tell him if ever\nthe time comes that he wants me to come back to him, I'll brave\neverything and come. Tell him to send a letter to--to'--there, the rest\nis all gone from me. I _can't_ remember where the letter was to go. Poor\nlad! poor lad,\" resumed Raff, sorrowfully taking the watch from his\nvrouw's lap, as he spoke--\"and it's never been sent to his father to\nthis day.\"\n\n\"I'll take it, Raff, never fear--the moment Gretel gets back. She will\nbe in soon. What was the father's name did you say? Where were you to\nfind him?\"\n\n\"Alack!\" answered Raff, speaking very slowly, \"it's all slipped me. I\ncan see the lad's face, and his great eyes, just as plain--and I\nremember his opening the watch, and snatching something from it and\nkissing it--but no more. All the rest whirls past me; there's a kind of\nsound like rushing waters comes over me when I try to think.\"\n\n\"Aye. That's plain to see, Raff; but I've had the same feeling after a\nfever. You're tired now--I must get ye straight on the bed again. Where\n_is_ the child, I wonder?\"\n\nDame Brinker opened the door, and called, \"Gretel! Gretel!\"\n\n\"Stand aside, vrouw,\" said Raff, feebly, as he leaned forward, and\nendeavored to look out upon the bare landscape; \"I've half a mind to\nstand beyond the door just once.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" she laughed, \"I'll tell the meester how ye tease, and fidget\nand bother, to be let out in the air; and, if he says it, I'll bundle ye\nwarm to-morrow, and give ye a turn on your feet. But I'm freezing you\nwith this door open. I declare if there isn't Gretel with her apron\nfull, skating on the canal, like wild. Why, man,\" she continued almost\nin a scream, as she slammed the door, \"thou'rt walking to the bed\nwithout my touching thee! Thou'lt fall!\"\n\nThe dame's \"thee\" proved her mingled fear and delight, even more than\nthe rush which she made toward her husband. Soon he was comfortably\nsettled under the new cover, declaring as his vrouw tucked him in snug\nand warm, that it was the last daylight that should see him abed.\n\n\"Aye! I can hope it myself,\" laughed Dame Brinker, \"now you have been\nfrisking about at that rate.\" As Raff closed his eyes, the dame hastened\nto revive her fire, or rather to dull it, for Dutch peat is like a\nDutchman, slow to kindle, but very good at a blaze when once started.\nThen putting her neglected spinning-wheel away, she drew forth her\nknitting from some invisible pocket and seated herself by the bedside.\n\n\"If you could remember that man's name, Raff,\" she began cautiously, \"I\nmight take the watch to him, while you're sleeping; Gretel can't but be\nin soon.\"\n\nRaff tried to think; but in vain.\n\n\"Could it be Boomphoffen,\" suggested the dame. \"I've heard how they've\nhad two sons turn out bad--Gerard and Lambert?\"\n\n\"It might be,\" said Raff. \"Look if there's letters on the watch; that'll\nguide us some.\"\n\n\"Bless thee, man,\" cried the happy dame, eagerly lifting the watch, \"why\nthou'rt sharper than ever! Sure enough. Here's letters! L. J. B. That's\nLambert Boomphoffen you may depend; what the J is for I can't say; but\nthey used to be grand kind o' people, high feathered as fancy fowl. Just\nthe kind to give their children all double names, which isn't scripture\nanyway.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, vrouw. Seems to me there's long mixed names in\nthe Holy Book, hard enough to make out. But you've got the right guess\nat a jump. It was your way always,\" said Raff, closing his eyes; \"take\nthe watch to Boompkinks and try.\"\n\n\"Not Boompkinks; I know no such name; it's Boomphoffen.\"\n\n\"Aye, take it there.\"\n\n\"Take it there, man! why the whole brood of 'em's been gone to America\nthese four years. But go to sleep, Raff; you look pale and out of\nstrength. It'll all come to you, what's best to do, in the morning.\n\n\"So, Mistress Gretel! Here you are at last!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore Raff awoke that evening, the fairy godmother, as we know, had\nbeen at the cottage, the guilders were once more safely locked in the\nbig chest, and Dame Brinker and the children were faring sumptuously on\nmeat and white bread and wine.\n\nSo the mother, in the joy of her heart, told them the story of the watch\nas far as she deemed it prudent to divulge it. It was no more than fair,\nshe thought, that the poor things should know, after keeping the secret\nso safe, ever since they had been old enough to know anything.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII\n\nA DISCOVERY\n\n\nThe next sun brought a busy day to the Brinkers.\n\nIn the first place the news of the thousand guilders had of course to be\ntold to the father. Such tidings as that surely could not harm him. Then\nwhile Gretel was diligently obeying her mother's injunction to \"clean\nthe place fresh as a new brewing,\" Hans and the dame sallied forth to\nrevel in the purchasing of peat and provisions.\n\nHans was careless and contented; the dame was filled with delightful\nanxieties caused by the unreasonable demands of ten thousand guilders'\nworth of new wants that had sprung up like mushrooms in a single night.\nThe happy woman talked so largely to Hans on their way to Amsterdam, and\nbrought back such little bundles after all, that he scratched his\nbewildered head as he leaned against the chimneypiece, wondering\nwhether, \"bigger the pouch, tighter the string\" was in Jacob Cats, and\ntherefore true, or whether he had dreamed it when he lay in a fever.\n\n\"What thinking on, Big-eyes?\" chirruped his mother, half reading his\nthoughts as she bustled about, preparing the dinner. \"What thinking on?\nWhy, Raff, would ye believe it, the child thought to carry half\nAmsterdam back on his head. Bless us! he would have bought as much\ncoffee as would have filled this fire-pot; 'no--no--my lad,' says I, 'no\ntime for leaks when the ship is rich laden'--and then how he\nstared--aye--just as he stares this minute. Hoot lad! fly around a\nmite. Ye'll grow to the chimney-place with your staring and wondering.\nNow, Raff, here's your chair at the head of the table, where it should\nbe, for there's A MAN to the house now--I'd say it to the king's face.\nAye, that's the way--lean on Hans; there's a strong staff for you!\ngrowing like a weed too, and it seems only yesterday since he was\ntoddling. Sit by, my man, sit by.\"\n\n\"Can you call to mind, vrouw,\" said Raff, settling himself cautiously in\nthe big chair, \"the wonderful music-box that cheered your working in the\nbig house at Heidelberg?\"\n\n\"Aye, that I can,\" answered the dame, \"three turns of a brass key, and\nthe witchy thing would send the music fairly running up and down one's\nback--I remember it well--but, Raff,\" (growing solemn in an instant)\n\"you would never throw our guilders away for a thing like that?\"\n\n\"No, no, not I, vrouw--for the good Lord has already given me a\nmusic-box without pay.\"\n\nAll three cast quick, frightened glances at one another and at\nRaff--were his wits on the wing again?\n\n\"Aye, and a music-box that fifty pouch-full would not buy from me,\"\ninsisted Raff; \"and it's set going by the turn of a mop handle, and it\nslips and glides around the room, everywhere in a flash, carrying the\nmusic about till you'd swear the birds were back again.\"\n\n\"Holy St. Bavon!\" screeched the dame, \"what's in the man?\"\n\n\"Comfort and joy, vrouw, that's what's in him! Ask Gretel, ask my little\nmusic-box Gretel, if your man has lacked comfort and joy this day.\"\n\n\"Not he, mother,\" laughed Gretel. \"He's been _my_ music-box, too. We\nsang together half the time you were gone.\"\n\n\"Aye, so,\" said the dame, greatly relieved. \"Now, Hans, you'll never get\nthrough with a piece like that; but never mind, chick, thou'st had a\nlong fasting; here, Gretel, take another slice of the sausage; it'll put\nblood in your cheeks.\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh! mother,\" laughed Gretel, eagerly holding forth her platter,\n\"blood don't grow in girls' cheeks--you mean roses--isn't it roses,\nHans?\"\n\nWhile Hans was hastily swallowing a mammoth mouthful in order to give a\nsuitable reply to this poetic appeal, Dame Brinker settled the matter\nwith a quick:\n\n\"Well, roses or blood it's all one to me, so the red finds its way on\nyour sunny face. It's enough for mother to get pale and weary-looking,\nwithout----\"\n\n\"Hoot, vrouw,\" spoke up Raff hastily, \"thou'rt fresher and rosier this\nminute than both our chicks put together.\"\n\nThis remark though not bearing very strong testimony to the clearness of\nRaff's newly awakened intellect, nevertheless afforded the dame intense\nsatisfaction; the meal accordingly passed off in the most delightful\nmanner.\n\nAfter dinner, the affair of the watch was talked over and the mysterious\ninitials duly discussed.\n\nHans had just pushed back his stool, intending to start at once for\nMynheer van Holp's, and his mother had risen to put the watch away in\nits old hiding place, when they heard the sound of wheels upon the\nfrozen ground.\n\nSome one knocked at the door, opening it at the same time.\n\n\"Come in,\" stammered Dame Brinker hastily trying to hide the watch in\nher bosom. \"Oh! is it you, mynheer! Good day; the father is nearly well,\nas you see. It's a poor place to greet you in, mynheer, and the dinner\nnot cleared away.\"\n\nDr. Boekman scarcely noticed the dame's apology. He was evidently in\nhaste.\n\n\"Ahem!\" he exclaimed, \"not needed here, I perceive. The patient is\nmending fast.\"\n\n\"Well he may, mynheer,\" cried the dame, \"for only last night we found a\nthousand guilders that's been lost to us these ten years.\"\n\nDr. Boekman opened his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, mynheer,\" said Raff. \"I bid the vrouw tell you, though it's to be\nheld a secret among us, for I see you can keep your lips closed as well\nas any man.\"\n\nThe doctor scowled. He never liked personal remarks.\n\n\"Now, mynheer,\" continued Raff, \"you can take your rightful pay. God\nknows you have earned it, if bringing such a poor tool back to the\nworld, and his family, can be called a service. Tell the vrouw what's to\npay, mynheer; she will hand out the sum right willingly.\"\n\n\"Tut! tut!\" said the doctor kindly, \"say nothing about money. I can find\nplenty of such pay any time, but gratitude comes seldom. That boy's\n'thank you,'\" he added, nodding sidewise toward Hans, \"was pay enough\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Like enough ye have a boy of your own,\" said Dame Brinker, quite\ndelighted to see the great man becoming so sociable.\n\nDr. Boekman's good-nature vanished at once. He gave a growl (at least,\nit seemed so to Gretel) but made no actual reply.\n\n\"Do not think the vrouw meddlesome, mynheer,\" said Raff; \"she has been\nsore touched of late about a lad whose folks have gone away, none know\nwhere; and I had a message for them from the young gentleman.\"\n\n\"The name was Boomphoffen,\" said the dame eagerly. \"Do you know aught of\nthe family, mynheer?\"\n\nThe doctor's reply was brief and gruff.\n\n\"Yes. A troublesome set. They went long since to America.\"\n\n\"It might be, Raff,\" persisted Dame Brinker, timidly, \"that the meester\nknows somebody in that country, though I'm told they are mostly savages\nover there. If he could get the watch to the Boomphoffens with the poor\nlad's message, it would be a most blessed thing.\"\n\n\"Tut! vrouw, why pester the good meester and dying men and women wanting\nhim everywhere. How do ye know ye have the true name?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" she replied. \"They had a son Lambert, and there's an L\nfor Lambert and a B for Boomphoffen, on the back; though to be sure\nthere's an odd J too, but the meester can look for himself.\"\n\nSo saying, she drew forth the watch.\n\n\"L. J. B.!\" cried Dr. Boekman springing toward her.\n\nWhy attempt to describe the scene that followed! I need only say that\nthe lad's message was delivered to his father at last--delivered while\nthe great surgeon was sobbing like a little child.\n\n\"Laurens! my Laurens?\" he cried, gazing with yearning eyes at the watch\nas he held it tenderly in his palm. \"Ah, if I had but known sooner!\nLaurens a homeless wanderer--Great Heaven! he may be suffering, dying at\nthis moment! Think, man, where is he? Where did my boy say the letter\nmust be sent?\"\n\nRaff shook his head sadly.\n\n\"Think!\" implored the doctor. Surely the memory so lately awakened\nthrough his aid could not refuse to serve him in a moment like this.\n\n\"It is all gone, mynheer,\" sighed Raff.\n\nHans, forgetting distinctions of rank and station, forgetting everything\nbut that his good friend was in trouble, threw his arms round the\ndoctor's neck.\n\n\"I can find your son, mynheer. If alive, he is _somewhere_. The earth is\nnot so very large. I will devote every day of my life to the search.\nMother can spare me, now. You are rich, mynheer; send me where you\nwill.\"\n\nGretel began to cry. It was right for Hans to go but how could they ever\nlive without him?\n\nDr. Boekman made no reply, neither did he push Hans away. His eyes were\nfixed anxiously upon Raff Brinker. Suddenly he lifted the watch, and\nwith trembling eagerness attempted to open it. Its stiffened spring\nyielded at last; the case flew open, disclosing a watch-paper in the\nback bearing a group of blue forget-me-nots. Raff, seeing a shade of\nintense disappointment pass over the doctor's face, hastened to say:\n\n\"There was something else in it, mynheer, but the young gentleman tore\nit out before he handed it to me. I saw him kiss it as he put it away.\"\n\n\"It was his mother's picture,\" moaned the doctor; \"she died when he was\nten years old. Thank God! the boy had not forgotten. Both dead? It is\nimpossible!\" he cried, starting up. \"My boy is alive. You shall hear his\nstory. Laurens acted as my assistant. By mistake he portioned out the\nwrong medicine for one of my patients--a deadly poison--but it was never\nadministered, for I discovered the error in time. The man died that day.\nI was detained with other bad cases until the next evening. When I\nreached home, my boy was gone. Poor Laurens!\" sobbed the doctor,\nbreaking down completely, \"never to hear from me through all these\nyears. His message disregarded. Oh, what must he have suffered!\"\n\nDame Brinker ventured to speak. Anything was better than to see the\nmeester cry.\n\n\"It is a mercy to know the young gentleman was innocent. Ah! how he\nfretted! Telling you, Raff, that his crime was like unto murder. It was\nsending the wrong physic he meant. Crime indeed! why our own Gretel\nmight have done that! Like enough the poor young gentleman heard that\nthe man was dead--that's why he ran, mynheer. He said, you know, Raff,\nthat he never could come back to Holland again, unless\"--she\nhesitated--\"ah, your honor, ten years is a dreary time to be waiting to\nhear from----\"\n\n\"Hist, vrouw!\" said Raff sharply.\n\n\"Waiting to hear,\" groaned the doctor, \"and I, like a fool, sitting\nstubbornly at home, thinking he had abandoned me. I never dreamed,\nBrinker, that the boy had discovered the mistake. I believed it was\nyouthful folly--ingratitude--love of adventure, that sent him away. My\npoor, poor Laurens!\"\n\n\"But you know all, now, mynheer,\" whispered Hans. \"You know he was\ninnocent of wrong, that he loved you and his dead mother. We will find\nhim. You shall see him again, dear meester.\"\n\n\"God bless you!\" said Dr. Boekman, seizing the boy's hand, \"it may be as\nyou say. I shall try--I shall try--and, Brinker, if ever the faintest\ngleam of recollection concerning him should come to you, you will send\nme word at once?\"\n\n\"Indeed we will!\" cried all but Hans, whose silent promise would have\nsatisfied the doctor even had the others not spoken.\n\n\"Your boy's eyes,\" he said, turning to Dame Brinker, \"are strangely like\nmy son's. The first time I met him it seemed that Laurens himself was\nlooking at me.\"\n\n\"Aye, mynheer,\" replied the mother proudly. \"I have marked that you were\nmuch drawn to the child.\"\n\nFor a few moments the meester seemed lost in thought; then, arousing\nhimself, he spoke in a new voice:\n\n\"Forgive me, Raff Brinker, for this tumult. Do not feel distressed on my\naccount. I leave your house to-day a happier man than I have been for\nmany a long year. Shall I take the watch?\"\n\n\"Certain you must, mynheer. It was your son's wish.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" responded the doctor--regarding his treasure with a queer\nfrown, for his face could not throw off its bad habits in an hour--\"even\nso. And, now, I must be gone. No medicine is needed by my patient; only\npeace and cheerfulness, and both are here in plenty. Heaven bless you,\nmy good friends! I shall ever be grateful to you.\"\n\n\"May Heaven bless you, too, mynheer, and may you soon find the dear\nyoung gentleman,\" said Dame Brinker earnestly, after hurriedly wiping\nher eyes upon the corner of her apron.\n\nRaff uttered a hearty \"Amen!\" and Gretel threw such a wistful, eager\nglance at the doctor, that he patted her head as he turned to leave the\ncottage.\n\nHans went out also.\n\n\"When I can serve you, mynheer, I am ready.\"\n\n\"Very well, boy,\" replied Dr. Boekman with peculiar mildness. \"Tell\nthem, within, to say nothing of what has just passed. Meantime, Hans,\nwhen you are with your father, watch his mood. You have tact. At any\nmoment he may suddenly be able to tell us more.\"\n\n\"Trust me for that, mynheer.\"\n\n\"Good day, my boy!\" cried the doctor, as he sprang into his stately\ncoach.\n\n\"Aha!\" thought Hans, as it rolled away, \"the meester has more life in\nhim than I thought.\"\n\n\n\n\nXLIV\n\nTHE RACE\n\n\nThe Twentieth of December came at last, bringing with it the perfection\nof winter weather. All over the level landscape lay the warm sunlight.\nIt tried its power on lake, canal and river; but the ice flashed\ndefiance and showed no sign of melting. The very weather-cocks stood\nstill to enjoy the sight. This gave the windmills a holiday. Nearly all\nthe past week they had been whirling briskly; now, being rather out of\nbreath, they rocked lazily in the clear, still air. Catch a windmill\nworking when the weather-cocks have nothing to do!\n\nThere was an end to grinding, crushing and sawing for that day. It was a\ngood thing for the millers near Broek. Long before noon they concluded\nto take in their sails, and go to the race. Everybody would be\nthere--already the north side of the frozen Y was bordered with eager\nspectators; the news of the great skating match had traveled far and\nwide. Men, women, and children in holiday attire were flocking toward\nthe spot. Some wore furs, and wintry cloaks or shawls; but many,\nconsulting their feelings rather than the almanac, were dressed as for\nan October day.\n\nThe site selected for the race was a faultless plain of ice near\nAmsterdam, on that great _arm_ of the Zuider Zee which Dutchmen of\ncourse must call--the Eye. The townspeople turned out in large numbers.\nStrangers in the city deemed it a fine chance to see what was to be\nseen. Many a peasant from the northward had wisely chosen the Twentieth\nas the day for the next city-trading. It seemed that everybody, young\nand old, who had wheels, skates or feet at command, had hastened to the\nscene.\n\nThere were the gentry in their coaches, dressed like Parisians, fresh\nfrom the Boulevards; Amsterdam children in charity uniforms; girls from\nthe Roman Catholic Orphan House, in sable gowns and white head-bands;\nboys from the Burgher Asylum, with their black tights and short-skirted,\nharlequin coats.[29] There were old-fashioned gentlemen in cocked hats\nand velvet knee-breeches; old-fashioned ladies, too, in stiff, quilted\nskirts and bodies of dazzling brocade. These were accompanied by\nservants bearing foot-stoves and cloaks. There were the peasant folk\narrayed in every possible Dutch costume--Shy young rustics in brazen\nbuckles; simple village maidens concealing their flaxen hair under\nfillets of gold; women whose long, narrow aprons were stiff with\nembroidery; women with short, corkscrew curls hanging over their\nforeheads; women with shaved heads and close-fitting caps, and women in\nstriped skirts and windmill bonnets. Men in leather, in homespun, in\nvelvet and broadcloth; burghers in model European attire, and burghers\nin short jackets, wide trousers and steeple-crowned hats.\n\n[Footnote 29: This is not said in derision. Both the girls and boys of\nthis Institution wear garments quartered in red and black, alternately.\nBy making the dress thus conspicuous, the children are, in a measure,\ndeterred from wrong-doing while going about the city. The Burgher Orphan\nAsylum affords a comfortable home to several hundred boys and girls.\nHolland is famous for its charitable institutions.]\n\nThere were beautiful Friesland girls in wooden shoes and coarse\npetticoats, with solid gold crescents encircling their heads, finished\nat each temple with a golden rosette, and hung with lace a century old.\nSome wore necklaces, pendants and earrings of the purest gold. Many\nwere content with gilt or even with brass, but it is not an uncommon\nthing for a Friesland woman to have all the family treasure in her\nhead-gear. More than one rustic lass displayed the value of two thousand\nguilders upon her head that day.\n\nScattered throughout the crowd were peasants from the Island of Marken,\nwith sabots, black stockings, and the widest of breeches; also women\nfrom Marken with short blue petticoats, and black jackets, gaily figured\nin front. They wore red sleeves, white aprons, and a cap like a bishop's\nmitre over their golden hair.\n\nThe children often were as quaint and odd-looking as their elders. In\nshort, one-third of the crowd seemed to have stepped bodily from a\ncollection of Dutch paintings.\n\nEverywhere could be seen tall women, and stumpy men, lively faced girls,\nand youths whose expression never changed from sunrise to sunset.\n\nThere seemed to be at least one specimen from every known town in\nHolland. There were Utrecht water bearers, Gouda cheese makers, Delft\npottery-men, Schiedam distillers, Amsterdam diamond-cutters, Rotterdam\nmerchants, dried up herring-packers, and two sleepy-eyed shepherds from\nTexel. Every man of them had his pipe and tobacco-pouch. Some carried\nwhat might be called the smoker's complete outfit--a pipe, tobacco, a\npricker with which to clean the tube, a silver net for protecting the\nbowl, and a box of the strongest of brimstone matches.\n\nA true Dutchman, you must remember, is rarely without his pipe on any\npossible occasion. He may for a moment neglect to breathe, but when the\npipe is forgotten, he must be dying indeed. There were no such sad\ncases here. Wreaths of smoke were rising from every possible quarter.\nThe more fantastic the smoke wreath, the more placid and solemn the\nsmoker.\n\nLook at those boys and girls on stilts! That is a good idea. They can\nsee over the heads of the tallest. It is strange to see those little\nbodies high in the air, carried about on mysterious legs. They have such\na resolute look on their round faces, what wonder that nervous old\ngentlemen, with tender feet, wince and tremble while the long-legged\nlittle monsters stride past them.\n\nYou will read in certain books that the Dutch are a quiet people--so\nthey are generally--but listen: did ever you hear such a din? All made\nup of human voices--no, the horses are helping somewhat, and the fiddles\nare squeaking pitifully (how it must pain fiddles to be tuned!) but the\nmass of the sound comes from the great _vox humana_ that belongs to a\ncrowd.\n\nThat queer little dwarf going about with a heavy basket, winding in and\nout among the people, helps not a little. You can hear his shrill cry\nabove all the other sounds, \"Pypen en tabac! Pypen en tabac!\"\n\nAnother, his big brother though evidently some years younger, is selling\ndoughnuts and bonbons. He is calling on all pretty children far and near\nto come quickly or the cakes will be gone.\n\nYou know quite a number among the spectators. High up in yonder\npavilion, erected upon the border of the ice, are some persons whom you\nhave seen very lately. In the centre is Madame van Gleck. It is her\nbirthday, you remember; she has the post of honor. There is Mynheer van\nGleck whose meerschaum has not really grown fast to his lips--it only\nappears so. There are grandfather and grandmother whom you met at the\nSt. Nicholas f\u00c3\u00aate. All the children are with them. It is so mild they\nhave brought even the baby. The poor little creature is swaddled very\nmuch after the manner of an Egyptian mummy, but it can crow with\ndelight, and when the band is playing, open and shut its animated\nmittens in perfect time to the music.\n\nGrandfather with his pipe and spectacles and fur cap, makes quite a\npicture as he holds baby upon his knee. Perched high upon their canopied\nplatforms, the party can see all that is going on. No wonder the ladies\nlook complacently at the glassy ice; with a stove for a footstool one\nmight sit cozily beside the North Pole.\n\nThere is a gentleman with them who somewhat resembles St. Nicholas as he\nappeared to the young Van Glecks on the fifth of December. But the saint\nhad a flowing white beard; and this face is as smooth as a pippin. His\nsaintship was larger around the body, too, and (between ourselves) he\nhad a pair of thimbles in his mouth, which this gentleman certainly has\nnot. It cannot be Saint Nicholas after all.\n\nNear by, in the next pavilion sit the Van Holps with their son and\ndaughter (the Van Gends) from the Hague. Peter's sister is not one to\nforget her promises. She has brought bouquets of exquisite hothouse\nflowers for the winners.\n\nThese pavilions, and there are others beside, have all been erected\nsince daylight. That semicircular one, containing Mynheer Korbes'\nfamily, is very pretty, and proves that the Hollanders are quite skilled\nat tent-making, but I like the Van Glecks' best--the centre one--striped\nred and white, and hung with evergreens.\n\nThe one with the blue flags contains the musicians. Those pagoda-like\naffairs, decked with sea-shells and streamers of every possible hue, are\nthe judges' stands, and those columns and flagstaffs upon the ice mark\nthe limit of the race-course. The two white columns twined with green,\nconnected at the top by that long, floating strip of drapery, form the\nstarting-point. Those flagstaffs, half a mile off, stand at each end of\nthe boundary line, cut sufficiently deep to be distinct to the skaters,\nthough not enough so to trip them when they turn to come back to the\nstarting-point.\n\nThe air is so clear it seems scarcely possible that the columns and\nflagstaffs are so far apart. Of course the judges' stands are but little\nnearer together.\n\nHalf a mile on the ice, when the atmosphere is like this, is but a short\ndistance after all, especially when fenced with a living chain of\nspectators.\n\nThe music has commenced. How melody seems to enjoy itself in the open\nair! The fiddles have forgotten their agony, and everything is\nharmonious. Until you look at the blue tent it seems that the music\nsprings from the sunshine, it is so boundless, so joyous. Only when you\nsee the staid-faced musicians you realize the truth.\n\nWhere are the racers? All assembled together near the white columns. It\nis a beautiful sight. Forty boys and girls in picturesque attire darting\nwith electric swiftness in and out among each other, or sailing in pairs\nand triplets, beckoning, chatting, whispering in the fullness of\nyouthful glee.\n\nA few careful ones are soberly tightening their straps; others halting\non one leg, with flushed, eager faces suddenly cross the suspected skate\nover their knee, give it an examining shake, and dart off again. One\nand all are possessed with the spirit of motion. They cannot stand\nstill. Their skates are a part of them and every runner seems bewitched.\n\nHolland is the place for skaters after all. Where else can nearly every\nboy and girl perform feats on the ice that would attract a crowd if seen\non Central Park? Look at Ben! I did not see him before. He is really\nastonishing the natives; no easy thing to do in the Netherlands. Save\nyour strength, Ben, you will need it soon. Now other boys are trying!\nBen is surpassed already. Such jumping, such poising, such spinning,\nsuch india-rubber exploits generally! That boy with a red cap is the\nlion now; his back is a watch-spring, his body is cork--no it is iron,\nor it would snap at that! He is a bird, a top, a rabbit, a corkscrew, a\nsprite, a flesh-ball all in an instant. When you think he's erect he is\ndown; and when you think he is down he is up. He drops his glove on the\nice and turns a somersault as he picks it up. Without stopping, he\nsnatches the cap from Jacob Poot's astonished head and claps it back\nagain \"hind side before.\" Lookers-on hurrah and laugh. Foolish boy! It\nis Arctic weather under your feet, but more than temperate overhead. Big\ndrops already are rolling down your forehead. Superb skater as you are,\nyou may lose the race.\n\nA French traveler, standing with a note-book in his hand, sees our\nEnglish friend, Ben, buy a doughnut of the dwarf's brother, and eat it.\nThereupon he writes in his note-book, that the Dutch take enormous\nmouthfuls, and universally are fond of potatoes boiled in molasses.\n\nThere are some familiar faces near the white columns. Lambert, Ludwig,\nPeter and Carl are all there, cool and in good skating order. Hans is\nnot far off. Evidently he is going to join in the race, for his skates\nare on--the very pair that he sold for seven guilders! He had soon\nsuspected that his fairy godmother was the mysterious \"friend\" who\nbought them. This settled, he had boldly charged her with the deed, and\nshe knowing well that all her little savings had been spent in the\npurchase, had not had the face to deny it. Through the fairy godmother,\ntoo, he had been rendered amply able to buy them back again. Therefore\nHans is to be in the race. Carl is more indignant than ever about it,\nbut as three other peasant boys have entered, Hans is not alone.\n\nTwenty boys and twenty girls. The latter by this time are standing in\nfront, braced for the start, for they are to have the first \"run.\"\nHilda, Rychie and Katrinka are among them--two or three bend hastily to\ngive a last pull at their skate-straps. It is pretty to see them stamp,\nto be sure that all is firm. Hilda is speaking pleasantly to a graceful\nlittle creature in a red jacket and a new brown petticoat. Why, it is\nGretel! What a difference those pretty shoes make, and the skirt, and\nthe new cap. Annie Bouman is there too. Even Janzoon Kolp's sister has\nbeen admitted--but Janzoon himself has been voted out by the directors,\nbecause he killed the stork, and only last summer was caught in the act\nof robbing a bird's nest, a legal offence in Holland.\n\nThis Janzoon Kolp, you see, was----There, I cannot tell the story just\nnow. The race is about to commence.\n\nTwenty girls are formed in a line. The music has ceased.\n\nA man, whom we shall call The Crier, stands between the columns and the\nfirst judges' stand. He reads the rules in a loud voice:\n\n\"THE GIRLS AND BOYS ARE TO RACE IN TURN, UNTIL ONE GIRL AND ONE BOY HAS\nBEATEN TWICE. THEY ARE TO START IN A LINE FROM THE UNITED COLUMNS--SKATE\nTO THE FLAGSTAFF LINE, TURN, AND THEN COME BACK TO THE STARTING-POINT;\nTHUS MAKING A MILE AT EACH RUN.\"\n\nA flag is waved from the judges' stand. Madame van Gleck rises in her\npavilion. She leans forward with a white handkerchief in her hand. When\nshe drops it, a bugler is to give the signal for them to start.\n\nThe handkerchief is fluttering to the ground. Hark!\n\nThey are off!\n\nNo. Back again. Their line was not true in passing the judges' stand.\n\nThe signal is repeated.\n\nOff again. No mistake this time. Whew! how fast they go!\n\nThe multitude is quiet for an instant, absorbed in eager, breathless\nwatching.\n\nCheers spring up along the line of spectators. Huzza! five girls are\nahead. Who comes flying back from the boundary mark? We cannot tell.\nSomething red, that is all. There is a blue spot flitting near it, and a\ndash of yellow nearer still. Spectators at this end of the line strain\ntheir eyes and wish they had taken their post nearer the flagstaff.\n\nThe wave of cheers is coming back again. Now we can see! Katrinka is\nahead!\n\nShe passes the Van Holp pavilion. The next is Madame van Gleck's. That\nleaning figure gazing from it is a magnet. Hilda shoots past Katrinka,\nwaving her hand to her mother as she passes. Two others are close now,\nwhizzing on like arrows. What is that flash of red and gray? Hurrah, it\nis Gretel! She, too, weaves her hand, but toward no gay pavilion. The\ncrowd is cheering, but she hears only her father's voice, \"Well done,\nlittle Gretel!\" Soon Katrinka, with a quick merry laugh, shoots past\nHilda. The girl in yellow is gaining now. She passes them all, all\nexcept Gretel. The judges lean forward without seeming to lift their\neyes from their watches. Cheer after cheer fills the air; the very\ncolumns seem rocking. Gretel has passed them. She has won.\n\n\"GRETEL BRINKER--ONE MILE!\"--shouts the crier.\n\nThe judges nod. They write something upon a tablet which each holds in\nhis hand.\n\nWhile the girls are resting--some crowding eagerly around our frightened\nlittle Gretel, some standing aside in high disdain--the boys form in a\nline.\n\nMynheer van Gleck drops the handkerchief this time. The buglers give a\nvigorous blast!\n\nThe boys have started.\n\nHalf-way already! Did ever you see the like!\n\nThree hundred legs flashing by in an instant. But there are only twenty\nboys. No matter, there were hundreds of legs I am sure! Where are they\nnow? There is such a noise one gets bewildered. What are the people\nlaughing at? Oh, at that fat boy in the rear. See him go! See him! He'll\nbe down in an instant, no, he won't. I wonder if he knows he is all\nalone; the other boys are nearly at the boundary line. Yes, he knows it.\nHe stops! He wipes his hot face. He takes off his cap and looks about\nhim. Better to give up with a good grace. He has made a hundred friends\nby that hearty, astonished laugh. Good Jacob Poot!\n\nThe fine fellow is already among the spectators gazing as eagerly as the\nrest.\n\nA cloud of feathery ice flies from the heels of the skaters as they\n\"bring to\" and turn at the flagstaffs.\n\nSomething black is coming now, one of the boys--it is all we know. He\nhas touched the _vox humana_ stop of the crowd; it fairly roars. Now\nthey come nearer--we can see the red cap. There's Ben--there's\nPeter--there's Hans!\n\nHans is ahead! Young Madame van Gend almost crushes the flowers in her\nhand; she had been quite sure that Peter would be first. Carl Schummel\nis next, then Ben, and the youth with the red cap. The others are\npressing close. A tall figure darts from among them. He passes the red\ncap, he passes Ben, then Carl. Now it is an even race between him and\nHans. Madame van Gend catches her breath.\n\nIt is Peter! He is ahead! Hans shoots past him. Hilda's eyes fill with\ntears. Peter _must_ beat. Annie's eyes flash proudly. Gretel gazes with\nclasped hands--four strokes more will take her brother to the columns.\n\nHe is there! Yes, but so was young Schummel just a second before. At the\nlast instant, Carl, gathering his powers, had whizzed between them and\npassed the goal.\n\n\"CARL SCHUMMEL! ONE MILE!\" shouts the crier.\n\nSoon Madame van Gleck rises again. The falling handkerchief starts the\nbugle; and the bugle, using its voice as a bowstring, shoots off twenty\ngirls like so many arrows.\n\nIt is a beautiful sight, but one has not long to look; before we can\nfairly distinguish them they are far in the distance. This time they\nare close upon one another; it is hard to say as they come speeding back\nfrom the flagstaff which will reach the columns first. There are new\nfaces among the foremost--eager, glowing faces, unnoticed before.\nKatrinka is there, and Hilda, but Gretel and Rychie are in the rear.\nGretel is wavering, but when Rychie passes her, she starts forward\nafresh. Now they are nearly beside Katrinka. Hilda is still in advance;\nshe is almost \"home.\" She has not faltered since that bugle note sent\nher flying; like an arrow still she is speeding toward the goal. Cheer\nafter cheer rises in the air. Peter is silent but his eyes shine like\nstars. \"Huzza! Huzza!\"\n\nThe crier's voice is heard again.\n\n\"HILDA VAN GLECK, ONE MILE!\"\n\nA loud murmur of approval runs through the crowd, catching the music in\nits course, till all seems one sound, with a glad rhythmic throbbing in\nits depths. When the flag waves all is still.\n\nOnce more the bugle blows a terrific blast. It sends off the boys like\nchaff before the wind--dark chaff I admit, and in big pieces.\n\nIt is whisked around at the flagstaff, driven faster yet by the cheers\nand shouts along the line. We begin to see what is coming. There are\nthree boys in advance this time, and all abreast. Hans, Peter and\nLambert. Carl soon breaks the ranks, rushing through with a whiff! Fly,\nHans, fly, Peter, don't let Carl beat again. Carl the bitter, Carl the\ninsolent. Van Mounen is flagging, but you are strong as ever. Hans and\nPeter, Peter and Hans; which is foremost? We love them both. We scarcely\ncare which is the fleeter.\n\nHilda, Annie and Gretel seated upon the long crimson bench, can remain\nquiet no longer. They spring to their feet--so different, and yet one in\neagerness. Hilda instantly reseats herself; none shall know how\ninterested she is, none shall know how anxious, how filled with one\nhope. Shut your eyes then, Hilda--hide your face rippling with joy.\nPeter has beaten.\n\n\"PETER VAN HOLP, ONE MILE!\" calls the crier.\n\nThe same buzz of excitement as before, while the judges take notes, the\nsame throbbing of music through the din--but something is different. A\nlittle crowd presses close about some object, near the column. Carl has\nfallen. He is not hurt, though somewhat stunned. If he were less sullen\nhe would find more sympathy in these warm young hearts. As it is they\nforget him as soon as he is fairly on his feet again.\n\nThe girls are to skate their third mile.\n\nHow resolute the little maidens look as they stand in a line! Some are\nsolemn with a sense of responsibility, some wear a smile half bashful,\nhalf provoked, but one air of determination pervades them all.\n\nThis third mile may decide the race. Still if neither Gretel nor Hilda\nwin, there is yet a chance among the rest for the Silver Skates.\n\nEach girl feels sure that this time she will accomplish the distance in\none-half the time. How they stamp to try their runners, how nervously\nthey examine each strap--how erect they stand at last, every eye upon\nMadame van Gleck!\n\nThe bugle thrills through them again. With quivering eagerness they\nspring forward, bending, but in perfect balance. Each flashing stroke\nseems longer than the last.\n\nNow they are skimming off in the distance.\n\nAgain the eager straining of eyes--again the shouts and cheering, again\nthe thrill of excitement as, after a few moments, four or five, in\nadvance of the rest, come speeding back, nearer, nearer to the white\ncolumns.\n\nWho is first? Not Rychie, Katrinka, Annie, nor Hilda, nor the girl in\nyellow--but Gretel--Gretel, the fleetest sprite of a girl that ever\nskated. She was but playing in the earlier race, _now_ she is in\nearnest, or rather something within her has determined to win. That\nlithe little form makes no effort; but it cannot stop--not until the\ngoal is passed!\n\nIn vain the crier lifts his voice--he cannot be heard. He has no news to\ntell--it is already ringing through the crowd. _Gretel has won the\nSilver Skates!_\n\nLike a bird she has flown over the ice, like a bird she looks about her\nin a timid, startled way. She longs to dart to the sheltered nook where\nher father and mother stand. But Hans is beside her--the girls are\ncrowding round. Hilda's kind, joyous voice breathes in her ear. From\nthat hour, none will despise her. Goose-girl or not, Gretel stands\nacknowledged Queen of the Skaters!\n\nWith natural pride Hans turns to see if Peter van Holp is witnessing his\nsister's triumph. Peter is not looking toward them at all. He is\nkneeling, bending his troubled face low, and working hastily at his\nskate-strap. Hans is beside him at once.\n\n\"Are you in trouble, mynheer?\"\n\n\"Ah, Hans! that you? Yes, my fun is over. I tried to tighten my\nstrap--to make a new hole--and this botheration of a knife has cut it\nnearly in two.\"\n\n\"Mynheer,\" said Hans, at the same time pulling off a skate--\"you must\nuse my strap!\"\n\n\"Not I, indeed, Hans Brinker,\" cried Peter, looking up, \"though I thank\nyou warmly. Go to your post, my friend, the bugle will sound in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Mynheer,\" pleaded Hans in a husky voice, \"you have called me your\nfriend. Take this strap--quick! There is not an instant to lose. I shall\nnot skate this time--indeed I am out of practice. Mynheer, you _must_\ntake it\"--and Hans blind and deaf to any remonstrance, slipped his strap\ninto Peter's skate and implored him to put it on.\n\n\"Come, Peter!\" cried Lambert, from the line, \"we are waiting for you.\"\n\n\"For madame's sake,\" pleaded Hans, \"be quick. She is motioning to you to\njoin the racers. There the skate is almost on; quick, mynheer, fasten\nit. I could not possibly win. The race lies between Master Schummel and\nyourself.\"\n\n\"You are a noble fellow, Hans!\" cried Peter yielding at last. He sprang\nto his post just as the white handkerchief fell to the ground. The bugle\nsends forth its blast, loud, clear and ringing.\n\nOff go the boys!\n\n\"Mine gott,\" cries a tough old fellow from Delft. \"They beat everything,\nthese Amsterdam youngsters. See them!\"\n\nSee them, indeed! They are winged Mercuries every one of them. What mad\nerrand are they on? Ah, I know; they are hunting Peter van Holp. He is\nsome fleet-footed runaway from Olympus. Mercury and his troop of winged\ncousins are in full chase. They will catch him! Now Carl is the\nrunaway--the pursuit grows furious--Ben is foremost!\n\nThe chase turns in a cloud of mist. It is coming this way. Who is hunted\nnow? Mercury himself. It is Peter, Peter van Holp; fly, Peter--Hans is\nwatching you. He is sending all his fleetness, all his strength into\nyour feet. Your mother and sister are pale with eagerness. Hilda is\ntrembling and dare not look up. Fly, Peter! the crowd has not gone\nderanged, it is only cheering. The pursuers are close upon you! Touch\nthe white column! It beckons--it is reeling before you--it----\n\nHuzza! Huzza! Peter has won the Silver Skates!\n\n\"PETER VAN HOLP!\" shouted the crier. But who heard him? \"Peter van\nHolp!\" shouted a hundred voices, for he was the favorite boy of the\nplace. Huzza! Huzza!\n\nNow the music was resolved to be heard. It struck up a lively air, then\na tremendous march. The spectators thinking something new was about to\nhappen, deigned to listen and to look.\n\nThe racers formed in single file. Peter, being tallest, stood first.\nGretel, the smallest of all, took her place at the end. Hans, who had\nborrowed a strap from the cake-boy, was near the head.\n\nThree gaily twined arches were placed at intervals upon the river facing\nthe Van Gleck pavilion.\n\nSkating slowly, and in perfect time to the music, the boys and girls\nmoved forward, led on by Peter.\n\nIt was beautiful to see the bright procession glide along like a living\ncreature. It curved and doubled, and drew its graceful length in and out\namong the arches--whichever way Peter, the head, went, the body was sure\nto follow. Sometimes it steered direct for the centre arch, then, as if\nseized with a new impulse, turned away and curled itself about the first\none; then unwound slowly and bending low, with quick, snake-like\ncurvings, crossed the river, passing at length through the furthest\narch.\n\n[Illustration: _Skating slowly the boys and girls moved forward_]\n\nWhen the music was slow, the procession seemed to crawl like a thing\nafraid; it grew livelier, and the creature darted forward with a spring,\ngliding rapidly among the arches, in and out, curling, twisting,\nturning, never losing form until, at the shrill call of the bugle rising\nabove the music, it suddenly resolved itself into boys and girls\nstanding in double semicircle before Madame van Gleck's pavilion.\n\nPeter and Gretel stand in the centre in advance of the others. Madame\nvan Gleck rises majestically. Gretel trembles, but feels that she must\nlook at the beautiful lady. She cannot hear what is said, there is such\na buzzing all around her. She is thinking that she ought to try and make\na curtsey, such as her mother makes to the meester, when suddenly\nsomething so dazzling is placed in her hand that she gives a cry of joy.\n\nThen she ventures to look about her. Peter, too, has something in his\nhands--\"Oh! oh! how splendid!\" she cries, and \"oh! how splendid!\" is\nechoed as far as people can see.\n\nMeantime the silver skates flash in the sunshine, throwing dashes of\nlight upon those two happy faces.\n\nMevrouw van Gend sends a little messenger with her bouquets. One for\nHilda, one for Carl, and others for Peter and Gretel.\n\nAt sight of the flowers the Queen of the Skaters becomes uncontrollable.\nWith a bright stare of gratitude she gathers skates and bouquet in her\napron--hugs them to her bosom, and darts off to search for her father\nand mother in the scattering crowd.\n\n\n\n\nXLV\n\nJOY IN THE COTTAGE\n\n\nPerhaps you were surprised to learn that Raff and his vrouw were at the\nskating-race; you would have been more so had you been with them on the\nevening of that merry 20th of December. To see the Brinker cottage\nstanding sulkily alone on the frozen marsh, with its bulgy,\nrheumatic-looking walls, and its slouched hat of a roof pulled far over\nits eyes, one would never suspect that a lively scene was passing\nwithin. Without, nothing was left of the day but a low line of blaze at\nthe horizon. A few venturesome clouds had already taken fire, and\nothers, with their edges burning, were lost in the gathering smoke.\n\nA stray gleam of sunshine slipping down from the willow stump crept\nstealthily under the cottage. It seemed to feel that the inmates would\ngive it welcome if it could only get near them. The room under which it\nhid was as clean as clean could be. The very cracks in the rafters were\npolished. Delicious odors filled the air. A huge peat fire upon the\nhearth sent flashes of harmless lightning at the sombre walls. It played\nin turn upon the great leathern Bible, upon Gretel's closet-bed, the\nhousehold things on their pegs, and the beautiful Silver Skates and the\nflowers upon the table. Dame Brinker's honest face shone and twinkled in\nthe changing light. Gretel and Hans, with arms entwined, were leaning\nagainst the fireplace, laughing merrily, and Raff Brinker was dancing!\n\nI do not mean that he was pirouetting or cutting a pigeon-wing, either\nof which would have been entirely too undignified for the father of a\nfamily; I simply affirm that while they were chatting pleasantly\ntogether Raff suddenly sprang from his seat, snapped his fingers and\nperformed two or three flourishes very much like the climax of a\nHighland Fling. Next he caught his vrouw in his arms and fairly lifted\nher from the ground in his delight.\n\n\"Huzza!\" he cried, \"I have it! I have it! It's THOMAS HIGGS. That's the\nname! It came upon me like a flash; write it down, lad, write it down!\"\n\nSome one knocked at the door.\n\n\"It's the meester,\" cried the delighted dame. \"Goede Gunst! how things\ncome to pass!\"\n\nMother and children came in merry collision as they rushed to open the\ndoor.\n\nIt was not the doctor, after all, but three boys, Peter van Holp,\nLambert and Ben.\n\n\"Good-evening, young gentlemen,\" said Dame Brinker, so happy and proud\nthat she would scarce have been surprised at a visit from the King\nhimself.\n\n\"Good-evening, jufvrouw,\" said the trio, making magnificent bows.\n\n\"Dear me!\" thought Dame Brinker as she bobbed up and down like a churn\ndasher, \"it's lucky I learned to curtsey at Heidelberg!\"\n\nRaff was content to return the boys' salutations with a respectful nod.\n\n\"Pray be seated, young masters,\" said the dame, as Gretel bashfully\nthrust a stool toward them. \"There's a lack of chairs as you see, but\nthis one by the fire is at your service, and if you don't mind the\nhardness, that oak-chest is as good a seat as the best. That's right,\nHans, pull it out.\"\n\nBy the time the boys were seated to the dame's satisfaction, Peter,\nacting as spokesman, had explained that they were going to attend a\nlecture at Amsterdam, and had stopped on the way to return Hans' strap.\n\n\"Oh, mynheer,\" cried Hans earnestly, \"it is too much trouble. I am very\nsorry.\"\n\n\"No trouble at all, Hans. I could have waited for you to come to your\nwork to-morrow, had I not wished to call. And, Hans, talking of your\nwork, my father is much pleased with it; a carver by trade could not\nhave done it better. He would like to have the south arbor ornamented\nalso, but I told him you were going to school again.\"\n\n\"Aye!\" put in Raff Brinker, emphatically, \"Hans must go to school at\nonce--and Gretel as well--that is true.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" responded Peter, turning toward the\nfather, \"and very glad to know that you are again a well man.\"\n\n\"Yes, young master, a well man, and able to work as steady as\never--thank God!\"\n\n[Here Hans hastily wrote something on the edge of a time-worn almanac\nthat hung by the chimney-place.] \"Aye, that's right, lad, set it down.\nFiggs! Wiggs! Alack! Alack!\" added Raff in great dismay, \"it's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"All right, father,\" said Hans, \"the name's down now in black and white.\nHere, look at it, father; mayhap the rest will come to you. If we had\nthe place as well, it would be complete;\" then turning to Peter, he\nsaid in a low tone, \"I have an important errand in town, mynheer, and\nif----\"\n\n\"Wist!\" exclaimed the dame, lifting her hands, \"not to Amsterdam\nto-night, and you've owned your legs were aching under you. Nay,\nnay--it'll be soon enough to go at early daylight.\"\n\n\"Daylight indeed!\" echoed Raff, \"that would never do. Nay, Meitje, he\nmust go this hour.\"\n\nThe vrouw looked for an instant as if Raff's recovery was becoming\nrather a doubtful benefit; her word was no longer sole law in the house.\nFortunately, the proverb, \"Humble wife is husband's boss,\" had taken\ndeep root in her mind; even as the dame pondered, it bloomed.\n\n\"Very well, Raff,\" she said smilingly, \"it is thy boy as well as mine.\nAh! I've a troublesome house, young masters.\"\n\nJust then Peter drew a long strap from his pocket.\n\nHanding it to Hans he said in an undertone, \"I need not thank you for\nlending me this, Hans Brinker. Such boys as you do not ask for\nthanks--but I must say you did me a great kindness, and I am proud to\nacknowledge it. I did not know,\" he added, laughingly, \"until fairly in\nthe race, how anxious I was to win.\"\n\nHans was glad to join in Peter's laugh--it covered his embarrassment and\ngave his face a chance to cool off a little. Honest, generous boys like\nHans have such a stupid way of blushing when you least expect it.\n\n\"It was nothing, mynheer,\" said the dame, hastening to her son's relief;\n\"the lad's whole soul was in having you win the race, I know it was!\"\n\nThis helped matters beautifully.\n\n\"Ah, mynheer,\" Hans hurried to say, \"from the first start I felt stiff\nand strange on my feet; I was well out of it so long as I had no chance\nof winning.\"\n\nPeter looked rather distressed.\n\n\"We may hold different opinions there. That part of the business\ntroubles me. It is too late to mend it now, but it would be really a\nkindness to me if----\"\n\nThe rest of Peter's speech was uttered so confidentially that I cannot\nrecord it. Enough to say, Hans soon started back in dismay, and Peter,\nlooking very much ashamed, stammered out something to the effect that he\nwould keep them, since he won the race, but it was \"all wrong.\"\n\nHere Van Mounen coughed, as if to remind Peter that lecture-hour was\napproaching fast. At the same moment Ben laid something upon the table.\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed Peter, \"I forgot my other errand. Your sister ran off so\nquickly to-day, that Madame van Gleck had no opportunity to give her the\ncase for her skates.\"\n\n\"S-s-t!\" said Dame Brinker, shaking her head reproachfully at Gretel,\n\"she was a very rude girl I'm sure.\" [Secretly, she was thinking that\nvery few women had such a fine little daughter.]\n\n\"No, indeed,\" laughed Peter, \"she did exactly the right thing--ran home\nwith her richly won treasures--who would not? Don't let us detain you,\nHans,\" he continued turning around as he spoke; but Hans, who was\neagerly watching the father, seemed to have forgotten their presence.\n\nMeantime, Raff, lost in thought was repeating under his breath, \"Thomas\nHiggs--Thomas Higgs, aye, that's the name. Alack! if I could but tell\nthe place as well.\"\n\nThe skate-case was elegantly made of crimson morocco, ornamented with\nsilver. If a fairy had breathed upon its tiny key, or Jack Frost himself\ndesigned its delicate tracery, they could not have been more daintily\nbeautiful. FOR THE FLEETEST was written upon the cover in sparkling\nletters. It was lined with velvet, and in one corner was stamped the\nname and address of the maker.\n\nGretel thanked Peter in her own simple way; then, being quite delighted\nand confused, and not knowing what else to do, lifted the case,\ncarefully examining it in every part. \"It's made by Mynheer Birmingham,\"\nshe said after a while, still blushing and holding it before her eyes.\n\n\"Birmingham!\" replied Lambert van Mounen, \"that's the name of a place in\nEngland. Let me see it.\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" he laughed, holding the open case toward the firelight, \"no\nwonder you thought so; but it's a slight mistake. The case was made at\nBirmingham, but the maker's name is in smaller letters. Humph! they're\nso small, I can't read them.\"\n\n\"Let me try,\" said Peter, leaning over his shoulder. \"Why, man, it's\nperfectly distinct. It's T--H--it's T----\"\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Lambert, triumphantly, \"if you can read it so easily,\nlet's hear it, T--H, what?\"\n\n\"T. H--T. H. Oh! why, Thomas Higgs, to be sure,\" replied Peter, pleased\nto be able to decipher it at last. Then, feeling they had been behaving\nrather unceremoniously, he turned toward Hans--\n\nPeter turned pale! What was the matter with the people? Raff and Hans\nhad started up, and were staring at him, in glad amazement. Gretel\nlooked wild. Dame Brinker, with an unlighted candle in her hand, was\nrushing about the room, crying, \"Hans! Hans! where's your hat? oh, the\nmeester! Oh, the meester!\"\n\n\"Birmingham! Higgs!\" exclaimed Hans. \"Did you say Higgs? we've found\nhim! I must be off.\"\n\n\"You see, young masters,\" panted the dame, at the same time snatching\nHans' hat from the bed, \"you see--we know him--he's our--no, he isn't--I\nmean--oh, Hans, you must go to Amsterdam this minute!\"\n\n\"Good-night, mynheers,\" panted Hans, radiant with sudden joy,\n\"good-night--you will excuse me, I must go.\nBirmingham--Higgs--Higgs--Birmingham,\" and seizing his hat from his\nmother, and his skates from Gretel, he rushed from the cottage.\n\nWhat could the boys think, but that the entire Brinker family had\nsuddenly gone crazy!\n\nThey bade an embarrassed \"good-evening,\" and turned to go. But Raff\nstopped them.\n\n\"This Thomas Higgs, young masters, is a--a person.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Peter, quite sure that Raff was the most crazy of all.\n\n\"Yes--a person--a--ahem!--a friend. We thought him dead. I hope it is\nthe same man. In England, did you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, Birmingham,\" answered Peter; \"it must be Birmingham in England.\"\n\n\"I know the man,\" said Ben, addressing Lambert. \"His factory is not four\nmiles from our place--a queer fellow--still as an oyster--don't seem at\nall like an Englishman. I've often seen him--a solemn-looking chap, with\nmagnificent eyes. He made a beautiful writing-case once for me to give\nJenny on her birthday--makes pocketbooks, telescope-cases, and all\nkinds of leather work.\"\n\nAs this was said in English, Van Mounen of course translated it for the\nbenefit of all concerned, noticing meanwhile that neither Raff nor his\nvrouw looked very miserable though Raff was trembling, and the dame's\neyes were swimming with tears.\n\nYou may believe the doctor heard every word of the story, when later in\nthe evening he came driving back with Hans. \"The three young gentlemen\nhad been gone sometime,\" Dame Brinker said, \"but like enough, by\nhurrying, it would be easy to find them coming out from the Lecture,\nwherever that was.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Raff, nodding his head, \"the vrouw always hits upon the\nright thing. It would be well to see the young English gentleman,\nmynheer, before he forgets all about Thomas Higgs--it's a slippery name,\nd'ye see?--one can't hold it safe a minute. It come upon me sudden and\nstrong as a pile-driver, and my boy writ it down. Aye, mynheer, I'd\nhaste to talk with the English lad; he's seen your son many a time--only\nto think on't!\"\n\nDame Brinker took up the thread of the discourse.\n\n\"You'll pick out the lad quick enough, mynheer, because he's in company\nwith Master Peter van Holp; and his hair curls all up over his forehead\nlike foreign folk's, and, if you hear him speak, he talks kind of big\nand fast, only it's English; but that wouldn't be any hindrance to your\nhonor.\"\n\nThe doctor had already lifted his hat to go. With a beaming face, he\nmuttered something about its being just like the young scamp to give\nhimself a rascally English name; called Hans \"my son\"--thereby making\nthat young gentleman happy as a lord--and left the cottage with very\nlittle ceremony, considering what a great meester he was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe grumbling coachman comforted himself by speaking his mind, as he\ndrove back to Amsterdam. Since the doctor was safely stowed away in the\ncoach, and could not hear a word, it was a fine time to say terrible\nthings of folks who hadn't no manner of feeling for nobody, and who were\nalways wanting the horses a dozen times of a night.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI\n\nMYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF THOMAS HIGGS\n\n\nHiggs' factory was a mine of delight for the gossips of Birmingham. It\nwas a small building, but quite large enough to hold a mystery. Who the\nproprietor was, or where he came from, none could tell. He looked like a\ngentleman--that was certain--though everybody knew he had risen from an\napprenticeship; and he could handle his pen like a writing-master.\n\nYears ago he had suddenly appeared in the place a lad of\neighteen--learned his trade faithfully, and risen in the confidence of\nhis employer--been taken in as a partner soon after his time was\nup--and, finally, when old Willett died, had assumed the business on his\nown hands. This was all that was known of his affairs.\n\nIt was a common remark among some of the good people that he never had a\nword to say to a Christian soul; while others declared that though he\nspoke beautiful, when he chose to, there was something wrong in his\naccent. A tidy man, too, they called him, all but for having that\nscandalous green pond alongside of his factory, which wasn't deep enough\nfor an eel, and was \"just a fever-nest, as sure as you live.\"\n\nHis nationality was a great puzzle. The English name spoke plain enough\nfor _one_ side of his house, but of what manner of nation was his\nmother? If she'd been an American, he'd certain have had high\ncheek-bones and reddish skin; if a German, he would have known the\nlanguage, and Squire Smith declared he didn't; if French (and his\nhaving that frog-pond made it seem likely) it would come out in his\nspeech. No--there was nothing he could be but Dutch. And strangest of\nall, though the man always pricked up his ears when you talked of\nHolland, he didn't seem to know the first thing about the country when\nyou put him to the point.\n\nAnyhow, as no letters ever came to him from his mother's family in\nHolland, and as nobody living had ever seen old Higgs, the family\ncouldn't be anything much. Probably Thomas Higgs himself was no better\nthan he should be, for all he pretended to carry himself so straight;\nand for their parts, the gossips declared, they were not going to\ntrouble their heads about him. Consequently Thomas Higgs and his affairs\nwere never-failing subjects of discussion.\n\nPicture, then, the consternation, among all the good people when it was\nannounced by \"somebody who was there and ought to know,\" that the\npost-boy had that very morning handed Higgs a foreign-looking letter,\nand the man had \"turned as white as the wall; rushed to his factory,\ntalked a bit with one of the head work-men, and without bidding a\ncreature good-bye, was off bag and baggage before you could wink,\nma'am.\" Mistress Scrubbs, his landlady, was in deep affliction. The dear\nsoul became quite out of breath while speaking of him--\"to leave\nlodgin's in that suddent way, without never so much as a day's warnin'\nwhich was what every woman who didn't wish to be trodden underfoot,\nwhich thank Hevving wasn't _her_ way, had a perfect right to expect;\nyes, and a week's warnin' now you mention it, and without even so much\nas sayin' many thanks to you, Mistress Scrubbs, for all past kindnesses\nwhich was most numerous though she said it who shouldn't say it;\nleastwise she wasn't never no kind of a person to be lookin' for thanks\nevery minnit--it was really scanderlous, though to be sure Mister 'iggs\npaid up everythin' to the last farthin' and it fairly brought tears to\nher eyes to see his dear empty boots lyin' there in the corner of his\nroom, which alone showed trouble of mind for he always stood 'em up\nstraight as solgers though bein' half-soled twice they hadn't of course\nbeen worth takin' away.\"\n\nWhereupon her dearest friend, Miss Scrumpkins, ran home to tell all\nabout it. And, as everybody knew the Scrumpkinses, a shining gossamer of\nnews was soon woven from one end of the street to the other.\n\nAn investigating committee met, that evening, at Mrs.\nSnigham's--sitting, in secret session, over her best china. Though\ninvited only to a quiet \"tea,\" the amount of judicial business they\ntransacted on the occasion was prodigious. The biscuits were actually\ncold before the committee had a chance to eat anything. There was so\nmuch to talk over--and it was so important that it should be firmly\nestablished that each member had always been \"certain sure that\nsomething extraordinary would be happening to that man yet,\" that it was\nnear eight o'clock before Mrs. Snigham gave anybody a second cup.\n\n\n\n\nXLVII\n\nBROAD SUNSHINE\n\n\nOne snowy day in January, Laurens Boekman went with his father to pay\nhis respects to the Brinker family.\n\nRaff was resting after the labors of the day; Gretel, having filled and\nlighted his pipe, was brushing every speck of ash from the hearth; the\ndame was spinning; and Hans, perched upon a stool by the window, was\ndiligently studying his lessons--A peaceful, happy household whose main\nexcitement during the past week had been the looking forward to this\npossible visit from Thomas Higgs.\n\nAs soon as the grand presentation was over, Dame Brinker insisted upon\ngiving her guests some hot tea; it was enough to freeze any one, she\nsaid, to be out in such crazy, blustering weather. While they were\ntalking with her husband she whispered to Gretel that the young\ngentleman's eyes and her boy's were certainly as much alike as four\nbeans, to say nothing of a way they both had of looking as if they were\nstupid and yet knew as much as a body's grandfather.\n\nGretel was disappointed. She had looked forward to a tragic scene, such\nas Annie Bouman had often described to her, from story books; and here\nwas the gentleman who came so near being a murderer, who for ten years\nhad been wandering over the face of the earth, who had believed himself\ndeserted and scorned by his father--the very young gentleman who had\nfled from his country in such magnificent trouble, sitting by the fire\njust as pleasant and natural as could be!\n\nTo be sure his voice had trembled when he talked with her parents, and\nhe had met his father's look with a bright kind of smile that would have\nsuited a dragon-killer bringing the waters of perpetual youth to his\nking--but after all he wasn't at all like the conquered hero in Annie's\nbook. He did not say, lifting his hand toward Heaven, \"I hereby swear to\nbe forever faithful to my home, my God and my country!\" which would have\nbeen only right and proper under the circumstances.\n\nAll things considered, Gretel was disappointed. Raff, however, was\nperfectly satisfied. The message was delivered; Dr. Boekman had his son\nsafe and sound; and the poor lad had done nothing sinful after all,\nexcept in thinking his father would have abandoned him for an accident.\nTo be sure, the graceful stripling had become rather a heavy man--Raff\nhad unconsciously hoped to clasp that same boyish hand again--but all\nthings were changed to Raff, for that matter. So he pushed back every\nfeeling but joy, as he saw father and son sitting side by side at his\nhearthstone. Meantime, Hans was wholly occupied in the thought of Thomas\nHiggs' happiness in being able to be the meester's assistant again; and\nDame Brinker was sighing softly to herself, wishing that the lad's\nmother were alive to see him--such a fine young gentleman as he was; and\nwondering how Dr. Boekman could bear to see the silver watch getting so\ndull. He had worn it ever since Raff handed it over, that was evident.\nWhat had he done with the gold one he used to wear?\n\nThe light was shining full upon Dr. Boekman's face. How contented he\nlooked; how much younger and brighter than formerly. The hard lines were\nquite melting away. He was laughing, as he said to the father:\n\n\"Am I not a happy man, Raff Brinker? My son will sell out his factory\nthis month, and open a warehouse in Amsterdam. I shall have all my\nspectacle-cases for nothing.\"\n\nHans started from his reverie. \"A warehouse, mynheer! and will Thomas\nHiggs--I mean--is your son not to be your assistant again?\"\n\nA shade passed over the meester's face, but he brightened with an\neffort, as he replied:\n\n\"Oh no, Laurens has had quite enough of that. He wishes to be a\nmerchant.\"\n\nHans appeared so surprised and disappointed that his friend asked\ngood-naturedly:\n\n\"Why so silent, boy? Is it any disgrace to be a merchant?\"\n\n\"N--not a disgrace, mynheer,\" stammered Hans--\"but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Why, the other calling is so much better,\" answered Hans, \"so much\nnobler. I think, mynheer,\" he added, kindling with enthusiasm, \"that to\nbe a surgeon,--to cure the sick and crippled, to save human life, to be\nable to do what you have done for my father--is the grandest thing on\nearth.\"\n\nThe doctor was regarding him sternly. Hans felt rebuked. His cheeks were\nflushed; hot tears were gathering under his lashes.\n\n\"It is an ugly business, boy, this surgery,\" said the doctor, still\nfrowning at Hans; \"it requires great patience, self-denial and\nperseverance.\"\n\n\"I am sure it does,\" cried Hans, kindling again. \"It calls for wisdom\ntoo, and a reverence for God's work. Ah, mynheer, it may have its trials\nand drawbacks--but you do not mean what you say--it is great and noble,\nnot ugly! Pardon me, mynheer. It is not for me to speak so boldly.\"\n\nDr. Boekman was evidently displeased. He turned his back on the boy, and\nconferred aside with Laurens. Meanwhile the dame scowled a terrible\nwarning at Hans. These great people, she knew well enough, never like to\nhear poor folk speak up so pert.\n\nThe meester turned around.\n\n\"How old are you, Hans Brinker?\"\n\n\"Fifteen, mynheer,\" was the startled reply.\n\n\"Would you like to become a physician?\"\n\n\"Yes, mynheer,\" answered Hans, quivering with excitement.\n\n\"Would you be willing, with your parents' consent, to devote yourself to\nstudy, to go to the University--and, in time, be a student in my\noffice?\"\n\n\"YES, mynheer.\"\n\n\"You would not grow restless, think you, and change your mind just as I\nhad set my heart upon preparing you to be my successor?\"\n\nHans' eyes flashed.\n\n\"No, mynheer, I would not change.\"\n\n\"You may believe him, there,\" cried the dame, who could remain quiet no\nlonger. \"Hans is like a rock, when once he decides; and as for study,\nmynheer, the child has almost grown fast to his books of late. He can\njumble off Latin already, like any priest!\"\n\nThe doctor smiled. \"Well, Hans, I see nothing to prevent us from\ncarrying out this plan, if your father agrees.\"\n\n\"Ahem,\" said Raff, too proud of his boy to be very meek, \"the fact is,\nmynheer, I prefer an active, out-of-door life, myself. But if the lad's\ninclined to study for a meester, and he'd have the benefit of your good\nword to push him on in the world, it's all one to me. The money's all\nthat's a wanting, but it mightn't be long, with two strong pair of arms\nto earn it, before we----\"\n\n\"Tut! tut!\" interrupted the doctor, \"if I take your right hand man away,\nI must pay the cost, and glad enough will I be to do it. It will be like\nhaving _two_ sons--eh, Laurens? One a merchant and the other a\nsurgeon--I shall be the happiest man in Holland! Come to me in the\nmorning, Hans, and we will arrange matters at once.\"\n\nHans bowed assent. He dared not trust himself to speak.\n\n\"And, Brinker,\" continued the doctor, \"my son Laurens will need a\ntrusty, ready man like you, when he opens his warehouse in Amsterdam;\nsome one to overlook matters, and see that the lazy clowns round about\nthe place do their duty. Some one to----Why don't you tell him yourself,\nyou rascal!\"\n\nThis last was addressed to the son, and did not sound half as fierce as\nit looks in print. The rascal and Raff soon understood each other\nperfectly.\n\n\"I'm loath to leave the dykes,\" said the latter, after they had talked\ntogether a while, \"but you have made me such a good offer, mynheer, I'd\nbe robbing my family if I let it go past me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTake a long look at Hans as he sits there staring gratefully at the\nmeester, for you shall not see him again for many years.\n\nAnd Gretel--Ah, what a vista of puzzling work suddenly opens before her!\nYes, for dear Hans' sake she will study now. If he really is to be a\nmeester, his sister must not shame his greatness.\n\nHow faithfully those glancing eyes shall yet seek for the jewels that\nlie hidden in rocky school-books! And how they shall yet brighten and\ndroop at the coming of one whom she knows of now, only as the boy who\nwore a red cap on that wonderful day when she found the Silver Skates in\nher apron!\n\nBut the doctor and Laurens are going. Dame Brinker is making her best\ncurtsey. Raff stands beside her, looking every inch a man as he grasps\nthe meester's hand. Through the open cottage door we can look out upon\nthe level Dutch landscape all alive with the falling snow.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOur story is nearly told. Time passes in Holland just as surely and\nsteadily as here; in that respect no country is odd.\n\nTo the Brinker family it has brought great changes. Hans has spent the\nyears faithfully and profitably, conquering obstacles as they arose, and\npursuing one object with all the energy of his nature. If often the way\nhas been rugged, his resolution has never failed. Sometimes he echoes,\nwith his good old friend, the words said long ago in that little cottage\nnear Broek: \"Surgery is an ugly business;\" but always in his heart of\nhearts lingers the echo of those truer words, \"It is great and noble! it\nawakes a reverence for God's work!\"\n\nWere you in Amsterdam to-day, you might see the famous Dr. Brinker\nriding in his grand coach to visit his patients; or, it might be, you\nwould see him skating with his own boys and girls upon the frozen canal.\nFor Annie Bouman, the beautiful, frank-hearted peasant girl, you would\ninquire in vain; but Annie Brinker, the vrouw of the great physician, is\nvery like her--only, as Hans says, she is even lovelier, wiser, more\nlike a fairy godmother than ever.\n\nPeter van Holp, also, is a married man. I could have told you before,\nthat he and Hilda would join hands and glide through life together, just\nas years ago, they skimmed side by side over the frozen, sunlit river.\n\nAt one time, I came near hinting that Katrinka and Carl would join\nhands. It is fortunate now that the report was not started, for Katrinka\nchanged her mind, and is single to this day. The lady is not quite so\nmerry as formerly, and, I grieve to say, some of the tinkling bells are\nout of tune. But she is the life of her social circle, still. I wish she\nwould be in earnest, just for a little while, but no; it is not her\nnature. Her cares and sorrows do nothing more than disturb the tinkling;\nthey never waken any deeper music.\n\nRychie's soul has been stirred to its depths during these long years.\nHer history would tell how seed carelessly sown is sometimes reaped in\nanguish, and how a golden harvest may follow a painful planting. If I\nmistake not, you may be able to read the written record before long;\nthat is, if you are familiar with the Dutch language. In the witty, but\nearnest author whose words are welcomed at this day, in thousands of\nHolland homes, few could recognize the haughty, flippant Rychie who\nscoffed at little Gretel.\n\nLambert van Mounen, and Ludwig van Holp, are good Christian men, and,\nwhat is more easily to be seen at a glance, thriving citizens. Both are\ndwellers in Amsterdam, but one clings to the old city of that name, and\nthe other is a pilgrim to the new. Van Mounen's present home is not far\nfrom the Central Park, and he says if the New Yorkers do their duty, the\nPark will, in time, equal his beautiful Bosch, near the Hague. He often\nthinks of the Katrinka of his boyhood, but he is glad now that Katrinka,\nthe woman, sent him away; though it seemed at the time his darkest hour.\nBen's sister Jennie has made him very happy, happier than he could have\nbeen with any one else in the wide world.\n\nCarl Schummel has had a hard life. His father met with reverses in\nbusiness; and as Carl had not many warm friends, and above all, was not\nsustained by noble principles, he has been tossed about by Fortune's\nbattle-dore until his gayest feathers are nearly all knocked off. He is\na bookkeeper, in the thriving Amsterdam house of Boekman and\nSchimmelpenninck. Voostenwalbert, the junior partner, treats him kindly;\nand he, in turn, is very respectful to the \"monkey with a long name for\na tail.\"\n\nOf all our group of Holland friends, Jacob Poot is the only one who has\npassed away. Good-natured, true-hearted and unselfish to the last, he is\nmourned now, as heartily as he was loved and laughed at while on earth.\nHe grew to be very thin before he died; thinner than Benjamin Dobbs, who\nis now portliest among the portly.\n\nRaff Brinker and his vrouw have been living comfortably in Amsterdam for\nmany years--a faithful, happy pair; as simple and straightforward in\ntheir good fortune as they were patient and trustful in darker days.\nThey have a zommerhuis near the old cottage and thither they often\nrepair with their children and grandchildren on the pleasant summer\nafternoons when the pond-lilies rear their queenly heads above the\nwater.\n\nThe story of Hans Brinker would be but half told, if we did not leave\nhim with Gretel standing near. Dear, quick, patient little Gretel! What\nis she now? Ask old Dr. Boekman, he will declare she is the finest\nsinger, the loveliest woman in Amsterdam; ask Hans and Annie, they will\nassure you she is the dearest sister ever known; ask her husband, he\nwill tell you she is the brightest, sweetest little wife in Holland; ask\nDame Brinker and Raff, their eyes will glisten with joyous tears; ask\nthe poor, the air will be filled with blessings.\n\nBut, lest you forget a tiny form trembling and sobbing on the mound\nbefore the Brinker cottage, ask the Van Glecks; they will never weary\ntelling of the darling little girl who won The Silver Skates.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Hans Brinker, by Mary Mapes Dodge\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HANS BRINKER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 34378-8.txt or 34378-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/4\/3\/7\/34378\/\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Josephine Paolucci and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":240,"split":"train"}
