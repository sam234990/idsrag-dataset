Prospero and 1,000 other nobles have taken refuge in this walled abbey to escape the Red Death, a terrible plague with gruesome symptoms that has swept over the land. Victims are overcome by \"sharp pains\", \"sudden dizziness\", and hematidrosis, and die within half an hour. Prospero and his court are indifferent to the sufferings of the population at large; they intend to await the end of the plague in luxury and safety behind the walls of their secure refuge, having welded the doors shut.\nOne night, Prospero holds a masquerade ball to entertain his guests in seven colored rooms of the abbey. Each of the first six rooms is decorated and illuminated in a specific color: blue, purple, green, orange, white, and violet. The last room is decorated in black and is illuminated by a scarlet light, \"a deep blood color\" cast from its stained glass windows. Because of this chilling pairing of colors, very few guests are brave enough to venture into the seventh room. A large ebony clock stands in this room and ominously chimes each hour, upon which everyone stops talking or dancing and the orchestra stops playing. Once the chiming stops, everyone immediately resumes the masquerade.\nAt the chiming of midnight, the revelers and Prospero notice a figure in a dark, blood-splattered robe resembling a funeral shroud. The figure's mask resembles the rigid face of a corpse and exhibits the traits of the Red Death. Gravely insulted, Prospero demands to know the identity of the mysterious guest so they can hang him. The guests, too afraid to approach the figure, instead let him pass through the six chambers. The Prince pursues him with a drawn dagger and corners the guest in the seventh room. When the figure turns to face him, the Prince lets out a sharp cry and falls dead. The enraged and terrified revelers surge into the black room and forcibly remove the mask and robe, only to find to their horror that there is nothing underneath. Only then do they realize the figure is the Red Death itself, and all of the guests contract and succumb to the disease. The final line of the story sums up, \"And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Masque of the Red Death, by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

No pestilence had\never been so fatal, or so hideous.  Blood was its Avatar and its\nseal--the redness and the horror of blood.  There were sharp pains, and\nsudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with\ndissolution.  The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the\nface of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid\nand from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure,\nprogress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an\nhour.\n\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his\ndominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand\nhale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his\ncourt, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his\ncastellated abbeys.  This was an extensive and magnificent structure,\nthe creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste.  A strong\nand lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron.  The\ncourtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and\nwelded the bolts.  They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor\negress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within.  The\nabbey was amply provisioned.  With such precautions the courtiers might\nbid defiance to contagion.  The external world could take care of\nitself.  In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think.  The\nprince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.  There were\nbuffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there\nwere musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.  All these and\nsecurity were within.  Without was the \"Red Death\".\n\nIt was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,\nand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince\nProspero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\nunusual magnificence.\n\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade.  But first let me tell of\nthe rooms in which it was held.  These were seven--an imperial suite.\nIn many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista,\nwhile the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand,\nso that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.  Here the\ncase was very different, as might have been expected from the duke's\nlove of the _bizarre_.  The apartments were so irregularly disposed that\nthe vision embraced but little more than one at a time.  There was a\nsharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel\neffect.  To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and\nnarrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued\nthe windings of the suite.  These windows were of stained glass whose\ncolour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations\nof the chamber into which it opened.  That at the eastern extremity was\nhung, for example in blue--and vividly blue were its windows.  The\nsecond chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the\npanes were purple.  The third was green throughout, and so were the\ncasements.  The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth\nwith white--the sixth with violet.  The seventh apartment was closely\nshrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and\ndown the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same\nmaterial and hue.  But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows\nfailed to correspond with the decorations.  The panes here were\nscarlet--a deep blood colour.  Now in no one of the seven apartments\nwas there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden\nornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.\nThere was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the\nsuite of chambers.  But in the corridors that followed the suite, there\nstood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of\nfire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly\nillumined the room.  And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and\nfantastic appearances.  But in the western or black chamber the effect\nof the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the\nblood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a\nlook upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of\nthe company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\n\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western\nwall, a gigantic clock of ebony.  Its pendulum swung to and fro with a\ndull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the\ncircuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from\nthe brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep\nand exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that,\nat each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were\nconstrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to\nthe sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and\nthere was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\nchimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew\npale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows\nas if in confused revery or meditation.  But when the echoes had fully\nceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians\nlooked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and\nfolly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next\nchiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and\nthen, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand\nand six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another\nchiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and\ntremulousness and meditation as before.\n\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.  The\ntastes of the duke were peculiar.  He had a fine eye for colours and\neffects.  He disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion.  His plans were\nbold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre.  There\nare some who would have thought him mad.  His followers felt that he\nwas not.  It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_\nthat he was not.\n\nHe had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven\nchambers, upon occasion of this great _f\u00c3\u00aate_; and it was his own guiding\ntaste which had given character to the masqueraders.  Be sure they were\ngrotesque.  There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and\nphantasm--much of what has been since seen in \"Hernani\".  There were\narabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments.  There were\ndelirious fancies such as the madman fashions.  There were much of the\nbeautiful, much of the wanton, much of the _bizarre_, something of the\nterrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.\nTo and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of\ndreams.  And these--the dreams--writhed in and about taking hue from\nthe rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the\necho of their steps.  And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which\nstands in the hall of the velvet.  And then, for a moment, all is\nstill, and all is silent save the voice of the clock.  The dreams are\nstiff-frozen as they stand.  But the echoes of the chime die away--they\nhave endured but an instant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats\nafter them as they depart.  And now again the music swells, and the\ndreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue\nfrom the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the\ntripods.  But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven,\nthere are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning\naway; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes;\nand the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot\nfalls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a\nmuffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches _their_ ears\nwho indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.\n\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\nfeverishly the heart of life.  And the revel went whirlingly on, until\nat length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.  And\nthen the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the\nwaltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things\nas before.  But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell\nof the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought\ncrept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among\nthose who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the\nlast echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were\nmany individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of\nthe presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no\nsingle individual before.  And the rumour of this new presence having\nspread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole\ncompany a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and\nsurprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.\n\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be\nsupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.\nIn truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but\nthe figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the\nbounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the\nhearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.\nEven with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests,\nthere are matters of which no jest can be made.  The whole company,\nindeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of\nthe stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.  The figure was tall\nand gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the\ngrave.  The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to\nresemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest\nscrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.  And yet all\nthis might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers\naround.  But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the\nRed Death. His vesture was dabbled in _blood_--and his broad brow, with\nall the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\n\nWhen the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image\n(which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain\nits  role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be\nconvulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror\nor distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\n\n\"Who dares,\"--he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\nhim--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and\nunmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the\nbattlements!\"\n\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince\nProspero as he uttered these words.  They rang throughout the seven\nrooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and\nthe music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.\n\nIt was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of  pale\ncourtiers by his side.  At first, as he spoke, there was a slight\nrushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at\nthe moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately\nstep, made closer approach to the speaker.  But from a certain nameless\nawe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole\nparty, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,\nunimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while\nthe vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of\nthe rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the\nsame solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the\nfirst, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to\nthe green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the\nwhite--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been\nmade to arrest him.  It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,\nmaddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice,\nrushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on\naccount of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.  He bore aloft a\ndrawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three\nor four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained\nthe extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted\nhis pursuer.  There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming\nupon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate\nin death the Prince Prospero.  Then, summoning the wild courage of\ndespair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the\nblack apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect\nand motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in\nunutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask,\nwhich they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any\ntangible form.\n\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.  He had come\nlike a thief in the night.  And one by one dropped the revellers in the\nblood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\nposture of his fall.  And the life of the ebony clock went out with\nthat of the last of the gay.  And the flames of the tripods expired.\nAnd Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over\nall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Masque of the Red Death, by Edgar Allan Poe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1064-8.txt or 1064-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/6\/1064\/\n\nProduced by Levent Kurnaz.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":439,"split":"train"}
