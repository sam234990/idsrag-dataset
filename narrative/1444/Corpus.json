Well, not such a very bad, but a pretty\nbad boy; and I ought to know, for I am, or rather I was, that boy\nmyself.\n\nLest the title should mislead the reader, I hasten to assure him here\nthat I have no dark confessions to make. I call my story the story of\na bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young\ngentlemen who generally figure in narratives of this kind, and partly\nbecause I really was not a cherub. I may truthfully say I was an\namiable, impulsive lad, blessed with fine digestive powers, and no\nhypocrite. I didn't want to be an angel and with the angels stand; I\ndidn't think the missionary tracts presented to me by the Rev. Wibird\nHawkins were half so nice as Robinson Crusoe; and I didn't send my\nlittle pocket-money to the natives of the Feejee Islands, but spent\nit royally in peppermint-drops and taffy candy. In short, I was a real\nhuman boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England, and no more\nlike the impossible boy in a storybook than a sound orange is like one\nthat has been sucked dry. But let us begin at the beginning.\n\nWhenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to confront him at\nrecess with the following words: \"My name's Tom Bailey; what's your\nname?\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new\npupil cordially; but if it didn't, I would turn on my heel, for I was\nparticular on this point. Such names as Higgins, Wiggins, and Spriggins\nwere deadly affronts to my ear; while Langdon, Wallace, Blake, and the\nlike, were passwords to my confidence and esteem.\n\nAh me! some of those dear fellows are rather elderly boys by this\ntime--lawyers, merchants, sea-captains, soldiers, authors, what not? Phil\nAdams (a special good name that Adams) is consul at Shanghai, where I\npicture him to myself with his head closely shaved--he never had too much\nhair--and a long pigtail banging down behind. He is married, I hear;\nand I hope he and she that was Miss Wang Wang are very happy together,\nsitting cross-legged over their diminutive cups of tea in a skyblue\ntower hung with bells. It is so I think of him; to me he is henceforth\na jewelled mandarin, talking nothing but broken China. Whitcomb is a\njudge, sedate and wise, with spectacles balanced on the bridge of that\nremarkable nose which, in former days, was so plentifully sprinkled with\nfreckles that the boys christened him Pepper Whitcomb. Just to think\nof little Pepper Whitcomb being a judge! What would he do to me now, I\nwonder, if I were to sing out \"Pepper!\" some day in court? Fred Langdon\nis in California, in the native-wine business--he used to make the best\nlicorice-water I ever tasted! Binny Wallace sleeps in the Old South\nBurying-Ground; and Jack Harris, too, is dead--Harris, who commanded us\nboys, of old, in the famous snow-ball battles of Slatter's Hill. Was it\nyesterday I saw him at the head of his regiment on its way to join the\nshattered Army of the Potomac? Not yesterday, but six years ago. It was\nat the battle of the Seven Pines. Gallant Jack Harris, that never drew\nrein until he had dashed into the Rebel battery! So they found him--lying\nacross the enemy's guns.\n\nHow we have parted, and wandered, and married, and died! I wonder what\nhas become of all the boys who went to the Temple Grammar School at\nRivermouth when I was a youngster? \"All, all are gone, the old familiar\nfaces!\"\n\nIt is with no ungentle hand I summon them back, for a moment, from that\nPast which has closed upon them and upon me. How pleasantly they live\nagain in my memory! Happy, magical Past, in whose fairy atmosphere even\nConway, mine ancient foe, stands forth transfigured, with a sort of\ndreamy glory encircling his bright red hair!\n\nWith the old school formula I commence these sketches of my boyhood. My\nname is Tom Bailey; what is yours, gentle reader? I take for granted\nit is neither Wiggins nor Spriggins, and that we shall get on famously\ntogether, and be capital friends forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two--In Which I Entertain Peculiar Views\n\n\nI was born at Rivermouth, but, before I had a chance to become very well\nacquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents removed to New\nOrleans, where my father invested his money so securely in the banking\nbusiness that he was never able to get any of it out again. But of this\nhereafter.\n\nI was only eighteen months old at the time of the removal, and it didn't\nmake much difference to me where I was, because I was so small; but\nseveral years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be\neducated, I had my own peculiar views on the subject. I instantly kicked\nover the little Negro boy who happened to be standing by me at the\nmoment, and, stamping my foot violently on the floor of the piazza,\ndeclared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees!\n\nYou see I was what is called \"a Northern man with Southern principles.\"\nI had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were\nconnected with the South, with Aunt Chloe, my old Negro nurse, and\nwith the great ill-kept garden in the centre of which stood our house--a\nwhitewashed stone house it was, with wide verandas--shut out from the\nstreet by lines of orange, fig, and magnolia trees. I knew I was born\nat the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I looked upon the\nmisfortune as something so shrouded by time and distance that maybe\nnobody remembered it. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee,\nbecause they talked about the Yankees in such a scornful way it made\nme feel that it was quite a disgrace not to be born in Louisiana, or at\nleast in one of the Border States. And this impression was strengthened\nby Aunt Chloe, who said, \"dar wasn't no gentl'men in the Norf no way,\"\nand on one occasion terrified me beyond measure by declaring that,\n\"if any of dem mean whites tried to git her away from marster, she was\njes'gwine to knock 'em on de head wid a gourd!\"\n\nThe way this poor creature's eyes flashed, and the tragic air with which\nshe struck at an imaginary \"mean white,\" are among the most vivid things\nin my memory of those days.\n\nTo be frank, my idea of the North was about as accurate as that\nentertained by the well-educated Englishmen of the present day\nconcerning America. I supposed the inhabitants were divided into two\nclasses--Indians and white people; that the Indians occasionally dashed\ndown on New York, and scalped any woman or child (giving the preference\nto children) whom they caught lingering in the outskirts after\nnightfall; that the white men were either hunters or schoolmasters, and\nthat it was winter pretty much all the year round. The prevailing style\nof architecture I took to be log-cabins.\n\nWith this delightful picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the\nreader will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being\ntransported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for\nkicking over little black Sam, and otherwise misconducting myself, when\nmy father announced his determination to me. As for kicking little Sam--I\nalways did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me.\n\nMy father was greatly perplexed and troubled by this unusually violent\noutbreak, and especially by the real consternation which he saw written\nin every line of my countenance. As little black Sam picked himself up,\nmy father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library.\n\nI can see him now as he leaned back in the bamboo chair and questioned\nme. He appeared strangely agitated on learning the nature of my\nobjections to going North, and proceeded at once to knock down all my\npine log houses, and scatter all the Indian tribes with which I had\npopulated the greater portion of the Eastern and Middle States.\n\n\"Who on earth, Tom, has filled your brain with such silly stories?\"\nasked my father, wiping the tears from his eyes.\n\n\"Aunt Chloe, sir; she told me.\"\n\n\"And you really thought your grandfather wore a blanket embroidered with\nbeads, and ornamented his leggins with the scalps of his enemies?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I didn't think that exactly.\"\n\n\"Didn't think that exactly? Tom, you will be the death of me.\"\n\nHe hid his face in his handkerchief, and, when he looked up, he seemed\nto have been suffering acutely. I was deeply moved myself, though I did\nnot clearly understand what I had said or done to cause him to feel so\nbadly. Perhaps I had hurt his feelings by thinking it even possible that\nGrandfather Nutter was an Indian warrior.\n\nMy father devoted that evening and several subsequent evenings to giving\nme a clear and succinct account of New England; its early struggles, its\nprogress, and its present condition--faint and confused glimmerings\nof all which I had obtained at school, where history had never been a\nfavorite pursuit of mine.\n\nI was no longer unwilling to go North; on the contrary, the proposed\njourney to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights. I promised\nmyself all sorts of fun and adventures, though I was not entirely at\nrest in my mind touching the savages, and secretly resolved to go on\nboard the ship--the journey was to be made by sea--with a certain little\nbrass pistol in my trousers-pocket, in case of any difficulty with the\ntribes when we landed at Boston.\n\nI couldn't get the Indian out of my head. Only a short time previously\nthe Cherokees--or was it the Camanches?--had been removed from their\nhunting-grounds in Arkansas; and in the wilds of the Southwest the red\nmen were still a source of terror to the border settlers. \"Trouble\nwith the Indians\" was the staple news from Florida published in the New\nOrleans papers. We were constantly hearing of travellers being attacked\nand murdered in the interior of that State. If these things were done in\nFlorida, why not in Massachusetts?\n\nYet long before the sailing day arrived I was eager to be off. My\nimpatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me\na fine little Mustang pony, and shipped it to Rivermouth a fortnight\nprevious to the date set for our own departure--for both my parents were\nto accompany me. The pony (which nearly kicked me out of bed one night\nin a dream), and my father's promise that he and my mother would come to\nRivermouth every other summer, completely resigned me to the situation.\nThe pony's name was Gitana, which is the Spanish for gypsy; so I always\ncalled her--she was a lady pony--Gypsy.\n\nAt length the time came to leave the vine-covered mansion among the\norange-trees, to say goodby to little black Sam (I am convinced he was\nheartily glad to get rid of me), and to part with simple Aunt Chloe,\nwho, in the confusion of her grief, kissed an eyelash into my eye, and\nthen buried her face in the bright bandana turban which she had mounted\nthat morning in honor of our departure.\n\nI fancy them standing by the open garden gate; the tears are rolling\ndown Aunt Chloe's cheeks; Sam's six front teeth are glistening like\npearls; I wave my hand to him manfully then I call out \"goodby\" in a\nmuffled voice to Aunt Chloe; they and the old home fade away. I am never\nto see them again!\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three--On Board the Typhoon\n\n\nI do not remember much about the voyage to Boston, for after the first\nfew hours at sea I was dreadfully unwell.\n\nThe name of our ship was the \"A No. 1, fast-sailing packet Typhoon.\"\nI learned afterwards that she sailed fast only in the newspaper\nadvertisements. My father owned one quarter of the Typhoon, and that is\nwhy we happened to go in her. I tried to guess which quarter of the ship\nhe owned, and finally concluded it must be the hind quarter--the cabin,\nin which we had the cosiest of state-rooms, with one round window in the\nroof, and two shelves or boxes nailed up against the wall to sleep in.\n\nThere was a good deal of confusion on deck while we were getting under\nway. The captain shouted orders (to which nobody seemed to pay any\nattention) through a battered tin trumpet, and grew so red in the face\nthat he reminded me of a scooped-out pumpkin with a lighted candle\ninside. He swore right and left at the sailors without the slightest\nregard for their feelings. They didn't mind it a bit, however, but went\non singing--\n\n     \"Heave ho!\n     With the rum below,\n     And hurrah for the Spanish Main O!\"\n\nI will not be positive about \"the Spanish Main,\" but it was hurrah for\nsomething O. I considered them very jolly fellows, and so indeed they\nwere. One weather-beaten tar in particular struck my fancy--a thick-set,\njovial man, about fifty years of age, with twinkling blue eyes and a\nfringe of gray hair circling his head like a crown. As he took off his\ntarpaulin I observed that the top of his head was quite smooth and flat,\nas if somebody had sat down on him when he was very young.\n\nThere was something noticeably hearty in this man's bronzed face, a\nheartiness that seemed to extend to his loosely knotted neckerchief. But\nwhat completely won my good-will was a picture of enviable loveliness\npainted on his left arm. It was the head of a woman with the body of a\nfish. Her flowing hair was of livid green, and she held a pink comb in\none hand. I never saw anything so beautiful. I determined to know that\nman. I think I would have given my brass pistol to have had such a\npicture painted on my arm.\n\nWhile I stood admiring this work of art, a fat wheezy steamtug, with\nthe word AJAX in staring black letters on the paddlebox, came puffing up\nalongside the Typhoon. It was ridiculously small and conceited, compared\nwith our stately ship. I speculated as to what it was going to do. In a\nfew minutes we were lashed to the little monster, which gave a snort and\na shriek, and commenced backing us out from the levee (wharf) with the\ngreatest ease.\n\nI once saw an ant running away with a piece of cheese eight or ten times\nlarger than itself. I could not help thinking of it, when I found the\nchubby, smoky-nosed tug-boat towing the Typhoon out into the Mississippi\nRiver.\n\nIn the middle of the stream we swung round, the current caught us, and\naway we flew like a great winged bird. Only it didn't seem as if we were\nmoving. The shore, with the countless steamboats, the tangled rigging of\nthe ships, and the long lines of warehouses, appeared to be gliding away\nfrom us.\n\nIt was grand sport to stand on the quarter-deck and watch all this.\nBefore long there was nothing to be seen on other side but stretches of\nlow swampy land, covered with stunted cypress trees, from which drooped\ndelicate streamers of Spanish moss--a fine place for alligators and Congo\nsnakes. Here and there we passed a yellow sand-bar, and here and there a\nsnag lifted its nose out of the water like a shark.\n\n\"This is your last chance to see the city, To see the city, Tom,\" said\nmy father, as we swept round a bend of the river.\n\nI turned and looked. New Orleans was just a colorless mass of something\nin the distance, and the dome of the St. Charles Hotel, upon which\nthe sun shimmered for a moment, was no bigger than the top of old Aunt\nChloe's thimble.\n\nWhat do I remember next? The gray sky and the fretful blue waters of the\nGulf. The steam-tug had long since let slip her hawsers and gone panting\naway with a derisive scream, as much as to say, \"I've done my duty, now\nlook out for yourself, old Typhoon!\"\n\nThe ship seemed quite proud of being left to take care of itself, and,\nwith its huge white sails bulged out, strutted off like a vain turkey.\nI had been standing by my father near the wheel-house all this while,\nobserving things with that nicety of perception which belongs only\nto children; but now the dew began falling, and we went below to have\nsupper.\n\nThe fresh fruit and milk, and the slices of cold chicken, looked very\nnice; yet somehow I had no appetite There was a general smell of tar\nabout everything. Then the ship gave sudden lurches that made it a\nmatter of uncertainty whether one was going to put his fork to his mouth\nor into his eye. The tumblers and wineglasses, stuck in a rack over the\ntable, kept clinking and clinking; and the cabin lamp, suspended by four\ngilt chains from the ceiling, swayed to and fro crazily. Now the floor\nseemed to rise, and now it seemed to sink under one's feet like a\nfeather-bed.\n\nThere were not more than a dozen passengers on board, including\nourselves; and all of these, excepting a bald-headed old gentleman--a\nretired sea-captain--disappeared into their staterooms at an early hour\nof the evening.\n\nAfter supper was cleared away, my father and the elderly gentleman,\nwhose name was Captain Truck, played at checkers; and I amused myself\nfor a while by watching the trouble they had in keeping the men in the\nproper places. Just at the most exciting point of the game, the ship\nwould careen, and down would go the white checkers pell-mell among the\nblack. Then my father laughed, but Captain Truck would grow very angry,\nand vow that he would have won the game in a move or two more, if\nthe confounded old chicken-coop--that's what he called the ship--hadn't\nlurched.\n\n\"I--I think I will go to bed now, please,\" I said, laying my band on my\nfather's knee, and feeling exceedingly queer.\n\nIt was high time, for the Typhoon was plunging about in the most\nalarming fashion. I was speedily tucked away in the upper berth, where\nI felt a trifle more easy at first. My clothes were placed on a narrow\nshelf at my feet, and it was a great comfort to me to know that my\npistol was so handy, for I made no doubt we should fall in with\nPirates before many hours. This is the last thing I remember with any\ndistinctness. At midnight, as I was afterwards told, we were struck by\na gale which never left us until we came in sight of the Massachusetts\ncoast.\n\nFor days and days I had no sensible idea of what was going on around me.\nThat we were being hurled somewhere upside-down, and that I didn't like\nit, was about all I knew. I have, indeed, a vague impression that my\nfather used to climb up to the berth and call me his \"Ancient Mariner,\"\nbidding me cheer up. But the Ancient Mariner was far from cheering up,\nif I recollect rightly; and I don't believe that venerable navigator\nwould have cared much if it had been announced to him, through a\nspeaking-trumpet, that \"a low, black, suspicious craft, with raking\nmasts, was rapidly bearing down upon us!\"\n\nIn fact, one morning, I thought that such was the case, for bang! went\nthe big cannon I had noticed in the bow of the ship when we came on\nboard, and which had suggested to me the idea of Pirates. Bang! went\nthe gun again in a few seconds. I made a feeble effort to get at my\ntrousers-pocket! But the Typhoon was only saluting Cape Cod--the\nfirst land sighted by vessels approaching the coast from a southerly\ndirection.\n\nThe vessel had ceased to roll, and my sea-sickness passed away as\nrapidly as it came. I was all right now, \"only a little shaky in my\ntimbers and a little blue about the gills,\" as Captain Truck remarked to\nmy mother, who, like myself, had been confined to the state-room during\nthe passage.\n\nAt Cape Cod the wind parted company with us without saying as much\nas \"Excuse me\"; so we were nearly two days in making the run which in\nfavorable weather is usually accomplished in seven hours. That's what\nthe pilot said.\n\nI was able to go about the ship now, and I lost no time in cultivating\nthe acquaintance of the sailor with the green-haired lady on his arm.\nI found him in the forecastle--a sort of cellar in the front part of the\nvessel. He was an agreeable sailor, as I had expected, and we became the\nbest of friends in five minutes.\n\nHe had been all over the world two or three times, and knew no end of\nstories. According to his own account, he must have been shipwrecked\nat least twice a year ever since his birth. He had served under Decatur\nwhen that gallant officer peppered the Algerines and made them promise\nnot to sell their prisoners of war into slavery; he had worked a gun\nat the bombardment of Vera Cruz in the Mexican War, and he had been on\nAlexander Selkirk's Island more than once. There were very few things he\nhadn't done in a seafaring way.\n\n\"I suppose, sir,\" I remarked, \"that your name isn't Typhoon?\"\n\n\"Why, Lord love ye, lad, my name's Benjamin Watson, of Nantucket. But\nI'm a true blue Typhooner,\" he added, which increased my respect for\nhim; I don't know why, and I didn't know then whether Typhoon was the\nname of a vegetable or a profession.\n\nNot wishing to be outdone in frankness, I disclosed to him that my name\nwas Tom Bailey, upon which he said he was very glad to hear it.\n\nWhen we got more intimate, I discovered that Sailor Ben, as he wished\nme to call him, was a perfect walking picturebook. He had two anchors, a\nstar, and a frigate in full sail on his right arm; a pair of lovely blue\nhands clasped on his breast, and I've no doubt that other parts of his\nbody were illustrated in the same agreeable manner. I imagine he was\nfond of drawings, and took this means of gratifying his artistic taste.\nIt was certainly very ingenious and convenient. A portfolio might\nbe misplaced, or dropped overboard; but Sailor Ben had his pictures\nwherever he went, just as that eminent person in the poem,\n\n\"With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes\"--was accompanied by\nmusic on all occasions.\n\nThe two bands on his breast, he informed me, were a tribute to the\nmemory of a dead messmate from whom he had parted years ago--and surely a\nmore touching tribute was never engraved on a tombstone. This caused me\nto think of my parting with old Aunt Chloe, and I told him I should take\nit as a great favor indeed if he would paint a pink hand and a black\nhand on my chest. He said the colors were pricked into the skin with\nneedles, and that the operation was somewhat painful. I assured him, in\nan off-hand manner, that I didn't mind pain, and begged him to set to\nwork at once.\n\nThe simple-hearted fellow, who was probably not a little vain of his\nskill, took me into the forecastle, and was on the point of complying\nwith my request, when my father happened to own the gangway--a\ncircumstance that rather interfered with the decorative art.\n\nI didn't have another opportunity of conferring alone with Sailor Ben,\nfor the next morning, bright and early, we came in sight of the cupola\nof the Boston State House.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four--Rivermouth\n\n\nIt was a beautiful May morning when the Typhoon hauled up at Long Wharf.\nWhether the Indians were not early risers, or whether they were away\njust then on a war-path, I couldn't determine; but they did not appear\nin any great force--in fact, did not appear at all.\n\nIn the remarkable geography which I never hurt myself with studying\nat New Orleans, was a picture representing the landing of the Pilgrim\nFathers at Plymouth. The Pilgrim Fathers, in rather odd hats and coats,\nare seen approaching the savages; the savages, in no coats or hats\nto speak of, are evidently undecided whether to shake hands with the\nPilgrim Fathers or to make one grand rush and scalp the entire party.\nNow this scene had so stamped itself on my mind, that, in spite of\nall my father had said, I was prepared for some such greeting from\nthe aborigines. Nevertheless, I was not sorry to have my expectations\nunfulfilled. By the way, speaking of the Pilgrim Fathers, I often used\nto wonder why there was no mention made of the Pilgrim Mothers.\n\nWhile our trunks were being hoisted from the hold of the ship, I mounted\non the roof of the cabin, and took a critical view of Boston. As we came\nup the harbor, I had noticed that the houses were huddled together on an\nimmense bill, at the top of which was a large building, the State House,\ntowering proudly above the rest, like an amiable mother-hen surrounded\nby her brood of many-colored chickens. A closer inspection did not\nimpress me very favorably. The city was not nearly so imposing as New\nOrleans, which stretches out for miles and miles, in the shape of a\ncrescent, along the banks of the majestic river.\n\nI soon grew tired of looking at the masses of houses, rising above one\nanother in irregular tiers, and was glad my father did not propose\nto remain long in Boston. As I leaned over the rail in this mood, a\nmeasly-looking little boy with no shoes said that if I would come down\non the wharf he'd lick me for two cents--not an exorbitant price. But I\ndidn't go down. I climbed into the rigging, and stared at him. This, as\nI was rejoiced to observe, so exasperated him that he stood on his head\non a pile of boards, in order to pacify himself.\n\nThe first train for Rivermouth left at noon. After a late breakfast\non board the Typhoon, our trunks were piled upon a baggage-wagon, and\nourselves stowed away in a coach, which must have turned at least one\nhundred corners before it set us down at the railway station.\n\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, we were shooting across the\ncountry at a fearful rate--now clattering over a bridge, now screaming\nthrough a tunnel; here we cut a flourishing village in two, like a\nknife, and here we dived into the shadow of a pine forest. Sometimes\nwe glided along the edge of the ocean, and could see the sails of ships\ntwinkling like bits of silver against the horizon; sometimes we dashed\nacross rocky pasture-lands where stupid-eyed cattle were loafing. It was\nfun to scare lazy-looking cows that lay round in groups under the newly\nbudded trees near the railroad track.\n\nWe did not pause at any of the little brown stations on the route (they\nlooked just like overgrown black-walnut clocks), though at every one of\nthem a man popped out as if he were worked by machinery, and waved a red\nflag, and appeared as though he would like to have us stop. But we were\nan express train, and made no stoppages, excepting once or twice to give\nthe engine a drink. It is strange how the memory clings to some things.\nIt is over twenty years since I took that first ride to Rivermouth,\nand yet, oddly enough, I remember as if it were yesterday, that, as we\npassed slowly through the village of Hampton, we saw two boys fighting\nbehind a red barn. There was also a shaggy yellow dog, who looked as\nif he had commenced to unravel, barking himself all up into a knot with\nexcitement. We had only a hurried glimpse of the battle--long enough,\nhowever, to see that the combatants were equally matched and very much\nin earnest. I am ashamed to say how many times since I have speculated\nas to which boy got licked. Maybe both the small rascals are dead now\n(not in consequence of the set-to, let us hope), or maybe they are\nmarried, and have pugnacious urchins of their own; yet to this day I\nsometimes find myself wondering how that fight turned out.\n\nWe had been riding perhaps two hours and a half, when we shot by a tall\nfactory with a chimney resembling a church steeple; then the locomotive\ngave a scream, the engineer rang his bell, and we plunged into the\ntwilight of a long wooden building, open at both ends. Here we stopped,\nand the conductor, thrusting his head in at the car door, cried out,\n\"Passengers for Rivermouth!\"\n\nAt last we had reached our journey's end. On the platform my father\nshook hands with a straight, brisk old gentleman whose face was very\nserene and rosy. He had on a white hat and a long swallow-tailed coat,\nthe collar of which came clear up above his cars. He didn't look unlike\na Pilgrim Father. This, of course, was Grandfather Nutter, at whose\nhouse I was born. My mother kissed him a great many times; and I was\nglad to see him myself, though I naturally did not feel very intimate\nwith a person whom I had not seen since I was eighteen months old.\n\nWhile we were getting into the double-seated wagon which Grandfather\nNutter had provided, I took the opportunity of asking after the health\nof the pony. The pony had arrived all right ten days before, and was in\nthe stable at home, quite anxious to see me.\n\nAs we drove through the quiet old town, I thought Rivermouth the\nprettiest place in the world; and I think so still. The streets are long\nand wide, shaded by gigantic American elms, whose drooping branches,\ninterlacing here and there, span the avenues with arches graceful\nenough to be the handiwork of fairies. Many of the houses have small\nflower-gardens in front, gay in the season with china-asters, and are\nsubstantially built, with massive chimney-stacks and protruding eaves.\nA beautiful river goes rippling by the town, and, after turning and\ntwisting among a lot of tiny islands, empties itself into the sea.\n\nThe harbor is so fine that the largest ships can sail directly up to\nthe wharves and drop anchor. Only they don't. Years ago it was a famous\nseaport. Princely fortunes were made in the West India trade; and in\n1812, when we were at war with Great Britain, any number of privateers\nwere fitted out at Rivermouth to prey upon the merchant vessels of the\nenemy. Certain people grew suddenly and mysteriously rich. A great many\nof \"the first families\" of today do not care to trace their pedigree\nback to the time when their grandsires owned shares in the Matilda Jane,\ntwenty-four guns. Well, well!\n\nFew ships come to Rivermouth now. Commerce drifted into other ports. The\nphantom fleet sailed off one day, and never came back again. The crazy\nold warehouses are empty; and barnacles and eel-grass cling to the piles\nof the crumbling wharves, where the sunshine lies lovingly, bringing\nout the faint spicy odor that haunts the place--the ghost of the old dead\nWest India trade! During our ride from the station, I was struck, of\ncourse, only by the general neatness of the houses and the beauty of\nthe elm-trees lining the streets. I describe Rivermouth now as I came to\nknow it afterwards.\n\nRivermouth is a very ancient town. In my day there existed a tradition\namong the boys that it was here Christopher Columbus made his first\nlanding on this continent. I remember having the exact spot pointed out\nto me by Pepper Whitcomb! One thing is certain, Captain John Smith, who\nafterwards, according to the legend, married Pocahontas--whereby he got\nPowhatan for a father-in-law-explored the river in 1614, and was much\ncharmed by the beauty of Rivermouth, which at that time was covered with\nwild strawberry-vines.\n\nRivermouth figures prominently in all the colonial histories. Every\nother house in the place has its tradition more or less grim and\nentertaining. If ghosts could flourish anywhere, there are certain\nstreets in Rivermouth that would be full of them. I don't know of a town\nwith so many old houses. Let us linger, for a moment, in front of the\none which the Oldest Inhabitant is always sure to point out to the\ncurious stranger.\n\nIt is a square wooden edifice, with gambrel roof and deep-set\nwindow-frames. Over the windows and doors there used to be heavy\ncarvings--oak-leaves and acorns, and angels' heads with wings spreading\nfrom the ears, oddly jumbled together; but these ornaments and other\noutward signs of grandeur have long since disappeared. A peculiar\ninterest attaches itself to this house, not because of its age, for\nit has not been standing quite a century; nor on account of its\narchitecture, which is not striking--but because of the illustrious men\nwho at various periods have occupied its spacious chambers.\n\nIn 1770 it was an aristocratic hotel. At the left side of the entrance\nstood a high post, from which swung the sign of the Earl of Halifax. The\nlandlord was a stanch loyalist--that is to say, he believed in the king,\nand when the overtaxed colonies determined to throw off the British\nyoke, the adherents to the Crown held private meetings in one of the\nback rooms of the tavern. This irritated the rebels, as they were\ncalled; and one night they made an attack on the Earl of Halifax, tore\ndown the signboard, broke in the window-sashes, and gave the landlord\nhardly time to make himself invisible over a fence in the rear.\n\nFor several months the shattered tavern remained deserted. At last the\nexiled innkeeper, on promising to do better, was allowed to return; a\nnew sign, bearing the name of William Pitt, the friend of America, swung\nproudly from the door-post, and the patriots were appeased. Here it was\nthat the mail-coach from Boston twice a week, for many a year, set\ndown its load of travelers and gossip. For some of the details in this\nsketch, I am indebted to a recently published chronicle of those times.\n\nIt is 1782. The French fleet is lying in the harbor of Rivermouth, and\neight of the principal officers, in white uniforms trimmed with gold\nlace, have taken up their quarters at the sign of the William Pitt. Who\nis this young and handsome officer now entering the door of the tavern?\nIt is no less a personage than the Marquis Lafayette, who has come all\nthe way from Providence to visit the French gentlemen boarding there.\nWhat a gallant-looking cavalier he is, with his quick eyes and coal\nblack hair! Forty years later he visited the spot again; his locks were\ngray and his step was feeble, but his heart held its young love for\nLiberty.\n\nWho is this finely dressed traveler alighting from his coach-and-four,\nattended by servants in livery? Do you know that sounding name, written\nin big valorous letters on the Declaration of Independence--written as\nif by the hand of a giant? Can you not see it now? JOHN HANCOCK. This is\nhe.\n\nThree young men, with their valet, are standing on the doorstep of the\nWilliam Pitt, bowing politely, and inquiring in the most courteous terms\nin the world if they can be accommodated. It is the time of the French\nRevolution, and these are three sons of the Duke of Orleans--Louis\nPhilippe and his two brothers. Louis Philippe never forgot his visit\nto Rivermouth. Years afterwards, when he was seated on the throne of\nFrance, he asked an American lady, who chanced to be at his court, if\nthe pleasant old mansion were still standing.\n\nBut a greater and a better man than the king of the French has honored\nthis roof. Here, in 1789, came George Washington, the President of\nthe United States, to pay his final complimentary visit to the State\ndignitaries. The wainscoted chamber where he slept, and the dining-hall\nwhere he entertained his guests, have a certain dignity and sanctity\nwhich even the present Irish tenants cannot wholly destroy.\n\nDuring the period of my reign at Rivermouth, an ancient lady, Dame\nJocelyn by name, lived in one of the upper rooms of this notable\nbuilding. She was a dashing young belle at the time of Washington's\nfirst visit to the town, and must have been exceedingly coquettish and\npretty, judging from a certain portrait on ivory still in the possession\nof the family. According to Dame Jocelyn, George Washington flirted with\nher just a little bit--in what a stately and highly finished manner can\nbe imagined.\n\nThere was a mirror with a deep filigreed frame hanging over the\nmantel-piece in this room. The glass was cracked and the quicksilver\nrubbed off or discolored in many places. When it reflected your face\nyou had the singular pleasure of not recognizing yourself. It gave your\nfeatures the appearance of having been run through a mince-meat machine.\nBut what rendered the looking-glass a thing of enchantment to me was a\nfaded green feather, tipped with scarlet, which drooped from the top\nof the tarnished gilt mouldings. This feather Washington took from the\nplume of his three-cornered hat, and presented with his own hand to the\nworshipful Mistress Jocelyn the day he left Rivermouth forever. I wish\nI could describe the mincing genteel air, and the ill-concealed\nself-complacency, with which the dear old lady related the incident.\n\nMany a Saturday afternoon have I climbed up the rickety staircase to\nthat dingy room, which always had a flavor of snuff about it, to sit\non a stiff-backed chair and listen for hours together to Dame Jocelyn's\nstories of the olden time. How she would prattle! She was bedridden--poor\ncreature!--and had not been out of the chamber for fourteen years.\nMeanwhile the world had shot ahead of Dame Jocelyn. The changes that had\ntaken place under her very nose were unknown to this faded, crooning old\ngentlewoman, whom the eighteenth century had neglected to take away with\nthe rest of its odd traps. She had no patience with newfangled notions.\nThe old ways and the old times were good enough for her. She had never\nseen a steam engine, though she had heard \"the dratted thing\" screech in\nthe distance. In her day, when gentlefolk traveled, they went in\ntheir own coaches. She didn't see how respectable people could bring\nthemselves down to \"riding in a car with rag-tag and bobtail and\nLord-knows-who.\" Poor old aristocrat The landlord charged her no rent\nfor the room, and the neighbors took turns in supplying her with meals.\nTowards the close of her life--she lived to be ninety-nine--she grew very\nfretful and capricious about her food. If she didn't chance to fancy\nwhat was sent her, she had no hesitation in sending it back to the giver\nwith \"Miss Jocelyn's respectful compliments.\"\n\nBut I have been gossiping too long--and yet not too long if I have\nimpressed upon the reader an idea of what a rusty, delightful old town\nit was to which I had come to spend the next three or four years of my\nboyhood.\n\nA drive of twenty minutes from the station brought us to the door-step\nof Grandfather Nutter's house. What kind of house it was, and what sort\nof people lived in it, shall be told in another chapter.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five--The Nutter House and the Nutter Family\n\n\nThe Nutter House--all the more prominent dwellings in Rivermouth are\nnamed after somebody; for instance, there is the Walford House, the\nVenner House, the Trefethen House, etc., though it by no means follows\nthat they are inhabited by the people whose names they bear--the Nutter\nHouse, to resume, has been in our family nearly a hundred years, and\nis an honor to the builder (an ancestor of ours, I believe), supposing\ndurability to be a merit. If our ancestor was a carpenter, he knew his\ntrade. I wish I knew mine as well. Such timber and such workmanship\ndon't often come together in houses built nowadays.\n\nImagine a low-studded structure, with a wide hall running through the\nmiddle. At your right band, as you enter, stands a tall black mahogany\nclock, looking like an Egyptian mummy set up on end. On each side of\nthe hall are doors (whose knobs, it must be confessed, do not turn very\neasily), opening into large rooms wainscoted and rich in wood-carvings\nabout the mantel-pieces and cornices. The walls are covered with\npictured paper, representing landscapes and sea-views. In the parlor,\nfor example, this enlivening figure is repeated all over the room. A\ngroup of English peasants, wearing Italian hats, are dancing on a lawn\nthat abruptly resolves itself into a sea-beach, upon which stands a\nflabby fisherman (nationality unknown), quietly hauling in what appears\nto be a small whale, and totally regardless of the dreadful naval combat\ngoing on just beyond the end of his fishing-rod. On the other side of\nthe ships is the main-land again, with the same peasants dancing.\nOur ancestors were very worthy people, but their wall-papers were\nabominable.\n\nThere are neither grates nor stoves in these quaint chambers, but\nsplendid open chimney-places, with room enough for the corpulent\nback-log to turn over comfortably on the polished andirons. A wide\nstaircase leads from the hall to the second story, which is arranged\nmuch like the first. Over this is the garret. I needn't tell a\nNew England boy what--a museum of curiosities is the garret of a\nwell-regulated New England house of fifty or sixty years' standing.\nHere meet together, as if by some preconcerted arrangement, all the\nbroken-down chairs of the household, all the spavined tables, all\nthe seedy hats, all the intoxicated-looking boots, all the split\nwalking-sticks that have retired from business, \"weary with the march of\nlife.\" The pots, the pans, the trunks, the bottles--who may hope to\nmake an inventory of the numberless odds and ends collected in this\nbewildering lumber-room? But what a place it is to sit of an afternoon\nwith the rain pattering on the roof! What a place in which to read\nGulliver's Travels, or the famous adventures of Rinaldo Rinaldini!\n\nMy grandfather's house stood a little back from the main street, in\nthe shadow of two handsome elms, whose overgrown boughs would dash\nthemselves against the gables whenever the wind blew hard. In the rear\nwas a pleasant garden, covering perhaps a quarter of an acre, full of\nplum-trees and gooseberry bushes. These trees were old settlers, and are\nall dead now, excepting one, which bears a purple plum as big as an egg.\nThis tree, as I remark, is still standing, and a more beautiful tree\nto tumble out of never grew anywhere. In the northwestern corner of the\ngarden were the stables and carriage-house opening upon a narrow lane.\nYou may imagine that I made an early visit to that locality to inspect\nGypsy. Indeed, I paid her a visit every half-hour during the first day\nof my arrival. At the twenty-fourth visit she trod on my foot rather\nheavily, as a reminder, probably, that I was wearing out my welcome. She\nwas a knowing little pony, that Gypsy, and I shall have much to say of\nher in the course of these pages.\n\nGypsy's quarters were all that could be wished, but nothing among my new\nsurroundings gave me more satisfaction than the cosey sleeping apartment\nthat had been prepared for myself. It was the hall room over the front\ndoor.\n\nI had never had a chamber all to myself before, and this one, about\ntwice the size of our state-room on board the Typhoon, was a marvel of\nneatness and comfort. Pretty chintz curtains hung at the window, and a\npatch quilt of more colors than were in Joseph's coat covered the little\ntruckle-bed. The pattern of the wall-paper left nothing to be desired in\nthat line. On a gray background were small bunches of leaves, unlike\nany that ever grew in this world; and on every other bunch perched a\nyellow-bird, pitted with crimson spots, as if it had just recovered from\na severe attack of the small-pox. That no such bird ever existed did\nnot detract from my admiration of each one. There were two hundred and\nsixty-eight of these birds in all, not counting those split in two where\nthe paper was badly joined. I counted them once when I was laid up with\na fine black eye, and falling asleep immediately dreamed that the whole\nflock suddenly took wing and flew out of the window. From that time I\nwas never able to regard them as merely inanimate objects.\n\nA wash-stand in the corner, a chest of carved mahogany drawers, a\nlooking-glass in a filigreed frame, and a high-backed chair studded with\nbrass nails like a coffin, constituted the furniture. Over the head of\nthe bed were two oak shelves, holding perhaps a dozen books--among which\nwere Theodore, or The Peruvians; Robinson Crusoe; an odd volume of\nTristram Shandy; Baxter's Saints' Rest, and a fine English edition of\nthe Arabian Nights, with six hundred wood-cuts by Harvey.\n\nShall I ever forget the hour when I first overhauled these books? I do\nnot allude especially to Baxter's Saints' Rest, which is far from being\na lively work for the young, but to the Arabian Nights, and particularly\nRobinson Crusoe. The thrill that ran into my fingers' ends then has not\nrun out yet. Many a time did I steal up to this nest of a room,\nand, taking the dog's-eared volume from its shelf, glide off into an\nenchanted realm, where there were no lessons to get and no boys to\nsmash my kite. In a lidless trunk in the garret I subsequently unearthed\nanother motley collection of novels and romances, embracing the\nadventures of Baron Trenck, Jack Sheppard, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and\nCharlotte Temple--all of which I fed upon like a bookworm.\n\nI never come across a copy of any of those works without feeling a\ncertain tenderness for the yellow-haired little rascal who used to lean\nabove the magic pages hour after hour, religiously believing every word\nhe read, and no more doubting the reality of Sindbad the Sailor, or the\nKnight of the Sorrowful Countenance, than he did the existence of his\nown grandfather.\n\nAgainst the wall at the foot of the bed hung a single-barrel\nshot-gun--placed there by Grandfather Nutter, who knew what a boy\nloved, if ever a grandfather did. As the trigger of the gun had been\naccidentally twisted off, it was not, perhaps, the most dangerous weapon\nthat could be placed in the hands of youth. In this maimed condition\nits \"bump of destructiveness\" was much less than that of my small brass\npocket-pistol, which I at once proceeded to suspend from one of the\nnails supporting the fowling-piece, for my vagaries concerning the red\nman had been entirely dispelled.\n\nHaving introduced the reader to the Nutter House, a presentation to the\nNutter family naturally follows. The family consisted of my\ngrandfather; his sister, Miss Abigail Nutter; and Kitty Collins, the\nmaid-of-all-work.\n\nGrandfather Nutter was a hale, cheery old gentleman, as straight and as\nbald as an arrow. He had been a sailor in early life; that is to say, at\nthe age of ten years he fled from the multiplication-table, and ran away\nto sea. A single voyage satisfied him. There never was but one of our\nfamily who didn't run away to sea, and this one died at his birth. My\ngrandfather had also been a soldier--a captain of militia in 1812. If I\nowe the British nation anything, I owe thanks to that particular British\nsoldier who put a musket-ball into the fleshy part of Captain Nutter's\nleg, causing that noble warrior a slight permanent limp, but offsetting\nthe injury by furnishing him with the material for a story which the old\ngentleman was never weary of telling and I never weary of listening to.\nThe story, in brief, was as follows.\n\nAt the breaking out of the war, an English frigate lay for several days\noff the coast near Rivermouth. A strong fort defended the harbor, and a\nregiment of minute-men, scattered at various points along-shore, stood\nready to repel the boats, should the enemy try to effect a landing.\nCaptain Nutter had charge of a slight earthwork just outside the mouth\nof the river. Late one thick night the sound of oars was heard; the\nsentinel tried to fire off his gun at half-cock, and couldn't, when\nCaptain Nutter sprung upon the parapet in the pitch darkness, and\nshouted, \"Boat ahoyl\" A musket-shot immediately embedded itself in the\ncalf of his leg. The Captain tumbled into the fort and the boat, which\nhad probably come in search of water, pulled back to the frigate.\n\nThis was my grandfather's only exploit during the war. That his prompt\nand bold conduct was instrumental in teaching the enemy the hopelessness\nof attempting to conquer such a people was among the firm beliefs of my\nboyhood.\n\nAt the time I came to Rivermouth my grandfather had retired from active\npursuits, and was living at ease on his money, invested principally\nin shipping. He had been a widower many years; a maiden sister, the\naforesaid Miss Abigail, managing his household. Miss Abigail also\nmanaged her brother, and her brother's servant, and the visitor at her\nbrother's gate--not in a tyrannical spirit, but from a philanthropic\ndesire to be useful to everybody. In person she was tall and angular;\nshe had a gray complexion, gray eyes, gray eyebrows, and generally wore\na gray dress. Her strongest weak point was a belief in the efficacy of\n\"hot-drops\" as a cure for all known diseases.\n\nIf there were ever two people who seemed to dislike each other, Miss\nAbigail and Kitty Collins were those people. If ever two people really\nloved each other, Miss Abigail and Kitty Collins were those people also.\nThey were always either skirmishing or having a cup of tea lovingly\ntogether.\n\nMiss Abigail was very fond of me, and so was Kitty; and in the course of\ntheir disagreements each let me into the private history of the other.\n\nAccording to Kitty, it was not originally my grandfather's intention\nto have Miss Abigail at the head of his domestic establishment. She had\nswooped down on him (Kitty's own words), with a band-box in one hand and\na faded blue cotton umbrella, still in existence, in the other. Clad\nin this singular garb--I do not remember that Kitty alluded to--any\nadditional peculiarity of dress--Miss Abigail had made her appearance at\nthe door of the Nutter House on the morning of my grandmother's funeral.\nThe small amount of baggage which the lady brought with her would have\nled the superficial observer to infer that Miss Abigail's visit was\nlimited to a few days. I run ahead of my story in saying she remained\nseventeen years! How much longer she would have remained can never be\ndefinitely known now, as she died at the expiration of that period.\n\nWhether or not my grandfather was quite pleased by this unlooked-for\naddition to his family is a problem. He was very kind always to Miss\nAbigail, and seldom opposed her; though I think she must have tried his\npatience sometimes, especially when she interfered with Kitty.\n\nKitty Collins, or Mrs. Catherine, as she preferred to be called,\nwas descended in a direct line from an extensive family of kings who\nformerly ruled over Ireland. In consequence of various calamities,\namong which the failure of the potato-crop may be mentioned, Miss\nKitty Collins, in company with several hundred of her countrymen and\ncountrywomen--also descended from kings--came over to America in an\nemigrant ship, in the year eighteen hundred and something.\n\nI don't know what freak of fortune caused the royal exile to turn up\nat Rivermouth; but turn up she did, a few months after arriving in this\ncountry, and was hired by my grandmother to do \"general housework\" for\nthe sum of four shillings and six-pence a week.\n\nKitty had been living about seven years in my grandfather's family when\nshe unburdened her heart of a secret which had been weighing upon it all\nthat time. It may be said of people, as it is said of nations, \"Happy\nare they that have no history.\" Kitty had a history, and a pathetic one,\nI think.\n\nOn board the emigrant ship that brought her to America, she became\nacquainted with a sailor, who, being touched by Kitty's forlorn\ncondition, was very good to her. Long before the end of the voyage,\nwhich had been tedious and perilous, she was heartbroken at the thought\nof separating from her kindly protector; but they were not to part just\nyet, for the sailor returned Kitty's affection, and the two were married\non their arrival at port. Kitty's husband--she would never mention his\nname, but kept it locked in her bosom like some precious relic--had a\nconsiderable sum of money when the crew were paid off; and the young\ncouple--for Kitty was young then--lived very happily in a lodging-house on\nSouth Street, near the docks. This was in New York.\n\nThe days flew by like hours, and the stocking in which the little bride\nkept the funds shrunk and shrunk, until at last there were only three\nor four dollars left in the toe of it. Then Kitty was troubled; for\nshe knew her sailor would have to go to sea again unless he could\nget employment on shore. This he endeavored to do, but not with much\nsuccess. One morning as usual he kissed her good day, and set out in\nsearch of work.\n\n\"Kissed me goodby, and called me his little Irish lass,\" sobbed Kitty,\ntelling the story, \"kissed me goodby, and, Heaven help me, I niver set\noi on him nor on the likes of him again!\"\n\nHe never came back. Day after day dragged on, night after night, and\nthen the weary weeks. What had become of him? Had he been murdered? Had\nhe fallen into the docks? Had he--deserted her? No! She could not believe\nthat; he was too brave and tender and true. She couldn't believe that.\nHe was dead, dead, or he'd come back to her.\n\nMeanwhile the landlord of the lodging-house turned Kitty into the\nstreets, now that \"her man\" was gone, and the payment of the rent\ndoubtful. She got a place as a servant. The family she lived with\nshortly moved to Boston, and she accompanied them; then they went\nabroad, but Kitty would not leave America. Somehow she drifted to\nRivermouth, and for seven long years never gave speech to her sorrow,\nuntil the kindness of strangers, who had become friends to her, unsealed\nthe heroic lips.\n\nKitty's story, you may be sure, made my grandparents treat her more\nkindly than ever. In time she grew to be regarded less as a servant than\nas a friend in the home circle, sharing its joys and sorrows--a faithful\nnurse, a willing slave, a happy spirit in spite of all. I fancy I hear\nher singing over her work in the kitchen, pausing from time to time to\nmake some witty reply to Miss Abigail--for Kitty, like all her race, had\na vein of unconscious humor. Her bright honest face comes to me out from\nthe past, the light and life of the Nutter House when I was a boy at\nRivermouth.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six--Lights and Shadows\n\n\nThe first shadow that fell upon me in my new home was caused by the\nreturn of my parents to New Orleans. Their visit was cut short by\nbusiness which required my father's presence in Natchez, where he was\nestablishing a branch of the bankinghouse. When they had gone, a sense\nof loneliness such as I had never dreamed of filled my young breast.\nI crept away to the stable, and, throwing my arms about Gypsy's neck,\nsobbed aloud. She too had come from the sunny South, and was now a\nstranger in a strange land.\n\nThe little mare seemed to realize our situation, and gave me all the\nsympathy I could ask, repeatedly rubbing her soft nose over my face and\nlapping up my salt tears with evident relish.\n\nWhen night came, I felt still more lonesome. My grandfather sat in\nhis arm-chair the greater part of the evening, reading the Rivermouth\nBamacle, the local newspaper. There was no gas in those days, and the\nCaptain read by the aid of a small block-tin lamp, which he held in one\nhand. I observed that he had a habit of dropping off into a doze every\nthree or four minutes, and I forgot my homesickness at intervals in\nwatching him. Two or three times, to my vast amusement, he scorched the\nedges of the newspaper with the wick of the lamp; and at about half\npast eight o'clock I had the satisfactions--I am sorry to confess it was a\nsatisfaction--of seeing the Rivermouth Barnacle in flames.\n\nMy grandfather leisurely extinguished the fire with his hands, and Miss\nAbigail, who sat near a low table, knitting by the light of an astral\nlamp, did not even look up. She was quite used to this catastrophe.\n\nThere was little or no conversation during the evening. In fact, I do\nnot remember that anyone spoke at all, excepting once, when the Captain\nremarked, in a meditative manner, that my parents \"must have reached New\nYork by this time\"; at which supposition I nearly strangled myself in\nattempting to intercept a sob.\n\nThe monotonous \"click click\" of Miss Abigail's needles made me nervous\nafter a while, and finally drove me out of the sitting-room into the\nkitchen, where Kitty caused me to laugh by saying Miss Abigail thought\nthat what I needed was \"a good dose of hot-drops,\" a remedy she was\nforever ready to administer in all emergencies. If a boy broke his\nleg, or lost his mother, I believe Miss Abigail would have given him\nhot-drops.\n\nKitty laid herself out to be entertaining. She told me several funny\nIrish stories, and described some of the odd people living in the town;\nbut, in the midst of her comicalities, the tears would involuntarily\nooze out of my eyes, though I was not a lad much addicted to weeping.\nThen Kitty would put her arms around me, and tell me not to mind it--that\nit wasn't as if I had been left alone in a foreign land with no one to\ncare for me, like a poor girl whom she had once known. I brightened up\nbefore long, and told Kitty all about the Typhoon and the old seaman,\nwhose name I tried in vain to recall, and was obliged to fall back on\nplain Sailor Ben.\n\nI was glad when ten o'clock came, the bedtime for young folks, and old\nfolks too, at the Nutter House. Alone in the hallchamber I had my cry\nout, once for all, moistening the pillow to such an extent that I was\nobliged to turn it over to find a dry spot to go to sleep on.\n\nMy grandfather wisely concluded to put me to school at once. If I had\nbeen permitted to go mooning about the house and stables, I should have\nkept my discontent alive for months. The next morning, accordingly, he\ntook me by the hand, and we set forth for the academy, which was located\nat the farther end of the town.\n\nThe Temple School was a two-story brick building, standing in the centre\nof a great square piece of land, surrounded by a high picket fence.\nThere were three or four sickly trees, but no grass, in this enclosure,\nwhich had been worn smooth and hard by the tread of multitudinous feet.\nI noticed here and there small holes scooped in the ground, indicating\nthat it was the season for marbles. A better playground for baseball\ncouldn't have been devised.\n\nOn reaching the schoolhouse door, the Captain inquired for Mr. Grimshaw.\nThe boy who answered our knock ushered us into a side-room, and in a\nfew minutes--during which my eye took in forty-two caps hung on forty-two\nwooden pegs--Mr. Grimshaw made his appearance. He was a slender man, with\nwhite, fragile hands, and eyes that glanced half a dozen different ways\nat once--a habit probably acquired from watching the boys.\n\nAfter a brief consultation, my grandfather patted me on the head and\nleft me in charge of this gentleman, who seated himself in front of\nme and proceeded to sound the depth, or, more properly speaking, the\nshallowness, of my attainments. I suspect my historical information\nrather startled him. I recollect I gave him to understand that Richard\nIII was the last king of England.\n\nThis ordeal over, Mr. Grimshaw rose and bade me follow him. A door\nopened, and I stood in the blaze of forty-two pairs of upturned eyes.\nI was a cool hand for my age, but I lacked the boldness to face this\nbattery without wincing. In a sort of dazed way I stumbled after Mr.\nGrimshaw down a narrow aisle between two rows of desks, and shyly took\nthe seat pointed out to me.\n\nThe faint buzz that had floated over the school-room at our entrance\ndied away, and the interrupted lessons were resumed. By degrees I\nrecovered my coolness, and ventured to look around me.\n\nThe owners of the forty-two caps were seated at small green desks like\nthe one assigned to me. The desks were arranged in six rows, with spaces\nbetween just wide enough to prevent the boys' whispering. A blackboard\nset into the wall extended clear across the end of the room; on a raised\nplatform near the door stood the master's table; and directly in front\nof this was a recitation-bench capable of seating fifteen or twenty\npupils. A pair of globes, tattooed with dragons and winged horses,\noccupied a shelf between two windows, which were so high from the floor\nthat nothing but a giraffe could have looked out of them.\n\nHaving possessed myself of these details, I scrutinized my new\nacquaintances with unconcealed curiosity, instinctively selecting my\nfriends and picking out my enemies--and in only two cases did I mistake\nmy man.\n\nA sallow boy with bright red hair, sitting in the fourth row, shook\nhis fist at me furtively several times during the morning. I had a\npresentiment I should have trouble with that boy some day--a presentiment\nsubsequently realized.\n\nOn my left was a chubby little fellow with a great many freckles (this\nwas Pepper Whitcomb), who made some mysterious motions to me. I didn't\nunderstand them, but, as they were clearly of a pacific nature, I winked\nmy eye at him. This appeared to be satisfactory, for he then went on\nwith his studies. At recess he gave me the core of his apple, though\nthere were several applicants for it.\n\nPresently a boy in a loose olive-green jacket with two rows of brass\nbuttons held up a folded paper behind his slate, intimating that it was\nintended for me. The paper was passed skillfully from desk to desk until\nit reached my hands. On opening the scrap, I found that it contained\na small piece of molasses candy in an extremely humid state. This was\ncertainly kind. I nodded my acknowledgments and hastily slipped the\ndelicacy into my mouth. In a second I felt my tongue grow red-hot with\ncayenne pepper.\n\nMy face must have assumed a comical expression, for the boy in the\nolive-green jacket gave an hysterical laugh, for which he was instantly\npunished by Mr. Grimshaw. I swallowed the fiery candy, though it brought\nthe water to my eyes, and managed to look so unconcerned that I was\nthe only pupil in the form who escaped questioning as to the cause of\nMarden's misdemeanor. C. Marden was his name.\n\nNothing else occurred that morning to interrupt the exercises, excepting\nthat a boy in the reading class threw us all into convulsions by calling\nAbsalom A-bol'-som \"Abolsom, O my son Abolsom!\" I laughed as loud as\nanyone, but I am not so sure that I shouldn't have pronounced it Abolsom\nmyself.\n\nAt recess several of the scholars came to my desk and shook hands with\nme, Mr. Grimshaw having previously introduced me to Phil Adams, charging\nhim to see that I got into no trouble. My new acquaintances suggested\nthat we should go to the playground. We were no sooner out-of-doors than\nthe boy with the red hair thrust his way through the crowd and placed\nhimself at my side.\n\n\"I say, youngster, if you're comin' to this school you've got to toe the\nmark.\"\n\nI didn't see any mark to toe, and didn't understand what he meant; but I\nreplied politely, that, if it was the custom of the school, I should be\nhappy to toe the mark, if he would point it out to me.\n\n\"I don't want any of your sarse,\" said the boy, scowling.\n\n\"Look here, Conway!\" cried a clear voice from the other side of the\nplayground. \"You let young Bailey alone. He's a stranger here, and might\nbe afraid of you, and thrash you. Why do you always throw yourself in\nthe way of getting thrashed?\"\n\nI turned to the speaker, who by this time had reached the spot where we\nstood. Conway slunk off, favoring me with a parting scowl of defiance.\nI gave my hand to the boy who had befriended me--his name was Jack\nHarris--and thanked him for his good-will.\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Bailey,\" he said, returning my pressure\ngood-naturedly, \"you'll have to fight Conway before the quarter ends,\nor you'll have no rest. That fellow is always hankering after a licking,\nand of course you'll give him one by and by; but what's the use of\nhurrying up an unpleasant job? Let's have some baseball. By the way,\nBailey, you were a good kid not to let on to Grimshaw about the candy.\nCharley Marden would have caught it twice as heavy. He's sorry he played\nthe joke on you, and told me to tell you so. Hallo, Blake! Where are the\nbats?\"\n\nThis was addressed to a handsome, frank-looking lad of about my own age,\nwho was engaged just then in cutting his initials on the bark of a tree\nnear the schoolhouse. Blake shut up his penknife and went off to get the\nbats.\n\nDuring the game which ensued I made the acquaintance of Charley Marden,\nBinny Wallace, Pepper Whitcomb, Harry Blake, and Fred Langdon. These\nboys, none of them more than a year or two older than I (Binny Wallace\nwas younger), were ever after my chosen comrades. Phil Adams and Jack\nHarris were considerably our seniors, and, though they always treated\nus \"kids\" very kindly, they generally went with another set. Of course,\nbefore long I knew all the Temple boys more or less intimately, but the\nfive I have named were my constant companions.\n\nMy first day at the Temple Grammar School was on the whole satisfactory.\nI had made several warm friends and only two permanent enemies--Conway\nand his echo, Seth Rodgers; for these two always went together like a\nderanged stomach and a headache.\n\nBefore the end of the week I had my studies well in hand. I was a\nlittle ashamed at finding myself at the foot of the various classes, and\nsecretly determined to deserve promotion. The school was an admirable\none. I might make this part of my story more entertaining by picturing\nMr. Grimshaw as a tyrant with a red nose and a large stick; but\nunfortunately for the purposes of sensational narrative, Mr. Grimshaw\nwas a quiet, kindhearted gentleman. Though a rigid disciplinarian, he\nhad a keen sense of justice, was a good reader of character, and the\nboys respected him. There were two other teachers--a French tutor and a\nwriting-master, who visited the school twice a week. On Wednesdays and\nSaturdays we were dismissed at noon, and these half-holidays were the\nbrightest epochs of my existence.\n\nDaily contact with boys who had not been brought up as gently as I\nworked an immediate, and, in some respects, a beneficial change in my\ncharacter. I had the nonsense taken out of me, as the saying is--some\nof the nonsense, at least. I became more manly and self-reliant. I\ndiscovered that the world was not created exclusively on my account.\nIn New Orleans I labored under the delusion that it was. Having neither\nbrother nor sister to give up to at home, and being, moreover, the\nlargest pupil at school there, my will had seldom been opposed. At\nRivermouth matters were different, and I was not long in adapting myself\nto the altered circumstances. Of course I got many severe rubs, often\nunconsciously given; but I had the sense to see that I was all the\nbetter for them.\n\nMy social relations with my new schoolfellows were the pleasantest\npossible. There was always some exciting excursion on foot--a ramble\nthrough the pine woods, a visit to the Devil's Pulpit, a high cliff\nin the neighborhood--or a surreptitious low on the river, involving\nan exploration of a group of diminutive islands, upon one of which we\npitched a tent and played we were the Spanish sailors who got wrecked\nthere years ago. But the endless pine forest that skirted the town was\nour favorite haunt. There was a great green pond hidden somewhere in its\ndepths, inhabited by a monstrous colony of turtles. Harry Blake, who\nhad an eccentric passion for carving his name on everything, never let\na captured turtle slip through his fingers without leaving his mark\nengraved on its shell. He must have lettered about two thousand from\nfirst to last. We used to call them Harry Blake's sheep.\n\nThese turtles were of a discontented and migratory turn of mind, and we\nfrequently encountered two or three of them on the cross-roads several\nmiles from their ancestral mud. Unspeakable was our delight whenever we\ndiscovered one soberly walking off with Harry Blake's initials! I've\nno doubt there are, at this moment, fat ancient turtles wandering about\nthat gummy woodland with H.B. neatly cut on their venerable backs.\n\nIt soon became a custom among my playmates to make our barn their\nrendezvous. Gypsy proved a strong attraction. Captain Nutter bought me a\nlittle two-wheeled cart, which she drew quite nicely, after kicking out\nthe dasher and breaking the shafts once or twice. With our lunch-baskets\nand fishing-tackle stowed away under the seat, we used to start off\nearly in the afternoon for the sea-shore, where there were countless\nmarvels in the shape of shells, mosses, and kelp. Gypsy enjoyed the\nsport as keenly as any of us, even going so far, one day, as to trot\ndown the beach into the sea where we were bathing. As she took the cart\nwith her, our provisions were not much improved. I shall never forget\nhow squash-pie tastes after being soused in the Atlantic Ocean.\nSoda-crackers dipped in salt water are palatable, but not squash-pie.\n\nThere was a good deal of wet weather during those first six weeks at\nRivermouth, and we set ourselves at work to find some indoor amusement\nfor our half-holidays. It was all very well for Amadis de Gaul and Don\nQuixote not to mind the rain; they had iron overcoats, and were not,\nfrom all we can learn, subject to croup and the guidance of their\ngrandfathers. Our case was different.\n\n\"Now, boys, what shall we do?\" I asked, addressing a thoughtful conclave\nof seven, assembled in our barn one dismal rainy afternoon.\n\n\"Let's have a theatre,\" suggested Binny Wallace.\n\nThe very thing! But where? The loft of the stable was ready to burst\nwith hay provided for Gypsy, but the long room over the carriage-house\nwas unoccupied. The place of all places! My managerial eye saw at a\nglance its capabilities for a theatre. I had been to the play a great\nmany times in New Orleans, and was wise in matters pertaining to the\ndrama. So here, in due time, was set up some extraordinary scenery of my\nown painting. The curtain, I recollect, though it worked smoothly enough\non other occasions, invariably hitched during the performances; and it\noften required the united energies of the Prince of Denmark, the King,\nand the Grave-digger, with an occasional band from \"the fair Ophelia\"\n(Pepper Whitcomb in a low-necked dress), to hoist that bit of green\ncambric.\n\nThe theatre, however, was a success, as far as it went. I retired from\nthe business with no fewer than fifteen hundred pins, after deducting\nthe headless, the pointless, and the crooked pins with which our\ndoorkeeper frequently got \"stuck.\" From first to last we took in a\ngreat deal of this counterfeit money. The price of admission to the\n\"Rivermouth Theatre\" was twenty pins. I played all the principal parts\nmyself--not that I was a finer actor than the other boys, but because I\nowned the establishment.\n\nAt the tenth representation, my dramatic career was brought to a close\nby an unfortunate circumstance. We were playing the drama of \"William\nTell, the Hero of Switzerland.\" Of course I was William Tell, in spite\nof Fred Langdon, who wanted to act that character himself. I wouldn't\nlet him, so he withdrew from the company, taking the only bow and arrow\nwe had. I made a cross-bow out of a piece of whalebone, and did very\nwell without him. We had reached that exciting scene where Gessler, the\nAustrian tyrant, commands Tell to shoot the apple from his son's head.\nPepper Whitcomb, who played all the juvenile and women parts, was my\nson. To guard against mischance, a piece of pasteboard was fastened by a\nhandkerchief over the upper portion of Whitcomb's face, while the arrow\nto be used was sewed up in a strip of flannel. I was a capital marksman,\nand the big apple, only two yards distant, turned its russet cheek\nfairly towards me.\n\nI can see poor little Pepper now, as he stood without flinching,\nwaiting for me to perform my great feat. I raised the crossbow amid the\nbreathless silence of the crowded audience consisting of seven boys and\nthree girls, exclusive of Kitty Collins, who insisted on paying her way\nin with a clothes-pin. I raised the cross-bow, I repeat. Twang! went the\nwhipcord; but, alas! instead of hitting the apple, the arrow flew right\ninto Pepper Whitcomb's mouth, which happened to be open at the time, and\ndestroyed my aim.\n\nI shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory.\nPepper's roar, expressive of astonishment, indignation, and pain, is\nstill ringing in my cars. I looked upon him as a corpse, and, glancing\nnot far into the dreary future, pictured myself led forth to execution\nin the presence of the very same spectators then assembled.\n\nLuckily poor Pepper was not seriously hurt; but Grandfather Nutter,\nappearing in the midst of the confusion (attracted by the howls of young\nTell), issued an injunction against all theatricals thereafter, and the\nplace was closed; not, however, without a farewell speech from me, in\nwhich I said that this would have been the proudest moment of my life\nif I hadn't hit Pepper Whitcomb in the mouth. Whereupon the audience\n(assisted, I am glad to state, by Pepper) cried \"Hear! Hear!\" I then\nattributed the accident to Pepper himself, whose mouth, being open at\nthe instant I fired, acted upon the arrow much after the fashion of a\nwhirlpool, and drew in the fatal shaft. I was about to explain how a\ncomparatively small maelstrom could suck in the largest ship, when the\ncurtain fell of its own accord, amid the shouts of the audience.\n\nThis was my last appearance on any stage. It was some time, though,\nbefore I heard the end of the William Tell business. Malicious little\nboys who had not been allowed to buy tickets to my theatre used to cry\nout after me in the street,\n\n     \"'Who killed Cock Robin?'\n     'I,' said the sparrer,\n     'With my bow and arrer,\n     I killed Cock Robin!'\"\n\nThe sarcasm of this verse was more than I could stand. And it made\nPepper Whitcomb pretty mad to be called Cock Robin, I can tell you!\n\nSo the days glided on, with fewer clouds and more sunshine than fall to\nthe lot of most boys. Conway was certainly a cloud. Within school-bounds\nhe seldom ventured to be aggressive; but whenever we met about town he\nnever failed to brush against me, or pull my cap over my eyes, or\ndrive me distracted by inquiring after my family in New Orleans, always\nalluding to them as highly respectable colored people.\n\nJack Harris was right when he said Conway would give me no rest until I\nfought him. I felt it was ordained ages before our birth that we should\nmeet on this planet and fight. With the view of not running counter to\ndestiny, I quietly prepared myself for the impending conflict. The scene\nof my dramatic triumphs was turned into a gymnasium for this purpose,\nthough I did not openly avow the fact to the boys. By persistently\nstanding on my head, raising heavy weights, and going hand over hand up\na ladder, I developed my muscle until my little body was as tough as a\nhickory knot and as supple as tripe. I also took occasional lessons in\nthe noble art of self-defence, under the tuition of Phil Adams.\n\nI brooded over the matter until the idea of fighting Conway became a\npart of me. I fought him in imagination during school-hours; I dreamed\nof fighting with him at night, when he would suddenly expand into a\ngiant twelve feet high, and then as suddenly shrink into a pygmy so\nsmall that I couldn't hit him. In this latter shape he would get into\nmy hair, or pop into my waistcoat-pocket, treating me with as little\nceremony as the Liliputians showed Captain Lemuel Gulliver--all of which\nwas not pleasant, to be sure. On the whole, Conway was a cloud.\n\nAnd then I had a cloud at home. It was not Grandfather Nutter, nor Miss\nAbigail, nor Kitty Collins, though they all helped to compose it. It\nwas a vague, funereal, impalpable something which no amount of gymnastic\ntraining would enable me to knock over. It was Sunday. If ever I have\na boy to bring up in the way he should go, I intend to make Sunday a\ncheerful day to him. Sunday was not a cheerful day at the Nutter House.\nYou shall judge for yourself.\n\nIt is Sunday morning. I should premise by saying that the deep gloom\nwhich has settled over everything set in like a heavy fog early on\nSaturday evening.\n\nAt seven o'clock my grandfather comes smilelessly downstairs. He is\ndressed in black, and looks as if he had lost all his friends during\nthe night. Miss Abigail, also in black, looks as if she were prepared to\nbury them, and not indisposed to enjoy the ceremony. Even Kitty Collins\nhas caught the contagious gloom, as I perceive when she brings in the\ncoffee-urn--a solemn and sculpturesque urn at any time, but monumental\nnow--and sets it down in front of Miss Abigail. Miss Abigail gazes at\nthe urn as if it held the ashes of her ancestors, instead of a generous\nquantity of fine old Java coffee. The meal progresses in silence.\n\nOur parlor is by no means thrown open every day. It is open this June\nmorning, and is pervaded by a strong smell of centretable. The furniture\nof the room, and the little China ornaments on the mantel-piece, have a\nconstrained, unfamiliar look. My grandfather sits in a mahogany chair,\nreading a large Bible covered with green baize. Miss Abigail occupies\none end of the sofa, and has her hands crossed stiffly in her lap. I\nsit in the corner, crushed. Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas are in close\nconfinement. Baron Trenck, who managed to escape from the fortress of\nClatz, can't for the life of him get out of our sitting-room closet. Even\nthe Rivermouth Barnacle is suppressed until Monday. Genial converse,\nharmless books, smiles, lightsome hearts, all are banished. If I want to\nread anything, I can read Baxter's Saints' Rest. I would die first. So\nI sit there kicking my heels, thinking about New Orleans, and watching\na morbid blue-bottle fly that attempts to commit suicide by butting his\nhead against the window-pane. Listen!--no, yes--it is--it is the robins\nsinging in the garden--the grateful, joyous robins singing away like mad,\njust as if it wasn't Sunday. Their audacity tickles me.\n\nMy grandfather looks up, and inquires in a sepulchral voice if I am\nready for Sabbath school. It is time to go. I like the Sabbath school;\nthere are bright young faces there, at all events. When I get out into\nthe sunshine alone, I draw a long breath; I would turn a somersault up\nagainst Neighbor Penhallow's newly painted fence if I hadn't my best\ntrousers on, so glad am I to escape from the oppressive atmosphere of\nthe Nutter House.\n\nSabbath school over, I go to meeting, joining my grandfather, who\ndoesn't appear to be any relation to me this day, and Miss Abigail, in\nthe porch. Our minister holds out very little hope to any of us of being\nsaved. Convinced that I am a lost creature, in common with the human\nfamily, I return home behind my guardians at a snail's pace. We have a\ndead cold dinner. I saw it laid out yesterday.\n\nThere is a long interval between this repast and the second service,\nand a still longer interval between the beginning and the end of that\nservice; for the Rev. Wibird Hawkins's sermons are none of the shortest,\nwhatever else they may be.\n\nAfter meeting, my grandfather and I take a walk. We visit appropriately\nenough--a neighboring graveyard. I am by this time in a condition of\nmind to become a willing inmate of the place. The usual evening\nprayer-meeting is postponed for some reason. At half past eight I go to\nbed.\n\nThis is the way Sunday was observed in the Nutter House, and pretty\ngenerally throughout the town, twenty years ago.(1) People who were\nprosperous and natural and happy on Saturday became the most rueful of\nhuman beings in the brief space of twelve hours. I don't think there was\nany hypocrisy in this. It was merely the old Puritan austerity cropping\nout once a week. Many of these people were pure Christians every day in\nthe seven--excepting the seventh. Then they were decorous and solemn to\nthe verge of moroseness. I should not like to be misunderstood on this\npoint. Sunday is a blessed day, and therefore it should not be made a\ngloomy one. It is the Lord's day, and I do believe that cheerful hearts\nand faces are not unpleasant in His sight.\n\n     \"O day of rest! How beautiful, how fair,\n     How welcome to the weary and the old!\n     Day of the Lord! and truce to earthly cares!\n     Day of the Lord, as all our days should be!\n     Ah, why will man by his austerities\n     Shut out the blessed sunshine and the light,\n     And make of thee a dungeon of despair!\"\n\n\n     (1) About 1850.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven--One Memorable Night\n\n\nTwo months had elapsed since my arrival at Rivermouth, when the approach\nof an important celebration produced the greatest excitement among the\njuvenile population of the town.\n\nThere was very little hard study done in the Temple Grammar School the\nweek preceding the Fourth of July. For my part, my heart and brain were\nso full of fire-crackers, Roman candles, rockets, pin-wheels, squibs,\nand gunpowder in various seductive forms, that I wonder I didn't explode\nunder Mr. Grimshaw's very nose. I couldn't do a sum to save me; I\ncouldn't tell, for love or money, whether Tallahassee was the capital\nof Tennessee or of Florida; the present and the pluperfect tenses\nwere inextricably mixed in my memory, and I didn't know a verb from an\nadjective when I met one. This was not alone my condition, but that of\nevery boy in the school.\n\nMr. Grimshaw considerately made allowances for our temporary\ndistraction, and sought to fix our interest on the lessons by connecting\nthem directly or indirectly with the coming Event. The class in\narithmetic, for instance, was requested to state how many boxes of\nfire-crackers, each box measuring sixteen inches square, could be stored\nin a room of such and such dimensions. He gave us the Declaration of\nIndependence for a parsing exercise, and in geography confined his\nquestions almost exclusively to localities rendered famous in the\nRevolutionary War.\n\n\"What did the people of Boston do with the tea on board the English\nvessels?\" asked our wily instructor.\n\n\"Threw it into the river!\" shrieked the smaller boys, with an\nimpetuosity that made Mr. Grimshaw smile in spite of himself. One\nluckless urchin said, \"Chucked it,\" for which happy expression he was\nkept in at recess.\n\nNotwithstanding these clever stratagems, there was not much solid work\ndone by anybody. The trail of the serpent (an inexpensive but dangerous\nfire-toy) was over us all. We went round deformed by quantities of\nChinese crackers artlessly concealed in our trousers-pockets; and if a\nboy whipped out his handkerchief without proper precaution, he was sure\nto let off two or three torpedoes.\n\nEven Mr. Grimshaw was made a sort of accessory to the universal\ndemoralization. In calling the school to order, he always rapped on\nthe table with a heavy ruler. Under the green baize table-cloth, on the\nexact spot where he usually struck, certain boy, whose name I withhold,\nplaced a fat torpedo. The result was a loud explosion, which caused Mr.\nGrimshaw to look queer. Charley Marden was at the water-pail, at the\ntime, and directed general attention to himself by strangling for\nseveral seconds and then squirting a slender thread of water over the\nblackboard.\n\nMr. Grimshaw fixed his eyes reproachfully on Charley, but said nothing.\nThe real culprit (it wasn't Charley Marden, but the boy whose name I\nwithhold) instantly regretted his badness, and after school confessed\nthe whole thing to Mr. Grimshaw, who heaped coals of fire upon the\nnameless boy's head giving him five cents for the Fourth of July. If\nMr. Grimshaw had caned this unknown youth, the punishment would not have\nbeen half so severe.\n\nOn the last day of June the Captain received a letter from my father,\nenclosing five dollars \"for my son Tom,\" which enabled that young\ngentleman to make regal preparations for the celebration of our national\nindependence. A portion of this money, two dollars, I hastened to invest\nin fireworks; the balance I put by for contingencies. In placing the\nfund in my possession, the Captain imposed one condition that dampened\nmy ardor considerably--I was to buy no gunpowder. I might have all the\nsnapping-crackers and torpedoes I wanted; but gunpowder was out of the\nquestion.\n\nI thought this rather hard, for all my young friends were provided with\npistols of various sizes. Pepper Whitcomb had a horse-pistol nearly as\nlarge as himself, and Jack Harris, though he, to be sure, was a big\nboy, was going to have a real oldfashioned flintlock musket. However, I\ndidn't mean to let this drawback destroy my happiness. I had one charge\nof powder stowed away in the little brass pistol which I brought from\nNew Orleans, and was bound to make a noise in the world once, if I never\ndid again.\n\nIt was a custom observed from time immemorial for the towns-boys to have\na bonfire on the Square on the midnight before the Fourth. I didn't ask\nthe Captain's leave to attend this ceremony, for I had a general idea\nthat he wouldn't give it. If the Captain, I reasoned, doesn't forbid me,\nI break no orders by going. Now this was a specious line of argument,\nand the mishaps that befell me in consequence of adopting it were richly\ndeserved.\n\nOn the evening of the 3d I retired to bed very early, in order to disarm\nsuspicion. I didn't sleep a wink, waiting for eleven o'clock to come\nround; and I thought it never would come round, as I lay counting from\ntime to time the slow strokes of the ponderous bell in the steeple of\nthe Old North Church. At length the laggard hour arrived. While the\nclock was striking I jumped out of bed and began dressing.\n\nMy grandfather and Miss Abigail were heavy sleepers, and I might have\nstolen downstairs and out at the front door undetected; but such a\ncommonplace proceeding did not suit my adventurous disposition. I\nfastened one end of a rope (it was a few yards cut from Kitty Collins's\nclothes-line) to the bedpost nearest the window, and cautiously climbed\nout on the wide pediment over the hall door. I had neglected to knot the\nrope; the result was, that, the moment I swung clear of the pediment, I\ndescended like a flash of lightning, and warmed both my hands smartly.\nThe rope, moreover, was four or five feet too short; so I got a fall\nthat would have proved serious had I not tumbled into the middle of one\nof the big rose-bushes growing on either side of the steps.\n\nI scrambled out of that without delay, and was congratulating myself on\nmy good luck, when I saw by the light of the setting moon the form of a\nman leaning over the garden gate. It was one of the town watch, who had\nprobably been observing my operations with curiosity. Seeing no chance\nof escape, I put a bold face on the matter and walked directly up to\nhim.\n\n\"What on airth air you a doin'?\" asked the man, grasping the collar of\nmy jacket.\n\n\"I live here, sir, if you please,\" I replied, \"and am going to the\nbonfire. I didn't want to wake up the old folks, that's all.\"\n\nThe man cocked his eye at me in the most amiable manner, and released\nhis hold.\n\n\"Boys is boys,\" he muttered. He didn't attempt to stop me as I slipped\nthrough the gate.\n\nOnce beyond his clutches, I took to my heels and soon reached the\nSquare, where I found forty or fifty fellows assembled, engaged in\nbuilding a pyramid of tar-barrels. The palms of my hands still tingled\nso that I couldn't join in the sport. I stood in the doorway of the\nNautilus Bank, watching the workers, among whom I recognized lots of my\nschoolmates. They looked like a legion of imps, coming and going in the\ntwilight, busy in raising some infernal edifice. What a Babel of\nvoices it was, everybody directing everybody else, and everybody doing\neverything wrong!\n\nWhen all was prepared, someone applied a match to the sombre pile. A\nfiery tongue thrust itself out here and there, then suddenly the whole\nfabric burst into flames, blazing and crackling beautifully. This was a\nsignal for the boys to join hands and dance around the burning barrels,\nwhich they did shouting like mad creatures. When the fire had burnt\ndown a little, fresh staves were brought and heaped on the pyre. In the\nexcitement of the moment I forgot my tingling palms, and found myself in\nthe thick of the carousal.\n\nBefore we were half ready, our combustible material was expended, and a\ndisheartening kind of darkness settled down upon us. The boys collected\ntogether here and there in knots, consulting as to what should be done.\nIt yet lacked four or five hours of daybreak, and none of us were in the\nhumor to return to bed. I approached one of the groups standing near the\ntown pump, and discovered in the uncertain light of the dying brands the\nfigures of Jack Harris, Phil Adams, Harry Blake, and Pepper Whitcomb,\ntheir faces streaked with perspiration and tar, and, their whole\nappearance suggestive of New Zealand chiefs.\n\n\"Hullo! Here's Tom Bailey!\" shouted Pepper Whitcomb. \"He'll join in!\"\n\nOf course he would. The sting had gone out of my hands, and I was ripe\nfor anything--none the less ripe for not knowing what was on the tapis.\nAfter whispering together for a moment the boys motioned me to follow\nthem.\n\nWe glided out from the crowd and silently wended our way through a\nneighboring alley, at the head of which stood a tumble-down old barn,\nowned by one Ezra Wingate. In former days this was the stable of the\nmail-coach that ran between Rivermouth and Boston. When the railroad\nsuperseded that primitive mode of travel, the lumbering vehicle was\nrolled in the barn, and there it stayed. The stage-driver, after\nprophesying the immediate downfall of the nation, died of grief and\napoplexy, and the old coach followed in his wake as fast as could\nby quietly dropping to pieces. The barn had the reputation of being\nhaunted, and I think we all kept very close together when we found\nourselves standing in the black shadow cast by the tall gable. Here,\nin a low voice, Jack Harris laid bare his plan, which was to burn the\nancient stage-coach.\n\n\"The old trundle-cart isn't worth twenty-five cents,\" said Jack Harris,\n\"and Ezra Wingate ought to thank us for getting the rubbish out of the\nway. But if any fellow here doesn't want to have a hand in it, let him\ncut and run, and keep a quiet tongue in his head ever after.\"\n\nWith this he pulled out the staples that held the lock, and the big barn\ndoor swung slowly open. The interior of the stable was pitch-dark, of\ncourse. As we made a movement to enter, a sudden scrambling, and the\nsound of heavy bodies leaping in all directions, caused us to start back\nin terror.\n\n\"Rats!\" cried Phil Adams.\n\n\"Bats!\" exclaimed Harry Blake.\n\n\"Cats!\" suggested Jack Harris. \"Who's afraid?\"\n\nWell, the truth is, we were all afraid; and if the pole of the stage had\nnot been lying close to the threshold, I don't believe anything on earth\nwould have induced us to cross it. We seized hold of the pole-straps\nand succeeded with great trouble in dragging the coach out. The two fore\nwheels had rusted to the axle-tree, and refused to revolve. It was the\nmerest skeleton of a coach. The cushions had long since been removed,\nand the leather hangings, where they had not crumbled away, dangled in\nshreds from the worm-eaten frame. A load of ghosts and a span of phantom\nhorses to drag them would have made the ghastly thing complete.\n\nLuckily for our undertaking, the stable stood at the top of a very steep\nhill. With three boys to push behind, and two in front to steer, we\nstarted the old coach on its last trip with little or no difficulty.\nOur speed increased every moment, and, the fore wheels becoming unlocked\nas we arrived at the foot of the declivity, we charged upon the crowd\nlike a regiment of cavalry, scattering the people right and left. Before\nreaching the bonfire, to which someone had added several bushels of\nshavings, Jack Harris and Phil Adams, who were steering, dropped on the\nground, and allowed the vehicle to pass over them, which it did without\ninjuring them; but the boys who were clinging for dear life to the\ntrunk-rack behind fell over the prostrate steersman, and there we all\nlay in a heap, two or three of us quite picturesque with the nose-bleed.\n\nThe coach, with an intuitive perception of what was expected of it,\nplunged into the centre of the kindling shavings, and stopped. The\nflames sprung up and clung to the rotten woodwork, which burned like\ntinder. At this moment a figure was seen leaping wildly from the inside\nof the blazing coach. The figure made three bounds towards us, and\ntripped over Harry Blake. It was Pepper Whitcomb, with his hair somewhat\nsinged, and his eyebrows completely scorched off!\n\nPepper had slyly ensconced himself on the back seat before we started,\nintending to have a neat little ride down hill, and a laugh at us\nafterwards. But the laugh, as it happened, was on our side, or would\nhave been, if half a dozen watchmen had not suddenly pounced down upon\nus, as we lay scrambling on the ground, weak with mirth over Pepper's\nmisfortune. We were collared and marched off before we well knew what\nhad happened.\n\nThe abrupt transition from the noise and light of the Square to the\nsilent, gloomy brick room in the rear of the Meat Market seemed like the\nwork of enchantment. We stared at each other, aghast.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Jack Harris, with a sickly smile, \"this is a go!\"\n\n\"No go, I should say,\" whimpered Harry Blake, glancing at the bare brick\nwalls and the heavy ironplated door.\n\n\"Never say die,\" muttered Phil Adams, dolefully.\n\nThe bridewell was a small low-studded chamber built up against the\nrear end of the Meat Market, and approached from the Square by a narrow\npassage-way. A portion of the rooms partitioned off into eight cells,\nnumbered, each capable of holding two persons. The cells were full at\nthe time, as we presently discovered by seeing several hideous faces\nleering out at us through the gratings of the doors.\n\nA smoky oil-lamp in a lantern suspended from the ceiling threw a\nflickering light over the apartment, which contained no furniture\nexcepting a couple of stout wooden benches. It was a dismal place by\nnight, and only little less dismal by day, tall houses surrounding \"the\nlock-up\" prevented the faintest ray of sunshine from penetrating the\nventilator over the door--long narrow window opening inward and propped\nup by a piece of lath.\n\nAs we seated ourselves in a row on one of the benches, I imagine that\nour aspect was anything but cheerful. Adams and Harris looked very\nanxious, and Harry Blake, whose nose had just stopped bleeding, was\nmournfully carving his name, by sheer force of habit, on the prison\nbench. I don't think I ever saw a more \"wrecked\" expression on any\nhuman countenance than Pepper Whitcomb's presented. His look of natural\nastonishment at finding himself incarcerated in a jail was considerably\nheightened by his lack of eyebrows.\n\nAs for me, it was only by thinking how the late Baron Trenck would\nhave conducted himself under similar circumstances that I was able to\nrestrain my tears.\n\nNone of us were inclined to conversation. A deep silence, broken now\nand then by a startling snore from the cells, reigned throughout the\nchamber. By and by Pepper Whitcomb glanced nervously towards Phil Adams\nand said, \"Phil, do you think they will--hang us?\"\n\n\"Hang your grandmother!\" returned Adams, impatiently. \"What I'm afraid\nof is that they'll keep us locked up until the Fourth is over.\"\n\n\"You ain't smart ef they do!\" cried a voice from one of the cells. It\nwas a deep bass voice that sent a chill through me.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said Jack Harris, addressing the cells in general; for\nthe echoing qualities of the room made it difficult to locate the voice.\n\n\"That don't matter,\" replied the speaker, putting his face close up to\nthe gratings of No. 3, \"but ef I was a youngster like you, free an' easy\noutside there, this spot wouldn't hold me long.\"\n\n\"That's so!\" chimed several of the prison-birds, wagging their heads\nbehind the iron lattices.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Jack Harris, rising from his seat and walking on\ntip-toe to the door of cell No. 3. \"What would you do?\"\n\n\"Do? Why, I'd pile them 'ere benches up agin that 'ere door, an' crawl\nout of that 'erc winder in no time. That's my adwice.\"\n\n\"And werry good adwice it is, Jim,\" said the occupant of No. 5,\napprovingly.\n\nJack Harris seemed to be of the same opinion, for he hastily placed the\nbenches one on the top of another under the ventilator, and, climbing up\non the highest bench, peeped out into the passage-way.\n\n\"If any gent happens to have a ninepence about him,\" said the man in\ncell No. 3, \"there's a sufferin' family here as could make use of it.\nSmallest favors gratefully received, an' no questions axed.\"\n\nThis appeal touched a new silver quarter of a dollar in my\ntrousers-pocket; I fished out the coin from a mass of fireworks, and\ngave it to the prisoner. He appeared to be so good-natured a fellow that\nI ventured to ask what he had done to get into jail.\n\n\"Intirely innocent. I was clapped in here by a rascally nevew as wishes\nto enjoy my wealth afore I'm dead.'\n\n\"Your name, Sir?' I inquired, with a view of reporting the outrage to my\ngrandfather and having the injured person re instated in society.\n\n\"Git out, you insolent young reptyle!\" shouted the man, in a passion.\n\nI retreated precipitately, amid a roar of laughter from the other cells.\n\n\"Can't you keep still?\" exclaimed Harris, withdrawing his head from the\nwindow.\n\nA portly watchman usually sat on a stool outside the door day and night;\nbut on this particular occasion, his services being required elsewhere,\nthe bridewell had been left to guard itself.\n\n\"All clear,\" whispered Jack Harris, as he vanished through the\naperture and dropped softly on the ground outside. We all followed him\nexpeditiously--Pepper Whitcomb and myself getting stuck in the window for\na moment in our frantic efforts not to be last.\n\n\"Now, boys, everybody for himself!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight--The Adventures of a Fourth\n\n\nThe sun cast a broad column of quivering gold across the river at the\nfoot of our street, just as I reached the doorstep of the Nutter House.\nKitty Collins, with her dress tucked about her so that she looked as if\nshe had on a pair of calico trousers, was washing off the sidewalk.\n\n\"Arrah you bad boy!\" cried Kitty, leaning on the mop handle. \"The Capen\nhas jist been askin' for you. He's gone up town, now. It's a nate thing\nyou done with my clothes-line, and, it's me you may thank for gettin' it\nout of the way before the Capen come down.\"\n\nThe kind creature had hauled in the rope, and my escapade had not been\ndiscovered by the family; but I knew very well that the burning of the\nstage-coach, and the arrest of the boys concerned in the mischief, were\nsure to reach my grandfathers ears sooner or later.\n\n\"Well, Thomas,\" said the old gentleman, an hour or so afterwards,\nbeaming upon me benevolently across the breakfast table, \"you didn't\nwait to be called this morning.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I replied, growing very warm, \"I took a little run up town to\nsee what was going on.\"\n\nI didn't say anything about the little run I took home again! \"They had\nquite a time on the Square last night,\" remarked Captain Nutter, looking\nup from the Rivermouth Barnacle, which was always placed beside his\ncoffee-cup at breakfast.\n\nI felt that my hair was preparing to stand on end.\n\n\"Quite a time,\" continued my grandfather. \"Some boys broke into Ezra\nWingate's barn and carried off the old stagecoach. The young rascals! I\ndo believe they'd burn up the whole town if they had their way.\"\n\nWith this he resumed the paper. After a long silence he exclaimed,\n\"Hullo!\" upon which I nearly fell off the chair.\n\n\"'Miscreants unknown,'\" read my grandfather, following the paragraph\nwith his forefinger; \"'escaped from the bridewell, leaving no clew to\ntheir identity, except the letter H, cut on one of the benches.' 'Five\ndollars reward offered for the apprehension of the perpetrators.' Sho! I\nhope Wingate will catch them.\"\n\nI don't see how I continued to live, for on hearing this the breath went\nentirely out of my body. I beat a retreat from the room as soon as I\ncould, and flew to the stable with a misty intention of mounting Gypsy\nand escaping from the place. I was pondering what steps to take, when\nJack Harris and Charley Marden entered the yard.\n\n\"I say,\" said Harris, as blithe as a lark, \"has old Wingate been here?\"\n\n\"Been here?\" I cried, \"I should hope not!\"\n\n\"The whole thing's out, you know,\" said Harris, pulling Gypsy's forelock\nover her eyes and blowing playfully into her nostrils.\n\n\"You don't mean it!\" I gasped.\n\n\"Yes, I do, and we are to pay Wingate three dollars apiece. He'll make\nrather a good spec out of it.\"\n\n\"But how did he discover that we were the--the miscreants?\" I asked,\nquoting mechanically from the Rivermouth Bamacle.\n\n\"Why, he saw us take the old ark, confound him! He's been trying to sell\nit any time these ten years. Now he has sold it to us. When he found\nthat we had slipped out of the Meat Market, he went right off and wrote\nthe advertisement offering five dollars reward; though he knew well\nenough who had taken the coach, for he came round to my father's\nhouse before the paper was printed to talk the matter over. Wasn't the\ngovernor mad, though! But it's all settled, I tell you. We're to pay\nWingate fifteen dollars for the old go-cart, which he wanted to sell\nthe other day for seventy-five cents, and couldn't. It's a downright\nswindle. But the funny part of it is to come.\"\n\n\"O, there's a funny part to it, is there?\" I remarked bitterly.\n\n\"Yes. The moment Bill Conway saw the advertisement, he knew it was\nHarry Blake who cut that letter H on the bench; so off he rushes up to\nWingate--kind of him, wasn't it?--and claims the reward. 'Too late, young\nman,' says old Wingate, 'the culprits has been discovered.' You see\nSly-boots hadn't any intention of paying that five dollars.\"\n\nJack Harris's statement lifted a weight from my bosom. The article in\nthe Rivermouth Barnacle had placed the affair before me in a new light.\nI had thoughtlessly committed a grave offence. Though the property in\nquestion was valueless, we were clearly wrong in destroying it. At the\nsame time Mr. Wingate had tacitly sanctioned the act by not preventing\nit when he might easily have done so. He had allowed his property to be\ndestroyed in order that he might realize a large profit.\n\nWithout waiting to hear more, I went straight to Captain Nutter, and,\nlaying my remaining three dollars on his knee, confessed my share in the\nprevious night's transaction.\n\nThe Captain heard me through in profound silence, pocketed the\nbank-notes, and walked off without speaking a word. He had punished me\nin his own whimsical fashion at the breakfast table, for, at the very\nmoment he was harrowing up my soul by reading the extracts from the\nRivermouth Barnacle, he not only knew all about the bonfire, but had\npaid Ezra Wingate his three dollars. Such was the duplicity of that aged\nimpostor.\n\nI think Captain Nutter was justified in retaining my pocketmoney, as\nadditional punishment, though the possession of it later in the day\nwould have got me out of a difficult position, as the reader will see\nfurther on. I returned with a light heart and a large piece of punk to\nmy friends in the stable-yard, where we celebrated the termination\nof our trouble by setting off two packs of fire-crackers in an empty\nwine-cask. They made a prodigious racket, but failed somehow to fully\nexpress my feelings. The little brass pistol in my bedroom suddenly\noccurred to me. It had been loaded I don't know how many months, long\nbefore I left New Orleans, and now was the time, if ever, to fire it\noff. Muskets, blunderbusses, and pistols were banging away lively all\nover town, and the smell of gunpowder, floating on the air, set me wild\nto add something respectable to the universal din.\n\nWhen the pistol was produced, Jack Harris examined the rusty cap and\nprophesied that it would not explode.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said I, \"let's try it.\"\n\nI had fired the pistol once, secretly, in New Orleans, and, remembering\nthe noise it gave birth to on that occasion, I shut both eyes tight as\nI pulled the trigger. The hammer clicked on the cap with a dull, dead\nsound. Then Harris tried it; then Charley Marden; then I took it again,\nand after three or four trials was on the point of giving it up as a\nbad job, when the obstinate thing went off with a tremendous explosion,\nnearly jerking my arm from the socket. The smoke cleared away, and\nthere I stood with the stock of the pistol clutched convulsively in my\nhand--the barrel, lock, trigger, and ramrod having vanished into thin\nair.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" cried the boys, in one breath.\n\n\"N--no,\" I replied, dubiously, for the concussion had bewildered me a\nlittle.\n\nWhen I realized the nature of the calamity, my grief was excessive. I\ncan't imagine what led me to do so ridiculous a thing, but I gravely\nburied the remains of my beloved pistol in our back garden, and erected\nover the mound a slate tablet to the effect that \"Mr. Barker formerly of\nnew Orleans, was killed accidentally on the Fourth of July, 18-- in the\n2nd year of his Age.\"  Binny Wallace, arriving on the spot just after\nthe disaster, and Charley Marden (who enjoyed the obsequies immensely),\nacted with me as chief mourners. I, for my part, was a very sincere one.\n\nAs I turned away in a disconsolate mood from the garden, Charley Marden\nremarked that he shouldn't be surprised if the pistol-butt took root and\ngrew into a mahogany-tree or something. He said he once planted an old\nmusket-stock, and shortly afterwards a lot of shoots sprung up! Jack\nHarris laughed; but neither I nor Binny Wallace saw Charley's wicked\njoke.\n\nWe were now joined by Pepper Whitcomb, Fred Langdon, and several other\ndesperate characters, on their way to the Square, which was always a\nbusy place when public festivities were going on. Feeling that I was\nstill in disgrace with the Captain, I thought it politic to ask his\nconsent before accompanying the boys.\n\nHe gave it with some hesitation, advising me to be careful not to get\nin front of the firearms. Once he put his fingers mechanically into his\nvest-pocket and half drew forth some dollar bills, then slowly thrust\nthem back again as his sense of justice overcame his genial disposition.\nI guess it cut the old gentleman to the heart to be obliged to keep\nme out of my pocket-money. I know it did me. However, as I was passing\nthrough the hall, Miss Abigail, with a very severe cast of countenance,\nslipped a brand-new quarter into my hand. We had silver currency in\nthose days, thank Heaven!\n\nGreat were the bustle and confusion on the Square. By the way, I don't\nknow why they called this large open space a square, unless because it\nwas an oval--an oval formed by the confluence of half a dozen streets,\nnow thronged by crowds of smartly dressed towns-people and country\nfolks; for Rivermouth on the Fourth was the centre of attraction to the\ninhabitants of the neighboring villages.\n\nOn one side of the Square were twenty or thirty booths arranged in\na semi-circle, gay with little flags and seductive with lemonade,\nginger-beer, and seedcakes. Here and there were tables at which could be\npurchased the smaller sort of fireworks, such as pin-wheels, serpents,\ndouble-headers, and punk warranted not to go out. Many of the adjacent\nhouses made a pretty display of bunting, and across each of the streets\nopening on the Square was an arch of spruce and evergreen, blossoming\nall over with patriotic mottoes and paper roses.\n\nIt was a noisy, merry, bewildering scene as we came upon the ground. The\nincessant rattle of small arms, the booming of the twelve-pounder firing\non the Mill Dam, and the silvery clangor of the church-bells ringing\nsimultaneously--not to mention an ambitious brass-band that was blowing\nitself to pieces on a balcony--were enough to drive one distracted. We\namused ourselves for an hour or two, darting in and out among the crowd\nand setting off our crackers. At one o'clock the Hon. Hezekiah Elkins\nmounted a platform in the middle of the Square and delivered an oration,\nto which his \"feller-citizens\" didn't pay much attention, having all\nthey could do to dodge the squibs that were set loose upon them by\nmischievous boys stationed on the surrounding housetops.\n\nOur little party which had picked up recruits here and there, not being\nswayed by eloquence, withdrew to a booth on the outskirts of the crowd,\nwhere we regaled ourselves with root beer at two cents a glass. I\nrecollect being much struck by the placard surmounting this tent:\n\nROOT BEER\n\nSOLD HERE\n\nIt seemed to me the perfection of pith and poetry. What could be more\nterse? Not a word to spare, and yet everything fully expressed. Rhyme\nand rhythm faultless. It was a delightful poet who made those verses. As\nfor the beer itself--that, I think, must have been made from the root\nof all evil! A single glass of it insured an uninterrupted pain for\ntwenty-four hours.\n\nThe influence of my liberality working on Charley Marden--for it was I\nwho paid for the beer--he presently invited us all to take an ice-cream\nwith him at Pettingil's saloon. Pettingil was the Delmonico of\nRivermouth. He furnished ices and confectionery for aristocratic balls\nand parties, and didn't disdain to officiate as leader of the orchestra\nat the same; for Pettingil played on the violin, as Pepper Whitcomb\ndescribed it, \"like Old Scratch.\"\n\nPettingil's confectionery store was on the corner of Willow and High\nStreets. The saloon, separated from the shop by a flight of three steps\nleading to a door hung with faded red drapery, had about it an air of\nmystery and seclusion quite delightful. Four windows, also draped, faced\nthe side-street, affording an unobstructed view of Marm Hatch's back\nyard, where a number of inexplicable garments on a clothes-line were\nalways to be seen careering in the wind.\n\nThere was a lull just then in the ice-cream business, it being\ndinner-time, and we found the saloon unoccupied. When we had seated\nourselves around the largest marble-topped table, Charley Marden in a\nmanly voice ordered twelve sixpenny icecreams, \"strawberry and verneller\nmixed.\"\n\nIt was a magnificent sight, those twelve chilly glasses entering the\nroom on a waiter, the red and white custard rising from each glass like\na church-steeple, and the spoon-handle shooting up from the apex like\na spire. I doubt if a person of the nicest palate could have\ndistinguished, with his eyes shut, which was the vanilla and which the\nstrawberry; but if I could at this moment obtain a cream tasting as that\ndid, I would give five dollars for a very small quantity.\n\nWe fell to with a will, and so evenly balanced were our capabilities\nthat we finished our creams together, the spoons clinking in the glasses\nlike one spoon.\n\n\"Let's have some more!\" cried Charley Marden, with the air of Aladdin\nordering up a fresh hogshead of pearls and rubies. \"Tom Bailey, tell\nPettingil to send in another round.\"\n\nCould I credit my ears? I looked at him to see if he were in earnest.\nHe meant it. In a moment more I was leaning over the counter giving\ndirections for a second supply. Thinking it would make no difference to\nsuch a gorgeous young sybarite as Marden, I took the liberty of ordering\nninepenny creams this time.\n\nOn returning to the saloon, what was my horror at finding it empty!\n\nThere were the twelve cloudy glasses, standing in a circle on the sticky\nmarble slab, and not a boy to be seen. A pair of hands letting go their\nhold on the window-sill outside explained matters. I had been made a\nvictim.\n\nI couldn't stay and face Pettingil, whose peppery temper was well known\namong the boys. I hadn't a cent in the world to appease him. What should\nI do? I heard the clink of approaching glasses--the ninepenny creams.\nI rushed to the nearest window. It was only five feet to the ground. I\nthrew myself out as if I had been an old hat.\n\nLanding on my feet, I fled breathlessly down High Street, through\nWillow, and was turning into Brierwood Place when the sound of several\nvoices, calling to me in distress, stopped my progress.\n\n\"Look out, you fool! The mine! The mine!\" yelled the warning voices.\n\nSeveral men and boys were standing at the head of the street, making\ninsane gestures to me to avoid something. But I saw no mine, only in the\nmiddle of the road in front of me was a common flour-barrel, which, as\nI gazed at it, suddenly rose into the air with a terrific explosion.\nI felt myself thrown violently off my feet. I remember nothing else,\nexcepting that, as I went up, I caught a momentary glimpse of Ezra\nWingate leering through is shop window like an avenging spirit.\n\nThe mine that had wrought me woe was not properly a mine at all, but\nmerely a few ounces of powder placed under an empty keg or barrel and\nfired with a slow-match. Boys who didn't happen to have pistols or\ncannon generally burnt their powder in this fashion.\n\nFor an account of what followed I am indebted to hearsay, for I was\ninsensible when the people picked me up and carried me home on a shutter\nborrowed from the proprietor of Pettingil's saloon. I was supposed to\nbe killed, but happily (happily for me at least) I was merely stunned.\nI lay in a semi-unconscious state until eight o'clock that night, when\nI attempted to speak. Miss Abigail, who watched by the bedside, put\nher ear down to my lips and was saluted with these remarkable words:\n\"Strawberry and verneller mixed!\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! What is the boy saying?\" cried Miss Abigail.\n\n\"ROOTBEERSOLDHERE!\"\n\n     This inscription is copied from a triangular-shaped\n     piece of slate, still preserved in the garret of the Nutter\n     House, together with the pistol butt itself, which was\n     subsequently dug up for a postmortem examination.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nine--I Become an R. M. C.\n\n\nIn the course of ten days I recovered sufficiently from my injuries to\nattend school, where, for a little while, I was looked upon as a hero,\non account of having been blown up. What don't we make a hero of? The\ndistraction which prevailed in the classes the week preceding the Fourth\nhad subsided, and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities,\nexcepting a noticeable want of eyebrows on the part of Pepper Whitcomb\nand myself.\n\nIn August we had two weeks' vacation. It was about this time that I\nbecame a member of the Rivermouth Centipedes, a secret society composed\nof twelve of the Temple Grammar School boys. This was an honor to which\nI had long aspired, but, being a new boy, I was not admitted to the\nfraternity until my character had fully developed itself.\n\nIt was a very select society, the object of which I never fathomed,\nthough I was an active member of the body during the remainder of my\nresidence at Rivermouth, and at one time held the onerous position of F.\nC., First Centipede. Each of the elect wore a copper cent (some occult\nassociation being established between a cent apiece and a centipedes\nsuspended by a string round his neck). The medals were worn next the\nskin, and it was while bathing one day at Grave Point, with Jack Harris\nand Fred Langdon, that I had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch\nby a sight of these singular emblems. As soon as I ascertained the\nexistence of a boys' club, of course I was ready to die to join it. And\neventually I was allowed to join.\n\nThe initiation ceremony took place in Fred Langdon's barn, where I was\nsubmitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a\ntimorous boy. Before being led to the Grotto of Enchantment--such was the\nmodest title given to the loft over my friend's wood-house--my hands were\nsecurely pinioned, and my eyes covered with a thick silk handkerchief.\nAt the head of the stairs I was told in an unrecognizable, husky voice,\nthat it was not yet too late to retreat if I felt myself physically too\nweak to undergo the necessary tortures. I replied that I was not too\nweak, in a tone which I intended to be resolute, but which, in spite of\nme, seemed to come from the pit of my stomach.\n\n\"It is well!\" said the husky voice.\n\nI did not feel so sure about that; but, having made up my mind to be a\nCentipede, a Centipede I was bound to be. Other boys had passed through\nthe ordeal and lived, why should not I?\n\nA prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination and I was\nwondering what would come next, when a pistol fired off close by my car\ndeafened me for a moment. The unknown voice then directed me to take ten\nsteps forward and stop at the word halt. I took ten steps, and halted.\n\n\"Stricken mortal,\" said a second husky voice, more husky, if possible,\nthan the first, \"if you had advanced another inch, you would have\ndisappeared down an abyss three thousand feet deep!\"\n\nI naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information. A prick\nfrom some two-pronged instrument, evidently a pitchfork, gently\nchecked my retreat. I was then conducted to the brink of several other\nprecipices, and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms, where\nthe result would have been instant death if I had committed the least\nmistake. I have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by\ndismal groans from different parts of the grotto.\n\nFinally, I was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an\nincalculable height. Here I stood breathless while the bylaws were read\naloud. A more extraordinary code of laws never came from the brain of\nman. The penalties attached to the abject being who should reveal any\nof the secrets of the society were enough to make the blood run cold. A\nsecond pistol-shot was heard, the something I stood on sunk with a crash\nbeneath my feet and I fell two miles, as nearly as I could compute it.\nAt the same instant the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes, and I\nfound myself standing in an empty hogshead surrounded by twelve masked\nfigures fantastically dressed. One of the conspirators was really\nappalling with a tin sauce-pan on his head, and a tiger-skin sleigh-robe\nthrown over his shoulders. I scarcely need say that there were no\nvestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which I had passed so\ncautiously. My ascent had been to the top of the hogshead, and my\ndescent to the bottom thereof. Holding one another by the hand,\nand chanting a low dirge, the Mystic Twelve revolved about me. This\nconcluded the ceremony. With a merry shout the boys threw off their\nmasks, and I was declared a regularly installed member of the R. M. C.\n\nI afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club, for these\ninitiations, as you may imagine, were sometimes very comical spectacles,\nespecially when the aspirant for centipedal honors happened to be of a\ntimid disposition. If he showed the slightest terror, he was certain\nto be tricked unmercifully. One of our subsequent devices--a humble\ninvention of my own--was to request the blindfolded candidate to put out\nhis tongue, whereupon the First Centipede would say, in a low tone,\nas if not intended for the ear of the victim, \"Diabolus, fetch me the\nred-hot iron!\" The expedition with which that tongue would disappear was\nsimply ridiculous.\n\nOur meetings were held in various barns, at no stated periods, but as\ncircumstances suggested. Any member had a right to call a meeting. Each\nboy who failed to report himself was fined one cent. Whenever a member\nhad reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend,\nhe called a meeting. For instance, immediately on learning the death of\nHarry Blake's great-grandfather, I issued a call. By these simple and\ningenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition,\nsometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter.\n\nI have said that the society had no special object. It is true, there\nwas a tacit understanding among us that the Centipedes were to stand by\none another on all occasions, though I don't remember that they did; but\nfurther than this we had no purpose, unless it was to accomplish as\na body the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as\nindividuals. To mystify the staid and slow-going Rivermouthians was our\nfrequent pleasure. Several of our pranks won us such a reputation among\nthe townsfolk, that we were credited with having a large finger in\nwhatever went amiss in the place.\n\nOne morning, about a week after my admission into the secret order, the\nquiet citizens awoke to find that the signboards of all the principal\nstreets had changed places during the night. People who went trustfully\nto sleep in Currant Square opened their eyes in Honeysuckle Terrace.\nJones's Avenue at the north end had suddenly become Walnut Street,\nand Peanut Street was nowhere to be found. Confusion reigned. The town\nauthorities took the matter in hand without delay, and six of the Temple\nGrammar School boys were summoned to appear before justice Clapbam.\n\nHaving tearfully disclaimed to my grandfather all knowledge of\nthe transaction, I disappeared from the family circle, and was not\napprehended until late in the afternoon, when the Captain dragged me\nignominiously from the haymow and conducted me, more dead than alive,\nto the office of justice Clapham. Here I encountered five other pallid\nculprits, who had been fished out of divers coal-bins, garrets, and\nchicken-coops, to answer the demands of the outraged laws. (Charley\nMarden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his father's house,\nand looked like a recently exhumed mummy.)\n\nThere was not the least evidence against us; and, indeed, we were wholly\ninnocent of the offence. The trick, as was afterwards proved, had been\nplayed by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor. We\nwere indebted for our arrest to Master Conway, who had slyly dropped a\nhint, within the hearing of Selectman Mudge, to the effect that \"young\nBailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs.\"\nWhen he was called upon to make good his assertion, he was considerably\nmore terrified than the Centipedes, though they were ready to sink into\ntheir shoes.\n\nAt our next meeting it was unanimously resolved that Conway's animosity\nshould not be quietly submitted to. He had sought to inform against\nus in the stagecoach business; he had volunteered to carry Pettingil's\n\"little bill\" for twenty-four icecreams to Charley Marden's father; and\nnow he had caused us to be arraigned before justice Clapham on a charge\nequally groundless and painful. After much noisy discussion, a plan of\nretaliation was agreed upon.\n\nThere was a certain slim, mild apothecary in the town, by the name of\nMeeks. It was generally given out that Mr. Meeks had a vague desire\nto get married, but, being a shy and timorous youth, lacked the moral\ncourage to do so. It was also well known that the Widow Conway had not\nburied her heart with the late lamented. As to her shyness, that was not\nso clear. Indeed, her attentions to Mr. Meeks, whose mother she might\nhave been, were of a nature not to be misunderstood, and were not\nmisunderstood by anyone but Mr. Meeks himself.\n\nThe widow carried on a dress-making establishment at her residence on\nthe corner opposite Meeks's drug-store, and kept a wary eye on all the\nyoung ladies from Miss Dorothy Gibbs's Female Institute who patronized\nthe shop for soda-water, acid-drops, and slate-pencils. In the afternoon\nthe widow was usually seen seated, smartly dressed, at her window\nupstairs, casting destructive glances across the street--the artificial\nroses in her cap and her whole languishing manner saying as plainly as a\nlabel on a prescription, \"To be Taken Immediately!\" But Mr. Meeks didn't\ntake.\n\nThe lady's fondness, and the gentleman's blindness, were topics ably\nhandled at every sewing-circle in the town. It was through these two\nluckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common\nenemy. To kill less than three birds with one stone did not suit\nour sanguinary purpose. We disliked the widow not so much for her\nsentimentality as for being the mother of Bill Conway; we disliked Mr.\nMeeks, not because he was insipid, like his own syrups, but because the\nwidow loved him. Bill Conway we hated for himself.\n\nLate one dark Saturday night in September we carried our plan into\neffect. On the following morning, as the orderly citizens wended their\nway to church past the widow's abode, their sober faces relaxed at\nbeholding over her front door the well known gilt Mortar and Pestle\nwhich usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner;\nwhile the passers on that side of the street were equally amused and\nscandalized at seeing a placard bearing the following announcement\ntacked to the druggist's window-shutters:\n\nWanted, a Sempstress!\n\nThe naughty cleverness of the joke (which I should be sorry to defend)\nwas recognized at once. It spread like wildfire over the town, and,\nthough the mortar and the placard were speedily removed, our triumph\nwas complete. The whole community was on the broad grin, and our\nparticipation in the affair seemingly unsuspected.\n\nIt was those wicked soldiers at the fort!\n\n\n\n\nChapter Ten--I Fight Conway\n\n\nThere was one person, however, who cherished a strong suspicion that the\nCentipedes had had a hand in the business; and that person was Conway.\nHis red hair seemed to change to a livelier red, and his sallow cheeks\nto a deeper sallow, as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our\nslates the next day in school. He knew we were watching him, and made\nsundry mouths and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums.\n\nConway had an accomplishment peculiarly his own--that of throwing his\nthumbs out of joint at will. Sometimes while absorbed in study, or on\nbecoming nervous at recitation, he performed the feat unconsciously.\nThroughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a\nchronic state of dislocation, indicating great mental agitation on the\npart of the owner. We fully expected an outbreak from him at recess; but\nthe intermission passed off tranquilly, somewhat to our disappointment.\n\nAt the close of the afternoon session it happened that Binny Wallace\nand myself, having got swamped in our Latin exercise, were detained in\nschool for the purpose of refreshing our memories with a page of Mr.\nAndrews's perplexing irregular verbs. Binny Wallace finishing his task\nfirst, was dismissed. I followed shortly after, and, on stepping into\nthe playground, saw my little friend plastered, as it were, up against\nthe fence, and Conway standing in front of him ready to deliver a blow\non the upturned, unprotected face, whose gentleness would have stayed\nany arm but a coward's.\n\nSeth Rodgers, with both hands in his pockets, was leaning against the\npump lazily enjoying the sport; but on seeing me sweep across the\nyard, whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling, he called out\nlustily, \"Lay low, Conway! Here's young Bailey!\"\n\nConway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended\nfor his head. He reached forward one of his long arms--he had arms like\na windmill, that boy--and, grasping me by the hair, tore out quite a\nrespectable handful. The tears flew to my eyes, but they were not the\ntears of defeat; they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature\npaid to the departed tresses.\n\nIn a second my little jacket lay on the ground, and I stood on guard,\nresting lightly on my right leg and keeping my eye fixed steadily on\nConway's--in all of which I was faithfully following the instructions of\nPhil Adams, whose father subscribed to a sporting journal.\n\nConway also threw himself into a defensive attitude, and there we were,\nglaring at each other motionless, neither of us disposed to risk an\nattack, but both on the alert to resist one. There is no telling how\nlong we might have remained in that absurd position, had we not been\ninterrupted.\n\nIt was a custom with the larger pupils to return to the playground\nafter school, and play baseball until sundown. The town authorities\nhad prohibited ball-playing on the Square, and, there being no other\navailable place, the boys fell back perforce on the school-yard. Just at\nthis crisis a dozen or so of the Templars entered the gate, and, seeing\nat a glance the belligerent status of Conway and myself, dropped bat and\nball, and rushed to the spot where we stood.\n\n\"Is it a fight?\" asked Phil Adams, who saw by our freshness that we had\nnot yet got to work.\n\n\"Yes, it's a fight,\" I answered, \"unless Conway will ask Wallace's\npardon, promise never to hector me in future--and put back my hair!\"\n\nThis last condition was rather a staggerer.\n\n\"I sha'n't do nothing of the sort,\" said Conway, sulkily.\n\n\"Then the thing must go on,\" said Adams, with dignity. \"Rodgers, as I\nunderstand it, is your second, Conway? Bailey, come here. What's the row\nabout?\"\n\n\"He was thrashing Binny Wallace.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't,\" interrupted Conway; \"but I was going to because he knows\nwho put Meeks's mortar over our door. And I know well enough who did it;\nit was that sneaking little mulatter!\" pointing at me.\n\n\"O, by George!\" I cried, reddening at the insult.\n\n\"Cool is the word,\" said Adams, as he bound a handkerchief round my\nhead, and carefully tucked away the long straggling locks that offered a\ntempting advantage to the enemy. \"Who ever heard of a fellow with such\na head of hair going into action!\" muttered Phil, twitching the\nhandkerchief to ascertain if it were securely tied. He then loosened my\ngallowses (braces), and buckled them tightly above my hips. \"Now, then,\nbantam, never say die!\"\n\nConway regarded these business-like preparations with evident misgiving,\nfor he called Rodgers to his side, and had himself arrayed in a similar\nmanner, though his hair was cropped so close that you couldn't have\ntaken hold of it with a pair of tweezers.\n\n\"Is your man ready?\" asked Phil Adams, addressing Rodgers.\n\n\"Ready!\"\n\n\"Keep your back to the gate, Tom,\" whispered Phil in my car, \"and you'll\nhave the sun in his eyes.\"\n\nBehold us once more face to face, like David and the Philistine. Look\nat us as long as you may; for this is all you shall see of the combat.\nAccording to my thinking, the hospital teaches a better lesson than the\nbattle-field. I will tell you about my black eye, and my swollen lip, if\nyou will; but not a word of the fight.\n\nYou'll get no description of it from me, simply because I think it would\nprove very poor reading, and not because I consider my revolt against\nConway's tyranny unjustifiable.\n\nI had borne Conway's persecutions for many months with lamb-like\npatience. I might have shielded myself by appealing to Mr. Grimshaw; but\nno boy in the Temple Grammar School could do that without losing caste.\nWhether this was just or not doesn't matter a pin, since it was so--a\ntraditionary law of the place. The personal inconvenience I suffered\nfrom my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted on me indirectly\nby his persistent cruelty to little Binny Wallace. I should have lacked\nthe spirit of a hen if I had not resented it finally. I am glad that I\nfaced Conway, and asked no favors, and got rid of him forever. I am glad\nthat Phil Adams taught me to box, and I say to all youngsters: Learn to\nbox, to ride, to pull an oar, and to swim. The occasion may come round,\nwhen a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments\nwill be of service to you.\n\nIn one of the best books (1) ever written for boys are these words:\n\n\"Learn to box, then, as you learn to play cricket and football. Not one\nof you will be the worse, but very much the better, for learning to box\nwell. Should you never have to use it in earnest there's no exercise in\nthe world so good for the temper, and for the muscles of the back and\nlegs.\n\n\"As for fighting, keep out of it, if you can, by all means. When the\ntime comes, if ever it should, that you have to say 'Yes' or 'No' to a\nchallenge to fight, say 'No' if you can--only take care you make it plain\nto yourself why you say 'No.' It's a proof of the highest courage, if\ndone from true Christian motives. It's quite right and justifiable, if\ndone from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger. But don't say\n'No' because you fear a licking and say or think it's because you fear\nGod, for that's neither Christian nor honest. And if you do fight, fight\nit out; and don't give in while you can stand and see.\"\n\nAnd don't give in when you can't! see!  For I could stand very little,\nand see not at all (having pommelled the school pump for the last twenty\nseconds), when Conway retired from the field. As Phil Adams stepped up\nto shake hands with me, he received a telling blow in the stomach;\nfor all the fight was not out of me yet, and I mistook him for a new\nadversary.\n\nConvinced of my error, I accepted his congratulations, with those of the\nother boys, blandly and blindly. I remember that Binny Wallace wanted to\ngive me his silver pencil-case. The gentle soul had stood throughout the\ncontest with his face turned to the fence, suffering untold agony.\n\nA good wash at the pump, and a cold key applied to my eye, refreshed me\namazingly. Escorted by two or three of the schoolfellows, I walked home\nthrough the pleasant autumn twilight, battered but triumphant. As I went\nalong, my cap cocked on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye, I\nfelt that I was not only following my nose, but following it so closely,\nthat I was in some danger of treading on it. I seemed to have nose\nenough for the whole party. My left cheek, also, was puffed out like\na dumpling. I couldn't help saying to myself, \"If this is victory, how\nabout that other fellow?\"\n\n\"Tom,\" said Harry Blake, hesitating.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Did you see Mr. Grimshaw looking out of the recitation-room window just\nas we left the yard?\"\n\n\"No was he, though?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Then he must have seen all the row.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder.\"\n\n\"No, he didn't,\" broke in Adams, \"or he would have stopped it short\nmetre; but I guess be saw you pitching into the pump which you did\nuncommonly strong--and of course be smelt mischief directly.\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be helped now,\" I reflected.\n\n\"--As the monkey said when he fell out of the cocoanut tree,\" added\nCharley Marden, trying to make me laugh.\n\nIt was early candle-light when we reached the house. Miss Abigail,\nopening the front door, started back at my hilarious appearance. I\ntried to smile upon her sweetly, but the smile, rippling over my\nswollen cheek, and dying away like a spent wave on my nose, produced an\nexpression of which Miss Abigail declared she had never seen the like\nexcepting on the face of a Chinese idol.\n\nShe hustled me unceremoniously into the presence of my grandfather in\nthe sitting-room. Captain Nutter, as the recognized professional warrior\nof our family, could not consistently take me to task for fighting\nConway; nor was he disposed to do so; for the Captain was well aware of\nthe long-continued provocation I had endured.\n\n\"Ah, you rascal!\" cried the old gentleman, after hearing my story. \"Just\nlike me when I was young--always in one kind of trouble or another. I\nbelieve it runs in the family.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Miss Abigail, without the faintest expression on her\ncountenance, \"that a table-spoonful of hot-dro--\" The Captain interrupted\nMiss Abigail peremptorily, directing her to make a shade out of\ncardboard and black silk to tie over my eye. Miss Abigail must have been\npossessed with the idea that I had taken up pugilism as a profession,\nfor she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders.\n\n\"They'll be handy to have in the house,\" says Miss Abigail, grimly.\n\nOf course, so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by\nMr. Grimshaw. He had, as we suspected, witnessed the closing scene\nof the fight from the school-room window, and the next morning, after\nprayers, I was not wholly unprepared when Master Conway and myself\nwere called up to the desk for examination. Conway, with a piece of\ncourt-plaster in the shape of a Maltese cross on his right cheek, and\nI with the silk patch over my left eye, caused a general titter through\nthe room.\n\n\"Silence!\" said Mr. Grimshaw, sharply.\n\nAs the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of\nBailey versus Conway, I shall not report the trial further than to say\nthat Adams, Marden, and several other pupils testified to the fact that\nConway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the Temple School.\nTheir evidence also went to show that Conway was a quarrelsome character\ngenerally. Bad for Conway. Seth Rodgers, on the part of his friend,\nproved that I had struck the first blow. That was bad for me.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Binny Wallace, holding up his hand for\npermission to speak, \"Bailey didn't fight on his own account; he fought\non my account, and, if you please, sir, I am the boy to be blamed, for I\nwas the cause of the trouble.\"\n\nThis drew out the story of Conway's harsh treatment of the smaller boys.\nAs Binny related the wrongs of his playfellows, saying very little\nof his own grievances, I noticed that Mr. Grimshaw's hand, unknown to\nhimself perhaps, rested lightly from time to time on Wallace's sunny\nhair. The examination finished, Mr. Grimshaw leaned on the desk\nthoughtfully for a moment and then said:\n\n\"Every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to\nfight. If one boy maltreats another, within school-bounds, or within\nschool-hours, that is a matter for me to settle. The case should be laid\nbefore me. I disapprove of tale-bearing, I never encourage it in\nthe slightest degree; but when one pupil systematically persecutes a\nschoolmate, it is the duty of some head-boy to inform me. No pupil has a\nright to take the law into his own hands. If there is any fighting to be\ndone, I am the person to be consulted. I disapprove of boys' fighting;\nit is unnecessary and unchristian. In the present instance, I consider\nevery large boy in this school at fault, but as the offence is one of\nomission rather than commission, my punishment must rest only on the two\nboys convicted of misdemeanor. Conway loses his recess for a month,\nand Bailey has a page added to his Latin lessons for the next four\nrecitations. I now request Bailey and Conway to shake hands in the\npresence of the school, and acknowledge their regret at what has\noccurred.\"\n\nConway and I approached each other slowly and cautiously, as if we were\nbent upon another hostile collision. We clasped hands in the tamest\nmanner imaginable, and Conway mumbled, \"I'm sorry I fought with you.\"\n\n\"I think you are,\" I replied, drily, \"and I'm sorry I had to thrash\nyou.\"\n\n\"You can go to your seats,\" said Mr. Grimshaw, turning his face aside to\nhide a smile. I am sure my apology was a very good one.\n\nI never had any more trouble with Conway. He and his shadow, Seth\nRodgers, gave me a wide berth for many months. Nor was Binny Wallace\nsubjected to further molestation. Miss Abigail's sanitary stores,\nincluding a bottle of opodeldoc, were never called into requisition. The\nsix black silk patches, with their elastic strings, are still dangling\nfrom a beam in the garret of the Nutter House, waiting for me to get\ninto fresh difficulties.\n\n\n    (1)\"Tom Brown's School Days at Rugby\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven--All About Gypsy\n\n\nThis record of my life at Rivermouth would be strangely incomplete did I\nnot devote an entire chapter to Gypsy. I had other pets, of course; for\nwhat healthy boy could long exist without numerous friends in the animal\nkingdom? I had two white mice that were forever gnawing their way out\nof a pasteboard chateau, and crawling over my face when I lay asleep. I\nused to keep the pink-eyed little beggars in my bedroom, greatly to the\nannoyance of Miss Abigail, who was constantly fancying that one of the\nmice had secreted itself somewhere about her person.\n\nI also owned a dog, a terrier, who managed in some inscrutable way\nto pick a quarrel with the moon, and on bright nights kept up such a\nki-yi-ing in our back garden, that we were finally forced to dispose\nof him at private sale. He was purchased by Mr. Oxford, the butcher.\nI protested against the arrangement and ever afterwards, when we had\nsausages from Mr. Oxford's shop, I made believe I detected in them\ncertain evidences that Cato had been foully dealt with.\n\nOf birds I had no end, robins, purple-martins, wrens, bulfinches,\nbobolinks, ringdoves, and pigeons. At one time I took solid comfort\nin the iniquitous society of a dissipated old parrot, who talked so\nterribly, that the Rev. Wibird Hawkins, happening to get a sample of\nPoll's vituperative powers, pronounced him \"a benighted heathen,\" and\nadvised the Captain to get rid of him. A brace of turtles supplanted\nthe parrot in my affections; the turtles gave way to rabbits; and the\nrabbits in turn yielded to the superior charms of a small monkey, which\nthe Captain bought of a sailor lately from the coast of Africa.\n\nBut Gypsy was the prime favorite, in spite of many rivals. I never grew\nweary of her. She was the most knowing little thing in the world. Her\nproper sphere in life--and the one to which she ultimately attained--was\nthe saw-dust arena of a travelling circus. There was nothing short of\nthe three R's, reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic, that Gypsy couldn't be\ntaught. The gift of speech was not hers, but the faculty of thought was.\n\nMy little friend, to be sure, was not exempt from certain graceful\nweaknesses, inseparable, perhaps, from the female character. She was\nvery pretty, and she knew it. She was also passionately fond of dress--by\nwhich I mean her best harness. When she had this on, her curvetings\nand prancings were laughable, though in ordinary tackle she went along\ndemurely enough. There was something in the enamelled leather and the\nsilver-washed mountings that chimed with her artistic sense. To have her\nmane braided, and a rose or a pansy stuck into her forelock, was to make\nher too conceited for anything.\n\nShe had another trait not rare among her sex. She liked the attentions\nof young gentlemen, while the society of girls bored her. She would drag\nthem, sulkily, in the cart; but as for permitting one of them in the\nsaddle, the idea was preposterous. Once when Pepper Whitcomb's sister,\nin spite of our remonstrances, ventured to mount her, Gypsy gave a\nlittle indignant neigh, and tossed the gentle Emma heels over head in no\ntime. But with any of the boys the mare was as docile as a lamb.\n\nHer treatment of the several members of the family was comical. For the\nCaptain she entertained a wholesome respect, and was always on her good\nbehavior when he was around. As to Miss Abigail, Gypsy simply laughed at\nher--literally laughed, contracting her upper lip and displaying all her\nsnow-white teeth, as if something about Miss Abigail struck her, Gypsy,\nas being extremely ridiculous.\n\nKitty Collins, for some reason or another, was afraid of the pony, or\npretended to be. The sagacious little animal knew it, of course, and\nfrequently, when Kitty was banging out clothes near the stable, the mare\nbeing loose in the yard, would make short plunges at her. Once Gypsy\nseized the basket of clothespins with her teeth, and rising on her hind\nlegs, pawing the air with her fore feet followed Kitty clear up to the\nscullery steps.\n\nThat part of the yard was shut off from the rest by a gate; but no gate\nwas proof against Gypsy's ingenuity. She could let down bars, lift up\nlatches, draw bolts, and turn all sorts of buttons. This accomplishment\nrendered it hazardous for Miss Abigail or Kitty to leave any eatables on\nthe kitchen table near the window. On one occasion Gypsy put in her head\nand lapped up six custard pies that had been placed by the casement to\ncool.\n\nAn account of my young lady's various pranks would fill a thick\nvolume. A favorite trick of hers, on being requested to \"walk like Miss\nAbigail,\" was to assume a little skittish gait so true to nature\nthat Miss Abigail herself was obliged to admit the cleverness of the\nimitation.\n\nThe idea of putting Gypsy through a systematic course of instruction\nwas suggested to me by a visit to the circus which gave an annual\nperformance in Rivermouth. This show embraced among its attractions a\nnumber of trained Shetland ponies, and I determined that Gypsy should\nlikewise have the benefit of a liberal education. I succeeded in\nteaching her to waltz, to fire a pistol by tugging at a string tied\nto the trigger, to lie down dead, to wink one eye, and to execute many\nother feats of a difficult nature. She took to her studies admirably,\nand enjoyed the whole thing as much as anyone.\n\nThe monkey was a perpetual marvel to Gypsy. They became bosom-friends\nin an incredibly brief period, and were never easy out of each other's\nsight. Prince Zany--that's what Pepper Whitcomb and I christened him one\nday, much to the disgust of the monkey, who bit a piece out of Pepper's\nnose--resided in the stable, and went to roost every night on the pony's\nback, where I usually found him in the morning. Whenever I rode out, I\nwas obliged to secure his Highness the Prince with a stout cord to the\nfence, he chattering all the time like a madman.\n\nOne afternoon as I was cantering through the crowded part of the town, I\nnoticed that the people in the street stopped, stared at me, and fell to\nlaughing. I turned round in the saddle, and there was Zany, with a great\nburdock leaf in his paw, perched up behind me on the crupper, as solemn\nas a judge.\n\nAfter a few months, poor Zany sickened mysteriously, and died. The dark\nthought occurred to me then, and comes back to me now with redoubled\nforce, that Miss Abigail must have given him some hot-drops. Zany left\na large circle of sorrowing friends, if not relatives. Gypsy, I think,\nnever entirely recovered from the shock occasioned by his early\ndemise. She became fonder of me, though; and one of her cunningest\ndemonstrations was to escape from the stable-yard, and trot up to the\ndoor of the Temple Grammar School, where I would discover her at recess\npatiently waiting for me, with her fore feet on the second step, and\nwisps of straw standing out all over her, like quills upon the fretful\nporcupine.\n\nI should fail if I tried to tell you how dear the pony was to me. Even\nhard, unloving men become attached to the horses they take care of; so\nI, who was neither unloving nor hard, grew to love every glossy hair of\nthe pretty little creature that depended on me for her soft straw bed\nand her daily modicum of oats. In my prayer at night I never forgot to\nmention Gypsy with the rest of the family--generally setting forth her\nclaims first.\n\nWhatever relates to Gypsy belongs properly to this narrative; therefore\nI offer no apology for rescuing from oblivion, and boldly printing here\na short composition which I wrote in the early part of my first quarter\nat the Temple Grammar School. It is my maiden effort in a difficult art,\nand is, perhaps, lacking in those graces of thought and style which are\nreached only after the severest practice.\n\nEvery Wednesday morning, on entering school, each pupil was expected\nto lay his exercise on Mr. Grimshaw's desk; the subject was usually\nselected by Mr. Grimshaw himself, the Monday previous. With a humor\ncharacteristic of him, our teacher had instituted two prizes, one for\nthe best and the other for the worst composition of the month. The first\nprize consisted of a penknife, or a pencil-case, or some such article\ndear to the heart of youth; the second prize entitled the winner to wear\nfor an hour or two a sort of conical paper cap, on the front of which\nwas written, in tall letters, this modest admission: I AM A DUNCE! The\ncompetitor who took prize No. 2. wasn't generally an object of envy.\n\nMy pulse beat high with pride and expectation that Wednesday morning, as\nI laid my essay, neatly folded, on the master's table. I firmly decline\nto say which prize I won; but here's the composition to speak for\nitself.\n\nIt is no small-author vanity that induces me to publish this stray\nleaf of natural history. I lay it before our young folks, not for\ntheir admiration, but for their criticism. Let each reader take\nhis lead-pencil and remorselessly correct the orthography, the\ncapitalization, and the punctuation of the essay. I shall not feel hurt\nat seeing my treatise cut all to pieces; though I think highly of the\nproduction, not on account of its literary excellence, which I candidly\nadmit is not overpowering, but because it was written years and years\nago about Gypsy, by a little fellow who, when I strive to recall him,\nappears to me like a reduced ghost of my present self.\n\nI am confident that any reader who has ever had pets, birds or animals,\nwill forgive me for this brief digression.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twelve--Winter at Rivermouth\n\n\n\"I guess we're going to have a regular old-fashioned snowstorm,\"\nsaid Captain Nutter, one bleak December morning, casting a peculiarly\nnautical glance skyward.\n\nThe Captain was always hazarding prophecies about the weather, which\nsomehow never turned out according to his prediction. The vanes on the\nchurch-steeples seemed to take fiendish pleasure in humiliating the\ndear old gentleman. If he said it was going to be a clear day, a dense\nsea-fog was pretty certain to set in before noon. Once he caused a\nprotracted drought by assuring us every morning, for six consecutive\nweeks, that it would rain in a few hours. But, sure enough, that\nafternoon it began snowing.\n\nNow I had not seen a snow-storm since I was eighteen months old, and of\ncourse remembered nothing about it. A boy familiar from his infancy with\nthe rigors of our New England winters can form no idea of the impression\nmade on me by this natural phenomenon. My delight and surprise were as\nboundless as if the heavy gray sky had let down a shower of pond\nlilies and white roses, instead of snow-flakes. It happened to be a\nhalf-holiday, so I had nothing to do but watch the feathery crystals\nwhirling hither and thither through the air. I stood by the sitting-room\nwindow gazing at the wonder until twilight shut out the novel scene.\n\nWe had had several slight flurries of hail and snow before, but this was\na regular nor'easter.\n\nSeveral inches of snow had already fallen. The rose-bushes at the door\ndrooped with the weight of their magical blossoms, and the two posts\nthat held the garden gate were transformed into stately Turks, with\nwhite turbans, guarding the entrance to the Nutter House.\n\nThe storm increased at sundown, and continued with unabated violence\nthrough the night. The next morning, when I jumped out of bed, the sun\nwas shining brightly, the cloudless heavens wore the tender azure of\nJune, and the whole earth lay muffled up to the eyes, as it were, in a\nthick mantle of milk-white down.\n\nIt was a very deep snow. The Oldest Inhabitant (what would become of a\nNew England town or village without its oldest Inhabitant?) overhauled\nhis almanacs, and pronounced it the deepest snow we had had for twenty\nyears. It couldn't have been much deeper without smothering us all.\nOur street was a sight to be seen, or, rather, it was a sight not to\nbe seen; for very little street was visible. One huge drift completely\nbanked up our front door and half covered my bedroom window.\n\nThere was no school that day, for all the thoroughfares were impassable.\nBy twelve o'clock, however, the great snowploughs, each drawn by four\nyokes of oxen, broke a wagon-path through the principal streets; but the\nfoot-passengers had a hard time of it floundering in the arctic drifts.\n\nThe Captain and I cut a tunnel, three feet wide and six feet high, from\nour front door to the sidewalk opposite. It was a beautiful cavern, with\nits walls and roof inlaid with mother-of-pearl and diamonds. I am sure\nthe ice palace of the Russian Empress, in Cowper's poem, was not a more\nsuperb piece of architecture.\n\nThe thermometer began falling shortly before sunset and we had the\nbitterest cold night I ever experienced. This brought out the Oldest\nInhabitant again the next day--and what a gay old boy he was for deciding\neverything! Our tunnel was turned into solid ice. A crust thick enough\nto bear men and horses had formed over the snow everywhere, and the air\nwas alive with merry sleigh-bells. Icy stalactites, a yard long, bung\nfrom the eaves of the house, and the Turkish sentinels at the gate\nlooked as if they had given up all hopes of ever being relieved from\nduty.\n\nSo the winter set in cold and glittering. Everything out-of-doors was\nsheathed in silver mail. To quote from Charley Marden, it was \"cold\nenough to freeze the tail off a brass monkey,\"--an observation which\nseemed to me extremely happy, though I knew little or nothing concerning\nthe endurance of brass monkeys, having never seen one.\n\nI had looked forward to the advent of the season with grave\napprehensions, nerving myself to meet dreary nights and monotonous\ndays; but summer itself was not more jolly than winter at Rivermouth.\nSnow-balling at school, skating on the Mill Pond, coasting by moonlight,\nlong rides behind Gypsy in a brand-new little sleigh built expressly for\nher, were sports no less exhilarating than those which belonged to the\nsunny months. And then Thanksgiving! The nose of Memory--why shouldn't\nMemory have a nose?--dilates with pleasure over the rich perfume of Miss\nAbigail's forty mince-pies, each one more delightful than the other,\nlike the Sultan's forty wives. Christmas was another red-letter day,\nthough it was not so generally observed in New England as it is now.\n\nThe great wood-fire in the tiled chimney-place made our sitting-room\nvery cheerful of winter nights. When the north-wind howled about\nthe eaves, and the sharp fingers of the sleet tapped against the\nwindow-panes, it was nice to be so warmly sheltered from the storm. A\ndish of apples and a pitcher of chilly cider were always served during\nthe evening. The Captain had a funny way of leaning back in the chair,\nand eating his apple with his eyes closed. Sometimes I played dominos\nwith him, and sometimes Miss Abigail read aloud to us, pronouncing \"to\"\ntoe, and sounding all the eds.\n\nIn a former chapter I alluded to Miss Abigail's managing propensities.\nShe had affected many changes in the Nutter House before I came there\nto live; but there was one thing against which she had long contended\nwithout being able to overcome. This was the Captain's pipe. On\nfirst taking command of the household, she prohibited smoking in the\nsitting-room, where it had been the old gentleman's custom to take a\nwhiff or two of the fragrant weed after meals. The edict went forth--and\nso did the pipe. An excellent move, no doubt; but then the house was\nhis, and if he saw fit to keep a tub of tobacco burning in the middle of\nthe parlor floor, he had a perfect right to do so. However, he humored\nher in this as in other matters, and smoked by stealth, like a guilty\ncreature, in the barn, or about the gardens. That was practicable in\nsummer, but in winter the Captain was hard put to it. When he couldn't\nstand it longer, he retreated to his bedroom and barricaded the door.\nSuch was the position of affairs at the time of which I write.\n\nOne morning, a few days after the great snow, as Miss Abigail was\ndusting the chronometer in the ball, she beheld Captain Nutter slowly\ndescending the staircase, with a long clay pipe in his mouth. Miss\nAbigail could hardly credit her own eyes.\n\n\"Dan'el!\" she gasped, retiring heavily on the hat-rack.\n\nThe tone of reproach with which this word was uttered failed to produce\nthe slightest effect on the Captain, who merely removed the pipe from\nhis lips for an instant, and blew a cloud into the chilly air. The\nthermometer stood at two degrees below zero in our hall.\n\n\"Dan'el!\" cried Miss Abigail, hysterically--\"Dan'el, don't come near me!\"\nWhereupon she fainted away; for the smell of tobacco-smoke always made\nher deadly sick.\n\nKitty Collins rushed from the kitchen with a basin of water, and set to\nwork bathing Miss Abigail's temples and chafing her hands. I thought\nmy grandfather rather cruel, as he stood there with a half-smile on his\ncountenance, complacently watching Miss Abigail's sufferings. When she\nwas \"brought to,\" the Captain sat down beside her, and, with a lovely\ntwinkle in his eye, said softly:\n\n\"Abigail, my dear, there wasn't any tobacco in that Pipe! It was a new\npipe. I fetched it down for Tom to blow soap-bubbles with.\"\n\nAt these words Kitty Collins hurried away, her features-working\nstrangely. Several minutes later I came upon her in the scullery with\nthe greater portion of a crash towel stuffed into her mouth. \"Miss\nAbygil smelt the terbacca with her oi!\" cried Kitty, partially removing\nthe cloth, and then immediately stopping herself up again.\n\nThe Captain's joke furnished us--that is, Kitty and me--with mirth for\nmany a day; as to Miss Abigail, I think she never wholly pardoned\nhim. After this, Captain Nutter gradually gave up smoking, which is an\nuntidy, injurious, disgraceful, and highly pleasant habit.\n\nA boy's life in a secluded New England town in winter does not afford\nmany points for illustration. Of course he gets his ears or toes\nfrost-bitten; of course he smashes his sled against another boy's; of\ncourse be bangs his bead on the ice; and he's a lad of no enterprise\nwhatever, if he doesn't manage to skate into an eel-hole, and be brought\nhome half drowned. All these things happened to me; but, as they lack\nnovelty, I pass them over, to tell you about the famous snow-fort which\nwe built on Slatter's Hill.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen--The Snow Fort on Slatter's Hill\n\n\nThe memory of man, even that of the Oldest Inhabitant, runneth not back\nto the time when there did not exist a feud between the North End and\nthe South End boys of Rivermouth.\n\nThe origin of the feud is involved in mystery; it is impossible to say\nwhich party was the first aggressor in the far-off anterevolutionary\nages; but the fact remains that the youngsters of those antipodal\nsections entertained a mortal hatred for each other, and that this\nhatred had been handed down from generation to generation, like Miles\nStandish's punch-bowl.\n\nI know not what laws, natural or unnatural, regulated the warmth of the\nquarrel; but at some seasons it raged more violently than at others.\nThis winter both parties were unusually lively and antagonistic.\nGreat was the wrath of the South-Enders, when they discovered that the\nNorth-Enders had thrown up a fort on the crown of Slatter's Hill.\n\nSlatter's Hill, or No-man's-land, as it was generally called, was a\nrise of ground covering, perhaps, an acre and a quarter, situated on\nan imaginary line, marking the boundary between the two districts. An\nimmense stratum of granite, which here and there thrust out a wrinkled\nboulder, prevented the site from being used for building purposes. The\nstreet ran on either side of the hill, from one part of which a quantity\nof rock had been removed to form the underpinning of the new jail.\nThis excavation made the approach from that point all but impossible,\nespecially when the ragged ledges were a-glitter with ice. You see what\na spot it was for a snow-fort.\n\nOne evening twenty or thirty of the North-Enders quietly took possession\nof Slatter's Hill, and threw up a strong line of breastworks, something\nafter this shape:\n\n(Ft Slatter graphic)\n\nThe rear of the entrenchment, being protected by the quarry, was left\nopen. The walls were four feet high, and twenty-two inches thick,\nstrengthened at the angles by stakes driven firmly into the ground.\n\nFancy the rage of the South-Enders the next day, when they spied our\nsnowy citadel, with Jack Harris's red silk pocket handkerchief floating\ndefiantly from the flag-staff.\n\nIn less than an hour it was known all over town, in military circles at\nleast, that the \"Puddle-dockers\" and the \"River-rats\" (these were the\nderisive sub-titles bestowed on our South-End foes) intended to attack\nthe fort that Saturday afternoon.\n\nAt two o'clock all the fighting boys of the Temple Grammar School,\nand as many recruits as we could muster, lay behind the walls of Fort\nSlatter, with three hundred compact snowballs piled up in pyramids,\nawaiting the approach of the enemy. The enemy was not slow in making his\napproach--fifty strong, headed by one Mat Ames. Our forces were under the\ncommand of General J. Harris.\n\nBefore the action commenced, a meeting was arranged between the rival\ncommanders, who drew up and signed certain rules and regulations\nrespecting the conduct of the battle. As it was impossible for the\nNorth-Enders to occupy the fort permanently, it was stipulated that the\nSouth-Enders should assault it only on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons\nbetween the hours of two and six. For them to take possession of the\nplace at any other time was not to constitute a capture, but on the\ncontrary was to be considered a dishonorable and cowardly act.\n\nThe North-Enders, on the other hand, agreed to give up the fort whenever\nten of the storming party succeeded in obtaining at one time a footing\non the parapet, and were able to hold the same for the space of two\nminutes. Both sides were to abstain from putting pebbles into their\nsnow-balls, nor was it permissible to use frozen ammunition. A snow-ball\nsoaked in water and left out to cool was a projectile which in previous\nyears had been resorted to with disastrous results.\n\nThese preliminaries settled, the commanders retired to their respective\ncorps. The interview had taken place on the hillside between the\nopposing lines.\n\nGeneral Harris divided his men into two bodies; the first comprised the\nmost skilful marksmen, or gunners; the second, the reserve force, was\ncomposed of the strongest boys, whose duty it was to repel the scaling\nparties, and to make occasional sallies for the purpose of capturing\nprisoners, who were bound by the articles of treaty to faithfully serve\nunder our flag until they were exchanged at the close of the day.\n\nThe repellers were called light infantry; but when they carried on\noperations beyond the fort they became cavalry. It was also their duty,\nwhen not otherwise engaged, to manufacture snow-balls. The General's\nstaff consisted of five Templars (I among the number, with the rank of\nMajor), who carried the General's orders and looked after the wounded.\n\nGeneral Mat Ames, a veteran commander, was no less wide-awake in the\ndisposition of his army. Five companies, each numbering but six men,\nin order not to present too big a target to our sharpshooters, were to\ncharge the fort from different points, their advance being covered by a\nheavy fire from the gunners posted in the rear. Each scaler was provided\nwith only two rounds of ammunition, which were not to be used until he\nhad mounted the breastwork and could deliver his shots on our heads.\n\nThe drawing below represents the interior of the fort just previous to\nthe assault. Nothing on earth could represent the state of things after\nthe first volley.\n\n(Fort Slatter detail graphic)\n\nThe thrilling moment had now arrived. If I had been going into a real\nengagement I could not have been more deeply impressed by the importance\nof the occasion.\n\nThe fort opened fire first--a single ball from the dexterous band of\nGeneral Harris taking General Ames in the very pit of his stomach. A\ncheer went up from Fort Slatter. In an instant the air was thick with\nflying missiles, in the midst of which we dimly descried the storming\nparties sweeping up the hill, shoulder to shoulder. The shouts of the\nleaders, and the snowballs bursting like shells about our ears, made it\nvery lively.\n\nNot more than a dozen of the enemy succeeded in reaching the crest of\nthe hill; five of these clambered upon the icy walls, where they were\ninstantly grabbed by the legs and jerked into the fort. The rest retired\nconfused and blinded by our well-directed fire.\n\nWhen General Harris (with his right eye bunged up) said, \"Soldiers, I am\nproud of you!\" my heart swelled in my bosom.\n\nThe victory, however, had not been without its price. Six North-Enders,\nhaving rushed out to harass the discomfited enemy, were gallantly\ncut off by General Ames and captured. Among these were Lieutenant P.\nWhitcomb (who had no business to join in the charge, being weak in the\nknees), and Captain Fred Langdon, of General Harris's staff. Whitcomb\nwas one of the most notable shots on our side, though he was not much\nto boast of in a rough-and-tumble fight, owing to the weakness before\nmentioned. General Ames put him among the gunners, and we were quickly\nmade aware of the loss we had sustained, by receiving a frequent artful\nball which seemed to light with unerring instinct on any nose that was\nthe least bit exposed. I have known one of Pepper's snow-balls, fired\npointblank, to turn a corner and hit a boy who considered himself\nabsolutely safe.\n\nBut we had no time for vain regrets. The battle raged. Already there\nwere two bad cases of black eye, and one of nosebleed, in the hospital.\n\nIt was glorious excitement, those pell-mell onslaughts and hand-to-hand\nstruggles. Twice we were within an ace of being driven from our\nstronghold, when General Harris and his staff leaped recklessly upon the\nramparts and hurled the besiegers heels over head down hill.\n\nAt sunset, the garrison of Fort Slatter was still unconquered, and the\nSouth-Enders, in a solid phalanx, marched off whistling \"Yankee Doodle,\"\nwhile we cheered and jeered them until they were out of hearing.\n\nGeneral Ames remained behind to effect an exchange of prisoners. We held\nthirteen of his men, and he eleven of ours. General Ames proposed to\ncall it an even thing, since many of his eleven prisoners were officers,\nwhile nearly all our thirteen captives were privates. A dispute arising\non this point, the two noble generals came to fisticuffs, and in\nthe fracas our brave commander got his remaining well eye badly damaged.\nThis didn't prevent him from writing a general order the next day, on a\nslate, in which he complimented the troops on their heroic behavior.\n\nOn the following Wednesday the siege was renewed. I forget whether it\nwas on that afternoon or the next that we lost Fort Slatter; but lose it\nwe did, with much valuable ammunition and several men. After a series\nof desperate assaults, we forced General Ames to capitulate; and he, in\nturn, made the place too hot to hold us. So from day to day the tide\nof battle surged to and fro, sometimes favoring our arms, and sometimes\nthose of the enemy.\n\nGeneral Ames handled his men with great skill; his deadliest foe could\nnot deny that. Once he outgeneralled our commander in the following\nmanner: He massed his gunners on our left and opened a brisk fire, under\ncover of which a single company (six men) advanced on that angle of the\nfort. Our reserves on the right rushed over to defend the threatened\npoint. Meanwhile, four companies of the enemy's scalers made a detour\nround the foot of the hill, and dashed into Fort Slatter without\nopposition. At the same moment General Ames's gunners closed in on our\nleft, and there we were between two fires. Of course we had to vacate\nthe fort. A cloud rested on General Harris's military reputation until\nhis superior tactics enabled him to dispossess the enemy.\n\nAs the winter wore on, the war-spirit waxed fiercer and fiercer. At\nlength the provision against using heavy substances in the snow-balls\nwas disregarded. A ball stuck full of sand-bird shot came tearing into\nFort Slatter. In retaliation, General Harris ordered a broadside of\nshells; i. e. snow-balls containing marbles. After this, both sides\nnever failed to freeze their ammunition.\n\nIt was no longer child's play to march up to the walls of Fort Slatter,\nnor was the position of the besieged less perilous. At every assault\nthree or four boys on each side were disabled. It was not an infrequent\noccurrence for the combatants to hold up a flag of truce while they\nremoved some insensible comrade.\n\nMatters grew worse and worse. Seven North-Enders had been seriously\nwounded, and a dozen South-Enders were reported on the sick list.\nThe selectmen of the town awoke to the fact of what was going on, and\ndetailed a posse of police to prevent further disturbance. The boys at\nthe foot of the hill, South-Enders as it happened, finding themselves\nassailed in the rear and on the flank, turned round and attempted\nto beat off the watchmen. In this they were sustained by numerous\nvolunteers from the fort, who looked upon the interference as\ntyrannical.\n\nThe watch were determined fellows, and charged the boys valiantly,\ndriving them all into the fort, where we made common cause, fighting\nside by side like the best of friends. In vain the four guardians of the\npeace rushed up the hill, flourishing their clubs and calling upon us to\nsurrender. They could not get within ten yards of the fort, our fire was\nso destructive. In one of the onsets a man named Mugridge, more valorous\nthan his peers, threw himself upon the parapet, when he was seized by\ntwenty pairs of hands, and dragged inside the breastwork, where fifteen\nboys sat down on him to keep him quiet.\n\nPerceiving that it was impossible with their small number to dislodge\nus, the watch sent for reinforcements. Their call was responded to, not\nonly by the whole constabulary force (eight men), but by a numerous\nbody of citizens, who had become alarmed at the prospect of a riot. This\nformidable array brought us to our senses: we began to think that maybe\ndiscretion was the better part of valor. General Harris and General\nAmes, with their respective staffs, held a council of war in the\nhospital, and a backward movement was decided on. So, after one grand\nfarewell volley, we fled, sliding, jumping, rolling, tumbling down the\nquarry at the rear of the fort, and escaped without losing a man.\n\nBut we lost Fort Slatter forever. Those battle-scarred ramparts were\nrazed to the ground, and humiliating ashes sprinkled over the historic\nspot, near which a solitary lynx-eyed policeman was seen prowling from\ntime to time during the rest of the winter.\n\nThe event passed into a legend, and afterwards, when later instances of\npluck and endurance were spoken of, the boys would say, \"By golly! You\nought to have been at the fights on Slatter's Hill!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fourteen--The Cruise of the Dolphin\n\n\nIt was spring again. The snow had faded away like a dream, and we were\nawakened, so to speak, by the sudden chirping of robins in our back\ngarden. Marvellous transformation of snowdrifts into lilacs, wondrous\nmiracle of the unfolding leaf! We read in the Holy Book how our Saviour,\nat the marriage-feast, changed the water into wine; we pause and wonder;\nbut every hour a greater miracle is wrought at our very feet, if we have\nbut eyes to see it.\n\nI had now been a year at Rivermouth. If you do not know what sort of boy\nI was, it is not because I haven't been frank with you. Of my progress\nat school I say little; for this is a story, pure and simple, and not\na treatise on education. Behold me, however, well up in most of the\nclasses. I have worn my Latin grammar into tatters, and am in the first\nbook of Virgil. I interlard my conversation at home with easy quotations\nfrom that poet, and impress Captain Nutter with a lofty notion of my\nlearning. I am likewise translating Les Aventures de Telemaque from the\nFrench, and shall tackle Blair's Lectures the next term. I am ashamed of\nmy crude composition about The Horse, and can do better now. Sometimes\nmy head almost aches with the variety of my knowledge. I consider Mr.\nGrimshaw the greatest scholar that ever lived, and I don't know which I\nwould rather be--a learned man like him, or a circus rider.\n\nMy thoughts revert to this particular spring more frequently than to any\nother period of my boyhood, for it was marked by an event that left an\nindelible impression on my memory. As I pen these pages, I feel that\nI am writing of something which happened yesterday, so vividly it all\ncomes back to me.\n\nEvery Rivermouth boy looks upon the sea as being in some way mixed up\nwith his destiny. While he is yet a baby lying in his cradle, he hears\nthe dull, far-off boom of the breakers; when he is older, he wanders by\nthe sandy shore, watching the waves that come plunging up the beach\nlike white-maned seahorses, as Thoreau calls them; his eye follows the\nlessening sail as it fades into the blue horizon, and he burns for the\ntime when he shall stand on the quarter-deck of his own ship, and go\nsailing proudly across that mysterious waste of waters.\n\nThen the town itself is full of hints and flavors of the sea. The gables\nand roofs of the houses facing eastward are covered with red rust, like\nthe flukes of old anchors; a salty smell pervades the air, and dense\ngray fogs, the very breath of Ocean, periodically creep up into the\nquiet streets and envelop everything. The terrific storms that lash\nthe coast; the kelp and spars, and sometimes the bodies of drowned men,\ntossed on shore by the scornful waves; the shipyards, the wharves, and\nthe tawny fleet of fishing-smacks yearly fitted out at Rivermouth--these\nthings, and a hundred other, feed the imagination and fill the brain of\nevery healthy boy with dreams of adventure. He learns to swim almost\nas soon as he can walk; he draws in with his mother's milk the art of\nhandling an oar: he is born a sailor, whatever he may turn out to be\nafterwards.\n\nTo own the whole or a portion of a row-boat is his earliest ambition.\nNo wonder that I, born to this life, and coming back to it with freshest\nsympathies, should have caught the prevailing infection. No wonder I\nlonged to buy a part of the trim little sailboat Dolphin, which chanced\njust then to be in the market. This was in the latter part of May.\n\nThree shares, at five or six dollars each, I forget which, had already\nbeen taken by Phil Adams, Fred Langdon, and Binny Wallace. The fourth\nand remaining share hung fire. Unless a purchaser could be found for\nthis, the bargain was to fall through.\n\nI am afraid I required but slight urging to join in the investment.\nI had four dollars and fifty cents on hand, and the treasurer of the\nCentipedes advanced me the balance, receiving my silver pencil-case as\nample security. It was a proud moment when I stood on the wharf with my\npartners, inspecting the Dolphin, moored at the foot of a very slippery\nflight of steps. She was painted white with a green stripe outside, and\non the stern a yellow dolphin, with its scarlet mouth wide open, stared\nwith a surprised expression at its own reflection in the water. The boat\nwas a great bargain.\n\nI whirled my cap in the air, and ran to the stairs leading down from the\nwharf, when a hand was laid gently on my shoulder. I turned and faced\nCaptain Nutter. I never saw such an old sharp-eye as he was in those\ndays.\n\nI knew he wouldn't be angry with me for buying a rowboat; but I also\nknew that the little bowsprit suggesting a jib, and the tapering mast\nready for its few square feet of canvas, were trifles not likely to\nmeet his approval. As far as rowing on the river, among the wharves, was\nconcerned, the Captain had long since withdrawn his decided objections,\nhaving convinced himself, by going out with me several times, that I\ncould manage a pair of sculls as well as anybody.\n\nI was right in my surmises. He commanded me, in the most emphatic\nterms, never to go out in the Dolphin without leaving the mast in the\nboat-house. This curtailed my anticipated sport, but the pleasure of\nhaving a pull whenever I wanted it remained. I never disobeyed the\nCaptain's orders touching the sail, though I sometimes extended my row\nbeyond the points he had indicated.\n\nThe river was dangerous for sailboats. Squalls, without the slightest\nwarning, were of frequent occurrence; scarcely a year passed that six or\nseven persons were not drowned under the very windows of the town, and\nthese, oddly enough, were generally sea-captains, who either did not\nunderstand the river, or lacked the skill to handle a small craft.\n\nA knowledge of such disasters, one of which I witnessed, consoled me\nsomewhat when I saw Phil Adams skimming over the water in a spanking\nbreeze with every stitch of canvas set. There were few better yachtsmen\nthan Phil Adams. He usually went sailing alone, for both Fred Langdon\nand Binny Wallace were under the same restrictions I was.\n\nNot long after the purchase of the boat, we planned an excursion to\nSandpeep Island, the last of the islands in the harbor. We proposed to\nstart early in the morning, and return with the tide in the moonlight.\nOur only difficulty was to obtain a whole day's exemption from school,\nthe customary half-holiday not being long enough for our picnic.\nSomehow, we couldn't work it; but fortune arranged it for us. I may\nsay here, that, whatever else I did, I never played truant (\"hookey\" we\ncalled it) in my life.\n\nOne afternoon the four owners of the Dolphin exchanged significant\nglances when Mr. Grimshaw announced from the desk that there would be\nno school the following day, he having just received intelligence of the\ndeath of his uncle in Boston I was sincerely attached to Mr. Grimshaw,\nbut I am afraid that the death of his uncle did not affect me as it\nought to have done.\n\nWe were up before sunrise the next morning, in order to take advantage\nof the flood tide, which waits for no man. Our preparations for the\ncruise were made the previous evening. In the way of eatables and\ndrinkables, we had stored in the stem of the Dolphin a generous bag\nof hard-tack (for the chowder), a piece of pork to fry the cunners in,\nthree gigantic apple-pies (bought at Pettingil's), half a dozen lemons,\nand a keg of spring-water--the last-named article we slung over the\nside, to keep it cool, as soon as we got under way. The crockery and\nthe bricks for our camp-stove we placed in the bows, with the groceries,\nwhich included sugar, pepper, salt, and a bottle of pickles. Phil Adams\ncontributed to the outfit a small tent of unbleached cotton cloth, under\nwhich we intended to take our nooning.\n\nWe unshipped the mast, threw in an extra oar, and were ready to embark.\nI do not believe that Christopher Columbus, when he started on his\nrather successful voyage of discovery, felt half the responsibility\nand importance that weighed upon me as I sat on the middle seat of the\nDolphin, with my oar resting in the row-lock. I wonder if Christopher\nColumbus quietly slipped out of the house without letting his estimable\nfamily know what he was up to?\n\nCharley Marden, whose father had promised to cane him if he ever stepped\nfoot on sail or rowboat, came down to the wharf in a sour-grape humor,\nto see us off. Nothing would tempt him to go out on the river in such\na crazy clam-shell of a boat. He pretended that he did not expect\nto behold us alive again, and tried to throw a wet blanket over the\nexpedition.\n\n\"Guess you'll have a squally time of it,\" said Charley, casting off\nthe painter. \"I'll drop in at old Newbury's\" (Newbury was the parish\nundertaker) \"and leave word, as I go along!\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" muttered Phil Adams, sticking the boat-hook into the\nstring-piece of the wharf, and sending the Dolphin half a dozen yards\ntowards the current.\n\nHow calm and lovely the river was! Not a ripple stirred on the glassy\nsurface, broken only by the sharp cutwater of our tiny craft. The sun,\nas round and red as an August moon, was by this time peering above the\nwater-line.\n\nThe town had drifted behind us, and we were entering among the group of\nislands. Sometimes we could almost touch with our boat-hook the shelving\nbanks on either side. As we neared the mouth of the harbor a little\nbreeze now and then wrinkled the blue water, shook the spangles from\nthe foliage, and gently lifted the spiral mist-wreaths that still clung\nalong shore. The measured dip of our oars and the drowsy twitterings\nof the birds seemed to mingle with, rather than break, the enchanted\nsilence that reigned about us.\n\nThe scent of the new clover comes back to me now, as I recall that\ndelicious morning when we floated away in a fairy boat down a river like\na dream!\n\nThe sun was well up when the nose of the Dolphin nestled against the\nsnow-white bosom of Sandpeep Island. This island, as I have said before,\nwas the last of the cluster, one side of it being washed by the sea. We\nlanded on the river-side, the sloping sands and quiet water affording us\na good place to moor the boat.\n\nIt took us an hour or two to transport our stores to the spot selected\nfor the encampment. Having pitched our tent, using the five oars to\nsupport the canvas, we got out our lines, and went down the rocks\nseaward to fish. It was early for cunners, but we were lucky enough to\ncatch as nice a mess as ever you saw. A cod for the chowder was not so\neasily secured. At last Binny Wallace hauled in a plump little fellow\ncrusted all over with flaky silver.\n\nTo skin the fish, build our fireplace, and cook the chowder kept us\nbusy the next two hours. The fresh air and the exercise had given us the\nappetites of wolves, and we were about famished by the time the savory\nmixture was ready for our clamshell saucers.\n\nI shall not insult the rising generation on the seaboard by telling them\nhow delectable is a chowder compounded and eaten in this Robinson Crusoe\nfashion. As for the boys who live inland, and know naught of such marine\nfeasts, my heart is full of pity for them. What wasted lives! Not to\nknow the delights of a clam-bake, not to love chowder, to be ignorant of\nlob-scouse!\n\nHow happy we were, we four, sitting crosslegged in the crisp salt grass,\nwith the invigorating sea-breeze blowing gratefully through our hair!\nWhat a joyous thing was life, and how far off seemed death--death, that\nlurks in all pleasant places, and was so near!\n\nThe banquet finished, Phil Adams drew from his pocket a handful of\nsweet-fern cigars; but as none of the party could indulge without\nimminent risk of becoming sick, we all, on one pretext or another,\ndeclined, and Phil smoked by himself.\n\nThe wind had freshened by this, and we found it comfortable to put\non the jackets which had been thrown aside in the heat of the day.\nWe strolled along the beach and gathered large quantities of the\nfairy-woven Iceland moss, which, at certain seasons, is washed to these\nshores; then we played at ducks and drakes, and then, the sun being\nsufficiently low, we went in bathing.\n\nBefore our bath was ended a slight change had come over the sky and sea;\nfleecy-white clouds scudded here and there, and a muffled moan from the\nbreakers caught our ears from time to time. While we were dressing, a\nfew hurried drops of rain came lisping down, and we adjourned to the\ntent to await the passing of the squall.\n\n\"We're all right, anyhow,\" said Phil Adams. \"It won't be much of a blow,\nand we'll be as snug as a bug in a rug, here in the tent, particularly\nif we have that lemonade which some of you fellows were going to make.\"\n\nBy an oversight, the lemons had been left in the boat. Binny Wallace\nvolunteered to go for them.\n\n\"Put an extra stone on the painter, Binny,\" said Adams, calling after\nhim; \"it would be awkward to have the Dolphin give us the slip and\nreturn to port minus her passengers.\"\n\n\"That it would,\" answered Binny, scrambling down the rocks.\n\nSandpeep Island is diamond-shaped--one point running out into the sea,\nand the other looking towards the town. Our tent was on the river-side.\nThough the Dolphin was also on the same side, it lay out of sight by the\nbeach at the farther extremity of the island.\n\nBinny Wallace had been absent five or six minutes, when we heard him\ncalling our several names in tones that indicated distress or surprise,\nwe could not tell which. Our first thought was, \"The boat has broken\nadrift!\"\n\nWe sprung to our feet and hastened down to the beach. On turning the\nbluff which hid the mooring-place from our view, we found the conjecture\ncorrect. Not only was the Dolphin afloat, but poor little Binny Wallace\nwas standing in the bows with his arms stretched helplessly towards\nus--drifting out to sea!\n\n\"Head the boat in shore!\" shouted Phil Adams.\n\nWallace ran to the tiller; but the slight cockle-shell merely swung\nround and drifted broadside on. O, if we had but left a single scull in\nthe Dolphin!\n\n\"Can you swim it?\" cried Adams, desperately, using his hand as a\nspeaking-trumpet, for the distance between the boat and the island\nwidened momentarily.\n\nBinny Wallace looked down at the sea, which was covered with white caps,\nand made a despairing gesture. He knew, and we knew, that the stoutest\nswimmer could not live forty seconds in those angry waters.\n\nA wild, insane light came into Phil Adams's eyes, as he stood knee-deep\nin the boiling surf, and for an instant I think he meditated plunging\ninto the ocean after the receding boat.\n\nThe sky darkened, and an ugly look stole rapidly over the broken surface\nof the sea.\n\nBinny Wallace half rose from his seat in the stem, and waved his hand\nto us in token of farewell. In spite of the distance, increasing every\ninstant we could see his face plainly. The anxious expression it wore\nat first had passed. It was pale and meek now, and I love to think there\nwas a kind of halo about it, like that which painters place around the\nforehead of a saint. So he drifted away.\n\nThe sky grew darker and darker. It was only by straining our eyes\nthrough the unnatural twilight that we could keep the Dolphin in sight.\nThe figure of Binny Wallace was no longer visible, for the boat itself\nhad dwindled to a mere white dot on the black water. Now we lost it, and\nour hearts stopped throbbing; and now the speck appeared again, for an\ninstant, on the crest of a high wave.\n\nFinally, it went out like a spark, and we saw it no more. Then we gazed\nat each other, and dared not speak.\n\nAbsorbed in following the course of the boat, we had scarcely noticed\nthe huddled inky clouds that sagged down all around us. From these\nthreatening masses, seamed at intervals with pale lightning, there now\nburst a heavy peal of thunder that shook the ground under our feet. A\nsudden squall struck the sea, ploughing deep white furrows into it, and\nat the same instant a single piercing shriek rose above the tempest--the\nfrightened cry of a gull swooping over the island. How it startled us!\n\nIt was impossible any longer to keep our footing on the beach. The wind\nand the breakers would have swept us into the ocean if we had not clung\nto each other with the desperation of drowning men. Taking advantage of\na momentary lull, we crawled up the sands on our hands and knees, and,\npausing in the lee of the granite ledge to gain breath, returned to the\ncamp, where we found that the gale had snapped all the fastenings of\nthe tent but one. Held by this, the puffed-out canvas swayed in the wind\nlike a balloon. It was a task of some difficulty to secure it, which we\ndid by beating down the canvas with the oars.\n\nAfter several trials, we succeeded in setting up the tent on the leeward\nside of the ledge. Blinded by the vivid flashes of lightning, and\ndrenched by the rain, which fell in torrents, we crept, half dead with\nfear and anguish, under our flimsy shelter. Neither the anguish nor the\nfear was on our own account, for we were comparatively safe, but for\npoor little Binny Wallace, driven out to sea in the merciless gale. We\nshuddered to think of him in that frail shell, drifting on and on to his\ngrave, the sky rent with lightning over his head, and the green abysses\nyawning beneath him. We fell to crying, the three of us, and cried I\nknow not how long.\n\nMeanwhile the storm raged with augmented fury. We were obliged to hold\non to the ropes of the tent to prevent it blowing away. The spray\nfrom the river leaped several yards up the rocks and clutched at us\nmalignantly. The very island trembled with the concussions of the sea\nbeating upon it, and at times I fancied that it had broken loose from\nits foundation, and was floating off with us. The breakers, streaked\nwith angry phosphorus, were fearful to look at.\n\nThe wind rose higher and higher, cutting long slits in the tent, through\nwhich the rain poured incessantly. To complete the sum of our miseries,\nthe night was at hand. It came down suddenly, at last, like a curtain,\nshutting in Sandpeep island from all the world.\n\nIt was a dirty night, as the sailors say. The darkness was something\nthat could be felt as well as seen--it pressed down upon one with a cold,\nclammy touch. Gazing into the hollow blackness, all sorts of imaginable\nshapes seemed to start forth from vacancy--brilliant colors, stars,\nprisms, and dancing lights. What boy, lying awake at night, has not\namused or terrified himself by peopling the spaces around his bed with\nthese phenomena of his own eyes?\n\n\"I say,\" whispered Fred Langdon, at length, clutching my hand, \"don't\nyou see things--out there--in the dark?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--Binny Wallace's face!\"\n\nI added to my own nervousness by making this avowal; though for the\nlast ten minutes I had seen little besides that star-pale face with\nits angelic hair and brows. First a slim yellow circle, like the nimbus\nround the moon, took shape and grew sharp against the darkness; then\nthis faded gradually, and there was the Face, wearing the same sad,\nsweet look it wore when he waved his hand to us across the awful water.\nThis optical illusion kept repeating itself.\n\n\"And I too,\" said Adams. \"I see it every now and then, outside there.\nWhat wouldn't I give if it really was poor little Wallace looking in at\nus! O boys, how shall we dare to go back to the town without him? I've\nwished a hundred times, since we've been sitting here, that I was in his\nplace, alive or dead!\"\n\nWe dreaded the approach of morning as much as we longed for it. The\nmorning would tell us all. Was it possible for the Dolphin to outride\nsuch a storm? There was a light-house on Mackerel Reef, which lay\ndirectly in the course the boat had taken, when it disappeared. If the\nDolphin had caught on this reef, perhaps Binny Wallace was safe. Perhaps\nhis cries had been heard by the keeper of the light. The man owned a\nlifeboat, and had rescued several people. Who could tell?\n\nSuch were the questions we asked ourselves again and again, as we lay in\neach other's arms waiting for daybreak. What an endless night it was! I\nhave known months that did not seem so long.\n\nOur position was irksome rather than perilous; for the day was certain\nto bring us relief from the town, where our prolonged absence, together\nwith the storm, had no doubt excited the liveliest alarm for our safety.\nBut the cold, the darkness, and the suspense were hard to bear.\n\nOur soaked jackets had chilled us to the bone. To keep warm, we lay\nhuddled together so closely that we could bear our hearts beat above the\ntumult of sea and sky.\n\nAfter a while we grew very hungry, not having broken our fast since\nearly in the day. The rain had turned the hard-tack into a sort of\ndough; but it was better than nothing.\n\nWe used to laugh at Fred Langdon for always carrying in his pocket a\nsmall vial of essence of peppermint or sassafras, a few drops of which,\nsprinkled on a lump of loaf-sugar, he seemed to consider a great luxury.\nI don't know what would have become of us at this crisis, if it hadn't\nbeen for that omnipresent bottle of hot stuff. We poured the stinging\nliquid over our sugar, which had kept dry in a sardine-box, and warmed\nourselves with frequent doses.\n\nAfter four or five hours the rain ceased, the wind died away to a moan,\nand the sea--no longer raging like a maniac--sobbed and sobbed with a\npiteous human voice all along the coast. And well it might, after that\nnight's work. Twelve sail of the Gloucester fishing fleet had gone down\nwith every soul on board, just outside of Whale's-back Light. Think of\nthe wide grief that follows in the wake of one wreck; then think of the\ndespairing women who wrung their hands and wept, the next morning, in\nthe streets of Gloucester, Marblehead, and Newcastle!\n\nThough our strength was nearly spent, we were too cold to sleep. Once\nI sunk into a troubled doze, when I seemed to bear Charley Marden's\nparting words, only it was the Sea that said them. After that I threw\noff the drowsiness whenever it threatened to overcome me.\n\nFred Langdon was the earliest to discover a filmy, luminous streak in\nthe sky, the first glimmering of sunrise.\n\n\"Look, it is nearly daybreak!\"\n\nWhile we were following the direction of his finger, a sound of distant\noars fell on our ears.\n\nWe listened breathlessly, and as the dip of the blades became more\naudible, we discerned two foggy lights, like will-o'the-wisps, floating\non the river.\n\nRunning down to the water's edge, we hailed the boats with all\nour might. The call was heard, for the oars rested a moment in the\nrow-locks, and then pulled in towards the island.\n\nIt was two boats from the town, in the foremost of which we could now\nmake out the figures of Captain Nutter and Binny Wallace's father. We\nshrunk back on seeing him.\n\n\"Thank God!\" cried Mr. Wallace, fervently, as he leaped from the wherry\nwithout waiting for the bow to touch the beach.\n\nBut when he saw only three boys standing on the sands, his eye wandered\nrestlessly about in quest of the fourth; then a deadly pallor overspread\nhis features.\n\nOur story was soon told. A solemn silence fell upon the crowd of rough\nboatmen gathered round, interrupted only by a stifled sob from one poor\nold man, who stood apart from the rest.\n\nThe sea was still running too high for any small boat to venture out; so\nit was arranged that the wherry should take us back to town, leaving the\nyawl, with a picked crew, to hug the island until daybreak, and then set\nforth in search of the Dolphin.\n\nThough it was barely sunrise when we reached town, there were a great\nmany people assembled at the landing eager for intelligence from missing\nboats. Two picnic parties had started down river the day before, just\nprevious to the gale, and nothing had been beard of them. It turned out\nthat the pleasure-seekers saw their danger in time, and ran ashore on\none of the least exposed islands, where they passed the night. Shortly\nafter our own arrival they appeared off Rivermouth, much to the joy of\ntheir friends, in two shattered, dismasted boats.\n\nThe excitement over, I was in a forlorn state, physically and mentally.\nCaptain Nutter put me to bed between hot blankets, and sent Kitty\nCollins for the doctor. I was wandering in my mind, and fancied myself\nstill on Sandpeep Island: now we were building our brick-stove to cook\nthe chowder, and, in my delirium, I laughed aloud and shouted to my\ncomrades; now the sky darkened, and the squall struck the island: now I\ngave orders to Wallace how to manage the boat, and now I cried because\nthe rain was pouring in on me through the holes in the tent. Towards\nevening a high fever set in, and it was many days before my grandfather\ndeemed it prudent to tell me that the Dolphin had been found, floating\nkeel upwards, four miles southeast of Mackerel Reef.\n\nPoor little Binny Wallace! How strange it seemed, when I went to\nschool again, to see that empty seat in the fifth row! How gloomy the\nplayground was, lacking the sunshine of his gentle, sensitive face! One\nday a folded sheet slipped from my algebra; it was the last note he ever\nwrote me. I couldn't read it for the tears.\n\nWhat a pang shot across my heart the afternoon it was whispered through\nthe town that a body had been washed ashore at Grave Point--the place\nwhere we bathed. We bathed there no more! How well I remember the\nfuneral, and what a piteous sight it was afterwards to see his familiar\nname on a small headstone in the Old South Burying Ground!\n\nPoor little Binny Wallace! Always the same to me. The rest of us have\ngrown up into hard, worldly men, fighting the fight of life; but you\nare forever young, and gentle, and pure; a part of my own childhood\nthat time cannot wither; always a little boy, always poor little Binny\nWallace!\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fifteen--An Old Acquaintance Turns Up\n\n\nA year had stolen by since the death of Binny Wallace--a year of which I\nhave nothing important to record.\n\nThe loss of our little playmate threw a shadow over our young lives for\nmany and many a month. The Dolphin rose and fell with the tide at the\nfoot of the slippery steps, unused, the rest of the summer. At the close\nof November we hauled her sadly into the boat-house for the winter; but\nwhen spring came round we launched the Dolphin again, and often went\ndown to the wharf and looked at her lying in the tangled eel-grass,\nwithout much inclination to take a row. The associations connected with\nthe boat were too painful as yet; but time, which wears the sharp edge\nfrom everything, softened this feeling, and one afternoon we brought out\nthe cobwebbed oars.\n\nThe ice once broken, brief trips along the wharves--we seldom cared to\ngo out into the river now--became one of our chief amusements. Meanwhile\nGypsy was not forgotten. Every clear morning I was in the saddle\nbefore breakfast, and there are few roads or lanes within ten miles of\nRivermouth that have not borne the print of her vagrant hoof.\n\nI studied like a good fellow this quarter, carrying off a couple of\nfirst prizes. The Captain expressed his gratification by presenting me\nwith a new silver dollar. If a dollar in his eyes was smaller than a\ncart-wheel, it wasn't so very much smaller. I redeemed my pencil-case\nfrom the treasurer of the Centipedes, and felt that I was getting on in\nthe world.\n\nIt was at this time I was greatly cast down by a letter from my father\nsaying that he should be unable to visit Rivermouth until the following\nyear. With that letter came another to Captain Nutter, which he did not\nread aloud to the family, as usual. It was on business, he said, folding\nit up in his wallet. He received several of these business letters from\ntime to time, and I noticed that they always made him silent and moody.\n\nThe fact is, my father's banking-house was not thriving. The\nunlooked-for failure of a firm largely indebted to him had crippled\n\"the house.\" When the Captain imparted this information to me I didn't\ntrouble myself over the matter. I supposed--if I supposed anything--that\nall grown-up people had more or less money, when they wanted it. Whether\nthey inherited it, or whether government supplied them, was not clear\nto me. A loose idea that my father had a private gold-mine somewhere or\nother relieved me of all uneasiness.\n\nI was not far from right. Every man has within himself a gold-mine whose\nriches are limited only by his own industry. It is true, it sometimes\nhappens that industry does not avail, if a man lacks that something\nwhich, for want of a better name, we call Luck. My father was a person\nof untiring energy and ability; but he had no luck. To use a Rivermouth\nsaying, he was always catching sculpins when everyone else with the same\nbait was catching mackerel.\n\nIt was more than two years since I had seen my parents. I felt that I\ncould not bear a longer separation. Every letter from New Orleans--we\ngot two or three a month--gave me a fit of homesickness; and when it was\ndefinitely settled that my father and mother were to remain in the South\nanother twelvemonth, I resolved to go to them.\n\nSince Binny Wallace's death, Pepper Whitcomb had been my fidus Achates;\nwe occupied desks near each other at school, and were always together\nin play hours. We rigged a twine telegraph from his garret window to\nthe scuttle of the Nutter House, and sent messages to each other in\na match-box. We shared our pocket-money and our secrets--those amazing\nsecrets which boys have. We met in lonely places by stealth, and parted\nlike conspirators; we couldn't buy a jackknife or build a kite without\nthrowing an air of mystery and guilt over the transaction.\n\nI naturally hastened to lay my New Orleans project before Pepper\nWhitcomb, having dragged him for that purpose to a secluded spot in the\ndark pine woods outside the town. Pepper listened to me with a gravity\nwhich he will not be able to surpass when he becomes Chief Justice, and\nstrongly advised me to go.\n\n\"The summer vacation,\" said Pepper, \"lasts six weeks; that will give you\na fortnight to spend in New Orleans, allowing two weeks each way for the\njourney.\"\n\nI wrung his hand and begged him to accompany me, offering to defray\nall the expenses. I wasn't anything if I wasn't princely in those days.\nAfter considerable urging, he consented to go on terms so liberal. The\nwhole thing was arranged; there was nothing to do now but to advise\nCaptain Nutter of my plan, which I did the next day.\n\nThe possibility that he might oppose the tour never entered my head. I\nwas therefore totally unprepared for the vigorous negative which met\nmy proposal. I was deeply mortified, moreover, for there was Pepper\nWhitcomb on the wharf, at the foot of the street, waiting for me to come\nand let him know what day we were to start.\n\n\"Go to New Orleans? Go to Jericho!\" exclaimed Captain Nutter. \"You'd\nlook pretty, you two, philandering off, like the babes in the wood,\ntwenty-five hundred miles, 'with all the world before you where to\nchoose!'\"\n\nAnd the Captain's features, which had worn an indignant air as he began\nthe sentence, relaxed into a broad smile. Whether it was at the felicity\nof his own quotation, or at the mental picture he drew of Pepper and\nmyself on our travels.\n\nI couldn't tell, and I didn't care. I was heart-broken. How could I face\nmy chum after all the dazzling inducements I had held out to him?\n\nMy grandfather, seeing that I took the matter seriously, pointed out\nthe difficulties of such a journey and the great expense involved. He\nentered into the details of my father's money troubles, and succeeded\nin making it plain to me that my wishes, under the circumstances, were\nsomewhat unreasonable. It was in no cheerful mood that I joined Pepper\nat the end of the wharf.\n\nI found that young gentleman leaning against the bulkhead gazing\nintently towards the islands in the harbor. He had formed a telescope of\nhis hands, and was so occupied with his observations as to be oblivious\nof my approach.\n\n\"Hullo!\" cried Pepper, dropping his hands. \"Look there! Isn't that a\nbark coming up the Narrows?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Just at the left of Fishcrate Island. Don't you see the foremast\npeeping above the old derrick?\"\n\nSure enough it was a vessel of considerable size, slowly beating up to\ntown. In a few moments more the other two masts were visible above the\ngreen hillocks.\n\n\"Fore-topmasts blown away,\" said Pepper. \"Putting in for repairs, I\nguess.\"\n\nAs the bark lazily crept from behind the last of the islands, she let go\nher anchors and swung round with the tide. Then the gleeful chant of\nthe sailors at the capstan came to us pleasantly across the water. The\nvessel lay within three quarters of a mile of us, and we could plainly\nsee the men at the davits lowering the starboard long-boat. It no sooner\ntouched the stream than a dozen of the crew scrambled like mice over the\nside of the merchantman.\n\nIn a neglected seaport like Rivermouth the arrival of a large ship is an\nevent of moment. The prospect of having twenty or thirty jolly tars\nlet loose on the peaceful town excites divers emotions among the\ninhabitants. The small shopkeepers along the wharves anticipate a\nthriving trade; the proprietors of the two rival boarding-houses--the\n\"Wee Drop\" and the \"Mariner's Home\"--hasten down to the landing to secure\nlodgers; and the female population of Anchor Lane turn out to a woman,\nfor a ship fresh from sea is always full of possible husbands and\nlong-lost prodigal sons.\n\nBut aside from this there is scant welcome given to a ship's crew in\nRivermouth. The toil-worn mariner is a sad fellow ashore, judging him by\na severe moral standard.\n\nOnce, I remember, a United States frigate came into port for repairs\nafter a storm. She lay in the river a fortnight or more, and every day\nsent us a gang of sixty or seventy of our country's gallant defenders,\nwho spread themselves over the town, doing all sorts of mad things. They\nwere good-natured enough, but full of old Sancho. The \"Wee Drop\" proved\na drop too much for many of them. They went singing through the streets\nat midnight, wringing off door-knockers, shinning up water-spouts, and\nfrightening the Oldest Inhabitant nearly to death by popping their\nheads into his second-story window, and shouting \"Fire!\" One morning a\nblue-jacket was discovered in a perilous plight, half-way up the steeple\nof the South Church, clinging to the lightning-rod. How he got there\nnobody could tell, not even blue-jacket himself. All he knew was, that\nthe leg of his trousers had caught on a nail, and there he stuck, unable\nto move either way. It cost the town twenty dollars to get him down\nagain. He directed the workmen how to splice the ladders brought to his\nassistance, and called his rescuers \"butter-fingered land-lubbers\" with\ndelicious coolness.\n\nBut those were man-of-war's men: The sedate-looking craft now lying off\nFishcrate Island wasn't likely to carry any such cargo. Nevertheless, we\nwatched the coming in of the long-boat with considerable interest.\n\nAs it drew near, the figure of the man pulling the bow-oar seemed oddly\nfamiliar to me. Where could I have seen him before? When and where? His\nback was towards me, but there was something about that closely cropped\nhead that I recognized instantly.\n\n\"Way enough!\" cried the steersman, and all the oars stood upright in\nthe air. The man in the bow seized the boat-hook, and, turning round\nquickly, showed me the honest face of Sailor Ben of the Typhoon.\n\n\"It's Sailor Ben!\" I cried, nearly pushing Pepper Whitcomb overboard in\nmy excitement.\n\nSailor Ben, with the wonderful pink lady on his arm, and the ships and\nstars and anchors tattooed all over him, was a well-known hero among my\nplaymates. And there he was, like something in a dream come true!\n\nI didn't wait for my old acquaintance to get firmly on the wharf, before\nI grasped his hand in both of mine.\n\n\"Sailor Ben, don't you remember me?\"\n\nHe evidently did not. He shifted his quid from one cheek to the other,\nand looked at me meditatively.\n\n\"Lord love ye, lad, I don't know you. I was never here afore in my\nlife.\"\n\n\"What!\" I cried, enjoying his perplexity. \"Have you forgotten the\nvoyage from New Orleans in the Typhoon, two years ago, you lovely old\npicture-book?\"\n\nAh! then he knew me, and in token of the recollection gave my hand such\na squeeze that I am sure an unpleasant change came over my countenance.\n\n\"Bless my eyes, but you have growed so. I shouldn't have knowed you if I\nhad met you in Singapore!\"\n\nWithout stopping to inquire, as I was tempted to do, why he was more\nlikely to recognize me in Singapore than anywhere else, I invited him to\ncome at once up to the Nutter House, where I insured him a warm welcome\nfrom the Captain.\n\n\"Hold steady, Master Tom,\" said Sailor Ben, slipping the painter through\nthe ringbolt and tying the loveliest knot you ever saw; \"hold steady\ntill I see if the mate can let me off. If you please, sir,\" he\ncontinued, addressing the steersman, a very red-faced, bow-legged\nperson, \"this here is a little shipmate o' mine as wants to talk over\nback times along of me, if so it's convenient.\"\n\n\"All right, Ben,\" returned the mate; \"sha'n't want you for an hour.\"\n\nLeaving one man in charge of the boat, the mate and the rest of the\ncrew went off together. In the meanwhile Pepper Whitcomb had got out his\ncunner-line, and was quietly fishing at the end of the wharf, as if to\ngive me the idea that he wasn't so very much impressed by my intimacy\nwith so renowned a character as Sailor Ben. Perhaps Pepper was a little\njealous. At any rate, he refused to go with us to the house.\n\nCaptain Nutter was at home reading the Rivermouth Barnacle. He was\na reader to do an editor's heart good; he never skipped over an\nadvertisement, even if he had read it fifty times before. Then the paper\nwent the rounds of the neighborhood, among the poor people, like the\nsingle portable eye which the three blind crones passed to each other in\nthe legend of King Acrisius. The Captain, I repeat, was wandering in\nthe labyrinths of the Rivermouth Barnacle when I led Sailor Ben into the\nsitting-room.\n\nMy grandfather, whose inborn courtesy knew no distinctions, received\nmy nautical friend as if he had been an admiral instead of a common\nforecastle-hand. Sailor Ben pulled an imaginary tuft of hair on his\nforehead, and bowed clumsily. Sailors have a way of using their forelock\nas a sort of handle to bow with.\n\nThe old tar had probably never been in so handsome an apartment in all\nhis days, and nothing could induce him to take the inviting mahogany\nchair which the Captain wheeled out from the corner.\n\nThe abashed mariner stood up against the wall, twirling his tarpaulin\nin his two hands and looking extremely silly. He made a poor show in a\ngentleman's drawing-room, but what a fellow he had been in his day, when\nthe gale blew great guns and the topsails wanted reefing! I thought of\nhim with the Mexican squadron off Vera Cruz, where,\n\n'The rushing battle-bolt sung from the three-decker out of the foam,'\n\nand he didn't seem awkward or ignoble to me, for all his shyness.\n\nAs Sailor Ben declined to sit down, the Captain did not resume his seat;\nso we three stood in a constrained manner until my grandfather went to\nthe door and called to Kitty to bring in a decanter of Madeira and two\nglasses.\n\n\"My grandson, here, has talked so much about you,\" said the Captain,\npleasantly, \"that you seem quite like an old acquaintance to me.\"\n\n\"Thankee, sir, thankee,\" returned Sailor Ben, looking as guilty as if he\nhad been detected in picking a pocket.\n\n\"And I'm very glad to see you, Mr.--Mr.--\"\n\n\"Sailor Ben,\" suggested that worthy.\n\n\"Mr. Sailor Ben,\" added the Captain, smiling. \"Tom, open the door,\nthere's Kitty with the glasses.\"\n\nI opened the door, and Kitty entered the room bringing the things on\na waiter, which she was about to set on the table, when suddenly she\nuttered a loud shriek; the decanter and glasses fell with a crash to the\nfloor, and Kitty, as white as a sheet, was seen flying through the hall.\n\n\"It's his wraith! It's his wraith!\"' we heard Kitty shrieking in the\nkitchen.\n\nMy grandfather and I turned with amazement to Sailor Ben. His eyes were\nstanding out of his head like a lobster's.\n\n\"It's my own little Irish lass!\" shouted the sailor, and he darted into\nthe hall after her.\n\nEven then we scarcely caught the meaning of his words, but when we saw\nSailor Ben and Kitty sobbing on each other's shoulder in the kitchen, we\nunderstood it all.\n\n\"I begs your honor's parden, sir,\" said Sailor Ben, lifting his\ntear-stained face above Kitty's tumbled hair; \"I begs your honor's\nparden for kicking up a rumpus in the house, but it's my own little\nIrish lass as I lost so long ago!\"\n\n\"Heaven preserve us!\" cried the Captain, blowing his nose violently--a\ntransparent ruse to hide his emotion.\n\nMiss Abigail was in an upper chamber, sweeping; but on hearing\nthe unusual racket below, she scented an accident and came ambling\ndownstairs with a bottle of the infallible hot-drops in her hand.\nNothing but the firmness of my grandfather prevented her from giving\nSailor Ben a table-spoonful on the spot. But when she learned what had\ncome about--that this was Kitty's husband, that Kitty Collins wasn't\nKitty Collins now, but Mrs. Benjamin Watson of Nantucket--the good\nsoul sat down on the meal-chest and sobbed as if--to quote from Captain\nNutter--as if a husband of her own had turned up!\n\nA happier set of people than we were never met together in a dingy\nkitchen or anywhere else. The Captain ordered a fresh decanter of\nMadeira, and made all hands, excepting myself, drink a cup to the return\nof \"the prodigal sea-son,\" as he persisted in calling Sailor Ben.\n\nAfter the first flush of joy and surprise was over Kitty grew silent\nand constrained. Now and then she fixed her eyes thoughtfully on her\nhusband. Why had he deserted her all these years? What right had he to\nlook for a welcome from one he had treated so cruelly? She had been true\nto him, but had he been true to her? Sailor Ben must have guessed what\nwas passing in her mind, for presently he took her hand and said--\"Well,\nlass, it's a long yarn, but you shall have it all in good time. It was\nmy hard luck as made us part company, an' no will of mine, for I loved\nyou dear.\"\n\nKitty brightened up immediately, needing no other assurance of Sailor\nBen's faithfulness.\n\nWhen his hour had expired, we walked with him down to the wharf, where\nthe Captain held a consultation with the mate, which resulted in an\nextension of Mr. Watson's leave of absence, and afterwards in his\ndischarge from his ship. We then went to the \"Mariner's Home\" to engage\na room for him, as he wouldn't hear of accepting the hospitalities of\nthe Nutter House.\n\n\"You see, I'm only an uneddicated man,\" he remarked to my grandfather,\nby way of explanation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Sixteen--In Which Sailor Ben Spins a Yarn\n\n\nOf course we were all very curious to learn what had befallen Sailor\nBen that morning long ago, when he bade his little bride goodby and\ndisappeared so mysteriously.\n\nAfter tea, that same evening, we assembled around the table in the\nkitchen--the only place where Sailor Ben felt at home--to hear what he\nhad to say for himself.\n\nThe candles were snuffed, and a pitcher of foaming nut-brown ale was\nset at the elbow of the speaker, who was evidently embarrassed by the\nrespectability of his audience, consisting of Captain Nutter, Miss\nAbigail, myself, and Kitty, whose face shone with happiness like one of\nthe polished tin platters on the dresser.\n\n\"Well, my hearties,\" commenced Sailor Ben--then he stopped short and\nturned very red, as it struck him that maybe this was not quite the\nproper way to address a dignitary like the Captain and a severe elderly\nlady like Miss Abigail Nutter, who sat bolt upright staring at him as\nshe would have stared at the Tycoon of Japan himself.\n\n\"I ain't much of a hand at spinnin' a yarn,\" remarked Sailor Ben,\napologetically, \"'specially when the yarn is all about a man as has\nmade a fool of hisself, an' 'specially when that man's name is Benjamin\nWatson.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Captain Nutter, rapping on the table encouragingly.\n\n\"Thankee, sir, thankee. I go back to the time when Kitty an' me was\nlivin' in lodgin's by the dock in New York. We was as happy, sir, as two\nporpusses, which they toil not neither do they spin. But when I seed the\nmoney gittin' low in the locker--Kitty's starboard stockin', savin' your\npresence, marm--I got down-hearted like, seem' as I should be obleeged\nto ship agin, for it didn't seem as I could do much ashore. An' then the\nsea was my nat'ral spear of action. I wasn't exactly born on it, look\nyou, but I fell into it the fust time I was let out arter my birth. My\nmother slipped her cable for a heavenly port afore I was old enough to\nhail her; so I larnt to look on the ocean for a sort of step-mother--an'\na precious hard one she has been to me.\n\n\"The idee of leavin' Kitty so soon arter our marriage went agin my grain\nconsiderable. I cruised along the docks for somethin' to do in the\nway of stevedore: an' though I picked up a stray job here and there,\nI didn't arn enough to buy ship-bisket for a rat; let alone feedin' two\nhuman mouths. There wasn't nothin' honest I wouldn't have turned a hand\nto; but the 'longshoremen gobbled up all the work, an' a outsider like\nme didn't stand a show.\n\n\"Things got from bad to worse; the month's rent took all our cash except\na dollar or so, an' the sky looked kind o' squally fore an' aft. Well,\nI set out one mornin'--that identical unlucky mornin'--determined to come\nback an' toss some pay into Kitty's lap, if I had to sell my jacket for\nit. I spied a brig unloadin' coal at pier No. 47--how well I remembers\nit! I hailed the mate, an' offered myself for a coal-heaver. But I\nwasn't wanted, as he told me civilly enough, which was better treatment\nthan usual. As I turned off rather glum I was signalled by one of them\nsleek, smooth-spoken rascals with a white hat an' a weed on it, as is\nalways goin' about the piers a-seekin' who they may devower.\n\n\"We sailors know 'em for rascals from stem to starn, but somehow every\nfresh one fleeces us jest as his mate did afore him. We don't larn\nnothin' by exper'ence; we're jest no better than a lot of babys with no\nbrains.\n\n\"'Good mornin', my man,' sez the chap, as iley as you please.\n\n\"'Mornin', sir,' sez I.\n\n\"'Lookin' for a job?' sez he.\n\n\"'Through the big end of a telescope,' sez I--meanin' that the chances\nfor a job looked very small from my pint of view.\n\n\"'You're the man for my money,' sez the sharper, smilin' as innocent as\na cherubim; 'jest step in here, till we talk it over.'\n\n\"So I goes with him like a nat'ral-born idiot, into a little\ngrocery-shop near by, where we sets down at a table with a bottle atween\nus. Then it comes out as there is a New Bedford whaler about to start\nfor the fishin' grounds, an' jest one able-bodied sailor like me is\nwanted to make up the crew. Would I go? Yes, I wouldn't on no terms.\n\n\"'I'll bet you fifty dollars,' sez he, 'that you'll come back fust\nmate.'\n\n\"'I'll bet you a hundred,' sez I, 'that I don't, for I've signed papers\nas keeps me ashore, an' the parson has witnessed the deed.'\n\n\"So we sat there, he urgin' me to ship, an' I chaffin' him cheerful over\nthe bottle.\n\n\"Arter a while I begun to feel a little queer; things got foggy in my\nupper works, an' I remembers, faint-like, of signin' a paper; then I\nremembers bein' in a small boat; an' then I remembers nothin' until I\nheard the mate's whistle pipin' all hands on deck. I tumbled up with\nthe rest; an' there I was--on board of a whaler outward bound for a three\nyears' cruise, an' my dear little lass ashore awaitin' for me.\"\n\n\"Miserable wretch!\" said Miss Abigail, in a voice that vibrated\namong the tin platters on the dresser. This was Miss Abigail's way of\ntestifying her sympathy.\n\n\"Thankee, marm,\" returned Sailor Ben, doubtfully.\n\n\"No talking to the man at the wheel,\" cried the Captain. Upon which we\nall laughed. \"Spin!\" added my grandfather.\n\nSailor Ben resumed:\n\n\"I leave you to guess the wretchedness as fell upon me, for I've not got\nthe gift to tell you. There I was down on the ship's books for a three\nyears' viage, an' no help for it. I feel nigh to six hundred years old\nwhen I think how long that viage was. There isn't no hour-glass as runs\nslow enough to keep a tally of the slowness of them fust hours. But I\ndone my duty like a man, seem' there wasn't no way of gettin' out of it.\nI told my shipmates of the trick as had been played on me, an they tried\nto cheer me up a bit; but I was sore sorrowful for a long spell. Many a\nnight on watch I put my face in my hands and sobbed for thinkin' of the\nlittle woman left among the land-sharks, an' no man to have an eye on\nher, God bless her!\"\n\nHere Kitty softly drew her chair nearer to Sailor Ben, and rested one\nhand on his arm.\n\n\"Our adventures among the whales, I take it, doesn't consarn the present\ncompany here assembled. So I give that the go by. There's an end to\neverythin', even to a whalin' viage. My heart all but choked me the day\nwe put into New Bedford with our cargo of ile. I got my three years' pay\nin a lump, an' made for New York like a flash of lightnin'. The people\nhove to and looked at me, as I rushed through the streets like a madman,\nuntil I came to the spot where the lodgin'-house stood on West Street.\nBut, Lord love ye, there wasn't no sech lodgin'-house there, but a great\nnew brick shop.\n\n\"I made bold to go in an' ask arter the old place, but nobody knowed\nnothin' about it, save as it had been torn down two years or more. I was\nadrift now, for I had reckoned all them days and nights on gittin' word\nof Kitty from Dan Shackford, the man as kept the lodgin'.\n\n\"As I stood there with all the wind knocked out of my sails, the idee of\nrunnin' alongside the perlice-station popped into my head. The perlice\nwas likely to know the latitude of a man like Dan Shackford, who wasn't\nover an' above respecktible. They did know--he had died in the Tombs jail\nthat day twelvemonth. A coincydunce, wasn't it? I was ready to drop when\nthey told me this; howsomever, I bore up an' give the chief a notion of\nthe fix I was in. He writ a notice which I put into the newspapers every\nday for three months; but nothin' come of it. I cruised over the city\nweek in and week out I went to every sort of place where they hired\nwomen hands; I didn't leave a think undone that a uneddicated man could\ndo. But nothin' come of it. I don't believe there was a wretcheder soul\nin that big city of wretchedness than me. Sometimes I wanted to lay down\nin the sheets and die.\n\n\"Driftin' disconsolate one day among the shippin', who should I\noverhaul but the identical smooth-spoken chap with a white hat an' a\nweed on it! I didn't know if there was any spent left in me, till I\nclapped eye on his very onpleasant countenance. 'You villain!' sez\nI, 'where's my little Irish lass as you dragged me away from?' an' I\nlighted on him, hat and all, like that!\"\n\nHere Sailor Ben brought his fist down on the deal table with the force\nof a sledge-hammer. Miss Abigail gave a start, and the ale leaped up in\nthe pitcher like a miniature fountain.\n\n\"I begs your parden, ladies and gentlemen all; but the thought of that\nfeller with his ring an' his watch-chain an' his walrus face, is alus\ntoo many for me. I was for pitchin' him into the North River, when a\nperliceman prevented me from benefitin' the human family. I had to pay\nfive dollars for hittin' the chap (they said it was salt and buttery),\nan' that's what I call a neat, genteel luxury. It was worth double the\nmoney jest to see that white hat, with a weed on it, layin' on the wharf\nlike a busted accordiun.\n\n\"Arter months of useless sarch, I went to sea agin. I never got into a\nforen port but I kept a watch out for Kitty. Once I thought I seed her\nin Liverpool, but it was only a gal as looked like her. The numbers of\nwomen in different parts of the world as looked like her was amazin'. So\na good many years crawled by, an' I wandered from place to place, never\ngivin' up the sarch. I might have been chief mate scores of times, maybe\nmaster; but I hadn't no ambition. I seed many strange things in them\nyears--outlandish people an' cities, storms, shipwracks, an' battles. I\nseed many a true mate go down, an' sometimes I envied them what went to\ntheir rest. But these things is neither here nor there.\n\n\"About a year ago I shipped on board the Belphoebe yonder, an' of all\nthe strange winds as ever blowed, the strangest an' the best was the\nwind as blowed me to this here blessed spot. I can't be too thankful.\nThat I'm as thankful as it is possible for an uneddicated man to be, He\nknows as reads the heart of all.\"\n\nHere ended Sailor Ben's yarn, which I have written down in his own\nhomely words as nearly as I can recall them. After he had finished, the\nCaptain shook hands with him and served out the ale.\n\nAs Kitty was about to drink, she paused, rested the cup on her knee, and\nasked what day of the month it was.\n\n\"The twenty-seventh,\" said the Captain, wondering what she was driving\nat.\n\n\"Then,\" cried Kitty, \"it's ten years this night sence--\"\n\n\"Since what?\" asked my grandfather.\n\n\"Sence the little lass and I got spliced!\" roared Sailor Ben. \"There's\nanother coincydunce for you!\"\n\nOn hearing this we all clapped hands, and the Captain, with a degree\nof ceremony that was almost painful, drank a bumper to the health and\nhappiness of the bride and bridegroom.\n\nIt was a pleasant sight to see the two old lovers sitting side by side,\nin spite of all, drinking from the same little cup--a battered zinc\ndipper which Sailor Ben had unslung from a strap round his waist. I\nthink I never saw him without this dipper and a sheath-knife suspended\njust back of his hip, ready for any convivial occasion.\n\nWe had a merry time of it. The Captain was in great force this evening,\nand not only related his famous exploit in the War of 1812, but regaled\nthe company with a dashing sea-song from Mr. Shakespeare's play of The\nTempest. He had a mellow tenor voice (not Shakespeare, but the Captain),\nand rolled out the verse with a will:\n\n\"The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\nThe gunner, and his mate,\nLov'd Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\nBut none of us car'd for Kate.\"\n\n\"A very good song, and very well sung,\" says Sailor Ben; \"but some of us\ndoes care for Kate. Is this Mr. Shawkspear a seafarin' man, sir?\"\n\n\"Not at present,\" replied the Captain, with a monstrous twinkle in his\neye.\n\nThe clock was striking ten when the party broke up. The Captain walked\nto the \"Mariner's Home\" with his guest, in order to question him\nregarding his future movements.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said he, \"I ain't as young as I was, an' I don't cal'ulate\nto go to sea no more. I proposes to drop anchor here, an' hug the\nland until the old hulk goes to pieces. I've got two or three thousand\ndollars in the locker, an' expects to get on uncommon comfortable\nwithout askin' no odds from the Assylum for Decayed Mariners.\"\n\nMy grandfather indorsed the plan warmly, and Sailor Ben did drop anchor\nin Rivermouth, where he speedily became one of the institutions of the\ntown.\n\nHis first step was to buy a small one-story cottage located at the\nhead of the wharf, within gun-shot of the Nutter House. To the great\namusement of my grandfather, Sailor Ben painted the cottage a light\nsky-blue, and ran a broad black stripe around it just under the eaves.\nIn this stripe he painted white port-holes, at regular distances, making\nhis residence look as much like a man-of-war as possible. With a short\nflag-staff projecting over the door like a bowsprit, the effect was\nquite magical. My description of the exterior of this palatial residence\nis complete when I add that the proprietor nailed a horseshoe against\nthe front door to keep off the witches--a very necessary precaution in\nthese latitudes.\n\nThe inside of Sailor Ben's abode was not less striking than the outside.\nThe cottage contained two rooms; the one opening on the wharf he\ncalled his cabin; here he ate and slept. His few tumblers and a frugal\ncollection of crockery were set in a rack suspended over the table,\nwhich had a cleat of wood nailed round the edge to prevent the dishes\nfrom sliding off in case of a heavy sea. Hanging against the walls\nwere three or four highly colored prints of celebrated frigates, and\na lithograph picture of a rosy young woman insufficiently clad in the\nAmerican flag. This was labelled \"Kitty,\" though I'm sure it looked no\nmore like her than I did. A walrus-tooth with an Esquimaux engraved on\nit, a shark's jaw, and the blade of a sword-fish were among the enviable\ndecorations of this apartment. In one corner stood his bunk, or bed,\nand in the other his well-worn sea-chest, a perfect Pandora's box of\nmysteries. You would have thought yourself in the cabin of a real ship.\n\nThe little room aft, separated from the cabin by a sliding door, was the\ncaboose. It held a cooking-stove, pots, pans, and groceries; also a lot\nof fishing-lines and coils of tarred twine, which made the place smell\nlike a forecastle, and a delightful smell it is--to those who fancy it.\n\nKitty didn't leave our service, but played housekeeper for both\nestablishments, returning at night to Sailor Ben's. He shortly added\na wherry to his worldly goods, and in the fishing season made a very\nhandsome income. During the winter he employed himself manufacturing\ncrab-nets, for which he found no lack of customers.\n\nHis popularity among the boys was immense. A jackknife in his expert\nhand was a whole chest of tools. He could whittle out anything from a\nwooden chain to a Chinese pagoda, or a full-rigged seventy-four a foot\nlong. To own a ship of Sailor Ben's building was to be exalted above\nyour fellow-creatures. He didn't carve many, and those he refused to\nsell, choosing to present them to his young friends, of whom Tom Bailey,\nyou may be sure, was one.\n\nHow delightful it was of winter nights to sit in his cosey cabin, close\nto the ship's stove (he wouldn't hear of having a fireplace), and listen\nto Sailor Ben's yarns! In the early summer twilights, when he sat on\nthe door-step splicing a rope or mending a net, he always had a bevy of\nblooming young faces alongside.\n\nThe dear old fellow! How tenderly the years touched him after this--all\nthe more tenderly, it seemed, for having roughed him so cruelly in other\ndays!\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seventeen--How We Astonished the Rivermouthians\n\n\nSailor Ben's arrival partly drove the New Orleans project from my brain.\nBesides, there was just then a certain movement on foot by the Centipede\nClub which helped to engross my attention.\n\nPepper Whitcomb took the Captain's veto philosophically, observing that\nhe thought from the first the governor wouldn't let me go. I don't think\nPepper was quite honest in that.\n\nBut to the subject in hand.\n\nAmong the few changes that have taken place in Rivermouth during the\npast twenty years there is one which I regret. I lament the removal of\nall those varnished iron cannon which used to do duty as posts at\nthe corners of streets leading from the river. They were quaintly\nornamental, each set upon end with a solid shot soldered into its mouth,\nand gave to that part of the town a picturesqueness very poorly atoned\nfor by the conventional wooden stakes that have deposed them.\n\nThese guns (\"old sogers\" the boys called them) had their story, like\neverything else in Rivermouth. When that everlasting last war--the War of\n1812, I mean--came to an end, all the brigs, schooners, and barks fitted\nout at this port as privateers were as eager to get rid of their useless\ntwelve-pounders and swivels as they had previously been to obtain them.\nMany of the pieces had cost large sums, and now they were little better\nthan so much crude iron--not so good, in fact, for they were clumsy\nthings to break up and melt over. The government didn't want them;\nprivate citizens didn't want them; they were a drug in the market.\n\nBut there was one man, ridiculous beyond his generation, who got it into\nhis head that a fortune was to be made out of these same guns. To buy\nthem all, to hold on to them until war was declared again (as he had\nno doubt it would be in a few months), and then sell out at fabulous\nprices--this was the daring idea that addled the pate of Silas Trefethen,\n\"Dealer in E. & W. I. Goods and Groceries,\" as the faded sign over his\nshop-door informed the public.\n\nSilas went shrewdly to work, buying up every old cannon he could lay\nhands on. His back-yard was soon crowded with broken-down gun-carriages,\nand his barn with guns, like an arsenal. When Silas's purpose got wind\nit was astonishing how valuable that thing became which just now was\nworth nothing at all.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" thought Silas. \"Somebody else is tryin' hi git control of the\nmarket. But I guess I've got the start of him.\"\n\nSo he went on buying and buying, oftentimes paying double the original\nprice of the article. People in the neighboring towns collected all\nthe worthless ordnance they could find, and sent it by the cart-load to\nRivermouth.\n\nWhen his barn was full, Silas began piling the rubbish in his cellar,\nthen in his parlor. He mortgaged the stock of his grocery store,\nmortgaged his house, his barn, his horse, and would have mortgaged\nhimself, if anyone would have taken him as security, in order to carry\non the grand speculation. He was a ruined man, and as happy as a lark.\n\nSurely poor Silas was cracked, like the majority of his own cannon. More\nor less crazy he must have been always. Years before this he purchased\nan elegant rosewood coffin, and kept it in one of the spare rooms in his\nresidence. He even had his name engraved on the silver-plate, leaving a\nblank after the word \"Died.\"\n\nThe blank was filled up in due time, and well it was for Silas that he\nsecured so stylish a coffin in his opulent days, for when he died his\nworldly wealth would not have bought him a pine box, to say nothing of\nrosewood. He never gave up expecting a war with Great Britain. Hopeful\nand radiant to the last, his dying words were, England--war--few\ndays--great profits!\n\nIt was that sweet old lady, Dame Jocelyn, who told me the story of Silas\nTrefethen; for these things happened long before my day. Silas died in\n1817.\n\nAt Trefethen's death his unique collection came under the auctioneer's\nhammer. Some of the larger guns were sold to the town, and planted at\nthe corners of divers streets; others went off to the iron-foundry; the\nbalance, numbering twelve, were dumped down on a deserted wharf at the\nfoot of Anchor Lane, where, summer after summer, they rested at their\nease in the grass and fungi, pelted in autumn by the rain and annually\nburied by the winter snow. It is with these twelve guns that our story\nhas to deal.\n\nThe wharf where they reposed was shut off from the street by a high\nfence--a silent dreamy old wharf, covered with strange weeds and mosses.\nOn account of its seclusion and the good fishing it afforded, it was\nmuch frequented by us boys.\n\nThere we met many an afternoon to throw out our lines, or play\nleap-frog among the rusty cannon. They were famous fellows in our eyes.\nWhat a racket they had made in the heyday of their unchastened youth!\nWhat stories they might tell now, if their puffy metallic lips could\nonly speak! Once they were lively talkers enough; but there the grim\nsea-dogs lay, silent and forlorn in spite of all their former growlings.\n\nThey always seemed to me like a lot of venerable disabled tars,\nstretched out on a lawn in front of a hospital, gazing seaward, and\nmutely lamenting their lost youth.\n\nBut once more they were destined to lift up their dolorous voices--once\nmore ere they keeled over and lay speechless for all time. And this is\nhow it befell.\n\nJack Harris, Charley Marden, Harry Blake, and myself were fishing\noff the wharf one afternoon, when a thought flashed upon me like an\ninspiration.\n\n\"I say, boys!\" I cried, hauling in my line hand over hand, \"I've got\nsomething!\"\n\n\"What does it pull like, youngster?\" asked Harris, looking down at the\ntaut line and expecting to see a big perch at least.\n\n\"O, nothing in the fish way,\" I returned, laughing; \"it's about the old\nguns.\"\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\n\"I was thinking what jolly fun it would be to set one of the old sogers\non his legs and serve him out a ration of gunpowder.\"\n\nUp came the three lines in a jiffy. An enterprise better suited to the\ndisposition of my companions could not have been proposed.\n\nIn a short time we had one of the smaller cannon over on its back and\nwere busy scraping the green rust from the touch-hole. The mould had\nspiked the gun so effectually, that for a while we fancied we should\nhave to give up our attempt to resuscitate the old soger.\n\n\"A long gimlet would clear it out,\" said Charley Marden, \"if we only had\none.\"\n\nI looked to see if Sailor Ben's flag was flying at the cabin door, for\nhe always took in the colors when he went off fishing.\n\n\"When you want to know if the Admiral's aboard, jest cast an eye to the\nbuntin', my hearties,\" says Sailor Ben.\n\nSometimes in a jocose mood he called himself the Admiral, and I am\nsure he deserved to be one. The Admiral's flag was flying, and I soon\nprocured a gimlet from his carefully kept tool-chest.\n\nBefore long we had the gun in working order. A newspaper lashed to the\nend of a lath served as a swab to dust out the bore. Jack Harris blew\nthrough the touch-hole and pronounced all clear.\n\nSeeing our task accomplished so easily, we turned our attention to\nthe other guns, which lay in all sorts of postures in the rank grass.\nBorrowing a rope from Sailor Ben, we managed with immense labor to drag\nthe heavy pieces into position and place a brick under each muzzle to\ngive it the proper elevation. When we beheld them all in a row, like a\nregular battery, we simultaneously conceived an idea, the magnitude of\nwhich struck us dumb for a moment.\n\nOur first intention was to load and fire a single gun. How feeble and\ninsignificant was such a plan compared to that which now sent the light\ndancing into our eyes!\n\n\"What could we have been thinking of?\" cried Jack Harris. \"We'll give\n'em a broadside, to be sure, if we die for it!\"\n\nWe turned to with a will, and before nightfall had nearly half the\nbattery overhauled and ready for service. To keep the artillery dry we\nstuffed wads of loose hemp into the muzzles, and fitted wooden pegs to\nthe touch-holes.\n\nAt recess the next noon the Centipedes met in a corner of the\nschool-yard to talk over the proposed lark. The original projectors,\nthough they would have liked to keep the thing secret, were obliged\nto make a club matter of it, inasmuch as funds were required for\nammunition. There had been no recent drain on the treasury, and the\nsociety could well afford to spend a few dollars in so notable an\nundertaking.\n\nIt was unanimously agreed that the plan should be carried out in the\nhandsomest manner, and a subscription to that end was taken on the spot.\nSeveral of the Centipedes hadn't a cent, excepting the one strung around\ntheir necks; others, however, were richer. I chanced to have a dollar,\nand it went into the cap quicker than lightning. When the club, in view\nof my munificence, voted to name the guns Bailey's Battery I was prouder\nthan I have ever been since over anything.\n\nThe money thus raised, added to that already in the treasury, amounted\nto nine dollars--a fortune in those days; but not more than we had use\nfor. This sum was divided into twelve parts, for it would not do for one\nboy to buy all the powder, nor even for us all to make our purchases at\nthe same place. That would excite suspicion at any time, particularly at\na period so remote from the Fourth of July.\n\nThere were only three stores in town licensed to sell powder; that gave\neach store four customers. Not to run the slightest risk of remark,\none boy bought his powder on Monday, the next boy on Tuesday, and so on\nuntil the requisite quantity was in our possession. This we put into a\nkeg and carefully hid in a dry spot on the wharf.\n\nOur next step was to finish cleaning the guns, which occupied two\nafternoons, for several of the old sogers were in a very congested state\nindeed. Having completed the task, we came upon a difficulty. To set\noff the battery by daylight was out of the question; it must be done at\nnight; it must be done with fuses, for no doubt the neighbors would\nturn out after the first two or three shots, and it would not pay to be\ncaught in the vicinity.\n\nWho knew anything about fuses? Who could arrange it so the guns would go\noff one after the other, with an interval of a minute or so between?\n\nTheoretically we knew that a minute fuse lasted a minute; double the\nquantity, two minutes; but practically we were at a stand-still. There\nwas but one person who could help us in this extremity--Sailor Ben. To\nme was assigned the duty of obtaining what information I could from the\nex-gunner, it being left to my discretion whether or not to intrust him\nwith our secret.\n\nSo one evening I dropped into the cabin and artfully turned the\nconversation to fuses in general, and then to particular fuses, but\nwithout getting much out of the old boy, who was busy making a twine\nhammock. Finally, I was forced to divulge the whole plot.\n\nThe Admiral had a sailor's love for a joke, and entered at once and\nheartily into our scheme. He volunteered to prepare the fuses himself,\nand I left the labor in his hands, having bound him by several\nextraordinary oaths--such as \"Hope-I-may-die\" and \"Shiver-my-timbers\"--not\nto betray us, come what would.\n\nThis was Monday evening. On Wednesday the fuses were ready. That night\nwe were to unmuzzle Bailey's Battery. Mr. Grimshaw saw that something\nwas wrong somewhere, for we were restless and absent-minded in the\nclasses, and the best of us came to grief before the morning session was\nover. When Mr. Grimshaw announced \"Guy Fawkes\" as the subject for our\nnext composition, you might have knocked down the Mystic Twelve with a\nfeather.\n\nThe coincidence was certainly curious, but when a man has committed,\nor is about to commit an offence, a hundred trifles, which would pass\nunnoticed at another time, seem to point at him with convicting fingers.\nNo doubt Guy Fawkes himself received many a start after he had got his\nwicked kegs of gunpowder neatly piled up under the House of Lords.\n\nWednesday, as I have mentioned, was a half-holiday, and the Centipedes\nassembled in my barn to decide on the final arrangements. These were\nas simple as could be. As the fuses were connected, it needed but one\nperson to fire the train. Hereupon arose a discussion as to who was the\nproper person. Some argued that I ought to apply the match, the battery\nbeing christened after me, and the main idea, moreover, being mine.\nOthers advocated the claim of Phil Adams as the oldest boy. At last we\ndrew lots for the post of honor.\n\nTwelve slips of folded paper, upon one of which was written \"Thou art\nthe man,\" were placed in a quart measure, and thoroughly shaken; then\neach member stepped up and lifted out his destiny. At a given signal we\nopened our billets. \"Thou art the man,\" said the slip of paper trembling\nin my fingers. The sweets and anxieties of a leader were mine the rest\nof the afternoon.\n\nDirectly after twilight set in Phil Adams stole down to the wharf and\nfixed the fuses to the guns, laying a train of powder from the principal\nfuse to the fence, through a chink of which I was to drop the match at\nmidnight.\n\nAt ten o'clock Rivermouth goes to bed. At eleven o'clock Rivermouth is\nas quiet as a country churchyard. At twelve o'clock there is nothing\nleft with which to compare the stillness that broods over the little\nseaport.\n\nIn the midst of this stillness I arose and glided out of the house like\na phantom bent on an evil errand; like a phantom. I flitted through the\nsilent street, hardly drawing breath until I knelt down beside the fence\nat the appointed place.\n\nPausing a moment for my heart to stop thumping, I lighted the match\nand shielded it with both hands until it was well under way, and then\ndropped the blazing splinter on the slender thread of gunpowder.\n\nA noiseless flash instantly followed, and all was dark again. I peeped\nthrough the crevice in the fence, and saw the main fuse spitting out\nsparks like a conjurer. Assured that the train had not failed, I took\nto my heels, fearful lest the fuse might burn more rapidly than we\ncalculated, and cause an explosion before I could get home. This,\nluckily, did not happen. There's a special Providence that watches over\nidiots, drunken men, and boys.\n\nI dodged the ceremony of undressing by plunging into bed, jacket, boots,\nand all. I am not sure I took off my cap; but I know that I had hardly\npulled the coverlid over me, when \"BOOM!\" sounded the first gun of\nBailey's Battery.\n\nI lay as still as a mouse. In less than two minutes there was another\nburst of thunder, and then another. The third gun was a tremendous\nfellow and fairly shook the house.\n\nThe town was waking up. Windows were thrown open here and there and\npeople called to each other across the streets asking what that firing\nwas for.\n\n\"BOOM!\" went gun number four.\n\nI sprung out of bed and tore off my jacket, for I heard the Captain\nfeeling his way along the wall to my chamber. I was half undressed by\nthe time he found the knob of the door.\n\n\"I say, sir,\" I cried, \"do you hear those guns?\"\n\n\"Not being deaf, I do,\" said the Captain, a little tartly--any reflection\non his hearing always nettled him; \"but what on earth they are for I\ncan't conceive. You had better get up and dress yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm nearly dressed, sir.\"\n\n\"BOOM! BOOM!\"--two of the guns had gone off together.\n\nThe door of Miss Abigail's bedroom opened hastily, and that pink of\nmaidenly propriety stepped out into the hail in her night-gown--the only\nindecorous thing I ever knew her to do. She held a lighted candle in her\nhand and looked like a very aged Lady Macbeth.\n\n\"O Dan'el, this is dreadful! What do you suppose it means?\"\n\n\"I really can't suppose,\" said the Captain, rubbing his ear; \"but I\nguess it's over now.\"\n\n\"BOOM!\" said Bailey's Battery.\n\nRivermouth was wide awake now, and half the male population were in the\nstreets, running different ways, for the firing seemed to proceed from\nopposite points of the town. Everybody waylaid everybody else with\nquestions; but as no one knew what was the occasion of the tumult,\npeople who were not usually nervous began to be oppressed by the\nmystery.\n\nSome thought the town was being bombarded; some thought the world was\ncoming to an end, as the pious and ingenious Mr. Miller had predicted\nit would; but those who couldn't form any theory whatever were the most\nperplexed.\n\nIn the meanwhile Bailey's Battery bellowed away at regular intervals.\nThe greatest confusion reigned everywhere by this time. People with\nlanterns rushed hither and thither. The town watch had turned out to\na man, and marched off, in admirable order, in the wrong direction.\nDiscovering their mistake, they retraced their steps, and got down to\nthe wharf just as the last cannon belched forth its lightning.\n\nA dense cloud of sulphurous smoke floated over Anchor Lane, obscuring\nthe starlight. Two or three hundred people, in various stages of\nexcitement, crowded about the upper end of the wharf, not liking to\nadvance farther until they were satisfied that the explosions were\nover. A board was here and there blown from the fence, and through\nthe openings thus afforded a few of the more daring spirits at length\nventured to crawl.\n\nThe cause of the racket soon transpired. A suspicion that they had\nbeen sold gradually dawned on the Rivermouthians. Many were exceedingly\nindignant, and declared that no penalty was severe enough for those\nconcerned in such a prank; others--and these were the very people who\nhad been terrified nearly out of their wits--had the assurance to laugh,\nsaying that they knew all along it was only a trick.\n\nThe town watch boldly took possession of the ground, and the crowd began\nto disperse. Knots of gossips lingered here and there near the place,\nindulging in vain surmises as to who the invisible gunners could be.\n\nThere was no more noise that night, but many a timid person lay awake\nexpecting a renewal of the mysterious cannonading. The Oldest Inhabitant\nrefused to go to bed on any terms, but persisted in sitting up in a\nrocking-chair, with his hat and mittens on, until daybreak.\n\nI thought I should never get to sleep. The moment I drifted off in a\ndoze I fell to laughing and woke myself up. But towards morning slumber\novertook me, and I had a series of disagreeable dreams, in one of which\nI was waited upon by the ghost of Silas Trefethen with an exorbitant\nbill for the use of his guns. In another, I was dragged before a\ncourt-martial and sentenced by Sailor Ben, in a frizzled wig and\nthree-cornered cocked hat, to be shot to death by Bailey's Battery--a\nsentence which Sailor Ben was about to execute with his own hand, when\nI suddenly opened my eyes and found the sunshine lying pleasantly across\nmy face. I tell you I was glad!\n\nThat unaccountable fascination which leads the guilty to hover about the\nspot where his crime was committed drew me down to the wharf as soon as\nI was dressed. Phil Adams, Jack Harris, and others of the conspirators\nwere already there, examining with a mingled feeling of curiosity and\napprehension the havoc accomplished by the battery.\n\nThe fence was badly shattered and the ground ploughed up for several\nyards round the place where the guns formerly lay--formerly lay, for\nnow they were scattered every which way. There was scarcely a gun that\nhadn't burst. Here was one ripped open from muzzle to breech, and there\nwas another with its mouth blown into the shape of a trumpet. Three of\nthe guns had disappeared bodily, but on looking over the edge of the\nwharf we saw them standing on end in the tide-mud. They had popped\noverboard in their excitement.\n\n\"I tell you what, fellows,\" whispered Phil Adams, \"it is lucky we didn't\ntry to touch 'em off with punk. They'd have blown us all to flinders.\"\n\nThe destruction of Bailey's Battery was not, unfortunately, the only\ncatastrophe. A fragment of one of the cannon had earned away the chimney\nof Sailor Ben's cabin. He was very mad at first, but having prepared the\nfuse himself he didn't dare complain openly.\n\n\"I'd have taken a reef in the blessed stove-pipe,\" said the Admiral,\ngazing ruefully at the smashed chimney, \"if I had known as how the\nFlagship was agoin' to be under fire.\"\n\nThe next day he rigged out an iron funnel, which, being in sections,\ncould be detached and taken in at a moment's notice. On the whole,\nI think he was resigned to the demolition of his brick chimney. The\nstove-pipe was a great deal more shipshape.\n\nThe town was not so easily appeased. The selectmen determined to make\nan example of the guilty parties, and offered a reward for their arrest,\nholding out a promise of pardon to anyone of the offenders who would\nfurnish information against the rest. But there were no faint hearts\namong the Centipedes. Suspicion rested for a while on several persons--on\nthe soldiers at the fort; on a crazy fellow, known about town as\n\"Bottle-Nose\"; and at last on Sailor Ben.\n\n\"Shiver my timbers!\" cries that deeply injured individual. \"Do you\nsuppose, sir, as I have lived to sixty year, an' ain't got no more sense\nthan to go for to blaze away at my own upper riggin'? It doesn't stand\nto reason.\"\n\nIt certainly did not seem probable that Mr. Watson would maliciously\nknock over his own chimney, and Lawyer Hackett, who had the case in\nhand, 'bowed himself out of the Admiral's cabin convinced that the right\nman had not been discovered.\n\nPeople living by the sea are always more or less superstitious. Stories\nof spectre ships and mysterious beacons, that lure vessels out of their\ncourse and wreck them on unknown reefs, were among the stock legends of\nRivermouth; and not a few people in the town were ready to attribute the\nfiring of those guns to some supernatural agency. The Oldest Inhabitant\nremembered that when he was a boy a dim-looking sort of schooner hove\nto in the offing one foggy afternoon, fired off a single gun that didn't\nmake any report, and then crumbled to nothing, spar, mast, and hulk,\nlike a piece of burnt paper.\n\nThe authorities, however, were of the opinion that human hands had\nsomething to do with the explosions, and they resorted to deep-laid\nstratagems to get hold of the said hands. One of their traps came very\nnear catching us. They artfully caused an old brass fieldpiece to be\nleft on a wharf near the scene of our late operations. Nothing in the\nworld but the lack of money to buy powder saved us from falling into\nthe clutches of the two watchmen who lay secreted for a week in a\nneighboring sail-loft.\n\nIt was many a day before the midnight bombardment ceased to be the\ntown-talk. The trick was so audacious and on so grand a scale that\nnobody thought for an instant of connecting us lads with it.\nSuspicion at length grew weary of lighting on the wrong person, and\nas conjecture--like the physicians in the epitaph--was in vain, the\nRivermouthians gave up the idea of finding out who had astonished them.\n\nThey never did find out, and never will, unless they read this veracious\nhistory. If the selectmen are still disposed to punish the malefactors,\nI can supply Lawyer Hackett with evidence enough to convict Pepper\nWhitcomb, Phil Adams, Charley Marden, and the other honorable members of\nthe Centipede Club. But really I don't think it would pay now.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eighteen--A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go\n\n\nIf the reader supposes that I lived all this while in Rivermouth without\nfalling a victim to one or more of the young ladies attending Miss\nDorothy Gibbs's Female Institute, why, then, all I have to say is the\nreader exhibits his ignorance of human nature.\n\nMiss Gibbs's seminary was located within a few minutes' walk of the\nTemple Grammar School, and numbered about thirty-five pupils, the\nmajority of whom boarded at the Hall--Primrose Hall, as Miss Dorothy\nprettily called it. The Prim-roses, as we called them, ranged from\nseven years of age to sweet seventeen, and a prettier group of sirens\nnever got together even in Rivermouth, for Rivermouth, you should know,\nis famous for its pretty girls.\n\nThere were tall girls and short girls, rosy girls and pale girls, and\ngirls as brown as berries; girls like Amazons, slender girls, weird\nand winning like Undine, girls with black tresses, girls with auburn\nringlets, girls with every tinge of golden hair. To behold Miss\nDorothy's young ladies of a Sunday morning walking to church two by two,\nthe smallest toddling at the end of the procession, like the bobs at the\ntail of a kite, was a spectacle to fill with tender emotion the least\nsusceptible heart. To see Miss Dorothy marching grimly at the head of\nher light infantry, was to feel the hopelessness of making an attack on\nany part of the column.\n\nShe was a perfect dragon of watchfulness. The most unguarded lifting of\nan eyelash in the fluttering battalion was sufficient to put her on the\nlookout. She had had experiences with the male sex, this Miss Dorothy\nso prim and grim. It was whispered that her heart was a tattered album\nscrawled over with love-lines, but that she had shut up the volume long\nago.\n\nThere was a tradition that she had been crossed in love; but it was the\nfaintest of traditions. A gay young lieutenant of marines had flirted\nwith her at a country ball (A.D. 1811), and then marched carelessly away\nat the head of his company to the shrill music of the fife, without so\nmuch as a sigh for the girl he left behind him. The years rolled on, the\ngallant gay Lothario--which wasn't his name--married, became a father,\nand then a grandfather; and at the period of which I am speaking his\ngrandchild was actually one of Miss Dorothy's young ladies. So, at\nleast, ran the story.\n\nThe lieutenant himself was dead these many years; but Miss Dorothy never\ngot over his duplicity. She was convinced that the sole aim of mankind\nwas to win the unguarded affection of maidens, and then march off\ntreacherously with flying colors to the heartless music of the drum and\nfife. To shield the inmates of Primrose Hall from the bitter influences\nthat had blighted her own early affections was Miss Dorothy's mission in\nlife.\n\n\"No wolves prowling about my lambs, if you please,\" said\n\nMiss Dorothy. \"I will not allow it.\"\n\nShe was as good as her word. I don't think the boy lives who ever set\nfoot within the limits of Primrose Hall while the seminary was under her\ncharge. Perhaps if Miss Dorothy had given her young ladies a little more\nliberty, they would not have thought it \"such fun\" to make eyes over the\nwhite lattice fence at the young gentlemen of the Temple Grammar School.\nI say perhaps; for it is one thing to manage thirty-five young ladies\nand quite another thing to talk about it.\n\nBut all Miss Dorothy's vigilance could not prevent the young folks\nfrom meeting in the town now and then, nor could her utmost ingenuity\ninterrupt postal arrangements. There was no end of notes passing between\nthe students and the Primroses. Notes tied to the heads of arrows were\nshot into dormitory windows; notes were tucked under fences, and hidden\nin the trunks of decayed trees. Every thick place in the boxwood hedge\nthat surrounded the seminary was a possible post-office.\n\nIt was a terrible shock to Miss Dorothy the day she unearthed a nest of\nletters in one of the huge wooden urns surmounting the gateway that led\nto her dovecot. It was a bitter moment to Miss Phoebe and Miss Candace\nand Miss Hesba, when they had their locks of hair grimly handed back\nto them by Miss Gibbs in the presence of the whole school. Girls whose\nlocks of hair had run the blockade in safety were particularly severe on\nthe offenders. But it didn't stop other notes and other tresses, and I\nwould like to know what can stop them while the earth holds together.\n\nNow when I first came to Rivermouth I looked upon girls as rather tame\ncompany; I hadn't a spark of sentiment concerning them; but seeing my\ncomrades sending and receiving mysterious epistles, wearing bits of\nribbon in their button-holes and leaving packages of confectionery\n(generally lemon-drops) in the hollow trunks of trees--why, I felt that\nthis was the proper thing to do. I resolved, as a matter of duty, to\nfall in love with somebody, and I didn't care in the least who it was.\nIn much the same mood that Don Quixote selected the Dulcinea del Toboso\nfor his lady-love, I singled out one of Miss Dorothy's incomparable\nyoung ladies for mine.\n\nI debated a long while whether I should not select two, but at last\nsettled down on one--a pale little girl with blue eyes, named Alice. I\nshall not make a long story of this, for Alice made short work of\nme. She was secretly in love with Pepper Whitcomb. This occasioned a\ntemporary coolness between Pepper and myself.\n\nNot disheartened, however, I placed Laura Rice--I believe it was Laura\nRice--in the vacant niche. The new idol was more cruel than the old.\nThe former frankly sent me to the right about, but the latter was a\ndeceitful lot. She wore my nosegay in her dress at the evening service\n(the Primroses were marched to church three times every Sunday), she\npenned me the daintiest of notes, she sent me the glossiest of ringlets\n(cut, as I afterwards found out, from the stupid head of Miss Gibbs's\nchamber-maid), and at the same time was holding me and my pony up to\nridicule in a series of letters written to Jack Harris. It was Harris\nhimself who kindly opened my eyes.\n\n\"I tell you what, Bailey,\" said that young gentleman, \"Laura is an old\nveteran, and carries too many guns for a youngster. She can't resist a\nflirtation; I believe she'd flirt with an infant in arms. There's hardly\na fellow in the school that hasn't worn her colors and some of her hair.\nShe doesn't give out any more of her own hair now. It's been pretty well\nused up. The demand was greater than the supply, you see. It's all very\nwell to correspond with Laura, but as to looking for anything serious\nfrom her, the knowing ones don't. Hope I haven't hurt your feelings,\nold boy,\" (that was a soothing stroke of flattery to call me \"old boy,\")\n\"but it was my duty as a friend and a Centipede to let you know who you\nwere dealing with.\"\n\nSuch was the advice given me by that time-stricken, careworn, and\nembittered man of the world, who was sixteen years old if he was a day.\n\nI dropped Laura. In the course of the next twelve months I had perhaps\nthree or four similar experiences, and the conclusion was forced upon\nme that I was not a boy likely to distinguish myself in this branch of\nbusiness.\n\nI fought shy of Primrose Hall from that moment. Smiles were smiled over\nthe boxwood hedge, and little hands were occasionally kissed to me;\nbut I only winked my eye patronizingly, and passed on. I never renewed\ntender relations with Miss Gibbs's young ladies. All this occurred\nduring my first year and a half at Rivermouth.\n\nBetween my studies at school, my out-door recreations, and the hurts my\nvanity received, I managed to escape for the time being any very serious\nattack of that love fever which, like the measles, is almost certain to\nseize upon a boy sooner or later. I was not to be an exception. I was\nmerely biding my time. The incidents I have now to relate took place\nshortly after the events described in the last chapter.\n\n\nIn a life so tranquil and circumscribed as ours in the Nutter House, a\nvisitor was a novelty of no little importance. The whole household awoke\nfrom its quietude one morning when the Captain announced that a young\nniece of his from New York was to spend a few weeks with us.\n\nThe blue-chintz room, into which a ray of sun was never allowed to\npenetrate, was thrown open and dusted, and its mouldy air made sweet\nwith a bouquet of pot-roses placed on the old-fashioned bureau. Kitty\nwas busy all the forenoon washing off the sidewalk and sand-papering the\ngreat brass knocker on our front-door; and Miss Abigail was up to her\nelbows in a pigeon-pie.\n\nI felt sure it was for no ordinary person that all these preparations\nwere in progress; and I was right. Miss Nelly Glentworth was no ordinary\nperson. I shall never believe she was. There may have been lovelier\nwomen, though I have never seen them; there may have been more brilliant\nwomen, though it has not been my fortune to meet them; but that there\nwas ever a more charming one than Nelly Glentworth is a proposition\nagainst which I contend.\n\nI don't love her now. I don't think of her once in five years; and\nyet it would give me a turn if in the course of my daily walk I should\nsuddenly come upon her eldest boy. I may say that her eldest boy was\nnot playing a prominent part in this life when I first made her\nacquaintance.\n\nIt was a drizzling, cheerless afternoon towards the end of summer that\na hack drew up at the door of the Nutter House. The Captain and Miss\nAbigail hastened into the hall on hearing the carriage stop. In a moment\nmore Miss Nelly Glentworth was seated in our sitting-room undergoing\na critical examination at the hands of a small boy who lounged\nuncomfortably on a settee between the windows.\n\nThe small boy considered himself a judge of girls, and he rapidly came\nto the following conclusions: That Miss Nelly was about nineteen; that\nshe had not given away much of her back hair, which hung in two massive\nchestnut braids over her shoulders; that she was a shade too pale and a\ntrifle too tall; that her hands were nicely shaped and her feet much\ntoo diminutive for daily use. He furthermore observed that her voice was\nmusical, and that her face lighted up with an indescribable brightness\nwhen she smiled.\n\nOn the whole, the small boy liked her well enough; and, satisfied that\nshe was not a person to be afraid of, but, on the contrary, one who\nmight be made quite agreeable, he departed to keep an appointment with\nhis friend Sir Pepper Whitcomb.\n\nBut the next morning when Miss Glentworth came down to breakfast in a\npurple dress, her face as fresh as one of the moss-roses on the bureau\nupstairs, and her laugh as contagious as the merriment of a robin, the\nsmall boy experienced a strange sensation, and mentally compared her\nwith the loveliest of Miss Gibbs's young ladies, and found those young\nladies wanting in the balance.\n\nA night's rest had wrought a wonderful change in Miss Nelly. The pallor\nand weariness of the journey had passed away. I looked at her through\nthe toast-rack and thought I had never seen anything more winning than\nher smile.\n\nAfter breakfast she went out with me to the stable to see Gypsy, and the\nthree of us became friends then and there. Nelly was the only girl that\nGypsy ever took the slightest notice of.\n\nIt chanced to be a half-holiday, and a baseball match of unusual\ninterest was to come off on the school ground that afternoon; but,\nsomehow, I didn't go. I hung about the house abstractedly. The Captain\nwent up town, and Miss Abigail was busy in the kitchen making immortal\ngingerbread. I drifted into the sitting-room, and had our guest all to\nmyself for I don't know how many hours. It was twilight, I recollect,\nwhen the Captain returned with letters for Miss Nelly.\n\nMany a time after that I sat with her through the dreamy September\nafternoons. If I had played baseball it would have been much better for\nme.\n\nThose first days of Miss Nelly's visit are very misty in my remembrance.\nI try in vain to remember just when I began to fall in love with her.\n'Whether the spell worked upon me gradually or fell upon me all at once,\nI don't know. I only know that it seemed to me as if I had always loved\nher. Things that took place before she came were dim to me, like events\nthat had occurred in the Middle Ages.\n\nNelly was at least five years my senior. But what of that? Adam is the\nonly man I ever heard of who didn't in early youth fall in love with a\nwoman older than himself, and I am convinced that he would have done so\nif he had had the opportunity.\n\nI wonder if girls from fifteen to twenty are aware of the glamour they\ncast over the straggling, awkward boys whom they regard and treat as\nmere children? I wonder, now. Young women are so keen in such matters.\nI wonder if Miss Nelly Glentworth never suspected until the very last\nnight of her visit at Rivermouth that I was over ears in love with her\npretty self, and was suffering pangs as poignant as if I had been\nten feet high and as old as Methuselah? For, indeed, I was miserable\nthroughout all those five weeks. I went down in the Latin class at the\nrate of three boys a day. Her fresh young eyes came between me and my\nbook, and there was an end of Virgil.\n\n     \"O love, love, love!\n     Love is like a dizziness,\n     It winna let a body\n     Gang aboot his business.\"\n\nI was wretched away from her, and only less wretched in her presence.\nThe special cause of my woe was this: I was simply a little boy to Miss\nGlentworth. I knew it. I bewailed it. I ground my teeth and wept in\nsecret over the fact. If I had been aught else in her eyes would she\nhave smoothed my hair so carelessly, sending an electric shock through\nmy whole system? Would she have walked with me, hand in hand, for hours\nin the old garden, and once when I lay on the sofa, my head aching with\nlove and mortification, would she have stooped down and kissed me if I\nhadn't been a little boy? How I despised little boys! How I hated one\nparticular little boy--too little to be loved!\n\nI smile over this very grimly even now. My sorrow was genuine and\nbitter. It is a great mistake on the part of elderly people, male and\nfemale, to tell a child that he is seeing his happiest days. Don't you\nbelieve a word of it, my little friend. The burdens of childhood are as\nhard to bear as the crosses that weigh us down later in life, while the\nhappinesses of childhood are tame compared with those of our maturer\nyears. And even if this were not so, it is rank cruelty to throw shadows\nover the young heart by croaking, \"Be merry, for to-morrow you die!\"\n\nAs the last days of Nelly's visit drew near, I fell into a very\nunhealthy state of mind. To have her so frank and unconsciously\ncoquettish with me was a daily torment; to be looked upon and treated as\na child was bitter almonds; but the thought of losing her altogether was\ndistraction.\n\nThe summer was at an end. The days were perceptibly shorter, and now and\nthen came an evening when it was chilly enough to have a wood-fire in\nour sitting-room. The leaves were beginning to take hectic tints, and\nthe wind was practising the minor pathetic notes of its autumnal\ndirge. Nature and myself appeared to be approaching our dissolution\nsimultaneously--\n\nOne evening, the evening previous to the day set for Nelly's\ndeparture--how well I remember it--I found her sitting alone by the wide\nchimney-piece looking musingly at the crackling back log. There were\nno candles in the room. On her face and hands, and on the small golden\ncross at her throat, fell the flickering firelight--that ruddy, mellow\nfirelight in which one's grandmother would look poetical.\n\nI drew a low stool from the corner and placed it by the side of her\nchair. She reached out her hand to me, as was her pretty fashion, and so\nwe sat for several moments silently in the changing glow of the burning\nlogs. At length I moved back the stool so that I could see her face in\nprofile without being seen by her. I lost her hand by this movement, but\nI couldn't have spoken with the listless touch of her fingers on mine.\nAfter two or three attempts I said \"Nelly\" a good deal louder than I\nintended.\n\nPerhaps the effort it cost me was evident in my voice. She raised\nherself quickly in the chair and half turned towards me.\n\n\"Well, Tom?\"\n\n\"I--I am very sorry you are going away.\"\n\n\"So am I. I have enjoyed every hour of my visit.\"\n\n\"Do you think you will ever come back here?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Nelly, and her eyes wandered off into the fitful\nfirelight.\n\n\"I suppose you will forget us all very quickly.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall not. I shall always have the pleasantest memories of\nRivermouth.\"\n\nHere the conversation died a natural death. Nelly sank into a sort of\ndream, and I meditated. Fearing every moment to be interrupted by some\nmember of the family, I nerved myself to make a bold dash.\n\n\"Nelly.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"Do you--\" I hesitated.\n\n\"Do I what?\"\n\n\"Love anyone very much?\"\n\n\"Why, of course I do,\" said Nelly, scattering her revery with a merry\nlaugh. \"I love Uncle Nutter, and Aunt Nutter, and you--and Towser.\"\n\nTowser, our new dog! I couldn't stand that. I pushed back the stool\nimpatiently and stood in front of her.\n\n\"That's not what I mean,\" I said angrily.\n\n\"Well, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Do you love anyone to marry him?\"\n\n\"The idea of it,\" cried Nelly, laughing.\n\n\"But you must tell me.\"\n\n\"Must, Tom?\"\n\n\"Indeed you must, Nelly.\"\n\nShe had risen from the chair with an amused, perplexed look in her eyes.\nI held her an instant by the dress.\n\n\"Please tell me.\"\n\n\"O you silly boy!\" cried Nelly. Then she rumpled my hair all over my\nforehead and ran laughing out of the room.\n\nSuppose Cinderella had rumpled the prince's hair all over his forehead,\nhow would he have liked it? Suppose the Sleeping Beauty, when the king's\nson with a kiss set her and all the old clocks agoing in the spell-bound\ncastle--suppose the young minx had looked up and coolly laughed in his\neye, I guess the king's son wouldn't have been greatly pleased.\n\nI hesitated a second or two and then rushed after Nelly just in time to\nrun against Miss Abigail, who entered the room with a couple of lighted\ncandles.\n\n\"Goodness gracious, Tom!\" exclaimed Miss Abigail. \"Are you possessed?\"\n\nI left her scraping the warm spermaceti from one of her thumbs.\n\nNelly was in the kitchen talking quite unconcernedly with Kitty Collins.\nThere she remained until supper-time. Supper over, we all adjourned to\nthe sitting-room. I planned and plotted, but could manage in no way to\nget Nelly alone. She and the Captain played cribbage all the evening.\n\nThe next morning my lady did not make her appearance until we were\nseated at the breakfast-table. I had got up at daylight myself.\nImmediately after breakfast the carriage arrived to take her to the\nrailway station. A gentleman stepped from this carriage, and greatly to\nmy surprise was warmly welcomed by the Captain and Miss Abigail, and by\nMiss Nelly herself, who seemed unnecessarily glad to see him. From the\nhasty conversation that followed I learned that the gentleman had come\nsomewhat unexpectedly to conduct Miss Nelly to Boston. But how did he\nknow that she was to leave that morning? Nelly bade farewell to the\nCaptain and Miss Abigail, made a little rush and kissed me on the nose,\nand was gone.\n\nAs the wheels of the hack rolled up the street and over my finer\nfeelings, I turned to the Captain.\n\n\"Who was that gentleman, sir?\"\n\n\"That was Mr. Waldron.\"\n\n\"A relation of yours, sir?\" I asked craftily.\n\n\"No relation of mine--a relation of Nelly's,\" said the Captain, smiling.\n\n\"A cousin,\" I suggested, feeling a strange hatred spring up in my bosom\nfor the unknown.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you might call him a cousin for the present. He's going\nto marry little Nelly next summer.\"\n\nIn one of Peter Parley's valuable historical works is a description of\nan earthquake at Lisbon. \"At the first shock the inhabitants rushed into\nthe streets; the earth yawned at their feet and the houses tottered and\nfell on every side.\" I staggered past the Captain into the street; a\ngiddiness came over me; the earth yawned at my feet, and the houses\nthreatened to fall in on every side of me. How distinctly I remember\nthat momentary sense of confusion when everything in the world seemed\ntoppling over into ruins.\n\nAs I have remarked, my love for Nelly is a thing of the past. I had not\nthought of her for years until I sat down to write this chapter, and\nyet, now that all is said and done, I shouldn't care particularly to\ncome across Mrs. Waldron's eldest boy in my afternoon's walk. He must be\nfourteen or fifteen years old by this time--the young villain!\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nineteen--I Become A Blighted Being\n\n\nWhen a young boy gets to be an old boy, when the hair is growing\nrather thin on the top of the old boy's head, and he has been tamed\nsufficiently to take a sort of chastened pleasure in allowing the baby\nto play with his watch-seals--when, I say, an old boy has reached this\nstage in the journey of life, he is sometimes apt to indulge in sportive\nremarks concerning his first love.\n\nNow, though I bless my stars that it wasn't in my power to marry Miss\nNelly, I am not going to deny my boyish regard for her nor laugh at\nit. As long as it lasted it was a very sincere and unselfish love, and\nrendered me proportionately wretched. I say as long as it lasted, for\none's first love doesn't last forever.\n\nI am ready, however, to laugh at the amusing figure I cut after I had\nreally ceased to have any deep feeling in the matter. It was then I took\nit into my head to be a Blighted Being. This was about two weeks after\nthe spectral appearance of Mr. Waldron.\n\nFor a boy of a naturally vivacious disposition the part of a blighted\nbeing presented difficulties. I had an excellent appetite, I liked\nsociety, I liked out-of-door sports, I was fond of handsome clothes. Now\nall these things were incompatible with the doleful character I was to\nassume, and I proceeded to cast them from me. I neglected my hair. I\navoided my playmates. I frowned abstractedly. I didn't eat as much as\nwas good for me. I took lonely walks. I brooded in solitude. I not only\ncommitted to memory the more turgid poems of the late Lord Byron--\"Fare\nthee well, and if forever,\" &c.--but I became a despondent poet on my own\naccount, and composed a string of \"Stanzas to One who will understand\nthem.\" I think I was a trifle too hopeful on that point; for I came\nacross the verses several years afterwards, and was quite unable to\nunderstand them myself.\n\nIt was a great comfort to be so perfectly miserable and yet not suffer\nany. I used to look in the glass and gloat over the amount and variety\nof mournful expression I could throw into my features. If I caught\nmyself smiling at anything, I cut the smile short with a sigh. The\noddest thing about all this is, I never once suspected that I was not\nunhappy. No one, not even Pepper Whitcomb, was more deceived than I.\n\nAmong the minor pleasures of being blighted were the interest and\nperplexity I excited in the simple souls that were thrown in daily\ncontact with me. Pepper especially. I nearly drove him into a\ncorresponding state of mind.\n\nI had from time to time given Pepper slight but impressive hints of my\nadmiration for Some One (this was in the early part of Miss Glentworth's\nvisit); I had also led him to infer that my admiration was not\naltogether in vain. He was therefore unable to explain the cause of\nmy strange behavior, for I had carefully refrained from mentioning to\nPepper the fact that Some One had turned out to be Another's.\n\nI treated Pepper shabbily. I couldn't resist playing on his tenderer\nfeelings. He was a boy bubbling over with sympathy for anyone in any\nkind of trouble. Our intimacy since Binny Wallace's death had been\nuninterrupted; but now I moved in a sphere apart, not to be profaned by\nthe step of an outsider.\n\nI no longer joined the boys on the playground at recess. I stayed at my\ndesk reading some lugubrious volume--usually The Mysteries of Udolpho, by\nthe amiable Mrs. Radcliffe. A translation of The Sorrows of Werter fell\ninto my hands at this period, and if I could have committed suicide\nwithout killing myself, I should certainly have done so.\n\nOn half-holidays, instead of fraternizing with Pepper and the rest of\nour clique, I would wander off alone to Grave Point.\n\nGrave Point--the place where Binny Wallace's body came ashore--was a\nnarrow strip of land running out into the river. A line of Lombardy\npoplars, stiff and severe, like a row of grenadiers, mounted guard on\nthe water-side. On the extreme end of the peninsula was an old disused\ngraveyard, tenanted principally by the early settlers who had been\nscalped by the Indians. In a remote corner of the cemetery, set apart\nfrom the other mounds, was the grave of a woman who had been hanged\nin the old colonial times for the murder of her infant. Goodwife Polly\nHaines had denied the crime to the last, and after her death there had\narisen strong doubts as to her actual guilt. It was a belief current\namong the lads of the town, that if you went to this grave at nightfall\non the 10th of November--the anniversary of her execution--and asked, \"For\nwhat did the magistrates hang you?\" a voice would reply, \"Nothing.\"\n\nMany a Rivermouth boy has tremblingly put this question in the dark,\nand, sure enough, Polly Haines invariably answered nothing!\n\nA low red-brick wall, broken down in many places and frosted over with\nsilvery moss, surrounded this burial-ground of our Pilgrim Fathers and\ntheir immediate descendants. The latest date on any of the headstones\nwas 1780. A crop of very funny epitaphs sprung up here and there among\nthe overgrown thistles and burdocks, and almost every tablet had a\ndeath's-head with cross-bones engraved upon it, or else a puffy round\nface with a pair of wings stretching out from the ears, like this:\n\n\n\nCherub Graphic\n\n\n\nThese mortuary emblems furnished me with congenial food for reflection.\nI used to lie in the long grass, and speculate on the advantages and\ndisadvantages of being a cherub.\n\nI forget what I thought the advantages were, but I remember distinctly\nof getting into an inextricable tangle on two points: How could a\ncherub, being all head and wings, manage to sit down when he was tired?\nTo have to sit down on the back of his head struck me as an awkward\nalternative. Again: Where did a cherub carry those indispensable\narticles (such as jack-knives, marbles, and pieces of twine) which\nboys in an earthly state of existence usually stow away in their\ntrousers-pockets?\n\nThese were knotty questions, and I was never able to dispose of them\nsatisfactorily.\n\nMeanwhile Pepper Whitcomb would scour the whole town in search of me.\nHe finally discovered my retreat, and dropped in on me abruptly one\nafternoon, while I was deep in the cherub problem.\n\n\"Look here, Tom Bailey!\" said Pepper, shying a piece of clam-shell\nindignantly at the file jacet on a neighboring gravestone. \"You are just\ngoing to the dogs! Can't you tell a fellow what in thunder ails you,\ninstead of prowling round among the tombs like a jolly old vampire?\"\n\n\"Pepper,\" I replied, solemnly, \"don't ask me. All is not well\nhere\"--touching my breast mysteriously. If I had touched my head instead,\nI should have been nearer the mark.\n\nPepper stared at me.\n\n\"Earthly happiness,\" I continued, \"is a delusion and a snare. You will\nnever be happy, Pepper, until you are a cherub.\"\n\nPepper, by the by, would have made an excellent cherub, he was so\nchubby. Having delivered myself of these gloomy remarks, I arose\nlanguidly from the grass and moved away, leaving Pepper staring after\nme in mute astonishment. I was Hamlet and Werter and the late Lord Byron\nall in one.\n\nYou will ask what my purpose was in cultivating this factitious\ndespondency. None whatever. Blighted beings never have any purpose in\nlife excepting to be as blighted as possible.\n\nOf course my present line of business could not long escape the eye of\nCaptain Nutter. I don't know if the Captain suspected my attachment for\nMiss Glentworth. He never alluded to it; but he watched me. Miss Abigail\nwatched me, Kitty Collins watched me, and Sailor Ben watched me.\n\n\"I can't make out his signals,\" I overheard the Admiral remark to my\ngrandfather one day. \"I hope he ain't got no kind of sickness aboard.\"\n\nThere was something singularly agreeable in being an object of so great\ninterest. Sometimes I had all I could do to preserve my dejected aspect,\nit was so pleasant to be miserable. I incline to the opinion that\npeople who are melancholy without any particular reason, such as poets,\nartists, and young musicians with long hair, have rather an enviable\ntime of it. In a quiet way I never enjoyed myself better in my life than\nwhen I was a Blighted Being.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty--I Prove Myself To Be the Grandson of My Grandfather\n\n\nIt was not possible for a boy of my temperament to be a blighted being\nlonger than three consecutive weeks.\n\nI was gradually emerging from my self-imposed cloud when events took\nplace that greatly assisted in restoring me to a more natural frame of\nmind. I awoke from an imaginary trouble to face a real one.\n\nI suppose you don't know what a financial crisis is? I will give you an\nillustration.\n\nYou are deeply in debt--say to the amount of a quarter of a dollar--to the\nlittle knicknack shop round the corner, where they sell picture-papers,\nspruce-gum, needles, and Malaga raisins. A boy owes you a quarter of a\ndollar, which he promises to pay at a certain time. You are depending\non this quarter to settle accounts with the small shop-keeper. The\ntime arrives--and the quarter doesn't. That's a financial crisis, in one\nsense--twenty-five senses, if I may say so.\n\nWhen this same thing happens, on a grander scale, in the mercantile\nworld, it produces what is called a panic. One man's inability to pay\nhis debts ruins another man, who, in turn, ruins someone else, and\nso on, until failure after failure makes even the richest capitalists\ntremble. Public confidence is suspended, and the smaller fry of\nmerchants are knocked over like tenpins.\n\nThese commercial panics occur periodically, after the fashion of comets\nand earthquakes and other disagreeable things.\n\nSuch a panic took place in New Orleans in the year 18--, and my father's\nbanking-house went to pieces in the crash.\n\nOf a comparatively large fortune nothing remained after paying his debts\nexcepting a few thousand dollars, with which he proposed to return North\nand embark in some less hazardous enterprise. In the meantime it was\nnecessary for him to stay in New Orleans to wind up the business.\n\nMy grandfather was in some way involved in this failure, and lost, I\nfancy, a considerable sum of money; but he never talked much on the\nsubject. He was an unflinching believer in the spilt-milk proverb.\n\n\"It can't be gathered up,\" he would say, \"and it's no use crying over\nit. Pitch into the cow and get some more milk, is my motto.\"\n\nThe suspension of the banking-house was bad enough, but there was an\nattending circumstance that gave us, at Rivermouth, a great deal more\nanxiety. The cholera, which someone predicted would visit the country\nthat year, and which, indeed, had made its appearance in a mild form\nat several points along the Mississippi River, had broken out with much\nviolence at New Orleans.\n\nThe report that first reached us through the newspapers was meagre and\ncontradictory; many people discredited it; but a letter from my mother\nleft us no room for doubt. The sickness was in the city. The hospitals\nwere filling up, and hundreds of the citizens were flying from the\nstricken place by every steamboat. The unsettled state of my father's\naffairs made it imperative for him to remain at his post; his desertion\nat that moment would have been at the sacrifice of all he had saved from\nthe general wreck.\n\nAs he would be detained in New Orleans at least three months, my mother\ndeclined to come North without him.\n\nAfter this we awaited with feverish impatience the weekly news that came\nto us from the South. The next letter advised us that my parents were\nwell, and that the sickness, so far, had not penetrated to the faubourg,\nor district, where they lived. The following week brought less cheering\ntidings. My father's business, in consequence of the flight of the other\npartners, would keep him in the city beyond the period he had mentioned.\nThe family had moved to Pass Christian, a favorite watering-place on\nLake Pontchartrain, near New Orleans, where he was able to spend part of\neach week. So the return North was postponed indefinitely.\n\nIt was now that the old longing to see my parents came back to me with\nirresistible force. I knew my grandfather would not listen to the\nidea of my going to New Orleans at such a dangerous time, since he had\nopposed the journey so strongly when the same objection did not exist.\nBut I determined to go nevertheless.\n\nI think I have mentioned the fact that all the male members of our\nfamily, on my father's side--as far back as the Middle Ages--have\nexhibited in early youth a decided talent for running away. It was an\nhereditary talent. It ran in the blood to run away. I do not pretend to\nexplain the peculiarity. I simply admit it.\n\nIt was not my fate to change the prescribed order of things. I, too, was\nto run away, thereby proving, if any proof were needed, that I was the\ngrandson of my grandfather. I do not hold myself responsible for the\nstep any more than I do for the shape of my nose, which is said to be a\nfacsimile of Captain Nutter's.\n\nI have frequently noticed how circumstances conspire to help a man, or\na boy, when he has thoroughly resolved on doing a thing. That very week\nthe Rivermouth Barnacle printed an advertisement that seemed to have\nbeen written on purpose for me. It read as follows:\n\nWANTED. A Few Able-bodied Seamen and a Cabin-Boy, for the ship Rawlings,\nnow loading for New Orleans at Johnson's Wharf, Boston. Apply in person,\nwithin four days, at the office of Messrs.--& Co., or on board the Ship.\n\nHow I was to get to New Orleans with only $4.62 was a question that had\nbeen bothering me. This advertisement made it as clear as day. I would\ngo as cabin-boy.\n\nI had taken Pepper into my confidence again; I had told him the story\nof my love for Miss Glentworth, with all its harrowing details; and now\nconceived it judicious to confide in him the change about to take place\nin my life, so that, if the Rawlings went down in a gale, my friends\nmight have the limited satisfaction of knowing what had become of me.\n\nPepper shook his head discouragingly, and sought in every way to\ndissuade me from the step. He drew a disenchanting picture of the\nexistence of a cabin-boy, whose constant duty (according to Pepper) was\nto have dishes broken over his head whenever the captain or the mate\nchanced to be out of humor, which was mostly all the time. But nothing\nPepper said could turn me a hair's-breadth from my purpose.\n\nI had little time to spare, for the advertisement stated explicitly that\napplications were to be made in person within four days. I trembled\nto think of the bare possibility of some other boy snapping up that\ndesirable situation.\n\nIt was on Monday that I stumbled upon the advertisement. On Tuesday my\npreparations were completed. My baggage--consisting of four shirts, half\na dozen collars, a piece of shoemaker's wax, (Heaven knows what for!)\nand seven stockings, wrapped in a silk handkerchief--lay hidden under a\nloose plank of the stable floor. This was my point of departure.\n\nMy plan was to take the last train for Boston, in order to prevent the\npossibility of immediate pursuit, if any should be attempted. The train\nleft at 4 P.M.\n\nI ate no breakfast and little dinner that day. I avoided the Captain's\neye, and wouldn't have looked Miss Abigail or Kitty in the face for the\nwealth of the Indies.\n\nWhen it was time to start for the station I retired quietly to the\nstable and uncovered my bundle. I lingered a moment to kiss the white\nstar on Gypsy's forehead, and was nearly unmanned when the little animal\nreturned the caress by lapping my cheek. Twice I went back and patted\nher.\n\nOn reaching the station I purchased my ticket with a bravado air that\nought to have aroused the suspicion of the ticket-master, and hurried to\nthe car, where I sat fidgeting until the train shot out into the broad\ndaylight.\n\nThen I drew a long breath and looked about me. The first object that\nsaluted my sight was Sailor Ben, four or five seats behind me, reading\nthe Rivermouth Barnacle!\n\nReading was not an easy art to Sailor Ben; he grappled with the sense of\na paragraph as if it were a polar-bear, and generally got the worst of\nit. On the present occasion he was having a hard struggle, judging by\nthe way he worked his mouth and rolled his eyes. He had evidently not\nseen me. But what was he doing on the Boston train?\n\nWithout lingering to solve the question, I stole gently from my seat and\npassed into the forward car.\n\nThis was very awkward, having the Admiral on board. I couldn't\nunderstand it at all. Could it be possible that the old boy had got\ntired of land and was running away to sea himself? That was too absurd.\nI glanced nervously towards the car door now and then, half expecting to\nsee him come after me.\n\nWe had passed one or two way-stations, and I had quieted down a good\ndeal, when I began to feel as if somebody was looking steadily at the\nback of my head. I turned round involuntarily, and there was Sailor\nBen again, at the farther end of the car, wrestling with the Rivermouth\nBarnacle as before.\n\nI began to grow very uncomfortable indeed. Was it by design or chance\nthat he thus dogged my steps? If he was aware of my presence, why didn't\nhe speak to me at once? 'Why did he steal round, making no sign, like a\nparticularly unpleasant phantom? Maybe it wasn't Sailor Ben. I peeped at\nhim slyly. There was no mistaking that tanned, genial phiz of his. Very\nodd he didn't see me!\n\nLiterature, even in the mild form of a country newspaper, always had the\neffect of poppies on the Admiral. 'When I stole another glance in his\ndirection his hat was tilted over his right eye in the most dissolute\nstyle, and the Rivermouth Barnacle lay in a confused heap beside him. He\nhad succumbed. He was fast asleep. If he would only keep asleep until we\nreached our destination!\n\nBy and by I discovered that the rear car had been detached from the\ntrain at the last stopping-place. This accounted satisfactorily for\nSailor Ben's singular movements, and considerably calmed my fears.\nNevertheless, I did not like the aspect of things.\n\nThe Admiral continued to snooze like a good fellow, and was snoring\nmelodiously as we glided at a slackened pace over a bridge and into\nBoston.\n\nI grasped my pilgrim's bundle, and, hurrying out of the car, dashed up\nthe first street that presented itself.\n\nIt was a narrow, noisy, zigzag street, crowded with trucks and\nobstructed with bales and boxes of merchandise. I didn't pause to\nbreathe until I had placed a respectable distance between me and the\nrailway station. By this time it was nearly twilight.\n\nI had got into the region of dwelling-houses, and was about to seat\nmyself on a doorstep to rest, when, lo! there was the Admiral trundling\nalong on the opposite sidewalk, under a full spread of canvas, as he\nwould have expressed it.\n\nI was off again in an instant at a rapid pace; but in spite of all I\ncould do he held his own without any perceptible exertion. He had a very\nugly gait to get away from, the Admiral. I didn't dare to run, for\nfear of being mistaken for a thief, a suspicion which my bundle would\nnaturally lend color to.\n\nI pushed ahead, however, at a brisk trot, and must have got over one or\ntwo miles--my pursuer neither gaining nor losing ground--when I concluded\nto surrender at discretion. I saw that Sailor Ben was determined to have\nme, and, knowing my man, I knew that escape was highly improbable.\n\nSo I turned round and waited for him to catch up with me, which he did\nin a few seconds, looking rather sheepish at first.\n\n\"Sailor Ben,\" said I, severely, \"do I understand that you are dogging my\nsteps?\"\n\n\"'Well, little mess-mate,\" replied the Admiral, rubbing his nose, which\nhe always did when he was disconcerted, \"I am kind o' followin' in your\nwake.\"\n\n\"Under orders?\"\n\n\"Under orders.\"\n\n\"Under the Captain's orders?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"In other words, my grandfather has sent you to fetch me back to\nRivermouth?\"\n\n\"That's about it,\" said the Admiral, with a burst of frankness.\n\n\"And I must go with you whether I want to or not?\"\n\n\"The Capen's very identical words!\"\n\nThere was nothing to be done. I bit my lips with suppressed anger, and\nsignified that I was at his disposal, since I couldn't help it. The\nimpression was very strong in my mind that the Admiral wouldn't hesitate\nto put me in irons if I showed signs of mutiny.\n\nIt was too late to return to Rivermouth that night--a fact which I\ncommunicated to the old boy sullenly, inquiring at the same time what he\nproposed to do about it.\n\nHe said we would cruise about for some rations, and then make a night\nof it. I didn't condescend to reply, though I hailed the suggestion of\nsomething to eat with inward enthusiasm, for I had not taken enough food\nthat day to keep life in a canary.\n\n'We wandered back to the railway station, in the waiting room of which\nwas a kind of restaurant presided over by a severe-looking young lady.\nHere we had a cup of coffee apiece, several tough doughnuts, and some\nblocks of venerable spongecake. The young lady who attended on us,\nwhatever her age was then, must have been a mere child when that\nsponge-cake was made.\n\nThe Admiral's acquaintance with Boston hotels was slight; but he knew\nof a quiet lodging-house near by, much patronized by sea-captains, and\nkept by a former friend of his.\n\nIn this house, which had seen its best days, we were accommodated with\na mouldy chamber containing two cot-beds, two chairs, and a cracked\npitcher on a washstand. The mantel-shelf was ornamented with three big\npink conch-shells, resembling pieces of petrified liver; and over these\nhung a cheap lurid print, in which a United States sloop-of-war was\ngiving a British frigate particular fits. It is very strange how our own\nships never seem to suffer any in these terrible engagements. It shows\nwhat a nation we are.\n\nAn oil-lamp on a deal-table cast a dismal glare over the apartment,\nwhich was cheerless in the extreme. I thought of our sitting-room at\nhome, with its flowery wall-paper and gay curtains and soft lounges; I\nsaw Major Elkanah Nutter (my grandfather's father) in powdered wig and\nFederal uniform, looking down benevolently from his gilt frame between\nthe bookcases; I pictured the Captain and Miss Abigail sitting at the\ncosey round table in the moon-like glow of the astral lamp; and then I\nfell to wondering how they would receive me when I came back. I wondered\nif the Prodigal Son had any idea that his father was going to kill the\nfatted calf for him, and how he felt about it, on the whole.\n\nThough I was very low in spirits, I put on a bold front to Sailor\nBen, you will understand. To be caught and caged in this manner was a\nfrightful shock to my vanity. He tried to draw me into conversation;\nbut I answered in icy monosyllables. He again suggested we should make\na night of it, and hinted broadly that he was game for any amount of\nriotous dissipation, even to the extent of going to see a play if I\nwanted to. I declined haughtily. I was dying to go.\n\nHe then threw out a feeler on the subject of dominos and checkers, and\nobserved in a general way that \"seven up\" was a capital game; but I\nrepulsed him at every point.\n\nI saw that the Admiral was beginning to feel hurt by my systematic\ncoldness. 'We had always been such hearty friends until now. It was\ntoo bad of me to fret that tender, honest old heart even for an hour.\nI really did love the ancient boy, and when, in a disconsolate way, he\nordered up a pitcher of beer, I unbent so far as to partake of some in a\nteacup. He recovered his spirits instantly, and took out his cuddy clay\npipe for a smoke.\n\nBetween the beer and the soothing fragrance of the navy-plug, I fell\ninto a pleasanter mood myself, and, it being too late now to go to the\ntheatre, I condescended to say--addressing the northwest corner of the\nceiling--that \"seven up\" was a capital game. Upon this hint the Admiral\ndisappeared, and returned shortly with a very dirty pack of cards.\n\nAs we played, with varying fortunes, by the flickering flame of the\nlamp, he sipped his beer and became communicative. He seemed immensely\ntickled by the fact that I had come to Boston. It leaked out presently\nthat he and the Captain had had a wager on the subject.\n\nThe discovery of my plans and who had discovered them were points on\nwhich the Admiral refused to throw any light. They had been discovered,\nhowever, and the Captain had laughed at the idea of my running away.\nSailor Ben, on the contrary, had stoutly contended that I meant to slip\ncable and be off. Whereupon the Captain offered to bet him a dollar that\nI wouldn't go. And it was partly on account of this wager that Sailor\nBen refrained from capturing me when he might have done so at the start.\n\nNow, as the fare to and from Boston, with the lodging expenses, would\ncost him at least five dollars, I didn't see what he gained by winning\nthe wager. The Admiral rubbed his nose violently when this view of the\ncase presented itself.\n\nI asked him why he didn't take me from the train at the first\nstopping-place and return to Rivermouth by the down train at 4.30. He\nexplained having purchased a ticket for Boston, he considered himself\nbound to the owners (the stockholders of the road) to fulfil his part of\nthe contract! To use his own words, he had \"shipped for the viage.\"\n\nThis struck me as being so deliciously funny, that after I was in bed\nand the light was out, I couldn't help laughing aloud once or twice. I\nsuppose the Admiral must have thought I was meditating another escape,\nfor he made periodical visits to my bed throughout the night, satisfying\nhimself by kneading me all over that I hadn't evaporated.\n\nI was all there the next morning, when Sailor Ben half awakened me by\nshouting merrily, \"All hands on deck!\" The words rang in my ears like a\npart of my own dream, for I was at that instant climbing up the side of\nthe Rawlings to offer myself as cabin-boy.\n\nThe Admiral was obliged to shake me roughly two or three times before he\ncould detach me from the dream. I opened my eyes with effort, and stared\nstupidly round the room. Bit by bit my real situation dawned on me.\n'What a sickening sensation that is, when one is in trouble, to wake up\nfeeling free for a moment, and then to find yesterday's sorrow all ready\nto go on again!\n\n\"'Well, little messmate, how fares it?\"\n\nI was too much depressed to reply. The thought of returning to\nRivermouth chilled me. How could I face Captain Nutter, to say nothing\nof Miss Abigail and Kitty? How the Temple Grammar School boys would look\nat me! How Conway and Seth Rodgers would exult over my mortification!\nAnd what if the Rev. Wibird Hawkins should allude to me in his next\nSunday's sermon?\n\nSailor Ben was wise in keeping an eye on me, for after these thoughts\ntook possession of my mind, I wanted only the opportunity to give him\nthe slip.\n\nThe keeper of the lodgings did not supply meals to his guests; so we\nbreakfasted at a small chophouse in a crooked street on our way to the\ncars. The city was not astir yet, and looked glum and careworn in the\ndamp morning atmosphere.\n\nHere and there as we passed along was a sharp-faced shop-boy taking down\nshutters; and now and then we met a seedy man who had evidently spent\nthe night in a doorway. Such early birds and a few laborers with their\ntin kettles were the only signs of life to be seen until we came to the\nstation, where I insisted on paying for my own ticket. I didn't relish\nbeing conveyed from place to place, like a felon changing prisons, at\nsomebody else's expense.\n\nOn entering the car I sunk into a seat next the window, and Sailor Ben\ndeposited himself beside me, cutting off all chance of escape.\n\nThe car filled up soon after this, and I wondered if there was anything\nin my mien that would lead the other passengers to suspect I was a boy\nwho had run away and was being brought back.\n\nA man in front of us--he was near-sighted, as I discovered later by his\nreading a guide-book with his nose--brought the blood to my cheeks by\nturning round and peering at me steadily. I rubbed a clear spot on the\ncloudy window-glass at my elbow, and looked out to avoid him.\n\nThere, in the travellers' room, was the severe-looking young lady piling\nup her blocks of sponge-cake in alluring pyramids and industriously\nintrenching herself behind a breastwork of squash-pie. I saw with\ncynical pleasure numerous victims walk up to the counter and recklessly\nsow the seeds of death in their constitutions by eating her doughnuts. I\nhad got quite interested in her, when the whistle sounded and the train\nbegan to move.\n\nThe Admiral and I did not talk much on the journey. I stared out of the\nwindow most of the time, speculating as to the probable nature of the\nreception in store for me at the terminus of the road.\n\n'What would the Captain say? and Mr. Grimshaw, what would he do about\nit? Then I thought of Pepper Whitcomb. Dire was the vengeance I meant to\nwreak on Pepper, for who but he had betrayed me? Pepper alone had been\nthe repository of my secret--perfidious Pepper!\n\nAs we left station after station behind us, I felt less and less like\nencountering the members of our family. Sailor Ben fathomed what was\npassing in my mind, for he leaned over and said:\n\n\"I don't think as the Capen will bear down very hard on you.\"\n\nBut it wasn't that. It wasn't the fear of any physical punishment that\nmight be inflicted; it was a sense of my own folly that was creeping\nover me; for during the long, silent ride I had examined my conduct from\nevery stand-point, and there was no view I could take of myself in which\nI did not look like a very foolish person indeed.\n\nAs we came within sight of the spires of Rivermouth, I wouldn't have\ncared if the up train, which met us outside the town, had run into us\nand ended me.\n\nContrary to my expectation and dread, the Captain was not visible when\nwe stepped from the cars. Sailor Ben glanced among the crowd of faces,\napparently looking for him too. Conway was there--he was always hanging\nabout the station--and if he had intimated in any way that he knew of my\ndisgrace and enjoyed it, I should have walked into him, I am certain.\n\nBut this defiant feeling entirely deserted me by the time we reached the\nNutter House. The Captain himself opened the door.\n\n\"Come on board, sir,\" said Sailor Ben, scraping his left foot and\ntouching his hat sea-fashion.\n\nMy grandfather nodded to Sailor Ben, somewhat coldly I thought, and much\nto my astonishment kindly took me by the hand.\n\nI was unprepared for this, and the tears, which no amount of severity\nwould have wrung from me, welled up to my eyes.\n\nThe expression of my grandfather's face, as I glanced at it hastily,\nwas grave and gentle; there was nothing in it of anger or reproof. I\nfollowed him into the sitting-room, and, obeying a motion of his hand,\nseated myself on the sofa. He remained standing by the round table for a\nmoment, lost in thought, then leaned over and picked up a letter.\n\nIt was a letter with a great black seal.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-One--In Which I Leave Rivermouth\n\n\nA letter with a great black seal!\n\nI knew then what had happened as well as I know it now. But which\nwas it, father or mother? I do not like to look back to the agony and\nsuspense of that moment.\n\nMy father had died at New Orleans during one of his weekly visits to\nthe city. The letter bearing these tidings had reached Rivermouth the\nevening of my flight--had passed me on the road by the down train.\n\nI must turn back for a moment to that eventful evening. When I failed\nto make my appearance at supper, the Captain began to suspect that I had\nreally started on my wild tour southward--a conjecture which Sailor Ben's\nabsence helped to confirm. I had evidently got off by the train and\nSailor Ben had followed me.\n\nThere was no telegraphic communication between Boston and Rivermouth\nin those days; so my grandfather could do nothing but await the result.\nEven if there had been another mail to Boston, he could not have availed\nhimself of it, not knowing how to address a message to the fugitives.\nThe post-office was naturally the last place either I or the Admiral\nwould think of visiting.\n\nMy grandfather, however, was too full of trouble to allow this to add to\nhis distress. He knew that the faithful old sailor would not let me come\nto any harm, and even if I had managed for the time being to elude him,\nwas sure to bring me back sooner or later.\n\nOur return, therefore, by the first train on the following day did not\nsurprise him.\n\nI was greatly puzzled, as I have said, by the gentle manner of his\nreception; but when we were alone together in the sitting-room, and he\nbegan slowly to unfold the letter, I understood it all. I caught a sight\nof my mother's handwriting in the superscription, and there was nothing\nleft to tell me.\n\nMy grandfather held the letter a few seconds irresolutely, and then\ncommenced reading it aloud; but he could get no further than the date.\n\n\"I can't read it, Tom,\" said the old gentleman, breaking down. \"I\nthought I could.\"\n\nHe handed it to me. I took the letter mechanically, and hurried away\nwith it to my little room, where I had passed so many happy hours.\n\nThe week that followed the receipt of this letter is nearly a blank in\nmy memory. I remember that the days appeared endless; that at times\nI could not realize the misfortune that had befallen us, and my heart\nupbraided me for not feeling a deeper grief; that a full sense of my\nloss would now and then sweep over me like an inspiration, and I would\nsteal away to my chamber or wander forlornly about the gardens. I\nremember this, but little more.\n\nAs the days went by my first grief subsided, and in its place grew up\na want which I have experienced at every step in life from boyhood to\nmanhood. Often, even now, after all these years, when I see a lad of\ntwelve or fourteen walking by his father's side, and glancing merrily\nup at his face, I turn and look after them, and am conscious that I have\nmissed companionship most sweet and sacred.\n\nI shall not dwell on this portion of my story. There were many tranquil,\npleasant hours in store for me at that period, and I prefer to turn to\nthem.\n\n\nOne evening the Captain came smiling into the sitting-room with an open\nletter in his hand. My mother had arrived at New York, and would be\nwith us the next day. For the first time in weeks--years, it seemed to\nme--something of the old cheerfulness mingled with our conversation round\nthe evening lamp. I was to go to Boston with the Captain to meet her and\nbring her home. I need not describe that meeting. With my mother's hand\nin mine once more, all the long years we had been parted appeared like a\ndream. Very dear to me was the sight of that slender, pale woman\npassing from room to room, and lending a patient grace and beauty to the\nsaddened life of the old house.\n\nEverything was changed with us now. There were consultations with\nlawyers, and signing of papers, and correspondence; for my father's\naffairs had been left in great confusion. And when these were settled,\nthe evenings were not long enough for us to hear all my mother had to\ntell of the scenes she had passed through in the ill-fated city.\n\nThen there were old times to talk over, full of reminiscences of Aunt\nChloe and little Black Sam. Little Black Sam, by the by, had been taken\nby his master from my father's service ten months previously, and put on\na sugar-plantation near Baton Rouge. Not relishing the change, Sam had\nrun away, and by some mysterious agency got into Canada, from which\nplace he had sent back several indecorous messages to his late owner.\nAunt Chloe was still in New Orleans, employed as nurse in one of the\ncholera hospital wards, and the Desmoulins, near neighbors of ours, had\npurchased the pretty stone house among the orange-trees.\n\nHow all these simple details interested me will be readily understood by\nany boy who has been long absent from home.\n\nI was sorry when it became necessary to discuss questions more nearly\naffecting myself. I had been removed from school temporarily, but it\nwas decided, after much consideration, that I should not return, the\ndecision being left, in a manner, in my own hands.\n\nThe Captain wished to carry out his son's intention and send me to\ncollege, for which I was nearly fitted; but our means did not admit of\nthis. The Captain, too, could ill afford to bear the expense, for his\nlosses by the failure of the New Orleans business had been heavy. Yet he\ninsisted on the plan, not seeing clearly what other disposal to make of\nme.\n\nIn the midst of our discussions a letter came from my Uncle Snow,\na merchant in New York, generously offering me a place in his\ncounting-house. The case resolved itself into this: If I went to\ncollege, I should have to be dependent on Captain Nutter for several\nyears, and at the end of the collegiate course would have no settled\nprofession. If I accepted my uncle's offer, I might hope to work my\nway to independence without loss of time. It was hard to give up the\nlong-cherished dream of being a Harvard boy; but I gave it up.\n\nThe decision once made, it was Uncle Snow's wish that I should enter\nhis counting-house immediately. The cause of my good uncle's haste was\nthis--he was afraid that I would turn out to be a poet before he could\nmake a merchant of me. His fears were based upon the fact that I had\npublished in the Rivermouth Barnacle some verses addressed in a familiar\nmanner \"To the Moon.\" Now, the idea of a boy, with his living to get,\nplacing himself in communication with the Moon, struck the mercantile\nmind as monstrous. It was not only a bad investment, it was lunacy.\n\n'We adopted Uncle Snow's views so far as to accede to his proposition\nforthwith. My mother, I neglected to say, was also to reside in New\nYork.\n\nI shall not draw a picture of Pepper Whitcomb's disgust when the news\nwas imparted to him, nor attempt to paint Sailor Ben's distress at the\nprospect of losing his little messmate.\n\nIn the excitement of preparing for the journey I didn't feel any very\ndeep regret myself. But when the moment came for leaving, and I saw my\nsmall trunk lashed up behind the carriage, then the pleasantness of the\nold life and a vague dread of the new came over me, and a mist filled my\neyes, shutting out the group of schoolfellows, including all the members\nof the Centipede Club, who had come down to the house to see me off.\n\nAs the carriage swept round the corner, I leaned out of the window to\ntake a last look at Sailor Ben's cottage, and there was the Admiral's\nflag flying at half-mast.\n\nSo I left Rivermouth, little dreaming that I was not to see the old\nplace again for many and many a year.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Two--Exeunt Omnes\n\n\nWith the close of my school-days at Rivermouth this modest chronicle\nends.\n\nThe new life upon which I entered, the new friends and foes I\nencountered on the road, and what I did and what I did not, are matters\nthat do not come within the scope of these pages. But before I write\nFinis to the record as it stands, before I leave it--feeling as if I\nwere once more going away from my boyhood--I have a word or two to say\nconcerning a few of the personages who have figured in the story, if you\nwill allow me to call Gypsy a personage.\n\nI am sure that the reader who has followed me thus far will be willing\nto hear what became of her, and Sailor Ben and Miss Abigail and the\nCaptain.\n\nFirst about Gypsy. A month after my departure from Rivermouth the Captain\ninformed me by letter that he had parted with the little mare, according\nto agreement. She had been sold to the ring-master of a travelling\ncircus (I had stipulated on this disposal of her), and was about to set\nout on her travels. She did not disappoint my glowing anticipations, but\nbecame quite a celebrity in her way--by dancing the polka to slow music\non a pine-board ball-room constructed for the purpose.\n\nI chanced once, a long while afterwards, to be in a country town where\nher troupe was giving exhibitions; I even read the gaudily illumined\nshow-bill, setting forth the accomplishments of Zuleika, the famed\nArabian Trick Pony--but I failed to recognize my dear little Mustang\ngirl behind those high-sounding titles, and so, alas, did not attend the\nperformance! I hope all the praises she received and all the spangled\ntrappings she wore did not spoil her; but I am afraid they did, for she\nwas always over much given to the vanities of this world!\n\nMiss Abigail regulated the domestic destinies of my grandfather's\nhousehold until the day of her death, which Dr. Theophilus Tredick\nsolemnly averred was hastened by the inveterate habit she had contracted\nof swallowing unknown quantities of hot-drops whenever she fancied\nherself out of sorts. Eighty-seven empty phials were found in a\nbonnet-box on a shelf in her bedroom closet.\n\nThe old house became very lonely when the family got reduced to Captain\nNutter and Kitty; and when Kitty passed away, my grandfather divided his\ntime between Rivermouth and New York.\n\nSailor Ben did not long survive his little Irish lass, as he always\nfondly called her. At his demise, which took place about six years\nsince, he left his property in trust to the managers of a \"Home for Aged\nMariners.\" In his will, which was a very whimsical document--written by\nhimself, and worded with much shrewdness, too--he warned the Trustees\nthat when he got \"aloft\" he intended to keep his \"weather eye\" on them,\nand should send \"a speritual shot across their bows\" and bring them to,\nif they didn't treat the Aged Mariners handsomely.\n\nHe also expressed a wish to have his body stitched up in a shotted\nhammock and dropped into the harbor; but as he did not strenuously\ninsist on this, and as it was not in accordance with my grandfather's\npreconceived notions of Christian burial, the Admiral was laid to rest\nbeside Kitty, in the Old South Burying Ground, with an anchor that would\nhave delighted him neatly carved on his headstone.\n\nI am sorry the fire has gone out in the old ship's stove in that\nsky-blue cottage at the head of the wharf; I am sorry they have taken\ndown the flag-staff and painted over the funny port-holes; for I loved\nthe old cabin as it was. They might have let it alone!\n\nFor several months after leaving Rivermouth I carried on a voluminous\ncorrespondence with Pepper Whitcomb; but it gradually dwindled down to a\nsingle letter a month, and then to none at all. But while he remained\nat the Temple Grammar School he kept me advised of the current gossip of\nthe town and the doings of the Centipedes.\n\nAs one by one the boys left the academy--Adams, Harris, Marden, Blake,\nand Langdon--to seek their fortunes elsewhere, there was less to interest\nme in the old seaport; and when Pepper himself went to Philadelphia to\nread law, I had no one to give me an inkling of what was going on.\n\nThere wasn't much to go on, to be sure. Great events no longer\nconsidered it worth their while to honor so quiet a place.\n\nOne Fourth of July the Temple Grammar School burnt down--set on fire, it\nwas supposed, by an eccentric squib that was seen to bolt into an upper\nwindow--and Mr. Grimshaw retired from public life, married, \"and lived\nhappily ever after,\" as the story-books say.\n\nThe Widow Conway, I am able to state, did not succeed in enslaving Mr.\nMeeks, the apothecary, who united himself clandestinely to one of Miss\nDorothy Gibbs's young ladies, and lost the patronage of Primrose Hall in\nconsequence.\n\nYoung Conway went into the grocery business with his ancient chum,\nRodgers--RODGERS & CONWAY! I read the sign only last summer when I was\ndown in Rivermouth, and had half a mind to pop into the shop and shake\nhands with him, and ask him if he wanted to fight. I contented myself,\nhowever, with flattening my nose against his dingy shop-window, and\nbeheld Conway, in red whiskers and blue overalls, weighing out sugar for\na customer--giving him short weight, I'll bet anything!\n\nI have reserved my pleasantest word for the last. It is touching the\nCaptain. The Captain is still hale and rosy, and if he doesn't relate\nhis exploit in the War of 1812 as spiritedly as he used to, he makes up\nby relating it more frequently and telling it differently every time!\nHe passes his winters in New York and his summers in the Nutter House,\nwhich threatens to prove a hard nut for the destructive gentleman with\nthe scythe and the hour-glass, for the seaward gable has not yielded a\nclapboard to the eastwind these twenty years. The Captain has now become\nthe Oldest Inhabitant in Rivermouth, and so I don't laugh at the Oldest\nInhabitant any more, but pray in my heart that he may occupy the post of\nhonor for half a century to come!\n\nSo ends the Story of a Bad Boy--but not such a very bad boy, as I told\nyou to begin with.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Story of a Bad Boy, by Thomas Bailey Aldrich\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF A BAD BOY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1948.txt or 1948.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/9\/4\/1948\/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1444,"split":"test"}
