He also sees that Mrs. Brissenden (nicknamed \"Mrs. Briss\") is much younger-looking than her husband, though she's actually ten years older. The narrator begins to theorize that Long and Mrs. Briss are getting their vitality, vampire-like, from the \"sacred fount\" of their sexual partners' energy. At first, the narrator theorizes that the source of Long's newfound assurance and intelligence is a certain Lady John.\nLater he changes his mind, as he constantly discusses his ideas with others at the party, particularly an artist, Ford Obert. The narrator notices that another woman at the party, May Server, seems listless, and he starts to wonder if she may be the lover providing vitality to Long. Eventually, the narrator begins to construct enormously elaborate theories of who is taking vitality from whom, and whether some people are acting as screens for the real lovers. In a long midnight confrontation with Mrs. Briss which concludes the novel, she says the narrator's theories are ridiculous, and he has completely misread the actual relationships of their fellow guests. She finishes by telling him he's crazy, and that last word leaves the narrator dismayed and overwhelmed.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sacred Fount, by Henry James\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Such premonitions, it was true, bred fears when they\nfailed to breed hopes, though it was to be added that there were\nsometimes, in the case, rather happy ambiguities. One was glowered at,\nin the compartment, by people who on the morrow, after breakfast, were\nto prove charming; one was spoken to first by people whose sociability\nwas subsequently to show as bleak; and one built with confidence on\nothers who were never to reappear at all--who were only going to\nBirmingham. As soon as I saw Gilbert Long, some way up the platform,\nhowever, I knew him as an element. It was not so much that the wish was\nfather to the thought as that I remembered having already more than once\nmet him at Newmarch. He was a friend of the house--he wouldn't be going\nto Birmingham. I so little expected him, at the same time, to recognise\nme that I stopped short of the carriage near which he stood--I looked\nfor a seat that wouldn't make us neighbours.\n\nI had met him at Newmarch only--a place of a charm so special as to\ncreate rather a bond among its guests; but he had always, in the\ninterval, so failed to know me that I could only hold him as stupid\nunless I held him as impertinent. He was stupid in fact, and in that\ncharacter had no business at Newmarch; but he had also, no doubt, his\nsystem, which he applied without discernment. I wondered, while I saw my\nthings put into my corner, what Newmarch could see in him--for it always\nhad to see something before it made a sign. His good looks, which were\nstriking, perhaps paid his way--his six feet and more of stature, his\nlow-growing, tight-curling hair, his big, bare, blooming face. He was a\nfine piece of human furniture--he made a small party seem more numerous.\nThis, at least, was the impression of him that had revived before I\nstepped out again to the platform, and it armed me only at first with\nsurprise when I saw him come down to me as if for a greeting. If he had\ndecided at last to treat me as an acquaintance made, it was none the\nless a case for letting him come all the way. That, accordingly, was\nwhat he did, and with so clear a conscience, I hasten to add, that at\nthe end of a minute we were talking together quite as with the tradition\nof prompt intimacy. He was good-looking enough, I now again saw, but not\nsuch a model of it as I had seemed to remember; on the other hand his\nmanners had distinctly gained in ease. He referred to our previous\nencounters and common contacts--he was glad I was going; he peeped into\nmy compartment and thought it better than his own. He called a porter,\nthe next minute, to shift his things, and while his attention was so\ntaken I made out some of the rest of the contingent, who were finding or\nhad already found places.\n\nThis lasted till Long came back with his porter, as well as with a lady\nunknown to me and to whom he had apparently mentioned that our carriage\nwould pleasantly accommodate her. The porter carried in fact her\ndressing-bag, which he put upon a seat and the bestowal of which left\nthe lady presently free to turn to me with a reproach: \"I don't think it\nvery nice of you not to speak to me.\" I stared, then caught at her\nidentity through her voice; after which I reflected that she might\neasily have thought me the same sort of ass as I had thought Long. For\nshe was simply, it appeared, Grace Brissenden. We had, the three of us,\nthe carriage to ourselves, and we journeyed together for more than an\nhour, during which, in my corner, I had my companions opposite. We began\nat first by talking a little, and then as the train--a fast one--ran\nstraight and proportionately bellowed, we gave up the effort to compete\nwith its music. Meantime, however, we had exchanged with each other a\nfact or two to turn over in silence. Brissenden was coming later--not,\nindeed, that that was such a fact. But his wife was informed--she knew\nabout the numerous others; she had mentioned, while we waited, people\nand things: that Obert, R.A., was somewhere in the train, that her\nhusband was to bring on Lady John, and that Mrs. Froome and Lord Lutley\nwere in the wondrous new fashion--and their servants too, like a single\nhousehold--starting, travelling, arriving together. It came back to me\nas I sat there that when she mentioned Lady John as in charge of\nBrissenden the other member of our trio had expressed interest and\nsurprise--expressed it so as to have made her reply with a smile:\n\"Didn't you really know?\" This passage had taken place on the platform\nwhile, availing ourselves of our last minute, we hung about our door.\n\n\"Why in the world _should_ I know?\"\n\nTo which, with good nature, she had simply returned: \"Oh, it's only that\nI thought you always did!\" And they both had looked at me a little\noddly, as if appealing from each other. \"What in the world does she\nmean?\" Long might have seemed to ask; while Mrs. Brissenden conveyed\nwith light profundity: \"_You_ know why he should as well as I, don't\nyou?\" In point of fact I didn't in the least; and what afterwards struck\nme much more as the beginning of my anecdote was a word dropped by Long\nafter someone had come up to speak to her. I had then given him his cue\nby alluding to my original failure to place her. What in the world, in\nthe year or two, had happened to her? She had changed so extraordinarily\nfor the better. How could a woman who had been plain so long become\npretty so late?\n\nIt was just what he had been wondering. \"I didn't place her at first\nmyself. She had to speak to me. But I hadn't seen her since her\nmarriage, which was--wasn't it?--four or five years ago. She's amazing\nfor her age.\"\n\n\"What then _is_ her age?\"\n\n\"Oh--two or three-and-forty.\"\n\n\"She's prodigious for that. But can it be so great?\"\n\n\"Isn't it easy to count?\" he asked. \"Don't you remember, when poor Briss\nmarried her, how immensely she was older? What was it they called it?--a\ncase of child-stealing. Everyone made jokes. Briss isn't yet thirty.\"\nNo, I bethought myself, he wouldn't be; but I hadn't remembered the\ndifference as so great. What I had mainly remembered was that she had\nbeen rather ugly. At present she was rather handsome. Long, however, as\nto this, didn't agree. \"I'm bound to say I don't quite call it beauty.\"\n\n\"Oh, I only speak of it as relative. She looks so well--and somehow so\n'fine.' Why else shouldn't we have recognised her?\"\n\n\"Why indeed? But it isn't a thing with which beauty has to do.\" He had\nmade the matter out with an acuteness for which I shouldn't have given\nhim credit. \"What has happened to her is simply that--well, that nothing\nhas.\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened? But, my dear man, she has been married. That's\nsupposed to be something.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she has been married so little and so stupidly. It must be\ndesperately dull to be married to poor Briss. His comparative youth\ndoesn't, after all, make more of him. He's nothing but what he is. Her\nclock has simply stopped. She looks no older--that's all.\"\n\n\"Ah, and a jolly good thing too, when you start where she did. But I\ntake your discrimination,\" I added, \"as just. The only thing is that if\na woman doesn't grow older she may be said to grow younger; and if she\ngrows younger she may be supposed to grow prettier. That's all--except,\nof course, that it strikes me as charming also for Brissenden himself.\n_He_ had the face, I seem to recall, of a baby; so that if his wife did\nflaunt her fifty years----!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Long broke in, \"it wouldn't have mattered to him if she had.\nThat's the awfulness, don't you see? of the married state. People have\nto get used to each other's charms as well as to their faults. He\nwouldn't have noticed. It's only you and I who do, and the charm of it\nis for _us_.\"\n\n\"What a lucky thing then,\" I laughed, \"that, with Brissenden so out of\nit and relegated to the time-table's obscure hereafter, it should be you\nand I who enjoy her!\" I had been struck in what he said with more things\nthan I could take up, and I think I must have looked at him, while he\ntalked, with a slight return of my first mystification. He talked as I\nhad never heard him--less and less like the heavy Adonis who had so\noften \"cut\" me; and while he did so I was proportionately more conscious\nof the change in him. He noticed in fact after a little the vague\nconfusion of my gaze and asked me--with complete good nature--why I\nstared at him so hard. I sufficiently disembroiled myself to reply that\nI could only be fascinated by the way he made his points; to which\nhe--with the same sociability--made answer that he, on the contrary,\nmore than suspected me, clever and critical as I was, of amusement at\nhis artless prattle. He stuck none the less to his idea that what we had\nbeen discussing was lost on Brissenden. \"Ah, then I hope,\" I said, \"that\nat least Lady John isn't!\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady John----!\" And he turned away as if there were either too much\nor too little to say about her.\n\nI found myself engaged again with Mrs. Briss while he was occupied with\na newspaper-boy--and engaged, oddly, in very much the free view of him\nthat he and I had just taken of herself. She put it to me frankly that\nshe had never seen a man so improved: a confidence that I met with\nalacrity, as it showed me that, under the same impression, I had not\nbeen astray. She had only, it seemed, on seeing him, made him out with a\ngreat effort. I took in this confession, but I repaid it. \"He hinted to\nme that he had not known you more easily.\"\n\n\"More easily than you did? Oh, nobody does that; and, to be quite\nhonest, I've got used to it and don't mind. People talk of our changing\nevery seven years, but they make me feel as if I changed every seven\nminutes. What will you have, at any rate, and how can I help it? It's\nthe grind of life, the wear and tear of time and misfortune. And, you\nknow, I'm ninety-three.\"\n\n\"How young you must feel,\" I answered, \"to care to talk of your age! I\nenvy you, for nothing would induce me to let you know mine. You look,\nyou see, just twenty-five.\"\n\nIt evidently too, what I said, gave her pleasure--a pleasure that she\ncaught and held. \"Well, you can't say I dress it.\"\n\n\"No, you dress, I make out, ninety-three. If you _would_ only dress\ntwenty-five you'd look fifteen.\"\n\n\"Fifteen in a schoolroom charade!\" She laughed at this happily enough.\n\"Your compliment to my taste is odd. I know, at all events,\" she went\non, \"what's the difference in Mr. Long.\"\n\n\"Be so good then, for my relief, as to name it.\"\n\n\"Well, a very clever woman has for some time past----\"\n\n\"Taken\"--this beginning was of course enough--\"a particular interest in\nhim? Do you mean Lady John?\" I inquired; and, as she evidently did, I\nrather demurred. \"Do you call Lady John a very clever woman?\"\n\n\"Surely. That's why I kindly arranged that, as she was to take, I\nhappened to learn, the next train, Guy should come with her.\"\n\n\"You arranged it?\" I wondered. \"She's not so clever as you then.\"\n\n\"Because you feel that _she_ wouldn't, or couldn't? No doubt she\nwouldn't have made the same point of it--for more than one reason. Poor\nGuy hasn't pretensions--has nothing but his youth and his beauty. But\nthat's precisely why I'm sorry for him and try whenever I can to give\nhim a lift. Lady John's company _is_, you see, a lift.\"\n\n\"You mean it has so unmistakably been one to Long?\"\n\n\"Yes--it has positively given him a mind and a tongue. _That's_ what has\ncome over him.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, \"it's a most extraordinary case--such as one really has\nnever met.\"\n\n\"Oh, but,\" she objected, \"it happens.\"\n\n\"Ah, so very seldom! Yes--I've positively never met it. Are you very\nsure,\" I insisted, \"that Lady John is the influence?\"\n\n\"I don't mean to say, of course,\" she replied, \"that he looks fluttered\nif you mention her, that he doesn't in fact look as blank as a\npickpocket. But that proves nothing--or rather, as they're known to be\nalways together, and she from morning till night as pointed as a\nhat-pin, it proves just what one sees. One simply takes it in.\"\n\nI turned the picture round. \"They're scarcely together when she's\ntogether with Brissenden.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's only once in a way. It's a thing that from time to time such\npeople--don't you know?--make a particular point of: they cultivate, to\ncover their game, the appearance of other little friendships. It puts\noutsiders off the scent, and the real thing meanwhile goes on. Besides,\nyou yourself acknowledge the effect. If she hasn't made him clever, what\nhas she made him? She has given him, steadily, more and more intellect.\"\n\n\"Well, you may be right,\" I laughed, \"though you speak as if it were\ncod-liver oil. Does she administer it, as a daily dose, by the spoonful?\nor only as a drop at a time? Does he take it in his food? Is he\nsupposed to know? The difficulty for me is simply that if I've seen the\nhandsome grow ugly and the ugly handsome, the fat grow thin and the thin\nfat, the short grow long and the long short; if I've even, likewise,\nseen the clever, as I've too fondly, at least, supposed them, grow\nstupid: so have I _not_ seen--no, not once in all my days--the stupid\ngrow clever.\"\n\nIt was a question, none the less, on which she could perfectly stand up.\n\"All I can say is then that you'll have, the next day or two, an\ninteresting new experience.\"\n\n\"It _will_ be interesting,\" I declared while I thought--\"and all the\nmore if I make out for myself that Lady John _is_ the agent.\"\n\n\"You'll make it out if you talk to her--that is, I mean, if you make\n_her_ talk. You'll see how she _can_.\"\n\n\"She keeps her wit then,\" I asked, \"in spite of all she pumps into\nothers?\"\n\n\"Oh, she has enough for two!\"\n\n\"I'm immensely struck with yours,\" I replied, \"as well as with your\ngenerosity. I've seldom seen a woman take so handsome a view of\nanother.\"\n\n\"It's because I like to be kind!\" she said with the best faith in the\nworld; to which I could only return, as we entered the train, that it\nwas a kindness Lady John would doubtless appreciate. Long rejoined us,\nand we ran, as I have said, our course; which, as I have also noted,\nseemed short to me in the light of such a blaze of suggestion. To each\nof my companions--and the fact stuck out of them--something\nunprecedented had happened.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe day was as fine and the scene as fair at Newmarch as the party was\nnumerous and various; and my memory associates with the rest of the long\nafternoon many renewals of acquaintance and much sitting and strolling,\nfor snatches of talk, in the long shade of great trees and through the\nstraight walks of old gardens. A couple of hours thus passed, and fresh\naccessions enriched the picture. There were persons I was curious of--of\nLady John, for instance, of whom I promised myself an early view; but we\nwere apt to be carried away in currents that reflected new images and\nsufficiently beguiled impatience. I recover, all the same, a full\nsequence of impressions, each of which, I afterwards saw, had been\nappointed to help all the others. If my anecdote, as I have mentioned,\nhad begun, at Paddington, at a particular moment, it gathered substance\nstep by step and without missing a link. The links, in fact, should I\ncount them all, would make too long a chain. They formed, nevertheless,\nthe happiest little chapter of accidents, though a series of which I can\nscarce give more than the general effect.\n\nOne of the first accidents was that, before dinner, I met Ford Obert\nwandering a little apart with Mrs. Server, and that, as they were known\nto me as agreeable acquaintances, I should have faced them with\nconfidence had I not immediately drawn from their sequestered air the\nfear of interrupting them. Mrs. Server was always lovely and Obert\nalways expert; the latter straightway pulled up, however, making me as\nwelcome as if their converse had dropped. She was extraordinarily\npretty, markedly responsive, conspicuously charming, but he gave me a\nlook that really seemed to say: \"Don't--there's a good fellow--leave me\nany longer alone with her!\" I had met her at Newmarch before--it was\nindeed only so that I had met her--and I knew how she was valued there.\nI also knew that an aversion to pretty women--numbers of whom he had\npreserved for a grateful posterity--was his sign neither as man nor as\nartist; the effect of all of which was to make me ask myself what she\ncould have been doing to him. Making love, possibly--yet from that he\nwould scarce have appealed. She wouldn't, on the other hand, have given\nhim her company only to be inhuman. I joined them, at all events,\nlearning from Mrs. Server that she had come by a train previous to my\nown; and we made a slow trio till, at a turn of the prospect, we came\nupon another group. It consisted of Mrs. Froome and Lord Lutley and of\nGilbert Long and Lady John--mingled and confounded, as might be said,\nnot assorted according to tradition. Long and Mrs. Froome came first, I\nrecollect, together, and his lordship turned away from Lady John on\nseeing me rather directly approach her. She had become for me, on the\nspot, as interesting as, while we travelled, I had found my two friends\nin the train. As the source of the flow of \"intellect\" that had\ntransmuted our young man, she had every claim to an earnest attention;\nand I should soon have been ready to pronounce that she rewarded it as\nrichly as usual. She was indeed, as Mrs. Briss had said, as pointed as a\nhat-pin, and I bore in mind that lady's injunction to look in her for\nthe answer to our riddle.\n\nThe riddle, I may mention, sounded afresh to my ear in Gilbert Long's\ngay voice; it hovered there--before me, beside, behind me, as we all\npaused--in his light, restless step, a nervous animation that seemed to\nmultiply his presence. He became really, for the moment, under this\nimpression, the thing I was most conscious of; I heard him, I felt him\neven while I exchanged greetings with the sorceress by whose wand he had\nbeen touched. To be touched myself was doubtless not quite what I\nwanted; yet I wanted, distinctly, a glimpse; so that, with the smart\nwelcome Lady John gave me, I might certainly have felt that I was on the\nway to get it. The note of Long's predominance deepened during these\nminutes in a manner I can't describe, and I continued to feel that\nthough we pretended to talk it was to him only we listened. He had us\nall in hand; he controlled for the moment all our attention and our\nrelations. He was in short, as a consequence of our attitude, in\npossession of the scene to a tune he couldn't have dreamed of a year or\ntwo before--inasmuch as at that period he could have figured at no such\neminence without making a fool of himself. And the great thing was that\nif his eminence was now so perfectly graced he yet knew less than any of\nus what was the matter with him. He was unconscious of how he had \"come\nout\"--which was exactly what sharpened my wonder. Lady John, on her\nside, was thoroughly conscious, and I had a fancy that she looked at me\nto measure how far _I_ was. I cared, naturally, not in the least what\nshe guessed; her interest for me was all in the operation of her\ninfluence. I am afraid I watched to catch it in the act--watched her\nwith a curiosity of which she might well have become aware.\n\nWhat an intimacy, what an intensity of relation, I said to myself, so\nsuccessful a process implied! It was of course familiar enough that when\npeople were so deeply in love they rubbed off on each other--that a\ngreat pressure of soul to soul usually left on either side a sufficient\nshow of tell-tale traces. But for Long to have been so stamped as I\nfound him, how the pliant wax must have been prepared and the seal of\npassion applied! What an affection the woman working such a change in\nhim must have managed to create as a preface to her influence! With what\na sense of her charm she must have paved the way for it! Strangely\nenough, however--it was even rather irritating--there was nothing more\nthan usual in Lady John to assist my view of the height at which the\npair so evoked must move. These things--the way other people could feel\nabout each other, the power not one's self, in the given instance, that\nmade for passion--were of course at best the mystery of mysteries;\nstill, there were cases in which fancy, sounding the depths or the\nshallows, could at least drop the lead. Lady John, perceptibly, was no\nsuch case; imagination, in her presence, was but the weak wing of the\ninsect that bumps against the glass. She was pretty, prompt, hard, and,\nin a way that was special to her, a mistress at once of \"culture\" and of\nslang. She was like a hat--with one of Mrs. Briss's hat-pins--askew on\nthe bust of Virgil. Her ornamental information--as strong as a coat of\nfurniture-polish--almost knocked you down. What I felt in her now more\nthan ever was that, having a reputation for \"point\" to keep up, she was\nalways under arms, with absences and anxieties like those of a celebrity\nat a public dinner. She thought too much of her \"speech\"--of how soon it\nwould have to come. It was none the less wonderful, however, that, as\nGrace Brissenden had said, she should still find herself with intellect\nto spare--have lavished herself by precept and example on Long and yet\nhave remained for each other interlocutor as fresh as the clown bounding\ninto the ring. She cracked, for my benefit, as many jokes and turned as\nmany somersaults as might have been expected; after which I thought it\nfair to let her off. We all faced again to the house, for dressing and\ndinner were in sight.\n\nI found myself once more, as we moved, with Mrs. Server, and I remember\nrejoicing that, sympathetic as she showed herself, she didn't think it\nnecessary to be, like Lady John, always \"ready.\" She was delightfully\nhandsome--handsomer than ever; slim, fair, fine, with charming pale eyes\nand splendid auburn hair. I said to myself that I hadn't done her\njustice; she hadn't organised her forces, was a little helpless and\nvague, but there was ease for the weary in her happy nature and her\npeculiar grace. These last were articles on which, five minutes later,\nbefore the house, where we still had a margin, I was moved to challenge\nFord Obert.\n\n\"What was the matter just now--when, though you were so fortunately\noccupied, you yet seemed to call me to the rescue?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he laughed, \"I was only occupied in being frightened!\"\n\n\"But at what?\"\n\n\"Well, at a sort of sense that she wanted to make love to me.\"\n\nI reflected. \"Mrs. Server? Does Mrs. Server make love?\"\n\n\"It seemed to me,\" my friend replied, \"that she began on it to _you_ as\nsoon as she got hold of you. Weren't you aware?\"\n\nI debated afresh; I didn't know that I had been. \"Not to the point of\nterror. She's so gentle and so appealing. Even if she took one in hand\nwith violence, moreover,\" I added, \"I don't see why terror--given so\ncharming a person--should be the result. It's flattering.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're brave,\" said Obert.\n\n\"I didn't know you were ever timid. How can you be, in your profession?\nDoesn't it come back to me, for that matter, that--only the other\nyear--you painted her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I faced her to that extent. But she's different now.\"\n\nI scarcely made it out. \"In what way different? She's as charming as\never.\"\n\nAs if even for his own satisfaction my friend seemed to think a little.\n\"Well, her affections were not then, I imagine, at her disposal. I judge\nthat that's what it must have been. They were fixed--with intensity; and\nit made the difference with _me_. Her imagination had, for the time,\nrested its wing. At present it's ready for flight--it seeks a fresh\nperch. It's trying. Take care.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't flatter myself,\" I laughed, \"that I've only to hold out my\nhand! At any rate,\" I went on, \"_I_ sha'n't call for help.\"\n\nHe seemed to think again. \"I don't know. You'll see.\"\n\n\"If I do I shall see a great deal more than I now suspect.\" He wanted to\nget off to dress, but I still held him. \"Isn't she wonderfully lovely?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he simply exclaimed.\n\n\"Isn't she as lovely as she seems?\"\n\nBut he had already broken away. \"What has that to do with it?\"\n\n\"What has anything, then?\"\n\n\"She's too beastly unhappy.\"\n\n\"But isn't that just one's advantage?\"\n\n\"No. It's uncanny.\" And he escaped.\n\nThe question had at all events brought us indoors and so far up our\nstaircase as to where it branched towards Obert's room. I followed it to\nmy corridor, with which other occasions had made me acquainted, and I\nreached the door on which I expected to find my card of designation.\nThis door, however, was open, so as to show me, in momentary possession\nof the room, a gentleman, unknown to me, who, in unguided quest of his\nquarters, appeared to have arrived from the other end of the passage. He\nhad just seen, as the property of another, my unpacked things, with\nwhich he immediately connected me. He moreover, to my surprise, on my\nentering, sounded my name, in response to which I could only at first\nremain blank. It was in fact not till I had begun to help him place\nhimself that, correcting my blankness, I knew him for Guy Brissenden. He\nhad been put by himself, for some reason, in the bachelor wing and,\nexploring at hazard, had mistaken the signs. By the time we found his\nservant and his lodging I had reflected on the oddity of my having been\nas stupid about the husband as I had been about the wife. He had escaped\nmy notice since our arrival, but I had, as a much older man, met\nhim--the hero of his odd union--at some earlier time. Like his wife,\nnone the less, he had now struck me as a stranger, and it was not till,\nin his room, I stood a little face to face with him that I made out the\nwonderful reason.\n\nThe wonderful reason was that I was _not_ a much older man; Guy\nBrissenden, at any rate, was not a much younger. It was he who was\nold--it was he who was older--it was he who was oldest. That was so\ndisconcertingly what he had become. It was in short what he would have\nbeen had he been as old as he looked. He looked almost anything--he\nlooked quite sixty. I made it out again at dinner, where, from a\ndistance, but opposite, I had him in sight. Nothing could have been\nstranger than the way that, fatigued, fixed, settled, he seemed to have\npiled up the years. They were there without having had time to arrive.\nIt was as if he had discovered some miraculous short cut to the common\ndoom. He had grown old, in fine, as people you see after an interval\nsometimes strike you as having grown rich--too quickly for the honest,\nor at least for the straight, way. He had cheated or inherited or\nspeculated. It took me but a minute then to add him to my little\ngallery--the small collection, I mean, represented by his wife and by\nGilbert Long, as well as in some degree doubtless also by Lady John: the\nmuseum of those who put to me with such intensity the question of what\nhad happened to them. His wife, on the same side, was not out of my\nrange, and now, largely exposed, lighted, jewelled, and enjoying\nmoreover visibly the sense of these things--his wife, upon my honour, as\nI soon remarked to the lady next me, his wife (it was too prodigious!)\nlooked about twenty.\n\n\"Yes--isn't it funny?\" said the lady next me.\n\nIt was so funny that it set me thinking afresh and that, with the\ninterest of it, which became a positive excitement, I had to keep myself\nin hand in order not too publicly to explain, not to break out right and\nleft with my reflections. I don't know why--it was a sense instinctive\nand unreasoned, but I felt from the first that if I was on the scent of\nsomething ultimate I had better waste neither my wonder nor my wisdom.\nI _was_ on the scent--that I was sure of; and yet even after I was sure\nI should still have been at a loss to put my enigma itself into words. I\nwas just conscious, vaguely, of being on the track of a law, a law that\nwould fit, that would strike me as governing the delicate\nphenomena--delicate though so marked--that my imagination found itself\nplaying with. A part of the amusement they yielded came, I daresay, from\nmy exaggerating them--grouping them into a larger mystery (and thereby a\nlarger \"law\") than the facts, as observed, yet warranted; but that is\nthe common fault of minds for which the vision of life is an obsession.\nThe obsession pays, if one will; but to pay it has to borrow. After\ndinner, but while the men were still in the room, I had some talk again\nwith Long, of whom I inquired if he had been so placed as to see \"poor\nBriss.\"\n\nHe appeared to wonder, and poor Briss, with our shifting of seats, was\nnow at a distance. \"I think so--but I didn't particularly notice. What's\nthe matter with poor Briss?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I thought you might be able to tell me. But if\nnothing, in him, strikes you----!\"\n\nHe met my eyes a moment--then glanced about. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Behind you; only don't turn round to look, for he knows----\" But I\ndropped, having caught something directed toward me in Brissenden's\nface. My interlocutor remained blank, simply asking me, after an\ninstant, what it was he knew. On this I said what I meant. \"He knows\nwe've noticed.\"\n\nLong wondered again. \"Ah, but I _haven't_!\" He spoke with some\nsharpness.\n\n\"He knows,\" I continued, noting the sharpness too, \"what's the matter\nwith him.\"\n\n\"Then what the devil is it?\"\n\nI waited a little, having for the moment an idea on my hands. \"Do you\nsee him often?\"\n\nLong disengaged the ash from his cigarette. \"No. Why should I?\"\n\nDistinctly, he was uneasy--though as yet perhaps but vaguely--at what I\nmight be coming to. That was precisely my idea, and if I pitied him a\nlittle for my pressure my idea was yet what most possessed me. \"Do you\nmean there's nothing in him that strikes you?\"\n\nOn this, unmistakably, he looked at me hard. \"'Strikes' me--in that boy?\nNothing in him, that I know of, ever struck me in my life. He's not an\nobject of the smallest interest to me!\"\n\nI felt that if I insisted I should really stir up the old Long, the\nstolid coxcomb, capable of rudeness, with whose redemption,\nreabsorption, supersession--one scarcely knew what to call it--I had\nbeen so happily impressed. \"Oh, of course, if you haven't noticed, you\nhaven't, and the matter I was going to speak of will have no point. You\nwon't know what I mean.\" With which I paused long enough to let his\ncuriosity operate if his denial had been sincere. But it hadn't. His\ncuriosity never operated. He only exclaimed, more indulgently, that he\ndidn't know what I was talking about; and I recognised after a little\nthat if I had made him, without intention, uncomfortable, this was\nexactly a proof of his being what Mrs. Briss, at the station, had called\ncleverer, and what I had so much remarked while, in the garden before\ndinner, he held our small company. Nobody, nothing could, in the time of\nhis inanity, have made him turn a hair. It was the mark of his\naggrandisement. But I spared him--so far as was consistent with my wish\nfor absolute certainty; changed the subject, spoke of other things, took\npains to sound disconnectedly, and only after reference to several of\nthe other ladies, the name over which we had just felt friction. \"Mrs.\nBrissenden's quite fabulous.\"\n\nHe appeared to have strayed, in our interval, far. \"'Fabulous'?\"\n\n\"Why, for the figure that, by candle-light and in cloth-of-silver and\ndiamonds, she is still able to make.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes!\" He showed as relieved to be able to see what I meant.\n\"She has grown so very much less plain.\"\n\nBut that wasn't at all what I meant. \"Ah,\" I said, \"you put it the\nother way at Paddington--which was much more the right one.\"\n\nHe had quite forgotten. \"How then did I put it?\"\n\nAs he had done before, I got rid of my ash. \"She hasn't grown very much\nless plain. She has only grown very much less old.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" he laughed, but as if his interest had quickly dropped,\n\"youth is--comparatively speaking--beauty.\"\n\n\"Oh, not always. Look at poor Briss himself.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like better, beauty is youth.\"\n\n\"Not always, either,\" I returned. \"Certainly only when it _is_ beauty.\nTo see how little it may be either, look,\" I repeated, \"at poor Briss.\"\n\n\"I thought you told me just now not to!\" He rose at last in his\nimpatience.\n\n\"Well, at present you can.\"\n\nI also got up, the other men at the same moment moved, and the subject\nof our reference stood in view. This indeed was but briefly, for, as if\nto examine a picture behind him, the personage in question suddenly\nturned his back. Long, however, had had time to take him in and then to\ndecide. \"I've looked. What then?\"\n\n\"You don't see anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Not what everyone else must?\"\n\n\"No, confound you!\"\n\nI already felt that, to be so tortuous, he must have had a reason, and\nthe search for his reason was what, from this moment, drew me on. I had\nin fact half guessed it as we stood there. But this only made me the\nmore explanatory. \"It isn't really, however, that Brissenden has grown\nless lovely--it's only that he has grown less young.\"\n\nTo which my friend, as we quitted the room, replied simply: \"Oh!\"\n\nThe effect I have mentioned was, none the less, too absurd. The poor\nyouth's back, before us, still as if consciously presented, confessed to\nthe burden of time. \"How old,\" I continued, \"did we make out this\nafternoon that he would be?\"\n\n\"That who would?\"\n\n\"Why, poor Briss.\"\n\nHe fairly pulled up in our march. \"Have you got him on the brain?\"\n\n\"Don't I seem to remember, my dear man, that it was you yourself who\nknew? He's thirty at the most. He can't possibly be more. And there he\nis: as fine, as swaddled, as royal a mummy, to the eye, as one would\nwish to see. Don't pretend! But it's all right.\" I laughed as I took\nmyself up. \"I must talk to Lady John.\"\n\nI did talk to her, but I must come to it. What is most to the point just\nhere is an observation or two that, in the smoking-room, before going\nto bed, I exchanged with Ford Obert. I forbore, as I have hinted, to\nshow all I saw, but it was lawfully open to me to judge of what other\npeople did; and I had had before dinner my little proof that, on\noccasion, Obert could see as much as most. Yet I said nothing more to\nhim for the present about Mrs. Server. The Brissendens were new to him,\nand his experience of every sort of facial accident, of human sign, made\nhim just the touchstone I wanted. Nothing, naturally, was easier than to\nturn him on the question of the fair and the foul, type and character,\nweal and woe, among our fellow-visitors; so that my mention of the air\nof disparity in the couple I have just named came in its order and\nproduced its effect. This effect was that of my seeing--which was all I\nrequired--that if the disparity was marked for him this expert observer\ncould yet read it quite the wrong way. Why had so fine a young creature\nmarried a man three times her age? He was of course astounded when I\ntold him the young creature was much nearer three times Brissenden's,\nand this led to some interesting talk between us as to the consequences,\nin general, of such association on such terms. The particular case\nbefore us, I easily granted, sinned by over-emphasis, but it was a fair,\nthough a gross, illustration of what almost always occurred when twenty\nand forty, when thirty and sixty, mated or mingled, lived together in\nintimacy. Intimacy of course had to be postulated. Then either the high\nnumber or the low always got the upper hand, and it was usually the high\nthat succeeded. It seemed, in other words, more possible to go back than\nto keep still, to grow young than to remain so. If Brissenden had been\nof his wife's age and his wife of Brissenden's, it would thus be he who\nmust have redescended the hill, it would be she who would have been\npushed over the brow. There was really a touching truth in it, the stuff\nof--what did people call such things?--an apologue or a parable. \"One of\nthe pair,\" I said, \"has to pay for the other. What ensues is a miracle,\nand miracles are expensive. What's a greater one than to have your youth\ntwice over? It's a second wind, another 'go'--which isn't the sort of\nthing life mostly treats us to. Mrs. Briss had to get her new blood, her\nextra allowance of time and bloom, somewhere; and from whom could she so\nconveniently extract them as from Guy himself? She _has_, by an\nextraordinary feat of legerdemain, extracted them; and he, on his side,\nto supply her, has had to tap the sacred fount. But the sacred fount is\nlike the greedy man's description of the turkey as an 'awkward' dinner\ndish. It may be sometimes too much for a single share, but it's not\nenough to go round.\"\n\nObert was at all events sufficiently struck with my view to throw out a\nquestion on it. \"So that, paying to his last drop, Mr. Briss, as you\ncall him, can only die of the business?\"\n\n\"Oh, not yet, I hope. But before _her_--yes: long.\"\n\nHe was much amused. \"How you polish them off!\"\n\n\"I only talk,\" I returned, \"as you paint; not a bit worse! But one must\nindeed wonder,\" I conceded, \"how the poor wretches feel.\"\n\n\"You mean whether Brissenden likes it?\"\n\nI made up my mind on the spot. \"If he loves her he must. That is if he\nloves her passionately, sublimely.\" I saw it all. \"It's in fact just\nbecause he does so love her that the miracle, for her, is wrought.\"\n\n\"Well,\" my friend reflected, \"for taking a miracle coolly----!\"\n\n\"She hasn't her equal? Yes, she does take it. She just quietly, but just\nselfishly, profits by it.\"\n\n\"And doesn't see then how her victim loses?\"\n\n\"No. She can't. The perception, if she had it, would be painful and\nterrible--might even be fatal to the process. So she hasn't it. She\npasses round it. It takes all her flood of life to meet her own chance.\nShe has only a wonderful sense of success and well-being. The _other_\nconsciousness----\"\n\n\"Is all for the other party?\"\n\n\"The author of the sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Then how beautifully 'poor Briss,'\" my companion said, \"must have it!\"\n\nI had already assured myself. He had gone to bed, and my fancy followed\nhim. \"Oh, he has it so that, though he goes, in his passion, about with\nher, he dares scarcely show his face.\" And I made a final induction.\n\"The agents of the sacrifice are uncomfortable, I gather, when they\nsuspect or fear that you see.\"\n\nMy friend was charmed with my ingenuity. \"How you've worked it out!\"\n\n\"Well, I feel as if I were on the way to something.\"\n\nHe looked surprised. \"Something still more?\"\n\n\"Something still more.\" I had an impulse to tell him I scarce knew what.\nBut I kept it under. \"I seem to snuff up----\"\n\n\"_Quoi donc?_\"\n\n\"The sense of a discovery to be made.\"\n\n\"And of what?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you to-morrow. Good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nI did on the morrow several things, but the first was not to redeem that\nvow. It was to address myself straight to Grace Brissenden. \"I must let\nyou know that, in spite of your guarantee, it doesn't go at all--oh, but\nnot at all! I've tried Lady John, as you enjoined, and I can't but feel\nthat she leaves us very much where we were.\" Then, as my listener seemed\nnot quite to remember where we had been, I came to her help. \"You said\nyesterday at Paddington, to explain the change in Gilbert Long--don't\nyou recall?--that that woman, plying him with her genius and giving him\nof her best, is clever enough for two. She's not clever enough then, it\nstrikes me, for three--or at any rate for four. I confess I don't see\nit. Does she really dazzle _you_?\"\n\nMy friend had caught up. \"Oh, you've a standard of wit!\"\n\n\"No, I've only a sense of reality--a sense not at all satisfied by the\ntheory of such an influence as Lady John's.\"\n\nShe wondered. \"Such a one as whose else then?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's for us still to find out! Of course this can't be easy; for\nas the appearance is inevitably a kind of betrayal, it's in somebody's\ninterest to conceal it.\"\n\nThis Mrs. Brissenden grasped. \"Oh, you mean in the lady's?\"\n\n\"In the lady's most. But also in Long's own, if he's really tender of\nthe lady--which is precisely what our theory posits.\"\n\nMy companion, once roused, was all there. \"I see. You call the\nappearance a kind of betrayal because it points to the relation behind\nit.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And the relation--to do that sort of thing--must be necessarily so\nawfully intimate.\"\n\n\"_Intimissima._\"\n\n\"And kept therefore in the background exactly in that proportion.\"\n\n\"Exactly in that proportion.\"\n\n\"Very well then,\" said Mrs. Brissenden, \"doesn't Mr. Long's tenderness\nof Lady John quite fall in with what I mentioned to you?\"\n\nI remembered what she had mentioned to me. \"His making her come down\nwith poor Briss?\"\n\n\"Nothing less.\"\n\n\"And is that all you go upon?\"\n\n\"That and lots more.\"\n\nI thought a minute--but I had been abundantly thinking. \"I know what you\nmean by 'lots.' Is Brissenden in it?\"\n\n\"Dear no--poor Briss! He wouldn't like that. _I_ saw the manoeuvre,\nbut Guy didn't. And you must have noticed how he stuck to her all last\nevening.\"\n\n\"How Gilbert Long stuck to Lady John? Oh yes, I noticed. They were like\nLord Lutley and Mrs. Froome. But is that what one can call being tender\nof her?\"\n\nMy companion weighed it. \"He must speak to her _sometimes_. I'm glad you\nadmit, at any rate,\" she continued, \"that it does take what you so\nprettily call some woman's secretly giving him of her best to account\nfor him.\"\n\n\"Oh, that I admit with all my heart--or at least with all my head. Only,\nLady John has none of the signs----\"\n\n\"Of being the beneficent woman? What then _are_ they--the signs--to be\nso plain?\" I was not yet quite ready to say, however; on which she\nadded: \"It proves nothing, you know, that _you_ don't like her.\"\n\n\"No. It would prove more if she didn't like _me_, which--fatuous fool as\nyou may find me--I verily believe she does. If she hated me it would be,\nyou see, for my ruthless analysis of her secret. She _has_ no secret.\nShe would like awfully to have--and she would like almost as much to be\nbelieved to have. Last evening, after dinner, she could feel perhaps for\na while that she _was_ believed. But it won't do. There's nothing in\nit. You asked me just now,\" I pursued, \"what the signs of such a secret\nwould naturally be. Well, bethink yourself a moment of what the secret\nitself must naturally be.\"\n\nOh, she looked as if she knew all about _that_! \"Awfully\ncharming--mustn't it?--to act upon a person, through an affection, so\ndeeply.\"\n\n\"Yes--it can certainly be no vulgar flirtation.\" I felt a little like a\nteacher encouraging an apt pupil; but I could only go on with the\nlesson. \"Whoever she is, she gives all she has. She keeps nothing\nback--nothing for herself.\"\n\n\"I see--because _he_ takes everything. He just cleans her out.\" She\nlooked at me--pleased at last really to understand--with the best\nconscience in the world. \"Who _is_ the lady then?\"\n\nBut I could answer as yet only by a question. \"How can she possibly be a\nwoman who gives absolutely nothing whatever; who scrapes and saves and\nhoards; who keeps every crumb for herself? The whole show's there--to\nminister to Lady John's vanity and advertise the business--behind her\nsmart shop-window. You can see it, as much as you like, and even amuse\nyourself with pricing it. But she never parts with an article. If poor\nLong depended on _her_----\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" She was really interested.\n\n\"Why, he'd be the same poor Long as ever. He would go as he used to\ngo--naked and unashamed. No,\" I wound up, \"he deals--turned out as we\nnow see him--at another establishment.\"\n\n\"I'll grant it,\" said Mrs. Brissenden, \"if you'll only name me the\nplace.\"\n\nAh, I could still but laugh and resume! \"He doesn't screen Lady\nJohn--she doesn't screen herself--with your husband or with anybody.\nIt's she who's herself the screen! And pleased as she is at being so\nclever, and at being thought so, she doesn't even know it. She doesn't\nso much as suspect it. She's an unmitigated fool about it. 'Of course\nMr. Long's clever, because he's in love with me and sits at my feet, and\ndon't you see how clever _I_ am? Don't you hear what good things I\nsay--wait a little, I'm going to say another in about three minutes; and\nhow, if you'll only give him time too, he comes out with them after me?\nThey don't perhaps sound so good, but you see where he has got them. I'm\nso brilliant, in fine, that the men who admire me have only to imitate\nme, which, you observe, they strikingly do.' Something like that is all\nher philosophy.\"\n\nMy friend turned it over. \"You do sound like her, you know. Yet how, if\na woman's stupid----\"\n\n\"Can she have made a man clever? She can't. She can't at least have\nbegun it. What we shall know the real person by, in the case that you\nand I are studying, is that the man himself will have made her what she\nhas become. She will have done just what Lady John has not done--she\nwill have put up the shutters and closed the shop. She will have parted,\nfor her friend, with her wit.\"\n\n\"So that she may be regarded as reduced to idiocy?\"\n\n\"Well--so I can only see it.\"\n\n\"And that if we look, therefore, for the right idiot----\"\n\n\"We shall find the right woman--our friend's mystic Egeria? Yes, we\nshall be at least approaching the truth. We shall 'burn,' as they say in\nhide-and-seek.\" I of course kept to the point that the idiot would have\nto _be_ the right one. _Any_ idiot wouldn't be to the purpose. If it was\nenough that a woman was a fool the search might become hopeless even in\na house that would have passed but ill for a fool's paradise. We were on\none of the shaded terraces, to which, here and there, a tall window\nstood open. The picture without was all morning and August, and within\nall clear dimness and rich gleams. We stopped once or twice, raking the\ngloom for lights, and it was at some such moment that Mrs. Brissenden\nasked me if I then regarded Gilbert Long as now exalted to the position\nof the most brilliant of our companions. \"The cleverest man of the\nparty?\"--it pulled me up a little. \"Hardly that, perhaps--for don't you\nsee the proofs I'm myself giving you? But say he _is_\"--I\nconsidered--\"the cleverest but one.\" The next moment I had seen what she\nmeant. \"In that case the thing we're looking for ought logically to be\nthe person, of the opposite sex, giving us the maximum sense of\ndepletion for his benefit? The biggest fool, you suggest, _must_,\nconsistently, be the right one? Yes again; it would so seem. But that's\nnot really, you see, the short cut it sounds. The biggest fool is what\nwe want, but the question is to discover who _is_ the biggest.\"\n\n\"I'm glad then _I_ feel so safe!\" Mrs. Brissenden laughed.\n\n\"Oh, you're not the biggest!\" I handsomely conceded. \"Besides, as I say,\nthere must be the other evidence--the evidence of relations.\"\n\nWe had gone on, with this, a few steps, but my companion again checked\nme, while her nod toward a window gave my attention a lead. \"Won't\n_that_, as it happens, then do?\" We could just see, from where we stood,\na corner of one of the rooms. It was occupied by a seated couple, a lady\nwhose face was in sight and a gentleman whose identity was attested by\nhis back, a back somehow replete for us, at the moment, with a guilty\nsignificance. There _was_ the evidence of relations. That we had\nsuddenly caught Long in the act of presenting his receptacle at the\nsacred fount seemed announced by the tone in which Mrs. Brissenden named\nthe other party--\"Mme. de Dreuil!\" We looked at each other, I was\naware, with some elation; but our triumph was brief. The Comtesse de\nDreuil, we quickly felt--an American married to a Frenchman--wasn't at\nall the thing. She was almost as much \"all there\" as Lady John. She was\nonly another screen, and we perceived, for that matter, the next minute,\nthat Lady John was also present. Another step had placed us within range\nof her; the picture revealed in the rich dusk of the room was a group of\nthree. From that moment, unanimously, we gave up Lady John, and as we\ncontinued our stroll my friend brought out her despair. \"Then he has\nnothing _but_ screens? The need for so many does suggest a fire!\" And in\nspite of discouragement she sounded, interrogatively, one after the\nother, the names of those ladies the perfection of whose presence of\nmind might, when considered, pass as questionable. We soon, however,\nfelt our process to be, practically, a trifle invidious. Not one of the\npersons named could, at any rate--to do them all justice--affect us as\nan intellectual ruin. It was natural therefore for Mrs. Brissenden to\nconclude with scepticism. \"She may exist--and exist as you require her;\nbut what, after all, proves that she's here? She mayn't have come down\nwith him. Does it necessarily follow that they always go about\ntogether?\"\n\nI was ready to declare that it necessarily followed. I had my idea, and\nI didn't see why I shouldn't bring it out. \"It's my belief that he no\nmore goes away without her than you go away without poor Briss.\"\n\nShe surveyed me in splendid serenity. \"But what have we in common?\"\n\n\"With the parties to an abandoned flirtation? Well, you've in common\nyour mutual attachment and the fact that you're thoroughly happy\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she good-humouredly answered, \"we don't flirt!\"\n\n\"Well, at all events, you don't separate. He doesn't really suffer you\nout of his sight, and, to circulate in the society you adorn, you don't\nleave him at home.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" she asked, looking at me, I thought, just a trifle\nharder.\n\n\"It isn't a question of why you shouldn't--it's a question of whether\nyou do. You don't--do you? That's all.\"\n\nShe thought it over as if for the first time. \"It seems to me I often\nleave him when I don't want him.\"\n\n\"Oh, when you don't want him--yes. But when don't you want him? You want\nhim when you want to be right, and you want to be right when you mix in\na scene like this. I mean,\" I continued for my private amusement, \"when\nyou want to be happy. Happiness, you know, is, to a lady in the full\ntide of social success, even more becoming than a new French frock. You\nhave the advantage, for your beauty, of being admirably married. You\nbloom in your husband's presence. I don't say he need always be at your\nelbow; I simply say that you're most completely yourself when he's not\nfar off. If there were nothing else there would be the help given you by\nyour quiet confidence in his lawful passion.\"\n\n\"I'm bound to say,\" Mrs. Brissenden replied, \"that such help is\nconsistent with his not having spoken to me since we parted, yesterday,\nto come down here by different trains. We haven't so much as met since\nour arrival. My finding him so indispensable is consistent with my not\nhaving so much as looked at him. Indispensable, please, for what?\"\n\n\"For your not being without him.\"\n\n\"What then do I do _with_ him?\"\n\nI hesitated--there were so many ways of putting it; but I gave them all\nup. \"Ah, I think it will be only _he_ who can tell you! My point is that\nyou've the instinct--playing in you, on either side, with all the ease\nof experience--of what you are to each other. All I mean is that it's\nthe instinct that Long and _his_ good friend must have. They too perhaps\nhaven't spoken to each other. But where he comes she does, and where she\ncomes he does. That's why I know she's among us.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful what you know!\" Mrs. Brissenden again laughed. \"How can\nyou think of them as enjoying the facilities of people in _our_\nsituation?\"\n\n\"Of people married and therefore logically in presence? I don't,\" I was\nable to reply, \"speak of their facilities as the same, and I recognise\nevery limit to their freedom. But I maintain, none the less, that so far\nas they _can_ go, they do go. It's a relation, and they work the\nrelation: the relation, exquisite surely, of knowing they help each\nother to shine. Why are they not, therefore, like you and Brissenden?\nWhat I make out is that when they do shine one will find--though only\nafter a hunt, I admit, as you see--they must both have been involved.\nFeeling their need, and consummately expert, they will have managed,\nhave arranged.\"\n\nShe took it in with her present odd mixture of the receptive and the\nderisive. \"Arranged what?\"\n\n\"Oh, ask _her_!\"\n\n\"I would if I could find her!\" After which, for a moment, my\ninterlocutress again considered. \"But I thought it was just your\ncontention that _she_ doesn't shine. If it's Lady John's perfect repair\nthat puts that sort of thing out of the question, your image, it seems\nto me, breaks down.\"\n\nIt did a little, I saw, but I gave it a tilt up. \"Not at all. It's a\ncase of shining as Brissenden shines.\" I wondered if I might go\nfurther--then risked it. \"By sacrifice.\"\n\nI perceived at once that I needn't fear: her conscience was too\ngood--she was only amused. \"Sacrifice, for mercy's sake, of what?\"\n\n\"Well--for mercy's sake--of his time.\"\n\n\"His time?\" She stared. \"Hasn't he all the time he wants?\"\n\n\"My dear lady,\" I smiled, \"he hasn't all the time _you_ want!\"\n\nBut she evidently had not a glimmering of what I meant. \"Don't I make\nthings of an ease, don't I make life of a charm, for him?\"\n\nI'm afraid I laughed out. \"That's perhaps exactly it! It's what Gilbert\nLong does for _his_ victim--makes things, makes life, of an ease and a\ncharm.\"\n\nShe stopped yet again, really wondering at me now. \"Then it's the woman,\nsimply, who's happiest?\"\n\n\"Because Brissenden's the man who is? Precisely!\"\n\nOn which for a minute, without her going on, we looked at each other.\n\"Do you really mean that if you only knew _me_ as I am, it would come to\nyou in the same way to hunt for my confederate? I mean if he weren't\nmade obvious, you know, by his being my husband.\"\n\nI turned this over. \"If you were only in flirtation--as you reminded me\njust now that you're not? Surely!\" I declared. \"I should arrive at him,\nperfectly, after all eliminations, on the principle of looking for the\ngreatest happiness----\"\n\n\"Of the smallest number? Well, he may be a small number,\" she\nindulgently sighed, \"but he's wholly content! Look at him now there,\"\nshe added the next moment, \"and judge.\" We had resumed our walk and\nturned the corner of the house, a movement that brought us into view of\na couple just round the angle of the terrace, a couple who, like\nourselves, must have paused in a sociable stroll. The lady, with her\nback to us, leaned a little on the balustrade and looked at the gardens;\nthe gentleman close to her, with the same support, offered us the face\nof Guy Brissenden, as recognisable at a distance as the numbered card of\na \"turn\"--the black figure upon white--at a music-hall. On seeing us he\nsaid a word to his companion, who quickly jerked round. Then his wife\nexclaimed to me--only with more sharpness--as she had exclaimed at Mme.\nde Dreuil: \"By all that's lovely--May Server!\" I took it, on the spot,\nfor a kind of \"Eureka!\" but without catching my friend's idea. I was\nonly aware at first that this idea left me as unconvinced as when the\nother possibilities had passed before us. Wasn't it simply the result of\nthis lady's being the only one we had happened not to eliminate? She had\nnot even occurred to us. She was pretty enough perhaps for any magic,\nbut she hadn't the other signs. I didn't believe, somehow--certainly not\non such short notice--either in her happiness or in her flatness. There\nwas a vague suggestion, of a sort, in our having found her there with\nBrissenden: there would have been a pertinence, to our curiosity, or at\nleast to mine, in this juxtaposition of the two persons who paid, as I\nhad amused myself with calling it, so heroically; yet I had only to have\nit marked for me (to see them, that is, side by side,) in order to feel\nhow little--at any rate superficially--the graceful, natural, charming\nwoman ranged herself with the superannuated youth.\n\nShe had said a word to him at sight of us, in answer to his own, and in\na minute or two they had met us. This had given me time for more than\none reflection. It had also given Mrs. Brissenden time to insist to me\non her identification, which I could see she would be much less quick to\ndrop than in the former cases. \"We have her,\" she murmured; \"we have\nher; it's _she_!\" It was by her insistence in fact that my thought was\nquickened. It even felt a kind of chill--an odd revulsion--at the touch\nof her eagerness. Singular perhaps that only then--yet quite certainly\nthen--the curiosity to which I had so freely surrendered myself began to\nstrike me as wanting in taste. It was reflected in Mrs. Brissenden quite\nby my fault, and I can't say just what cause for shame, after so much\ntalk of our search and our scent, I found in our awakened and confirmed\nkeenness. Why in the world hadn't I found it before? My scruple, in\nshort, was a thing of the instant; it was in a positive flash that the\namusing question was stamped for me as none of my business. One of the\nreflections I have just mentioned was that I had not had a happy hand in\nmaking it so completely Mrs. Brissenden's. Another was, however, that\nnothing, fortunately, that had happened between us really signified. For\nwhat had so suddenly overtaken me was the consciousness of this anomaly:\nthat I was at the same time as disgusted as if I had exposed Mrs. Server\nand absolutely convinced that I had yet _not_ exposed her.\n\nWhile, after the others had greeted us and we stood in vague talk, I\ncaught afresh the effect of their juxtaposition, I grasped, with a\nprivate joy that was quite extravagant--as so beyond the needed mark--at\nthe reassurance it offered. This reassurance sprang straight from a\nspecial source. Brissenden's secret was so aware of itself as to be\nalways on the defensive. Shy and suspicious, it was as much on the\ndefensive at present as I had felt it to be--so far as I was\nconcerned--the night before. What was there accordingly in Mrs.\nServer--frank and fragrant in the morning air--to correspond to any such\nconsciousness? Nothing whatever--not a symptom. Whatever secrets she\nmight have had, she had not _that_ one; she was not in the same box; the\nsacred fount, in her, was not threatened with exhaustion. We all soon\nre-entered the house together, but Mrs. Brissenden, during the few\nminutes that followed, managed to possess herself of the subject of her\ndenunciation. She put me off with Guy, and I couldn't help feeling it as\na sign of her concentration. She warmed to the question just as I had\nthrown it over; and I asked myself rather ruefully what on earth I had\nbeen thinking of. I hadn't in the least had it in mind to \"compromise\"\nan individual; but an individual would be compromised if I didn't now\ntake care.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nI have said that I did many things on this wonderful day, but perhaps\nthe simplest way to describe the rest of them is as a sustained attempt\nto avert that disaster. I succeeded, by vigilance, in preventing my late\ncompanion from carrying Mrs. Server off: I had no wish to see her\nstudied--by anyone but myself at least--in the light of my theory. I\nfelt by this time that I understood my theory, but I was not obliged to\nbelieve that Mrs. Brissenden did. I am afraid I must frankly confess\nthat I called deception to my aid; to separate the two ladies I gave the\nmore initiated a look in which I invited her to read volumes. This look,\nor rather the look she returned, comes back to me as the first note of a\ntolerably tight, tense little drama, a little drama of which our\nremaining hours at Newmarch were the all too ample stage. She understood\nme, as I meant, that she had better leave me to get at the truth--owing\nme some obligation, as she did, for so much of it as I had already\ncommunicated. This step was of course a tacit pledge that she should\nhave the rest from me later on. I knew of some pictures in one of the\nrooms that had not been lighted the previous evening, and I made these\nmy pretext for the effect I desired. I asked Mrs. Server if she wouldn't\ncome and see them with me, admitting at the same time that I could\nscarce expect her to forgive me for my share in the invasion of the\nquiet corner in which poor Briss had evidently managed so to interest\nher.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she replied as we went our way, \"he _had_ managed to interest\nme. Isn't he curiously interesting? But I hadn't,\" she continued on my\nbeing too struck with her question for an immediate answer--\"I hadn't\nmanaged to interest _him_. Of course you know why!\" she laughed. \"No one\ninterests him but Lady John, and he could think of nothing, while I kept\nhim there, but of how soon he could return to her.\"\n\nThese remarks--of which I give rather the sense than the form, for they\nwere a little scattered and troubled, and I helped them out and pieced\nthem together--these remarks had for me, I was to find, unexpected\nsuggestions, not all of which was I prepared on the spot to take up.\n\"And is Lady John interested in our friend?\"\n\n\"Not, I suppose, given her situation, so much as he would perhaps\ndesire. You don't know what her situation _is_?\" she went on while I\ndoubtless appeared to be sunk in innocence. \"Isn't it rather marked that\nthere's only one person she's interested in?\"\n\n\"One person?\" I was thoroughly at sea.\n\nBut we had reached with it the great pictured saloon with which I had\nproposed to assist her to renew acquaintance and in which two visitors\nhad anticipated us. \"Why, here he is!\" she exclaimed as we paused, for\nadmiration, in the doorway. The high frescoed ceiling arched over a\nfloor so highly polished that it seemed to reflect the faded pastels\nset, in rococo borders, in the walls and constituting the distinction of\nthe place. Our companions, examining together one of the portraits and\nturning their backs, were at the opposite end, and one of them was\nGilbert Long.\n\nI immediately named the other. \"Do you mean Ford Obert?\"\n\nShe gave me, with a laugh, one of her beautiful looks. \"Yes!\"\n\nIt was answer enough for the moment, and the manner of it showed me to\nwhat legend she was committed. I asked myself, while the two men faced\nabout to meet us, why she was committed to it, and I further considered\nthat if Grace Brissenden, against every appearance, was right, there\nwould now be something for me to see. Which of the two--the agent or the\nobject of the sacrifice--would take most precautions? I kept my\ncompanion purposely, for a little while, on our side of the room,\nleaving the others, interested in their observations, to take their time\nto join us. It gave me occasion to wonder if the question mightn't be\ncleared up on the spot. There _was_ no question, I had compunctiously\nmade up my mind, for Mrs. Server; but now I should see the proof of that\nconclusion. The proof of it would be, between her and her imputed lover,\nthe absence of anything that was not perfectly natural. Mrs. Server,\nwith her eyes raised to the painted dome, with response charmed almost\nto solemnity in her exquisite face, struck me at this moment, I had to\nconcede, as more than ever a person to have a lover imputed. The place,\nsave for its pictures of later date, a triumph of the florid decoration\nof two centuries ago, evidently met her special taste, and a kind of\nprofane piety had dropped on her, drizzling down, in the cold light, in\nsilver, in crystal, in faint, mixed delicacies of colour, almost as on a\npilgrim at a shrine. I don't know what it was in her--save, that is, the\npositive pitch of delicacy in her beauty--that made her, so impressed\nand presented, indescribably touching. She was like an awestruck child;\nshe might have been herself--all Greuze tints, all pale pinks and blues\nand pearly whites and candid eyes--an old dead pastel under glass.\n\nShe was not too reduced to this state, however, not to take, soon\nenough, her own precaution--if a precaution it was to be deemed. I was\nacutely conscious that the naturalness to which I have just alluded\nwould be, for either party, the only precaution worth speaking of. We\nmoved slowly round the room, pausing here and there for curiosity;\nduring which time the two men remained where we had found them. She had\nbegun at last to watch them and had proposed that we should see in what\nthey were so absorbed; but I checked her in the movement, raising my\nhand in a friendly admonition to wait. We waited then, face to face,\nlooking at each other as if to catch a strain of music. This was what I\nhad intended, for it had just come to me that one of the voices was in\nthe air and that it had imposed close attention. The distinguished\npainter listened while--to all appearance--Gilbert Long did, in the\npresence of the picture, the explaining. Ford Obert moved, after a\nlittle, but not so as to interrupt--only so as to show me his face in a\nrecall of what had passed between us the night before in the\nsmoking-room. I turned my eyes from Mrs. Server's; I allowed myself to\ncommune a little, across the shining space, with those of our\nfellow-auditor. The occasion had thus for a minute the oddest little air\nof an aesthetic lecture prompted by accidental, but immense, suggestions\nand delivered by Gilbert Long.\n\nI couldn't, at the distance, with my companion, quite follow it, but\nObert was clearly patient enough to betray that he was struck. His\nimpression was at any rate doubtless his share of surprise at Long's\ngift of talk. This was what his eyes indeed most seemed to throw over\nto me--\"What an unexpected demon of a critic!\" It was extraordinarily\ninteresting--I don't mean the special drift of Long's eloquence, which I\ncouldn't, as I say, catch; but the phenomenon of his, of all people,\ndealing in that article. It put before me the question of whether, in\nthese strange relations that I believed I had thus got my glimpse of,\nthe action of the person \"sacrificed\" mightn't be quite out of\nproportion to the resources of that person. It was as if these elements\nmight really multiply in the transfer made of them; as if the borrower\npractically found himself--or herself--in possession of a greater sum\nthan the known property of the creditor. The surrender, in this way,\nadded, by pure beauty, to the thing surrendered. We all know the French\nadage about that _plus belle fille du monde_ who can give but what she\nhas; yet if Mrs. Server, for instance, _had_ been the heroine of this\nparticular connection, the communication of her intelligence to her\nfriend would quite have falsified it. She would have given much more\nthan she had.\n\nWhen Long had finished his demonstration and his charged voice had\ndropped, we crossed to claim acquaintance with the work that had\ninspired him. The place had not been completely new to Mrs. Server any\nmore than to myself, and the impression now made on her was but the\nintenser vibration of a chord already stirred; nevertheless I was\nstruck with her saying, as a result of more remembrance than I had\nattributed to her \"Oh yes,--the man with the mask in his hand!\" On our\njoining the others I expressed regret at our having turned up too late\nfor the ideas that, on a theme so promising, they would have been sure\nto produce, and Obert, quite agreeing that we had lost a treat, said\nfrankly, in reference to Long, but addressing himself more especially to\nMrs. Server: \"He's perfectly amazing, you know--he's perfectly amazing!\"\n\nI observed that as a consequence of this Long looked neither at Mrs.\nServer nor at Obert; he looked only at me, and with quite a penetrable\nshade of shyness. Then again a strange thing happened, a stranger thing\neven than my quick sense, the previous afternoon at the station, that he\nwas a changed man. It was as if he were still more changed--had altered\nas much since the evening before as during the so much longer interval\nof which I had originally to take account. He had altered almost like\nGrace Brissenden--he looked fairly distinguished. I said to myself that,\nwithout his stature and certain signs in his dress, I should probably\nnot have placed him. Engrossed an instant with this view and with not\nlosing touch of the uneasiness that I conceived I had fastened on him, I\nbecame aware only after she had spoken that Mrs. Server had gaily and\ngracefully asked of Obert why in the world so clever a man should _not_\nhave been clever. \"Obert,\" I accordingly took upon myself to remark,\n\"had evidently laboured under some extraordinary delusion. He must\nliterally have doubted if Long _was_ clever.\"\n\n\"Fancy!\" Mrs. Server explained with a charming smile at Long, who, still\nlooking pleasantly competent and not too fatuous, amiably returned it.\n\n\"They're natural, they're natural,\" I privately reflected; \"that is,\nhe's natural to _her_, but he's not so to me.\" And as if seeing depths\nin this, and to try it, I appealed to him. \"Do, my dear man, let us have\nit again. It's the picture, of all pictures, that most needs an\ninterpreter. _Don't_ we want,\" I asked of Mrs. Server, \"to know what it\nmeans?\" The figure represented is a young man in black--a quaint, tight\nblack dress, fashioned in years long past; with a pale, lean, livid face\nand a stare, from eyes without eyebrows, like that of some whitened\nold-world clown. In his hand he holds an object that strikes the\nspectator at first simply as some obscure, some ambiguous work of art,\nbut that on a second view becomes a representation of a human face,\nmodelled and coloured, in wax, in enamelled metal, in some substance not\nhuman. The object thus appears a complete mask, such as might have been\nfantastically fitted and worn.\n\n\"Yes, what in the world does it mean?\" Mrs. Server replied. \"One could\ncall it--though that doesn't get one much further--the Mask of Death.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" I demanded while we all again looked at the picture. \"Isn't it\nmuch rather the Mask of Life? It's the man's own face that's Death. The\nother one, blooming and beautiful----\"\n\n\"Ah, but with an awful grimace!\" Mrs. Server broke in.\n\n\"The other one, blooming and beautiful,\" I repeated, \"is Life, and he's\ngoing to put it on; unless indeed he has just taken it off.\"\n\n\"He's dreadful, he's awful--that's what I mean,\" said Mrs. Server. \"But\nwhat does Mr. Long think?\"\n\n\"The artificial face, on the other hand,\" I went on, as Long now said\nnothing, \"is extremely studied and, when you carefully look at it,\ncharmingly pretty. I don't see the grimace.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything else!\" Mrs. Server good-humouredly insisted. \"And\nwhat does Mr. Obert think?\"\n\nHe kept his eyes on her a moment before replying. \"He thinks it looks\nlike a lovely lady.\"\n\n\"That grinning mask? What lovely lady?\"\n\n\"It does,\" I declared to him, really seeing what he meant--\"it does look\nremarkably like Mrs. Server.\"\n\nShe laughed, but forgivingly. \"I'm immensely obliged. You deserve,\" she\ncontinued to me, \"that I should say the gentleman's own face is the\nimage of a certain other gentleman's.\"\n\n\"It isn't the image of yours,\" Obert said to me, fitting the cap, \"but\nit's a funny thing that it should really recall to one some face among\nus here, on this occasion--I mean some face in our party--that I can't\nthink of.\" We had our eyes again on the ominous figure. \"We've seen him\nyesterday--we've seen him already this morning.\" Obert, oddly enough,\nstill couldn't catch it. \"Who the deuce is it?\"\n\n\"I know,\" I returned after a moment--our friend's reference having\nagain, in a flash, become illuminating. \"But nothing would induce me to\ntell.\"\n\n\"If _I_ were the flattered individual,\" Long observed, speaking for the\nfirst time, \"I've an idea that you'd give me the benefit of the\ncompliment. Therefore it's probably not me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not you in the least,\" Mrs. Server blandly took upon herself\nto observe. \"This face is so bad----\"\n\n\"And mine is so good?\" our companion laughed. \"Thank you for saving me!\"\n\nI watched them look at each other, for there had been as yet between\nthem no complete exchange. Yes, they were natural. I couldn't have made\nit out that they were not. But there was something, all the same, that\nI wanted to know, and I put it immediately to Long. \"Why do you bring\nagainst me such an accusation?\"\n\nHe met the question--singularly enough--as if his readiness had suddenly\ndeserted him. \"I don't know!\"--and he turned off to another picture.\n\nIt left the three of us all the more confronted with the conundrum\nlaunched by Obert, and Mrs. Server's curiosity remained. \"_Do_ name,\"\nshe said to me, \"the flattered individual.\"\n\n\"No, it's a responsibility I leave to Obert.\"\n\nBut he was clearly still at fault; he was like a man desiring, but\nunable, to sneeze. \"I see the fellow--yet I don't. Never mind.\" He\nturned away too. \"He'll come to me.\"\n\n\"The resemblance,\" said Long, on this, at a distance from us and not\nturning, \"the resemblance, which I shouldn't think would puzzle anyone,\nis simply to 'poor Briss'!\"\n\n\"Oh, of course!\"--and Obert gave a jump round.\n\n\"Ah--I do see it,\" Mrs. Server conceded with her head on one side, but\nas if speaking rather for harmony.\n\nI didn't believe she saw it, but that only made her the more natural;\nwhich was also the air she had on going to join Long, in his new\ncontemplation, after I had admitted that it was of Brissenden I myself\nhad thought. Obert and I remained together in the presence of the Man\nwith the Mask, and, the others being out of earshot, he reminded me that\nI had promised him the night before in the smoking-room to give him\nto-day the knowledge I had then withheld. If I had announced that I was\non the track of a discovery, pray had I made it yet, and what was it, at\nany rate, that I proposed to discover? I felt now, in truth, more\nuncomfortable than I had expected in being kept to my obligation, and I\nbeat about the bush a little till, instead of meeting it, I was able to\nput the natural question: \"What wonderful things was Long just saying to\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, characteristic ones enough--whimsical, fanciful, funny. The things\nhe says, you know.\"\n\nIt was indeed a fresh view. \"They strike you as characteristic?\"\n\n\"Of the man himself and his type of mind? Surely. Don't _you_? He talks\nto talk, but he's really amusing.\"\n\nI was watching our companions. \"Indeed he is--extraordinarily amusing.\"\nIt was highly interesting to me to hear at last of Long's \"type of\nmind.\" \"See how amusing he is at the present moment to Mrs. Server.\"\n\nObert took this in; she was convulsed, in the extravagance always so\npretty as to be pardonable, with laughter, and she even looked over at\nus as if to intimate with her shining, lingering eyes that we wouldn't\nbe surprised at her transports if we suspected what her entertainer,\nwhom she had never known for such a humourist, was saying. Instead of\ngoing to find out, all the same, we remained another minute together. It\nwas for me, now, I could see, that Obert had his best attention. \"What's\nthe matter with them?\"\n\nIt startled me almost as much as if he had asked me what was the matter\nwith myself--for that something _was_, under this head, I was by this\ntime unable to ignore. Not twenty minutes had elapsed since our meeting\nwith Mrs. Server on the terrace had determined Grace Brissenden's\nelation, but it was a fact that my nervousness had taken an\nextraordinary stride. I had perhaps not till this instant been fully\naware of it--it was really brought out by the way Obert looked at me as\nif he fancied he had heard me shake. Mrs. Server might be natural, and\nGilbert Long might be, but I should not preserve that calm unless I\npulled myself well together. I made the effort, facing my sharp\ninterlocutor; and I think it was at this point that I fully measured my\ndismay. I had grown--that was what was the matter with me--precipitately,\npreposterously anxious. Instead of dropping, the discomfort produced in\nme by Mrs. Brissenden had deepened to agitation, and this in spite of\nthe fact that in the brief interval nothing worse, nothing but what was\nright, had happened. Had I myself suddenly fallen so much in love with\nMrs. Server that the care for her reputation had become with me an\nobsession? It was of no use saying I simply pitied her: what did I pity\nher for if she wasn't in danger? She _was_ in danger: that rushed over\nme at present--rushed over me while I tried to look easy and delayed to\nanswer my friend. She _was_ in danger--if only because she had caught\nand held the search-light of Obert's attention. I took up his inquiry.\n\"The matter with them? I don't know anything but that they're young and\nhandsome and happy--children, as who should say, of the world; children\nof leisure and pleasure and privilege.\"\n\nObert's eyes went back to them. \"Do you remember what I said to you\nabout her yesterday afternoon? She darts from flower to flower, but she\nclings, for the time, to each. You've been feeling, I judge, the force\nof my remark.\"\n\n\"Oh, she didn't at all 'dart,'\" I replied, \"just now at me. I darted,\nmuch rather, at _her_.\"\n\n\"Long didn't, then,\" Obert said, still with his eyes on them.\n\nI had to wait a moment. \"Do you mean he struck you as avoiding her?\"\n\nHe in turn considered. \"He struck me as having noticed with what\nintensity, ever since we came down, she has kept alighting. She\ninaugurated it, the instant she arrived, with _me_, and every man of us\nhas had his turn. I dare say it's only fair, certainly, that Long should\nhave.\"\n\n\"He's lucky to get it, the brute! She's as charming as she can possibly\nbe.\"\n\n\"That's it, precisely; and it's what no woman ought to be--as charming\nas she possibly can!--more than once or twice in her life. This lady is\nso every blessed minute, and to every blessed male. It's as if she were\ntoo awfully afraid one wouldn't take it in. If she but knew how one\ndoes! However,\" my friend continued, \"you'll recollect that we differed\nabout her yesterday--and what does it signify? One should of course bear\nlightly on anything so light. But I stick to it that she's different.\"\n\nI pondered. \"Different from whom?\"\n\n\"Different from herself--as she was when I painted her. There's\nsomething the matter with her.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, it's for me to ask _you_ what. I don't myself, you see,\nperceive it.\"\n\nHe made for a little no answer, and we were both indeed by this time\ntaken up with the withdrawal of the two other members of our group. They\nmoved away together across the shining floor, pausing, looking up at the\npainted vault, saying the inevitable things--bringing off their retreat,\nin short, in the best order. It struck me somehow as a retreat, and yet\nI insisted to myself, once more, on its being perfectly natural. At the\nhigh door, which stood open, they stopped a moment and looked back at\nus--looked frankly, sociably, as if in consciousness of our sympathetic\nattention. Mrs. Server waved, as in temporary farewell, a free\nexplanatory hand at me; she seemed to explain that she was now trying\nsomebody else. Obert moreover added _his_ explanation. \"That's the way\nshe collars us.\"\n\n\"Oh, Long doesn't mind,\" I said. \"But what's the way she strikes you as\ndifferent?\"\n\n\"From what she was when she sat to me? Well, a part of it is that she\ncan't keep still. She was as still then as if she had been paid for it.\nNow she's all over the place.\" But he came back to something else. \"I\nlike your talking, my dear man, of what you 'don't perceive.' I've yet\nto find out what that remarkable quantity is. What you do perceive has\nat all events given me so much to think about that it doubtless ought to\nserve me for the present. I feel I ought to let you know that you've\nmade me also perceive the Brissendens.\" I of course remembered what I\nhad said to him, but it was just this that now touched my uneasiness,\nand I only echoed the name, a little blankly, with the instinct of\ngaining time. \"You put me on them wonderfully,\" Obert continued, \"though\nof course I've kept your idea to myself. All the same it sheds a great\nlight.\"\n\nI could again but feebly repeat it. \"A great light?\"\n\n\"As to what may go on even between others still. It's a jolly idea--a\ntorch in the darkness; and do you know what I've done with it? I've held\nit up, I don't mind telling you, to just the question of the change,\nsince this interests you, in Mrs. Server. If you've got your mystery\nI'll be hanged if I won't have mine. If you've got your Brissendens I\nshall see what I can do with _her_. You've given me an analogy, and I\ndeclare I find it dazzling. I don't see the end of what may be done with\nit. If Brissenden's paying for his wife, for her amazing second bloom,\nwho's paying for Mrs. Server? Isn't _that_--what do the newspapers call\nit?--the missing word? Isn't it perhaps in fact just what you told me\nlast night you were on the track of? But don't add now,\" he went on,\nmore and more amused with his divination, \"don't add now that the man's\nobviously Gilbert Long--for I won't be put off with anything of the\nsort. She collared him much too markedly. The real man must be one she\ndoesn't markedly collar.\"\n\n\"But I thought that what you a moment ago made out was that she so\nmarkedly collars all of us.\" This was my immediate reply to Obert's\nblaze of ingenuity, but I none the less saw more things in it than I\ncould reply to. I saw, at any rate, and saw with relief, that if he\nshould look on the principle suggested to him by the case of the\nBrissendens, there would be no danger at all of his finding it. If,\naccordingly, I was nervous for Mrs. Server, all I had to do was to keep\nhim on this false scent. Since it was not she who was paid for, but she\nwho possibly paid, his fancy might harmlessly divert him till the party\nshould disperse. At the same time, in the midst of these reflections,\nthe question of the \"change\" in her, which he was in so much better a\nposition than I to measure, couldn't help having for me its portent, and\nthe sense of that was, no doubt, in my next words. \"What makes you think\nthat what you speak of was what I had in my head?\"\n\n\"Well, the way, simply, that the shoe fits. She's absolutely not the\nsame person I painted. It's exactly like Mrs. Brissenden's having been\nfor you yesterday not the same person you had last seen bearing her\nname.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" I returned, \"though I didn't in the least mean to set you\ndigging so hard. However, dig on your side, by all means, while I dig on\nmine. All I ask of you is complete discretion.\"\n\n\"Ah, naturally!\"\n\n\"We ought to remember,\" I pursued, even at the risk of showing as too\nsententious, \"that success in such an inquiry may perhaps be more\nembarrassing than failure. To nose about for a relation that a lady has\nher reasons for keeping secret----\"\n\n\"Is made not only quite inoffensive, I hold\"--he immediately took me\nup--\"but positively honourable, by being confined to psychologic\nevidence.\"\n\nI wondered a little. \"Honourable to whom?\"\n\n\"Why, to the investigator. Resting on the _kind_ of signs that the game\ntakes account of when fairly played--resting on psychologic signs alone,\nit's a high application of intelligence. What's ignoble is the detective\nand the keyhole.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I after a moment admitted. \"I did have, last night, my\nscruples, but you warm me up. Yet I confess also,\" I still added, \"that\nif I do muster the courage of my curiosity, it's a little because I feel\neven yet, as I think you also must, altogether destitute of a material\nclue. If I had a material clue I should feel ashamed: the fact would be\ndeterrent. I start, for my part, at any rate, quite in the dark--or in a\ndarkness lighted, at best, by what you have called the torch of my\nanalogy. The analogy too,\" I wound up, \"may very well be only half a\nhelp. It was easy to find poor Briss, because poor Briss is here, and\nit's always easy, moreover, to find a husband. But say Mrs. Server's\npoor Briss--or his equivalent, whoever it may be--_isn't_ here.\"\n\nWe had begun to walk away with this, but my companion pulled up at the\ndoor of the room. \"I'm sure he is. She tells me he's near.\"\n\n\"'Tells' you?\" I challenged it, but I uncomfortably reflected that it\nwas just what I had myself told Mrs. Brissenden.\n\n\"She wouldn't be as she is if he weren't. Her being as she is is the\nsign of it. He wasn't present--that is he wasn't present in her life at\nall--when I painted her; and the difference we're impressed with is\nexactly the proof that he is now.\"\n\nMy difficulty in profiting by the relief he had so unconsciously\nafforded me resided of course in my not feeling free to show for quite\nas impressed as he was. I hadn't really made out at all what he was\nimpressed _with_, and I should only have spoiled everything by inviting\nhim to be definite. This was a little of a worry, for I should have\nliked to know; but on the other hand I felt my track at present\neffectually covered. \"Well, then, grant he's one of us. There are more\nthan a dozen of us--a dozen even with you and me and Brissenden counted\nout. The hitch is that we're nowhere without a primary lead. As to\nBrissenden there _was_ the lead.\"\n\n\"You mean as afforded by his wife's bloated state, which was a\nsignal----?\"\n\n\"Precisely: for the search for something or other that would help to\nexplain it. Given his wife's bloated state, his own shrunken one was\nwhat was to have been predicated. I knew definitely, in other words,\nwhat to look for.\"\n\n\"Whereas we don't know here?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Server's state, unfortunately,\" I replied, \"is not bloated.\"\n\nHe laughed at my \"unfortunately,\" though recognising that I spoke merely\nfrom the point of view of lucidity, and presently remarked that he had\nhis own idea. He didn't say what it was, and I didn't ask, intimating\nthereby that I held it to be in this manner we were playing the game;\nbut I indulgently questioned it in the light of its not yet having\nassisted him. He answered that the minutes we had just passed were what\nhad made the difference; it had sprung from the strong effect produced\non him after she came in with me. \"It's but now I really see her. She\ndid and said nothing special, nothing striking or extraordinary; but\nthat didn't matter--it never does: one saw how she _is_. She's nothing\nbut _that_.\"\n\n\"Nothing but what?\"\n\n\"She's all _in_ it,\" he insisted. \"Or it's all in _her_. It comes to the\nsame thing.\"\n\n\"Of course it's all in her,\" I said as impatiently as I could, though\nhis attestation--for I wholly trusted his perception--left me so much in\nhis debt. \"That's what we start with, isn't it? It leaves us as far as\never from what we must arrive at.\"\n\nBut he was too interested in his idea to heed my question. He was\nwrapped in the \"psychologic\" glow. \"I _have_ her!\"\n\n\"Ah, but it's a question of having _him_!\"\n\nHe looked at me on this as if I had brought him back to a mere detail,\nand after an instant the light went out of his face. \"So it is. I leave\nit to you. I don't care.\" His drop had the usual suddenness of the drops\nof the artistic temperament. \"Look for the last man,\" he nevertheless,\nbut with more detachment, added. \"I daresay it would be he.\"\n\n\"The last? In what sense the last?\"\n\n\"Well, the last sort of creature who could be believed of her.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I rejoined as we went on, \"the great bar to that is that such a\nsort of creature as the last won't _be_ here!\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"So much the better. I give him, at any rate, wherever he\nis, up to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I returned, \"for the beauty of the present! You do see,\nthen, that our psychologic glow doesn't, after all, prevent the\nthing----\"\n\n\"From being none of one's business? Yes. Poor little woman!\" He seemed\nsomehow satisfied; he threw it all up. \"It isn't any of one's business,\nis it?\"\n\n\"Why, that's what I was telling you,\" I impatiently exclaimed, \"that _I_\nfeel!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe first thing that happened to me after parting with him was to find\nmyself again engaged with Mrs. Brissenden, still full of the quick\nconviction with which I had left her. \"It _is_ she--quite unmistakably,\nyou know. I don't see how I can have been so stupid as not to make it\nout. I haven't your cleverness, of course, till my nose is rubbed into a\nthing. But when it _is_--!\" She celebrated her humility in a laugh that\nwas proud. \"The two are off together.\"\n\n\"Off where?\"\n\n\"I don't know where, but I saw them a few minutes ago most distinctly\n'slope.' They've gone for a quiet, unwatched hour, poor dears, out into\nthe park or the gardens. When one knows it, it's all there. But what's\nthat vulgar song?--'You've got to know it first!' It strikes me, if you\ndon't mind my telling you so, that the way _you_ get hold of things is\npositively uncanny. I mean as regards what first marked her for you.\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady,\" I protested, \"nothing at all first marked her for\nme. She _isn't_ marked for me, first or last. It was only you who so\njumped at her.\"\n\nMy interlocutress stared, and I had at this moment, I remember, an\nalmost intolerable sense of her fatuity and cruelty. They were all\nunconscious, but they were, at that stage, none the less irritating. Her\nfine bosom heaved, her blue eyes expanded with her successful, her\nsimplified egotism. I couldn't, in short, I found, bear her being so\nkeen about Mrs. Server while she was so stupid about poor Briss. She\nseemed to recall to me nobly the fact that _she_ hadn't a lover. No, she\nwas only eating poor Briss up inch by inch, but she hadn't a lover. \"I\ndon't,\" I insisted, \"see in Mrs. Server any of the right signs.\"\n\nShe looked almost indignant. \"Even after your telling me that you see in\nLady John only the wrong ones?\"\n\n\"Ah, but there are other women here than Mrs. Server and Lady John.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But didn't we, a moment ago, think of them all and dismiss\nthem? If Lady John's out of the question, how can Mrs. Server possibly\n_not_ be in it? We want a fool----\"\n\n\"Ah, _do_ we?\" I interruptingly wailed.\n\n\"Why, exactly by your own theory, in which you've so much interested me!\nIt was you who struck off the idea.\"\n\n\"That we want a fool?\" I felt myself turning gloomy enough. \"Do we\nreally want anyone at all?\"\n\nShe gave me, in momentary silence, a strange smile. \"Ah, you want to\ntake it back now? You're sorry you spoke. My dear man, you may be----\"\nbut that didn't hinder the fact, in short, that I had kindled near me a\nfine, if modest and timid, intelligence. There did remain the truth of\nour friend's striking development, to which I had called her attention.\nRegretting my rashness didn't make the prodigy less. \"You'll lead me to\nbelieve, if you back out, that there's suddenly someone you want to\nprotect. Weak man,\" she exclaimed with an assurance from which, I\nconfess, I was to take alarm, \"something has happened to you since we\nseparated! Weak man,\" she repeated with dreadful gaiety, \"you've been\nsquared!\"\n\nI literally blushed for her. \"Squared?\"\n\n\"Does it inconveniently happen that you find you're in love with her\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied on quick reflection, \"do, if you like, call it that;\nfor you see what a motive it gives me for being, in such a matter as\nthis wonderful one that you and I happened to find ourselves for a\nmoment making so free with, absolutely sure about her. I _am_ absolutely\nsure. There! She won't do. And for your postulate that she's at the\npresent moment in some sequestered spot in Long's company, suffer me\nwithout delay to correct it. It won't hold water. If you'll go into the\nlibrary, through which I have just passed, you'll find her there in the\ncompany of the Comte de Dreuil.\"\n\nMrs. Briss stared again. \"Already? She _was_, at any rate, with Mr.\nLong, and she told me on my meeting them that they had just come from\nthe pastels.\"\n\n\"Exactly. They met there--she and I having gone together; and they\nretired together under my eyes. They must have parted, clearly, the\nmoment after.\"\n\nShe took it all in, turned it all over. \"Then what does that prove but\nthat they're afraid to be seen?\"\n\n\"Ah, they're _not_ afraid, since both you and I saw them!\"\n\n\"Oh, only just long enough for them to publish themselves as not\navoiding each other. All the same, you know,\" she said, \"they do.\"\n\n\"Do avoid each other? How is your belief in that,\" I asked, \"consistent\nwith your belief that they parade together in the park?\"\n\n\"They ignore each other in public; they foregather in private.\"\n\n\"Ah, but they _don't_--since, as I tell you, she's even while we talk\nthe centre of the mystic circle of the twaddle of M. de Dreuil; chained\nto a stake if you _can_ be. Besides,\" I wound up, \"it's not only that\nshe's not the 'right fool'--it's simply that she's not a fool at all.\nWe want the woman who has been rendered most inane. But this lady hasn't\nbeen rendered so in any degree. She's the reverse of inane. She's in\nfull possession.\"\n\n\"In full possession of what?\"\n\n\"Why, of herself.\"\n\n\"Like Lady John?\"\n\nI had unfortunately to discriminate here. \"No, not like Lady John.\"\n\n\"Like whom then?\"\n\n\"Like anyone. Like me; like you; like Brissenden. Don't I satisfy you?\"\nI asked in a moment.\n\nShe only looked at me a little, handsome and hard. \"If you wished to\nsatisfy me so easily you shouldn't have made such a point of working me\nup. I daresay I, after all, however,\" she added, \"notice more things\nthan you.\"\n\n\"As for instance?\"\n\n\"Well, May Server last evening. I was not quite conscious at the time\nthat I did, but when one has had the 'tip' one looks back and sees\nthings in a new light.\"\n\nIt was doubtless because my friend irritated me more and more that I met\nthis with a sharpness possibly excessive. \"She's perfectly natural. What\nI saw was a test. And so is he.\"\n\nBut she gave me no heed. \"If there hadn't been so many people I should\nhave noticed of myself after dinner that there was something the matter\nwith her. I should have seen what it was. She was all over the place.\"\n\nShe expressed it as the poor lady's other critic had done, but this\ndidn't shut my mouth. \"Ah, then, in spite of the people, you did notice.\nWhat do you mean by 'all over the place'?\"\n\n\"She couldn't keep still. She was different from the woman one had last\nseen. She used to be so calm--as if she were always sitting for her\nportrait. Wasn't she in fact always being painted in a pink frock and\none row of pearls, always staring out at you in exhibitions, as if she\nwere saying 'Here they are again'? Last night she was on the rush.\"\n\n\"The rush? Oh!\"\n\n\"Yes, positively--from one man to another. She was on the pounce. She\ntalked to ten in succession, making up to them in the most extraordinary\nway and leaving them still more crazily. She's as nervous as a cat. Put\nit to any man here, and see if he doesn't tell you.\"\n\n\"I should think it quite unpleasant to put it to any man here,\" I\nreturned; \"and I should have been sure you would have thought it the\nsame. I spoke to you in the deepest confidence.\"\n\nMrs. Brissenden's look at me was for a moment of the least\naccommodating; then it changed to an intelligent smile. \"How you _are_\nprotecting her! But don't cry out,\" she added, \"before you're hurt.\nSince your confidence has distinguished me--though I don't quite see\nwhy--you may be sure I haven't breathed. So I all the more resent your\nmaking me a scene on the extraordinary ground that I've observed as well\nas yourself. Perhaps what you don't like is that my observation may be\nturned on _you_. I confess it is.\"\n\nIt was difficult to bear being put in the wrong by her, but I made an\neffort that I believe was not unsuccessful to recover my good humour.\n\"It's not in the least to your observation that I object, it's to the\nextravagant inferences you draw from it. Of course, however, I admit I\nalways want to protect the innocent. What does she gain, on your theory,\nby her rushing and pouncing? Had she pounced on Brissenden when we met\nhim with her? Are you so very sure he hadn't pounced on _her_? They had,\nat all events, to me, quite the air of people settled; she was not, it\nwas clear, at that moment meditating a change. It was we, if you\nremember, who had absolutely to pull them apart.\"\n\n\"Is it your idea to make out,\" Mrs. Brissenden inquired in answer to\nthis, \"that she has suddenly had the happy thought of a passion for my\nhusband?\"\n\nA new possibility, as she spoke, came to me with a whirr of wings, and I\nhalf expressed it. \"She may have a sympathy.\"\n\nMy interlocutress gazed at space. \"You mean she may be sorry for him? On\nwhat ground?\"\n\nI had gone too far indeed; but I got off as I could. \"You neglect him\nso! But what is she, at any rate,\" I went on, \"nervous--as nervous as\nyou describe her--_about_?\"\n\n\"About her danger; the contingency of its being fixed upon them--an\nintimacy so thoroughgoing that they can scarcely afford to let it be\nseen even as a mere acquaintance. Think of the circumstances--_her_\npersonal ones, I mean, and admit that it wouldn't do. It would be too\nbad a case. There's everything to make it so. They must live on pins and\nneedles. Anything proved would go tremendously hard for her.\"\n\n\"In spite of which you're surprised that I 'protect' her?\"\n\nIt was a question, however, that my companion could meet. \"From people\nin general, no. From me in particular, yes.\"\n\nIn justice to Mrs. Brissenden I thought a moment. \"Well, then, let us be\nfair all round. That you don't, as you say, breathe is a discretion I\nappreciate; all the more that a little inquiry, tactfully pursued, would\nenable you to judge whether any independent suspicion does attach. A\nlittle loose collateral evidence _might_ be picked up; and your scorning\nto handle it is no more than I should, after all, have expected of you.\"\n\n\"Thank you for 'after all'!\" My companion tossed her head. \"I know for\nmyself what I scorn to handle. Quite apart from that there's another\nmatter. You must have noticed yourself that when people are so much\nliked----\"\n\n\"There's a kind of general, amiable consensus of blindness? Yes--one can\nthink of cases. Popularity shelters and hallows--has the effect of\nmaking a good-natured world agree not to see.\"\n\nMy friend seemed pleased that I so sufficiently understood. \"This\nevidently has been a case then in which it has not only agreed not to\nsee, but agreed not even to look. It has agreed in fact to look straight\nthe other way. They say there's no smoke without fire, but it appears\nthere may be fire without smoke. I'm satisfied, at all events, that one\nwouldn't in connection with these two find the least little puff. Isn't\nthat just what makes the magnificence of their success--the success that\nreduces us to playing over them with mere moonshine?\" She thought of it;\nseemed fairly to envy it. \"I've never _seen_ such luck!\"\n\n\"A rare case of the beauty of impunity _as_ impunity?\" I laughed. \"Such\na case puts a price on passions otherwise to be deprecated? I'm glad\nindeed you admit we're 'reduced.' We _are_ reduced. But what I meant to\nsay just now was that if you'll continue to join in the genial\nconspiracy while I do the same--each of us making an exception only for\nthe other--I'll pledge myself absolutely to the straight course. If\nbefore we separate I've seen reason to change my mind, I'll loyally let\nyou know.\"\n\n\"What good will that do me,\" she asked, \"if you _don't_ change your\nmind? You won't change it if you shut your eyes to her.\"\n\n\"Ah, I feel I can't do that now. I _am_ interested. The proof of that\nis,\" I pursued, \"that I appeal to you for another impression of your\nown. I still don't see the logic of her general importunity.\"\n\n\"The logic is simply that she has a terror of appearing to encourage\nanyone in particular.\"\n\n\"Why then isn't it in her own interest, for the sake of the screen, just\nto _do_ that? The appearance of someone in particular would be exactly\nthe opposite of the appearance of Long. Your own admission is that\nthat's _his_ line with Lady John.\"\n\nMrs. Brissenden took her view. \"Oh, she doesn't want to do anything so\nlike the real thing. And, as for what he does, they don't feel in the\nsame way. He's not nervous.\"\n\n\"Then why does he go in for a screen?\"\n\n\"I mean\"--she readily modified it--\"that he's not so nervous as May. He\nhasn't the same reasons for panic. A man never has. Besides, there's not\nso much in Mr. Long to show----\"\n\n\"What, by my notion, has taken place? Why not, if it was precisely by\nthe change in him that my notion was inspired? Any change in _her_ I\nknow comparatively little about.\"\n\nWe hovered so near the case of Mr. and Mrs. Brissenden that it\npositively excited me, and all the more for her sustained\nunconsciousness. \"Oh, the man's not aware of his own change. He doesn't\nsee it as we do. It's all to his advantage.\"\n\n\"But _we_ see it to his advantage. How should that prevent?\"\n\n\"We see it to the advantage of his mind and his talk, but not to that\nof----\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" I pressed as she pulled up.\n\nShe was thinking how to name such mysteries. \"His delicacy. His\nconsideration. His thought _for_ her. He would think for her if he\nweren't selfish. But he _is_ selfish--too much so to spare her, to be\ngenerous, to realise. It's only, after all,\" she sagely went on, feeding\nme again, as I winced to feel, with profundity of my own sort, \"it's\nonly an excessive case, a case that in him happens to show as what the\ndoctors call 'fine,' of what goes on whenever two persons are so much\nmixed up. One of them always gets more out of it than the other. One of\nthem--you know the saying--gives the lips, the other gives the cheek.\"\n\n\"It's the deepest of all truths. Yet the cheek profits too,\" I more\nprudently argued.\n\n\"It profits most. It takes and keeps and uses all the lips give. The\ncheek, accordingly,\" she continued to point out, \"is Mr. Long's. The\nlips are what we began by looking for. We've found them. They're\ndrained--they're dry, the lips. Mr. Long finds his improvement natural\nand beautiful. He revels in it. He takes it for granted. He's sublime.\"\n\nIt kept me for a minute staring at her. \"So--do you know?--are _you_!\"\n\nShe received this wholly as a tribute to her acuteness, and was\ntherefore proportionately gracious. \"That's only because it's catching.\nYou've _made_ me sublime. You found me dense. You've affected me quite\nas Mrs. Server has affected Mr. Long. I don't pretend I show it,\" she\nadded, \"quite as much as he does.\"\n\n\"Because that would entail _my_ showing it as much as, by your\ncontention, _she_ does? Well, I confess,\" I declared, \"I do feel\nremarkably like that pair of lips. I feel drained--I feel dry!\" Her\nanswer to this, with another toss of her head, was extravagant enough to\nmean forgiveness--was that I was impertinent, and her action in support\nof her charge was to move away from me, taking her course again to the\nterrace, easily accessible from the room in which we had been talking.\nShe passed out of the window that opened to the ground, and I watched\nher while, in the brighter light, she put up her pink parasol. She\nwalked a few paces, as if to look about her for a change of company, and\nby this time had reached a flight of steps that descended to a lower\nlevel. On observing that here, in the act to go down, she suddenly\npaused, I knew she had been checked by something seen below and that\nthis was what made her turn the next moment to give me a look. I took it\nas an invitation to rejoin her, and I perceived when I had done so what\nhad led her to appeal to me. We commanded from the point in question one\nof the shady slopes of the park and in particular a spreading beech, the\ntrunk of which had been inclosed with a rustic circular bench, a\nconvenience that appeared to have offered, for the moment, a sense of\nleafy luxury to a lady in pale blue. She leaned back, her figure\npresented in profile and her head a little averted as if for talk with\nsome one on the other side of her, someone so placed as to be lost to\nour view.\n\n\"There!\" triumphed Mrs. Brissenden again--for the lady was unmistakably\nMrs. Server. Amusement was inevitable--the fact showed her as so\ncorrectly described by the words to which I had twice had to listen. She\nseemed really all over the place. \"I thought you said,\" my companion\nremarked, \"that you had left her tucked away somewhere with M. de\nDreuil.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I returned after consideration, \"that is obviously M. de\nDreuil.\"\n\n\"Are you so sure? I don't make out the person,\" my friend continued--\"I\nonly see she's not alone. I understood you moreover that you had lately\nleft them in the house.\"\n\n\"They _were_ in the house, but there was nothing to keep them from\ncoming out. They've had plenty of time while we've talked; they must\nhave passed down by some of the other steps. Perhaps also,\" I added,\n\"it's another man.\"\n\nBut by this time she was satisfied. \"It's _he_!\"\n\n\"Gilbert Long? I thought you just said,\" I observed, \"that you can make\nnobody out.\"\n\nWe watched together, but the distance was considerable, and the second\nfigure continued to be screened. \"It _must_ be he,\" Mrs. Brissenden\nresumed with impatience, \"since it was with him I so distinctly saw\nher.\"\n\n\"Let me once more hold you to the fact,\" I answered, \"that she had, to\nmy knowledge, succumbed to M. de Dreuil afterwards. The moments have\nfled, you see, in our fascinating discussion, and various things, on\nyour theory of her pounce, have come and gone. Don't I moreover make out\na brown shoe, in a white gaiter, protruding from the other side of her\ndress? It must be Lord Lutley.\"\n\nMrs. Brissenden looked and mused. \"A brown shoe in a white gaiter?\" At\nthis moment Mrs. Server moved, and the next--as if it were time for\nanother pounce--she had got up. We could, however, still distinguish but\na shoulder and an out-stretched leg of her gentleman, who, on her\nmovement, appeared, as in protest, to have affirmed by an emphatic shift\nof his seat his preference for their remaining as they were. This\ncarried him further round the tree. We thus lost him, but she stood\nthere while we waited, evidently exhorting him; after a minute of which\nshe came away as in confidence that he would follow. During this\nprocess, with a face more visible, she had looked as charming as a\npretty woman almost always does in rising eloquent before the apathetic\nmale. She hadn't yet noticed us, but something in her attitude and\nmanner particularly spoke to me. There were implications in it to which\nI couldn't be blind, and I felt how my neighbour also would have caught\nthem and been confirmed in her certitude. In fact I felt the breath of\nher confirmation in another elated \"There!\"--in a \"Look at her _now_!\"\nIncontestably, while not yet aware of us, Mrs. Server confessed with\nevery turn of her head to a part in a relation. It stuck out of her, her\npart in a relation; it hung before us, her part in a relation; it was\nlarge to us beyond the breadth of the glade. And since, off her guard,\nshe so let us have it, with whom in the world could the relation--so\nmuch of one as that--be but with Gilbert Long? The question was not\nsettled till she had come on some distance; then the producer of our\ntension, emerging and coming after her, offered himself to our united,\nto our confounded, anxiety once more as poor Briss.\n\nThat we should have been confounded was doubtless but a proof of the\nimpression--the singular assurance of intimacy borne toward us on the\nsoft summer air--that we had, however delusively, received. I should\nmyself have been as ready as my neighbour to say \"Whoever he is, they're\nin deep!\"--and on grounds, moreover, quite as recklessly, as\nfantastically constructive as hers. There was nothing to explain our\nimpression but the fact of our already having seen them figure together,\nand of this we needed breathing-time to give them the natural benefit.\nIt was not indeed as an absolute benefit for either that Grace\nBrissenden's tone marked our recognition. \"Dear Guy _again_?\"--but she\nhad recovered herself enough to laugh. \"I should have thought he had had\nmore than his turn!\" She had recovered herself in fact much more than I;\nfor somehow, from this instant, convinced as she had been and turning\neverything to her conviction, I found myself dealing, in thought, with\nstill larger material. It was odd what a difference was made for me by\nthe renewed sight of dear Guy. I didn't of course analyse this sense at\nthe time; that was still to come. Our friends meanwhile had noticed us,\nand something clearly passed between them--it almost produced, for an\ninstant, a visible arrest in their advance--on the question of their\nhaving perhaps been for some time exposed.\n\nThey came on, however, and I waved them from afar a greeting, to which\nMrs. Server alone replied. Distances were great at Newmarch and\nlandscape-gardening on the grand scale; it would take them still some\nminutes to reach our place of vantage or to arrive within sound of\nspeech. There was accordingly nothing marked in our turning away and\nstrolling back to the house. We had been so intent that we confessed by\nthis movement to a quick impulse to disown it. Yet it was remarkable\nthat, before we went in, Mrs. Brissenden should have struck me afresh as\nhaving got all she wanted. Her recovery from our surprise was already so\ncomplete that her high lucidity now alone reigned. \"You don't require, I\nsuppose, anything more than _that_?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't quite see, I'm bound to say, just where even 'that' comes\nin.\" It incommoded me singularly little, at the point to which I had\njumped, that this statement was the exact reverse of the truth. Where it\ncame in was what I happened to be in the very act of seeing--seeing to\nthe exclusion of almost everything else. It was sufficient that I might\nperhaps feel myself to have done at last with Mrs. Brissenden. I\ndesired, at all events, quite as if this benefit were assured me, to\nleave her the honours of the last word.\n\nShe was finely enough prepared to take them. \"Why, this invention of\nusing my husband----!\" She fairly gasped at having to explain.\n\n\"Of 'using' him?\"\n\n\"Trailing him across the scent as she does all of you, one after the\nother. Excuse my comparing you to so many red herrings. You each have\nyour turn; only _his_ seems repeated, poor dear, till he's quite worn\nout with it.\"\n\nI kept for a little this image in my eye. \"I can see of course that his\nwhole situation must be something of a strain for him; for I've not\nforgotten what you told me yesterday of his service with Lady John. To\nhave to work in such a way for two of them at once\"--it couldn't help, I\nadmitted, being a tax on a fellow. Besides, when one came to think of\nit, the same man couldn't be _two_ red herrings. To show as Mrs.\nServer's would directly impair his power to show as Lady John's. It\nwould seem, in short, a matter for his patronesses to have out together.\n\nMrs. Brissenden betrayed, on this, some annoyance at my levity. \"Oh, the\ncases are not the same, for with Lady John it amuses him: he thinks he\nknows.\"\n\n\"Knows what?\"\n\n\"What she wants him for. He doesn't know\"--she kept it wonderfully\nclear--\"that she really doesn't want him for anything; for anything\nexcept, of course\"--this came as a droll second thought--\"himself.\"\n\n\"And he doesn't know, either\"--I tried to remain at her level--\"that\nMrs. Server does.\"\n\n\"No,\" she assented, \"he doesn't know what it's her idea to do with\nhim.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know, in fine,\" I cheerfully pursued, \"the truth about\nanything. And of course, by your agreement with me, he's not to learn\nit.\"\n\nShe recognised her agreement with me, yet looked as if she had reserved\na certain measure of freedom. Then she handsomely gave up even that. \"I\ncertainly don't want him to become conscious.\"\n\n\"It's his unconsciousness,\" I declared, \"that saves him.\"\n\n\"Yes, even from himself.\"\n\n\"We must accordingly feed it.\" In the house, with intention, we parted\ncompany; but there was something that, before this, I felt it due to my\nclaim of consistency to bring out. \"It wasn't, at all events, Gilbert\nLong behind the tree!\"\n\nMy triumph, however, beneath the sponge she was prepared to pass again\nover much of our experience, was short-lived. \"Of course it wasn't. We\nshouldn't have been treated to the scene if it _had_ been. What could\nshe possibly have put poor Briss there for but just to show it wasn't?\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI saw other things, many things, after this, but I had already so much\nmatter for reflection that I saw them almost in spite of myself. The\ndifficulty with me was in the momentum already acquired by the act--as\nwell as, doubtless, by the general habit--of observation. I remember\nindeed that on separating from Mrs. Brissenden I took a lively resolve\nto get rid of my ridiculous obsession. It was absurd to have consented\nto such immersion, intellectually speaking, in the affairs of other\npeople. One had always affairs of one's own, and I was positively\nneglecting mine. Such, for a while, was my foremost reflection; after\nwhich, in their order or out of it, came an inevitable train of others.\nOne of the first of these was that, frankly, my affairs were by this\ntime pretty well used to my neglect. There were connections enough in\nwhich it had never failed. A whole cluster of such connections,\neffectually displacing the centre of interest, now surrounded me, and I\nwas--though always but intellectually--drawn into their circle. I did my\nbest for the rest of the day to turn my back on them, but with the\nprompt result of feeling that I meddled with them almost more in\nthinking them over in isolation than in hovering personally about them.\nReflection was the real intensity; reflection, as to poor Mrs. Server in\nparticular, was an indiscreet opening of doors. She became vivid in the\nlight of the so limited vision of her that I already possessed--try\npositively as I would not further to extend it. It was something not to\nask another question, to keep constantly away both from Mrs. Brissenden\nand from Ford Obert, whom I had rashly invited to a degree of\nparticipation; it was something to talk as hard as possible with other\npersons and on other subjects, to mingle in groups much more superficial\nthan they supposed themselves, to give ear to broader jokes, to discuss\nmore tangible mysteries.\n\nThe day, as it developed, was large and hot, an unstinted splendour of\nsummer; excursions, exercise, organised amusement were things admirably\nspared us; life became a mere arrested ramble or stimulated lounge, and\nwe profited to the full by the noble freedom of Newmarch, that\noverarching ease which in nothing was so marked as in the tolerance of\ntalk. The air of the place itself, in such conditions, left one's powers\nwith a sense of play; if one wanted something to play at one simply\nplayed at being there. I did this myself, with the aid, in especial, of\ntwo or three solitary strolls, unaccompanied dips, of half an hour\na-piece, into outlying parts of the house and the grounds. I must add\nthat while I resorted to such measures not to see I only fixed what I\n_had_ seen, what I did see, the more in my mind. One of these things had\nbeen the way that, at luncheon, Gilbert Long, watching the chance given\nhim by the loose order in which we moved to it, slipped, to the visible\ndefeat of somebody else, into the chair of conspicuity beside clever\nLady John. A second was that Mrs. Server then occupied a place as remote\nas possible from this couple, but not from Guy Brissenden, who had found\nmeans to seat himself next her while my notice was engaged by the\nothers. What I was at the same time supremely struck with could\ndoubtless only be Mrs. Server's bright ubiquity, as it had at last come\nto seem to me, and that of the companions she had recruited for the\noccasion. Attended constantly by a different gentleman, she was in the\nrange of my vision wherever I turned--she kept repeating her picture in\nsettings separated by such intervals that I wondered at the celerity\nwith which she proceeded from spot to spot. She was never discernibly\nout of breath, though the associate of her ecstasy at the given moment\nmight have been taken as being; and I kept getting afresh the impression\nwhich, the day before, had so promptly followed my arrival, the odd\nimpression, as of something the matter with each party, that I had\ngathered, in the grounds, from the sight of her advance upon me with\nObert. I had by this time of course made out--and it was absurd to shut\nmy eyes to it--what _that_ particular something, at least, was. It was\nthat Obert had quickly perceived something to be the matter with _her_,\nand that she, on her side, had become aware of his discovery.\n\nI wondered hereupon if the discovery were inevitable for each gentleman\nin succession, and if this were their reason for changing so often. Did\neveryone leave her, like Obert, with an uneasy impression of her, and\nwere these impressions now passed about with private hilarity or\nprofundity, though without having reached me save from the source I have\nnamed? I affected myself as constantly catching her eye, as if she\nwished to call my attention to the fact of who was with her and who was\nnot. I had kept my distance since our episode with the pastels, and yet\nnothing could more come home to me than that I had really not, since\nthen, been absent from her. We met without talk, but not, thanks to\nthese pointed looks, without contact. I daresay that, for that matter,\nmy cogitations--for I must have bristled with them--would have made me\nas stiff a puzzle to interpretative minds as I had suffered other\nphenomena to become to my own. I daresay I wandered with a tell-tale\nrestlessness of which the practical detachment might well have mystified\nthose who hadn't suspicions. Whenever I caught Mrs. Server's eye it was\nreally to wonder how many suspicions _she_ had. I came upon her in great\ndim chambers, and I came upon her before sweeps of view. I came upon\nher once more with the Comte de Dreuil, with Lord Lutley, with Ford\nObert, with almost every other man in the house, and with several of\nthese, as if there had not been enough for so many turns, two or three\ntimes over. Only at no moment, whatever the favouring frame, did I come\nupon her with Gilbert Long. It was of course an anomaly that, as an easy\naccident, I was not again myself set in the favouring frame. That I\nconsistently escaped being might indeed have been the meaning most\nmarked in our mute recognitions.\n\nDiscretion, then, I finally felt, played an odd part when it simply left\none more attached, morally, to one's prey. What was most evident to me\nby five o'clock in the afternoon was that I was too preoccupied not to\nfind it the best wisdom to accept my mood. It was all very well to run\naway; there would be no effectual running away but to have my things\nquickly packed and catch, if possible, a train for town. On the spot I\nhad to _be_ on it; and it began to dawn before me that there was\nsomething quite other I possibly might do with Mrs. Server than\nendeavour ineffectually to forget her. What was none of one's business\nmight change its name should importunity take the form of utility. In\nresisted observation that was vivid thought, in inevitable thought that\nwas vivid observation, through a succession, in short, of phases in\nwhich I shall not pretend to distinguish one of these elements from the\nother, I found myself cherishing the fruit of the seed dropped equally\nby Ford Obert and by Mrs. Briss. What was the matter with _me_?--so much\nas that I had ended by asking myself; and the answer had come as an\nunmistakable return of the anxiety produced in me by my first seeing\nthat I had fairly let Grace Brissenden loose. My original protest\nagainst the flash of inspiration in which she had fixed responsibility\non Mrs. Server had been in fact, I now saw, but the scared presentiment\nof something in store for myself. This scare, to express it sharply, had\nverily not left me from that moment; and if I had been already then\nanxious it was because I had felt myself foredoomed to be sure the poor\nlady herself would be. Why I should have minded this, should have been\nanxious at her anxiety and scared at her scare, was a question troubling\nme too little on the spot for me to suffer it to trouble me, as a\npainter of my state, in this place. It is sufficient that when so much\nof the afternoon had waned as to bring signs of the service of tea in\nthe open air, I knew how far I was gone in pity for her. For I had at\nlast had to take in what my two interlocutors had given me. Their\nimpression, coinciding and, as one might say, disinterested, couldn't,\nafter a little, fail in some degree to impose itself. It had its value.\nMrs. Server _was_ \"nervous.\"\n\nIt little mattered to me now that Mrs. Briss had put it to me--that I\nhad even whimsically put it to myself--that I was perhaps in love with\nher. That was as good a name as another for an interest springing up in\nan hour, and was moreover a decent working hypothesis. The sentiment had\nnot indeed asserted itself at \"first sight,\" though it might have taken\nits place remarkably well among the phenomena of what is known as\nsecond. The real fact was, none the less, that I was quite too sorry for\nher to be anything except sorry. This odd feeling was something that I\nmay as well say I shall not even now attempt to account for--partly, it\nis true, because my recital of the rest of what I was to see in no small\nmeasure does so. It was a force that I at this stage simply found I had\nalready succumbed to. If it was not the result of what I had granted to\nmyself was the matter with her, then it was rather the very cause of my\nmaking that concession. It was a different thing from my first prompt\nimpulse to shield her. I had already shielded her--fought for her so far\nas I could or as the case immediately required. My own sense of how I\nwas affected had practically cleared up, in short, in the presence of\nthis deeper vision of her. My divinations and inductions had finally\nbrought home to me that in the whole huge, brilliant, crowded place I\nwas the only person save one who was in anything that could be called a\nrelation to her. The other person's relation was concealed, and mine,\nso far as she herself was concerned, was unexpressed--so that I suppose\nwhat most, at the juncture in question, stirred within me was the wonder\nof how I might successfully express it. I felt that so long as I didn't\nexpress it I should be haunted with the idea of something infinitely\ntouching and tragic in her loneliness--possibly in her torment, in her\nterror. If she was \"nervous\" to the tune I had come to recognise, it\ncould only be because she had grounds. And what might her grounds more\nnaturally be than that, arranged and arrayed, disguised and decorated,\npursuing in vain, through our careless company, her search for the right\nshade of apparent security, she felt herself none the less all the while\nthe restless victim of fear and failure?\n\nOnce my imagination had seen her in this light the touches it could add\nto the picture might be trusted to be telling. Further observation was\nto convince me of their truth, but while I waited for it with my\napprehension that it would come in spite of me I easily multiplied and\nlavished them. I made out above all what she would most be trying to\nhide. It was not, so to speak, the guarded primary fact--it could only\nbe, wretched woman, that produced, that disastrous, treacherous\nconsequence of the fact which her faculties would exhibit, and most of\nall the snapped cord of her faculty of talk. Guy Brissenden had, at the\nworst, his compromised face and figure to show and to shroud--if he\nwere really, that is, as much aware of them as one had suspected. She\nhad her whole compromised machinery of thought and speech, and if these\nsigns were not, like his, external, that made her case but the harder,\nfor she had to create, with intelligence rapidly ebbing, with wit half\ngone, the illusion of an unimpaired estate. She was like some unhappy\nlady robbed of her best jewels--obliged so to dispose and distribute the\nminor trinkets that had escaped as still to give the impression of a\nrich _\u00c3\u00a9crin_. Was not that embarrassment, if one analysed a little, at\nthe bottom of her having been all day, in the vulgar phrase and as the\nthree of us had too cruelly noted, all over the place? _Was_ indeed, for\nthat matter, this observation confined to us, or had it at last been\nirrepressibly determined on the part of the company at large? This was a\nquestion, I hasten to add, that I would not now for the world have put\nto the test. I felt I should have known how to escape had any rumour of\nwonder at Mrs. Server's ways been finally conveyed to me. I might from\nthis moment have, as much as I liked, my own sense of it, but I was\ndefinitely conscious of a sort of loyalty to her that would have\nrendered me blank before others: though not indeed that--oh, at last,\nquite the contrary!--it would have forbidden me to watch and watch. I\npositively dreaded the accident of my being asked by one of the men if I\nknew how everyone was talking about her. If everyone was talking about\nher, I wanted positively not to know. But nobody was, probably--they\nscarcely could be as yet. Without suggestive collateral evidence there\nwould be nobody in the house so conscientiously infernal as Mrs.\nBrissenden, Obert and I.\n\nNewmarch had always, in our time, carried itself as the great asylum of\nthe finer wit, more or less expressly giving out that, as invoking\nhospitality or other countenance, none of the stupid, none even of the\nvotaries of the grossly obvious, need apply; but I could luckily at\npresent reflect that its measurements in this direction had not always\nbeen my own, and that, moreover, whatever precision they possessed,\nhuman blandness, even in such happy halls, had not been quite abolished.\nThere was a sound law in virtue of which one could always--alike in\nprivileged and unprivileged circles--rest more on people's density than\non their penetrability. Wasn't it their density too that would be\npractically nearest their good nature? Whatever her successive partners\nof a moment might have noticed, they wouldn't have discovered in her\nreason for dropping them quickly a principle of fear that they might\nnotice her failure articulately to keep up. My own actual vision, which\nhad developed with such affluence, was that, in a given case, she could\nkeep up but for a few minutes and was therefore obliged to bring the\ncontact to an end before exposure. I had consistently mastered her\npredicament: she had at once to cultivate contacts, so that people\nshouldn't guess her real concentration, and to make them a literal touch\nand go, so that they shouldn't suspect the enfeeblement of her mind. It\nwas obviously still worth everything to her that she was so charming. I\nhad theorised with Mrs. Brissenden on her supposititious inanity, but\nthe explanation of such cynicism in either of us could only be a\nsensibility to the truth that attractions so great might float her even\na long time after intelligence pure and simple should have collapsed.\n\nWas not my present uneasiness, none the less, a private curiosity to\nascertain just how much or how little of that element she had saved from\nthe wreck? She dodged, doubled, managed, broke off, clutching occasions,\nyet doubtless risking dumbnesses, vaguenesses and other betrayals,\ndepending on attitudes, motions, expressions, a material personality, in\nfine, in which a plain woman would have found nothing but failure; and\npeace therefore might rule the scene on every hypothesis but that of her\ngetting, to put it crudely, worse. How I remember saying to myself that\nif she didn't get better she surely _must_ get worse!--being aware that\nI referred on the one side to her occult surrender and on the other to\nits awful penalty. It became present to me that she possibly might\nrecover if anything should happen that would pull her up, turn her into\nsome other channel. If, however, that consideration didn't detain me\nlonger the fact may stand as a sign of how little I believed in any\ncheck. Gilbert Long might die, but not the intensity he had inspired.\nThe analogy with the situation of the Brissendens here, I further\nconsidered, broke down; I at any rate rather positively welcomed the\nview that the sacrificed party to _that_ union might really find the\narrest of his decline, if not the renewal of his youth, in the loss of\nhis wife. Would this lady indeed, as an effect of _his_ death, begin to\nwrinkle and shrivel? It would sound brutal to say that this was what I\nshould have preferred to hold, were it not that I in fact felt forced to\nrecognise the slightness of such a chance. She would have loved his\nyouth, and have made it her own, in death as in life, and he would have\nquitted the world, in truth, only the more effectually to leave it to\nher. Mrs. Server's quandary--which was now all I cared for--was exactly\nin her own certitude of every absence of issue. But I need give little\nmore evidence of how it had set me thinking.\n\nAs much as anything else, perhaps, it was the fear of what one of the\nmen might say to me that made me for an hour or two, at this crisis,\ncontinuously shy. Nobody, doubtless, would have said anything worse than\nthat she was more of a flirt than ever, that they had all compared notes\nand would accordingly be interested in some hint of another, possibly a\ndeeper, experience. It would have been almost as embarrassing to have to\ntell them how little experience I had had in fact as to have had to tell\nthem how much I had had in fancy--all the more that I had as yet only my\nthin idea of the line of feeling in her that had led her so to spare me.\nTea on the terraces represented, meanwhile, among us, so much neglect of\neverything else that my meditations remained for some time as unobserved\nas I could desire. I was not, moreover, heeding much where they carried\nme, and became aware of what I owed them only on at last finding myself\nanticipated as the occupant of an arbour into which I had strolled. Then\nI saw I had reached a remote part of the great gardens, and that for\nsome of my friends also secluded thought had inducements; though it was\nnot, I hasten to add, that either of the pair I here encountered\nappeared to be striking out in any very original direction. Lady John\nand Guy Brissenden, in the arbour, were thinking secludedly together;\nthey were together, that is, because they were scarce a foot apart, and\nthey were thinking, I inferred, because they were doing nothing else.\nSilence, by every symptom, had definitely settled on them, and whatever\nit was I interrupted had no resemblance to talk. Nothing--in the general\nair of evidence--had more struck me than that what Lady John's famous\nintellect seemed to draw most from Brissenden's presence was the\nliberty to rest. Yet it shook off this languor as soon as she saw me; it\nthrew itself straight into the field; it went, I could see, through all\nthe motions required of it by her ladyship's fallacious philosophy. I\ncould mark these emotions, and what determined them, as behind clear\nglass.\n\nI found, on my side, a rare intellectual joy, the oddest secret\nexultation, in feeling her begin instantly to play the part I had\nattributed to her in the irreducible drama. She broke out in a manner\nthat could only have had for its purpose to represent to me that mere\nweak amiability had committed her to such a predicament. It was to\nhumour her friend's husband that she had strayed so far, for she was\nsomehow sorry for him, and--good creature as we all knew her--had, on\nprinciple, a kind little way of her own with silly infatuations. His\n_was_ silly, but it was unmistakable, and she had for some time been\nfinding it, in short, a case for a special tact. That he bored her to\ndeath I might have gathered by the way they sat there, and she could\ntrust me to believe--couldn't she?--that she was only musing as to how\nshe might most humanely get rid of him. She would lead him safely back\nto the fold if I would give her time. She seemed to ask it all, oddly,\nof _me_, to take me remarkably into her confidence, to refer me, for a\nspecimen of his behaviour, to his signal abandonment of his wife the\nday before, his having waited over, to come down, for the train in which\npoor _she_ was to travel. It was at all events, I felt, one of the\nconsequences of having caught on to so much that I by this time found\nmyself catching on to everything. I read into Lady John's wonderful\nmanner--which quite clamoured, moreover, for an interpretation--all that\nwas implied in the lesson I had extracted from other portions of the\nbusiness. It was distinctly poor she who gave me the lead, and it was\nnot less definite that she put it to me that I should render her a\nservice either by remaining with them or by inventing something that\nwould lure her persecutor away. She desired him, even at the cost of her\nbeing left alone, distracted from his pursuit.\n\nPoor he, in his quarter, I hasten to add, contributed to my picking out\nthis embroidery nothing more helpful than a sustained detachment. He\nsaid as little as possible, seemed heedless of what was otherwise said,\nand only gave me on his own account a look or two of dim suggestiveness.\nYet it was these looks that most told with me, and what they, for their\npart, conveyed was a plea that directly contradicted Lady John's. I\nunderstood him that it was he who was bored, he who had been pursued, he\nfor whom perversity had become a dreadful menace, he, in fine, who\npleaded for my intervention. He was so willing to trust me to relieve\nhim of his companion that I think he would simply have bolted without\ndeferring to me if I had not taken my precautions against it. I had, as\nit happened, another momentary use for him than this: I wished on the\none hand not to lose him and on the other not to lose Lady John, though\nI had quickly enough guessed this brilliant woman's real preference, of\nwhich it in fact soon became my lively wish to see the proof. The union\nof these two was too artificial for me not already to have connected\nwith it the service it might render, in her ladyship's view, to that\nundetected cultivation, on her part, of a sentiment for Gilbert Long\nwhich, through his feigned response to it, fitted so completely to the\nother pieces in my collection. To see all this was at the time, I\nremember, to be as inhumanly amused as if one had found one could create\nsomething. I had created nothing but a clue or two to the larger\ncomprehension I still needed, yet I positively found myself overtaken by\na mild artistic glow. What had occurred was that, for my full\ndemonstration, I needed Long, and that, by the same stroke, I became\nsure I should certainly get him by temporising a little.\n\nLady John was in love with him and had kicked up, to save her credit,\nthe dust of a fictive relation with another man--the relation one of\nmere artifice and the man one in her encouragement of whom nobody would\nbelieve. Yet she was also discoverably divided between her prudence and\nher vanity, for if it was difficult to make poor Briss figure at all\nvividly as an insistent satellite, the thankless tact she had to employ\ngave her exactly, she argued, the right to be refreshingly fanned with\nan occasional flap of the flag under which she had, as she ridiculously\nfancied, truly conquered. If she was where I found her because her\nescort had dragged her there, she had made the best of it through the\nhope of assistance from another quarter. She had held out on the\npossibility that Mr. Long--whom one _could_ without absurdity sit in an\narbour with--might have had some happy divination of her plight. He had\nhad such divinations before--thanks to a condition in him that made\nsensibility abnormal--and the least a wretched woman could do when\nbetrayed by the excess of nature's bounty was to play admirer against\nadmirer and be \"talked about\" on her own terms. She would just this once\nhave admitted it, I was to gather, to be an occasion for pleading\nguilty--oh, so harmlessly!--to a consciousness of the gentleman mutely\nnamed between us. Well, the \"proof\" I just alluded to was that I had not\nsat with my friends five minutes before Gilbert Long turned up.\n\nI saw in a moment how neatly my being there with them played _his_ game;\nI became in this fashion a witness for him that he could almost as\nlittle leave Lady John alone as--well, as other people could. It may\nperfectly have been the pleasure of this reflection that again made him\nfree and gay--produced in him, in any case, a different shade of manner\nfrom that with which, before luncheon, as the consequence perhaps of a\nvague _flair_ for my possible penetration, I had suspected him of edging\naway from me. Not since my encounter with him at Paddington the\nafternoon before had I had so to recognise him as the transfigured\ntalker. To see Lady John with him was to have little enough doubt of\n_her_ recognitions, just as this spectacle also dotted each \"i\" in my\nconviction of his venial--I can only call it that--duplicity. I made up\nmy mind on the spot that it had been no part of his plan to practise on\nher, and that the worst he could have been accused of was a good-natured\nacceptance, more apparent than real, for his own purposes, of her\ntheory--which she from time to time let peep out--that they would have\nliked each other better if they hadn't been each, alas! so good. He\nprofited by the happy accident of having pleased a person so much in\nevidence, and indeed it was tolerably clear to me that neither party was\nduped. Lady John didn't want a lover; this would have been, as people\nsay, a larger order than, given the other complications of her\nexistence, she could meet; but she wanted, in a high degree, the\nappearance of carrying on a passion that imposed alike fearless\nrealisations and conscious renouncements, and this circumstance fully\nfell in with the convenience and the special situation of her friend.\nHer vanity rejoiced, so far as she dared to let it nibble, and the\nmysteries she practised, the dissimulations she elaborated, the general\ndanger of detection in which she flattered herself that she publicly\nwalked, were after all so much grist to the mill of that appetite.\n\nBy just so much, however, as it could never come up between them that\nthere was another woman in Gilbert's history, by just so much would it\non the other hand have been an articulate axiom that as many of the poor\nBrisses of the world as she might care to accommodate would be welcome\nto figure in her own. This personage, under that deeper induction, I\nsuddenly became aware that I also greatly pitied--pitied almost as much\nas I pitied Mrs. Server; and my pity had doubtless something to do with\nthe fact that, after I had proposed to him that we should adjourn\ntogether and we had, on his prompt, even though slightly dry response,\nplaced the invidious arbour at a certain distance, I passed my hand into\nhis arm. There were things I wanted of him, and the first was that he\nshould let me show him I could be kind to him. I had made of the\ncircumstance of tea at the house a pretext for our leaving the others,\neach of whom I felt as rather showily calling my attention to their good\nold ground for not wishing to rejoin the crowd. As to what Brissenden\nwished I had made up my mind; I had made up my mind as to the subject of\nhis thoughts while they wandered, during his detention, from Lady John;\nand if the next of my wishes was to enter into his desire, I had decided\non giving it effect by the time we reached the shortest of the vistas at\nthe end of which the house reared a brave front.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nI stayed him there while I put it to him that he would probably in fact\nprefer to go back.\n\n\"You're not going then yourself?\"\n\n\"No, I don't particularly want tea; and I may as well now confess to you\nthat I'm taking a lonely, unsociable walk. I don't enjoy such occasions\nas these,\" I said, \"unless I from time to time get off by myself\nsomewhere long enough to tell myself how much I do enjoy them. That's\nwhat I was cultivating solitude for when I happened just now to come\nupon you. When I found you there with Lady John there was nothing for me\nbut to make the best of it; but I'm glad of this chance to assure you\nthat, every appearance to the contrary notwithstanding, I wasn't\nprowling about in search of you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" my companion frankly replied, \"I'm glad you turned up. I wasn't\nespecially amusing myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think I know how little!\"\n\nHe fixed me a moment with his pathetic old face, and I knew more than\never that I was sorry for him. I was quite extraordinarily sorry, and I\nwondered whether I mightn't without offence or indiscretion really let\nhim see it. It was to this end I had held him and wanted a little to\nkeep him, and I was reassured as I felt him, though I had now released\nhim, linger instead of leaving me. I had made him uneasy last night, and\na new reason or two for my doing so had possibly even since then come\nup; yet these things also would depend on the way he might take them.\nThe look with which he at present faced me seemed to hint that he would\ntake them as I hoped, and there was no curtness, but on the contrary the\ndawn of a dim sense that I might possibly aid him, in the tone with\nwhich he came half-way. \"You 'know'?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I laughed, \"I know everything!\"\n\nHe didn't laugh; I hadn't seen him laugh, at Newmarch, once; he was\ncontinuously, portentously grave, and I at present remembered how the\neffect of this had told for me at luncheon, contrasted as it was with\nthat of Mrs. Server's desperate, exquisite levity. \"You know I decidedly\nhave too much of that dreadful old woman?\"\n\nThere was a sound in the question that would have made me, to my own\nsense, start, though I as quickly hoped I had not done so to\nBrissenden's. I couldn't have persuaded myself, however, that I had\nescaped showing him the flush of my effort to show nothing. I had taken\nhis disgusted allusion as to Mrs. Brissenden, and the action of that\nwas upsetting. But nothing, fortunately, was psychologically more\ninteresting than to grasp the next moment the truth of his reference. It\nwas only the fact of his himself looking so much older than Lady John\nthat had blinded me for an instant to the propriety of his not thinking\nof her as young. She wasn't young as _he_ had a right to call people,\nand I felt a glow--also, I feared, too visible--as soon as I had seen\nwhom he meant. His meaning Lady John did me somehow so much good that I\nbelieved it would have done me still more to hear him call her a\nharridan or a Jezebel. It was none of my business; how little was\nanything, when it came to that, my business!--yet indefinably,\nunutterably, I felt assuaged for him and comforted. I verily believe it\nhung in the balance a minute or two that in my impulse to draw him out,\nso that I might give him my sympathy, I was prepared to risk overturning\nthe edifice of my precautions. I luckily, as it happened, did nothing of\nthe sort; I contrived to breathe consolingly on his secret without\nbetraying an intention. There was almost no one in the place save two or\nthree of the very youngest women whom he wouldn't have had a right to\ncall old. Lady John was a hag, then; Mrs. Server herself was more than\non the turn; Gilbert Long was fat and forty; and I cast about for some\nlight in which I could show that I--_\u00c3\u00a0 plus forte raison_--was a\npantaloon. \"Of course you can't quite see the fun of it, and it really\nisn't fair to you. You struck me as much more in your element,\" I\nventured to add, \"when, this morning, more than once, I chanced to\nobserve you led captive by Mrs. Server.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a different affair,\" he answered with an accent that\npromised a growth of confidence.\n\n\"Mrs. Server's an old woman,\" I continued, \"but she can't seem to a\nfellow like you as old as Lady John. She has at any rate more charm;\nthough perhaps not,\" I added, \"quite so much talk.\"\n\nOn this he said an extraordinary thing, which all but made me start\nagain. \"Oh, she hasn't any _talk_!\"\n\nI took, as quickly as possible, refuge in a surprised demurrer. \"Not\n_any_?\"\n\n\"None to speak of.\"\n\nI let all my wonder come. \"But wasn't she chattering to you at\nluncheon?\" It forced him to meet my eyes at greater length, and I could\nalready see that my experiment--for insidiously and pardonably such I\nwished to make it--was on the way to succeed. I had been right then, and\nI knew where I stood. He couldn't have been \"drawn\" on his wife, and he\ncouldn't have been drawn, in the least directly, on himself, but as he\ncould thus easily be on Lady John, so likewise he could on other women,\nor on the particular one, at least, who mattered to me. I felt I really\nknew what I was about, for to draw him on Mrs. Server was in truth to\ndraw him indirectly on himself. It was indeed perhaps because I had by\nthis time in a measure expressed, in terms however general, the interest\nwith which he inspired me, that I now found myself free to shift the\nground of my indiscretion. I only wanted him to know that on the\nquestion of Mrs. Server I was prepared to go as far with him as he\nshould care to move. How it came to me now that he was _the_ absolutely\nsafe person in the house to talk of her with! \"I was too far away from\nyou to hear,\" I had gone on; \"and I could only judge of her flow of\nconversation from the animated expression of her face. It was\nextraordinarily animated. But that, I admit,\" I added, \"strikes one\nalways as a sort of _parti pris_ with her. She's never _not_\nextraordinarily animated.\"\n\n\"She has no flow of conversation whatever,\" said Guy Brissenden.\n\nI considered. \"Really?\"\n\nHe seemed to look at me quite without uneasiness now. \"Why, haven't you\nseen for yourself----?\"\n\n\"How the case stands with her on that head? Do you mean haven't I talked\nwith her? Well, scarcely; for it's a fact that every man in the house\n_but_ I strikes me as having been deluged with that privilege: if\nindeed,\" I laughed, \"her absence of topics suffers it to be either a\nprivilege or a deluge! She affects me, in any case, as determined to\nhave nothing to do with me. She walks all the rest of you about; she\ngives you each your turn; me only she skips, she systematically ignores.\nI'm half consoled for it, however,\" I wound up, \"by seeing what short\ninnings any individual of you has. You personally strike me as having\nhad the longest.\"\n\nBrissenden appeared to wonder where I was coming out, yet not as if he\nfeared it. There was even a particular place, if I could but guess it,\nwhere he would have liked me to come. \"Oh, she's extremely charming. But\nof course she's strikingly odd.\"\n\n\"Odd?--really?\"\n\n\"Why, in the sense, I mean, that I thought you suggested you've\nnoticed.\"\n\n\"That of extravagant vivacity? Oh, I've had to notice it at a distance,\nwithout knowing what it represents.\"\n\nHe just hesitated. \"You haven't any idea at all what it represents?\"\n\n\"How should I have,\" I smiled, \"when she never comes near me? I've\nthought _that_, as I tell you, marked. What does her avoidance of _me_\nrepresent? Has she happened, with you, to throw any light on it?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Brissenden after another moment, \"that she's rather\nafraid of you.\"\n\nI could only be surprised. \"The most harmless man in the house?\"\n\n\"_Are_ you really?\" he asked--and there was a touch of the comic in\nhearing him put it with his inveterate gravity.\n\n\"If you take me for anything else,\" I replied, \"I doubt if you'll find\nanyone to back you.\"\n\nMy companion, on this, looked away for a little, turned about, fixed his\neyes on the house, seemed, as with a drop of interest, on the point of\nleaving me. But instead of leaving me he brought out the next moment: \"I\ndon't want anyone to back me. I don't care. I didn't mean just now,\" he\ncontinued, \"that Mrs. Server has said to me anything against you, or\nthat she fears you because she dislikes you. She only told me she\nthought you disliked _her_.\"\n\nIt gave me a kind of shock. \"A creature so beautiful, and so--so----\"\n\n\"So what?\" he asked as I found myself checked by my desire to come to\nher aid.\n\n\"Well, so brilliantly happy.\"\n\nI had all his attention again. \"Is that what she _is_?\"\n\n\"Then don't you, with your opportunities, know?\" I was conscious of\nrather an inspiration, a part of which was to be jocose. \"What are you\ntrying,\" I laughed, \"to get out of me?\"\n\nIt struck me luckily that, though he remained as proof against gaiety as\never, he was, thanks to his preoccupation, not disagreeably affected by\nmy tone. \"Of course if you've no idea, I can get nothing.\"\n\n\"No idea of what?\"\n\nThen it was that I at last got it straight. \"Well, of what's the matter\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Is there anything particular? If there _is_,\" I went on, \"there's\nsomething that I've got out of _you_!\"\n\n\"How so, if you don't know what it is?\"\n\n\"Do you mean if you yourself don't?\" But without detaining him on this,\n\"Of what in especial do the signs,\" I asked, \"consist?\"\n\n\"Well, of everyone's thinking so--that there's something or other.\"\n\nThis again struck me, but it struck me too much. \"Oh, everyone's a\nfool!\"\n\nHe saw, in his queer wan way, how it had done so. \"Then you _have_ your\nown idea?\"\n\nI daresay my smile at him, while I waited, showed a discomfort. \"Do you\nmean people are talking about her?\"\n\nBut he waited himself. \"Haven't they shown you----?\"\n\n\"No, no one has spoken. Moreover I wouldn't have let them.\"\n\n\"Then there you _are_!\" Brissenden exclaimed. \"If you've kept them off,\nit must be because you differ with them.\"\n\n\"I shan't be sure of that,\" I returned, \"till I know what they think!\nHowever, I repeat,\" I added, \"that I shouldn't even then care. I don't\nmind admitting that she much interests me.\"\n\n\"There you are, there you are!\" he said again.\n\n\"That's all that's the matter with her so far as _I_'m concerned. You\nsee, at any rate, how little it need make her afraid of me. She's lovely\nand she's gentle and she's happy.\"\n\nMy friend kept his eyes on me. \"What is there to interest you so in\nthat? Isn't it a description that applies here to a dozen other women?\nYou can't say, you know, that you're interested in _them_, for you just\nspoke of them as so many fools.\"\n\nThere was a certain surprise for me in so much acuteness, which,\nhowever, doubtless admonished me as to the need of presence of mind. \"I\nwasn't thinking of the ladies--I was thinking of the men.\"\n\n\"That's amiable to _me_,\" he said with his gentle gloom.\n\n\"Oh, my dear Brissenden, I except 'you.'\"\n\n\"And why should you?\"\n\nI felt a trifle pushed. \"I'll tell you some other time. And among the\nladies I except Mrs. Brissenden, with whom, as you may have noticed,\nI've been having much talk.\"\n\n\"And will you tell me some other time about that too?\" On which, as I\nbut amicably shook my head for no, he had his first dimness of\npleasantry. \"I'll get it then from my wife.\"\n\n\"Never. She won't tell you.\"\n\n\"She has passed you her word? That won't alter the fact that she tells\nme everything.\"\n\nHe really said it in a way that made me take refuge for an instant in\nlooking at my watch. \"Are you going back to tea? If you are, I'll, in\nspite of my desire to roam, walk twenty steps with you.\" I had already\nagain put my hand into his arm, and we strolled for a little till I\nthrew off that I was sure Mrs. Server was waiting for him. To this he\nreplied that if I wished to get rid of him he was as willing to take\nthat as anything else for granted--an observation that I, on my side,\nanswered with an inquiry, though an inquiry that had nothing to do with\nit. \"Do you also tell everything to Mrs. Brissenden?\"\n\nIt brought him up shorter than I had expected. \"Do you ask me that in\norder that I shan't speak to her of this?\"\n\nI showed myself at a loss. \"Of 'this'----?\"\n\n\"Why, of what we've made out----\"\n\n\"About Mrs. Server, you and I? You must act as to that, my dear fellow,\nquite on your own discretion. All the more that what on earth _have_ we\nmade out? I assure you I haven't a secret to confide to you about her,\nexcept that I've never seen a person more unquenchably radiant.\"\n\nHe almost jumped at it. \"Well, that's just it!\"\n\n\"But just what?\"\n\n\"Why, what they're all talking about. That she _is_ so awfully radiant.\nThat she's so tremendously happy. It's the question,\" he explained, \"of\nwhat in the world she has to make her so.\"\n\nI winced a little, but tried not to show it. \"My dear man, how do _I_\nknow?\"\n\n\"She _thinks_ you know,\" he after a moment answered.\n\nI could only stare. \"Mrs. Server thinks I know what makes her happy?\" I\nthe more easily represented such a conviction as monstrous in that it\ntruly had its surprise for me.\n\nBut Brissenden now was all with his own thought. \"She _isn't_ happy.\"\n\n\"You mean that that's what's the matter with her under her\nappearance----? Then what makes the appearance so extraordinary?\"\n\n\"Why, exactly what I mention--that one doesn't see anything whatever in\nher to correspond to it.\"\n\nI hesitated. \"Do you mean in her circumstances?\"\n\n\"Yes--or in her character. Her circumstances are nothing wonderful. She\nhas none too much money; she has had three children and lost them; and\nnobody that belongs to her appears ever to have been particularly nice\nto her.\"\n\nI turned it over. \"How you _do_ get on with her!\"\n\n\"Do you call it getting on with her to be the more bewildered the more I\nsee her?\"\n\n\"Isn't to say you're bewildered only, on the whole, to say you're\ncharmed? That always--doesn't it?--describes more or less any engrossed\nrelation with a lovely lady.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure I'm so charmed.\" He spoke as if he had thought this\nparticular question over for himself; he had his way of being lucid\nwithout brightness. \"I'm not at all easily charmed, you know,\" he the\nnext moment added; \"and I'm not a fellow who goes about much after\nwomen.\"\n\n\"Ah, that I never supposed! Why in the world _should_ you? It's the last\nthing!\" I laughed. \"But isn't this--quite (what shall one call it?)\ninnocently--rather a peculiar case?\"\n\nMy question produced in him a little gesture of elation--a gesture\nemphasised by a snap of his forefinger and thumb. \"I knew you knew it\nwas special! I knew you've been thinking about it!\"\n\n\"You certainly,\" I replied with assurance, \"have, during the last five\nminutes, made me do so with some sharpness. I don't pretend that I don't\nnow recognise that there _must_ be something the matter. I only\ndesire--not unnaturally--that there _should_ be, to put me in the right\nfor having thought, if, as you're so sure, such a freedom as that can be\nbrought home to me. If Mrs. Server is beautiful and gentle and\nstrange,\" I speciously went on, \"what are those things but an\nattraction?\"\n\nI saw how he had them, whatever they were, before him as he slowly shook\nhis head. \"They're not an attraction. They're too queer.\"\n\nI caught in an instant my way to fall in with him; and not the less that\nI by this time felt myself committed, up to the intellectual eyes, to\nascertaining just _how_ queer the person under discussion might be. \"Oh,\nof course I'm not speaking of her as a party to a silly flirtation, or\nan object of any sort of trivial pursuit. But there are so many\ndifferent ways of being taken.\"\n\n\"For a fellow like you. But not for a fellow like me. For me there's\nonly one.\"\n\n\"To be, you mean, in love?\"\n\nHe put it a little differently. \"Well, to be thoroughly pleased.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's doubtless the best way and the firm ground. And you mean\nyou're _not_ thoroughly pleased with Mrs. Server?\"\n\n\"No--and yet I want to be kind to her. Therefore what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, if it's what's the matter with _you_ you ask me, that extends the\nquestion. If you want to be kind to her, you get on with her, as we were\nsaying, quite enough for my argument. And isn't the matter also, after\nall,\" I demanded, \"that you simply feel she desires you to be kind?\"\n\n\"She does that.\" And he looked at me as with the sense of drawing from\nme, for his relief, some greater help than I was as yet conscious of the\ncourage to offer. \"It _is_ that she desires me. She likes it. And the\nextraordinary thing is that _I_ like it.\"\n\n\"And why in the world shouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Because she terrifies me. She has something to hide.\"\n\n\"But, my dear man,\" I asked with a gaiety singularly out of relation to\nthe small secret thrill produced in me by these words--\"my dear man,\nwhat woman who's worth anything hasn't?\"\n\n\"Yes, but there are different ways. What _she_ tries for is this false\nappearance of happiness.\"\n\nI weighed it. \"But isn't that the best thing?\"\n\n\"It's terrible to have to keep it up.\"\n\n\"Ah, but if you don't _for_ her? If it all comes on herself?\"\n\n\"It doesn't,\" Guy Brissenden presently said. \"I do--'for' her--help to\nkeep it up.\" And then, still unexpectedly to me, came out the rest of\nhis confession. \"I want to--I try to; that's what I mean by being kind\nto her, and by the gratitude with which she takes it. One feels that one\ndoesn't want her to break down.\"\n\nIt was on this--from the poignant touch in it--that I at last felt I had\nburnt my ships and didn't care how much I showed I was with him. \"Oh,\nbut she won't. You must keep her going.\"\n\nHe stood a little with a thumb in each pocket of his trousers, and his\nmelancholy eyes ranging far over my head--over the tops of the highest\ntrees. \"Who am _I_ to keep people going?\"\n\n\"Why, you're just the man. Aren't you happy?\"\n\nHe still ranged the tree-tops. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you belong to the useful class. You've the wherewithal to\ngive. It's the happy people who should help the others.\"\n\nHe had, in the same attitude, another pause. \"It's easy for _you_ to\ntalk!\"\n\n\"Because I'm not happy?\"\n\nIt made him bring his eyes again down to me. \"I think you're a little so\nnow at my expense.\"\n\nI shook my head reassuringly. \"It doesn't cost you anything if--as I\nconfess to it now--I do to some extent understand.\"\n\n\"That's more, then, than--after talking of it this way with you--I feel\nthat _I_ do!\"\n\nHe had brought that out with a sudden sigh, turning away to go on; so\nthat we took a few steps more. \"You've nothing to trouble about,\" I then\nfreely remarked, \"but that you _are_ as kind as the case requires and\nthat you do help. I daresay that you'll find her even now on the terrace\nlooking out for you.\" I patted his back, as we went a little further,\nbut as I still preferred to stay away from the house I presently stopped\nagain. \"Don't fall below your chance. _Noblesse oblige._ We'll pull her\nthrough.\"\n\n\"You say 'we,'\" he returned, \"but you do keep out of it!\"\n\n\"Why should you wish me to interfere with you?\" I asked. \"I wouldn't\nkeep out of it if she wanted me as much as she wants you. That, by your\nown admission, is exactly what she doesn't.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Brissenden, \"I'll make her go for you. I think I want\nyour assistance quite as much as she can want mine.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I protested for this, \"I've really given you already every ounce\nof mine I can squeeze out. And you know for yourself far more than I\ndo.\"\n\n\"No, I don't!\"--with which he became quite sharp; \"for you know _how_\nyou know it--which I've not a notion of. It's just what I think,\" he\ncontinued, facing me again, \"you ought to tell me.\"\n\n\"I'm a little in doubt of what you're talking of, but I suppose you to\nallude to the oddity of my being so much interested without my having\nbeen more informed.\"\n\n\"You've got some clue,\" Brissenden said; \"and a clue is what I myself\nwant.\"\n\n\"Then get it,\" I laughed, \"from Mrs. Server!\"\n\nHe wondered. \"Does she know?\"\n\nI had still, after all, to dodge a little. \"Know what?\"\n\n\"Why, that you've found out what she has to hide.\"\n\n\"You're perfectly free to ask her. I wonder even that you haven't done\nso yet.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said with the finest stroke of unconsciousness he had yet\nshown me--\"well, I suppose it's because I'm afraid of her.\"\n\n\"But not too much afraid,\" I risked suggesting, \"to be hoping at this\nmoment that you'll find her if you go back to where most of our party is\ngathered. You're not going for tea--you're going for Mrs. Server: just\nof whom it was, as I say, you were thinking while you sat there with\nLady John. So what is it you so greatly fear?\"\n\nIt was as if I could see through his dim face a sort of gratitude for my\nmaking all this out to him. \"I don't know that it's anything that she\nmay do to _me_.\" He could make it out in a manner for himself. \"It's as\nif something might happen to her. It's what I told you--that she may\nbreak down. If you ask me how, or in what,\" he continued, \"how can I\ntell you? In whatever it is that she's trying to do. I don't understand\nit.\" Then he wound up with a sigh that, in spite of its softness, he\nimperfectly stifled. \"But it's something or other!\"\n\n\"What would it be, then,\" I asked, \"but what you speak of as what I've\n'found out'? The effort you distinguish in her is the effort of\nconcealment--vain, as I gather it strikes you both, so far as _I_, in my\nsupernatural acuteness, am concerned.\"\n\nFollowing this with the final ease to which my encouragement directly\nministered, he yet gave me, before he had quite arrived, a queer\nsidelong glance. \"Wouldn't it really be better if you were to tell me? I\ndon't ask her myself, you see. I don't put things to her in that way.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--I've shown you how I do see. That's a part of your admirable\nconsideration. But I must repeat that nothing would induce me to tell\nyou.\"\n\nHis poor old face fairly pleaded. \"But I want so to know.\"\n\n\"Ah, there it is!\" I almost triumphantly laughed.\n\n\"There what is?\"\n\n\"Why, everything. What I've divined, between you and Mrs. Server, as the\ntie. Your wanting so to know.\"\n\nI felt as if he were now, intellectually speaking, plastic wax in my\nhand. \"And her wanting me not to?\"\n\n\"Wanting _me_ not to,\" I smiled.\n\nHe puzzled it out. \"And being willing, therefore----\"\n\n\"That you--you only, for sympathy, for fellowship, for the wild wonder\nof it--_should_ know? Well, for all those things, and in spite of what\nyou call your fear, _try_ her!\" With which now at last I quitted him.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nI'm afraid I can't quite say what, after that, I at first did, nor just\nhow I immediately profited by our separation. I felt absurdly excited,\nthough this indeed was what I had felt all day; there had been in fact\ndeepening degrees of it ever since my first mystic throb after finding\nmyself, the day before in our railway-carriage, shut up to an hour's\ncontemplation and collation, as it were, of Gilbert Long and Mrs.\nBrissenden. I have noted how my first full contact with the changed\nstate of these associates had caused the knell of the tranquil mind\naudibly to ring for me. I have spoken of my sharpened perception that\nsomething altogether out of the common had happened, independently, to\neach, and I could now certainly flatter myself that I hadn't missed a\nfeature of the road I had thus been beguiled to travel. It was a road\nthat had carried me far, and verily at this hour I _felt_ far. I daresay\nthat for a while after leaving poor Briss, after what I may indeed call\nlaunching him, this was what I predominantly felt. To be where I was, to\nwhatever else it might lead, treated me by its help to the taste of\nsuccess. It appeared then that the more things I fitted together the\nlarger sense, every way, they made--a remark in which I found an\nextraordinary elation. It justified my indiscreet curiosity; it crowned\nmy underhand process with beauty. The beauty perhaps was only for\n_me_--the beauty of having been right; it made at all events an element\nin which, while the long day softly dropped, I wandered and drifted and\nsecurely floated. This element bore me bravely up, and my private\ntriumph struck me as all one with the charm of the moment and of the\nplace.\n\nThere was a general shade in all the lower reaches--a fine clear dusk in\ngarden and grove, a thin suffusion of twilight out of which the greater\nthings, the high tree-tops and pinnacles, the long crests of motionless\nwood and chimnied roof, rose into golden air. The last calls of birds\nsounded extraordinarily loud; they were like the timed, serious\nsplashes, in wide, still water, of divers not expecting to rise again. I\nscarce know what odd consciousness I had of roaming at close of day in\nthe grounds of some castle of enchantment. I had positively encountered\nnothing to compare with this since the days of fairy-tales and of the\nchildish imagination of the impossible. _Then_ I used to circle round\nenchanted castles, for then I moved in a world in which the strange\n\"came true.\" It was the coming true that was the proof of the\nenchantment, which, moreover, was naturally never so great as when such\ncoming was, to such a degree and by the most romantic stroke of all, the\nfruit of one's own wizardry. I was positively--so had the wheel\nrevolved--proud of my work. I had thought it all out, and to have\nthought it was, wonderfully, to have brought it. Yet I recall how I even\nthen knew on the spot that there was something supreme I should have\nfailed to bring unless I had happened suddenly to become aware of the\nvery presence of the haunting principle, as it were, of my thought. This\nwas the light in which Mrs. Server, walking alone now, apparently, in\nthe grey wood and pausing at sight of me, showed herself in her clear\ndress at the end of a vista. It was exactly as if she had been there by\nthe operation of my intelligence, or even by that--in a still happier\nway--of my feeling. My excitement, as I have called it, on seeing her,\nwas assuredly emotion. Yet what _was_ this feeling, really?--of which,\nat the point we had thus reached, I seemed to myself to have gathered\nfrom all things an invitation to render some account.\n\nWell, I knew within the minute that I was moved by it as by an\nextraordinary tenderness; so that this is the name I must leave it to\nmake the best of. It had already been my impression that I was sorry for\nher, but it was marked for me now that I was sorrier than I had\nreckoned. All her story seemed at once to look at me out of the fact of\nher present lonely prowl. I met it without demur, only wanting her to\nknow that if I struck her as waylaying her in the wood, as waiting for\nher there at eventide with an idea, I shouldn't in the least defend\nmyself from the charge. I can scarce clearly tell how many fine strange\nthings I thought of during this brief crisis of her hesitation. I wanted\nin the first place to make it end, and while I moved a few steps toward\nher I felt almost as noiseless and guarded as if I were trapping a bird\nor stalking a fawn. My few steps brought me to a spot where another\nperspective crossed our own, so that they made together a verdurous\ncircle with an evening sky above and great lengthening, arching recesses\nin which the twilight thickened. Oh, it was quite sufficiently the\ncastle of enchantment, and when I noticed four old stone seats, massive\nand mossy and symmetrically placed, I recognised not only the influence,\nin my adventure, of the grand style, but the familiar identity of this\nconsecrated nook, which was so much of the type of all the bemused and\nremembered. We were in a beautiful old picture, we were in a beautiful\nold tale, and it wouldn't be the fault of Newmarch if some other green\n_carrefour_, not far off, didn't balance with this one and offer the\nalternative of niches, in the greenness, occupied by weather-stained\nstatues on florid pedestals.\n\nI sat straight down on the nearest of our benches, for this struck me as\nthe best way to express the conception with which the sight of Mrs.\nServer filled me. It showed her that if I watched her I also waited for\nher, and that I was therefore not affected in any manner she really need\ndeprecate. She had been too far off for me to distinguish her face, but\nher approach had faltered long enough to let me see that if she had not\ntaken it as too late she would, to escape me, have found some pretext\nfor turning off. It was just my seating myself that made the\ndifference--it was my being so simple with her that brought her on. She\ncame slowly and a little wearily down the vista, and her sad, shy\nadvance, with the massed wood on either side of her, was like the\nreminiscence of a picture or the refrain of a ballad. What made the\ndifference with _me_--if any difference had remained to be made--was the\nsense of this sharp cessation of her public extravagance. She had folded\nup her manner in her flounced parasol, which she seemed to drag after\nher as a sorry soldier his musket. It was present to me without a pang\nthat this was the person I had sent poor Briss off to find--the person\npoor Briss would owe me so few thanks for his failure to have found. It\nwas equally marked to me that, however detached and casual she might, at\nthe first sight of me, have wished to show herself, it was to alight on\npoor Briss that she had come out, it was because he had not been at the\nhouse and might therefore, on his side, be wandering, that she had taken\ncare to be unaccompanied. My demonstration was complete from the moment\nI thus had them in the act of seeking each other, and I was so pleased\nat having gathered them in that I cared little what else they had\nmissed. I neither moved nor spoke till she had come quite near me, and\nas she also gave no sound the meaning of our silence seemed to stare\nstraight out. It absolutely phrased there, in all the wonderful\nconditions, a relation already established; but the strange and\nbeautiful thing was that as soon as we had recognised and accepted it\nthis relation put us almost at our ease. \"You must be weary of walking,\"\nI said at last, \"and you see I've been keeping a seat for you.\"\n\nI had finally got up, as a sign of welcome, but I had directly\nafterwards resumed my position, and it was an illustration of the terms\non which we met that we neither of us seemed to mind her being meanwhile\non her feet. She stood before me as if to take in--with her smile that\nhad by this time sunk quite to dimness--more than we should, either of\nus, after all, be likely to be able to say. I even saw from this moment,\nI think, that, whatever she might understand, she would be able herself\nto say but little. She gave herself, in that minute, more than she\ndoubtless knew--gave herself, I mean, to my intenser apprehension. She\nwent through the form of expression, but what told me everything was the\nway the form of expression broke down. Her lovely grimace, the light of\nthe previous hours, was as blurred as a bit of brushwork in water-colour\nspoiled by the upsetting of the artist's glass. She fixed me with it as\nshe had fixed during the day forty persons, but it fluttered like a bird\nwith a broken wing. She looked about and above, down each of our dusky\navenues and up at our gilded tree-tops and our painted sky, where, at\nthe moment, the passage of a flight of rooks made a clamour. She\nappeared to wish to produce some explanation of her solitude, but I was\nquickly enough sure that she would never find a presentable one. I only\nwanted to show her how little I required it. \"I like a lonely walk,\" I\nwent on, \"at the end of a day full of people: it's always, to me, on\nsuch occasions, quite as if something has happened that the mind wants\nto catch and fix before the vividness fades. So I mope by myself an\nhour--I take stock of my impressions. But there's one thing I don't\nbelieve you know. This is the very first time, in such a place and at\nsuch an hour, that it has ever befallen me to come across a friend\nstricken with the same perversity and engaged in the same pursuit. Most\npeople, don't you see?\"--I kept it up as I could--\"don't in the least\nknow what has happened to them, and don't care to know. That's one way,\nand I don't deny it may be practically the best. But if one does care to\nknow, that's another way. As soon as I saw you there at the end of the\nalley I said to myself, with quite a little thrill of elation, 'Ah, then\nit's _her_ way too!' I wonder if you'll let me tell you,\" I floundered\npleasantly on, \"that I immediately liked you the better for it. It\nseemed to bring us more together. That's what I sat straight down here\nto show you. 'Yes,' I wished you to understand me as frankly saying, 'I\n_am_, as well as you, on the mope, or on the muse, or on whatever you\ncall it, and this isn't half a bad corner for such a mood.' I can't tell\nyou what a pleasure it is to me to see you do understand.\"\n\nI kept it up, as I say, to reassure and soothe and steady her; there was\nnothing, however fantastic and born of the pressure of the moment, that\nI wouldn't have risked for that purpose. She was absolutely on my hands\nwith her secret--I felt that from the way she stood and listened to me,\nsilently showing herself relieved and pacified. It was marked that if I\nhad hitherto seen her as \"all over the place,\" she had yet nowhere\nseemed to me less so than at this furthermost point. But if, though only\nnearer to her secret and still not in possession, I felt as justified as\nI have already described myself, so it equally came to me that I was\nquite near enough, at the pass we had reached, for what I should have to\ntake from it all. She was on my hands--it was she herself, poor\ncreature, who was: this was the thing that just now loomed large, and\nthe secret was a comparative detail. \"I think you're very kind,\" she\nsaid for all answer to the speech I have reported, and the minute after\nthis she had sunk down, in confessed collapse, to my bench, on which she\nsat and stared before her. The mere mechanism of her expression, the\ndangling paper lantern itself, was now all that was left in her face.\nShe remained a little as if discouraged by the sight of the weariness\nthat her surrender had let out. I hesitated, from just this fear of\nadding to it, to commiserate her for it more directly, and she spoke\nagain before I had found anything to say. She brought back her attention\nindeed as if with an effort and from a distance. \"What is it that has\nhappened to you?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I laughed, \"what is it that has happened to _you_?\" My question\nhad not been in the least intended for pressure, but it made her turn\nand look at me, and this, I quickly recognised, was all the answer the\nmost pitiless curiosity could have desired--all the more, as well, that\nthe intention in it had been no greater than in my words. Beautiful,\nabysmal, involuntary, her exquisite weakness simply opened up the depths\nit would have closed. It was in short a supremely unsuccessful attempt\nto say nothing. It said everything, and by the end of a minute my\nchatter--none the less out of place for being all audible--was hushed to\npositive awe by what it had conveyed. I saw as I had never seen before\nwhat consuming passion can make of the marked mortal on whom, with fixed\nbeak and claws, it has settled as on a prey. She reminded me of a sponge\nwrung dry and with fine pores agape. Voided and scraped of everything,\nher shell was merely crushable. So it was brought home to me that the\nvictim could be abased, and so it disengaged itself from these things\nthat the abasement could be conscious. That was Mrs. Server's tragedy,\nthat her consciousness survived--survived with a force that made it\nstruggle and dissemble. This consciousness was all her secret--it was at\nany rate all mine. I promised myself roundly that I would henceforth\nkeep clear of any other.\n\nI none the less--from simply sitting with her there--gathered in the\nsense of more things than I could have named, each of which, as it came\nto me, made my compassion more tender. Who of us all could say that his\nfall might not be as deep?--or might not at least become so with equal\nopportunity. I for a while fairly forgot Mrs. Server, I fear, in the\nintimacy of this vision of the possibilities of our common nature. She\nbecame such a wasted and dishonoured symbol of them as might have put\ntears in one's eyes. When I presently returned to her--our session\nseeming to resolve itself into a mere mildness of silence--I saw how it\nwas that whereas, in such cases in general, people might have given up\nmuch, the sort of person this poor lady was could only give up\neverything. She was the absolute wreck of her storm, accordingly, but to\nwhich the pale ghost of a special sensibility still clung, waving from\nthe mast, with a bravery that went to the heart, the last tatter of its\nflag. There are impressions too fine for words, and I shall not attempt\nto say how it was that under the touch of this one I felt how nothing\nthat concerned my companion could ever again be present to me but the\nfact itself of her admirable state. This was the source of her wan\nlittle glory, constituted even for her a small sublimity in the light of\nwhich mere minor identifications turned vulgar. I knew who _he_ was now\nwith a vengeance, because I had learnt precisely from that who _she_\nwas; and nothing could have been sharper than the force with which it\npressed upon me that I had really learnt more than I had bargained for.\nNothing need have happened if I hadn't been so absurdly, so fatally\nmeditative about poor Long--an accident that most people, wiser people,\nappeared on the whole to have steered sufficiently clear of. Compared\nwith my actual sense, the sense with which I sat there, that other\nvision was gross, and grosser still the connection between the two.\n\nSuch were some of the reflections in which I indulged while her\neyes--with their strange intermissions of darkness or of light: who\ncould say which?--told me from time to time that she knew whatever I\nwas thinking of to be for her virtual advantage. It was prodigious what,\nin the way of suppressed communication, passed in these wonderful\nminutes between us. Our relation could be at the best but an equal\nconfession, and I remember saying to myself that if she had been as\nsubtle as I--which she wasn't!--she too would have put it together that\nI had dreadfully talked about her. She would have traced in me my\ndemonstration to Mrs. Briss that, whoever she was, she must logically\nhave been idiotised. It was the special poignancy of her collapse that,\nso far at least as I was concerned, this was a ravage the extent of\nwhich she had ceased to try to conceal. She had been trying, and more or\nless succeeding, all day: the little drama of her public unrest had had,\nwhen one came to consider, no other argument. It had been terror that\nhad directed her steps; the need constantly to show herself detached and\nfree, followed by the sterner one not to show herself, by the same\ntoken, limp and empty. This had been the distinct, ferocious logic of\nher renewals and ruptures--the anxious mistrust of her wit, the haunting\nknowledge of the small distance it would take her at once, the\nconsequent importance of her exactly timing herself, and the quick\ninstinct of flight before the menace of discovery. She couldn't let\nsociety alone, because that would have constituted a symptom; yet, for\nfear of the appearance of a worse one, she could only mingle in it with\na complex diplomacy. She was accordingly exposed on every side, and to\nbe with her a while thus quietly was to read back into her behaviour the\nwhole explanation, which was positively simple to me now. To take up\nagain the vivid analogy, she had been sailing all day, though scarce\nable to keep afloat, under the flag of her old reputation for easy\nresponse. She had given to the breeze any sad scrap of a substitute, for\nthe play of mind once supposed remarkable. The last of all the things\nher stillness said to me was that I could judge from so poor a show what\nhad become of her conversability. What I did judge was that a frantic\nart had indeed been required to make her pretty silences pass, from one\ncrisis to another, for pretty speeches. Half this art, doubtless, was\nthe glittering deceit of her smile, the sublime, pathetic overdone\ngeniality which represented so her share in any talk that, every other\neloquence failing, there could only be nothing at all from the moment it\nabandoned its office. There _was_ nothing at all. That was the truth; in\naccordance with which I finally--for everything it might mean to\nmyself--put out my hand and bore ever so gently on her own. Her own\nrested listlessly on the stone of our seat. Of course, it had been an\nimmense thing for her that she was, in spite of everything, so lovely.\n\nAll this was quite consistent with its eventually coming back to me\nthat, though she took from me with appreciation what was expressed in\nthe gesture I have noted, it was certainly in quest of a still deeper\nrelief that she had again come forth. The more I considered her\nface--and most of all, so permittedly, in her passive, conscious\npresence--the more I was sure of this and the further I could go in the\nimagination of her beautiful duplicity. I ended by divining that if I\nwas assuredly good for her, because the question of keeping up with me\nhad so completely dropped, and if the service I so rendered her was not\nless distinct to her than to myself--I ended by divining that she had\nnone the less her obscure vision of a still softer ease. Guy Brissenden\nhad become in these few hours her positive need--a still greater need\nthan I had lately amused myself with making out that he had found her.\nEach had, by their unprecedented plight, something for the other, some\nintimacy of unspeakable confidence, that no one else in the world could\nhave for either. They had been feeling their way to it, but at the end\nof their fitful day they had grown confusedly, yet beneficently sure.\nThe explanation here again was simple--they had the sense of a common\nfate. They hadn't to name it or to phrase it--possibly even couldn't had\nthey tried; peace and support came to them, without that, in the simple\nrevelation of each other. Oh, how I made it out that if it was indeed\nvery well for the poor lady to feel thus in _my_ company that her burden\nwas lifted, my company would be after all but a rough substitute for\nGuy's! He was a still better friend, little as he could have told the\nreason; and if I could in this connection have put the words into her\nmouth, here follows something of the sense that I should have made them\nform.\n\n\"Yes, my dear man, I do understand you--quite perfectly now, and (by I\nknow not what miracle) I've really done so to some extent from the\nfirst. Deep is the rest of feeling with you, in this way, that I'm\nwatched, for the time, only as you watch me. It has all stopped, and _I_\ncan stop. How can I make you understand what it is for me that there\nisn't at last a creature any more in sight, that the wood darkens about\nme, that the sounds drop and the relief goes on; what can it mean for\nyou even that I've given myself up to not caring whether or no, amongst\nothers, I'm missed and spoken of? It does help my strange case, in fine,\nas you see, to let you keep me here; but I should have found still more\nwhat I was in need of if I had only found, instead of you, him whom I\nhad in mind. He is as much better than you as you are than everyone\nelse.\" I finally felt, in a word, so qualified to attribute to my\ncompanion some such mute address as that, that it could only have, as\nthe next consequence, a determining effect on me--an effect under the\ninfluence of which I spoke. \"I parted with him, some way from here, some\ntime ago. I had found him in one of the gardens with Lady John; after\nwhich we came away from her together. We strolled a little and talked,\nbut I knew what he really wanted. He wanted to find you, and I told him\nhe would probably do so at tea on the terrace. It was visibly with that\nidea--to return to the house--that he left me.\"\n\nShe looked at me for some time on this, taking it in, yet still afraid\nof it. \"You found him with Lady John?\" she at last asked, and with a\nnote in her voice that made me see what--as there was a precaution I had\nneglected--she feared.\n\nThe perception of this, in its turn, operated with me for an instant\nalmost as the rarest of temptations. I had puzzled out everything and\nput everything together; I was as morally confident and as\nintellectually triumphant as I have frankly here described myself; but\nthere was no objective test to which I had yet exposed my theory. The\nchance to apply one--and it would be infallible--had suddenly cropped\nup. There would be excitement, amusement, discernment in it; it would be\nindeed but a more roundabout expression of interest and sympathy. It\nwould, above all, pack the question I had for so many hours been\noccupied with into the compass of a needle-point. I was dazzled by my\nopportunity. She had had an uncertainty, in other words, as to whom I\nmeant, and that it kept her for some seconds on the rack was a trifle\ncompared to my chance. She would give herself away supremely if she\nshowed she suspected me of placing my finger on the spot--if she\nunderstood the person I had not named to be nameable as Gilbert Long.\nWhat had created her peril, of course, was my naming Lady John. Well,\nhow can I say in any sufficient way how much the extraordinary beauty of\nher eyes during this brevity of suspense had to do with the event? It\nhad everything--for it was what caused me to be touched beyond even what\nI had already been, and I could literally bear no more of that. I\ntherefore took no advantage, or took only the advantage I had spoken\nwith the intention of taking. I laughed out doubtless too nervously, but\nit didn't compromise my tact. \"Don't you know how she's perpetually\npouncing on him?\"\n\nStill, however, I had not named him--which was what prolonged the\ntension. \"Do you mean--a--do you mean----?\" With which she broke off on\na small weak titter and a still weaker exclamation. \"There are so _many_\ngentlemen!\"\n\nThere was something in it that might in other conditions have been as\ntrivial as the giggle of a housemaid; but it had in fact for my ear the\nsilver ring of poetry. I told her instantly whom I meant. \"Poor Briss,\nyou know,\" I said, \"is always in her clutches.\"\n\nOh, how it let her off! And yet, no sooner had it done so and had I\nthereby tasted on the instant the sweetness of my wisdom, than I became\naware of something much more extraordinary. It let her off--she showed\nme this for a minute, in spite of herself; but the next minute she\nshowed me something quite different, which was, most wonderful of all,\nthat she wished me to see her as not quite feeling why I should so much\ntake for granted the person I _had_ named. \"Poor Briss?\" her face and\nmanner appeared suddenly to repeat--quite, moreover (and it was the\ndrollest, saddest part), as if all our friends had stood about us to\nlisten. Wherein did poor Briss so intimately concern her? What, pray,\nwas my ground for such free reference to poor Briss? She quite\nrepudiated poor Briss. She knew nothing at all about him, and the whole\nairy structure I had erected with his aid might have crumbled at the\ntouch she thus administered if its solidity had depended only on that. I\nhad a minute of surprise which, had it lasted another minute as surprise\npure and simple, might almost as quickly have turned to something like\nchagrin. Fortunately it turned instead into something even more like\nenthusiasm than anything I had yet felt. The stroke _was_ extraordinary,\nbut extraordinary for its nobleness. I quickly saw in it, from the\nmoment I had got my point of view, more fine things than ever. I saw for\ninstance that, magnificently, she wished not to incriminate him. All\nthat had passed between us had passed in silence, but it was a different\nmatter for what might pass in sound. We looked at each other therefore\nwith a strained smile over any question of identities. It was as if it\nhad been one thing--to her confused, relaxed intensity--to give herself\nup to me, but quite another thing to give up somebody else.\n\nAnd yet, superficially arrested as I was for the time, I directly\nafterwards recognised in this instinctive discrimination--the last, the\nexpiring struggle of her native lucidity--a supremely convincing bit of\nevidence. It was still more convincing than if she had done any of the\ncommon things--stammered, changed colour, shown an apprehension of what\nthe person named might have said to me. She had had it from me that he\nand I had talked about her, but there was nothing that she accepted the\nidea of his having been able to say. I saw--still more than this--that\nthere was nothing to my purpose (since my purpose was to understand)\nthat she would have had, as matters stood, coherence enough to impute to\nhim. It was extremely curious to me to divine, just here, that she\nhadn't a glimmering of the real logic of Brissenden's happy effect on\nher nerves. It was the effect, as coming from him, that a beautiful\ndelicacy forbade her as yet to give me her word for; and she was\ncertainly herself in the stage of regarding it as an anomaly. Why, on\nthe contrary, I might have wondered, shouldn't she have jumped at the\nchance, at the comfort, of seeing a preference trivial enough to be\n\"worked\" imputed to her? Why shouldn't she have been positively pleased\nthat people might helpfully couple her name with that of the wrong man?\nWhy, in short, in the language that Grace Brissenden and I had used\ntogether, was not that lady's husband the perfection of a red herring?\nJust because, I perceived, the relation that had established itself\nbetween them _was_, for its function, a real relation, the relation of a\nfellowship in resistance to doom.\n\nNothing could have been stranger than for _me_ so to know it was while\nthe stricken parties themselves were in ignorance; but nothing, at the\nsame time, could have been, as I have since made out, more magnanimous\nthan Mrs. Server's attitude. She moved, groping and panting, in the\ngathering dusk of her fate, but there were calculations she still could\ndimly make. One of these was that she must drag no one else in. I verily\nbelieve that, for that matter, she had scruples, poignant and exquisite,\neven about letting our friend himself see how much she liked to be with\nhim. She wouldn't, at all events, let another see. I saw what I saw, I\nfelt what I felt, but such things were exactly a sign that I could take\ncare of myself. There was apparently, I was obliged to admit, but little\napprehension in her of her unduly showing that _our_ meeting had been\nanything of a blessing to her. There was no one indeed just then to be\nthe wiser for it; I might perhaps else even have feared that she would\nhave been influenced to treat the incident as closed. I had, for that\nmatter, no wish to prolong it beyond her own convenience; it had already\ntold me everything it could possibly tell. I thought I knew moreover\nwhat she would have got from it. I preferred, none the less, that we\nshould separate by my own act; I wanted not to see her move in order to\nbe free of me. So I stood up, to put her more at her ease, and it was\nwhile I remained before her that I tried to turn to her advantage what I\nhad committed myself to about Brissenden.\n\n\"I had a fancy, at any rate, that he was looking for you--all the more\nthat he didn't deny it.\"\n\nShe had not moved; she had let me take my hand from her own with as\nlittle sign as on her first feeling its touch. She only kept her eyes on\nme. \"What made you have such a fancy?\"\n\n\"What makes me ever have any?\" I laughed. \"My extraordinary interest in\nmy fellow-creatures. I have more than most men. I've never really seen\nanyone with half so much. That breeds observation, and observation\nbreeds ideas. Do you know what it has done?\" I continued. \"It has bred\nfor me the idea that Brissenden's in love with you.\"\n\nThere was something in her eyes that struck me as betraying--and the\nappeal of it went to the heart--the constant dread that if entangled in\ntalk she might show confusion. Nevertheless she brought out after a\nmoment, as naturally and charmingly as possible: \"How can that be when\nhe's so strikingly in love with his wife?\"\n\nI gave her the benefit of the most apparent consideration. \"Strikingly,\nyou call it?\"\n\n\"Why, I thought it was noticed--what he does for her.\"\n\n\"Well, of course she's extremely handsome--or at least extremely fresh\nand attractive. He _is_ in love with her, no doubt, if you take it by\nthe quarter, or by the year, like a yacht or a stable,\" I pushed on at\nrandom. \"But isn't there such a state also as being in love by the day?\"\n\nShe waited, and I guessed from the manner of it exactly why. It was the\nmost obscure of intimations that she would have liked better that I\nshouldn't make her talk; but obscurity, by this time, offered me no more\ndifficulties. The hint, none the less, a trifle disconcerted me, and,\nwhile I vaguely sought for some small provisional middle way between\ngoing and not going on, the oddest thing, as a fruit of my own delay,\noccurred. This was neither more nor less than the revival of her\nterrible little fixed smile. It came back as if with an audible\nclick--as a gas-burner makes a pop when you light it. It told me visibly\nthat from the moment she must talk she could talk only with its aid. The\neffect of its aid I indeed immediately perceived.\n\n\"How do I know?\" she asked in answer to my question. \"I've never _been_\nin love.\"\n\n\"Not even by the day?\"\n\n\"Oh, a day's surely a long time.\"\n\n\"It is,\" I returned. \"But I've none the less, more fortunately than you,\nbeen in love for a whole one.\" Then I continued, from an impulse of\nwhich I had just become conscious and that was clearly the result of the\nheart-breaking facial contortion--heart-breaking, that is, when one knew\nwhat I knew--by which she imagined herself to represent the pleasant\ngive-and-take of society. This sense, for me, was a quick horror of\nforcing her, in such conditions, to talk at all. Poor Briss had\nmentioned to me, as an incident of his contact with her, his\napprehension of her breaking down; and now, at a touch, I saw what he\nhad meant. She _would_ break down if I didn't look out. I found myself\nthus, from one minute to the other, as greatly dreading it for her,\ndreading it indeed for both of us, as I might have dreaded some physical\naccident or danger, her fall from an unmanageable horse or the crack\nbeneath her of thin ice. It was impossible--that was the extraordinary\nimpression--to come too much to her assistance. We had each of us all,\nin our way, hour after hour, been, as goodnaturedly as unwittingly,\ngiving her a lift; yet what was the end of it but her still sitting\nthere to assure me of a state of gratitude--that she couldn't even\narticulate--for every hint of a perch that might still be held out?\nWhat could only, therefore, in the connection, strike me as indicated\nwas fairly to put into her mouth--if one might do so without showing too\nungracefully as alarmed--the words one might have guessed her to wish to\nuse were she able to use any. It was a small service of anticipation\nthat I tried to render her with as little of an air as possible of being\nremedial. \"I daresay you wonder,\" I remarked on these lines, \"why, at\nall, I should have thrust Brissenden in.\"\n\n\"Oh, I _do_ so wonder!\" she replied with the refined but exaggerated\nglee that is a frequent form in high companies and light colloquies. I\n_did_ help her--it was admirable to feel it. She liked my imposing on\nher no more complex a proposition. She liked my putting the thing to her\nso much better than she could have put it to me. But she immediately\nafterwards looked away as if--now that we _had_ put it, and it didn't\nmatter which of us best--we had nothing more to do with it. She gave me\na hint of drops and inconsequences that might indeed have opened up\nabysses, and all the while she smiled and smiled. Yet whatever she did\nor failed of, as I even then observed to myself, how she remained\nlovely! One's pleasure in that helped one somehow not to break down on\none's own side--since breaking down was in question--for commiseration.\nI didn't know what she might have hours of for the man--whoever he\nwas--to whom her sacrifice had been made; but I doubted if for any other\nperson she had ever been so beautiful as she was for me at these\nmoments. To have kept her so, to have made her more so--how might that\nresult of their relation not in fact have shone as a blinding light into\nthe eyes of her lover? What would he have been bound to make out in her\nafter all but her passion and her beauty? Wasn't it enough for such\nwonders as these to fill his consciousness? If they didn't fill\nmine--even though occupying so large a place in it--was that not only\nbecause I had not the direct benefit of them as the other party to the\nprodigy had it? They filled mine too, for that matter, just at this\njuncture, long enough for me to describe myself as rendered subject by\nthem to a temporary loss of my thread. What _could_ pass muster with her\nas an account of my reason for evoking the blighted identity of our\nfriend? There came constantly into her aspect, I should say, the\nstrangest alternatives, as I can only most conveniently call them, of\npresence and absence--something like intermissions of intensity,\ncessations and resumptions of life. They were like the slow flickers of\na troubled flame, breathed upon and then left, burning up and burning\ndown. She had really burnt down--I mean so far as her sense of things\nwent--while I stood there.\n\nI stood long enough to see that it didn't in the least signify whether\nor no I explained, and during this interval I found myself--to my\nsurprise--in receipt of still better assistance than any I had to give.\nI had happened to turn, while I awkwardly enough, no doubt, rested and\nshifted, to the quarter from which Mrs. Server had arrived; and there,\njust at the end of the same vista, I gathered material for my proper\nreply. Her eyes at this moment were fixed elsewhere, and that gave me\nstill a little more time, at the end of which my reference had all its\npoint. \"I supposed you to have Brissenden in your head,\" I said,\n\"because it's evidently what he himself takes for granted. But let him\ntell you!\" He was already close to us: missing her at the house, he had\nstarted again in search of her and had successfully followed. The effect\non him of coming in sight of us had been for an instant to make him hang\nback as I had seen Mrs. Server hang. But he had then advanced just as\nshe had done; I had waited for him to reach us; and now she saw him. She\nlooked at him as she always looked at all of us, yet not at either of us\nas if we had lately been talking of him. If it was vacancy it was\neloquent; if it was vigilance it was splendid. What was most curious, at\nall events, was that it was now poor Briss who was disconcerted. He had\ncounted on finding her, but not on finding her with me, and I\ninterpreted a certain ruefulness in him as the sign of a quick, uneasy\nsense that he must have been in question between us. I instantly felt\nthat the right thing was to let him know he had been, and I mentioned to\nhim, as a joke, that he had come just in time to save himself. We had\nbeen talking of him, and I wouldn't answer for what Mrs. Server had been\ngoing to say. He took it gravely, but he took everything so gravely that\nI saw no symptom in that. In fact, as he appeared at first careful not\nto meet my eyes, I saw for a minute or two no symptom in anything--in\nanything, at least, but the way in which, standing beside me and before\nMrs. Server's bench, he received the conscious glare of her recognition\nwithout returning it and without indeed giving her a look. He looked all\nabout--looked, as she herself had done after our meeting, at the\ncharming place and its marks of the hour, at the rich twilight, deeper\nnow in the avenues, and at the tree-tops and sky, more flushed now with\ncolour. I found myself of a sudden quite as sorry for him as I had been\nfor Mrs. Server, and I scarce know how it was suggested to me that\nduring the short interval since our separation something had happened\nthat made a difference in him. Was the difference a consciousness still\nmore charged than I had left it? I couldn't exactly say, and the\nquestion really lost itself in what soon came uppermost for me--the\ndesire, above all, to spare them both and to spare them equally.\n\nThe difficulty, however, was to spare them in some fashion that would\nnot be more marked than continuing to observe them. To leave them\ntogether without a decent pretext would be marked; but this, I eagerly\nrecognised, was none the less what most concerned me. Whatever they\nmight see in it, there was by this time little enough doubt of how it\nwould indicate for my own mind that the wheel had completely turned.\nThat was the point to which I had been brought by the lapse of a few\nhours. I had verily travelled far since the sight of the pair on the\nterrace had given its arrest to my first talk with Mrs. Briss. I was\nobliged to admit to myself that nothing could very well have been more\nsingular than some of my sequences. I had come round to the opposite\npole of the protest my companion had then drawn from me--which was the\npole of agreement with herself; and it hung sharply before me that I was\npledged to confess to her my revolution. I couldn't now be in the\npresence of the two creatures I was in the very act of finally judging\nto be not a whit less stricken than I had originally imagined them--I\ncouldn't do this and think with any complacency of the redemption of my\npledge; for the process by which I had at last definitely inculpated\nMrs. Server was precisely such a process of providential supervision as\nmade me morally responsible, so to speak, for her, and thereby\nintensified my scruples. Well, my scruples had the last word--they were\nwhat determined me to look at my watch and profess that, whatever sense\nof a margin Brissenden and Mrs. Server might still enjoy, it behoved me\nnot to forget that I took, on such great occasions, an hour to dress for\ndinner. It was a fairly crude cover for my retreat; perhaps indeed I\nshould rather say that my retreat was practically naked and unadorned.\nIt formulated their relation. I left them with the formula on their\nhands, both queerly staring at it, both uncertain what to do with it.\nFor some passage that would soon be a correction of this, however, one\nmight surely feel that one could trust them. I seemed to feel my trust\njustified, behind my back, before I had got twenty yards away. By the\ntime I had done this, I must add, something further had befallen me.\nPoor Briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight, and it was then I\nsatisfied myself of what had happened to him at the house. He had met\nhis wife; she had in some way dealt with him; he had been with her,\nhowever briefly, alone; and the intimacy of their union had been afresh\nimpressed upon him. Poor Briss, in fine, looked ten years older.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nI shall never forget the impressions of that evening, nor the way, in\nparticular, the immediate effect of some of them was to merge the light\nof my extravagant perceptions in a glamour much more diffused. I\nremember feeling seriously warned, while dinner lasted, not to yield\nfurther to my idle habit of reading into mere human things an interest\nso much deeper than mere human things were in general prepared to\nsupply. This especial hour, at Newmarch, had always a splendour that\nasked little of interpretation, that even carried itself, with an\namiable arrogance, as indifferent to what the imagination could do for\nit. I think the imagination, in those halls of art and fortune, was\nalmost inevitably accounted a poor matter; the whole place and its\nparticipants abounded so in pleasantness and picture, in all the\nfelicities, for every sense, taken for granted there by the very basis\nof life, that even the sense most finely poetic, aspiring to extract the\nmoral, could scarce have helped feeling itself treated to something of\nthe snub that affects--when it does affect--the uninvited reporter in\nwhose face a door is closed. I said to myself during dinner that these\nwere scenes in which a transcendent intelligence had after all no\napplication, and that, in short, any preposterous acuteness might easily\nsuffer among them such a loss of dignity as overtakes the newspaper-man\nkicked out. We existed, all of us together, to be handsome and happy, to\nbe really what we looked--since we looked tremendously well; to be that\nand neither more nor less, so not discrediting by musty secrets and\naggressive doubts our high privilege of harmony and taste. We were\nconcerned only with what was bright and open, and the expression that\nbecame us all was, at worst, that of the shaded but gratified eye, the\nair of being forgivingly dazzled by too much lustre.\n\nMrs. Server, at table, was out of my range, but I wondered if, had she\nnot been so, I shouldn't now have been moved to recognise in her fixed\nexpressiveness nothing more than our common reciprocal tribute. Hadn't\neveryone my eyes could at present take in a fixed expressiveness? Was I\nnot very possibly myself, on this ground of physiognomic congruity, more\nphysiognomic than anyone else? I made my excellence, on the chance, go\nas far as it would to cover my temporary doubts. I saw Mrs. Brissenden,\nin another frock, naturally, and other jewels from those of the evening\nbefore; but she gave me, across the board, no more of a look than if she\nhad quite done with me. It struck me that she felt she _had_ done--that,\nas to the subject of our discussion, she deemed her case by this time\nso established as to offer comparatively little interest. I couldn't\ncome to her to renew the discussion; I could only come to her to make my\nsubmission; and it doubtless appeared to her--to do her justice--more\ndelicate not to triumph over me in advance. The profession of joy,\nhowever, reigned in her handsome face none the less largely for my not\nhaving the benefit of it. If I seem to falsify my generalisation by\nacknowledging that her husband, on the same side, made no more public\nprofession of joy than usual, I am still justified by the fact that\nthere was something in a manner decorative even in Brissenden's wonted\ngloom. He reminded me at this hour more than ever of some fine old\nVelasquez or other portrait--a presentation of ugliness and melancholy\nthat might have been royal. There was as little of the common in his\ndry, distinguished patience as in the case I had made out for him.\nBlighted and ensconed, he looked at it over the rigid convention, his\npeculiar perfection of necktie, shirt-front and waistcoat, as some aged\nremnant of sovereignty at the opera looks over the ribbon of an order\nand the ledge of a box.\n\nI must add, however, that in spite of my sense of his wife's indulgence\nI kept quite aware of the nearer approach, as course followed course, of\nmy hour of reckoning with her--more and more saw the moment of the\nevening at which, frankly amused at last at having me in a cleft stick,\nshe would draw me a little out of the throng. Of course, also, I was\nmuch occupied in asking myself to what degree I was prepared to be\nperjured. _Was_ I ready to pretend that my candour was still\nunconvinced? And was I in this case only instinctively mustering my\narguments? I was certainly as sorry that Mrs. Server was out of my view\nas if I proposed still to fight; and I really felt, so far as that went,\nas if there might be something to fight for after the lady on my left\nhad given me a piece of news. I had asked her if she happened to know,\nas we couldn't see, who was next Mrs. Server, and, though unable to say\nat the moment, she made no scruple, after a short interval, of\nascertaining with the last directness. The stretch forward in which she\nhad indulged, or the information she had caused to be passed up to her\nwhile I was again engaged on my right, established that it was Lord\nLutley who had brought the lovely lady in and that it was Mr. Long who\nwas on her other side. These things indeed were not the finest point of\nmy companion's communication, for I saw that what she felt I would be\nreally interested in was the fact that Mr. Long had brought in Lady\nJohn, who was naturally, therefore, his other neighbour. Beyond Lady\nJohn was Mr. Obert, and beyond Mr. Obert Mrs. Froome, not, for a wonder,\nthis time paired, as by the immemorial tradition, so fairly comical in\nits candour, with Lord Lutley. Wasn't it too funny, the kind of\ngrandmotherly view of their relation shown in their always being put\ntogether? If I perhaps questioned whether \"grandmotherly\" were exactly\nthe name for the view, what yet at least was definite in the light of\nthis evening's arrangement was that there did occur occasions on which\nthey were put apart. My friend of course disposed of this observation by\nthe usual exception that \"proved the rule\"; but it was absurd how I had\nthrilled with her announcement, and our exchange of ideas meanwhile\nhelped to carry me on.\n\nMy theory had not at all been framed to embrace the phenomenon thus\npresented; it had been precisely framed, on the contrary, to hang\ntogether with the observed inveteracy of escape, on the part of the two\npersons about whom it busied itself, from public juxtaposition of more\nthan a moment. I was fairly upset by the need to consider at this late\nhour whether going in for a new theory or bracing myself for new facts\nwould hold out to me the better refuge. It is perhaps not too much to\nsay that I should scarce have been able to sit still at all but for the\nsupport afforded me by the oddity of the separation of Lord Lutley and\nMrs. Froome; which, though resting on a general appearance directly\nopposed to that of my friends, offered somehow the relief of a\nsuggestive analogy. What I could directly clutch at was that if the\nexception did prove the rule in the one case it might equally prove it\nin the other. If on a rare occasion one of these couples might be\ndivided, so, by as uncommon a chance, the other might be joined; the\nonly difference being in the gravity of the violated law. For which pair\nwas the betrayal greatest? It was not till dinner was nearly ended and\nthe ladies were about to withdraw that I recovered lucidity to make out\nhow much more machinery would have had to be put into motion\nconsistently to prevent, than once in a way to minimise, the\ndisconcerting accident.\n\nAll accidents, I must add, were presently to lose themselves in the\nunexpectedness of my finding myself, before we left the dining-room, in\neasy talk with Gilbert Long--talk that was at least easy for _him_,\nwhatever it might have struck me as necessarily destined to be for me. I\nfelt as he approached me--for he did approach me--that it was somehow\n\"important\"; I was so aware that something in the state of my conscience\nwould have prevented me from assuming conversation between us to be at\nthis juncture possible. The state of my conscience was that I knew too\nmuch--that no one had really any business to know what I knew. If he\nsuspected but the fiftieth part of it there was no simple spirit in\nwhich he could challenge me. It would have been simple of course to\ndesire to knock me down, but that was barred by its being simple to\nexcess. It wouldn't even have been enough for him merely to ground it\non a sudden fancy. It fitted, in fine, with my cogitations that it was\nso significant for him to wish to speak to me that I didn't envy him his\nattempt at the particular shade of assurance required for carrying the\nthing off. He would have learned from Mrs. Server that I was not, as\nregarded them, at all as others were; and thus his idea, the fruit of\nthat stimulation, could only be either to fathom, to felicitate, or--as\nit were--to destroy me. What was at the same time obvious was that no\none of these attitudes would go quite of itself. The simple sight of him\nas he quitted his chair to take one nearer my own brought home to me in\na flash--and much more than anything had yet done--the real existence in\nhim of the condition it was my private madness (none the less private\nfor Grace Brissenden's so limited glimpse of it,) to believe I had\ncoherently stated. Is not this small touch perhaps the best example I\ncan give of the intensity of amusement I had at last enabled my private\nmadness to yield me? I found myself owing it, from this time on and for\nthe rest of the evening, moments of the highest concentration.\n\nWhatever there might have been for me of pain or doubt was washed\nstraight out by the special sensation of seeing how \"clever\" poor Long\nnot only would have to be, but confidently and actually _was_; inasmuch\nas this apprehension seemed to put me in possession of his cleverness,\nbesides leaving me all my own. I made him welcome, I helped him to\nanother cigarette, I felt above all that I should enjoy him; my response\nto his overture was, in other words, quickly enough to launch us. Yet I\nfear I can do little justice to the pleasant suppressed tumult of\nimpression and reflection that, on my part, our ten minutes together\nproduced. The elements that mingled in it scarce admit of\ndiscrimination. It was still more than previously a deep sense of being\njustified. My interlocutor was for those ten minutes immeasurably\nsuperior--superior, I mean, to himself--and he couldn't possibly have\nbecome so save through the relation I had so patiently tracked. He faced\nme there with another light than his own, spoke with another sound,\nthought with another ease and understood with another ear. I should put\nit that what came up between us was the mere things of the occasion,\nwere it not for the fine point to which, in my view, the things of the\noccasion had been brought. While our eyes, at all events, on either\nside, met serenely, and our talk, dealing with the idea, dealing with\nthe extraordinary special charm, of the social day now deepening to its\nend, touched our companions successively, touched the manner in which\nthis one and that had happened to be predominantly a part of that charm;\nwhile such were our immediate conditions I wondered of course if he had\nnot, just as consciously and essentially as I, quite another business\nin mind. It was not indeed that our allusion to the other business would\nnot have been wholly undiscoverable by a third person.\n\nSo far as it took place it was of a \"subtlety,\" as we used to say at\nNewmarch, in relation to which the common register of that pressure\nwould have been, I fear, too old-fashioned a barometer. I had moreover\nthe comfort--for it amounted to that--of perceiving after a little that\nwe understood each other too well for our understanding really to have\ntolerated the interference of passion, such passion as would have been\nrepresented on his side by resentment of my intelligence and on my side\nby resentment of his. The high sport of such intelligence--between\ngentlemen, to the senses of any other than whom it must surely be\nclosed--demanded and implied in its own intimate interest a certain\namenity. Yes, accordingly, I had promptly got the answer that my wonder\nat his approach required: he had come to me for the high sport. He would\nformerly have been incapable of it, and he was beautifully capable of it\nnow. It was precisely the kind of high sport--the play of perception,\nexpression, sociability--in which Mrs. Server would a year or two before\nhave borne as light a hand. I need scarcely add how little it would have\nfound itself in that lady's present chords. He had said to me in our ten\nminutes everything amusing she couldn't have said. Yet if when our host\ngave us the sign to adjourn to the drawing-room so much as all this had\ngrown so much clearer, I had still, figuratively speaking, a small nut\nor two left to crack. By the time we moved away together, however, these\nresistances had yielded. The answers had really only been waiting for\nthe questions. The play of Long's mind struck me as more marked, since\nthe morning, by the same amount, as it might have been called, as the\nmarch of poor Briss's age; and if I had, a while before, in the wood,\nhad my explanation of this latter addition, so I had it now of the\nformer--as to which I shall presently give it.\n\nWhen music, in English society, as we know, is not an accompaniment to\nthe voice, the voice can in general be counted on to assert its pleasant\nidentity as an accompaniment to music; but at Newmarch we had been\nconsiderably schooled, and this evening, in the room in which most of us\nhad assembled, an interesting pianist, who had given a concert the night\nbefore at the near county town and been brought over during the day to\ndine and sleep, would scarce have felt in any sensitive fibre that he\nwas not having his way with us. It may just possibly have been an\nhallucination of my own, but while we sat together after dinner in a\ndispersed circle I could have worked it out that, as a company, we were\nconsiderably conscious of some experience, greater or smaller from one\nof us to the other, that had prepared us for the player's spell.\nFelicitously scattered and grouped, we might in almost any case have had\nthe air of looking for a message from it--of an imagination to be\nflattered, nerves to be quieted, sensibilities to be soothed. The whole\nscene was as composed as if there were scarce one of us but had a secret\nthirst for the infinite to be quenched. And it was the infinite that,\nfor the hour, the distinguished foreigner poured out to us, causing it\nto roll in wonderful waves of sound, almost of colour, over our\nreceptive attitudes and faces. Each of us, I think, now wore the\nexpression--or confessed at least to the suggestion--of some\nindescribable thought; which might well, it was true, have been nothing\nmore unmentionable than the simple sense of how the posture of deference\nto this noble art has always a certain personal grace to contribute. We\nneglected nothing of it that could make our general effect ample, and\nwhether or no we were kept quiet by the piano, we were at least\nadmonished, to and fro, by our mutual visibility, which each of us\nclearly, desired to make a success. I have little doubt, furthermore,\nthat to each of us was due, as the crown of our inimitable day, the\nimputation of having something quite of our own to think over.\n\nWe thought, accordingly--we continued to think, and I felt that, by the\nlaw of the occasion, there had as yet been for everyone no such\nsovereign warrant for an interest in the private affairs of everyone\nelse. As a result of this influence all that at dinner had begun to fade\naway from me came back with a rush and hovered there with a vividness. I\nfollowed many trains and put together many pieces; but perhaps what I\nmost did was to render a fresh justice to the marvel of our civilised\nstate. The perfection of that, enjoyed as we enjoyed it, all made a\nmargin, a series of concentric circles of rose-colour (shimmering away\ninto the pleasant vague of everything else that didn't matter,) for the\nso salient little figure of Mrs. Server, still the controlling image for\nme, the real principle of composition, in this affluence of fine things.\nWhat, for my part, while I listened, I most made out was the beauty and\nthe terror of conditions so highly organised that under their rule her\nsmall lonely fight with disintegration could go on without the betrayal\nof a gasp or a shriek, and with no worse tell-tale contortion of lip or\nbrow than the vibration, on its golden stem, of that constantly renewed\nflower of amenity which my observation had so often and so mercilessly\ndetached only to find again in its place. This flower nodded perceptibly\nenough in our deeply stirred air, but there was a peace, none the less,\nin feeling the spirit of the wearer to be temporarily at rest. There was\nfor the time no gentleman on whom she need pounce, no lapse against\nwhich she need guard, no presumption she need create, nor any suspicion\nshe need destroy. In this pause in her career it came over me that I\nshould have liked to leave her; it would have prepared for me the\npleasant after-consciousness that I had seen her pass, as I might say,\nin music out of sight.\n\nBut we were, alas! all too much there, too much tangled and involved for\nthat; every actor in the play that had so unexpectedly insisted on\nconstituting itself for me sat forth as with an intimation that they\nwere not to be so easily disposed of. It was as if there were some last\nact to be performed before the curtain could fall. Would the definite\ndramatic signal for ringing the curtain down be then only--as a grand\nclimax and _coup de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_--the due attestation that poor Briss had\nsuccumbed to inexorable time and Mrs. Server given way under a cerebral\nlesion? Were the rest of us to disperse decorously by the simple action\nof the discovery that, on our pianist's striking his last note, with its\nconsequence of permitted changes of attitude, Gilbert Long's victim had\nreached the point of final simplification and Grace Brissenden's the\nlimit of age recorded of man? I could look at neither of these persons\nwithout a sharper sense of the contrast between the tragedy of their\npredicament and the comedy of the situation that did everything for them\nbut suspect it. They had truly been arrayed and anointed, they had\ntruly been isolated, for their sacrifice. I was sufficiently aware even\nthen that if one hadn't known it one might have seen nothing; but I was\nnot less aware that one couldn't know anything without seeing all; and\nso it was that, while our pianist played, my wandering vision played and\nplayed as well. It took in again, while it went from one of them to the\nother, the delicate light that each had shed on the other, and it made\nme wonder afresh what still more delicate support they themselves might\nnot be in the very act of deriving from their dim community. It was for\nthe glimmer of this support that I had left them together two or three\nhours before; yet I was obliged to recognise that, travel between them\nas my fancy might, it could detect nothing in the way of a consequent\nresult. I caught no look from either that spoke to me of service\nrendered them; and I caught none, in particular, from one of them to the\nother, that I could read as a symptom of their having compared notes.\nThe fellow-feeling of each for the lost light of the other remained for\nme but a tie supposititious--the full-blown flower of my theory. It\nwould show here as another flower, equally mature, for me to have made\nout a similar dim community between Gilbert Long and Mrs. Brissenden--to\nbe able to figure them as groping side by side, proportionately, towards\na fellowship of light overtaken; but if I failed of this, for ideal\nsymmetry, that seemed to rest on the general truth that joy brings\npeople less together than sorrow.\n\nSo much for the course of my impressions while the music lasted--a\ncourse quite consistent with my being prepared for new combinations as\nsoon as it was over. Promptly, when that happened, the bow was unbent;\nand the combination I first seized, amid motion and murmur and rustle,\nwas that, once more, of poor Briss and Lady John, the latter of whom had\nalready profited by the general reaction to endeavour to cultivate\nafresh the vainest of her sundry appearances. She had laid on him the\nsame coercive hand to which I owed my having found him with her in the\nafternoon, but my intervention was now to operate with less ceremony. I\nchanced to be near enough to them for Brissenden, on seeing me, to fix\nhis eyes on me in silence, but in a manner that could only bring me\nimmediately nearer. Lady John never did anything in silence, but she\ngreeted me as I came up to them with a fine false alarm. \"No, indeed,\"\nshe cried, \"you shan't carry him off this time!\"--and poor Briss\ndisappeared, leaving us face to face, even while she breathed defiance.\nHe had made no joke of it, and I had from him no other recognition; it\nwas therefore a mere touch, yet it gave me a sensible hint that he had\nbegun, as things were going, to depend upon me, that I already in a\nfashion figured to him--and on amazingly little evidence after all--as\nhis natural protector, his providence, his effective omniscience. Like\nMrs. Server herself, he was materially on my hands, and it was proper I\nshould \"do\" for him. I wondered if he were really beginning to look to\nme to avert his inexorable fate. Well, if his inexorable fate was to be\nan unnameable climax, it had also its special phases, and one of these I\n_had_ just averted. I followed him a moment with my eyes, and I then\nobserved to Lady John that she decidedly took me for too simple a\nperson. She had meanwhile also watched the direction taken by her\nliberated victim, and was the next instant prepared with a reply to my\ncharge. \"Because he has gone to talk with May Server? I don't quite see\nwhat you mean, for I believe him really to be in terror of her. Most of\nthe men here _are_, you know, and I've really assured myself that he\ndoesn't find her any less awful than the rest. He finds her the more so\nby just the very marked extra attention that you may have noticed she\nhas given him.\"\n\n\"And does that now happen to be what he has so eagerly gone off to\nimpress upon her?\"\n\nLady John was so placed that she could continue to look at our friends,\nand I made out in her that she was not, in respect to them, without some\nslight elements of perplexity. These were even sufficient to make her\ntemporarily neglect the defence of the breach I had made in her\nconsistency. \"If you mean by 'impressing upon' her speaking to her, he\nhasn't gone--you can see for yourself--to impress upon her anything;\nthey have the most extraordinary way, which I've already observed, of\nsitting together without sound. I don't know,\" she laughed, \"what's the\nmatter with such people!\"\n\n\"It proves in general,\" I admitted, \"either some coldness or some\nwarmth, and I quite understand that that's not the way _you_ sit with\nyour friends. You steer admirably clear of every extravagance. I don't\nsee, at any rate, why Mrs. Server is a terror----\"\n\nBut she had already taken me up. \"If she doesn't chatter as _I_ do?\" She\nthought it over. \"But she does--to everyone but Mr. Briss. I mean to\nevery man she can pick up.\"\n\nI emulated her reflection. \"Do they complain of it to you?\"\n\n\"They're more civil than you,\" she returned; \"for if, when they flee\nbefore it, they bump up against me in their flight, they don't explain\nthat by intimating that they're come from bad to worse. Besides, I see\nwhat they suffer.\"\n\n\"And do you hear it?\"\n\n\"What they suffer? No, I've taken care not to suffer myself. I don't\nlisten. It's none of my business.\"\n\n\"Is that a way of gently expressing,\" I ventured to ask, \"that it's also\nnone of mine?\"\n\n\"It might be,\" she replied, \"if I had, as you appear to, the\nimagination of atrocity. But I don't pretend to so much as conceive\nwhat's your business.\"\n\n\"I wonder if it isn't just now,\" I said after a moment, \"to convict you\nof an attempt at duplicity that has not even had the saving grace of\nsuccess! Was it for Brissenden himself that you spoke just now as if you\nbelieved him to wish to cling to you?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm kind enough for anything,\" she goodnaturedly enough laughed.\n\"But what,\" she asked more sharply, \"are you trying to find out?\"\n\nSuch an awful lot, the answer to this would politely have been, that I\ndaresay the aptness of the question produced in my face a shade of\nembarrassment. I felt, however, the next moment that I needn't fear too\nmuch. What I, on approaching Lady John, had found myself moved to test,\nusing her in it as a happy touchstone, was the degree of the\nsurrounding, the latent, sense of things: an impulse confirmed by the\nmanner in which she had momentarily circled about the phenomenon of Mrs.\nServer's avidity, about the mystery of the terms made with it by our\nfriend. It was present to me that if I could catch, on the part of my\ninterlocutress, anything of a straight scent, I might take that as the\nmeasure of a diffused danger. I mentally applied this term to the\npossibility of diffusion, because I suddenly found myself thinking with\na kind of horror of any accident by which I might have to expose to the\nworld, to defend against the world, to share with the world, that now so\ncomplex tangle of hypotheses that I have had for convenience to speak of\nas my theory. I could toss the ball myself, I could catch it and send it\nback, and familiarity had now made this exercise--in my own inner\nprecincts--easy and safe. But the mere brush of Lady John's clumsier\ncuriosity made me tremble for the impunity of my creation. If there had\nbeen, so to speak, a discernment, however feeble, of _my_ discernment,\nit would have been irresistible to me to take this as the menace of some\nincalculable catastrophe or some public ugliness. It wasn't for me\ndefinitely to image the logical result of a verification by the sense of\nothers of the matter of my vision; but the thing had only to hang before\nme as a chance for me to feel that I should utterly object to it, though\nI may appear to weaken this statement if I add that the opportunity to\nfix the degree of my actual companion's betrayed mystification was\nalmost a spell. This, I conceive, was just by reason of what was at\nstake. How could I happily tell her what I was trying to find out?--tell\nher, that is, not too much for security and yet enough for relief? The\nbest answer seemed a brave jump. I was conscious of a certain credit\nopen with her in my appearance of intellectual sympathy.\n\n\"Well,\" I brought out at last, \"I'm quite aching to ask you if you'll\nforgive me a great liberty, which I owe to your candid challenge my\nopportunity to name. Will you allow me to say frankly that I think you\nplay a dangerous game with poor Briss, in whom I confess I'm interested?\nI don't of course speak of the least danger to yourself; but it's an\ninjustice to any man to make use of him quite so flagrantly. You don't\nin the least flatter yourself that the poor fellow is in love with\nyou--you wouldn't care a bit if he were. Yet you're willing to make him\nthink you like him, so far as that may be necessary to explain your so\nfrequently ingenious appropriation of him. He doesn't like you _too_\nmuch, as yet; doesn't even like you quite enough. But your potency may,\nafter all, work on him, and then, as your interest is so obviously quite\nelsewhere, what will happen will be that you'll find, to your\ninconvenience, that you've gone too far. A man never likes a woman\nenough unless he likes her _more_ than enough. Unfortunately it's what\nthe inveterate ass is sure sooner or later to do.\"\n\nLady John looked just enough interested to look detached from most of\nthe more vulgar liabilities to offence. \"Do I understand that to be the\npretty name by which you describe Mr. Briss?\"\n\n\"He has his share of it, for I'm thinking of the idiots that we everyone\nof us are. I throw out a warning against a contingency.\"\n\n\"Are you providing for the contingency of his ceasing to care for his\nwife? If you are\"--and Lady John's amusement took on a breadth--\"you\nmay be said to have a prudent mind and to be taking time by the\nforelock.\"\n\nAt this I pricked up my ears. \"Do you mean because of his apparently\nincorruptible constancy?\"\n\n\"I mean because the whole thing's so before one. She has him so in hand\nthat they're neither of them in as much danger as would count for a\nmouse. It doesn't prevent his liking to dally by the way--for _she_\ndallies by the way, and he does everything she does. Haven't I observed\nher,\" Lady John continued, \"dallying a little, so far as that goes, with\n_you_? You've the tact to tell me that he doesn't think me good enough,\nbut I don't require, do I?--for such a purpose as his--to be very\nextraordinarily good. You may say that you wrap it up immensely and try\nto sugar the dose! Well, all the same, give up, for a quiet life, the\nattempt to be a providence. You can't be a providence and not be a bore.\nA real providence _knows_; whereas you,\" said Lady John, making her\npoint neatly, \"have to find out--and to find out even by asking 'the\nlikes of' _me_. Your fine speech meanwhile doesn't a bit tell me what.\"\n\nIt affected me again that she could get so near without getting nearer.\nTrue enough it was that I wanted to find out; and though I might expect,\nor fear, too much of her, I wondered at her only seeing this--at her\nnot reading deeper. The peril of the public ugliness that haunted me\nrose or fell, at this moment, with my varying view of her density. Or\nrather, to be more exact, I already saw her as necessarily stupid\nbecause I saw her as extravagantly vain. What I see now of course is\nthat I was on my own side almost stupidly hard with her--as I may also\nat that hour have been subject to her other vice. Didn't I perhaps, in\nproportion as I felt how little she saw, think awfully well of myself,\nas we said at Newmarch, for seeing so much more? It comes back to me\nthat the sense thus established of my superior vision may perfectly have\ngone a little to my head. If it was a frenzied fallacy I was all to\nblame, but if it was anything else whatever it was naturally\nintoxicating. I really remember in fact that nothing so much as this\nconfirmed presumption of my impunity had appeared to me to mark the fine\nquality of my state. I think there must fairly have been a pitch at\nwhich I was not sure that not to partake of that state was, on the part\nof others, the sign of a gregarious vulgarity; as if there were a\npositive advantage, an undiluted bliss, in the intensity of\nconsciousness that I had reached. _I_ alone was magnificently and\nabsurdly aware--everyone else was benightedly out of it. So I reflected\nthat there would be almost nothing I mightn't with safety mention to my\npresent subject of practice as an acknowledgment that I was meddlesome.\nI could put no clue in her hand that her notorious acuteness would make\nof the smallest use to her. The most she could do would be to make it of\nuse to myself, and the clue it seemed best to select was therefore a\ncomplete confession of guilt.\n\n\"You've a lucidity of your own in which I'm forced to recognise that the\nhighest purity of motive looks shrivelled and black. You bring out\naccordingly what has made me thus beat about the bush. Have you really\nsuch a fund of indulgence for Gilbert Long as we most of us, I\ngather--though perhaps in our blindness--seem to see it stick out again\nthat he supposes? _May_ he fondly feel that he can continue to count on\nit? Or, if you object to my question in that form, is it not, frankly,\nto making his attitude--after all so thoroughly public--more convenient\nto each of you that (without perhaps quite measuring what you're about,)\nyou've gone on sacrificing poor Briss? I call it sacrificing, you see,\nin spite of there having been as yet no such great harm done. And if you\nask me again what business of mine such inquiries may represent, why,\nthe best thing will doubtless be to say to you that, with a smaller dose\nof irrepressible irony in my composition than you have in yours, I can't\nmake so light as you of my tendency to worry on behalf of those I care\nfor. Let me finally hasten to add that I'm not now including in that\ncategory either of the two gentlemen I've named.\"\n\nI freely concede, as I continue my record, that to follow me at all, at\nthis point, gave proof on Lady John's part of a faculty that should have\nprevented my thinking of her as inordinately backward. \"Then who in the\nworld _are_ these objects of your solicitude?\"\n\nI showed, over and above my hesitation, my regret for the need of it.\n\"I'm afraid I can't tell you.\"\n\nAt this, not unnaturally, she fairly scoffed. \"Asking me everything and\ntelling me nothing, you nevertheless look to me to satisfy you? Do you\nmean,\" she pursued, \"that you speak for persons whose interest is more\nlegitimately founded than the interest you so flatteringly attribute to\nmyself?\"\n\n\"Well, yes--let them be so described! Can't you guess,\" I further\nrisked, \"who constitutes at least _one_ of my preoccupations?\"\n\nThe condescension of her consent to think marked itself handsomely\nenough. \"Is it your idea to pretend to me that I'm keeping Grace\nBrissenden awake?\" There was consistency enough in her wonder. \"She has\nnot been anything but nice to me; she's not a person whose path one\ncrosses without finding it out; and I can't imagine what has got into\nher if any such grievance as that is what she has been pouring out to\nyou in your apparently so deep confabulations.\"\n\nThis toss of the ball was one that, I saw quickly enough, even a taste\nfor sport wouldn't justify my answering, and my logical interest lay\nmoreover elsewhere. \"Dear no! Mrs. Brissenden certainly feels her\nstrength, and I should never presume to take under my charge any\npersonal situation of hers. I had in my mind a very different identity.\"\n\nLady John, as if to be patient with me, looked about at our companions\nfor a hint of it, wondering which of the ladies I might have been\nsupposed to \"care for\" so much as to tolerate in her a preference for a\nrival; but the effect of this survey was, I the next instant observed, a\ndrop of her attention from what I had been saying. Her eye had been\ncaught by the sight of Gilbert Long within range of us, and then had\nbeen just visibly held by the fact that the person seated with him on\none of the small sofas that almost of necessity made conversation\nintimate was the person whose name, just uttered between us, was, in\ndefault of the name she was in search of, still in the air. Gilbert Long\nand Mrs. Briss were in familiar colloquy--though I was aware, at the\nfirst flush, of nothing in this that should have made my interlocutress\nstare. That is I was aware of nothing but that I had simultaneously\nmyself been moved to some increase of sharpness. What _could_ I have\nknown that should have caused me to wonder at the momentary existence of\nthis particular conjunction of minds unless it were simply the fact that\nI hadn't seen it occur amid the many conjunctions I had already\nnoticed--_plus_ the fact that I had a few minutes before, in the\ninterest of the full roundness of my theory, actually been missing it?\nThese two persons had met in my presence at Paddington and had travelled\ntogether under my eyes; I had talked of Mrs. Briss with Long and of Long\nwith Mrs. Briss; but the vivid picture that their social union forthwith\npresented stirred within me, though so strangely late in the day, it\nmight have seemed, for such an emotion, more than enough freshness of\nimpression. Yet--now that I did have it there--why should it be vivid,\nwhy stirring, why a picture at all? Was _any_ temporary collocation, in\na house so encouraging to sociability, out of the range of nature?\nIntensely prompt, I need scarcely say, were both my freshness and my\nperceived objections to it. The happiest objection, could I have taken\ntime to phrase it, would doubtless have been that the particular effect\nof this juxtaposition--to my eyes at least--was a thing not to have been\nforeseen. The parties to it looked, certainly, as I felt that I hadn't\nprefigured them; though even this, for my reason, was not a description\nof their aspect. Much less was it a description for the intelligence of\nLady John--to whom, however, after all, some formulation of what she\ndimly saw would not be so indispensable.\n\nWe briefly watched, at any rate, together, and as our eyes met again we\nmoreover confessed that we had watched. And we could ostensibly have\noffered each other no explanation of that impulse save that we had been\ntalking of those concerned as separate and that it was in consequence a\nlittle odd to find ourselves suddenly seeing them as one. For that was\nit--they _were_ as one; as one, at all events, for _my_ large reading.\nMy large reading had meanwhile, for the convenience of the rest of my\nlittle talk with Lady John, to make itself as small as possible. I had\nan odd sense, till we fell apart again, as of keeping my finger rather\nstiffly fixed on a passage in a favourite author on which I had not\npreviously lighted. I held the book out of sight and behind me; I spoke\nof things that were not at all in it--or not at all on that particular\npage; but my volume, none the less, was only waiting. What might be\nwritten there hummed already in my ears as a result of my mere glimpse.\nHad _they_ also wonderfully begun to know? Had _she_, most wonderfully,\nand had they, in that case, prodigiously come together on it? This was a\npossibility into which my imagination could dip even deeper than into\nthe depths over which it had conceived the other pair as hovering. These\nopposed couples balanced like bronze groups at the two ends of a\nchimney-piece, and the most I could say to myself in lucid deprecation\nof my thought was that I mustn't take them equally for granted merely\n_because_ they balanced. Things in the real had a way of not balancing;\nit was all an affair, this fine symmetry, of artificial proportion. Yet\neven while I kept my eyes away from Mrs. Briss and Long it was vivid to\nme that, \"composing\" there beautifully, they could scarce help playing a\npart in my exhibition. The mind of man, furthermore--and my\ngeneralisation pressed hard, with a quick twist, on the supersubtlety as\nto which I had just been privately complacent--the mind of man doubtless\ndidn't know from one minute to the other, under the appeal of\nphantasmagoric life, what it would profitably be at. It had struck me a\nfew seconds before as vulgarly gross in Lady John that she was curious,\nor conscious, of so small a part; in spite of which I was already\nsecretly wincing at the hint that these others had begun to find\nthemselves less in the dark and perhaps even directly to exchange their\nglimmerings.\n\nMy personal privilege, on the basis of the full consciousness, had\nbecome, on the spot, in the turn of an eye, more than questionable, and\nI was really quite scared at the chance of having to face--of having to\nsee _them_ face--another recognition. What did this alarm imply but the\ncomplete reversal of my estimate of the value of perception? Mrs.\nBrissenden and Long had been hitherto magnificently without it, and I\nwas responsible perhaps for having, in a mood practically much stupider\nthan the stupidest of theirs, put them gratuitously and helplessly _on_\nit. To be without it was the most consistent, the most successful,\nbecause the most amiable, form of selfishness; and why should people\nadmirably equipped for remaining so, people bright and insolent in their\nprior state, people in whom this state was to have been respected as a\nsurface without a scratch is respected, be made to begin to vibrate, to\ncrack and split, from within? Wasn't it enough for _me_ to pay,\nvicariously, the tax on being absurd? Were we all to be landed, without\nan issue or a remedy, in a condition on which that tax would be\ngenerally levied? It was as if, abruptly, with a new emotion, I had\nwished to unthink every thought with which I had been occupied for\ntwenty-four hours. Let me add, however, that even had this process been\nmanageable I was aware of not proposing to begin it till I should have\ndone with Lady John.\n\nThe time she took to meet my last remark is naturally not represented by\nthis prolonged glance of mine at the amount of suggestion that just then\nhappened to reach me from the other quarter. It at all events duly came\nout between us that Mrs. Server was the person I did have on my mind;\nand I remember that it had seemed to me at the end of a minute to matter\ncomparatively little by which of us, after all, she was first\ndesignated. There is perhaps an oddity--which I must set down to my\nemotion of the moment--in my not now being able to say. I should have\nbeen hugely startled if the sight of Gilbert Long had appeared to make\nmy companion suddenly think of her; and reminiscence of that shock is\nnot one of those I have found myself storing up. What does abide with me\nis the memory of how, after a little, my apprehensions, of various\nkinds, dropped--most of all under the deepening conviction that Lady\nJohn was not a whit less agreeably superficial than I could even at the\nworst have desired. The point established for me was that, whereas she\npassed with herself and so many others as taking in everything, she had\ntaken in nothing whatever that it was to my purpose she should not take.\nVast, truly, was the world of observation, that we could both glean in\nit so actively without crossing each other's steps. There we stood close\ntogether, yet--save for the accident of a final dash, as I shall\nnote--were at opposite ends of the field.\n\nIt's a matter as to which the truth sounds priggish, but I can't help it\nif--yes, positively--it affected me as hopelessly vulgar to have made\nany induction at all about our companions _but_ those I have recorded,\nin such detail, on behalf of my own energy. It was better verily not to\nhave touched them--which was the case of everyone else--than to have\ntaken them up, with knowing gestures, only to do so little with them.\nThat I felt the interest of May Server, that May Server felt the\ninterest of poor Briss, and that my feeling incongruously presented\nitself as putting up, philosophically, with the inconvenience of the\nlady's--these were, in fine, circumstances to which she clearly attached\nideas too commonplace for me to judge it useful to gather them in. She\nread all things, Lady John, heaven knows, in the light of the universal\npossibility of a \"relation\"; but most of the relations that she had up\nher sleeve could thrust themselves into my theory only to find\nthemselves, the next minute, eliminated. They were of alien\nsubstance--insoluble in the whole. Gilbert Long had for her no\nconnection, in my deeper sense, with Mrs. Server, nor Mrs. Server with\nGilbert Long, nor the husband with the wife, nor the wife with the\nhusband, nor I with either member of either pair, nor anyone with\nanything, nor anything with anyone. She was thus exactly where I wanted\nher to be, for, frankly, I became conscious, at this climax of my\nconclusion, that I a little wanted her to be where she had distinctly\nended by betraying to me that her proper inspiration had placed her. If\nI have just said that my apprehensions, of various kinds, had finally\nand completely subsided, a more exact statement would perhaps have been\nthat from the moment our eyes met over the show of our couple on the\nsofa, the question of any other calculable thing than _that_ hint of a\nrelation had simply known itself superseded. Reduced to its plainest\nterms, this sketch of an improved acquaintance between our comrades was\ndesigned to make Lady John think. It was designed to make me do no\nless, but we thought, inevitably, on different lines.\n\nI have already so represented my successions of reflection as rapid that\nI may not appear to exceed in mentioning the amusement and philosophy\nwith which I presently perceived it as unmistakable that she believed in\nthe depth of her new sounding. It visibly went down for her much nearer\nto the bottom of the sea than any plumb I might be qualified to drop.\nPoor Briss was in love with his wife--that, when driven to the wall, she\nhad had to recognise; but she had not had to recognise that his wife was\nin love with poor Briss. What was then to militate, on that lady's part,\nagainst a due consciousness, at the end of a splendid summer day, a day\non which occasions had been so multiplied, of an impression of a special\norder? What was to prove that there was \"nothing in it\" when two persons\nsat looking so very exceptionally _much_ as if there were everything in\nit, as if they were for the first time--thanks to finer\nopportunity--doing each other full justice? Mustn't it indeed at this\njuncture have come a little over my friend that Grace had lent herself\nwith uncommon good nature, the previous afternoon, to the arrangement by\nwhich, on the way from town, her ladyship's reputation was to profit by\nno worse company, precisely, than poor Briss's? Mrs. Brissenden's own\nwas obviously now free to profit by my companion's remembering--if the\nfact had reached her ears--that Mrs. Brissenden had meanwhile had Long\nfor an escort. So much, at least, I saw Lady John as seeing, and my\nvision may be taken as representing the dash I have confessed myself as\nmaking from my end of our field. It offers us, to be exact, as jostling\neach other just sensibly--though _I_ only might feel the bruise--in our\nbusiness of picking up straws. Our view of the improved acquaintance was\nonly a straw, but as I stooped to it I felt my head bump with my\nneighbour's. This might have made me ashamed of my eagerness, but, oddly\nenough, that effect was not to come. I felt in fact that, since we had\neven pulled against each other at the straw, I carried off, in turning\naway, the larger piece.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nIt was in the moment of turning away that I somehow learned, without\nlooking, that Mrs. Brissenden had also immediately moved. I wanted to\nlook and yet had my reasons for not appearing to do it too quickly; in\nspite of which I found my friends, even after an interval, still\ndistinguishable as separating for the avoidance of comment. Gilbert\nLong, rising directly after his associate, had already walked away, but\nthis associate, lingering where she stood and meeting me with it,\navailed herself of the occasion to show that she wished to speak to me.\nSuch was the idea she threw out on my forthwith going to her. \"For a few\nminutes--presently.\"\n\n\"Do you mean alone? Shall I come with you?\"\n\nShe hesitated long enough for me to judge her as a trifle surprised at\nmy being so ready--as if indeed she had rather hoped I wouldn't be;\nwhich would have been an easy pretext to her to gain time. In fact, with\na face not quite like the brave face she had at each step hitherto shown\nme, yet unlike in a fashion I should certainly not have been able to\ndefine on the spot; with an expression, in short, that struck me as\ntaking refuge in a general reminder that not my convenience, but her\nown, was in question, she replied: \"Oh, no--but before it's too late. A\nfew minutes hence. Where shall you be?\" she asked with a shade, as I\nimagined, of awkwardness. She had looked about as for symptoms of\nacceptance of the evening's end on the part of the ladies, but we could\nboth see our hostess otherwise occupied. \"We don't go up quite yet. In\nthe morning,\" she added as with an afterthought, \"I suppose you leave\nearly.\"\n\nI debated. \"I haven't thought. And you?\"\n\nShe looked at me straighter now. \"I haven't thought either.\" Then she\nwas silent, neither turning away nor coming to the point, as it seemed\nto me she might have done, of telling me what she had in her head. I\neven fancied that her momentary silence, combined with the way she faced\nme--as if that might speak for her--was meant for an assurance that,\nwhatever train she should take in the morning, she would arrange that it\nshouldn't be, as it had been the day before, the same as mine. I really\ncaught in her attitude a world of invidious reference to the little\njourney we had already made together. She had sympathies, she had\nproprieties that imposed themselves, and I was not to think that any\nlittle journey was to be thought of again in those conditions. It came\nover me that this might have been quite a matter discussed by her,\ndiscussed and settled, with her interlocutor on the sofa. It came over\nme that if, before our break-up for the night, I should happen also to\nhave a minute's talk with that interlocutor, I would equally get from it\nthe sense of an intention unfavourable to our departing in the same\ngroup. And I wondered if this, in that case, wouldn't affect me as\nmarking a change back to Long's old manner--a forfeiture of the\nconditions, whatever view might be taken of them, that had made him, at\nPaddington, suddenly show himself as so possible and so pleasant. If\n_he_ \"changed back,\" wouldn't Grace Brissenden change by the same law?\nAnd if Grace Brissenden did, wouldn't her husband? Wouldn't the miracle\ntake the form of the rejuvenation of that husband? Would it, still by\nthe same token, take the form of _her_ becoming very old, becoming if\nnot as old as her husband, at least as old, as one might say, as\nherself? Would it take the form of her becoming dreadfully plain--plain\nwith the plainness of mere stout maturity and artificial preservation?\nAnd if it took this form for the others, which would it take for May\nServer? Would she, at a bound as marked as theirs, recover her presence\nof mind and her lost equipment?\n\nThe kind of suspense that these rising questions produced for me\nsuffered naturally no drop after Mrs. Briss had cut everything short by\nrustling voluminously away. She had something to say to me, and yet she\nhadn't; she had nothing to say, and yet I felt her to have already\nlaunched herself in a statement. There were other persons I had made\nuncomfortable without at all intending it, but she at least had not\nsuffered from me, and I had no wish that she should; according to which\nshe had no pressure to fear. My suspense, in spite of this,\nremained--indeed all the more sensibly that I had suddenly lost my\ndiscomfort on the subject of redeeming my pledge to her. It had somehow\nleft me at a stroke, my dread of her calling me, as by our agreement, to\nsubmit in respect to what we had talked of as the identification of the\nwoman. That call had been what I looked for from her after she had seen\nme break with Lady John; my first idea _then_ could only be that I must\ncome, as it were, to time. It was strange that, the next minute, I\nshould find myself sure that I was, as I may put it, free; it was at all\nevents indisputable that as I stood there watching her recede and fairly\nstudying, in my preoccupation, her handsome affirmative back and the\nspecial sweep of her long dress--it was indisputable that, on some\nintimation I could, at the instant, recognise but not seize, my\nconsciousness was aware of having performed a full revolution. If I was\nfree, that was what I had been only so short a time before, what I had\nbeen as I drove, in London, to the station. Was this now a foreknowledge\nthat, on the morrow, in driving away, I should feel myself restored to\nthat blankness? The state lost was the state of exemption from intense\nobsessions, and the state recovered would therefore logically match it.\nIf the foreknowledge had thus, as by the stir of the air from my\nfriend's whisk of her train, descended upon me, my liberation was in a\nmanner what I was already tasting. Yet how I also felt, with it,\nsomething of the threat of a chill to my curiosity! The taste of its\nbeing all over, that really sublime success of the strained vision in\nwhich I had been living for crowded hours--was this a taste that I was\nsure I should particularly enjoy? Marked enough it was, doubtless, that\neven in the stress of perceiving myself broken with I ruefully reflected\non all the more, on the ever so much, I still wanted to know!\n\nWell, something of this quantity, in any case, would come, since Mrs.\nBriss did want to speak to me. The suspense that remained with me, as I\nhave indicated, was the special fresh one she had just produced. It fed,\nfor a little, positively, on that survey of her fine retreating person\nto which I have confessed that my eyes attached themselves. These\nseconds were naturally few, and yet my memory gathers from them\nsomething that I can only compare, in its present effect, to the scent\nof a strange flower passed rapidly under my nose. I seem in other words\nto recall that I received in that brush the very liveliest impression\nthat my whole adventure was to yield--the impression that is my reason\nfor speaking of myself as having at the juncture in question \"studied\"\nMrs. Brissenden's back. Study of a profound sort would appear needed in\ntruth to account for it. It was as handsome and affirmative that she at\nonce met and evaded my view, but was not the affirmation (as\ndistinguished from the handsomeness, which was a matter of stature and\nmass,) fairly downright and defiant? Didn't what I saw strike me as\nsaying straight _at_ me, as far as possible, \"I _am_ young--I am and I\n_will_ be; see, _see_ if I'm not; there, there, there!\"--with \"there's\"\nas insistent and rhythmical as the undulations of her fleeing presence,\nas the bejewelled nod of her averted brow? If her face had not been\nhidden, should I not precisely have found myself right in believing that\nit looked, exactly, for those instants, dreadfully older than it had\never yet had to? The answer ideally cynical would have been: \"Oh, any\nwoman of your resources can look young with her back turned! But you've\nhad to turn it to make that proclamation.\" She passed out of the room\nproclaiming, and I did stand there a little defeated, even though with\nher word for another chance at her. Was this word one that she would\nkeep? I had got off--yes, to a certainty. But so too had not she?\n\nNaturally, at any rate, I didn't stay planted; and though it seemed long\nit was probably for no great time after this that I roamed in my\nimpatience. I was divided between the discourtesy of wishing the ladies\nwould go to bed and the apprehension that if they did too soon go I\nmight yet lose everything. Was Mrs. Briss waiting for more privacy, or\nwas she only waiting for a complete escape? Of course, even while I\nasked myself that, I had to remember how much I was taking for granted\non her part in the way of conscious motive. Still, if she had not a\nmotive for escaping, why had she not had one, five minutes before, for\ncoming to the point with me? This inquiry kept me hovering where she\nmight at any instant find me, but that was not inconsistent with my\npresently passing, like herself, into another room. The first one I\nentered--there were great chains of them at Newmarch--showed me once\nmore, at the end opposite the door, the object that all day had been,\npresent or absent, most in my eyes, and that there now could be no\nfallacy in my recognising. Mrs. Server's unquenchable little smile had\nnever yet been so far from quenched as when it recognised, on its own\nside, that I had just had time to note how Ford Obert was, for a change,\ntaking it in. These two friends of mine appeared to have moved together,\nafter the music, to the corner in which I should not have felt it as\nmisrepresenting the matter to say that I surprised them. They owed\nnothing of the harmony that held them--unlike my other couple--to the\nconstraint of a common seat; a small glazed table, a receptacle for\nminute objects of price, extended itself between them as if it had\noffered itself as an occasion for their drawing toward it a pair of low\nchairs; but their union had nevertheless such an air of accepted\nduration as led it slightly to puzzle me. This would have been a reason\nthe more for not interrupting it even had I not peculiarly wished to\nrespect it. It was grist to my mill somehow that something or other had\nhappened as a consequence of which Obert had lost the impulse to repeat\nto me his odd invitation to intervene. He gave me no notice as I passed;\nthe notice was all from his companion. It constituted, I felt, on her\npart, precisely as much and precisely as little of an invitation as it\nhad constituted at the moment--so promptly following our arrival--of my\nfirst seeing them linked; which is but another way of saying that\nnothing in Mrs. Server appeared to acknowledge a lapse. It was nearly\nmidnight, but she was again under arms; everything conceivable--or\nperhaps rather inconceivable--had passed between us before dinner, but\nher face was exquisite again in its repudiation of any reference.\n\nAny reference, I saw, would have been difficult to _me_, had I unluckily\nbeen forced to approach her. What would have made the rare delicacy of\nthe problem was that blankness itself was the most direct reference of\nall. I had, however, as I passed her by, a comprehension as inward as\nthat with which I had watched Mrs. Briss's retreat. \"_What_ shall I see\nwhen I next see you?\" was what I had mutely asked of Mrs. Briss; but\n\"God grant I don't see _you_ again at all!\" was the prayer sharply\ndetermined in my heart as I left Mrs. Server behind me. I left her\nbehind me for ever, but the prayer has not been answered. I did see her\nagain; I see her now; I shall see her always; I shall continue to feel\nat moments in my own facial muscles the deadly little ache of her heroic\ngrin. With this, however, I was not then to reckon, and my simple\nphilosophy of the moment could be but to get out of the room. The result\nof that movement was that, two minutes later, at another doorway, but\nopening this time into a great corridor, I found myself arrested by a\ncombination that should really have counted for me as the least of my\nprecious anomalies, but that--as accident happened to protect me--I\nwatched, so long as I might, with intensity. I should in this connection\ndescribe my eyes as yet again engaging the less scrutable side of the\nhuman figure, were it not that poor Briss's back, now presented to me\nbeside his wife's--for these were the elements of the combination--had\nhitherto seemed to me the most eloquent of his aspects. It was when he\npresented his face that he looked, each time, older; but it was when he\nshowed you, from behind, the singular stoop of his shoulders, that he\nlooked oldest.\n\nThey had just passed the door when I emerged, and they receded, at a\nslow pace and with a kind of confidential nearness, down the long avenue\nof the lobby. Her head was always high and her husband's always low, so\nthat I couldn't be sure--it might have been only my fancy--that the\ncontrast of this habit was more marked in them than usual. If I had\nknown nothing about them I should have just unimaginatively said that\ntalk was all on one side and attention all on the other. I, of course,\nfor that matter, _did_ know nothing about them; yet I recall how it came\nto me, as my extemporised shrewdness hung in their rear, that I mustn't\nthink anything too grossly simple of what might be taking place between\nthem. My position was, in spite of myself, that of my having mastered\nenough possibilities to choose from. If one of these might be--for her\nface, in spite of the backward cock of her head, was turned to him--that\nshe was looking her time of life straight _at_ him and yet making love\nto him with it as hard as ever she could, so another was that he had\nbeen already so thoroughly got back into hand that she had no need of\nasking favours, that she was more splendid than ever, and that, the same\npoor Briss as before his brief adventure, he was only feeling afresh in\nhis soul, as a response to her, the gush of the sacred fount.\nPresumptous choice as to these alternatives failed, on my part, in time,\nlet me say, to flower; it rose before me in time that, whatever might\nbe, for the exposed instant, the deep note of their encounter, only one\nthing concerned me in it: its being wholly their own business. So for\nthat I liberally let it go, passing into the corridor, but proceeding in\nthe opposite sense and aiming at an issue which I judged I should reach\nbefore they would turn in their walk. I had not, however, reached it\nbefore I caught the closing of the door furthest from me; at the sound\nof which I looked about to find the Brissendens gone. They had not\nremained for another turn, but had taken their course, evidently, back\nto the principal drawing-room, where, no less presumably, the procession\nof the ladies bedward was even then forming. Mrs. Briss would fall\nstraight into it, and I _had_ accordingly lost her. I hated to appear to\npursue her, late in the day as it may appear to affirm that I put my\ndignity before my curiosity.\n\nFree again, at all events, to wait or to wander, I lingered a minute\nwhere I had stopped--close to a wide window, as it happened, that, at\nthis end of the passage, stood open to the warm darkness and overhung,\nfrom no great height, one of the terraces. The night was mild and rich,\nand though the lights within were, in deference to the temperature, not\ntoo numerous, I found the breath of the outer air a sudden corrective to\nthe grossness of our lustre and the thickness of our medium, our general\nheavy humanity. I felt its taste sweet, and while I leaned for\nrefreshment on the sill I thought of many things. One of those that\npassed before me was the way that Newmarch and its hospitalities were\nsacrificed, after all, and much more than smaller circles, to material\nfrustrations. We were all so fine and formal, and the ladies in\nparticular at once so little and so much clothed, so beflounced yet so\ndenuded, that the summer stars called to us in vain. We had ignored them\nin our crystal cage, among our tinkling lamps; no more free really to\nalight than if we had been dashing in a locked railway-train across a\nlovely land. I remember asking myself if I mightn't still take a turn\nunder them, and I remember that on appealing to my watch for its\nsanction I found midnight to have struck. That then was the end, and my\nonly real alternatives were bed or the smoking-room. The difficulty with\nbed was that I was in no condition to sleep, and the difficulty about\nrejoining the men was that--definitely, yes--there was one of them I\ndesired not again to see. I felt it with sharpness as I leaned on the\nsill; I felt it with sadness as I looked at the stars; I felt once more\nwhat I had felt on turning a final back five minutes before, so\ndesignedly, on Mrs. Server. I saw poor Briss as he had just moved away\nfrom me, and I knew, as I had known in the other case, that my troubled\nsense would fain feel I had practically done with him. It would be well,\nfor aught I could do _for_ him, that I should have seen the last of\nhim. What remained with me from that vision of his pacing there with\nhis wife was the conviction that his fate, whatever it was, held him\nfast. It wouldn't let him go, and all I could ask of it now was that it\nshould let _me_. I _would_ go--I was going; if I had not had to accept\nthe interval of the night I should indeed already have gone. The\nadmonitions of that moment--only confirmed, I hasten to add, by what was\nstill to come--were that I should catch in the morning, with energy, an\nearlier train to town than anyone else was likely to take, and get off\nalone by it, bidding farewell for a long day to Newmarch. I should be in\nsmall haste to come back, for I should leave behind me my tangled\ntheory, no loose thread of which need I ever again pick up, in no stray\nmesh of which need my foot again trip. It was on my way to the place, in\nfine, that my obsession had met me, and it was by retracing those steps\nthat I should be able to get rid of it. Only I must break off sharp,\nmust escape all reminders by forswearing all returns.\n\nThat was very well, but it would perhaps have been better still if I had\ngone straight to bed. In that case I _should_ have broken off sharp--too\nsharp to become aware of something that kept me a minute longer at the\nwindow and that had the instant effect of making me wonder if, in the\ninterest of observation, I mightn't snap down the electric light that,\nplaying just behind me, must show where I stood. I resisted this\nimpulse and, with the thought that my position was in no way\ncompromising, chanced being myself observed. I presently saw moreover\nthat I was really not in evidence: I could take in freely what I had at\nfirst not been sure of, the identity of the figure stationed just within\nmy range, but just out of that of the light projected from my window.\nOne of the men of our company had come out by himself for a stroll, and\nthe man was Gilbert Long. He had paused, I made out, in his walk; his\nback was to the house, and, resting on the balustrade of the terrace\nwith a cigarette in his lips, he had given way to a sense of the\nfragrant gloom. He moved so little that I was sure--making no turn that\nwould have made me draw back; he only smoked slowly in his place and\nseemed as lost in thought as I was lost in my attention to him. I scarce\nknew what this told me; all I felt was that, however slight the incident\nand small the evidence, it essentially fitted in. It had for my\nimagination a value, for my theory a price, and it in fact constituted\nan impression under the influence of which this theory, just impatiently\nshaken off, perched again on my shoulders. It was of the deepest\ninterest to me to see Long in such detachment, in such apparent\nconcentration. These things marked and presented him more than any had\nyet done, and placed him more than any yet in relation to other matters.\nThey showed him, I thought, as serious, his situation as grave. I\ncouldn't have said what they proved, but I was as affected by them as if\nthey proved everything. The proof simply acted from the instant the\nvision of him alone there in the warm darkness was caught. It was just\nwith all that was in the business that he _was_, that he had fitfully\nneeded to be, alone. Nervous and restless after separating, under my\neyes, from Mrs. Briss, he had wandered off to the smoking-room, as yet\nempty; _he_ didn't know what to do either, and was incapable of bed and\nof sleep. He had observed the communication of the smoking-room with the\nterrace and had come out into the air; this was what suited him, and,\nwith pauses and meditations, much, possibly, by this time to turn over,\nhe prolonged his soft vigil. But he at last moved, and I found myself\nstartled. I gave up watching and retraced my course. I felt, none the\nless, fairly humiliated. It had taken but another turn of an eye to\nre-establish all my connections.\n\nI had not, however, gone twenty steps before I met Ford Obert, who had\nentered the corridor from the other end and was, as he immediately let\nme know, on his way to the smoking-room.\n\n\"Is everyone then dispersing?\"\n\n\"Some of the men, I think,\" he said, \"are following me; others, I\nbelieve--wonderful creatures!--have gone to array themselves. Others\nstill, doubtless, have gone to bed.\"\n\n\"And the ladies?\"\n\n\"Oh, they've floated away--soared aloft; to high jinks--isn't that the\nidea?--in their own quarters. Don't they too, at these hours, practise\nsociabilities of sorts? They make, at any rate, here, an extraordinary\npicture on that great staircase.\"\n\nI thought a moment. \"I wish I had seen it. But I do see it.\nYes--splendid. Is the place wholly cleared of them?\"\n\n\"Save, it struck me, so far as they may have left some 'black plume as a\ntoken'----\"\n\n\"Not, I trust,\" I returned, \"of any 'lie' their 'soul hath spoken!' But\nnot one of them lingers?\"\n\nHe seemed to wonder. \"'Lingers?' For what?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know--in this house!\"\n\nHe looked at our long vista, still lighted--appeared to feel with me our\nliberal ease, which implied that unseen powers waited on our good\npleasure and sat up for us. There is nothing like it in fact, the\nliberal ease at Newmarch. Yet Obert reminded me--if I needed the\nreminder--that I mustn't after all presume on it. \"Was one of them to\nlinger for _you_?\"\n\n\"Well, since you ask me, it was what I hoped. But since you answer for\nit that my hope has not been met, I bow to a superior propriety.\"\n\n\"You mean you'll come and smoke with me? Do then come.\"\n\n\"What, if I do,\" I asked with an idea, \"will you give me?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can promise you nothing more that _I_ deal in than a bad\ncigarette.\"\n\n\"And what then,\" I went on, \"will you take from me?\"\n\nHe had met my eyes, and now looked at me a little with a smile that I\nthought just conscious. \"Well, I'm afraid I _can't_ take any more----\"\n\n\"Of the sort of stuff,\" I laughed, \"you've already had? Sorry stuff,\nperhaps--a poor thing but mine own! Such as it is, I only ask to keep it\nfor myself, and that isn't what I meant. I meant what flower will you\ngather, what havoc will you play----?\"\n\n\"Well?\" he said as I hesitated.\n\n\"Among superstitions that I, after all, cherish. _Mon si\u00c3\u00a8ge est fait_--a\ngreat glittering crystal palace. How many panes will you reward me for\namiably sitting up with you by smashing?\"\n\nIt might have been my mere fancy--but it _was_ my fancy--that he looked\nat me a trifle harder. \"How on earth can I tell what you're talking\nabout?\"\n\nI waited a moment, then went on: \"Did you happen to count them?\"\n\n\"Count whom?\"\n\n\"Why, the ladies as they filed up. Was the number there?\"\n\nHe gave a jerk of impatience. \"Go and see for yourself!\"\n\nOnce more I just waited. \"But suppose I should find Mrs. Server----?\"\n\n\"Prowling there on the chance of you? Well--I thought she was what you\nwanted.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I returned, \"you _could_ tell what I was talking about!\" For a\nmoment after this we faced each other without more speech, but I\npresently continued: \"You didn't really notice if any lady stayed\nbehind?\"\n\n\"I think you ask too much of me,\" he at last brought out. \"Take care of\nyour ladies, my dear man, yourself! Go,\" he repeated, \"and see.\"\n\n\"Certainly--it's better; but I'll rejoin you in three minutes.\" And\nwhile he went his way to the smoking-room I proceeded without more delay\nto assure myself, performing in the opposite sense the journey I had\nmade ten minutes before. It was extraordinary what the sight of Long\nalone in the outer darkness had done for me: my expression of it would\nhave been that it had put me \"on\" again at the moment of my decidedly\nfeeling myself off. I believed that if I hadn't seen him I could now\nhave gone to bed without seeing Mrs. Briss; but my renewed impression\nhad suddenly made the difference. If that was the way he struck me, how\nmight not, if I could get at her, she? And she might, after all, in the\nprivacy at last offered us by empty rooms, be waiting for me. I went\nthrough them all, however, only to find them empty indeed. In conformity\nwith the large allowances of every sort that were the law of Newmarch,\nthey were still open and lighted, so that if I had believed in Mrs.\nBriss's reappearance I might conveniently, on the spot, have given her\nfive minutes more. I am not sure, for that matter, that I didn't. I\nremember at least wondering if I mightn't ring somewhere for a servant\nand cause a question to be sent up to her. I didn't ring, but I must\nhave lingered a little on the chance of the arrival of servants to\nextinguish lights and see the house safe. They had not arrived, however,\nby the time I again felt that I must give up.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI gave up by going, decidedly, to the smoking-room, where several men\nhad gathered and where Obert, a little apart from them, was in charmed\ncommunion with the bookshelves. They are wonderful, everywhere, at\nNewmarch, the bookshelves, but he put a volume back as he saw me come\nin, and a moment later, when we were seated, I said to him again, as a\nrecall of our previous passage, \"Then you _could_ tell what I was\ntalking about!\" And I added, to complete my reference, \"Since you\nthought Mrs. Server was the person whom, when I stopped you, I was sorry\nto learn from you I had missed.\"\n\nHis momentary silence appeared to admit the connection I established.\n\"Then you find you _have_ missed her? She wasn't there for you?\"\n\n\"There's no one 'there for me'; so that I fear that if you weren't, as\nit happens, here for me, my amusement would be quite at an end. I had,\nin fact,\" I continued, \"already given it up as lost when I came upon\nyou, a while since, in conversation with the lady we've named. At that,\nI confess, my prospects gave something of a flare. I said to myself\nthat since _your_ interest hadn't then wholly dropped, why, even at the\nworst, should mine? Yours _was_ mine, wasn't it? for a little, this\nmorning. Or was it mine that was yours? We exchanged, at any rate, some\nlively impressions. Only, before we had done, your effort dropped or\nyour discretion intervened: you gave up, as none of your business, the\nquestion that had suddenly tempted us.\"\n\n\"And you gave it up too,\" said my friend.\n\n\"Yes, and it was on the idea that it was mine as little as yours that we\nseparated.\"\n\n\"Well then?\" He kept his eyes, with his head thrown back, on the warm\nbindings, admirable for old gilt and old colour, that covered the\nopposite wall.\n\n\"Well then, if I've correctly gathered that you're, in spite of our\ncommon renunciation, still interested, I confess to you that I am. I\ntook my detachment too soon for granted. I haven't been detached. I'm\nnot, hang me! detached now. And it's all because you were originally so\nsuggestive.\"\n\n\"Originally?\"\n\n\"Why, from the moment we met here yesterday--the moment of my first\nseeing you with Mrs. Server. The look you gave me then was really the\nbeginning of everything. Everything\"--and I spoke now with real\nconviction--\"was traceably to spring from it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean,\" he asked, \"by everything?\"\n\n\"Well, this failure of detachment. What you said to me as we were going\nup yesterday afternoon to dress--what you said to me then is responsible\nfor it. And since it comes to that,\" I pursued, \"I make out for myself\nnow that you're not detached either--unless, that is, simply detached\nfrom _me_. I had indeed a suspicion of that as I passed through the room\nthere.\"\n\nHe smoked through another pause. \"You've extraordinary notions of\nresponsibility.\"\n\nI watched him a moment, but he only stared at the books without looking\nround. Something in his voice had made me more certain, and my certainty\nmade me laugh. \"I see you _are_ serious!\"\n\nBut he went on quietly enough. \"You've extraordinary notions of\nresponsibility. I deny altogether mine.\"\n\n\"You _are_ serious--you _are_!\" I repeated with a gaiety that I meant as\ninoffensive and that I believe remained so. \"But no matter. You're no\nworse than I.\"\n\n\"I'm clearly, by your own story, not half so bad. But, as you say, no\nmatter. I don't care.\"\n\nI ventured to keep it up. \"Oh, don't you?\"\n\nHis good nature was proof. \"I don't care.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you so much as look at me a while ago?\"\n\n\"Didn't I look at you?\"\n\n\"You know perfectly you didn't. Mrs. Server did--with her unutterable\nintensity; making me feel afresh, by the way, that I've never seen a\nwoman compromise herself so little by proceedings so compromising. But\nthough you saw her intensity, it never diverted you for an instant from\nyour own.\"\n\nHe lighted before he answered this a fresh cigarette. \"A man engaged in\ntalk with a charming woman scarcely selects that occasion for winking at\nsomebody else.\"\n\n\"You mean he contents himself with winking at _her_? My dear fellow,\nthat wasn't enough for you yesterday, and it wouldn't have been enough\nfor you this morning, among the impressions that led to our last talk.\nIt was just the fact that you did wink, that you _had_ winked, at me\nthat wound me up.\"\n\n\"And what about the fact that you had winked at _me_? _Your_\nwinks--come\"--Obert laughed--\"are portentous!\"\n\n\"Oh, if we recriminate,\" I cheerfully said after a moment, \"we agree.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" he returned, \"that we agree.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, if we differ it's still more interesting. Because, you know,\nwe didn't differ either yesterday or this morning.\"\n\nWithout hurry or flurry, but with a decent confusion, his thoughts went\nback. \"I thought you said just now we did--recognising, as you ought,\nthat you were keen about a chase of which I washed my hands.\"\n\n\"No--I wasn't keen. You've just mentioned that you remember my giving\nup. I washed my hands too.\"\n\nIt seemed to leave him with the moral of this. \"Then, if our hands are\nclean, what are we talking about?\"\n\nI turned, on it, a little more to him, and looked at him so long that he\nhad at last to look at me; with which, after holding his eyes another\nmoment, I made my point. \"Our hands are not clean.\"\n\n\"Ah, speak for your own!\"--and as he moved back I might really have\nthought him uneasy. There was a hint of the same note in the way he went\non: \"I assure you I decline all responsibility. I see the responsibility\nas quite beautifully yours.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I only want to be fair. You were the first to bring it\nout that she was changed.\"\n\n\"Well, she isn't changed!\" said my friend with an almost startling\neffect, for me, of suddenness. \"Or rather,\" he immediately and\nincongruously added, \"she _is_. She's changed back.\"\n\n\"'Back'?\" It made me stare.\n\n\"Back,\" he repeated with a certain sharpness and as if to have done at\nlast, for himself, with the muddle of it.\n\nBut there was that in me that could let him see he had far from done;\nand something, above all, told me now that he absolutely mustn't have\nbefore I had. I quickly moreover saw that I must, with an art, make him\nwant not to. \"Back to what she was when you painted her?\"\n\nHe had to think an instant for this. \"No--not quite to that.\"\n\n\"To what then?\"\n\nHe tried in a manner to oblige me. \"To something else.\"\n\nIt seemed so, for my thought, the gleam of something that fitted, that I\nwas almost afraid of quenching the gleam by pressure. I must then get\neverything I could from him without asking too much. \"You don't quite\nknow to _what_ else?\"\n\n\"No--I don't quite know.\" But there was a sound in it, this time, that I\ntook as the hint of a wish to know--almost a recognition that I might\nhelp him.\n\nI helped him accordingly as I could and, I may add, as far as the\npositive flutter he had stirred in me suffered. It fitted--it fitted!\n\"If her change is to something other, I suppose then a change back is\nnot quite the exact name for it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.\" I fairly thrilled at his taking the suggestion as if it\nwere an assistance. \"She isn't at any rate what I thought her\nyesterday.\"\n\nIt was amazing into what depths this dropped for me and with what\npossibilities it mingled. \"I remember what you said of her yesterday.\"\n\nI drew him on so that I brought back for him the very words he had used.\n\"She was so beastly unhappy.\" And he used them now visibly not as a\nremembrance of what he had said, but for the contrast of the fact with\nwhat he at present perceived; so that the value this gave for me to what\nhe at present perceived was immense.\n\n\"And do you mean that that's gone?\"\n\nHe hung fire, however, a little as to saying so much what he meant, and\nwhile he waited he again looked at me. \"What do _you_ mean? Don't you\nthink so yourself?\"\n\nI laid my hand on his arm and held him a moment with a grip that\nbetrayed, I daresay, the effort in me to keep my thoughts together and\nlose not a thread. It betrayed at once, doubtless, the danger of that\nfailure and the sharp foretaste of success. I remember that with it,\nabsolutely, I struck myself as knowing again the joy of the intellectual\nmastery of things unamenable, that joy of determining, almost of\ncreating results, which I have already mentioned as an exhilaration\nattached to some of my plunges of insight. \"It would take long to tell\nyou what I mean.\"\n\nThe tone of it made him fairly watch me as I had been watching him.\n\"Well, haven't we got the whole night?\"\n\n\"Oh, it would take more than the whole night--even if we had it!\"\n\n\"By which you suggest that we haven't it?\"\n\n\"No--we haven't it. I want to get away.\"\n\n\"To go to bed? I thought you were so keen.\"\n\n\"I _am_ keen. Keen is no word for it. I don't want to go to bed. I want\nto get away.\"\n\n\"To leave the house--in the middle of the night?\"\n\n\"Yes--absurd as it may seem. You excite me too much. You don't know what\nyou do to me.\"\n\nHe continued to look at me; then he gave a laugh which was not the\ncontradiction, but quite the attestation, of the effect produced on him\nby my grip. If I had wanted to hold him I held him. It only came to me\neven that I held him too much. I felt this in fact with the next thing\nhe said. \"If you're too excited, then, to be coherent now, will you tell\nme to-morrow?\"\n\nI took time myself now to relight. Ridiculous as it may sound, I had my\nnerves to steady; which is a proof, surely, that for real excitement\nthere are no such adventures as intellectual ones. \"Oh, to-morrow I\nshall be off in space!\"\n\n\"Certainly we shall neither of us be here. But can't we arrange, say, to\nmeet in town, or even to go up together in such conditions as will\nenable us to talk?\"\n\nI patted his arm again. \"Thank you for your patience. It's really good\nof you. Who knows if I shall be alive to-morrow? We _are_ meeting. We\n_do_ talk.\"\n\nBut with all I had to think of I must have fallen, on this, into the\ndeepest of silences, for the next thing I remember is his returning: \"We\ndon't!\" I repeated my gesture of reassurance, I conveyed that I should\nbe with him again in a minute, and presently, while he gave me time, he\ncame back to something of his own. \"My wink, at all events, would have\nbeen nothing for any question between us, as I've just said, without\nyours. That's what I call your responsibility. It was, as we put the\nmatter, the torch of your analogy----\"\n\n\"Oh, the torch of my analogy!\"\n\nI had so groaned it--as if for very ecstasy--that it pulled him up, and\nI could see his curiosity as indeed reaffected. But he went on with a\ncoherency that somewhat admonished me: \"It was your making me, as I told\nyou this morning, think over what you had said about Brissenden and his\nwife: it was _that_----\"\n\n\"That made you think over\"--I took him straight up--\"what you yourself\nhad said about our troubled lady? Yes, precisely. That _was_ the torch\nof my analogy. What I showed you in the one case seemed to tell you what\nto look for in the other. You thought it over. I accuse you of nothing\nworse than of _having_ thought it over. But you see what thinking it\nover does for it.\"\n\nThe way I said this appeared to amuse him. \"I see what it does for\n_you_!\"\n\n\"No, you don't! Not at all yet. That's just the embarrassment.\"\n\n\"Just whose?\" If I had thanked him for his patience he showed that he\ndeserved it. \"Just yours?\"\n\n\"Well, say mine. But when you do----!\" And I paused as for the rich\npromise of it.\n\n\"When I do see where you are, you mean?\"\n\n\"The only difficulty is whether you _can_ see. But we must try. You've\nset me whirling round, but we must go step by step. Oh, but it's all in\nyour germ!\"--I kept that up. \"If she isn't now beastly unhappy----\"\n\n\"She's beastly happy?\" he broke in, getting firmer hold, if not of the\nreal impression he had just been gathering under my eyes, then at least\nof something he had begun to make out that my argument required. \"Well,\nthat _is_ the way I see her difference. Her difference, I mean,\" he\nadded, in his evident wish to work with me, \"her difference from her\nother difference! There!\" He laughed as if, also, he had found himself\nfairly fantastic. \"Isn't _that_ clear for you?\"\n\n\"Crystalline--for _me_. But that's because I know why.\"\n\nI can see again now the long look that, on this, he gave me. I made out\nalready much of what was in it. \"So then do I!\"\n\n\"But how in the world----? I know, for myself, _how_ I know.\"\n\n\"So then do I,\" he after a moment repeated.\n\n\"And can you tell me?\"\n\n\"Certainly. But what I've already named to you--the torch of your\nanalogy.\"\n\nI turned this over. \"You've made evidently an admirable use of it. But\nthe wonderful thing is that you seem to have done so without having all\nthe elements.\"\n\nHe on his side considered. \"What do you call all the elements?\"\n\n\"Oh, it would take me long to tell you!\" I couldn't help laughing at the\ncomparative simplicity with which he asked it. \"That's the sort of thing\nwe just now spoke of taking a day for. At any rate, such as they are,\nthese elements,\" I went on, \"I believe myself practically in possession\nof them. But what I don't quite see is how _you_ can be.\"\n\nWell, he was able to tell me. \"Why in the world shouldn't your analogy\nhave put me?\" He spoke with gaiety, but with lucidity. \"I'm not an idiot\neither.\"\n\n\"I see.\" But there was so much!\n\n\"Did you think I _was_?\" he amiably asked.\n\n\"No. I see,\" I repeated. Yet I didn't, really, fully; which he presently\nperceived.\n\n\"You made me think of your view of the Brissenden pair till I could\nthink of nothing else.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" I said. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, as you had planted the theory in me, it began to bear fruit. I\nbegan to watch them. I continued to watch them. I did nothing but watch\nthem.\"\n\nThe sudden lowering of his voice in this confession--as if it had\nrepresented a sort of darkening of his consciousness--again amused me.\n\"You too? How then we've been occupied! For I, you see, have watched--or\nhad, until I found you just now with Mrs. Server--everyone, everything\n_but_ you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've watched _you_,\" said Ford Obert as if he had then perhaps\nafter all the advantage of me. \"I admit that I made you out for myself\nto be back on the scent; for I thought I made you out baffled.\"\n\nTo learn whether I really had been was, I saw, what he would most have\nliked; but I also saw that he had, as to this, a scruple about asking\nme. What I most saw, however, was that to tell him I should have to\nunderstand. \"What scent do you allude to?\"\n\nHe smiled as if I might have fancied I could fence. \"Why, the pursuit of\nthe identification that's none of our business--the identification of\nher lover.\"\n\n\"Ah, it's as to that,\" I instantly replied, \"you've judged me baffled?\nI'm afraid,\" I almost as quickly added, \"that I must admit I _have_\nbeen. Luckily, at all events, it _is_ none of our business.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my friend, amused on his side, \"nothing's our business that\nwe can't find out. I saw you hadn't found him. And what,\" Obert\ncontinued, \"does he matter now?\"\n\nIt took but a moment to place me for seeing that my companion's\nconviction on this point was a conviction decidedly to respect; and even\nthat amount of hesitation was but the result of my wondering how he had\nreached it. \"What, indeed?\" I promptly replied. \"But how did you see I\nhad failed?\"\n\n\"By seeing that I myself had. For I've been looking too. He isn't here,\"\nsaid Ford Obert.\n\nDelighted as I was that he should believe it, I was yet struck by the\ncomplacency of his confidence, which connected itself again with my\nobservation of their so recent colloquy. \"Oh, for you to be so sure, has\nMrs. Server squared you?\"\n\n\"_Is_ he here?\" he for all answer to this insistently asked.\n\nI faltered but an instant. \"No; he isn't here. It's no thanks to one's\nscruples, but perhaps it's lucky for one's manners. I speak at least for\nmine. If you've watched,\" I pursued, \"you've doubtless sufficiently seen\nwhat has already become of mine. He isn't here, at all events,\" I\nrepeated, \"and we must do without his identity. What, in fact, are we\nshowing each other,\" I asked, \"but that we _have_ done without it?\"\n\n\"_I_ have!\" my friend declared with supreme frankness and with something\nof the note, as I was obliged to recognise, of my own constructive joy.\n\"I've done perfectly without it.\"\n\nI saw in fact that he had, and it struck me really as wonderful. But I\ncontrolled the expression of my wonder. \"So that if you spoke therefore\njust now of watching them----\"\n\n\"I meant of course\"--he took it straight up--\"watching the Brissendens.\nAnd naturally, above all,\" he as quickly subjoined, \"the wife.\"\n\nI was now full of concurrence. \"Ah, naturally, above all, the wife.\"\n\nSo far as was required it encouraged him. \"A woman's lover doesn't\nmatter--doesn't matter at least to anyone but himself, doesn't matter to\nyou or to me or to her--when once she has given him up.\"\n\nIt made me, this testimony of his observation, show, in spite of my\nhaving by this time so counted on it, something of the vivacity of my\nemotion. \"She _has_ given him up?\"\n\nBut the surprise with which he looked round put me back on my guard. \"Of\nwhat else then are we talking?\"\n\n\"Of nothing else, of course,\" I stammered. \"But the way you see----!\" I\nfound my refuge in the gasp of my admiration.\n\n\"I do see. But\"--he _would_ come back to that--\"only through your having\nseen first. You gave me the pieces. I've but put them together. You gave\nme the Brissendens--bound hand and foot; and I've but made them, in that\nsorry state, pull me through. I've blown on my torch, in other words,\ntill, flaring and smoking, it has guided me, through a magnificent\nchiaroscuro of colour and shadow, out into the light of day.\"\n\nI was really dazzled by his image, for it represented his personal work.\n\"You've done more than I, it strikes me--and with less to do it with. If\nI gave you the Brissendens I gave you all I had.\"\n\n\"But all you had was immense, my dear man. The Brissendens are immense.\"\n\n\"Of course the Brissendens are immense! If they hadn't been immense they\nwouldn't have been--_nothing_ would have been--anything.\" Then after a\npause, \"Your image is splendid,\" I went on--\"your being out of the cave.\nBut what is it exactly,\" I insidiously threw out, \"that you _call_ the\n'light of day'?\"\n\nI remained a moment, however, not sure whether I had been too subtle or\ntoo simple. He had another of his cautions. \"What do _you_----?\"\n\nBut I was determined to make him give it me all himself, for it was\nfrom my not prompting him that its value would come. \"You tell me,\" I\naccordingly rather crudely pleaded, \"first.\"\n\nIt gave us a moment during which he so looked as if I asked too much,\nthat I had a fear of losing all. He even spoke with some impatience. \"If\nyou really haven't found it for yourself, you know. I scarce see what\nyou _can_ have found.\"\n\nThen I had my inspiration. I risked an approach to roughness, and all\nthe more easily that my words were strict truth. \"Oh, don't be\nafraid--greater things than yours!\"\n\nIt succeeded, for it played upon his curiosity, and he visibly imagined\nthat, with impatience controlled, he should learn what these things\nwere. He relaxed, he responded, and the next moment I was in all but\nfull enjoyment of the piece wanted to make all my other pieces\nright--right because of that special beauty in my scheme through which\nthe whole depended so on each part and each part so guaranteed the\nwhole. \"What I call the light of day is the sense I've arrived at of her\nvision.\"\n\n\"Her vision?\"--I just balanced in the air.\n\n\"Of what they have in common. _His_--poor chap's--extraordinary\nsituation too.\"\n\n\"Bravo! And you see in that----?\"\n\n\"What, all these hours, has touched, fascinated, drawn her. It has been\nan instinct with her.\"\n\n\"Bravissimo!\"\n\nIt saw him, my approval, safely into port. \"The instinct of sympathy,\npity--the response to fellowship in misery; the sight of another fate as\nstrange, as monstrous as her own.\"\n\nI couldn't help jumping straight up--I stood before him. \"So that\nwhoever may have _been_ the man, the man _now_, the actual man----\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Obert, looking, luminous and straight, up at me from his\nseat, \"the man now, the actual man----!\" But he stopped short, with his\neyes suddenly quitting me and his words becoming a formless ejaculation.\nThe door of the room, to which my back was turned, had opened, and I\nquickly looked round. It was Brissenden himself who, to my supreme\nsurprise, stood there, with rapid inquiry in his attitude and face. I\nsaw, as soon as he caught mine, that I was what he wanted, and,\nimmediately excusing myself for an instant to Obert, I anticipated, by\nmoving across the room, the need, on poor Briss's part, of my further\ndemonstration. My whole sense of the situation blazed up at the touch of\nhis presence, and even before I reached him it had rolled over me in a\nprodigious wave that I had lost nothing whatever. I can't begin to say\nhow the fact of his appearance crowned the communication my interlocutor\nhad just made me, nor in what a bright confusion of many things I found\nmyself facing poor Briss. One of these things was precisely that he had\nnever been so much poor Briss as at this moment. That ministered to the\nconfusion as well as to the brightness, for if his being there at all\nrenewed my sources and replenished my current--spoke all, in short, for\nmy gain--so, on the other hand, in the light of what I had just had from\nObert, his particular aspect was something of a shock. I can't present\nthis especial impression better than by the mention of my instant\ncertitude that what he had come for was to bring me a message and that\nsomehow--yes, indubitably--this circumstance seemed to have placed him\nagain at the very bottom of his hole. It was down in that depth that he\nlet me see him--it was out of it that he delivered himself. Poor Briss!\npoor Briss!--I had asked myself before he spoke with what kindness\nenough I could meet him. Poor Briss! poor Briss!--I am not even now sure\nthat I didn't first meet him by _that_ irrepressible murmur. It was in\nit all for me that, thus, at midnight, he had traversed on his errand\nthe length of the great dark house. I trod with him, over the velvet and\nthe marble, through the twists and turns, among the glooms and glimmers\nand echoes, every inch of the way, and I don't know what humiliation,\nfor him, was constituted there, between us, by his long pilgrimage. It\nwas the final expression of his sacrifice.\n\n\"My wife has something to say to you.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Briss? Good!\"--and I could only hope the candour of my surprise\nwas all I tried to make it. \"Is she with you there?\"\n\n\"No, but she has asked me to say to you that if you'll presently be in\nthe drawing-room she'll come.\"\n\nWho could doubt, as I laid my hand on his shoulder, fairly patting it,\nin spite of myself, for applause--who could doubt where I would\npresently be? \"It's most uncommonly good of both of you.\"\n\nThere was something in his inscrutable service that, making him almost\naugust, gave my dissimulated eagerness the sound of a heartless\ncompliment. _I_ stood for the hollow chatter of the vulgar world, and\nhe--oh, he was as serious as he was conscious; which was enough. \"She\nsays you'll know what she wishes--and she was sure I'd find you here. So\nI may tell her you'll come?\"\n\nHis courtesy half broke my heart. \"Why, my dear man, with all the\npleasure----! So many thousand thanks. I'll be with her.\"\n\n\"Thanks to _you_. She'll be down. Good-night.\" He looked round the\nroom--at the two or three clusters of men, smoking, engaged, contented,\non their easy seats and among their popped corks; he looked over an\ninstant at Ford Obert, whose eyes, I thought, he momentarily held. It\nwas absolutely as if, for me, he were seeking such things--out of what\nwas closing over him--for the last time. Then he turned again to the\ndoor, which, just not to fail humanly to accompany him a step, I had\nopened. On the other side of it I took leave of him. The passage, though\nthere was a light in the distance, was darker than the smoking-room, and\nI had drawn the door to.\n\n\"Good-night, Brissenden. I shall be gone to-morrow before you show.\"\n\nI shall never forget the way that, struck by my word, he let his white\nface fix me in the dusk. \"'Show'? _What_ do I show?\"\n\nI had taken his hand for farewell, and, inevitably laughing, but as the\nfalsest of notes, I gave it a shake. \"You show nothing! You're\nmagnificent.\"\n\nHe let me keep his hand while things unspoken and untouched, unspeakable\nand untouchable, everything that had been between us in the wood a few\nhours before, were between us again. But so we could only leave them,\nand, with a short, sharp \"Good-bye!\" he completely released himself.\nWith my hand on the latch of the closed door I watched a minute his\nretreat along the passage, and I remember the reflection that, before\nrejoining Obert, I made on it. I seemed perpetually, at Newmarch, to be\ntaking his measure from behind.\n\nFord Obert has since told me that when I came back to him there were\ntears in my eyes, and I didn't know at the moment how much the words\nwith which he met me took for granted my consciousness of them. \"He\nlooks a hundred years old!\"\n\n\"Oh, but you should see his shoulders, always, as he goes off! _Two_\ncenturies--ten! Isn't it amazing?\"\n\nIt was so amazing that, for a little, it made us reciprocally stare. \"I\nshould have thought,\" he said, \"that he would have been on the\ncontrary----\"\n\n\"Visibly rejuvenated? So should I. I must make it out,\" I added. \"I\n_shall_.\"\n\nBut Obert, with less to go upon, couldn't wait. It was wonderful, for\nthat matter--and for all I had to go upon--how I myself could. I did so,\nat this moment, in my refreshed intensity, by the help of confusedly\nlighting another cigarette, which I should have no time to smoke. \"I\nshould have thought,\" my friend continued, \"that he too might have\nchanged back.\"\n\nI took in, for myself, so much more of it than I could say! \"Certainly.\nYou wouldn't have thought he would have changed forward.\" Then with an\nimpulse that bridged over an abyss of connections I jumped to another\nplace. \"Was what you most saw while you were there with _her_--was this\nthat her misery, the misery you first phrased to me, has dropped?\"\n\n\"Dropped, yes.\" He was clear about it. \"I called her beastly unhappy to\nyou though I even then knew that beastly unhappiness wasn't quite all\nof it. It was part of it, it was enough of it; for she was--well, no\ndoubt you could tell _me_. Just now, at all events\"--and recalling,\nreflecting, deciding, he used, with the strongest effect, as he so often\ndid in painting, the simplest term--\"just now she's all right.\"\n\n\"All right?\"\n\nHe couldn't know how much more than was possible my question gave him to\nanswer. But he answered it on what he had; he repeated: \"All right.\"\n\nI wondered, in spite of the comfort I took, as I had more than once in\nlife had occasion to take it before, at the sight of the painter-sense\ndeeply applied. My wonder came from the fact that Lady John had also\nfound Mrs. Server all right, and Lady John had a vision as closed as\nObert's was open. It didn't suit my book for both these observers to\nhave been affected in the same way. \"You mean you saw nothing whatever\nin her that was the least bit strange?\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't say as much as that. But nothing that was more strange than\nthat she _should_ be--well, after all, all right.\"\n\n\"All there, eh?\" I after an instant risked.\n\nI couldn't put it to him more definitely than that, though there was a\ntemptation to try to do so. For Obert to have found her all there an\nhour or two after I had found her all absent, made me again, in my\nnervousness, feel even now a trifle menaced. Things _had_, from step to\nstep, to hang together, and just here they seemed--with all\nallowances--to hang a little apart. My whole superstructure, I could\nonly remember, reared itself on my view of Mrs. Server's condition; but\nit was part of my predicament--really equal in its way to her own--that\nI couldn't without dishonouring myself give my interlocutor a practical\nlead. The question of her happiness was essentially subordinate; what I\nstood or fell by was that of her faculty. But I couldn't, on the other\nhand--and remain \"straight\"--insist to my friend on the whereabouts of\nthis stolen property. If he hadn't missed it in her for himself I\nmightn't put him on the track of it; since, with the demonstration he\nhad before my eyes received of the rate at which Long was, as one had to\ncall it, intellectually living, nothing would be more natural than that\nhe should make the cases fit. Now my personal problem, unaltered in the\nleast particular by anything, was for me to have worked to the end\nwithout breathing in another ear that Long had been her lover. That was\nthe only thing in the whole business that was simple. It made me cling\nan instant the more, both for bliss and bale, to the bearing of this\nfact of Obert's insistence. Even as a sequel to his vision of her\nchange, almost everything was wrong for her being all right except the\none fact of my recent view, from the window, of the man unnamed. I saw\nhim again sharply in these seconds, and to notice how he still kept\nclear of our company was almost to add certitude to the presumption of\nhis rare reasons. Mrs. Server's being now, by a wonderful turn, all\nright would at least decidedly offer to these reasons a basis. It would\nbe something Long's absence would fit. It would supply ground, in short,\nfor the possibility that, by a process not less wonderful, he himself\nwas all wrong. If he _was_ all wrong my last impression of him would be\namply accounted for. If he was all wrong--if he, in any case, felt\nhimself going so--what more consequent than that he should have wished\nto hide it, and that the most immediate way for this should have seemed\nto him, markedly gregarious as he usually was, to keep away from the\nsmokers? It came to me unspeakably that he _was_ still hiding it and\n_was_ keeping away. How, accordingly, must he not--and must not Mrs.\nBriss--have been in the spirit of this from the moment that, while I\ntalked with Lady John, the sight of these two seated together had given\nme its message! But Obert's answer to my guarded challenge had meanwhile\ncome. \"Oh, when a woman's so clever----!\"\n\nThat was all, with its touch of experience and its hint of philosophy;\nbut it was stupefying. She was already then positively again \"so\nclever?\" This was really more than I could as yet provide an\nexplanation for, but I was pressed; Brissenden would have reached his\nwife's room again, and I temporised. \"It was her cleverness that held\nyou so that when I passed you couldn't look at me?\"\n\nHe looked at me at present well enough. \"I knew you were passing, but I\nwanted precisely to mark for you the difference. If you really want to\nknow,\" the poor man confessed, \"I was a little ashamed of myself. I had\ngiven her away to you, you know, rather, before.\"\n\n\"And you were bound you wouldn't do it again?\"\n\nHe smiled in his now complete candour. \"Ah, there was no reason.\" Then\nhe used, happily, to right himself, my own expression. \"She was all\nthere.\"\n\n\"I see--I see.\" Yet I really didn't see enough not to have for an\ninstant to turn away.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n\n\"To do what Brissenden came to me for.\"\n\n\"But I don't _know_, you see, what Brissenden came to you for.\"\n\n\"Well, with a message. She was to have seen me this evening, but, as she\ngave me no chance, I was afraid I had lost it and that, so rather\nawkwardly late, she didn't venture. But what he arrived for just now, at\nher request, was to say she does venture.\"\n\nMy companion stared. \"At this extraordinary hour?\"\n\n\"Ah, the hour,\" I laughed, \"is no more extraordinary than any other part\nof the business: no more so, for instance, than this present talk of\nyours and mine. What part of the business isn't extraordinary? If it\n_is_, at all events, remarkably late, that's _her_ fault.\"\n\nYet he not unnaturally, in spite of my explanation, continued to wonder.\n\"And--a--where is it then you meet?\"\n\n\"Oh, in the drawing-room or the hall. So good-night.\"\n\nHe got up to it, moving with me to the door; but his mystification,\nlittle as I could, on the whole, soothe it, still kept me. \"The\nhousehold sits up for you?\"\n\nI wondered myself, but found an assurance. \"She must have squared the\nhousehold! And it won't probably take us very long.\"\n\nHis mystification frankly confessed itself, at this, plain curiosity.\nThe ground of such a conference, for all the point I had given his\ningenuity, simply baffled him. \"Do you mean you propose to discuss with\nher----?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I smiled with my hand on the door, \"it's _she_--don't\nyou see?--who proposes.\"\n\n\"But what in the world----?\"\n\n\"Oh, _that_ I shall have to wait to tell you.\"\n\n\"With all the other things?\" His face, while he sounded mine, seemed to\nsay that I must then take his expectation as serious. But it seemed to\nsay also that he was--definitely, yes--more at a loss than consorted\nwith being quite sure of me. \"Well, it will make a lot, really----!\" But\nhe broke off. \"You do,\" he sighed with an effort at resignation, \"know\nmore than I!\"\n\n\"And haven't I admitted that?\"\n\n\"I'll be hanged if you _don't_ know who he is!\" the poor fellow, for all\nanswer, now produced.\n\nHe said it as if I had, after all, not been playing fair, and it made me\nfor an instant hesitate. \"No, I really don't know. But it's exactly what\nI shall perhaps now learn.\"\n\n\"You mean that what she has proposed is to _tell_ you?\"\n\nHis darkness had so deepened that I saw only now what I should have seen\nsooner--the misconception that, in my excessive estimate of the distance\nhe had come with me, I had not at first caught. But it was a\nmisconception that only enriched his testimony; it involved such a\nconviction of the new link between our two sacrificed friends that it\nimmediately constituted for me the strongest light he would, in our\nwhole talk, have thrown. Yes, he had not yet thrown so much as in this\nerroneous supposition of the source of my summons. It took me of course,\nat the same time, but a few seconds to remind myself again of the\ninnumerable steps he had necessarily missed. His question meanwhile,\nrightly applied by my own thought, brought back to that thought, by way\nof answer, an immense suggestion, which moreover, for him too, was\ntemporarily answer enough. \"She'll tell me who he _won't_ have been!\"\n\nHe looked vague. \"Ah, but _that_----\"\n\n\"That,\" I declared, \"will be luminous.\"\n\nHe made it out. \"As a sign, you think, that he must be the very one she\ndenies?\"\n\n\"The very one!\" I laughed; and I left him under this simple and secure\nimpression that my appointment was with Mrs. Server.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nI went from one room to the other, but to find only, at first, as on my\nprevious circuit, a desert on which the sun had still not set. Mrs.\nBrissenden was nowhere, but the whole place waited as we had left it,\nwith seats displaced and flowers dispetalled, a fan forgotten on a\ntable, a book laid down upon a chair. It came over me as I looked about\nthat if she _had_ \"squared\" the household, so large an order, as they\nsaid, was a sign sufficient of what I was to have from her. I had quite\nrather it were her doing--not mine; but it showed with eloquence that\nshe had after all judged some effort or other to be worth her while. Her\nrenewed delay moreover added to my impatience of mind in respect to the\nnature of this effort by striking me as already part of it. What, I\nasked myself, could be so much worth her while as to have to be paid for\nby so much apparent reluctance? But at last I saw her through a vista of\nopen doors, and as I forthwith went to her--she took no step to meet\nme--I was doubtless impressed afresh with the \"pull\" that in social\nintercourse a woman always has. She was able to assume on the spot by\nmere attitude and air the appearance of having been ready and therefore\ninconvenienced. Oh, I saw soon enough that she was ready and that one of\nthe forms of her readiness would be precisely to offer herself as having\nacted entirely to oblige me--to give me, as a sequel to what had already\npassed between us, the opportunity for which she had assured me I should\nthank her before I had done with her. Yet, as I felt sure, at the same\ntime, that she had taken a line, I was curious as to how, in her\ninterest, our situation could be worked. What it had originally left us\nwith was her knowing I was wrong. I had promised her, on my honour, to\nbe candid, but even if I were disposed to cease to contest her\nidentification of Mrs. Server I was scarce to be looked to for such an\nexhibition of gratitude as might be held to repay her for staying so\nlong out of bed. There were in short elements in the business that I\ncouldn't quite clearly see handled as favours to me. Her dress gave,\nwith felicity, no sign whatever of preparation for the night, and if,\nsince our last words, she had stood with any anxiety whatever before her\nglass, it had not been to remove a jewel or to alter the place of a\nflower. She was as much under arms as she had been on descending to\ndinner--as fresh in her array as if that banquet were still to come. She\nmet me in fact as admirably--that was the truth that covered every\nother--as if she had been able to guess the most particular curiosity\nwith which, from my end of the series of rooms, I advanced upon her.\n\nA part of the mixture of my thoughts during these seconds had been the\npossibility--absurd, preposterous though it looks when phrased here--of\nsome change in her person that would correspond, for me to the other\nchanges I had had such keen moments of flattering myself I had made out.\nI had just had them over in the smoking-room, some of these differences,\nand then had had time to ask myself if I were not now to be treated to\nthe vision of the greatest, the most wonderful, of all. I had already,\non facing her, after my last moments with Lady John, seen difference\npeep out at me, and I had seen the impression of it confirmed by what\nhad afterwards happened. It had been in her way of turning from me after\nthat brief passage; it had been in her going up to bed without seeing me\nagain; it had been once more in her thinking, for reasons of her own,\nbetter of that; and it had been most of all in her sending her husband\ndown to me. Well, wouldn't it finally be, still more than most of\nall----? But I scarce had known, at this point, what grossness or what\nfineness of material correspondence to forecast. I only had waited there\nwith these general symptoms so present that almost any further\ndevelopment of them occurred to me as conceivable. So much as this was\ntrue, but I was after a moment to become aware of something by which I\nwas as strongly affected as if I had been quite unprepared. Yes,\nliterally, that final note, in the smoking-room, the note struck in\nObert's ejaculation on poor Briss's hundred years, had failed to achieve\nfor me a worthy implication. I was forced, after looking at Grace\nBrissenden a minute, to recognise that my imagination had not risen to\nits opportunity. The full impression took a minute--a minute during\nwhich she said nothing; then it left me deeply and above all, as I felt,\ndiscernibly conscious of the prodigious thing, _the_ thing, I had not\nthought of. This it was that gave her such a beautiful chance not to\nspeak: she was so quite sufficiently occupied with seeing what I hadn't\nthought of, and with seeing me, to make up for lost time, breathlessly\nthink of it while she watched me.\n\nAll I had at first taken in was, as I say, her untouched splendour; I\ndon't know why that should have impressed me--as if it had been probable\nshe would have appeared in her dressing-gown; it was the only thing to\nhave expected. And it in fact plumed and enhanced her assurance,\nsustained her propriety, lent our belated interview the natural and\ncasual note. But there was another service it still more rendered her:\nit so covered, at the first blush, the real message of her aspect, that\nshe enjoyed the luxury--and I felt her enjoy it--of seeing my perception\nin arrest. Amazing, when I think of it, the number of things that\noccurred in these stayed seconds of our silence; but they are perhaps\nbest represented by the two most marked intensities of my own sensation:\nthe first the certitude that she had at no moment since her marriage so\ntriumphantly asserted her defeat of time, and the second the conviction\nthat I, losing with her while, as it were, we closed, a certain\nadvantage I should never recover, had at no moment since the day before\nmade so poor a figure on my own ground. Ah, it may have been only for\nsix seconds that she caught me gaping at her renewed beauty; but six\nseconds, it was inevitable to feel, were quite enough for every purpose\nwith which she had come down to me. She might have been a large, fair,\nrich, prosperous person of twenty-five; she was at any rate near enough\nto it to put me for ever in my place. It was a success, on her part,\nthat, though I couldn't as yet fully measure it, there could be no doubt\nof whatever, any more than of my somehow paying for it. Her being there\nat all, at such an hour, in such conditions, became, each moment, on the\nwhole business, more and more a part of her advantage; the case for her\nwas really in almost any aspect she could now make it wear to my\nimagination. My wealth of that faculty, never so stimulated, was thus,\nin a manner, her strength; by which I mean the impossibility of my\nindifference to the mere immense suggestiveness of our circumstances.\nHow can I tell now to what tune the sense of all these played into my\nmind?--the huge oddity of the nameless idea on which we foregathered,\nthe absence and hush of everything except that idea, so magnified in\nconsequence and yet still, after all, altogether fantastic. There\nremained for her, there spoke for her too, her vividly \"unconventional\"\nstep, the bravery of her rustling, on an understanding so difficult to\ngive an account of, through places and times only made safe by the sleep\nof the unsuspecting. My imagination, in short, since I have spoken of\nit, couldn't do other than work for her from the moment she had, so\nsimply yet so wonderfully, not failed me. Therefore it was all with me\nagain, the vision of her reasons. They were in fact sufficiently in the\nsound of what she presently said. \"Perhaps you don't know--but I\nmentioned in the proper quarter that I should sit up a little. They're\nof a kindness here, luckily----! So it's all right.\" It was all right,\nobviously--she made it so; but she made it so as well that, in spite of\nthe splendour she showed me, she should be a little nervous. \"We shall\nonly take moreover,\" she added, \"a minute.\"\n\nI should perhaps have wondered more what she proposed to do in a minute\nhad I not felt it as already more or less done. Yes, she might have been\ntwenty-five, and it was a short time for _that_ to have taken. However,\nwhat I clutched at, what I clung to, was that it was a nervous\ntwenty-five. I might pay for her assurance, but wasn't there something\nof mine for which _she_ might pay? I was nervous also, but, as I took in\nagain, with a glance through our great chain of chambers, the wonderful\nconditions that protected us, I did my best to feel sure that it was\nonly because I was so amused. That--in so high a form--was what it came\nto in the end. \"I supposed,\" I replied, \"that you'd have arranged; for,\nin spite of the way things were going, I hadn't given you up. I haven't\nunderstood, I confess,\" I went on, \"why you've preferred a conference so\nintensely nocturnal--of which I quite feel, however, that, if it has\nhappened to suit you, it isn't for me to complain. But I felt sure of\nyou--that was the great thing--from the moment, half an hour ago, you so\nkindly spoke to me. I gave you, you see,\" I laughed, \"what's called\n'rope.'\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you mean,\" she exclaimed, \"for me to hang myself!--for\nthat, I assure you, is not at all what I'm prepared for.\" Then she\nseemed again to give me the magnificence of her youth. It wasn't,\nthroughout, I was to feel, that she at all had abysses of irony, for she\nin fact happily needed none. Her triumph was in itself ironic enough,\nand all her point in her sense of her freshness. \"Were you really so\nimpatient?\" But as I inevitably hung fire a little she continued before\nI could answer; which somewhat helped me indeed by showing the one flaw\nin her confidence. More extraordinary perhaps than anything else,\nmoreover, was just my perception of this; which gives the value of all\nthat each of us so visibly felt the other to have put together, to have\nbeen making out and gathering in, since we parted, on the terrace, after\nseeing Mrs. Server and Briss come up from under their tree. We _had_, of\na truth, arrived at our results--though mine were naturally the ones for\nme to believe in; and it was prodigious that we openly met not at all\nwhere we had last left each other, but exactly on what our subsequent\nsuppressed processes had achieved. We hadn't named them--hadn't alluded\nto them, and we couldn't, no doubt, have done either; but they were none\nthe less intensely there between us, with the whole bright, empty scene\ngiven up to them. Only she had her shrewd sense that mine, for reasons,\nmight have been still more occult than her own. Hadn't I possibly\nburrowed the deeper--to come out in some uncalculated place behind her\nback? That was the flaw in her confidence. She had in spite of it her\nfirm ground, and I could feel, to do her justice, how different a\ncomplacency it was from such smug ignorance as Lady John's. If I didn't\nfear to seem to drivel about my own knowledge I should say that she had,\nin addition to all the rest of her \"pull,\" the benefit of striking me as\nworthy of me. She was _in_ the mystic circle--not one of us more; she\nknew the size of it; and it was our now being in it alone together, with\neveryone else out and with the size greater than it had yet been at\nall--it was this that gave the hour, in fine, so sharp a stamp.\n\nBut she had meanwhile taken up my allusion to her having preferred so to\nwait. \"I wanted to see you quietly; which was what I tried--not\naltogether successfully, it rather struck me at the moment--to make you\nunderstand when I let you know about it. You stared so that I didn't\nquite know what was the matter. Nothing could be quiet, I saw, till the\ngoing to bed was over, and I felt it coming off then from one minute to\nthe other. I didn't wish publicly to be called away for it from this\nputting of our heads together, and, though you may think me absurd, I\nhad a dislike to having our question of May up so long as she was\nhanging about. I knew of course that she would hang about till the very\nlast moment, and that was what I perhaps a little clumsily--if it was my\nown fault!--made the effort to convey to you. She may be hanging about\nstill,\" Mrs. Briss continued, with her larger look round--her looks\nround were now immense; \"but at any rate I shall have done what I could.\nI had a feeling--perfectly preposterous, I admit!--against her seeing us\ntogether; but if she comes down again, as I've so boldly done, and finds\nus, she'll have no one but herself to thank. It's a funny house, for\nthat matter,\" my friend rambled on, \"and I'm not sure that anyone _has_\ngone to bed. One does what one likes; I'm an old woman, at any rate, and\n_I_ do!\" She explained now, she explained too much, she abounded,\ntalking herself stoutly into any assurance that failed her. I had\nmeanwhile with every word she uttered a sharper sense of the pressure,\nbehind them all, of a new consciousness. It was full of everything she\ndidn't say, and what she said was no representation whatever of what was\nmost in her mind. We had indeed taken a jump since noon--we had indeed\ncome out further on. Just this fine dishonesty of her eyes,\nmoreover--the light of a part to play, the excitement (heaven knows what\nit struck me as being!) of a happy duplicity--may well have been what\ncontributed most to her present grand air.\n\nIt was in any case what evoked for me most the contrasted image, so\nfresh with me, of the other, the tragic lady--the image that had so\nembodied the unutterable opposite of everything actually before me. What\nwas actually before me was the positive pride of life and expansion, the\namplitude of conscious action and design; not the arid channel forsaken\nby the stream, but the full-fed river sweeping to the sea, the volume of\nwater, the stately current, the flooded banks into which the source had\nswelled. There was nothing Mrs. Server had been able to risk, but there\nwas a rich indifference to risk in the mere carriage of Grace\nBrissenden's head. Her reference, for that matter, to our discussed\nsubject had the effect of relegating to the realm of dim shades the lady\nrepresenting it, and there was small soundness in her glance at the\npossibility on the part of this person of an anxious prowl back. There\nwas indeed--there could be--small sincerity in any immediate\ndemonstration from a woman so markedly gaining time and getting her\nadvantages in hand. The connections between the two, certainly, were\nindirect and intricate, but it was positive to me that, for the\nspiritual ear, my companion's words had the sound of a hard bump, a\ncontact from the force of which the weaker vessel might have been felt\nto crack. At last, merciful powers, it was in pieces! The shock of the\nbrass had told upon the porcelain, and I fancied myself for an instant\nfacing Mrs. Briss over the damage--a damage from which I was never, as I\nknew, to see the poor banished ghost recover. As strange as anything was\nthis effect almost of surprise for me in the freedom of her mention of\n\"May.\" For what had she come to me, if for anything, but to insist on\nher view of May, and what accordingly was more to the point than to\nmention her? Yet it was almost already as if to mention her had been to\nget rid of her. She was mentioned, however, inevitably and none the less\npromptly, anew--even as if simply to receive a final shake before being\nquite dropped. My friend kept it up. \"If you were so bent on not losing\nwhat I might have to give you that you fortunately stuck to the ship,\nfor poor Briss to pick you up, wasn't this also\"--she roundly put it to\nme--\"a good deal because you've been nursing all day the grievance with\nwhich I this morning so comfortably furnished you?\"\n\nI just waited, but fairly for admiration. \"Oh, I certainly had my\nreasons--as I've no less certainly had my luck--for not indeed deserting\nour dear little battered, but still just sufficiently buoyant vessel,\nfrom which everyone else appears, I recognise, to _s'\u00c3\u00aatre sauv\u00c3\u00a9_. She'll\nfloat a few minutes more! But (before she sinks!) do you mean by my\ngrievance----\"\n\n\"Oh, you know what I mean by your grievance!\" _She_ had no intention,\nMrs. Briss, of sinking. \"I was to give you time to make up your mind\nthat Mrs. Server was our lady. You so resented, for some reason, my\nsuggesting it that I scarcely believed you'd consider it at all; only I\nhadn't forgotten, when I spoke to you a while since, that you had\nnevertheless handsomely promised me that you would do your best.\"\n\n\"Yes, and, still more handsomely, that if I changed my mind, I would\neat, in your presence, for my error, the largest possible slice of\nhumble pie. If you didn't see this morning,\" I continued, \"quite why I\nshould have cared so much, so I don't quite see why, in your different\nway, _you_ should; at the same time that I do full justice to the good\nfaith with which you've given me my chance. Please believe that if I\n_could_ candidly embrace that chance I should feel all the joy in the\nworld in repaying you. It's only, alas! because I cling to my candour\nthat I venture to disappoint you. If I cared this morning it was really\nsimple enough. You didn't convince me, but I should have cared just as\nmuch if you had. I only didn't see what _you_ saw. I needed more than\nyou could then give me. I knew, you see, what I needed--I mean before I\nstruck! It was the element of collateral support that we both lacked. I\ncouldn't do without it as you could. This was what I, clumsily enough,\ntried to show you I felt. You, on your side,\" I pursued, \"grasped\nadmirably the evident truth that that element _could_ be present only in\nsuch doses as practically to escape detection.\" I kept it up as she had\ndone, and I remember striking myself as scarce less excitedly voluble. I\nwas conscious of being at a point at which I should have to go straight,\nto go fast, to go it, as the phrase is, blind, in order to go at all. I\nwas also conscious--and it came from the look with which she listened to\nme and that told me more than she wished--I felt sharply, though but\ninstinctively, in fine, that I should still, whatever I practically had\nlost, make my personal experience most rich and most complete by putting\nit definitely to her that, sorry as I might be not to oblige her, I\nhad, even at this hour, no submission to make. I doubted in fact whether\nmy making one _would_ have obliged her; but I felt that, for all so much\nhad come and gone, I was not there to take, for her possible profit, any\nnew tone with her. She would sufficiently profit, at the worst, by the\nold. My old motive--old with the prodigious antiquity the few hours had\ngiven it--had quite left me; I seemed to myself to know little now of my\ndesire to \"protect\" Mrs. Server. She was certainly, with Mrs. Briss at\nleast, past all protection; and the conviction had grown with me, in\nthese few minutes, that there was now no rag of the queer truth that\nMrs. Briss hadn't secretly--by which I meant morally--handled. But I\nnone the less, on a perfectly simple reasoning, stood to my guns, and\nwith no sense whatever, I must add, of now breaking my vow of the\nmorning. I had made another vow since then--made it to the poor lady\nherself as we sat together in the wood; passed my word to _her_ that\nthere was no approximation I pretended even to myself to have made. How\nthen was I to pretend to Mrs. Briss, and what facts _had_ I collected on\nwhich I could respectably ground an acknowledgment to her that I had\ncome round to her belief? If I had \"caught\" our incriminated pair\ntogether--really together--even for three minutes, I would, I sincerely\nconsidered, have come round. But I was to have performed this\nrevolution on nothing less, as I now went on to explain to her. \"Of\ncourse if you've got new evidence I shall be delighted to hear it; and\nof course I can't help wondering whether the possession of it and the\ndesire to overwhelm me with it aren't, together, the one thing you've\nbeen nursing till now.\"\n\nOh, how intensely she didn't like such a tone! If she hadn't looked so\nhandsome I would say she made a wry face over it, though I didn't even\nyet see where her dislike would make her come out. Before she came out,\nin fact, she waited as if it were a question of dashing her head at a\nwall. Then, at last, she charged. \"It's nonsense. I've nothing to tell\nyou. I feel there's nothing in it and I've given it up.\"\n\nI almost gaped--by which I mean that I looked as if I did--for surprise.\n\"You agree that it's not she----?\" Then, as she again waited, \"It's\n_you_ who've come round?\" I insisted.\n\n\"To your doubt of its being May? Yes--I've come round.\"\n\n\"Ah, pardon me,\" I returned; \"what I expressed this morning was, if I\nremember rightly, not at all a 'doubt,' but a positive, intimate\nconviction that was inconsistent with _any_ doubt. I was\nemphatic--purely and simply--that I didn't see it.\"\n\nShe looked, however, as if she caught me in a weakness here. \"Then why\ndid you say to me that if you should reconsider----\"\n\n\"You should handsomely have it from me, and my grounds? Why, as I've\njust reminded you, as a form of courtesy to you--magnanimously to help\nyou, as it were, to feel as comfortable as I conceived you naturally\nwould desire to feel in your own conviction. Only for that. And now,\" I\nsmiled, \"I'm to understand from you that, in spite of that immense\nallowance, you _haven't_, all this while, felt comfortable?\"\n\nShe gave, on this, in a wonderful, beautiful way, a slow, simplifying\nheadshake. \"Mrs. Server isn't in it!\"\n\nThe only way then to take it from her was that her concession was a\nprelude to something still better; and when I had given her time to see\nthis dawn upon me I had my eagerness and I jumped into the breathless.\n\"You've made out then who _is_?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't make out, you know,\" she laughed, \"so much as you! _She_\nisn't,\" she simply repeated.\n\nI looked at it, on my inspiration, quite ruefully--almost as if I now\nwished, after all, she were. \"Ah, but, do you know? it really strikes me\nyou make out marvels. You made out this morning quite what I couldn't. I\nhadn't put together anything so extraordinary as that--in the total\nabsence of everything--it _should_ have been our friend.\"\n\nMrs. Briss appeared, on her side, to take in the intention of this.\n\"What do you mean by the total absence? When I made my mistake,\" she\ndeclared as if in the interest of her dignity, \"I didn't think\neverything absent.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I admitted. \"I see,\" I thoughtfully repeated. \"And do you,\nthen, think everything now?\"\n\n\"I had my honest impression of the moment,\" she pursued as if she had\nnot heard me. \"There were appearances that, as it at the time struck me,\nfitted.\"\n\n\"Precisely\"--and I recalled for her the one she had made most of. \"There\nwas in especial the appearance that she was at a particular moment using\nBrissenden to show whom she was not using. You felt _then_,\" I ventured\nto observe, \"the force of that.\"\n\nI ventured less than, already, I should have liked to venture; yet I\nnone the less seemed to see her try on me the effect of the intimation\nthat I was going far. \"Is it your wish,\" she inquired with much\nnobleness, \"to confront me, to my confusion, with my inconsistency?\" Her\nnobleness offered itself somehow as such a rebuke to my mere logic that,\nin my momentary irritation, I might have been on the point of assenting\nto her question. This imminence of my assent, justified by my horror of\nher huge egotism, but justified by nothing else and precipitating\neverything, seemed as marked for these few seconds as if we each had our\neyes on it. But I sat so tight that the danger passed, leaving my\nsilence to do what it could for my manners. She proceeded meanwhile to\nadd a very handsome account of her own. \"You should do me the justice to\nrecognise how little I need have spoken another word to you, and how\nlittle, also, this amiable explanation to you is in the interest of\none's natural pride. It seems to me I've come to you here altogether in\nthe interest of _yours_. You talk about humble pie, but I think that,\nupon my word--with all I've said to you--it's I who have had to eat it.\nThe magnanimity you speak of,\" she continued with all her grandeur--\"I\nreally don't see, either, whose it is but mine. I don't see what account\nof anything I'm in any way obliged to give.\"\n\nI granted it quickly and without reserve. \"You're not obliged to give\nany--you're quite right: you do it only because you're such a large,\nsplendid creature. I quite feel that, beside you\"--I did, at least,\ntreat myself to the amusement of saying--\"I move in a tiny circle.\nStill, I won't have it\"--I could also, again, keep it up--\"that our\noccasion has nothing for you but the taste of abasement. You gulp your\nmouthful down, but hasn't it been served on gold plate? You've had a\nmagnificent day--a brimming cup of triumph, and you're more beautiful\nand fresh, after it all, and at an hour when fatigue would be almost\npositively graceful, than you were even this morning, when you met me as\na daughter of the dawn. That's the sort of sense,\" I laughed, \"that\nmust sustain a woman!\" And I wound up on a complete recovery of my\ngood-humour. \"No, no. I thank you--thank you immensely. But I don't pity\nyou. You can afford to lose.\" I wanted her perplexity--the proper sharp\ndose of it--to result both from her knowing and her not knowing\nsufficiently what I meant; and when I in fact saw how perplexed she\ncould be and how little, again, she could enjoy it, I felt anew my\nprivate wonder at her having cared and dared to meet me. Where _was_\nenjoyment, for her, where the insolence of success, if the breath of\nirony could chill them? Why, since she was bold, should she be\nsusceptible, and how, since she was susceptible, could she be bold? I\nscarce know what, at this moment, determined the divination; but\neverything, the distinct and the dim alike, had cleared up the next\ninstant at the touch of the real truth. The certitude of the source of\nmy present opportunity had rolled over me before we exchanged another\nword. The source was simply Gilbert Long, and she was there because he\nhad directed it. This connection hooked itself, like a sudden picture\nand with a click that fairly resounded through our empty rooms, into the\narray of the other connections, to the immense enrichment, as it was\neasy to feel, of the occasion, and to the immense confirmation of the\nvery idea that, in the course of the evening, I had come near dismissing\nfrom my mind as too fantastic even for the rest of the company it\nshould enjoy there. What I now was sure of flashed back, at any rate,\nevery syllable of sense I could have desired into the suggestion I had,\nafter the music, caught from the juxtaposition of these two. Thus\nsolidified, this conviction, it spread and spread to a distance greater\nthan I could just then traverse under Mrs. Briss's eyes, but which,\nexactly for that reason perhaps, quickened my pride in the kingdom of\nthought I had won. I was really not to have felt more, in the whole\nbusiness, than I felt at this moment that by my own right hand I had\ngained the kingdom. Long and she were together, and I was alone thus in\nface of them, but there was none the less not a single flower of the\ngarden that my woven wreath should lack.\n\nI must have looked queer to my friend as I grinned to myself over this\nvow; but my relish of the way I was keeping things together made me\nperhaps for the instant unduly rash. I cautioned myself, however,\nfortunately, before it could leave her--scared a little, all the same,\neven with Long behind her--an advantage to take, and, in infinitely less\ntime than I have needed to tell it, I had achieved my flight into\nluminous ether and, alighting gracefully on my feet, reported myself at\nmy post. I had in other words taken in both the full prodigy of the\n_entente_ between Mrs. Server's lover and poor Briss's wife, and the\nfiner strength it gave the last-named as the representative of their\ninterest. I may add too that I had even taken time fairly not to decide\nwhich of these two branches of my vision--that of the terms of their\nintercourse, or that of their need of it--was likely to prove, in\ndelectable retrospect, the more exquisite. All this, I admit, was a good\ndeal to have come and gone while my privilege trembled, in its very\nessence, in the scale. Mrs. Briss had but a back to turn, and everything\nwas over. She had, in strictness, already uttered what saved her honour,\nand her revenge on impertinence might easily be her withdrawing with one\nof her sweeps. I couldn't certainly in that case hurry after her without\nspilling my cards. As my accumulations of lucidity, however, were now\nsuch as to defy all leakage, I promptly recognised the facilities\ninvolved in a superficial sacrifice; and with one more glance at the\nbeautiful fact that she knew the strength of Long's hand, I again went\nsteadily and straight. She was acting not only for herself, and since\nshe had another also to serve and, as I was sure, report to, I should\nsufficiently hold her. I knew moreover that I held her as soon as I had\nbegun afresh. \"I don't mean that anything alters the fact that you lose\ngracefully. It _is_ awfully charming, your thus giving yourself up, and\nyet, justified as I am by it, I can't help regretting a little the\nexcitement I found it this morning to pull a different way from you.\nShall I tell you,\" it suddenly came to me to put to her, \"what, for\nsome reason, a man feels aware of?\" And then as, guarded, still uneasy,\nshe would commit herself to no permission: \"That pulling against you\nalso had its thrill. You defended your cause. Oh,\" I quickly added, \"I\nknow--who should know better?--that it was bad. Only--what shall I\nsay?--_you_ weren't bad, and one had to fight. And then there was what\none was fighting for! Well, you're not bad now, either; so that you may\nask me, of course, what more I want.\" I tried to think a moment. \"It\nisn't that, thrown back on the comparative dullness of security, I\nfind--as people have been known to--my own cause less good: no, it isn't\nthat.\" After which I had my illumination. \"I'll tell you what it is:\nit's the come-down of ceasing to work with you!\"\n\nShe looked as if she were quite excusable for not following me. \"To\n'work'?\"\n\nI immediately explained. \"Even fighting was working, for we struck,\nyou'll remember, sparks, and sparks were what we wanted. There we are\nthen,\" I cheerfully went on. \"Sparks are what we still want, and you've\nnot come to me, I trust, with a mere spent match. I depend upon it that\nyou've another to strike.\" I showed her without fear all I took for\ngranted. \"Who, then, _has_?\"\n\nShe was superb in her coldness, but her stare was partly blank. \"Who\nthen has what?\"\n\n\"Why, done it.\" And as even at this she didn't light I gave her\nsomething of a jog. \"You haven't, with the force of your revulsion, I\nhope, literally lost our thread.\" But as, in spite of my thus waiting\nfor her to pick it up she did nothing, I offered myself as fairly\nstooping to the carpet for it and putting it back in her hand. \"Done\nwhat we spent the morning wondering at. Who then, if it isn't,\ncertainly, Mrs. Server, _is_ the woman who has made Gilbert Long--well,\nwhat you know?\"\n\nI had needed the moment to take in the special shade of innocence she\nwas by this time prepared to show me. It was an innocence, in\nparticular, in respect to the relation of anyone, in all the vast\nimpropriety of things, to anyone. \"I'm afraid I know nothing.\"\n\nI really wondered an instant how she could expect help from such\nextravagance. \"But I thought you just recognised that you do enjoy the\nsense of your pardonable mistake. You knew something when you knew\nenough to see you had made it.\"\n\nShe faced me as with the frank perception that, of whatever else one\nmight be aware, I abounded in traps, and that this would probably be one\nof my worst. \"Oh, I think one generally knows when one has made a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"That's all then I invite you--_a_ mistake, as you properly call it--to\nallow me to impute to you. I'm not accusing you of having made fifty.\nYou made none whatever, I hold, when you agreed with me with such\neagerness about the striking change in him.\"\n\nShe affected me as asking herself a little, on this, whether vagueness,\nthe failure of memory, the rejection of nonsense, mightn't still serve\nher. But she saw the next moment a better way. It all came back to her,\nbut from so very far off. \"The change, do you mean, in poor Mr. Long?\"\n\n\"Of what other change--except, as you may say, your own--have you met me\nhere to speak of? Your own, I needn't remind you, is part and parcel of\nLong's.\"\n\n\"Oh, my own,\" she presently returned, \"is a much simpler matter even\nthan that. My own is the recognition that I just expressed to you and\nthat I can't consent, if you please, to your twisting into the\nrecognition of anything else. It's the recognition that I know nothing\nof any other change. I stick, if you'll allow me, to my ignorance.\"\n\n\"I'll allow you with joy,\" I laughed, \"if you'll let me stick to it\n_with_ you. Your own change is quite sufficient--it gives us all we\nneed. It will give us, if we retrace the steps of it, everything,\neverything!\"\n\nMrs. Briss considered. \"I don't quite see, do I? why, at this hour of\nthe night, we should begin to retrace steps.\"\n\n\"Simply because it's the hour of the night you've happened, in your\ngenerosity and your discretion, to choose. I'm struck, I confess,\" I\ndeclared with a still sharper conviction, \"with the wonderful charm of\nit for our purpose.\"\n\n\"And, pray, what do you call with such solemnity,\" she inquired, \"our\npurpose?\"\n\nI had fairly recovered at last--so far from being solemn--an appropriate\ngaiety. \"I can only, with positiveness, answer for mine! That has\nremained all day the same--to get at the truth: not, that is, to relax\nmy grasp of that tip of the tail of it which you so helped me this\nmorning to fasten to. If you've ceased to _care_ to help me,\" I pursued,\n\"that's a difference indeed. But why,\" I candidly, pleadingly asked,\n\"_should_ you cease to care?\" It was more and more of a comfort to feel\nher imprisoned in her inability really to explain her being there. To\nshow herself as she was explained it only so far as she could express\nthat; which was just the freedom she could least take. \"What on earth is\nbetween us, anyhow,\" I insisted, \"but our confounded interest? That's\nonly quickened, for me, don't you see? by the charming way you've come\nround; and I don't see how it can logically be anything less than\nquickened for yourself. We're like the messengers and heralds in the\ntale of Cinderella, and I protest, I assure you, against any sacrifice\nof our d\u00c3\u00a9no\u00c3\u00bbment. We've still the glass shoe to fit.\"\n\nI took pleasure at the moment in my metaphor; but this was not the\ncase, I soon enough perceived, with my companion. \"How can I tell,\nplease,\" she demanded, \"what you consider you're talking about?\"\n\nI smiled; it was so quite the question Ford Obert, in the smoking-room,\nhad begun by putting me. I hadn't to take time to remind myself how I\nhad dealt with _him_. \"And you knew,\" I sighed, \"so beautifully, you\nglowed over it so, this morning!\" She continued to give me, in every\nway, her disconnection from this morning, so that I had only to proceed:\n\"You've not availed yourself of this occasion to pretend to me that poor\nMr. Long, as you call him, is, after all, the same limited person----\"\n\n\"That he always was, and that you, yesterday, so suddenly discovered him\nto have ceased to be?\"--for with this she had waked up. But she was\nstill thinking how she could turn it. \"You see too much.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know I do--ever so much too much. And much as I see, I express\nonly half of it--so you may judge!\" I laughed. \"But what will you have?\nI see what I see, and this morning, for a good bit, you did me the\nhonour to do the same. I returned, also, the compliment, didn't I? by\nseeing something of what _you_ saw. We put it, the whole thing,\ntogether, and we shook the bottle hard. I'm to take from you, after\nthis,\" I wound up, \"that what it contains is a perfectly colourless\nfluid?\"\n\nI paused for a reply, but it was not to come so happily as from Obert.\n\"You talk too much!\" said Mrs. Briss.\n\nI met it with amazement. \"Why, whom have I told?\"\n\nI looked at her so hard with it that her colour began to rise, which\nmade me promptly feel that she wouldn't press that point. \"I mean you're\ncarried away--you're abused by a fine fancy: so that, with your art of\nputting things, one doesn't know where one is--nor, if you'll allow me\nto say so, do I quite think _you_ always do. Of course I don't deny\nyou're awfully clever. But you build up,\" she brought out with a regret\nso indulgent and a reluctance so marked that she for some seconds fairly\nheld the blow--\"you build up houses of cards.\"\n\nI had been impatient to learn what, and, frankly, I was disappointed.\nThis broke from me, after an instant, doubtless, with a bitterness not\nto be mistaken. \"Long _isn't_ what he seems?\"\n\n\"Seems to whom?\" she asked sturdily.\n\n\"Well, call it--for simplicity--to _me_. For you see\"--and I spoke as to\nshow _what_ it was to see--\"it all stands or falls by that.\"\n\nThe explanation presently appeared a little to have softened her. If it\nall stood or fell only by _that_, it stood or fell by something that,\nfor her comfort, might be not so unsuccessfully disposed of. She\nexhaled, with the swell of her fine person, a comparative\nblandness--seemed to play with the idea of a smile. She had, in short,\nher own explanation. \"The trouble with you is that you over-estimate the\npenetration of others. How can it approach your own?\"\n\n\"Well, yours had for a while, I should say, distinct moments of keeping\nup with it. Nothing is more possible,\" I went on, \"than that I do talk\ntoo much; but I've done so--about the question in dispute between\nus--only to _you_. I haven't, as I conceived we were absolutely not to\ndo, mentioned it to anyone else, nor given anyone a glimpse of our\ndifference. If you've not understood yourself as pledged to the same\nreserve, and have consequently,\" I went on, \"appealed to the light of\nother wisdom, it shows at least that, in spite of my intellectual pace,\nyou must more or less have followed me. What am I _not_, in fine, to\nthink of your intelligence,\" I asked, \"if, deciding for a resort to\nheadquarters, you've put the question to Long himself?\"\n\n\"The question?\" She was straight out to sea again.\n\n\"Of the identity of the lady.\"\n\nShe slowly, at this, headed about. \"To Long himself?\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nI had felt I could risk such directness only by making it\nextravagant--by suggesting it as barely imaginable that she could so\nhave played our game; and during the instant for which I had now pulled\nher up I could judge I had been right. It was an instant that settled\neverything, for I saw her, with intensity, with gallantry too, surprised\nbut not really embarrassed, recognise that of course she must simply\nlie. I had been justified by making it so possible for her to lie. \"It\nwould have been a short cut,\" I said, \"and even more strikingly\nperhaps--to do it justice--a bold deed. But it would have been, in\nstrictness, a departure--wouldn't it?--from our so distinguished little\ncompact. Yet while I look at you,\" I went on, \"I wonder. Bold deeds are,\nafter all, quite in your line; and I'm not sure I don't rather want not\nto have missed so much possible comedy. 'I have it for you from Mr. Long\nhimself that, every appearance to the contrary notwithstanding, his\nstupidity is unimpaired'--isn't that, for the beauty of it, after all,\nwhat you've veraciously to give me?\" We stood face to face a moment, and\nI laughed out. \"The beauty of it would be great!\"\n\nI had given her time; I had seen her safely to shore. It was quite what\nI had meant to do, but she now took still better advantage than I had\nexpected of her opportunity. She not only scrambled up the bank, she\nrecovered breath and turned round. \"Do you imagine he would have told\nme?\"\n\nIt was magnificent, but I felt she was still to better it should I give\nher a new chance. \"Who the lady really is? Well, hardly; and that's why,\nas you so acutely see, the question of your having risked such a step\nhas occurred to me only as a jest. Fancy indeed\"--I piled it up--\"your\nsaying to him: 'We're all noticing that you're so much less of an idiot\nthan you used to be, and we've different views of the miracle'!\"\n\nI had been going on, but I was checked without a word from her. Her look\nalone did it, for, though it was a look that partly spoiled her lie,\nit--by that very fact--sufficed to my confidence. \"I've not spoken to a\ncreature.\"\n\nIt was beautifully said, but I felt again the abysses that the mere\nsaying of it covered, and the sense of these wonderful things was not a\nlittle, no doubt, in my immediate cheer. \"Ah, then, we're all right!\" I\ncould have rubbed my hands over it. \"I mean, however,\" I quickly added,\n\"only as far as that. I don't at all feel comfortable about your new\ntheory itself, which puts me so wretchedly in the wrong.\"\n\n\"Rather!\" said Mrs. Briss almost gaily. \"Wretchedly indeed in the\nwrong!\"\n\n\"Yet only--equally of course,\" I returned after a brief brooding, \"if I\ncome within a conceivability of accepting it. Are you conscious that, in\ndefault of Long's own word--equivocal as that word would be--you press\nit upon me without the least other guarantee?\"\n\n\"And pray,\" she asked, \"what guarantee had _you_?\"\n\n\"For the theory with which we started? Why, our recognised fact. The\nchange in the man. You may say,\" I pursued, \"that I was the first to\nspeak for him; but being the first didn't, in your view, constitute a\nweakness when it came to your speaking yourself for Mrs. Server. By\nwhich I mean,\" I added, \"speaking against her.\"\n\nShe remembered, but not for my benefit. \"Well, you then asked me _my_\nwarrant. And as regards Mr. Long and your speaking against _him_----\"\n\n\"Do you describe what I say as 'against' him?\" I immediately broke in.\n\nIt took her but an instant. \"Surely--to have made him out horrid.\"\n\nI could only want to fix it. \"'Horrid'----?\"\n\n\"Why, having such secrets.\" She was roundly ready now. \"Sacrificing poor\nMay.\"\n\n\"But _you_, dear lady, sacrificed poor May! It didn't strike you as\nhorrid _then_.\"\n\n\"Well, that was only,\" she maintained, \"because you talked me over.\"\n\nI let her see the full process of my taking--or not taking--this in.\n\"And who is it then that--if, as you say, you've spoken to no one--has,\nas I may call it, talked you under?\"\n\nShe completed, on the spot, her statement of a moment before. \"Not a\ncreature has spoken to me.\"\n\nI felt somehow the wish to make her say it in as many ways as\npossible--I seemed so to enjoy her saying it. This helped me to make my\ntone approve and encourage. \"You've communicated so little with anyone!\"\nI didn't even make it a question.\n\nIt was scarce yet, however, quite good enough. \"So little? I've not\ncommunicated the least mite.\"\n\n\"Precisely. But don't think me impertinent for having for a moment\nwondered. What I should say to you if you had, you know, would be that\nyou just accused me.\"\n\n\"Accused you?\"\n\n\"Of talking too much.\"\n\nIt came back to her dim. \"Are we accusing each other?\"\n\nHer tone seemed suddenly to put us nearer together than we had ever been\nat all. \"Dear no,\" I laughed--\"not each other; only with each other's\nhelp, a few of our good friends.\"\n\n\"A few?\" She handsomely demurred. \"But one or two at the best.\"\n\n\"Or at the worst!\"--I continued to laugh. \"And not even those, it after\nall appears, very much!\"\n\nShe didn't like my laughter, but she was now grandly indulgent. \"Well, I\naccuse no one.\"\n\nI was silent a little; then I concurred. \"It's doubtless your best line;\nand I really quite feel, at all events, that when you mentioned a while\nsince that I talk too much you only meant too much to _you_.\"\n\n\"Yes--I wasn't imputing to you the same direct appeal. I didn't\nsuppose,\" she explained, \"that--to match your own supposition of\n_me_--you had resorted to May herself.\"\n\n\"You didn't suppose I had asked her?\" The point was positively that she\ndidn't; yet it made us look at each other almost as hard as if she did.\n\"No, of course you couldn't have supposed anything so cruel--all the\nmore that, as you knew, I had not admitted the possibility.\"\n\nShe accepted my assent; but, oddly enough, with a sudden qualification\nthat showed her as still sharply disposed to make use of any loose scrap\nof her embarrassed acuteness. \"Of course, at the same time, you yourself\nsaw that your not admitting the possibility would have taken the edge\nfrom your cruelty. It's not the innocent,\" she suggestively remarked,\n\"that we fear to frighten.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I returned, \"I fear, mostly, I think, to frighten _any_ one. I'm\nnot particularly brave. I haven't, at all events, in spite of my\ncertitude, interrogated Mrs. Server, and I give you my word of honour\nthat I've not had any denial from her to prop up my doubt. It still\nstands on its own feet, and it was its own battle that, when I came here\nat your summons, it was prepared to fight. Let me accordingly remind\nyou,\" I pursued, \"in connection with that, of the one sense in which you\nwere, as you a moment ago said, talked over by me. I persuaded you\napparently that Long's metamorphosis was not the work of Lady John. I\npersuaded you of nothing else.\"\n\nShe looked down a little, as if again at a trap. \"You persuaded me that\nit was the work of somebody.\" Then she held up her head. \"It came to the\nsame thing.\"\n\nIf I had credit then for my trap it at least might serve. \"The same\nthing as what?\"\n\n\"Why, as claiming that it _was_ she.\"\n\n\"Poor May--'claiming'? When I insisted it wasn't!\"\n\nMrs. Brissenden flushed. \"You didn't insist it wasn't anybody!\"\n\n\"Why should I when I didn't believe so? I've left you in no doubt,\" I\nindulgently smiled, \"of my beliefs. It was somebody--and it still is.\"\n\nShe looked about at the top of the room. \"The mistake's now yours.\"\n\nI watched her an instant. \"Can you tell me then what one does to recover\nfrom such mistakes?\"\n\n\"One thinks a little.\"\n\n\"Ah, the more I've thought the deeper I've sunk! And that seemed to me\nthe case with you this morning,\" I added, \"the more _you_ thought.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" she frankly declared, \"I must have stopped thinking!\"\n\nIt was a phenomenon, I sufficiently showed, that thought only could\nmeet. \"Could you tell me then at what point?\"\n\nShe had to think even to do that. \"At what point?\"\n\n\"What in particular determined, I mean, your arrest? You surely\ndidn't--launched as you were--stop short all of yourself.\"\n\nShe fronted me, after all, still so bravely that I believed her for an\ninstant not to be, on this article, without an answer she could produce.\nThe unexpected therefore broke for me when she fairly produced none. \"I\nconfess I don't make out,\" she simply said, \"while you seem so little\npleased that I agree with you.\"\n\nI threw back, in despair, both head and hands. \"But, you poor, dear\nthing, you don't in the _least_ agree with me! You flatly contradict me.\nYou deny my miracle.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in miracles,\" she panted.\n\n\"So I exactly, at this late hour, learn. But I don't insist on the\nname. Nothing _is_, I admit, a miracle from the moment one's on the\ntrack of the cause, which was the scent we were following. Call the\nthing simply my fact.\"\n\nShe gave her high head a toss. \"If it's yours it's nobody else's!\"\n\n\"Ah, there's just the question--if we could know all! But my point is\nprecisely, for the present, that you do deny it.\"\n\n\"Of course I deny it,\" said Mrs. Briss.\n\nI took a moment, but my silence held her. \"Your 'of course' would be\nwhat I would again contest, what I would denounce and brand as the word\ntoo much--the word that spoils, were it not that it seems best, that it\nin any case seems necessary, to let all question of your consistency\ngo.\"\n\nOn that I had paused, and, as I felt myself still holding her, I was not\nsurprised when my pause had an effect. \"You do let it go?\"\n\nShe had tried, I could see, to put the inquiry as all ironic. But it was\nnot all ironic; it was, in fact, little enough so to suggest for me some\nintensification--not quite, I trust, wanton--of her suspense. I should\nbe at a loss to say indeed how much it suggested or half of what it\ntold. These things again almost violently moved me, and if I, after an\ninstant, in my silence, turned away, it was not only to keep her\nwaiting, but to make my elation more private. I turned away to that tune\nthat I literally, for a few minutes, quitted her, availing myself thus,\nsuperficially, of the air of weighing a consequence. I wandered off\ntwenty steps and, while I passed my hand over my troubled head, looked\nvaguely at objects on tables and sniffed absently at flowers in bowls. I\ndon't know how long I so lost myself, nor quite why--as I must for some\ntime have kept it up--my companion didn't now really embrace her\npossible alternative of rupture and retreat. Or rather, as to her action\nin this last matter, I am, and was on the spot, clear: I knew at that\nmoment how much _she_ knew she must not leave me without having got from\nme. It came back in waves, in wider glimpses, and produced in so doing\nthe excitement I had to control. It could _not_ but be exciting to talk,\nas we talked, on the basis of those suppressed processes and unavowed\nreferences which made the meaning of our meeting so different from its\nform. We knew ourselves--what moved me, that is, was that she knew\nme--to mean, at every point, immensely more than I said or than she\nanswered; just as she saw me, at the same points, measure the space by\nwhich her answers fell short. This made my conversation with her a\ntotally other and a far more interesting thing than any colloquy I had\never enjoyed; it had even a sharpness that had not belonged, a few hours\nbefore, to my extraordinary interview with Mrs. Server. She couldn't\nafford to quarrel with me for catechising her; she couldn't afford not\nto have kept, in her way, faith with me; she couldn't afford, after\ninconceivable passages with Long, not to treat me as an observer to be\nsquared. She had come down to square me; she was hanging on to square\nme; she was suffering and stammering and lying; she was both carrying it\ngrandly off and letting it desperately go: all, all to square me. And I\ncaught moreover perfectly her vision of her way, and I followed her way\neven while I judged it, feeling that the only personal privilege I\ncould, after all, save from the whole business was that of\nunderstanding. I couldn't save Mrs. Server, and I couldn't save poor\nBriss; I _could_, however, guard, to the last grain of gold, my precious\nsense of their loss, their disintegration and their doom; and it was for\nthis I was now bargaining.\n\nIt was of giving herself away just enough not to spoil for me my bargain\nover my treasure that Mrs. Briss's bribe would consist. She would let me\nsee as far as I would if she could feel sure I would _do_ nothing; and\nit was exactly in this question of how much I might have scared my\ncouple into the sense I _could_ \"do\" that the savour of my suspense most\ndwelt. I could have made them uneasy, of course, only by making them\nfear my intervention; and yet the idea of their being uneasy was less\nwonderful than the idea of my having, with all my precautions,\ncommunicated to them a consciousness. This was so the last thing I had\nwanted to do that I felt, during my swift excursion, how much time I\nshould need in the future for recovery of the process--all of the finest\nwind-blown intimations, woven of silence and secrecy and air--by which\ntheir suspicion would have throbbed into life. I could only,\nprovisionally and sketchily, figure it out, this suspicion, as having,\nlittle by little--not with a sudden start--felt itself in the presence\nof my own, just as my own now returned the compliment. What came back to\nme, as I have said, in waves and wider glimpses, was the marvel of their\nexchange of signals, the phenomenon, scarce to be represented, of their\nbreaking ground with each other. They both had their treasure to guard,\nand they had looked to each other with the instinct of help. They had\nfelt, on either side, the victim possibly slip, and they had connected\nthe possibility with an interest discernibly inspired in me by this\npersonage, and with a relation discoverably established by that\ninterest. It wouldn't have been a danger, perhaps, if the two victims\nhadn't slipped together; and more amazing, doubtless, than anything else\nwas the recognition by my sacrificing couple of the opportunity drawn by\nmy sacrificed from being conjoined in my charity. How could they know,\nGilbert Long and Mrs. Briss, that actively to communicate a\nconsciousness to my other friends had no part in my plan? The most I had\ndreamed of, I could honourably feel, was to assure myself of their\nindependent possession of one. These things were with me while, as I\nhave noted, I made Grace Brissenden wait, and it was also with me that,\nthough I condoned her deviation, she must take it from me as a charity.\nI had presently achieved another of my full revolutions, and I faced her\nagain with a view of her overture and my answer to her last question.\nThe terms were not altogether what my pity could have wished, but I\nsufficiently kept everything together to have to see that there were\nlimits to my choice. \"Yes, I let it go, your change of front, though it\nvexes me a little--and I'll in a moment tell you why--to have to. But\nlet us put it that it's on a condition.\"\n\n\"Change of front?\" she murmured while she looked at me. \"Your\nexpressions are not of the happiest.\"\n\nBut I saw it was only again to cover a doubt. My condition, for her, was\nquestionable, and I felt it would be still more so on her hearing what\nit was. Meanwhile, however, in spite of her qualification of it, I had\nfallen back, once and for all, on pure benignity. \"It scarce matters if\nI'm clumsy when you're practically so bland. I wonder if you'll\nunderstand,\" I continued, \"if I make you an explanation.\"\n\n\"Most probably,\" she answered, as handsome as ever, \"not.\"\n\n\"Let me at all events try you. It's moreover the one I just promised;\nwhich was no more indeed than the development of a feeling I've already\npermitted myself to show you. I lose\"--I brought it out--\"by your\nagreeing with me!\"\n\n\"'Lose'?\"\n\n\"Yes; because while we disagreed you were, in spite of that, on the\nright side.\"\n\n\"And what do you call the right side?\"\n\n\"Well\"--I brought it out again--\"on the same side as my imagination.\"\n\nBut it gave her at least a chance. \"Oh, your imagination!\"\n\n\"Yes--I know what you think of it; you've sufficiently hinted how little\nthat is. But it's precisely because you regard it as rubbish that I now\nappeal to you.\"\n\nShe continued to guard herself by her surprises. \"Appeal? I thought you\nwere on the ground, rather,\" she beautifully smiled, \"of dictation.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm that too. I dictate my terms. But my terms are in themselves\nthe appeal.\" I was ingenious but patient. \"See?\"\n\n\"How in the world can I see?\"\n\n\"_Voyons_, then. Light or darkness, my imagination rides me. But of\ncourse if it's all wrong I want to get rid of it. You can't, naturally,\nhelp me to destroy the faculty itself, but you can aid in the defeat of\nits application to a particular case. It was because you so smiled,\nbefore, on that application, that I valued even my minor difference with\nyou; and what I refer to as my loss is the fact that your frown leaves\nme struggling alone. The best thing for me, accordingly, as I feel, is\nto get rid altogether of the obsession. The way to do that, clearly,\nsince _you've_ done it, is just to quench the fire. By the fire I mean\nthe flame of the fancy that blazed so for us this morning. What the\ndeuce have you, for yourself, poured on it? Tell me,\" I pleaded, \"and\nteach me.\"\n\nEqually with her voice her face echoed me again. \"Teach you?\"\n\n\"To abandon my false gods. Lead me back to peace by the steps _you've_\ntrod. By so much as they must have remained traceable to you, shall I\nfind them of interest and profit. They must in fact be most remarkable:\nwon't they even--for what _I_ may find in them--be more remarkable than\nthose we should now be taking together if we hadn't separated, if we\nhadn't pulled up?\" That was a proposition I could present to her with\ncandour, but before her absence of precipitation had permitted her much\nto consider it I had already followed it on. \"You'll just tell me,\nhowever, that since I do pull up and turn back with you we shall just\nhave _not_ separated. Well, then, so much the better--I see you're\nright. But I want,\" I earnestly declared, \"not to lose an inch of the\njourney.\"\n\nShe watched me now as a Roman lady at the circus may have watched an\nexemplary Christian. \"The journey has been a very simple one,\" she said\nat last. \"With my mind made up on a single point, it was taken at a\nstride.\"\n\nI was all interest. \"On a single point?\" Then, as, almost excessively\ndeliberate, she still kept me: \"You mean the still commonplace character\nof Long's--a--consciousness?\"\n\nShe had taken at last again the time she required. \"Do you know what I\nthink?\"\n\n\"It's exactly what I'm pressing you to make intelligible.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Briss, \"I think you're crazy.\"\n\nIt naturally struck me. \"Crazy?\"\n\n\"Crazy.\"\n\nI turned it over. \"But do you call that intelligible?\"\n\nShe did it justice. \"No: I don't suppose it _can_ be so for you if you\n_are_ insane.\"\n\nI risked the long laugh which might have seemed that of madness. \"'If I\nam' is lovely!\" And whether or not it was the special sound, in my ear,\nof my hilarity, I remember just wondering if perhaps I mightn't be.\n\"Dear woman, it's the point at issue!\"\n\nBut it was as if she too had been affected. \"It's not at issue for me\nnow.\"\n\nI gave her then the benefit of my stirred speculation. \"It always\nhappens, of course, that one is one's self the last to know. You're\nperfectly convinced?\"\n\nShe not ungracefully, for an instant, faltered; but since I really would\nhave it----! \"Oh, so far as what we've talked of is concerned,\nperfectly!\"\n\n\"And it's actually what you've come down then to tell me?\"\n\n\"Just exactly what. And if it's a surprise to you,\" she added, \"that I\n_should_ have come down--why, I can only say I was prepared for\nanything.\"\n\n\"Anything?\" I smiled.\n\n\"In the way of a surprise.\"\n\nI thought; but her preparation was natural, though in a moment I could\nmatch it. \"Do you know that's what I was too?\"\n\n\"Prepared----?\"\n\n\"For anything in the way of a surprise. But only _from_ you,\" I\nexplained. \"And of course--yes,\" I mused, \"I've got it. If I _am_\ncrazy,\" I went on--\"it's indeed simple.\"\n\nShe appeared, however, to feel, from the influence of my present tone,\nthe impulse, in courtesy, to attenuate. \"Oh, I don't pretend it's\nsimple!\"\n\n\"No? I thought that was just what you did pretend.\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose,\" said Mrs. Briss, \"that you'd like it. I didn't\nsuppose that you'd accept it or even listen to it. But I owed it to\nyou----\" She hesitated.\n\n\"You owed it to me to let me know what you thought of me even should it\nprove very disagreeable?\"\n\nThat perhaps was more than she could adopt. \"I owed it to myself,\" she\nreplied with a touch of austerity.\n\n\"To let me know I'm demented?\"\n\n\"To let you know I'm _not_.\" We each looked, I think, when she had said\nit, as if she had done what she said. \"That's all.\"\n\n\"All?\" I wailed. \"Ah, don't speak as if it were so little. It's much.\nIt's everything.\"\n\n\"It's anything you will!\" said Mrs. Briss impatiently. \"Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night?\" I was aghast. \"You leave me on it?\"\n\nShe appeared to profess for an instant all the freshness of her own that\nshe was pledged to guard. \"I must leave you on something. I couldn't\ncome to spend a whole hour.\"\n\n\"But do you think it's so quickly done--to persuade a man he's crazy?\"\n\n\"I haven't expected to persuade you.\"\n\n\"Only to throw out the hint?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she admitted, \"it would be good if it could work in you. But\nI've told you,\" she added as if to wind up and have done, \"what\ndetermined me.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon\"--oh, I protested! \"That's just what you've not told\nme. The reason of your change----\"\n\n\"I'm not speaking,\" she broke in, \"of my change.\"\n\n\"Ah, but _I_ am!\" I declared with a sharpness that threw her back for a\nminute on her reserves. \"It's your change,\" I again insisted, \"that's\nthe interesting thing. If I'm crazy, I must once more remind you, you\nwere simply crazy _with_ me; and how can I therefore be indifferent to\nyour recovery of your wit or let you go without having won from you the\nsecret of your remedy?\" I shook my head with kindness, but with\ndecision. \"You mustn't leave me till you've placed it in my hand.\"\n\nThe reserves I had spoken of were not, however, to fail her. \"I thought\nyou just said that you let my inconsistency go.\"\n\n\"Your moral responsibility for it--perfectly. But how can I show a\ngreater indulgence than by positively desiring to enter into its\nhistory? It's in that sense that, as I say,\" I developed, \"I do speak of\nyour change. There must have been a given moment when the need of it--or\nwhen, in other words, the truth of my personal state--dawned upon you.\nThat moment is the key to your whole position--the moment for us to\nfix.\"\n\n\"Fix it,\" said poor Mrs. Briss, \"when you like!\"\n\n\"I had much rather,\" I protested, \"fix it when _you_ like. I want--you\nsurely must understand if I want anything of it at all--to get it\nabsolutely right.\" Then as this plea seemed still not to move her, I\nonce more compressed my palms. \"You _won't_ help me?\"\n\nShe bridled at last with a higher toss. \"It wasn't with such views I\ncame. I don't believe,\" she went on a shade more patiently, \"I don't\nbelieve--if you want to know the reason--that you're really sincere.\"\n\nHere indeed was an affair. \"Not sincere--_I_?\"\n\n\"Not properly honest. I mean in giving up.\"\n\n\"Giving up what?\"\n\n\"Why, everything.\"\n\n\"Everything? Is it a question\"--I stared--\"of _that_?\"\n\n\"You would if you _were_ honest.\"\n\n\"Everything?\" I repeated.\n\nAgain she stood to it. \"Everything.\"\n\n\"But is that quite the readiness I've professed?\"\n\n\"If it isn't then, what is?\"\n\nI thought a little. \"Why, isn't it simply a matter rather of the\nrenunciation of a confidence?\"\n\n\"In your sense and your truth?\" This, she indicated, was all she asked.\n\"Well, what is that but everything?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I reflected, \"perhaps.\" In fact, it no doubt was. \"We'll take\nit then for everything, and it's as so taking it that I renounce. I\nkeep nothing at all. Now do you believe I'm honest?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"Well--yes, if you say so.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I sighed, \"I see you don't! What can I do,\" I asked, \"to prove\nit?\"\n\n\"You can easily prove it. You can let me go.\"\n\n\"Does it strike you,\" I considered, \"that I should take your going as a\nsign of your belief?\"\n\n\"Of what else, then?\"\n\n\"Why, surely,\" I promptly replied, \"my assent to your leaving our\ndiscussion where it stands would constitute a very different symptom.\nWouldn't it much rather represent,\" I inquired, \"a failure of belief on\nmy own part in _your_ honesty? If you can judge me, in short, as only\npretending----\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't you,\" she put in for me, \"also judge _me_? What have I to\ngain by pretending?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" I returned, laughing, \"if you'll tell me what _I_\nhave.\"\n\nShe appeared to ask herself if she could, and then to decide in the\nnegative. \"If I don't understand you in any way, of course I don't in\nthat. Put it, at any rate,\" she now rather wearily quavered, \"that one\nof us has as little to gain as the other. I believe you,\" she repeated.\n\"There!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I smiled, \"for the way you say it. If you don't, as you say,\nunderstand me,\" I insisted, \"it's because you think me crazy. And if you\nthink me crazy I don't see how you _can_ leave me.\"\n\nShe presently met this. \"If I believe you're sincere in saying you give\nup I believe you've recovered. And if I believe you've recovered I don't\nthink you crazy. It's simple enough.\"\n\n\"Then why isn't it simple to understand me?\"\n\nShe turned about, and there were moments in her embarrassment, now, from\nwhich she fairly drew beauty. Her awkwardness was somehow noble; her\nsense of her predicament was in itself young. \"Is it _ever_?\" she\ncharmingly threw out.\n\nI felt she must see at this juncture how wonderful I found her, and even\nthat that impression--one's whole consciousness of her personal\nvictory--was a force that, in the last resort, was all on her side. \"It\nwas quite worth your while, this sitting up to this hour, to show a\nfellow how you bloom when other women are fagged. If that was really,\nwith the truth that we're so pulling about laid bare, what you did most\nwant to show, why, then, you've splendidly triumphed, and I congratulate\nand thank you. No,\" I quickly went on, \"I daresay, to do you justice,\nthe interpretation of my tropes and figures _isn't_ 'ever' perfectly\nsimple. You doubtless _have_ driven me into a corner with my dangerous\nexplosive, and my only fair course must be therefore to sit on it till\nyou get out of the room. I'm sitting on it now; and I think you'll find\nyou can get out as soon as you've told me _this_. Was the moment your\nchange of view dawned upon you the moment of our exchanging a while\nago, in the drawing-room, our few words?\"\n\nThe light that, under my last assurances, had so considerably revived\nfaded in her a little as she saw me again tackle the theme of her\ninconstancy; but the prospect of getting rid of me on these terms made\nmy inquiry, none the less, worth trying to face. \"That moment?\" She\nshowed the effort to think back.\n\nI gave her every assistance. \"It was when, after the music, I had been\ntalking to Lady John. You were on a sofa, not far from us, with Gilbert\nLong; and when, on Lady John's dropping me, I made a slight movement\ntoward you, you most graciously met it by rising and giving me a chance\nwhile Mr. Long walked away.\"\n\nIt was as if I had hung the picture before her, so that she had fairly\nto look at it. But the point that she first, in her effort, took up was\nnot, superficially, the most salient. \"Mr. Long walked away?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean to say that that had anything to do with it.\"\n\nShe continued to think. \"To do with what?\"\n\n\"With the way the situation comes back to me now as possibly marking\nyour crisis.\"\n\nShe wondered. \"Was it a 'situation'?\"\n\n\"That's just what I'm asking you. _Was_ it? Was it _the_ situation?\"\n\nBut she had quite fallen away again. \"I remember the moment you mean--it\nwas when I said I would come to you here. But why should it have struck\nyou as a crisis?\"\n\n\"It didn't in the least at the time, for I didn't then know you were no\nlonger 'with' me. But in the light of what I've since learned from you I\nseem to recover an impression which, on the spot, was only vague. The\nimpression,\" I explained, \"of your taking a decision that presented some\ndifficulty, but that was determined by something that had then--and even\nperhaps a little suddenly--come up for you. That's the point\"--I\ncontinued to unfold my case--\"on which my question bears. _Was_ this\n'something' your conclusion, then and there, that there's nothing in\nanything?\"\n\nShe kept her distance. \"'In anything'?\"\n\n\"And that I could only be, accordingly, out of my mind? Come,\" I\npatiently pursued; \"such a perception as that had, at some instant or\nother, to _begin_; and I'm only trying to aid you to recollect when the\ndevil it did!\"\n\n\"Does it particularly matter?\" Mrs. Briss inquired.\n\nI felt my chin. \"That depends a little--doesn't it?--on what you mean by\n'matter'! It matters for your meeting my curiosity, and that matters, in\nits turn, as we just arranged, for my releasing you. You may ask of\ncourse if my curiosity itself matters; but to that, fortunately, my\nreply can only be of the clearest. The satisfaction of my curiosity is\nthe pacification of my mind. We've granted, we've accepted, I again\npress upon you, in respect to that precarious quantity, its topsy-turvy\nstate. Only give me a lead; I don't ask you for more. Let me for an\ninstant see play before me any feeble reflection whatever of the flash\nof new truth that unsettled you.\"\n\nI thought for a moment that, in her despair, she would find something\nthat would do. But she only found: \"It didn't come in a flash.\"\n\nI remained all patience. \"It came little by little? It began then\nperhaps earlier in the day than the moment to which I allude? And yet,\"\nI continued, \"we were pretty well on in the day, I must keep in mind,\nwhen I had your last news of your credulity.\"\n\n\"My credulity?\"\n\n\"Call it then, if you don't like the word, your sympathy.\"\n\nI had given her time, however, to produce at last something that, it\nvisibly occurred to her, might pass. \"As soon as I was not with you--I\nmean with you personally--you _never_ had my sympathy.\"\n\n\"Is my person then so irresistible?\"\n\nWell, she was brave. \"It _was_. But it's not, thank God, now!\"\n\n\"Then there we are again at our mystery! I don't think, you know,\" I\nmade out for her, \"it was my person, really, that gave its charm to my\ntheory; I think it was much more my theory that gave its charm to my\nperson. My person, I flatter myself, has remained through these few\nhours--hours of tension, but of a tension, you see, purely\nintellectual--as good as ever; so that if we're not, even in our\nanomalous situation, in danger from any such source, it's simply that my\ntheory is dead and that the blight of the rest is involved.\"\n\nMy words were indeed many, but she plumped straight through them. \"As\nsoon as I was away from you I hated you.\"\n\n\"Hated _me_?\"\n\n\"Well, hated what you call 'the rest'--hated your theory.\"\n\n\"I see. Yet,\" I reflected, \"you're not at present--though you wish to\ngoodness, no doubt, you _were_--away from me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't care now,\" she said with courage; \"since--for you see I\nbelieve you--we're away from your delusions.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't, in spite of your belief,\"--I smiled at her--\"like to be a\nlittle further off yet?\" But before she could answer, and because also,\ndoubtless, the question had too much the sound of a taunt, I came up, as\nif for her real convenience, quite in another place. \"Perhaps my\nidea--my timing, that is, of your crisis--is the result, in my mind, of\nmy own association with that particular instant. It comes back to me\nthat what I was most full of while your face signed to me and your voice\nthen so graciously confirmed it, and while too, as I've said, Long\nwalked away--what I was most full of, as a consequence of another go,\njust ended, at Lady John, was, once more, this same Lady John's want of\nadjustability to the character you and I, in our associated speculation\nof the morning, had so candidly tried to fit her with. I was still even\nthen, you see, speculating--all on my own hook, alas!--and it had just\nrolled over me with renewed force that she was nothing whatever, not the\nleast little bit, to our purpose. The moment, in other words, if you\nunderstand, happened to be one of _my_ moments; so that, by the same\ntoken, I simply wondered if it mightn't likewise have happened to be one\nof yours.\"\n\n\"It _was_ one of mine,\" Mrs. Briss replied as promptly as I could\nreasonably have expected; \"in the sense that--as you've only to\nconsider--it was to lead more or less directly to these present words of\nours.\"\n\nIf I had only to consider, nothing was more easy; but each time I\nconsidered, I was ready to show, the less there seemed left by the act.\n\"Ah, but you had then _already_ backed out. _Won't_ you understand--for\nyou're a little discouraging--that I want to catch you at the earlier\nstage?\"\n\n\"To 'catch' me?\" I had indeed expressions!\n\n\"Absolutely catch! Focus you under the first shock of the observation\nthat was to make everything fall to pieces for you.\"\n\n\"But I've told you,\" she stoutly resisted, \"that there was no 'first'\nshock.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the second or the third.\"\n\n\"There was no shock,\" Mrs. Briss magnificently said, \"at all.\"\n\nIt made me somehow break into laughter. \"You found it so natural\nthen--and you so rather liked it--to make up your mind of a sudden that\nyou had been steeped in the last intellectual intimacy with a maniac?\"\n\nShe thought once more, and then, as I myself had just previously done,\ncame up in another place. \"I had at the moment you speak of wholly given\nup any idea of Lady John.\"\n\nBut it was so feeble it made me smile. \"Of course you had, you poor\ninnocent! You couldn't otherwise, hours before, have strapped the saddle\nso tight on another woman.\"\n\n\"I had given up everything,\" she stubbornly continued.\n\n\"It's exactly what, in reference to that juncture, I perfectly embrace.\"\n\n\"Well, even in reference to that juncture,\" she resumed, \"you may catch\nme as much as you like.\" With which, suddenly, during some seconds, I\nsaw her hold herself for a leap. \"You talk of 'focussing,' but what\nelse, even in those minutes, were you in fact engaged in?\"\n\n\"Ah, then, you do recognise them,\" I cried--\"those minutes?\"\n\nShe took her jump, though with something of a flop. \"Yes--as, consenting\nthus to be catechised, I cudgel my brain for your amusement--I do\nrecognise them. I remember what I thought. You focussed--I felt you\nfocus. I saw you wonder whereabouts, in what you call our associated\nspeculation, I would by that time be. I asked myself whether you'd\nunderstand if I should try to convey to you simply by my expression such\na look as would tell you all. By 'all' I meant the fact that, sorry as I\nwas for you--or perhaps for myself--it had struck me as only fair to let\nyou know as straight as possible that I was nowhere. That was why I\nstared so, and I of course couldn't explain to you,\" she lucidly\npursued, \"to whom my stare had reference.\"\n\nI hung on her lips. \"But you can _now_?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. To Mr. Long.\"\n\nI remained suspended. \"Ah, but this is lovely! It's what I want.\"\n\nI saw I should have more of it, and more in fact came. \"You were saying\njust now what you were full of, and I can do the same. I was full of\n_him_.\"\n\nI, on my side, was now full of eagerness. \"Yes? He had left you full as\nhe walked away?\"\n\nShe winced a little at this renewed evocation of his retreat, but she\ntook it as she had not done before, and I felt that with another push\nshe would be fairly afloat. \"He had reason to walk!\"\n\nI wondered. \"What had you said to him?\"\n\nShe pieced it out. \"Nothing--or very little. But I had listened.\"\n\n\"And to _what_?\"\n\n\"To what he says. To his platitudes.\"\n\n\"His platitudes?\" I stared. \"Long's?\"\n\n\"Why, don't you know he's a prize fool?\"\n\nI mused, sceptical but reasonable. \"He _was_.\"\n\n\"He _is_!\"\n\nMrs. Briss was superb, but, as I quickly felt I might remind her, there\nwas her possibly weak judgment. \"Your confidence is splendid; only\nmustn't I remember that your sense of the finer kinds of cleverness\nisn't perhaps absolutely secure? Don't you know?--you also, till just\nnow, thought _me_ a prize fool.\"\n\nIf I had hoped, however, here to trip her up, I had reckoned without the\nimpulse, and even perhaps the example, that she properly owed to me.\n\"Oh, no--not anything of that sort, you, at all. Only an intelligent man\ngone wrong.\"\n\nI followed, but before I caught up, \"Whereas Long's only a stupid man\ngone right?\" I threw out.\n\nIt checked her too briefly, and there was indeed something of my own it\nbrought straight back. \"I thought that just what you told me, this\nmorning or yesterday, was that you had never known a case of the\nconversion of an idiot.\"\n\nI laughed at her readiness. Well, I had wanted to make her fight! \"It's\ntrue it would have been the only one.\"\n\n\"Ah, you'll have to do without it!\" Oh, she was brisk now. \"And if you\nknow what I think of him, you know no more than _he_ does.\"\n\n\"You mean you told him?\"\n\nShe hung fire but an instant. \"I told him, practically--and it was in\nfact all I did have to say to him. It was enough, however, and he\ndisgustedly left me on it. Then it was that, as you gave me the chance,\nI tried to telegraph you--to say to you on the spot and under the sharp\nimpression: 'What on earth do you mean by your nonsense? It doesn't hold\nwater!' It's a pity I didn't succeed!\" she continued--for she had become\nalmost voluble. \"It would have settled the question, and I should have\ngone to bed.\"\n\nI weighed it with the grimace that, I feared, had become almost as fixed\nas Mrs. Server's. \"It would have settled the question perhaps; but I\nshould have lost this impression of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, this impression of me!\"\n\n\"Ah, but don't undervalue it: it's what I want! What was it then Long\nhad said?\"\n\nShe had it more and more, but she had it as nothing at all. \"Not a word\nto repeat--you wouldn't believe! He does say nothing at all. One can't\nremember. It's what I mean. I tried him on purpose, while I thought of\nyou. But he's perfectly stupid. I don't see how we can have\nfancied----!\" I had interrupted her by the movement with which again,\nuncontrollably tossed on one of my surges of certitude, I turned away.\n_How_ deep they must have been in together for her to have so at last\ngathered herself up, and in how doubly interesting a light, above all,\nit seemed to present Long for the future! That was, while I warned\nmyself, what I most read in--literally an implication of the enhancement\nof this latter side of the prodigy. If his cleverness, under the alarm\nthat, first stirring their consciousness but dimly, had so swiftly\ndeveloped as to make next of each a mirror for the other, and then to\nprecipitate for them, in some silence deeper than darkness, the exchange\nof recognitions, admissions and, as they certainly would have phrased\nit, tips--if his excited acuteness was henceforth to protect itself by\ndissimulation, what wouldn't perhaps, for one's diversion, be the new\nspectacle and wonder? I could in a manner already measure this larger\nplay by the amplitude freshly determined in Mrs. Briss, and I was for a\nmoment actually held by the thought of the possible finish our friend\nwould find it in him to give to a represented, a fictive ineptitude.\nThe sharpest jostle to my thought, in this rush, might well have been,\nI confess, the reflection that as it was I who had arrested, who had\nspoiled their unconsciousness, so it was natural they should fight\nagainst me for a possible life in the state I had given them instead. I\nhad spoiled their unconsciousness, I had destroyed it, and it was\nconsciousness alone that could make them effectively cruel. Therefore,\nif they were cruel, it was I who had determined it, inasmuch as,\nconsciously, they could only want, they could only intend, to live.\nWouldn't that question have been, I managed even now to ask myself, the\nvery basis on which they had inscrutably come together? \"It's life, you\nknow,\" each had said to the other, \"and I, accordingly, can only cling\nto mine. But you, poor dear--shall _you_ give up?\" \"Give up?\" the other\nhad replied; \"for what do you take me? I shall fight by your side,\nplease, and we can compare and exchange weapons and manoeuvres, and\nyou may in every way count upon me.\"\n\nThat was what, with greater vividness, was for the rest of the occasion\nbefore me, or behind me; and that I had done it all and had only myself\nto thank for it was what, from this minute, by the same token, was more\nand more for me the inner essence of Mrs. Briss's attitude. I know not\nwhat heavy admonition of my responsibility had thus suddenly descended\non me; but nothing, under it, was indeed more sensible than that\npractically it paralysed me. And I could only say to myself that this\nwas the price--the price of the secret success, the lonely liberty and\nthe intellectual joy. There were things that for so private and splendid\na revel--that of the exclusive king with his Wagner opera--I could only\nlet go, and the special torment of my case was that the condition of\nlight, of the satisfaction of curiosity and of the attestation of\ntriumph, was in this direct way the sacrifice of feeling. There was no\npoint at which my assurance could, by the scientific method, judge\nitself complete enough not to regard feeling as an interference and, in\nconsequence, as a possible check. If it had to go I knew well who went\nwith it, but I wasn't there to save _them_. I was there to save my\npriceless pearl of an inquiry and to harden, to that end, my heart. I\nshould need indeed all my hardness, as well as my brightness, moreover,\nto meet Mrs. Briss on the high level to which I had at last induced her\nto mount, and, even while I prolonged the movement by which I had\nmomentarily stayed her, the intermission of her speech became itself for\nme a hint of the peculiar pertinence of caution. It lasted long enough,\nthis drop, to suggest that her attention was the sharper for my having\nturned away from it, and I should have feared a renewed challenge if she\nhadn't, by good luck, presently gone on: \"There's really nothing in him\nat all!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nI had faced her again just in time to take it, and I immediately made up\nmy mind how best to do so. \"Then I go utterly to pieces!\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have perched yourself,\" she laughed--she could by this\ntime almost coarsely laugh--\"in such a preposterous place!\"\n\n\"Ah, that's my affair,\" I returned, \"and if I accept the consequences I\ndon't quite see what you've to say to it. That I do accept them--so far\nas I make them out as not too intolerable and you as not intending them\nto be--that I do accept them is what I've been trying to signify to you.\nOnly my fall,\" I added, \"is an inevitable shock. You remarked to me a\nfew minutes since that you didn't recover yourself in a flash. I differ\nfrom you, you see, in that _I_ do; I take my collapse all at once. Here\nthen I am. I'm smashed. I don't see, as I look about me, a piece I can\npick up. I don't attempt to account for my going wrong; I don't attempt\nto account for yours with me; I don't attempt to account for anything.\nIf Long _is_ just what he always was it settles the matter, and the\nspecial clincher for us can be but your honest final impression, made\nprecisely more aware of itself by repentance for the levity with which\nyou had originally yielded to my contagion.\"\n\nShe didn't insist on her repentance; she was too taken up with the facts\nthemselves. \"Oh, but add to my impression everyone else's impression!\nHas anyone noticed anything?\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't know what anyone has noticed. I haven't,\" I brooded,\n\"ventured--as you know--to ask anyone.\"\n\n\"Well, if you had you'd have seen--seen, I mean, all they don't see. If\nthey had been conscious they'd have talked.\"\n\nI thought. \"To me?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure to you; people have such a notion of what you\nembroider on things that they're rather afraid to commit themselves or\nto lead you on: they're sometimes in, you know,\" she luminously reminded\nme, \"for more than they bargain for, than they quite know what to do\nwith, or than they care to have on their hands.\"\n\nI tried to do justice to this account of myself. \"You mean I see so\nmuch?\"\n\nIt was a delicate matter, but she risked it. \"Don't you sometimes see\nhorrors?\"\n\nI wondered. \"Well, names are a convenience. People catch me in the act?\"\n\n\"They certainly think you critical.\"\n\n\"And is criticism the vision of horrors?\"\n\nShe couldn't quite be sure where I was taking her. \"It isn't, perhaps,\nso much that you see them----\"\n\nI started. \"As that I perpetrate them?\"\n\nShe was sure now, however, and wouldn't have it, for she was serious.\n\"Dear no--you don't perpetrate anything. Perhaps it would be better if\nyou did!\" she tossed off with an odd laugh. \"But--always by people's\nidea--you like them.\"\n\nI followed. \"Horrors?\"\n\n\"Well, you don't----\"\n\n\"Yes----?\"\n\nBut she wouldn't be hurried now. \"You take them too much for what they\nare. You don't seem to want----\"\n\n\"To come down on them strong? Oh, but I often do!\"\n\n\"So much the better then.\"\n\n\"Though I do like--whether for that or not,\" I hastened to confess, \"to\nlook them first well in the face.\"\n\nOur eyes met, with this, for a minute, but she made nothing of that.\n\"When they _have_ no face, then, you can't do it! It isn't at all events\nnow a question,\" she went on, \"of people's keeping anything back, and\nyou're perhaps in any case not the person to whom it would first have\ncome.\"\n\nI tried to think then who the person would be. \"It would have come to\nLong himself?\"\n\nBut she was impatient of this. \"Oh, one doesn't know what comes--or what\ndoesn't--to Long himself! I'm not sure he's too modest to\nmisrepresent--if he had the intelligence to play a part.\"\n\n\"Which he hasn't!\" I concluded.\n\n\"Which he hasn't. It's to _me_ they might have spoken--or to each\nother.\"\n\n\"But I thought you exactly held they _had_ chattered in accounting for\nhis state by the influence of Lady John.\"\n\nShe got the matter instantly straight. \"Not a bit. That chatter was mine\nonly--and produced to meet yours. There had so, by your theory, to be a\nwoman----\"\n\n\"That, to oblige me, you invented _her_? Precisely. But I thought----\"\n\n\"You needn't have thought!\" Mrs. Briss broke in. \"I didn't invent her.\"\n\n\"Then what are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I didn't invent her,\" she repeated, looking at me hard. \"She's true.\" I\nechoed it in vagueness, though instinctively again in protest; yet I\nheld my breath, for this was really the point at which I felt my\ncompanion's forces most to have mustered. Her manner now moreover gave\nme a great idea of them, and her whole air was of taking immediate\nadvantage of my impression. \"Well, see here: since you've wanted it, I'm\nafraid that, however little you may like it, you'll have to take it.\nYou've pressed me for explanations and driven me much harder than you\nmust have seen I found convenient. If I've seemed to beat about the bush\nit's because I hadn't only myself to think of. One can be simple for\none's self--one can't be, always, for others.\"\n\n\"Ah, to whom do you say it?\" I encouragingly sighed; not even yet quite\nseeing for what issue she was heading.\n\nShe continued to make for the spot, whatever it was, with a certain\nmajesty. \"I should have preferred to tell you nothing more than what I\n_have_ told you. I should have preferred to close our conversation on\nthe simple announcement of my recovered sense of proportion. But you\n_have_, I see, got me in too deep.\"\n\n\"O-oh!\" I courteously attenuated.\n\n\"You've made of me,\" she lucidly insisted, \"too big a talker, too big a\nthinker, of nonsense.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I laughed, \"for intimating that I trifle so agreeably.\"\n\n\"Oh, _you've_ appeared not to mind! But let me then at last not fail of\nthe luxury of admitting that _I_ mind. Yes, I mind particularly. I may\nbe bad, but I've a grain of gumption.\"\n\n\"'Bad'?\" It seemed more closely to concern me.\n\n\"Bad I may be. In fact,\" she pursued at this high pitch and pressure,\n\"there's no doubt whatever I _am_.\"\n\n\"I'm delighted to hear it,\" I cried, \"for it was exactly something\nstrong I wanted of you!\"\n\n\"It _is_ then strong\"--and I could see indeed she was ready to satisfy\nme. \"You've worried me for my motive and harassed me for my 'moment,'\nand I've had to protect others and, at the cost of a decent appearance,\nto pretend to be myself half an idiot. I've had even, for the same\npurpose--if you must have it--to depart from the truth; to give you,\nthat is, a false account of the manner of my escape from your tangle.\nBut now the truth shall be told, and others can take care of\nthemselves!\" She had so wound herself up with this, reached so the point\nof fairly heaving with courage and candour, that I for an instant almost\nmiscalculated her direction and believed she was really throwing up her\ncards. It was as if she had decided, on some still finer lines, just to\nrub my nose into what I had been spelling out; which would have been an\nanticipation of my own journey's crown of the most disconcerting sort. I\nwanted my personal confidence, but I wanted nobody's confession, and\nwithout the journey's crown where _was_ the personal confidence? Without\nthe personal confidence, moreover, where was the personal honour? That\nwould be really the single thing to which I could attach authority, for\na confession might, after all, be itself a lie. Anybody, at all events,\ncould fit the shoe to one. My friend's intention, however, remained but\nbriefly equivocal; my danger passed, and I recognised in its place a\nstill richer assurance. It was not the unnamed, in short, who were to be\nnamed. \"Lady John _is_ the woman.\"\n\nYet even this was prodigious. \"But I thought your present position was\njust that she's _not_!\"\n\n\"Lady John _is_ the woman,\" Mrs. Briss again announced.\n\n\"But I thought your present position was just that nobody is!\"\n\n\"Lady John _is_ the woman,\" she a third time declared.\n\nIt naturally left me gaping. \"Then there _is_ one?\" I cried between\nbewilderment and joy.\n\n\"A woman? There's _her_!\" Mrs. Briss replied with more force than\ngrammar. \"I know,\" she briskly, almost breezily added, \"that I said she\nwouldn't do (as I had originally said she would do better than any one),\nwhen you a while ago mentioned her. But that was to save her.\"\n\n\"And you don't care now,\" I smiled, \"if she's lost!\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"She _is_ lost. But she can take care of herself.\"\n\nI could but helplessly think of her. \"I'm afraid indeed that, with what\nyou've done with her, _I_ can't take care of her. But why is she now to\nthe purpose,\" I articulately wondered, \"any more than she was?\"\n\n\"Why? On the very system you yourself laid down. When we took him for\nbrilliant, she couldn't be. But now that we see him as he is----\"\n\n\"We can only see her also as _she_ is?\" Well, I tried, as far as my\namusement would permit, so to see her; but still there were\ndifficulties. \"Possibly!\" I at most conceded. \"Do you owe your\ndiscovery, however, wholly to my system? My system, where so much made\nfor protection,\" I explained, \"wasn't intended to have the effect of\nexposure.\"\n\n\"It appears to have been at all events intended,\" my companion returned,\n\"to have the effect of driving me to the wall; and the consequence of\n_that_ effect is nobody's fault but your own.\"\n\nShe was all logic now, and I could easily see, between my light and my\ndarkness, how she would remain so. Yet I was scarce satisfied. \"And it's\nonly on 'that effect'----?\"\n\n\"That I've made up my mind?\" She was positively free at last to enjoy my\ndiscomfort. \"Wouldn't it be surely, if your ideas were worth anything,\nenough? But it isn't,\" she added, \"only on that. It's on something\nelse.\"\n\nI had after an instant extracted from this the single meaning it could\nappear to yield. \"I'm to understand that you _know_?\"\n\n\"That they're intimate enough for anything?\" She faltered, but she\nbrought it out. \"I know.\"\n\nIt was the oddest thing in the world for a little, the way this\naffected me without my at all believing it. It was preposterous, hang\nthough it would with her somersault, and she had quite succeeded in\ngiving it the note of sincerity. It was the mere sound of it that, as I\nfelt even at the time, made it a little of a blow--a blow of the smart\nof which I was conscious just long enough inwardly to murmur: \"What if\nshe _should_ be right?\" She had for these seconds the advantage of\nstirring within me the memory of her having indeed, the day previous, at\nPaddington, \"known\" as I hadn't. It had been really on what she _then_\nknew that we originally started, and an element of our start had been\nthat I admired her freedom. The form of it, at least--so beautifully had\nshe recovered herself--was all there now. Well, I at any rate reflected,\nit wasn't the form that need trouble me, and I quickly enough put her a\nquestion that related only to the matter. \"Of course if she is--it _is_\nsmash!\"\n\n\"And haven't you yet got used to its being?\"\n\nI kept my eyes on her; I traced the buried figure in the ruins. \"She's\ngood enough for a fool; and so\"--I made it out--\"is he! If he _is_ the\nsame ass--yes--they _might_ be.\"\n\n\"_And_ he is,\" said Mrs. Briss, \"the same ass!\"\n\nI continued to look at her. \"He would have no need then of her having\ntransformed and inspired him.\"\n\n\"Or of her having _de_formed and idiotised herself,\" my friend\nsubjoined.\n\nOh, how it sharpened my look! \"No, no--she wouldn't need that.\"\n\n\"The great point is that _he_ wouldn't!\" Mrs. Briss laughed.\n\nI kept it up. \"She would do perfectly.\"\n\nMrs. Briss was not behind. \"My dear man, she has _got_ to do!\"\n\nThis was brisker still, but I held my way. \"Almost anyone would do.\"\n\nIt seemed for a little, between humour and sadness, to strike her.\n\"Almost anyone _would_. Still,\" she less pensively declared, \"we want\nthe right one.\"\n\n\"Surely; the right one\"--I could only echo it. \"But how,\" I then\nproceeded, \"has it happily been confirmed to you?\"\n\nIt pulled her up a trifle. \"'Confirmed'----?\"\n\n\"That he's her lover.\"\n\nMy eyes had been meeting hers without, as it were, hers quite meeting\nmine. But at this there had to be intercourse. \"By my husband.\"\n\nIt pulled _me_ up a trifle. \"Brissenden knows?\"\n\nShe hesitated; then, as if at my tone, gave a laugh. \"Don't you suppose\nI've told him?\"\n\nI really couldn't but admire her. \"Ah--so you _have_ talked!\"\n\nIt didn't confound her. \"One's husband isn't talk. You're cruel\nmoreover,\" she continued, \"to my joke. It was Briss, poor dear, who\ntalked--though, I mean, only to me. _He_ knows.\"\n\nI cast about. \"Since when?\"\n\nBut she had it ready. \"Since this evening.\"\n\nOnce more I couldn't but smile. \"Just in time then! And the _way_ he\nknows----?\"\n\n\"Oh, the way!\"--she had at this a slight drop. But she came up again. \"I\ntake his word.\"\n\n\"You haven't then asked him?\"\n\n\"The beauty of it was--half an hour ago, upstairs--that I _hadn't_ to\nask. He came out with it himself, and _that_--to give you the whole\nthing--was, if you like, my moment. He dropped it on me,\" she continued\nto explain, \"without in the least, sweet innocent, knowing what he was\ndoing; more, at least, that is, than give her away.\"\n\n\"Which,\" I concurred, \"was comparatively nothing!\"\n\nBut she had no ear for irony, and she made out still more of her story.\n\"He's simple--but he sees.\"\n\n\"And when he sees\"--I completed the picture--\"he luckily tells.\"\n\nShe quite agreed with me that it was lucky, but without prejudice to his\nacuteness and to what had been in him moreover a natural revulsion. \"He\nhas seen, in short; there comes some chance when one does. His, as\nluckily as you please, came this evening. If you ask me what it showed\nhim you ask more than _I've_ either cared or had time to ask. Do you\nconsider, for that matter\"--she put it to me--\"that one does ask?\" As\nher high smoothness--such was the wonder of this reascendancy--almost\ndeprived me of my means, she was wise and gentle with me. \"Let us leave\nit alone.\"\n\nI fairly, while my look at her turned rueful, scratched my head. \"Don't\nyou think it a little late for that?\"\n\n\"Late for everything!\" she impatiently said. \"But there you are.\"\n\nI fixed the floor. There indeed I was. But I tried to stay there--just\nthere only--as short a time as possible. Something, moreover, after all,\ncaught me up. \"But if Brissenden already knew----?\"\n\n\"If he knew----?\" She still gave me, without prejudice to her\ningenuity--and indeed it was a part of this--all the work she could.\n\n\"Why, that Long and Lady John were thick?\"\n\n\"Ah, then,\" she cried, \"you admit they _are_!\"\n\n\"Am I not admitting everything you tell me? But the more I admit,\" I\nexplained, \"the more I must understand. It's _to_ admit, you see, that I\ninquire. If Briss came down with Lady John yesterday to oblige Mr.\nLong----\"\n\n\"He didn't come,\" she interrupted, \"to oblige Mr. Long!\"\n\n\"Well, then, to oblige Lady John herself----\"\n\n\"He didn't come to oblige Lady John herself!\"\n\n\"Well, then, to oblige his clever wife----\"\n\n\"He didn't come to oblige his clever wife! He came,\" said Mrs. Briss,\n\"just to amuse himself. He _has_ his amusements, and it's odd,\" she\nremarkably laughed, \"that you should grudge them to him!\"\n\n\"It would be odd indeed if I did! But put his proceeding,\" I continued,\n\"on any ground you like; you described to me the purpose of it as a\nscreening of the pair.\"\n\n\"I described to you the purpose of it as nothing of the sort. I didn't\ndescribe to you the purpose of it,\" said Mrs. Briss, \"at all. I\ndescribed to you,\" she triumphantly set forth, \"the _effect_ of\nit--which is a very different thing.\"\n\nI could only meet her with admiration. \"You're of an astuteness----!\"\n\n\"Of course I'm of an astuteness! I _see_ effects. And I saw that one.\nHow much Briss himself had seen it is, as I've told you, another matter;\nand what he had, at any rate, quite taken the affair for was the sort of\nflirtation in which, if one is a friend to either party, and one's own\nfeelings are not at stake, one may now and then give people a lift.\nHaven't I asked you before,\" she demanded, \"if you suppose he would have\ngiven one had he had an idea where these people _are_?\"\n\n\"I scarce know what you have asked me before!\" I sighed; \"and 'where\nthey are' is just what you haven't told me.\"\n\n\"It's where my husband was so annoyed unmistakably to discover them.\"\nAnd as if she had quite fixed the point she passed to another. \"He's\npeculiar, dear old Briss, but in a way by which, if one uses him--by\nwhich, I mean, if one depends on him--at all, one gains, I think, more\nthan one loses. Up to a certain point, in any case that's the least a\ncase for subtlety, he sees nothing at all; but beyond it--when once he\ndoes wake up--he'll go through a house. Nothing then escapes him, and\nwhat he drags to light is sometimes appalling.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" I thoughtfully responded--\"since witness this occasion!\"\n\n\"But isn't the interest of this occasion, as I've already suggested,\"\nshe propounded, \"simply that it makes an end, bursts a bubble, rids us\nof an incubus and permits us to go to bed in peace? I thank God,\" she\nmoralised, \"for dear old Briss to-night.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" I after a moment returned; \"but I shall do so with still\ngreater fervour if you'll have for the space of another question a still\ngreater patience.\" With which, as a final movement from her seemed to\nsay how much this was to ask, I had on my own side a certain\nexasperation of soreness for all I had to acknowledge--even were it mere\nacknowledgment--that she had brought rattling down. \"Remember,\" I\npleaded, \"that you're costing me a perfect palace of thought!\"\n\nI could see too that, held unexpectedly by something in my tone, she\nreally took it in. Couldn't I even almost see that, for an odd instant,\nshe regretted the blighted pleasure of the pursuit of truth with me? I\nneeded, at all events, no better proof either of the sweet or of the\nbitter in her comprehension than the accent with which she replied: \"Oh,\nthose who live in glass houses----\"\n\n\"Shouldn't--no, I know they shouldn't--throw stones; and that's\nprecisely why I don't.\" I had taken her immediately up, and I held her\nby it and by something better still. \"You, from your fortress of\ngranite, can chuck them about as you will! All the more reason,\nhowever,\" I quickly added, \"that, before my frail, but, as I maintain,\nquite sublime structure, you honour me, for a few seconds, with an\nintelligent look at it. I seem myself to see it again, perfect in every\npart,\" I pursued, \"even while I thus speak to you, and to feel afresh\nthat, weren't the wretched accident of its weak foundation, it wouldn't\nhave the shadow of a flaw. I've spoken of it in my conceivable regret,\"\nI conceded, \"as already a mere heap of disfigured fragments; but that\nwas the extravagance of my vexation, my despair. It's in point of fact\nso beautifully fitted that it comes apart piece by piece--which, so far\nas that goes, you've seen it do in the last quarter of an hour at your\nown touch, quite handing me the pieces, one by one, yourself and\nwatching me stack them along the ground. They're not even in this\nstate--see!\" I wound up--\"a pile of ruins!\" I wound up, as I say, but\nonly for long enough to have, with the vibration, the exaltation, of my\neloquence, my small triumph as against her great one. \"I should almost\nlike, piece by piece, to hand them back to you.\" And this time I\ncompleted my figure. \"I believe that, for the very charm of it, you'd\nfind yourself placing them by your own sense in their order and rearing\nonce more the splendid pile. Will you take just _one_ of them from me\nagain,\" I insisted, \"and let me see if only to have it in your hands\ndoesn't positively start you off? That's what I meant just now by asking\nyou for another answer.\" She had remained silent, as if really in the\npresence of the rising magnificence of my metaphor, and it was not too\nlate for the one chance left me. \"There was nothing, you know, I had so\nfitted as your account of poor Mrs. Server when, on our seeing them,\nfrom the terrace, together below, you struck off your explanation that\nold Briss was _her_ screen for Long.\"\n\n\"Fitted?\"--and there was sincerity in her surprise. \"I thought my stupid\nidea the one for which you had exactly no use!\"\n\n\"I had no use,\" I instantly concurred, \"for your stupid idea, but I had\ngreat use for your stupidly, alas! having it. _That_ fitted\nbeautifully,\" I smiled, \"till the piece came out. And even now,\" I\nadded, \"I don't feel it quite accounted for.\"\n\n\"Their being there together?\"\n\n\"No. Your not liking it that they were.\"\n\nShe stared. \"Not liking it?\"\n\nI could see how little indeed she minded now, but I also kept the thread\nof my own intellectual history. \"Yes. Your not liking it is what I speak\nof as the piece. I hold it, you see, up before you. What, artistically,\nwould you do with it?\"\n\nBut one might take a horse to water----! I held it up before her, but I\ncouldn't make her look at it. \"How do you know what I mayn't, or may,\nhave liked?\"\n\nIt did bring me to. \"Because you were conscious of not telling me? Well,\neven if you didn't----!\"\n\n\"That made no difference,\" she inquired with a generous derision,\n\"because you could always imagine? Of course you could always\nimagine--which is precisely what is the matter with you! But I'm\nsurprised at your coming to me with it once more as evidence of\nanything.\"\n\nI stood rebuked, and even more so than I showed her, for she need,\nobviously, only decline to take one of my counters to deprive it of all\nvalue as coin. When she pushed it across I had but to pocket it again.\n\"It _is_ the weakness of my case,\" I feebly and I daresay awkwardly\nmused at her, \"that any particular thing you don't grant me becomes\nstraightway the strength of yours. Of course, however\"--and I gave\nmyself a shake--\"I'm absolutely rejoicing (am I not?) in the strength of\nyours. The weakness of my own is what, under your instruction, I'm now\ngoing into; but don't you see how much weaker it will show if I draw\nfrom you the full expression of your indifference? How _could_ you in\nfact care when what you were at the very moment urging on me so hard was\nthe extravagance of Mrs. Server's conduct? That extravagance then proved\nher, to your eyes, the woman who had a connection with Long to keep the\nworld off the scent of--though you maintained that in spite of the dust\nshe kicked up by it she was, at a pinch, now and then to be caught with\nhim. That instead of being caught with him she was caught only with\nBrissenden annoyed you naturally for the moment; but what was that\nannoyance compared to your appreciation of her showing--by undertaking\nyour husband, of all people!--just the more markedly _as_ extravagant?\"\n\nShe had been sufficiently interested this time to follow me. \"What was\nit indeed?\"\n\nI greeted her acquiescence, but I insisted. \"And yet if she _is_\nextravagant--what do you do with it?\"\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't hear of it!\" she exclaimed.\n\nI sought to combine firmness with my mildness. \"What do you do with it?\"\n\nBut she could match me at this. \"I thought you wouldn't hear of it!\"\n\n\"It's not a question of _my_ dispositions. It's a question of her having\nbeen, or not been, for you 'all over the place,' and of everyone's also\nbeing, for you, on the chatter about it. You go by that in respect to\nLong--by your holding, that is, that nothing has been noticed; therefore\nmustn't you go by it in respect to _her_--since I understand from you\nthat everything has?\"\n\n\"Everything always is,\" Mrs. Briss agreeably replied, \"in a place and a\nparty like this; but so little--anything in particular--that, with\npeople moving 'every which' way, it comes to the same as if nothing was.\nThings are not, also, gouged out to _your_ tune, and it depends, still\nfurther, on what you mean by 'extravagant.'\"\n\n\"I mean whatever you yourself meant.\"\n\n\"Well, I myself mean no longer, you know, what I did mean.\"\n\n\"She isn't then----?\"\n\nBut suddenly she was almost sharp with me. \"Isn't what?\"\n\n\"What the woman we so earnestly looked for would have to be.\"\n\n\"All gone?\" She had hesitated, but she went on with decision. \"No, she\nisn't all gone, since there was enough of her left to make up to poor\nBriss.\"\n\n\"Precisely--and it's just what we saw, and just what, with her other\ndashes of the same sort, led us to have to face the question of her\nbeing--well, what I say. Or rather,\" I added, \"what _you_ say. That is,\"\nI amended, to keep perfectly straight, \"what you say you _don't_ say.\"\n\nI took indeed too many precautions for my friend not to have to look at\nthem. \"Extravagant?\" The irritation of the word had grown for her, yet I\nrisked repeating it, and with the effect of its giving her another\npause. \"I tell you she _isn't_, that!\"\n\n\"Exactly; and it's only to ask you what in the world then she _is_.\"\n\n\"She's horrid!\" said Mrs. Briss.\n\n\"'Horrid'?\" I gloomily echoed.\n\n\"Horrid. It wasn't,\" she then developed with decision, \"a 'dash,' as you\nsay, 'of the same sort'--though goodness knows of what sort you mean; it\nwasn't, to be plain, a 'dash' at all.\" My companion _was_ plain. \"She\nsettled. She stuck.\" And finally, as I could but echo her again: \"She\nmade love to him.\"\n\n\"But--a--really?\"\n\n\"Really. That's how I knew.\"\n\nI was at sea. \"'Knew'? But you saw.\"\n\n\"I knew--that is I learnt--more than I saw. I knew she couldn't be\ngone.\"\n\nIt in fact brought light. \"Knew it by _him_?\"\n\n\"He told me,\" said Mrs. Briss.\n\nIt brought light, but it brought also, I fear, for me, another queer\ngrimace. \"Does he then regularly tell?\"\n\n\"Regularly. But what he tells,\" she did herself the justice to declare,\n\"is not always so much to the point as the two things I've repeated to\nyou.\"\n\nTheir weight then suggested that I should have them over again. \"His\nrevelation, in the first place, of Long and Lady John?\"\n\n\"And his revelation in the second\"--she spoke of it as a broad joke--\"of\nMay Server and himself.\"\n\nThere was something in her joke that was a chill to my mind; but I\nnevertheless played up. \"And what does he say that's further interesting\nabout _that_?\"\n\n\"Why, that she's awfully sharp.\"\n\nI gasped--she turned it out so. \"_She_--Mrs. Server?\"\n\nIt made her, however, equally stare. \"Why, isn't it the very thing you\nmaintained?\"\n\nI felt her dreadful logic, but I couldn't--with my exquisite image all\ncontrasted, as in a flash from flint, with this monstrosity--so much as\nentertain her question. I could only stupidly again sound it. \"Awfully\nsharp?\"\n\n\"You after all then now don't?\" It was she herself whom the words at\npresent described! \"Then what on earth _do_ you think?\" The strange\nmixture in my face naturally made her ask it, but everything, within a\nminute, had somehow so given way under the touch of her supreme\nassurance, the presentation of her own now finished system, that I dare\nsay I couldn't at the moment have in the least trusted myself to tell\nher. She left me, however, in fact, small time--she only took enough,\nwith her negations arrayed and her insolence recaptured, to judge me\nafresh, which she did as she gathered herself up into the strength of\ntwenty-five. I didn't after all--it appeared part of my smash--know the\nweight of her husband's years, but I knew the weight of my own. They\nmight have been a thousand, and nothing but the sense of them would in a\nmoment, I saw, be left me. \"My poor dear, you _are_ crazy, and I bid you\ngood-night!\"\n\nNothing but the sense of them--on my taking it from her without a sound\nand watching her, through the lighted rooms, retreat and\ndisappear--_was_ at first left me; but after a minute something else\ncame, and I grew conscious that her verdict lingered. She had so had the\nlast word that, to get out of its planted presence, I shook myself, as I\nhad done before, from my thought. When once I had started to my room\nindeed--and to preparation for a livelier start as soon as the house\nshould stir again--I almost breathlessly hurried. Such a last word--the\nword that put me altogether nowhere--was too unacceptable not to\nprescribe afresh that prompt test of escape to other air for which I had\nearlier in the evening seen so much reason. I _should_ certainly never\nagain, on the spot, quite hang together, even though it wasn't really\nthat I hadn't three times her method. What I too fatally lacked was her\ntone.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\n\ninsistance=>insistence\n\nopenely=>openly\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sacred Fount, by Henry James\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SACRED FOUNT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32939-8.txt or 32939-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/2\/9\/3\/32939\/\n\nProduced by Chuck Greif and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":680,"split":"train"}
