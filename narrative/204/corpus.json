His principal motivation is his love for Ruth Morse. Because Eden is a rough, uneducated sailor from a working-class background and the Morses are a bourgeois family, a union between them would be impossible unless and until he reached their level of wealth and refinement.\nOver a period of two years, Eden promises Ruth that success will come, but just before it does, Ruth loses her patience and rejects him in a letter, saying, \"if only you had settled down\u00c2\u00a0... and attempted to make something of yourself\". By the time Eden attains the favour of the publishers and the bourgeoisie who had shunned him, he has already developed a grudge against them and become jaded by toil and unrequited love. Instead of enjoying his success, he retreats into a quiet indifference, interrupted only to rail mentally against the genteelness of bourgeois society or to donate his new wealth to working-class friends and family. He felt that people did not value him for himself or for his work but only for his fame.\nThe novel ends with Eden's committing suicide by drowning, which contributed to what researcher Clarice Stasz calls the \"biographical myth\" that Jack London's own death was a suicide.\nLondon's oldest daughter Joan commented that in spite of its tragic ending, the book is often regarded as \"a 'success' story\u00c2\u00a0... which inspired not only a whole generation of young writers but other different fields who, without aid or encouragement, attained their objectives through great struggle\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Martin Eden, by Jack London\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He wore rough clothes that smacked\nof the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in\nwhich he found himself.  He did not know what to do with his cap, and was\nstuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him.  The\nact was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young fellow\nappreciated it.  \"He understands,\" was his thought.  \"He'll see me\nthrough all right.\"\n\nHe walked at the other's heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his\nlegs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and\nsinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea.  The wide rooms seemed\ntoo narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his\nbroad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac\nfrom the low mantel.  He recoiled from side to side between the various\nobjects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his\nmind.  Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high with books was\nspace for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed it with\ntrepidation.  His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides.  He did not know\nwhat to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited vision,\none arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table, he lurched\naway like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool.  He watched\nthe easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time\nrealized that his walk was different from that of other men.  He\nexperienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly.\nThe sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he\npaused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Hold on, Arthur, my boy,\" he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with\nfacetious utterance.  \"This is too much all at once for yours truly.  Give\nme a chance to get my nerve.  You know I didn't want to come, an' I guess\nyour fam'ly ain't hankerin' to see me neither.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" was the reassuring answer.  \"You mustn't be\nfrightened at us.  We're just homely people--Hello, there's a letter for\nme.\"\n\nHe stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to read,\ngiving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself.  And the stranger\nunderstood and appreciated.  His was the gift of sympathy, understanding;\nand beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on.  He\nmopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with a controlled face,\nthough in the eyes there was an expression such as wild animals betray\nwhen they fear the trap.  He was surrounded by the unknown, apprehensive\nof what might happen, ignorant of what he should do, aware that he walked\nand bore himself awkwardly, fearful that every attribute and power of him\nwas similarly afflicted.  He was keenly sensitive, hopelessly\nself-conscious, and the amused glance that the other stole privily at him\nover the top of the letter burned into him like a dagger-thrust.  He saw\nthe glance, but he gave no sign, for among the things he had learned was\ndiscipline.  Also, that dagger-thrust went to his pride.  He cursed\nhimself for having come, and at the same time resolved that, happen what\nwould, having come, he would carry it through.  The lines of his face\nhardened, and into his eyes came a fighting light.  He looked about more\nunconcernedly, sharply observant, every detail of the pretty interior\nregistering itself on his brain.  His eyes were wide apart; nothing in\ntheir field of vision escaped; and as they drank in the beauty before\nthem the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place.  He was\nresponsive to beauty, and here was cause to respond.\n\nAn oil painting caught and held him.  A heavy surf thundered and burst\nover an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and,\noutside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over\ntill every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a\nstormy sunset sky.  There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly.  He\nforgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close.  The\nbeauty faded out of the canvas.  His face expressed his bepuzzlement.  He\nstared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then stepped away.\nImmediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas.  \"A trick\npicture,\" was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the\nmultitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod\nof indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick.\nHe did not know painting.  He had been brought up on chromos and\nlithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or far.  He had\nseen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the\nglass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too\nnear.\n\nHe glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on\nthe table.  Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly\nas the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food.\nAn impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders,\nbrought him to the table, where he began affectionately handling the\nbooks.  He glanced at the titles and the authors' names, read fragments\nof text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands, and, once,\nrecognized a book he had read.  For the rest, they were strange books and\nstrange authors.  He chanced upon a volume of Swinburne and began reading\nsteadily, forgetful of where he was, his face glowing.  Twice he closed\nthe book on his forefinger to look at the name of the author.  Swinburne!\nhe would remember that name.  That fellow had eyes, and he had certainly\nseen color and flashing light.  But who was Swinburne?  Was he dead a\nhundred years or so, like most of the poets?  Or was he alive still, and\nwriting?  He turned to the title-page . . . yes, he had written other\nbooks; well, he would go to the free library the first thing in the\nmorning and try to get hold of some of Swinburne's stuff.  He went back\nto the text and lost himself.  He did not notice that a young woman had\nentered the room.  The first he knew was when he heard Arthur's voice\nsaying:-\n\n\"Ruth, this is Mr. Eden.\"\n\nThe book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was\nthrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but of\nher brother's words.  Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of\nquivering sensibilities.  At the slightest impact of the outside world\nupon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt and\nplayed like lambent flame.  He was extraordinarily receptive and\nresponsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work\nestablishing relations of likeness and difference.  \"Mr. Eden,\" was what\nhe had thrilled to--he who had been called \"Eden,\" or \"Martin Eden,\" or\njust \"Martin,\" all his life.  And \"_Mister_!\"  It was certainly going\nsome, was his internal comment.  His mind seemed to turn, on the instant,\ninto a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his consciousness\nendless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and forecastles, camps and\nbeaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals and slum streets,\nwherein the thread of association was the fashion in which he had been\naddressed in those various situations.\n\nAnd then he turned and saw the girl.  The phantasmagoria of his brain\nvanished at sight of her.  She was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide,\nspiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair.  He did not know how she\nwas dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful as she.  He likened\nher to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem.  No, she was a spirit, a\ndivinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty was not of the earth.  Or\nperhaps the books were right, and there were many such as she in the\nupper walks of life.  She might well be sung by that chap, Swinburne.\nPerhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl,\nIseult, in the book there on the table.  All this plethora of sight, and\nfeeling, and thought occurred on the instant.  There was no pause of the\nrealities wherein he moved.  He saw her hand coming out to his, and she\nlooked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man.\nThe women he had known did not shake hands that way.  For that matter,\nmost of them did not shake hands at all.  A flood of associations,\nvisions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women, rushed\ninto his mind and threatened to swamp it.  But he shook them aside and\nlooked at her.  Never had he seen such a woman.  The women he had known!\nImmediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women he had known.\nFor an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait gallery,\nwherein she occupied the central place, while about her were limned many\nwomen, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance, herself the\nunit of weight and measure.  He saw the weak and sickly faces of the\ngirls of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous girls from the\nsouth of Market.  There were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy\ncigarette-smoking women of Old Mexico.  These, in turn, were crowded out\nby Japanese women, doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden clogs; by\nEurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy; by full-bodied\nSouth-Sea-Island women, flower-crowned and brown-skinned.  All these were\nblotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood--frowsy,\nshuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel, gin-bloated hags\nof the stews, and all the vast hell's following of harpies, vile-mouthed\nand filthy, that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon\nsailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and slime of the human pit.\n\n\"Won't you sit down, Mr. Eden?\" the girl was saying.  \"I have been\nlooking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us.  It was brave\nof you--\"\n\nHe waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all,\nwhat he had done, and that any fellow would have done it.  She noticed\nthat the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the process\nof healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed it to be\nin the same condition.  Also, with quick, critical eye, she noted a scar\non his cheek, another that peeped out from under the hair of the\nforehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared under the starched\ncollar.  She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the\nchafe of the collar against the bronzed neck.  He was evidently unused to\nstiff collars.  Likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore,\nthe cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of the coat across the\nshoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised\nbulging biceps muscles.\n\nWhile he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all, he\nwas obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair.  He found time to\nadmire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair\nfacing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was\ncutting.  This was a new experience for him.  All his life, up to then,\nhe had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward.  Such thoughts\nof self had never entered his mind.  He sat down gingerly on the edge of\nthe chair, greatly worried by his hands.  They were in the way wherever\nhe put them.  Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his\nexit with longing eyes.  He felt lost, alone there in the room with that\npale spirit of a woman.  There was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for\ndrinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by\nmeans of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.\n\n\"You have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,\" the girl was saying.  \"How\ndid it happen?  I am sure it must have been some adventure.\"\n\n\"A Mexican with a knife, miss,\" he answered, moistening his parched lips\nand clearing his throat.  \"It was just a fight.  After I got the knife\naway, he tried to bite off my nose.\"\n\nBaldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot,\nstarry night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights of the\nsugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in the\ndistance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the Mexican's\nface, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting of the\nsteel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd and the cries, the\ntwo bodies, his and the Mexican's, locked together, rolling over and over\nand tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling\nof a guitar.  Such was the picture, and he thrilled to the memory of it,\nwondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilot-schooner on\nthe wall.  The white beach, the stars, and the lights of the sugar\nsteamers would look great, he thought, and midway on the sand the dark\ngroup of figures that surrounded the fighters.  The knife occupied a\nplace in the picture, he decided, and would show well, with a sort of\ngleam, in the light of the stars.  But of all this no hint had crept into\nhis speech.  \"He tried to bite off my nose,\" he concluded.\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in\nher sensitive face.\n\nHe felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on\nhis sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks\nhad been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room.  Such sordid\nthings as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for\nconversation with a lady.  People in the books, in her walk of life, did\nnot talk about such things--perhaps they did not know about them, either.\n\nThere was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get\nstarted.  Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek.  Even\nas she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk,\nand he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.\n\n\"It was just an accident,\" he said, putting his hand to his cheek.  \"One\nnight, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift carried\naway, an' next the tackle.  The lift was wire, an' it was threshin'\naround like a snake.  The whole watch was tryin' to grab it, an' I rushed\nin an' got swatted.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though\nsecretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering\nwhat a _lift_ was and what _swatted_ meant.\n\n\"This man Swineburne,\" he began, attempting to put his plan into\nexecution and pronouncing the i long.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Swineburne,\" he repeated, with the same mispronunciation.  \"The poet.\"\n\n\"Swinburne,\" she corrected.\n\n\"Yes, that's the chap,\" he stammered, his cheeks hot again.  \"How long\nsince he died?\"\n\n\"Why, I haven't heard that he was dead.\"  She looked at him curiously.\n\"Where did you make his acquaintance?\"\n\n\"I never clapped eyes on him,\" was the reply.  \"But I read some of his\npoetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in.  How\ndo you like his poetry?\"\n\nAnd thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had\nsuggested.  He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge of\nthe chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it might get\naway from him and buck him to the floor.  He had succeeded in making her\ntalk her talk, and while she rattled on, he strove to follow her,\nmarvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head\nof hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face.  Follow her he did,\nthough bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by\ncritical phrases and thought-processes that were foreign to his mind, but\nthat nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling.  Here was\nintellectual life, he thought, and here was beauty, warm and wonderful as\nhe had never dreamed it could be.  He forgot himself and stared at her\nwith hungry eyes.  Here was something to live for, to win to, to fight\nfor--ay, and die for.  The books were true.  There were such women in the\nworld.  She was one of them.  She lent wings to his imagination, and\ngreat, luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed\nvague, gigantic figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for\nwoman's sake--for a pale woman, a flower of gold.  And through the\nswaying, palpitant vision, as through a fairy mirage, he stared at the\nreal woman, sitting there and talking of literature and art.  He listened\nas well, but he stared, unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the\nfact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in\nhis eyes.  But she, who knew little of the world of men, being a woman,\nwas keenly aware of his burning eyes.  She had never had men look at her\nin such fashion, and it embarrassed her.  She stumbled and halted in her\nutterance.  The thread of argument slipped from her.  He frightened her,\nand at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon.  Her\ntraining warned her of peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring;\nwhile her instincts rang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her\nto hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world,\nto this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red\ncaused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently,\nwas soiled and tainted by ungracious existence.  She was clean, and her\ncleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to\nlearn the paradox of woman.\n\n\"As I was saying--what was I saying?\"  She broke off abruptly and laughed\nmerrily at her predicament.\n\n\"You was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein' a great poet\nbecause--an' that was as far as you got, miss,\" he prompted, while to\nhimself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious little thrills crawled\nup and down his spine at the sound of her laughter.  Like silver, he\nthought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and on the instant, and\nfor an instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink cherry\nblossoms, he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked\npagoda calling straw-sandalled devotees to worship.\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" she said.  \"Swinburne fails, when all is said, because\nhe is, well, indelicate.  There are many of his poems that should never\nbe read.  Every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful\ntruth, and calls to all that is high and noble in the human.  Not a line\nof the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I thought it was great,\" he said hesitatingly, \"the little I read.  I\nhad no idea he was such a--a scoundrel.  I guess that crops out in his\nother books.\"\n\n\"There are many lines that could be spared from the book you were\nreading,\" she said, her voice primly firm and dogmatic.\n\n\"I must 'a' missed 'em,\" he announced.  \"What I read was the real goods.\nIt was all lighted up an' shining, an' it shun right into me an' lighted\nme up inside, like the sun or a searchlight.  That's the way it landed on\nme, but I guess I ain't up much on poetry, miss.\"\n\nHe broke off lamely.  He was confused, painfully conscious of his\ninarticulateness.  He had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he\nhad read, but his speech was inadequate.  He could not express what he\nfelt, and to himself he likened himself to a sailor, in a strange ship,\non a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging.  Well,\nhe decided, it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world.  He had\nnever seen anything that he couldn't get the hang of when he wanted to\nand it was about time for him to want to learn to talk the things that\nwere inside of him so that she could understand.  _She_ was bulking large\non his horizon.\n\n\"Now Longfellow--\" she was saying.\n\n\"Yes, I've read 'm,\" he broke in impulsively, spurred on to exhibit and\nmake the most of his little store of book knowledge, desirous of showing\nher that he was not wholly a stupid clod.  \"'The Psalm of Life,'\n'Excelsior,' an' . . . I guess that's all.\"\n\nShe nodded her head and smiled, and he felt, somehow, that her smile was\ntolerant, pitifully tolerant.  He was a fool to attempt to make a\npretence that way.  That Longfellow chap most likely had written\ncountless books of poetry.\n\n\"Excuse me, miss, for buttin' in that way.  I guess the real facts is\nthat I don't know nothin' much about such things.  It ain't in my class.\nBut I'm goin' to make it in my class.\"\n\nIt sounded like a threat.  His voice was determined, his eyes were\nflashing, the lines of his face had grown harsh.  And to her it seemed\nthat the angle of his jaw had changed; its pitch had become unpleasantly\naggressive.  At the same time a wave of intense virility seemed to surge\nout from him and impinge upon her.\n\n\"I think you could make it in--in your class,\" she finished with a laugh.\n\"You are very strong.\"\n\nHer gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck, heavy corded, almost\nbull-like, bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health and\nstrength.  And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt\ndrawn to him.  She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her\nmind.  It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that\nneck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her.  She was\nshocked by this thought.  It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed\ndepravity in her nature.  Besides, strength to her was a gross and\nbrutish thing.  Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender\ngracefulness.  Yet the thought still persisted.  It bewildered her that\nshe should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck.  In truth,\nshe was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for\nstrength.  But she did not know it.  She knew only that no man had ever\naffected her before as this one had, who shocked her from moment to\nmoment with his awful grammar.\n\n\"Yes, I ain't no invalid,\" he said.  \"When it comes down to hard-pan, I\ncan digest scrap-iron.  But just now I've got dyspepsia.  Most of what\nyou was sayin' I can't digest.  Never trained that way, you see.  I like\nbooks and poetry, and what time I've had I've read 'em, but I've never\nthought about 'em the way you have.  That's why I can't talk about 'em.\nI'm like a navigator adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass.\nNow I want to get my bearin's.  Mebbe you can put me right.  How did you\nlearn all this you've ben talkin'?\"\n\n\"By going to school, I fancy, and by studying,\" she answered.\n\n\"I went to school when I was a kid,\" he began to object.\n\n\"Yes; but I mean high school, and lectures, and the university.\"\n\n\"You've gone to the university?\" he demanded in frank amazement.  He felt\nthat she had become remoter from him by at least a million miles.\n\n\"I'm going there now.  I'm taking special courses in English.\"\n\nHe did not know what \"English\" meant, but he made a mental note of that\nitem of ignorance and passed on.\n\n\"How long would I have to study before I could go to the university?\" he\nasked.\n\nShe beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge, and said: \"That\ndepends upon how much studying you have already done.  You have never\nattended high school?  Of course not.  But did you finish grammar\nschool?\"\n\n\"I had two years to run, when I left,\" he answered.  \"But I was always\nhonorably promoted at school.\"\n\nThe next moment, angry with himself for the boast, he had gripped the\narms of the chair so savagely that every finger-end was stinging.  At the\nsame moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room.  He saw\nthe girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the\nnewcomer.  They kissed each other, and, with arms around each other's\nwaists, they advanced toward him.  That must be her mother, he thought.\nShe was a tall, blond woman, slender, and stately, and beautiful.  Her\ngown was what he might expect in such a house.  His eyes delighted in the\ngraceful lines of it.  She and her dress together reminded him of women\non the stage.  Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns\nentering the London theatres while he stood and watched and the policemen\nshoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning.  Next his mind leaped\nto the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the sidewalk, he had\nseen grand ladies.  Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama, in a\nthousand pictures, began flashing before his eyes.  But he swiftly\ndismissed the kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the urgent need of the\npresent.  He knew that he must stand up to be introduced, and he\nstruggled painfully to his feet, where he stood with trousers bagging at\nthe knees, his arms loose-hanging and ludicrous, his face set hard for\nthe impending ordeal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nThe process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him.\nBetween halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times\nseemed impossible.  But at last he had made it, and was seated alongside\nof Her.  The array of knives and forks frightened him.  They bristled\nwith unknown perils, and he gazed at them, fascinated, till their dazzle\nbecame a background across which moved a succession of forecastle\npictures, wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with\nsheath-knives and fingers, or scooping thick pea-soup out of pannikins by\nmeans of battered iron spoons.  The stench of bad beef was in his\nnostrils, while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers and\ngroaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth-noises of the eaters.  He\nwatched them eating, and decided that they ate like pigs.  Well, he would\nbe careful here.  He would make no noise.  He would keep his mind upon it\nall the time.\n\nHe glanced around the table.  Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur's\nbrother, Norman.  They were her brothers, he reminded himself, and his\nheart warmed toward them.  How they loved each other, the members of this\nfamily!  There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother, of the\nkiss of greeting, and of the pair of them walking toward him with arms\nentwined.  Not in his world were such displays of affection between\nparents and children made.  It was a revelation of the heights of\nexistence that were attained in the world above.  It was the finest thing\nyet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world.  He was moved\ndeeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting with sympathetic\ntenderness.  He had starved for love all his life.  His nature craved\nlove.  It was an organic demand of his being.  Yet he had gone without,\nand hardened himself in the process.  He had not known that he needed\nlove.  Nor did he know it now.  He merely saw it in operation, and\nthrilled to it, and thought it fine, and high, and splendid.\n\nHe was glad that Mr. Morse was not there.  It was difficult enough\ngetting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman.\nArthur he already knew somewhat.  The father would have been too much for\nhim, he felt sure.  It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in\nhis life.  The severest toil was child's play compared with this.  Tiny\nnodules of moisture stood out on his forehead, and his shirt was wet with\nsweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed things at once.  He\nhad to eat as he had never eaten before, to handle strange tools, to\nglance surreptitiously about and learn how to accomplish each new thing,\nto receive the flood of impressions that was pouring in upon him and\nbeing mentally annotated and classified; to be conscious of a yearning\nfor her that perturbed him in the form of a dull, aching restlessness; to\nfeel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod, and\nto have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and vague\nplans of how to reach to her.  Also, when his secret glance went across\nto Norman opposite him, or to any one else, to ascertain just what knife\nor fork was to be used in any particular occasion, that person's features\nwere seized upon by his mind, which automatically strove to appraise them\nand to divine what they were--all in relation to her.  Then he had to\ntalk, to hear what was said to him and what was said back and forth, and\nto answer, when it was necessary, with a tongue prone to looseness of\nspeech that required a constant curb.  And to add confusion to confusion,\nthere was the servant, an unceasing menace, that appeared noiselessly at\nhis shoulder, a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums\ndemanding instantaneous solution.  He was oppressed throughout the meal\nby the thought of finger-bowls.  Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of\ntimes, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like.  He\nhad heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the next\nfew minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings who used\nthem--ay, and he would use them himself.  And most important of all, far\ndown and yet always at the surface of his thought, was the problem of how\nhe should comport himself toward these persons.  What should his attitude\nbe?  He wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem.  There were\ncowardly suggestions that he should make believe, assume a part; and\nthere were still more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail\nin such course, that his nature was not fitted to live up to it, and that\nhe would make a fool of himself.\n\nIt was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide upon his\nattitude, that he was very quiet.  He did not know that his quietness was\ngiving the lie to Arthur's words of the day before, when that brother of\nhers had announced that he was going to bring a wild man home to dinner\nand for them not to be alarmed, because they would find him an\ninteresting wild man.  Martin Eden could not have found it in him, just\nthen, to believe that her brother could be guilty of such\ntreachery--especially when he had been the means of getting this\nparticular brother out of an unpleasant row.  So he sat at table,\nperturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that\nwent on about him.  For the first time he realized that eating was\nsomething more than a utilitarian function.  He was unaware of what he\nate.  It was merely food.  He was feasting his love of beauty at this\ntable where eating was an aesthetic function.  It was an intellectual\nfunction, too.  His mind was stirred.  He heard words spoken that were\nmeaningless to him, and other words that he had seen only in books and\nthat no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to\npronounce.  When he heard such words dropping carelessly from the lips of\nthe members of this marvellous family, her family, he thrilled with\ndelight.  The romance, and beauty, and high vigor of the books were\ncoming true.  He was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees\nhis dreams stalk out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact.\n\nNever had he been at such an altitude of living, and he kept himself in\nthe background, listening, observing, and pleasuring, replying in\nreticent monosyllables, saying, \"Yes, miss,\" and \"No, miss,\" to her, and\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" and \"No, ma'am,\" to her mother.  He curbed the impulse,\narising out of his sea-training, to say \"Yes, sir,\" and \"No, sir,\" to her\nbrothers.  He felt that it would be inappropriate and a confession of\ninferiority on his part--which would never do if he was to win to her.\nAlso, it was a dictate of his pride.  \"By God!\" he cried to himself,\nonce; \"I'm just as good as them, and if they do know lots that I don't, I\ncould learn 'm a few myself, all the same!\"  And the next moment, when\nshe or her mother addressed him as \"Mr. Eden,\" his aggressive pride was\nforgotten, and he was glowing and warm with delight.  He was a civilized\nman, that was what he was, shoulder to shoulder, at dinner, with people\nhe had read about in books.  He was in the books himself, adventuring\nthrough the printed pages of bound volumes.\n\nBut while he belied Arthur's description, and appeared a gentle lamb\nrather than a wild man, he was racking his brains for a course of action.\nHe was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle would never do for\nthe high-pitched dominance of his nature.  He talked only when he had to,\nand then his speech was like his walk to the table, filled with jerks and\nhalts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for words, debating over\nwords he knew were fit but which he feared he could not pronounce,\nrejecting other words he knew would not be understood or would be raw and\nharsh.  But all the time he was oppressed by the consciousness that this\ncarefulness of diction was making a booby of him, preventing him from\nexpressing what he had in him.  Also, his love of freedom chafed against\nthe restriction in much the same way his neck chafed against the starched\nfetter of a collar.  Besides, he was confident that he could not keep it\nup.  He was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility, and the\ncreative spirit was restive and urgent.  He was swiftly mastered by the\nconcept or sensation in him that struggled in birth-throes to receive\nexpression and form, and then he forgot himself and where he was, and the\nold words--the tools of speech he knew--slipped out.\n\nOnce, he declined something from the servant who interrupted and pestered\nat his shoulder, and he said, shortly and emphatically, \"Pew!\"\n\nOn the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant, the\nservant was smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification.  But\nhe recovered himself quickly.\n\n\"It's the Kanaka for 'finish,'\" he explained, \"and it just come out\nnaturally.  It's spelt p-a-u.\"\n\nHe caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and, being\nin explanatory mood, he said:-\n\n\"I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers.  She was\nbehind time, an' around the Puget Sound ports we worked like niggers,\nstoring cargo-mixed freight, if you know what that means.  That's how the\nskin got knocked off.\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't that,\" she hastened to explain, in turn.  \"Your hands\nseemed too small for your body.\"\n\nHis cheeks were hot.  He took it as an exposure of another of his\ndeficiencies.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said depreciatingly.  \"They ain't big enough to stand the\nstrain.  I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders.  They are too\nstrong, an' when I smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed, too.\"\n\nHe was not happy at what he had said.  He was filled with disgust at\nhimself.  He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things\nthat were not nice.\n\n\"It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did--and you a stranger,\"\nshe said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture though not of the reason\nfor it.\n\nHe, in turn, realized what she had done, and in the consequent warm surge\nof gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose-worded tongue.\n\n\"It wasn't nothin' at all,\" he said.  \"Any guy 'ud do it for another.\nThat bunch of hoodlums was lookin' for trouble, an' Arthur wasn't\nbotherin' 'em none.  They butted in on 'm, an' then I butted in on them\nan' poked a few.  That's where some of the skin off my hands went, along\nwith some of the teeth of the gang.  I wouldn't 'a' missed it for\nanything.  When I seen--\"\n\nHe paused, open-mouthed, on the verge of the pit of his own depravity and\nutter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did.  And while Arthur\ntook up the tale, for the twentieth time, of his adventure with the\ndrunken hoodlums on the ferry-boat and of how Martin Eden had rushed in\nand rescued him, that individual, with frowning brows, meditated upon the\nfool he had made of himself, and wrestled more determinedly with the\nproblem of how he should conduct himself toward these people.  He\ncertainly had not succeeded so far.  He wasn't of their tribe, and he\ncouldn't talk their lingo, was the way he put it to himself.  He couldn't\nfake being their kind.  The masquerade would fail, and besides,\nmasquerade was foreign to his nature.  There was no room in him for sham\nor artifice.  Whatever happened, he must be real.  He couldn't talk their\ntalk just yet, though in time he would.  Upon that he was resolved.  But\nin the meantime, talk he must, and it must be his own talk, toned down,\nof course, so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to shook them\ntoo much.  And furthermore, he wouldn't claim, not even by tacit\nacceptance, to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar.  In\npursuance of this decision, when the two brothers, talking university\nshop, had used \"trig\" several times, Martin Eden demanded:-\n\n\"What is _trig_?\"\n\n\"Trignometry,\" Norman said; \"a higher form of math.\"\n\n\"And what is math?\" was the next question, which, somehow, brought the\nlaugh on Norman.\n\n\"Mathematics, arithmetic,\" was the answer.\n\nMartin Eden nodded.  He had caught a glimpse of the apparently\nillimitable vistas of knowledge.  What he saw took on tangibility.  His\nabnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.  In the\nalchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of\nknowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape.\nThe vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest glades, all\nsoftly luminous or shot through with flashing lights.  In the distance,\ndetail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but behind this purple\nhaze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the lure of romance.  It\nwas like wine to him.  Here was adventure, something to do with head and\nhand, a world to conquer--and straightway from the back of his\nconsciousness rushed the thought, _conquering, to win to her, that lily-\npale spirit sitting beside him_.\n\nThe glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur, who, all\nevening, had been trying to draw his wild man out.  Martin Eden\nremembered his decision.  For the first time he became himself,\nconsciously and deliberately at first, but soon lost in the joy of\ncreating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners' eyes.\nHe had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner Halcyon when\nshe was captured by a revenue cutter.  He saw with wide eyes, and he\ncould tell what he saw.  He brought the pulsing sea before them, and the\nmen and the ships upon the sea.  He communicated his power of vision,\ntill they saw with his eyes what he had seen.  He selected from the vast\nmass of detail with an artist's touch, drawing pictures of life that\nglowed and burned with light and color, injecting movement so that his\nlisteners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence,\nenthusiasm, and power.  At times he shocked them with the vividness of\nthe narrative and his terms of speech, but beauty always followed fast\nupon the heels of violence, and tragedy was relieved by humor, by\ninterpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors' minds.\n\nAnd while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes.  His fire\nwarmed her.  She wondered if she had been cold all her days.  She wanted\nto lean toward this burning, blazing man that was like a volcano spouting\nforth strength, robustness, and health.  She felt that she must lean\ntoward him, and resisted by an effort.  Then, too, there was the counter\nimpulse to shrink away from him.  She was repelled by those lacerated\nhands, grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was ingrained in the\nflesh itself, by that red chafe of the collar and those bulging muscles.\nHis roughness frightened her; each roughness of speech was an insult to\nher ear, each rough phase of his life an insult to her soul.  And ever\nand again would come the draw of him, till she thought he must be evil to\nhave such power over her.  All that was most firmly established in her\nmind was rocking.  His romance and adventure were battering at the\nconventions.  Before his facile perils and ready laugh, life was no\nlonger an affair of serious effort and restraint, but a toy, to be played\nwith and turned topsy-turvy, carelessly to be lived and pleasured in, and\ncarelessly to be flung aside.  \"Therefore, play!\" was the cry that rang\nthrough her.  \"Lean toward him, if so you will, and place your two hands\nupon his neck!\"  She wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the\nthought, and in vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture and\nbalanced all that she was against what he was not.  She glanced about her\nand saw the others gazing at him with rapt attention; and she would have\ndespaired had not she seen horror in her mother's eyes--fascinated\nhorror, it was true, but none the less horror.  This man from outer\ndarkness was evil.  Her mother saw it, and her mother was right.  She\nwould trust her mother's judgment in this as she had always trusted it in\nall things.  The fire of him was no longer warm, and the fear of him was\nno longer poignant.\n\nLater, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively, with\nthe vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that\nseparated them.  Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his\nhead; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him.  He\ngazed upon her in awe.  In his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened; but\nfaster than it widened, towered his ambition to win across it.  But he\nwas too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a gulf a\nwhole evening, especially when there was music.  He was remarkably\nsusceptible to music.  It was like strong drink, firing him to audacities\nof feeling,--a drug that laid hold of his imagination and went\ncloud-soaring through the sky.  It banished sordid fact, flooded his mind\nwith beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings.  He did not\nunderstand the music she played.  It was different from the dance-hall\npiano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard.  But he had caught\nhints of such music from the books, and he accepted her playing largely\non faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the lifting measures of\npronounced and simple rhythm, puzzled because those measures were not\nlong continued.  Just as he caught the swing of them and started, his\nimagination attuned in flight, always they vanished away in a chaotic\nscramble of sounds that was meaningless to him, and that dropped his\nimagination, an inert weight, back to earth.\n\nOnce, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this.\nHe caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that\nher hands pronounced upon the keys.  Then he dismissed the thought as\nunworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely to the music.\nThe old delightful condition began to be induced.  His feet were no\nlonger clay, and his flesh became spirit; before his eyes and behind his\neyes shone a great glory; and then the scene before him vanished and he\nwas away, rocking over the world that was to him a very dear world.  The\nknown and the unknown were commingled in the dream-pageant that thronged\nhis vision.  He entered strange ports of sun-washed lands, and trod\nmarket-places among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen.  The\nscent of the spice islands was in his nostrils as he had known it on\nwarm, breathless nights at sea, or he beat up against the southeast\ntrades through long tropic days, sinking palm-tufted coral islets in the\nturquoise sea behind and lifting palm-tufted coral islets in the\nturquoise sea ahead.  Swift as thought the pictures came and went.  One\ninstant he was astride a broncho and flying through the fairy-colored\nPainted Desert country; the next instant he was gazing down through\nshimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of Death Valley, or pulling an\noar on a freezing ocean where great ice islands towered and glistened in\nthe sun.  He lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the\nmellow-sounding surf.  The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue\nfires, in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love-\ncalls of the singers, who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom-\ntoms.  It was a sensuous, tropic night.  In the background a volcano\ncrater was silhouetted against the stars.  Overhead drifted a pale\ncrescent moon, and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.\n\nHe was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his consciousness\nwas the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that poured against\nthose strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams.  He did\nnot merely feel.  Sensation invested itself in form and color and\nradiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in some\nsublimated and magic way.  Past, present, and future mingled; and he went\non oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high adventure and\nnoble deeds to Her--ay, and with her, winning her, his arm about her, and\ncarrying her on in flight through the empery of his mind.\n\nAnd she, glancing at him across her shoulder, saw something of all this\nin his face.  It was a transfigured face, with great shining eyes that\ngazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of\nlife and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit.  She was startled.  The\nraw, stumbling lout was gone.  The ill-fitting clothes, battered hands,\nand sunburned face remained; but these seemed the prison-bars through\nwhich she saw a great soul looking forth, inarticulate and dumb because\nof those feeble lips that would not give it speech.  Only for a flashing\nmoment did she see this, then she saw the lout returned, and she laughed\nat the whim of her fancy.  But the impression of that fleeting glimpse\nlingered, and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling retreat and\ngo, she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and another of Browning--she\nwas studying Browning in one of her English courses.  He seemed such a\nboy, as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks, that a wave of pity,\nmaternal in its prompting, welled up in her.  She did not remember the\nlout, nor the imprisoned soul, nor the man who had stared at her in all\nmasculineness and delighted and frightened her.  She saw before her only\na boy, who was shaking her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt\nlike a nutmeg-grater and rasped her skin, and who was saying jerkily:-\n\n\"The greatest time of my life.  You see, I ain't used to things. . . \"  He\nlooked about him helplessly.  \"To people and houses like this.  It's all\nnew to me, and I like it.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll call again,\" she said, as he was saying good night to her\nbrothers.\n\nHe pulled on his cap, lurched desperately through the doorway, and was\ngone.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of him?\" Arthur demanded.\n\n\"He is most interesting, a whiff of ozone,\" she answered.  \"How old is\nhe?\"\n\n\"Twenty--almost twenty-one.  I asked him this afternoon.  I didn't think\nhe was that young.\"\n\nAnd I am three years older, was the thought in her mind as she kissed her\nbrothers goodnight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nAs Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat\npocket.  It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican\ntobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette.  He drew the\nfirst whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and\nlingering exhalation.  \"By God!\" he said aloud, in a voice of awe and\nwonder.  \"By God!\" he repeated.  And yet again he murmured, \"By God!\"\nThen his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and\nstuffed into his pocket.  A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his\nhead to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern.\nHe was only dimly aware that it was raining.  He was in an ecstasy,\ndreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.\n\nHe had met the woman at last--the woman that he had thought little about,\nnot being given to thinking about women, but whom he had expected, in a\nremote way, he would sometime meet.  He had sat next to her at table.  He\nhad felt her hand in his, he had looked into her eyes and caught a vision\nof a beautiful spirit;--but no more beautiful than the eyes through which\nit shone, nor than the flesh that gave it expression and form.  He did\nnot think of her flesh as flesh,--which was new to him; for of the women\nhe had known that was the only way he thought.  Her flesh was somehow\ndifferent.  He did not conceive of her body as a body, subject to the\nills and frailties of bodies.  Her body was more than the garb of her\nspirit.  It was an emanation of her spirit, a pure and gracious\ncrystallization of her divine essence.  This feeling of the divine\nstartled him.  It shocked him from his dreams to sober thought.  No word,\nno clew, no hint, of the divine had ever reached him before.  He had\nnever believed in the divine.  He had always been irreligious, scoffing\ngood-naturedly at the sky-pilots and their immortality of the soul.  There\nwas no life beyond, he had contended; it was here and now, then darkness\neverlasting.  But what he had seen in her eyes was soul--immortal soul\nthat could never die.  No man he had known, nor any woman, had given him\nthe message of immortality.  But she had.  She had whispered it to him\nthe first moment she looked at him.  Her face shimmered before his eyes\nas he walked along,--pale and serious, sweet and sensitive, smiling with\npity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile, and pure as he had\nnever dreamed purity could be.  Her purity smote him like a blow.  It\nstartled him.  He had known good and bad; but purity, as an attribute of\nexistence, had never entered his mind.  And now, in her, he conceived\npurity to be the superlative of goodness and of cleanness, the sum of\nwhich constituted eternal life.\n\nAnd promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life.  He was not fit\nto carry water for her--he knew that; it was a miracle of luck and a\nfantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and talk\nwith her that night.  It was accidental.  There was no merit in it.  He\ndid not deserve such fortune.  His mood was essentially religious.  He\nwas humble and meek, filled with self-disparagement and abasement.  In\nsuch frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form.  He was convicted\nof sin.  But as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid\nglimpses of their future lordly existence, so did he catch similar\nglimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her.  But this\npossession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from\npossession as he had known it.  Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw\nhimself climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her,\npleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her.  It was a\nsoul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free\ncomradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought.  He\ndid not think it.  For that matter, he did not think at all.  Sensation\nusurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had\nnever known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling\nitself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of\nlife.\n\nHe staggered along like a drunken man, murmuring fervently aloud: \"By\nGod!  By God!\"\n\nA policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously, then noted his\nsailor roll.\n\n\"Where did you get it?\" the policeman demanded.\n\nMartin Eden came back to earth.  His was a fluid organism, swiftly\nadjustable, capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and\ncrannies.  With the policeman's hail he was immediately his ordinary\nself, grasping the situation clearly.\n\n\"It's a beaut, ain't it?\" he laughed back.  \"I didn't know I was talkin'\nout loud.\"\n\n\"You'll be singing next,\" was the policeman's diagnosis.\n\n\"No, I won't.  Gimme a match an' I'll catch the next car home.\"\n\nHe lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on.  \"Now wouldn't\nthat rattle you?\" he ejaculated under his breath.  \"That copper thought I\nwas drunk.\"  He smiled to himself and meditated.  \"I guess I was,\" he\nadded; \"but I didn't think a woman's face'd do it.\"\n\nHe caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley.  It was\ncrowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and\nagain barking out college yells.  He studied them curiously.  They were\nuniversity boys.  They went to the same university that she did, were in\nher class socially, could know her, could see her every day if they\nwanted to.  He wondered that they did not want to, that they had been out\nhaving a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking with\nher, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle.  His thoughts\nwandered on.  He noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a loose-lipped\nmouth.  That fellow was vicious, he decided.  On shipboard he would be a\nsneak, a whiner, a tattler.  He, Martin Eden, was a better man than that\nfellow.  The thought cheered him.  It seemed to draw him nearer to Her.\nHe began comparing himself with the students.  He grew conscious of the\nmuscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was physically\ntheir master.  But their heads were filled with knowledge that enabled\nthem to talk her talk,--the thought depressed him.  But what was a brain\nfor? he demanded passionately.  What they had done, he could do.  They\nhad been studying about life from the books while he had been busy living\nlife.  His brain was just as full of knowledge as theirs, though it was a\ndifferent kind of knowledge.  How many of them could tie a lanyard knot,\nor take a wheel or a lookout?  His life spread out before him in a series\nof pictures of danger and daring, hardship and toil.  He remembered his\nfailures and scrapes in the process of learning.  He was that much to the\ngood, anyway.  Later on they would have to begin living life and going\nthrough the mill as he had gone.  Very well.  While they were busy with\nthat, he could be learning the other side of life from the books.\n\nAs the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated Oakland\nfrom Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story building along\nthe front of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM'S CASH STORE.  Martin\nEden got off at this corner.  He stared up for a moment at the sign.  It\ncarried a message to him beyond its mere wording.  A personality of\nsmallness and egotism and petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from\nthe letters themselves.  Bernard Higginbotham had married his sister, and\nhe knew him well.  He let himself in with a latch-key and climbed the\nstairs to the second floor.  Here lived his brother-in-law.  The grocery\nwas below.  There was a smell of stale vegetables in the air.  As he\ngroped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy-cart, left there by\none of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door\nwith a resounding bang.  \"The pincher,\" was his thought; \"too miserly to\nburn two cents' worth of gas and save his boarders' necks.\"\n\nHe fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his sister\nand Bernard Higginbotham.  She was patching a pair of his trousers, while\nhis lean body was distributed over two chairs, his feet dangling in\ndilapidated carpet-slippers over the edge of the second chair.  He\nglanced across the top of the paper he was reading, showing a pair of\ndark, insincere, sharp-staring eyes.  Martin Eden never looked at him\nwithout experiencing a sense of repulsion.  What his sister had seen in\nthe man was beyond him.  The other affected him as so much vermin, and\nalways aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his foot.  \"Some day\nI'll beat the face off of him,\" was the way he often consoled himself for\nenduring the man's existence.  The eyes, weasel-like and cruel, were\nlooking at him complainingly.\n\n\"Well,\" Martin demanded.  \"Out with it.\"\n\n\"I had that door painted only last week,\" Mr. Higginbotham half whined,\nhalf bullied; \"and you know what union wages are.  You should be more\ncareful.\"\n\nMartin had intended to reply, but he was struck by the hopelessness of\nit.  He gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the\nwall.  It surprised him.  He had always liked it, but it seemed that now\nhe was seeing it for the first time.  It was cheap, that was what it was,\nlike everything else in this house.  His mind went back to the house he\nhad just left, and he saw, first, the paintings, and next, Her, looking\nat him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at leaving.  He\nforgot where he was and Bernard Higginbotham's existence, till that\ngentleman demanded:-\n\n\"Seen a ghost?\"\n\nMartin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent,\ncowardly, and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same eyes\nwhen their owner was making a sale in the store below--subservient eyes,\nsmug, and oily, and flattering.\n\n\"Yes,\" Martin answered.  \"I seen a ghost.  Good night.  Good night,\nGertrude.\"\n\nHe started to leave the room, tripping over a loose seam in the\nslatternly carpet.\n\n\"Don't bang the door,\" Mr. Higginbotham cautioned him.\n\nHe felt the blood crawl in his veins, but controlled himself and closed\nthe door softly behind him.\n\nMr. Higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly.\n\n\"He's ben drinkin',\" he proclaimed in a hoarse whisper.  \"I told you he\nwould.\"\n\nShe nodded her head resignedly.\n\n\"His eyes was pretty shiny,\" she confessed; \"and he didn't have no\ncollar, though he went away with one.  But mebbe he didn't have more'n a\ncouple of glasses.\"\n\n\"He couldn't stand up straight,\" asserted her husband.  \"I watched him.\nHe couldn't walk across the floor without stumblin'.  You heard 'm\nyourself almost fall down in the hall.\"\n\n\"I think it was over Alice's cart,\" she said.  \"He couldn't see it in the\ndark.\"\n\nMr. Higginbotham's voice and wrath began to rise.  All day he effaced\nhimself in the store, reserving for the evening, with his family, the\nprivilege of being himself.\n\n\"I tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk.\"\n\nHis voice was cold, sharp, and final, his lips stamping the enunciation\nof each word like the die of a machine.  His wife sighed and remained\nsilent.  She was a large, stout woman, always dressed slatternly and\nalways tired from the burdens of her flesh, her work, and her husband.\n\n\"He's got it in him, I tell you, from his father,\" Mr. Higginbotham went\non accusingly.  \"An' he'll croak in the gutter the same way.  You know\nthat.\"\n\nShe nodded, sighed, and went on stitching.  They were agreed that Martin\nhad come home drunk.  They did not have it in their souls to know beauty,\nor they would have known that those shining eyes and that glowing face\nbetokened youth's first vision of love.\n\n\"Settin' a fine example to the children,\" Mr. Higginbotham snorted,\nsuddenly, in the silence for which his wife was responsible and which he\nresented.  Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more.  \"If he\ndoes it again, he's got to get out.  Understand!  I won't put up with his\nshinanigan--debotchin' innocent children with his boozing.\"  Mr.\nHigginbotham liked the word, which was a new one in his vocabulary,\nrecently gleaned from a newspaper column.  \"That's what it is,\ndebotchin'--there ain't no other name for it.\"\n\nStill his wife sighed, shook her head sorrowfully, and stitched on.  Mr.\nHigginbotham resumed the newspaper.\n\n\"Has he paid last week's board?\" he shot across the top of the newspaper.\n\nShe nodded, then added, \"He still has some money.\"\n\n\"When is he goin' to sea again?\"\n\n\"When his pay-day's spent, I guess,\" she answered.  \"He was over to San\nFrancisco yesterday looking for a ship.  But he's got money, yet, an'\nhe's particular about the kind of ship he signs for.\"\n\n\"It's not for a deck-swab like him to put on airs,\" Mr. Higginbotham\nsnorted.  \"Particular!  Him!\"\n\n\"He said something about a schooner that's gettin' ready to go off to\nsome outlandish place to look for buried treasure, that he'd sail on her\nif his money held out.\"\n\n\"If he only wanted to steady down, I'd give him a job drivin' the wagon,\"\nher husband said, but with no trace of benevolence in his voice.  \"Tom's\nquit.\"\n\nHis wife looked alarm and interrogation.\n\n\"Quit to-night.  Is goin' to work for Carruthers.  They paid 'm more'n I\ncould afford.\"\n\n\"I told you you'd lose 'm,\" she cried out.  \"He was worth more'n you was\ngiving him.\"\n\n\"Now look here, old woman,\" Higginbotham bullied, \"for the thousandth\ntime I've told you to keep your nose out of the business.  I won't tell\nyou again.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" she sniffled.  \"Tom was a good boy.\"  Her husband glared\nat her.  This was unqualified defiance.\n\n\"If that brother of yours was worth his salt, he could take the wagon,\"\nhe snorted.\n\n\"He pays his board, just the same,\" was the retort.  \"An' he's my\nbrother, an' so long as he don't owe you money you've got no right to be\njumping on him all the time.  I've got some feelings, if I have been\nmarried to you for seven years.\"\n\n\"Did you tell 'm you'd charge him for gas if he goes on readin' in bed?\"\nhe demanded.\n\nMrs. Higginbotham made no reply.  Her revolt faded away, her spirit\nwilting down into her tired flesh.  Her husband was triumphant.  He had\nher.  His eyes snapped vindictively, while his ears joyed in the sniffles\nshe emitted.  He extracted great happiness from squelching her, and she\nsquelched easily these days, though it had been different in the first\nyears of their married life, before the brood of children and his\nincessant nagging had sapped her energy.\n\n\"Well, you tell 'm to-morrow, that's all,\" he said.  \"An' I just want to\ntell you, before I forget it, that you'd better send for Marian to-morrow\nto take care of the children.  With Tom quit, I'll have to be out on the\nwagon, an' you can make up your mind to it to be down below waitin' on\nthe counter.\"\n\n\"But to-morrow's wash day,\" she objected weakly.\n\n\"Get up early, then, an' do it first.  I won't start out till ten\no'clock.\"\n\nHe crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nMartin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his brother-in-\nlaw, felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room, a\ntiny cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash-stand, and one chair.  Mr.\nHigginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife could do the\nwork.  Besides, the servant's room enabled them to take in two boarders\ninstead of one.  Martin placed the Swinburne and Browning on the chair,\ntook off his coat, and sat down on the bed.  A screeching of asthmatic\nsprings greeted the weight of his body, but he did not notice them.  He\nstarted to take off his shoes, but fell to staring at the white plaster\nwall opposite him, broken by long streaks of dirty brown where rain had\nleaked through the roof.  On this befouled background visions began to\nflow and burn.  He forgot his shoes and stared long, till his lips began\nto move and he murmured, \"Ruth.\"\n\n\"Ruth.\"  He had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful.  It\ndelighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it.\n\"Ruth.\"  It was a talisman, a magic word to conjure with.  Each time he\nmurmured it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall with\na golden radiance.  This radiance did not stop at the wall.  It extended\non into infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went questing\nafter hers.  The best that was in him was out in splendid flood.  The\nvery thought of her ennobled and purified him, made him better, and made\nhim want to be better.  This was new to him.  He had never known women\nwho had made him better.  They had always had the counter effect of\nmaking him beastly.  He did not know that many of them had done their\nbest, bad as it was.  Never having been conscious of himself, he did not\nknow that he had that in his being that drew love from women and which\nhad been the cause of their reaching out for his youth.  Though they had\noften bothered him, he had never bothered about them; and he would never\nhave dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him.\nAlways in sublime carelessness had he lived, till now, and now it seemed\nto him that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile\nhands.  This was not just to them, nor to himself.  But he, who for the\nfirst time was becoming conscious of himself, was in no condition to\njudge, and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy.\n\nHe got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass\nover the wash-stand.  He passed a towel over it and looked again, long\nand carefully.  It was the first time he had ever really seen himself.\nHis eyes were made for seeing, but up to that moment they had been filled\nwith the ever changing panorama of the world, at which he had been too\nbusy gazing, ever to gaze at himself.  He saw the head and face of a\nyoung fellow of twenty, but, being unused to such appraisement, he did\nnot know how to value it.  Above a square-domed forehead he saw a mop of\nbrown hair, nut-brown, with a wave to it and hints of curls that were a\ndelight to any woman, making hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle\nto pass caresses through it.  But he passed it by as without merit, in\nHer eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high, square\nforehead,--striving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its content.\nWhat kind of a brain lay behind there? was his insistent interrogation.\nWhat was it capable of?  How far would it take him?  Would it take him to\nher?\n\nHe wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were often\nquite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the sun-\nwashed deep.  He wondered, also, how his eyes looked to her.  He tried to\nimagine himself she, gazing into those eyes of his, but failed in the\njugglery.  He could successfully put himself inside other men's minds,\nbut they had to be men whose ways of life he knew.  He did not know her\nway of life.  She was wonder and mystery, and how could he guess one\nthought of hers?  Well, they were honest eyes, he concluded, and in them\nwas neither smallness nor meanness.  The brown sunburn of his face\nsurprised him.  He had not dreamed he was so black.  He rolled up his\nshirt-sleeve and compared the white underside if the arm with his face.\nYes, he was a white man, after all.  But the arms were sunburned, too.  He\ntwisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his other hand, and gazed\nunderneath where he was least touched by the sun.  It was very white.  He\nlaughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the thought that it was once\nas white as the underside of his arm; nor did he dream that in the world\nthere were few pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother\nskins than he--fairer than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun.\n\nHis might have been a cherub's mouth, had not the full, sensuous lips a\ntrick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth.  At times, so\ntightly did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh, even ascetic.\nThey were the lips of a fighter and of a lover.  They could taste the\nsweetness of life with relish, and they could put the sweetness aside and\ncommand life.  The chin and jaw, strong and just hinting of square\naggressiveness, helped the lips to command life.  Strength balanced\nsensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect, compelling him to love\nbeauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were\nwholesome.  And between the lips were teeth that had never known nor\nneeded the dentist's care.  They were white and strong and regular, he\ndecided, as he looked at them.  But as he looked, he began to be\ntroubled.  Somewhere, stored away in the recesses of his mind and vaguely\nremembered, was the impression that there were people who washed their\nteeth every day.  They were the people from up above--people in her\nclass.  She must wash her teeth every day, too.  What would she think if\nshe learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days of his\nlife?  He resolved to get a tooth-brush and form the habit.  He would\nbegin at once, to-morrow.  It was not by mere achievement that he could\nhope to win to her.  He must make a personal reform in all things, even\nto tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched collar affected him as\na renunciation of freedom.\n\nHe held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused\npalm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and\nwhich no brush could scrub away.  How different was her palm!  He\nthrilled deliciously at the remembrance.  Like a rose-petal, he thought;\ncool and soft as a snowflake.  He had never thought that a mere woman's\nhand could be so sweetly soft.  He caught himself imagining the wonder of\na caress from such a hand, and flushed guiltily.  It was too gross a\nthought for her.  In ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality.  She\nwas a pale, slender spirit, exalted far beyond the flesh; but\nnevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts.  He was\nused to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women.  Well\nhe knew why their hands were rough; but this hand of hers . . . It was\nsoft because she had never used it to work with.  The gulf yawned between\nher and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work\nfor a living.  He suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who did not\nlabor.  It towered before him on the wall, a figure in brass, arrogant\nand powerful.  He had worked himself; his first memories seemed connected\nwith work, and all his family had worked.  There was Gertrude.  When her\nhands were not hard from the endless housework, they were swollen and red\nlike boiled beef, what of the washing.  And there was his sister Marian.\nShe had worked in the cannery the preceding summer, and her slim, pretty\nhands were all scarred with the tomato-knives.  Besides, the tips of two\nof her fingers had been left in the cutting machine at the paper-box\nfactory the preceding winter.  He remembered the hard palms of his mother\nas she lay in her coffin.  And his father had worked to the last fading\ngasp; the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick\nwhen he died.  But Her hands were soft, and her mother's hands, and her\nbrothers'.  This last came to him as a surprise; it was tremendously\nindicative of the highness of their caste, of the enormous distance that\nstretched between her and him.\n\nHe sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his\nshoes.  He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman's face and by\na woman's soft, white hands.  And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on the\nfoul plaster-wall appeared a vision.  He stood in front of a gloomy\ntenement house.  It was night-time, in the East End of London, and before\nhim stood Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen.  He had seen her home\nafter the bean-feast.  She lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit\nfor swine.  His hand was going out to hers as he said good night.  She\nhad put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasn't going to kiss her.\nSomehow he was afraid of her.  And then her hand closed on his and\npressed feverishly.  He felt her callouses grind and grate on his, and a\ngreat wave of pity welled over him.  He saw her yearning, hungry eyes,\nand her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a\nfrightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about her in\nlarge tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips.  Her glad little\ncry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a cat.  Poor\nlittle starveling!  He continued to stare at the vision of what had\nhappened in the long ago.  His flesh was crawling as it had crawled that\nnight when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with pity.  It was a\ngray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement\nstones.  And then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and up through the\nother vision, displacing it, glimmered Her pale face under its crown of\ngolden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.\n\nHe took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them.\nJust the same, she told me to call again, he thought.  He took another\nlook at himself in the glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:-\n\n\"Martin Eden, the first thing to-morrow you go to the free library an'\nread up on etiquette.  Understand!\"\n\nHe turned off the gas, and the springs shrieked under his body.\n\n\"But you've got to quit cussin', Martin, old boy; you've got to quit\ncussin',\" he said aloud.\n\nThen he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and\naudacity rivalled those of poppy-eaters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nHe awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere\nthat smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes, and that was vibrant with the\njar and jangle of tormented life.  As he came out of his room he heard\nthe slosh of water, a sharp exclamation, and a resounding smack as his\nsister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny.  The\nsquall of the child went through him like a knife.  He was aware that the\nwhole thing, the very air he breathed, was repulsive and mean.  How\ndifferent, he thought, from the atmosphere of beauty and repose of the\nhouse wherein Ruth dwelt.  There it was all spiritual.  Here it was all\nmaterial, and meanly material.\n\n\"Come here, Alfred,\" he called to the crying child, at the same time\nthrusting his hand into his trousers pocket, where he carried his money\nloose in the same large way that he lived life in general.  He put a\nquarter in the youngster's hand and held him in his arms a moment,\nsoothing his sobs.  \"Now run along and get some candy, and don't forget\nto give some to your brothers and sisters.  Be sure and get the kind that\nlasts longest.\"\n\nHis sister lifted a flushed face from the wash-tub and looked at him.\n\n\"A nickel'd ha' ben enough,\" she said.  \"It's just like you, no idea of\nthe value of money.  The child'll eat himself sick.\"\n\n\"That's all right, sis,\" he answered jovially.  \"My money'll take care of\nitself.  If you weren't so busy, I'd kiss you good morning.\"\n\nHe wanted to be affectionate to this sister, who was good, and who, in\nher way, he knew, loved him.  But, somehow, she grew less herself as the\nyears went by, and more and more baffling.  It was the hard work, the\nmany children, and the nagging of her husband, he decided, that had\nchanged her.  It came to him, in a flash of fancy, that her nature seemed\ntaking on the attributes of stale vegetables, smelly soapsuds, and of the\ngreasy dimes, nickels, and quarters she took in over the counter of the\nstore.\n\n\"Go along an' get your breakfast,\" she said roughly, though secretly\npleased.  Of all her wandering brood of brothers he had always been her\nfavorite.  \"I declare I _will_ kiss you,\" she said, with a sudden stir at\nher heart.\n\nWith thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from one arm\nand then from the other.  He put his arms round her massive waist and\nkissed her wet steamy lips. The tears welled into her eyes--not so much\nfrom strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork.  She\nshoved him away from her, but not before he caught a glimpse of her moist\neyes.\n\n\"You'll find breakfast in the oven,\" she said hurriedly.  \"Jim ought to\nbe up now.  I had to get up early for the washing.  Now get along with\nyou and get out of the house early.  It won't be nice to-day, what of Tom\nquittin' an' nobody but Bernard to drive the wagon.\"\n\nMartin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart, the image of her red\nface and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain.  She\nmight love him if she only had some time, he concluded.  But she was\nworked to death.  Bernard Higginbotham was a brute to work her so hard.\nBut he could not help but feel, on the other hand, that there had not\nbeen anything beautiful in that kiss.  It was true, it was an unusual\nkiss.  For years she had kissed him only when he returned from voyages or\ndeparted on voyages. But this kiss had tasted soapsuds, and the lips, he\nhad noticed, were flabby.  There had been no quick, vigorous lip-pressure\nsuch as should accompany any kiss.  Hers was the kiss of a tired woman\nwho had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to kiss.  He\nremembered her as a girl, before her marriage, when she would dance with\nthe best, all night, after a hard day's work at the laundry, and think\nnothing of leaving the dance to go to another day's hard work.  And then\nhe thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as\nit resided in all about her.  Her kiss would be like her hand-shake or\nthe way she looked at one, firm and frank.  In imagination he dared to\nthink of her lips on his, and so vividly did he imagine that he went\ndizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through clouds of rose-petals,\nfilling his brain with their perfume.\n\nIn the kitchen he found Jim, the other boarder, eating mush very\nlanguidly, with a sick, far-away look in his eyes.  Jim was a plumber's\napprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament, coupled with a\ncertain nervous stupidity, promised to take him nowhere in the race for\nbread and butter.\n\n\"Why don't you eat?\" he demanded, as Martin dipped dolefully into the\ncold, half-cooked oatmeal mush.  \"Was you drunk again last night?\"\n\nMartin shook his head.  He was oppressed by the utter squalidness of it\nall.  Ruth Morse seemed farther removed than ever.\n\n\"I was,\" Jim went on with a boastful, nervous giggle.  \"I was loaded\nright to the neck.  Oh, she was a daisy.  Billy brought me home.\"\n\nMartin nodded that he heard,--it was a habit of nature with him to pay\nheed to whoever talked to him,--and poured a cup of lukewarm coffee.\n\n\"Goin' to the Lotus Club dance to-night?\" Jim demanded.  \"They're goin'\nto have beer, an' if that Temescal bunch comes, there'll be a\nrough-house.  I don't care, though.  I'm takin' my lady friend just the\nsame.  Cripes, but I've got a taste in my mouth!\"\n\nHe made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee.\n\n\"D'ye know Julia?\"\n\nMartin shook his head.\n\n\"She's my lady friend,\" Jim explained, \"and she's a peach.  I'd introduce\nyou to her, only you'd win her.  I don't see what the girls see in you,\nhonest I don't; but the way you win them away from the fellers is\nsickenin'.\"\n\n\"I never got any away from you,\" Martin answered uninterestedly.  The\nbreakfast had to be got through somehow.\n\n\"Yes, you did, too,\" the other asserted warmly.  \"There was Maggie.\"\n\n\"Never had anything to do with her.  Never danced with her except that\none night.\"\n\n\"Yes, an' that's just what did it,\" Jim cried out.  \"You just danced with\nher an' looked at her, an' it was all off.  Of course you didn't mean\nnothin' by it, but it settled me for keeps.  Wouldn't look at me again.\nAlways askin' about you.  She'd have made fast dates enough with you if\nyou'd wanted to.\"\n\n\"But I didn't want to.\"\n\n\"Wasn't necessary.  I was left at the pole.\"  Jim looked at him\nadmiringly.  \"How d'ye do it, anyway, Mart?\"\n\n\"By not carin' about 'em,\" was the answer.\n\n\"You mean makin' b'lieve you don't care about them?\" Jim queried eagerly.\n\nMartin considered for a moment, then answered, \"Perhaps that will do, but\nwith me I guess it's different.  I never have cared--much.  If you can\nput it on, it's all right, most likely.\"\n\n\"You should 'a' ben up at Riley's barn last night,\" Jim announced\ninconsequently.  \"A lot of the fellers put on the gloves.  There was a\npeach from West Oakland.  They called 'm 'The Rat.'  Slick as silk.  No\none could touch 'm.  We was all wishin' you was there.  Where was you\nanyway?\"\n\n\"Down in Oakland,\" Martin replied.\n\n\"To the show?\"\n\nMartin shoved his plate away and got up.\n\n\"Comin' to the dance to-night?\" the other called after him.\n\n\"No, I think not,\" he answered.\n\nHe went downstairs and out into the street, breathing great breaths of\nair.  He had been suffocating in that atmosphere, while the apprentice's\nchatter had driven him frantic.  There had been times when it was all he\ncould do to refrain from reaching over and mopping Jim's face in the mush-\nplate.  The more he had chattered, the more remote had Ruth seemed to\nhim.  How could he, herding with such cattle, ever become worthy of her?\nHe was appalled at the problem confronting him, weighted down by the\nincubus of his working-class station.  Everything reached out to hold him\ndown--his sister, his sister's house and family, Jim the apprentice,\neverybody he knew, every tie of life.  Existence did not taste good in\nhis mouth.  Up to then he had accepted existence, as he had lived it with\nall about him, as a good thing.  He had never questioned it, except when\nhe read books; but then, they were only books, fairy stories of a fairer\nand impossible world.  But now he had seen that world, possible and real,\nwith a flower of a woman called Ruth in the midmost centre of it; and\nthenceforth he must know bitter tastes, and longings sharp as pain, and\nhopelessness that tantalized because it fed on hope.\n\nHe had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland Free\nLibrary, and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland.  Who\ncould tell?--a library was a most likely place for her, and he might see\nher there.  He did not know the way of libraries, and he wandered through\nendless rows of fiction, till the delicate-featured French-looking girl\nwho seemed in charge, told him that the reference department was\nupstairs.  He did not know enough to ask the man at the desk, and began\nhis adventures in the philosophy alcove.  He had heard of book\nphilosophy, but had not imagined there had been so much written about it.\nThe high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at the same time\nstimulated him.  Here was work for the vigor of his brain.  He found\nbooks on trigonometry in the mathematics section, and ran the pages, and\nstared at the meaningless formulas and figures.  He could read English,\nbut he saw there an alien speech.  Norman and Arthur knew that speech.  He\nhad heard them talking it.  And they were her brothers.  He left the\nalcove in despair.  From every side the books seemed to press upon him\nand crush him.\n\nHe had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big.  He\nwas frightened.  How could his brain ever master it all?  Later, he\nremembered that there were other men, many men, who had mastered it; and\nhe breathed a great oath, passionately, under his breath, swearing that\nhis brain could do what theirs had done.\n\nAnd so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he\nstared at the shelves packed with wisdom.  In one miscellaneous section\nhe came upon a \"Norrie's Epitome.\"  He turned the pages reverently.  In a\nway, it spoke a kindred speech.  Both he and it were of the sea.  Then he\nfound a \"Bowditch\" and books by Lecky and Marshall.  There it was; he\nwould teach himself navigation.  He would quit drinking, work up, and\nbecome a captain.  Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment.  As a\ncaptain, he could marry her (if she would have him).  And if she\nwouldn't, well--he would live a good life among men, because of Her, and\nhe would quit drinking anyway.  Then he remembered the underwriters and\nthe owners, the two masters a captain must serve, either of which could\nand would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed.  He\ncast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten\nthousand books.  No; no more of the sea for him.  There was power in all\nthat wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do them on\nthe land.  Besides, captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea\nwith them.\n\nNoon came, and afternoon.  He forgot to eat, and sought on for the books\non etiquette; for, in addition to career, his mind was vexed by a simple\nand very concrete problem: _When you meet a young lady and she asks you\nto call, how soon can you call_? was the way he worded it to himself.  But\nwhen he found the right shelf, he sought vainly for the answer.  He was\nappalled at the vast edifice of etiquette, and lost himself in the mazes\nof visiting-card conduct between persons in polite society.  He abandoned\nhis search.  He had not found what he wanted, though he had found that it\nwould take all of a man's time to be polite, and that he would have to\nlive a preliminary life in which to learn how to be polite.\n\n\"Did you find what you wanted?\" the man at the desk asked him as he was\nleaving.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered.  \"You have a fine library here.\"\n\nThe man nodded.  \"We should be glad to see you here often.  Are you a\nsailor?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered.  \"And I'll come again.\"\n\nNow, how did he know that? he asked himself as he went down the stairs.\n\nAnd for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and\nstraight and awkwardly, until he forgot himself in his thoughts,\nwhereupon his rolling gait gracefully returned to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nA terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.  He\nwas famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped his\nlife with a giant's grasp.  He could not steel himself to call upon her.\nHe was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an awful\nbreach of that awful thing called etiquette.  He spent long hours in the\nOakland and Berkeley libraries, and made out application blanks for\nmembership for himself, his sisters Gertrude and Marian, and Jim, the\nlatter's consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses of\nbeer.  With four cards permitting him to draw books, he burned the gas\nlate in the servant's room, and was charged fifty cents a week for it by\nMr. Higginbotham.\n\nThe many books he read but served to whet his unrest.  Every page of\nevery book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge.  His hunger fed\nupon what he read, and increased.  Also, he did not know where to begin,\nand continually suffered from lack of preparation.  The commonest\nreferences, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know,\nhe did not know.  And the same was true of the poetry he read which\nmaddened him with delight.  He read more of Swinburne than was contained\nin the volume Ruth had lent him; and \"Dolores\" he understood thoroughly.\nBut surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded.  How could she,\nliving the refined life she did?  Then he chanced upon Kipling's poems,\nand was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour with which familiar\nthings had been invested.  He was amazed at the man's sympathy with life\nand at his incisive psychology.  Psychology was a new word in Martin's\nvocabulary.  He had bought a dictionary, which deed had decreased his\nsupply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail in\nsearch of more.  Also, it incensed Mr. Higginbotham, who would have\npreferred the money taking the form of board.\n\nHe dared not go near Ruth's neighborhood in the daytime, but night found\nhim lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing glimpses at the\nwindows and loving the very walls that sheltered her.  Several times he\nbarely escaped being caught by her brothers, and once he trailed Mr.\nMorse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets, longing all\nthe while for some quick danger of death to threaten so that he might\nspring in and save her father.  On another night, his vigil was rewarded\nby a glimpse of Ruth through a second-story window.  He saw only her head\nand shoulders, and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror.\nIt was only for a moment, but it was a long moment to him, during which\nhis blood turned to wine and sang through his veins.  Then she pulled\ndown the shade.  But it was her room--he had learned that; and thereafter\nhe strayed there often, hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of\nthe street and smoking countless cigarettes.  One afternoon he saw her\nmother coming out of a bank, and received another proof of the enormous\ndistance that separated Ruth from him.  She was of the class that dealt\nwith banks.  He had never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an\nidea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the\nvery powerful.\n\nIn one way, he had undergone a moral revolution.  Her cleanness and\npurity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to be\nclean.  He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the\nsame air with her.  He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a\nkitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store window and\ndivined its use.  While purchasing it, the clerk glanced at his nails,\nsuggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an additional toilet-\ntool.  He ran across a book in the library on the care of the body, and\npromptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath every morning, much\nto the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr. Higginbotham, who\nwas not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions and who seriously\ndebated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water.\nAnother stride was in the direction of creased trousers.  Now that Martin\nwas aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the difference between the\nbaggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight\nline from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class.\nAlso, he learned the reason why, and invaded his sister's kitchen in\nsearch of irons and ironing-board.  He had misadventures at first,\nhopelessly burning one pair and buying another, which expenditure again\nbrought nearer the day on which he must put to sea.\n\nBut the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance.  He still\nsmoked, but he drank no more.  Up to that time, drinking had seemed to\nhim the proper thing for men to do, and he had prided himself on his\nstrong head which enabled him to drink most men under the table.  Whenever\nhe encountered a chance shipmate, and there were many in San Francisco,\nhe treated them and was treated in turn, as of old, but he ordered for\nhimself root beer or ginger ale and good-naturedly endured their\nchaffing.  And as they waxed maudlin he studied them, watching the beast\nrise and master them and thanking God that he was no longer as they.  They\nhad their limitations to forget, and when they were drunk, their dim,\nstupid spirits were even as gods, and each ruled in his heaven of\nintoxicated desire.  With Martin the need for strong drink had vanished.\nHe was drunken in new and more profound ways--with Ruth, who had fired\nhim with love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life; with books,\nthat had set a myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his brain; and with\nthe sense of personal cleanliness he was achieving, that gave him even\nmore superb health than what he had enjoyed and that made his whole body\nsing with physical well-being.\n\nOne night he went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might see\nher there, and from the second balcony he did see her.  He saw her come\ndown the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop\nof hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant\napprehension and jealousy.  He saw her take her seat in the orchestra\ncircle, and little else than her did he see that night--a pair of slender\nwhite shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with distance.  But\nthere were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at those about\nhim, he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front, a\ndozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes.  He had always\nbeen easy-going.  It was not in his nature to give rebuff.  In the old\ndays he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling.\nBut now it was different.  He did smile back, then looked away, and\nlooked no more deliberately.  But several times, forgetting the existence\nof the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles.  He could not re-thumb\nhimself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his\nnature; so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls in warm human\nfriendliness.  It was nothing new to him.  He knew they were reaching out\ntheir woman's hands to him.  But it was different now.  Far down there in\nthe orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world, so different, so\nterrifically different, from these two girls of his class, that he could\nfeel for them only pity and sorrow.  He had it in his heart to wish that\nthey could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory.  And\nnot for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching.  He\nwas not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness\nthat permitted it.  He knew, did he belong in Ruth's class, that there\nwould be no overtures from these girls; and with each glance of theirs he\nfelt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down.\n\nHe left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent on\nseeing Her as she passed out.  There were always numbers of men who stood\non the sidewalk outside, and he could pull his cap down over his eyes and\nscreen himself behind some one's shoulder so that she should not see him.\nHe emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd; but scarcely had\nhe taken his position on the edge of the sidewalk when the two girls\nappeared.  They were looking for him, he knew; and for the moment he\ncould have cursed that in him which drew women.  Their casual edging\nacross the sidewalk to the curb, as they drew near, apprised him of\ndiscovery.  They slowed down, and were in the thick of the crown as they\ncame up with him.  One of them brushed against him and apparently for the\nfirst time noticed him.  She was a slender, dark girl, with black,\ndefiant eyes.  But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said.\n\nIt was automatic; he had said it so often before under similar\ncircumstances of first meetings.  Besides, he could do no less.  There\nwas that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit him\nto do no less.  The black-eyed girl smiled gratification and greeting,\nand showed signs of stopping, while her companion, arm linked in arm,\ngiggled and likewise showed signs of halting.  He thought quickly.  It\nwould never do for Her to come out and see him talking there with them.\nQuite naturally, as a matter of course, he swung in along-side the dark-\neyed one and walked with her.  There was no awkwardness on his part, no\nnumb tongue.  He was at home here, and he held his own royally in the\nbadinage, bristling with slang and sharpness, that was always the\npreliminary to getting acquainted in these swift-moving affairs.  At the\ncorner where the main stream of people flowed onward, he started to edge\nout into the cross street.  But the girl with the black eyes caught his\narm, following him and dragging her companion after her, as she cried:\n\n\"Hold on, Bill!  What's yer rush?  You're not goin' to shake us so sudden\nas all that?\"\n\nHe halted with a laugh, and turned, facing them.  Across their shoulders\nhe could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps.  Where he\nstood it was not so light, and, unseen, he would be able to see Her as\nshe passed by.  She would certainly pass by, for that way led home.\n\n\"What's her name?\" he asked of the giggling girl, nodding at the dark-\neyed one.\n\n\"You ask her,\" was the convulsed response.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" he demanded, turning squarely on the girl in\nquestion.\n\n\"You ain't told me yours, yet,\" she retorted.\n\n\"You never asked it,\" he smiled.  \"Besides, you guessed the first rattle.\nIt's Bill, all right, all right.\"\n\n\"Aw, go 'long with you.\"  She looked him in the eyes, her own sharply\npassionate and inviting.  \"What is it, honest?\"\n\nAgain she looked.  All the centuries of woman since sex began were\neloquent in her eyes.  And he measured her in a careless way, and knew,\nbold now, that she would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately, as he\npursued, ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted.  And,\ntoo, he was human, and could feel the draw of her, while his ego could\nnot but appreciate the flattery of her kindness.  Oh, he knew it all, and\nknew them well, from A to Z.  Good, as goodness might be measured in\ntheir particular class, hard-working for meagre wages and scorning the\nsale of self for easier ways, nervously desirous for some small pinch of\nhappiness in the desert of existence, and facing a future that was a\ngamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the black pit of more\nterrible wretchedness, the way whereto being briefer though better paid.\n\n\"Bill,\" he answered, nodding his head.  \"Sure, Pete, Bill an' no other.\"\n\n\"No joshin'?\" she queried.\n\n\"It ain't Bill at all,\" the other broke in.\n\n\"How do you know?\" he demanded.  \"You never laid eyes on me before.\"\n\n\"No need to, to know you're lyin',\" was the retort.\n\n\"Straight, Bill, what is it?\" the first girl asked.\n\n\"Bill'll do,\" he confessed.\n\nShe reached out to his arm and shook him playfully.  \"I knew you was\nlyin', but you look good to me just the same.\"\n\nHe captured the hand that invited, and felt on the palm familiar markings\nand distortions.\n\n\"When'd you chuck the cannery?\" he asked.\n\n\"How'd yeh know?\" and, \"My, ain't cheh a mind-reader!\" the girls\nchorussed.\n\nAnd while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them, before\nhis inner sight towered the book-shelves of the library, filled with the\nwisdom of the ages.  He smiled bitterly at the incongruity of it, and was\nassailed by doubts.  But between inner vision and outward pleasantry he\nfound time to watch the theatre crowd streaming by.  And then he saw Her,\nunder the lights, between her brother and the strange young man with\nglasses, and his heart seemed to stand still.  He had waited long for\nthis moment.  He had time to note the light, fluffy something that hid\nher queenly head, the tasteful lines of her wrapped figure, the\ngracefulness of her carriage and of the hand that caught up her skirts;\nand then she was gone and he was left staring at the two girls of the\ncannery, at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress, their tragic\nefforts to be clean and trim, the cheap cloth, the cheap ribbons, and the\ncheap rings on the fingers.  He felt a tug at his arm, and heard a voice\nsaying:-\n\n\"Wake up, Bill!  What's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"What was you sayin'?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, nothin',\" the dark girl answered, with a toss of her head.  \"I was\nonly remarkin'--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Well, I was whisperin' it'd be a good idea if you could dig up a\ngentleman friend--for her\" (indicating her companion), \"and then, we\ncould go off an' have ice-cream soda somewhere, or coffee, or anything.\"\n\nHe was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea.  The transition from Ruth\nto this had been too abrupt.  Ranged side by side with the bold, defiant\neyes of the girl before him, he saw Ruth's clear, luminous eyes, like a\nsaint's, gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity.  And, somehow,\nhe felt within him a stir of power.  He was better than this.  Life meant\nmore to him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go\nbeyond ice-cream and a gentleman friend.  He remembered that he had led\nalways a secret life in his thoughts.  These thoughts he had tried to\nshare, but never had he found a woman capable of understanding--nor a\nman.  He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners.  And as\nhis thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be beyond\nthem.  He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists.  If life meant\nmore to him, then it was for him to demand more from life, but he could\nnot demand it from such companionship as this.  Those bold black eyes had\nnothing to offer.  He knew the thoughts behind them--of ice-cream and of\nsomething else.  But those saint's eyes alongside--they offered all he\nknew and more than he could guess.  They offered books and painting,\nbeauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.  Behind\nthose black eyes he knew every thought process.  It was like clockwork.\nHe could watch every wheel go around.  Their bid was low pleasure, narrow\nas the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the end of it.  But the\nbid of the saint's eyes was mystery, and wonder unthinkable, and eternal\nlife.  He had caught glimpses of the soul in them, and glimpses of his\nown soul, too.\n\n\"There's only one thing wrong with the programme,\" he said aloud.  \"I've\ngot a date already.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes blazed her disappointment.\n\n\"To sit up with a sick friend, I suppose?\" she sneered.\n\n\"No, a real, honest date with--\" he faltered, \"with a girl.\"\n\n\"You're not stringin' me?\" she asked earnestly.\n\nHe looked her in the eyes and answered: \"It's straight, all right.  But\nwhy can't we meet some other time?  You ain't told me your name yet.  An'\nwhere d'ye live?\"\n\n\"Lizzie,\" she replied, softening toward him, her hand pressing his arm,\nwhile her body leaned against his.  \"Lizzie Connolly.  And I live at\nFifth an' Market.\"\n\nHe talked on a few minutes before saying good night.  He did not go home\nimmediately; and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at\na window and murmured: \"That date was with you, Ruth.  I kept it for\nyou.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nA week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth\nMorse, and still he dared not call.  Time and again he nerved himself up\nto call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died\naway.  He did not know the proper time to call, nor was there any one to\ntell him, and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable\nblunder.  Having shaken himself free from his old companions and old ways\nof life, and having no new companions, nothing remained for him but to\nread, and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a dozen pairs\nof ordinary eyes.  But his eyes were strong, and they were backed by a\nbody superbly strong.  Furthermore, his mind was fallow.  It had lain\nfallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the books was\nconcerned, and it was ripe for the sowing.  It had never been jaded by\nstudy, and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth\nthat would not let go.\n\nIt seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries, so\nfar behind were the old life and outlook.  But he was baffled by lack of\npreparation.  He attempted to read books that required years of\npreliminary specialization.  One day he would read a book of antiquated\nphilosophy, and the next day one that was ultra-modern, so that his head\nwould be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas.  It was\nthe same with the economists.  On the one shelf at the library he found\nKarl Marx, Ricardo, Adam Smith, and Mill, and the abstruse formulas of\nthe one gave no clew that the ideas of another were obsolete.  He was\nbewildered, and yet he wanted to know.  He had become interested, in a\nday, in economics, industry, and politics.  Passing through the City Hall\nPark, he had noticed a group of men, in the centre of which were half a\ndozen, with flushed faces and raised voices, earnestly carrying on a\ndiscussion.  He joined the listeners, and heard a new, alien tongue in\nthe mouths of the philosophers of the people.  One was a tramp, another\nwas a labor agitator, a third was a law-school student, and the remainder\nwas composed of wordy workingmen.  For the first time he heard of\nsocialism, anarchism, and single tax, and learned that there were warring\nsocial philosophies.  He heard hundreds of technical words that were new\nto him, belonging to fields of thought that his meagre reading had never\ntouched upon.  Because of this he could not follow the arguments closely,\nand he could only guess at and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such\nstrange expressions.  Then there was a black-eyed restaurant waiter who\nwas a theosophist, a union baker who was an agnostic, an old man who\nbaffled all of them with the strange philosophy that _what is is right_,\nand another old man who discoursed interminably about the cosmos and the\nfather-atom and the mother-atom.\n\nMartin Eden's head was in a state of addlement when he went away after\nseveral hours, and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions\nof a dozen unusual words.  And when he left the library, he carried under\nhis arm four volumes: Madam Blavatsky's \"Secret Doctrine,\" \"Progress and\nPoverty,\" \"The Quintessence of Socialism,\" and, \"Warfare of Religion and\nScience.\"  Unfortunately, he began on the \"Secret Doctrine.\"  Every line\nbristled with many-syllabled words he did not understand.  He sat up in\nbed, and the dictionary was in front of him more often than the book.  He\nlooked up so many new words that when they recurred, he had forgotten\ntheir meaning and had to look them up again.  He devised the plan of\nwriting the definitions in a note-book, and filled page after page with\nthem.  And still he could not understand.  He read until three in the\nmorning, and his brain was in a turmoil, but not one essential thought in\nthe text had he grasped.  He looked up, and it seemed that the room was\nlifting, heeling, and plunging like a ship upon the sea.  Then he hurled\nthe \"Secret Doctrine\" and many curses across the room, turned off the\ngas, and composed himself to sleep.  Nor did he have much better luck\nwith the other three books.  It was not that his brain was weak or\nincapable; it could think these thoughts were it not for lack of training\nin thinking and lack of the thought-tools with which to think.  He\nguessed this, and for a while entertained the idea of reading nothing but\nthe dictionary until he had mastered every word in it.\n\nPoetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it, finding his\ngreatest joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable.  He\nloved beauty, and there he found beauty.  Poetry, like music, stirred him\nprofoundly, and, though he did not know it, he was preparing his mind for\nthe heavier work that was to come.  The pages of his mind were blank,\nand, without effort, much he read and liked, stanza by stanza, was\nimpressed upon those pages, so that he was soon able to extract great joy\nfrom chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the beauty of the\nprinted words he had read.  Then he stumbled upon Gayley's \"Classic\nMyths\" and Bulfinch's \"Age of Fable,\" side by side on a library shelf.  It\nwas illumination, a great light in the darkness of his ignorance, and he\nread poetry more avidly than ever.\n\nThe man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that he\nhad become quite cordial, always greeting him with a smile and a nod when\nhe entered.  It was because of this that Martin did a daring thing.\nDrawing out some books at the desk, and while the man was stamping the\ncards, Martin blurted out:-\n\n\"Say, there's something I'd like to ask you.\"\n\nThe man smiled and paid attention.\n\n\"When you meet a young lady an' she asks you to call, how soon can you\ncall?\"\n\nMartin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders, what of the sweat\nof the effort.\n\n\"Why I'd say any time,\" the man answered.\n\n\"Yes, but this is different,\" Martin objected.  \"She--I--well, you see,\nit's this way: maybe she won't be there.  She goes to the university.\"\n\n\"Then call again.\"\n\n\"What I said ain't what I meant,\" Martin confessed falteringly, while he\nmade up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the other's mercy.  \"I'm\njust a rough sort of a fellow, an' I ain't never seen anything of\nsociety.  This girl is all that I ain't, an' I ain't anything that she\nis.  You don't think I'm playin' the fool, do you?\" he demanded abruptly.\n\n\"No, no; not at all, I assure you,\" the other protested.  \"Your request\nis not exactly in the scope of the reference department, but I shall be\nonly too pleased to assist you.\"\n\nMartin looked at him admiringly.\n\n\"If I could tear it off that way, I'd be all right,\" he said.\n\n\"I beg pardon?\"\n\n\"I mean if I could talk easy that way, an' polite, an' all the rest.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the other, with comprehension.\n\n\"What is the best time to call?  The afternoon?--not too close to meal-\ntime?  Or the evening?  Or Sunday?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" the librarian said with a brightening face.  \"You call\nher up on the telephone and find out.\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" he said, picking up his books and starting away.\n\nHe turned back and asked:-\n\n\"When you're speakin' to a young lady--say, for instance, Miss Lizzie\nSmith--do you say 'Miss Lizzie'? or 'Miss Smith'?\"\n\n\"Say 'Miss Smith,'\" the librarian stated authoritatively.  \"Say 'Miss\nSmith' always--until you come to know her better.\"\n\nSo it was that Martin Eden solved the problem.\n\n\"Come down any time; I'll be at home all afternoon,\" was Ruth's reply\nover the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return\nthe borrowed books.\n\nShe met him at the door herself, and her woman's eyes took in immediately\nthe creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable change in him\nfor the better.  Also, she was struck by his face.  It was almost\nviolent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him and at her\nin waves of force.  She felt the urge again of the desire to lean toward\nhim for warmth, and marvelled again at the effect his presence produced\nupon her.  And he, in turn, knew again the swimming sensation of bliss\nwhen he felt the contact of her hand in greeting.  The difference between\nthem lay in that she was cool and self-possessed while his face flushed\nto the roots of the hair.  He stumbled with his old awkwardness after\nher, and his shoulders swung and lurched perilously.\n\nOnce they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily--more\neasily by far than he had expected.  She made it easy for him; and the\ngracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than\never.  They talked first of the borrowed books, of the Swinburne he was\ndevoted to, and of the Browning he did not understand; and she led the\nconversation on from subject to subject, while she pondered the problem\nof how she could be of help to him.  She had thought of this often since\ntheir first meeting.  She wanted to help him.  He made a call upon her\npity and tenderness that no one had ever made before, and the pity was\nnot so much derogatory of him as maternal in her.  Her pity could not be\nof the common sort, when the man who drew it was so much man as to shock\nher with maidenly fears and set her mind and pulse thrilling with strange\nthoughts and feelings.  The old fascination of his neck was there, and\nthere was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it.  It\nseemed still a wanton impulse, but she had grown more used to it.  She\ndid not dream that in such guise new-born love would epitomize itself.\nNor did she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love.  She\nthought she was merely interested in him as an unusual type possessing\nvarious potential excellencies, and she even felt philanthropic about it.\n\nShe did not know she desired him; but with him it was different.  He knew\nthat he loved her, and he desired her as he had never before desired\nanything in his life.  He had loved poetry for beauty's sake; but since\nhe met her the gates to the vast field of love-poetry had been opened\nwide.  She had given him understanding even more than Bulfinch and\nGayley.  There was a line that a week before he would not have favored\nwith a second thought--\"God's own mad lover dying on a kiss\"; but now it\nwas ever insistent in his mind.  He marvelled at the wonder of it and the\ntruth; and as he gazed upon her he knew that he could die gladly upon a\nkiss.  He felt himself God's own mad lover, and no accolade of knighthood\ncould have given him greater pride.  And at last he knew the meaning of\nlife and why he had been born.\n\nAs he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring.  He reviewed\nall the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door, and\nlonged for it again.  His gaze wandered often toward her lips, and he\nyearned for them hungrily.  But there was nothing gross or earthly about\nthis yearning.  It gave him exquisite delight to watch every movement and\nplay of those lips as they enunciated the words she spoke; yet they were\nnot ordinary lips such as all men and women had.  Their substance was not\nmere human clay.  They were lips of pure spirit, and his desire for them\nseemed absolutely different from the desire that had led him to other\nwomen's lips.  He could kiss her lips, rest his own physical lips upon\nthem, but it would be with the lofty and awful fervor with which one\nwould kiss the robe of God.  He was not conscious of this transvaluation\nof values that had taken place in him, and was unaware that the light\nthat shone in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light\nthat shines in all men's eyes when the desire of love is upon them.  He\ndid not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze was, nor that the warm\nflame of it was affecting the alchemy of her spirit.  Her penetrative\nvirginity exalted and disguised his own emotions, elevating his thoughts\nto a star-cool chastity, and he would have been startled to learn that\nthere was that shining out of his eyes, like warm waves, that flowed\nthrough her and kindled a kindred warmth.  She was subtly perturbed by\nit, and more than once, though she knew not why, it disrupted her train\nof thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled her to grope for\nthe remainder of ideas partly uttered.  Speech was always easy with her,\nand these interruptions would have puzzled her had she not decided that\nit was because he was a remarkable type.  She was very sensitive to\nimpressions, and it was not strange, after all, that this aura of a\ntraveller from another world should so affect her.\n\nThe problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him,\nand she turned the conversation in that direction; but it was Martin who\ncame to the point first.\n\n\"I wonder if I can get some advice from you,\" he began, and received an\nacquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound.  \"You remember the\nother time I was here I said I couldn't talk about books an' things\nbecause I didn't know how?  Well, I've ben doin' a lot of thinkin' ever\nsince.  I've ben to the library a whole lot, but most of the books I've\ntackled have ben over my head.  Mebbe I'd better begin at the beginnin'.\nI ain't never had no advantages.  I've worked pretty hard ever since I\nwas a kid, an' since I've ben to the library, lookin' with new eyes at\nbooks--an' lookin' at new books, too--I've just about concluded that I\nain't ben reading the right kind.  You know the books you find in cattle-\ncamps an' fo'c's'ls ain't the same you've got in this house, for\ninstance.  Well, that's the sort of readin' matter I've ben accustomed\nto.  And yet--an' I ain't just makin' a brag of it--I've ben different\nfrom the people I've herded with.  Not that I'm any better than the\nsailors an' cow-punchers I travelled with,--I was cow-punchin' for a\nshort time, you know,--but I always liked books, read everything I could\nlay hands on, an'--well, I guess I think differently from most of 'em.\n\n\"Now, to come to what I'm drivin' at.  I was never inside a house like\nthis.  When I come a week ago, an' saw all this, an' you, an' your\nmother, an' brothers, an' everything--well, I liked it.  I'd heard about\nsuch things an' read about such things in some of the books, an' when I\nlooked around at your house, why, the books come true.  But the thing I'm\nafter is I liked it.  I wanted it.  I want it now.  I want to breathe air\nlike you get in this house--air that is filled with books, and pictures,\nand beautiful things, where people talk in low voices an' are clean, an'\ntheir thoughts are clean.  The air I always breathed was mixed up with\ngrub an' house-rent an' scrappin' an booze an' that's all they talked\nabout, too.  Why, when you was crossin' the room to kiss your mother, I\nthought it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen.  I've seen a whole\nlot of life, an' somehow I've seen a whole lot more of it than most of\nthem that was with me.  I like to see, an' I want to see more, an' I want\nto see it different.\n\n\"But I ain't got to the point yet.  Here it is.  I want to make my way to\nthe kind of life you have in this house.  There's more in life than\nbooze, an' hard work, an' knockin' about.  Now, how am I goin' to get it?\nWhere do I take hold an' begin?  I'm willin' to work my passage, you\nknow, an' I can make most men sick when it comes to hard work.  Once I\nget started, I'll work night an' day.  Mebbe you think it's funny, me\naskin' you about all this.  I know you're the last person in the world I\nought to ask, but I don't know anybody else I could ask--unless it's\nArthur.  Mebbe I ought to ask him.  If I was--\"\n\nHis voice died away.  His firmly planned intention had come to a halt on\nthe verge of the horrible probability that he should have asked Arthur\nand that he had made a fool of himself.  Ruth did not speak immediately.\nShe was too absorbed in striving to reconcile the stumbling, uncouth\nspeech and its simplicity of thought with what she saw in his face.  She\nhad never looked in eyes that expressed greater power.  Here was a man\nwho could do anything, was the message she read there, and it accorded\nill with the weakness of his spoken thought.  And for that matter so\ncomplex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just\nappreciation of simplicity.  And yet she had caught an impression of\npower in the very groping of this mind.  It had seemed to her like a\ngiant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down.  Her face\nwas all sympathy when she did speak.\n\n\"What you need, you realize yourself, and it is education.  You should go\nback and finish grammar school, and then go through to high school and\nuniversity.\"\n\n\"But that takes money,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried.  \"I had not thought of that.  But then you have\nrelatives, somebody who could assist you?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"My father and mother are dead.  I've two sisters, one married, an' the\nother'll get married soon, I suppose.  Then I've a string of\nbrothers,--I'm the youngest,--but they never helped nobody.  They've just\nknocked around over the world, lookin' out for number one.  The oldest\ndied in India.  Two are in South Africa now, an' another's on a whaling\nvoyage, an' one's travellin' with a circus--he does trapeze work.  An' I\nguess I'm just like them.  I've taken care of myself since I was\neleven--that's when my mother died.  I've got to study by myself, I\nguess, an' what I want to know is where to begin.\"\n\n\"I should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar.  Your\ngrammar is--\"  She had intended saying \"awful,\" but she amended it to \"is\nnot particularly good.\"\n\nHe flushed and sweated.\n\n\"I know I must talk a lot of slang an' words you don't understand.  But\nthen they're the only words I know--how to speak.  I've got other words\nin my mind, picked 'em up from books, but I can't pronounce 'em, so I\ndon't use 'em.\"\n\n\"It isn't what you say, so much as how you say it.  You don't mind my\nbeing frank, do you?  I don't want to hurt you.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he cried, while he secretly blessed her for her kindness.  \"Fire\naway.  I've got to know, an' I'd sooner know from you than anybody else.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you say, 'You was'; it should be, 'You were.'  You say 'I\nseen' for 'I saw.'  You use the double negative--\"\n\n\"What's the double negative?\" he demanded; then added humbly, \"You see, I\ndon't even understand your explanations.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I didn't explain that,\" she smiled.  \"A double negative\nis--let me see--well, you say, 'never helped nobody.'  'Never' is a\nnegative.  'Nobody' is another negative.  It is a rule that two negatives\nmake a positive.  'Never helped nobody' means that, not helping nobody,\nthey must have helped somebody.\"\n\n\"That's pretty clear,\" he said.  \"I never thought of it before.  But it\ndon't mean they _must_ have helped somebody, does it?  Seems to me that\n'never helped nobody' just naturally fails to say whether or not they\nhelped somebody.  I never thought of it before, and I'll never say it\nagain.\"\n\nShe was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his mind.\nAs soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but corrected her\nerror.\n\n\"You'll find it all in the grammar,\" she went on.  \"There's something\nelse I noticed in your speech.  You say 'don't' when you shouldn't.\n'Don't' is a contraction and stands for two words.  Do you know them?\"\n\nHe thought a moment, then answered, \"'Do not.'\"\n\nShe nodded her head, and said, \"And you use 'don't' when you mean 'does\nnot.'\"\n\nHe was puzzled over this, and did not get it so quickly.\n\n\"Give me an illustration,\" he asked.\n\n\"Well--\"  She puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she thought,\nwhile he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable.\n\"'It don't do to be hasty.'  Change 'don't' to 'do not,' and it reads,\n'It do not do to be hasty,' which is perfectly absurd.\"\n\nHe turned it over in his mind and considered.\n\n\"Doesn't it jar on your ear?\" she suggested.\n\n\"Can't say that it does,\" he replied judicially.\n\n\"Why didn't you say, 'Can't say that it do'?\" she queried.\n\n\"That sounds wrong,\" he said slowly.  \"As for the other I can't make up\nmy mind.  I guess my ear ain't had the trainin' yours has.\"\n\n\"There is no such word as 'ain't,'\" she said, prettily emphatic.\n\nMartin flushed again.\n\n\"And you say 'ben' for 'been,'\" she continued; \"'come' for 'came'; and\nthe way you chop your endings is something dreadful.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"  He leaned forward, feeling that he ought to get down\non his knees before so marvellous a mind.  \"How do I chop?\"\n\n\"You don't complete the endings.  'A-n-d' spells 'and.'  You pronounce it\n'an'.'  'I-n-g' spells 'ing.'  Sometimes you pronounce it 'ing' and\nsometimes you leave off the 'g.'  And then you slur by dropping initial\nletters and diphthongs.  'T-h-e-m' spells 'them.'  You pronounce it--oh,\nwell, it is not necessary to go over all of them.  What you need is the\ngrammar.  I'll get one and show you how to begin.\"\n\nAs she arose, there shot through his mind something that he had read in\nthe etiquette books, and he stood up awkwardly, worrying as to whether he\nwas doing the right thing, and fearing that she might take it as a sign\nthat he was about to go.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Eden,\" she called back, as she was leaving the room.\n\"What is _booze_?  You used it several times, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, booze,\" he laughed.  \"It's slang.  It means whiskey an'\nbeer--anything that will make you drunk.\"\n\n\"And another thing,\" she laughed back.  \"Don't use 'you' when you are\nimpersonal.  'You' is very personal, and your use of it just now was not\nprecisely what you meant.\"\n\n\"I don't just see that.\"\n\n\"Why, you said just now, to me, 'whiskey and beer--anything that will\nmake you drunk'--make me drunk, don't you see?\"\n\n\"Well, it would, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" she smiled.  \"But it would be nicer not to bring me\ninto it.  Substitute 'one' for 'you' and see how much better it sounds.\"\n\nWhen she returned with the grammar, she drew a chair near his--he\nwondered if he should have helped her with the chair--and sat down beside\nhim.  She turned the pages of the grammar, and their heads were inclined\ntoward each other.  He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he\nmust do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity.  But when she\nbegan to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot all about her.\nHe had never heard of conjugation, and was fascinated by the glimpse he\nwas catching into the tie-ribs of language.  He leaned closer to the\npage, and her hair touched his cheek.  He had fainted but once in his\nlife, and he thought he was going to faint again.  He could scarcely\nbreathe, and his heart was pounding the blood up into his throat and\nsuffocating him.  Never had she seemed so accessible as now.  For the\nmoment the great gulf that separated them was bridged.  But there was no\ndiminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her.  She had not\ndescended to him.  It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and\ncarried to her.  His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same\norder as religious awe and fervor.  It seemed to him that he had intruded\nupon the holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside\nfrom the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which\nshe had not been aware.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSeveral weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar,\nreviewed the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that\ncaught his fancy.  Of his own class he saw nothing.  The girls of the\nLotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with\nquestions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley's were\nglad that Martin came no more.  He made another discovery of treasure-\ntrove in the library.  As the grammar had shown him the tie-ribs of\nlanguage, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry, and he began to\nlearn metre and construction and form, beneath the beauty he loved\nfinding the why and wherefore of that beauty.  Another modern book he\nfound treated poetry as a representative art, treated it exhaustively,\nwith copious illustrations from the best in literature.  Never had he\nread fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books.  And his fresh\nmind, untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity of desire,\ngripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the student mind.\n\nWhen he looked back now from his vantage-ground, the old world he had\nknown, the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor-men and\nharpy-women, seemed a very small world; and yet it blended in with this\nnew world and expanded.  His mind made for unity, and he was surprised\nwhen at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds.\nAnd he was ennobled, as well, by the loftiness of thought and beauty he\nfound in the books.  This led him to believe more firmly than ever that\nup above him, in society like Ruth and her family, all men and women\nthought these thoughts and lived them.  Down below where he lived was the\nignoble, and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had soiled\nall his days, and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt the upper\nclasses.  All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a vague\nunrest; he had never known what he wanted, but he had wanted something\nthat he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth.  And now his unrest had\nbecome sharp and painful, and he knew at last, clearly and definitely,\nthat it was beauty, and intellect, and love that he must have.\n\nDuring those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times, and each time\nwas an added inspiration.  She helped him with his English, corrected his\npronunciation, and started him on arithmetic.  But their intercourse was\nnot all devoted to elementary study.  He had seen too much of life, and\nhis mind was too matured, to be wholly content with fractions, cube root,\nparsing, and analysis; and there were times when their conversation\nturned on other themes--the last poetry he had read, the latest poet she\nhad studied.  And when she read aloud to him her favorite passages, he\nascended to the topmost heaven of delight.  Never, in all the women he\nhad heard speak, had he heard a voice like hers.  The least sound of it\nwas a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and throbbed with every word\nshe uttered.  It was the quality of it, the repose, and the musical\nmodulation--the soft, rich, indefinable product of culture and a gentle\nsoul.  As he listened to her, there rang in the ears of his memory the\nharsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and, in lesser degrees of\nharshness, the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his\nown class.  Then the chemistry of vision would begin to work, and they\nwould troop in review across his mind, each, by contrast, multiplying\nRuth's glories.  Then, too, his bliss was heightened by the knowledge\nthat her mind was comprehending what she read and was quivering with\nappreciation of the beauty of the written thought.  She read to him much\nfrom \"The Princess,\" and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears, so\nfinely was her aesthetic nature strung.  At such moments her own emotions\nelevated him till he was as a god, and, as he gazed at her and listened,\nhe seemed gazing on the face of life and reading its deepest secrets.  And\nthen, becoming aware of the heights of exquisite sensibility he attained,\nhe decided that this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the\nworld.  And in review would pass along the corridors of memory all\nprevious thrills and burnings he had known,--the drunkenness of wine, the\ncaresses of women, the rough play and give and take of physical\ncontests,--and they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime\nardor he now enjoyed.\n\nThe situation was obscured to Ruth.  She had never had any experiences of\nthe heart.  Her only experiences in such matters were of the books, where\nthe facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy realm of\nunreality; and she little knew that this rough sailor was creeping into\nher heart and storing there pent forces that would some day burst forth\nand surge through her in waves of fire.  She did not know the actual fire\nof love.  Her knowledge of love was purely theoretical, and she conceived\nof it as lambent flame, gentle as the fall of dew or the ripple of quiet\nwater, and cool as the velvet-dark of summer nights.  Her idea of love\nwas more that of placid affection, serving the loved one softly in an\natmosphere, flower-scented and dim-lighted, of ethereal calm.  She did\nnot dream of the volcanic convulsions of love, its scorching heat and\nsterile wastes of parched ashes.  She knew neither her own potencies, nor\nthe potencies of the world; and the deeps of life were to her seas of\nillusion.  The conjugal affection of her father and mother constituted\nher ideal of love-affinity, and she looked forward some day to emerging,\nwithout shock or friction, into that same quiet sweetness of existence\nwith a loved one.\n\nSo it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange\nindividual, and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects\nhe produced upon her.  It was only natural.  In similar ways she had\nexperienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the\nmenagerie, or when she witnessed a storm of wind, or shuddered at the\nbright-ribbed lightning.  There was something cosmic in such things, and\nthere was something cosmic in him.  He came to her breathing of large\nairs and great spaces.  The blaze of tropic suns was in his face, and in\nhis swelling, resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life.  He was\nmarred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and rougher\ndeeds, the outposts of which began beyond her horizon.  He was untamed,\nwild, and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact that he came\nso mildly to her hand.  Likewise she was stirred by the common impulse to\ntame the wild thing.  It was an unconscious impulse, and farthest from\nher thoughts that her desire was to re-thumb the clay of him into a\nlikeness of her father's image, which image she believed to be the finest\nin the world.  Nor was there any way, out of her inexperience, for her to\nknow that the cosmic feel she caught of him was that most cosmic of\nthings, love, which with equal power drew men and women together across\nthe world, compelled stags to kill each other in the rutting season, and\ndrove even the elements irresistibly to unite.\n\nHis swift development was a source of surprise and interest.  She\ndetected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day, like\nflowers in congenial soil.  She read Browning aloud to him, and was often\npuzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages.  It\nwas beyond her to realize that, out of his experience of men and women\nand life, his interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers.\nHis conceptions seemed naive to her, though she was often fired by his\ndaring flights of comprehension, whose orbit-path was so wide among the\nstars that she could not follow and could only sit and thrill to the\nimpact of unguessed power.  Then she played to him--no longer at him--and\nprobed him with music that sank to depths beyond her plumb-line.  His\nnature opened to music as a flower to the sun, and the transition was\nquick from his working-class rag-time and jingles to her classical\ndisplay pieces that she knew nearly by heart.  Yet he betrayed a\ndemocratic fondness for Wagner, and the \"Tannhauser\" overture, when she\nhad given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing else she played.  In\nan immediate way it personified his life.  All his past was the Venusburg\nmotif, while her he identified somehow with the Pilgrim's Chorus motif;\nand from the exalted state this elevated him to, he swept onward and\nupward into that vast shadow-realm of spirit-groping, where good and evil\nwar eternally.\n\nSometimes he questioned, and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to\nthe correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music.  But her\nsinging he did not question.  It was too wholly her, and he sat always\namazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice.  And he could not\nhelp but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill quaverings of\nfactory girls, ill-nourished and untrained, and with the raucous\nshriekings from gin-cracked throats of the women of the seaport towns.\nShe enjoyed singing and playing to him.  In truth, it was the first time\nshe had ever had a human soul to play with, and the plastic clay of him\nwas a delight to mould; for she thought she was moulding it, and her\nintentions were good.  Besides, it was pleasant to be with him.  He did\nnot repel her.  That first repulsion had been really a fear of her\nundiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep.  Though she did not\nknow it, she had a feeling in him of proprietary right.  Also, he had a\ntonic effect upon her.  She was studying hard at the university, and it\nseemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books and have the\nfresh sea-breeze of his personality blow upon her.  Strength!  Strength\nwas what she needed, and he gave it to her in generous measure.  To come\ninto the same room with him, or to meet him at the door, was to take\nheart of life.  And when he had gone, she would return to her books with\na keener zest and fresh store of energy.\n\nShe knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was an\nawkward thing to play with souls.  As her interest in Martin increased,\nthe remodelling of his life became a passion with her.\n\n\"There is Mr. Butler,\" she said one afternoon, when grammar and\narithmetic and poetry had been put aside.\n\n\"He had comparatively no advantages at first.  His father had been a bank\ncashier, but he lingered for years, dying of consumption in Arizona, so\nthat when he was dead, Mr. Butler, Charles Butler he was called, found\nhimself alone in the world.  His father had come from Australia, you\nknow, and so he had no relatives in California.  He went to work in a\nprinting-office,--I have heard him tell of it many times,--and he got\nthree dollars a week, at first.  His income to-day is at least thirty\nthousand a year.  How did he do it?  He was honest, and faithful, and\nindustrious, and economical.  He denied himself the enjoyments that most\nboys indulge in.  He made it a point to save so much every week, no\nmatter what he had to do without in order to save it.  Of course, he was\nsoon earning more than three dollars a week, and as his wages increased\nhe saved more and more.\n\n\"He worked in the daytime, and at night he went to night school.  He had\nhis eyes fixed always on the future.  Later on he went to night high\nschool.  When he was only seventeen, he was earning excellent wages at\nsetting type, but he was ambitious.  He wanted a career, not a\nlivelihood, and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his\nultimate again.  He decided upon the law, and he entered father's office\nas an office boy--think of that!--and got only four dollars a week.  But\nhe had learned how to be economical, and out of that four dollars he went\non saving money.\"\n\nShe paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it.  His face\nwas lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of Mr. Butler; but\nthere was a frown upon his face as well.\n\n\"I'd say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow,\" he remarked.\n\"Four dollars a week!  How could he live on it?  You can bet he didn't\nhave any frills.  Why, I pay five dollars a week for board now, an'\nthere's nothin' excitin' about it, you can lay to that.  He must have\nlived like a dog.  The food he ate--\"\n\n\"He cooked for himself,\" she interrupted, \"on a little kerosene stove.\"\n\n\"The food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the\nworst-feedin' deep-water ships, than which there ain't much that can be\npossibly worse.\"\n\n\"But think of him now!\" she cried enthusiastically.  \"Think of what his\nincome affords him.  His early denials are paid for a thousand-fold.\"\n\nMartin looked at her sharply.\n\n\"There's one thing I'll bet you,\" he said, \"and it is that Mr. Butler is\nnothin' gay-hearted now in his fat days.  He fed himself like that for\nyears an' years, on a boy's stomach, an' I bet his stomach's none too\ngood now for it.\"\n\nHer eyes dropped before his searching gaze.\n\n\"I'll bet he's got dyspepsia right now!\" Martin challenged.\n\n\"Yes, he has,\" she confessed; \"but--\"\n\n\"An' I bet,\" Martin dashed on, \"that he's solemn an' serious as an old\nowl, an' doesn't care a rap for a good time, for all his thirty thousand\na year.  An' I'll bet he's not particularly joyful at seein' others have\na good time.  Ain't I right?\"\n\nShe nodded her head in agreement, and hastened to explain:-\n\n\"But he is not that type of man.  By nature he is sober and serious.  He\nalways was that.\"\n\n\"You can bet he was,\" Martin proclaimed.  \"Three dollars a week, an' four\ndollars a week, an' a young boy cookin' for himself on an oil-burner an'\nlayin' up money, workin' all day an' studyin' all night, just workin' an'\nnever playin', never havin' a good time, an' never learnin' how to have a\ngood time--of course his thirty thousand came along too late.\"\n\nHis sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the\nthousands of details of the boy's existence and of his narrow spiritual\ndevelopment into a thirty-thousand-dollar-a-year man.  With the swiftness\nand wide-reaching of multitudinous thought Charles Butler's whole life\nwas telescoped upon his vision.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he added, \"I feel sorry for Mr. Butler.  He was too young\nto know better, but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty\nthousand a year that's clean wasted upon him.  Why, thirty thousand, lump\nsum, wouldn't buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin' up would\nhave bought him, when he was a kid, in the way of candy an' peanuts or a\nseat in nigger heaven.\"\n\nIt was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth.  Not\nonly were they new to her, and contrary to her own beliefs, but she\nalways felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify\nher own convictions.  Had she been fourteen instead of twenty-four, she\nmight have been changed by them; but she was twenty-four, conservative by\nnature and upbringing, and already crystallized into the cranny of life\nwhere she had been born and formed.  It was true, his bizarre judgments\ntroubled her in the moments they were uttered, but she ascribed them to\nhis novelty of type and strangeness of living, and they were soon\nforgotten.  Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them, the strength of\ntheir utterance, and the flashing of eyes and earnestness of face that\naccompanied them, always thrilled her and drew her toward him.  She would\nnever have guessed that this man who had come from beyond her horizon,\nwas, in such moments, flashing on beyond her horizon with wider and\ndeeper concepts.  Her own limits were the limits of her horizon; but\nlimited minds can recognize limitations only in others.  And so she felt\nthat her outlook was very wide indeed, and that where his conflicted with\nhers marked his limitations; and she dreamed of helping him to see as she\nsaw, of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.\n\n\"But I have not finished my story,\" she said.  \"He worked, so father\nsays, as no other office boy he ever had.  Mr. Butler was always eager to\nwork.  He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few minutes\nbefore his regular time.  And yet he saved his time.  Every spare moment\nwas devoted to study.  He studied book-keeping and type-writing, and he\npaid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter\nwho needed practice.  He quickly became a clerk, and he made himself\ninvaluable.  Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise.  It\nwas on father's suggestion that he went to law college.  He became a\nlawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as\njunior partner.  He is a great man.  He refused the United States Senate\nseveral times, and father says he could become a justice of the Supreme\nCourt any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to.  Such a life is an\ninspiration to all of us.  It shows us that a man with will may rise\nsuperior to his environment.\"\n\n\"He is a great man,\" Martin said sincerely.\n\nBut it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred upon\nhis sense of beauty and life.  He could not find an adequate motive in\nMr. Butler's life of pinching and privation.  Had he done it for love of\na woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin would have understood.  God's\nown mad lover should do anything for the kiss, but not for thirty\nthousand dollars a year.  He was dissatisfied with Mr. Butler's career.\nThere was something paltry about it, after all.  Thirty thousand a year\nwas all right, but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed\nsuch princely income of all its value.\n\nMuch of this he strove to express to Ruth, and shocked her and made it\nclear that more remodelling was necessary.  Hers was that common\ninsularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color,\ncreed, and politics are best and right and that other human creatures\nscattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they.  It was\nthe same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God he was\nnot born a woman, and sent the modern missionary god-substituting to the\nends of the earth; and it made Ruth desire to shape this man from other\ncrannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in her particular\ncranny of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nBack from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover's\ndesire.  His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the mast on\nthe treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after eight\nmonths of failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking up of the\nexpedition.  The men had been paid off in Australia, and Martin had\nimmediately shipped on a deep-water vessel for San Francisco.  Not alone\nhad those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many\nweeks, but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and\nreading.\n\nHis was the student's mind, and behind his ability to learn was the\nindomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth.  The grammar he had\ntaken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had\nmastered it.  He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates, and made\na point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of\nspeech.  To his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming\nsensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves.  A double\nnegative jarred him like a discord, and often, from lack of practice, it\nwas from his own lips that the jar came.  His tongue refused to learn new\ntricks in a day.\n\nAfter he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the\ndictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary.  He found that\nthis was no light task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and\nover his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions, while he\ninvariably memorized himself to sleep.  \"Never did anything,\" \"if I\nwere,\" and \"those things,\" were phrases, with many variations, that he\nrepeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to the language\nspoken by Ruth.  \"And\" and \"ing,\" with the \"d\" and \"g\" pronounced\nemphatically, he went over thousands of times; and to his surprise he\nnoticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more correct English\nthan the officers themselves and the gentleman-adventurers in the cabin\nwho had financed the expedition.\n\nThe captain was a fishy-eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into\npossession of a complete Shakespeare, which he never read, and Martin had\nwashed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to the\nprecious volumes.  For a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in the\nmany favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without effort on\nhis brain, that all the world seemed to shape itself into forms of\nElizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in blank verse.\nIt trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for noble English;\nwithal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic and obsolete.\n\nThe eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he had\nlearned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of\nhimself.  Along with his humbleness because he knew so little, there\narose a conviction of power.  He felt a sharp gradation between himself\nand his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay\nin potentiality rather than achievement.  What he could do,--they could\ndo; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told him there\nwas more in him than he had done.  He was tortured by the exquisite\nbeauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there to share it with\nhim.  He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits of South\nSea beauty.  The creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and\nurged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than Ruth.  And\nthen, in splendor and glory, came the great idea.  He would write.  He\nwould be one of the eyes through which the world saw, one of the ears\nthrough which it heard, one of the hearts through which it felt.  He\nwould write--everything--poetry and prose, fiction and description, and\nplays like Shakespeare.  There was career and the way to win to Ruth.  The\nmen of literature were the world's giants, and he conceived them to be\nfar finer than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and\ncould be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.\n\nOnce the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to\nSan Francisco was like a dream.  He was drunken with unguessed power and\nfelt that he could do anything.  In the midst of the great and lonely sea\nhe gained perspective.  Clearly, and for the first lime, he saw Ruth and\nher world.  It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which\nhe could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and examine.\nThere was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as\na whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it.  To\nwrite!  The thought was fire in him.  He would begin as soon as he got\nback.  The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the\ntreasure-hunters.  He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper.  He\nwould not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and\npleased when she saw his name in print.  While he wrote, he could go on\nstudying.  There were twenty-four hours in each day.  He was invincible.\nHe knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him.  He would\nnot have to go to sea again--as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a\nvision of a steam yacht.  There were other writers who possessed steam\nyachts.  Of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at\nfirst, and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his\nwriting to enable him to go on studying.  And then, after some time,--a\nvery indeterminate time,--when he had learned and prepared himself, he\nwould write the great things and his name would be on all men's lips.  But\ngreater than that, infinitely greater and greatest of all, he would have\nproved himself worthy of Ruth.  Fame was all very well, but it was for\nRuth that his splendid dream arose.  He was not a fame-monger, but merely\none of God's mad lovers.\n\nArrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his\nold room at Bernard Higginbotham's and set to work.  He did not even let\nRuth know he was back.  He would go and see her when he finished the\narticle on the treasure-hunters.  It was not so difficult to abstain from\nseeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in\nhim.  Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to\nhim.  He did not know how long an article he should write, but he counted\nthe words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement of the San\nFrancisco Examiner, and guided himself by that.  Three days, at white\nheat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a\nlarge scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked\nup in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation\nmarks.  He had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set\nto work writing the article over, referring continually to the pages of\nthe rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the\naverage schoolboy in a year.  When he had copied the article a second\ntime and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints\nto beginners, and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never\nbe rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper.  He\nhad violated the law on both counts.  Also, he learned from the item that\nfirst-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column.  So, while he\ncopied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself by multiplying\nten columns by ten dollars.  The product was always the same, one hundred\ndollars, and he decided that that was better than seafaring.  If it\nhadn't been for his blunders, he would have finished the article in three\ndays.  One hundred dollars in three days!  It would have taken him three\nmonths and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount.  A man was a fool\nto go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money in\nitself meant nothing to him.  Its value was in the liberty it would get\nhim, the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring\nhim nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his\nlife back upon itself and given him inspiration.\n\nHe mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to the\neditor of the San Francisco Examiner.  He had an idea that anything\naccepted by a paper was published immediately, and as he had sent the\nmanuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on the following\nSunday.  He conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise\nRuth of his return.  Then, Sunday afternoon, he would call and see her.\nIn the meantime he was occupied by another idea, which he prided himself\nupon as being a particularly sane, careful, and modest idea.  He would\nwrite an adventure story for boys and sell it to The Youth's Companion.\nHe went to the free reading-room and looked through the files of The\nYouth's Companion.  Serial stories, he found, were usually published in\nthat weekly in five instalments of about three thousand words each.  He\ndiscovered several serials that ran to seven instalments, and decided to\nwrite one of that length.\n\nHe had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once--a voyage that was to\nhave been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the\nend of six months.  While his imagination was fanciful, even fantastic at\ntimes, he had a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about\nthe things he knew.  He knew whaling, and out of the real materials of\nhis knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious adventures of\nthe two boys he intended to use as joint heroes.  It was easy work, he\ndecided on Saturday evening.  He had completed on that day the first\ninstalment of three thousand words--much to the amusement of Jim, and to\nthe open derision of Mr. Higginbotham, who sneered throughout meal-time\nat the \"litery\" person they had discovered in the family.\n\nMartin contented himself by picturing his brother-in-law's surprise on\nSunday morning when he opened his Examiner and saw the article on the\ntreasure-hunters.  Early that morning he was out himself to the front\ndoor, nervously racing through the many-sheeted newspaper.  He went\nthrough it a second time, very carefully, then folded it up and left it\nwhere he had found it.  He was glad he had not told any one about his\narticle.  On second thought he concluded that he had been wrong about the\nspeed with which things found their way into newspaper columns.  Besides,\nthere had not been any news value in his article, and most likely the\neditor would write to him about it first.\n\nAfter breakfast he went on with his serial.  The words flowed from his\npen, though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up\ndefinitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric.  He often read\nor re-read a chapter at a time, during such pauses; and he consoled\nhimself that while he was not writing the great things he felt to be in\nhim, he was learning composition, at any rate, and training himself to\nshape up and express his thoughts.  He toiled on till dark, when he went\nout to the reading-room and explored magazines and weeklies until the\nplace closed at ten o'clock.  This was his programme for a week.  Each\nday he did three thousand words, and each evening he puzzled his way\nthrough the magazines, taking note of the stories, articles, and poems\nthat editors saw fit to publish.  One thing was certain: What these\nmultitudinous writers did he could do, and only give him time and he\nwould do what they could not do.  He was cheered to read in Book News, in\na paragraph on the payment of magazine writers, not that Rudyard Kipling\nreceived a dollar per word, but that the minimum rate paid by first-class\nmagazines was two cents a word.  The Youth's Companion was certainly\nfirst class, and at that rate the three thousand words he had written\nthat day would bring him sixty dollars--two months' wages on the sea!\n\nOn Friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words long.\nAt two cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him four hundred and\ntwenty dollars.  Not a bad week's work.  It was more money than he had\never possessed at one time.  He did not know how he could spend it all.\nHe had tapped a gold mine.  Where this came from he could always get\nmore.  He planned to buy some more clothes, to subscribe to many\nmagazines, and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was\ncompelled to go to the library to consult.  And still there was a large\nportion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent.  This worried him\nuntil the thought came to him of hiring a servant for Gertrude and of\nbuying a bicycle for Marion.\n\nHe mailed the bulky manuscript to The Youth's Companion, and on Saturday\nafternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving, he went to\nsee Ruth.  He had telephoned, and she went herself to greet him at the\ndoor.  The old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and struck\nher like a blow.  It seemed to enter into her body and course through her\nveins in a liquid glow, and to set her quivering with its imparted\nstrength.  He flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked into her blue\neyes, but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the flush, though\nit did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar.\nShe noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly vanished as she\nglanced at his clothes.  They really fitted him,--it was his first made-\nto-order suit,--and he seemed slimmer and better modelled.  In addition,\nhis cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat, which she commanded him to\nput on and then complimented him on his appearance.  She did not remember\nwhen she had felt so happy.  This change in him was her handiwork, and\nshe was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him.\n\nBut the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most,\nwas the change in his speech.  Not only did he speak more correctly, but\nhe spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary.\nWhen he grew excited or enthusiastic, however, he dropped back into the\nold slurring and the dropping of final consonants.  Also, there was an\nawkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had learned.\nOn the other hand, along with his ease of expression, he displayed a\nlightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her.  It was his\nold spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a favorite in his own\nclass, but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her presence\nthrough lack of words and training.  He was just beginning to orientate\nhimself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder.  But he was very\ntentative, fastidiously so, letting Ruth set the pace of sprightliness\nand fancy, keeping up with her but never daring to go beyond her.\n\nHe told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a\nlivelihood and of going on with his studies.  But he was disappointed at\nher lack of approval.  She did not think much of his plan.\n\n\"You see,\" she said frankly, \"writing must be a trade, like anything\nelse.  Not that I know anything about it, of course.  I only bring common\njudgment to bear.  You couldn't hope to be a blacksmith without spending\nthree years at learning the trade--or is it five years!  Now writers are\nso much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many more\nmen who would like to write, who--try to write.\"\n\n\"But then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?\" he queried,\nsecretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination\nthrowing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a\nthousand other scenes from his life--scenes that were rough and raw,\ngross and bestial.\n\nThe whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light,\nproducing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train\nof thought.  On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this\nsweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good\nEnglish, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and all\nilluminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged about\nand fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical\nscenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to look at will\nupon what he wished.  He saw these other scenes through drifting vapors\nand swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish\nlight.  He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey, the air\nfilled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw himself with them\ndrinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at table with them,\nunder smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked and clattered and\nthe cards were dealt around.  He saw himself, stripped to the waist, with\nnaked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool Red in the\nforecastle of the Susquehanna; and he saw the bloody deck of the John\nRogers, that gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate kicking in death-\nthroes on the main-hatch, the revolver in the old man's hand spitting\nfire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched faces, of brutes screaming\nvile blasphemies and falling about him--and then he returned to the\ncentral scene, calm and clean in the steadfast light, where Ruth sat and\ntalked with him amid books and paintings; and he saw the grand piano upon\nwhich she would later play to him; and he heard the echoes of his own\nselected and correct words, \"But then, may I not be peculiarly\nconstituted to write?\"\n\n\"But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for\nblacksmithing,\" she was laughing, \"I never heard of one becoming a\nblacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.\"\n\n\"What would you advise?\" he asked.  \"And don't forget that I feel in me\nthis capacity to write--I can't explain it; I just know that it is in\nme.\"\n\n\"You must get a thorough education,\" was the answer, \"whether or not you\nultimately become a writer.  This education is indispensable for whatever\ncareer you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy.  You should go\nto high school.\"\n\n\"Yes--\" he began; but she interrupted with an afterthought:-\n\n\"Of course, you could go on with your writing, too.\"\n\n\"I would have to,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Why?\"  She looked at him, prettily puzzled, for she did not quite like\nthe persistence with which he clung to his notion.\n\n\"Because, without writing there wouldn't be any high school.  I must live\nand buy books and clothes, you know.\"\n\n\"I'd forgotten that,\" she laughed.  \"Why weren't you born with an\nincome?\"\n\n\"I'd rather have good health and imagination,\" he answered.  \"I can make\ngood on the income, but the other things have to be made good for--\"  He\nalmost said \"you,\" then amended his sentence to, \"have to be made good\nfor one.\"\n\n\"Don't say 'make good,'\" she cried, sweetly petulant.  \"It's slang, and\nit's horrid.\"\n\nHe flushed, and stammered, \"That's right, and I only wish you'd correct\nme every time.\"\n\n\"I--I'd like to,\" she said haltingly.  \"You have so much in you that is\ngood that I want to see you perfect.\"\n\nHe was clay in her hands immediately, as passionately desirous of being\nmoulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her\nideal of man.  And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time,\nthat the entrance examinations to high school began on the following\nMonday, he promptly volunteered that he would take them.\n\nThen she played and sang to him, while he gazed with hungry yearning at\nher, drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be a\nhundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened and\nlonged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nHe stopped to dinner that evening, and, much to Ruth's satisfaction, made\na favorable impression on her father.  They talked about the sea as a\ncareer, a subject which Martin had at his finger-ends, and Mr. Morse\nremarked afterward that he seemed a very clear-headed young man.  In his\navoidance of slang and his search after right words, Martin was compelled\nto talk slowly, which enabled him to find the best thoughts that were in\nhim.  He was more at ease than that first night at dinner, nearly a year\nbefore, and his shyness and modesty even commended him to Mrs. Morse, who\nwas pleased at his manifest improvement.\n\n\"He is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth,\" she told\nher husband.  \"She has been so singularly backward where men are\nconcerned that I have been worried greatly.\"\n\nMr. Morse looked at his wife curiously.\n\n\"You mean to use this young sailor to wake her up?\" he questioned.\n\n\"I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,\" was the\nanswer.  \"If this young Eden can arouse her interest in mankind in\ngeneral, it will be a good thing.\"\n\n\"A very good thing,\" he commented.  \"But suppose,--and we must suppose,\nsometimes, my dear,--suppose he arouses her interest too particularly in\nhim?\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" Mrs. Morse laughed.  \"She is three years older than he,\nand, besides, it is impossible.  Nothing will ever come of it.  Trust\nthat to me.\"\n\nAnd so Martin's role was arranged for him, while he, led on by Arthur and\nNorman, was meditating an extravagance.  They were going out for a ride\ninto the hills Sunday morning on their wheels, which did not interest\nMartin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was going along.\nHe did not ride, nor own a wheel, but if Ruth rode, it was up to him to\nbegin, was his decision; and when he said good night, he stopped in at a\ncyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel.  It was more\nthan a month's hard-earned wages, and it reduced his stock of money\namazingly; but when he added the hundred dollars he was to receive from\nthe Examiner to the four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least\nThe Youth's Companion could pay him, he felt that he had reduced the\nperplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused him.  Nor did he mind,\nin the course of learning to ride the wheel home, the fact that he ruined\nhis suit of clothes.  He caught the tailor by telephone that night from\nMr. Higginbotham's store and ordered another suit.  Then he carried the\nwheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fire-escape to the rear\nwall of the building, and when he had moved his bed out from the wall,\nfound there was just space enough in the small room for himself and the\nwheel.\n\nSunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school\nexamination, but the pearl-diving article lured him away, and he spent\nthe day in the white-hot fever of re-creating the beauty and romance that\nburned in him.  The fact that the Examiner of that morning had failed to\npublish his treasure-hunting article did not dash his spirits.  He was at\ntoo great a height for that, and having been deaf to a twice-repeated\nsummons, he went without the heavy Sunday dinner with which Mr.\nHigginbotham invariably graced his table.  To Mr. Higginbotham such a\ndinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and prosperity, and\nhe honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes upon American\ninstitutions and the opportunity said institutions gave to any\nhard-working man to rise--the rise, in his case, which he pointed out\nunfailingly, being from a grocer's clerk to the ownership of\nHigginbotham's Cash Store.\n\nMartin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished \"Pearl-diving\" on Monday\nmorning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school.  And when,\ndays later, he applied for the results of his examinations, he learned\nthat he had failed in everything save grammar.\n\n\"Your grammar is excellent,\" Professor Hilton informed him, staring at\nhim through heavy spectacles; \"but you know nothing, positively nothing,\nin the other branches, and your United States history is abominable--there\nis no other word for it, abominable.  I should advise you--\"\n\nProfessor Hilton paused and glared at him, unsympathetic and\nunimaginative as one of his own test-tubes.  He was professor of physics\nin the high school, possessor of a large family, a meagre salary, and a\nselect fund of parrot-learned knowledge.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that the man at the desk\nin the library was in Professor Hilton's place just then.\n\n\"And I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least\ntwo years.  Good day.\"\n\nMartin was not deeply affected by his failure, though he was surprised at\nRuth's shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton's advice.  Her\ndisappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had failed, but\nchiefly so for her sake.\n\n\"You see I was right,\" she said.  \"You know far more than any of the\nstudents entering high school, and yet you can't pass the examinations.\nIt is because what education you have is fragmentary, sketchy.  You need\nthe discipline of study, such as only skilled teachers can give you.  You\nmust be thoroughly grounded.  Professor Hilton is right, and if I were\nyou, I'd go to night school.  A year and a half of it might enable you to\ncatch up that additional six months.  Besides, that would leave you your\ndays in which to write, or, if you could not make your living by your\npen, you would have your days in which to work in some position.\"\n\nBut if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school, when am\nI going to see you?--was Martin's first thought, though he refrained from\nuttering it.  Instead, he said:-\n\n\"It seems so babyish for me to be going to night school.  But I wouldn't\nmind that if I thought it would pay.  But I don't think it will pay.  I\ncan do the work quicker than they can teach me.  It would be a loss of\ntime--\" he thought of her and his desire to have her--\"and I can't afford\nthe time.  I haven't the time to spare, in fact.\"\n\n\"There is so much that is necessary.\"  She looked at him gently, and he\nwas a brute to oppose her.  \"Physics and chemistry--you can't do them\nwithout laboratory study; and you'll find algebra and geometry almost\nhopeless without instruction.  You need the skilled teachers, the\nspecialists in the art of imparting knowledge.\"\n\nHe was silent for a minute, casting about for the least vainglorious way\nin which to express himself.\n\n\"Please don't think I'm bragging,\" he began.  \"I don't intend it that way\nat all.  But I have a feeling that I am what I may call a natural\nstudent.  I can study by myself.  I take to it kindly, like a duck to\nwater.  You see yourself what I did with grammar.  And I've learned much\nof other things--you would never dream how much.  And I'm only getting\nstarted.  Wait till I get--\"  He hesitated and assured himself of the\npronunciation before he said \"momentum.  I'm getting my first real feel\nof things now.  I'm beginning to size up the situation--\"\n\n\"Please don't say 'size up,'\" she interrupted.\n\n\"To get a line on things,\" he hastily amended.\n\n\"That doesn't mean anything in correct English,\" she objected.\n\nHe floundered for a fresh start.\n\n\"What I'm driving at is that I'm beginning to get the lay of the land.\"\n\nOut of pity she forebore, and he went on.\n\n\"Knowledge seems to me like a chart-room.  Whenever I go into the\nlibrary, I am impressed that way.  The part played by teachers is to\nteach the student the contents of the chart-room in a systematic way.  The\nteachers are guides to the chart-room, that's all.  It's not something\nthat they have in their own heads.  They don't make it up, don't create\nit.  It's all in the chart-room and they know their way about in it, and\nit's their business to show the place to strangers who might else get\nlost.  Now I don't get lost easily.  I have the bump of location.  I\nusually know where I'm at--What's wrong now?\"\n\n\"Don't say 'where I'm at.'\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he said gratefully, \"where I am.  But where am I at--I\nmean, where am I?  Oh, yes, in the chart-room.  Well, some people--\"\n\n\"Persons,\" she corrected.\n\n\"Some persons need guides, most persons do; but I think I can get along\nwithout them.  I've spent a lot of time in the chart-room now, and I'm on\nthe edge of knowing my way about, what charts I want to refer to, what\ncoasts I want to explore.  And from the way I line it up, I'll explore a\nwhole lot more quickly by myself.  The speed of a fleet, you know, is the\nspeed of the slowest ship, and the speed of the teachers is affected the\nsame way.  They can't go any faster than the ruck of their scholars, and\nI can set a faster pace for myself than they set for a whole schoolroom.\"\n\n\"'He travels the fastest who travels alone,'\" she quoted at him.\n\nBut I'd travel faster with you just the same, was what he wanted to blurt\nout, as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit spaces and\nstarry voids through which he drifted with her, his arm around her, her\npale gold hair blowing about his face.  In the same instant he was aware\nof the pitiful inadequacy of speech.  God!  If he could so frame words\nthat she could see what he then saw!  And he felt the stir in him, like a\nthroe of yearning pain, of the desire to paint these visions that flashed\nunsummoned on the mirror of his mind.  Ah, that was it!  He caught at the\nhem of the secret.  It was the very thing that the great writers and\nmaster-poets did.  That was why they were giants.  They knew how to\nexpress what they thought, and felt, and saw.  Dogs asleep in the sun\noften whined and barked, but they were unable to tell what they saw that\nmade them whine and bark.  He had often wondered what it was.  And that\nwas all he was, a dog asleep in the sun.  He saw noble and beautiful\nvisions, but he could only whine and bark at Ruth.  But he would cease\nsleeping in the sun.  He would stand up, with open eyes, and he would\nstruggle and toil and learn until, with eyes unblinded and tongue untied,\nhe could share with her his visioned wealth.  Other men had discovered\nthe trick of expression, of making words obedient servitors, and of\nmaking combinations of words mean more than the sum of their separate\nmeanings.  He was stirred profoundly by the passing glimpse at the\nsecret, and he was again caught up in the vision of sunlit spaces and\nstarry voids--until it came to him that it was very quiet, and he saw\nRuth regarding him with an amused expression and a smile in her eyes.\n\n\"I have had a great visioning,\" he said, and at the sound of his words in\nhis own ears his heart gave a leap.  Where had those words come from?\nThey had adequately expressed the pause his vision had put in the\nconversation.  It was a miracle.  Never had he so loftily framed a lofty\nthought.  But never had he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words.\nThat was it.  That explained it.  He had never tried.  But Swinburne had,\nand Tennyson, and Kipling, and all the other poets.  His mind flashed on\nto his \"Pearl-diving.\"  He had never dared the big things, the spirit of\nthe beauty that was a fire in him.  That article would be a different\nthing when he was done with it.  He was appalled by the vastness of the\nbeauty that rightfully belonged in it, and again his mind flashed and\ndared, and he demanded of himself why he could not chant that beauty in\nnoble verse as the great poets did.  And there was all the mysterious\ndelight and spiritual wonder of his love for Ruth.  Why could he not\nchant that, too, as the poets did?  They had sung of love.  So would he.\nBy God!--\n\nAnd in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing.  Carried\naway, he had breathed it aloud.  The blood surged into his face, wave\nupon wave, mastering the bronze of it till the blush of shame flaunted\nitself from collar-rim to the roots of his hair.\n\n\"I--I--beg your pardon,\" he stammered.  \"I was thinking.\"\n\n\"It sounded as if you were praying,\" she said bravely, but she felt\nherself inside to be withering and shrinking.  It was the first time she\nhad heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew, and she was shocked,\nnot merely as a matter of principle and training, but shocked in spirit\nby this rough blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood.\n\nBut she forgave, and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness.\nSomehow it was not so difficult to forgive him anything.  He had not had\na chance to be as other men, and he was trying so hard, and succeeding,\ntoo.  It never entered her head that there could be any other reason for\nher being kindly disposed toward him.  She was tenderly disposed toward\nhim, but she did not know it.  She had no way of knowing it.  The placid\npoise of twenty-four years without a single love affair did not fit her\nwith a keen perception of her own feelings, and she who had never warmed\nto actual love was unaware that she was warming now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nMartin went back to his pearl-diving article, which would have been\nfinished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his\nattempts to write poetry.  His poems were love poems, inspired by Ruth,\nbut they were never completed.  Not in a day could he learn to chant in\nnoble verse.  Rhyme and metre and structure were serious enough in\nthemselves, but there was, over and beyond them, an intangible and\nevasive something that he caught in all great poetry, but which he could\nnot catch and imprison in his own.  It was the elusive spirit of poetry\nitself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture.  It seemed\na glow to him, a warm and trailing vapor, ever beyond his reaching,\nthough sometimes he was rewarded by catching at shreds of it and weaving\nthem into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted\nacross his vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty.  It was baffling.  He\nached with desire to express and could but gibber prosaically as\neverybody gibbered.  He read his fragments aloud.  The metre marched\nalong on perfect feet, and the rhyme pounded a longer and equally\nfaultless rhythm, but the glow and high exaltation that he felt within\nwere lacking.  He could not understand, and time and again, in despair,\ndefeated and depressed, he returned to his article.  Prose was certainly\nan easier medium.\n\nFollowing the \"Pearl-diving,\" he wrote an article on the sea as a career,\nanother on turtle-catching, and a third on the northeast trades.  Then he\ntried, as an experiment, a short story, and before he broke his stride he\nhad finished six short stories and despatched them to various magazines.\nHe wrote prolifically, intensely, from morning till night, and late at\nnight, except when he broke off to go to the reading-room, draw books\nfrom the library, or to call on Ruth.  He was profoundly happy.  Life was\npitched high.  He was in a fever that never broke.  The joy of creation\nthat is supposed to belong to the gods was his.  All the life about\nhim--the odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds, the slatternly form of\nhis sister, and the jeering face of Mr. Higginbotham--was a dream.  The\nreal world was in his mind, and the stories he wrote were so many pieces\nof reality out of his mind.\n\nThe days were too short.  There was so much he wanted to study.  He cut\nhis sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along upon it.\nHe tried four hours and a half, and regretfully came back to five.  He\ncould joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon any one of his\npursuits.  It was with regret that he ceased from writing to study, that\nhe ceased from study to go to the library, that he tore himself away from\nthat chart-room of knowledge or from the magazines in the reading-room\nthat were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded in selling\ntheir wares.  It was like severing heart strings, when he was with Ruth,\nto stand up and go; and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get\nhome to his books at the least possible expense of time.  And hardest of\nall was it to shut up the algebra or physics, put note-book and pencil\naside, and close his tired eyes in sleep.  He hated the thought of\nceasing to live, even for so short a time, and his sole consolation was\nthat the alarm clock was set five hours ahead.  He would lose only five\nhours anyway, and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of\nunconsciousness and he would have before him another glorious day of\nnineteen hours.\n\nIn the meantime the weeks were passing, his money was ebbing low, and\nthere was no money coming in.  A month after he had mailed it, the\nadventure serial for boys was returned to him by The Youth's Companion.\nThe rejection slip was so tactfully worded that he felt kindly toward the\neditor.  But he did not feel so kindly toward the editor of the San\nFrancisco Examiner.  After waiting two whole weeks, Martin had written to\nhim.  A week later he wrote again.  At the end of the month, he went over\nto San Francisco and personally called upon the editor.  But he did not\nmeet that exalted personage, thanks to a Cerberus of an office boy, of\ntender years and red hair, who guarded the portals.  At the end of the\nfifth week the manuscript came back to him, by mail, without comment.\nThere was no rejection slip, no explanation, nothing.  In the same way\nhis other articles were tied up with the other leading San Francisco\npapers.  When he recovered them, he sent them to the magazines in the\nEast, from which they were returned more promptly, accompanied always by\nthe printed rejection slips.\n\nThe short stories were returned in similar fashion.  He read them over\nand over, and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out the cause\nof their rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper that\nmanuscripts should always be typewritten.  That explained it.  Of course\neditors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of\nreading handwriting.  Martin rented a typewriter and spent a day\nmastering the machine.  Each day he typed what he composed, and he typed\nhis earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him.  He was\nsurprised when the typed ones began to come back.  His jaw seemed to\nbecome squarer, his chin more aggressive, and he bundled the manuscripts\noff to new editors.\n\nThe thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work.  He\ntried it out on Gertrude.  He read his stories aloud to her.  Her eyes\nglistened, and she looked at him proudly as she said:-\n\n\"Ain't it grand, you writin' those sort of things.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he demanded impatiently.  \"But the story--how did you like\nit?\"\n\n\"Just grand,\" was the reply.  \"Just grand, an' thrilling, too.  I was all\nworked up.\"\n\nHe could see that her mind was not clear.  The perplexity was strong in\nher good-natured face.  So he waited.\n\n\"But, say, Mart,\" after a long pause, \"how did it end?  Did that young\nman who spoke so highfalutin' get her?\"\n\nAnd, after he had explained the end, which he thought he had made\nartistically obvious, she would say:-\n\n\"That's what I wanted to know.  Why didn't you write that way in the\nstory?\"\n\nOne thing he learned, after he had read her a number of stories, namely,\nthat she liked happy endings.\n\n\"That story was perfectly grand,\" she announced, straightening up from\nthe wash-tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her forehead\nwith a red, steamy hand; \"but it makes me sad.  I want to cry.  There is\ntoo many sad things in the world anyway.  It makes me happy to think\nabout happy things.  Now if he'd married her, and--You don't mind, Mart?\"\nshe queried apprehensively.  \"I just happen to feel that way, because I'm\ntired, I guess.  But the story was grand just the same, perfectly grand.\nWhere are you goin' to sell it?\"\n\n\"That's a horse of another color,\" he laughed.\n\n\"But if you _did_ sell it, what do you think you'd get for it?\"\n\n\"Oh, a hundred dollars.  That would be the least, the way prices go.\"\n\n\"My!  I do hope you'll sell it!\"\n\n\"Easy money, eh?\"  Then he added proudly: \"I wrote it in two days.  That's\nfifty dollars a day.\"\n\nHe longed to read his stories to Ruth, but did not dare.  He would wait\ntill some were published, he decided, then she would understand what he\nhad been working for.  In the meantime he toiled on.  Never had the\nspirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this amazing\nexploration of the realm of mind.  He bought the text-books on physics\nand chemistry, and, along with his algebra, worked out problems and\ndemonstrations.  He took the laboratory proofs on faith, and his intense\npower of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals more\nunderstandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.\nMartin wandered on through the heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews he\nwas getting to the nature of things.  He had accepted the world as the\nworld, but now he was comprehending the organization of it, the play and\ninterplay of force and matter.  Spontaneous explanations of old matters\nwere continually arising in his mind.  Levers and purchases fascinated\nhim, and his mind roved backward to hand-spikes and blocks and tackles at\nsea.  The theory of navigation, which enabled the ships to travel\nunerringly their courses over the pathless ocean, was made clear to him.\nThe mysteries of storm, and rain, and tide were revealed, and the reason\nfor the existence of trade-winds made him wonder whether he had written\nhis article on the northeast trade too soon.  At any rate he knew he\ncould write it better now.  One afternoon he went out with Arthur to the\nUniversity of California, and, with bated breath and a feeling of\nreligious awe, went through the laboratories, saw demonstrations, and\nlistened to a physics professor lecturing to his classes.\n\nBut he did not neglect his writing.  A stream of short stories flowed\nfrom his pen, and he branched out into the easier forms of verse--the\nkind he saw printed in the magazines--though he lost his head and wasted\ntwo weeks on a tragedy in blank verse, the swift rejection of which, by\nhalf a dozen magazines, dumfounded him.  Then he discovered Henley and\nwrote a series of sea-poems on the model of \"Hospital Sketches.\"  They\nwere simple poems, of light and color, and romance and adventure.  \"Sea\nLyrics,\" he called them, and he judged them to be the best work he had\nyet done.  There were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing one\na day after having done his regular day's work on fiction, which day's\nwork was the equivalent to a week's work of the average successful\nwriter.  The toil meant nothing to him.  It was not toil.  He was finding\nspeech, and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent for years behind\nhis inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild and virile flood.\n\nHe showed the \"Sea Lyrics\" to no one, not even to the editors.  He had\nbecome distrustful of editors.  But it was not distrust that prevented\nhim from submitting the \"Lyrics.\"  They were so beautiful to him that he\nwas impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious, far-off\ntime when he would dare to read to her what he had written.  Against that\ntime he kept them with him, reading them aloud, going over them until he\nknew them by heart.\n\nHe lived every moment of his waking hours, and he lived in his sleep, his\nsubjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and combining\nthe thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels.\nIn reality, he never rested, and a weaker body or a less firmly poised\nbrain would have been prostrated in a general break-down.  His late\nafternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now, for June was approaching, when\nshe would take her degree and finish with the university.  Bachelor of\nArts!--when he thought of her degree, it seemed she fled beyond him\nfaster than he could pursue.\n\nOne afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually\nstayed for dinner and for music afterward.  Those were his red-letter\ndays.  The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with that in which\nhe lived, and the mere nearness to her, sent him forth each time with a\nfirmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights.  In spite of the beauty\nin him, and the aching desire to create, it was for her that he\nstruggled.  He was a lover first and always.  All other things he\nsubordinated to love.\n\nGreater than his adventure in the world of thought was his\nlove-adventure.  The world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms\nand molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of\nirresistible force; what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived in\nit.  She was the most amazing thing he had ever known, or dreamed, or\nguessed.\n\nBut he was oppressed always by her remoteness.  She was so far from him,\nand he did not know how to approach her.  He had been a success with\ngirls and women in his own class; but he had never loved any of them,\nwhile he did love her, and besides, she was not merely of another class.\nHis very love elevated her above all classes.  She was a being apart, so\nfar apart that he did not know how to draw near to her as a lover should\ndraw near.  It was true, as he acquired knowledge and language, that he\nwas drawing nearer, talking her speech, discovering ideas and delights in\ncommon; but this did not satisfy his lover's yearning.  His lover's\nimagination had made her holy, too holy, too spiritualized, to have any\nkinship with him in the flesh.  It was his own love that thrust her from\nhim and made her seem impossible for him.  Love itself denied him the one\nthing that it desired.\n\nAnd then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged for\na moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever narrower.\nThey had been eating cherries--great, luscious, black cherries with a\njuice of the color of dark wine.  And later, as she read aloud to him\nfrom \"The Princess,\" he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on\nher lips.  For the moment her divinity was shattered.  She was clay,\nafter all, mere clay, subject to the common law of clay as his clay was\nsubject, or anybody's clay.  Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries\ndyed them as cherries dyed his.  And if so with her lips, then was it so\nwith all of her.  She was woman, all woman, just like any woman.  It came\nupon him abruptly.  It was a revelation that stunned him.  It was as if\nhe had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen worshipped purity\npolluted.\n\nThen he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding and\nchallenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a spirit\nfrom other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain.  He\ntrembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was singing,\nand reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.  Something\nof this change in him must have reached her, for she paused from her\nreading, looked up at him, and smiled.  His eyes dropped from her blue\neyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him.  His arms all\nbut flashed out to her and around her, in the way of his old careless\nlife.  She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will fought to\nhold him back.\n\n\"You were not following a word,\" she pouted.\n\nThen she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked\ninto her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he\nfelt, he became abashed.  He had indeed in thought dared too far.  Of all\nthe women he had known there was no woman who would not have guessed--save\nher.  And she had not guessed.  There was the difference.  She was\ndifferent.  He was appalled by his own grossness, awed by her clear\ninnocence, and he gazed again at her across the gulf.  The bridge had\nbroken down.\n\nBut still the incident had brought him nearer.  The memory of it\npersisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt upon\nit eagerly.  The gulf was never again so wide.  He had accomplished a\ndistance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts, or a dozen\nbachelorships.  She was pure, it was true, as he had never dreamed of\npurity; but cherries stained her lips.  She was subject to the laws of\nthe universe just as inexorably as he was.  She had to eat to live, and\nwhen she got her feet wet, she caught cold.  But that was not the point.\nIf she could feel hunger and thirst, and heat and cold, then could she\nfeel love--and love for a man.  Well, he was a man.  And why could he not\nbe the man?  \"It's up to me to make good,\" he would murmur fervently.  \"I\nwill be _the_ man.  I will make myself _the_ man.  I will make good.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nEarly one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the\nbeauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain,\nMartin was called to the telephone.\n\n\"It's a lady's voice, a fine lady's,\" Mr. Higginbotham, who had called\nhim, jeered.\n\nMartin went to the telephone in the corner of the room, and felt a wave\nof warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth's voice.  In his battle with\nthe sonnet he had forgotten her existence, and at the sound of her voice\nhis love for her smote him like a sudden blow.  And such a\nvoice!--delicate and sweet, like a strain of music heard far off and\nfaint, or, better, like a bell of silver, a perfect tone, crystal-pure.\nNo mere woman had a voice like that.  There was something celestial about\nit, and it came from other worlds.  He could scarcely hear what it said,\nso ravished was he, though he controlled his face, for he knew that Mr.\nHigginbotham's ferret eyes were fixed upon him.\n\nIt was not much that Ruth wanted to say--merely that Norman had been\ngoing to take her to a lecture that night, but that he had a headache,\nand she was so disappointed, and she had the tickets, and that if he had\nno other engagement, would he be good enough to take her?\n\nWould he!  He fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice.  It was\namazing.  He had always seen her in her own house.  And he had never\ndared to ask her to go anywhere with him.  Quite irrelevantly, still at\nthe telephone and talking with her, he felt an overpowering desire to die\nfor her, and visions of heroic sacrifice shaped and dissolved in his\nwhirling brain.  He loved her so much, so terribly, so hopelessly.  In\nthat moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him, go to a\nlecture with him--with him, Martin Eden--she soared so far above him that\nthere seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her.  It was the\nonly fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty emotion\nhe felt for her.  It was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes\nto all lovers, and it came to him there, at the telephone, in a whirlwind\nof fire and glory; and to die for her, he felt, was to have lived and\nloved well.  And he was only twenty-one, and he had never been in love\nbefore.\n\nHis hand trembled as he hung up the receiver, and he was weak from the\norgan which had stirred him.  His eyes were shining like an angel's, and\nhis face was transfigured, purged of all earthly dross, and pure and\nholy.\n\n\"Makin' dates outside, eh?\" his brother-in-law sneered.  \"You know what\nthat means.  You'll be in the police court yet.\"\n\nBut Martin could not come down from the height.  Not even the bestiality\nof the allusion could bring him back to earth.  Anger and hurt were\nbeneath him.  He had seen a great vision and was as a god, and he could\nfeel only profound and awful pity for this maggot of a man.  He did not\nlook at him, and though his eyes passed over him, he did not see him; and\nas in a dream he passed out of the room to dress.  It was not until he\nhad reached his own room and was tying his necktie that he became aware\nof a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears.  On investigating this\nsound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard Higginbotham, which\nsomehow had not penetrated to his brain before.\n\nAs Ruth's front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with\nher, he found himself greatly perturbed.  It was not unalloyed bliss,\ntaking her to the lecture.  He did not know what he ought to do.  He had\nseen, on the streets, with persons of her class, that the women took the\nmen's arms.  But then, again, he had seen them when they didn't; and he\nwondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken, or only\nbetween husbands and wives and relatives.\n\nJust before he reached the sidewalk, he remembered Minnie.  Minnie had\nalways been a stickler.  She had called him down the second time she\nwalked out with him, because he had gone along on the inside, and she had\nlaid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the\noutside--when he was with a lady.  And Minnie had made a practice of\nkicking his heels, whenever they crossed from one side of the street to\nthe other, to remind him to get over on the outside.  He wondered where\nshe had got that item of etiquette, and whether it had filtered down from\nabove and was all right.\n\nIt wouldn't do any harm to try it, he decided, by the time they had\nreached the sidewalk; and he swung behind Ruth and took up his station on\nthe outside.  Then the other problem presented itself.  Should he offer\nher his arm?  He had never offered anybody his arm in his life.  The\ngirls he had known never took the fellows' arms.  For the first several\ntimes they walked freely, side by side, and after that it was arms around\nthe waists, and heads against the fellows' shoulders where the streets\nwere unlighted.  But this was different.  She wasn't that kind of a girl.\nHe must do something.\n\nHe crooked the arm next to her--crooked it very slightly and with secret\ntentativeness, not invitingly, but just casually, as though he was\naccustomed to walk that way.  And then the wonderful thing happened.  He\nfelt her hand upon his arm.  Delicious thrills ran through him at the\ncontact, and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the solid\nearth and was flying with her through the air.  But he was soon back\nagain, perturbed by a new complication.  They were crossing the street.\nThis would put him on the inside.  He should be on the outside.  Should\nhe therefore drop her arm and change over?  And if he did so, would he\nhave to repeat the manoeuvre the next time?  And the next?  There was\nsomething wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about and play the\nfool.  Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and when he found\nhimself on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly, making a show of\nbeing carried away by what he was saying, so that, in case he was wrong\nin not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his\ncarelessness.\n\nAs they crossed Broadway, he came face to face with a new problem.  In\nthe blaze of the electric lights, he saw Lizzie Connolly and her giggly\nfriend.  Only for an instant he hesitated, then his hand went up and his\nhat came off.  He could not be disloyal to his kind, and it was to more\nthan Lizzie Connolly that his hat was lifted.  She nodded and looked at\nhim boldly, not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth's, but with eyes that\nwere handsome and hard, and that swept on past him to Ruth and itemized\nher face and dress and station.  And he was aware that Ruth looked, too,\nwith quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove's, but which saw, in a\nlook that was a flutter on and past, the working-class girl in her cheap\nfinery and under the strange hat that all working-class girls were\nwearing just then.\n\n\"What a pretty girl!\" Ruth said a moment later.\n\nMartin could have blessed her, though he said:-\n\n\"I don't know.  I guess it's all a matter of personal taste, but she\ndoesn't strike me as being particularly pretty.\"\n\n\"Why, there isn't one woman in ten thousand with features as regular as\nhers.  They are splendid.  Her face is as clear-cut as a cameo.  And her\neyes are beautiful.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" Martin queried absently, for to him there was only one\nbeautiful woman in the world, and she was beside him, her hand upon his\narm.\n\n\"Do I think so?  If that girl had proper opportunity to dress, Mr. Eden,\nand if she were taught how to carry herself, you would be fairly dazzled\nby her, and so would all men.\"\n\n\"She would have to be taught how to speak,\" he commented, \"or else most\nof the men wouldn't understand her.  I'm sure you couldn't understand a\nquarter of what she said if she just spoke naturally.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  You are as bad as Arthur when you try to make your point.\"\n\n\"You forget how I talked when you first met me.  I have learned a new\nlanguage since then.  Before that time I talked as that girl talks.  Now\nI can manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to\nexplain that you do not know that other girl's language.  And do you know\nwhy she carries herself the way she does?  I think about such things now,\nthough I never used to think about them, and I am beginning to\nunderstand--much.\"\n\n\"But why does she?\"\n\n\"She has worked long hours for years at machines.  When one's body is\nyoung, it is very pliable, and hard work will mould it like putty\naccording to the nature of the work.  I can tell at a glance the trades\nof many workingmen I meet on the street.  Look at me.  Why am I rolling\nall about the shop?  Because of the years I put in on the sea.  If I'd\nput in the same years cow-punching, with my body young and pliable, I\nwouldn't be rolling now, but I'd be bow-legged.  And so with that girl.\nYou noticed that her eyes were what I might call hard.  She has never\nbeen sheltered.  She has had to take care of herself, and a young girl\ncan't take care of herself and keep her eyes soft and gentle like--like\nyours, for example.\"\n\n\"I think you are right,\" Ruth said in a low voice.  \"And it is too bad.\nShe is such a pretty girl.\"\n\nHe looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity.  And then he\nremembered that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune\nthat permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture.\n\nWho are you, Martin Eden? he demanded of himself in the looking-glass,\nthat night when he got back to his room.  He gazed at himself long and\ncuriously.  Who are you?  What are you?  Where do you belong?  You belong\nby rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly.  You belong with the legions of\ntoil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful.  You belong with\nthe oxen and the drudges, in dirty surroundings among smells and\nstenches.  There are the stale vegetables now.  Those potatoes are\nrotting.  Smell them, damn you, smell them.  And yet you dare to open the\nbooks, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful\npaintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your own\nkind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys\nand to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you\nand who lives in the stars!  Who are you? and what are you? damn you!  And\nare you going to make good?\n\nHe shook his fist at himself in the glass, and sat down on the edge of\nthe bed to dream for a space with wide eyes.  Then he got out note-book\nand algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations, while the hours\nslipped by, and the stars dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded against\nhis window.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nIt was the knot of wordy socialists and working-class philosophers that\nheld forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was responsible\nfor the great discovery.  Once or twice in the month, while riding\nthrough the park on his way to the library, Martin dismounted from his\nwheel and listened to the arguments, and each time he tore himself away\nreluctantly.  The tone of discussion was much lower than at Mr. Morse's\ntable.  The men were not grave and dignified.  They lost their tempers\neasily and called one another names, while oaths and obscene allusions\nwere frequent on their lips.  Once or twice he had seen them come to\nblows.  And yet, he knew not why, there seemed something vital about the\nstuff of these men's thoughts.  Their logomachy was far more stimulating\nto his intellect than the reserved and quiet dogmatism of Mr. Morse.\nThese men, who slaughtered English, gesticulated like lunatics, and\nfought one another's ideas with primitive anger, seemed somehow to be\nmore alive than Mr. Morse and his crony, Mr. Butler.\n\nMartin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park, but\none afternoon a disciple of Spencer's appeared, a seedy tramp with a\ndirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a\nshirt.  Battle royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes and\nthe expectoration of much tobacco-juice, wherein the tramp successfully\nheld his own, even when a socialist workman sneered, \"There is no god but\nthe Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.\"  Martin was puzzled\nas to what the discussion was about, but when he rode on to the library\nhe carried with him a new-born interest in Herbert Spencer, and because\nof the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned \"First Principles,\"\nMartin drew out that volume.\n\nSo the great discovery began.  Once before he had tried Spencer, and\nchoosing the \"Principles of Psychology\" to begin with, he had failed as\nabjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky.  There had been no\nunderstanding the book, and he had returned it unread.  But this night,\nafter algebra and physics, and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed\nand opened \"First Principles.\"  Morning found him still reading.  It was\nimpossible for him to sleep.  Nor did he write that day.  He lay on the\nbed till his body grew tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on\nhis back, the book held in the air above him, or changing from side to\nside.  He slept that night, and did his writing next morning, and then\nthe book tempted him and he fell, reading all afternoon, oblivious to\neverything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth\ngave to him.  His first consciousness of the immediate world about him\nwas when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know\nif he thought they were running a restaurant.\n\nMartin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days.  He wanted to\nknow, and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the\nworld.  But he was now learning from Spencer that he never had known, and\nthat he never could have known had he continued his sailing and wandering\nforever.  He had merely skimmed over the surface of things, observing\ndetached phenomena, accumulating fragments of facts, making superficial\nlittle generalizations--and all and everything quite unrelated in a\ncapricious and disorderly world of whim and chance.  The mechanism of the\nflight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with understanding; but\nit had never entered his head to try to explain the process whereby\nbirds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been developed.  He had never\ndreamed there was such a process.  That birds should have come to be, was\nunguessed.  They always had been.  They just happened.\n\nAnd as it was with birds, so had it been with everything.  His ignorant\nand unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless.  The medieval\nmetaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing, and had served the\nsole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers.  In similar\nmanner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a hopelessly\ntechnical volume by Romanes.  He had understood nothing, and the only\nidea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry-as-dust theory, of a\nlot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible vocabularies.  And\nnow he learned that evolution was no mere theory but an accepted process\nof development; that scientists no longer disagreed about it, their only\ndifferences being over the method of evolution.\n\nAnd here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him, reducing\neverything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and presenting to\nhis startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like\nthe model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles.\nThere was no caprice, no chance.  All was law.  It was in obedience to\nlaw that the bird flew, and it was in obedience to the same law that\nfermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out legs and wings and\nbecome a bird.\n\nMartin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here\nhe was at a higher pitch than ever.  All the hidden things were laying\ntheir secrets bare.  He was drunken with comprehension.  At night,\nasleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the\nday, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon\nthe world he had just discovered.  At table he failed to hear the\nconversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out\nand following cause and effect in everything before him.  In the meat on\nthe platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all\nits transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or traced\nits energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to\ncut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to\ncut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his\nbrain.  He was entranced by illumination, and did not hear the\n\"Bughouse,\" whispered by Jim, nor see the anxiety on his sister's face,\nnor notice the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham's finger, whereby he\nimparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother-in-law's head.\n\nWhat, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation of\nknowledge--of all knowledge.  He had been curious to know things, and\nwhatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in\nhis brain.  Thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store.  On\nthe subject of woman he had a fairly large store.  But these two subjects\nhad been unrelated.  Between the two memory compartments there had been\nno connection.  That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any\nconnection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner\ncarrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as\nridiculous and impossible.  But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only\nthat it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for there to be no\nconnection.  All things were related to all other things from the\nfarthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the\ngrain of sand under one's foot.  This new concept was a perpetual\namazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually in tracing\nthe relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side\nof the sun.  He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was\nunhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them\nall--kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes,\nrainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions,\nilluminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and\ntobacco.  Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it,\nor wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a terrified\ntraveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal, but\nobserving and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know.\nAnd the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe, and\nlife, and his own life in the midst of it all.\n\n\"You fool!\" he cried at his image in the looking-glass.  \"You wanted to\nwrite, and you tried to write, and you had nothing in you to write about.\nWhat did you have in you?--some childish notions, a few half-baked\nsentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass of ignorance,\na heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as big as your love\nand as futile as your ignorance.  And you wanted to write!  Why, you're\njust on the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about.  You\nwanted to create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about\nthe nature of beauty?  You wanted to write about life when you knew\nnothing of the essential characteristics of life.  You wanted to write\nabout the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese\npuzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about\nwhat you did not know of the scheme of existence.  But cheer up, Martin,\nmy boy.  You'll write yet.  You know a little, a very little, and you're\non the right road now to know more.  Some day, if you're lucky, you may\ncome pretty close to knowing all that may be known.  Then you will\nwrite.\"\n\nHe brought his great discovery to Ruth, sharing with her all his joy and\nwonder in it.  But she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it.  She\ntacitly accepted it and, in a way, seemed aware of it from her own\nstudies.  It did not stir her deeply, as it did him, and he would have\nbeen surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh\nto her as it was to him.  Arthur and Norman, he found, believed in\nevolution and had read Spencer, though it did not seem to have made any\nvital impression upon them, while the young fellow with the glasses and\nthe mop of hair, Will Olney, sneered disagreeably at Spencer and repeated\nthe epigram, \"There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is\nhis prophet.\"\n\nBut Martin forgave him the sneer, for he had begun to discover that Olney\nwas not in love with Ruth.  Later, he was dumfounded to learn from\nvarious little happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth, but\nthat he had a positive dislike for her.  Martin could not understand\nthis.  It was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate with all the\nrest of the phenomena in the universe.  But nevertheless he felt sorry\nfor the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that\nprevented him from a proper appreciation of Ruth's fineness and beauty.\nThey rode out into the hills several Sundays on their wheels, and Martin\nhad ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between\nRuth and Olney.  The latter chummed with Norman, throwing Arthur and\nMartin into company with Ruth, for which Martin was duly grateful.\n\nThose Sundays were great days for Martin, greatest because he was with\nRuth, and great, also, because they were putting him more on a par with\nthe young men of her class.  In spite of their long years of disciplined\neducation, he was finding himself their intellectual equal, and the hours\nspent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use\nof the grammar he had studied so hard.  He had abandoned the etiquette\nbooks, falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do.\nExcept when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always on guard,\nkeenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and\nrefinements of conduct.\n\nThe fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source of\nsurprise to Martin.  \"Herbert Spencer,\" said the man at the desk in the\nlibrary, \"oh, yes, a great mind.\"  But the man did not seem to know\nanything of the content of that great mind.  One evening, at dinner, when\nMr. Butler was there, Martin turned the conversation upon Spencer.  Mr.\nMorse bitterly arraigned the English philosopher's agnosticism, but\nconfessed that he had not read \"First Principles\"; while Mr. Butler\nstated that he had no patience with Spencer, had never read a line of\nhim, and had managed to get along quite well without him.  Doubts arose\nin Martin's mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would have\naccepted the general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up.  As it was, he\nfound Spencer's explanation of things convincing; and, as he phrased it\nto himself, to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a navigator\nthrowing the compass and chronometer overboard.  So Martin went on into a\nthorough study of evolution, mastering more and more the subject himself,\nand being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand\nindependent writers.  The more he studied, the more vistas he caught of\nfields of knowledge yet unexplored, and the regret that days were only\ntwenty-four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.\n\nOne day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra\nand geometry.  Trigonometry he had not even attempted.  Then he cut\nchemistry from his study-list, retaining only physics.\n\n\"I am not a specialist,\" he said, in defence, to Ruth.  \"Nor am I going\nto try to be a specialist.  There are too many special fields for any one\nman, in a whole lifetime, to master a tithe of them.  I must pursue\ngeneral knowledge.  When I need the work of specialists, I shall refer to\ntheir books.\"\n\n\"But that is not like having the knowledge yourself,\" she protested.\n\n\"But it is unnecessary to have it.  We profit from the work of the\nspecialists.  That's what they are for.  When I came in, I noticed the\nchimney-sweeps at work.  They're specialists, and when they get done, you\nwill enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the construction\nof chimneys.\"\n\n\"That's far-fetched, I am afraid.\"\n\nShe looked at him curiously, and he felt a reproach in her gaze and\nmanner.  But he was convinced of the rightness of his position.\n\n\"All thinkers on general subjects, the greatest minds in the world, in\nfact, rely on the specialists.  Herbert Spencer did that.  He generalized\nupon the findings of thousands of investigators.  He would have had to\nlive a thousand lives in order to do it all himself.  And so with Darwin.\nHe took advantage of all that had been learned by the florists and cattle-\nbreeders.\"\n\n\"You're right, Martin,\" Olney said.  \"You know what you're after, and\nRuth doesn't.  She doesn't know what she is after for herself even.\"\n\n\"--Oh, yes,\" Olney rushed on, heading off her objection, \"I know you call\nit general culture.  But it doesn't matter what you study if you want\ngeneral culture.  You can study French, or you can study German, or cut\nthem both out and study Esperanto, you'll get the culture tone just the\nsame.  You can study Greek or Latin, too, for the same purpose, though it\nwill never be any use to you.  It will be culture, though.  Why, Ruth\nstudied Saxon, became clever in it,--that was two years ago,--and all\nthat she remembers of it now is 'Whan that sweet Aprile with his schowers\nsoote'--isn't that the way it goes?\"\n\n\"But it's given you the culture tone just the same,\" he laughed, again\nheading her off.  \"I know.  We were in the same classes.\"\n\n\"But you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something,\" Ruth\ncried out.  Her eyes were flashing, and in her cheeks were two spots of\ncolor.  \"Culture is the end in itself.\"\n\n\"But that is not what Martin wants.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"What do you want, Martin?\" Olney demanded, turning squarely upon him.\n\nMartin felt very uncomfortable, and looked entreaty at Ruth.\n\n\"Yes, what do you want?\" Ruth asked.  \"That will settle it.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, I want culture,\" Martin faltered.  \"I love beauty, and\nculture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of beauty.\"\n\nShe nodded her head and looked triumph.\n\n\"Rot, and you know it,\" was Olney's comment.  \"Martin's after career, not\nculture.  It just happens that culture, in his case, is incidental to\ncareer.  If he wanted to be a chemist, culture would be unnecessary.\nMartin wants to write, but he's afraid to say so because it will put you\nin the wrong.\"\n\n\"And why does Martin want to write?\" he went on.  \"Because he isn't\nrolling in wealth.  Why do you fill your head with Saxon and general\nculture?  Because you don't have to make your way in the world.  Your\nfather sees to that.  He buys your clothes for you, and all the rest.\nWhat rotten good is our education, yours and mine and Arthur's and\nNorman's?  We're soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went broke\nto-day, we'd be falling down to-morrow on teachers' examinations.  The\nbest job you could get, Ruth, would be a country school or music teacher\nin a girls' boarding-school.\"\n\n\"And pray what would you do?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not a blessed thing.  I could earn a dollar and a half a day, common\nlabor, and I might get in as instructor in Hanley's cramming joint--I say\nmight, mind you, and I might be chucked out at the end of the week for\nsheer inability.\"\n\nMartin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that\nOlney was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded\nRuth.  A new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened.  Reason\nhad nothing to do with love.  It mattered not whether the woman he loved\nreasoned correctly or incorrectly.  Love was above reason.  If it just\nhappened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a career,\nthat did not make her a bit less lovable.  She was all lovable, and what\nshe thought had nothing to do with her lovableness.\n\n\"What's that?\" he replied to a question from Olney that broke in upon his\ntrain of thought.\n\n\"I was saying that I hoped you wouldn't be fool enough to tackle Latin.\"\n\n\"But Latin is more than culture,\" Ruth broke in.  \"It is equipment.\"\n\n\"Well, are you going to tackle it?\" Olney persisted.\n\nMartin was sore beset.  He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly upon\nhis answer.\n\n\"I am afraid I won't have time,\" he said finally.  \"I'd like to, but I\nwon't have time.\"\n\n\"You see, Martin's not seeking culture,\" Olney exulted.  \"He's trying to\nget somewhere, to do something.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it's mental training.  It's mind discipline.  It's what makes\ndisciplined minds.\"  Ruth looked expectantly at Martin, as if waiting for\nhim to change his judgment.  \"You know, the foot-ball players have to\ntrain before the big game.  And that is what Latin does for the thinker.\nIt trains.\"\n\n\"Rot and bosh!  That's what they told us when we were kids.  But there is\none thing they didn't tell us then.  They let us find it out for\nourselves afterwards.\"  Olney paused for effect, then added, \"And what\nthey didn't tell us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin,\nbut that no gentleman should know Latin.\"\n\n\"Now that's unfair,\" Ruth cried.  \"I knew you were turning the\nconversation just in order to get off something.\"\n\n\"It's clever all right,\" was the retort, \"but it's fair, too.  The only\nmen who know their Latin are the apothecaries, the lawyers, and the Latin\nprofessors.  And if Martin wants to be one of them, I miss my guess.  But\nwhat's all that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway?  Martin's just\ndiscovered Spencer, and he's wild over him.  Why?  Because Spencer is\ntaking him somewhere.  Spencer couldn't take me anywhere, nor you.  We\nhaven't got anywhere to go.  You'll get married some day, and I'll have\nnothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will\ntake care of the money my father's going to leave me.\"\n\nOnley got up to go, but turned at the door and delivered a parting shot.\n\n\"You leave Martin alone, Ruth.  He knows what's best for himself.  Look\nat what he's done already.  He makes me sick sometimes, sick and ashamed\nof myself.  He knows more now about the world, and life, and man's place,\nand all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for that\nmatter, and in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and\nculture.\"\n\n\"But Ruth is my teacher,\" Martin answered chivalrously.  \"She is\nresponsible for what little I have learned.\"\n\n\"Rats!\"  Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression was malicious.  \"I\nsuppose you'll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her\nrecommendation--only you didn't.  And she doesn't know anything more\nabout Darwin and evolution than I do about King Solomon's mines.  What's\nthat jawbreaker definition about something or other, of Spencer's, that\nyou sprang on us the other day--that indefinite, incoherent homogeneity\nthing?  Spring it on her, and see if she understands a word of it.  That\nisn't culture, you see.  Well, tra la, and if you tackle Latin, Martin, I\nwon't have any respect for you.\"\n\nAnd all the while, interested in the discussion, Martin had been aware of\nan irk in it as well.  It was about studies and lessons, dealing with the\nrudiments of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with\nthe big things that were stirring in him--with the grip upon life that\nwas even then crooking his fingers like eagle's talons, with the cosmic\nthrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness of\nmastery of it all.  He likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the shores\nof a strange land, filled with power of beauty, stumbling and stammering\nand vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric tongue of his brethren\nin the new land.  And so with him.  He was alive, painfully alive, to the\ngreat universal things, and yet he was compelled to potter and grope\namong schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should study Latin.\n\n\"What in hell has Latin to do with it?\" he demanded before his mirror\nthat night.  \"I wish dead people would stay dead.  Why should I and the\nbeauty in me be ruled by the dead?  Beauty is alive and everlasting.\nLanguages come and go.  They are the dust of the dead.\"\n\nAnd his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well,\nand he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion\nwhen he was with Ruth.  He was only a schoolboy, with a schoolboy's\ntongue, when he was in her presence.\n\n\"Give me time,\" he said aloud.  \"Only give me time.\"\n\nTime!  Time!  Time! was his unending plaint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nIt was not because of Olney, but in spite of Ruth, and his love for Ruth,\nthat he finally decided not to take up Latin.  His money meant time.\nThere was so much that was more important than Latin, so many studies\nthat clamored with imperious voices.  And he must write.  He must earn\nmoney.  He had had no acceptances.  Twoscore of manuscripts were\ntravelling the endless round of the magazines.  How did the others do it?\nHe spent long hours in the free reading-room, going over what others had\nwritten, studying their work eagerly and critically, comparing it with\nhis own, and wondering, wondering, about the secret trick they had\ndiscovered which enabled them to sell their work.\n\nHe was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead.  No\nlight, no life, no color, was shot through it.  There was no breath of\nlife in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a\nthousand--the newspaper clipping had said so.  He was puzzled by\ncountless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed, but\nwithout vitality or reality.  Life was so strange and wonderful, filled\nwith an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils, and yet\nthese stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life.  He felt the\nstress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild\ninsurgences--surely this was the stuff to write about!  He wanted to\nglorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that\nfought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life\ncrackle with the strength of their endeavor.  And yet the magazine short\nstories seemed intent on glorifying the Mr. Butlers, the sordid dollar-\nchasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace little\nmen and women.  Was it because the editors of the magazines were\ncommonplace? he demanded.  Or were they afraid of life, these writers and\neditors and readers?\n\nBut his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers.\nAnd not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody\nwho had ever attempted to write.  There was nobody to tell him, to hint\nto him, to give him the least word of advice.  He began to doubt that\neditors were real men.  They seemed cogs in a machine.  That was what it\nwas, a machine.  He poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems,\nand intrusted them to the machine.  He folded them just so, put the\nproper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript, sealed\nthe envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the mail-box.\nIt travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of time the\npostman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the\noutside of which were the stamps he had enclosed.  There was no human\neditor at the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that\nchanged the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the\nstamps.  It was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies, and,\nwith a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of\nchewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate.  It depended upon which slot one\ndropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate or gum.  And so with the\neditorial machine.  One slot brought checks and the other brought\nrejection slips.  So far he had found only the latter slot.\n\nIt was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of\nthe process.  These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had\nreceived hundreds of them--as many as a dozen or more on each of his\nearlier manuscripts.  If he had received one line, one personal line,\nalong with one rejection of all his rejections, he would have been\ncheered.  But not one editor had given that proof of existence.  And he\ncould conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end,\nonly mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.\n\nHe was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have been\ncontent to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was bleeding to\ndeath, and not years but weeks would determine the fight.  Each week his\nboard bill brought him nearer destruction, while the postage on forty\nmanuscripts bled him almost as severely.  He no longer bought books, and\nhe economized in petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end;\nthough he did not know how to economize, and brought the end nearer by a\nweek when he gave his sister Marian five dollars for a dress.\n\nHe struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement, and in\nthe teeth of discouragement.  Even Gertrude was beginning to look\naskance.  At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she\nconceived to be his foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude, she\ngrew anxious.  To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a\nmadness.  Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from the\nopen and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham.  Martin had faith in\nhimself, but he was alone in this faith.  Not even Ruth had faith.  She\nhad wanted him to devote himself to study, and, though she had not openly\ndisapproved of his writing, she had never approved.\n\nHe had never offered to show her his work.  A fastidious delicacy had\nprevented him.  Besides, she had been studying heavily at the university,\nand he felt averse to robbing her of her time.  But when she had taken\nher degree, she asked him herself to let her see something of what he had\nbeen doing.  Martin was elated and diffident.  Here was a judge.  She was\na bachelor of arts.  She had studied literature under skilled\ninstructors.  Perhaps the editors were capable judges, too.  But she\nwould be different from them.  She would not hand him a stereotyped\nrejection slip, nor would she inform him that lack of preference for his\nwork did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work.  She would\ntalk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way, and, most important\nof all, she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden.  In his work\nshe would discern what his heart and soul were like, and she would come\nto understand something, a little something, of the stuff of his dreams\nand the strength of his power.\n\nMartin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories,\nhesitated a moment, then added his \"Sea Lyrics.\"  They mounted their\nwheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills.  It was the\nsecond time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along\nthrough the balmy warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing\ncoolness, he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very\nbeautiful and well-ordered world and that it was good to be alive and to\nlove.  They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the brown\ntop of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest breath\nof dry sweetness and content.\n\n\"Its work is done,\" Martin said, as they seated themselves, she upon his\ncoat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth.  He sniffed the sweetness\nof the tawny grass, which entered his brain and set his thoughts whirling\non from the particular to the universal.  \"It has achieved its reason for\nexistence,\" he went on, patting the dry grass affectionately.  \"It\nquickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter, fought\nthe violent early spring, flowered, and lured the insects and the bees,\nscattered its seeds, squared itself with its duty and the world, and--\"\n\n\"Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes?\"\nshe interrupted.\n\n\"Because I've been studying evolution, I guess.  It's only recently that\nI got my eyesight, if the truth were told.\"\n\n\"But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical, that\nyou destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down\noff their beautiful wings.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Beauty has significance, but I never knew its significance before.  I\njust accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something that was just\nbeautiful without rhyme or reason.  I did not know anything about beauty.\nBut now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know.  This grass is\nmore beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all the hidden\nchemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass.  Why,\nthere is romance in the life-history of any grass, yes, and adventure,\ntoo.  The very thought of it stirs me.  When I think of the play of force\nand matter, and all the tremendous struggle of it, I feel as if I could\nwrite an epic on the grass.\n\n\"How well you talk,\" she said absently, and he noted that she was looking\nat him in a searching way.\n\nHe was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant, the blood flushing\nred on his neck and brow.\n\n\"I hope I am learning to talk,\" he stammered.  \"There seems to be so much\nin me I want to say.  But it is all so big.  I can't find ways to say\nwhat is really in me.  Sometimes it seems to me that all the world, all\nlife, everything, had taken up residence inside of me and was clamoring\nfor me to be the spokesman.  I feel--oh, I can't describe it--I feel the\nbigness of it, but when I speak, I babble like a little child.  It is a\ngreat task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech, written or\nspoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens, transmute itself\nback into the selfsame feeling and sensation.  It is a lordly task.  See,\nI bury my face in the grass, and the breath I draw in through my nostrils\nsets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and fancies.  It is a breath\nof the universe I have breathed.  I know song and laughter, and success\nand pain, and struggle and death; and I see visions that arise in my\nbrain somehow out of the scent of the grass, and I would like to tell\nthem to you, to the world.  But how can I?  My tongue is tied.  I have\ntried, by the spoken word, just now, to describe to you the effect on me\nof the scent of the grass.  But I have not succeeded.  I have no more\nthan hinted in awkward speech.  My words seem gibberish to me.  And yet I\nam stifled with desire to tell.  Oh!--\" he threw up his hands with a\ndespairing gesture--\"it is impossible!  It is not understandable!  It is\nincommunicable!\"\n\n\"But you do talk well,\" she insisted.  \"Just think how you have improved\nin the short time I have known you.  Mr. Butler is a noted public\nspeaker.  He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump\nduring campaign.  Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at\ndinner.  Only he was more controlled.  You get too excited; but you will\nget over that with practice.  Why, you would make a good public speaker.\nYou can go far--if you want to.  You are masterly.  You can lead men, I\nam sure, and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything\nyou set your hand to, just as you have succeeded with grammar.  You would\nmake a good lawyer.  You should shine in politics.  There is nothing to\nprevent you from making as great a success as Mr. Butler has made.  And\nminus the dyspepsia,\" she added with a smile.\n\nThey talked on; she, in her gently persistent way, returning always to\nthe need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of\nLatin as part of the foundation for any career.  She drew her ideal of\nthe successful man, and it was largely in her father's image, with a few\nunmistakable lines and touches of color from the image of Mr. Butler.  He\nlistened eagerly, with receptive ears, lying on his back and looking up\nand joying in each movement of her lips as she talked.  But his brain was\nnot receptive.  There was nothing alluring in the pictures she drew, and\nhe was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a sharper ache of\nlove for her.  In all she said there was no mention of his writing, and\nthe manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected on the ground.\n\nAt last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun, measured its height above the\nhorizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.\n\n\"I had forgotten,\" she said quickly.  \"And I am so anxious to hear.\"\n\nHe read to her a story, one that he flattered himself was among his very\nbest.  He called it \"The Wine of Life,\" and the wine of it, that had\nstolen into his brain when he wrote it, stole into his brain now as he\nread it.  There was a certain magic in the original conception, and he\nhad adorned it with more magic of phrase and touch.  All the old fire and\npassion with which he had written it were reborn in him, and he was\nswayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of it.\nBut it was not so with Ruth.  Her trained ear detected the weaknesses and\nexaggerations, the overemphasis of the tyro, and she was instantly aware\neach time the sentence-rhythm tripped and faltered.  She scarcely noted\nthe rhythm otherwise, except when it became too pompous, at which moments\nshe was disagreeably impressed with its amateurishness.  That was her\nfinal judgment on the story as a whole--amateurish, though she did not\ntell him so.  Instead, when he had done, she pointed out the minor flaws\nand said that she liked the story.\n\nBut he was disappointed.  Her criticism was just.  He acknowledged that,\nbut he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the\npurpose of schoolroom correction.  The details did not matter.  They\ncould take care of themselves.  He could mend them, he could learn to\nmend them.  Out of life he had captured something big and attempted to\nimprison it in the story.  It was the big thing out of life he had read\nto her, not sentence-structure and semicolons.  He wanted her to feel\nwith him this big thing that was his, that he had seen with his own eyes,\ngrappled with his own brain, and placed there on the page with his own\nhands in printed words.  Well, he had failed, was his secret decision.\nPerhaps the editors were right.  He had felt the big thing, but he had\nfailed to transmute it.  He concealed his disappointment, and joined so\neasily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down\nin him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement.\n\n\"This next thing I've called 'The Pot',\" he said, unfolding the\nmanuscript.  \"It has been refused by four or five magazines now, but\nstill I think it is good.  In fact, I don't know what to think of it,\nexcept that I've caught something there.  Maybe it won't affect you as it\ndoes me.  It's a short thing--only two thousand words.\"\n\n\"How dreadful!\" she cried, when he had finished.  \"It is horrible,\nunutterably horrible!\"\n\nHe noted her pale face, her eyes wide and tense, and her clenched hands,\nwith secret satisfaction.  He had succeeded.  He had communicated the\nstuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain.  It had struck home.  No\nmatter whether she liked it or not, it had gripped her and mastered her,\nmade her sit there and listen and forget details.\n\n\"It is life,\" he said, \"and life is not always beautiful.  And yet,\nperhaps because I am strangely made, I find something beautiful there.  It\nseems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is there--\"\n\n\"But why couldn't the poor woman--\" she broke in disconnectedly.  Then\nshe left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out: \"Oh!  It is\ndegrading!  It is not nice!  It is nasty!\"\n\nFor the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still.  _Nasty_!  He\nhad never dreamed it.  He had not meant it.  The whole sketch stood\nbefore him in letters of fire, and in such blaze of illumination he\nsought vainly for nastiness.  Then his heart began to beat again.  He was\nnot guilty.\n\n\"Why didn't you select a nice subject?\" she was saying.  \"We know there\nare nasty things in the world, but that is no reason--\"\n\nShe talked on in her indignant strain, but he was not following her.  He\nwas smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so\ninnocent, so penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to\nenter into him, driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some\nethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine.\n_We know there are nasty things in the world_!  He cuddled to him the\nnotion of her knowing, and chuckled over it as a love joke.  The next\nmoment, in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail, he sighted the\nwhole sea of life's nastiness that he had known and voyaged over and\nthrough, and he forgave her for not understanding the story.  It was\nthrough no fault of hers that she could not understand.  He thanked God\nthat she had been born and sheltered to such innocence.  But he knew\nlife, its foulness as well as its fairness, its greatness in spite of the\nslime that infested it, and by God he was going to have his say on it to\nthe world.  Saints in heaven--how could they be anything but fair and\npure?  No praise to them.  But saints in slime--ah, that was the\neverlasting wonder!  That was what made life worth while.  To see moral\ngrandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity; to rise himself and first\nglimpse beauty, faint and far, through mud-dripping eyes; to see out of\nweakness, and frailty, and viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness,\narising strength, and truth, and high spiritual endowment--\n\nHe caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering.\n\n\"The tone of it all is low.  And there is so much that is high.  Take 'In\nMemoriam.'\"\n\nHe was impelled to suggest \"Locksley Hall,\" and would have done so, had\nnot his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her, the female\nof his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment, creeping and crawling up\nthe vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries, had emerged on\nthe topmost rung, having become one Ruth, pure, and fair, and divine, and\nwith power to make him know love, and to aspire toward purity, and to\ndesire to taste divinity--him, Martin Eden, who, too, had come up in some\namazing fashion from out of the ruck and the mire and the countless\nmistakes and abortions of unending creation.  There was the romance, and\nthe wonder, and the glory.  There was the stuff to write, if he could\nonly find speech.  Saints in heaven!--They were only saints and could not\nhelp themselves.  But he was a man.\n\n\"You have strength,\" he could hear her saying, \"but it is untutored\nstrength.\"\n\n\"Like a bull in a china shop,\" he suggested, and won a smile.\n\n\"And you must develop discrimination.  You must consult taste, and\nfineness, and tone.\"\n\n\"I dare too much,\" he muttered.\n\nShe smiled approbation, and settled herself to listen to another story.\n\n\"I don't know what you'll make of this,\" he said apologetically.  \"It's a\nfunny thing.  I'm afraid I got beyond my depth in it, but my intentions\nwere good.  Don't bother about the little features of it.  Just see if\nyou catch the feel of the big thing in it.  It is big, and it is true,\nthough the chance is large that I have failed to make it intelligible.\"\n\nHe read, and as he read he watched her.  At last he had reached her, he\nthought.  She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast upon him, scarcely\nbreathing, caught up and out of herself, he thought, by the witchery of\nthe thing he had created.  He had entitled the story \"Adventure,\" and it\nwas the apotheosis of adventure--not of the adventure of the storybooks,\nbut of real adventure, the savage taskmaster, awful of punishment and\nawful of reward, faithless and whimsical, demanding terrible patience and\nheartbreaking days and nights of toil, offering the blazing sunlight\nglory or dark death at the end of thirst and famine or of the long drag\nand monstrous delirium of rotting fever, through blood and sweat and\nstinging insects leading up by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts\nto royal culminations and lordly achievements.\n\nIt was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story, and it\nwas this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened.  Her eyes\nwere wide, color was in her pale cheeks, and before he finished it seemed\nto him that she was almost panting.  Truly, she was warmed; but she was\nwarmed, not by the story, but by him.  She did not think much of the\nstory; it was Martin's intensity of power, the old excess of strength\nthat seemed to pour from his body and on and over her.  The paradox of it\nwas that it was the story itself that was freighted with his power, that\nwas the channel, for the time being, through which his strength poured\nout to her.  She was aware only of the strength, and not of the medium,\nand when she seemed most carried away by what he had written, in reality\nshe had been carried away by something quite foreign to it--by a thought,\nterrible and perilous, that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain.\nShe had caught herself wondering what marriage was like, and the becoming\nconscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her.\nIt was unmaidenly.  It was not like her.  She had never been tormented by\nwomanhood, and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy, dense\neven to the full significance of that delicate master's delicate\nallusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens\nand knights.  She had been asleep, always, and now life was thundering\nimperatively at all her doors.  Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the\nbolts and drop the bars into place, while wanton instincts urged her to\nthrow wide her portals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter\nin.\n\nMartin waited with satisfaction for her verdict.  He had no doubt of what\nit would be, and he was astounded when he heard her say:\n\n\"It is beautiful.\"\n\n\"It is beautiful,\" she repeated, with emphasis, after a pause.\n\nOf course it was beautiful; but there was something more than mere beauty\nin it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its\nhandmaiden.  He sprawled silently on the ground, watching the grisly form\nof a great doubt rising before him.  He had failed.  He was inarticulate.\nHe had seen one of the greatest things in the world, and he had not\nexpressed it.\n\n\"What did you think of the--\"  He hesitated, abashed at his first attempt\nto use a strange word.  \"Of the _motif_?\" he asked.\n\n\"It was confused,\" she answered.  \"That is my only criticism in the large\nway.  I followed the story, but there seemed so much else.  It is too\nwordy.  You clog the action by introducing so much extraneous material.\"\n\n\"That was the major _motif_,\" he hurriedly explained, \"the big\nunderrunning _motif_, the cosmic and universal thing.  I tried to make it\nkeep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all.  I\nwas on the right scent, but I guess I did it badly.  I did not succeed in\nsuggesting what I was driving at.  But I'll learn in time.\"\n\nShe did not follow him.  She was a bachelor of arts, but he had gone\nbeyond her limitations.  This she did not comprehend, attributing her\nincomprehension to his incoherence.\n\n\"You were too voluble,\" she said.  \"But it was beautiful, in places.\"\n\nHe heard her voice as from far off, for he was debating whether he would\nread her the \"Sea Lyrics.\"  He lay in dull despair, while she watched him\nsearchingly, pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of\nmarriage.\n\n\"You want to be famous?\" she asked abruptly.\n\n\"Yes, a little bit,\" he confessed.  \"That is part of the adventure.  It\nis not the being famous, but the process of becoming so, that counts.  And\nafter all, to be famous would be, for me, only a means to something else.\nI want to be famous very much, for that matter, and for that reason.\"\n\n\"For your sake,\" he wanted to add, and might have added had she proved\nenthusiastic over what he had read to her.\n\nBut she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that would\nat least be possible, to ask what the ultimate something was which he had\nhinted at.  There was no career for him in literature.  Of that she was\nconvinced.  He had proved it to-day, with his amateurish and sophomoric\nproductions.  He could talk well, but he was incapable of expressing\nhimself in a literary way.  She compared Tennyson, and Browning, and her\nfavorite prose masters with him, and to his hopeless discredit.  Yet she\ndid not tell him her whole mind.  Her strange interest in him led her to\ntemporize.  His desire to write was, after all, a little weakness which\nhe would grow out of in time.  Then he would devote himself to the more\nserious affairs of life.  And he would succeed, too.  She knew that.  He\nwas so strong that he could not fail--if only he would drop writing.\n\n\"I wish you would show me all you write, Mr. Eden,\" she said.\n\nHe flushed with pleasure.  She was interested, that much was sure.  And\nat least she had not given him a rejection slip.  She had called certain\nportions of his work beautiful, and that was the first encouragement he\nhad ever received from any one.\n\n\"I will,\" he said passionately.  \"And I promise you, Miss Morse, that I\nwill make good.  I have come far, I know that; and I have far to go, and\nI will cover it if I have to do it on my hands and knees.\"  He held up a\nbunch of manuscript.  \"Here are the 'Sea Lyrics.'  When you get home,\nI'll turn them over to you to read at your leisure.  And you must be sure\nto tell me just what you think of them.  What I need, you know, above all\nthings, is criticism.  And do, please, be frank with me.\"\n\n\"I will be perfectly frank,\" she promised, with an uneasy conviction that\nshe had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be quite\nfrank with him the next time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\n\"The first battle, fought and finished,\" Martin said to the looking-glass\nten days later.  \"But there will be a second battle, and a third battle,\nand battles to the end of time, unless--\"\n\nHe had not finished the sentence, but looked about the mean little room\nand let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts, still\nin their long envelopes, which lay in a corner on the floor.  He had no\nstamps with which to continue them on their travels, and for a week they\nhad been piling up.  More of them would come in on the morrow, and on the\nnext day, and the next, till they were all in.  And he would be unable to\nstart them out again.  He was a month's rent behind on the typewriter,\nwhich he could not pay, having barely enough for the week's board which\nwas due and for the employment office fees.\n\nHe sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully.  There were ink stains\nupon it, and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it.\n\n\"Dear old table,\" he said, \"I've spent some happy hours with you, and\nyou've been a pretty good friend when all is said and done.  You never\nturned me down, never passed me out a reward-of-unmerit rejection slip,\nnever complained about working overtime.\"\n\nHe dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them.  His\nthroat was aching, and he wanted to cry.  It reminded him of his first\nfight, when he was six years old, when he punched away with the tears\nrunning down his cheeks while the other boy, two years his elder, had\nbeaten and pounded him into exhaustion.  He saw the ring of boys, howling\nlike barbarians as he went down at last, writhing in the throes of\nnausea, the blood streaming from his nose and the tears from his bruised\neyes.\n\n\"Poor little shaver,\" he murmured.  \"And you're just as badly licked now.\nYou're beaten to a pulp.  You're down and out.\"\n\nBut the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids, and\nas he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of fights\nwhich had followed.  Six months later Cheese-Face (that was the boy) had\nwhipped him again.  But he had blacked Cheese-Face's eye that time.  That\nwas going some.  He saw them all, fight after fight, himself always\nwhipped and Cheese-Face exulting over him.  But he had never run away.  He\nfelt strengthened by the memory of that.  He had always stayed and taken\nhis medicine.  Cheese-Face had been a little fiend at fighting, and had\nnever once shown mercy to him.  But he had stayed!  He had stayed with\nit!\n\nNext, he saw a narrow alley, between ramshackle frame buildings.  The end\nof the alley was blocked by a one-story brick building, out of which\nissued the rhythmic thunder of the presses, running off the first edition\nof the Enquirer.  He was eleven, and Cheese-Face was thirteen, and they\nboth carried the Enquirer.  That was why they were there, waiting for\ntheir papers.  And, of course, Cheese-Face had picked on him again, and\nthere was another fight that was indeterminate, because at quarter to\nfour the door of the press-room was thrown open and the gang of boys\ncrowded in to fold their papers.\n\n\"I'll lick you to-morrow,\" he heard Cheese-Face promise; and he heard his\nown voice, piping and trembling with unshed tears, agreeing to be there\non the morrow.\n\nAnd he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there\nfirst, and beating Cheese-Face by two minutes.  The other boys said he\nwas all right, and gave him advice, pointing out his faults as a scrapper\nand promising him victory if he carried out their instructions.  The same\nboys gave Cheese-Face advice, too.  How they had enjoyed the fight!  He\npaused in his recollections long enough to envy them the spectacle he and\nCheese-Face had put up.  Then the fight was on, and it went on, without\nrounds, for thirty minutes, until the press-room door was opened.\n\nHe watched the youthful apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying\nfrom school to the Enquirer alley.  He could not walk very fast.  He was\nstiff and lame from the incessant fighting.  His forearms were black and\nblue from wrist to elbow, what of the countless blows he had warded off,\nand here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester.  His head\nand arms and shoulders ached, the small of his back ached,--he ached all\nover, and his brain was heavy and dazed.  He did not play at school.  Nor\ndid he study.  Even to sit still all day at his desk, as he did, was a\ntorment.  It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of daily\nfights, and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite future of\ndaily fights.  Why couldn't Cheese-Face be licked? he often thought; that\nwould put him, Martin, out of his misery.  It never entered his head to\ncease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.\n\nAnd so he dragged himself to the Enquirer alley, sick in body and soul,\nbut learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy, Cheese-\nFace, who was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit if it\nwere not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful\nand necessary.  One afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate efforts\nto annihilate each other according to set rules that did not permit\nkicking, striking below the belt, nor hitting when one was down, Cheese-\nFace, panting for breath and reeling, offered to call it quits.  And\nMartin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he caught of himself, at\nthat moment in the afternoon of long ago, when he reeled and panted and\nchoked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat from\nhis cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face, spitting out a\nmouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out that he would never\nquit, though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted to.  And Cheese-Face\ndid not give in, and the fight went on.\n\nThe next day and the next, days without end, witnessed the afternoon\nfight.  When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained\nexquisitely, and the first few blows, struck and received, racked his\nsoul; after that things grew numb, and he fought on blindly, seeing as in\na dream, dancing and wavering, the large features and burning, animal-\nlike eyes of Cheese-Face.  He concentrated upon that face; all else about\nhim was a whirling void.  There was nothing else in the world but that\nface, and he would never know rest, blessed rest, until he had beaten\nthat face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles, or until the bleeding\nknuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him into a pulp.\nAnd then, one way or the other, he would have rest.  But to quit,--for\nhim, Martin, to quit,--that was impossible!\n\nCame the day when he dragged himself into the Enquirer alley, and there\nwas no Cheese-Face.  Nor did Cheese-Face come.  The boys congratulated\nhim, and told him that he had licked Cheese-Face.  But Martin was not\nsatisfied.  He had not licked Cheese-Face, nor had Cheese-Face licked\nhim.  The problem had not been solved.  It was not until afterward that\nthey learned that Cheese-Face's father had died suddenly that very day.\n\nMartin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven at\nthe Auditorium.  He was seventeen and just back from sea.  A row started.\nSomebody was bullying somebody, and Martin interfered, to be confronted\nby Cheese-Face's blazing eyes.\n\n\"I'll fix you after de show,\" his ancient enemy hissed.\n\nMartin nodded.  The nigger-heaven bouncer was making his way toward the\ndisturbance.\n\n\"I'll meet you outside, after the last act,\" Martin whispered, the while\nhis face showed undivided interest in the buck-and-wing dancing on the\nstage.\n\nThe bouncer glared and went away.\n\n\"Got a gang?\" he asked Cheese-Face, at the end of the act.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Then I got to get one,\" Martin announced.\n\nBetween the acts he mustered his following--three fellows he knew from\nthe nail works, a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the Boo Gang,\nalong with as many more from the dread Eighteen-and-Market Gang.\n\nWhen the theatre let out, the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on\nopposite sides of the street.  When they came to a quiet corner, they\nunited and held a council of war.\n\n\"Eighth Street Bridge is the place,\" said a red-headed fellow belonging\nto Cheese-Face's Gang.  \"You kin fight in the middle, under the electric\nlight, an' whichever way the bulls come in we kin sneak the other way.\"\n\n\"That's agreeable to me,\" Martin said, after consulting with the leaders\nof his own gang.\n\nThe Eighth Street Bridge, crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary, was the\nlength of three city blocks.  In the middle of the bridge, and at each\nend, were electric lights.  No policeman could pass those end-lights\nunseen.  It was the safe place for the battle that revived itself under\nMartin's eyelids.  He saw the two gangs, aggressive and sullen, rigidly\nkeeping apart from each other and backing their respective champions; and\nhe saw himself and Cheese-Face stripping.  A short distance away lookouts\nwere set, their task being to watch the lighted ends of the bridge.  A\nmember of the Boo Gang held Martin's coat, and shirt, and cap, ready to\nrace with them into safety in case the police interfered.  Martin watched\nhimself go into the centre, facing Cheese-Face, and he heard himself say,\nas he held up his hand warningly:-\n\n\"They ain't no hand-shakin' in this.  Understand?  They ain't nothin' but\nscrap.  No throwin' up the sponge.  This is a grudge-fight an' it's to a\nfinish.  Understand?  Somebody's goin' to get licked.\"\n\nCheese-Face wanted to demur,--Martin could see that,--but Cheese-Face's\nold perilous pride was touched before the two gangs.\n\n\"Aw, come on,\" he replied.  \"Wot's the good of chewin' de rag about it?\nI'm wit' cheh to de finish.\"\n\nThen they fell upon each other, like young bulls, in all the glory of\nyouth, with naked fists, with hatred, with desire to hurt, to maim, to\ndestroy.  All the painful, thousand years' gains of man in his upward\nclimb through creation were lost.  Only the electric light remained, a\nmilestone on the path of the great human adventure.  Martin and Cheese-\nFace were two savages, of the stone age, of the squatting place and the\ntree refuge.  They sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss, back into\nthe dregs of the raw beginnings of life, striving blindly and chemically,\nas atoms strive, as the star-dust of the heavens strives, colliding,\nrecoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.\n\n\"God!  We are animals!  Brute-beasts!\"  Martin muttered aloud, as he\nwatched the progress of the fight.  It was to him, with his splendid\npower of vision, like gazing into a kinetoscope.  He was both onlooker\nand participant.  His long months of culture and refinement shuddered at\nthe sight; then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and the\nghosts of the past possessed him, and he was Martin Eden, just returned\nfrom sea and fighting Cheese-Face on the Eighth Street Bridge.  He\nsuffered and toiled and sweated and bled, and exulted when his naked\nknuckles smashed home.\n\nThey were twin whirlwinds of hatred, revolving about each other\nmonstrously.  The time passed, and the two hostile gangs became very\nquiet.  They had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity, and they\nwere awed by it.  The two fighters were greater brutes than they.  The\nfirst splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off, and they\nfought more cautiously and deliberately.  There had been no advantage\ngained either way.  \"It's anybody's fight,\" Martin heard some one saying.\nThen he followed up a feint, right and left, was fiercely countered, and\nfelt his cheek laid open to the bone.  No bare knuckle had done that.  He\nheard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage wrought, and was\ndrenched with his own blood.  But he gave no sign.  He became immensely\nwary, for he was wise with knowledge of the low cunning and foul vileness\nof his kind.  He watched and waited, until he feigned a wild rush, which\nhe stopped midway, for he had seen the glint of metal.\n\n\"Hold up yer hand!\" he screamed.  \"Them's brass knuckles, an' you hit me\nwith 'em!\"\n\nBoth gangs surged forward, growling and snarling.  In a second there\nwould be a free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance.\nHe was beside himself.\n\n\"You guys keep out!\" he screamed hoarsely.  \"Understand?  Say, d'ye\nunderstand?\"\n\nThey shrank away from him.  They were brutes, but he was the arch-brute,\na thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them.\n\n\"This is my scrap, an' they ain't goin' to be no buttin' in.  Gimme them\nknuckles.\"\n\nCheese-Face, sobered and a bit frightened, surrendered the foul weapon.\n\n\"You passed 'em to him, you red-head sneakin' in behind the push there,\"\nMartin went on, as he tossed the knuckles into the water.  \"I seen you,\nan' I was wonderin' what you was up to.  If you try anything like that\nagain, I'll beat cheh to death.  Understand?\"\n\nThey fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion immeasurable\nand inconceivable, until the crowd of brutes, its blood-lust sated,\nterrified by what it saw, begged them impartially to cease.  And Cheese-\nFace, ready to drop and die, or to stay on his legs and die, a grisly\nmonster out of whose features all likeness to Cheese-Face had been\nbeaten, wavered and hesitated; but Martin sprang in and smashed him again\nand again.\n\nNext, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese-Face weakening fast, in\na mix-up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin's right arm dropped\nto his side.  It was a broken bone.  Everybody heard it and knew; and\nCheese-Face knew, rushing like a tiger in the other's extremity and\nraining blow on blow.  Martin's gang surged forward to interfere.  Dazed\nby the rapid succession of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and\nearnest curses sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair.\n\nHe punched on, with his left hand only, and as he punched, doggedly, only\nhalf-conscious, as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear in the\ngangs, and one who said with shaking voice: \"This ain't a scrap, fellows.\nIt's murder, an' we ought to stop it.\"\n\nBut no one stopped it, and he was glad, punching on wearily and endlessly\nwith his one arm, battering away at a bloody something before him that\nwas not a face but a horror, an oscillating, hideous, gibbering, nameless\nthing that persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away.\nAnd he punched on and on, slower and slower, as the last shreds of\nvitality oozed from him, through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses\nof time, until, in a dim way, he became aware that the nameless thing was\nsinking, slowly sinking down to the rough board-planking of the bridge.\nAnd the next moment he was standing over it, staggering and swaying on\nshaky legs, clutching at the air for support, and saying in a voice he\ndid not recognize:-\n\n\"D'ye want any more?  Say, d'ye want any more?\"\n\nHe was still saying it, over and over,--demanding, entreating,\nthreatening, to know if it wanted any more,--when he felt the fellows of\nhis gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying to put\nhis coat on him.  And then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion.\n\nThe tin alarm-clock on the table ticked on, but Martin Eden, his face\nburied on his arms, did not hear it.  He heard nothing.  He did not\nthink.  So absolutely had he relived life that he had fainted just as he\nfainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge.  For a full minute the\nblackness and the blankness endured.  Then, like one from the dead, he\nsprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring down his face, shouting:-\n\n\"I licked you, Cheese-Face!  It took me eleven years, but I licked you!\"\n\nHis knees were trembling under him, he felt faint, and he staggered back\nto the bed, sinking down and sitting on the edge of it.  He was still in\nthe clutch of the past.  He looked about the room, perplexed, alarmed,\nwondering where he was, until he caught sight of the pile of manuscripts\nin the corner.  Then the wheels of memory slipped ahead through four\nyears of time, and he was aware of the present, of the books he had\nopened and the universe he had won from their pages, of his dreams and\nambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl, sensitive and\nsheltered and ethereal, who would die of horror did she witness but one\nmoment of what he had just lived through--one moment of all the muck of\nlife through which he had waded.\n\nHe arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking-glass.\n\n\"And so you arise from the mud, Martin Eden,\" he said solemnly.  \"And you\ncleanse your eyes in a great brightness, and thrust your shoulders among\nthe stars, doing what all life has done, letting the 'ape and tiger die'\nand wresting highest heritage from all powers that be.\"\n\nHe looked more closely at himself and laughed.\n\n\"A bit of hysteria and melodrama, eh?\" he queried.  \"Well, never mind.\nYou licked Cheese-Face, and you'll lick the editors if it takes twice\neleven years to do it in.  You can't stop here.  You've got to go on.\nIt's to a finish, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nThe alarm-clock went off, jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness\nthat would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution.\nThough he slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke\neagerly, glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone.  He hated\nthe oblivion of sleep.  There was too much to do, too much of life to\nlive.  He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of, and before\nthe clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the washbasin\nand thrilling to the cold bite of the water.\n\nBut he did not follow his regular programme.  There was no unfinished\nstory waiting his hand, no new story demanding articulation.  He had\nstudied late, and it was nearly time for breakfast.  He tried to read a\nchapter in Fiske, but his brain was restless and he closed the book.  To-\nday witnessed the beginning of the new battle, wherein for some time\nthere would be no writing.  He was aware of a sadness akin to that with\nwhich one leaves home and family.  He looked at the manuscripts in the\ncorner.  That was it.  He was going away from them, his pitiful,\ndishonored children that were welcome nowhere.  He went over and began to\nrummage among them, reading snatches here and there, his favorite\nportions.  \"The Pot\" he honored with reading aloud, as he did\n\"Adventure.\"  \"Joy,\" his latest-born, completed the day before and tossed\ninto the corner for lack of stamps, won his keenest approbation.\n\n\"I can't understand,\" he murmured.  \"Or maybe it's the editors who can't\nunderstand.  There's nothing wrong with that.  They publish worse every\nmonth.  Everything they publish is worse--nearly everything, anyway.\"\n\nAfter breakfast he put the type-writer in its case and carried it down\ninto Oakland.\n\n\"I owe a month on it,\" he told the clerk in the store.  \"But you tell the\nmanager I'm going to work and that I'll be in in a month or so and\nstraighten up.\"\n\nHe crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an\nemployment office.  \"Any kind of work, no trade,\" he told the agent; and\nwas interrupted by a new-comer, dressed rather foppishly, as some\nworkingmen dress who have instincts for finer things.  The agent shook\nhis head despondently.\n\n\"Nothin' doin' eh?\" said the other.  \"Well, I got to get somebody\nto-day.\"\n\nHe turned and stared at Martin, and Martin, staring back, noted the\npuffed and discolored face, handsome and weak, and knew that he had been\nmaking a night of it.\n\n\"Lookin' for a job?\" the other queried.  \"What can you do?\"\n\n\"Hard labor, sailorizing, run a type-writer, no shorthand, can sit on a\nhorse, willing to do anything and tackle anything,\" was the answer.\n\nThe other nodded.\n\n\"Sounds good to me.  My name's Dawson, Joe Dawson, an' I'm tryin' to\nscare up a laundryman.\"\n\n\"Too much for me.\"  Martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself ironing\nfluffy white things that women wear.  But he had taken a liking to the\nother, and he added: \"I might do the plain washing.  I learned that much\nat sea.\"  Joe Dawson thought visibly for a moment.\n\n\"Look here, let's get together an' frame it up.  Willin' to listen?\"\n\nMartin nodded.\n\n\"This is a small laundry, up country, belongs to Shelly Hot\nSprings,--hotel, you know.  Two men do the work, boss and assistant.  I'm\nthe boss.  You don't work for me, but you work under me.  Think you'd be\nwillin' to learn?\"\n\nMartin paused to think.  The prospect was alluring.  A few months of it,\nand he would have time to himself for study.  He could work hard and\nstudy hard.\n\n\"Good grub an' a room to yourself,\" Joe said.\n\nThat settled it.  A room to himself where he could burn the midnight oil\nunmolested.\n\n\"But work like hell,\" the other added.\n\nMartin caressed his swelling shoulder-muscles significantly.  \"That came\nfrom hard work.\"\n\n\"Then let's get to it.\"  Joe held his hand to his head for a moment.\n\"Gee, but it's a stem-winder.  Can hardly see.  I went down the line last\nnight--everything--everything.  Here's the frame-up.  The wages for two\nis a hundred and board.  I've ben drawin' down sixty, the second man\nforty.  But he knew the biz.  You're green.  If I break you in, I'll be\ndoing plenty of your work at first.  Suppose you begin at thirty, an'\nwork up to the forty.  I'll play fair.  Just as soon as you can do your\nshare you get the forty.\"\n\n\"I'll go you,\" Martin announced, stretching out his hand, which the other\nshook.  \"Any advance?--for rail-road ticket and extras?\"\n\n\"I blew it in,\" was Joe's sad answer, with another reach at his aching\nhead.  \"All I got is a return ticket.\"\n\n\"And I'm broke--when I pay my board.\"\n\n\"Jump it,\" Joe advised.\n\n\"Can't.  Owe it to my sister.\"\n\nJoe whistled a long, perplexed whistle, and racked his brains to little\npurpose.\n\n\"I've got the price of the drinks,\" he said desperately.  \"Come on, an'\nmebbe we'll cook up something.\"\n\nMartin declined.\n\n\"Water-wagon?\"\n\nThis time Martin nodded, and Joe lamented, \"Wish I was.\"\n\n\"But I somehow just can't,\" he said in extenuation.  \"After I've ben\nworkin' like hell all week I just got to booze up.  If I didn't, I'd cut\nmy throat or burn up the premises.  But I'm glad you're on the wagon.\nStay with it.\"\n\nMartin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man--the gulf the\nbooks had made; but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that\ngulf.  He had lived all his life in the working-class world, and the\ncamaraderie of labor was second nature with him.  He solved the\ndifficulty of transportation that was too much for the other's aching\nhead.  He would send his trunk up to Shelly Hot Springs on Joe's ticket.\nAs for himself, there was his wheel.  It was seventy miles, and he could\nride it on Sunday and be ready for work Monday morning.  In the meantime\nhe would go home and pack up.  There was no one to say good-by to.  Ruth\nand her whole family were spending the long summer in the Sierras, at\nLake Tahoe.\n\nHe arrived at Shelly Hot Springs, tired and dusty, on Sunday night.  Joe\ngreeted him exuberantly.  With a wet towel bound about his aching brow,\nhe had been at work all day.\n\n\"Part of last week's washin' mounted up, me bein' away to get you,\" he\nexplained.  \"Your box arrived all right.  It's in your room.  But it's a\nhell of a thing to call a trunk.  An' what's in it?  Gold bricks?\"\n\nJoe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked.  The box was a packing-case for\nbreakfast food, and Mr. Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar for\nit.  Two rope handles, nailed on by Martin, had technically transformed\nit into a trunk eligible for the baggage-car.  Joe watched, with bulging\neyes, a few shirts and several changes of underclothes come out of the\nbox, followed by books, and more books.\n\n\"Books clean to the bottom?\" he asked.\n\nMartin nodded, and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which\nserved in the room in place of a wash-stand.\n\n\"Gee!\" Joe exploded, then waited in silence for the deduction to arise in\nhis brain.  At last it came.\n\n\"Say, you don't care for the girls--much?\" he queried.\n\n\"No,\" was the answer.  \"I used to chase a lot before I tackled the books.\nBut since then there's no time.\"\n\n\"And there won't be any time here.  All you can do is work an' sleep.\"\n\nMartin thought of his five hours' sleep a night, and smiled.  The room\nwas situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the\nengine that pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry\nmachinery.  The engineer, who occupied the adjoining room, dropped in to\nmeet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb, on an\nextension wire, so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over the\ntable to the bed.\n\nThe next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for a\nquarter-to-seven breakfast.  There happened to be a bath-tub for the\nservants in the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by taking a cold\nbath.\n\n\"Gee, but you're a hummer!\" Joe announced, as they sat down to breakfast\nin a corner of the hotel kitchen.\n\nWith them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener, and\ntwo or three men from the stable.  They ate hurriedly and gloomily, with\nbut little conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he realized how\nfar he had travelled from their status.  Their small mental caliber was\ndepressing to him, and he was anxious to get away from them.  So he\nbolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly as they, and\nheaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door.\n\nIt was a perfectly appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most\nmodern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do.\nMartin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled\nclothes, while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft-\nsoap, compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his\nmouth and nostrils and eyes in bath-towels till he resembled a mummy.\nFinished the sorting, Martin lent a hand in wringing the clothes.  This\nwas done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went at a rate\nof a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing the water from the\nclothes by centrifugal force.  Then Martin began to alternate between the\ndryer and the wringer, between times \"shaking out\" socks and stockings.\nBy the afternoon, one feeding and one, stacking up, they were running\nsocks and stockings through the mangle while the irons were heating.  Then\nit was hot irons and underclothes till six o'clock, at which time Joe\nshook his head dubiously.\n\n\"Way behind,\" he said.  \"Got to work after supper.\"  And after supper\nthey worked until ten o'clock, under the blazing electric lights, until\nthe last piece of under-clothing was ironed and folded away in the\ndistributing room.  It was a hot California night, and though the windows\nwere thrown wide, the room, with its red-hot ironing-stove, was a\nfurnace.  Martin and Joe, down to undershirts, bare armed, sweated and\npanted for air.\n\n\"Like trimming cargo in the tropics,\" Martin said, when they went\nupstairs.\n\n\"You'll do,\" Joe answered.  \"You take hold like a good fellow.  If you\nkeep up the pace, you'll be on thirty dollars only one month.  The second\nmonth you'll be gettin' your forty.  But don't tell me you never ironed\nbefore.  I know better.\"\n\n\"Never ironed a rag in my life, honestly, until to-day,\" Martin\nprotested.\n\nHe was surprised at his weariness when he got into his room, forgetful of\nthe fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for\nfourteen hours.  He set the alarm clock at six, and measured back five\nhours to one o'clock.  He could read until then.  Slipping off his shoes,\nto ease his swollen feet, he sat down at the table with his books.  He\nopened Fiske, where he had left off to read.  But he found trouble and began\nto read it through a second time.  Then he awoke, in pain from his\nstiffened muscles and chilled by the mountain wind that had begun to blow\nin through the window.  He looked at the clock.  It marked two.  He had\nbeen asleep four hours.  He pulled off his clothes and crawled into bed,\nwhere he was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow.\n\nTuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil.  The speed with which Joe\nworked won Martin's admiration.  Joe was a dozen of demons for work.  He\nwas keyed up to concert pitch, and there was never a moment in the long\nday when he was not fighting for moments.  He concentrated himself upon\nhis work and upon how to save time, pointing out to Martin where he did\nin five motions what could be done in three, or in three motions what\ncould be done in two.  \"Elimination of waste motion,\" Martin phrased it\nas he watched and patterned after.  He was a good workman himself, quick\nand deft, and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man\nshould do any of his work for him or outwork him.  As a result, he\nconcentrated with a similar singleness of purpose, greedily snapping up\nthe hints and suggestions thrown out by his working mate.  He \"rubbed\nout\" collars and cuffs, rubbing the starch out from between the double\nthicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to\nthe ironing, and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe's praise.\n\nThere was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done.\nJoe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task\nto task.  They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single gathering\nmovement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband, yoke, and\nbosom protruded beyond the circling right hand.  At the same moment the\nleft hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not enter the\nstarch, and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch--starch\nso hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and\nthrust continually, into a bucket of cold water.  And that night they\nworked till half-past ten, dipping \"fancy starch\"--all the frilled and\nairy, delicate wear of ladies.\n\n\"Me for the tropics and no clothes,\" Martin laughed.\n\n\"And me out of a job,\" Joe answered seriously.  \"I don't know nothin' but\nlaundrying.\"\n\n\"And you know it well.\"\n\n\"I ought to.  Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when I was eleven,\nshakin' out for the mangle.  That was eighteen years ago, an' I've never\ndone a tap of anything else.  But this job is the fiercest I ever had.\nOught to be one more man on it at least.  We work to-morrow night.  Always\nrun the mangle Wednesday nights--collars an' cuffs.\"\n\nMartin set his alarm, drew up to the table, and opened Fiske.  He did not\nfinish the first paragraph.  The lines blurred and ran together and his\nhead nodded.  He walked up and down, batting his head savagely with his\nfists, but he could not conquer the numbness of sleep.  He propped the\nbook before him, and propped his eyelids with his fingers, and fell\nasleep with his eyes wide open.  Then he surrendered, and, scarcely\nconscious of what he did, got off his clothes and into bed.  He slept\nseven hours of heavy, animal-like sleep, and awoke by the alarm, feeling\nthat he had not had enough.\n\n\"Doin' much readin'?\" Joe asked.\n\nMartin shook his head.\n\n\"Never mind.  We got to run the mangle to-night, but Thursday we'll knock\noff at six.  That'll give you a chance.\"\n\nMartin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with strong\nsoft-soap, by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a plunger-\npole that was attached to a spring-pole overhead.\n\n\"My invention,\" Joe said proudly.  \"Beats a washboard an' your knuckles,\nand, besides, it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week, an' fifteen\nminutes ain't to be sneezed at in this shebang.\"\n\nRunning the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe's idea.\nThat night, while they toiled on under the electric lights, he explained\nit.\n\n\"Something no laundry ever does, except this one.  An' I got to do it if\nI'm goin' to get done Saturday afternoon at three o'clock.  But I know\nhow, an' that's the difference.  Got to have right heat, right pressure,\nand run 'em through three times.  Look at that!\"  He held a cuff aloft.\n\"Couldn't do it better by hand or on a tiler.\"\n\nThursday, Joe was in a rage.  A bundle of extra \"fancy starch\" had come\nin.\n\n\"I'm goin' to quit,\" he announced.  \"I won't stand for it.  I'm goin' to\nquit it cold.  What's the good of me workin' like a slave all week, a-\nsavin' minutes, an' them a-comin' an' ringin' in fancy-starch extras on\nme?  This is a free country, an' I'm to tell that fat Dutchman what I\nthink of him.  An' I won't tell 'm in French.  Plain United States is\ngood enough for me.  Him a-ringin' in fancy starch extras!\"\n\n\"We got to work to-night,\" he said the next moment, reversing his\njudgment and surrendering to fate.\n\nAnd Martin did no reading that night.  He had seen no daily paper all\nweek, and, strangely to him, felt no desire to see one.  He was not\ninterested in the news.  He was too tired and jaded to be interested in\nanything, though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon, if they finished\nat three, and ride on his wheel to Oakland.  It was seventy miles, and\nthe same distance back on Sunday afternoon would leave him anything but\nrested for the second week's work.  It would have been easier to go on\nthe train, but the round trip was two dollars and a half, and he was\nintent on saving money.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMartin learned to do many things.  In the course of the first week, in\none afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts.  Joe\nran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string\nwhich furnished the pressure.  By this means he ironed the yoke,\nwristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the\nshirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom.  As fast as he finished\nthem, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught\nthem up and \"backed\" them.  This task consisted of ironing all the\nunstarched portions of the shirts.\n\nIt was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed.  Out\non the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white, sipped\niced drinks and kept their circulation down.  But in the laundry the air\nwas sizzling.  The huge stove roared red hot and white hot, while the\nirons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds of steam.  The heat of\nthese irons was different from that used by housewives.  An iron that\nstood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe and Martin,\nand such test was useless.  They went wholly by holding the irons close\nto their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental process that\nMartin admired but could not understand.  When the fresh irons proved too\nhot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water.  This\nagain required a precise and subtle judgment.  A fraction of a second too\nlong in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was\nlost, and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed--an\nautomatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and\nunerring.\n\nBut there was little time in which to marvel.  All Martin's consciousness\nwas concentrated in the work.  Ceaselessly active, head and hand, an\nintelligent machine, all that constituted him a man was devoted to\nfurnishing that intelligence.  There was no room in his brain for the\nuniverse and its mighty problems.  All the broad and spacious corridors\nof his mind were closed and hermetically sealed.  The echoing chamber of\nhis soul was a narrow room, a conning tower, whence were directed his arm\nand shoulder muscles, his ten nimble fingers, and the swift-moving iron\nalong its steaming path in broad, sweeping strokes, just so many strokes\nand no more, just so far with each stroke and not a fraction of an inch\nfarther, rushing along interminable sleeves, sides, backs, and tails, and\ntossing the finished shirts, without rumpling, upon the receiving frame.\nAnd even as his hurrying soul tossed, it was reaching for another shirt.\nThis went on, hour after hour, while outside all the world swooned under\nthe overhead California sun.  But there was no swooning in that\nsuperheated room.  The cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen.\n\nThe sweat poured from Martin.  He drank enormous quantities of water, but\nso great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the water\nsluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores.\nAlways, at sea, except at rare intervals, the work he performed had given\nhim ample opportunity to commune with himself.  The master of the ship\nhad been lord of Martin's time; but here the manager of the hotel was\nlord of Martin's thoughts as well.  He had no thoughts save for the nerve-\nracking, body-destroying toil.  Outside of that it was impossible to\nthink.  He did not know that he loved Ruth.  She did not even exist, for\nhis driven soul had no time to remember her.  It was only when he crawled\nto bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning, that she asserted\nherself to him in fleeting memories.\n\n\"This is hell, ain't it?\" Joe remarked once.\n\nMartin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation.  The statement had been\nobvious and unnecessary.  They did not talk while they worked.\nConversation threw them out of their stride, as it did this time,\ncompelling Martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra\nmotions before he caught his stride again.\n\nOn Friday morning the washer ran.  Twice a week they had to put through\nhotel linen,--the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and\nnapkins.  This finished, they buckled down to \"fancy starch.\"  It was\nslow work, fastidious and delicate, and Martin did not learn it so\nreadily.  Besides, he could not take chances.  Mistakes were disastrous.\n\n\"See that,\" Joe said, holding up a filmy corset-cover that he could have\ncrumpled from view in one hand.  \"Scorch that an' it's twenty dollars out\nof your wages.\"\n\nSo Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension,\nthough nervous tension rose higher than ever, and he listened\nsympathetically to the other's blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over\nthe beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do their\nown laundrying.  \"Fancy starch\" was Martin's nightmare, and it was Joe's,\ntoo.  It was \"fancy starch\" that robbed them of their hard-won minutes.\nThey toiled at it all day.  At seven in the evening they broke off to run\nthe hotel linen through the mangle.  At ten o'clock, while the hotel\nguests slept, the two laundrymen sweated on at \"fancy starch\" till\nmidnight, till one, till two.  At half-past two they knocked off.\n\nSaturday morning it was \"fancy starch,\" and odds and ends, and at three\nin the afternoon the week's work was done.\n\n\"You ain't a-goin' to ride them seventy miles into Oakland on top of\nthis?\" Joe demanded, as they sat on the stairs and took a triumphant\nsmoke.\n\n\"Got to,\" was the answer.\n\n\"What are you goin' for?--a girl?\"\n\n\"No; to save two and a half on the railroad ticket.  I want to renew some\nbooks at the library.\"\n\n\"Why don't you send 'em down an' up by express?  That'll cost only a\nquarter each way.\"\n\nMartin considered it.\n\n\"An' take a rest to-morrow,\" the other urged.  \"You need it.  I know I\ndo.  I'm plumb tuckered out.\"\n\nHe looked it.  Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds and\nminutes all week, circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles, a\nfount of resistless energy, a high-driven human motor, a demon for work,\nnow that he had accomplished the week's task he was in a state of\ncollapse.  He was worn and haggard, and his handsome face drooped in lean\nexhaustion.  He pulled his cigarette spiritlessly, and his voice was\npeculiarly dead and monotonous.  All the snap and fire had gone out of\nhim.  His triumph seemed a sorry one.\n\n\"An' next week we got to do it all over again,\" he said sadly.  \"An'\nwhat's the good of it all, hey?  Sometimes I wish I was a hobo.  They\ndon't work, an' they get their livin'.  Gee!  I wish I had a glass of\nbeer; but I can't get up the gumption to go down to the village an' get\nit.  You'll stay over, an' send your books dawn by express, or else\nyou're a damn fool.\"\n\n\"But what can I do here all day Sunday?\" Martin asked.\n\n\"Rest.  You don't know how tired you are.  Why, I'm that tired Sunday I\ncan't even read the papers.  I was sick once--typhoid.  In the hospital\ntwo months an' a half.  Didn't do a tap of work all that time.  It was\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"It was beautiful,\" he repeated dreamily, a minute later.\n\nMartin took a bath, after which he found that the head laundryman had\ndisappeared.  Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin decided,\nbut the half-mile walk down to the village to find out seemed a long\njourney to him.  He lay on his bed with his shoes off, trying to make up\nhis mind.  He did not reach out for a book.  He was too tired to feel\nsleepy, and he lay, scarcely thinking, in a semi-stupor of weariness,\nuntil it was time for supper.  Joe did not appear for that function, and\nwhen Martin heard the gardener remark that most likely he was ripping the\nslats off the bar, Martin understood.  He went to bed immediately\nafterward, and in the morning decided that he was greatly rested.  Joe\nbeing still absent, Martin procured a Sunday paper and lay down in a\nshady nook under the trees.  The morning passed, he knew not how.  He did\nnot sleep, nobody disturbed him, and he did not finish the paper.  He\ncame back to it in the afternoon, after dinner, and fell asleep over it.\n\nSo passed Sunday, and Monday morning he was hard at work, sorting\nclothes, while Joe, a towel bound tightly around his head, with groans\nand blasphemies, was running the washer and mixing soft-soap.\n\n\"I simply can't help it,\" he explained.  \"I got to drink when Saturday\nnight comes around.\"\n\nAnother week passed, a great battle that continued under the electric\nlights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three\no'clock, when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted\ndown to the village to forget.  Martin's Sunday was the same as before.\nHe slept in the shade of the trees, toiled aimlessly through the\nnewspaper, and spent long hours lying on his back, doing nothing,\nthinking nothing.  He was too dazed to think, though he was aware that he\ndid not like himself.  He was self-repelled, as though he had undergone\nsome degradation or was intrinsically foul.  All that was god-like in him\nwas blotted out.  The spur of ambition was blunted; he had no vitality\nwith which to feel the prod of it.  He was dead.  His soul seemed dead.\nHe was a beast, a work-beast.  He saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting\ndown through the green leaves, nor did the azure vault of the sky whisper\nas of old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets trembling to\ndisclosure.  Life was intolerably dull and stupid, and its taste was bad\nin his mouth.  A black screen was drawn across his mirror of inner\nvision, and fancy lay in a darkened sick-room where entered no ray of\nlight.  He envied Joe, down in the village, rampant, tearing the slats\noff the bar, his brain gnawing with maggots, exulting in maudlin ways\nover maudlin things, fantastically and gloriously drunk and forgetful of\nMonday morning and the week of deadening toil to come.\n\nA third week went by, and Martin loathed himself, and loathed life.  He\nwas oppressed by a sense of failure.  There was reason for the editors\nrefusing his stuff.  He could see that clearly now, and laugh at himself\nand the dreams he had dreamed.  Ruth returned his \"Sea Lyrics\" by mail.\nHe read her letter apathetically.  She did her best to say how much she\nliked them and that they were beautiful.  But she could not lie, and she\ncould not disguise the truth from herself.  She knew they were failures,\nand he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic line\nof her letter.  And she was right.  He was firmly convinced of it as he\nread the poems over.  Beauty and wonder had departed from him, and as he\nread the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in mind\nwhen he wrote them.  His audacities of phrase struck him as grotesque,\nhis felicities of expression were monstrosities, and everything was\nabsurd, unreal, and impossible.  He would have burned the \"Sea Lyrics\" on\nthe spot, had his will been strong enough to set them aflame.  There was\nthe engine-room, but the exertion of carrying them to the furnace was not\nworth while.  All his exertion was used in washing other persons'\nclothes.  He did not have any left for private affairs.\n\nHe resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together and\nanswer Ruth's letter.  But Saturday afternoon, after work was finished\nand he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him.  \"I guess\nI'll go down and see how Joe's getting on,\" was the way he put it to\nhimself; and in the same moment he knew that he lied.  But he did not\nhave the energy to consider the lie.  If he had had the energy, he would\nhave refused to consider the lie, because he wanted to forget.  He\nstarted for the village slowly and casually, increasing his pace in spite\nof himself as he neared the saloon.\n\n\"I thought you was on the water-wagon,\" was Joe's greeting.\n\nMartin did not deign to offer excuses, but called for whiskey, filling\nhis own glass brimming before he passed the bottle.\n\n\"Don't take all night about it,\" he said roughly.\n\nThe other was dawdling with the bottle, and Martin refused to wait for\nhim, tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it.\n\n\"Now, I can wait for you,\" he said grimly; \"but hurry up.\"\n\nJoe hurried, and they drank together.\n\n\"The work did it, eh?\" Joe queried.\n\nMartin refused to discuss the matter.\n\n\"It's fair hell, I know,\" the other went on, \"but I kind of hate to see\nyou come off the wagon, Mart.  Well, here's how!\"\n\nMartin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and awing\nthe barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and\nhair parted in the middle.\n\n\"It's something scandalous the way they work us poor devils,\" Joe was\nremarking.  \"If I didn't bowl up, I'd break loose an' burn down the\nshebang.  My bowlin' up is all that saves 'em, I can tell you that.\"\n\nBut Martin made no answer.  A few more drinks, and in his brain he felt\nthe maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl.  Ah, it was living, the\nfirst breath of life he had breathed in three weeks.  His dreams came\nback to him.  Fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on, a\nthing of flaming brightness.  His mirror of vision was silver-clear, a\nflashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery.  Wonder and beauty walked with\nhim, hand in hand, and all power was his.  He tried to tell it to Joe,\nbut Joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes whereby he would\nescape the slavery of laundry-work and become himself the owner of a\ngreat steam laundry.\n\n\"I tell yeh, Mart, they won't be no kids workin' in my laundry--not on\nyer life.  An' they won't be no workin' a livin' soul after six P.M.  You\nhear me talk!  They'll be machinery enough an' hands enough to do it all\nin decent workin' hours, an' Mart, s'help me, I'll make yeh\nsuperintendent of the shebang--the whole of it, all of it.  Now here's\nthe scheme.  I get on the water-wagon an' save my money for two\nyears--save an' then--\"\n\nBut Martin turned away, leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper, until\nthat worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who, coming\nin, accepted Martin's invitation.  Martin dispensed royal largess,\ninviting everybody up, farm-hands, a stableman, and the gardener's\nassistant from the hotel, the barkeeper, and the furtive hobo who slid in\nlike a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end of the bar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMonday morning, Joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes to the\nwasher.\n\n\"I say,\" he began.\n\n\"Don't talk to me,\" Martin snarled.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Joe,\" he said at noon, when they knocked off for dinner.\n\nTears came into the other's eyes.\n\n\"That's all right, old man,\" he said.  \"We're in hell, an' we can't help\nourselves.  An', you know, I kind of like you a whole lot.  That's what\nmade it--hurt.  I cottoned to you from the first.\"\n\nMartin shook his hand.\n\n\"Let's quit,\" Joe suggested.  \"Let's chuck it, an' go hoboin'.  I ain't\nnever tried it, but it must be dead easy.  An' nothin' to do.  Just think\nof it, nothin' to do.  I was sick once, typhoid, in the hospital, an' it\nwas beautiful.  I wish I'd get sick again.\"\n\nThe week dragged on.  The hotel was full, and extra \"fancy starch\" poured\nin upon them.  They performed prodigies of valor.  They fought late each\nnight under the electric lights, bolted their meals, and even got in a\nhalf hour's work before breakfast.  Martin no longer took his cold baths.\nEvery moment was drive, drive, drive, and Joe was the masterful shepherd\nof moments, herding them carefully, never losing one, counting them over\nlike a miser counting gold, working on in a frenzy, toil-mad, a feverish\nmachine, aided ably by that other machine that thought of itself as once\nhaving been one Martin Eden, a man.\n\nBut it was only at rare moments that Martin was able to think.  The house\nof thought was closed, its windows boarded up, and he was its shadowy\ncaretaker.  He was a shadow.  Joe was right.  They were both shadows, and\nthis was the unending limbo of toil.  Or was it a dream?  Sometimes, in\nthe steaming, sizzling heat, as he swung the heavy irons back and forth\nover the white garments, it came to him that it was a dream.  In a short\nwhile, or maybe after a thousand years or so, he would awake, in his\nlittle room with the ink-stained table, and take up his writing where he\nhad left off the day before.  Or maybe that was a dream, too, and the\nawakening would be the changing of the watches, when he would drop down\nout of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck, under the\ntropic stars, and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing\nthrough his flesh.\n\nCame Saturday and its hollow victory at three o'clock.\n\n\"Guess I'll go down an' get a glass of beer,\" Joe said, in the queer,\nmonotonous tones that marked his week-end collapse.\n\nMartin seemed suddenly to wake up.  He opened the kit bag and oiled his\nwheel, putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings.  Joe was\nhalfway down to the saloon when Martin passed by, bending low over the\nhandle-bars, his legs driving the ninety-six gear with rhythmic strength,\nhis face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust.  He slept in\nOakland that night, and on Sunday covered the seventy miles back.  And on\nMonday morning, weary, he began the new week's work, but he had kept\nsober.\n\nA fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled as a\nmachine, with just a spark of something more in him, just a glimmering\nbit of soul, that compelled him, at each week-end, to scorch off the\nhundred and forty miles.  But this was not rest.  It was\nsuper-machinelike, and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of soul\nthat was all that was left him from former life.  At the end of the\nseventh week, without intending it, too weak to resist, he drifted down\nto the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday\nmorning.\n\nAgain, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles,\nobliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still\ngreater exertion.  At the end of three months he went down a third time\nto the village with Joe.  He forgot, and lived again, and, living, he\nsaw, in clear illumination, the beast he was making of himself--not by\nthe drink, but by the work.  The drink was an effect, not a cause.  It\nfollowed inevitably upon the work, as the night follows upon the day.  Not\nby becoming a toil-beast could he win to the heights, was the message the\nwhiskey whispered to him, and he nodded approbation.  The whiskey was\nwise.  It told secrets on itself.\n\nHe called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around, and while they\ndrank his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.\n\n\"A telegram, Joe,\" he said.  \"Read it.\"\n\nJoe read it with a drunken, quizzical leer.  But what he read seemed to\nsober him.  He looked at the other reproachfully, tears oozing into his\neyes and down his cheeks.\n\n\"You ain't goin' back on me, Mart?\" he queried hopelessly.\n\nMartin nodded, and called one of the loungers to him to take the message\nto the telegraph office.\n\n\"Hold on,\" Joe muttered thickly.  \"Lemme think.\"\n\nHe held on to the bar, his legs wobbling under him, Martin's arm around\nhim and supporting him, while he thought.\n\n\"Make that two laundrymen,\" he said abruptly.  \"Here, lemme fix it.\"\n\n\"What are you quitting for?\" Martin demanded.\n\n\"Same reason as you.\"\n\n\"But I'm going to sea.  You can't do that.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" was the answer, \"but I can hobo all right, all right.\"\n\nMartin looked at him searchingly for a moment, then cried:-\n\n\"By God, I think you're right!  Better a hobo than a beast of toil.  Why,\nman, you'll live.  And that's more than you ever did before.\"\n\n\"I was in hospital, once,\" Joe corrected.  \"It was beautiful.  Typhoid--did\nI tell you?\"\n\nWhile Martin changed the telegram to \"two laundrymen,\" Joe went on:-\n\n\"I never wanted to drink when I was in hospital.  Funny, ain't it?  But\nwhen I've ben workin' like a slave all week, I just got to bowl up.  Ever\nnoticed that cooks drink like hell?--an' bakers, too?  It's the work.\nThey've sure got to.  Here, lemme pay half of that telegram.\"\n\n\"I'll shake you for it,\" Martin offered.\n\n\"Come on, everybody drink,\" Joe called, as they rattled the dice and\nrolled them out on the damp bar.\n\nMonday morning Joe was wild with anticipation.  He did not mind his\naching head, nor did he take interest in his work.  Whole herds of\nmoments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed out\nof the window at the sunshine and the trees.\n\n\"Just look at it!\" he cried.  \"An' it's all mine!  It's free.  I can lie\ndown under them trees an' sleep for a thousan' years if I want to.  Aw,\ncome on, Mart, let's chuck it.  What's the good of waitin' another\nmoment.  That's the land of nothin' to do out there, an' I got a ticket\nfor it--an' it ain't no return ticket, b'gosh!\"\n\nA few minutes later, filling the truck with soiled clothes for the\nwasher, Joe spied the hotel manager's shirt.  He knew its mark, and with\na sudden glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it on the floor and\nstamped on it.\n\n\"I wish you was in it, you pig-headed Dutchman!\" he shouted.  \"In it, an'\nright there where I've got you!  Take that! an' that! an' that! damn you!\nHold me back, somebody!  Hold me back!\"\n\nMartin laughed and held him to his work.  On Tuesday night the new\nlaundrymen arrived, and the rest of the week was spent breaking them into\nthe routine.  Joe sat around and explained his system, but he did no more\nwork.\n\n\"Not a tap,\" he announced.  \"Not a tap.  They can fire me if they want\nto, but if they do, I'll quit.  No more work in mine, thank you kindly.\nMe for the freight cars an' the shade under the trees.  Go to it, you\nslaves!  That's right.  Slave an' sweat!  Slave an' sweat!  An' when\nyou're dead, you'll rot the same as me, an' what's it matter how you\nlive?--eh?  Tell me that--what's it matter in the long run?\"\n\nOn Saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways.\n\n\"They ain't no use in me askin' you to change your mind an' hit the road\nwith me?\" Joe asked hopelessly:\n\nMartin shook his head.  He was standing by his wheel, ready to start.\nThey shook hands, and Joe held on to his for a moment, as he said:-\n\n\"I'm goin' to see you again, Mart, before you an' me die.  That's\nstraight dope.  I feel it in my bones.  Good-by, Mart, an' be good.  I\nlike you like hell, you know.\"\n\nHe stood, a forlorn figure, in the middle of the road, watching until\nMartin turned a bend and was gone from sight.\n\n\"He's a good Indian, that boy,\" he muttered.  \"A good Indian.\"\n\nThen he plodded down the road himself, to the water tank, where half a\ndozen empties lay on a side-track waiting for the up freight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nRuth and her family were home again, and Martin, returned to Oakland, saw\nmuch of her.  Having gained her degree, she was doing no more studying;\nand he, having worked all vitality out of his mind and body, was doing no\nwriting.  This gave them time for each other that they had never had\nbefore, and their intimacy ripened fast.\n\nAt first, Martin had done nothing but rest.  He had slept a great deal,\nand spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing.  He was like\none recovering from some terrible bout of hardship.  The first signs of\nreawakening came when he discovered more than languid interest in the\ndaily paper.  Then he began to read again--light novels, and poetry; and\nafter several days more he was head over heels in his long-neglected\nFiske.  His splendid body and health made new vitality, and he possessed\nall the resiliency and rebound of youth.\n\nRuth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he was\ngoing to sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested.\n\n\"Why do you want to do that?\" she asked.\n\n\"Money,\" was the answer.  \"I'll have to lay in a supply for my next\nattack on the editors.  Money is the sinews of war, in my case--money and\npatience.\"\n\n\"But if all you wanted was money, why didn't you stay in the laundry?\"\n\n\"Because the laundry was making a beast of me.  Too much work of that\nsort drives to drink.\"\n\nShe stared at him with horror in her eyes.\n\n\"Do you mean--?\" she quavered.\n\nIt would have been easy for him to get out of it; but his natural impulse\nwas for frankness, and he remembered his old resolve to be frank, no\nmatter what happened.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.  \"Just that.  Several times.\"\n\nShe shivered and drew away from him.\n\n\"No man that I have ever known did that--ever did that.\"\n\n\"Then they never worked in the laundry at Shelly Hot Springs,\" he laughed\nbitterly.  \"Toil is a good thing.  It is necessary for human health, so\nall the preachers say, and Heaven knows I've never been afraid of it.  But\nthere is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and the laundry up\nthere is one of them.  And that's why I'm going to sea one more voyage.\nIt will be my last, I think, for when I come back, I shall break into the\nmagazines.  I am certain of it.\"\n\nShe was silent, unsympathetic, and he watched her moodily, realizing how\nimpossible it was for her to understand what he had been through.\n\n\"Some day I shall write it up--'The Degradation of Toil' or the\n'Psychology of Drink in the Working-class,' or something like that for a\ntitle.\"\n\nNever, since the first meeting, had they seemed so far apart as that day.\nHis confession, told in frankness, with the spirit of revolt behind, had\nrepelled her.  But she was more shocked by the repulsion itself than by\nthe cause of it.  It pointed out to her how near she had drawn to him,\nand once accepted, it paved the way for greater intimacy.  Pity, too, was\naroused, and innocent, idealistic thoughts of reform.  She would save\nthis raw young man who had come so far.  She would save him from the\ncurse of his early environment, and she would save him from himself in\nspite of himself.  And all this affected her as a very noble state of\nconsciousness; nor did she dream that behind it and underlying it were\nthe jealousy and desire of love.\n\nThey rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather, and out in\nthe hills they read poetry aloud, now one and now the other, noble,\nuplifting poetry that turned one's thoughts to higher things.\nRenunciation, sacrifice, patience, industry, and high endeavor were the\nprinciples she thus indirectly preached--such abstractions being\nobjectified in her mind by her father, and Mr. Butler, and by Andrew\nCarnegie, who, from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the book-giver\nof the world.  All of which was appreciated and enjoyed by Martin.  He\nfollowed her mental processes more clearly now, and her soul was no\nlonger the sealed wonder it had been.  He was on terms of intellectual\nequality with her.  But the points of disagreement did not affect his\nlove.  His love was more ardent than ever, for he loved her for what she\nwas, and even her physical frailty was an added charm in his eyes.  He\nread of sickly Elizabeth Barrett, who for years had not placed her feet\nupon the ground, until that day of flame when she eloped with Browning\nand stood upright, upon the earth, under the open sky; and what Browning\nhad done for her, Martin decided he could do for Ruth.  But first, she\nmust love him.  The rest would be easy.  He would give her strength and\nhealth.  And he caught glimpses of their life, in the years to come,\nwherein, against a background of work and comfort and general well-being,\nhe saw himself and Ruth reading and discussing poetry, she propped amid a\nmultitude of cushions on the ground while she read aloud to him.  This\nwas the key to the life they would live.  And always he saw that\nparticular picture.  Sometimes it was she who leaned against him while he\nread, one arm about her, her head upon his shoulder.  Sometimes they\npored together over the printed pages of beauty.  Then, too, she loved\nnature, and with generous imagination he changed the scene of their\nreading--sometimes they read in closed-in valleys with precipitous walls,\nor in high mountain meadows, and, again, down by the gray sand-dunes with\na wreath of billows at their feet, or afar on some volcanic tropic isle\nwhere waterfalls descended and became mist, reaching the sea in vapor\nveils that swayed and shivered to every vagrant wisp of wind.  But\nalways, in the foreground, lords of beauty and eternally reading and\nsharing, lay he and Ruth, and always in the background that was beyond\nthe background of nature, dim and hazy, were work and success and money\nearned that made them free of the world and all its treasures.\n\n\"I should recommend my little girl to be careful,\" her mother warned her\none day.\n\n\"I know what you mean.  But it is impossible.  He is not--\"\n\nRuth was blushing, but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for the\nfirst time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held\nequally sacred.\n\n\"Your kind.\"  Her mother finished the sentence for her.\n\nRuth nodded.\n\n\"I did not want to say it, but he is not.  He is rough, brutal,\nstrong--too strong.  He has not--\"\n\nShe hesitated and could not go on.  It was a new experience, talking over\nsuch matters with her mother.  And again her mother completed her thought\nfor her.\n\n\"He has not lived a clean life, is what you wanted to say.\"\n\nAgain Ruth nodded, and again a blush mantled her face.\n\n\"It is just that,\" she said.  \"It has not been his fault, but he has\nplayed much with--\"\n\n\"With pitch?\"\n\n\"Yes, with pitch.  And he frightens me.  Sometimes I am positively in\nterror of him, when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he\nhas done--as if they did not matter.  They do matter, don't they?\"\n\nThey sat with their arms twined around each other, and in the pause her\nmother patted her hand and waited for her to go on.\n\n\"But I am interested in him dreadfully,\" she continued.  \"In a way he is\nmy protege.  Then, too, he is my first boy friend--but not exactly\nfriend; rather protege and friend combined.  Sometimes, too, when he\nfrightens me, it seems that he is a bulldog I have taken for a plaything,\nlike some of the 'frat' girls, and he is tugging hard, and showing his\nteeth, and threatening to break loose.\"\n\nAgain her mother waited.\n\n\"He interests me, I suppose, like the bulldog.  And there is much good in\nhim, too; but there is much in him that I would not like in--in the other\nway.  You see, I have been thinking.  He swears, he smokes, he drinks, he\nhas fought with his fists (he has told me so, and he likes it; he says\nso).  He is all that a man should not be--a man I would want for my--\"\nher voice sank very low--\"husband.  Then he is too strong.  My prince\nmust be tall, and slender, and dark--a graceful, bewitching prince.  No,\nthere is no danger of my failing in love with Martin Eden.  It would be\nthe worst fate that could befall me.\"\n\n\"But it is not that that I spoke about,\" her mother equivocated.  \"Have\nyou thought about him?  He is so ineligible in every way, you know, and\nsuppose he should come to love you?\"\n\n\"But he does--already,\" she cried.\n\n\"It was to be expected,\" Mrs. Morse said gently.  \"How could it be\notherwise with any one who knew you?\"\n\n\"Olney hates me!\" she exclaimed passionately.  \"And I hate Olney.  I feel\nalways like a cat when he is around.  I feel that I must be nasty to him,\nand even when I don't happen to feel that way, why, he's nasty to me,\nanyway.  But I am happy with Martin Eden.  No one ever loved me before--no\nman, I mean, in that way.  And it is sweet to be loved--that way.  You\nknow what I mean, mother dear.  It is sweet to feel that you are really\nand truly a woman.\"  She buried her face in her mother's lap, sobbing.\n\"You think I am dreadful, I know, but I am honest, and I tell you just\nhow I feel.\"\n\nMrs. Morse was strangely sad and happy.  Her child-daughter, who was a\nbachelor of arts, was gone; but in her place was a woman-daughter.  The\nexperiment had succeeded.  The strange void in Ruth's nature had been\nfilled, and filled without danger or penalty.  This rough sailor-fellow\nhad been the instrument, and, though Ruth did not love him, he had made\nher conscious of her womanhood.\n\n\"His hand trembles,\" Ruth was confessing, her face, for shame's sake,\nstill buried.  \"It is most amusing and ridiculous, but I feel sorry for\nhim, too.  And when his hands are too trembly, and his eyes too shiny,\nwhy, I lecture him about his life and the wrong way he is going about it\nto mend it.  But he worships me, I know.  His eyes and his hands do not\nlie.  And it makes me feel grown-up, the thought of it, the very thought\nof it; and I feel that I am possessed of something that is by rights my\nown--that makes me like the other girls--and--and young women.  And,\nthen, too, I knew that I was not like them before, and I knew that it\nworried you.  You thought you did not let me know that dear worry of\nyours, but I did, and I wanted to--'to make good,' as Martin Eden says.\"\n\nIt was a holy hour for mother and daughter, and their eyes were wet as\nthey talked on in the twilight, Ruth all white innocence and frankness,\nher mother sympathetic, receptive, yet calmly explaining and guiding.\n\n\"He is four years younger than you,\" she said.  \"He has no place in the\nworld.  He has neither position nor salary.  He is impractical.  Loving\nyou, he should, in the name of common sense, be doing something that\nwould give him the right to marry, instead of paltering around with those\nstories of his and with childish dreams.  Martin Eden, I am afraid, will\nnever grow up.  He does not take to responsibility and a man's work in\nthe world like your father did, or like all our friends, Mr. Butler for\none.  Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never be a money-earner.  And this\nworld is so ordered that money is necessary to happiness--oh, no, not\nthese swollen fortunes, but enough of money to permit of common comfort\nand decency.  He--he has never spoken?\"\n\n\"He has not breathed a word.  He has not attempted to; but if he did, I\nwould not let him, because, you see, I do not love him.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that.  I should not care to see my daughter, my one\ndaughter, who is so clean and pure, love a man like him.  There are noble\nmen in the world who are clean and true and manly.  Wait for them.  You\nwill find one some day, and you will love him and be loved by him, and\nyou will be happy with him as your father and I have been happy with each\nother.  And there is one thing you must always carry in mind--\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.\"\n\nMrs. Morse's voice was low and sweet as she said, \"And that is the\nchildren.\"\n\n\"I--have thought about them,\" Ruth confessed, remembering the wanton\nthoughts that had vexed her in the past, her face again red with maiden\nshame that she should be telling such things.\n\n\"And it is that, the children, that makes Mr. Eden impossible,\" Mrs.\nMorse went on incisively.  \"Their heritage must be clean, and he is, I am\nafraid, not clean.  Your father has told me of sailors' lives, and--and\nyou understand.\"\n\nRuth pressed her mother's hand in assent, feeling that she really did\nunderstand, though her conception was of something vague, remote, and\nterrible that was beyond the scope of imagination.\n\n\"You know I do nothing without telling you,\" she began.  \"--Only,\nsometimes you must ask me, like this time.  I wanted to tell you, but I\ndid not know how.  It is false modesty, I know it is that, but you can\nmake it easy for me.  Sometimes, like this time, you must ask me, you\nmust give me a chance.\"\n\n\"Why, mother, you are a woman, too!\" she cried exultantly, as they stood\nup, catching her mother's hands and standing erect, facing her in the\ntwilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them.  \"I\nshould never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk.\nI had to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one, too.\"\n\n\"We are women together,\" her mother said, drawing her to her and kissing\nher.  \"We are women together,\" she repeated, as they went out of the\nroom, their arms around each other's waists, their hearts swelling with a\nnew sense of companionship.\n\n\"Our little girl has become a woman,\" Mrs. Morse said proudly to her\nhusband an hour later.\n\n\"That means,\" he said, after a long look at his wife, \"that means she is\nin love.\"\n\n\"No, but that she is loved,\" was the smiling rejoinder.  \"The experiment\nhas succeeded.  She is awakened at last.\"\n\n\"Then we'll have to get rid of him.\"  Mr. Morse spoke briskly, in matter-\nof-fact, businesslike tones.\n\nBut his wife shook her head.  \"It will not be necessary.  Ruth says he is\ngoing to sea in a few days.  When he comes back, she will not be here.  We\nwill send her to Aunt Clara's.  And, besides, a year in the East, with\nthe change in climate, people, ideas, and everything, is just the thing\nshe needs.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nThe desire to write was stirring in Martin once more.  Stories and poems\nwere springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and he made notes\nof them against the future time when he would give them expression.  But\nhe did not write.  This was his little vacation; he had resolved to\ndevote it to rest and love, and in both matters he prospered.  He was\nsoon spilling over with vitality, and each day he saw Ruth, at the moment\nof meeting, she experienced the old shock of his strength and health.\n\n\"Be careful,\" her mother warned her once again.  \"I am afraid you are\nseeing too much of Martin Eden.\"\n\nBut Ruth laughed from security.  She was sure of herself, and in a few\ndays he would be off to sea.  Then, by the time he returned, she would be\naway on her visit East.  There was a magic, however, in the strength and\nhealth of Martin.  He, too, had been told of her contemplated Eastern\ntrip, and he felt the need for haste.  Yet he did not know how to make\nlove to a girl like Ruth.  Then, too, he was handicapped by the\npossession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had\nbeen absolutely different from her.  They had known about love and life\nand flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things.  Her prodigious\ninnocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of speech, and\nconvincing him, in spite of himself, of his own unworthiness.  Also he\nwas handicapped in another way.  He had himself never been in love\nbefore.  He had liked women in that turgid past of his, and been\nfascinated by some of them, but he had not known what it was to love\nthem.  He had whistled in a masterful, careless way, and they had come to\nhim.  They had been diversions, incidents, part of the game men play, but\na small part at most.  And now, and for the first time, he was a\nsuppliant, tender and timid and doubting.  He did not know the way of\nlove, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his loved one's clear\ninnocence.\n\nIn the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on\nthrough the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of conduct\nwhich was to the effect that when one played a strange game, he should\nlet the other fellow play first.  This had stood him in good stead a\nthousand times and trained him as an observer as well.  He knew how to\nwatch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness, for a place\nof entrance, to divulge itself.  It was like sparring for an opening in\nfist-fighting.  And when such an opening came, he knew by long experience\nto play for it and to play hard.\n\nSo he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not\ndaring.  He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself.\nHad he but known it, he was following the right course with her.  Love\ncame into the world before articulate speech, and in its own early youth\nit had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten.  It was in\nthis old, primitive way that Martin wooed Ruth.  He did not know he was\ndoing it at first, though later he divined it.  The touch of his hand on\nhers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter, the impact of\nhis strength on her imagination was more alluring than the printed poems\nand spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers.  Whatever his\ntongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her judgment; but\nthe touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way directly to her\ninstinct.  Her judgment was as young as she, but her instincts were as\nold as the race and older.  They had been young when love was young, and\nthey were wiser than convention and opinion and all the new-born things.\nSo her judgment did not act.  There was no call upon it, and she did not\nrealize the strength of the appeal Martin made from moment to moment to\nher love-nature.  That he loved her, on the other hand, was as clear as\nday, and she consciously delighted in beholding his\nlove-manifestations--the glowing eyes with their tender lights, the\ntrembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly\nunder his sunburn.  She even went farther, in a timid way inciting him,\nbut doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and doing it half-\nconsciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself.  She thrilled with\nthese proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman, and she took an\nEve-like delight in tormenting him and playing upon him.\n\nTongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly\nand awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact.  The touch of\nhis hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than\npleasant.  Martin did not know it, but he did know that it was not\ndistasteful to her.  Not that they touched hands often, save at meeting\nand parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the books\nof verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of books\nside by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand.\nAnd there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his cheek, and\nfor shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over the beauty\nof the books.  She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from\nnowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly,\nwhen they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with\nclosed eyes about the future that was to be theirs.  On Sunday picnics at\nShellmound Park and Schuetzen Park, in the past, he had rested his head\non many laps, and, usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the\ngirls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and\nwondered at his lordly carelessness of their love.  To rest his head in a\ngirl's lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now, and now he\nfound Ruth's lap inaccessible and impossible.  Yet it was right here, in\nhis reticence, that the strength of his wooing lay.  It was because of\nthis reticence that he never alarmed her.  Herself fastidious and timid,\nshe never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse.  Subtly\nand unaware she grew toward him and closer to him, while he, sensing the\ngrowing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.\n\nOnce he dared, one afternoon, when he found her in the darkened living\nroom with a blinding headache.\n\n\"Nothing can do it any good,\" she had answered his inquiries.  \"And\nbesides, I don't take headache powders.  Doctor Hall won't permit me.\"\n\n\"I can cure it, I think, and without drugs,\" was Martin's answer.  \"I am\nnot sure, of course, but I'd like to try.  It's simply massage.  I\nlearned the trick first from the Japanese.  They are a race of masseurs,\nyou know.  Then I learned it all over again with variations from the\nHawaiians.  They call it _lomi-lomi_.  It can accomplish most of the\nthings drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs can't.\"\n\nScarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply.\n\n\"That is so good,\" she said.\n\nShe spoke once again, half an hour later, when she asked, \"Aren't you\ntired?\"\n\nThe question was perfunctory, and she knew what the answer would be.  Then\nshe lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of his\nstrength: Life poured from the ends of his fingers, driving the pain\nbefore it, or so it seemed to her, until with the easement of pain, she\nfell asleep and he stole away.\n\nShe called him up by telephone that evening to thank him.\n\n\"I slept until dinner,\" she said.  \"You cured me completely, Mr. Eden,\nand I don't know how to thank you.\"\n\nHe was warm, and bungling of speech, and very happy, as he replied to\nher, and there was dancing in his mind, throughout the telephone\nconversation, the memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett.\nWhat had been done could be done again, and he, Martin Eden, could do it\nand would do it for Ruth Morse.  He went back to his room and to the\nvolume of Spencer's \"Sociology\" lying open on the bed.  But he could not\nread.  Love tormented him and overrode his will, so that, despite all\ndetermination, he found himself at the little ink-stained table.  The\nsonnet he composed that night was the first of a love-cycle of fifty\nsonnets which was completed within two months.  He had the \"Love-sonnets\nfrom the Portuguese\" in mind as he wrote, and he wrote under the best\nconditions for great work, at a climacteric of living, in the throes of\nhis own sweet love-madness.\n\nThe many hours he was not with Ruth he devoted to the \"Love-cycle,\" to\nreading at home, or to the public reading-rooms, where he got more\nclosely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their\npolicy and content.  The hours he spent with Ruth were maddening alike in\npromise and in inconclusiveness.  It was a week after he cured her\nheadache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman and\nseconded by Arthur and Olney.  Martin was the only one capable of\nhandling a boat, and he was pressed into service.  Ruth sat near him in\nthe stern, while the three young fellows lounged amidships, deep in a\nwordy wrangle over \"frat\" affairs.\n\nThe moon had not yet risen, and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault of the\nsky and exchanging no speech with Martin, experienced a sudden feeling of\nloneliness.  She glanced at him.  A puff of wind was heeling the boat\nover till the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and the other on\nmain-sheet, was luffing slightly, at the same time peering ahead to make\nout the near-lying north shore.  He was unaware of her gaze, and she\nwatched him intently, speculating fancifully about the strange warp of\nsoul that led him, a young man with signal powers, to fritter away his\ntime on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and\nfailure.\n\nHer eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight,\nand over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon\nhis neck came back to her.  The strength she abhorred attracted her.  Her\nfeeling of loneliness became more pronounced, and she felt tired.  Her\nposition on the heeling boat irked her, and she remembered the headache\nhe had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him.  He was sitting\nbeside her, quite beside her, and the boat seemed to tilt her toward him.\nThen arose in her the impulse to lean against him, to rest herself\nagainst his strength--a vague, half-formed impulse, which, even as she\nconsidered it, mastered her and made her lean toward him.  Or was it the\nheeling of the boat?  She did not know.  She never knew.  She knew only\nthat she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing rest\nwere very good.  Perhaps it had been the boat's fault, but she made no\neffort to retrieve it.  She leaned lightly against his shoulder, but she\nleaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to make it\nmore comfortable for her.\n\nIt was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness.  She was no\nlonger herself but a woman, with a woman's clinging need; and though she\nleaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied.  She was no longer\ntired.  Martin did not speak.  Had he, the spell would have been broken.\nBut his reticence of love prolonged it.  He was dazed and dizzy.  He\ncould not understand what was happening.  It was too wonderful to be\nanything but a delirium.  He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and\ntiller and to clasp her in his arms.  His intuition told him it was the\nwrong thing to do, and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands\noccupied and fended off temptation.  But he luffed the boat less\ndelicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong\nthe tack to the north shore.  The shore would compel him to go about, and\nthe contact would be broken.  He sailed with skill, stopping way on the\nboat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally forgiving\nhis hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible,\ngiving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with\nher beside him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.\n\nWhen the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating\nthe boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him.  And, even as\nshe moved, she felt him move away.  The impulse to avoid detection was\nmutual.  The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate.  She sat apart\nfrom him with burning cheeks, while the full force of it came home to\nher.  She had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers\nsee, nor Olney see.  Why had she done it?  She had never done anything\nlike it in her life, and yet she had been moonlight-sailing with young\nmen before.  She had never desired to do anything like it.  She was\novercome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood.\nShe stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat about on the\nother tack, and she could have hated him for having made her do an\nimmodest and shameful thing.  And he, of all men!  Perhaps her mother was\nright, and she was seeing too much of him.  It would never happen again,\nshe resolved, and she would see less of him in the future.  She\nentertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were\nalone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the attack of\nfaintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up.  Then\nshe remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing\nmoon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.\n\nIn the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a\nstrange, puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of self-\nanalysis, refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and\nwhither she was drifting.  She was in a fever of tingling mystery,\nalternately frightened and charmed, and in constant bewilderment.  She\nhad one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured her security.  She\nwould not let Martin speak his love.  As long as she did this, all would\nbe well.  In a few days he would be off to sea.  And even if he did\nspeak, all would be well.  It could not be otherwise, for she did not\nlove him.  Of course, it would be a painful half hour for him, and an\nembarrassing half hour for her, because it would be her first proposal.\nShe thrilled deliciously at the thought.  She was really a woman, with a\nman ripe to ask for her in marriage.  It was a lure to all that was\nfundamental in her sex.  The fabric of her life, of all that constituted\nher, quivered and grew tremulous.  The thought fluttered in her mind like\na flame-attracted moth.  She went so far as to imagine Martin proposing,\nherself putting the words into his mouth; and she rehearsed her refusal,\ntempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood.\nAnd especially he must stop smoking cigarettes.  She would make a point\nof that.  But no, she must not let him speak at all.  She could stop him,\nand she had told her mother that she would.  All flushed and burning, she\nregretfully dismissed the conjured situation.  Her first proposal would\nhave to be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible suitor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nCame a beautiful fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush of\nthe changing season, a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun and\nwandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air.  Filmy\npurple mists, that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color, hid in the\nrecesses of the hills.  San Francisco lay like a blur of smoke upon her\nheights.  The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten metal, whereon\nsailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy tide.  Far\nTamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze, bulked hugely by the Golden\nGate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering sun.  Beyond,\nthe Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky-line tumbled\ncloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning of the first blustering\nbreath of winter.\n\nThe erasure of summer was at hand.  Yet summer lingered, fading and\nfainting among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning a\nshroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the calm\ncontent of having lived and lived well.  And among the hills, on their\nfavorite knoll, Martin and Ruth sat side by side, their heads bent over\nthe same pages, he reading aloud from the love-sonnets of the woman who\nhad loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved.\n\nBut the reading languished.  The spell of passing beauty all about them\nwas too strong.  The golden year was dying as it had lived, a beautiful\nand unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content freighted\nheavily the air.  It entered into them, dreamy and languorous, weakening\nthe fibres of resolution, suffusing the face of morality, or of judgment,\nwith haze and purple mist.  Martin felt tender and melting, and from time\nto time warm glows passed over him.  His head was very near to hers, and\nwhen wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his\nface, the printed pages swam before his eyes.\n\n\"I don't believe you know a word of what you are reading,\" she said once\nwhen he had lost his place.\n\nHe looked at her with burning eyes, and was on the verge of becoming\nawkward, when a retort came to his lips.\n\n\"I don't believe you know either.  What was the last sonnet about?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she laughed frankly.  \"I've already forgotten.  Don't let\nus read any more.  The day is too beautiful.\"\n\n\"It will be our last in the hills for some time,\" he announced gravely.\n\"There's a storm gathering out there on the sea-rim.\"\n\nThe book slipped from his hands to the ground, and they sat idly and\nsilently, gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did\nnot see.  Ruth glanced sidewise at his neck.  She did not lean toward\nhim.  She was drawn by some force outside of herself and stronger than\ngravitation, strong as destiny.  It was only an inch to lean, and it was\naccomplished without volition on her part.  Her shoulder touched his as\nlightly as a butterfly touches a flower, and just as lightly was the\ncounter-pressure.  She felt his shoulder press hers, and a tremor run\nthrough him.  Then was the time for her to draw back.  But she had become\nan automaton.  Her actions had passed beyond the control of her will--she\nnever thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon\nher.  His arm began to steal behind her and around her.  She waited its\nslow progress in a torment of delight.  She waited, she knew not for\nwhat, panting, with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever of\nexpectancy in all her blood.  The girdling arm lifted higher and drew her\ntoward him, drew her slowly and caressingly.  She could wait no longer.\nWith a tired sigh, and with an impulsive movement all her own,\nunpremeditated, spasmodic, she rested her head upon his breast.  His head\nbent over swiftly, and, as his lips approached, hers flew to meet them.\n\nThis must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was\nvouchsafed her.  If it was not love, it was too shameful.  It could be\nnothing else than love.  She loved the man whose arms were around her and\nwhose lips were pressed to hers.  She pressed more, tightly to him, with\na snuggling movement of her body.  And a moment later, tearing herself\nhalf out of his embrace, suddenly and exultantly she reached up and\nplaced both hands upon Martin Eden's sunburnt neck.  So exquisite was the\npang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan, relaxed\nher hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.\n\nNot a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long time.\nTwice he bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met his shyly and\nher body made its happy, nestling movement.  She clung to him, unable to\nrelease herself, and he sat, half supporting her in his arms, as he gazed\nwith unseeing eyes at the blur of the great city across the bay.  For\nonce there were no visions in his brain.  Only colors and lights and\nglows pulsed there, warm as the day and warm as his love.  He bent over\nher.  She was speaking.\n\n\"When did you love me?\" she whispered.\n\n\"From the first, the very first, the first moment I laid eye on you.  I\nwas mad for love of you then, and in all the time that has passed since\nthen I have only grown the madder.  I am maddest, now, dear.  I am almost\na lunatic, my head is so turned with joy.\"\n\n\"I am glad I am a woman, Martin--dear,\" she said, after a long sigh.\n\nHe crushed her in his arms again and again, and then asked:-\n\n\"And you?  When did you first know?\"\n\n\"Oh, I knew it all the time, almost, from the first.\"\n\n\"And I have been as blind as a bat!\" he cried, a ring of vexation in his\nvoice.  \"I never dreamed it until just how, when I--when I kissed you.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that.\"  She drew herself partly away and looked at him.  \"I\nmeant I knew you loved almost from the first.\"\n\n\"And you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"It came to me suddenly.\"  She was speaking very slowly, her eyes warm\nand fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go\naway.  \"I never knew until just now when--you put your arms around me.\nAnd I never expected to marry you, Martin, not until just now.  How did\nyou make me love you?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he laughed, \"unless just by loving you, for I loved you\nhard enough to melt the heart of a stone, much less the heart of the\nliving, breathing woman you are.\"\n\n\"This is so different from what I thought love would be,\" she announced\nirrelevantly.\n\n\"What did you think it would be like?\"\n\n\"I didn't think it would be like this.\"  She was looking into his eyes at\nthe moment, but her own dropped as she continued, \"You see, I didn't know\nwhat this was like.\"\n\nHe offered to draw her toward him again, but it was no more than a\ntentative muscular movement of the girdling arm, for he feared that he\nmight be greedy.  Then he felt her body yielding, and once again she was\nclose in his arms and lips were pressed on lips.\n\n\"What will my people say?\" she queried, with sudden apprehension, in one\nof the pauses.\n\n\"I don't know.  We can find out very easily any time we are so minded.\"\n\n\"But if mamma objects?  I am sure I am afraid to tell her.\"\n\n\"Let me tell her,\" he volunteered valiantly.  \"I think your mother does\nnot like me, but I can win her around.  A fellow who can win you can win\nanything.  And if we don't--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Why, we'll have each other.  But there's no danger not winning your\nmother to our marriage.  She loves you too well.\"\n\n\"I should not like to break her heart,\" Ruth said pensively.\n\nHe felt like assuring her that mothers' hearts were not so easily broken,\nbut instead he said, \"And love is the greatest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Martin, you sometimes frighten me.  I am frightened now,\nwhen I think of you and of what you have been.  You must be very, very\ngood to me.  Remember, after all, that I am only a child.  I never loved\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Nor I.  We are both children together.  And we are fortunate above most,\nfor we have found our first love in each other.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible!\" she cried, withdrawing herself from his arms\nwith a swift, passionate movement.  \"Impossible for you.  You have been a\nsailor, and sailors, I have heard, are--are--\"\n\nHer voice faltered and died away.\n\n\"Are addicted to having a wife in every port?\" he suggested.  \"Is that\nwhat you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered in a low voice.\n\n\"But that is not love.\"  He spoke authoritatively.  \"I have been in many\nports, but I never knew a passing touch of love until I saw you that\nfirst night.  Do you know, when I said good night and went away, I was\nalmost arrested.\"\n\n\"Arrested?\"\n\n\"Yes.  The policeman thought I was drunk; and I was, too--with love for\nyou.\"\n\n\"But you said we were children, and I said it was impossible, for you,\nand we have strayed away from the point.\"\n\n\"I said that I never loved anybody but you,\" he replied.  \"You are my\nfirst, my very first.\"\n\n\"And yet you have been a sailor,\" she objected.\n\n\"But that doesn't prevent me from loving you the first.\"\n\n\"And there have been women--other women--oh!\"\n\nAnd to Martin Eden's supreme surprise, she burst into a storm of tears\nthat took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away.  And all\nthe while there was running through his head Kipling's line: \"_And the\nColonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under their skins_.\"  It was\ntrue, he decided; though the novels he had read had led him to believe\notherwise.  His idea, for which the novels were responsible, had been\nthat only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes.  It was all\nright enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win each\nother by contact; but for the exalted personages up above on the heights\nto make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable.  Yet the novels\nwere wrong.  Here was a proof of it.  The same pressures and caresses,\nunaccompanied by speech, that were efficacious with the girls of the\nworking-class, were equally efficacious with the girls above the working-\nclass.  They were all of the same flesh, after all, sisters under their\nskins; and he might have known as much himself had he remembered his\nSpencer.  As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her, he took great\nconsolation in the thought that the Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady were\npretty much alike under their skins.  It brought Ruth closer to him, made\nher possible.  Her dear flesh was as anybody's flesh, as his flesh.  There\nwas no bar to their marriage.  Class difference was the only difference,\nand class was extrinsic.  It could be shaken off.  A slave, he had read,\nhad risen to the Roman purple.  That being so, then he could rise to\nRuth.  Under her purity, and saintliness, and culture, and ethereal\nbeauty of soul, she was, in things fundamentally human, just like Lizzie\nConnolly and all Lizzie Connollys.  All that was possible of them was\npossible of her.  She could love, and hate, maybe have hysterics; and she\ncould certainly be jealous, as she was jealous now, uttering her last\nsobs in his arms.\n\n\"Besides, I am older than you,\" she remarked suddenly, opening her eyes\nand looking up at him, \"three years older.\"\n\n\"Hush, you are only a child, and I am forty years older than you, in\nexperience,\" was his answer.\n\nIn truth, they were children together, so far as love was concerned, and\nthey were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as a pair\nof children, and this despite the fact that she was crammed with a\nuniversity education and that his head was full of scientific philosophy\nand the hard facts of life.\n\nThey sat on through the passing glory of the day, talking as lovers are\nprone to talk, marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had\nflung them so strangely together, and dogmatically believing that they\nloved to a degree never attained by lovers before.  And they returned\ninsistently, again and again, to a rehearsal of their first impressions\nof each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely what\nthey felt for each other and how much there was of it.\n\nThe cloud-masses on the western horizon received the descending sun, and\nthe circle of the sky turned to rose, while the zenith glowed with the\nsame warm color.  The rosy light was all about them, flooding over them,\nas she sang, \"Good-by, Sweet Day.\"  She sang softly, leaning in the\ncradle of his arm, her hands in his, their hearts in each other's hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nMrs. Morse did not require a mother's intuition to read the advertisement\nin Ruth's face when she returned home.  The flush that would not leave\nthe cheeks told the simple story, and more eloquently did the eyes, large\nand bright, reflecting an unmistakable inward glory.\n\n\"What has happened?\" Mrs. Morse asked, having bided her time till Ruth\nhad gone to bed.\n\n\"You know?\" Ruth queried, with trembling lips.\n\nFor reply, her mother's arm went around her, and a hand was softly\ncaressing her hair.\n\n\"He did not speak,\" she blurted out.  \"I did not intend that it should\nhappen, and I would never have let him speak--only he didn't speak.\"\n\n\"But if he did not speak, then nothing could have happened, could it?\"\n\n\"But it did, just the same.\"\n\n\"In the name of goodness, child, what are you babbling about?\" Mrs. Morse\nwas bewildered.  \"I don't think I know what happened, after all.  What\ndid happen?\"\n\nRuth looked at her mother in surprise.\n\n\"I thought you knew.  Why, we're engaged, Martin and I.\"\n\nMrs. Morse laughed with incredulous vexation.\n\n\"No, he didn't speak,\" Ruth explained.  \"He just loved me, that was all.\nI was as surprised as you are.  He didn't say a word.  He just put his\narm around me.  And--and I was not myself.  And he kissed me, and I\nkissed him.  I couldn't help it.  I just had to.  And then I knew I loved\nhim.\"\n\nShe paused, waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mother's kiss,\nbut Mrs. Morse was coldly silent.\n\n\"It is a dreadful accident, I know,\" Ruth recommenced with a sinking\nvoice.  \"And I don't know how you will ever forgive me.  But I couldn't\nhelp it.  I did not dream that I loved him until that moment.  And you\nmust tell father for me.\"\n\n\"Would it not be better not to tell your father?  Let me see Martin Eden,\nand talk with him, and explain.  He will understand and release you.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" Ruth cried, starting up.  \"I do not want to be released.  I\nlove him, and love is very sweet.  I am going to marry him--of course, if\nyou will let me.\"\n\n\"We have other plans for you, Ruth, dear, your father and I--oh, no, no;\nno man picked out for you, or anything like that.  Our plans go no\nfarther than your marrying some man in your own station in life, a good\nand honorable gentleman, whom you will select yourself, when you love\nhim.\"\n\n\"But I love Martin already,\" was the plaintive protest.\n\n\"We would not influence your choice in any way; but you are our daughter,\nand we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as this.  He has\nnothing but roughness and coarseness to offer you in exchange for all\nthat is refined and delicate in you.  He is no match for you in any way.\nHe could not support you.  We have no foolish ideas about wealth, but\ncomfort is another matter, and our daughter should at least marry a man\nwho can give her that--and not a penniless adventurer, a sailor, a\ncowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven knows what else, who, in addition to\neverything, is hare-brained and irresponsible.\"\n\nRuth was silent.  Every word she recognized as true.\n\n\"He wastes his time over his writing, trying to accomplish what geniuses\nand rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish.  A man\nthinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage.  But not he.  As I\nhave said, and I know you agree with me, he is irresponsible.  And why\nshould he not be?  It is the way of sailors.  He has never learned to be\neconomical or temperate.  The spendthrift years have marked him.  It is\nnot his fault, of course, but that does not alter his nature.  And have\nyou thought of the years of licentiousness he inevitably has lived?  Have\nyou thought of that, daughter?  You know what marriage means.\"\n\nRuth shuddered and clung close to her mother.\n\n\"I have thought.\"  Ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame\nitself.  \"And it is terrible.  It sickens me to think of it.  I told you\nit was a dreadful accident, my loving him; but I can't help myself.  Could\nyou help loving father?  Then it is the same with me.  There is something\nin me, in him--I never knew it was there until to-day--but it is there,\nand it makes me love him.  I never thought to love him, but, you see, I\ndo,\" she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.\n\nThey talked long, and to little purpose, in conclusion agreeing to wait\nan indeterminate time without doing anything.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached, a little later that night, between Mrs.\nMorse and her husband, after she had made due confession of the\nmiscarriage of her plans.\n\n\"It could hardly have come otherwise,\" was Mr. Morse's judgment.  \"This\nsailor-fellow has been the only man she was in touch with.  Sooner or\nlater she was going to awaken anyway; and she did awaken, and lo! here\nwas this sailor-fellow, the only accessible man at the moment, and of\ncourse she promptly loved him, or thought she did, which amounts to the\nsame thing.\"\n\nMrs. Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon Ruth,\nrather than to combat her.  There would be plenty of time for this, for\nMartin was not in position to marry.\n\n\"Let her see all she wants of him,\" was Mr. Morse's advice.  \"The more\nshe knows him, the less she'll love him, I wager.  And give her plenty of\ncontrast.  Make a point of having young people at the house.  Young women\nand young men, all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have done\nsomething or who are doing things, men of her own class, gentlemen.  She\ncan gauge him by them.  They will show him up for what he is.  And after\nall, he is a mere boy of twenty-one.  Ruth is no more than a child.  It\nis calf love with the pair of them, and they will grow out of it.\"\n\nSo the matter rested.  Within the family it was accepted that Ruth and\nMartin were engaged, but no announcement was made.  The family did not\nthink it would ever be necessary.  Also, it was tacitly understood that\nit was to be a long engagement.  They did not ask Martin to go to work,\nnor to cease writing.  They did not intend to encourage him to mend\nhimself.  And he aided and abetted them in their unfriendly designs, for\ngoing to work was farthest from his thoughts.\n\n\"I wonder if you'll like what I have done!\" he said to Ruth several days\nlater.  \"I've decided that boarding with my sister is too expensive, and\nI am going to board myself.  I've rented a little room out in North\nOakland, retired neighborhood and all the rest, you know, and I've bought\nan oil-burner on which to cook.\"\n\nRuth was overjoyed.  The oil-burner especially pleased her.\n\n\"That was the way Mr. Butler began his start,\" she said.\n\nMartin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman, and\nwent on: \"I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to the\neditors again.  Then to-day I moved in, and to-morrow I start to work.\"\n\n\"A position!\" she cried, betraying the gladness of her surprise in all\nher body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling.  \"And you\nnever told me!  What is it?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I meant that I was going to work at my writing.\"  Her face fell, and he\nwent on hastily.  \"Don't misjudge me.  I am not going in this time with\nany iridescent ideas.  It is to be a cold, prosaic, matter-of-fact\nbusiness proposition.  It is better than going to sea again, and I shall\nearn more money than any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled man.\"\n\n\"You see, this vacation I have taken has given me perspective.  I haven't\nbeen working the life out of my body, and I haven't been writing, at\nleast not for publication.  All I've done has been to love you and to\nthink.  I've read some, too, but it has been part of my thinking, and I\nhave read principally magazines.  I have generalized about myself, and\nthe world, my place in it, and my chance to win to a place that will be\nfit for you.  Also, I've been reading Spencer's 'Philosophy of Style,'\nand found out a lot of what was the matter with me--or my writing,\nrather; and for that matter with most of the writing that is published\nevery month in the magazines.\"\n\n\"But the upshot of it all--of my thinking and reading and loving--is that\nI am going to move to Grub Street.  I shall leave masterpieces alone and\ndo hack-work--jokes, paragraphs, feature articles, humorous verse, and\nsociety verse--all the rot for which there seems so much demand.  Then\nthere are the newspaper syndicates, and the newspaper short-story\nsyndicates, and the syndicates for the Sunday supplements.  I can go\nahead and hammer out the stuff they want, and earn the equivalent of a\ngood salary by it.  There are free-lances, you know, who earn as much as\nfour or five hundred a month.  I don't care to become as they; but I'll\nearn a good living, and have plenty of time to myself, which I wouldn't\nhave in any position.\"\n\n\"Then, I'll have my spare time for study and for real work.  In between\nthe grind I'll try my hand at masterpieces, and I'll study and prepare\nmyself for the writing of masterpieces.  Why, I am amazed at the distance\nI have come already.  When I first tried to write, I had nothing to write\nabout except a few paltry experiences which I neither understood nor\nappreciated.  But I had no thoughts.  I really didn't.  I didn't even\nhave the words with which to think.  My experiences were so many\nmeaningless pictures.  But as I began to add to my knowledge, and to my\nvocabulary, I saw something more in my experiences than mere pictures.  I\nretained the pictures and I found their interpretation.  That was when I\nbegan to do good work, when I wrote 'Adventure,'  'Joy,' 'The Pot,' 'The\nWine of Life,' 'The Jostling Street,' the 'Love-cycle,' and the 'Sea\nLyrics.'  I shall write more like them, and better; but I shall do it in\nmy spare time.  My feet are on the solid earth, now.  Hack-work and\nincome first, masterpieces afterward.  Just to show you, I wrote half a\ndozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies; and just as I was going to\nbed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet--a humorous one;\nand inside an hour I had written four.  They ought to be worth a dollar\napiece.  Four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts on the way to\nbed.\"\n\n\"Of course it's all valueless, just so much dull and sordid plodding; but\nit is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars a\nmonth, adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies.\nAnd furthermore, the hack-work keeps me in touch with things literary and\ngives me time to try bigger things.\"\n\n\"But what good are these bigger-things, these masterpieces?\" Ruth\ndemanded.  \"You can't sell them.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can,\" he began; but she interrupted.\n\n\"All those you named, and which you say yourself are good--you have not\nsold any of them.  We can't get married on masterpieces that won't sell.\"\n\n\"Then we'll get married on triolets that will sell,\" he asserted stoutly,\nputting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive sweetheart\ntoward him.\n\n\"Listen to this,\" he went on in attempted gayety.  \"It's not art, but\nit's a dollar.\n\n   \"He came in\n   When I was out,\n   To borrow some tin\n   Was why he came in,\n   And he went without;\n   So I was in\n   And he was out.\"\n\nThe merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance with\nthe dejection that came into his face as he finished.  He had drawn no\nsmile from Ruth.  She was looking at him in an earnest and troubled way.\n\n\"It may be a dollar,\" she said, \"but it is a jester's dollar, the fee of\na clown.  Don't you see, Martin, the whole thing is lowering.  I want the\nman I love and honor to be something finer and higher than a perpetrator\nof jokes and doggerel.\"\n\n\"You want him to be like--say Mr. Butler?\" he suggested.\n\n\"I know you don't like Mr. Butler,\" she began.\n\n\"Mr. Butler's all right,\" he interrupted.  \"It's only his indigestion I\nfind fault with.  But to save me I can't see any difference between\nwriting jokes or comic verse and running a type-writer, taking dictation,\nor keeping sets of books.  It is all a means to an end.  Your theory is\nfor me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful lawyer\nor man of business.  Mine is to begin with hack-work and develop into an\nable author.\"\n\n\"There is a difference,\" she insisted.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Why, your good work, what you yourself call good, you can't sell.  You\nhave tried, you know that,--but the editors won't buy it.\"\n\n\"Give me time, dear,\" he pleaded.  \"The hack-work is only makeshift, and\nI don't take it seriously.  Give me two years.  I shall succeed in that\ntime, and the editors will be glad to buy my good work.  I know what I am\nsaying; I have faith in myself.  I know what I have in me; I know what\nliterature is, now; I know the average rot that is poured out by a lot of\nlittle men; and I know that at the end of two years I shall be on the\nhighroad to success.  As for business, I shall never succeed at it.  I am\nnot in sympathy with it.  It strikes me as dull, and stupid, and\nmercenary, and tricky.  Anyway I am not adapted for it.  I'd never get\nbeyond a clerkship, and how could you and I be happy on the paltry\nearnings of a clerk?  I want the best of everything in the world for you,\nand the only time when I won't want it will be when there is something\nbetter.  And I'm going to get it, going to get all of it.  The income of\na successful author makes Mr. Butler look cheap.  A 'best-seller' will\nearn anywhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars--sometimes\nmore and sometimes less; but, as a rule, pretty close to those figures.\"\n\nShe remained silent; her disappointment was apparent.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"I had hoped and planned otherwise.  I had thought, and I still think,\nthat the best thing for you would be to study shorthand--you already know\ntype-writing--and go into father's office.  You have a good mind, and I\nam confident you would succeed as a lawyer.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nThat Ruth had little faith in his power as a writer, did not alter her\nnor diminish her in Martin's eyes.  In the breathing spell of the\nvacation he had taken, he had spent many hours in self-analysis, and\nthereby learned much of himself.  He had discovered that he loved beauty\nmore than fame, and that what desire he had for fame was largely for\nRuth's sake.  It was for this reason that his desire for fame was strong.\nHe wanted to be great in the world's eyes; \"to make good,\" as he\nexpressed it, in order that the woman he loved should be proud of him and\ndeem him worthy.\n\nAs for himself, he loved beauty passionately, and the joy of serving her\nwas to him sufficient wage.  And more than beauty he loved Ruth.  He\nconsidered love the finest thing in the world.  It was love that had\nworked the revolution in him, changing him from an uncouth sailor to a\nstudent and an artist; therefore, to him, the finest and greatest of the\nthree, greater than learning and artistry, was love.  Already he had\ndiscovered that his brain went beyond Ruth's, just as it went beyond the\nbrains of her brothers, or the brain of her father.  In spite of every\nadvantage of university training, and in the face of her bachelorship of\narts, his power of intellect overshadowed hers, and his year or so of\nself-study and equipment gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world\nand art and life that she could never hope to possess.\n\nAll this he realized, but it did not affect his love for her, nor her\nlove for him.  Love was too fine and noble, and he was too loyal a lover\nfor him to besmirch love with criticism.  What did love have to do with\nRuth's divergent views on art, right conduct, the French Revolution, or\nequal suffrage?  They were mental processes, but love was beyond reason;\nit was superrational.  He could not belittle love.  He worshipped it.\nLove lay on the mountain-tops beyond the valley-land of reason.  It was a\nsublimates condition of existence, the topmost peak of living, and it\ncame rarely.  Thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he favored,\nhe knew the biological significance of love; but by a refined process of\nthe same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that the human\norganism achieved its highest purpose in love, that love must not be\nquestioned, but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life.  Thus,\nhe considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and it was a delight\nto him to think of \"God's own mad lover,\" rising above the things of\nearth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and applause, rising\nabove life itself and \"dying on a kiss.\"\n\nMuch of this Martin had already reasoned out, and some of it he reasoned\nout later.  In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation except when\nhe went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan.  He paid two dollars and\na half a month rent for the small room he got from his Portuguese\nlandlady, Maria Silva, a virago and a widow, hard working and harsher\ntempered, rearing her large brood of children somehow, and drowning her\nsorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin, sour\nwine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen\ncents.  From detesting her and her foul tongue at first, Martin grew to\nadmire her as he observed the brave fight she made.  There were but four\nrooms in the little house--three, when Martin's was subtracted.  One of\nthese, the parlor, gay with an ingrain carpet and dolorous with a funeral\ncard and a death-picture of one of her numerous departed babes, was kept\nstrictly for company.  The blinds were always down, and her barefooted\ntribe was never permitted to enter the sacred precinct save on state\noccasions.  She cooked, and all ate, in the kitchen, where she likewise\nwashed, starched, and ironed clothes on all days of the week except\nSunday; for her income came largely from taking in washing from her more\nprosperous neighbors.  Remained the bedroom, small as the one occupied by\nMartin, into which she and her seven little ones crowded and slept.  It\nwas an everlasting miracle to Martin how it was accomplished, and from\nher side of the thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going\nto bed, the squalls and squabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy,\ntwittering noises as of birds.  Another source of income to Maria were\nher cows, two of them, which she milked night and morning and which\ngained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that\ngrew on either side the public side walks, attended always by one or more\nof her ragged boys, whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in\nkeeping their eyes out for the poundmen.\n\nIn his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept\nhouse.  Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was\nthe kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand.\nThe bed, against the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of the total space of\nthe room.  The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau,\nmanufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which was\nshed day by day.  This bureau stood in the corner, and in the opposite\ncorner, on the table's other flank, was the kitchen--the oil-stove on a\ndry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils, a shelf\non the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on the floor.  Martin\nhad to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his\nroom.  On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of\nveneer from the bureau was unusually generous.  Over the bed, hoisted by\na tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle.  At first he had tried to keep\nit in the basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and\npuncturing the tires, had driven him out.  Next he attempted the tiny\nfront porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night-long.\nThen he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft.\n\nA small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated and\nfor which there was no room on the table or under the table.  Hand in\nhand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes, and so\ncopiously did he make them that there would have been no existence for\nhim in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clothes-lines\nacross the room on which the notes were hung.  Even so, he was crowded\nuntil navigating the room was a difficult task.  He could not open the\ndoor without first closing the closet door, and vice versa.  It was\nimpossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a straight line.  To\ngo from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag course that he was\nnever quite able to accomplish in the dark without collisions.  Having\nsettled the difficulty of the conflicting doors, he had to steer sharply\nto the right to avoid the kitchen.  Next, he sheered to the left, to\nescape the foot of the bed; but this sheer, if too generous, brought him\nagainst the corner of the table.  With a sudden twitch and lurch, he\nterminated the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal, one\nbank of which was the bed, the other the table.  When the one chair in\nthe room was at its usual place before the table, the canal was\nunnavigable.  When the chair was not in use, it reposed on top of the\nbed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking, reading a book\nwhile the water boiled, and even becoming skilful enough to manage a\nparagraph or two while steak was frying.  Also, so small was the little\ncorner that constituted the kitchen, he was able, sitting down, to reach\nanything he needed.  In fact, it was expedient to cook sitting down;\nstanding up, he was too often in his own way.\n\nIn conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything, he\npossessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time\nnutritious and cheap.  Pea-soup was a common article in his diet, as well\nas potatoes and beans, the latter large and brown and cooked in Mexican\nstyle.  Rice, cooked as American housewives never cook it and can never\nlearn to cook it, appeared on Martin's table at least once a day.  Dried\nfruits were less expensive than fresh, and he had usually a pot of them,\ncooked and ready at hand, for they took the place of butter on his bread.\nOccasionally he graced his table with a piece of round-steak, or with a\nsoup-bone.  Coffee, without cream or milk, he had twice a day, in the\nevening substituting tea; but both coffee and tea were excellently\ncooked.\n\nThere was need for him to be economical.  His vacation had consumed\nnearly all he had earned in the laundry, and he was so far from his\nmarket that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first returns\nfrom his hack-work.  Except at such times as he saw Ruth, or dropped in\nto see his sister Gertude, he lived a recluse, in each day accomplishing\nat least three days' labor of ordinary men.  He slept a scant five hours,\nand only one with a constitution of iron could have held himself down, as\nMartin did, day after day, to nineteen consecutive hours of toil.  He\nnever lost a moment.  On the looking-glass were lists of definitions and\npronunciations; when shaving, or dressing, or combing his hair, he conned\nthese lists over.  Similar lists were on the wall over the oil-stove, and\nthey were similarly conned while he was engaged in cooking or in washing\nthe dishes.  New lists continually displaced the old ones.  Every strange\nor partly familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted\ndown, and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were\ntyped and pinned to the wall or looking-glass.  He even carried them in\nhis pockets, and reviewed them at odd moments on the street, or while\nwaiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served.\n\nHe went farther in the matter.  Reading the works of men who had arrived,\nhe noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the tricks by\nwhich they had been achieved--the tricks of narrative, of exposition, of\nstyle, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams; and of all these\nhe made lists for study.  He did not ape.  He sought principles.  He drew\nup lists of effective and fetching mannerisms, till out of many such,\nculled from many writers, he was able to induce the general principle of\nmannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast about for new and original ones of\nhis own, and to weigh and measure and appraise them properly.  In similar\nmanner he collected lists of strong phrases, the phrases of living\nlanguage, phrases that bit like acid and scorched like flame, or that\nglowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of\ncommon speech.  He sought always for the principle that lay behind and\nbeneath.  He wanted to know how the thing was done; after that he could\ndo it for himself.  He was not content with the fair face of beauty.  He\ndissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory, where cooking\nsmells alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe; and, having\ndissected and learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer being able to\ncreate beauty itself.\n\nHe was so made that he could work only with understanding.  He could not\nwork blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and trusting\nto chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be\nright and fine.  He had no patience with chance effects.  He wanted to\nknow why and how.  His was deliberate creative genius, and, before he\nbegan a story or poem, the thing itself was already alive in his brain,\nwith the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in his\nconscious possession.  Otherwise the effort was doomed to failure.  On\nthe other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases\nthat came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later stood all\ntests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable\nconnotations.  Before such he bowed down and marvelled, knowing that they\nwere beyond the deliberate creation of any man.  And no matter how much\nhe dissected beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and\nmake beauty possible, he was aware, always, of the innermost mystery of\nbeauty to which he did not penetrate and to which no man had ever\npenetrated.  He knew full well, from his Spencer, that man can never\nattain ultimate knowledge of anything, and that the mystery of beauty was\nno less than that of life--nay, more that the fibres of beauty and life\nwere intertwisted, and that he himself was but a bit of the same\nnonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine and star-dust and wonder.\n\nIn fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay\nentitled \"Star-dust,\" in which he had his fling, not at the principles of\ncriticism, but at the principal critics.  It was brilliant, deep,\nphilosophical, and deliciously touched with laughter.  Also it was\npromptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted.  But\nhaving cleared his mind of it, he went serenely on his way.  It was a\nhabit he developed, of incubating and maturing his thought upon a\nsubject, and of then rushing into the type-writer with it.  That it did\nnot see print was a matter of small moment with him.  The writing of it\nwas the culminating act of a long mental process, the drawing together of\nscattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data\nwith which his mind was burdened.  To write such an article was the\nconscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh\nmaterial and problems.  It was in a way akin to that common habit of men\nand women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and\nvolubly break their long-suffering silence and \"have their say\" till the\nlast word is said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nThe weeks passed.  Martin ran out of money, and publishers' checks were\nfar away as ever.  All his important manuscripts had come back and been\nstarted out again, and his hack-work fared no better.  His little kitchen\nwas no longer graced with a variety of foods.  Caught in the pinch with a\npart sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots, rice and apricots\nwas his menu three times a day for five days hand-running.  Then he\nstartled to realize on his credit.  The Portuguese grocer, to whom he had\nhitherto paid cash, called a halt when Martin's bill reached the\nmagnificent total of three dollars and eighty-five cents.\n\n\"For you see,\" said the grocer, \"you no catcha da work, I losa da mon'.\"\n\nAnd Martin could reply nothing.  There was no way of explaining.  It was\nnot true business principle to allow credit to a strong-bodied young\nfellow of the working-class who was too lazy to work.\n\n\"You catcha da job, I let you have mora da grub,\" the grocer assured\nMartin.  \"No job, no grub.  Thata da business.\"  And then, to show that\nit was purely business foresight and not prejudice, \"Hava da drink on da\nhouse--good friends justa da same.\"\n\nSo Martin drank, in his easy way, to show that he was good friends with\nthe house, and then went supperless to bed.\n\nThe fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables, was run by an\nAmerican whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run a\nbill of five dollars before stopping his credit.  The baker stopped at\ntwo dollars, and the butcher at four dollars.  Martin added his debts and\nfound that he was possessed of a total credit in all the world of\nfourteen dollars and eighty-five cents.  He was up with his type-writer\nrent, but he estimated that he could get two months' credit on that,\nwhich would be eight dollars.  When that occurred, he would have\nexhausted all possible credit.\n\nThe last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes, and\nfor a week he had potatoes, and nothing but potatoes, three times a day.\nAn occasional dinner at Ruth's helped to keep strength in his body,\nthough he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping when his\nappetite was raging at sight of so much food spread before it.  Now and\nagain, though afflicted with secret shame, he dropped in at his sister's\nat meal-time and ate as much as he dared--more than he dared at the Morse\ntable.\n\nDay by day he worked on, and day by day the postman delivered to him\nrejected manuscripts.  He had no money for stamps, so the manuscripts\naccumulated in a heap under the table.  Came a day when for forty hours\nhe had not tasted food.  He could not hope for a meal at Ruth's, for she\nwas away to San Rafael on a two weeks' visit; and for very shame's sake\nhe could not go to his sister's.  To cap misfortune, the postman, in his\nafternoon round, brought him five returned manuscripts.  Then it was that\nMartin wore his overcoat down into Oakland, and came back without it, but\nwith five dollars tinkling in his pocket.  He paid a dollar each on\naccount to the four tradesmen, and in his kitchen fried steak and onions,\nmade coffee, and stewed a large pot of prunes.  And having dined, he sat\ndown at his table-desk and completed before midnight an essay which he\nentitled \"The Dignity of Usury.\"  Having typed it out, he flung it under\nthe table, for there had been nothing left from the five dollars with\nwhich to buy stamps.\n\nLater on he pawned his watch, and still later his wheel, reducing the\namount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and\nsending them out.  He was disappointed with his hack-work.  Nobody cared\nto buy.  He compared it with what he found in the newspapers, weeklies,\nand cheap magazines, and decided that his was better, far better, than\nthe average; yet it would not sell.  Then he discovered that most of the\nnewspapers printed a great deal of what was called \"plate\" stuff, and he\ngot the address of the association that furnished it.  His own work that\nhe sent in was returned, along with a stereotyped slip informing him that\nthe staff supplied all the copy that was needed.\n\nIn one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of\nincident and anecdote.  Here was a chance.  His paragraphs were returned,\nand though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one.  Later\non, when it no longer mattered, he learned that the associate editors and\nsub-editors augmented their salaries by supplying those paragraphs\nthemselves.  The comic weeklies returned his jokes and humorous verse,\nand the light society verse he wrote for the large magazines found no\nabiding-place.  Then there was the newspaper storiette.  He knew that he\ncould write better ones than were published.  Managing to obtain the\naddresses of two newspaper syndicates, he deluged them with storiettes.\nWhen he had written twenty and failed to place one of them, he ceased.\nAnd yet, from day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies,\nscores and scores of storiettes, not one of which would compare with his.\nIn his despondency, he concluded that he had no judgment whatever, that\nhe was hypnotized by what he wrote, and that he was a self-deluded\npretender.\n\nThe inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever.  He folded the stamps\nin with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter-box, and from three\nweeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and handed him\nthe manuscript.  Surely there were no live, warm editors at the other\nend.  It was all wheels and cogs and oil-cups--a clever mechanism\noperated by automatons.  He reached stages of despair wherein he doubted\nif editors existed at all.  He had never received a sign of the existence\nof one, and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he wrote it seemed\nplausible that editors were myths, manufactured and maintained by office\nboys, typesetters, and pressmen.\n\nThe hours he spent with Ruth were the only happy ones he had, and they\nwere not all happy.  He was afflicted always with a gnawing restlessness,\nmore tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed her love; for\nnow that he did possess her love, the possession of her was far away as\never.  He had asked for two years; time was flying, and he was achieving\nnothing.  Again, he was always conscious of the fact that she did not\napprove what he was doing.  She did not say so directly.  Yet indirectly\nshe let him understand it as clearly and definitely as she could have\nspoken it.  It was not resentment with her, but disapproval; though less\nsweet-natured women might have resented where she was no more than\ndisappointed.  Her disappointment lay in that this man she had taken to\nmould, refused to be moulded.  To a certain extent she had found his clay\nplastic, then it had developed stubbornness, declining to be shaped in\nthe image of her father or of Mr. Butler.\n\nWhat was great and strong in him, she missed, or, worse yet,\nmisunderstood.  This man, whose clay was so plastic that he could live in\nany number of pigeonholes of human existence, she thought wilful and most\nobstinate because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole,\nwhich was the only one she knew.  She could not follow the flights of his\nmind, and when his brain got beyond her, she deemed him erratic.  Nobody\nelse's brain ever got beyond her.  She could always follow her father and\nmother, her brothers and Olney; wherefore, when she could not follow\nMartin, she believed the fault lay with him.  It was the old tragedy of\ninsularity trying to serve as mentor to the universal.\n\n\"You worship at the shrine of the established,\" he told her once, in a\ndiscussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater.  \"I grant that as\nauthorities to quote they are most excellent--the two foremost literary\ncritics in the United States.  Every school teacher in the land looks up\nto Vanderwater as the Dean of American criticism.  Yet I read his stuff,\nand it seems to me the perfection of the felicitous expression of the\ninane.  Why, he is no more than a ponderous bromide, thanks to Gelett\nBurgess.  And Praps is no better.  His 'Hemlock Mosses,' for instance is\nbeautifully written.  Not a comma is out of place; and the tone--ah!--is\nlofty, so lofty.  He is the best-paid critic in the United States.\nThough, Heaven forbid! he's not a critic at all.  They do criticism\nbetter in England.\n\n\"But the point is, they sound the popular note, and they sound it so\nbeautifully and morally and contentedly.  Their reviews remind me of a\nBritish Sunday.  They are the popular mouthpieces.  They back up your\nprofessors of English, and your professors of English back them up.  And\nthere isn't an original idea in any of their skulls.  They know only the\nestablished,--in fact, they are the established.  They are weak minded,\nand the established impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of\nthe brewery is impressed on a beer bottle.  And their function is to\ncatch all the young fellows attending the university, to drive out of\ntheir minds any glimmering originality that may chance to be there, and\nto put upon them the stamp of the established.\"\n\n\"I think I am nearer the truth,\" she replied, \"when I stand by the\nestablished, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea\nIslander.\"\n\n\"It was the missionary who did the image breaking,\" he laughed.  \"And\nunfortunately, all the missionaries are off among the heathen, so there\nare none left at home to break those old images, Mr. Vanderwater and Mr.\nPraps.\"\n\n\"And the college professors, as well,\" she added.\n\nHe shook his head emphatically.  \"No; the science professors should live.\nThey're really great.  But it would be a good deed to break the heads of\nnine-tenths of the English professors--little, microscopic-minded\nparrots!\"\n\nWhich was rather severe on the professors, but which to Ruth was\nblasphemy.  She could not help but measure the professors, neat,\nscholarly, in fitting clothes, speaking in well-modulated voices,\nbreathing of culture and refinement, with this almost indescribable young\nfellow whom somehow she loved, whose clothes never would fit him, whose\nheavy muscles told of damning toil, who grew excited when he talked,\nsubstituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance for cool\nself-possession.  They at least earned good salaries and were--yes, she\ncompelled herself to face it--were gentlemen; while he could not earn a\npenny, and he was not as they.\n\nShe did not weigh Martin's words nor judge his argument by them.  Her\nconclusion that his argument was wrong was reached--unconsciously, it is\ntrue--by a comparison of externals.  They, the professors, were right in\ntheir literary judgments because they were successes.  Martin's literary\njudgments were wrong because he could not sell his wares.  To use his own\nphrase, they made good, and he did not make good.  And besides, it did\nnot seem reasonable that he should be right--he who had stood, so short a\ntime before, in that same living room, blushing and awkward,\nacknowledging his introduction, looking fearfully about him at the bric-a-\nbrac his swinging shoulders threatened to break, asking how long since\nSwinburne died, and boastfully announcing that he had read \"Excelsior\"\nand the \"Psalm of Life.\"\n\nUnwittingly, Ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the\nestablished.  Martin followed the processes of her thoughts, but forbore\nto go farther.  He did not love her for what she thought of Praps and\nVanderwater and English professors, and he was coming to realize, with\nincreasing conviction, that he possessed brain-areas and stretches of\nknowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed.\n\nIn music she thought him unreasonable, and in the matter of opera not\nonly unreasonable but wilfully perverse.\n\n\"How did you like it?\" she asked him one night, on the way home from the\nopera.\n\nIt was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month's rigid\neconomizing on food.  After vainly waiting for him to speak about it,\nherself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and heard,\nshe had asked the question.\n\n\"I liked the overture,\" was his answer.  \"It was splendid.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the opera itself?\"\n\n\"That was splendid too; that is, the orchestra was, though I'd have\nenjoyed it more if those jumping-jacks had kept quiet or gone off the\nstage.\"\n\nRuth was aghast.\n\n\"You don't mean Tetralani or Barillo?\" she queried.\n\n\"All of them--the whole kit and crew.\"\n\n\"But they are great artists,\" she protested.\n\n\"They spoiled the music just the same, with their antics and\nunrealities.\"\n\n\"But don't you like Barillo's voice?\" Ruth asked.  \"He is next to Caruso,\nthey say.\"\n\n\"Of course I liked him, and I liked Tetralani even better.  Her voice is\nexquisite--or at least I think so.\"\n\n\"But, but--\" Ruth stammered.  \"I don't know what you mean, then.  You\nadmire their voices, yet say they spoiled the music.\"\n\n\"Precisely that.  I'd give anything to hear them in concert, and I'd give\neven a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing.  I'm\nafraid I am a hopeless realist.  Great singers are not great actors.  To\nhear Barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel, and to hear\nTetralani reply like another angel, and to hear it all accompanied by a\nperfect orgy of glowing and colorful music--is ravishing, most ravishing.\nI do not admit it.  I assert it.  But the whole effect is spoiled when I\nlook at them--at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking feet and\nweighing a hundred and ninety pounds, and at Barillo, a scant five feet\nfour, greasy-featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized blacksmith,\nand at the pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their breasts, flinging\ntheir arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum; and when I am\nexpected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a love-scene\nbetween a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome, romantic, young\nprince--why, I can't accept it, that's all.  It's rot; it's absurd; it's\nunreal.  That's what's the matter with it.  It's not real.  Don't tell me\nthat anybody in this world ever made love that way.  Why, if I'd made\nlove to you in such fashion, you'd have boxed my ears.\"\n\n\"But you misunderstand,\" Ruth protested.  \"Every form of art has its\nlimitations.\"  (She was busy recalling a lecture she had heard at the\nuniversity on the conventions of the arts.)  \"In painting there are only\ntwo dimensions to the canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three\ndimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the\ncanvas.  In writing, again, the author must be omnipotent.  You accept as\nperfectly legitimate the author's account of the secret thoughts of the\nheroine, and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when\nthinking these thoughts, and that neither the author nor any one else was\ncapable of hearing them.  And so with the stage, with sculpture, with\nopera, with every art form.  Certain irreconcilable things must be\naccepted.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understood that,\" Martin answered.  \"All the arts have their\nconventions.\"  (Ruth was surprised at his use of the word.  It was as if\nhe had studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped\nfrom browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.)  \"But even\nthe conventions must be real.  Trees, painted on flat cardboard and stuck\nup on each side of the stage, we accept as a forest.  It is a real enough\nconvention.  But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea scene as a\nforest.  We can't do it.  It violates our senses.  Nor would you, or,\nrather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and agonized\ncontortions of those two lunatics to-night as a convincing portrayal of\nlove.\"\n\n\"But you don't hold yourself superior to all the judges of music?\" she\nprotested.\n\n\"No, no, not for a moment.  I merely maintain my right as an individual.\nI have just been telling you what I think, in order to explain why the\nelephantine gambols of Madame Tetralani spoil the orchestra for me.  The\nworld's judges of music may all be right.  But I am I, and I won't\nsubordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind.  If I don't\nlike a thing, I don't like it, that's all; and there is no reason under\nthe sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of my\nfellow-creatures like it, or make believe they like it.  I can't follow\nthe fashions in the things I like or dislike.\"\n\n\"But music, you know, is a matter of training,\" Ruth argued; \"and opera\nis even more a matter of training.  May it not be--\"\n\n\"That I am not trained in opera?\" he dashed in.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"The very thing,\" he agreed.  \"And I consider I am fortunate in not\nhaving been caught when I was young.  If I had, I could have wept\nsentimental tears to-night, and the clownish antics of that precious pair\nwould have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty of the\naccompanying orchestra.  You are right.  It's mostly a matter of\ntraining.  And I am too old, now.  I must have the real or nothing.  An\nillusion that won't convince is a palpable lie, and that's what grand\nopera is to me when little Barillo throws a fit, clutches mighty\nTetralani in his arms (also in a fit), and tells her how passionately he\nadores her.\"\n\nAgain Ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in\naccordance with her belief in the established.  Who was he that he should\nbe right and all the cultured world wrong?  His words and thoughts made\nno impression upon her.  She was too firmly intrenched in the established\nto have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas.  She had always been used\nto music, and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was a child, and all\nher world had enjoyed it, too.  Then by what right did Martin Eden\nemerge, as he had so recently emerged, from his rag-time and\nworking-class songs, and pass judgment on the world's music?  She was\nvexed with him, and as she walked beside him she had a vague feeling of\noutrage.  At the best, in her most charitable frame of mind, she\nconsidered the statement of his views to be a caprice, an erratic and\nuncalled-for prank.  But when he took her in his arms at the door and\nkissed her good night in tender lover-fashion, she forgot everything in\nthe outrush of her own love to him.  And later, on a sleepless pillow,\nshe puzzled, as she had often puzzled of late, as to how it was that she\nloved so strange a man, and loved him despite the disapproval of her\npeople.\n\nAnd next day Martin Eden cast hack-work aside, and at white heat hammered\nout an essay to which he gave the title, \"The Philosophy of Illusion.\"  A\nstamp started it on its travels, but it was destined to receive many\nstamps and to be started on many travels in the months that followed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nMaria Silva was poor, and all the ways of poverty were clear to her.\nPoverty, to Ruth, was a word signifying a not-nice condition of\nexistence.  That was her total knowledge on the subject.  She knew Martin\nwas poor, and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood\nof Abraham Lincoln, of Mr. Butler, and of other men who had become\nsuccesses.  Also, while aware that poverty was anything but delectable,\nshe had a comfortable middle-class feeling that poverty was salutary,\nthat it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not\ndegraded and hopeless drudges.  So that her knowledge that Martin was so\npoor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her.  She\neven considered it the hopeful side of the situation, believing that\nsooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his\nwriting.\n\nRuth never read hunger in Martin's face, which had grown lean and had\nenlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks.  In fact, she marked the\nchange in his face with satisfaction.  It seemed to refine him, to remove\nfrom him much of the dross of flesh and the too animal-like vigor that\nlured her while she detested it.  Sometimes, when with her, she noted an\nunusual brightness in his eyes, and she admired it, for it made him\nappear more the poet and the scholar--the things he would have liked to\nbe and which she would have liked him to be.  But Maria Silva read a\ndifferent tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes, and she noted\nthe changes in them from day to day, by them following the ebb and flow\nof his fortunes.  She saw him leave the house with his overcoat and\nreturn without it, though the day was chill and raw, and promptly she saw\nhis cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger leave his eyes.  In\nthe same way she had seen his wheel and watch go, and after each event\nshe had seen his vigor bloom again.\n\nLikewise she watched his toils, and knew the measure of the midnight oil\nhe burned.  Work!  She knew that he outdid her, though his work was of a\ndifferent order.  And she was surprised to behold that the less food he\nhad, the harder he worked.  On occasion, in a casual sort of way, when\nshe thought hunger pinched hardest, she would send him in a loaf of new\nbaking, awkwardly covering the act with banter to the effect that it was\nbetter than he could bake.  And again, she would send one of her toddlers\nin to him with a great pitcher of hot soup, debating inwardly the while\nwhether she was justified in taking it from the mouths of her own flesh\nand blood.  Nor was Martin ungrateful, knowing as he did the lives of the\npoor, and that if ever in the world there was charity, this was it.\n\nOn a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house,\nMaria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine.  Martin,\ncoming into her kitchen to fetch water, was invited to sit down and\ndrink.  He drank her very-good health, and in return she drank his.  Then\nshe drank to prosperity in his undertakings, and he drank to the hope\nthat James Grant would show up and pay her for his washing.  James Grant\nwas a journeymen carpenter who did not always pay his bills and who owed\nMaria three dollars.\n\nBoth Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs, and it\nwent swiftly to their heads.  Utterly differentiated creatures that they\nwere, they were lonely in their misery, and though the misery was tacitly\nignored, it was the bond that drew them together.  Maria was amazed to\nlearn that he had been in the Azores, where she had lived until she was\neleven.  She was doubly amazed that he had been in the Hawaiian Islands,\nwhither she had migrated from the Azores with her people.  But her\namazement passed all bounds when he told her he had been on Maui, the\nparticular island whereon she had attained womanhood and married.\nKahului, where she had first met her husband,--he, Martin, had been there\ntwice!  Yes, she remembered the sugar steamers, and he had been on\nthem--well, well, it was a small world.  And Wailuku!  That place, too!\nDid he know the head-luna of the plantation?  Yes, and had had a couple\nof drinks with him.\n\nAnd so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw, sour wine.\nTo Martin the future did not seem so dim.  Success trembled just before\nhim.  He was on the verge of clasping it.  Then he studied the deep-lined\nface of the toil-worn woman before him, remembered her soups and loaves\nof new baking, and felt spring up in him the warmest gratitude and\nphilanthropy.\n\n\"Maria,\" he exclaimed suddenly.  \"What would you like to have?\"\n\nShe looked at him, bepuzzled.\n\n\"What would you like to have now, right now, if you could get it?\"\n\n\"Shoe alla da roun' for da childs--seven pairs da shoe.\"\n\n\"You shall have them,\" he announced, while she nodded her head gravely.\n\"But I mean a big wish, something big that you want.\"\n\nHer eyes sparkled good-naturedly.  He was choosing to make fun with her,\nMaria, with whom few made fun these days.\n\n\"Think hard,\" he cautioned, just as she was opening her mouth to speak.\n\n\"Alla right,\" she answered.  \"I thinka da hard.  I lika da house, dis\nhouse--all mine, no paya da rent, seven dollar da month.\"\n\n\"You shall have it,\" he granted, \"and in a short time.  Now wish the\ngreat wish.  Make believe I am God, and I say to you anything you want\nyou can have.  Then you wish that thing, and I listen.\"\n\nMaria considered solemnly for a space.\n\n\"You no 'fraid?\" she asked warningly.\n\n\"No, no,\" he laughed, \"I'm not afraid.  Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Most verra big,\" she warned again.\n\n\"All right.  Fire away.\"\n\n\"Well, den--\"  She drew a big breath like a child, as she voiced to the\nuttermost all she cared to demand of life.  \"I lika da have one milka\nranch--good milka ranch.  Plenty cow, plenty land, plenty grass.  I lika\nda have near San Le-an; my sister liva dere.  I sella da milk in Oakland.\nI maka da plentee mon.  Joe an' Nick no runna da cow.  Dey go-a to\nschool.  Bimeby maka da good engineer, worka da railroad.  Yes, I lika da\nmilka ranch.\"\n\nShe paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes.\n\n\"You shall have it,\" he answered promptly.\n\nShe nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine-glass\nand to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given.  His heart\nwas right, and in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much as\nif the gift had gone with it.\n\n\"No, Maria,\" he went on; \"Nick and Joe won't have to peddle milk, and all\nthe kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year round.  It will\nbe a first-class milk ranch--everything complete.  There will be a house\nto live in and a stable for the horses, and cow-barns, of course.  There\nwill be chickens, pigs, vegetables, fruit trees, and everything like\nthat; and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two.  Then\nyou won't have anything to do but take care of the children.  For that\nmatter, if you find a good man, you can marry and take it easy while he\nruns the ranch.\"\n\nAnd from such largess, dispensed from his future, Martin turned and took\nhis one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop.  His plight was desperate\nfor him to do this, for it cut him off from Ruth.  He had no second-best\nsuit that was presentable, and though he could go to the butcher and the\nbaker, and even on occasion to his sister's, it was beyond all daring to\ndream of entering the Morse home so disreputably apparelled.\n\nHe toiled on, miserable and well-nigh hopeless.  It began to appear to\nhim that the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to work.\nIn doing this he would satisfy everybody--the grocer, his sister, Ruth,\nand even Maria, to whom he owed a month's room rent.  He was two months\nbehind with his type-writer, and the agency was clamoring for payment or\nfor the return of the machine.  In desperation, all but ready to\nsurrender, to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh start, he\ntook the civil service examinations for the Railway Mail.  To his\nsurprise, he passed first.  The job was assured, though when the call\nwould come to enter upon his duties nobody knew.\n\nIt was at this time, at the lowest ebb, that the smooth-running editorial\nmachine broke down.  A cog must have slipped or an oil-cup run dry, for\nthe postman brought him one morning a short, thin envelope.  Martin\nglanced at the upper left-hand corner and read the name and address of\nthe Transcontinental Monthly.  His heart gave a great leap, and he\nsuddenly felt faint, the sinking feeling accompanied by a strange\ntrembling of the knees.  He staggered into his room and sat down on the\nbed, the envelope still unopened, and in that moment came understanding\nto him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of extraordinarily good\nnews.\n\nOf course this was good news.  There was no manuscript in that thin\nenvelope, therefore it was an acceptance.  He knew the story in the hands\nof the Transcontinental.  It was \"The Ring of Bells,\" one of his horror\nstories, and it was an even five thousand words.  And, since first-class\nmagazines always paid on acceptance, there was a check inside.  Two cents\na word--twenty dollars a thousand; the check must be a hundred dollars.\nOne hundred dollars!  As he tore the envelope open, every item of all his\ndebts surged in his brain--$3.85 to the grocer; butcher $4.00 flat;\nbaker, $2.00; fruit store, $5.00; total, $14.85.  Then there was room\nrent, $2.50; another month in advance, $2.50; two months' type-writer,\n$8.00; a month in advance, $4.00; total, $31.85.  And finally to be\nadded, his pledges, plus interest, with the pawnbroker--watch, $5.50;\novercoat, $5.50; wheel, $7.75; suit of clothes, $5.50 (60 % interest, but\nwhat did it matter?)--grand total, $56.10.  He saw, as if visible in the\nair before him, in illuminated figures, the whole sum, and the\nsubtraction that followed and that gave a remainder of $43.90.  When he\nhad squared every debt, redeemed every pledge, he would still have\njingling in his pockets a princely $43.90.  And on top of that he would\nhave a month's rent paid in advance on the type-writer and on the room.\n\nBy this time he had drawn the single sheet of type-written letter out and\nspread it open.  There was no check.  He peered into the envelope, held\nit to the light, but could not trust his eyes, and in trembling haste\ntore the envelope apart.  There was no check.  He read the letter,\nskimming it line by line, dashing through the editor's praise of his\nstory to the meat of the letter, the statement why the check had not been\nsent.  He found no such statement, but he did find that which made him\nsuddenly wilt.  The letter slid from his hand.  His eyes went\nlack-lustre, and he lay back on the pillow, pulling the blanket about him\nand up to his chin.\n\nFive dollars for \"The Ring of Bells\"--five dollars for five thousand\nwords!  Instead of two cents a word, ten words for a cent!  And the\neditor had praised it, too.  And he would receive the check when the\nstory was published.  Then it was all poppycock, two cents a word for\nminimum rate and payment upon acceptance.  It was a lie, and it had led\nhim astray.  He would never have attempted to write had he known that.  He\nwould have gone to work--to work for Ruth.  He went back to the day he\nfirst attempted to write, and was appalled at the enormous waste of\ntime--and all for ten words for a cent.  And the other high rewards of\nwriters, that he had read about, must be lies, too.  His second-hand\nideas of authorship were wrong, for here was the proof of it.\n\nThe Transcontinental sold for twenty-five cents, and its dignified and\nartistic cover proclaimed it as among the first-class magazines.  It was\na staid, respectable magazine, and it had been published continuously\nsince long before he was born.  Why, on the outside cover were printed\nevery month the words of one of the world's great writers, words\nproclaiming the inspired mission of the Transcontinental by a star of\nliterature whose first coruscations had appeared inside those self-same\ncovers.  And the high and lofty, heaven-inspired Transcontinental paid\nfive dollars for five thousand words!  The great writer had recently died\nin a foreign land--in dire poverty, Martin remembered, which was not to\nbe wondered at, considering the magnificent pay authors receive.\n\nWell, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and their\npay, and he had wasted two years over it.  But he would disgorge the bait\nnow.  Not another line would he ever write.  He would do what Ruth wanted\nhim to do, what everybody wanted him to do--get a job.  The thought of\ngoing to work reminded him of Joe--Joe, tramping through the land of\nnothing-to-do.  Martin heaved a great sigh of envy.  The reaction of\nnineteen hours a day for many days was strong upon him.  But then, Joe\nwas not in love, had none of the responsibilities of love, and he could\nafford to loaf through the land of nothing-to-do.  He, Martin, had\nsomething to work for, and go to work he would.  He would start out early\nnext morning to hunt a job.  And he would let Ruth know, too, that he had\nmended his ways and was willing to go into her father's office.\n\nFive dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent, the market\nprice for art.  The disappointment of it, the lie of it, the infamy of\nit, were uppermost in his thoughts; and under his closed eyelids, in\nfiery figures, burned the \"$3.85\" he owed the grocer.  He shivered, and\nwas aware of an aching in his bones.  The small of his back ached\nespecially.  His head ached, the top of it ached, the back of it ached,\nthe brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling, while the ache\nover his brows was intolerable.  And beneath the brows, planted under his\nlids, was the merciless \"$3.85.\"  He opened his eyes to escape it, but\nthe white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him to\nclose his eyes, when the \"$3.85\" confronted him again.\n\nFive dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent--that\nparticular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could no\nmore escape it than he could the \"$3.85\" under his eyelids.  A change\nseemed to come over the latter, and he watched curiously, till \"$2.00\"\nburned in its stead.  Ah, he thought, that was the baker.  The next sum\nthat appeared was \"$2.50.\"  It puzzled him, and he pondered it as if life\nand death hung on the solution.  He owed somebody two dollars and a half,\nthat was certain, but who was it?  To find it was the task set him by an\nimperious and malignant universe, and he wandered through the endless\ncorridors of his mind, opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers\nstored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought\nthe answer.  After several centuries it came to him, easily, without\neffort, that it was Maria.  With a great relief he turned his soul to the\nscreen of torment under his lids.  He had solved the problem; now he\ncould rest.  But no, the \"$2.50\" faded away, and in its place burned\n\"$8.00.\"  Who was that?  He must go the dreary round of his mind again\nand find out.\n\nHow long he was gone on this quest he did not know, but after what seemed\nan enormous lapse of time, he was called back to himself by a knock at\nthe door, and by Maria's asking if he was sick.  He replied in a muffled\nvoice he did not recognize, saying that he was merely taking a nap.  He\nwas surprised when he noted the darkness of night in the room.  He had\nreceived the letter at two in the afternoon, and he realized that he was\nsick.\n\nThen the \"$8.00\" began to smoulder under his lids again, and he returned\nhimself to servitude.  But he grew cunning.  There was no need for him to\nwander through his mind.  He had been a fool.  He pulled a lever and made\nhis mind revolve about him, a monstrous wheel of fortune, a\nmerry-go-round of memory, a revolving sphere of wisdom.  Faster and\nfaster it revolved, until its vortex sucked him in and he was flung\nwhirling through black chaos.\n\nQuite naturally he found himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs.  But\nas he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs.  It was a new way of\nmarking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw \"$3.85\" on one\nof the cuffs.  Then it came to him that it was the grocer's bill, and\nthat these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle.  A\ncrafty idea came to him.  He would throw the bills on the floor and so\nescape paying them.  No sooner thought than done, and he crumpled the\ncuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor.  Ever\nthe heap grew, and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times, he\nfound only one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed Maria.\nThat meant that Maria would not press for payment, and he resolved\ngenerously that it would be the only one he would pay; so he began\nsearching through the cast-out heap for hers.  He sought it desperately,\nfor ages, and was still searching when the manager of the hotel entered,\nthe fat Dutchman.  His face blazed with wrath, and he shouted in\nstentorian tones that echoed down the universe, \"I shall deduct the cost\nof those cuffs from your wages!\"  The pile of cuffs grew into a mountain,\nand Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand years to pay\nfor them.  Well, there was nothing left to do but kill the manager and\nburn down the laundry.  But the big Dutchman frustrated him, seizing him\nby the nape of the neck and dancing him up and down.  He danced him over\nthe ironing tables, the stove, and the mangles, and out into the wash-\nroom and over the wringer and washer.  Martin was danced until his teeth\nrattled and his head ached, and he marvelled that the Dutchman was so\nstrong.\n\nAnd then he found himself before the mangle, this time receiving the\ncuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side.  Each cuff\nwas a check, and Martin went over them anxiously, in a fever of\nexpectation, but they were all blanks.  He stood there and received the\nblanks for a million years or so, never letting one go by for fear it\nmight be filled out.  At last he found it.  With trembling fingers he\nheld it to the light.  It was for five dollars.  \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the\neditor across the mangle.  \"Well, then, I shall kill you,\" Martin said.\nHe went out into the wash-room to get the axe, and found Joe starching\nmanuscripts.  He tried to make him desist, then swung the axe for him.\nBut the weapon remained poised in mid-air, for Martin found himself back\nin the ironing room in the midst of a snow-storm.  No, it was not snow\nthat was falling, but checks of large denomination, the smallest not less\nthan a thousand dollars.  He began to collect them and sort them out, in\npackages of a hundred, tying each package securely with twine.\n\nHe looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling flat-\nirons, starched shirts, and manuscripts.  Now and again he reached out\nand added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared through\nthe roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle.  Martin struck at him,\nbut he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle.  Then he plucked\nMartin and added him.  Martin went up through the roof, clutching at\nmanuscripts, so that by the time he came down he had a large armful.  But\nno sooner down than up again, and a second and a third time and countless\ntimes he flew around the circle.  From far off he could hear a childish\ntreble singing: \"Waltz me around again, Willie, around, around, around.\"\n\nHe recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks, starched\nshirts, and manuscripts, and prepared, when he came down, to kill Joe.\nBut he did not come down.  Instead, at two in the morning, Maria, having\nheard his groans through the thin partition, came into his room, to put\nhot flat-irons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nMartin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning.  It was late\nafternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching eyes\nabout the room.  Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight years old,\nkeeping watch, raised a screech at sight of his returning consciousness.\nMaria hurried into the room from the kitchen.  She put her work-calloused\nhand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse.\n\n\"You lika da eat?\" she asked.\n\nHe shook his head.  Eating was farthest from his desire, and he wondered\nthat he should ever have been hungry in his life.\n\n\"I'm sick, Maria,\" he said weakly.  \"What is it?  Do you know?\"\n\n\"Grip,\" she answered.  \"Two or three days you alla da right.  Better you\nno eat now.  Bimeby plenty can eat, to-morrow can eat maybe.\"\n\nMartin was not used to sickness, and when Maria and her little girl left\nhim, he essayed to get up and dress.  By a supreme exertion of will, with\nrearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep them open, he\nmanaged to get out of bed, only to be left stranded by his senses upon\nthe table.  Half an hour later he managed to regain the bed, where he was\ncontent to lie with closed eyes and analyze his various pains and\nweaknesses.  Maria came in several times to change the cold cloths on his\nforehead.  Otherwise she left him in peace, too wise to vex him with\nchatter.  This moved him to gratitude, and he murmured to himself,\n\"Maria, you getta da milka ranch, all righta, all right.\"\n\nThen he remembered his long-buried past of yesterday.\n\nIt seemed a life-time since he had received that letter from the\nTranscontinental, a life-time since it was all over and done with and a\nnew page turned.  He had shot his bolt, and shot it hard, and now he was\ndown on his back.  If he hadn't starved himself, he wouldn't have been\ncaught by La Grippe.  He had been run down, and he had not had the\nstrength to throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system.\nThis was what resulted.\n\n\"What does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own\nlife?\" he demanded aloud.  \"This is no place for me.  No more literature\nin mine.  Me for the counting-house and ledger, the monthly salary, and\nthe little home with Ruth.\"\n\nTwo days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a\ncup of tea, he asked for his mail, but found his eyes still hurt too much\nto permit him to read.\n\n\"You read for me, Maria,\" he said.  \"Never mind the big, long letters.\nThrow them under the table.  Read me the small letters.\"\n\n\"No can,\" was the answer.  \"Teresa, she go to school, she can.\"\n\nSo Teresa Silva, aged nine, opened his letters and read them to him.  He\nlistened absently to a long dun from the type-writer people, his mind\nbusy with ways and means of finding a job.  Suddenly he was shocked back\nto himself.\n\n\"'We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your story,'\"\nTeresa slowly spelled out, \"'provided you allow us to make the\nalterations suggested.'\"\n\n\"What magazine is that?\" Martin shouted.  \"Here, give it to me!\"\n\nHe could see to read, now, and he was unaware of the pain of the action.\nIt was the White Mouse that was offering him forty dollars, and the story\nwas \"The Whirlpool,\" another of his early horror stories.  He read the\nletter through again and again.  The editor told him plainly that he had\nnot handled the idea properly, but that it was the idea they were buying\nbecause it was original.  If they could cut the story down one-third,\nthey would take it and send him forty dollars on receipt of his answer.\n\nHe called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story\ndown three-thirds if he wanted to, and to send the forty dollars right\nalong.\n\nThe letter despatched to the letter-box by Teresa, Martin lay back and\nthought.  It wasn't a lie, after all.  The White Mouse paid on\nacceptance.  There were three thousand words in \"The Whirlpool.\"  Cut\ndown a third, there would be two thousand.  At forty dollars that would\nbe two cents a word.  Pay on acceptance and two cents a word--the\nnewspapers had told the truth.  And he had thought the White Mouse a\nthird-rater!  It was evident that he did not know the magazines.  He had\ndeemed the Transcontinental a first-rater, and it paid a cent for ten\nwords.  He had classed the White Mouse as of no account, and it paid\ntwenty times as much as the Transcontinental and also had paid on\nacceptance.\n\nWell, there was one thing certain: when he got well, he would not go out\nlooking for a job.  There were more stories in his head as good as \"The\nWhirlpool,\" and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more than in\nany job or position.  Just when he thought the battle lost, it was won.\nHe had proved for his career.  The way was clear.  Beginning with the\nWhite Mouse he would add magazine after magazine to his growing list of\npatrons.  Hack-work could be put aside.  For that matter, it had been\nwasted time, for it had not brought him a dollar.  He would devote\nhimself to work, good work, and he would pour out the best that was in\nhim.  He wished Ruth was there to share in his joy, and when he went over\nthe letters left lying on his bed, he found one from her.  It was sweetly\nreproachful, wondering what had kept him away for so dreadful a length of\ntime.  He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling over her handwriting,\nloving each stroke of her pen, and in the end kissing her signature.\n\nAnd when he answered, he told her recklessly that he had not been to see\nher because his best clothes were in pawn.  He told her that he had been\nsick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two\nweeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return) he\nwould redeem his clothes and be with her.\n\nBut Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks.  Besides, her lover\nwas sick.  The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur, she arrived in the\nMorse carriage, to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of all\nthe urchins on the street, and to the consternation of Maria.  She boxed\nthe ears of the Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny front\nporch, and in more than usual atrocious English tried to apologize for\nher appearance.  Sleeves rolled up from soap-flecked arms and a wet gunny-\nsack around her waist told of the task at which she had been caught.  So\nflustered was she by two such grand young people asking for her lodger,\nthat she forgot to invite them to sit down in the little parlor.  To\nenter Martin's room, they passed through the kitchen, warm and moist and\nsteamy from the big washing in progress.  Maria, in her excitement,\njammed the bedroom and bedroom-closet doors together, and for five\nminutes, through the partly open door, clouds of steam, smelling of soap-\nsuds and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.\n\nRuth succeeded in veering right and left and right again, and in running\nthe narrow passage between table and bed to Martin's side; but Arthur\nveered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and pans in\nthe corner where Martin did his cooking.  Arthur did not linger long.\nRuth occupied the only chair, and having done his duty, he went outside\nand stood by the gate, the centre of seven marvelling Silvas, who watched\nhim as they would have watched a curiosity in a side-show.  All about the\ncarriage were gathered the children from a dozen blocks, waiting and\neager for some tragic and terrible denouement.  Carriages were seen on\ntheir street only for weddings and funerals.  Here was neither marriage\nnor death: therefore, it was something transcending experience and well\nworth waiting for.\n\nMartin had been wild to see Ruth.  His was essentially a love-nature, and\nhe possessed more than the average man's need for sympathy.  He was\nstarving for sympathy, which, with him, meant intelligent understanding;\nand he had yet to learn that Ruth's sympathy was largely sentimental and\ntactful, and that it proceeded from gentleness of nature rather than from\nunderstanding of the objects of her sympathy.  So it was while Martin\nheld her hand and gladly talked, that her love for him prompted her to\npress his hand in return, and that her eyes were moist and luminous at\nsight of his helplessness and of the marks suffering had stamped upon his\nface.\n\nBut while he told her of his two acceptances, of his despair when he\nreceived the one from the Transcontinental, and of the corresponding\ndelight with which he received the one from the White Mouse, she did not\nfollow him.  She heard the words he uttered and understood their literal\nimport, but she was not with him in his despair and his delight.  She\ncould not get out of herself.  She was not interested in selling stories\nto magazines.  What was important to her was matrimony.  She was not\naware of it, however, any more than she was aware that her desire that\nMartin take a position was the instinctive and preparative impulse of\nmotherhood.  She would have blushed had she been told as much in plain,\nset terms, and next, she might have grown indignant and asserted that her\nsole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire for him to make the\nbest of himself.  So, while Martin poured out his heart to her, elated\nwith the first success his chosen work in the world had received, she\npaid heed to his bare words only, gazing now and again about the room,\nshocked by what she saw.\n\nFor the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty.  Starving\nlovers had always seemed romantic to her,--but she had had no idea how\nstarving lovers lived.  She had never dreamed it could be like this.  Ever\nher gaze shifted from the room to him and back again.  The steamy smell\nof dirty clothes, which had entered with her from the kitchen, was\nsickening.  Martin must be soaked with it, Ruth concluded, if that awful\nwoman washed frequently.  Such was the contagiousness of degradation.\nWhen she looked at Martin, she seemed to see the smirch left upon him by\nhis surroundings.  She had never seen him unshaven, and the three days'\ngrowth of beard on his face was repulsive to her.  Not alone did it give\nhim the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva house, inside and out,\nbut it seemed to emphasize that animal-like strength of his which she\ndetested.  And here he was, being confirmed in his madness by the two\nacceptances he took such pride in telling her about.  A little longer and\nhe would have surrendered and gone to work.  Now he would continue on in\nthis horrible house, writing and starving for a few more months.\n\n\"What is that smell?\" she asked suddenly.\n\n\"Some of Maria's washing smells, I imagine,\" was the answer.  \"I am\ngrowing quite accustomed to them.\"\n\n\"No, no; not that.  It is something else.  A stale, sickish smell.\"\n\nMartin sampled the air before replying.\n\n\"I can't smell anything else, except stale tobacco smoke,\" he announced.\n\n\"That's it.  It is terrible.  Why do you smoke so much, Martin?\"\n\n\"I don't know, except that I smoke more than usual when I am lonely.  And\nthen, too, it's such a long-standing habit.  I learned when I was only a\nyoungster.\"\n\n\"It is not a nice habit, you know,\" she reproved.  \"It smells to heaven.\"\n\n\"That's the fault of the tobacco.  I can afford only the cheapest.  But\nwait until I get that forty-dollar check.  I'll use a brand that is not\noffensive even to the angels.  But that wasn't so bad, was it, two\nacceptances in three days?  That forty-five dollars will pay about all my\ndebts.\"\n\n\"For two years' work?\" she queried.\n\n\"No, for less than a week's work.  Please pass me that book over on the\nfar corner of the table, the account book with the gray cover.\"  He\nopened it and began turning over the pages rapidly.  \"Yes, I was right.\nFour days for 'The Ring of Bells,' two days for 'The Whirlpool.'  That's\nforty-five dollars for a week's work, one hundred and eighty dollars a\nmonth.  That beats any salary I can command.  And, besides, I'm just\nbeginning.  A thousand dollars a month is not too much to buy for you all\nI want you to have.  A salary of five hundred a month would be too small.\nThat forty-five dollars is just a starter.  Wait till I get my stride.\nThen watch my smoke.\"\n\nRuth misunderstood his slang, and reverted to cigarettes.\n\n\"You smoke more than enough as it is, and the brand of tobacco will make\nno difference.  It is the smoking itself that is not nice, no matter what\nthe brand may be.  You are a chimney, a living volcano, a perambulating\nsmoke-stack, and you are a perfect disgrace, Martin dear, you know you\nare.\"\n\nShe leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes, and as he looked at her\ndelicate face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck\nwith his own unworthiness.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't smoke any more,\" she whispered.  \"Please, for--my\nsake.\"\n\n\"All right, I won't,\" he cried.  \"I'll do anything you ask, dear love,\nanything; you know that.\"\n\nA great temptation assailed her.  In an insistent way she had caught\nglimpses of the large, easy-going side of his nature, and she felt sure,\nif she asked him to cease attempting to write, that he would grant her\nwish.  In the swift instant that elapsed, the words trembled on her lips.\nBut she did not utter them.  She was not quite brave enough; she did not\nquite dare.  Instead, she leaned toward him to meet him, and in his arms\nmurmured:-\n\n\"You know, it is really not for my sake, Martin, but for your own.  I am\nsure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good to be a slave to\nanything, to a drug least of all.\"\n\n\"I shall always be your slave,\" he smiled.\n\n\"In which case, I shall begin issuing my commands.\"\n\nShe looked at him mischievously, though deep down she was already\nregretting that she had not preferred her largest request.\n\n\"I live but to obey, your majesty.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my first commandment is, Thou shalt not omit to shave every\nday.  Look how you have scratched my cheek.\"\n\nAnd so it ended in caresses and love-laughter.  But she had made one\npoint, and she could not expect to make more than one at a time.  She\nfelt a woman's pride in that she had made him stop smoking.  Another time\nshe would persuade him to take a position, for had he not said he would\ndo anything she asked?\n\nShe left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes-lines of\nnotes overhead, learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending\nhis wheel under the ceiling, and being saddened by the heap of\nmanuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much wasted\ntime.  The oil-stove won her admiration, but on investigating the food\nshelves she found them empty.\n\n\"Why, you haven't anything to eat, you poor dear,\" she said with tender\ncompassion.  \"You must be starving.\"\n\n\"I store my food in Maria's safe and in her pantry,\" he lied.  \"It keeps\nbetter there.  No danger of my starving.  Look at that.\"\n\nShe had come back to his side, and she saw him double his arm at the\nelbow, the biceps crawling under his shirt-sleeve and swelling into a\nknot of muscle, heavy and hard.  The sight repelled her.  Sentimentally,\nshe disliked it.  But her pulse, her blood, every fibre of her, loved it\nand yearned for it, and, in the old, inexplicable way, she leaned toward\nhim, not away from him.  And in the moment that followed, when he crushed\nher in his arms, the brain of her, concerned with the superficial aspects\nof life, was in revolt; while the heart of her, the woman of her,\nconcerned with life itself, exulted triumphantly.  It was in moments like\nthis that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of her love for Martin,\nfor it was almost a swoon of delight to her to feel his strong arms about\nher, holding her tightly, hurting her with the grip of their fervor.  At\nsuch moments she found justification for her treason to her standards,\nfor her violation of her own high ideals, and, most of all, for her tacit\ndisobedience to her mother and father.  They did not want her to marry\nthis man.  It shocked them that she should love him.  It shocked her,\ntoo, sometimes, when she was apart from him, a cool and reasoning\ncreature.  With him, she loved him--in truth, at times a vexed and\nworried love; but love it was, a love that was stronger than she.\n\n\"This La Grippe is nothing,\" he was saying.  \"It hurts a bit, and gives\none a nasty headache, but it doesn't compare with break-bone fever.\"\n\n\"Have you had that, too?\" she queried absently, intent on the heaven-sent\njustification she was finding in his arms.\n\nAnd so, with absent queries, she led him on, till suddenly his words\nstartled her.\n\nHe had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of the\nHawaiian Islands.\n\n\"But why did you go there?\" she demanded.\n\nSuch royal carelessness of body seemed criminal.\n\n\"Because I didn't know,\" he answered.  \"I never dreamed of lepers.  When\nI deserted the schooner and landed on the beach, I headed inland for some\nplace of hiding.  For three days I lived off guavas, ohia-apples, and\nbananas, all of which grew wild in the jungle.  On the fourth day I found\nthe trail--a mere foot-trail.  It led inland, and it led up.  It was the\nway I wanted to go, and it showed signs of recent travel.  At one place\nit ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a knife-edge.  The\ntrail wasn't three feet wide on the crest, and on either side the ridge\nfell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep.  One man, with plenty of\nammunition, could have held it against a hundred thousand.\n\n\"It was the only way in to the hiding-place.  Three hours after I found\nthe trail I was there, in a little mountain valley, a pocket in the midst\nof lava peaks.  The whole place was terraced for taro-patches, fruit\ntrees grew there, and there were eight or ten grass huts.  But as soon as\nI saw the inhabitants I knew what I'd struck.  One sight of them was\nenough.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" Ruth demanded breathlessly, listening, like any\nDesdemona, appalled and fascinated.\n\n\"Nothing for me to do.  Their leader was a kind old fellow, pretty far\ngone, but he ruled like a king.  He had discovered the little valley and\nfounded the settlement--all of which was against the law.  But he had\nguns, plenty of ammunition, and those Kanakas, trained to the shooting of\nwild cattle and wild pig, were dead shots.  No, there wasn't any running\naway for Martin Eden.  He stayed--for three months.\"\n\n\"But how did you escape?\"\n\n\"I'd have been there yet, if it hadn't been for a girl there, a\nhalf-Chinese, quarter-white, and quarter-Hawaiian.  She was a beauty,\npoor thing, and well educated.  Her mother, in Honolulu, was worth a\nmillion or so.  Well, this girl got me away at last.  Her mother financed\nthe settlement, you see, so the girl wasn't afraid of being punished for\nletting me go.  But she made me swear, first, never to reveal the hiding-\nplace; and I never have.  This is the first time I have even mentioned\nit.  The girl had just the first signs of leprosy.  The fingers of her\nright hand were slightly twisted, and there was a small spot on her arm.\nThat was all.  I guess she is dead, now.\"\n\n\"But weren't you frightened?  And weren't you glad to get away without\ncatching that dreadful disease?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he confessed, \"I was a bit shivery at first; but I got used to\nit.  I used to feel sorry for that poor girl, though.  That made me\nforget to be afraid.  She was such a beauty, in spirit as well as in\nappearance, and she was only slightly touched; yet she was doomed to lie\nthere, living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away.\nLeprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it.\"\n\n\"Poor thing,\" Ruth murmured softly.  \"It's a wonder she let you get\naway.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" Martin asked unwittingly.\n\n\"Because she must have loved you,\" Ruth said, still softly.  \"Candidly,\nnow, didn't she?\"\n\nMartin's sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by the\nindoor life he was living, while the hunger and the sickness had made his\nface even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of a blush.\nHe was opening his mouth to speak, but Ruth shut him off.\n\n\"Never mind, don't answer; it's not necessary,\" she laughed.\n\nBut it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter, and\nthat the light in her eyes was cold.  On the spur of the moment it\nreminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific.  And\nfor the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes--a gale at\nnight, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas glinting\ncoldly in the moonlight.  Next, he saw the girl in the leper refuge and\nremembered it was for love of him that she had let him go.\n\n\"She was noble,\" he said simply.  \"She gave me life.\"\n\nThat was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her\nthroat, and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the\nwindow.  When she turned it back to him, it was composed, and there was\nno hint of the gale in her eyes.\n\n\"I'm such a silly,\" she said plaintively.  \"But I can't help it.  I do so\nlove you, Martin, I do, I do.  I shall grow more catholic in time, but at\npresent I can't help being jealous of those ghosts of the past, and you\nknow your past is full of ghosts.\"\n\n\"It must be,\" she silenced his protest.  \"It could not be otherwise.  And\nthere's poor Arthur motioning me to come.  He's tired waiting.  And now\ngood-by, dear.\"\n\n\"There's some kind of a mixture, put up by the druggists, that helps men\nto stop the use of tobacco,\" she called back from the door, \"and I am\ngoing to send you some.\"\n\nThe door closed, but opened again.\n\n\"I do, I do,\" she whispered to him; and this time she was really gone.\n\nMaria, with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the\ntexture of Ruth's garments and the cut of them (a cut unknown that\nproduced an effect mysteriously beautiful), saw her to the carriage.  The\ncrowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared from\nview, then transferred their stare to Maria, who had abruptly become the\nmost important person on the street.  But it was one of her progeny who\nblasted Maria's reputation by announcing that the grand visitors had been\nfor her lodger.  After that Maria dropped back into her old obscurity and\nMartin began to notice the respectful manner in which he was regarded by\nthe small fry of the neighborhood.  As for Maria, Martin rose in her\nestimation a full hundred per cent, and had the Portuguese grocer\nwitnessed that afternoon carriage-call he would have allowed Martin an\nadditional three-dollars-and-eighty-five-cents' worth of credit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nThe sun of Martin's good fortune rose.  The day after Ruth's visit, he\nreceived a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in\npayment for three of his triolets.  Two days later a newspaper published\nin Chicago accepted his \"Treasure Hunters,\" promising to pay ten dollars\nfor it on publication.  The price was small, but it was the first article\nhe had written, his very first attempt to express his thought on the\nprinted page.  To cap everything, the adventure serial for boys, his\nsecond attempt, was accepted before the end of the week by a juvenile\nmonthly calling itself Youth and Age.  It was true the serial was twenty-\none thousand words, and they offered to pay him sixteen dollars on\npublication, which was something like seventy-five cents a thousand\nwords; but it was equally true that it was the second thing he had\nattempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly aware of its clumsy\nworthlessness.\n\nBut even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of\nmediocrity.  What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great\nstrength--the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes\nbutterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a\nwar-club.  So it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for\nsongs.  He knew them for what they were, and it had not taken him long to\nacquire this knowledge.  What he pinned his faith to was his later work.\nHe had striven to be something more than a mere writer of magazine\nfiction.  He had sought to equip himself with the tools of artistry.  On\nthe other hand, he had not sacrificed strength.  His conscious aim had\nbeen to increase his strength by avoiding excess of strength.  Nor had he\ndeparted from his love of reality.  His work was realism, though he had\nendeavored to fuse with it the fancies and beauties of imagination.  What\nhe sought was an impassioned realism, shot through with human aspiration\nand faith.  What he wanted was life as it was, with all its\nspirit-groping and soul-reaching left in.\n\nHe had discovered, in the course of his reading, two schools of fiction.\nOne treated of man as a god, ignoring his earthly origin; the other\ntreated of man as a clod, ignoring his heaven-sent dreams and divine\npossibilities.  Both the god and the clod schools erred, in Martin's\nestimation, and erred through too great singleness of sight and purpose.\nThere was a compromise that approximated the truth, though it flattered\nnot the school of god, while it challenged the brute-savageness of the\nschool of clod.  It was his story, \"Adventure,\" which had dragged with\nRuth, that Martin believed had achieved his ideal of the true in fiction;\nand it was in an essay, \"God and Clod,\" that he had expressed his views\non the whole general subject.\n\nBut \"Adventure,\" and all that he deemed his best work, still went begging\namong the editors.  His early work counted for nothing in his eyes except\nfor the money it brought, and his horror stories, two of which he had\nsold, he did not consider high work nor his best work.  To him they were\nfrankly imaginative and fantastic, though invested with all the glamour\nof the real, wherein lay their power.  This investiture of the grotesque\nand impossible with reality, he looked upon as a trick--a skilful trick\nat best.  Great literature could not reside in such a field.  Their\nartistry was high, but he denied the worthwhileness of artistry when\ndivorced from humanness.  The trick had been to fling over the face of\nhis artistry a mask of humanness, and this he had done in the half-dozen\nor so stories of the horror brand he had written before he emerged upon\nthe high peaks of \"Adventure,\" \"Joy,\" \"The Pot,\" and \"The Wine of Life.\"\n\nThe three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out a\nprecarious existence against the arrival of the White Mouse check.  He\ncashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer, paying a\ndollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the\nbaker and the fruit store.  Martin was not yet rich enough to afford\nmeat, and he was on slim allowance when the White Mouse check arrived.  He\nwas divided on the cashing of it.  He had never been in a bank in his\nlife, much less been in one on business, and he had a naive and childlike\ndesire to walk into one of the big banks down in Oakland and fling down\nhis indorsed check for forty dollars.  On the other hand, practical\ncommon sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby\nmake an impression that would later result in an increase of credit.\nReluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer, paying his bill\nwith him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin.\nAlso, he paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his suit and his\nbicycle, paid one month's rent on the type-writer, and paid Maria the\noverdue month for his room and a month in advance.  This left him in his\npocket, for emergencies, a balance of nearly three dollars.\n\nIn itself, this small sum seemed a fortune.  Immediately on recovering\nhis clothes he had gone to see Ruth, and on the way he could not refrain\nfrom jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket.  He had been so\nlong without money that, like a rescued starving man who cannot let the\nunconsumed food out of his sight, Martin could not keep his hand off the\nsilver.  He was not mean, nor avaricious, but the money meant more than\nso many dollars and cents.  It stood for success, and the eagles stamped\nupon the coins were to him so many winged victories.\n\nIt came to him insensibly that it was a very good world.  It certainly\nappeared more beautiful to him.  For weeks it had been a very dull and\nsombre world; but now, with nearly all debts paid, three dollars jingling\nin his pocket, and in his mind the consciousness of success, the sun\nshone bright and warm, and even a rain-squall that soaked unprepared\npedestrians seemed a merry happening to him.  When he starved, his\nthoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew were starving the\nworld over; but now that he was feasted full, the fact of the thousands\nstarving was no longer pregnant in his brain.  He forgot about them, and,\nbeing in love, remembered the countless lovers in the world.  Without\ndeliberately thinking about it, motifs for love-lyrics began to agitate\nhis brain.  Swept away by the creative impulse, he got off the electric\ncar, without vexation, two blocks beyond his crossing.\n\nHe found a number of persons in the Morse home.  Ruth's two girl-cousins\nwere visiting her from San Rafael, and Mrs. Morse, under pretext of\nentertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young\npeople.  The campaign had begun during Martin's enforced absence, and was\nalready in full swing.  She was making a point of having at the house men\nwho were doing things.  Thus, in addition to the cousins Dorothy and\nFlorence, Martin encountered two university professors, one of Latin, the\nother of English; a young army officer just back from the Philippines,\none-time school-mate of Ruth's; a young fellow named Melville, private\nsecretary to Joseph Perkins, head of the San Francisco Trust Company; and\nfinally of the men, a live bank cashier, Charles Hapgood, a youngish man\nof thirty-five, graduate of Stanford University, member of the Nile Club\nand the Unity Club, and a conservative speaker for the Republican Party\nduring campaigns--in short, a rising young man in every way.  Among the\nwomen was one who painted portraits, another who was a professional\nmusician, and still another who possessed the degree of Doctor of\nSociology and who was locally famous for her social settlement work in\nthe slums of San Francisco.  But the women did not count for much in Mrs.\nMorse's plan.  At the best, they were necessary accessories.  The men who\ndid things must be drawn to the house somehow.\n\n\"Don't get excited when you talk,\" Ruth admonished Martin, before the\nordeal of introduction began.\n\nHe bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his own\nawkwardness, especially of his shoulders, which were up to their old\ntrick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments.  Also, he\nwas rendered self-conscious by the company.  He had never before been in\ncontact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them.  Melville, the\nbank cashier, fascinated him, and he resolved to investigate him at the\nfirst opportunity.  For underneath Martin's awe lurked his assertive ego,\nand he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women and to\nfind out what they had learned from the books and life which he had not\nlearned.\n\nRuth's eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on, and she\nwas surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got acquainted with\nher cousins.  He certainly did not grow excited, while being seated\nremoved from him the worry of his shoulders.  Ruth knew them for clever\ngirls, superficially brilliant, and she could scarcely understand their\npraise of Martin later that night at going to bed.  But he, on the other\nhand, a wit in his own class, a gay quizzer and laughter-maker at dances\nand Sunday picnics, had found the making of fun and the breaking of good-\nnatured lances simple enough in this environment.  And on this evening\nsuccess stood at his back, patting him on the shoulder and telling him\nthat he was making good, so that he could afford to laugh and make\nlaughter and remain unabashed.\n\nLater, Ruth's anxiety found justification.  Martin and Professor Caldwell\nhad got together in a conspicuous corner, and though Martin no longer\nwove the air with his hands, to Ruth's critical eye he permitted his own\neyes to flash and glitter too frequently, talked too rapidly and warmly,\ngrew too intense, and allowed his aroused blood to redden his cheeks too\nmuch.  He lacked decorum and control, and was in decided contrast to the\nyoung professor of English with whom he talked.\n\nBut Martin was not concerned with appearances!  He had been swift to note\nthe other's trained mind and to appreciate his command of knowledge.\nFurthermore, Professor Caldwell did not realize Martin's concept of the\naverage English professor.  Martin wanted him to talk shop, and, though\nhe seemed averse at first, succeeded in making him do it.  For Martin did\nnot see why a man should not talk shop.\n\n\"It's absurd and unfair,\" he had told Ruth weeks before, \"this objection\nto talking shop.  For what reason under the sun do men and women come\ntogether if not for the exchange of the best that is in them?  And the\nbest that is in them is what they are interested in, the thing by which\nthey make their living, the thing they've specialized on and sat up days\nand nights over, and even dreamed about.  Imagine Mr. Butler living up to\nsocial etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul Verlaine or the German\ndrama or the novels of D'Annunzio.  We'd be bored to death.  I, for one,\nif I must listen to Mr. Butler, prefer to hear him talk about his law.\nIt's the best that is in him, and life is so short that I want the best\nof every man and woman I meet.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ruth had objected, \"there are the topics of general interest to\nall.\"\n\n\"There, you mistake,\" he had rushed on.  \"All persons in society, all\ncliques in society--or, rather, nearly all persons and cliques--ape their\nbetters.  Now, who are the best betters?  The idlers, the wealthy idlers.\nThey do not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons who are\ndoing something in the world.  To listen to conversation about such\nthings would mean to be bored, wherefore the idlers decree that such\nthings are shop and must not be talked about.  Likewise they decree the\nthings that are not shop and which may be talked about, and those things\nare the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards, cocktails,\nautomobiles, horse shows, trout fishing, tuna-fishing, big-game shooting,\nyacht sailing, and so forth--and mark you, these are the things the\nidlers know.  In all truth, they constitute the shop-talk of the idlers.\nAnd the funniest part of it is that many of the clever people, and all\nthe would-be clever people, allow the idlers so to impose upon them.  As\nfor me, I want the best a man's got in him, call it shop vulgarity or\nanything you please.\"\n\nAnd Ruth had not understood.  This attack of his on the established had\nseemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion.\n\nSo Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness,\nchallenging him to speak his mind.  As Ruth paused beside them she heard\nMartin saying:-\n\n\"You surely don't pronounce such heresies in the University of\nCalifornia?\"\n\nProfessor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders.  \"The honest taxpayer and the\npolitician, you know.  Sacramento gives us our appropriations and\ntherefore we kowtow to Sacramento, and to the Board of Regents, and to\nthe party press, or to the press of both parties.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's clear; but how about you?\" Martin urged.  \"You must be a\nfish out of the water.\"\n\n\"Few like me, I imagine, in the university pond.  Sometimes I am fairly\nsure I am out of water, and that I should belong in Paris, in Grub\nStreet, in a hermit's cave, or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd,\ndrinking claret,--dago-red they call it in San Francisco,--dining in\ncheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously\nradical views upon all creation.  Really, I am frequently almost sure\nthat I was cut out to be a radical.  But then, there are so many\nquestions on which I am not sure.  I grow timid when I am face to face\nwith my human frailty, which ever prevents me from grasping all the\nfactors in any problem--human, vital problems, you know.\"\n\nAnd as he talked on, Martin became aware that to his own lips had come\nthe \"Song of the Trade Wind\":-\n\n   \"I am strongest at noon,\n   But under the moon\n   I stiffen the bunt of the sail.\"\n\nHe was almost humming the words, and it dawned upon him that the other\nreminded him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady, and cool,\nand strong.  He was equable, he was to be relied upon, and withal there\nwas a certain bafflement about him.  Martin had the feeling that he never\nspoke his full mind, just as he had often had the feeling that the trades\nnever blew their strongest but always held reserves of strength that were\nnever used.  Martin's trick of visioning was active as ever.  His brain\nwas a most accessible storehouse of remembered fact and fancy, and its\ncontents seemed ever ordered and spread for his inspection.  Whatever\noccurred in the instant present, Martin's mind immediately presented\nassociated antithesis or similitude which ordinarily expressed themselves\nto him in vision.  It was sheerly automatic, and his visioning was an\nunfailing accompaniment to the living present.  Just as Ruth's face, in a\nmomentary jealousy had called before his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale,\nand as Professor Caldwell made him see again the Northeast Trade herding\nthe white billows across the purple sea, so, from moment to moment, not\ndisconcerting but rather identifying and classifying, new memory-visions\nrose before him, or spread under his eyelids, or were thrown upon the\nscreen of his consciousness.  These visions came out of the actions and\nsensations of the past, out of things and events and books of yesterday\nand last week--a countless host of apparitions that, waking or sleeping,\nforever thronged his mind.\n\nSo it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell's easy flow of speech--the\nconversation of a clever, cultured man--that Martin kept seeing himself\ndown all his past.  He saw himself when he had been quite the hoodlum,\nwearing a \"stiff-rim\" Stetson hat and a square-cut, double-breasted coat,\nwith a certain swagger to the shoulders and possessing the ideal of being\nas tough as the police permitted.  He did not disguise it to himself, nor\nattempt to palliate it.  At one time in his life he had been just a\ncommon hoodlum, the leader of a gang that worried the police and\nterrorized honest, working-class householders.  But his ideals had\nchanged.  He glanced about him at the well-bred, well-dressed men and\nwomen, and breathed into his lungs the atmosphere of culture and\nrefinement, and at the same moment the ghost of his early youth, in stiff-\nrim and square-cut, with swagger and toughness, stalked across the room.\nThis figure, of the corner hoodlum, he saw merge into himself, sitting\nand talking with an actual university professor.\n\nFor, after all, he had never found his permanent abiding place.  He had\nfitted in wherever he found himself, been a favorite always and\neverywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his\nwillingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect.  But\nhe had never taken root.  He had fitted in sufficiently to satisfy his\nfellows but not to satisfy himself.  He had been perturbed always by a\nfeeling of unrest, had heard always the call of something from beyond,\nand had wandered on through life seeking it until he found books and art\nand love.  And here he was, in the midst of all this, the only one of all\nthe comrades he had adventured with who could have made themselves\neligible for the inside of the Morse home.\n\nBut such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following\nProfessor Caldwell closely.  And as he followed, comprehendingly and\ncritically, he noted the unbroken field of the other's knowledge.  As for\nhimself, from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps and open\nstretches, whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar.  Nevertheless,\nthanks to his Spencer, he saw that he possessed the outlines of the field\nof knowledge.  It was a matter only of time, when he would fill in the\noutline.  Then watch out, he thought--'ware shoal, everybody!  He felt\nlike sitting at the feet of the professor, worshipful and absorbent; but,\nas he listened, he began to discern a weakness in the other's judgments--a\nweakness so stray and elusive that he might not have caught it had it not\nbeen ever present.  And when he did catch it, he leapt to equality at\nonce.\n\nRuth came up to them a second time, just as Martin began to speak.\n\n\"I'll tell you where you are wrong, or, rather, what weakens your\njudgments,\" he said.  \"You lack biology.  It has no place in your scheme\nof things.--Oh, I mean the real interpretative biology, from the ground\nup, from the laboratory and the test-tube and the vitalized inorganic\nright on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations.\"\n\nRuth was appalled.  She had sat two lecture courses under Professor\nCaldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all knowledge.\n\n\"I scarcely follow you,\" he said dubiously.\n\nMartin was not so sure but what he had followed him.\n\n\"Then I'll try to explain,\" he said.  \"I remember reading in Egyptian\nhistory something to the effect that understanding could not be had of\nEgyptian art without first studying the land question.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" the professor nodded.\n\n\"And it seems to me,\" Martin continued, \"that knowledge of the land\nquestion, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot be had\nwithout previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life.  How\ncan we understand laws and institutions, religions and customs, without\nunderstanding, not merely the nature of the creatures that made them, but\nthe nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made?  Is\nliterature less human than the architecture and sculpture of Egypt?  Is\nthere one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law of\nevolution?--Oh, I know there is an elaborate evolution of the various\narts laid down, but it seems to me to be too mechanical.  The human\nhimself is left out.  The evolution of the tool, of the harp, of music\nand song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated; but how about the\nevolution of the human himself, the development of the basic and\nintrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or\ngibbered his first chant?  It is that which you do not consider, and\nwhich I call biology.  It is biology in its largest aspects.\n\n\"I know I express myself incoherently, but I've tried to hammer out the\nidea.  It came to me as you were talking, so I was not primed and ready\nto deliver it.  You spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented\none from taking all the factors into consideration.  And you, in turn,--or\nso it seems to me,--leave out the biological factor, the very stuff out\nof which has been spun the fabric of all the arts, the warp and the woof\nof all human actions and achievements.\"\n\nTo Ruth's amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, and that the\nprofessor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for\nMartin's youth.  Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute, silent and\nfingering his watch chain.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said at last, \"I've had that same criticism passed on\nme once before--by a very great man, a scientist and evolutionist, Joseph\nLe Conte.  But he is dead, and I thought to remain undetected; and now\nyou come along and expose me.  Seriously, though--and this is\nconfession--I think there is something in your contention--a great deal,\nin fact.  I am too classical, not enough up-to-date in the interpretative\nbranches of science, and I can only plead the disadvantages of my\neducation and a temperamental slothfulness that prevents me from doing\nthe work.  I wonder if you'll believe that I've never been inside a\nphysics or chemistry laboratory?  It is true, nevertheless.  Le Conte was\nright, and so are you, Mr. Eden, at least to an extent--how much I do not\nknow.\"\n\nRuth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him aside,\nwhispering:-\n\n\"You shouldn't have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way.  There may\nbe others who want to talk with him.\"\n\n\"My mistake,\" Martin admitted contritely.  \"But I'd got him stirred up,\nand he was so interesting that I did not think.  Do you know, he is the\nbrightest, the most intellectual, man I have ever talked with.  And I'll\ntell you something else.  I once thought that everybody who went to\nuniversities, or who sat in the high places in society, was just as\nbrilliant and intelligent as he.\"\n\n\"He's an exception,\" she answered.\n\n\"I should say so.  Whom do you want me to talk to now?--Oh, say, bring me\nup against that cashier-fellow.\"\n\nMartin talked for fifteen minutes with him, nor could Ruth have wished\nbetter behavior on her lover's part.  Not once did his eyes flash nor his\ncheeks flush, while the calmness and poise with which he talked surprised\nher.  But in Martin's estimation the whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a\nfew hundred per cent, and for the rest of the evening he labored under\nthe impression that bank cashiers and talkers of platitudes were\nsynonymous phrases.  The army officer he found good-natured and simple, a\nhealthy, wholesome young fellow, content to occupy the place in life into\nwhich birth and luck had flung him.  On learning that he had completed\ntwo years in the university, Martin was puzzled to know where he had\nstored it away.  Nevertheless Martin liked him better than the\nplatitudinous bank cashier.\n\n\"I really don't object to platitudes,\" he told Ruth later; \"but what\nworries me into nervousness is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior\ncertitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it.  Why,\nI could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he\ntook to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the Democrats.\nDo you know, he skins his words as a professional poker-player skins the\ncards that are dealt out to him.  Some day I'll show you what I mean.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry you don't like him,\" was her reply.  \"He's a favorite of Mr.\nButler's.  Mr. Butler says he is safe and honest--calls him the Rock,\nPeter, and says that upon him any banking institution can well be built.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it--from the little I saw of him and the less I heard from\nhim; but I don't think so much of banks as I did.  You don't mind my\nspeaking my mind this way, dear?\"\n\n\"No, no; it is most interesting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Martin went on heartily, \"I'm no more than a barbarian getting my\nfirst impressions of civilization.  Such impressions must be\nentertainingly novel to the civilized person.\"\n\n\"What did you think of my cousins?\" Ruth queried.\n\n\"I liked them better than the other women.  There's plenty of fun in them\nalong with paucity of pretence.\"\n\n\"Then you did like the other women?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"That social-settlement woman is no more than a sociological poll-parrot.\nI swear, if you winnowed her out between the stars, like Tomlinson, there\nwould be found in her not one original thought.  As for the\nportrait-painter, she was a positive bore.  She'd make a good wife for\nthe cashier.  And the musician woman!  I don't care how nimble her\nfingers are, how perfect her technique, how wonderful her expression--the\nfact is, she knows nothing about music.\"\n\n\"She plays beautifully,\" Ruth protested.\n\n\"Yes, she's undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of music, but the\nintrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her.  I asked her what music\nmeant to her--you know I'm always curious to know that particular thing;\nand she did not know what it meant to her, except that she adored it,\nthat it was the greatest of the arts, and that it meant more than life to\nher.\"\n\n\"You were making them talk shop,\" Ruth charged him.\n\n\"I confess it.  And if they were failures on shop, imagine my sufferings\nif they had discoursed on other subjects.  Why, I used to think that up\nhere, where all the advantages of culture were enjoyed--\"  He paused for\na moment, and watched the youthful shade of himself, in stiff-rim and\nsquare-cut, enter the door and swagger across the room.  \"As I was\nsaying, up here I thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant.\nBut now, from what little I've seen of them, they strike me as a pack of\nninnies, most of them, and ninety percent of the remainder as bores.  Now\nthere's Professor Caldwell--he's different.  He's a man, every inch of\nhim and every atom of his gray matter.\"\n\nRuth's face brightened.\n\n\"Tell me about him,\" she urged.  \"Not what is large and brilliant--I know\nthose qualities; but whatever you feel is adverse.  I am most curious to\nknow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'll get myself in a pickle.\"  Martin debated humorously for a\nmoment.  \"Suppose you tell me first.  Or maybe you find in him nothing\nless than the best.\"\n\n\"I attended two lecture courses under him, and I have known him for two\nyears; that is why I am anxious for your first impression.\"\n\n\"Bad impression, you mean?  Well, here goes.  He is all the fine things\nyou think about him, I guess.  At least, he is the finest specimen of\nintellectual man I have met; but he is a man with a secret shame.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" he hastened to cry.  \"Nothing paltry nor vulgar.  What I\nmean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of things,\nand is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to himself that he\nnever saw it.  Perhaps that's not the clearest way to express it.  Here's\nanother way.  A man who has found the path to the hidden temple but has\nnot followed it; who has, perhaps, caught glimpses of the temple and\nstriven afterward to convince himself that it was only a mirage of\nfoliage.  Yet another way.  A man who could have done things but who\nplaced no value on the doing, and who, all the time, in his innermost\nheart, is regretting that he has not done them; who has secretly laughed\nat the rewards for doing, and yet, still more secretly, has yearned for\nthe rewards and for the joy of doing.\"\n\n\"I don't read him that way,\" she said.  \"And for that matter, I don't see\njust what you mean.\"\n\n\"It is only a vague feeling on my part,\" Martin temporized.  \"I have no\nreason for it.  It is only a feeling, and most likely it is wrong.  You\ncertainly should know him better than I.\"\n\nFrom the evening at Ruth's Martin brought away with him strange\nconfusions and conflicting feelings.  He was disappointed in his goal, in\nthe persons he had climbed to be with.  On the other hand, he was\nencouraged with his success.  The climb had been easier than he expected.\nHe was superior to the climb, and (he did not, with false modesty, hide\nit from himself) he was superior to the beings among whom he had\nclimbed--with the exception, of course, of Professor Caldwell.  About\nlife and the books he knew more than they, and he wondered into what\nnooks and crannies they had cast aside their educations.  He did not know\nthat he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor; nor did he know\nthat the persons who were given to probing the depths and to thinking\nultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of the\nworld's Morses; nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely eagles\nsailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its swarming\nfreight of gregarious life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nBut success had lost Martin's address, and her messengers no longer came\nto his door.  For twenty-five days, working Sundays and holidays, he\ntoiled on \"The Shame of the Sun,\" a long essay of some thirty thousand\nwords.  It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the Maeterlinck\nschool--an attack from the citadel of positive science upon the wonder-\ndreamers, but an attack nevertheless that retained much of beauty and\nwonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact.  It was a little\nlater that he followed up the attack with two short essays, \"The Wonder-\nDreamers\" and \"The Yardstick of the Ego.\"  And on essays, long and short,\nhe began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine to magazine.\n\nDuring the twenty-five days spent on \"The Shame of the Sun,\" he sold hack-\nwork to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents.  A joke had brought in\nfifty cents, and a second one, sold to a high-grade comic weekly, had\nfetched a dollar.  Then two humorous poems had earned two dollars and\nthree dollars respectively.  As a result, having exhausted his credit\nwith the tradesmen (though he had increased his credit with the grocer to\nfive dollars), his wheel and suit of clothes went back to the pawnbroker.\nThe type-writer people were again clamoring for money, insistently\npointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be paid strictly\nin advance.\n\nEncouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work.\nPerhaps there was a living in it, after all.  Stored away under his table\nwere the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the newspaper short-\nstory syndicate.  He read them over in order to find out how not to write\nnewspaper storiettes, and so doing, reasoned out the perfect formula.  He\nfound that the newspaper storiette should never be tragic, should never\nend unhappily, and should never contain beauty of language, subtlety of\nthought, nor real delicacy of sentiment.  Sentiment it must contain,\nplenty of it, pure and noble, of the sort that in his own early youth had\nbrought his applause from \"nigger heaven\"--the \"For-God-my-country-and-\nthe-Czar\" and \"I-may-be-poor-but-I-am-honest\" brand of sentiment.\n\nHaving learned such precautions, Martin consulted \"The Duchess\" for tone,\nand proceeded to mix according to formula.  The formula consists of three\nparts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed or event\nthey are reunited; (3) marriage bells.  The third part was an unvarying\nquantity, but the first and second parts could be varied an infinite\nnumber of times.  Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by\nmisunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate\nparents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so\nforth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a\nsimilar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the\nother, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or\njealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some\nunguessed secret, by lover storming girl's heart, by lover making long\nand noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly.  It was very fetching to\nmake the girl propose in the course of being reunited, and Martin\ndiscovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses.  But\nmarriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties\nwith; though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell, the\nwedding bells must go on ringing just the same.  In quantity, the formula\nprescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose, fifteen hundred words\nmaximum dose.\n\nBefore he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin worked\nout half a dozen stock forms, which he always consulted when constructing\nstoriettes.  These forms were like the cunning tables used by\nmathematicians, which may be entered from top, bottom, right, and left,\nwhich entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns, and\nfrom which may be drawn, without reasoning or thinking, thousands of\ndifferent conclusions, all unchallengably precise and true.  Thus, in the\ncourse of half an hour with his forms, Martin could frame up a dozen or\nso storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at his convenience.  He\nfound that he could fill one in, after a day of serious work, in the hour\nbefore going to bed.  As he later confessed to Ruth, he could almost do\nit in his sleep.  The real work was in constructing the frames, and that\nwas merely mechanical.\n\nHe had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula, and for once he\nknew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the first\ntwo he sent off would bring checks.  And checks they brought, for four\ndollars each, at the end of twelve days.\n\nIn the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning\nthe magazines.  Though the Transcontinental had published \"The Ring of\nBells,\" no check was forthcoming.  Martin needed it, and he wrote for it.\nAn evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he received.\nHe had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply, and it was then that\nhe put his wheel back in pawn.  He wrote regularly, twice a week, to the\nTranscontinental for his five dollars, though it was only\nsemi-occasionally that he elicited a reply.  He did not know that the\nTranscontinental had been staggering along precariously for years, that\nit was a fourth-rater, or tenth-rater, without standing, with a crazy\ncirculation that partly rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic\nappealing, and with advertisements that were scarcely more than\ncharitable donations.  Nor did he know that the Transcontinental was the\nsole livelihood of the editor and the business manager, and that they\ncould wring their livelihood out of it only by moving to escape paying\nrent and by never paying any bill they could evade.  Nor could he have\nguessed that the particular five dollars that belonged to him had been\nappropriated by the business manager for the painting of his house in\nAlameda, which painting he performed himself, on week-day afternoons,\nbecause he could not afford to pay union wages and because the first scab\nhe had employed had had a ladder jerked out from under him and been sent\nto the hospital with a broken collar-bone.\n\nThe ten dollars for which Martin had sold \"Treasure Hunters\" to the\nChicago newspaper did not come to hand.  The article had been published,\nas he had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading-room, but no\nword could he get from the editor.  His letters were ignored.  To satisfy\nhimself that they had been received, he registered several of them.  It\nwas nothing less than robbery, he concluded--a cold-blooded steal; while\nhe starved, he was pilfered of his merchandise, of his goods, the sale of\nwhich was the sole way of getting bread to eat.\n\nYouth and Age was a weekly, and it had published two-thirds of his twenty-\none-thousand-word serial when it went out of business.  With it went all\nhopes of getting his sixteen dollars.\n\nTo cap the situation, \"The Pot,\" which he looked upon as one of the best\nthings he had written, was lost to him.  In despair, casting about\nfrantically among the magazines, he had sent it to The Billow, a society\nweekly in San Francisco.  His chief reason for submitting it to that\npublication was that, having only to travel across the bay from Oakland,\na quick decision could be reached.  Two weeks later he was overjoyed to\nsee, in the latest number on the news-stand, his story printed in full,\nillustrated, and in the place of honor.  He went home with leaping pulse,\nwondering how much they would pay him for one of the best things he had\ndone.  Also, the celerity with which it had been accepted and published\nwas a pleasant thought to him.  That the editor had not informed him of\nthe acceptance made the surprise more complete.  After waiting a week,\ntwo weeks, and half a week longer, desperation conquered diffidence, and\nhe wrote to the editor of The Billow, suggesting that possibly through\nsome negligence of the business manager his little account had been\noverlooked.\n\nEven if it isn't more than five dollars, Martin thought to himself, it\nwill buy enough beans and pea-soup to enable me to write half a dozen\nlike it, and possibly as good.\n\nBack came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited Martin's\nadmiration.\n\n\"We thank you,\" it ran, \"for your excellent contribution.  All of us in\nthe office enjoyed it immensely, and, as you see, it was given the place\nof honor and immediate publication.  We earnestly hope that you liked the\nillustrations.\n\n\"On rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under the\nmisapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts.  This is not our\ncustom, and of course yours was unsolicited.  We assumed, naturally, when\nwe received your story, that you understood the situation.  We can only\ndeeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding, and assure you of our\nunfailing regard.  Again, thanking you for your kind contribution, and\nhoping to receive more from you in the near future, we remain, etc.\"\n\nThere was also a postscript to the effect that though The Billow carried\nno free-list, it took great pleasure in sending him a complimentary\nsubscription for the ensuing year.\n\nAfter that experience, Martin typed at the top of the first sheet of all\nhis manuscripts: \"Submitted at your usual rate.\"\n\nSome day, he consoled himself, they will be submitted at _my_ usual rate.\n\nHe discovered in himself, at this period, a passion for perfection, under\nthe sway of which he rewrote and polished \"The Jostling Street,\" \"The\nWine of Life,\" \"Joy,\" the \"Sea Lyrics,\" and others of his earlier work.\nAs of old, nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to suit him.\nHe wrote prodigiously, and he read prodigiously, forgetting in his toil\nthe pangs caused by giving up his tobacco.  Ruth's promised cure for the\nhabit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away in the most inaccessible\ncorner of his bureau.  Especially during his stretches of famine he\nsuffered from lack of the weed; but no matter how often he mastered the\ncraving, it remained with him as strong as ever.  He regarded it as the\nbiggest thing he had ever achieved.  Ruth's point of view was that he was\ndoing no more than was right.  She brought him the anti-tobacco remedy,\npurchased out of her glove money, and in a few days forgot all about it.\n\nHis machine-made storiettes, though he hated them and derided them, were\nsuccessful.  By means of them he redeemed all his pledges, paid most of\nhis bills, and bought a new set of tires for his wheel.  The storiettes\nat least kept the pot a-boiling and gave him time for ambitious work;\nwhile the one thing that upheld him was the forty dollars he had received\nfrom The White Mouse.  He anchored his faith to that, and was confident\nthat the really first-class magazines would pay an unknown writer at\nleast an equal rate, if not a better one.  But the thing was, how to get\ninto the first-class magazines.  His best stories, essays, and poems went\nbegging among them, and yet, each month, he read reams of dull, prosy,\ninartistic stuff between all their various covers.  If only one editor,\nhe sometimes thought, would descend from his high seat of pride to write\nme one cheering line!  No matter if my work is unusual, no matter if it\nis unfit, for prudential reasons, for their pages, surely there must be\nsome sparks in it, somewhere, a few, to warm them to some sort of\nappreciation.  And thereupon he would get out one or another of his\nmanuscripts, such as \"Adventure,\" and read it over and over in a vain\nattempt to vindicate the editorial silence.\n\nAs the sweet California spring came on, his period of plenty came to an\nend.  For several weeks he had been worried by a strange silence on the\npart of the newspaper storiette syndicate.  Then, one day, came back to\nhim through the mail ten of his immaculate machine-made storiettes.  They\nwere accompanied by a brief letter to the effect that the syndicate was\noverstocked, and that some months would elapse before it would be in the\nmarket again for manuscripts.  Martin had even been extravagant on the\nstrength of those ten storiettes.  Toward the last the syndicate had\nbeen paying him five dollars each for them and accepting every one he\nsent.  So he had looked upon the ten as good as sold, and he had lived\naccordingly, on a basis of fifty dollars in the bank.  So it was that he\nentered abruptly upon a lean period, wherein he continued selling his\nearlier efforts to publications that would not pay and submitting his\nlater work to magazines that would not buy.  Also, he resumed his trips\nto the pawn-broker down in Oakland.  A few jokes and snatches of humorous\nverse, sold to the New York weeklies, made existence barely possible for\nhim.  It was at this time that he wrote letters of inquiry to the several\ngreat monthly and quarterly reviews, and learned in reply that they\nrarely considered unsolicited articles, and that most of their contents\nwere written upon order by well-known specialists who were authorities in\ntheir various fields.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nIt was a hard summer for Martin.  Manuscript readers and editors were\naway on vacation, and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in\nthree weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more.  The\nconsolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was effected by\nthe deadlock.  Only the robber-publications seemed to remain actively in\nbusiness, and to them Martin disposed of all his early efforts, such as\n\"Pearl-diving,\" \"The Sea as a Career,\" \"Turtle-catching,\" and \"The\nNortheast Trades.\"  For these manuscripts he never received a penny.  It\nis true, after six months' correspondence, he effected a compromise,\nwhereby he received a safety razor for \"Turtle-catching,\" and that The\nAcropolis, having agreed to give him five dollars cash and five yearly\nsubscriptions: for \"The Northeast Trades,\" fulfilled the second part of\nthe agreement.\n\nFor a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a Boston\neditor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste and a penny-\ndreadful purse.  \"The Peri and the Pearl,\" a clever skit of a poem of two\nhundred lines, just finished, white hot from his brain, won the heart of\nthe editor of a San Francisco magazine published in the interest of a\ngreat railroad.  When the editor wrote, offering him payment in\ntransportation, Martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was\ntransferable.  It was not, and so, being prevented from peddling it, he\nasked for the return of the poem.  Back it came, with the editor's\nregrets, and Martin sent it to San Francisco again, this time to The\nHornet, a pretentious monthly that had been fanned into a constellation\nof the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist who founded it.  But\nThe Hornet's light had begun to dim long before Martin was born.  The\neditor promised Martin fifteen dollars for the poem, but, when it was\npublished, seemed to forget about it.  Several of his letters being\nignored, Martin indicted an angry one which drew a reply.  It was written\nby a new editor, who coolly informed Martin that he declined to be held\nresponsible for the old editor's mistakes, and that he did not think much\nof \"The Peri and the Pearl\" anyway.\n\nBut The Globe, a Chicago magazine, gave Martin the most cruel treatment\nof all.  He had refrained from offering his \"Sea Lyrics\" for publication,\nuntil driven to it by starvation.  After having been rejected by a dozen\nmagazines, they had come to rest in The Globe office.  There were thirty\npoems in the collection, and he was to receive a dollar apiece for them.\nThe first month four were published, and he promptly received a cheek for\nfour dollars; but when he looked over the magazine, he was appalled at\nthe slaughter.  In some cases the titles had been altered: \"Finis,\" for\ninstance, being changed to \"The Finish,\" and \"The Song of the Outer Reef\"\nto \"The Song of the Coral Reef.\"  In one case, an absolutely different\ntitle, a misappropriate title, was substituted.  In place of his own,\n\"Medusa Lights,\" the editor had printed, \"The Backward Track.\"  But the\nslaughter in the body of the poems was terrifying.  Martin groaned and\nsweated and thrust his hands through his hair.  Phrases, lines, and\nstanzas were cut out, interchanged, or juggled about in the most\nincomprehensible manner.  Sometimes lines and stanzas not his own were\nsubstituted for his.  He could not believe that a sane editor could be\nguilty of such maltreatment, and his favorite hypothesis was that his\npoems must have been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer.\nMartin wrote immediately, begging the editor to cease publishing the\nlyrics and to return them to him.\n\nHe wrote again and again, begging, entreating, threatening, but his\nletters were ignored.  Month by month the slaughter went on till the\nthirty poems were published, and month by month he received a check for\nthose which had appeared in the current number.\n\nDespite these various misadventures, the memory of the White Mouse forty-\ndollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more to hack-\nwork.  He discovered a bread-and-butter field in the agricultural\nweeklies and trade journals, though among the religious weeklies he found\nhe could easily starve.  At his lowest ebb, when his black suit was in\npawn, he made a ten-strike--or so it seemed to him--in a prize contest\narranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party.  There were\nthree branches of the contest, and he entered them all, laughing at\nhimself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to live.\nHis poem won the first prize of ten dollars, his campaign song the second\nprize of five dollars, his essay on the principles of the Republican\nParty the first prize of twenty-five dollars.  Which was very gratifying\nto him until he tried to collect.  Something had gone wrong in the County\nCommittee, and, though a rich banker and a state senator were members of\nit, the money was not forthcoming.  While this affair was hanging fire,\nhe proved that he understood the principles of the Democratic Party by\nwinning the first prize for his essay in a similar contest.  And,\nmoreover, he received the money, twenty-five dollars.  But the forty\ndollars won in the first contest he never received.\n\nDriven to shifts in order to see Ruth, and deciding that the long walk\nfrom north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time, he\nkept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle.  The latter gave him\nexercise, saved him hours of time for work, and enabled him to see Ruth\njust the same.  A pair of knee duck trousers and an old sweater made him\na presentable wheel costume, so that he could go with Ruth on afternoon\nrides.  Besides, he no longer had opportunity to see much of her in her\nown home, where Mrs. Morse was thoroughly prosecuting her campaign of\nentertainment.  The exalted beings he met there, and to whom he had\nlooked up but a short time before, now bored him.  They were no longer\nexalted.  He was nervous and irritable, what of his hard times,\ndisappointments, and close application to work, and the conversation of\nsuch people was maddening.  He was not unduly egotistic.  He measured the\nnarrowness of their minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he\nread.  At Ruth's home he never met a large mind, with the exception of\nProfessor Caldwell, and Caldwell he had met there only once.  As for the\nrest, they were numskulls, ninnies, superficial, dogmatic, and ignorant.\nIt was their ignorance that astounded him.  What was the matter with\nthem?  What had they done with their educations?  They had had access to\nthe same books he had.  How did it happen that they had drawn nothing\nfrom them?\n\nHe knew that the great minds, the deep and rational thinkers, existed.  He\nhad his proofs from the books, the books that had educated him beyond the\nMorse standard.  And he knew that higher intellects than those of the\nMorse circle were to be found in the world.  He read English society\nnovels, wherein he caught glimpses of men and women talking politics and\nphilosophy.  And he read of salons in great cities, even in the United\nStates, where art and intellect congregated.  Foolishly, in the past, he\nhad conceived that all well-groomed persons above the working class were\npersons with power of intellect and vigor of beauty.  Culture and collars\nhad gone together, to him, and he had been deceived into believing that\ncollege educations and mastery were the same things.\n\nWell, he would fight his way on and up higher.  And he would take Ruth\nwith him.  Her he dearly loved, and he was confident that she would shine\nanywhere.  As it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by his\nearly environment, so now he perceived that she was similarly\nhandicapped.  She had not had a chance to expand.  The books on her\nfather's shelves, the paintings on the walls, the music on the piano--all\nwas just so much meretricious display.  To real literature, real\npainting, real music, the Morses and their kind, were dead.  And bigger\nthan such things was life, of which they were densely, hopelessly\nignorant.  In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their masks of\nconservative broadmindedness, they were two generations behind\ninterpretative science: their mental processes were mediaeval, while\ntheir thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe\nstruck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the\nyoungest race, as old as the cave-man, and older--the same that moved the\nfirst Pleistocene ape-man to fear the dark; that moved the first hasty\nHebrew savage to incarnate Eve from Adam's rib; that moved Descartes to\nbuild an idealistic system of the universe out of the projections of his\nown puny ego; and that moved the famous British ecclesiastic to denounce\nevolution in satire so scathing as to win immediate applause and leave\nhis name a notorious scrawl on the page of history.\n\nSo Martin thought, and he thought further, till it dawned upon him that\nthe difference between these lawyers, officers, business men, and bank\ncashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had known was\non a par with the difference in the food they ate, clothes they wore,\nneighborhoods in which they lived.  Certainly, in all of them was lacking\nthe something more which he found in himself and in the books.  The\nMorses had shown him the best their social position could produce, and he\nwas not impressed by it.  A pauper himself, a slave to the money-lender,\nhe knew himself the superior of those he met at the Morses'; and, when\nhis one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn, he moved among them a\nlord of life, quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what a prince\nwould suffer if condemned to live with goat-herds.\n\n\"You hate and fear the socialists,\" he remarked to Mr. Morse, one evening\nat dinner; \"but why?  You know neither them nor their doctrines.\"\n\nThe conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse, who had\nbeen invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood.  The cashier was\nMartin's black beast, and his temper was a trifle short where the talker\nof platitudes was concerned.\n\n\"Yes,\" he had said, \"Charley Hapgood is what they call a rising young\nman--somebody told me as much.  And it is true.  He'll make the\nGovernor's Chair before he dies, and, who knows? maybe the United States\nSenate.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" Mrs. Morse had inquired.\n\n\"I've heard him make a campaign speech.  It was so cleverly stupid and\nunoriginal, and also so convincing, that the leaders cannot help but\nregard him as safe and sure, while his platitudes are so much like the\nplatitudes of the average voter that--oh, well, you know you flatter any\nman by dressing up his own thoughts for him and presenting them to him.\"\n\n\"I actually think you are jealous of Mr. Hapgood,\" Ruth had chimed in.\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\"\n\nThe look of horror on Martin's face stirred Mrs. Morse to belligerence.\n\n\"You surely don't mean to say that Mr. Hapgood is stupid?\" she demanded\nicily.\n\n\"No more than the average Republican,\" was the retort, \"or average\nDemocrat, either.  They are all stupid when they are not crafty, and very\nfew of them are crafty.  The only wise Republicans are the millionnaires\nand their conscious henchmen.  They know which side their bread is\nbuttered on, and they know why.\"\n\n\"I am a Republican,\" Mr. Morse put in lightly.  \"Pray, how do you\nclassify me?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are an unconscious henchman.\"\n\n\"Henchman?\"\n\n\"Why, yes.  You do corporation work.  You have no working-class nor\ncriminal practice.  You don't depend upon wife-beaters and pickpockets\nfor your income.  You get your livelihood from the masters of society,\nand whoever feeds a man is that man's master.  Yes, you are a henchman.\nYou are interested in advancing the interests of the aggregations of\ncapital you serve.\"\n\nMr. Morse's face was a trifle red.\n\n\"I confess, sir,\" he said, \"that you talk like a scoundrelly socialist.\"\n\nThen it was that Martin made his remark:\n\n\"You hate and fear the socialists; but why?  You know neither them nor\ntheir doctrines.\"\n\n\"Your doctrine certainly sounds like socialism,\" Mr. Morse replied, while\nRuth gazed anxiously from one to the other, and Mrs. Morse beamed happily\nat the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lord's antagonism.\n\n\"Because I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty, equality,\nand fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,\"\nMartin said with a smile.  \"Because I question Jefferson and the\nunscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind, does not make me a\nsocialist.  Believe me, Mr. Morse, you are far nearer socialism than I\nwho am its avowed enemy.\"\n\n\"Now you please to be facetious,\" was all the other could say.\n\n\"Not at all.  I speak in all seriousness.  You still believe in equality,\nand yet you do the work of the corporations, and the corporations, from\nday to day, are busily engaged in burying equality.  And you call me a\nsocialist because I deny equality, because I affirm just what you live up\nto.  The Republicans are foes to equality, though most of them fight the\nbattle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on their\nlips.  In the name of equality they destroy equality.  That was why I\ncalled them stupid.  As for myself, I am an individualist.  I believe the\nrace is to the swift, the battle to the strong.  Such is the lesson I\nhave learned from biology, or at least think I have learned.  As I said,\nI am an individualist, and individualism is the hereditary and eternal\nfoe of socialism.\"\n\n\"But you frequent socialist meetings,\" Mr. Morse challenged.\n\n\"Certainly, just as spies frequent hostile camps.  How else are you to\nlearn about the enemy?  Besides, I enjoy myself at their meetings.  They\nare good fighters, and, right or wrong, they have read the books.  Any\none of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies than\nthe average captain of industry.  Yes, I have been to half a dozen of\ntheir meetings, but that doesn't make me a socialist any more than\nhearing Charley Hapgood orate made me a Republican.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" Mr. Morse said feebly, \"but I still believe you\nincline that way.\"\n\nBless me, Martin thought to himself, he doesn't know what I was talking\nabout.  He hasn't understood a word of it.  What did he do with his\neducation, anyway?\n\nThus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with economic\nmorality, or the morality of class; and soon it became to him a grisly\nmonster.  Personally, he was an intellectual moralist, and more offending\nto him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those about him,\nwhich was a curious hotchpotch of the economic, the metaphysical, the\nsentimental, and the imitative.\n\nA sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home.  His\nsister Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young\nmechanic, of German extraction, who, after thoroughly learning the trade,\nhad set up for himself in a bicycle-repair shop.  Also, having got the\nagency for a low-grade make of wheel, he was prosperous.  Marian had\ncalled on Martin in his room a short time before to announce her\nengagement, during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin's palm\nand told his fortune.  On her next visit she brought Hermann von Schmidt\nalong with her.  Martin did the honors and congratulated both of them in\nlanguage so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably the peasant-mind\nof his sister's lover.  This bad impression was further heightened by\nMartin's reading aloud the half-dozen stanzas of verse with which he had\ncommemorated Marian's previous visit.  It was a bit of society verse,\nairy and delicate, which he had named \"The Palmist.\"  He was surprised,\nwhen he finished reading it, to note no enjoyment in his sister's face.\nInstead, her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her betrothed, and Martin,\nfollowing her gaze, saw spread on that worthy's asymmetrical features\nnothing but black and sullen disapproval.  The incident passed over, they\nmade an early departure, and Martin forgot all about it, though for the\nmoment he had been puzzled that any woman, even of the working class,\nshould not have been flattered and delighted by having poetry written\nabout her.\n\nSeveral evenings later Marian again visited him, this time alone.  Nor\ndid she waste time in coming to the point, upbraiding him sorrowfully for\nwhat he had done.\n\n\"Why, Marian,\" he chided, \"you talk as though you were ashamed of your\nrelatives, or of your brother at any rate.\"\n\n\"And I am, too,\" she blurted out.\n\nMartin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes.\nThe mood, whatever it was, was genuine.\n\n\"But, Marian, why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing poetry\nabout my own sister?\"\n\n\"He ain't jealous,\" she sobbed.  \"He says it was indecent, ob--obscene.\"\n\nMartin emitted a long, low whistle of incredulity, then proceeded to\nresurrect and read a carbon copy of \"The Palmist.\"\n\n\"I can't see it,\" he said finally, proffering the manuscript to her.\n\"Read it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as obscene--that was\nthe word, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"He says so, and he ought to know,\" was the answer, with a wave aside of\nthe manuscript, accompanied by a look of loathing.  \"And he says you've\ngot to tear it up.  He says he won't have no wife of his with such things\nwritten about her which anybody can read.  He says it's a disgrace, an'\nhe won't stand for it.\"\n\n\"Now, look here, Marian, this is nothing but nonsense,\" Martin began;\nthen abruptly changed his mind.\n\nHe saw before him an unhappy girl, knew the futility of attempting to\nconvince her husband or her, and, though the whole situation was absurd\nand preposterous, he resolved to surrender.\n\n\"All right,\" he announced, tearing the manuscript into half a dozen\npieces and throwing it into the waste-basket.\n\nHe contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original type-\nwritten manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York magazine.\nMarian and her husband would never know, and neither himself nor they nor\nthe world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever were published.\n\nMarian, starting to reach into the waste-basket, refrained.\n\n\"Can I?\" she pleaded.\n\nHe nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn\npieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacket--ocular\nevidence of the success of her mission.  She reminded him of Lizzie\nConnolly, though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life in\nher than in that other girl of the working class whom he had seen twice.\nBut they were on a par, the pair of them, in dress and carriage, and he\nsmiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his fancy which suggested\nthe appearance of either of them in Mrs. Morse's drawing-room.  The\namusement faded, and he was aware of a great loneliness.  This sister of\nhis and the Morse drawing-room were milestones of the road he had\ntravelled.  And he had left them behind.  He glanced affectionately about\nhim at his few books.  They were all the comrades left to him.\n\n\"Hello, what's that?\" he demanded in startled surprise.\n\nMarian repeated her question.\n\n\"Why don't I go to work?\"  He broke into a laugh that was only\nhalf-hearted.  \"That Hermann of yours has been talking to you.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Don't lie,\" he commanded, and the nod of her head affirmed his charge.\n\n\"Well, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business; that when\nI write poetry about the girl he's keeping company with it's his\nbusiness, but that outside of that he's got no say so.  Understand?\n\n\"So you don't think I'll succeed as a writer, eh?\" he went on.  \"You\nthink I'm no good?--that I've fallen down and am a disgrace to the\nfamily?\"\n\n\"I think it would be much better if you got a job,\" she said firmly, and\nhe saw she was sincere.  \"Hermann says--\"\n\n\"Damn Hermann!\" he broke out good-naturedly.  \"What I want to know is\nwhen you're going to get married.  Also, you find out from your Hermann\nif he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from me.\"\n\nHe mused over the incident after she had gone, and once or twice broke\nout into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her betrothed,\nall the members of his own class and the members of Ruth's class,\ndirecting their narrow little lives by narrow little\nformulas--herd-creatures, flocking together and patterning their lives by\none another's opinions, failing of being individuals and of really living\nlife because of the childlike formulas by which they were enslaved.  He\nsummoned them before him in apparitional procession: Bernard Higginbotham\narm in arm with Mr. Butler, Hermann von Schmidt cheek by jowl with\nCharley Hapgood, and one by one and in pairs he judged them and dismissed\nthem--judged them by the standards of intellect and morality he had\nlearned from the books.  Vainly he asked: Where are the great souls, the\ngreat men and women?  He found them not among the careless, gross, and\nstupid intelligences that answered the call of vision to his narrow room.\nHe felt a loathing for them such as Circe must have felt for her swine.\nWhen he had dismissed the last one and thought himself alone, a\nlate-comer entered, unexpected and unsummoned.  Martin watched him and\nsaw the stiff-rim, the square-cut, double-breasted coat and the\nswaggering shoulders, of the youthful hoodlum who had once been he.\n\n\"You were like all the rest, young fellow,\" Martin sneered.  \"Your\nmorality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs.  You did not\nthink and act for yourself.  Your opinions, like your clothes, were ready\nmade; your acts were shaped by popular approval.  You were cock of your\ngang because others acclaimed you the real thing.  You fought and ruled\nthe gang, not because you liked to,--you know you really despised it,--but\nbecause the other fellows patted you on the shoulder.  You licked Cheese-\nFace because you wouldn't give in, and you wouldn't give in partly\nbecause you were an abysmal brute and for the rest because you believed\nwhat every one about you believed, that the measure of manhood was the\ncarnivorous ferocity displayed in injuring and marring fellow-creatures'\nanatomies.  Why, you whelp, you even won other fellows' girls away from\nthem, not because you wanted the girls, but because in the marrow of\nthose about you, those who set your moral pace, was the instinct of the\nwild stallion and the bull-seal.  Well, the years have passed, and what\ndo you think about it now?\"\n\nAs if in reply, the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis.  The stiff-\nrim and the square-cut vanished, being replaced by milder garments; the\ntoughness went out of the face, the hardness out of the eyes; and, the\nface, chastened and refined, was irradiated from an inner life of\ncommunion with beauty and knowledge.  The apparition was very like his\npresent self, and, as he regarded it, he noted the student-lamp by which\nit was illuminated, and the book over which it pored.  He glanced at the\ntitle and read, \"The Science of AEsthetics.\"  Next, he entered into the\napparition, trimmed the student-lamp, and himself went on reading \"The\nScience of AEsthetics.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nOn a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which had\nseen their love declared the year before, Martin read his \"Love-cycle\" to\nRuth.  It was in the afternoon, and, as before, they had ridden out to\ntheir favorite knoll in the hills.  Now and again she had interrupted his\nreading with exclamations of pleasure, and now, as he laid the last sheet\nof manuscript with its fellows, he waited her judgment.\n\nShe delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating to\nframe in words the harshness of her thought.\n\n\"I think they are beautiful, very beautiful,\" she said; \"but you can't\nsell them, can you?  You see what I mean,\" she said, almost pleaded.\n\"This writing of yours is not practical.  Something is the matter--maybe\nit is with the market--that prevents you from earning a living by it.  And\nplease, dear, don't misunderstand me.  I am flattered, and made proud,\nand all that--I could not be a true woman were it otherwise--that you\nshould write these poems to me.  But they do not make our marriage\npossible.  Don't you see, Martin?  Don't think me mercenary.  It is love,\nthe thought of our future, with which I am burdened.  A whole year has\ngone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding day is no\nnearer.  Don't think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding, for\nreally I have my heart, all that I am, at stake.  Why don't you try to\nget work on a newspaper, if you are so bound up in your writing?  Why not\nbecome a reporter?--for a while, at least?\"\n\n\"It would spoil my style,\" was his answer, in a low, monotonous voice.\n\"You have no idea how I've worked for style.\"\n\n\"But those storiettes,\" she argued.  \"You called them hack-work.  You\nwrote many of them.  Didn't they spoil your style?\"\n\n\"No, the cases are different.  The storiettes were ground out, jaded, at\nthe end of a long day of application to style.  But a reporter's work is\nall hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life.  And\nit is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past nor\nfuture, and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style,\nand that certainly is not literature.  To become a reporter now, just as\nmy style is taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit literary\nsuicide.  As it is, every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a\nviolation of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect for beauty.  I\ntell you it was sickening.  I was guilty of sin.  And I was secretly glad\nwhen the markets failed, even if my clothes did go into pawn.  But the\njoy of writing the 'Love-cycle'!  The creative joy in its noblest form!\nThat was compensation for everything.\"\n\nMartin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative\njoy.  She used the phrase--it was on her lips he had first heard it.  She\nhad read about it, studied about it, in the university in the course of\nearning her Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original, not creative,\nand all manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the\nharpings of others.\n\n\"May not the editor have been right in his revision of your 'Sea\nLyrics'?\" she questioned.  \"Remember, an editor must have proved\nqualifications or else he would not be an editor.\"\n\n\"That's in line with the persistence of the established,\" he rejoined,\nhis heat against the editor-folk getting the better of him.  \"What is, is\nnot only right, but is the best possible.  The existence of anything is\nsufficient vindication of its fitness to exist--to exist, mark you, as\nthe average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present\nconditions, but in all conditions.  It is their ignorance, of course,\nthat makes them believe such rot--their ignorance, which is nothing more\nnor less than the henidical mental process described by Weininger.  They\nthink they think, and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the\nlives of the few who really think.\"\n\nHe paused, overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over\nRuth's head.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know who this Weininger is,\" she retorted.  \"And you\nare so dreadfully general that I fail to follow you.  What I was speaking\nof was the qualification of editors--\"\n\n\"And I'll tell you,\" he interrupted.  \"The chief qualification of ninety-\nnine per cent of all editors is failure.  They have failed as writers.\nDon't think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their\ncirculation and to the business manager to the joy of writing.  They have\ntried to write, and they have failed.  And right there is the cursed\nparadox of it.  Every portal to success in literature is guarded by those\nwatch-dogs, the failures in literature.  The editors, sub-editors,\nassociate editors, most of them, and the manuscript-readers for the\nmagazines and book-publishers, most of them, nearly all of them, are men\nwho wanted to write and who have failed.  And yet they, of all creatures\nunder the sun the most unfit, are the very creatures who decide what\nshall and what shall not find its way into print--they, who have proved\nthemselves not original, who have demonstrated that they lack the divine\nfire, sit in judgment upon originality and genius.  And after them come\nthe reviewers, just so many more failures.  Don't tell me that they have\nnot dreamed the dream and attempted to write poetry or fiction; for they\nhave, and they have failed.  Why, the average review is more nauseating\nthan cod-liver oil.  But you know my opinion on the reviewers and the\nalleged critics.  There are great critics, but they are as rare as\ncomets.  If I fail as a writer, I shall have proved for the career of\neditorship.  There's bread and butter and jam, at any rate.\"\n\nRuth's mind was quick, and her disapproval of her lover's views was\nbuttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention.\n\n\"But, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as you have\nshown so conclusively, how is it possible that any of the great writers\never arrived?\"\n\n\"They arrived by achieving the impossible,\" he answered.  \"They did such\nblazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them.  They\narrived by course of miracle, by winning a thousand-to-one wager against\nthem.  They arrived because they were Carlyle's battle-scarred giants who\nwill not be kept down.  And that is what I must do; I must achieve the\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"But if you fail?  You must consider me as well, Martin.\"\n\n\"If I fail?\"  He regarded her for a moment as though the thought she had\nuttered was unthinkable.  Then intelligence illumined his eyes.  \"If I\nfail, I shall become an editor, and you will be an editor's wife.\"\n\nShe frowned at his facetiousness--a pretty, adorable frown that made him\nput his arm around her and kiss it away.\n\n\"There, that's enough,\" she urged, by an effort of will withdrawing\nherself from the fascination of his strength.  \"I have talked with father\nand mother.  I never before asserted myself so against them.  I demanded\nto be heard.  I was very undutiful.  They are against you, you know; but\nI assured them over and over of my abiding love for you, and at last\nfather agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his\noffice.  And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at\nthe start so that we could get married and have a little cottage\nsomewhere.  Which I think was very fine of him--don't you?\"\n\nMartin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart, mechanically reaching\nfor the tobacco and paper (which he no longer carried) to roll a\ncigarette, muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.\n\n\"Frankly, though, and don't let it hurt you--I tell you, to show you\nprecisely how you stand with him--he doesn't like your radical views, and\nhe thinks you are lazy.  Of course I know you are not.  I know you work\nhard.\"\n\nHow hard, even she did not know, was the thought in Martin's mind.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, \"how about my views?  Do you think they are so\nradical?\"\n\nHe held her eyes and waited the answer.\n\n\"I think them, well, very disconcerting,\" she replied.\n\nThe question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the\ngrayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made\nfor him to go to work.  And she, having gone as far as she dared, was\nwilling to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.\n\nShe had not long to wait.  Martin had a question of his own to propound\nto her.  He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him, and\nwithin the week each was answered.  Martin precipitated it by reading to\nher his \"The Shame of the Sun.\"\n\n\"Why don't you become a reporter?\" she asked when he had finished.  \"You\nlove writing so, and I am sure you would succeed.  You could rise in\njournalism and make a name for yourself.  There are a number of great\nspecial correspondents.  Their salaries are large, and their field is the\nworld.  They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like Stanley,\nor to interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.\"\n\n\"Then you don't like my essay?\" he rejoined.  \"You believe that I have\nsome show in journalism but none in literature?\"\n\n\"No, no; I do like it.  It reads well.  But I am afraid it's over the\nheads of your readers.  At least it is over mine.  It sounds beautiful,\nbut I don't understand it.  Your scientific slang is beyond me.  You are\nan extremist, you know, dear, and what may be intelligible to you may not\nbe intelligible to the rest of us.\"\n\n\"I imagine it's the philosophic slang that bothers you,\" was all he could\nsay.\n\nHe was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had\nexpressed, and her verdict stunned him.\n\n\"No matter how poorly it is done,\" he persisted, \"don't you see anything\nin it?--in the thought of it, I mean?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"No, it is so different from anything I have read.  I read Maeterlinck\nand understand him--\"\n\n\"His mysticism, you understand that?\" Martin flashed out.\n\n\"Yes, but this of yours, which is supposed to be an attack upon him, I\ndon't understand.  Of course, if originality counts--\"\n\nHe stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by speech.\nHe became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had been\nspeaking for some time.\n\n\"After all, your writing has been a toy to you,\" she was saying.  \"Surely\nyou have played with it long enough.  It is time to take up life\nseriously--_our_ life, Martin.  Hitherto you have lived solely your own.\"\n\n\"You want me to go to work?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.  Father has offered--\"\n\n\"I understand all that,\" he broke in; \"but what I want to know is whether\nor not you have lost faith in me?\"\n\nShe pressed his hand mutely, her eyes dim.\n\n\"In your writing, dear,\" she admitted in a half-whisper.\n\n\"You've read lots of my stuff,\" he went on brutally.  \"What do you think\nof it?  Is it utterly hopeless?  How does it compare with other men's\nwork?\"\n\n\"But they sell theirs, and you--don't.\"\n\n\"That doesn't answer my question.  Do you think that literature is not at\nall my vocation?\"\n\n\"Then I will answer.\"  She steeled herself to do it.  \"I don't think you\nwere made to write.  Forgive me, dear.  You compel me to say it; and you\nknow I know more about literature than you do.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,\" he said meditatively; \"and you ought\nto know.\"\n\n\"But there is more to be said,\" he continued, after a pause painful to\nboth.  \"I know what I have in me.  No one knows that so well as I.  I\nknow I shall succeed.  I will not be kept down.  I am afire with what I\nhave to say in verse, and fiction, and essay.  I do not ask you to have\nfaith in that, though.  I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in my\nwriting.  What I do ask of you is to love me and have faith in love.\"\n\n\"A year ago I believed for two years.  One of those years is yet to run.\nAnd I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that before that year is run\nI shall have succeeded.  You remember what you told me long ago, that I\nmust serve my apprenticeship to writing.  Well, I have served it.  I have\ncrammed it and telescoped it.  With you at the end awaiting me, I have\nnever shirked.  Do you know, I have forgotten what it is to fall\npeacefully asleep.  A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep\nmy fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep.  I am awakened\nalways now by an alarm clock.  If I fall asleep early or late, I set the\nalarm accordingly; and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my last\nconscious actions.\"\n\n\"When I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am reading for a\nlighter one.  And when I doze over that, I beat my head with my knuckles\nin order to drive sleep away.  Somewhere I read of a man who was afraid\nto sleep.  Kipling wrote the story.  This man arranged a spur so that\nwhen unconsciousness came, his naked body pressed against the iron teeth.\nWell, I've done the same.  I look at the time, and I resolve that not\nuntil midnight, or not until one o'clock, or two o'clock, or three\no'clock, shall the spur be removed.  And so it rowels me awake until the\nappointed time.  That spur has been my bed-mate for months.  I have grown\nso desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an extravagance.  I\nsleep four hours now.  I am starved for sleep.  There are times when I am\nlight-headed from want of sleep, times when death, with its rest and\nsleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am haunted by Longfellow's\nlines:\n\n   \"'The sea is still and deep;\n   All things within its bosom sleep;\n   A single step and all is o'er,\n   A plunge, a bubble, and no more.'\n\n\"Of course, this is sheer nonsense.  It comes from nervousness, from an\noverwrought mind.  But the point is: Why have I done this?  For you.  To\nshorten my apprenticeship.  To compel Success to hasten.  And my\napprenticeship is now served.  I know my equipment.  I swear that I learn\nmore each month than the average college man learns in a year.  I know\nit, I tell you.  But were my need for you to understand not so desperate\nI should not tell you.  It is not boasting.  I measure the results by the\nbooks.  Your brothers, to-day, are ignorant barbarians compared with me\nand the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were\nsleeping.  Long ago I wanted to be famous.  I care very little for fame\nnow.  What I want is you; I am more hungry for you than for food, or\nclothing, or recognition.  I have a dream of laying my head on your\nbreast and sleeping an aeon or so, and the dream will come true ere\nanother year is gone.\"\n\nHis power beat against her, wave upon wave; and in the moment his will\nopposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him.  The\nstrength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in\nhis impassioned voice, his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and\nintellect surging in him.  And in that moment, and for the moment, she\nwas aware of a rift that showed in her certitude--a rift through which\nshe caught sight of the real Martin Eden, splendid and invincible; and as\nanimal-trainers have their moments of doubt, so she, for the instant,\nseemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man.\n\n\"And another thing,\" he swept on.  \"You love me.  But why do you love me?\nThe thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that draws\nyour love.  You love me because I am somehow different from the men you\nhave known and might have loved.  I was not made for the desk and\ncounting-house, for petty business squabbling, and legal jangling.  Make\nme do such things, make me like those other men, doing the work they do,\nbreathing the air they breathe, developing the point of view they have\ndeveloped, and you have destroyed the difference, destroyed me, destroyed\nthe thing you love.  My desire to write is the most vital thing in me.\nHad I been a mere clod, neither would I have desired to write, nor would\nyou have desired me for a husband.\"\n\n\"But you forget,\" she interrupted, the quick surface of her mind\nglimpsing a parallel.  \"There have been eccentric inventors, starving\ntheir families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion.\nDoubtless their wives loved them, and suffered with them and for them,\nnot because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion.\"\n\n\"True,\" was the reply.  \"But there have been inventors who were not\neccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things;\nand sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded.  Certainly I do not seek\nany impossibilities--\"\n\n\"You have called it 'achieving the impossible,'\" she interpolated.\n\n\"I spoke figuratively.  I seek to do what men have done before me--to\nwrite and to live by my writing.\"\n\nHer silence spurred him on.\n\n\"To you, then, my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion?\" he\ndemanded.\n\nHe read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his--the pitying mother-\nhand for the hurt child.  And to her, just then, he was the hurt child,\nthe infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.\n\nToward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism of\nher father and mother.\n\n\"But you love me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do!  I do!\" she cried.\n\n\"And I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.\"  Triumph\nsounded in his voice.  \"For I have faith in your love, not fear of their\nenmity.  All things may go astray in this world, but not love.  Love\ncannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the\nway.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nMartin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway--as it\nproved, a most propitious yet disconcerting chance.  Waiting on the\ncorner for a car, she had seen him first, and noted the eager, hungry\nlines of his face and the desperate, worried look of his eyes.  In truth,\nhe was desperate and worried.  He had just come from a fruitless\ninterview with the pawnbroker, from whom he had tried to wring an\nadditional loan on his wheel.  The muddy fall weather having come on,\nMartin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained his black suit.\n\n\"There's the black suit,\" the pawnbroker, who knew his every asset, had\nanswered.  \"You needn't tell me you've gone and pledged it with that Jew,\nLipka.  Because if you have--\"\n\nThe man had looked the threat, and Martin hastened to cry:-\n\n\"No, no; I've got it.  But I want to wear it on a matter of business.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the mollified usurer had replied.  \"And I want it on a\nmatter of business before I can let you have any more money.  You don't\nthink I'm in it for my health?\"\n\n\"But it's a forty-dollar wheel, in good condition,\" Martin had argued.\n\"And you've only let me have seven dollars on it.  No, not even seven.\nSix and a quarter; you took the interest in advance.\"\n\n\"If you want some more, bring the suit,\" had been the reply that sent\nMartin out of the stuffy little den, so desperate at heart as to reflect\nit in his face and touch his sister to pity.\n\nScarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and\nstopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers.  Mrs. Higginbotham\ndivined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not\ngoing to follow her.  She turned on the step and looked down upon him.\nHis haggard face smote her to the heart again.\n\n\"Ain't you comin'?\" she asked\n\nThe next moment she had descended to his side.\n\n\"I'm walking--exercise, you know,\" he explained.\n\n\"Then I'll go along for a few blocks,\" she announced.  \"Mebbe it'll do me\ngood.  I ain't ben feelin' any too spry these last few days.\"\n\nMartin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly\nappearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders, the tired\nface with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her feet, without\nelasticity--a very caricature of the walk that belongs to a free and\nhappy body.\n\n\"You'd better stop here,\" he said, though she had already come to a halt\nat the first corner, \"and take the next car.\"\n\n\"My goodness!--if I ain't all tired a'ready!\" she panted.  \"But I'm just\nas able to walk as you in them soles.  They're that thin they'll bu'st\nlong before you git out to North Oakland.\"\n\n\"I've a better pair at home,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Come out to dinner to-morrow,\" she invited irrelevantly.  \"Mr.\nHigginbotham won't be there.  He's goin' to San Leandro on business.\"\n\nMartin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish, hungry\nlook that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.\n\n\"You haven't a penny, Mart, and that's why you're walkin'.  Exercise!\"\nShe tried to sniff contemptuously, but succeeded in producing only a\nsniffle.  \"Here, lemme see.\"\n\nAnd, fumbling in her satchel, she pressed a five-dollar piece into his\nhand.  \"I guess I forgot your last birthday, Mart,\" she mumbled lamely.\n\nMartin's hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold.  In the same\ninstant he knew he ought not to accept, and found himself struggling in\nthe throes of indecision.  That bit of gold meant food, life, and light\nin his body and brain, power to go on writing, and--who was to say?--maybe\nto write something that would bring in many pieces of gold.  Clear on his\nvision burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just completed.  He\nsaw them under the table on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for\nwhich he had no stamps, and he saw their titles, just as he had typed\nthem--\"The High Priests of Mystery,\" and \"The Cradle of Beauty.\"  He had\nnever submitted them anywhere.  They were as good as anything he had done\nin that line.  If only he had stamps for them!  Then the certitude of his\nultimate success rose up in him, an able ally of hunger, and with a quick\nmovement he slipped the coin into his pocket.\n\n\"I'll pay you back, Gertrude, a hundred times over,\" he gulped out, his\nthroat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of moisture.\n\n\"Mark my words!\" he cried with abrupt positiveness.  \"Before the year is\nout I'll put an even hundred of those little yellow-boys into your hand.\nI don't ask you to believe me.  All you have to do is wait and see.\"\n\nNor did she believe.  Her incredulity made her uncomfortable, and failing\nof other expedient, she said:-\n\n\"I know you're hungry, Mart.  It's sticking out all over you.  Come in to\nmeals any time.  I'll send one of the children to tell you when Mr.\nHigginbotham ain't to be there.  An' Mart--\"\n\nHe waited, though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to say,\nso visible was her thought process to him.\n\n\"Don't you think it's about time you got a job?\"\n\n\"You don't think I'll win out?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Nobody has faith in me, Gertrude, except myself.\"  His voice was\npassionately rebellious.  \"I've done good work already, plenty of it, and\nsooner or later it will sell.\"\n\n\"How do you know it is good?\"\n\n\"Because--\"  He faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the\nhistory of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of\nhis attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith.  \"Well,\nbecause it's better than ninety-nine per cent of what is published in the\nmagazines.\"\n\n\"I wish't you'd listen to reason,\" she answered feebly, but with\nunwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was ailing\nhim.  \"I wish't you'd listen to reason,\" she repeated, \"an' come to\ndinner to-morrow.\"\n\nAfter Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post-office and\ninvested three of the five dollars in stamps; and when, later in the day,\non the way to the Morse home, he stopped in at the post-office to weigh a\nlarge number of long, bulky envelopes, he affixed to them all the stamps\nsave three of the two-cent denomination.\n\nIt proved a momentous night for Martin, for after dinner he met Russ\nBrissenden.  How he chanced to come there, whose friend he was or what\nacquaintance brought him, Martin did not know.  Nor had he the curiosity\nto inquire about him of Ruth.  In short, Brissenden struck Martin as\nanaemic and feather-brained, and was promptly dismissed from his mind.  An\nhour later he decided that Brissenden was a boor as well, what of the way\nhe prowled about from one room to another, staring at the pictures or\npoking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from the table or\ndrew from the shelves.  Though a stranger in the house he finally\nisolated himself in the midst of the company, huddling into a capacious\nMorris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had drawn from\nhis pocket.  As he read, he abstractedly ran his fingers, with a\ncaressing movement, through his hair.  Martin noticed him no more that\nevening, except once when he observed him chaffing with great apparent\nsuccess with several of the young women.\n\nIt chanced that when Martin was leaving, he overtook Brissenden already\nhalf down the walk to the street.\n\n\"Hello, is that you?\" Martin said.\n\nThe other replied with an ungracious grunt, but swung alongside.  Martin\nmade no further attempt at conversation, and for several blocks unbroken\nsilence lay upon them.\n\n\"Pompous old ass!\"\n\nThe suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin.  He\nfelt amused, and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for the\nother.\n\n\"What do you go to such a place for?\" was abruptly flung at him after\nanother block of silence.\n\n\"Why do you?\" Martin countered.\n\n\"Bless me, I don't know,\" came back.  \"At least this is my first\nindiscretion.  There are twenty-four hours in each day, and I must spend\nthem somehow.  Come and have a drink.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Martin answered.\n\nThe next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance.  At\nhome was several hours' hack-work waiting for him before he went to bed,\nand after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting for him,\nto say nothing of Herbert Spencer's Autobiography, which was as replete\nfor him with romance as any thrilling novel.  Why should he waste any\ntime with this man he did not like? was his thought.  And yet, it was not\nso much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated with the\ndrink--the bright lights, the mirrors and dazzling array of glasses, the\nwarm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices of men.  That\nwas it, it was the voices of men, optimistic men, men who breathed\nsuccess and spent their money for drinks like men.  He was lonely, that\nwas what was the matter with him; that was why he had snapped at the\ninvitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook.  Not since with\nJoe, at Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of the wine he took\nwith the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at a public bar.\nMental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical\nexhaustion did, and he had felt no need for it.  But just now he felt\ndesire for the drink, or, rather, for the atmosphere wherein drinks were\ndispensed and disposed of.  Such a place was the Grotto, where Brissenden\nand he lounged in capacious leather chairs and drank Scotch and soda.\n\nThey talked.  They talked about many things, and now Brissenden and now\nMartin took turn in ordering Scotch and soda.  Martin, who was extremely\nstrong-headed, marvelled at the other's capacity for liquor, and ever and\nanon broke off to marvel at the other's conversation.  He was not long in\nassuming that Brissenden knew everything, and in deciding that here was\nthe second intellectual man he had met.  But he noted that Brissenden had\nwhat Professor Caldwell lacked--namely, fire, the flashing insight and\nperception, the flaming uncontrol of genius.  Living language flowed from\nhim.  His thin lips, like the dies of a machine, stamped out phrases that\ncut and stung; or again, pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound\nthey articulated, the thin lips shaped soft and velvety things, mellow\nphrases of glow and glory, of haunting beauty, reverberant of the mystery\nand inscrutableness of life; and yet again the thin lips were like a\nbugle, from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic strife, phrases\nthat sounded clear as silver, that were luminous as starry spaces, that\nepitomized the final word of science and yet said something more--the\npoet's word, the transcendental truth, elusive and without words which\ncould express, and which none the less found expression in the subtle and\nall but ungraspable connotations of common words.  He, by some wonder of\nvision, saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism, where was no\nlanguage for narration, and yet, by some golden miracle of speech,\ninvesting known words with unknown significances, he conveyed to Martin's\nconsciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls.\n\nMartin forgot his first impression of dislike.  Here was the best the\nbooks had to offer coming true.  Here was an intelligence, a living man\nfor him to look up to.  \"I am down in the dirt at your feet,\" Martin\nrepeated to himself again and again.\n\n\"You've studied biology,\" he said aloud, in significant allusion.\n\nTo his surprise Brissenden shook his head.\n\n\"But you are stating truths that are substantiated only by biology,\"\nMartin insisted, and was rewarded by a blank stare.  \"Your conclusions\nare in line with the books which you must have read.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" was the answer.  \"That my smattering of knowledge\nshould enable me to short-cut my way to truth is most reassuring.  As for\nmyself, I never bother to find out if I am right or not.  It is all\nvalueless anyway.  Man can never know the ultimate verities.\"\n\n\"You are a disciple of Spencer!\" Martin cried triumphantly.\n\n\"I haven't read him since adolescence, and all I read then was his\n'Education.'\"\n\n\"I wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly,\" Martin broke out half an\nhour later.  He had been closely analyzing Brissenden's mental equipment.\n\"You are a sheer dogmatist, and that's what makes it so marvellous.  You\nstate dogmatically the latest facts which science has been able to\nestablish only by a posteriori reasoning.  You jump at correct\nconclusions.  You certainly short-cut with a vengeance.  You feel your\nway with the speed of light, by some hyperrational process, to truth.\"\n\n\"Yes, that was what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother Dutton,\"\nBrissenden replied.  \"Oh, no,\" he added; \"I am not anything.  It was a\nlucky trick of fate that sent me to a Catholic college for my education.\nWhere did you pick up what you know?\"\n\nAnd while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging from\na long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat on\na neighboring chair, its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage of\nmany books.  Brissenden's face and long, slender hands were browned by\nthe sun--excessively browned, Martin thought.  This sunburn bothered\nMartin.  It was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor man.  Then how had\nhe been ravaged by the sun?  Something morbid and significant attached to\nthat sunburn, was Martin's thought as he returned to a study of the face,\nnarrow, with high cheek-bones and cavernous hollows, and graced with as\ndelicate and fine an aquiline nose as Martin had ever seen.  There was\nnothing remarkable about the size of the eyes.  They were neither large\nnor small, while their color was a nondescript brown; but in them\nsmouldered a fire, or, rather, lurked an expression dual and strangely\ncontradictory.  Defiant, indomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the\nsame time aroused pity.  Martin found himself pitying him he knew not\nwhy, though he was soon to learn.\n\n\"Oh, I'm a lunger,\" Brissenden announced, offhand, a little later, having\nalready stated that he came from Arizona.  \"I've been down there a couple\nof years living on the climate.\"\n\n\"Aren't you afraid to venture it up in this climate?\"\n\n\"Afraid?\"\n\nThere was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin's word.  But\nMartin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was nothing\nof which it was afraid.  The eyes had narrowed till they were eagle-like,\nand Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle beak with its\ndilated nostrils, defiant, assertive, aggressive.  Magnificent, was what\nhe commented to himself, his blood thrilling at the sight.  Aloud, he\nquoted:-\n\n   \"'Under the bludgeoning of Chance\n   My head is bloody but unbowed.'\"\n\n\"You like Henley,\" Brissenden said, his expression changing swiftly to\nlarge graciousness and tenderness.  \"Of course, I couldn't have expected\nanything else of you.  Ah, Henley!  A brave soul.  He stands out among\ncontemporary rhymesters--magazine rhymesters--as a gladiator stands out\nin the midst of a band of eunuchs.\"\n\n\"You don't like the magazines,\" Martin softly impeached.\n\n\"Do you?\" was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him.\n\n\"I--I write, or, rather, try to write, for the magazines,\" Martin\nfaltered.\n\n\"That's better,\" was the mollified rejoinder.  \"You try to write, but you\ndon't succeed.  I respect and admire your failure.  I know what you\nwrite.  I can see it with half an eye, and there's one ingredient in it\nthat shuts it out of the magazines.  It's guts, and magazines have no use\nfor that particular commodity.  What they want is wish-wash and slush,\nand God knows they get it, but not from you.\"\n\n\"I'm not above hack-work,\" Martin contended.\n\n\"On the contrary--\"  Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over\nMartin's objective poverty, passing from the well-worn tie and the saw-\nedged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight fray\nof one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin's sunken cheeks.  \"On\nthe contrary, hack-work is above you, so far above you that you can never\nhope to rise to it.  Why, man, I could insult you by asking you to have\nsomething to eat.\"\n\nMartin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood, and Brissenden\nlaughed triumphantly.\n\n\"A full man is not insulted by such an invitation,\" he concluded.\n\n\"You are a devil,\" Martin cried irritably.\n\n\"Anyway, I didn't ask you.\"\n\n\"You didn't dare.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that.  I invite you now.\"\n\nBrissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke, as if with the intention\nof departing to the restaurant forthwith.\n\nMartin's fists were tight-clenched, and his blood was drumming in his\ntemples.\n\n\"Bosco!  He eats 'em alive!  Eats 'em alive!\"  Brissenden exclaimed,\nimitating the spieler of a locally famous snake-eater.\n\n\"I could certainly eat you alive,\" Martin said, in turn running insolent\neyes over the other's disease-ravaged frame.\n\n\"Only I'm not worthy of it?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" Martin considered, \"because the incident is not\nworthy.\"  He broke into a laugh, hearty and wholesome.  \"I confess you\nmade a fool of me, Brissenden.  That I am hungry and you are aware of it\nare only ordinary phenomena, and there's no disgrace.  You see, I laugh\nat the conventional little moralities of the herd; then you drift by, say\na sharp, true word, and immediately I am the slave of the same little\nmoralities.\"\n\n\"You were insulted,\" Brissenden affirmed.\n\n\"I certainly was, a moment ago.  The prejudice of early youth, you know.\nI learned such things then, and they cheapen what I have since learned.\nThey are the skeletons in my particular closet.\"\n\n\"But you've got the door shut on them now?\"\n\n\"I certainly have.\"\n\n\"Sure?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Then let's go and get something to eat.\"\n\n\"I'll go you,\" Martin answered, attempting to pay for the current Scotch\nand soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing the waiter\nbullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the table.\n\nMartin pocketed it with a grimace, and felt for a moment the kindly\nweight of Brissenden's hand upon his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nPromptly, the next afternoon, Maria was excited by Martin's second\nvisitor.  But she did not lose her head this time, for she seated\nBrissenden in her parlor's grandeur of respectability.\n\n\"Hope you don't mind my coming?\" Brissenden began.\n\n\"No, no, not at all,\" Martin answered, shaking hands and waving him to\nthe solitary chair, himself taking to the bed.  \"But how did you know\nwhere I lived?\"\n\n\"Called up the Morses.  Miss Morse answered the 'phone.  And here I am.\"\nHe tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table.\n\"There's a book, by a poet.  Read it and keep it.\"  And then, in reply to\nMartin's protest: \"What have I to do with books?  I had another\nhemorrhage this morning.  Got any whiskey?  No, of course not.  Wait a\nminute.\"\n\nHe was off and away.  Martin watched his long figure go down the outside\nsteps, and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang the\nshoulders, which had once been broad, drawn in now over, the collapsed\nruin of the chest.  Martin got two tumblers, and fell to reading the book\nof verse, Henry Vaughn Marlow's latest collection.\n\n\"No Scotch,\" Brissenden announced on his return.  \"The beggar sells\nnothing but American whiskey.  But here's a quart of it.\"\n\n\"I'll send one of the youngsters for lemons, and we'll make a toddy,\"\nMartin offered.\n\n\"I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?\" he went on, holding up\nthe volume in question.\n\n\"Possibly fifty dollars,\" came the answer.  \"Though he's lucky if he\npulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it\nout.\"\n\n\"Then one can't make a living out of poetry?\"\n\nMartin's tone and face alike showed his dejection.\n\n\"Certainly not.  What fool expects to?  Out of rhyming, yes.  There's\nBruce, and Virginia Spring, and Sedgwick.  They do very nicely.  But\npoetry--do you know how Vaughn Marlow makes his living?--teaching in a\nboys' cramming-joint down in Pennsylvania, and of all private little\nhells such a billet is the limit.  I wouldn't trade places with him if he\nhad fifty years of life before him.  And yet his work stands out from the\nruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots.  And\nthe reviews he gets!  Damn them, all of them, the crass manikins!\"\n\n\"Too much is written by the men who can't write about the men who do\nwrite,\" Martin concurred.  \"Why, I was appalled at the quantities of\nrubbish written about Stevenson and his work.\"\n\n\"Ghouls and harpies!\" Brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth.  \"Yes,\nI know the spawn--complacently pecking at him for his Father Damien\nletter, analyzing him, weighing him--\"\n\n\"Measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos,\" Martin\nbroke in.\n\n\"Yes, that's it, a good phrase,--mouthing and besliming the True, and\nBeautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back and saying,\n'Good dog, Fido.'  Faugh!  'The little chattering daws of men,' Richard\nRealf called them the night he died.\"\n\n\"Pecking at star-dust,\" Martin took up the strain warmly; \"at the\nmeteoric flight of the master-men.  I once wrote a squib on them--the\ncritics, or the reviewers, rather.\"\n\n\"Let's see it,\" Brissenden begged eagerly.\n\nSo Martin unearthed a carbon copy of \"Star-dust,\" and during the reading\nof it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to sip his toddy.\n\n\"Strikes me you're a bit of star-dust yourself, flung into a world of\ncowled gnomes who cannot see,\" was his comment at the end of it.  \"Of\ncourse it was snapped up by the first magazine?\"\n\nMartin ran over the pages of his manuscript book.  \"It has been refused\nby twenty-seven of them.\"\n\nBrissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh, but broke down in a fit of\ncoughing.\n\n\"Say, you needn't tell me you haven't tackled poetry,\" he gasped.  \"Let\nme see some of it.\"\n\n\"Don't read it now,\" Martin pleaded.  \"I want to talk with you.  I'll\nmake up a bundle and you can take it home.\"\n\nBrissenden departed with the \"Love-cycle,\" and \"The Peri and the Pearl,\"\nreturning next day to greet Martin with:-\n\n\"I want more.\"\n\nNot only did he assure Martin that he was a poet, but Martin learned that\nBrissenden also was one.  He was swept off his feet by the other's work,\nand astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it.\n\n\"A plague on all their houses!\" was Brissenden's answer to Martin's\nvolunteering to market his work for him.  \"Love Beauty for its own sake,\"\nwas his counsel, \"and leave the magazines alone.  Back to your ships and\nyour sea--that's my advice to you, Martin Eden.  What do you want in\nthese sick and rotten cities of men?  You are cutting your throat every\nday you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the needs of\nmagazinedom.  What was it you quoted me the other day?--Oh, yes, 'Man,\nthe latest of the ephemera.'  Well, what do you, the latest of the\nephemera, want with fame?  If you got it, it would be poison to you.  You\nare too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by my faith, to prosper\non such pap.  I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines.  Beauty\nis the only master to serve.  Serve her and damn the multitude!  Success!\nWhat in hell's success if it isn't right there in your Stevenson sonnet,\nwhich outranks Henley's 'Apparition,' in that 'Love-cycle,' in those sea-\npoems?\n\n\"It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy, but in the\ndoing of it.  You can't tell me.  I know it.  You know it.  Beauty hurts\nyou.  It is an everlasting pain in you, a wound that does not heal, a\nknife of flame.  Why should you palter with magazines?  Let beauty be\nyour end.  Why should you mint beauty into gold?  Anyway, you can't; so\nthere's no use in my getting excited over it.  You can read the magazines\nfor a thousand years and you won't find the value of one line of Keats.\nLeave fame and coin alone, sign away on a ship to-morrow, and go back to\nyour sea.\"\n\n\"Not for fame, but for love,\" Martin laughed.  \"Love seems to have no\nplace in your Cosmos; in mine, Beauty is the handmaiden of Love.\"\n\nBrissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly.  \"You are so young,\nMartin boy, so young.  You will flutter high, but your wings are of the\nfinest gauze, dusted with the fairest pigments.  Do not scorch them.  But\nof course you have scorched them already.  It required some glorified\npetticoat to account for that 'Love-cycle,' and that's the shame of it.\"\n\n\"It glorifies love as well as the petticoat,\" Martin laughed.\n\n\"The philosophy of madness,\" was the retort.  \"So have I assured myself\nwhen wandering in hasheesh dreams.  But beware.  These bourgeois cities\nwill kill you.  Look at that den of traitors where I met you.  Dry rot is\nno name for it.  One can't keep his sanity in such an atmosphere.  It's\ndegrading.  There's not one of them who is not degrading, man and woman,\nall of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and\nartistic impulses of clams--\"\n\nHe broke off suddenly and regarded Martin.  Then, with a flash of\ndivination, he saw the situation.  The expression on his face turned to\nwondering horror.\n\n\"And you wrote that tremendous 'Love-cycle' to her--that pale,\nshrivelled, female thing!\"\n\nThe next instant Martin's right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on\nhis throat, and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled.  But Martin,\nlooking into his eyes, saw no fear there,--naught but a curious and\nmocking devil.  Martin remembered himself, and flung Brissenden, by the\nneck, sidelong upon the bed, at the same moment releasing his hold.\n\nBrissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment, then began to\nchuckle.\n\n\"You had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the flame,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"My nerves are on a hair-trigger these days,\" Martin apologized.  \"Hope I\ndidn't hurt you.  Here, let me mix a fresh toddy.\"\n\n\"Ah, you young Greek!\" Brissenden went on.  \"I wonder if you take just\npride in that body of yours.  You are devilish strong.  You are a young\npanther, a lion cub.  Well, well, it is you who must pay for that\nstrength.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Martin asked curiously, passing aim a glass.  \"Here,\ndown this and be good.\"\n\n\"Because--\" Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled appreciation of it.\n\"Because of the women.  They will worry you until you die, as they have\nalready worried you, or else I was born yesterday.  Now there's no use in\nyour choking me; I'm going to have my say.  This is undoubtedly your calf\nlove; but for Beauty's sake show better taste next time.  What under\nheaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie?  Leave them alone.\nPick out some great, wanton flame of a woman, who laughs at life and\njeers at death and loves one while she may.  There are such women, and\nthey will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of\nbourgeois sheltered life.\"\n\n\"Pusillanimous?\" Martin protested.\n\n\"Just so, pusillanimous; prattling out little moralities that have been\nprattled into them, and afraid to live life.  They will love you, Martin,\nbut they will love their little moralities more.  What you want is the\nmagnificent abandon of life, the great free souls, the blazing\nbutterflies and not the little gray moths.  Oh, you will grow tired of\nthem, too, of all the female things, if you are unlucky enough to live.\nBut you won't live.  You won't go back to your ships and sea; therefore,\nyou'll hang around these pest-holes of cities until your bones are\nrotten, and then you'll die.\"\n\n\"You can lecture me, but you can't make me talk back,\" Martin said.\n\"After all, you have but the wisdom of your temperament, and the wisdom\nof my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours.\"\n\nThey disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but they\nliked each other, and on Martin's part it was no less than a profound\nliking.  Day after day they were together, if for no more than the hour\nBrissenden spent in Martin's stuffy room.  Brissenden never arrived\nwithout his quart of whiskey, and when they dined together down-town, he\ndrank Scotch and soda throughout the meal.  He invariably paid the way\nfor both, and it was through him that Martin learned the refinements of\nfood, drank his first champagne, and made acquaintance with Rhenish\nwines.\n\nBut Brissenden was always an enigma.  With the face of an ascetic, he\nwas, in all the failing blood of him, a frank voluptuary.  He was\nunafraid to die, bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and yet,\ndying, he loved life, to the last atom of it.  He was possessed by a\nmadness to live, to thrill, \"to squirm my little space in the cosmic dust\nwhence I came,\" as he phrased it once himself.  He had tampered with\ndrugs and done many strange things in quest of new thrills, new\nsensations.  As he told Martin, he had once gone three days without\nwater, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience the exquisite\ndelight of such a thirst assuaged.  Who or what he was, Martin never\nlearned.  He was a man without a past, whose future was the imminent\ngrave and whose present was a bitter fever of living.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nMartin was steadily losing his battle.  Economize as he would, the\nearnings from hack-work did not balance expenses.  Thanksgiving found him\nwith his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the Morses' invitation\nto dinner.  Ruth was not made happy by his reason for not coming, and the\ncorresponding effect on him was one of desperation.  He told her that he\nwould come, after all; that he would go over to San Francisco, to the\nTranscontinental office, collect the five dollars due him, and with it\nredeem his suit of clothes.\n\nIn the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria.  He would have borrowed\nit, by preference, from Brissenden, but that erratic individual had\ndisappeared.  Two weeks had passed since Martin had seen him, and he\nvainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence.  The ten cents\ncarried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco, and as he walked up\nMarket Street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to\ncollect the money.  There would then be no way for him to return to\nOakland, and he knew no one in San Francisco from whom to borrow another\nten cents.\n\nThe door to the Transcontinental office was ajar, and Martin, in the act\nof opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from within,\nwhich exclaimed:- \"But that is not the question, Mr. Ford.\"  (Ford,\nMartin knew, from his correspondence, to be the editor's name.)  \"The\nquestion is, are you prepared to pay?--cash, and cash down, I mean?  I am\nnot interested in the prospects of the Transcontinental and what you\nexpect to make it next year.  What I want is to be paid for what I do.\nAnd I tell you, right now, the Christmas Transcontinental don't go to\npress till I have the money in my hand.  Good day.  When you get the\nmoney, come and see me.\"\n\nThe door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry\ncountenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching\nhis fists.  Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered in the\nhallways for a quarter of an hour.  Then he shoved the door open and\nwalked in.  It was a new experience, the first time he had been inside an\neditorial office.  Cards evidently were not necessary in that office, for\nthe boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to\nsee Mr. Ford.  Returning, the boy beckoned him from halfway across the\nroom and led him to the private office, the editorial sanctum.  Martin's\nfirst impression was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of the room.\nNext he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking man, sitting at a roll-\ntop desk, who regarded him curiously.  Martin marvelled at the calm\nrepose of his face.  It was evident that the squabble with the printer\nhad not affected his equanimity.\n\n\"I--I am Martin Eden,\" Martin began the conversation.  (\"And I want my\nfive dollars,\" was what he would have liked to say.)\n\nBut this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did not\ndesire to scare him too abruptly.  To his surprise, Mr. Ford leaped into\nthe air with a \"You don't say so!\" and the next moment, with both hands,\nwas shaking Martin's hand effusively.\n\n\"Can't say how glad I am to see you, Mr. Eden.  Often wondered what you\nwere like.\"\n\nHere he held Martin off at arm's length and ran his beaming eyes over\nMartin's second-best suit, which was also his worst suit, and which was\nragged and past repair, though the trousers showed the careful crease he\nhad put in with Maria's flat-irons.\n\n\"I confess, though, I conceived you to be a much older man than you are.\nYour story, you know, showed such breadth, and vigor, such maturity and\ndepth of thought.  A masterpiece, that story--I knew it when I had read\nthe first half-dozen lines.  Let me tell you how I first read it.  But\nno; first let me introduce you to the staff.\"\n\nStill talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he\nintroduced him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail\nlittle man whose hand seemed strangely cold, as if he were suffering from\na chill, and whose whiskers were sparse and silky.\n\n\"And Mr. Ends, Mr. Eden.  Mr. Ends is our business manager, you know.\"\n\nMartin found himself shaking hands with a cranky-eyed, bald-headed man,\nwhose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it,\nfor most of it was covered by a snow-white beard, carefully trimmed--by\nhis wife, who did it on Sundays, at which times she also shaved the back\nof his neck.\n\nThe three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once,\nuntil it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.\n\n\"We often wondered why you didn't call,\" Mr. White was saying.\n\n\"I didn't have the carfare, and I live across the Bay,\" Martin answered\nbluntly, with the idea of showing them his imperative need for the money.\n\nSurely, he thought to himself, my glad rags in themselves are eloquent\nadvertisement of my need.  Time and again, whenever opportunity offered,\nhe hinted about the purpose of his business.  But his admirers' ears were\ndeaf.  They sang his praises, told him what they had thought of his story\nat first sight, what they subsequently thought, what their wives and\nfamilies thought; but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay\nhim for it.\n\n\"Did I tell you how I first read your story?\" Mr. Ford said.  \"Of course\nI didn't.  I was coming west from New York, and when the train stopped at\nOgden, the train-boy on the new run brought aboard the current number of\nthe Transcontinental.\"\n\nMy God! Martin thought; you can travel in a Pullman while I starve for\nthe paltry five dollars you owe me.  A wave of anger rushed over him.  The\nwrong done him by the Transcontinental loomed colossal, for strong upon\nhim were all the dreary months of vain yearning, of hunger and privation,\nand his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him, reminding him that he had\neaten nothing since the day before, and little enough then.  For the\nmoment he saw red.  These creatures were not even robbers.  They were\nsneak-thieves.  By lies and broken promises they had tricked him out of\nhis story.  Well, he would show them.  And a great resolve surged into\nhis will to the effect that he would not leave the office until he got\nhis money.  He remembered, if he did not get it, that there was no way\nfor him to go back to Oakland.  He controlled himself with an effort, but\nnot before the wolfish expression of his face had awed and perturbed\nthem.\n\nThey became more voluble than ever.  Mr. Ford started anew to tell how he\nhad first read \"The Ring of Bells,\" and Mr. Ends at the same time was\nstriving to repeat his niece's appreciation of \"The Ring of Bells,\" said\nniece being a school-teacher in Alameda.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I came for,\" Martin said finally.  \"To be paid for\nthat story all of you like so well.  Five dollars, I believe, is what you\npromised me would be paid on publication.\"\n\nMr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and happy\nacquiescence, started to reach for his pocket, then turned suddenly to\nMr. Ends, and said that he had left his money home.  That Mr. Ends\nresented this, was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his arm as if to\nprotect his trousers pocket.  Martin knew that the money was there.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Mr. Ends, \"but I paid the printer not an hour ago, and\nhe took my ready change.  It was careless of me to be so short; but the\nbill was not yet due, and the printer's request, as a favor, to make an\nimmediate advance, was quite unexpected.\"\n\nBoth men looked expectantly at Mr. White, but that gentleman laughed and\nshrugged his shoulders.  His conscience was clean at any rate.  He had\ncome into the Transcontinental to learn magazine-literature, instead of\nwhich he had principally learned finance.  The Transcontinental owed him\nfour months' salary, and he knew that the printer must be appeased before\nthe associate editor.\n\n\"It's rather absurd, Mr. Eden, to have caught us in this shape,\" Mr. Ford\npreambled airily.  \"All carelessness, I assure you.  But I'll tell you\nwhat we'll do.  We'll mail you a check the first thing in the morning.\nYou have Mr. Eden's address, haven't you, Mr. Ends?\"\n\nYes, Mr. Ends had the address, and the check would be mailed the first\nthing in the morning.  Martin's knowledge of banks and checks was hazy,\nbut he could see no reason why they should not give him the check on this\nday just as well as on the next.\n\n\"Then it is understood, Mr. Eden, that we'll mail you the check\nto-morrow?\" Mr. Ford said.\n\n\"I need the money to-day,\" Martin answered stolidly.\n\n\"The unfortunate circumstances--if you had chanced here any other day,\"\nMr. Ford began suavely, only to be interrupted by Mr. Ends, whose cranky\neyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper.\n\n\"Mr. Ford has already explained the situation,\" he said with asperity.\n\"And so have I.  The check will be mailed--\"\n\n\"I also have explained,\" Martin broke in, \"and I have explained that I\nwant the money to-day.\"\n\nHe had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager's\nbrusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye, for it was in that\ngentleman's trousers pocket that he divined the Transcontinental's ready\ncash was reposing.\n\n\"It is too bad--\" Mr. Ford began.\n\nBut at that moment, with an impatient movement, Mr. Ends turned as if\nabout to leave the room.  At the same instant Martin sprang for him,\nclutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that Mr. Ends'\nsnow-white beard, still maintaining its immaculate trimness, pointed\nceilingward at an angle of forty-five degrees.  To the horror of Mr.\nWhite and Mr. Ford, they saw their business manager shaken like an\nAstrakhan rug.\n\n\"Dig up, you venerable discourager of rising young talent!\" Martin\nexhorted.  \"Dig up, or I'll shake it out of you, even if it's all in\nnickels.\"  Then, to the two affrighted onlookers: \"Keep away!  If you\ninterfere, somebody's liable to get hurt.\"\n\nMr. Ends was choking, and it was not until the grip on his throat was\neased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging-up\nprogramme.  All together, after repeated digs, its trousers pocket\nyielded four dollars and fifteen cents.\n\n\"Inside out with it,\" Martin commanded.\n\nAn additional ten cents fell out.  Martin counted the result of his raid\na second time to make sure.\n\n\"You next!\" he shouted at Mr. Ford.  \"I want seventy-five cents more.\"\n\nMr. Ford did not wait, but ransacked his pockets, with the result of\nsixty cents.\n\n\"Sure that is all?\" Martin demanded menacingly, possessing himself of it.\n\"What have you got in your vest pockets?\"\n\nIn token of his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside\nout.  A strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them.  He\nrecovered it and was in the act of returning it, when Martin cried:-\n\n\"What's that?--A ferry ticket?  Here, give it to me.  It's worth ten\ncents.  I'll credit you with it.  I've now got four dollars and ninety-\nfive cents, including the ticket.  Five cents is still due me.\"\n\nHe looked fiercely at Mr. White, and found that fragile creature in the\nact of handing him a nickel.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Martin said, addressing them collectively.  \"I wish you a\ngood day.\"\n\n\"Robber!\" Mr. Ends snarled after him.\n\n\"Sneak-thief!\" Martin retorted, slamming the door as he passed out.\n\nMartin was elated--so elated that when he recollected that The Hornet\nowed him fifteen dollars for \"The Peri and the Pearl,\" he decided\nforthwith to go and collect it.  But The Hornet was run by a set of clean-\nshaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers who robbed everything and\neverybody, not excepting one another.  After some breakage of the office\nfurniture, the editor (an ex-college athlete), ably assisted by the\nbusiness manager, an advertising agent, and the porter, succeeded in\nremoving Martin from the office and in accelerating, by initial impulse,\nhis descent of the first flight of stairs.\n\n\"Come again, Mr. Eden; glad to see you any time,\" they laughed down at\nhim from the landing above.\n\nMartin grinned as he picked himself up.\n\n\"Phew!\" he murmured back.  \"The Transcontinental crowd were nanny-goats,\nbut you fellows are a lot of prize-fighters.\"\n\nMore laughter greeted this.\n\n\"I must say, Mr. Eden,\" the editor of The Hornet called down, \"that for a\npoet you can go some yourself.  Where did you learn that right cross--if\nI may ask?\"\n\n\"Where you learned that half-Nelson,\" Martin answered.  \"Anyway, you're\ngoing to have a black eye.\"\n\n\"I hope your neck doesn't stiffen up,\" the editor wished solicitously:\n\"What do you say we all go out and have a drink on it--not the neck, of\ncourse, but the little rough-house?\"\n\n\"I'll go you if I lose,\" Martin accepted.\n\nAnd robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the battle\nwas to the strong, and that the fifteen dollars for \"The Peri and the\nPearl\" belonged by right to The Hornet's editorial staff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nArthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria's front steps.  She\nheard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in,\nfound him on the last page of a manuscript.  She had come to make certain\nwhether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner; but\nbefore she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the one with\nwhich he was full.\n\n\"Here, let me read you this,\" he cried, separating the carbon copies and\nrunning the pages of manuscript into shape.  \"It's my latest, and\ndifferent from anything I've done.  It is so altogether different that I\nam almost afraid of it, and yet I've a sneaking idea it is good.  You be\njudge.  It's an Hawaiian story.  I've called it 'Wiki-wiki.'\"\n\nHis face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the\ncold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting.\nShe listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had\nseen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:-\n\n\"Frankly, what do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she, answered.  \"Will it--do you think it will sell?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" was the confession.  \"It's too strong for the\nmagazines.  But it's true, on my word it's true.\"\n\n\"But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won't\nsell?\" she went on inexorably.  \"The reason for your writing is to make a\nliving, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right; but the miserable story got away with me.  I couldn't\nhelp writing it.  It demanded to be written.\"\n\n\"But that character, that Wiki-Wiki, why do you make him talk so roughly?\nSurely it will offend your readers, and surely that is why the editors\nare justified in refusing your work.\"\n\n\"Because the real Wiki-Wiki would have talked that way.\"\n\n\"But it is not good taste.\"\n\n\"It is life,\" he replied bluntly.  \"It is real.  It is true.  And I must\nwrite life as I see it.\"\n\nShe made no answer, and for an awkward moment they sat silent.  It was\nbecause he loved her that he did not quite understand her, and she could\nnot understand him because he was so large that he bulked beyond her\nhorizon.\n\n\"Well, I've collected from the Transcontinental,\" he said in an effort to\nshift the conversation to a more comfortable subject.  The picture of the\nbewhiskered trio, as he had last seen them, mulcted of four dollars and\nninety cents and a ferry ticket, made him chuckle.\n\n\"Then you'll come!\" she cried joyously.  \"That was what I came to find\nout.\"\n\n\"Come?\" he muttered absently.  \"Where?\"\n\n\"Why, to dinner to-morrow.  You know you said you'd recover your suit if\nyou got that money.\"\n\n\"I forgot all about it,\" he said humbly.  \"You see, this morning the\npoundman got Maria's two cows and the baby calf, and--well, it happened\nthat Maria didn't have any money, and so I had to recover her cows for\nher.  That's where the Transcontinental fiver went--'The Ring of Bells'\nwent into the poundman's pocket.\"\n\n\"Then you won't come?\"\n\nHe looked down at his clothing.\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\nTears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes, but she\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"Next Thanksgiving you'll have dinner with me in Delmonico's,\" he said\ncheerily; \"or in London, or Paris, or anywhere you wish.  I know it.\"\n\n\"I saw in the paper a few days ago,\" she announced abruptly, \"that there\nhad been several local appointments to the Railway Mail.  You passed\nfirst, didn't you?\"\n\nHe was compelled to admit that the call had come for him, but that he had\ndeclined it.  \"I was so sure--I am so sure--of myself,\" he concluded.  \"A\nyear from now I'll be earning more than a dozen men in the Railway Mail.\nYou wait and see.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" was all she said, when he finished.  She stood up, pulling at her\ngloves.  \"I must go, Martin.  Arthur is waiting for me.\"\n\nHe took her in his arms and kissed her, but she proved a passive\nsweetheart.  There was no tenseness in her body, her arms did not go\naround him, and her lips met his without their wonted pressure.\n\nShe was angry with him, he concluded, as he returned from the gate.  But\nwhy?  It was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria's cows.  But\nit was only a stroke of fate.  Nobody could be blamed for it.  Nor did it\nenter his head that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had\ndone.  Well, yes, he was to blame a little, was his next thought, for\nhaving refused the call to the Railway Mail.  And she had not liked \"Wiki-\nWiki.\"\n\nHe turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter-carrier on his\nafternoon round.  The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed Martin\nas he took the bundle of long envelopes.  One was not long.  It was short\nand thin, and outside was printed the address of The New York Outview.  He\npaused in the act of tearing the envelope open.  It could not be an\nacceptance.  He had no manuscripts with that publication.  Perhaps--his\nheart almost stood still at the--wild thought--perhaps they were ordering\nan article from him; but the next instant he dismissed the surmise as\nhopelessly impossible.\n\nIt was a short, formal letter, signed by the office editor, merely\ninforming him that an anonymous letter which they had received was\nenclosed, and that he could rest assured the Outview's staff never under\nany circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence.\n\nThe enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand.  It was a\nhotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin, and of assertion that the \"so-\ncalled Martin Eden\" who was selling stories to magazines was no writer at\nall, and that in reality he was stealing stories from old magazines,\ntyping them, and sending them out as his own.  The envelope was\npostmarked \"San Leandro.\"  Martin did not require a second thought to\ndiscover the author.  Higginbotham's grammar, Higginbotham's\ncolloquialisms, Higginbotham's mental quirks and processes, were apparent\nthroughout.  Martin saw in every line, not the fine Italian hand, but the\ncoarse grocer's fist, of his brother-in-law.\n\nBut why? he vainly questioned.  What injury had he done Bernard\nHigginbotham?  The thing was so unreasonable, so wanton.  There was no\nexplaining it.  In the course of the week a dozen similar letters were\nforwarded to Martin by the editors of various Eastern magazines.  The\neditors were behaving handsomely, Martin concluded.  He was wholly\nunknown to them, yet some of them had even been sympathetic.  It was\nevident that they detested anonymity.  He saw that the malicious attempt\nto hurt him had failed.  In fact, if anything came of it, it was bound to\nbe good, for at least his name had been called to the attention of a\nnumber of editors.  Sometime, perhaps, reading a submitted manuscript of\nhis, they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received\nan anonymous letter.  And who was to say that such a remembrance might\nnot sway the balance of their judgment just a trifle in his favor?\n\nIt was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria's\nestimation.  He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain,\ntears of weakness running down her cheeks, vainly endeavoring to put\nthrough a large ironing.  He promptly diagnosed her affliction as La\nGrippe, dosed her with hot whiskey (the remnants in the bottles for which\nBrissenden was responsible), and ordered her to bed.  But Maria was\nrefractory.  The ironing had to be done, she protested, and delivered\nthat night, or else there would be no food on the morrow for the seven\nsmall and hungry Silvas.\n\nTo her astonishment (and it was something that she never ceased from\nrelating to her dying day), she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the\nstove and throw a fancy shirt-waist on the ironing-board.  It was Kate\nFlanagan's best Sunday waist, than whom there was no more exacting and\nfastidiously dressed woman in Maria's world.  Also, Miss Flanagan had\nsent special instruction that said waist must be delivered by that night.\nAs every one knew, she was keeping company with John Collins, the\nblacksmith, and, as Maria knew privily, Miss Flanagan and Mr. Collins\nwere going next day to Golden Gate Park.  Vain was Maria's attempt to\nrescue the garment.  Martin guided her tottering footsteps to a chair,\nfrom where she watched him with bulging eyes.  In a quarter of the time\nit would have taken her she saw the shirt-waist safely ironed, and ironed\nas well as she could have done it, as Martin made her grant.\n\n\"I could work faster,\" he explained, \"if your irons were only hotter.\"\n\nTo her, the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use.\n\n\"Your sprinkling is all wrong,\" he complained next.  \"Here, let me teach\nyou how to sprinkle.  Pressure is what's wanted.  Sprinkle under pressure\nif you want to iron fast.\"\n\nHe procured a packing-case from the woodpile in the cellar, fitted a\ncover to it, and raided the scrap-iron the Silva tribe was collecting for\nthe junkman.  With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, covered with the\nboard and pressed by the iron, the device was complete and in operation.\n\n\"Now you watch me, Maria,\" he said, stripping off to his undershirt and\ngripping an iron that was what he called \"really hot.\"\n\n\"An' when he feenish da iron' he washa da wools,\" as she described it\nafterward.  \"He say, 'Maria, you are da greata fool.  I showa you how to\nwasha da wools,' an' he shows me, too.  Ten minutes he maka da\nmachine--one barrel, one wheel-hub, two poles, justa like dat.\"\n\nMartin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs.\nThe old wheel-hub, fixed on the end of the upright pole, constituted the\nplunger.  Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached to the\nkitchen rafters, so that the hub played upon the woollens in the barrel,\nhe was able, with one hand, thoroughly to pound them.\n\n\"No more Maria washa da wools,\" her story always ended.  \"I maka da kids\nworka da pole an' da hub an' da barrel.  Him da smarta man, Mister Eden.\"\n\nNevertheless, by his masterly operation and improvement of her kitchen-\nlaundry he fell an immense distance in her regard.  The glamour of\nromance with which her imagination had invested him faded away in the\ncold light of fact that he was an ex-laundryman.  All his books, and his\ngrand friends who visited him in carriages or with countless bottles of\nwhiskey, went for naught.  He was, after all, a mere workingman, a member\nof her own class and caste.  He was more human and approachable, but, he\nwas no longer mystery.\n\nMartin's alienation from his family continued.  Following upon Mr.\nHigginbotham's unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt showed his\nhand.  The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some humorous verse, and\na few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity.  Not only did\nhe partially pay up his bills, but he had sufficient balance left to\nredeem his black suit and wheel.  The latter, by virtue of a twisted\ncrank-hanger, required repairing, and, as a matter of friendliness with\nhis future brother-in-law, he sent it to Von Schmidt's shop.\n\nThe afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being\ndelivered by a small boy.  Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly,\nwas Martin's conclusion from this unusual favor.  Repaired wheels usually\nhad to be called for.  But when he examined the wheel, he discovered no\nrepairs had been made.  A little later in the day he telephoned his\nsister's betrothed, and learned that that person didn't want anything to\ndo with him in \"any shape, manner, or form.\"\n\n\"Hermann von Schmidt,\" Martin answered cheerfully, \"I've a good mind to\ncome over and punch that Dutch nose of yours.\"\n\n\"You come to my shop,\" came the reply, \"an' I'll send for the police.  An'\nI'll put you through, too.  Oh, I know you, but you can't make no rough-\nhouse with me.  I don't want nothin' to do with the likes of you.  You're\na loafer, that's what, an' I ain't asleep.  You ain't goin' to do no\nspongin' off me just because I'm marryin' your sister.  Why don't you go\nto work an' earn an honest livin', eh?  Answer me that.\"\n\nMartin's philosophy asserted itself, dissipating his anger, and he hung\nup the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement.  But after\nthe amusement came the reaction, and he was oppressed by his loneliness.\nNobody understood him, nobody seemed to have any use for him, except\nBrissenden, and Brissenden had disappeared, God alone knew where.\n\nTwilight was falling as Martin left the fruit store and turned homeward,\nhis marketing on his arm.  At the corner an electric car had stopped, and\nat sight of a lean, familiar figure alighting, his heart leapt with joy.\nIt was Brissenden, and in the fleeting glimpse, ere the car started up,\nMartin noted the overcoat pockets, one bulging with books, the other\nbulging with a quart bottle of whiskey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nBrissenden gave no explanation of his long absence, nor did Martin pry\ninto it.  He was content to see his friend's cadaverous face opposite him\nthrough the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy.\n\n\"I, too, have not been idle,\" Brissenden proclaimed, after hearing\nMartin's account of the work he had accomplished.\n\nHe pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to\nMartin, who looked at the title and glanced up curiously.\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" Brissenden laughed.  \"Pretty good title, eh?\n'Ephemera'--it is the one word.  And you're responsible for it, what of\nyour _man_, who is always the erected, the vitalized inorganic, the\nlatest of the ephemera, the creature of temperature strutting his little\nspace on the thermometer.  It got into my head and I had to write it to\nget rid of it.  Tell me what you think of it.\"\n\nMartin's face, flushed at first, paled as he read on.  It was perfect\nart.  Form triumphed over substance, if triumph it could be called where\nthe last conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so perfect\nconstruction as to make Martin's head swim with delight, to put\npassionate tears into his eyes, and to send chills creeping up and down\nhis back.  It was a long poem of six or seven hundred lines, and it was a\nfantastic, amazing, unearthly thing.  It was terrific, impossible; and\nyet there it was, scrawled in black ink across the sheets of paper.  It\ndealt with man and his soul-gropings in their ultimate terms, plumbing\nthe abysses of space for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow\nspectrums.  It was a mad orgy of imagination, wassailing in the skull of\na dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the wild\nflutter of fading heart-beats.  The poem swung in majestic rhythm to the\ncool tumult of interstellar conflict, to the onset of starry hosts, to\nthe impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebulae in the darkened\nvoid; and through it all, unceasing and faint, like a silver shuttle, ran\nthe frail, piping voice of man, a querulous chirp amid the screaming of\nplanets and the crash of systems.\n\n\"There is nothing like it in literature,\" Martin said, when at last he\nwas able to speak.  \"It's wonderful!--wonderful!  It has gone to my head.\nI am drunken with it.  That great, infinitesimal question--I can't shake\nit out of my thoughts.  That questing, eternal, ever recurring, thin\nlittle wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears.  It is like the\ndead-march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring of\nlions.  It is insatiable with microscopic desire.  I now I'm making a\nfool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me.  You are--I don't know\nwhat you are--you are wonderful, that's all.  But how do you do it?  How\ndo you do it?\"\n\nMartin paused from his rhapsody, only to break out afresh.\n\n\"I shall never write again.  I am a dauber in clay.  You have shown me\nthe work of the real artificer-artisan.  Genius!  This is something more\nthan genius.  It transcends genius.  It is truth gone mad.  It is true,\nman, every line of it.  I wonder if you realize that, you dogmatist.\nScience cannot give you the lie.  It is the truth of the sneer, stamped\nout from the black iron of the Cosmos and interwoven with mighty rhythms\nof sound into a fabric of splendor and beauty.  And now I won't say\nanother word.  I am overwhelmed, crushed.  Yes, I will, too.  Let me\nmarket it for you.\"\n\nBrissenden grinned.  \"There's not a magazine in Christendom that would\ndare to publish it--you know that.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the sort.  I know there's not a magazine in\nChristendom that wouldn't jump at it.  They don't get things like that\nevery day.  That's no mere poem of the year.  It's the poem of the\ncentury.\"\n\n\"I'd like to take you up on the proposition.\"\n\n\"Now don't get cynical,\" Martin exhorted.  \"The magazine editors are not\nwholly fatuous.  I know that.  And I'll close with you on the bet.  I'll\nwager anything you want that 'Ephemera' is accepted either on the first\nor second offering.\"\n\n\"There's just one thing that prevents me from taking you.\"  Brissenden\nwaited a moment.  \"The thing is big--the biggest I've ever done.  I know\nthat.  It's my swan song.  I am almighty proud of it.  I worship it.  It's\nbetter than whiskey.  It is what I dreamed of--the great and perfect\nthing--when I was a simple young man, with sweet illusions and clean\nideals.  And I've got it, now, in my last grasp, and I'll not have it\npawed over and soiled by a lot of swine.  No, I won't take the bet.  It's\nmine.  I made it, and I've shared it with you.\"\n\n\"But think of the rest of the world,\" Martin protested.  \"The function of\nbeauty is joy-making.\"\n\n\"It's my beauty.\"\n\n\"Don't be selfish.\"\n\n\"I'm not selfish.\"  Brissenden grinned soberly in the way he had when\npleased by the thing his thin lips were about to shape.  \"I'm as\nunselfish as a famished hog.\"\n\nIn vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision.  Martin told him\nthat his hatred of the magazines was rabid, fanatical, and that his\nconduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who\nburned the temple of Diana at Ephesus.  Under the storm of denunciation\nBrissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything the\nother said was quite true, with the exception of the magazine editors.\nHis hatred of them knew no bounds, and he excelled Martin in denunciation\nwhen he turned upon them.\n\n\"I wish you'd type it for me,\" he said.  \"You know how a thousand times\nbetter than any stenographer.  And now I want to give you some advice.\"\nHe drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket.  \"Here's your\n'Shame of the Sun.'  I've read it not once, but twice and three times--the\nhighest compliment I can pay you.  After what you've said about\n'Ephemera' I must be silent.  But this I will say: when 'The Shame of the\nSun' is published, it will make a hit.  It will start a controversy that\nwill be worth thousands to you just in advertising.\"\n\nMartin laughed.  \"I suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the\nmagazines.\"\n\n\"By all means no--that is, if you want to see it in print.  Offer it to\nthe first-class houses.  Some publisher's reader may be mad enough or\ndrunk enough to report favorably on it.  You've read the books.  The meat\nof them has been transmuted in the alembic of Martin Eden's mind and\npoured into 'The Shame of the Sun,' and one day Martin Eden will be\nfamous, and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work.  So you\nmust get a publisher for it--the sooner the better.\"\n\nBrissenden went home late that night; and just as he mounted the first\nstep of the car, he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into his\nhand a small, tightly crumpled wad of paper.\n\n\"Here, take this,\" he said.  \"I was out to the races to-day, and I had\nthe right dope.\"\n\nThe bell clanged and the car pulled out, leaving Martin wondering as to\nthe nature of the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in his hand.  Back in\nhis room he unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.\n\nHe did not scruple to use it.  He knew his friend had always plenty of\nmoney, and he knew also, with profound certitude, that his success would\nenable him to repay it.  In the morning he paid every bill, gave Maria\nthree months' advance on the room, and redeemed every pledge at the\npawnshop.  Next he bought Marian's wedding present, and simpler presents,\nsuitable to Christmas, for Ruth and Gertrude.  And finally, on the\nbalance remaining to him, he herded the whole Silva tribe down into\nOakland.  He was a winter late in redeeming his promise, but redeemed it\nwas, for the last, least Silva got a pair of shoes, as well as Maria\nherself.  Also, there were horns, and dolls, and toys of various sorts,\nand parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all\nthe Silvas to overflowing.\n\nIt was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria's\nheels into a confectioner's in quest if the biggest candy-cane ever made,\nthat he encountered Ruth and her mother.  Mrs. Morse was shocked.  Even\nRuth was hurt, for she had some regard for appearances, and her lover,\ncheek by jowl with Maria, at the head of that army of Portuguese\nragamuffins, was not a pretty sight.  But it was not that which hurt so\nmuch as what she took to be his lack of pride and self-respect.  Further,\nand keenest of all, she read into the incident the impossibility of his\nliving down his working-class origin.  There was stigma enough in the\nfact of it, but shamelessly to flaunt it in the face of the world--her\nworld--was going too far.  Though her engagement to Martin had been kept\nsecret, their long intimacy had not been unproductive of gossip; and in\nthe shop, glancing covertly at her lover and his following, had been\nseveral of her acquaintances.  She lacked the easy largeness of Martin\nand could not rise superior to her environment.  She had been hurt to the\nquick, and her sensitive nature was quivering with the shame of it.  So\nit was, when Martin arrived later in the day, that he kept her present in\nhis breast-pocket, deferring the giving of it to a more propitious\noccasion.  Ruth in tears--passionate, angry tears--was a revelation to\nhim.  The spectacle of her suffering convinced him that he had been a\nbrute, yet in the soul of him he could not see how nor why.  It never\nentered his head to be ashamed of those he knew, and to take the Silvas\nout to a Christmas treat could in no way, so it seemed to him, show lack\nof consideration for Ruth.  On the other hand, he did see Ruth's point of\nview, after she had explained it; and he looked upon it as a feminine\nweakness, such as afflicted all women and the best of women.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\n\"Come on,--I'll show you the real dirt,\" Brissenden said to him, one\nevening in January.\n\nThey had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry Building,\nreturning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show Martin the \"real\ndirt.\"  He turned and fled across the water-front, a meagre shadow in a\nflapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up with him.  At a\nwholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of old port, and\nwith one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car, Martin at his heels\nburdened with several quart-bottles of whiskey.\n\nIf Ruth could see me now, was his thought, while he wondered as to what\nconstituted the real dirt.\n\n\"Maybe nobody will be there,\" Brissenden said, when they dismounted and\nplunged off to the right into the heart of the working-class ghetto,\nsouth of Market Street.  \"In which case you'll miss what you've been\nlooking for so long.\"\n\n\"And what the deuce is that?\" Martin asked.\n\n\"Men, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I found you\nconsorting with in that trader's den.  You read the books and you found\nyourself all alone.  Well, I'm going to show you to-night some other men\nwho've read the books, so that you won't be lonely any more.\"\n\n\"Not that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions,\" he said\nat the end of a block.  \"I'm not interested in book philosophy.  But\nyou'll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine.  But\nwatch out, they'll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the sun.\"\n\n\"Hope Norton's there,\" he panted a little later, resisting Martin's\neffort to relieve him of the two demijohns.  \"Norton's an idealist--a\nHarvard man.  Prodigious memory.  Idealism led him to philosophic\nanarchy, and his family threw him off.  Father's a railroad president and\nmany times millionnaire, but the son's starving in 'Frisco, editing an\nanarchist sheet for twenty-five a month.\"\n\nMartin was little acquainted in San Francisco, and not at all south of\nMarket; so he had no idea of where he was being led.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he said; \"tell me about them beforehand.  What do they do for\na living?  How do they happen to be here?\"\n\n\"Hope Hamilton's there.\"  Brissenden paused and rested his hands.  \"Strawn-\nHamilton's his name--hyphenated, you know--comes of old Southern stock.\nHe's a tramp--laziest man I ever knew, though he's clerking, or trying\nto, in a socialist cooperative store for six dollars a week.  But he's a\nconfirmed hobo.  Tramped into town.  I've seen him sit all day on a bench\nand never a bite pass his lips, and in the evening, when I invited him to\ndinner--restaurant two blocks away--have him say, 'Too much trouble, old\nman.  Buy me a package of cigarettes instead.'  He was a Spencerian like\nyou till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism.  I'll start him on\nmonism if I can.  Norton's another monist--only he affirms naught but\nspirit.  He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they want, too.\"\n\n\"Who is Kreis?\" Martin asked.\n\n\"His rooms we're going to.  One time professor--fired from\nuniversity--usual story.  A mind like a steel trap.  Makes his living any\nold way.  I know he's been a street fakir when he was down.  Unscrupulous.\nRob a corpse of a shroud--anything.  Difference between him--and the\nbourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion.  He'll talk Nietzsche, or\nSchopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in this world, not\nexcepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his monism.  Haeckel is his\nlittle tin god.  The only way to insult him is to take a slap at\nHaeckel.\"\n\n\"Here's the hang-out.\"  Brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs\nentrance, preliminary to the climb.  It was the usual two-story corner\nbuilding, with a saloon and grocery underneath.  \"The gang lives here--got\nthe whole upstairs to themselves.  But Kreis is the only one who has two\nrooms.  Come on.\"\n\nNo lights burned in the upper hall, but Brissenden threaded the utter\nblackness like a familiar ghost.  He stopped to speak to Martin.\n\n\"There's one fellow--Stevens--a theosophist.  Makes a pretty tangle when\nhe gets going.  Just now he's dish-washer in a restaurant.  Likes a good\ncigar.  I've seen him eat in a ten-cent hash-house and pay fifty cents\nfor the cigar he smoked afterward.  I've got a couple in my pocket for\nhim, if he shows up.\"\n\n\"And there's another fellow--Parry--an Australian, a statistician and a\nsporting encyclopaedia.  Ask him the grain output of Paraguay for 1903,\nor the English importation of sheetings into China for 1890, or at what\nweight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson, or who was welter-weight\nchampion of the United States in '68, and you'll get the correct answer\nwith the automatic celerity of a slot-machine.  And there's Andy, a stone-\nmason, has ideas on everything, a good chess-player; and another fellow,\nHarry, a baker, red hot socialist and strong union man.  By the way, you\nremember Cooks' and Waiters' strike--Hamilton was the chap who organized\nthat union and precipitated the strike--planned it all out in advance,\nright here in Kreis's rooms.  Did it just for the fun of it, but was too\nlazy to stay by the union.  Yet he could have risen high if he wanted to.\nThere's no end to the possibilities in that man--if he weren't so\ninsuperably lazy.\"\n\nBrissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked\nthe threshold of a door.  A knock and an answer opened it, and Martin\nfound himself shaking hands with Kreis, a handsome brunette man, with\ndazzling white teeth, a drooping black mustache, and large, flashing\nblack eyes.  Mary, a matronly young blonde, was washing dishes in the\nlittle back room that served for kitchen and dining room.  The front room\nserved as bedchamber and living room.  Overhead was the week's washing,\nhanging in festoons so low that Martin did not see at first the two men\ntalking in a corner.  They hailed Brissenden and his demijohns with\nacclamation, and, on being introduced, Martin learned they were Andy and\nParry.  He joined them and listened attentively to the description of a\nprize-fight Parry had seen the night before; while Brissenden, in his\nglory, plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and the serving of wine\nand whiskey-and-sodas.  At his command, \"Bring in the clan,\" Andy\ndeparted to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers.\n\n\"We're lucky that most of them are here,\" Brissenden whispered to Martin.\n\"There's Norton and Hamilton; come on and meet them.  Stevens isn't\naround, I hear.  I'm going to get them started on monism if I can.  Wait\ntill they get a few jolts in them and they'll warm up.\"\n\nAt first the conversation was desultory.  Nevertheless Martin could not\nfail to appreciate the keen play of their minds.  They were men with\nopinions, though the opinions often clashed, and, though they were witty\nand clever, they were not superficial.  He swiftly saw, no matter upon\nwhat they talked, that each man applied the correlation of knowledge and\nhad also a deep-seated and unified conception of society and the Cosmos.\nNobody manufactured their opinions for them; they were all rebels of one\nvariety or another, and their lips were strangers to platitudes.  Never\nhad Martin, at the Morses', heard so amazing a range of topics discussed.\nThere seemed no limit save time to the things they were alive to.  The\ntalk wandered from Mrs. Humphry Ward's new book to Shaw's latest play,\nthrough the future of the drama to reminiscences of Mansfield.  They\nappreciated or sneered at the morning editorials, jumped from labor\nconditions in New Zealand to Henry James and Brander Matthews, passed on\nto the German designs in the Far East and the economic aspect of the\nYellow Peril, wrangled over the German elections and Bebel's last speech,\nand settled down to local politics, the latest plans and scandals in the\nunion labor party administration, and the wires that were pulled to bring\nabout the Coast Seamen's strike.  Martin was struck by the inside\nknowledge they possessed.  They knew what was never printed in the\nnewspapers--the wires and strings and the hidden hands that made the\npuppets dance.  To Martin's surprise, the girl, Mary, joined in the\nconversation, displaying an intelligence he had never encountered in the\nfew women he had met.  They talked together on Swinburne and Rossetti,\nafter which she led him beyond his depth into the by-paths of French\nliterature.  His revenge came when she defended Maeterlinck and he\nbrought into action the carefully-thought-out thesis of \"The Shame of the\nSun.\"\n\nSeveral other men had dropped in, and the air was thick with tobacco\nsmoke, when Brissenden waved the red flag.\n\n\"Here's fresh meat for your axe, Kreis,\" he said; \"a rose-white youth\nwith the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer.  Make a Haeckelite of\nhim--if you can.\"\n\nKreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic, magnetic thing,\nwhile Norton looked at Martin sympathetically, with a sweet, girlish\nsmile, as much as to say that he would be amply protected.\n\nKreis began directly on Martin, but step by step Norton interfered, until\nhe and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle.  Martin listened and\nfain would have rubbed his eyes.  It was impossible that this should be,\nmuch less in the labor ghetto south of Market.  The books were alive in\nthese men.  They talked with fire and enthusiasm, the intellectual\nstimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger stir other men.\nWhat he heard was no longer the philosophy of the dry, printed word,\nwritten by half-mythical demigods like Kant and Spencer.  It was living\nphilosophy, with warm, red blood, incarnated in these two men till its\nvery features worked with excitement.  Now and again other men joined in,\nand all followed the discussion with cigarettes going out in their hands\nand with alert, intent faces.\n\nIdealism had never attracted Martin, but the exposition it now received\nat the hands of Norton was a revelation.  The logical plausibility of it,\nthat made an appeal to his intellect, seemed missed by Kreis and\nHamilton, who sneered at Norton as a metaphysician, and who, in turn,\nsneered back at them as metaphysicians.  Phenomenon and noumenon were\nbandied back and forth.  They charged him with attempting to explain\nconsciousness by itself.  He charged them with word-jugglery, with\nreasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory.  At this\nthey were aghast.  It was the cardinal tenet of their mode of reasoning\nto start with facts and to give names to the facts.\n\nWhen Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant, Kreis reminded him\nthat all good little German philosophies when they died went to Oxford.  A\nlittle later Norton reminded them of Hamilton's Law of Parsimony, the\napplication of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning process\nof theirs.  And Martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all.  But\nNorton was no Spencerian, and he, too, strove for Martin's philosophic\nsoul, talking as much at him as to his two opponents.\n\n\"You know Berkeley has never been answered,\" he said, looking directly at\nMartin.  \"Herbert Spencer came the nearest, which was not very near.  Even\nthe stanchest of Spencer's followers will not go farther.  I was reading\nan essay of Saleeby's the other day, and the best Saleeby could say was\nthat Herbert Spencer _nearly_ succeeded in answering Berkeley.\"\n\n\"You know what Hume said?\" Hamilton asked.  Norton nodded, but Hamilton\ngave it for the benefit of the rest.  \"He said that Berkeley's arguments\nadmit of no answer and produce no conviction.\"\n\n\"In his, Hume's, mind,\" was the reply.  \"And Hume's mind was the same as\nyours, with this difference: he was wise enough to admit there was no\nanswering Berkeley.\"\n\nNorton was sensitive and excitable, though he never lost his head, while\nKreis and Hamilton were like a pair of cold-blooded savages, seeking out\ntender places to prod and poke.  As the evening grew late, Norton,\nsmarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician, clutching\nhis chair to keep from jumping to his feet, his gray eyes snapping and\nhis girlish face grown harsh and sure, made a grand attack upon their\nposition.\n\n\"All right, you Haeckelites, I may reason like a medicine man, but, pray,\nhow do you reason?  You have nothing to stand on, you unscientific\ndogmatists with your positive science which you are always lugging about\ninto places it has no right to be.  Long before the school of\nmaterialistic monism arose, the ground was removed so that there could be\nno foundation.  Locke was the man, John Locke.  Two hundred years\nago--more than that, even in his 'Essay concerning the Human\nUnderstanding,' he proved the non-existence of innate ideas.  The best of\nit is that that is precisely what you claim.  To-night, again and again,\nyou have asserted the non-existence of innate ideas.\n\n\"And what does that mean?  It means that you can never know ultimate\nreality.  Your brains are empty when you are born.  Appearances, or\nphenomena, are all the content your minds can receive from your five\nsenses.  Then noumena, which are not in your minds when you are born,\nhave no way of getting in--\"\n\n\"I deny--\" Kreis started to interrupt.\n\n\"You wait till I'm done,\" Norton shouted.  \"You can know only that much\nof the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one way or\nanother on our senses.  You see, I am willing to admit, for the sake of\nthe argument, that matter exists; and what I am about to do is to efface\nyou by your own argument.  I can't do it any other way, for you are both\ncongenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction.\"\n\n\"And now, what do you know of matter, according to your own positive\nscience?  You know it only by its phenomena, its appearances.  You are\naware only of its changes, or of such changes in it as cause changes in\nyour consciousness.  Positive science deals only with phenomena, yet you\nare foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with noumena.\nYet, by the very definition of positive science, science is concerned\nonly with appearances.  As somebody has said, phenomenal knowledge cannot\ntranscend phenomena.\"\n\n\"You cannot answer Berkeley, even if you have annihilated Kant, and yet,\nperforce, you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science\nproves the non-existence of God, or, as much to the point, the existence\nof matter.--You know I granted the reality of matter only in order to\nmake myself intelligible to your understanding.  Be positive scientists,\nif you please; but ontology has no place in positive science, so leave it\nalone.  Spencer is right in his agnosticism, but if Spencer--\"\n\nBut it was time to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and Brissenden\nand Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and\nHamilton waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he\nfinished.\n\n\"You have given me a glimpse of fairyland,\" Martin said on the\nferry-boat.  \"It makes life worth while to meet people like that.  My\nmind is all worked up.  I never appreciated idealism before.  Yet I can't\naccept it.  I know that I shall always be a realist.  I am so made, I\nguess.  But I'd like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton, and I\nthink I'd have had a word or two for Norton.  I didn't see that Spencer\nwas damaged any.  I'm as excited as a child on its first visit to the\ncircus.  I see I must read up some more.  I'm going to get hold of\nSaleeby.  I still think Spencer is unassailable, and next time I'm going\nto take a hand myself.\"\n\nBut Brissenden, breathing painfully, had dropped off to sleep, his chin\nburied in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest, his body wrapped in\nthe long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nThe first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to\nBrissenden's advice and command.  \"The Shame of the Sun\" he wrapped and\nmailed to The Acropolis.  He believed he could find magazine publication\nfor it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend him\nto the book-publishing houses.  \"Ephemera\" he likewise wrapped and mailed\nto a magazine.  Despite Brissenden's prejudice against the magazines,\nwhich was a pronounced mania with him, Martin decided that the great poem\nshould see print.  He did not intend, however, to publish it without the\nother's permission.  His plan was to get it accepted by one of the high\nmagazines, and, thus armed, again to wrestle with Brissenden for consent.\n\nMartin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number of\nweeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its\ninsistent clamor to be created.  Apparently it was to be a rattling sea\nstory, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real\ncharacters, in a real world, under real conditions.  But beneath the\nswing and go of the story was to be something else--something that the\nsuperficial reader would never discern and which, on the other hand,\nwould not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a\nreader.  It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin to\nwrite it.  For that matter, it was always the great, universal motif that\nsuggested plots to him.  After having found such a motif, he cast about\nfor the particular persons and particular location in time and space\nwherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing.  \"Overdue\" was the\ntitle he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not be more\nthan sixty thousand words--a bagatelle for him with his splendid vigor of\nproduction.  On this first day he took hold of it with conscious delight\nin the mastery of his tools.  He no longer worried for fear that the\nsharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work.  The long months of\nintense application and study had brought their reward.  He could now\ndevote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he\nshaped; and as he worked, hour after hour, he felt, as never before, the\nsure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the affairs of life.\n\"Overdue\" would tell a story that would be true of its particular\ncharacters and its particular events; but it would tell, too, he was\nconfident, great vital things that would be true of all time, and all\nsea, and all life--thanks to Herbert Spencer, he thought, leaning back\nfor a moment from the table.  Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer and to the\nmaster-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in his hands.\n\nHe was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing.  \"It will go!  It\nwill go!\" was the refrain that kept, sounding in his ears.  Of course it\nwould go.  At last he was turning out the thing at which the magazines\nwould jump.  The whole story worked out before him in lightning flashes.\nHe broke off from it long enough to write a paragraph in his note-book.\nThis would be the last paragraph in \"Overdue\"; but so thoroughly was the\nwhole book already composed in his brain that he could write, weeks\nbefore he had arrived at the end, the end itself.  He compared the tale,\nas yet unwritten, with the tales of the sea-writers, and he felt it to be\nimmeasurably superior.  \"There's only one man who could touch it,\" he\nmurmured aloud, \"and that's Conrad.  And it ought to make even him sit up\nand shake hands with me, and say, 'Well done, Martin, my boy.'\"\n\nHe toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was to\nhave dinner at the Morses'.  Thanks to Brissenden, his black suit was out\nof pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties.  Down town he\nstopped off long enough to run into the library and search for Saleeby's\nbooks.  He drew out \"The Cycle of Life,\" and on the car turned to the\nessay Norton had mentioned on Spencer.  As Martin read, he grew angry.\nHis face flushed, his jaw set, and unconsciously his hand clenched,\nunclenched, and clenched again as if he were taking fresh grips upon some\nhateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life.  When he left the\ncar, he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride, and he\nrang the Morse bell with such viciousness that it roused him to\nconsciousness of his condition, so that he entered in good nature,\nsmiling with amusement at himself.  No sooner, however, was he inside\nthan a great depression descended upon him.  He fell from the height\nwhere he had been up-borne all day on the wings of inspiration.\n\"Bourgeois,\" \"trader's den\"--Brissenden's epithets repeated themselves in\nhis mind.  But what of that? he demanded angrily.  He was marrying Ruth,\nnot her family.\n\nIt seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more\nspiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy.  There was\ncolor in her cheeks, and her eyes drew him again and again--the eyes in\nwhich he had first read immortality.  He had forgotten immortality of\nlate, and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it; but\nhere, in Ruth's eyes, he read an argument without words that transcended\nall worded arguments.  He saw that in her eyes before which all\ndiscussion fled away, for he saw love there.  And in his own eyes was\nlove; and love was unanswerable.  Such was his passionate doctrine.\n\nThe half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left him\nsupremely happy and supremely satisfied with life.  Nevertheless, at\ntable, the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard\nday seized hold of him.  He was aware that his eyes were tired and that\nhe was irritable.  He remembered it was at this table, at which he now\nsneered and was so often bored, that he had first eaten with civilized\nbeings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and\nrefinement.  He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him, so long\nago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony\nof apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of\neating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at a leap\nto live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end to be\nfrankly himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not\npossess.\n\nHe glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that a\npassenger, with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive\nto locate the life preservers.  Well, that much had come out of it--love\nand Ruth.  All the rest had failed to stand the test of the books.  But\nRuth and love had stood the test; for them he found a biological\nsanction.  Love was the most exalted expression of life.  Nature had been\nbusy designing him, as she had been busy with all normal men, for the\npurpose of loving.  She had spent ten thousand centuries--ay, a hundred\nthousand and a million centuries--upon the task, and he was the best she\ncould do.  She had made love the strongest thing in him, increased its\npower a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination, and sent him forth\ninto the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate.  His hand sought Ruth's\nhand beside him hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was given and\nreceived.  She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes were radiant\nand melting.  So were his in the thrill that pervaded him; nor did he\nrealize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been\naroused by what she had seen in his.\n\nAcross the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse's right, sat\nJudge Blount, a local superior court judge.  Martin had met him a number\nof times and had failed to like him.  He and Ruth's father were\ndiscussing labor union politics, the local situation, and socialism, and\nMr. Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic.  At last\nJudge Blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly pity.\nMartin smiled to himself.\n\n\"You'll grow out of it, young man,\" he said soothingly.  \"Time is the\nbest cure for such youthful distempers.\"  He turned to Mr. Morse.  \"I do\nnot believe discussion is good in such cases.  It makes the patient\nobstinate.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" the other assented gravely.  \"But it is well to warn the\npatient occasionally of his condition.\"\n\nMartin laughed merrily, but it was with an effort.  The day had been too\nlong, the day's effort too intense, and he was deep in the throes of the\nreaction.\n\n\"Undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors,\" he said; \"but if you care a\nwhit for the opinion of the patient, let him tell you that you are poor\ndiagnosticians.  In fact, you are both suffering from the disease you\nthink you find in me.  As for me, I am immune.  The socialist philosophy\nthat riots half-baked in your veins has passed me by.\"\n\n\"Clever, clever,\" murmured the judge.  \"An excellent ruse in controversy,\nto reverse positions.\"\n\n\"Out of your mouth.\"  Martin's eyes were sparkling, but he kept control\nof himself.  \"You see, Judge, I've heard your campaign speeches.  By some\nhenidical process--henidical, by the way is a favorite word of mine which\nnobody understands--by some henidical process you persuade yourself that\nyou believe in the competitive system and the survival of the strong, and\nat the same time you indorse with might and main all sorts of measures to\nshear the strength from the strong.\"\n\n\"My young man--\"\n\n\"Remember, I've heard your campaign speeches,\" Martin warned.  \"It's on\nrecord, your position on interstate commerce regulation, on regulation of\nthe railway trust and Standard Oil, on the conservation of the forests,\non a thousand and one restrictive measures that are nothing else than\nsocialistic.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating these\nvarious outrageous exercises of power?\"\n\n\"That's not the point.  I mean to tell you that you are a poor\ndiagnostician.  I mean to tell you that I am not suffering from the\nmicrobe of socialism.  I mean to tell you that it is you who are\nsuffering from the emasculating ravages of that same microbe.  As for me,\nI am an inveterate opponent of socialism just as I am an inveterate\nopponent of your own mongrel democracy that is nothing else than pseudo-\nsocialism masquerading under a garb of words that will not stand the test\nof the dictionary.\"\n\n\"I am a reactionary--so complete a reactionary that my position is\nincomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social organization\nand whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil.  You make believe\nthat you believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the\nstrong.  I believe.  That is the difference.  When I was a trifle\nyounger,--a few months younger,--I believed the same thing.  You see, the\nideas of you and yours had impressed me.  But merchants and traders are\ncowardly rulers at best; they grunt and grub all their days in the trough\nof money-getting, and I have swung back to aristocracy, if you please.  I\nam the only individualist in this room.  I look to the state for nothing.\nI look only to the strong man, the man on horseback, to save the state\nfrom its own rotten futility.\"\n\n\"Nietzsche was right.  I won't take the time to tell you who Nietzsche\nwas, but he was right.  The world belongs to the strong--to the strong\nwho are noble as well and who do not wallow in the swine-trough of trade\nand exchange.  The world belongs to the true nobleman, to the great blond\nbeasts, to the noncompromisers, to the 'yes-sayers.'  And they will eat\nyou up, you socialists--who are afraid of socialism and who think\nyourselves individualists.  Your slave-morality of the meek and lowly\nwill never save you.--Oh, it's all Greek, I know, and I won't bother you\nany more with it.  But remember one thing.  There aren't half a dozen\nindividualists in Oakland, but Martin Eden is one of them.\"\n\nHe signified that he was done with the discussion, and turned to Ruth.\n\n\"I'm wrought up to-day,\" he said in an undertone.  \"All I want to do is\nto love, not talk.\"\n\nHe ignored Mr. Morse, who said:-\n\n\"I am unconvinced.  All socialists are Jesuits.  That is the way to tell\nthem.\"\n\n\"We'll make a good Republican out of you yet,\" said Judge Blount.\n\n\"The man on horseback will arrive before that time,\" Martin retorted with\ngood humor, and returned to Ruth.\n\nBut Mr. Morse was not content.  He did not like the laziness and the\ndisinclination for sober, legitimate work of this prospective son-in-law\nof his, for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose nature he had no\nunderstanding.  So he turned the conversation to Herbert Spencer.  Judge\nBlount ably seconded him, and Martin, whose ears had pricked at the first\nmention of the philosopher's name, listened to the judge enunciate a\ngrave and complacent diatribe against Spencer.  From time to time Mr.\nMorse glanced at Martin, as much as to say, \"There, my boy, you see.\"\n\n\"Chattering daws,\" Martin muttered under his breath, and went on talking\nwith Ruth and Arthur.\n\nBut the long day and the \"real dirt\" of the night before were telling\nupon him; and, besides, still in his burnt mind was what had made him\nangry when he read it on the car.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" Ruth asked suddenly alarmed by the effort he was\nmaking to contain himself.\n\n\"There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is its prophet,\"\nJudge Blount was saying at that moment.\n\nMartin turned upon him.\n\n\"A cheap judgment,\" he remarked quietly.  \"I heard it first in the City\nHall Park, on the lips of a workingman who ought to have known better.  I\nhave heard it often since, and each time the clap-trap of it nauseates\nme.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  To hear that great and noble\nman's name upon your lips is like finding a dew-drop in a cesspool.  You\nare disgusting.\"\n\nIt was like a thunderbolt.  Judge Blount glared at him with apoplectic\ncountenance, and silence reigned.  Mr. Morse was secretly pleased.  He\ncould see that his daughter was shocked.  It was what he wanted to do--to\nbring out the innate ruffianism of this man he did not like.\n\nRuth's hand sought Martin's beseechingly under the table, but his blood\nwas up.  He was inflamed by the intellectual pretence and fraud of those\nwho sat in the high places.  A Superior Court Judge!  It was only several\nyears before that he had looked up from the mire at such glorious\nentities and deemed them gods.\n\nJudge Blount recovered himself and attempted to go on, addressing himself\nto Martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter understood was\nfor the benefit of the ladies.  Even this added to his anger.  Was there\nno honesty in the world?\n\n\"You can't discuss Spencer with me,\" he cried.  \"You do not know any more\nabout Spencer than do his own countrymen.  But it is no fault of yours, I\ngrant.  It is just a phase of the contemptible ignorance of the times.  I\nran across a sample of it on my way here this evening.  I was reading an\nessay by Saleeby on Spencer.  You should read it.  It is accessible to\nall men.  You can buy it in any book-store or draw it from the public\nlibrary.  You would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and ignorance\nof that noble man compared with what Saleeby has collected on the\nsubject.  It is a record of shame that would shame your shame.\"\n\n\"'The philosopher of the half-educated,' he was called by an academic\nPhilosopher who was not worthy to pollute the atmosphere he breathed.  I\ndon't think you have read ten pages of Spencer, but there have been\ncritics, assumably more intelligent than you, who have read no more than\nyou of Spencer, who publicly challenged his followers to adduce one\nsingle idea from all his writings--from Herbert Spencer's writings, the\nman who has impressed the stamp of his genius over the whole field of\nscientific research and modern thought; the father of psychology; the man\nwho revolutionized pedagogy, so that to-day the child of the French\npeasant is taught the three R's according to principles laid down by him.\nAnd the little gnats of men sting his memory when they get their very\nbread and butter from the technical application of his ideas.  What\nlittle of worth resides in their brains is largely due to him.  It is\ncertain that had he never lived, most of what is correct in their parrot-\nlearned knowledge would be absent.\"\n\n\"And yet a man like Principal Fairbanks of Oxford--a man who sits in an\neven higher place than you, Judge Blount--has said that Spencer will be\ndismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather than a thinker.\nYappers and blatherskites, the whole brood of them!  '\"First Principles\"\nis not wholly destitute of a certain literary power,' said one of them.\nAnd others of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather\nthan an original thinker.  Yappers and blatherskites!  Yappers and\nblatherskites!\"\n\nMartin ceased abruptly, in a dead silence.  Everybody in Ruth's family\nlooked up to Judge Blount as a man of power and achievement, and they\nwere horrified at Martin's outbreak.  The remainder of the dinner passed\nlike a funeral, the judge and Mr. Morse confining their talk to each\nother, and the rest of the conversation being extremely desultory.  Then\nafterward, when Ruth and Martin were alone, there was a scene.\n\n\"You are unbearable,\" she wept.\n\nBut his anger still smouldered, and he kept muttering, \"The beasts!  The\nbeasts!\"\n\nWhen she averred he had insulted the judge, he retorted:-\n\n\"By telling the truth about him?\"\n\n\"I don't care whether it was true or not,\" she insisted.  \"There are\ncertain bounds of decency, and you had no license to insult anybody.\"\n\n\"Then where did Judge Blount get the license to assault truth?\" Martin\ndemanded.  \"Surely to assault truth is a more serious misdemeanor than to\ninsult a pygmy personality such as the judge's.  He did worse than that.\nHe blackened the name of a great, noble man who is dead.  Oh, the beasts!\nThe beasts!\"\n\nHis complex anger flamed afresh, and Ruth was in terror of him.  Never\nhad she seen him so angry, and it was all mystified and unreasonable to\nher comprehension.  And yet, through her very terror ran the fibres of\nfascination that had drawn and that still drew her to him--that had\ncompelled her to lean towards him, and, in that mad, culminating moment,\nlay her hands upon his neck.  She was hurt and outraged by what had taken\nplace, and yet she lay in his arms and quivered while he went on\nmuttering, \"The beasts!  The beasts!\"  And she still lay there when he\nsaid: \"I'll not bother your table again, dear.  They do not like me, and\nit is wrong of me to thrust my objectionable presence upon them.  Besides,\nthey are just as objectionable to me.  Faugh!  They are sickening.  And\nto think of it, I dreamed in my innocence that the persons who sat in the\nhigh places, who lived in fine houses and had educations and bank\naccounts, were worth while!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\n\"Come on, let's go down to the local.\"\n\nSo spoke Brissenden, faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour before--the\nsecond hemorrhage in three days.  The perennial whiskey glass was in his\nhands, and he drained it with shaking fingers.\n\n\"What do I want with socialism?\" Martin demanded.\n\n\"Outsiders are allowed five-minute speeches,\" the sick man urged.  \"Get\nup and spout.  Tell them why you don't want socialism.  Tell them what\nyou think about them and their ghetto ethics.  Slam Nietzsche into them\nand get walloped for your pains.  Make a scrap of it.  It will do them\ngood.  Discussion is what they want, and what you want, too.  You see,\nI'd like to see you a socialist before I'm gone.  It will give you a\nsanction for your existence.  It is the one thing that will save you in\nthe time of disappointment that is coming to you.\"\n\n\"I never can puzzle out why you, of all men, are a socialist,\" Martin\npondered.  \"You detest the crowd so.  Surely there is nothing in the\ncanaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul.\"  He pointed an accusing\nfinger at the whiskey glass which the other was refilling.  \"Socialism\ndoesn't seem to save you.\"\n\n\"I'm very sick,\" was the answer.  \"With you it is different.  You have\nhealth and much to live for, and you must be handcuffed to life somehow.\nAs for me, you wonder why I am a socialist.  I'll tell you.  It is\nbecause Socialism is inevitable; because the present rotten and\nirrational system cannot endure; because the day is past for your man on\nhorseback.  The slaves won't stand for it.  They are too many, and willy-\nnilly they'll drag down the would-be equestrian before ever he gets\nastride.  You can't get away from them, and you'll have to swallow the\nwhole slave-morality.  It's not a nice mess, I'll allow.  But it's been a-\nbrewing and swallow it you must.  You are antediluvian anyway, with your\nNietzsche ideas.  The past is past, and the man who says history repeats\nitself is a liar.  Of course I don't like the crowd, but what's a poor\nchap to do?  We can't have the man on horseback, and anything is\npreferable to the timid swine that now rule.  But come on, anyway.  I'm\nloaded to the guards now, and if I sit here any longer, I'll get drunk.\nAnd you know the doctor says--damn the doctor!  I'll fool him yet.\"\n\nIt was Sunday night, and they found the small hall packed by the Oakland\nsocialists, chiefly members of the working class.  The speaker, a clever\nJew, won Martin's admiration at the same time that he aroused his\nantagonism.  The man's stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened chest\nproclaimed him the true child of the crowded ghetto, and strong on Martin\nwas the age-long struggle of the feeble, wretched slaves against the\nlordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would rule over them to\nthe end of time.  To Martin this withered wisp of a creature was a\nsymbol.  He was the figure that stood forth representative of the whole\nmiserable mass of weaklings and inefficients who perished according to\nbiological law on the ragged confines of life.  They were the unfit.  In\nspite of their cunning philosophy and of their antlike proclivities for\ncooperation, Nature rejected them for the exceptional man.  Out of the\nplentiful spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she selected\nonly the best.  It was by the same method that men, aping her, bred race-\nhorses and cucumbers.  Doubtless, a creator of a Cosmos could have\ndevised a better method; but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put\nup with this particular method.  Of course, they could squirm as they\nperished, as the socialists squirmed, as the speaker on the platform and\nthe perspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled together\nfor some new device with which to minimize the penalties of living and\noutwit the Cosmos.\n\nSo Martin thought, and so he spoke when Brissenden urged him to give them\nhell.  He obeyed the mandate, walking up to the platform, as was the\ncustom, and addressing the chairman.  He began in a low voice, haltingly,\nforming into order the ideas which had surged in his brain while the Jew\nwas speaking.  In such meetings five minutes was the time allotted to\neach speaker; but when Martin's five minutes were up, he was in full\nstride, his attack upon their doctrines but half completed.  He had\ncaught their interest, and the audience urged the chairman by acclamation\nto extend Martin's time.  They appreciated him as a foeman worthy of\ntheir intellect, and they listened intently, following every word.  He\nspoke with fire and conviction, mincing no words in his attack upon the\nslaves and their morality and tactics and frankly alluding to his hearers\nas the slaves in question.  He quoted Spencer and Malthus, and enunciated\nthe biological law of development.\n\n\"And so,\" he concluded, in a swift resume, \"no state composed of the\nslave-types can endure.  The old law of development still holds.  In the\nstruggle for existence, as I have shown, the strong and the progeny of\nthe strong tend to survive, while the weak and the progeny of the weak\nare crushed and tend to perish.  The result is that the strong and the\nprogeny of the strong survive, and, so long as the struggle obtains, the\nstrength of each generation increases.  That is development.  But you\nslaves--it is too bad to be slaves, I grant--but you slaves dream of a\nsociety where the law of development will be annulled, where no weaklings\nand inefficients will perish, where every inefficient will have as much\nas he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires, and where all will\nmarry and have progeny--the weak as well as the strong.  What will be the\nresult?  No longer will the strength and life-value of each generation\nincrease.  On the contrary, it will diminish.  There is the Nemesis of\nyour slave philosophy.  Your society of slaves--of, by, and for,\nslaves--must inevitably weaken and go to pieces as the life which\ncomposes it weakens and goes to pieces.\n\n\"Remember, I am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics.  No state\nof slaves can stand--\"\n\n\"How about the United States?\" a man yelled from the audience.\n\n\"And how about it?\" Martin retorted.  \"The thirteen colonies threw off\ntheir rulers and formed the Republic so-called.  The slaves were their\nown masters.  There were no more masters of the sword.  But you couldn't\nget along without masters of some sort, and there arose a new set of\nmasters--not the great, virile, noble men, but the shrewd and spidery\ntraders and money-lenders.  And they enslaved you over again--but not\nfrankly, as the true, noble men would do with weight of their own right\narms, but secretly, by spidery machinations and by wheedling and cajolery\nand lies.  They have purchased your slave judges, they have debauched\nyour slave legislatures, and they have forced to worse horrors than\nchattel slavery your slave boys and girls.  Two million of your children\nare toiling to-day in this trader-oligarchy of the United States.  Ten\nmillions of you slaves are not properly sheltered nor properly fed.\"\n\n\"But to return.  I have shown that no society of slaves can endure,\nbecause, in its very nature, such society must annul the law of\ndevelopment.  No sooner can a slave society be organized than\ndeterioration sets in.  It is easy for you to talk of annulling the law\nof development, but where is the new law of development that will\nmaintain your strength?  Formulate it.  Is it already formulated?  Then\nstate it.\"\n\nMartin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices.  A score of men were on\ntheir feet clamoring for recognition from the chair.  And one by one,\nencouraged by vociferous applause, speaking with fire and enthusiasm and\nexcited gestures, they replied to the attack.  It was a wild night--but\nit was wild intellectually, a battle of ideas.  Some strayed from the\npoint, but most of the speakers replied directly to Martin.  They shook\nhim with lines of thought that were new to him; and gave him insights,\nnot into new biological laws, but into new applications of the old laws.\nThey were too earnest to be always polite, and more than once the\nchairman rapped and pounded for order.\n\nIt chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience, detailed there on a\nday dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for\nsensation.  He was not a bright cub reporter.  He was merely facile and\nglib.  He was too dense to follow the discussion.  In fact, he had a\ncomfortable feeling that he was vastly superior to these wordy maniacs of\nthe working class.  Also, he had a great respect for those who sat in the\nhigh places and dictated the policies of nations and newspapers.  Further,\nhe had an ideal, namely, of achieving that excellence of the perfect\nreporter who is able to make something--even a great deal--out of\nnothing.\n\nHe did not know what all the talk was about.  It was not necessary.  Words\nlike _revolution_ gave him his cue.  Like a paleontologist, able to\nreconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was able to\nreconstruct a whole speech from the one word _revolution_.  He did it\nthat night, and he did it well; and since Martin had made the biggest\nstir, he put it all into his mouth and made him the arch-anarch of the\nshow, transforming his reactionary individualism into the most lurid, red-\nshirt socialist utterance.  The cub reporter was an artist, and it was a\nlarge brush with which he laid on the local color--wild-eyed long-haired\nmen, neurasthenic and degenerate types of men, voices shaken with\npassion, clenched fists raised on high, and all projected against a\nbackground of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of angry men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nOver the coffee, in his little room, Martin read next morning's paper.  It\nwas a novel experience to find himself head-lined, on the first page at\nthat; and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious leader\nof the Oakland socialists.  He ran over the violent speech the cub\nreporter had constructed for him, and, though at first he was angered by\nthe fabrication, in the end he tossed the paper aside with a laugh.\n\n\"Either the man was drunk or criminally malicious,\" he said that\nafternoon, from his perch on the bed, when Brissenden had arrived and\ndropped limply into the one chair.\n\n\"But what do you care?\" Brissenden asked.  \"Surely you don't desire the\napproval of the bourgeois swine that read the newspapers?\"\n\nMartin thought for a while, then said:-\n\n\"No, I really don't care for their approval, not a whit.  On the other\nhand, it's very likely to make my relations with Ruth's family a trifle\nawkward.  Her father always contended I was a socialist, and this\nmiserable stuff will clinch his belief.  Not that I care for his\nopinion--but what's the odds?  I want to read you what I've been doing to-\nday.  It's 'Overdue,' of course, and I'm just about halfway through.\"\n\nHe was reading aloud when Maria thrust open the door and ushered in a\nyoung man in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him, noting the oil-\nburner and the kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered on to\nMartin.\n\n\"Sit down,\" Brissenden said.\n\nMartin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him to\nbroach his business.\n\n\"I heard you speak last night, Mr. Eden, and I've come to interview you,\"\nhe began.\n\nBrissenden burst out in a hearty laugh.\n\n\"A brother socialist?\" the reporter asked, with a quick glance at\nBrissenden that appraised the color-value of that cadaverous and dying\nman.\n\n\"And he wrote that report,\" Martin said softly.  \"Why, he is only a boy!\"\n\n\"Why don't you poke him?\" Brissenden asked.  \"I'd give a thousand dollars\nto have my lungs back for five minutes.\"\n\nThe cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and\naround him and at him.  But he had been commended for his brilliant\ndescription of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to get\na personal interview with Martin Eden, the leader of the organized menace\nto society.\n\n\"You do not object to having your picture taken, Mr. Eden?\" he said.\n\"I've a staff photographer outside, you see, and he says it will be\nbetter to take you right away before the sun gets lower.  Then we can\nhave the interview afterward.\"\n\n\"A photographer,\" Brissenden said meditatively.  \"Poke him, Martin!  Poke\nhim!\"\n\n\"I guess I'm getting old,\" was the answer.  \"I know I ought, but I really\nhaven't the heart.  It doesn't seem to matter.\"\n\n\"For his mother's sake,\" Brissenden urged.\n\n\"It's worth considering,\" Martin replied; \"but it doesn't seem worth\nwhile enough to rouse sufficient energy in me.  You see, it does take\nenergy to give a fellow a poking.  Besides, what does it matter?\"\n\n\"That's right--that's the way to take it,\" the cub announced airily,\nthough he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door.\n\n\"But it wasn't true, not a word of what he wrote,\" Martin went on,\nconfining his attention to Brissenden.\n\n\"It was just in a general way a description, you understand,\" the cub\nventured, \"and besides, it's good advertising.  That's what counts.  It\nwas a favor to you.\"\n\n\"It's good advertising, Martin, old boy,\" Brissenden repeated solemnly.\n\n\"And it was a favor to me--think of that!\" was Martin's contribution.\n\n\"Let me see--where were you born, Mr. Eden?\" the cub asked, assuming an\nair of expectant attention.\n\n\"He doesn't take notes,\" said Brissenden.  \"He remembers it all.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient for me.\"  The cub was trying not to look worried.  \"No\ndecent reporter needs to bother with notes.\"\n\n\"That was sufficient--for last night.\"  But Brissenden was not a disciple\nof quietism, and he changed his attitude abruptly.  \"Martin, if you don't\npoke him, I'll do it myself, if I fall dead on the floor the next\nmoment.\"\n\n\"How will a spanking do?\" Martin asked.\n\nBrissenden considered judicially, and nodded his head.\n\nThe next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub\nface downward across his knees.\n\n\"Now don't bite,\" Martin warned, \"or else I'll have to punch your face.\nIt would be a pity, for it is such a pretty face.\"\n\nHis uplifted hand descended, and thereafter rose and fell in a swift and\nsteady rhythm.  The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed, but did not\noffer to bite.  Brissenden looked on gravely, though once he grew excited\nand gripped the whiskey bottle, pleading, \"Here, just let me swat him\nonce.\"\n\n\"Sorry my hand played out,\" Martin said, when at last he desisted.  \"It\nis quite numb.\"\n\nHe uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed.\n\n\"I'll have you arrested for this,\" he snarled, tears of boyish\nindignation running down his flushed cheeks.  \"I'll make you sweat for\nthis.  You'll see.\"\n\n\"The pretty thing,\" Martin remarked.  \"He doesn't realize that he has\nentered upon the downward path.  It is not honest, it is not square, it\nis not manly, to tell lies about one's fellow-creatures the way he has\ndone, and he doesn't know it.\"\n\n\"He has to come to us to be told,\" Brissenden filled in a pause.\n\n\"Yes, to me whom he has maligned and injured.  My grocery will\nundoubtedly refuse me credit now.  The worst of it is that the poor boy\nwill keep on this way until he deteriorates into a first-class newspaper\nman and also a first-class scoundrel.\"\n\n\"But there is yet time,\" quoth Brissenden.  \"Who knows but what you may\nprove the humble instrument to save him.  Why didn't you let me swat him\njust once?  I'd like to have had a hand in it.\"\n\n\"I'll have you arrested, the pair of you, you b-b-big brutes,\" sobbed the\nerring soul.\n\n\"No, his mouth is too pretty and too weak.\"  Martin shook his head\nlugubriously.  \"I'm afraid I've numbed my hand in vain.  The young man\ncannot reform.  He will become eventually a very great and successful\nnewspaper man.  He has no conscience.  That alone will make him great.\"\n\nWith that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last for fear\nthat Brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he still\nclutched.\n\nIn the next morning's paper Martin learned a great deal more about\nhimself that was new to him.  \"We are the sworn enemies of society,\" he\nfound himself quoted as saying in a column interview.  \"No, we are not\nanarchists but socialists.\"  When the reporter pointed out to him that\nthere seemed little difference between the two schools, Martin had\nshrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation.  His face was described as\nbilaterally asymmetrical, and various other signs of degeneration were\ndescribed.  Especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery\ngleams in his blood-shot eyes.\n\nHe learned, also, that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City Hall\nPark, and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed the\nminds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most\nrevolutionary speeches.  The cub painted a high-light picture of his poor\nlittle room, its oil-stove and the one chair, and of the death's-head\ntramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had just emerged from\ntwenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress dungeon.\n\nThe cub had been industrious.  He had scurried around and nosed out\nMartin's family history, and procured a photograph of Higginbotham's Cash\nStore with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front.  That\ngentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman who had\nno patience with his brother-in-law's socialistic views, and no patience\nwith the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted as characterizing as\na lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn't take a job when it was offered to\nhim and who would go to jail yet.  Hermann Von Schmidt, Marian's husband,\nhad likewise been interviewed.  He had called Martin the black sheep of\nthe family and repudiated him.  \"He tried to sponge off of me, but I put\na stop to that good and quick,\" Von Schmidt had said to the reporter.  \"He\nknows better than to come bumming around here.  A man who won't work is\nno good, take that from me.\"\n\nThis time Martin was genuinely angry.  Brissenden looked upon the affair\nas a good joke, but he could not console Martin, who knew that it would\nbe no easy task to explain to Ruth.  As for her father, he knew that he\nmust be overjoyed with what had happened and that he would make the most\nof it to break off the engagement.  How much he would make of it he was\nsoon to realize.  The afternoon mail brought a letter from Ruth.  Martin\nopened it with a premonition of disaster, and read it standing at the\nopen door when he had received it from the postman.  As he read,\nmechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper\nof his old cigarette days.  He was not aware that the pocket was empty or\nthat he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a\ncigarette.\n\nIt was not a passionate letter.  There were no touches of anger in it.\nBut all the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was sounded\nthe note of hurt and disappointment.  She had expected better of him.  She\nhad thought he had got over his youthful wildness, that her love for him\nhad been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live seriously and\ndecently.  And now her father and mother had taken a firm stand and\ncommanded that the engagement be broken.  That they were justified in\nthis she could not but admit.  Their relation could never be a happy one.\nIt had been unfortunate from the first.  But one regret she voiced in the\nwhole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin.  \"If only you had\nsettled down to some position and attempted to make something of\nyourself,\" she wrote.  \"But it was not to be.  Your past life had been\ntoo wild and irregular.  I can understand that you are not to be blamed.\nYou could act only according to your nature and your early training.  So\nI do not blame you, Martin.  Please remember that.  It was simply a\nmistake.  As father and mother have contended, we were not made for each\nother, and we should both be happy because it was discovered not too\nlate.\" . . \"There is no use trying to see me,\" she said toward the last.\n\"It would be an unhappy meeting for both of us, as well as for my mother.\nI feel, as it is, that I have caused her great pain and worry.  I shall\nhave to do much living to atone for it.\"\n\nHe read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat down\nand replied.  He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist\nmeeting, pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what the\nnewspaper had put in his mouth.  Toward the end of the letter he was\nGod's own lover pleading passionately for love.  \"Please answer,\" he\nsaid, \"and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing.  Do you love\nme?  That is all--the answer to that one question.\"\n\nBut no answer came the next day, nor the next.  \"Overdue\" lay untouched\nupon the table, and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under the\ntable grew larger.  For the first time Martin's glorious sleep was\ninterrupted by insomnia, and he tossed through long, restless nights.\nThree times he called at the Morse home, but was turned away by the\nservant who answered the bell.  Brissenden lay sick in his hotel, too\nfeeble to stir out, and, though Martin was with him often, he did not\nworry him with his troubles.\n\nFor Martin's troubles were many.  The aftermath of the cub reporter's\ndeed was even wider than Martin had anticipated.  The Portuguese grocer\nrefused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an American\nand proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused\nfurther dealings with him--carrying his patriotism to such a degree that\nhe cancelled Martin's account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it.\nThe talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and indignation\nagainst Martin ran high.  No one would have anything to do with a\nsocialist traitor.  Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but she\nremained loyal.  The children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe\nof the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe\ndistances they called him \"hobo\" and \"bum.\"  The Silva tribe, however,\nstanchly defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his\nhonor, and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day\nand added to Maria's perplexities and troubles.\n\nOnce, Martin met Gertrude on the street, down in Oakland, and learned\nwhat he knew could not be otherwise--that Bernard Higginbotham was\nfurious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace, and\nthat he had forbidden him the house.\n\n\"Why don't you go away, Martin?\" Gertrude had begged.  \"Go away and get a\njob somewhere and steady down.  Afterwards, when this all blows over, you\ncan come back.\"\n\nMartin shook his head, but gave no explanations.  How could he explain?\nHe was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him\nand his people.  He could never cross it and explain to them his\nposition,--the Nietzschean position, in regard to socialism.  There were\nnot words enough in the English language, nor in any language, to make\nhis attitude and conduct intelligible to them.  Their highest concept of\nright conduct, in his case, was to get a job.  That was their first word\nand their last.  It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas.  Get a job!\nGo to work!  Poor, stupid slaves, he thought, while his sister talked.\nSmall wonder the world belonged to the strong.  The slaves were obsessed\nby their own slavery.  A job was to them a golden fetich before which\nthey fell down and worshipped.\n\nHe shook his head again, when Gertrude offered him money, though he knew\nthat within the day he would have to make a trip to the pawnbroker.\n\n\"Don't come near Bernard now,\" she admonished him.  \"After a few months,\nwhen he is cooled down, if you want to, you can get the job of drivin'\ndelivery-wagon for him.  Any time you want me, just send for me an' I'll\ncome.  Don't forget.\"\n\nShe went away weeping audibly, and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot through\nhim at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait.  As he watched her go,\nthe Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter.  The slave-class in\nthe abstract was all very well, but it was not wholly satisfactory when\nit was brought home to his own family.  And yet, if there was ever a\nslave trampled by the strong, that slave was his sister Gertrude.  He\ngrinned savagely at the paradox.  A fine Nietzsche-man he was, to allow\nhis intellectual concepts to be shaken by the first sentiment or emotion\nthat strayed along--ay, to be shaken by the slave-morality itself, for\nthat was what his pity for his sister really was.  The true noble men\nwere above pity and compassion.  Pity and compassion had been generated\nin the subterranean barracoons of the slaves and were no more than the\nagony and sweat of the crowded miserables and weaklings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\n\"Overdue\" still continued to lie forgotten on the table.  Every\nmanuscript that he had had out now lay under the table.  Only one\nmanuscript he kept going, and that was Brissenden's \"Ephemera.\"  His\nbicycle and black suit were again in pawn, and the type-writer people\nwere once more worrying about the rent.  But such things no longer\nbothered him.  He was seeking a new orientation, and until that was found\nhis life must stand still.\n\nAfter several weeks, what he had been waiting for happened.  He met Ruth\non the street.  It was true, she was accompanied by her brother, Norman,\nand it was true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted\nto wave him aside.\n\n\"If you interfere with my sister, I'll call an officer,\" Norman\nthreatened.  \"She does not wish to speak with you, and your insistence is\ninsult.\"\n\n\"If you persist, you'll have to call that officer, and then you'll get\nyour name in the papers,\" Martin answered grimly.  \"And now, get out of\nmy way and get the officer if you want to.  I'm going to talk with Ruth.\"\n\n\"I want to have it from your own lips,\" he said to her.\n\nShe was pale and trembling, but she held up and looked inquiringly.\n\n\"The question I asked in my letter,\" he prompted.\n\nNorman made an impatient movement, but Martin checked him with a swift\nlook.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Is all this of your own free will?\" he demanded.\n\n\"It is.\"  She spoke in a low, firm voice and with deliberation.  \"It is\nof my own free will.  You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet\nmy friends.  They are all talking about me, I know.  That is all I can\ntell you.  You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Friends!  Gossip!  Newspaper misreports!  Surely such things are not\nstronger than love!  I can only believe that you never loved me.\"\n\nA blush drove the pallor from her face.\n\n\"After what has passed?\" she said faintly.  \"Martin, you do not know what\nyou are saying.  I am not common.\"\n\n\"You see, she doesn't want to have anything to do with you,\" Norman\nblurted out, starting on with her.\n\nMartin stood aside and let them pass, fumbling unconsciously in his coat\npocket for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there.\n\nIt was a long walk to North Oakland, but it was not until he went up the\nsteps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it.  He found\nhimself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him like an\nawakened somnambulist.  He noticed \"Overdue\" lying on the table and drew\nup his chair and reached for his pen.  There was in his nature a logical\ncompulsion toward completeness.  Here was something undone.  It had been\ndeferred against the completion of something else.  Now that something\nelse had been finished, and he would apply himself to this task until it\nwas finished.  What he would do next he did not know.  All that he did\nknow was that a climacteric in his life had been attained.  A period had\nbeen reached, and he was rounding it off in workman-like fashion.  He was\nnot curious about the future.  He would soon enough find out what it held\nin store for him.  Whatever it was, it did not matter.  Nothing seemed to\nmatter.\n\nFor five days he toiled on at \"Overdue,\" going nowhere, seeing nobody,\nand eating meagrely.  On the morning of the sixth day the postman brought\nhim a thin letter from the editor of The Parthenon.  A glance told him\nthat \"Ephemera\" was accepted.  \"We have submitted the poem to Mr.\nCartwright Bruce,\" the editor went on to say, \"and he has reported so\nfavorably upon it that we cannot let it go.  As an earnest of our\npleasure in publishing the poem, let me tell you that we have set it for\nthe August number, our July number being already made up.  Kindly extend\nour pleasure and our thanks to Mr. Brissenden.  Please send by return\nmail his photograph and biographical data.  If our honorarium is\nunsatisfactory, kindly telegraph us at once and state what you consider a\nfair price.\"\n\nSince the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty\ndollars, Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph.  Then, too,\nthere was Brissenden's consent to be gained.  Well, he had been right,\nafter all.  Here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he saw\nit.  And the price was splendid, even though it was for the poem of a\ncentury.  As for Cartwright Bruce, Martin knew that he was the one critic\nfor whose opinions Brissenden had any respect.\n\nMartin rode down town on an electric car, and as he watched the houses\nand cross-streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not\nmore elated over his friend's success and over his own signal victory.\nThe one critic in the United States had pronounced favorably on the poem,\nwhile his own contention that good stuff could find its way into the\nmagazines had proved correct.  But enthusiasm had lost its spring in him,\nand he found that he was more anxious to see Brissenden than he was to\ncarry the good news.  The acceptance of The Parthenon had recalled to him\nthat during his five days' devotion to \"Overdue\" he had not heard from\nBrissenden nor even thought about him.  For the first time Martin\nrealized the daze he had been in, and he felt shame for having forgotten\nhis friend.  But even the shame did not burn very sharply.  He was numb\nto emotions of any sort save the artistic ones concerned in the writing\nof \"Overdue.\"  So far as other affairs were concerned, he had been in a\ntrance.  For that matter, he was still in a trance.  All this life\nthrough which the electric car whirred seemed remote and unreal, and he\nwould have experienced little interest and less shock if the great stone\nsteeple of the church he passed had suddenly crumbled to mortar-dust upon\nhis head.\n\nAt the hotel he hurried up to Brissenden's room, and hurried down again.\nThe room was empty.  All luggage was gone.\n\n\"Did Mr. Brissenden leave any address?\" he asked the clerk, who looked at\nhim curiously for a moment.\n\n\"Haven't you heard?\" he asked.\n\nMartin shook his head.\n\n\"Why, the papers were full of it.  He was found dead in bed.  Suicide.\nShot himself through the head.\"\n\n\"Is he buried yet?\" Martin seemed to hear his voice, like some one else's\nvoice, from a long way off, asking the question.\n\n\"No.  The body was shipped East after the inquest.  Lawyers engaged by\nhis people saw to the arrangements.\"\n\n\"They were quick about it, I must say,\" Martin commented.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.  It happened five days ago.\"\n\n\"Five days ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, five days ago.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Martin said as he turned and went out.\n\nAt the corner he stepped into the Western Union and sent a telegram to\nThe Parthenon, advising them to proceed with the publication of the poem.\nHe had in his pocket but five cents with which to pay his carfare home,\nso he sent the message collect.\n\nOnce in his room, he resumed his writing.  The days and nights came and\nwent, and he sat at his table and wrote on.  He went nowhere, save to the\npawnbroker, took no exercise, and ate methodically when he was hungry and\nhad something to cook, and just as methodically went without when he had\nnothing to cook.  Composed as the story was, in advance, chapter by\nchapter, he nevertheless saw and developed an opening that increased the\npower of it, though it necessitated twenty thousand additional words.  It\nwas not that there was any vital need that the thing should be well done,\nbut that his artistic canons compelled him to do it well.  He worked on\nin the daze, strangely detached from the world around him, feeling like a\nfamiliar ghost among these literary trappings of his former life.  He\nremembered that some one had said that a ghost was the spirit of a man\nwho was dead and who did not have sense enough to know it; and he paused\nfor the moment to wonder if he were really dead and unaware of it.\n\nCame the day when \"Overdue\" was finished.  The agent of the type-writer\nfirm had come for the machine, and he sat on the bed while Martin, on the\none chair, typed the last pages of the final chapter.  \"Finis,\" he wrote,\nin capitals, at the end, and to him it was indeed finis.  He watched the\ntype-writer carried out the door with a feeling of relief, then went over\nand lay down on the bed.  He was faint from hunger.  Food had not passed\nhis lips in thirty-six hours, but he did not think about it.  He lay on\nhis back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all, while the daze or\nstupor slowly welled up, saturating his consciousness.  Half in delirium,\nhe began muttering aloud the lines of an anonymous poem Brissenden had\nbeen fond of quoting to him.  Maria, listening anxiously outside his\ndoor, was perturbed by his monotonous utterance.  The words in themselves\nwere not significant to her, but the fact that he was saying them was.  \"I\nhave done,\" was the burden of the poem.\n\n   \"'I have done--\n   Put by the lute.\n   Song and singing soon are over\n   As the airy shades that hover\n   In among the purple clover.\n   I have done--\n   Put by the lute.\n   Once I sang as early thrushes\n   Sing among the dewy bushes;\n   Now I'm mute.\n   I am like a weary linnet,\n   For my throat has no song in it;\n   I have had my singing minute.\n   I have done.\n   Put by the lute.'\"\n\nMaria could stand it no longer, and hurried away to the stove, where she\nfilled a quart-bowl with soup, putting into it the lion's share of\nchopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of\nthe pot.  Martin roused himself and sat up and began to eat, between\nspoonfuls reassuring Maria that he had not been talking in his sleep and\nthat he did not have any fever.\n\nAfter she left him he sat drearily, with drooping shoulders, on the edge\nof the bed, gazing about him with lack-lustre eyes that saw nothing until\nthe torn wrapper of a magazine, which had come in the morning's mail and\nwhich lay unopened, shot a gleam of light into his darkened brain.  It is\nThe Parthenon, he thought, the August Parthenon, and it must contain\n\"Ephemera.\"  If only Brissenden were here to see!\n\nHe was turning the pages of the magazine, when suddenly he stopped.\n\"Ephemera\" had been featured, with gorgeous head-piece and Beardsley-like\nmargin decorations.  On one side of the head-piece was Brissenden's\nphotograph, on the other side was the photograph of Sir John Value, the\nBritish Ambassador.  A preliminary editorial note quoted Sir John Value\nas saying that there were no poets in America, and the publication of\n\"Ephemera\" was The Parthenon's.  \"There, take that, Sir John Value!\"\nCartwright Bruce was described as the greatest critic in America, and he\nwas quoted as saying that \"Ephemera\" was the greatest poem ever written\nin America.  And finally, the editor's foreword ended with: \"We have not\nyet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of \"Ephemera\"; perhaps we\nshall never be able to do so.  But we have read it often, wondering at\nthe words and their arrangement, wondering where Mr. Brissenden got them,\nand how he could fasten them together.\"  Then followed the poem.\n\n\"Pretty good thing you died, Briss, old man,\" Martin murmured, letting\nthe magazine slip between his knees to the floor.\n\nThe cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating, and Martin noted\napathetically that he was not nauseated very much.  He wished he could\nget angry, but did not have energy enough to try.  He was too numb.  His\nblood was too congealed to accelerate to the swift tidal flow of\nindignation.  After all, what did it matter?  It was on a par with all\nthe rest that Brissenden had condemned in bourgeois society.\n\n\"Poor Briss,\" Martin communed; \"he would never have forgiven me.\"\n\nRousing himself with an effort, he possessed himself of a box which had\nonce contained type-writer paper.  Going through its contents, he drew\nforth eleven poems which his friend had written.  These he tore\nlengthwise and crosswise and dropped into the waste basket.  He did it\nlanguidly, and, when he had finished, sat on the edge of the bed staring\nblankly before him.\n\nHow long he sat there he did not know, until, suddenly, across his\nsightless vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white.  It was\ncurious.  But as he watched it grow in definiteness he saw that it was a\ncoral reef smoking in the white Pacific surges.  Next, in the line of\nbreakers he made out a small canoe, an outrigger canoe.  In the stern he\nsaw a young bronzed god in scarlet hip-cloth dipping a flashing paddle.\nHe recognized him.  He was Moti, the youngest son of Tati, the chief, and\nthis was Tahiti, and beyond that smoking reef lay the sweet land of\nPapara and the chief's grass house by the river's mouth.  It was the end\nof the day, and Moti was coming home from the fishing.  He was waiting\nfor the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef.  Then he saw\nhimself, sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the past,\ndipping a paddle that waited Moti's word to dig in like mad when the\nturquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them.  Next, he was no\nlonger an onlooker but was himself in the canoe, Moti was crying out,\nthey were both thrusting hard with their paddles, racing on the steep\nface of the flying turquoise.  Under the bow the water was hissing as\nfrom a steam jet, the air was filled with driven spray, there was a rush\nand rumble and long-echoing roar, and the canoe floated on the placid\nwater of the lagoon.  Moti laughed and shook the salt water from his\neyes, and together they paddled in to the pounded-coral beach where\nTati's grass walls through the cocoanut-palms showed golden in the\nsetting sun.\n\nThe picture faded, and before his eyes stretched the disorder of his\nsqualid room.  He strove in vain to see Tahiti again.  He knew there was\nsinging among the trees and that the maidens were dancing in the\nmoonlight, but he could not see them.  He could see only the littered\nwriting-table, the empty space where the type-writer had stood, and the\nunwashed window-pane.  He closed his eyes with a groan, and slept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\nHe slept heavily all night, and did not stir until aroused by the postman\non his morning round.  Martin felt tired and passive, and went through\nhis letters aimlessly.  One thin envelope, from a robber magazine,\ncontained for twenty-two dollars.  He had been dunning for it for a year\nand a half.  He noted its amount apathetically.  The old-time thrill at\nreceiving a publisher's check was gone.  Unlike his earlier checks, this\none was not pregnant with promise of great things to come.  To him it was\na check for twenty-two dollars, that was all, and it would buy him\nsomething to eat.\n\nAnother check was in the same mail, sent from a New York weekly in\npayment for some humorous verse which had been accepted months before.  It\nwas for ten dollars.  An idea came to him, which he calmly considered.  He\ndid not know what he was going to do, and he felt in no hurry to do\nanything.  In the meantime he must live.  Also he owed numerous debts.\nWould it not be a paying investment to put stamps on the huge pile of\nmanuscripts under the table and start them on their travels again?  One\nor two of them might be accepted.  That would help him to live.  He\ndecided on the investment, and, after he had cashed the checks at the\nbank down in Oakland, he bought ten dollars' worth of postage stamps.  The\nthought of going home to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was\nrepulsive to him.  For the first time he refused to consider his debts.\nHe knew that in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at\na cost of from fifteen to twenty cents.  But, instead, he went into the\nForum Cafe and ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars.  He tipped the\nwaiter a quarter, and spent fifty cents for a package of Egyptian\ncigarettes.  It was the first time he had smoked since Ruth had asked him\nto stop.  But he could see now no reason why he should not, and besides,\nhe wanted to smoke.  And what did the money matter?  For five cents he\ncould have bought a package of Durham and brown papers and rolled forty\ncigarettes--but what of it?  Money had no meaning to him now except what\nit would immediately buy.  He was chartless and rudderless, and he had no\nport to make, while drifting involved the least living, and it was living\nthat hurt.\n\nThe days slipped along, and he slept eight hours regularly every night.\nThough now, while waiting for more checks, he ate in the Japanese\nrestaurants where meals were served for ten cents, his wasted body filled\nout, as did the hollows in his cheeks.  He no longer abused himself with\nshort sleep, overwork, and overstudy.  He wrote nothing, and the books\nwere closed.  He walked much, out in the hills, and loafed long hours in\nthe quiet parks.  He had no friends nor acquaintances, nor did he make\nany.  He had no inclination.  He was waiting for some impulse, from he\nknew not where, to put his stopped life into motion again.  In the\nmeantime his life remained run down, planless, and empty and idle.\n\nOnce he made a trip to San Francisco to look up the \"real dirt.\"  But at\nthe last moment, as he stepped into the upstairs entrance, he recoiled\nand turned and fled through the swarming ghetto.  He was frightened at\nthe thought of hearing philosophy discussed, and he fled furtively, for\nfear that some one of the \"real dirt\" might chance along and recognize\nhim.\n\nSometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how\n\"Ephemera\" was being maltreated.  It had made a hit.  But what a hit!\nEverybody had read it, and everybody was discussing whether or not it was\nreally poetry.  The local papers had taken it up, and daily there\nappeared columns of learned criticisms, facetious editorials, and serious\nletters from subscribers.  Helen Della Delmar (proclaimed with a flourish\nof trumpets and rolling of tomtoms to be the greatest woman poet in the\nUnited States) denied Brissenden a seat beside her on Pegasus and wrote\nvoluminous letters to the public, proving that he was no poet.\n\nThe Parthenon came out in its next number patting itself on the back for\nthe stir it had made, sneering at Sir John Value, and exploiting\nBrissenden's death with ruthless commercialism.  A newspaper with a sworn\ncirculation of half a million published an original and spontaneous poem\nby Helen Della Delmar, in which she gibed and sneered at Brissenden.\nAlso, she was guilty of a second poem, in which she parodied him.\n\nMartin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead.  He had hated\nthe crowd so, and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had\nbeen thrown to the crowd.  Daily the vivisection of Beauty went on.  Every\nnincompoop in the land rushed into free print, floating their wizened\nlittle egos into the public eye on the surge of Brissenden's greatness.\nQuoth one paper: \"We have received a letter from a gentleman who wrote a\npoem just like it, only better, some time ago.\"  Another paper, in deadly\nseriousness, reproving Helen Della Delmar for her parody, said: \"But\nunquestionably Miss Delmar wrote it in a moment of badinage and not quite\nwith the respect that one great poet should show to another and perhaps\nto the greatest.  However, whether Miss Delmar be jealous or not of the\nman who invented 'Ephemera,' it is certain that she, like thousands of\nothers, is fascinated by his work, and that the day may come when she\nwill try to write lines like his.\"\n\nMinisters began to preach sermons against \"Ephemera,\" and one, who too\nstoutly stood for much of its content, was expelled for heresy.  The\ngreat poem contributed to the gayety of the world.  The comic\nverse-writers and the cartoonists took hold of it with screaming\nlaughter, and in the personal columns of society weeklies jokes were\nperpetrated on it to the effect that Charley Frensham told Archie\nJennings, in confidence, that five lines of \"Ephemera\" would drive a man\nto beat a cripple, and that ten lines would send him to the bottom of the\nriver.\n\nMartin did not laugh; nor did he grit his teeth in anger.  The effect\nproduced upon him was one of great sadness.  In the crash of his whole\nworld, with love on the pinnacle, the crash of magazinedom and the dear\npublic was a small crash indeed.  Brissenden had been wholly right in his\njudgment of the magazines, and he, Martin, had spent arduous and futile\nyears in order to find it out for himself.  The magazines were all\nBrissenden had said they were and more.  Well, he was done, he solaced\nhimself.  He had hitched his wagon to a star and been landed in a\npestiferous marsh.  The visions of Tahiti--clean, sweet Tahiti--were\ncoming to him more frequently.  And there were the low Paumotus, and the\nhigh Marquesas; he saw himself often, now, on board trading schooners or\nfrail little cutters, slipping out at dawn through the reef at Papeete\nand beginning the long beat through the pearl-atolls to Nukahiva and the\nBay of Taiohae, where Tamari, he knew, would kill a pig in honor of his\ncoming, and where Tamari's flower-garlanded daughters would seize his\nhands and with song and laughter garland him with flowers.  The South\nSeas were calling, and he knew that sooner or later he would answer the\ncall.\n\nIn the meantime he drifted, resting and recuperating after the long\ntraverse he had made through the realm of knowledge.  When The Parthenon\ncheck of three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded to him, he turned\nit over to the local lawyer who had attended to Brissenden's affairs for\nhis family.  Martin took a receipt for the check, and at the same time\ngave a note for the hundred dollars Brissenden had let him have.\n\nThe time was not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese\nrestaurants.  At the very moment when he had abandoned the fight, the\ntide turned.  But it had turned too late.  Without a thrill he opened a\nthick envelope from The Millennium, scanned the face of a check that\nrepresented three hundred dollars, and noted that it was the payment on\nacceptance for \"Adventure.\"  Every debt he owed in the world, including\nthe pawnshop, with its usurious interest, amounted to less than a hundred\ndollars.  And when he had paid everything, and lifted the hundred-dollar\nnote with Brissenden's lawyer, he still had over a hundred dollars in\npocket.  He ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals\nin the best cafes in town.  He still slept in his little room at Maria's,\nbut the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to\ncease from calling him \"hobo\" and \"tramp\" from the roofs of woodsheds and\nover back fences.\n\n\"Wiki-Wiki,\" his Hawaiian short story, was bought by Warren's Monthly for\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars.  The Northern Review took his essay, \"The\nCradle of Beauty,\" and Mackintosh's Magazine took \"The Palmist\"--the poem\nhe had written to Marian.  The editors and readers were back from their\nsummer vacations, and manuscripts were being handled quickly.  But Martin\ncould not puzzle out what strange whim animated them to this general\nacceptance of the things they had persistently rejected for two years.\nNothing of his had been published.  He was not known anywhere outside of\nOakland, and in Oakland, with the few who thought they knew him, he was\nnotorious as a red-shirt and a socialist.  So there was no explaining\nthis sudden acceptability of his wares.  It was sheer jugglery of fate.\n\nAfter it had been refused by a number of magazines, he had taken\nBrissenden's rejected advice and started, \"The Shame of the Sun\" on the\nround of publishers.  After several refusals, Singletree, Darnley & Co.\naccepted it, promising fall publication.  When Martin asked for an\nadvance on royalties, they wrote that such was not their custom, that\nbooks of that nature rarely paid for themselves, and that they doubted if\nhis book would sell a thousand copies.  Martin figured what the book\nwould earn him on such a sale.  Retailed at a dollar, on a royalty of\nfifteen per cent, it would bring him one hundred and fifty dollars.  He\ndecided that if he had it to do over again he would confine himself to\nfiction.  \"Adventure,\" one-fourth as long, had brought him twice as much\nfrom The Millennium.  That newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago\nhad been true, after all.  The first-class magazines did not pay on\nacceptance, and they paid well.  Not two cents a word, but four cents a\nword, had The Millennium paid him.  And, furthermore, they bought good\nstuff, too, for were they not buying his?  This last thought he\naccompanied with a grin.\n\nHe wrote to Singletree, Darnley & Co., offering to sell out his rights in\n\"The Shame of the Sun\" for a hundred dollars, but they did not care to\ntake the risk.  In the meantime he was not in need of money, for several\nof his later stories had been accepted and paid for.  He actually opened\na bank account, where, without a debt in the world, he had several\nhundred dollars to his credit.  \"Overdue,\" after having been declined by\na number of magazines, came to rest at the Meredith-Lowell Company.\nMartin remembered the five dollars Gertrude had given him, and his\nresolve to return it to her a hundred times over; so he wrote for an\nadvance on royalties of five hundred dollars.  To his surprise a check\nfor that amount, accompanied by a contract, came by return mail.  He\ncashed the check into five-dollar gold pieces and telephoned Gertrude\nthat he wanted to see her.\n\nShe arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she\nhad made.  Apprehensive of trouble, she had stuffed the few dollars she\npossessed into her hand-satchel; and so sure was she that disaster had\novertaken her brother, that she stumbled forward, sobbing, into his arms,\nat the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him.\n\n\"I'd have come myself,\" he said.  \"But I didn't want a row with Mr.\nHigginbotham, and that is what would have surely happened.\"\n\n\"He'll be all right after a time,\" she assured him, while she wondered\nwhat the trouble was that Martin was in.  \"But you'd best get a job first\nan' steady down.  Bernard does like to see a man at honest work.  That\nstuff in the newspapers broke 'm all up.  I never saw 'm so mad before.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to get a job,\" Martin said with a smile.  \"And you can\ntell him so from me.  I don't need a job, and there's the proof of it.\"\n\nHe emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting, tinkling\nstream.\n\n\"You remember that fiver you gave me the time I didn't have carfare?\nWell, there it is, with ninety-nine brothers of different ages but all of\nthe same size.\"\n\nIf Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived, she was now in a panic\nof fear.  Her fear was such that it was certitude.  She was not\nsuspicious.  She was convinced.  She looked at Martin in horror, and her\nheavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning her.\n\n\"It's yours,\" he laughed.\n\nShe burst into tears, and began to moan, \"My poor boy, my poor boy!\"\n\nHe was puzzled for a moment.  Then he divined the cause of her agitation\nand handed her the Meredith-Lowell letter which had accompanied the\ncheck.  She stumbled through it, pausing now and again to wipe her eyes,\nand when she had finished, said:-\n\n\"An' does it mean that you come by the money honestly?\"\n\n\"More honestly than if I'd won it in a lottery.  I earned it.\"\n\nSlowly faith came back to her, and she reread the letter carefully.  It\ntook him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had\nput the money into his possession, and longer still to get her to\nunderstand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it.\n\n\"I'll put it in the bank for you,\" she said finally.\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort.  It's yours, to do with as you please,\nand if you won't take it, I'll give it to Maria.  She'll know what to do\nwith it.  I'd suggest, though, that you hire a servant and take a good\nlong rest.\"\n\n\"I'm goin' to tell Bernard all about it,\" she announced, when she was\nleaving.\n\nMartin winced, then grinned.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" he said.  \"And then, maybe, he'll invite me to dinner again.\"\n\n\"Yes, he will--I'm sure he will!\" she exclaimed fervently, as she drew\nhim to her and kissed and hugged him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n\nOne day Martin became aware that he was lonely.  He was healthy and\nstrong, and had nothing to do.  The cessation from writing and studying,\nthe death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big\nhole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down to good living\nin cafes and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes.  It was true the South\nSeas were calling to him, but he had a feeling that the game was not yet\nplayed out in the United States.  Two books were soon to be published,\nand he had more books that might find publication.  Money could be made\nout of them, and he would wait and take a sackful of it into the South\nSeas.  He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that he could buy for\na thousand Chili dollars.  The valley ran from the horseshoe, land-locked\nbay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks and contained perhaps\nten thousand acres.  It was filled with tropical fruits, wild chickens,\nand wild pigs, with an occasional herd of wild cattle, while high up\namong the peaks were herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs.\nThe whole place was wild.  Not a human lived in it. And he could buy it\nand the bay for a thousand Chili dollars.\n\nThe bay, as he remembered it, was magnificent, with water deep enough to\naccommodate the largest vessel afloat, and so safe that the South Pacific\nDirectory recommended it to the best careening place for ships for\nhundreds of miles around.  He would buy a schooner--one of those yacht-\nlike, coppered crafts that sailed like witches--and go trading copra and\npearling among the islands.  He would make the valley and the bay his\nheadquarters.  He would build a patriarchal grass house like Tati's, and\nhave it and the valley and the schooner filled with dark-skinned\nservitors.  He would entertain there the factor of Taiohae, captains of\nwandering traders, and all the best of the South Pacific riffraff.  He\nwould keep open house and entertain like a prince.  And he would forget\nthe books he had opened and the world that had proved an illusion.\n\nTo do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money.\nAlready it was beginning to flow in.  If one of the books made a strike,\nit might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts.  Also he could\ncollect the stories and the poems into books, and make sure of the valley\nand the bay and the schooner.  He would never write again.  Upon that he\nwas resolved.  But in the meantime, awaiting the publication of the\nbooks, he must do something more than live dazed and stupid in the sort\nof uncaring trance into which he had fallen.\n\nHe noted, one Sunday morning, that the Bricklayers' Picnic took place\nthat day at Shell Mound Park, and to Shell Mound Park he went.  He had\nbeen to the working-class picnics too often in his earlier life not to\nknow what they were like, and as he entered the park he experienced a\nrecrudescence of all the old sensations.  After all, they were his kind,\nthese working people.  He had been born among them, he had lived among\nthem, and though he had strayed for a time, it was well to come back\namong them.\n\n\"If it ain't Mart!\" he heard some one say, and the next moment a hearty\nhand was on his shoulder.  \"Where you ben all the time?  Off to sea?  Come\non an' have a drink.\"\n\nIt was the old crowd in which he found himself--the old crowd, with here\nand there a gap, and here and there a new face.  The fellows were not\nbricklayers, but, as in the old days, they attended all Sunday picnics\nfor the dancing, and the fighting, and the fun.  Martin drank with them,\nand began to feel really human once more.  He was a fool to have ever\nleft them, he thought; and he was very certain that his sum of happiness\nwould have been greater had he remained with them and let alone the books\nand the people who sat in the high places.  Yet the beer seemed not so\ngood as of yore.  It didn't taste as it used to taste.  Brissenden had\nspoiled him for steam beer, he concluded, and wondered if, after all, the\nbooks had spoiled him for companionship with these friends of his youth.\nHe resolved that he would not be so spoiled, and he went on to the\ndancing pavilion.  Jimmy, the plumber, he met there, in the company of a\ntall, blond girl who promptly forsook him for Martin.\n\n\"Gee, it's like old times,\" Jimmy explained to the gang that gave him the\nlaugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz.  \"An' I don't\ngive a rap.  I'm too damned glad to see 'm back.  Watch 'm waltz, eh?\nIt's like silk.  Who'd blame any girl?\"\n\nBut Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy, and the three of them, with half\na dozen friends, watched the revolving couples and laughed and joked with\none another.  Everybody was glad to see Martin back.  No book of his been\npublished; he carried no fictitious value in their eyes.  They liked him\nfor himself.  He felt like a prince returned from excile, and his lonely\nheart burgeoned in the geniality in which it bathed.  He made a mad day\nof it, and was at his best.  Also, he had money in his pockets, and, as\nin the old days when he returned from sea with a pay-day, he made the\nmoney fly.\n\nOnce, on the dancing-floor, he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms of a\nyoung workingman; and, later, when he made the round of the pavilion, he\ncame upon her sitting by a refreshment table.  Surprise and greetings\nover, he led her away into the grounds, where they could talk without\nshouting down the music.  From the instant he spoke to her, she was his.\nHe knew it.  She showed it in the proud humility of her eyes, in every\ncaressing movement of her proudly carried body, and in the way she hung\nupon his speech.  She was not the young girl as he had known her.  She\nwas a woman, now, and Martin noted that her wild, defiant beauty had\nimproved, losing none of its wildness, while the defiance and the fire\nseemed more in control.  \"A beauty, a perfect beauty,\" he murmured\nadmiringly under his breath.  And he knew she was his, that all he had to\ndo was to say \"Come,\" and she would go with him over the world wherever\nhe led.\n\nEven as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow on\nthe side of his head that nearly knocked him down.  It was a man's fist,\ndirected by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had missed the\njaw for which it was aimed.  Martin turned as he staggered, and saw the\nfist coming at him in a wild swing.  Quite as a matter of course he\nducked, and the fist flew harmlessly past, pivoting the man who had\ndriven it.  Martin hooked with his left, landing on the pivoting man with\nthe weight of his body behind the blow.  The man went to the ground\nsidewise, leaped to his feet, and made a mad rush.  Martin saw his\npassion-distorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the\nfellow's anger.  But while he wondered, he shot in a straight left, the\nweight of his body behind the blow.  The man went over backward and fell\nin a crumpled heap.  Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward\nthem.\n\nMartin was thrilling all over.  This was the old days with a vengeance,\nwith their dancing, and their fighting, and their fun.  While he kept a\nwary eye on his antagonist, he glanced at Lizzie.  Usually the girls\nscreamed when the fellows got to scrapping, but she had not screamed.  She\nwas looking on with bated breath, leaning slightly forward, so keen was\nher interest, one hand pressed to her breast, her cheek flushed, and in\nher eyes a great and amazed admiration.\n\nThe man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the restraining\narms that were laid on him.\n\n\"She was waitin' for me to come back!\" he was proclaiming to all and\nsundry.  \"She was waitin' for me to come back, an' then that fresh guy\ncomes buttin' in.  Let go o' me, I tell yeh.  I'm goin' to fix 'm.\"\n\n\"What's eatin' yer?\" Jimmy was demanding, as he helped hold the young\nfellow back.  \"That guy's Mart Eden.  He's nifty with his mits, lemme\ntell you that, an' he'll eat you alive if you monkey with 'm.\"\n\n\"He can't steal her on me that way,\" the other interjected.\n\n\"He licked the Flyin' Dutchman, an' you know _him_,\" Jimmy went on\nexpostulating.  \"An' he did it in five rounds.  You couldn't last a\nminute against him.  See?\"\n\nThis information seemed to have a mollifying effect, and the irate young\nman favored Martin with a measuring stare.\n\n\"He don't look it,\" he sneered; but the sneer was without passion.\n\n\"That's what the Flyin' Dutchman thought,\" Jimmy assured him.  \"Come on,\nnow, let's get outa this.  There's lots of other girls.  Come on.\"\n\nThe young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion, and\nthe gang followed after him.\n\n\"Who is he?\" Martin asked Lizzie.  \"And what's it all about, anyway?\"\n\nAlready the zest of combat, which of old had been so keen and lasting,\nhad died down, and he discovered that he was self-analytical, too much so\nto live, single heart and single hand, so primitive an existence.\n\nLizzie tossed her head.\n\n\"Oh, he's nobody,\" she said.  \"He's just ben keepin' company with me.\"\n\n\"I had to, you see,\" she explained after a pause.  \"I was gettin' pretty\nlonesome.  But I never forgot.\"  Her voice sank lower, and she looked\nstraight before her.  \"I'd throw 'm down for you any time.\"\n\nMartin looking at her averted face, knowing that all he had to do was to\nreach out his hand and pluck her, fell to pondering whether, after all,\nthere was any real worth in refined, grammatical English, and, so, forgot\nto reply to her.\n\n\"You put it all over him,\" she said tentatively, with a laugh.\n\n\"He's a husky young fellow, though,\" he admitted generously.  \"If they\nhadn't taken him away, he might have given me my hands full.\"\n\n\"Who was that lady friend I seen you with that night?\" she asked\nabruptly.\n\n\"Oh, just a lady friend,\" was his answer.\n\n\"It was a long time ago,\" she murmured contemplatively.  \"It seems like a\nthousand years.\"\n\nBut Martin went no further into the matter.  He led the conversation off\ninto other channels.  They had lunch in the restaurant, where he ordered\nwine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with\nno one but her, till she was tired.  He was a good dancer, and she\nwhirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight, her head\nagainst his shoulder, wishing that it could last forever.  Later in the\nafternoon they strayed off among the trees, where, in the good old\nfashion, she sat down while he sprawled on his back, his head in her lap.\nHe lay and dozed, while she fondled his hair, looked down on his closed\neyes, and loved him without reserve.  Looking up suddenly, he read the\ntender advertisement in her face.  Her eyes fluttered down, then they\nopened and looked into his with soft defiance.\n\n\"I've kept straight all these years,\" she said, her voice so low that it\nwas almost a whisper.\n\nIn his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth.  And at his\nheart pleaded a great temptation.  It was in his power to make her happy.\nDenied happiness himself, why should he deny happiness to her?  He could\nmarry her and take her down with him to dwell in the grass-walled castle\nin the Marquesas.  The desire to do it was strong, but stronger still was\nthe imperative command of his nature not to do it.  In spite of himself\nhe was still faithful to Love.  The old days of license and easy living\nwere gone.  He could not bring them back, nor could he go back to them.\nHe was changed--how changed he had not realized until now.\n\n\"I am not a marrying man, Lizzie,\" he said lightly.\n\nThe hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly, then went on with the\nsame gentle stroke.  He noticed her face harden, but it was with the\nhardness of resolution, for still the soft color was in her cheeks and\nshe was all glowing and melting.\n\n\"I did not mean that--\" she began, then faltered.  \"Or anyway I don't\ncare.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" she repeated.  \"I'm proud to be your friend.  I'd do\nanything for you.  I'm made that way, I guess.\"\n\nMartin sat up.  He took her hand in his.  He did it deliberately, with\nwarmth but without passion; and such warmth chilled her.\n\n\"Don't let's talk about it,\" she said.\n\n\"You are a great and noble woman,\" he said.  \"And it is I who should be\nproud to know you.  And I am, I am.  You are a ray of light to me in a\nvery dark world, and I've got to be straight with you, just as straight\nas you have been.\"\n\n\"I don't care whether you're straight with me or not.  You could do\nanything with me.  You could throw me in the dirt an' walk on me.  An'\nyou're the only man in the world that can,\" she added with a defiant\nflash.  \"I ain't taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for\nnothin'.\"\n\n\"And it's just because of that that I'm not going to,\" he said gently.\n\"You are so big and generous that you challenge me to equal generousness.\nI'm not marrying, and I'm not--well, loving without marrying, though I've\ndone my share of that in the past.  I'm sorry I came here to-day and met\nyou.  But it can't be helped now, and I never expected it would turn out\nthis way.\"\n\n\"But look here, Lizzie.  I can't begin to tell you how much I like you.  I\ndo more than like you.  I admire and respect you.  You are magnificent,\nand you are magnificently good.  But what's the use of words?  Yet\nthere's something I'd like to do.  You've had a hard life; let me make it\neasy for you.\"  (A joyous light welled into her eyes, then faded out\nagain.)  \"I'm pretty sure of getting hold of some money soon--lots of\nit.\"\n\nIn that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay, the grass-\nwalled castle and the trim, white schooner.  After all, what did it\nmatter?  He could go away, as he had done so often, before the mast, on\nany ship bound anywhere.\n\n\"I'd like to turn it over to you.  There must be something you want--to\ngo to school or business college.  You might like to study and be a\nstenographer.  I could fix it for you.  Or maybe your father and mother\nare living--I could set them up in a grocery store or something.  Anything\nyou want, just name it, and I can fix it for you.\"\n\nShe made no reply, but sat, gazing straight before her, dry-eyed and\nmotionless, but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined so\nstrongly that it made his own throat ache.  He regretted that he had\nspoken.  It seemed so tawdry what he had offered her--mere money--compared\nwith what she offered him.  He offered her an extraneous thing with which\nhe could part without a pang, while she offered him herself, along with\ndisgrace and shame, and sin, and all her hopes of heaven.\n\n\"Don't let's talk about it,\" she said with a catch in her voice that she\nchanged to a cough.  She stood up.  \"Come on, let's go home.  I'm all\ntired out.\"\n\nThe day was done, and the merrymakers had nearly all departed.  But as\nMartin and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting for\nthem.  Martin knew immediately the meaning of it.  Trouble was brewing.\nThe gang was his body-guard.  They passed out through the gates of the\npark with, straggling in the rear, a second gang, the friends that\nLizzie's young man had collected to avenge the loss of his lady.  Several\nconstables and special police officers, anticipating trouble, trailed\nalong to prevent it, and herded the two gangs separately aboard the train\nfor San Francisco.  Martin told Jimmy that he would get off at Sixteenth\nStreet Station and catch the electric car into Oakland.  Lizzie was very\nquiet and without interest in what was impending.  The train pulled in to\nSixteenth Street Station, and the waiting electric car could be seen, the\nconductor of which was impatiently clanging the gong.\n\n\"There she is,\" Jimmy counselled.  \"Make a run for it, an' we'll hold 'em\nback.  Now you go!  Hit her up!\"\n\nThe hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre, then it\ndashed from the train in pursuit.  The staid and sober Oakland folk who\nsat upon the car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl who ran for\nit and found a seat in front on the outside.  They did not connect the\ncouple with Jimmy, who sprang on the steps, crying to the motorman:-\n\n\"Slam on the juice, old man, and beat it outa here!\"\n\nThe next moment Jimmy whirled about, and the passengers saw him land his\nfist on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car.  But\nfists were landing on faces the whole length of the car.  Thus, Jimmy and\nhis gang, strung out on the long, lower steps, met the attacking gang.\nThe car started with a great clanging of its gong, and, as Jimmy's gang\ndrove off the last assailants, they, too, jumped off to finish the job.\nThe car dashed on, leaving the flurry of combat far behind, and its\ndumfounded passengers never dreamed that the quiet young man and the\npretty working-girl sitting in the corner on the outside seat had been\nthe cause of the row.\n\nMartin had enjoyed the fight, with a recrudescence of the old fighting\nthrills.  But they quickly died away, and he was oppressed by a great\nsadness.  He felt very old--centuries older than those careless, care-\nfree young companions of his others days.  He had travelled far, too far\nto go back.  Their mode of life, which had once been his, was now\ndistasteful to him.  He was disappointed in it all.  He had developed\ninto an alien.  As the steam beer had tasted raw, so their companionship\nseemed raw to him.  He was too far removed.  Too many thousands of opened\nbooks yawned between them and him.  He had exiled himself.  He had\ntravelled in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer return\nhome.  On the other hand, he was human, and his gregarious need for\ncompanionship remained unsatisfied.  He had found no new home.  As the\ngang could not understand him, as his own family could not understand\nhim, as the bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this girl beside\nhim, whom he honored high, could not understand him nor the honor he paid\nher.  His sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he thought it\nover.\n\n\"Make it up with him,\" he advised Lizzie, at parting, as they stood in\nfront of the workingman's shack in which she lived, near Sixth and\nMarket.  He referred to the young fellow whose place he had usurped that\nday.\n\n\"I can't--now,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, go on,\" he said jovially.  \"All you have to do is whistle and he'll\ncome running.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" she said simply.\n\nAnd he knew what she had meant.\n\nShe leaned toward him as he was about to say good night.  But she leaned\nnot imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly.  He was\ntouched to the heart.  His large tolerance rose up in him.  He put his\narms around her, and kissed her, and knew that upon his own lips rested\nas true a kiss as man ever received.\n\n\"My God!\" she sobbed.  \"I could die for you.  I could die for you.\"\n\nShe tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps.  He felt a quick\nmoisture in his eyes.\n\n\"Martin Eden,\" he communed.  \"You're not a brute, and you're a damn poor\nNietzscheman.  You'd marry her if you could and fill her quivering heart\nfull with happiness.  But you can't, you can't.  And it's a damn shame.\"\n\n\"'A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers,'\" he muttered,\nremembering his Henly.  \"'Life is, I think, a blunder and a shame.'  It\nis--a blunder and a shame.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n\n\"The Shame of the Sun\" was published in October.  As Martin cut the cords\nof the express package and the half-dozen complimentary copies from the\npublishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness fell upon him.  He\nthought of the wild delight that would have been his had this happened a\nfew short months before, and he contrasted that delight that should have\nbeen with his present uncaring coldness.  His book, his first book, and\nhis pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat, and he was only sad.  It\nmeant little to him now.  The most it meant was that it might bring some\nmoney, and little enough did he care for money.\n\nHe carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria.\n\n\"I did it,\" he explained, in order to clear up her bewilderment.  \"I\nwrote it in the room there, and I guess some few quarts of your vegetable\nsoup went into the making of it.  Keep it.  It's yours.  Just to remember\nme by, you know.\"\n\nHe was not bragging, not showing off.  His sole motive was to make her\nhappy, to make her proud of him, to justify her long faith in him.  She\nput the book in the front room on top of the family Bible.  A sacred\nthing was this book her lodger had made, a fetich of friendship.  It\nsoftened the blow of his having been a laundryman, and though she could\nnot understand a line of it, she knew that every line of it was great.\nShe was a simple, practical, hard-working woman, but she possessed faith\nin large endowment.\n\nJust as emotionlessly as he had received \"The Shame of the Sun\" did he\nread the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau.  The\nbook was making a hit, that was evident.  It meant more gold in the money\nsack.  He could fix up Lizzie, redeem all his promises, and still have\nenough left to build his grass-walled castle.\n\nSingletree, Darnley & Co. had cautiously brought out an edition of\nfifteen hundred copies, but the first reviews had started a second\nedition of twice the size through the presses; and ere this was delivered\na third edition of five thousand had been ordered.  A London firm made\narrangements by cable for an English edition, and hot-footed upon this\ncame the news of French, German, and Scandinavian translations in\nprogress.  The attack upon the Maeterlinck school could not have been\nmade at a more opportune moment.  A fierce controversy was precipitated.\nSaleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended \"The Shame of the Sun,\" for\nonce finding themselves on the same side of a question.  Crookes and\nWallace ranged up on the opposing side, while Sir Oliver Lodge attempted\nto formulate a compromise that would jibe with his particular cosmic\ntheories.  Maeterlinck's followers rallied around the standard of\nmysticism.  Chesterton set the whole world laughing with a series of\nalleged non-partisan essays on the subject, and the whole affair,\ncontroversy and controversialists, was well-nigh swept into the pit by a\nthundering broadside from George Bernard Shaw.  Needless to say the arena\nwas crowded with hosts of lesser lights, and the dust and sweat and din\nbecame terrific.\n\n\"It is a most marvellous happening,\" Singletree, Darnley & Co. wrote\nMartin, \"a critical philosophic essay selling like a novel.  You could\nnot have chosen your subject better, and all contributory factors have\nbeen unwarrantedly propitious.  We need scarcely to assure you that we\nare making hay while the sun shines.  Over forty thousand copies have\nalready been sold in the United States and Canada, and a new edition of\ntwenty thousand is on the presses.  We are overworked, trying to supply\nthe demand.  Nevertheless we have helped to create that demand.  We have\nalready spent five thousand dollars in advertising.  The book is bound to\nbe a record-breaker.\"\n\n\"Please find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next book which we\nhave taken the liberty of forwarding to you.  You will please note that\nwe have increased your royalties to twenty per cent, which is about as\nhigh as a conservative publishing house dares go.  If our offer is\nagreeable to you, please fill in the proper blank space with the title of\nyour book.  We make no stipulations concerning its nature.  Any book on\nany subject.  If you have one already written, so much the better.  Now\nis the time to strike.  The iron could not be hotter.\"\n\n\"On receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make you an advance\non royalties of five thousand dollars.  You see, we have faith in you,\nand we are going in on this thing big.  We should like, also, to discuss\nwith you the drawing up of a contract for a term of years, say ten,\nduring which we shall have the exclusive right of publishing in book-form\nall that you produce.  But more of this anon.\"\n\nMartin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic,\nfinding the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine\nthousand dollars.  He signed the new contract, inserting \"The Smoke of\nJoy\" in the blank space, and mailed it back to the publishers along with\nthe twenty storiettes he had written in the days before he discovered the\nformula for the newspaper storiette.  And promptly as the United States\nmail could deliver and return, came Singletree, Darnley & Co.'s check for\nfive thousand dollars.\n\n\"I want you to come down town with me, Maria, this afternoon about two\no'clock,\" Martin said, the morning the check arrived.  \"Or, better, meet\nme at Fourteenth and Broadway at two o'clock.  I'll be looking out for\nyou.\"\n\nAt the appointed time she was there; but _shoes_ was the only clew to the\nmystery her mind had been capable of evolving, and she suffered a\ndistinct shock of disappointment when Martin walked her right by a shoe-\nstore and dived into a real estate office.  What happened thereupon\nresided forever after in her memory as a dream.  Fine gentlemen smiled at\nher benevolently as they talked with Martin and one another; a\ntype-writer clicked; signatures were affixed to an imposing document; her\nown landlord was there, too, and affixed his signature; and when all was\nover and she was outside on the sidewalk, her landlord spoke to her,\nsaying, \"Well, Maria, you won't have to pay me no seven dollars and a\nhalf this month.\"\n\nMaria was too stunned for speech.\n\n\"Or next month, or the next, or the next,\" her landlord said.\n\nShe thanked him incoherently, as if for a favor.  And it was not until\nshe had returned home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind,\nand had the Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really knew that she\nwas the owner of the little house in which she had lived and for which\nshe had paid rent so long.\n\n\"Why don't you trade with me no more?\" the Portuguese grocer asked Martin\nthat evening, stepping out to hail him when he got off the car; and\nMartin explained that he wasn't doing his own cooking any more, and then\nwent in and had a drink of wine on the house.  He noted it was the best\nwine the grocer had in stock.\n\n\"Maria,\" Martin announced that night, \"I'm going to leave you.  And\nyou're going to leave here yourself soon.  Then you can rent the house\nand be a landlord yourself.  You've a brother in San Leandro or Haywards,\nand he's in the milk business.  I want you to send all your washing back\nunwashed--understand?--unwashed, and to go out to San Leandro to-morrow,\nor Haywards, or wherever it is, and see that brother of yours.  Tell him\nto come to see me.  I'll be stopping at the Metropole down in Oakland.\nHe'll know a good milk-ranch when he sees one.\"\n\nAnd so it was that Maria became a landlord and the sole owner of a dairy,\nwith two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account that\nsteadily increased despite the fact that her whole brood wore shoes and\nwent to school.  Few persons ever meet the fairy princes they dream\nabout; but Maria, who worked hard and whose head was hard, never dreaming\nabout fairy princes, entertained hers in the guise of an ex-laundryman.\n\nIn the meantime the world had begun to ask: \"Who is this Martin Eden?\"  He\nhad declined to give any biographical data to his publishers, but the\nnewspapers were not to be denied.  Oakland was his own town, and the\nreporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information.\nAll that he was and was not, all that he had done and most of what he had\nnot done, was spread out for the delectation of the public, accompanied\nby snapshots and photographs--the latter procured from the local\nphotographer who had once taken Martin's picture and who promptly\ncopyrighted it and put it on the market.  At first, so great was his\ndisgust with the magazines and all bourgeois society, Martin fought\nagainst publicity; but in the end, because it was easier than not to, he\nsurrendered.  He found that he could not refuse himself to the special\nwriters who travelled long distances to see him.  Then again, each day\nwas so many hours long, and, since he no longer was occupied with writing\nand studying, those hours had to be occupied somehow; so he yielded to\nwhat was to him a whim, permitted interviews, gave his opinions on\nliterature and philosophy, and even accepted invitations of the\nbourgeoisie.  He had settled down into a strange and comfortable state of\nmind.  He no longer cared.  He forgave everybody, even the cub reporter\nwho had painted him red and to whom he now granted a full page with\nspecially posed photographs.\n\nHe saw Lizzie occasionally, and it was patent that she regretted the\ngreatness that had come to him.  It widened the space between them.\nPerhaps it was with the hope of narrowing it that she yielded to his\npersuasions to go to night school and business college and to have\nherself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous prices.\nShe improved visibly from day to day, until Martin wondered if he was\ndoing right, for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor was for his\nsake.  She was trying to make herself of worth in his eyes--of the sort\nof worth he seemed to value.  Yet he gave her no hope, treating her in\nbrotherly fashion and rarely seeing her.\n\n\"Overdue\" was rushed upon the market by the Meredith-Lowell Company in\nthe height of his popularity, and being fiction, in point of sales it\nmade even a bigger strike than \"The Shame of the Sun.\"  Week after week\nhis was the credit of the unprecedented performance of having two books\nat the head of the list of best-sellers.  Not only did the story take\nwith the fiction-readers, but those who read \"The Shame of the Sun\" with\navidity were likewise attracted to the sea-story by the cosmic grasp of\nmastery with which he had handled it.  First he had attacked the\nliterature of mysticism, and had done it exceeding well; and, next, he\nhad successfully supplied the very literature he had exposited, thus\nproving himself to be that rare genius, a critic and a creator in one.\n\nMoney poured in on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like,\nthrough the world of literature, and he was more amused than interested\nby the stir he was making.  One thing was puzzling him, a little thing\nthat would have puzzled the world had it known.  But the world would have\npuzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the little thing that to\nhim loomed gigantic.  Judge Blount invited him to dinner.  That was the\nlittle thing, or the beginning of the little thing, that was soon to\nbecome the big thing.  He had insulted Judge Blount, treated him\nabominably, and Judge Blount, meeting him on the street, invited him to\ndinner.  Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he\nhad met Judge Blount at the Morses' and when Judge Blount had not invited\nhim to dinner.  Why had he not invited him to dinner then? he asked\nhimself.  He had not changed.  He was the same Martin Eden.  What made\nthe difference?  The fact that the stuff he had written had appeared\ninside the covers of books?  But it was work performed.  It was not\nsomething he had done since.  It was achievement accomplished at the very\ntime Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his\nSpencer and his intellect.  Therefore it was not for any real value, but\nfor a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to dinner.\n\nMartin grinned and accepted the invitation, marvelling the while at his\ncomplacence.  And at the dinner, where, with their womankind, were half a\ndozen of those that sat in high places, and where Martin found himself\nquite the lion, Judge Blount, warmly seconded by Judge Hanwell, urged\nprivately that Martin should permit his name to be put up for the\nStyx--the ultra-select club to which belonged, not the mere men of\nwealth, but the men of attainment.  And Martin declined, and was more\npuzzled than ever.\n\nHe was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts.  He was\noverwhelmed by requests from editors.  It had been discovered that he was\na stylist, with meat under his style.  The Northern Review, after\npublishing \"The Cradle of Beauty,\" had written him for half a dozen\nsimilar essays, which would have been supplied out of the heap, had not\nBurton's Magazine, in a speculative mood, offered him five hundred\ndollars each for five essays.  He wrote back that he would supply the\ndemand, but at a thousand dollars an essay.  He remembered that all these\nmanuscripts had been refused by the very magazines that were now\nclamoring for them.  And their refusals had been cold-blooded, automatic,\nstereotyped.  They had made him sweat, and now he intended to make them\nsweat.  Burton's Magazine paid his price for five essays, and the\nremaining four, at the same rate, were snapped up by Mackintosh's\nMonthly, The Northern Review being too poor to stand the pace.  Thus went\nout to the world \"The High Priests of Mystery,\" \"The Wonder-Dreamers,\"\n\"The Yardstick of the Ego,\" \"Philosophy of Illusion,\" \"God and Clod,\"\n\"Art and Biology,\" \"Critics and Test-tubes,\" \"Star-dust,\" and \"The\nDignity of Usury,\"--to raise storms and rumblings and mutterings that\nwere many a day in dying down.\n\nEditors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms, which he did, but\nit was always for work performed.  He refused resolutely to pledge\nhimself to any new thing.  The thought of again setting pen to paper\nmaddened him.  He had seen Brissenden torn to pieces by the crowd, and\ndespite the fact that him the crowd acclaimed, he could not get over the\nshock nor gather any respect for the crowd.  His very popularity seemed a\ndisgrace and a treason to Brissenden.  It made him wince, but he made up\nhis mind to go on and fill the money-bag.\n\nHe received letters from editors like the following: \"About a year ago we\nwere unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of love-poems.  We were\ngreatly impressed by them at the time, but certain arrangements already\nentered into prevented our taking them.  If you still have them, and if\nyou will be kind enough to forward them, we shall be glad to publish the\nentire collection on your own terms.  We are also prepared to make a most\nadvantageous offer for bringing them out in book-form.\"\n\nMartin recollected his blank-verse tragedy, and sent it instead.  He read\nit over before mailing, and was particularly impressed by its sophomoric\namateurishness and general worthlessness.  But he sent it; and it was\npublished, to the everlasting regret of the editor.  The public was\nindignant and incredulous.  It was too far a cry from Martin Eden's high\nstandard to that serious bosh.  It was asserted that he had never written\nit, that the magazine had faked it very clumsily, or that Martin Eden was\nemulating the elder Dumas and at the height of success was hiring his\nwriting done for him.  But when he explained that the tragedy was an\nearly effort of his literary childhood, and that the magazine had refused\nto be happy unless it got it, a great laugh went up at the magazine's\nexpense and a change in the editorship followed.  The tragedy was never\nbrought out in book-form, though Martin pocketed the advance royalties\nthat had been paid.\n\nColeman's Weekly sent Martin a lengthy telegram, costing nearly three\nhundred dollars, offering him a thousand dollars an article for twenty\narticles.  He was to travel over the United States, with all expenses\npaid, and select whatever topics interested him.  The body of the\ntelegram was devoted to hypothetical topics in order to show him the\nfreedom of range that was to be his.  The only restriction placed upon\nhim was that he must confine himself to the United States.  Martin sent\nhis inability to accept and his regrets by wire \"collect.\"\n\n\"Wiki-Wiki,\" published in Warren's Monthly, was an instantaneous success.\nIt was brought out forward in a wide-margined, beautifully decorated\nvolume that struck the holiday trade and sold like wildfire.  The critics\nwere unanimous in the belief that it would take its place with those two\nclassics by two great writers, \"The Bottle Imp\" and \"The Magic Skin.\"\n\nThe public, however, received the \"Smoke of Joy\" collection rather\ndubiously and coldly.  The audacity and unconventionality of the\nstoriettes was a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice; but when\nParis went mad over the immediate translation that was made, the American\nand English reading public followed suit and bought so many copies that\nMartin compelled the conservative house of Singletree, Darnley & Co. to\npay a flat royalty of twenty-five per cent for a third book, and thirty\nper cent flat for a fourth.  These two volumes comprised all the short\nstories he had written and which had received, or were receiving, serial\npublication.  \"The Ring of Bells\" and his horror stories constituted one\ncollection; the other collection was composed of \"Adventure,\" \"The Pot,\"\n\"The Wine of Life,\" \"The Whirlpool,\" \"The Jostling Street,\" and four\nother stories.  The Lowell-Meredith Company captured the collection of\nall his essays, and the Maxmillian Company got his \"Sea Lyrics\" and the\n\"Love-cycle,\" the latter receiving serial publication in the Ladies' Home\nCompanion after the payment of an extortionate price.\n\nMartin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last\nmanuscript.  The grass-walled castle and the white, coppered schooner\nwere very near to him.  Well, at any rate he had discovered Brissenden's\ncontention that nothing of merit found its way into the magazines.  His\nown success demonstrated that Brissenden had been wrong.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, he had a feeling that Brissenden had been right, after\nall.  \"The Shame of the Sun\" had been the cause of his success more than\nthe stuff he had written.  That stuff had been merely incidental.  It had\nbeen rejected right and left by the magazines.  The publication of \"The\nShame of the Sun\" had started a controversy and precipitated the\nlandslide in his favor.  Had there been no \"Shame of the Sun\" there would\nhave been no landslide, and had there been no miracle in the go of \"The\nShame of the Sun\" there would have been no landslide.  Singletree,\nDarnley & Co. attested that miracle.  They had brought out a first\nedition of fifteen hundred copies and been dubious of selling it.  They\nwere experienced publishers and no one had been more astounded than they\nat the success which had followed.  To them it had been in truth a\nmiracle.  They never got over it, and every letter they wrote him\nreflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious happening.  They\ndid not attempt to explain it.  There was no explaining it.  It had\nhappened.  In the face of all experience to the contrary, it had\nhappened.\n\nSo it was, reasoning thus, that Martin questioned the validity of his\npopularity.  It was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and poured its\ngold into his money-sack, and from what little he knew of the bourgeoisie\nit was not clear to him how it could possibly appreciate or comprehend\nwhat he had written.  His intrinsic beauty and power meant nothing to the\nhundreds of thousands who were acclaiming him and buying his books.  He\nwas the fad of the hour, the adventurer who had stormed Parnassus while\nthe gods nodded.  The hundreds of thousands read him and acclaimed him\nwith the same brute non-understanding with which they had flung\nthemselves on Brissenden's \"Ephemera\" and torn it to pieces--a\nwolf-rabble that fawned on him instead of fanging him.  Fawn or fang, it\nwas all a matter of chance.  One thing he knew with absolute certitude:\n\"Ephemera\" was infinitely greater than anything he had done.  It was\ninfinitely greater than anything he had in him.  It was a poem of\ncenturies.  Then the tribute the mob paid him was a sorry tribute indeed,\nfor that same mob had wallowed \"Ephemera\" into the mire.  He sighed\nheavily and with satisfaction.  He was glad the last manuscript was sold\nand that he would soon be done with it all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nMr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole.  Whether he\nhad happened there just casually, intent on other affairs, or whether he\nhad come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner, Martin\nnever could quite make up his mind, though he inclined toward the second\nhypothesis.  At any rate, invited to dinner he was by Mr. Morse--Ruth's\nfather, who had forbidden him the house and broken off the engagement.\n\nMartin was not angry.  He was not even on his dignity.  He tolerated Mr.\nMorse, wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie.  He did\nnot decline the invitation.  Instead, he put it off with vagueness and\nindefiniteness and inquired after the family, particularly after Mrs.\nMorse and Ruth.  He spoke her name without hesitancy, naturally, though\nsecretly surprised that he had had no inward quiver, no old, familiar\nincrease of pulse and warm surge of blood.\n\nHe had many invitations to dinner, some of which he accepted.  Persons\ngot themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner.  And\nhe went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great\nthing.  Bernard Higginbotham invited him to dinner.  He puzzled the\nharder.  He remembered the days of his desperate starvation when no one\ninvited him to dinner.  That was the time he needed dinners, and went\nweak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from sheer famine.  That\nwas the paradox of it.  When he wanted dinners, no one gave them to him,\nand now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners and was losing his\nappetite, dinners were thrust upon him right and left.  But why?  There\nwas no justice in it, no merit on his part.  He was no different.  All\nthe work he had done was even at that time work performed.  Mr. and Mrs.\nMorse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had\nurged that he take a clerk's position in an office.  Furthermore, they\nhad been aware of his work performed.  Manuscript after manuscript of his\nhad been turned over to them by Ruth.  They had read them.  It was the\nvery same work that had put his name in all the papers, and, it was his\nname being in all the papers that led them to invite him.\n\nOne thing was certain: the Morses had not cared to have him for himself\nor for his work.  Therefore they could not want him now for himself or\nfor his work, but for the fame that was his, because he was somebody\namongst men, and--why not?--because he had a hundred thousand dollars or\nso.  That was the way bourgeois society valued a man, and who was he to\nexpect it otherwise?  But he was proud.  He disdained such valuation.  He\ndesired to be valued for himself, or for his work, which, after all, was\nan expression of himself.  That was the way Lizzie valued him.  The work,\nwith her, did not even count.  She valued him, himself.  That was the way\nJimmy, the plumber, and all the old gang valued him.  That had been\nproved often enough in the days when he ran with them; it had been proved\nthat Sunday at Shell Mound Park.  His work could go hang.  What they\nliked, and were willing to scrap for, was just Mart Eden, one of the\nbunch and a pretty good guy.\n\nThen there was Ruth.  She had liked him for himself, that was\nindisputable.  And yet, much as she had liked him she had liked the\nbourgeois standard of valuation more.  She had opposed his writing, and\nprincipally, it seemed to him, because it did not earn money.  That had\nbeen her criticism of his \"Love-cycle.\"  She, too, had urged him to get a\njob.  It was true, she refined it to \"position,\" but it meant the same\nthing, and in his own mind the old nomenclature stuck.  He had read her\nall that he wrote--poems, stories, essays--\"Wiki-Wiki,\" \"The Shame of the\nSun,\" everything.  And she had always and consistently urged him to get a\njob, to go to work--good God!--as if he hadn't been working, robbing\nsleep, exhausting life, in order to be worthy of her.\n\nSo the little thing grew bigger.  He was healthy and normal, ate\nregularly, slept long hours, and yet the growing little thing was\nbecoming an obsession.  Work performed.  The phrase haunted his brain.  He\nsat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over\nHigginbotham's Cash Store, and it was all he could do to restrain himself\nfrom shouting out:-\n\n\"It was work performed!  And now you feed me, when then you let me\nstarve, forbade me your house, and damned me because I wouldn't get a\njob.  And the work was already done, all done.  And now, when I speak,\nyou check the thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and pay\nrespectful attention to whatever I choose to say.  I tell you your party\nis rotten and filled with grafters, and instead of flying into a rage you\nhum and haw and admit there is a great deal in what I say.  And why?\nBecause I'm famous; because I've a lot of money.  Not because I'm Martin\nEden, a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool.  I could tell you\nthe moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to the notion,\nat least you would not repudiate it, because I've got dollars, mountains\nof them.  And it was all done long ago; it was work performed, I tell\nyou, when you spat upon me as the dirt under your feet.\"\n\nBut Martin did not shout out.  The thought gnawed in his brain, an\nunceasing torment, while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant.  As\nhe grew silent, Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking.\nHe was a success himself, and proud of it.  He was self-made.  No one had\nhelped him.  He owed no man.  He was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and\nbringing up a large family.  And there was Higginbotham's Cash Store,\nthat monument of his own industry and ability.  He loved Higginbotham's\nCash Store as some men loved their wives.  He opened up his heart to\nMartin, showed with what keenness and with what enormous planning he had\nmade the store.  And he had plans for it, ambitious plans.  The\nneighborhood was growing up fast.  The store was really too small.  If he\nhad more room, he would be able to put in a score of labor-saving and\nmoney-saving improvements.  And he would do it yet.  He was straining\nevery effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up\nanother two-story frame building.  The upstairs he could rent, and the\nwhole ground-floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham's Cash Store.\nHis eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would stretch clear\nacross both buildings.\n\nMartin forgot to listen.  The refrain of \"Work performed,\" in his own\nbrain, was drowning the other's clatter.  The refrain maddened him, and\nhe tried to escape from it.\n\n\"How much did you say it would cost?\" he asked suddenly.\n\nHis brother-in-law paused in the middle of an expatiation on the business\nopportunities of the neighborhood.  He hadn't said how much it would\ncost.  But he knew.  He had figured it out a score of times.\n\n\"At the way lumber is now,\" he said, \"four thousand could do it.\"\n\n\"Including the sign?\"\n\n\"I didn't count on that.  It'd just have to come, onc't the buildin' was\nthere.\"\n\n\"And the ground?\"\n\n\"Three thousand more.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, licking his lips, nervously spreading and closing his\nfingers, while he watched Martin write a check.  When it was passed over\nto him, he glanced at the amount-seven thousand dollars.\n\n\"I--I can't afford to pay more than six per cent,\" he said huskily.\n\nMartin wanted to laugh, but, instead, demanded:-\n\n\"How much would that be?\"\n\n\"Lemme see.  Six per cent--six times seven--four hundred an' twenty.\"\n\n\"That would be thirty-five dollars a month, wouldn't it?\"\n\nHigginbotham nodded.\n\n\"Then, if you've no objection, well arrange it this way.\"  Martin glanced\nat Gertrude.  \"You can have the principal to keep for yourself, if you'll\nuse the thirty-five dollars a month for cooking and washing and\nscrubbing.  The seven thousand is yours if you'll guarantee that Gertrude\ndoes no more drudgery.  Is it a go?\"\n\nMr. Higginbotham swallowed hard.  That his wife should do no more\nhousework was an affront to his thrifty soul.  The magnificent present\nwas the coating of a pill, a bitter pill.  That his wife should not work!\nIt gagged him.\n\n\"All right, then,\" Martin said.  \"I'll pay the thirty-five a month, and--\"\n\nHe reached across the table for the check.  But Bernard Higginbotham got\nhis hand on it first, crying:\n\n\"I accept!  I accept!\"\n\nWhen Martin got on the electric car, he was very sick and tired.  He\nlooked up at the assertive sign.\n\n\"The swine,\" he groaned.  \"The swine, the swine.\"\n\nWhen Mackintosh's Magazine published \"The Palmist,\" featuring it with\ndecorations by Berthier and with two pictures by Wenn, Hermann von\nSchmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene.  He announced that\nhis wife had inspired the poem, saw to it that the news reached the ears\nof a reporter, and submitted to an interview by a staff writer who was\naccompanied by a staff photographer and a staff artist.  The result was a\nfull page in a Sunday supplement, filled with photographs and idealized\ndrawings of Marian, with many intimate details of Martin Eden and his\nfamily, and with the full text of \"The Palmist\" in large type, and\nrepublished by special permission of Mackintosh's Magazine.  It caused\nquite a stir in the neighborhood, and good housewives were proud to have\nthe acquaintances of the great writer's sister, while those who had not\nmade haste to cultivate it.  Hermann von Schmidt chuckled in his little\nrepair shop and decided to order a new lathe.  \"Better than advertising,\"\nhe told Marian, \"and it costs nothing.\"\n\n\"We'd better have him to dinner,\" she suggested.\n\nAnd to dinner Martin came, making himself agreeable with the fat\nwholesale butcher and his fatter wife--important folk, they, likely to be\nof use to a rising young man like Hermann Von Schmidt.  No less a bait,\nhowever, had been required to draw them to his house than his great\nbrother-in-law.  Another man at table who had swallowed the same bait was\nthe superintendent of the Pacific Coast agencies for the Asa Bicycle\nCompany.  Him Von Schmidt desired to please and propitiate because from\nhim could be obtained the Oakland agency for the bicycle.  So Hermann von\nSchmidt found it a goodly asset to have Martin for a brother-in-law, but\nin his heart of hearts he couldn't understand where it all came in.  In\nthe silent watches of the night, while his wife slept, he had floundered\nthrough Martin's books and poems, and decided that the world was a fool\nto buy them.\n\nAnd in his heart of hearts Martin understood the situation only too well,\nas he leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt's head, in fancy punching it\nwell-nigh off of him, sending blow after blow home just right--the\nchuckle-headed Dutchman!  One thing he did like about him, however.  Poor\nas he was, and determined to rise as he was, he nevertheless hired one\nservant to take the heavy work off of Marian's hands.  Martin talked with\nthe superintendent of the Asa agencies, and after dinner he drew him\naside with Hermann, whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store\nwith fittings in Oakland.  He went further, and in a private talk with\nHermann told him to keep his eyes open for an automobile agency and\ngarage, for there was no reason that he should not be able to run both\nestablishments successfully.\n\nWith tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck, Marian, at parting,\ntold Martin how much she loved him and always had loved him.  It was\ntrue, there was a perceptible halt midway in her assertion, which she\nglossed over with more tears and kisses and incoherent stammerings, and\nwhich Martin inferred to be her appeal for forgiveness for the time she\nhad lacked faith in him and insisted on his getting a job.\n\n\"He can't never keep his money, that's sure,\" Hermann von Schmidt\nconfided to his wife.  \"He got mad when I spoke of interest, an' he said\ndamn the principal and if I mentioned it again, he'd punch my Dutch head\noff.  That's what he said--my Dutch head.  But he's all right, even if he\nain't no business man.  He's given me my chance, an' he's all right.\"\n\nInvitations to dinner poured in on Martin; and the more they poured, the\nmore he puzzled.  He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club banquet,\nwith men of note whom he had heard about and read about all his life; and\nthey told him how, when they had read \"The Ring of Bells\" in the\nTranscontinental, and \"The Peri and the Pearl\" in The Hornet, they had\nimmediately picked him for a winner.  My God! and I was hungry and in\nrags, he thought to himself.  Why didn't you give me a dinner then?  Then\nwas the time.  It was work performed.  If you are feeding me now for work\nperformed, why did you not feed me then when I needed it?  Not one word\nin \"The Ring of Bells,\" nor in \"The Peri and the Pearl\" has been changed.\nNo; you're not feeding me now for work performed.  You are feeding me\nbecause everybody else is feeding me and because it is an honor to feed\nme.  You are feeding me now because you are herd animals; because you are\npart of the mob; because the one blind, automatic thought in the mob-mind\njust now is to feed me.  And where does Martin Eden and the work Martin\nEden performed come in in all this? he asked himself plaintively, then\narose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast.\n\nSo it went.  Wherever he happened to be--at the Press Club, at the\nRedwood Club, at pink teas and literary gatherings--always were\nremembered \"The Ring of Bells\" and \"The Peri and the Pearl\" when they\nwere first published.  And always was Martin's maddening and unuttered\ndemand: Why didn't you feed me then?  It was work performed.  \"The Ring\nof Bells\" and \"The Peri and the Pearl\" are not changed one iota.  They\nwere just as artistic, just as worth while, then as now.  But you are not\nfeeding me for their sake, nor for the sake of anything else I have\nwritten.  You're feeding me because it is the style of feeding just now,\nbecause the whole mob is crazy with the idea of feeding Martin Eden.\n\nAnd often, at such times, he would abruptly see slouch in among the\ncompany a young hoodlum in square-cut coat and under a stiff-rim Stetson\nhat.  It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.\nAs he rose from his chair and stepped forward across the platform, he saw\nstalk through the wide door at the rear of the great room the young\nhoodlum with the square-cut coat and stiff-rim hat.  Five hundred\nfashionably gowned women turned their heads, so intent and steadfast was\nMartin's gaze, to see what he was seeing.  But they saw only the empty\ncentre aisle.  He saw the young tough lurching down that aisle and\nwondered if he would remove the stiff-rim which never yet had he seen him\nwithout.  Straight down the aisle he came, and up the platform.  Martin\ncould have wept over that youthful shade of himself, when he thought of\nall that lay before him.  Across the platform he swaggered, right up to\nMartin, and into the foreground of Martin's consciousness disappeared.\nThe five hundred women applauded softly with gloved hands, seeking to\nencourage the bashful great man who was their guest.  And Martin shook\nthe vision from his brain, smiled, and began to speak.\n\nThe Superintendent of Schools, good old man, stopped Martin on the street\nand remembered him, recalling seances in his office when Martin was\nexpelled from school for fighting.\n\n\"I read your 'Ring of Bells' in one of the magazines quite a time ago,\"\nhe said.  \"It was as good as Poe.  Splendid, I said at the time,\nsplendid!\"\n\nYes, and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street\nand did not know me, Martin almost said aloud.  Each time I was hungry\nand heading for the pawnbroker.  Yet it was work performed.  You did not\nknow me then.  Why do you know me now?\n\n\"I was remarking to my wife only the other day,\" the other was saying,\n\"wouldn't it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some time?  And she\nquite agreed with me.  Yes, she quite agreed with me.\"\n\n\"Dinner?\" Martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl.\n\n\"Why, yes, yes, dinner, you know--just pot luck with us, with your old\nsuperintendent, you rascal,\" he uttered nervously, poking Martin in an\nattempt at jocular fellowship.\n\nMartin went down the street in a daze.  He stopped at the corner and\nlooked about him vacantly.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\" he murmured at last.  \"The old fellow was afraid\nof me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n\nKreis came to Martin one day--Kreis, of the \"real dirt\"; and Martin\nturned to him with relief, to receive the glowing details of a scheme\nsufficiently wild-catty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an\ninvestor.  Kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to\ntell him that in most of his \"Shame of the Sun\" he had been a chump.\n\n\"But I didn't come here to spout philosophy,\" Kreis went on.  \"What I\nwant to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in on this\ndeal?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not chump enough for that, at any rate,\" Martin answered.  \"But\nI'll tell you what I will do.  You gave me the greatest night of my life.\nYou gave me what money cannot buy.  Now I've got money, and it means\nnothing to me.  I'd like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of what I\ndon't value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond price.\nYou need the money.  I've got more than I need.  You want it.  You came\nfor it.  There's no use scheming it out of me.  Take it.\"\n\nKreis betrayed no surprise.  He folded the check away in his pocket.\n\n\"At that rate I'd like the contract of providing you with many such\nnights,\" he said.\n\n\"Too late.\"  Martin shook his head.  \"That night was the one night for\nme.  I was in paradise.  It's commonplace with you, I know.  But it\nwasn't to me.  I shall never live at such a pitch again.  I'm done with\nphilosophy.  I want never to hear another word of it.\"\n\n\"The first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy,\" Kreis\nremarked, as he paused in the doorway.  \"And then the market broke.\"\n\nMrs. Morse drove by Martin on the street one day, and smiled and nodded.\nHe smiled back and lifted his hat.  The episode did not affect him.  A\nmonth before it might have disgusted him, or made him curious and set him\nto speculating about her state of consciousness at that moment.  But now\nit was not provocative of a second thought.  He forgot about it the next\nmoment.  He forgot about it as he would have forgotten the Central Bank\nBuilding or the City Hall after having walked past them.  Yet his mind\nwas preternaturally active.  His thoughts went ever around and around in\na circle.  The centre of that circle was \"work performed\"; it ate at his\nbrain like a deathless maggot.  He awoke to it in the morning.  It\ntormented his dreams at night.  Every affair of life around him that\npenetrated through his senses immediately related itself to \"work\nperformed.\"  He drove along the path of relentless logic to the\nconclusion that he was nobody, nothing.  Mart Eden, the hoodlum, and Mart\nEden, the sailor, had been real, had been he; but Martin Eden! the famous\nwriter, did not exist.  Martin Eden, the famous writer, was a vapor that\nhad arisen in the mob-mind and by the mob-mind had been thrust into the\ncorporeal being of Mart Eden, the hoodlum and sailor.  But it couldn't\nfool him.  He was not that sun-myth that the mob was worshipping and\nsacrificing dinners to.  He knew better.\n\nHe read the magazines about himself, and pored over portraits of himself\npublished therein until he was unable to associate his identity with\nthose portraits.  He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and loved;\nwho had been easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of life; who had\nserved in the forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and led his gang in\nthe old fighting days.  He was the fellow who had been stunned at first\nby the thousands of books in the free library, and who had afterward\nlearned his way among them and mastered them; he was the fellow who had\nburned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and written books himself.\nBut the one thing he was not was that colossal appetite that all the mob\nwas bent upon feeding.\n\nThere were things, however, in the magazines that amused him.  All the\nmagazines were claiming him.  Warren's Monthly advertised to its\nsubscribers that it was always on the quest after new writers, and that,\namong others, it had introduced Martin Eden to the reading public.  The\nWhite Mouse claimed him; so did The Northern Review and Mackintosh's\nMagazine, until silenced by The Globe, which pointed triumphantly to its\nfiles where the mangled \"Sea Lyrics\" lay buried.  Youth and Age, which\nhad come to life again after having escaped paying its bills, put in a\nprior claim, which nobody but farmers' children ever read.  The\nTranscontinental made a dignified and convincing statement of how it\nfirst discovered Martin Eden, which was warmly disputed by The Hornet,\nwith the exhibit of \"The Peri and the Pearl.\"  The modest claim of\nSingletree, Darnley & Co. was lost in the din.  Besides, that publishing\nfirm did not own a magazine wherewith to make its claim less modest.\n\nThe newspapers calculated Martin's royalties.  In some way the\nmagnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out, and Oakland\nministers called upon him in a friendly way, while professional begging\nletters began to clutter his mail.  But worse than all this were the\nwomen.  His photographs were published broadcast, and special writers\nexploited his strong, bronzed face, his scars, his heavy shoulders, his\nclear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows in his cheeks like an\nascetic's.  At this last he remembered his wild youth and smiled.  Often,\namong the women he met, he would see now one, now another, looking at\nhim, appraising him, selecting him.  He laughed to himself.  He\nremembered Brissenden's warning and laughed again.  The women would never\ndestroy him, that much was certain.  He had gone past that stage.\n\nOnce, walking with Lizzie toward night school, she caught a glance\ndirected toward him by a well-gowned, handsome woman of the bourgeoisie.\nThe glance was a trifle too long, a shade too considerative.  Lizzie knew\nit for what it was, and her body tensed angrily.  Martin noticed, noticed\nthe cause of it, told her how used he was becoming to it and that he did\nnot care anyway.\n\n\"You ought to care,\" she answered with blazing eyes.  \"You're sick.\nThat's what's the matter.\"\n\n\"Never healthier in my life.  I weigh five pounds more than I ever did.\"\n\n\"It ain't your body.  It's your head.  Something's wrong with your think-\nmachine.  Even I can see that, an' I ain't nobody.\"\n\nHe walked on beside her, reflecting.\n\n\"I'd give anything to see you get over it,\" she broke out impulsively.\n\"You ought to care when women look at you that way, a man like you.  It's\nnot natural.  It's all right enough for sissy-boys.  But you ain't made\nthat way.  So help me, I'd be willing an' glad if the right woman came\nalong an' made you care.\"\n\nWhen he left Lizzie at night school, he returned to the Metropole.\n\nOnce in his rooms, he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring\nstraight before him.  He did not doze.  Nor did he think.  His mind was a\nblank, save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form\nand color and radiance just under his eyelids.  He saw these pictures,\nbut he was scarcely conscious of them--no more so than if they had been\ndreams.  Yet he was not asleep.  Once, he roused himself and glanced at\nhis watch.  It was just eight o'clock.  He had nothing to do, and it was\ntoo early for bed.  Then his mind went blank again, and the pictures\nbegan to form and vanish under his eyelids.  There was nothing\ndistinctive about the pictures.  They were always masses of leaves and\nshrub-like branches shot through with hot sunshine.\n\nA knock at the door aroused him.  He was not asleep, and his mind\nimmediately connected the knock with a telegram, or letter, or perhaps\none of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry.  He was\nthinking about Joe and wondering where he was, as he said, \"Come in.\"\n\nHe was still thinking about Joe, and did not turn toward the door.  He\nheard it close softly.  There was a long silence.  He forgot that there\nhad been a knock at the door, and was still staring blankly before him\nwhen he heard a woman's sob.  It was involuntary, spasmodic, checked, and\nstifled--he noted that as he turned about.  The next instant he was on\nhis feet.\n\n\"Ruth!\" he said, amazed and bewildered.\n\nHer face was white and strained.  She stood just inside the door, one\nhand against it for support, the other pressed to her side.  She extended\nboth hands toward him piteously, and started forward to meet him.  As he\ncaught her hands and led her to the Morris chair he noticed how cold they\nwere.  He drew up another chair and sat down on the broad arm of it.  He\nwas too confused to speak.  In his own mind his affair with Ruth was\nclosed and sealed.  He felt much in the same way that he would have felt\nhad the Shelly Hot Springs Laundry suddenly invaded the Hotel Metropole\nwith a whole week's washing ready for him to pitch into.  Several times\nhe was about to speak, and each time he hesitated.\n\n\"No one knows I am here,\" Ruth said in a faint voice, with an appealing\nsmile.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\nHe was surprised at the sound of his own voice.\n\nShe repeated her words.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, then wondered what more he could possibly say.\n\n\"I saw you come in, and I waited a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said again.\n\nHe had never been so tongue-tied in his life.  Positively he did not have\nan idea in his head.  He felt stupid and awkward, but for the life of him\nhe could think of nothing to say.  It would have been easier had the\nintrusion been the Shelly Hot Springs laundry.  He could have rolled up\nhis sleeves and gone to work.\n\n\"And then you came in,\" he said finally.\n\nShe nodded, with a slightly arch expression, and loosened the scarf at\nher throat.\n\n\"I saw you first from across the street when you were with that girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said simply.  \"I took her down to night school.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't you glad to see me?\" she said at the end of another\nsilence.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"  He spoke hastily.  \"But wasn't it rash of you to come here?\"\n\n\"I slipped in.  Nobody knows I am here.  I wanted to see you.  I came to\ntell you I have been very foolish.  I came because I could no longer stay\naway, because my heart compelled me to come, because--because I wanted to\ncome.\"\n\nShe came forward, out of her chair and over to him.  She rested her hand\non his shoulder a moment, breathing quickly, and then slipped into his\narms.  And in his large, easy way, desirous of not inflicting hurt,\nknowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict the most\ngrievous hurt a woman could receive, he folded his arms around her and\nheld her close.  But there was no warmth in the embrace, no caress in the\ncontact.  She had come into his arms, and he held her, that was all.  She\nnestled against him, and then, with a change of position, her hands crept\nup and rested upon his neck.  But his flesh was not fire beneath those\nhands, and he felt awkward and uncomfortable.\n\n\"What makes you tremble so?\" he asked.  \"Is it a chill?  Shall I light\nthe grate?\"\n\nHe made a movement to disengage himself, but she clung more closely to\nhim, shivering violently.\n\n\"It is merely nervousness,\" she said with chattering teeth.  \"I'll\ncontrol myself in a minute.  There, I am better already.\"\n\nSlowly her shivering died away.  He continued to hold her, but he was no\nlonger puzzled.  He knew now for what she had come.\n\n\"My mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood,\" she announced.\n\n\"Charley Hapgood, that fellow who speaks always in platitudes?\" Martin\ngroaned.  Then he added, \"And now, I suppose, your mother wants you to\nmarry me.\"\n\nHe did not put it in the form of a question.  He stated it as a\ncertitude, and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of his\nroyalties.\n\n\"She will not object, I know that much,\" Ruth said.\n\n\"She considers me quite eligible?\"\n\nRuth nodded.\n\n\"And yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she broke our\nengagement,\" he meditated.  \"I haven't changed any.  I'm the same Martin\nEden, though for that matter I'm a bit worse--I smoke now.  Don't you\nsmell my breath?\"\n\nIn reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips, placed them\ngraciously and playfully, and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had\nalways been a consequence.  But there was no caressing answer of Martin's\nlips.  He waited until the fingers were removed and then went on.\n\n\"I am not changed.  I haven't got a job.  I'm not looking for a job.\nFurthermore, I am not going to look for a job.  And I still believe that\nHerbert Spencer is a great and noble man and that Judge Blount is an\nunmitigated ass.  I had dinner with him the other night, so I ought to\nknow.\"\n\n\"But you didn't accept father's invitation,\" she chided.\n\n\"So you know about that?  Who sent him?  Your mother?\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"Then she did send him.  I thought so.  And now I suppose she has sent\nyou.\"\n\n\"No one knows that I am here,\" she protested.  \"Do you think my mother\nwould permit this?\"\n\n\"She'd permit you to marry me, that's certain.\"\n\nShe gave a sharp cry.  \"Oh, Martin, don't be cruel.  You have not kissed\nme once.  You are as unresponsive as a stone.  And think what I have\ndared to do.\"  She looked about her with a shiver, though half the look\nwas curiosity.  \"Just think of where I am.\"\n\n\"_I could die for you!  I could die for you_!\"--Lizzie's words were\nringing in his ears.\n\n\"Why didn't you dare it before?\" he asked harshly.  \"When I hadn't a job?\nWhen I was starving?  When I was just as I am now, as a man, as an\nartist, the same Martin Eden?  That's the question I've been propounding\nto myself for many a day--not concerning you merely, but concerning\neverybody.  You see I have not changed, though my sudden apparent\nappreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that\npoint.  I've got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and\ntoes.  I am the same.  I have not developed any new strength nor virtue.\nMy brain is the same old brain.  I haven't made even one new\ngeneralization on literature or philosophy.  I am personally of the same\nvalue that I was when nobody wanted me.  And what is puzzling me is why\nthey want me now.  Surely they don't want me for myself, for myself is\nthe same old self they did not want.  Then they must want me for\nsomething else, for something that is outside of me, for something that\nis not I!  Shall I tell you what that something is?  It is for the\nrecognition I have received.  That recognition is not I.  It resides in\nthe minds of others.  Then again for the money I have earned and am\nearning.  But that money is not I.  It resides in banks and in the\npockets of Tom, Dick, and Harry.  And is it for that, for the recognition\nand the money, that you now want me?\"\n\n\"You are breaking my heart,\" she sobbed.  \"You know I love you, that I am\nhere because I love you.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you don't see my point,\" he said gently.  \"What I mean is:\nif you love me, how does it happen that you love me now so much more than\nyou did when your love was weak enough to deny me?\"\n\n\"Forget and forgive,\" she cried passionately.  \"I loved you all the time,\nremember that, and I am here, now, in your arms.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I am a shrewd merchant, peering into the scales, trying to\nweigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is.\"\n\nShe withdrew herself from his arms, sat upright, and looked at him long\nand searchingly.  She was about to speak, then faltered and changed her\nmind.\n\n\"You see, it appears this way to me,\" he went on.  \"When I was all that I\nam now, nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me.  When my books\nwere all written, no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to care for\nthem.  In point of fact, because of the stuff I had written they seemed\nto care even less for me.  In writing the stuff it seemed that I had\ncommitted acts that were, to say the least, derogatory.  'Get a job,'\neverybody said.\"\n\nShe made a movement of dissent.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said; \"except in your case you told me to get a position.\nThe homely word _job_, like much that I have written, offends you.  It is\nbrutal.  But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when everybody I\nknew recommended it to me as they would recommend right conduct to an\nimmoral creature.  But to return.  The publication of what I had written,\nand the public notice I received, wrought a change in the fibre of your\nlove.  Martin Eden, with his work all performed, you would not marry.\nYour love for him was not strong enough to enable you to marry him.  But\nyour love is now strong enough, and I cannot avoid the conclusion that\nits strength arises from the publication and the public notice.  In your\ncase I do not mention royalties, though I am certain that they apply to\nthe change wrought in your mother and father.  Of course, all this is not\nflattering to me.  But worst of all, it makes me question love, sacred\nlove.  Is love so gross a thing that it must feed upon publication and\npublic notice?  It would seem so.  I have sat and thought upon it till my\nhead went around.\"\n\n\"Poor, dear head.\"  She reached up a hand and passed the fingers\nsoothingly through his hair.  \"Let it go around no more.  Let us begin\nanew, now.  I loved you all the time.  I know that I was weak in yielding\nto my mother's will.  I should not have done so.  Yet I have heard you\nspeak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of\nhumankind.  Extend that charity to me.  I acted mistakenly.  Forgive me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do forgive,\" he said impatiently.  \"It is easy to forgive where\nthere is really nothing to forgive.  Nothing that you have done requires\nforgiveness.  One acts according to one's lights, and more than that one\ncannot do.  As well might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a\njob.\"\n\n\"I meant well,\" she protested.  \"You know that I could not have loved you\nand not meant well.\"\n\n\"True; but you would have destroyed me out of your well-meaning.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he shut off her attempted objection.  \"You would have\ndestroyed my writing and my career.  Realism is imperative to my nature,\nand the bourgeois spirit hates realism.  The bourgeoisie is cowardly.  It\nis afraid of life.  And all your effort was to make me afraid of life.\nYou would have formalized me.  You would have compressed me into a two-by-\nfour pigeonhole of life, where all life's values are unreal, and false,\nand vulgar.\"  He felt her stir protestingly.  \"Vulgarity--a hearty\nvulgarity, I'll admit--is the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture.\nAs I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me over into one of your\nown class, with your class-ideals, class-values, and class-prejudices.\"\nHe shook his head sadly.  \"And you do not understand, even now, what I am\nsaying.  My words do not mean to you what I endeavor to make them mean.\nWhat I say is so much fantasy to you.  Yet to me it is vital reality.  At\nthe best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy, crawling\nup out of the mire of the abyss, should pass judgment upon your class and\ncall it vulgar.\"\n\nShe leaned her head wearily against his shoulder, and her body shivered\nwith recurrent nervousness.  He waited for a time for her to speak, and\nthen went on.\n\n\"And now you want to renew our love.  You want us to be married.  You\nwant me.  And yet, listen--if my books had not been noticed, I'd\nnevertheless have been just what I am now.  And you would have stayed\naway.  It is all those damned books--\"\n\n\"Don't swear,\" she interrupted.\n\nHer reproof startled him.  He broke into a harsh laugh.\n\n\"That's it,\" he said, \"at a high moment, when what seems your life's\nhappiness is at stake, you are afraid of life in the same old way--afraid\nof life and a healthy oath.\"\n\nShe was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her act,\nand yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was consequently\nresentful.  They sat in silence for a long time, she thinking desperately\nand he pondering upon his love which had departed.  He knew, now, that he\nhad not really loved her.  It was an idealized Ruth he had loved, an\nethereal creature of his own creating, the bright and luminous spirit of\nhis love-poems.  The real bourgeois Ruth, with all the bourgeois failings\nand with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois psychology in her mind, he\nhad never loved.\n\nShe suddenly began to speak.\n\n\"I know that much you have said is so.  I have been afraid of life.  I\ndid not love you well enough.  I have learned to love better.  I love you\nfor what you are, for what you were, for the ways even by which you have\nbecome.  I love you for the ways wherein you differ from what you call my\nclass, for your beliefs which I do not understand but which I know I can\ncome to understand.  I shall devote myself to understanding them.  And\neven your smoking and your swearing--they are part of you and I will love\nyou for them, too.  I can still learn.  In the last ten minutes I have\nlearned much.  That I have dared to come here is a token of what I have\nalready learned.  Oh, Martin!--\"\n\nShe was sobbing and nestling close against him.\n\nFor the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy, and she\nacknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face.\n\n\"It is too late,\" he said.  He remembered Lizzie's words.  \"I am a sick\nman--oh, not my body.  It is my soul, my brain.  I seem to have lost all\nvalues.  I care for nothing.  If you had been this way a few months ago,\nit would have been different.  It is too late, now.\"\n\n\"It is not too late,\" she cried.  \"I will show you.  I will prove to you\nthat my love has grown, that it is greater to me than my class and all\nthat is dearest to me.  All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will\nflout.  I am no longer afraid of life.  I will leave my father and\nmother, and let my name become a by-word with my friends.  I will come to\nyou here and now, in free love if you will, and I will be proud and glad\nto be with you.  If I have been a traitor to love, I will now, for love's\nsake, be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason.\"\n\nShe stood before him, with shining eyes.\n\n\"I am waiting, Martin,\" she whispered, \"waiting for you to accept me.\nLook at me.\"\n\nIt was splendid, he thought, looking at her.  She had redeemed herself\nfor all that she had lacked, rising up at last, true woman, superior to\nthe iron rule of bourgeois convention.  It was splendid, magnificent,\ndesperate.  And yet, what was the matter with him?  He was not thrilled\nnor stirred by what she had done.  It was splendid and magnificent only\nintellectually.  In what should have been a moment of fire, he coldly\nappraised her.  His heart was untouched.  He was unaware of any desire\nfor her.  Again he remembered Lizzie's words.\n\n\"I am sick, very sick,\" he said with a despairing gesture.  \"How sick I\ndid not know till now.  Something has gone out of me.  I have always been\nunafraid of life, but I never dreamed of being sated with life.  Life has\nso filled me that I am empty of any desire for anything.  If there were\nroom, I should want you, now.  You see how sick I am.\"\n\nHe leaned his head back and closed his eyes; and like a child, crying,\nthat forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the\ntear-dimmed films over the pupils, so Martin forgot his sickness, the\npresence of Ruth, everything, in watching the masses of vegetation, shot\nthrough hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this\nbackground of his eyelids.  It was not restful, that green foliage.  The\nsunlight was too raw and glaring.  It hurt him to look at it, and yet he\nlooked, he knew not why.\n\nHe was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door-knob.  Ruth was\nat the door.\n\n\"How shall I get out?\" she questioned tearfully.  \"I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh, forgive me,\" he cried, springing to his feet.  \"I'm not myself, you\nknow.  I forgot you were here.\"  He put his hand to his head.  \"You see,\nI'm not just right.  I'll take you home.  We can go out by the servants'\nentrance.  No one will see us.  Pull down that veil and everything will\nbe all right.\"\n\nShe clung to his arm through the dim-lighted passages and down the narrow\nstairs.\n\n\"I am safe now,\" she said, when they emerged on the sidewalk, at the same\ntime starting to take her hand from his arm.\n\n\"No, no, I'll see you home,\" he answered.\n\n\"No, please don't,\" she objected.  \"It is unnecessary.\"\n\nAgain she started to remove her hand.  He felt a momentary curiosity.  Now\nthat she was out of danger she was afraid.  She was in almost a panic to\nbe quit of him.  He could see no reason for it and attributed it to her\nnervousness.  So he restrained her withdrawing hand and started to walk\non with her.  Halfway down the block, he saw a man in a long overcoat\nshrink back into a doorway.  He shot a glance in as he passed by, and,\ndespite the high turned-up collar, he was certain that he recognized\nRuth's brother, Norman.\n\nDuring the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation.  She was\nstunned.  He was apathetic.  Once, he mentioned that he was going away,\nback to the South Seas, and, once, she asked him to forgive her having\ncome to him.  And that was all.  The parting at her door was\nconventional.  They shook hands, said good night, and he lifted his hat.\nThe door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his\nhotel.  When he came to the doorway into which he had seen Norman shrink,\nhe stopped and looked in in a speculative humor.\n\n\"She lied,\" he said aloud.  \"She made believe to me that she had dared\ngreatly, and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was\nwaiting to take her back.\"  He burst into laughter.  \"Oh, these\nbourgeois!  When I was broke, I was not fit to be seen with his sister.\nWhen I have a bank account, he brings her to me.\"\n\nAs he swung on his heel to go on, a tramp, going in the same direction,\nbegged him over his shoulder.\n\n\"Say, mister, can you give me a quarter to get a bed?\" were the words.\n\nBut it was the voice that made Martin turn around.  The next instant he\nhad Joe by the hand.\n\n\"D'ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs?\" the other was\nsaying.  \"I said then we'd meet again.  I felt it in my bones.  An' here\nwe are.\"\n\n\"You're looking good,\" Martin said admiringly, \"and you've put on\nweight.\"\n\n\"I sure have.\"  Joe's face was beaming.  \"I never knew what it was to\nlive till I hit hoboin'.  I'm thirty pounds heavier an' feel tiptop all\nthe time.  Why, I was worked to skin an' bone in them old days.  Hoboin'\nsure agrees with me.\"\n\n\"But you're looking for a bed just the same,\" Martin chided, \"and it's a\ncold night.\"\n\n\"Huh?  Lookin' for a bed?\"  Joe shot a hand into his hip pocket and\nbrought it out filled with small change.  \"That beats hard graft,\" he\nexulted.  \"You just looked good; that's why I battered you.\"\n\nMartin laughed and gave in.\n\n\"You've several full-sized drunks right there,\" he insinuated.\n\nJoe slid the money back into his pocket.\n\n\"Not in mine,\" he announced.  \"No gettin' oryide for me, though there\nain't nothin' to stop me except I don't want to.  I've ben drunk once\nsince I seen you last, an' then it was unexpected, bein' on an empty\nstomach.  When I work like a beast, I drink like a beast.  When I live\nlike a man, I drink like a man--a jolt now an' again when I feel like it,\nan' that's all.\"\n\nMartin arranged to meet him next day, and went on to the hotel.  He\npaused in the office to look up steamer sailings.  The Mariposa sailed\nfor Tahiti in five days.\n\n\"Telephone over to-morrow and reserve a stateroom for me,\" he told the\nclerk.  \"No deck-stateroom, but down below, on the weather-side,--the\nport-side, remember that, the port-side.  You'd better write it down.\"\n\nOnce in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as a\nchild.  The occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him.  His\nmind was dead to impressions.  The glow of warmth with which he met Joe\nhad been most fleeting.  The succeeding minute he had been bothered by\nthe ex-laundryman's presence and by the compulsion of conversation.  That\nin five more days he sailed for his loved South Seas meant nothing to\nhim.  So he closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for eight\nuninterrupted hours.  He was not restless.  He did not change his\nposition, nor did he dream.  Sleep had become to him oblivion, and each\nday that he awoke, he awoke with regret.  Life worried and bored him, and\ntime was a vexation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n\n\"Say, Joe,\" was his greeting to his old-time working-mate next morning,\n\"there's a Frenchman out on Twenty-eighth Street.  He's made a pot of\nmoney, and he's going back to France.  It's a dandy, well-appointed,\nsmall steam laundry.  There's a start for you if you want to settle down.\nHere, take this; buy some clothes with it and be at this man's office by\nten o'clock.  He looked up the laundry for me, and he'll take you out and\nshow you around.  If you like it, and think it is worth the price--twelve\nthousand--let me know and it is yours.  Now run along.  I'm busy.  I'll\nsee you later.\"\n\n\"Now look here, Mart,\" the other said slowly, with kindling anger, \"I\ncome here this mornin' to see you.  Savve?  I didn't come here to get no\nlaundry.  I come a here for a talk for old friends' sake, and you shove a\nlaundry at me.  I tell you, what you can do.  You can take that laundry\nan' go to hell.\"\n\nHe was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around.\n\n\"Now look here, Joe,\" he said; \"if you act that way, I'll punch your\nhead.  An for old friends' sake I'll punch it hard.  Savve?--you will,\nwill you?\"\n\nJoe had clinched and attempted to throw him, and he was twisting and\nwrithing out of the advantage of the other's hold.  They reeled about the\nroom, locked in each other's arms, and came down with a crash across the\nsplintered wreckage of a wicker chair.  Joe was underneath, with arms\nspread out and held and with Martin's knee on his chest.  He was panting\nand gasping for breath when Martin released him.\n\n\"Now we'll talk a moment,\" Martin said.  \"You can't get fresh with me.  I\nwant that laundry business finished first of all.  Then you can come back\nand we'll talk for old sake's sake.  I told you I was busy.  Look at\nthat.\"\n\nA servant had just come in with the morning mail, a great mass of letters\nand magazines.\n\n\"How can I wade through that and talk with you?  You go and fix up that\nlaundry, and then we'll get together.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Joe admitted reluctantly.  \"I thought you was turnin' me\ndown, but I guess I was mistaken.  But you can't lick me, Mart, in a\nstand-up fight.  I've got the reach on you.\"\n\n\"We'll put on the gloves sometime and see,\" Martin said with a smile.\n\n\"Sure; as soon as I get that laundry going.\"  Joe extended his arm.  \"You\nsee that reach?  It'll make you go a few.\"\n\nMartin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the\nlaundryman.  He was becoming anti-social.  Daily he found it a severer\nstrain to be decent with people.  Their presence perturbed him, and the\neffort of conversation irritated him.  They made him restless, and no\nsooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about for excuses\nto get rid of them.\n\nHe did not proceed to attack his mail, and for a half hour he lolled in\nhis chair, doing nothing, while no more than vague, half-formed thoughts\noccasionally filtered through his intelligence, or rather, at wide\nintervals, themselves constituted the flickering of his intelligence.\n\nHe roused himself and began glancing through his mail.  There were a\ndozen requests for autographs--he knew them at sight; there were\nprofessional begging letters; and there were letters from cranks, ranging\nfrom the man with a working model of perpetual motion, and the man who\ndemonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of a hollow\nsphere, to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the Peninsula of\nLower California for the purpose of communist colonization.  There were\nletters from women seeking to know him, and over one such he smiled, for\nenclosed was her receipt for pew-rent, sent as evidence of her good faith\nand as proof of her respectability.\n\nEditors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters, the\nformer on their knees for his manuscripts, the latter on their knees for\nhis books--his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he possessed\nin pawn for so many dreary months in order to fund them in postage.  There\nwere unexpected checks for English serial rights and for advance payments\non foreign translations.  His English agent announced the sale of German\ntranslation rights in three of his books, and informed him that Swedish\neditions, from which he could expect nothing because Sweden was not a\nparty to the Berne Convention, were already on the market.  Then there\nwas a nominal request for his permission for a Russian translation, that\ncountry being likewise outside the Berne Convention.\n\nHe turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his\npress bureau, and read about himself and his vogue, which had become a\nfurore.  All his creative output had been flung to the public in one\nmagnificent sweep.  That seemed to account for it.  He had taken the\npublic off its feet, the way Kipling had, that time when he lay near to\ndeath and all the mob, animated by a mob-mind thought, began suddenly to\nread him.  Martin remembered how that same world-mob, having read him and\nacclaimed him and not understood him in the least, had, abruptly, a few\nmonths later, flung itself upon him and torn him to pieces.  Martin\ngrinned at the thought.  Who was he that he should not be similarly\ntreated in a few more months?  Well, he would fool the mob.  He would be\naway, in the South Seas, building his grass house, trading for pearls and\ncopra, jumping reefs in frail outriggers, catching sharks and bonitas,\nhunting wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay next to the\nvalley of Taiohae.\n\nIn the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned\nupon him.  He saw, cleared eyed, that he was in the Valley of the Shadow.\nAll the life that was in him was fading, fainting, making toward death.\n\nHe realized how much he slept, and how much he desired to sleep.  Of old,\nhe had hated sleep.  It had robbed him of precious moments of living.\nFour hours of sleep in the twenty-four had meant being robbed of four\nhours of life.  How he had grudged sleep!  Now it was life he grudged.\nLife was not good; its taste in his mouth was without tang, and bitter.\nThis was his peril.  Life that did not yearn toward life was in fair way\ntoward ceasing.  Some remote instinct for preservation stirred in him,\nand he knew he must get away.  He glanced about the room, and the thought\nof packing was burdensome.  Perhaps it would be better to leave that to\nthe last.  In the meantime he might be getting an outfit.\n\nHe put on his hat and went out, stopping in at a gun-store, where he\nspent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles, ammunition,\nand fishing tackle.  Fashions changed in trading, and he knew he would\nhave to wait till he reached Tahiti before ordering his trade-goods.  They\ncould come up from Australia, anyway.  This solution was a source of\npleasure.  He had avoided doing something, and the doing of anything just\nnow was unpleasant.  He went back to the hotel gladly, with a feeling of\nsatisfaction in that the comfortable Morris chair was waiting for him;\nand he groaned inwardly, on entering his room, at sight of Joe in the\nMorris chair.\n\nJoe was delighted with the laundry.  Everything was settled, and he would\nenter into possession next day.  Martin lay on the bed, with closed eyes,\nwhile the other talked on.  Martin's thoughts were far away--so far away\nthat he was rarely aware that he was thinking.  It was only by an effort\nthat he occasionally responded.  And yet this was Joe, whom he had always\nliked.  But Joe was too keen with life.  The boisterous impact of it on\nMartin's jaded mind was a hurt.  It was an aching probe to his tired\nsensitiveness.  When Joe reminded him that sometime in the future they\nwere going to put on the gloves together, he could almost have screamed.\n\n\"Remember, Joe, you're to run the laundry according to those old rules\nyou used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs,\" he said.  \"No overworking.\nNo working at night.  And no children at the mangles.  No children\nanywhere.  And a fair wage.\"\n\nJoe nodded and pulled out a note-book.\n\n\"Look at here.  I was workin' out them rules before breakfast this A.M.\nWhat d'ye think of them?\"\n\nHe read them aloud, and Martin approved, worrying at the same time as to\nwhen Joe would take himself off.\n\nIt was late afternoon when he awoke.  Slowly the fact of life came back\nto him.  He glanced about the room.  Joe had evidently stolen away after\nhe had dozed off.  That was considerate of Joe, he thought.  Then he\nclosed his eyes and slept again.\n\nIn the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking hold of\nthe laundry to bother him much; and it was not until the day before\nsailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken\npassage on the Mariposa.  Once, when the instinct of preservation\nfluttered, he went to a doctor and underwent a searching physical\nexamination.  Nothing could be found the matter with him.  His heart and\nlungs were pronounced magnificent.  Every organ, so far as the doctor\ncould know, was normal and was working normally.\n\n\"There is nothing the matter with you, Mr. Eden,\" he said, \"positively\nnothing the matter with you.  You are in the pink of condition.  Candidly,\nI envy you your health.  It is superb.  Look at that chest.  There, and\nin your stomach, lies the secret of your remarkable constitution.\nPhysically, you are a man in a thousand--in ten thousand.  Barring\naccidents, you should live to be a hundred.\"\n\nAnd Martin knew that Lizzie's diagnosis had been correct.  Physically he\nwas all right.  It was his \"think-machine\" that had gone wrong, and there\nwas no cure for that except to get away to the South Seas.  The trouble\nwas that now, on the verge of departure, he had no desire to go.  The\nSouth Seas charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization.  There\nwas no zest in the thought of departure, while the act of departure\nappalled him as a weariness of the flesh.  He would have felt better if\nhe were already on board and gone.\n\nThe last day was a sore trial.  Having read of his sailing in the morning\npapers, Bernard Higginbotham, Gertrude, and all the family came to say\ngood-by, as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian.  Then there was business\nto be transacted, bills to be paid, and everlasting reporters to be\nendured.  He said good-by to Lizzie Connolly, abruptly, at the entrance\nto night school, and hurried away.  At the hotel he found Joe, too busy\nall day with the laundry to have come to him earlier.  It was the last\nstraw, but Martin gripped the arms of his chair and talked and listened\nfor half an hour.\n\n\"You know, Joe,\" he said, \"that you are not tied down to that laundry.\nThere are no strings on it.  You can sell it any time and blow the money.\nAny time you get sick of it and want to hit the road, just pull out.  Do\nwhat will make you the happiest.\"\n\nJoe shook his head.\n\n\"No more road in mine, thank you kindly.  Hoboin's all right, exceptin'\nfor one thing--the girls.  I can't help it, but I'm a ladies' man.  I\ncan't get along without 'em, and you've got to get along without 'em when\nyou're hoboin'.  The times I've passed by houses where dances an' parties\nwas goin' on, an' heard the women laugh, an' saw their white dresses and\nsmiling faces through the windows--Gee!  I tell you them moments was\nplain hell.  I like dancin' an' picnics, an' walking in the moonlight,\nan' all the rest too well.  Me for the laundry, and a good front, with\nbig iron dollars clinkin' in my jeans.  I seen a girl already, just\nyesterday, and, d'ye know, I'm feelin' already I'd just as soon marry her\nas not.  I've ben whistlin' all day at the thought of it.  She's a beaut,\nwith the kindest eyes and softest voice you ever heard.  Me for her, you\ncan stack on that.  Say, why don't you get married with all this money to\nburn?  You could get the finest girl in the land.\"\n\nMartin shook his head with a smile, but in his secret heart he was\nwondering why any man wanted to marry.  It seemed an amazing and\nincomprehensible thing.\n\nFrom the deck of the Mariposa, at the sailing hour, he saw Lizzie\nConnolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf.  Take her with\nyou, came the thought.  It is easy to be kind.  She will be supremely\nhappy.  It was almost a temptation one moment, and the succeeding moment\nit became a terror.  He was in a panic at the thought of it.  His tired\nsoul cried out in protest.  He turned away from the rail with a groan,\nmuttering, \"Man, you are too sick, you are too sick.\"\n\nHe fled to his stateroom, where he lurked until the steamer was clear of\nthe dock.  In the dining saloon, at luncheon, he found himself in the\nplace of honor, at the captain's right; and he was not long in\ndiscovering that he was the great man on board.  But no more\nunsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship.  He spent the afternoon\nin a deck-chair, with closed eyes, dozing brokenly most of the time, and\nin the evening went early to bed.\n\nAfter the second day, recovered from seasickness, the full passenger list\nwas in evidence, and the more he saw of the passengers the more he\ndisliked them.  Yet he knew that he did them injustice.  They were good\nand kindly people, he forced himself to acknowledge, and in the moment of\nacknowledgment he qualified--good and kindly like all the bourgeoisie,\nwith all the psychological cramp and intellectual futility of their kind,\nthey bored him when they talked with him, their little superficial minds\nwere so filled with emptiness; while the boisterous high spirits and the\nexcessive energy of the younger people shocked him.  They were never\nquiet, ceaselessly playing deck-quoits, tossing rings, promenading, or\nrushing to the rail with loud cries to watch the leaping porpoises and\nthe first schools of flying fish.\n\nHe slept much.  After breakfast he sought his deck-chair with a magazine\nhe never finished.  The printed pages tired him.  He puzzled that men\nfound so much to write about, and, puzzling, dozed in his chair.  When\nthe gong awoke him for luncheon, he was irritated that he must awaken.\nThere was no satisfaction in being awake.\n\nOnce, he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward into\nthe forecastle with the sailors.  But the breed of sailors seemed to have\nchanged since the days he had lived in the forecastle.  He could find no\nkinship with these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial creatures.  He was in\ndespair.  Up above nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own sake, and he\ncould not go back to those of his own class who had wanted him in the\npast.  He did not want them.  He could not stand them any more than he\ncould stand the stupid first-cabin passengers and the riotous young\npeople.\n\nLife was to him like strong, white light that hurts the tired eyes of a\nsick person.  During every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare\naround him and upon him.  It hurt.  It hurt intolerably.  It was the\nfirst time in his life that Martin had travelled first class.  On ships\nat sea he had always been in the forecastle, the steerage, or in the\nblack depths of the coal-hold, passing coal.  In those days, climbing up\nthe iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat, he had often caught\nglimpses of the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing but enjoy\nthemselves, under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them,\nwith subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim, and\nit had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their\nbeing was nothing else than paradise.  Well, here he was, the great man\non board, in the midmost centre of it, sitting at the captain's right\nhand, and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stoke-hole in quest\nof the Paradise he had lost.  He had found no new one, and now he could\nnot find the old one.\n\nHe strove to stir himself and find something to interest him.  He\nventured the petty officers' mess, and was glad to get away.  He talked\nwith a quartermaster off duty, an intelligent man who promptly prodded\nhim with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of\nleaflets and pamphlets.  He listened to the man expounding the\nslave-morality, and as he listened, he thought languidly of his own\nNietzsche philosophy.  But what was it worth, after all?  He remembered\none of Nietzsche's mad utterances wherein that madman had doubted truth.\nAnd who was to say?  Perhaps Nietzsche had been right.  Perhaps there was\nno truth in anything, no truth in truth--no such thing as truth.  But his\nmind wearied quickly, and he was content to go back to his chair and\ndoze.\n\nMiserable as he was on the steamer, a new misery came upon him.  What\nwhen the steamer reached Tahiti?  He would have to go ashore.  He would\nhave to order his trade-goods, to find a passage on a schooner to the\nMarquesas, to do a thousand and one things that were awful to\ncontemplate.  Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think, he could\nsee the desperate peril in which he stood.  In all truth, he was in the\nValley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he was not afraid.  If\nhe were only afraid, he would make toward life.  Being unafraid, he was\ndrifting deeper into the shadow.  He found no delight in the old familiar\nthings of life.  The Mariposa was now in the northeast trades, and this\nwine of wind, surging against him, irritated him.  He had his chair moved\nto escape the embrace of this lusty comrade of old days and nights.\n\nThe day the Mariposa entered the doldrums, Martin was more miserable than\never.  He could no longer sleep.  He was soaked with sleep, and perforce\nhe must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life.  He moved\nabout restlessly.  The air was sticky and humid, and the rain-squalls\nwere unrefreshing.  He ached with life.  He walked around the deck until\nthat hurt too much, then sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk\nagain.  He forced himself at last to finish the magazine, and from the\nsteamer library he culled several volumes of poetry.  But they could not\nhold him, and once more he took to walking.\n\nHe stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him, for when\nhe went below, he could not sleep.  This surcease from life had failed\nhim.  It was too much.  He turned on the electric light and tried to\nread.  One of the volumes was a Swinburne.  He lay in bed, glancing\nthrough its pages, until suddenly he became aware that he was reading\nwith interest.  He finished the stanza, attempted to read on, then came\nback to it.  He rested the book face downward on his breast and fell to\nthinking.  That was it.  The very thing.  Strange that it had never come\nto him before.  That was the meaning of it all; he had been drifting that\nway all the time, and now Swinburne showed him that it was the happy way\nout.  He wanted rest, and here was rest awaiting him.  He glanced at the\nopen port-hole.  Yes, it was large enough.  For the first time in weeks\nhe felt happy.  At last he had discovered the cure of his ill.  He picked\nup the book and read the stanza slowly aloud:-\n\n   \"'From too much love of living,\n   From hope and fear set free,\n   We thank with brief thanksgiving\n   Whatever gods may be\n   That no life lives forever;\n   That dead men rise up never;\n   That even the weariest river\n   Winds somewhere safe to sea.'\"\n\nHe looked again at the open port.  Swinburne had furnished the key.  Life\nwas ill, or, rather, it had become ill--an unbearable thing.  \"That dead\nmen rise up never!\"  That line stirred him with a profound feeling of\ngratitude.  It was the one beneficent thing in the universe.  When life\nbecame an aching weariness, death was ready to soothe away to everlasting\nsleep.  But what was he waiting for?  It was time to go.\n\nHe arose and thrust his head out the port-hole, looking down into the\nmilky wash.  The Mariposa was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his hands,\nhis feet would be in the water.  He could slip in noiselessly.  No one\nwould hear.  A smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face.  It tasted\nsalt on his lips, and the taste was good.  He wondered if he ought to\nwrite a swan-song, but laughed the thought away.  There was no time.  He\nwas too impatient to be gone.\n\nTurning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him, he\nwent out the port-hole feet first.  His shoulders stuck, and he forced\nhimself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side.  A roll of\nthe steamer aided him, and he was through, hanging by his hands.  When\nhis feet touched the sea, he let go.  He was in a milky froth of water.\nThe side of the Mariposa rushed past him like a dark wall, broken here\nand there by lighted ports.  She was certainly making time.  Almost\nbefore he knew it, he was astern, swimming gently on the foam-crackling\nsurface.\n\nA bonita struck at his white body, and he laughed aloud.  It had taken a\npiece out, and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there.  In the\nwork to do he had forgotten the purpose of it.  The lights of the\nMariposa were growing dim in the distance, and there he was, swimming\nconfidently, as though it were his intention to make for the nearest land\na thousand miles or so away.\n\nIt was the automatic instinct to live.  He ceased swimming, but the\nmoment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out\nsharply with a lifting movement.  The will to live, was his thought, and\nthe thought was accompanied by a sneer.  Well, he had will,--ay, will\nstrong enough that with one last exertion it could destroy itself and\ncease to be.\n\nHe changed his position to a vertical one.  He glanced up at the quiet\nstars, at the same time emptying his lungs of air.  With swift, vigorous\npropulsion of hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders and half his chest\nout of water.  This was to gain impetus for the descent.  Then he let\nhimself go and sank without movement, a white statue, into the sea.  He\nbreathed in the water deeply, deliberately, after the manner of a man\ntaking an anaesthetic.  When he strangled, quite involuntarily his arms\nand legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into the\nclear sight of the stars.\n\nThe will to live, he thought disdainfully, vainly endeavoring not to\nbreathe the air into his bursting lungs.  Well, he would have to try a\nnew way.  He filled his lungs with air, filled them full.  This supply\nwould take him far down.  He turned over and went down head first,\nswimming with all his strength and all his will.  Deeper and deeper he\nwent.  His eyes were open, and he watched the ghostly, phosphorescent\ntrails of the darting bonita.  As he swam, he hoped that they would not\nstrike at him, for it might snap the tension of his will.  But they did\nnot strike, and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of\nlife.\n\nDown, down, he swam till his arms and leg grew tired and hardly moved.  He\nknew that he was deep.  The pressure on his ear-drums was a pain, and\nthere was a buzzing in his head.  His endurance was faltering, but he\ncompelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped\nand the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush.  The bubbles\nrubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks and eyes as they\ntook their upward flight.  Then came pain and strangulation.  This hurt\nwas not death, was the thought that oscillated through his reeling\nconsciousness.  Death did not hurt.  It was life, the pangs of life, this\nawful, suffocating feeling; it was the last blow life could deal him.\n\nHis wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically\nand feebly.  But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them\nbeat and churn.  He was too deep down.  They could never bring him to the\nsurface.  He seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision.  Colors\nand radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him.  What was\nthat?  It seemed a lighthouse; but it was inside his brain--a flashing,\nbright white light.  It flashed swifter and swifter.  There was a long\nrumble of sound, and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and\ninterminable stairway.  And somewhere at the bottom he fell into\ndarkness.  That much he knew.  He had fallen into darkness.  And at the\ninstant he knew, he ceased to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MARTIN EDEN***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 1056.txt or 1056.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/0\/5\/1056\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":204,"split":"train"}
