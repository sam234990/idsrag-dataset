{"ori_id":"ca4b98f54a313ac59b7da739f8a3d7454c271193","title":"The Claverings","context":"The Claverings\n Harry Clavering is the only son of Reverend Henry Clavering, a well-to-do clergyman and the paternal uncle of the affluent baronet Sir Hugh Clavering. At the novel's beginning, Harry is jilted by his fianc\u0102\u0160e, the sister of Sir Hugh's wife, who proceeds to marry Lord Ongar, a wealthy but debauched earl.\nHarry's father urges him to make the church his profession; but Harry aspires to become a civil engineer, of the type of Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke, and Thomas Brassey. To this end, he becomes a pupil at the firm of Beilby and Burton.\nA year and a half later, Harry has become engaged to Florence Burton, the daughter of one of his employers. He presses her for an early marriage; but although she loves him deeply, she refuses, insisting that they wait until he has an income adequate to support himself and a family.\nAt this point, Lord Ongar dies, and his widow returns to England. Sir Hugh, her nearest male relative, is a hard and selfish man, and refuses to see her upon her arrival. This lends spurious credence to rumours about her conduct; and it forces her sister, Lady Clavering, to ask Harry to assist her when she returns.\nHarry fails to tell Lady Ongar of his engagement; and, in a moment of weakness, he embraces and kisses her. This puts him in a position where he must behave dishonourably toward one of the two women in his life: either he must break his engagement, or he must acknowledge that he has gravely insulted Lady Ongar. Although he loves Florence Burton and knows that she is the better woman, he is unwilling to subject Lady Ongar to further misery.\nLady Ongar, because of her considerable wealth, is pursued by others. She is courted by Count Pateroff, one of her late husband's friends, and by Archie Clavering, Sir Hugh's younger brother. Count Pateroff's scheming sister Sophie Gourdeloup, the only woman who will see Lady Ongar because of the rumours about her conduct, wants her to remain single so that Mme. Gourdeloup can continue to exploit her.\nMme. Gourdeloup sees to it that Lady Ongar learns about Harry's engagement. Meanwhile, Florence Burton learns that Harry has been seeing Lady Ongar regularly, and decides that she must release him if he does not truly love her.\nThrough the good influence of his mother, Harry comes to realise that Florence Burton is the better woman and the less deserving of dishonorable treatment. To her letter offering to end their engagement, he responds with a reaffirmation of his love for her. He also writes to Lady Ongar, regretting his past conduct toward her and making it clear that he intends to remain true to his fianc\u0102\u0160e.\nSoon thereafter, Sir Hugh and Archie Clavering are both drowned when their yacht goes down off Heligoland. This makes Harry's father the new baronet and the possessor of Clavering Park, with Harry the heir apparent. This increase in wealth allows him to marry immediately and to give up engineering, a profession for which he almost certainly lacked sufficient self-discipline. Lady Ongar gives up much of her property to the family of the new earl, and retires into seclusion with her widowed sister.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Claverings, by Anthony Trollope,\nIllustrated by Mary Ellen Edwards\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

CHAPTER XLVII.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nJULIA BRABAZON.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nThe gardens of Clavering Park were removed some three hundred yards\nfrom the large, square, sombre-looking stone mansion which was\nthe country-house of Sir Hugh Clavering, the eleventh baronet of\nthat name; and in these gardens, which had but little of beauty to\nrecommend them, I will introduce my readers to two of the personages\nwith whom I wish to make them acquainted in the following story. It\nwas now the end of August, and the parterres, beds, and bits of lawn\nwere dry, disfigured, and almost ugly, from the effects of a long\ndrought. In gardens to which care and labour are given abundantly,\nflower-beds will be pretty, and grass will be green, let the weather\nbe what it may; but care and labour were but scantily bestowed on the\nClavering Gardens, and everything was yellow, adust, harsh, and dry.\nOver the burnt turf towards a gate that led to the house, a lady was\nwalking, and by her side there walked a gentleman.\n\n\"You are going in, then, Miss Brabazon,\" said the gentleman, and it\nwas very manifest from his tone that he intended to convey some deep\nreproach in his words.\n\n\"Of course I am going in,\" said the lady. \"You asked me to walk with\nyou, and I refused. You have now waylaid me, and therefore I shall\nescape,--unless I am prevented by violence.\" As she spoke she stood\nstill for a moment, and looked into his face with a smile which\nseemed to indicate that if such violence were used, within rational\nbounds, she would not feel herself driven to great anger.\n\nBut though she might be inclined to be playful, he was by no means in\nthat mood. \"And why did you refuse me when I asked you?\" said he.\n\n\"For two reasons, partly because I thought it better to avoid any\nconversation with you.\"\n\n\"That is civil to an old friend.\"\n\n\"But chiefly,\"--and now as she spoke she drew herself up, and\ndismissed the smile from her face, and allowed her eyes to fall upon\nthe ground;--\"but chiefly because I thought that Lord Ongar would\nprefer that I should not roam alone about Clavering Park with any\nyoung gentleman while I am down here; and that he might specially\nobject to my roaming with you, were he to know that you and I\nwere--old acquaintances. Now I have been very frank, Mr. Clavering,\nand I think that that ought to be enough.\"\n\n\"You are afraid of him already, then?\"\n\n\"I am afraid of offending any one whom I love, and especially any one\nto whom I owe any duty.\"\n\n\"Enough! Indeed it is not. From what you know of me do you think it\nlikely that that will be enough?\" He was now standing in front of\nher, between her and the gate, and she made no effort to leave him.\n\n\"And what is it you want? I suppose you do not mean to fight Lord\nOngar, and that if you did you would not come to me.\"\n\n\"Fight him! No; I have no quarrel with him. Fighting him would do no\ngood.\"\n\n\"None in the least; and he would not fight if you were to ask him;\nand you could not ask him without being false to me.\"\n\n\"I should have had an example for that, at any rate.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Mr. Clavering. My falsehood, if you should choose\nto call me false, is of a very different nature, and is pardonable by\nall laws known to the world.\"\n\n\"You are a jilt,--that is all.\"\n\n\"Come, Harry, don't use hard words,\"--and she put her hand kindly\nupon his arm. \"Look at me, such as I am, and at yourself, and then\nsay whether anything but misery could come of a match between you\nand me. Our ages by the register are the same, but I am ten years\nolder than you by the world. I have two hundred a year, and I owe at\nthis moment six hundred pounds. You have, perhaps, double as much,\nand would lose half of that if you married. You are an usher at a\nschool.\"\n\n\"No, madam, I am not an usher at a school.\"\n\n\"Well, well, you know I don't mean to make you angry.\"\n\n\"At the present moment, I am a schoolmaster, and if I remained so, I\nmight fairly look forward to a liberal income. But I am going to give\nthat up.\"\n\n\"You will not be more fit for matrimony because you are going to give\nup your profession. Now Lord Ongar has--heaven knows what;--perhaps\nsixty thousand a year.\"\n\n\"In all my life I never heard such effrontery,--such barefaced,\nshameless worldliness!\"\n\n\"Why should I not love a man with a large income?\"\n\n\"He is old enough to be your father.\"\n\n\"He is thirty-six, and I am twenty-four.\"\n\n\"Thirty-six!\"\n\n\"There is the Peerage for you to look at. But, my dear Harry, do you\nnot know that you are perplexing me and yourself too, for nothing?\nI was fool enough when I came here from Nice, after papa's death, to\nlet you talk nonsense to me for a month or two.\"\n\n\"Did you or did you not swear that you loved me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Clavering, I did not imagine that your strength would have\ncondescended to take such advantage over the weakness of a woman.\nI remember no oaths of any kind, and what foolish assertions I may\nhave made, I am not going to repeat. It must have become manifest to\nyou during these two years that all that was a romance. If it be a\npleasure to you to look back to it, of that pleasure I cannot deprive\nyou. Perhaps I also may sometimes look back. But I shall never speak\nof that time again; and you, if you are as noble as I take you to be,\nwill not speak of it either. I know you would not wish to injure me.\"\n\n\"I would wish to save you from the misery you are bringing on\nyourself.\"\n\n\"In that you must allow me to look after myself. Lord Ongar certainly\nwants a wife, and I intend to be true to him,--and useful.\"\n\n\"How about love?\"\n\n\"And to love him, sir. Do you think that no man can win a woman's\nlove, unless he is filled to the brim with poetry, and has a neck\nlike Lord Byron, and is handsome like your worship? You are very\nhandsome, Harry, and you, too, should go into the market and make the\nbest of yourself. Why should you not learn to love some nice girl\nthat has money to assist you?\"\n\n\"Julia!\"\n\n\"No, sir; I will not be called Julia. If you do, I will be insulted,\nand leave you instantly. I may call you Harry, as being so much\nyounger,--though we were born in the same month,--and as a sort of\ncousin. But I shall never do that after to-day.\"\n\n\"You have courage enough, then, to tell me that you have not ill-used\nme?\"\n\n\"Certainly I have. Why, what a fool you would have me be! Look at me,\nand tell me whether I am fit to be the wife of such a one as you. By\nthe time you are entering the world, I shall be an old woman, and\nshall have lived my life. Even if I were fit to be your mate when\nwe were living here together, am I fit, after what I have done and\nseen during the last two years? Do you think it would really do\nany good to any one if I were to jilt, as you call it, Lord Ongar,\nand tell them all,--your cousin, Sir Hugh, and my sister, and your\nfather,--that I was going to keep myself up, and marry you when you\nwere ready for me?\"\n\n\"You mean to say that the evil is done.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. At the present moment I owe six hundred pounds, and I\ndon't know where to turn for it, so that my husband may not be dunned\nfor my debts as soon as he has married me. What a wife I should have\nbeen for you;--should I not?\"\n\n\"I could pay the six hundred pounds for you with money that I have\nearned myself,--though you do call me an usher;--and perhaps would\nask fewer questions about it than Lord Ongar will do with all his\nthousands.\"\n\n\"Dear Harry, I beg your pardon about the usher. Of course, I know\nthat you are a fellow of your college, and that St. Cuthbert's, where\nyou teach the boys, is one of the grandest schools in England; and I\nhope you'll be a bishop; nay,--I think you will, if you make up your\nmind to try for it.\"\n\n\"I have given up all idea of going into the church.\"\n\n\"Then you'll be a judge. I know you'll be great and distinguished,\nand that you'll do it all yourself. You are distinguished already. If\nyou could only know how infinitely I should prefer your lot to mine!\nOh, Harry, I envy you! I do envy you! You have got the ball at your\nfeet, and the world before you, and can win everything for yourself.\"\n\n\"But nothing is anything without your love.\"\n\n\"Psha! Love, indeed. What could I do for you but ruin you? You know\nit as well as I do; but you are selfish enough to wish to continue a\nromance which would be absolutely destructive to me, though for a\nwhile it might afford a pleasant relaxation to your graver studies.\nHarry, you can choose in the world. You have divinity, and law, and\nliterature, and art. And if debarred from love now by the exigencies\nof labour, you will be as fit for love in ten years' time as you are\nat present.\"\n\n\"But I do love now.\"\n\n\"Be a man, then, and keep it to yourself. Love is not to be our\nmaster. You can choose, as I say; but I have had no choice,--no\nchoice but to be married well, or to go out like a snuff of a candle.\nI don't like the snuff of a candle, and, therefore, I am going to be\nmarried well.\"\n\n\"And that suffices?\"\n\n\"It must suffice. And why should it not suffice? You are very\nuncivil, cousin, and very unlike the rest of the world. Everybody\ncompliments me on my marriage. Lord Ongar is not only rich, but he is\na man of fashion, and a man of talent.\"\n\n\"Are you fond of race-horses yourself?\"\n\n\"Very fond of them.\"\n\n\"And of that kind of life?\"\n\n\"Very fond of it. I mean to be fond of everything that Lord Ongar\nlikes. I know that I can't change him, and, therefore, I shall not\ntry.\"\n\n\"You are right there, Miss Brabazon.\"\n\n\"You mean to be impertinent, sir; but I will not take it so. This is\nto be our last meeting in private, and I won't acknowledge that I am\ninsulted. But it must be over now, Harry; and here I have been pacing\nround and round the garden with you, in spite of my refusal just now.\nIt must not be repeated, or things will be said which I do not mean\nto have ever said of me. Good-by, Harry.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Julia.\"\n\n\"Well, for that once let it pass. And remember this: I have told you\nall my hopes, and my one trouble. I have been thus open with you\nbecause I thought it might serve to make you look at things in a\nright light. I trust to your honour as a gentleman to repeat nothing\nthat I have said to you.\"\n\n\"I am not given to repeat such things as those.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you are not. And I hope you will not misunderstand the\nspirit in which they have been spoken. I shall never regret what I\nhave told you now, if it tends to make you perceive that we must both\nregard our past acquaintance as a romance, which must, from the stern\nnecessity of things, be treated as a dream which we have dreamt, or a\npoem which we have read.\"\n\n\"You can treat it as you please.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Harry; and I will always hope for your welfare, and\nhear of your success with joy. Will you come up and shoot with them\non Thursday?\"\n\n\"What, with Hugh? No; Hugh and I do not hit it off together. If I\nshot at Clavering I should have to do it as a sort of head-keeper.\nIt's a higher position, I know, than that of an usher, but it doesn't\nsuit me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry! that is so cruel! But you will come up to the house. Lord\nOngar will be there on the thirty-first; the day after to-morrow, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I must decline even that temptation. I never go into the house when\nHugh is there, except about twice a year on solemn invitation--just\nto prevent there being a family quarrel.\"\n\n\"Good-by, then,\" and she offered him her hand.\n\n\"Good-by, if it must be so.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether you mean to grace my marriage?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I shall be away from Clavering, so that the marriage\nbells may not wound my ears. For the matter of that, I shall be at\nthe school.\"\n\n\"I suppose we shall meet some day in town.\"\n\n\"Most probably not. My ways and Lord Ongar's will be altogether\ndifferent, even if I should succeed in getting up to London. If you\never come to see Hermione here, I may chance to meet you in the\nhouse. But you will not do that often, the place is so dull and\nunattractive.\"\n\n\"It is the dearest old park.\"\n\n\"You won't care much for old parks as Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"You don't know what I may care about as Lady Ongar; but as Julia\nBrabazon I will now say good-by for the last time.\" Then they parted,\nand the lady returned to the great house, while Harry Clavering made\nhis way across the park towards the rectory.\n\nThree years before this scene in the gardens at Clavering Park, Lord\nBrabazon had died at Nice, leaving one unmarried daughter, the lady\nto whom the reader has just been introduced. One other daughter he\nhad, who was then already married to Sir Hugh Clavering, and Lady\nClavering was the Hermione of whom mention has already been made.\nLord Brabazon, whose peerage had descended to him in a direct line\nfrom the time of the Plantagenets, was one of those unfortunate\nnobles of whom England is burdened with but few, who have no means\nequal to their rank. He had married late in life, and had died\nwithout a male heir. The title which had come from the Plantagenets\nwas now lapsed; and when the last lord died, about four hundred a\nyear was divided between his two daughters. The elder had already\nmade an excellent match, as regarded fortune, in marrying Sir Hugh\nClavering; and the younger was now about to make a much more splendid\nmatch in her alliance with Lord Ongar. Of them I do not know that it\nis necessary to say much more at present.\n\nAnd of Harry Clavering it perhaps may not be necessary to say much\nin the way of description. The attentive reader will have already\ngathered nearly all that should be known of him before he makes\nhimself known by his own deeds. He was the only son of the Reverend\nHenry Clavering, rector of Clavering, uncle of the present Sir Hugh\nClavering, and brother of the last Sir Hugh. The Reverend Henry\nClavering, and Mrs. Clavering his wife, and his two daughters, Mary\nand Fanny Clavering, lived always at Clavering Rectory, on the\noutskirts of Clavering Park, at a full mile's distance from the\nhouse. The church stood in the park, about midway between the two\nresidences. When I have named one more Clavering, Captain Clavering,\nCaptain Archibald Clavering, Sir Hugh's brother, and when I shall\nhave said also that both Sir Hugh and Captain Clavering were men fond\nof pleasure and fond of money, I shall have said all that I need now\nsay about the Clavering family at large.\n\nJulia Brabazon had indulged in some reminiscence of the romance of\nher past poetic life when she talked of cousinship between her and\nHarry Clavering. Her sister was the wife of Harry Clavering's first\ncousin, but between her and Harry there was no relationship whatever.\nWhen old Lord Brabazon had died at Nice she had come to Clavering\nPark, and had created some astonishment among those who knew Sir\nHugh by making good her footing in his establishment. He was not\nthe man to take up a wife's sister, and make his house her home,\nout of charity or from domestic love. Lady Clavering, who had been\na handsome woman and fashionable withal, no doubt may have had some\ninfluence; but Sir Hugh was a man much prone to follow his own\ncourses. It must be presumed that Julia Brabazon had made herself\nagreeable in the house, and also probably useful. She had been taken\nto London through two seasons, and had there held up her head among\nthe bravest. And she had been taken abroad,--for Sir Hugh did not\nlove Clavering Park, except during six weeks of partridge shooting;\nand she had been at Newmarket with them, and at the house of a\ncertain fast hunting duke with whom Sir Hugh was intimate; and at\nBrighton with her sister, when it suited Sir Hugh to remain alone at\nthe duke's; and then again up in London, where she finally arranged\nmatters with Lord Ongar. It was acknowledged by all the friends\nof the two families, and indeed I may say of the three families\nnow--among the Brabazon people, and the Clavering people, and the\nCourton people,--Lord Ongar's family name was Courton,--that Julia\nBrabazon had been very clever. Of her and Harry Clavering together no\none had ever said a word. If any words had been spoken between her\nand Hermione on the subject, the two sisters had been discreet enough\nto manage that they should go no further. In those short months of\nJulia's romance Sir Hugh had been away from Clavering, and Hermione\nhad been much occupied in giving birth to an heir. Julia had now\nlived past her one short spell of poetry, had written her one sonnet,\nand was prepared for the business of the world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHARRY CLAVERING CHOOSES HIS PROFESSION.\n\n\nHarry Clavering might not be an usher, but, nevertheless, he was\nhome for the holidays. And who can say where the usher ends and the\nschoolmaster begins? He, perhaps, may properly be called an usher,\nwho is hired by a private schoolmaster to assist himself in his\nprivate occupation, whereas Harry Clavering had been selected by a\npublic body out of a hundred candidates, with much real or pretended\nreference to certificates of qualification. He was certainly not an\nusher, as he was paid three hundred a year for his work,--which is\nquite beyond the mark of ushers. So much was certain; but yet the\nword stuck in his throat and made him uncomfortable. He did not like\nto reflect that he was home for the holidays.\n\nBut he had determined that he would never come home for the holidays\nagain. At Christmas he would leave the school at which he had won\nhis appointment with so much trouble, and go into an open profession.\nIndeed he had chosen his profession, and his mode of entering it. He\nwould become a civil engineer, and perhaps a land surveyor, and with\nthis view he would enter himself as a pupil in the great house of\nBeilby and Burton. The terms even had been settled. He was to pay a\npremium of five hundred pounds and join Mr. Burton, who was settled\nin the town of Stratton, for twelve months before he placed himself\nin Mr. Beilby's office in London. Stratton was less than twenty miles\nfrom Clavering. It was a comfort to him to think that he could pay\nthis five hundred pounds out of his own earnings, without troubling\nhis father. It was a comfort, even though he had earned that money by\n\"ushering\" for the last two years.\n\nWhen he left Julia Brabazon in the garden, Harry Clavering did not\ngo at once home to the rectory, but sauntered out all alone into the\npark, intending to indulge in reminiscences of his past romance. It\nwas all over, that idea of having Julia Brabazon for his love; and\nnow he had to ask himself whether he intended to be made permanently\nmiserable by her worldly falseness, or whether he would borrow\nsomething of her worldly wisdom, and agree with himself to look back\non what was past as a pleasurable excitement in his boyhood. Of\ncourse we all know that really permanent misery was in truth out of\nthe question. Nature had not made him physically or mentally so poor\na creature as to be incapable of a cure. But on this occasion he\ndecided on permanent misery. There was about his heart,--about his\nactual anatomical heart, with its internal arrangement of valves\nand blood-vessels,--a heavy dragging feeling that almost amounted\nto corporeal pain, and which he described to himself as agony. Why\nshould this rich, debauched, disreputable lord have the power of\ntaking the cup from his lip, the one morsel of bread which he coveted\nfrom his mouth, his one ingot of treasure out of his coffer? Fight\nhim! No, he knew he could not fight Lord Ongar. The world was against\nsuch an arrangement. And in truth Harry Clavering had so much\ncontempt for Lord Ongar, that he had no wish to fight so poor a\ncreature. The man had had delirium tremens, and was a worn-out\nmiserable object. So at least Harry Clavering was only too ready to\nbelieve. He did not care much for Lord Ongar in the matter. His anger\nwas against her;--that she should have deserted him for a miserable\ncreature, who had nothing to back him but wealth and rank!\n\nThere was wretchedness in every view of the matter. He loved her so\nwell, and yet he could do nothing! He could take no step towards\nsaving her or assisting himself. The marriage bells would ring within\na month from the present time, and his own father would go to the\nchurch and marry them. Unless Lord Ongar were to die before then\nby God's hand, there could be no escape,--and of such escape Harry\nClavering had no thought. He felt a weary, dragging soreness at his\nheart, and told himself that he must be miserable for ever,--not so\nmiserable but what he would work, but so wretched that the world\ncould have for him no satisfaction.\n\nWhat could he do? What thing could he achieve so that she should\nknow that he did not let her go from him without more thought than\nhis poor words had expressed? He was perfectly aware that in their\nconversation she had had the best of the argument,--that he had\ntalked almost like a boy, while she had talked quite like a woman.\nShe had treated him de haut en bas with all that superiority which\nyouth and beauty give to a young woman over a very young man. What\ncould he do? Before he returned to the rectory, he had made up his\nmind what he would do, and on the following morning Julia Brabazon\nreceived by the hands of her maid the following note:--\n\n\"I think I understood all that you said to me yesterday. At any\nrate, I understand that you have one trouble left, and that I have\nthe means of curing it.\" In the first draft of his letter he said\nsomething about ushering, but that he omitted afterwards. \"You may be\nassured that the enclosed is all my own, and that it is entirely at\nmy own disposal. You may also be quite sure of good faith on the part\nof the lender.--H. C.\" And in this letter he enclosed a cheque for\nsix hundred pounds. It was the money which he had saved since he\ntook his degree, and had been intended for Messrs. Beilby and Burton.\nBut he would wait another two years,--continuing to do his ushering\nfor her sake. What did it matter to a man who must, under any\ncircumstances, be permanently miserable?\n\nSir Hugh was not yet at Clavering. He was to come with Lord Ongar\non the eve of the partridge-shooting. The two sisters, therefore,\nhad the house all to themselves. At about twelve they sat down to\nbreakfast together in a little upstairs chamber adjoining Lady\nClavering's own room, Julia Brabazon at that time having her lover's\ngenerous letter in her pocket. She knew that it was as improper as it\nwas generous, and that, moreover, it was very dangerous. There was no\nknowing what might be the result of such a letter should Lord Ongar\neven know that she had received it. She was not absolutely angry\nwith Harry, but had, to herself, twenty times called him a foolish,\nindiscreet, dear generous boy. But what was she to do with the\ncheque? As to that, she had hardly as yet made up her mind when she\njoined her sister on the morning in question. Even to Hermione she\ndid not dare to tell the fact that such a letter had been received by\nher.\n\nBut in truth her debts were a great torment to her; and yet how\ntrifling they were when compared with the wealth of the man who\nwas to become her husband in six weeks! Let her marry him, and not\npay them, and he probably would never be the wiser. They would get\nthemselves paid almost without his knowledge, perhaps altogether\nwithout his hearing of them. But yet she feared him, knowing him to\nbe greedy about money; and, to give her such merit as was due to\nher, she felt the meanness of going to her husband with debts on\nher shoulder. She had five thousand pounds of her own; but the very\nsettlement which gave her a noble dower, and which made the marriage\nso brilliant, made over this small sum in its entirety to her lord.\nShe had been wrong not to tell the lawyer of her trouble when he had\nbrought the paper for her to sign; but she had not told him. If Sir\nHugh Clavering had been her own brother there would have been no\ndifficulty, but he was only her brother-in-law, and she feared to\nspeak to him. Her sister, however, knew that there were debts, and on\nthat subject she was not afraid to speak to Hermione.\n\n\"Hermy,\" said she, \"what am I to do about this money that I owe? I\ngot a bill from Colclugh's this morning.\"\n\n\"Just because he knows you're going to be married; that's all.\"\n\n\"But how am I to pay him?\"\n\n\"Take no notice of it till next spring. I don't know what else you\ncan do. You'll be sure to have money when you come back from the\nContinent.\"\n\n\"You couldn't lend it me; could you?\"\n\n\"Who? I? Did you ever know me have any money in hand since I was\nmarried? I have the name of an allowance, but it is always spent\nbefore it comes to me, and I am always in debt.\"\n\n\"Would Hugh--let me have it?\"\n\n\"What, give it you?\"\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't be so very much for him. I never asked him for a\npound yet.\"\n\n\"I think he would say something you wouldn't like if you were to ask\nhim; but, of course, you can try it if you please.\"\n\n\"Then what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Lord Ongar should have let you keep your own fortune. It would have\nbeen nothing to him.\"\n\n\"Hugh didn't let you keep your own fortune.\"\n\n\"But the money which will be nothing to Lord Ongar was a good deal to\nHugh. You're going to have sixty thousand a year, while we have to\ndo with seven or eight. Besides, I hadn't been out in London, and it\nwasn't likely I should owe much in Nice. He did ask me, and there was\nsomething.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, Hermy?\"\n\n\"Write and ask Lord Ongar to let you have what you want out of your\nown money. Write to-day, so that he may get your letter before he\ncomes.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! oh, dear! I never wrote a word to him yet, and to begin\nwith asking him for money!\"\n\n\"I don't think he can be angry with you for that.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't know what to say. Would you write it for me, and let me\nsee how it looks?\"\n\nThis Lady Clavering did; and had she refused to do it, I think that\npoor Harry Clavering's cheque would have been used. As it was, Lady\nClavering wrote the letter to \"My dear Lord Ongar,\" and it was copied\nand signed by \"Yours most affectionately, Julia Brabazon.\" The effect\nof this was the receipt of a cheque for a thousand pounds in a very\npretty note from Lord Ongar, which the lord brought with him to\nClavering, and sent up to Julia as he was dressing for dinner. It was\nan extremely comfortable arrangement, and Julia was very glad of the\nmoney,--feeling it to be a portion of that which was her own. And\nHarry's cheque had been returned to him on the day of its receipt.\n\"Of course I cannot take it, and of course you should not have sent\nit.\" These words were written on the morsel of paper in which the\nmoney was returned. But Miss Brabazon had torn the signature off the\ncheque, so that it might be safe, whereas Harry Clavering had taken\nno precaution with it whatever. But then Harry Clavering had not\nlived two years in London.\n\nDuring the hours that the cheque was away from him, Harry had told\nhis father that perhaps, even yet, he might change his purpose as to\ngoing to Messrs. Beilby and Burton. He did not know, he said, but he\nwas still in doubt. This had sprung from some chance question which\nhis father had asked, and which had seemed to demand an answer. Mr.\nClavering greatly disliked the scheme of life which his son had made.\nHarry's life hitherto had been prosperous and very creditable. He had\ngone early to Cambridge, and at twenty-two had become a fellow of his\ncollege. This fellowship he could hold for five or six years without\ngoing into orders. It would then lead to a living, and would in the\nmeantime afford a livelihood. But, beyond this, Harry, with an energy\nwhich he certainly had not inherited from his father, had become a\nschoolmaster, and was already a rich man. He had done more than well,\nand there was a great probability that between them they might be\nable to buy the next presentation to Clavering, when the time should\ncome in which Sir Hugh should determine on selling it. That Sir\nHugh should give the family living to his cousin was never thought\nprobable by any of the family at the rectory; but he might perhaps\npart with it under such circumstances on favourable terms. For all\nthese reasons the father was very anxious that his son should follow\nout the course for which he had been intended; but that he, being\nunenergetic and having hitherto done little for his son, should\ndictate to a young man who had been energetic, and who had done much\nfor himself, was out of the question. Harry, therefore, was to be the\narbiter of his own fate. But when Harry received back the cheque from\nJulia Brabazon, then he again returned to his resolution respecting\nMessrs. Beilby and Burton, and took the first opportunity of telling\nhis father that such was the case.\n\nAfter breakfast he followed his father into his study, and there,\nsitting in two easy-chairs opposite to each other, they lit each a\ncigar. Such was the reverend gentleman's custom in the afternoon,\nand such also in the morning. I do not know whether the smoking of\nfour or five cigars daily by the parson of a parish may now-a-day be\nconsidered as a vice in him, but if so, it was the only vice with\nwhich Mr. Clavering could be charged. He was a kind, soft-hearted,\ngracious man, tender to his wife, whom he ever regarded as the\nangel of his house, indulgent to his daughters, whom he idolized,\never patient with his parishioners, and awake,--though not widely\nawake,--to the responsibilities of his calling. The world had been\ntoo comfortable for him, and also too narrow; so that he had sunk\ninto idleness. The world had given him much to eat and drink, but it\nhad given him little to do, and thus he had gradually fallen away\nfrom his early purposes, till his energy hardly sufficed for the\ndoing of that little. His living gave him eight hundred a year; his\nwife's fortune nearly doubled that. He had married early, and had\ngot his living early, and had been very prosperous. But he was not\na happy man. He knew that he had put off the day of action till\nthe power of action had passed away from him. His library was well\nfurnished, but he rarely read much else than novels and poetry; and\nof late years the reading even of poetry had given way to the reading\nof novels. Till within ten years of the hour of which I speak, he had\nbeen a hunting parson,--not hunting loudly, but following his sport\nas it is followed by moderate sportsmen. Then there had come a new\nbishop, and the new bishop had sent for him,--nay, finally had come\nto him, and had lectured him with blatant authority. \"My lord,\" said\nthe parson of Clavering, plucking up something of his past energy,\nas the colour rose to his face, \"I think you are wrong in this. I\nthink you are specially wrong to interfere with me in this way on\nyour first coming among us. You feel it to be your duty, no doubt;\nbut to me it seems that you mistake your duty. But, as the matter\nis one simply of my own pleasure, I shall give it up.\" After that\nMr. Clavering hunted no more, and never spoke a good word to any one\nof the bishop of his diocese. For myself, I think it as well that\nclergymen should not hunt; but had I been the parson of Clavering,\nI should, under those circumstances, have hunted double.\n\nMr. Clavering hunted no more, and probably smoked a greater number\nof cigars in consequence. He had an increased amount of time at his\ndisposal, but did not, therefore, give more time to his duties. Alas!\nwhat time did he give to his duties? He kept a most energetic curate,\nwhom he allowed to do almost what he would with the parish. Every-day\nservices he did prohibit, declaring that he would not have the parish\nchurch made ridiculous; but in other respects his curate was the\npastor. Once every Sunday he read the service, and once every Sunday\nhe preached, and he resided in his parsonage ten months every year.\nHis wife and daughters went among the poor,--and he smoked cigars\nin his library. Though not yet fifty, he was becoming fat and\nidle,--unwilling to walk, and not caring much even for such riding as\nthe bishop had left to him. And, to make matters worse,--far worse,\nhe knew all this of himself, and understood it thoroughly. \"I see a\nbetter path, and know how good it is, but I follow ever the worse.\"\nHe was saying that to himself daily, and was saying it always without\nhope.\n\nAnd his wife had given him up. She had given him up, not with\ndisdainful rejection, nor with contempt in her eye, or censure in her\nvoice, not with diminution of love or of outward respect. She had\ngiven him up as a man abandons his attempts to make his favourite dog\ntake the water. He would fain that the dog he loves should dash into\nthe stream as other dogs will do. It is, to his thinking, a noble\ninstinct in a dog. But his dog dreads the water. As, however, he\nhas learned to love the beast, he puts up with this mischance, and\nnever dreams of banishing poor Ponto from his hearth because of this\nfailure. And so it was with Mrs. Clavering and her husband at the\nrectory. He understood it all. He knew that he was so far rejected;\nand he acknowledged to himself the necessity for such rejection.\n\n\"It is a very serious thing to decide upon,\" he said, when his son\nhad spoken to him.\n\n\"Yes; it is serious,--about as serious a thing as a man can think of;\nbut a man cannot put it off on that account. If I mean to make such a\nchange in my plans, the sooner I do it the better.\"\n\n\"But yesterday you were in another mind.\"\n\n\"No, father, not in another mind. I did not tell you then, nor can\nI tell you all now. I had thought that I should want my money for\nanother purpose for a year or two; but that I have abandoned.\"\n\n\"Is the purpose a secret, Harry?\"\n\n\"It is a secret, because it concerns another person.\"\n\n\"You were going to lend your money to some one?\"\n\n\"I must keep it a secret, though you know I seldom have any secrets\nfrom you. That idea, however, is abandoned, and I mean to go over to\nStratton to-morrow, and tell Mr. Burton that I shall be there after\nChristmas. I must be at St. Cuthbert's on Tuesday.\"\n\nThen they both sat silent for a while, silently blowing out their\nclouds of smoke. The son had said all that he cared to say, and would\nhave wished that there might then be an end of it; but he knew that\nhis father had much on his mind, and would fain express, if he could\nexpress it without too much trouble, or without too evident a need\nof self-reproach, his own thoughts on the subject. \"You have made\nup your mind, then, altogether that you do not like the church as a\nprofession,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I think I have, father.\"\n\n\"And on what grounds? The grounds which recommend it to you are very\nstrong. Your education has adapted you for it. Your success in it\nis already ensured by your fellowship. In a great degree you have\nentered it as a profession already, by taking a fellowship. What you\nare doing is not choosing a line in life, but changing one already\nchosen. You are making of yourself a rolling stone.\"\n\n\"A stone should roll till it has come to the spot that suits it.\"\n\n\"Why not give up the school if it irks you?\"\n\n\"And become a Cambridge Don, and practise deportment among the\nundergraduates.\"\n\n\"I don't see that you need do that. You need not even live at\nCambridge. Take a church in London. You would be sure to get one\nby holding up your hand. If that, with your fellowship, is not\nsufficient, I will give you what more you want.\"\n\n\"No, father--no. By God's blessing I will never ask you for a pound.\nI can hold my fellowship for four years longer without orders, and in\nfour years' time I think I can earn my bread.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt that, Harry.\"\n\n\"Then why should I not follow my wishes in this matter? The truth is,\nI do not feel myself qualified to be a good clergyman.\"\n\n\"It is not that you have doubts, is it?\"\n\n\"I might have them if I came to think much about it,--as I must do if\nI took orders. And I do not wish to be crippled in doing what I think\nlawful by conventional rules. A rebellious clergyman is, I think, a\nsorry object. It seems to me that he is a bird fouling his own nest.\nNow, I know I should be a rebellious clergyman.\"\n\n\"In our church the life of a clergyman is as the life of any other\ngentleman,--within very broad limits.\"\n\n\"Then why did Bishop Proudie interfere with your hunting?\"\n\n\"Limits may be very broad, Harry, and yet exclude hunting. Bishop\nProudie was vulgar and intrusive, such being the nature of his wife,\nwho instructs him; but if you were in orders I should be very sorry\nto see you take to hunting.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that a clergyman has nothing to do in life unless\nhe is always preaching and teaching. Look at Saul,\"--Mr. Saul was\nthe curate of Clavering--\"he is always preaching and teaching. He is\ndoing the best he can; and what a life of it he has. He has literally\nthrown off all worldly cares,--and consequently everybody laughs at\nhim, and nobody loves him. I don't believe a better man breathes, but\nI shouldn't like his life.\"\n\nAt this point there was another pause, which lasted till the cigars\nhad come to an end. Then, as he threw the stump into the fire, Mr.\nClavering spoke again. \"The truth is, Harry, that you have had, all\nyour life, a bad example before you.\"\n\n\"No, father.\"\n\n\"Yes, my son;--let me speak on to the end, and then you can say what\nyou please. In me you have had a bad example on one side, and now, in\npoor Saul, you have a bad example on the other side. Can you fancy no\nlife between the two, which would fit your physical nature, which is\nlarger than his, and your mental wants, which are higher than mine?\nYes, they are, Harry. It is my duty to say this, but it would be\nunseemly that there should be any controversy between us on the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"If you choose to stop me in that way--\"\n\n\"I do choose to stop you in that way. As for Saul, it is impossible\nthat you should become such a man as he. It is not that he mortifies\nhis flesh, but that he has no flesh to mortify. He is unconscious\nof the flavour of venison, or the scent of roses, or the beauty of\nwomen. He is an exceptional specimen of a man, and you need no more\nfear, than you should venture to hope, that you could become such as\nhe is.\"\n\nAt this point they were interrupted by the entrance of Fanny\nClavering, who came to say that Mr. Saul was in the drawing-room.\n\"What does he want, Fanny?\" This question Mr. Clavering asked half in\na whisper, but with something of comic humour in his face, as though\npartly afraid that Mr. Saul should hear it, and partly intending to\nconvey a wish that he might escape Mr. Saul, if it were possible.\n\n\"It's about the iron church, papa. He says it is come,--or part of\nit has come,--and he wants you to go out to Cumberly Green about the\nsite.\"\n\n\"I thought that was all settled.\"\n\n\"He says not.\"\n\n\"What does it matter where it is? He can put it anywhere he likes on\nthe Green. However, I had better go to him.\" So Mr. Clavering went.\nCumberly Green was a hamlet in the parish of Clavering, three miles\ndistant from the church, the people of which had got into a wicked\nhabit of going to a dissenting chapel near to them. By Mr. Saul's\nenergy, but chiefly out of Mr. Clavering's purse, an iron chapel had\nbeen purchased for a hundred and fifty pounds, and Mr. Saul proposed\nto add to his own duties the pleasing occupation of walking to\nCumberly Green every Sunday morning before breakfast, and every\nWednesday evening after dinner, to perform a service and bring back\nto the true flock as many of the erring sheep of Cumberly Green as he\nmight be able to catch. Towards the purchase of this iron church Mr.\nClavering had at first given a hundred pounds. Sir Hugh, in answer to\nthe fifth application, had very ungraciously, through his steward,\nbestowed ten pounds. Among the farmers one pound nine and eightpence\nhad been collected. Mr. Saul had given two pounds; Mrs. Clavering\ngave five pounds; the girls gave ten shillings each; Henry Clavering\ngave five pounds;--and then the parson made up the remainder. But Mr.\nSaul had journeyed thrice painfully to Bristol, making the bargain\nfor the church, going and coming each time by third-class, and he had\nwritten all the letters; but Mrs. Clavering had paid the postage,\nand she and the girls between them were making the covering for the\nlittle altar.\n\n\"Is it all settled, Harry?\" said Fanny, stopping with her brother,\nand hanging over his chair. She was a pretty, gay-spirited girl, with\nbright eyes and dark brown hair, which fell in two curls behind her\nears.\n\n\"He has said nothing to unsettle it.\"\n\n\"I know it makes him very unhappy.\"\n\n\"No, Fanny, not very unhappy. He would rather that I should go into\nthe church, but that is about all.\"\n\n\"I think you are quite right.\"\n\n\"And Mary thinks I am quite wrong.\"\n\n\"Mary thinks so, of course. So should I too, perhaps, if I were\nengaged to a clergyman. That's the old story of the fox who had lost\nhis tail.\"\n\n\"And your tail isn't gone yet?\"\n\n\"No, my tail isn't gone yet. Mary thinks that no life is like a\nclergyman's life. But, Harry, though mamma hasn't said so, I'm sure\nshe thinks you are right. She won't say so as long as it may seem to\ninterfere with anything papa may choose to say; but I'm sure she's\nglad in her heart.\"\n\n\"And I am glad in my heart, Fanny. And as I'm the person most\nconcerned, I suppose that's the most material thing.\" Then they\nfollowed their father into the drawing-room.\n\n\"Couldn't you drive Mrs. Clavering over in the pony chair, and settle\nit between you,\" said Mr. Clavering to his curate. Mr. Saul looked\ndisappointed. In the first place, he hated driving the pony, which\nwas a rapid-footed little beast, that had a will of his own; and in\nthe next place, he thought the rector ought to visit the spot on such\nan occasion. \"Or Mrs. Clavering will drive you,\" said the rector,\nremembering Mr. Saul's objection to the pony. Still Mr. Saul looked\nunhappy. Mr. Saul was very tall and very thin, with a tall thin head,\nand weak eyes, and a sharp, well-cut nose, and, so to say, no lips,\nand very white teeth, with no beard, and a well-cut chin. His face\nwas so thin that his cheekbones obtruded themselves unpleasantly.\nHe wore a long rusty black coat, and a high rusty black waistcoat,\nand trousers that were brown with dirty roads and general ill-usage.\nNevertheless, it never occurred to any one that Mr. Saul did not look\nlike a gentleman, not even to himself, to whom no ideas whatever on\nthat subject ever presented themselves. But that he was a gentleman\nI think he knew well enough, and was able to carry himself before\nSir Hugh and his wife with quite as much ease as he could do in the\nrectory. Once or twice he had dined at the great house; but Lady\nClavering had declared him to be a bore, and Sir Hugh had called\nhim \"that most offensive of all animals, a clerical prig.\" It had\ntherefore been decided that he was not to be asked to the great\nhouse any more. It may be as well to state here, as elsewhere, that\nMr. Clavering very rarely went to his nephew's table. On certain\noccasions he did do so, so that there might be no recognized quarrel\nbetween him and Sir Hugh; but such visits were few and far between.\n\nAfter a few more words from Mr. Saul, and a glance from his wife's\neye, Mr. Clavering consented to go to Cumberly Green, though there\nwas nothing he liked so little as a morning spent with his curate.\nWhen he had started, Harry told his mother also of his final\ndecision. \"I shall go to Stratton to-morrow and settle it all.\"\n\n\"And what does papa say?\" asked the mother.\n\n\"Just what he has said before. It is not so much that he wishes me to\nbe a clergyman, as that he does not wish me to have lost all my time\nup to this.\"\n\n\"It is more than that, I think, Harry,\" said his elder sister, a tall\ngirl, less pretty than her sister, apparently less careful of her\nprettiness, very quiet, or, as some said, demure, but known to be\ngood as gold by all who knew her well.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said Harry, stoutly. \"But, however that may be, a man\nmust choose for himself.\"\n\n\"We all thought you had chosen,\" said Mary.\n\n\"If it is settled,\" said the mother, \"I suppose we shall do no good\nby opposing it.\"\n\n\"Would you wish to oppose it, mamma?\" said Harry.\n\n\"No, my dear. I think you should judge for yourself.\"\n\n\"You see I could have no scope in the church for that sort of\nambition which would satisfy me. Look at such men as Locke, and\nStephenson, and Brassey. They are the men who seem to me to do most\nin the world. They were all self-educated, but surely a man can't\nhave a worse chance because he has learned something. Look at old\nBeilby with a seat in Parliament, and a property worth two or three\nhundred thousand pounds! When he was my age he had nothing but his\nweekly wages.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether Mr. Beilby is a very happy man or a very good\nman,\" said Mary.\n\n\"I don't know, either,\" said Harry; \"but I do know that he has thrown\na single arch over a wider span of water than ever was done before,\nand that ought to make him happy.\" After saying this in a tone of\nhigh authority, befitting his dignity as a fellow of his college,\nHarry Clavering went out, leaving his mother and sisters to discuss\nthe subject which to two of them was all-important. As to Mary,\nshe had hopes of her own, vested in the clerical concerns of a\nneighbouring parish.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nLORD ONGAR.\n\n\nOn the next morning Harry Clavering rode over to Stratton, thinking\nmuch of his misery as he went. It was all very well for him, in the\npresence of his own family to talk of his profession as the one\nsubject which was to him of any importance; but he knew very well\nhimself that he was only beguiling them in doing so. This question\nof a profession was, after all, but dead leaves to him,--to him who\nhad a canker at his heart, a perpetual thorn in his bosom, a misery\nwithin him which no profession could mitigate! Those dear ones at\nhome guessed nothing of this, and he would take care that they should\nguess nothing. Why should they have the pain of knowing that he had\nbeen made wretched for ever by blighted hopes? His mother, indeed,\nhad suspected something in those sweet days of his roaming with Julia\nthrough the park. She had once or twice said a word to warn him. But\nof the very truth of his deep love,--so he told himself,--she had\nbeen happily ignorant. Let her be ignorant. Why should he make his\nmother unhappy? As these thoughts passed through his mind, I think\nthat he revelled in his wretchedness, and made much to himself of his\nmisery. He sucked in his sorrow greedily, and was somewhat proud to\nhave had occasion to break his heart. But not the less, because he\nwas thus early blighted, would he struggle for success in the world.\nHe would show her that, as his wife, she might have had a worthier\nposition than Lord Ongar could give her. He, too, might probably rise\nthe quicker in the world, as now he would have no impediment of wife\nor family. Then, as he rode along, he composed a sonnet, fitting to\nhis case, the strength and rhythm of which seemed to him, as he sat\non horseback, to be almost perfect. Unfortunately, when he was back\nat Clavering, and sat in his room with the pen in his hand, the turn\nof the words had escaped him.\n\nHe found Mr. Burton at home, and was not long in concluding his\nbusiness. Messrs. Beilby and Burton were not only civil engineers,\nbut were land surveyors also, and land valuers on a great scale. They\nwere employed much by Government upon public buildings, and if not\narchitects themselves, were supposed to know all that architects\nshould do and should not do. In the purchase of great properties\nMr. Burton's opinion was supposed to be, or to have been, as good as\nany in the kingdom, and therefore there was very much to be learned\nin the office at Stratton. But Mr. Burton was not a rich man like\nhis partner, Mr. Beilby, nor an ambitious man. He had never soared\nParliamentwards, had never speculated, had never invented, and never\nbeen great. He had been the father of a very large family, all of\nwhom were doing as well in the world, and some of them perhaps\nbetter, than their father. Indeed, there were many who said that Mr.\nBurton would have been a richer man if he had not joined himself\nin partnership with Mr. Beilby. Mr. Beilby had the reputation of\nswallowing more than his share wherever he went.\n\nWhen the business part of the arrangement was finished Mr. Burton\ntalked to his future pupil about lodgings, and went out with him into\nthe town to look for rooms. The old man found that Harry Clavering\nwas rather nice in this respect, and in his own mind formed an idea\nthat this new beginner might have been a more auspicious pupil, had\nhe not already become a fellow of a college. Indeed, Harry talked\nto him quite as though they two were on an equality together; and,\nbefore they had parted, Mr. Burton was not sure that Harry did not\npatronize him. He asked the young man, however, to join them at their\nearly dinner, and then introduced him to Mrs. Burton, and to their\nyoungest daughter, the only child who was still living with them.\n\"All my other girls are married, Mr. Clavering; and all of them\nmarried to men connected with my own profession.\" The colour came\nslightly to Florence Burton's cheeks as she heard her father's words,\nand Harry asked himself whether the old man expected that he should\ngo through the same ordeal; but Mr. Burton himself was quite unaware\nthat he had said anything wrong, and then went on to speak of the\nsuccesses of his sons. \"But they began early, Mr. Clavering; and\nworked hard,--very hard indeed.\" He was a good, kindly, garrulous\nold man; but Harry began to doubt whether he would learn much at\nStratton. It was, however, too late to think of that now, and\neverything was fixed.\n\nHarry, when he looked at Florence Burton, at once declared to himself\nthat she was plain. Anything more unlike Julia Brabazon never\nappeared in the guise of a young lady. Julia was tall, with a high\nbrow, a glorious complexion, a nose as finely modelled as though a\nGrecian sculptor had cut it, a small mouth, but lovely in its curves,\nand a chin that finished and made perfect the symmetry of her face.\nHer neck was long, but graceful as a swan's, her bust was full, and\nher whole figure like that of a goddess. Added to this, when he\nhad first known her, had been all the charm of youth. When she had\nreturned to Clavering the other day, the affianced bride of Lord\nOngar, he had hardly known whether to admire or to deplore the\nsettled air of established womanhood which she had assumed. Her\nlarge eyes had always lacked something of rapid glancing sparkling\nbrightness. They had been glorious eyes to him, and in those early\ndays he had not known that they lacked aught; but he had perceived,\nor perhaps fancied, that now, in her present condition, they were\noften cold, and sometimes almost cruel. Nevertheless he was ready to\nswear that she was perfect in her beauty.\n\nPoor Florence Burton was short of stature, was brown, meagre, and\npoor-looking. So said Harry Clavering to himself. Her small hand,\nthough soft, lacked that wondrous charm of touch which Julia's\npossessed. Her face was short, and her forehead, though it was broad\nand open, had none of that feminine command which Julia's look\nconveyed. That Florence's eyes were very bright,--bright and soft as\nwell, he allowed; and her dark brown hair was very glossy; but she\nwas, on the whole, a mean-looking little thing. He could not, as he\nsaid to himself on his return home, avoid the comparison, as she was\nthe first girl he had seen since he had parted from Julia Brabazon.\n\n\"I hope you'll find yourself comfortable at Stratton, sir,\" said old\nMrs. Burton.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Harry, \"but I want very little myself in that way.\nAnything does for me.\"\n\n\"One young gentleman we had took a bedroom at Mrs. Pott's, and did\nvery nicely without any second room at all. Don't you remember, Mr.\nB.? it was young Granger.\"\n\n\"Young Granger had a very short allowance,\" said Mr. Burton. \"He\nlived upon fifty pounds a year all the time he was here.\"\n\n\"And I don't think Scarness had more when he began,\" said Mrs.\nBurton. \"Mr. Scarness married one of my girls, Mr. Clavering, when he\nstarted himself at Liverpool. He has pretty nigh all the Liverpool\ndocks under him now. I have heard him say that butcher's meat did not\ncost him four shillings a week all the time he was here. I've always\nthought Stratton one of the reasonablest places anywhere for a young\nman to do for himself in.\"\n\n\"I don't know, my dear,\" said the husband, \"that Mr. Clavering will\ncare very much for that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, Mr. B.; but I do like to see young men careful about\ntheir spendings. What's the use of spending a shilling when sixpence\nwill do as well; and sixpence saved when a man has nothing but\nhimself, becomes pounds and pounds by the time he has a family about\nhim.\"\n\nDuring all this time Miss Burton said little or nothing, and Harry\nClavering himself did not say much. He could not express any\nintention of rivalling Mr. Scarness's economy in the article of\nbutcher's meat, nor could he promise to content himself with\nGranger's solitary bedroom. But as he rode home he almost began to\nfear that he had made a mistake. He was not wedded to the joys of\nhis college hall, or the college common room. He did not like the\nnarrowness of college life. But he doubted whether the change from\nthat to the oft-repeated hospitalities of Mrs. Burton might not be\ntoo much for him. Scarness's four shillings'-worth of butcher's meat\nhad already made him half sick of his new profession, and though\nStratton might be the \"reasonablest place anywhere for a young man,\"\nhe could not look forward to living there for a year with much\ndelight. As for Miss Burton, it might be quite as well that she was\nplain, as he wished for none of the delights which beauty affords to\nyoung men.\n\nOn his return home, however, he made no complaint of Stratton. He was\ntoo strong-willed to own that he had been in any way wrong, and when\nearly in the following week he started for St. Cuthbert's, he was\nable to speak with cheerful hope of his new prospects. If ultimately\nhe should find life in Stratton to be unendurable, he would cut that\npart of his career short, and contrive to get up to London at an\nearlier time than he had intended.\n\nOn the 31st of August Lord Ongar and Sir Hugh Clavering reached\nClavering Park, and, as has been already told, a pretty little note\nwas at once sent up to Miss Brabazon in her bedroom. When she met\nLord Ongar in the drawing-room, about an hour afterwards, she had\ninstructed herself that it would be best to say nothing of the note;\nbut she could not refrain from a word. \"I am much obliged, my lord,\nby your kindness and generosity,\" she said, as she gave him her hand.\nHe merely bowed and smiled, and muttered something as to his hoping\nthat he might always find it as easy to gratify her. He was a little\nman, on whose behalf it certainly appeared that the Peerage must have\ntold a falsehood; it seemed so at least to those who judged of his\nyears from his appearance. The Peerage said that he was thirty-six,\nand that, no doubt, was in truth his age, but any one would have\ndeclared him to be ten years older. This look was produced chiefly\nby the effect of an elaborately dressed jet black wig which he wore.\nWhat misfortune had made him bald so early,--if to be bald early in\nlife be a misfortune,--I cannot say; but he had lost the hair from\nthe crown of his head, and had preferred wiggery to baldness. No\ndoubt an effort was made to hide the wiggishness of his wigs, but\nwhat effect in that direction was ever made successfully? He was,\nmoreover, weak, thin, and physically poor, and had, no doubt,\nincreased this weakness and poorness by hard living. Though others\nthought him old, time had gone swiftly with him, and he still thought\nhimself a young man. He hunted, though he could not ride. He shot,\nthough he could not walk. And, unfortunately, he drank, though he\nhad no capacity for drinking! His friends at last had taught him to\nbelieve that his only chance of saving himself lay in marriage, and\ntherefore he had engaged himself to Julia Brabazon, purchasing her at\nthe price of a brilliant settlement. If Lord Ongar should die before\nher, Ongar Park was to be hers for life, with thousands a year to\nmaintain it. Courton Castle, the great family seat, would of course\ngo to the heir; but Ongar Park was supposed to be the most delightful\nsmall country-seat anywhere within thirty miles of London. It lay\namong the Surrey hills, and all the world had heard of the charms of\nOngar Park. If Julia were to survive her lord, Ongar Park was to be\nhers; and they who saw them both together had but little doubt that\nshe would come to the enjoyment of this clause in her settlement.\nLady Clavering had been clever in arranging the match; and Sir Hugh,\nthough he might have been unwilling to give his sister-in-law money\nout of his own pocket, had performed his duty as a brother-in-law in\nlooking to her future welfare. Julia Brabazon had no doubt that she\nwas doing well. Poor Harry Clavering! She had loved him in the days\nof her romance. She, too, had written her sonnets. But she had grown\nold earlier in life than he had done, and had taught herself that\nromance could not be allowed to a woman in her position. She was\nhighly born, the daughter of a peer, without money, and even without\na home to which she had any claim. Of course she had accepted Lord\nOngar, but she had not put out her hand to take all these good things\nwithout resolving that she would do her duty to her future lord. The\nduty would be doubtless disagreeable, but she would do it with all\nthe more diligence on that account.\n\nSeptember passed by, hecatombs of partridges were slaughtered, and\nthe day of the wedding drew nigh. It was pretty to see Lord Ongar and\nthe self-satisfaction which he enjoyed at this time. The world was\nbecoming young with him again, and he thought that he rather liked\nthe respectability of his present mode of life. He gave himself but\nscanty allowances of wine, and no allowance of anything stronger than\nwine, and did not dislike his temperance. There was about him at all\nhours an air which seemed to say, \"There; I told you all that I could\ndo it as soon as there was any necessity.\" And in these halcyon days\nhe could shoot for an hour without his pony, and he liked the gentle\ncourteous badinage which was bestowed upon his courtship, and he\nliked also Julia's beauty. Her conduct to him was perfect. She was\nnever pert, never exigeant, never romantic, and never humble. She\nnever bored him, and yet was always ready to be with him when he\nwished it. She was never exalted; and yet she bore her high place as\nbecame a woman nobly born and acknowledged to be beautiful.\n\n\"I declare you have quite made a lover of him,\" said Lady Clavering\nto her sister. When a thought of the match had first arisen in Sir\nHugh's London house, Lady Clavering had been eager in praise of Lord\nOngar, or eager in praise rather of the position which the future\nLady Ongar might hold; but since the prize had been secured, since it\nhad become plain that Julia was to be the greater woman of the two,\nshe had harped sometimes on the other string. As a sister she had\nstriven for a sister's welfare, but as a woman she could not keep\nherself from comparisons which might tend to show that after all,\nwell as Julia was doing, she was not doing better than her elder\nsister had done. Hermione had married simply a baronet, and not the\nrichest or the most amiable among baronets; but she had married a\nman suitable in age and wealth, with whom any girl might have been\nin love. She had not sold herself to be the nurse, or not to be the\nnurse, as it might turn out, of a worn-out debauch\u00c3\u00a9. She would have\nhinted nothing of this, perhaps have thought nothing of this, had not\nJulia and Lord Ongar walked together through the Clavering groves\nas though they were two young people. She owed it as a duty to her\nsister to point out that Lord Ongar could not be a romantic young\nperson, and ought not to be encouraged to play that part.\n\n\"I don't know that I have made anything of him,\" answered Julia. \"I\nsuppose he's much like other men when they're going to be married.\"\nJulia quite understood the ideas that were passing through her\nsister's mind, and did not feel them to be unnatural.\n\n\"What I mean is, that he has come out so strong in the Romeo line,\nwhich we hardly expected, you know. We shall have him under your\nbedroom window with a guitar like Don Giovanni.\"\n\n\"I hope not, because it's so cold. I don't think it likely, as he\nseems fond of going to bed early.\"\n\n\"And it's the best thing for him,\" said Lady Clavering, becoming\nserious and carefully benevolent. \"It's quite a wonder what good\nhours and quiet living have done for him in so short a time. I was\nobserving him as he walked yesterday, and he put his feet to the\nground as firmly almost as Hugh does.\"\n\n\"Did he indeed? I hope he won't have the habit of putting his hand\ndown firmly as Hugh does sometimes.\"\n\n\"As for that,\" said Lady Clavering, with a little tremor, \"I don't\nthink there's much difference between them. They all say that when\nLord Ongar means a thing he does mean it.\"\n\n\"I think a man ought to have a way of his own.\"\n\n\"And a woman also, don't you, my dear? But, as I was saying, if Lord\nOngar will continue to take care of himself he may become quite a\ndifferent man. Hugh says that he drinks next to nothing now, and\nthough he sometimes lights a cigar in the smoking-room at night, he\nhardly ever smokes it. You must do what you can to keep him from\ntobacco. I happen to know that Sir Charles Poddy said that so many\ncigars were worse for him even than brandy.\"\n\nAll this Julia bore with an even temper. She was determined to bear\neverything till her time should come. Indeed she had made herself\nunderstand that the hearing of such things as these was a part of the\nprice which she was to be called upon to pay. It was not pleasant for\nher to hear what Sir Charles Poddy had said about the tobacco and\nbrandy of the man she was just going to marry. She would sooner have\nheard of his riding sixty miles a day, or dancing all night, as she\nmight have heard had she been contented to take Harry Clavering. But\nshe had made her selection with her eyes open, and was not disposed\nto quarrel with her bargain, because that which she had bought was\nno better than the article which she had known it to be when she was\nmaking her purchase. Nor was she even angry with her sister. \"I will\ndo the best I can, Hermy; you may be sure of that. But there are some\nthings which it is useless to talk about.\"\n\n\"But it was as well you should know what Sir Charles said.\"\n\n\"I know quite enough of what he says, Hermy,--quite as much, I\ndaresay, as you do. But, never mind. If Lord Ongar has given up\nsmoking, I quite agree with you that it's a good thing. I wish they'd\nall give it up, for I hate the smell of it. Hugh has got worse and\nworse. He never cares about changing his clothes now.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" said Sir Hugh to his wife that night;\n\"sixty thousand a year is a very fine income, but Julia will find she\nhas caught a Tartar.\"\n\n\"I suppose he'll hardly live long; will he?\"\n\n\"I don't know or care when he lives or when he dies; but, by heaven,\nhe is the most overbearing fellow I ever had in the house with me. I\nwouldn't stand him here for another fortnight,--not even to make her\nall safe.\"\n\n\"It will soon be over. They'll be gone on Thursday.\"\n\n\"What do you think of his having the impudence to tell\nCunliffe,\"--Cunliffe was the head keeper,--\"before my face, that he\ndidn't know anything about pheasants! 'Well, my lord, I think we've\ngot a few about the place,' said Cunliffe. 'Very few,' said Ongar,\nwith a sneer. Now, if I haven't a better head of game here than he\nhas at Courton, I'll eat him. But the impudence of his saying that\nbefore me!\"\n\n\"Did you make him any answer?\"\n\n\"'There's about enough to suit me,' I said. Then he skulked away,\nknocked off his pins. I shouldn't like to be his wife; I can tell\nJulia that.\"\n\n\"Julia is very clever,\" said the sister.\n\nThe day of the marriage came, and everything at Clavering was done\nwith much splendour. Four bridesmaids came down from London on the\npreceding day; two were already staying in the house, and the two\ncousins came as two more from the rectory. Julia Brabazon had never\nbeen really intimate with Mary and Fanny Clavering, but she had known\nthem well enough to make it odd if she did not ask them to come to\nher wedding and to take a part in the ceremony. And, moreover, she\nhad thought of Harry and her little romance of other days. Harry,\nperhaps, might be glad to know that she had shown this courtesy to\nhis sisters. Harry, she knew, would be away at his school. Though she\nhad asked him whether he meant to come to her wedding, she had been\nbetter pleased that he should be absent. She had not many regrets\nherself, but it pleased her to think that he should have them. So\nMary and Fanny Clavering were asked to attend her at the altar. Mary\nand Fanny would both have preferred to decline, but their mother had\ntold them that they could not do so. \"It would make ill-feeling,\"\nsaid Mrs. Clavering; \"and that is what your papa particularly wishes\nto avoid.\"\n\n\"When you say papa particularly wishes anything, mamma, you always\nmean that you wish it particularly yourself,\" said Fanny. \"But if\nit must be done, it must; and then I shall know how to behave when\nMary's time comes.\"\n\nThe bells were rung lustily all the morning, and all the parish was\nthere, round about the church, to see. There was no record of a lord\never having been married in Clavering church before; and now this\nlord was going to marry my lady's sister. It was all one as though\nshe were a Clavering herself. But there was no ecstatic joy in the\nparish. There were to be no bonfires, and no eating and drinking at\nSir Hugh's expense,--no comforts provided for any of the poor by Lady\nClavering on that special occasion. Indeed, there was never much of\nsuch kindnesses between the lord of the soil and his dependants.\nA certain stipulated dole was given at Christmas for coals and\nblankets; but even for that there was generally some wrangle between\nthe rector and the steward. \"If there's to be all this row about it,\"\nthe rector had said to the steward, \"I'll never ask for it again.\" \"I\nwish my uncle would only be as good as his word,\" Sir Hugh had said,\nwhen the rector's speech was repeated to him. Therefore, there was\nnot much of real rejoicing in the parish on this occasion, though the\nbells were rung loudly, and though the people, young and old, did\ncluster round the churchyard to see the lord lead his bride out of\nthe church. \"A puir feckless thing, tottering along like,--not half\nthe makings of a man. A stout lass like she could a'most blow him\naway wi' a puff of her mouth.\" That was the verdict which an old\nfarmer's wife passed upon him, and that verdict was made good by the\ngeneral opinion of the parish.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"A puir feckless thing, tottering along like,--\"]\n\n\nBut though the lord might be only half a man, Julia Brabazon walked\nout from the church every inch a countess. Whatever price she might\nhave paid, she had at any rate got the thing which she had intended\nto buy. And as she stepped into the chariot which carried her away to\nthe railway station on her way to Dover, she told herself that she\nhad done right. She had chosen her profession, as Harry Clavering\nhad chosen his; and having so far succeeded, she would do her best\nto make her success perfect. Mercenary! Of course she had been\nmercenary. Were not all men and women mercenary upon whom devolved\nthe necessity of earning their bread?\n\nThen there was a great breakfast at the park,--for the quality,--and\nthe rector on this occasion submitted himself to become the guest of\nthe nephew whom he thoroughly disliked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nFLORENCE BURTON.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nIt was now Christmas time at Stratton, or rather Christmas time was\nnear at hand; not the Christmas next after the autumn of Lord Ongar's\nmarriage, but the following Christmas, and Harry Clavering had\nfinished his studies in Mr. Burton's office. He flattered himself\nthat he had not been idle while he was there, and was now about to\ncommence his more advanced stage of pupilage, under the great Mr.\nBeilby in London, with hopes which were still good, if they were not\nso magnificent as they once had been. When he first saw Mr. Burton\nin his office, and beheld the dusty pigeon-holes with dusty papers,\nand caught the first glimpse of things as they really were in the\nworkshop of that man of business, he had, to say the truth, been\ndisgusted. And Mrs. Burton's early dinner, and Florence Burton's\n\"plain face\" and plain ways, had disconcerted him. On that day he had\nrepented of his intention with regard to Stratton; but he had carried\nout his purpose like a man, and now he rejoiced greatly that he had\ndone so. He rejoiced greatly, though his hopes were somewhat sobered,\nand his views of life less grand than they had been. He was to start\nfor Clavering early on the following morning, intending to spend his\nChristmas at home, and we will see him and listen to him as he bade\nfarewell to one of the members of Mr. Burton's family.\n\nHe was sitting in a small back parlour in Mr. Burton's house, and on\nthe table of the room there was burning a single candle. It was a\ndull, dingy, brown room, furnished with horsehair-covered chairs, an\nold horsehair sofa, and heavy rusty curtains. I don't know that there\nwas in the room any attempt at ornament, as certainly there was no\nevidence of wealth. It was now about seven o'clock in the evening,\nand tea was over in Mrs. Burton's establishment. Harry Clavering had\nhad his tea, and had eaten his hot muffin, at the further side from\nthe fire of the family table, while Florence had poured out the tea,\nand Mrs. Burton had sat by the fire on one side with a handkerchief\nover her lap, and Mr. Burton had been comfortable with his arm-chair\nand his slippers on the other side. When tea was over, Harry had made\nhis parting speech to Mrs. Burton, and that lady had kissed him, and\nbade God bless him. \"I'll see you for a moment before you go, in my\noffice, Harry,\" Mr. Burton had said. Then Harry had gone downstairs,\nand some one else had gone boldly with him, and they two were sitting\ntogether in the dingy brown room. After that I need hardly tell my\nreader what had become of Harry Clavering's perpetual life-enduring\nheart's misery.\n\nHe and Florence were sitting on the old horsehair sofa, and\nFlorence's hand was in his. \"My darling,\" he said, \"how am I to live\nfor the next two years?\"\n\n\"You mean five years, Harry.\"\n\n\"No; I mean two,--that is two, unless I can make the time less. I\nbelieve you'd be better pleased to think it was ten.\"\n\n\"Much better pleased to think it was ten than to have no such hope at\nall. Of course we shall see each other. It's not as though you were\ngoing to New Zealand.\"\n\n\"I almost wish I were. One would agree then as to the necessity of\nthis cursed delay.\"\n\n\"Harry, Harry!\"\n\n\"It is accursed. The prudence of the world in these latter days seems\nto me to be more abominable than all its other iniquities.\"\n\n\"But, Harry, we should have no income.\"\n\n\"Income is a word that I hate.\"\n\n\"Now you are getting on to your high horse, and you know I always go\nout of the way when you begin to prance on that beast. As for me,\nI don't want to leave papa's house where I'm sure of my bread and\nbutter, till I'm sure of it in another.\"\n\n\"You say that, Florence, on purpose to torment me.\"\n\n\"Dear Harry, do you think I want to torment you on your last night?\nThe truth is, I love you so well that I can afford to be patient for\nyou.\"\n\n\"I hate patience, and always did. Patience is one of the worst vices\nI know. It's almost as bad as humility. You'll tell me you're 'umble\nnext. If you'll only add that you're contented, you'll describe\nyourself as one of the lowest of God's creatures.\"\n\n\"I don't know about being 'umble, but I am contented. Are not you\ncontented with me, sir?\"\n\n\"No,--because you're not in a hurry to be married.\"\n\n\"What a goose you are. Do you know I'm not sure that if you really\nlove a person, and are quite confident about him,--as I am of\nyou,--that having to look forward to being married is not the best\npart of it all. I suppose you'll like to get my letters now, but I\ndon't know that you'll care for them much when we've been man and\nwife for ten years.\"\n\n\"But one can't live upon letters.\"\n\n\"I shall expect you to live upon mine, and to grow fat on them.\nThere;--I heard papa's step on the stairs. He said you were to go to\nhim. Good-by, Harry;--dearest Harry! What a blessed wind it was that\nblew you here.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment;--about your getting to Clavering. I shall come for\nyou on Easter-eve.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;--why should you have so much trouble and expense?\"\n\n\"I tell you I shall come for you,--unless, indeed, you decline to\ntravel with me.\"\n\n\"It will be so nice! And then I shall be sure to have you with me the\nfirst moment I see them. I shall think it very awful when I first\nmeet your father.\"\n\n\"He's the most good-natured man, I should say, in England.\"\n\n\"But he'll think me so plain. You did at first, you know. But he\nwon't be uncivil enough to tell me so, as you did. And Mary is to be\nmarried in Easter week? Oh, dear, oh, dear; I shall be so shy among\nthem all.\"\n\n\"You shy! I never saw you shy in my life. I don't suppose you were\never really put out yet.\"\n\n\"But I must really put you out, because papa is waiting for you.\nDear, dear, dearest Harry. Though I am so patient I shall count\nthe hours till you come for me. Dearest Harry!\" Then she bore with\nhim, as he pressed her close to his bosom, and kissed her lips, and\nher forehead, and her glossy hair. When he was gone she sat down\nalone for a few minutes on the old sofa, and hugged herself in her\nhappiness. What a happy wind that had been which had blown such a\nlover as that for her to Stratton!\n\n\"I think he's a good young man,\" said Mrs. Burton, as soon as she was\nleft with her old husband upstairs.\n\n\"Yes, he's a good young man. He means very well.\"\n\n\"But he is not idle; is he?\"\n\n\"No--no; he's not idle. And he's very clever;--too clever, I'm\nafraid. But I think he'll do well, though it may take him some time\nto settle.\"\n\n\"It seems so natural his taking to Flo; doesn't it? They've all taken\none when they went away, and they've all done very well. Deary me;\nhow sad the house will be when Flo has gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,--it'll make a difference that way. But what then? I wouldn't\nwish to keep one of 'em at home for that reason.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I think I'd feel ashamed of myself to have a daughter\nnot married, or not in the way to be married afore she's thirty. I\ncouldn't bear to think that no young man should take a fancy to a\ngirl of mine. But Flo's not twenty yet, and Carry, who was the oldest\nto go, wasn't four-and-twenty when Scarness took her.\" Thereupon the\nold lady put her handkerchief to the corner of her eyes, and wept\ngently.\n\n\"Flo isn't gone yet,\" said Mr. Burton.\n\n\"But I hope, B., it's not to be a long engagement. I don't like long\nengagements. It ain't good,--not for the girl; it ain't, indeed.\"\n\n\"We were engaged for seven years.\"\n\n\"People weren't so much in a hurry then at anything; but I ain't sure\nit was very good for me. And though we weren't just married, we were\nliving next door and saw each other. What'll come to Flo if she's to\nbe here and he's to be up in London, pleasuring himself?\"\n\n\"Flo must bear it as other girls do,\" said the father, as he got up\nfrom his chair.\n\n\"I think he's a good young man; I think he is,\" said the mother. \"But\ndon't stand out for too much for 'em to begin upon. What matters?\nSure if they were to be a little short you could help 'em.\" To such\na suggestion as this Mr. Burton thought it as well to make no answer,\nbut with ponderous steps descended to his office.\n\n\"Well, Harry,\" said Mr. Burton, \"so you're to be off in the morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I shall breakfast at home to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Ah,--when I was your age I always used to make an early start. Three\nhours before breakfast never does any hurt. But it shouldn't be more\nthan that. The wind gets into the stomach.\" Harry had no remark to\nmake on this, and waited, therefore, till Mr. Burton went on. \"And\nyou'll be up in London by the 10th of next month?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I intend to be at Mr. Beilby's office on the 11th.\"\n\n\"That's right. Never lose a day. In losing a day now, you don't lose\nwhat you might earn now in a day, but what you might be earning when\nyou're at your best. A young man should always remember that. You\ncan't dispense with a round in the ladder going up. You only make\nyour time at the top so much the shorter.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll find that I'm all right, sir. I don't mean to be\nidle.\"\n\n\"Pray don't. Of course, you know, I speak to you very differently\nfrom what I should do if you were simply going away from my office.\nWhat I shall have to give Florence will be very little,--that is,\ncomparatively little. She shall have a hundred a year, when she\nmarries, till I die; and after my death and her mother's she will\nshare with the others. But a hundred a year will be nothing to you.\"\n\n\"Won't it, sir? I think a very great deal of a hundred a year. I'm to\nhave a hundred and fifty from the office; and I should be ready to\nmarry on that to-morrow.\"\n\n\"You couldn't live on such an income,--unless you were to alter your\nhabits very much.\"\n\n\"But I will alter them.\"\n\n\"We shall see. You are so placed that by marrying you would lose a\nconsiderable income; and I would advise you to put off thinking of it\nfor the next two years.\"\n\n\"My belief is, that settling down would be the best thing in the\nworld to make me work.\"\n\n\"We'll try what a year will do. So Florence is to go to your father's\nhouse at Easter?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; she has been good enough to promise to come, if you have\nno objection.\"\n\n\"It is quite as well that they should know her early. I only\nhope they will like her as well as we like you. Now I'll say\ngood-night,--and good-by.\" Then Harry went, and walking up and down\nthe High Street of Stratton, thought of all that he had done during\nthe past year.\n\nOn his arrival at Stratton that idea of perpetual misery arising from\nblighted affection was still strong within his breast. He had given\nall his heart to a false woman who had betrayed him. He had risked\nall his fortune on one cast of the die, and, gambler-like, had lost\neverything. On the day of Julia's marriage he had shut himself up at\nthe school,--luckily it was a holiday,--and had flattered himself\nthat he had gone through some hours of intense agony. No doubt he\ndid suffer somewhat, for in truth he had loved the woman; but such\nsufferings are seldom perpetual, and with him they had been as easy\nof cure as with most others. A little more than a year had passed,\nand now he was already engaged to another woman. As he thought of\nthis he did not by any means accuse himself of inconstancy or of\nweakness of heart. It appeared to him now the most natural thing in\nthe world that he should love Florence Burton. In those old days\nhe had never seen Florence, and had hardly thought seriously of\nwhat qualities a man really wants in a wife. As he walked up and\ndown the hill of Stratton Street with the kiss of the dear, modest,\naffectionate girl still warm upon his lips, he told himself that a\nmarriage with such a one as Julia Brabazon would have been altogether\nfatal to his chance of happiness.\n\nAnd things had occurred and rumours had reached him which assisted\nhim much in adopting this view of the subject. It was known to\nall the Claverings,--and even to all others who cared about such\nthings,--that Lord and Lady Ongar were not happy together, and it\nhad been already said that Lady Ongar had misconducted herself.\nThere was a certain count whose name had come to be mingled with\nhers in a way that was, to say the least of it, very unfortunate.\nSir Hugh Clavering had declared, in Mrs. Clavering's hearing, though\nbut little disposed in general to make many revelations to any of\nthe family at the rectory, \"that he did not intend to take his\nsister-in-law's part. She had made her own bed, and she must lie upon\nit. She had known what Lord Ongar was before she had married him, and\nthe fault was her own.\" So much Sir Hugh had said, and, in saying\nit, had done all that in him lay to damn his sister-in-law's fair\nfame. Harry Clavering, little as he had lived in the world during\nthe last twelve months, still knew that some people told a different\nstory. The earl too and his wife had not been in England since their\nmarriage;--so that these rumours had been filtered to them at home\nthrough a foreign medium. During most of their time they had been in\nItaly, and now, as Harry knew, they were at Florence. He had heard\nthat Lord Ongar had declared his intention of suing for a divorce;\nbut that he supposed to be erroneous, as the two were still living\nunder the same roof. Then he heard that Lord Ongar was ill; and\nwhispers were spread abroad darkly and doubtingly, as though great\nmisfortunes were apprehended.\n\nHarry could not fail to tell himself that had Julia become his wife,\nas she had once promised, these whispers and this darkness would\nhardly have come to pass. But not on that account did he now regret\nthat her early vows had not been kept. Living at Stratton, he had\ntaught himself to think much of the quiet domesticities of life, and\nto believe that Florence Burton was fitter to be his wife than Julia\nBrabazon. He told himself that he had done well to find this out,\nand that he had been wise to act upon it. His wisdom had in truth\nconsisted in his capacity to feel that Florence was a nice girl,\nclever, well-minded, high-principled, and full of spirit,--and in\nfalling in love with her as a consequence. All his regard for the\nquiet domesticities had come from his love, and had had no share in\nproducing it. Florence was bright-eyed. No eyes were ever brighter,\neither in tears or in laughter. And when he came to look at her well\nhe found that he had been an idiot to think her plain. \"There are\nthings that grow to beauty as you look at them,--to exquisite beauty;\nand you are one of them,\" he had said to her. \"And there are men,\"\nshe had answered, \"who grow to flattery as you listen to them,--to\nimpudent flattery; and you are one of them.\" \"I thought you plain\nthe first day I saw you. That's not flattery.\" \"Yes, sir, it is; and\nyou mean it for flattery. But after all, Harry, it comes only to\nthis, that you want to tell me that you have learned to love me.\" He\nrepeated all this to himself as he walked up and down Stratton, and\ndeclared to himself that she was very lovely. It had been given to\nhim to ascertain this, and he was rather proud of himself. But he was\na little diffident about his father. He thought that, perhaps, his\nfather might see Florence as he himself had first seen her, and might\nnot have discernment enough to ascertain his mistake as he had done.\nBut Florence was not going to Clavering at once, and he would be able\nto give beforehand his own account of her. He had not been home since\nhis engagement had been a thing settled; but his position with regard\nto Florence had been declared by letter, and his mother had written\nto the young lady asking her to come to Clavering.\n\nWhen Harry got home all the family received him with congratulations.\n\"I am so glad to think that you should marry early,\" his mother\nsaid to him in a whisper. \"But I am not married yet, mother,\" he\nanswered.\n\n\"Do show me a lock of her hair,\" said Fanny, laughing. \"It's twice\nprettier hair than yours, though she doesn't think half so much about\nit as you do,\" said her brother, pinching Fanny's arm. \"But you'll\nshow me a lock, won't you?\" said Fanny.\n\n\"I'm so glad she's to be here at my marriage,\" said Mary, \"because\nthen Edward will know her. I'm so glad that he will see her.\" \"Edward\nwill have other fish to fry, and won't care much about her,\" said\nHarry.\n\n\"It seems you're going to do the regular thing,\" said his father,\n\"like all the good apprentices. Marry your master's daughter,\nand then become Lord Mayor of London.\" This was not the view in\nwhich it had pleased Harry to regard his engagement. All the other\n\"young men\" that had gone to Mr. Burton's had married Mr. Burton's\ndaughters,--or, at least, enough had done so to justify the Stratton\nassertion that all had fallen into the same trap. The Burtons, with\ntheir five girls, were supposed in Stratton to have managed their\naffairs very well, and something of these hints had reached Harry's\nears. He would have preferred that the thing should not have been\nmade so common, but he was not fool enough to make himself really\nunhappy on that head. \"I don't know much about becoming Lord Mayor,\"\nhe replied. \"That promotion doesn't lie exactly in our line.\" \"But\nmarrying your master's daughter does, it seems,\" said the Rector.\nHarry thought that this, as coming from his father, was almost\nill-natured, and therefore dropped the conversation.\n\n\"I'm sure we shall like her,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"I think that I shall like Harry's choice,\" said Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"I do hope Edward will like her,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Mary,\" said her sister, \"I do wish you were once married. When you\nare, you'll begin to have a self of your own again. Now you're no\nbetter than an unconscious echo.\"\n\n\"Wait for your own turn, my dear,\" said the mother.\n\nHarry had reached home on a Saturday, and the following Monday was\nChristmas-day. Lady Clavering, he was told, was at home at the\npark, and Sir Hugh had been there lately. No one from the house\nexcept the servants were seen at church either on the Sunday or on\nChristmas-day. \"But that shows nothing,\" said the Rector, speaking\nin anger. \"He very rarely does come, and when he does, it would be\nbetter that he should be away. I think that he likes to insult me\nby misconducting himself. They say that she is not well, and I can\neasily believe that all this about her sister makes her unhappy. If I\nwere you I would go up and call. Your mother was there the other day,\nbut did not see them. I think you'll find that he's away, hunting\nsomewhere. I saw the groom going off with three horses on Sunday\nafternoon. He always sends them by the church gate just as we're\ncoming out.\"\n\nSo Harry went up to the house, and found Lady Clavering at home. She\nwas looking old and careworn, but she was glad to see him. Harry was\nthe only one of the rectory family who had been liked at the great\nhouse since Sir Hugh's marriage, and he, had he cared to do so, would\nhave been made welcome there. But, as he had once said to Sir Hugh's\nsister-in-law, if he shot the Clavering game, he would be expected\nto do so in the guise of a head gamekeeper, and he did not choose to\nplay that part. It would not suit him to drink Sir Hugh's claret, and\nbe bidden to ring the bell, and to be asked to step into the stable\nfor this or that. He was a fellow of his college, and quite as big\na man, he thought, as Sir Hugh. He would not be a hanger-on at the\npark, and, to tell the truth, he disliked his cousin quite as much as\nhis father did. But there had even been a sort of friendship,--nay,\noccasionally almost a confidence, between him and Lady Clavering, and\nhe believed that by her he was really liked.\n\nLady Clavering had heard of his engagement, and of course\ncongratulated him. \"Who told you?\" he asked,--\"was it my mother?\"\n\n\"No; I have not seen your mother I don't know when. I think it was\nmy maid told me. Though we somehow don't see much of you all at the\nrectory, our servants are no doubt more gracious with the rectory\nservants. I'm sure she must be nice, Harry, or you would not have\nchosen her. I hope she has got some money.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think she is nice. She is coming here at Easter.\"\n\n\"Ah, we shall be away then, you know; and about the money?\"\n\n\"She will have a little, but very little;--a hundred a year.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry, is not that rash of you? Younger brothers should always\nget money. You're the same as a younger brother, you know.\"\n\n\"My idea is to earn my own bread. It's not very aristocratic, but,\nafter all, there are a great many more in the same boat with me.\"\n\n\"Of course you will earn your bread, but having a wife with money\nwould not hinder that. A girl is not the worse because she can bring\nsome help. However, I'm sure I hope you'll be happy.\"\n\n\"What I meant was that I think it best when the money comes from the\nhusband.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I ought to agree with you, because we never had any.\" Then\nthere was a pause. \"I suppose you've heard about Lord Ongar,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I have heard that he is very ill.\"\n\n\"Very ill. I believe there was no hope when we heard last; but Julia\nnever writes now.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that it is so bad as that,\" said Harry, not well knowing\nwhat else to say.\n\n\"As regards Julia, I do not know whether it may not be for the best.\nIt seems to be a cruel thing to say, but of course I cannot but think\nmost of her. You have heard, perhaps, that they have not been happy?\"\n\n\"Yes; I had heard that.\"\n\n\"Of course; and what is the use of pretending anything with you? You\nknow what people have said of her.\"\n\n\"I have never believed it.\"\n\n\"You always loved her, Harry. Oh, dear, I remember how unhappy that\nmade me once, and I was so afraid that Hugh would suspect it. She\nwould never have done for you;--would she, Harry?\"\n\n\"She did a great deal better for herself,\" said Harry.\n\n\"If you mean that ironically, you shouldn't say it now. If he dies,\nshe will be well off, of course, and people will in time forget what\nhas been said,--that is, if she will live quietly. The worst of it is\nthat she fears nothing.\"\n\n\"But you speak as though you thought she had been--been--\"\n\n\"I think she was probably imprudent, but I believe nothing worse\nthan that. But who can say what is absolutely wrong, and what only\nimprudent? I think she was too proud to go really astray. And then\nwith such a man as that, so difficult and so ill-tempered--! Sir Hugh\nthinks--\" But at that moment the door was opened and Sir Hugh came\nin.\n\n\"What does Sir Hugh think?\" said he.\n\n\"We were speaking of Lord Ongar,\" said Harry, sitting up and shaking\nhands with his cousin.\n\n\"Then, Harry, you were speaking on a subject that I would rather\nnot have discussed in this house. Do you understand that, Hermione?\nI will have no talking about Lord Ongar or his wife. We know very\nlittle, and what we hear is simply uncomfortable. Will you dine here\nto-day, Harry?\"\n\n\"Thank you, no; I have only just come home.\"\n\n\"And I am just going away. That is, I go to-morrow. I cannot stand\nthis place. I think it the dullest neighbourhood in all England, and\nthe most gloomy house I ever saw. Hermione likes it.\"\n\nTo this last assertion Lady Clavering expressed no assent; nor did\nshe venture to contradict him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nLADY ONGAR'S RETURN.\n\n\nBut Sir Hugh did not get away from Clavering Park on the next morning\nas he had intended. There came to him that same afternoon a message\nby telegraph, to say that Lord Ongar was dead. He had died at\nFlorence on the afternoon of Christmas-day, and Lady Ongar had\nexpressed her intention of coming at once to England.\n\n\"Why the devil doesn't she stay where she is?\" said Sir Hugh, to his\nwife. \"People would forget her there, and in twelve months time the\nrow would be all over.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she does not want to be forgotten,\" said Lady Clavering.\n\n\"Then she should want it. I don't care whether she has been guilty or\nnot. When a woman gets her name into such a mess as that, she should\nkeep in the background.\"\n\n\"I think you are unjust to her, Hugh.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. You don't suppose that I expect anything else. But\nif you mean to tell me that there would have been all this row if she\nhad been decently prudent, I tell you that you're mistaken.\"\n\n\"Only think what a man he was.\"\n\n\"She knew that when she took him, and should have borne with him\nwhile he lasted. A woman isn't to have seven thousand a year for\nnothing.\"\n\n\"But you forget that not a syllable has been proved against her, or\nbeen attempted to be proved. She has never left him, and now she has\nbeen with him in his last moments. I don't think you ought to be the\nfirst to turn against her.\"\n\n\"If she would remain abroad, I would do the best I could for her.\nShe chooses to return home; and as I think she's wrong, I won't have\nher here;--that's all. You don't suppose that I go about the world\naccusing her?\"\n\n\"I think you might do something to fight her battle for her.\"\n\n\"I will do nothing,--unless she takes my advice and remains abroad.\nYou must write to her now, and you will tell her what I say. It's an\ninfernal bore, his dying at this moment; but I suppose people won't\nexpect that I'm to shut myself up.\"\n\nFor one day only did the baronet shut himself up, and on the\nfollowing he went whither he had before intended.\n\nLady Clavering thought it proper to write a line to the rectory,\ninforming the family there that Lord Ongar was no more. This she\ndid in a note to Mrs. Clavering; and when it was received, there\ncame over the faces of them all that lugubrious look, which is, as a\nmatter of course, assumed by decorous people when tidings come of the\ndeath of any one who has been known to them, even in the most distant\nway. With the exception of Harry, all the rectory Claverings had been\nintroduced to Lord Ongar, and were now bound to express something\napproaching to sorrow. Will any one dare to call this hypocrisy? If\nit be so called, who in the world is not a hypocrite? Where is the\nman or woman who has not a special face for sorrow before company?\nThe man or woman who has no such face, would at once be accused of\nheartless impropriety.\n\n\"It is very sad,\" said Mrs. Clavering; \"only think, it is but little\nmore than a year since you married them!\"\n\n\"And twelve such months as they have been for her!\" said the Rector,\nshaking his head. His face was very lugubrious, for though as\na parson he was essentially a kindly, easy man, to whom humbug\nwas odious, and who dealt little in the austerities of clerical\ndenunciation, still he had his face of pulpit sorrow for the sins of\nthe people,--what I may perhaps call his clerical knack of gentle\ncondemnation,--and could therefore assume a solemn look, and a little\nsaddened motion of his head, with more ease than people who are not\noften called upon for such action.\n\n\"Poor woman!\" said Fanny, thinking of the woman's married sorrows,\nand her early widowhood.\n\n\"Poor man,\" said Mary, shuddering as she thought of the husband's\nfate.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Harry, almost sententiously, \"that no one in this\nhouse will condemn her upon such mere rumours as have been heard.\"\n\n\"Why should any one in this house condemn her,\" said the Rector,\n\"even if there were more than rumours? My dears, judge not, lest ye\nbe judged. As regards her, we are bound by close ties not to speak\nill of her--or even to think ill, unless we cannot avoid it. As far\nas I know, we have not even any reason for thinking ill.\" Then he\nwent out, changed the tone of his countenance among the rectory\nstables, and lit his cigar.\n\nThree days after that a second note was brought down from the great\nhouse to the rectory, and this was from Lady Clavering to Harry.\n\"Dear Harry,\" ran the note,--\"Could you find time to come up to me\nthis morning? Sir Hugh has gone to North Priory.--Ever yours, H. C.\"\nHarry, of course, went, and as he went, he wondered how Sir Hugh\ncould have had the heart to go to North Priory at such a moment.\nNorth Priory was a hunting seat some thirty miles from Clavering,\nbelonging to a great nobleman with whom Sir Hugh much consorted.\nHarry was grieved that his cousin had not resisted the temptation of\ngoing at such a time, but he was quick enough to perceive that Lady\nClavering alluded to the absence of her lord as a reason why Harry\nmight pay his visit to the house with satisfaction.\n\n\"I'm so much obliged to you for coming,\" said Lady Clavering. \"I want\nto know if you can do something for me.\" As she spoke, she had a\npaper in her hand which he immediately perceived to be a letter from\nItaly.\n\n\"I'll do anything I can, of course, Lady Clavering.\"\n\n\"But I must tell you, that I hardly know whether I ought to ask you.\nI'm doing what would make Hugh very angry. But he is so unreasonable,\nand so cruel about Julia. He condemns her simply because, as he says,\nthere is no smoke without fire. That is such a cruel thing to say\nabout a woman;--is it not?\"\n\nHarry thought that it was a cruel thing, but as he did not wish to\nspeak evil of Sir Hugh before Lady Clavering, he held his tongue.\n\n\"When we got the first news by telegraph, Julia said that she\nintended to come home at once. Hugh thinks that she should remain\nabroad for some time, and indeed I am not sure but that would be\nbest. At any rate he made me write to her, and advise her to stay. He\ndeclared that if she came at once he would do nothing for her. The\ntruth is, he does not want to have her here, for if she were again in\nthe house he would have to take her part, if ill-natured things were\nsaid.\"\n\n\"That's cowardly,\" said Harry, stoutly.\n\n\"Don't say that, Harry, till you have heard it all. If he believes\nthese things, he is right not to wish to meddle. He is very hard,\nand always believes evil. But he is not a coward. If she were here,\nliving with him as my sister, he would take her part, whatever he\nmight himself think.\"\n\n\"But why should he think ill of his own sister-in-law? I have never\nthought ill of her.\"\n\n\"You loved her, and he never did;--though I think he liked her too in\nhis way. But that's what he told me to do, and I did it. I wrote to\nher, advising her to remain at Florence till the warm weather comes,\nsaying that as she could not specially wish to be in London for the\nseason, I thought she would be more comfortable there than here;--and\nthen I added that Hugh also advised her to stay. Of course I did not\nsay that he would not have her here,--but that was his threat.\"\n\n\"She is not likely to press herself where she is not wanted.\"\n\n\"No,--and she will not forget her rank and her money;--for that must\nnow be hers. Julia can be quite as hard and as stubborn as he can.\nBut I did write as I say, and I think that if she had got my letter\nbefore she had written herself, she would perhaps have stayed. But\nhere is a letter from her, declaring that she will come at once. She\nwill be starting almost as soon as my letter gets there, and I am\nsure she will not alter her purpose now.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she should not come if she likes it.\"\n\n\"Only that she might be more comfortable there. But read what she\nsays. You need not read the first part. Not that there is any secret;\nbut it is about him and his last moments, and it would only pain\nyou.\"\n\nHarry longed to read the whole, but he did as he was bid, and began\nthe letter at the spot which Lady Clavering marked for him with her\nfinger. \"I have to start on the third, and as I shall stay nowhere\nexcept to sleep at Turin and Paris, I shall be home by the eighth;--I\nthink on the evening of the eighth. I shall bring only my own maid,\nand one of his men who desires to come back with me. I wish to have\napartments taken for me in London. I suppose Hugh will do as much as\nthis for me?\"\n\n\"I am quite sure Hugh won't,\" said Lady Clavering, who was watching\nhis eye as he read.\n\nHarry said nothing, but went on reading. \"I shall only want two\nsitting-rooms and two bedrooms,--one for myself and one for\nClara,--and should like to have them somewhere near Piccadilly,--in\nClarges Street, or about there. You can write me a line, or send me a\nmessage to the Hotel Bristol, at Paris. If anything fails, so that I\nshould not hear, I shall go to the Palace Hotel; and, in that case,\nshould telegraph for rooms from Paris.\"\n\n\"Is that all I'm to read?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"You can go on and see what she says as to her reason for coming.\" So\nHarry went on reading. \"I have suffered much, and of course I know\nthat I must suffer more; but I am determined that I will face the\nworst of it at once. It has been hinted to me that an attempt will be\nmade to interfere with the settlement--\" \"Who can have hinted that?\"\nsaid Harry. Lady Clavering suspected who might have done so, but she\nmade no answer. \"I can hardly think it possible; but, if it is done,\nI will not be out of the way. I have done my duty as best I could,\nand have done it under circumstances that I may truly say were\nterrible;--and I will go on doing it. No one shall say that I am\nashamed to show my face and claim my own. You will be surprised when\nyou see me. I have aged so much;--\"\n\n\"You need not go on,\" said Lady Clavering. \"The rest is about nothing\nthat signifies.\"\n\nThen Harry refolded the letter and gave it back to his companion.\n\n\"Sir Hugh is gone, and therefore I could not show him that in time to\ndo anything; but if I were to do so, he would simply do nothing, and\nlet her go to the hotel in London. Now that would be unkind;--would\nit not?\"\n\n\"Very unkind, I think.\"\n\n\"It would seem so cold to her on her return.\"\n\n\"Very cold. Will you not go and meet her?\"\n\nLady Clavering blushed as she answered. Though Sir Hugh was a tyrant\nto his wife, and known to be such, and though she knew that this was\nknown, she had never said that it was so to any of the Claverings;\nbut now she was driven to confess it. \"He would not let me go, Harry.\nI could not go without telling him, and if I told him he would forbid\nit.\"\n\n\"And she is to be all alone in London, without any friend?\"\n\n\"I shall go to her as soon as he will let me. I don't think he will\nforbid my going to her, perhaps after a day or two; but I know he\nwould not let me go on purpose to meet her.\"\n\n\"It does seem hard.\"\n\n\"But about the apartments, Harry? I thought that perhaps you would\nsee about them. After all that has passed I could not have asked you,\nonly that now, as you are engaged yourself, it is nearly the same as\nthough you were married. I would ask Archibald, only then there would\nbe a fuss between Archibald and Hugh; and somehow I look on you more\nas a brother-in-law than I do Archibald.\"\n\n\"Is Archie in London?\"\n\n\"His address is at his club, but I daresay he is at North Priory\nalso. At any rate, I shall say nothing to him.\"\n\n\"I was thinking he might have met her.\"\n\n\"Julia never liked him. And, indeed, I don't think she will care so\nmuch about being met. She was always independent in that way, and\nwould go over the world alone better than many men. But couldn't you\nrun up and manage about the apartments? A woman coming home as a\nwidow,--and in her position,--feels an hotel to be so public.\"\n\n\"I will see about the apartments.\"\n\n\"I knew you would. And there will be time for you to send to me, so\nthat I can write to Paris;--will there not? There is more than a\nweek, you know.\"\n\nBut Henry did not wish to go to London on this business immediately.\nHe had made up his mind that he would not only take the rooms, but\nthat he would also meet Lady Ongar at the station. He said nothing of\nthis to Lady Clavering, as, perhaps, she might not approve; but such\nwas his intention. He was wrong no doubt. A man in such cases should\ndo what he is asked to do, and do no more. But he repeated to himself\nthe excuse that Lady Clavering had made,--namely, that he was already\nthe same as a married man, and that, therefore, no harm could come of\nhis courtesy to his cousin's wife's sister. But he did not wish to\nmake two journeys to London, nor did he desire to be away for a full\nweek out of his holidays. Lady Clavering could not press him to go at\nonce, and, therefore, it was settled as he proposed. She would write\nto Paris immediately, and he would go up to London after three or\nfour days. \"If we only knew of any apartments, we could write,\" said\nLady Clavering. \"You could not know that they were comfortable,\" said\nHarry; \"and you will find that I will do it in plenty of time.\" Then\nhe took his leave; but Lady Clavering had still one other word to\nsay to him. \"You had better not say anything about all this at the\nrectory; had you?\" Harry, without considering much about it, said\nthat he would not mention it.\n\nThen he went away and walked again about the park, thinking of it\nall. He had not seen her since he had walked round the park, in his\nmisery, after parting with her in the garden. How much had happened\nsince then! She had been married in her glory, had become a countess,\nand then a widow, and was now returning with a tarnished name, almost\nrepudiated by those who had been her dearest friends; but with rank\nand fortune at her command,--and again a free woman. He could not\nbut think what might have been his chance were it not for Florence\nBurton! But much had happened to him also. He had almost perished\nin his misery;--so he told himself;--but had once more \"tricked his\nbeams,\"--that was his expression to himself,--and was now \"flaming in\nthe forehead\" of a glorious love. And even if there had been no such\nlove, would a widowed countess with a damaged name have suited his\nambition, simply because she had the rich dower of the poor wretch\nto whom she had sold herself? No, indeed. There could be no question\nof renewed vows between them now;--there could have been no such\nquestion even had there been no \"glorious love,\" which had accrued\nto him almost as his normal privilege in right of his pupilage in Mr.\nBurton's office. No;--there could be, there could have been, nothing\nnow between him and the widowed Countess of Ongar. But, nevertheless,\nhe liked the idea of meeting her in London. He felt some triumph in\nthe thought that he should be the first to touch her hand on her\nreturn after all that she had suffered. He would be very courteous to\nher, and would spare no trouble that would give her any ease. As for\nher rooms, he would see to everything of which he could think that\nmight add to her comfort; and a wish crept upon him, uninvited, that\nshe might be conscious of what he had done for her.\n\nWould she be aware, he wondered, that he was engaged? Lady Clavering\nhad known it for the last three months, and would probably have\nmentioned the circumstance in a letter. But perhaps not. The sisters,\nhe knew, had not been good correspondents; and he almost wished that\nshe might not know it. \"I should not care to be talking to her about\nFlorence,\" he said to himself.\n\nIt was very strange that they should come to meet in such a way,\nafter all that had passed between them in former days. Would it occur\nto her that he was the only man she had ever loved?--for, of course,\nas he well knew, she had never loved her husband. Or would she now be\ntoo callous to everything but the outer world to think at all of such\na subject? She had said that she was aged, and he could well believe\nit. Then he pictured her to himself in her weeds, worn, sad, thin,\nbut still proud and handsome. He had told Florence of his early love\nfor the woman whom Lord Ongar had married, and had described with\nrapture his joy that that early passion had come to nothing. Now he\nwould have to tell Florence of this meeting; and he thought of the\ncomparison he would make between her bright young charms and the\nshipwrecked beauty of the widow. On the whole, he was proud that he\nhad been selected for the commission, as he liked to think of himself\nas one to whom things happened which were out of the ordinary course.\nHis only objection to Florence was that she had come to him so much\nin the ordinary course.\n\n\"I suppose the truth is you are tired of our dulness,\" said his\nfather to him, when he declared his purpose of going up to London,\nand, in answer to certain questions that were asked him, had\nhesitated to tell his business.\n\n\"Indeed, it is not so,\" said Harry, earnestly; \"but I have a\ncommission to execute for a certain person, and I cannot explain what\nit is.\"\n\n\"Another secret;--eh, Harry?\"\n\n\"I am very sorry,--but it is a secret. It is not one of my own\nseeking; that is all I can say.\" His mother and sisters also asked\nhim a question or two; but when he became mysterious, they did not\npersevere. \"Of course it is something about Florence,\" said Fanny.\n\"I'll be bound he is going to meet her. What will you bet me, Harry,\nyou don't go to the play with Florence before you come home?\" To this\nHenry deigned no answer; and after that no more questions were asked.\n\nHe went up to London and took rooms in Bolton Street. There\nwas a pretty fresh-looking light drawing-room, or, indeed, two\ndrawing-rooms, and a small dining-room, and a large bed-room looking\nover upon the trees of some great nobleman's garden. As Harry stood\nat the window it seemed so odd to him that he should be there. And he\nwas busy about everything in the chamber, seeing that all things were\nclean and well ordered. Was the woman of the house sure of her cook?\nSure; of course she was sure. Had not old Lady Dimdaff lived there\nfor two years, and nobody ever was so particular about her victuals\nas Lady Dimdaff. \"And would Lady Ongar keep her own carriage?\" As to\nthis Harry could say nothing. Then came the question of price, and\nHarry found his commission very difficult. The sum asked seemed to\nbe enormous. \"Seven guineas a week at that time of the year!\" Lady\nDimdaff had always paid seven guineas. \"But that was in the season,\"\nsuggested Harry. To this the woman replied that it was the season\nnow. Harry felt that he did not like to drive a bargain for the\nCountess, who would probably care very little what she paid, and\ntherefore assented. But a guinea a day for lodgings did seem a great\ndeal of money. He was prepared to marry and commence housekeeping\nupon a less sum for all his expenses. However, he had done his\ncommission, had written to Lady Clavering, and had telegraphed to\nParis. He had almost brought himself to write to Lady Ongar, but when\nthe moment came he abstained. He had sent the telegram as from H.\nClavering. She might think that it came from Hugh if she pleased.\n\nHe was unable not to attend specially to his dress when he went to\nmeet her at the Victoria Station. He told himself that he was an\nass,--but still he went on being an ass. During the whole afternoon\nhe could do nothing but think of what he had in hand. He was to tell\nFlorence everything, but had Florence known the actual state of his\nmind, I doubt whether she would have been satisfied with him. The\ntrain was due at 8 P.M. He dined at the Oxford and Cambridge Club at\nsix, and then went to his lodgings to take one last look at his outer\nman. The evening was very fine, but he went down to the station in a\ncab, because he would not meet Lady Ongar in soiled boots. He told\nhimself again that he was an ass; and then tried to console himself\nby thinking that such an occasion as this seldom happened once to any\nman,--could hardly happen more than once to any man. He had hired\na carriage for her, not thinking it fit that Lady Ongar should be\ntaken to her new home in a cab; and when he was at the station, half\nan hour before the proper time, was very fidgety because it had not\ncome. Ten minutes before eight he might have been seen standing at\nthe entrance to the station looking out anxiously for the vehicle.\nThe man was there, of course, in time, but Harry made himself angry\nbecause he could not get the carriage so placed that Lady Ongar might\nbe sure of stepping into it without leaving the platform. Punctually\nto the moment the coming train announced itself by its whistle, and\nHarry Clavering felt himself to be in a flutter.\n\nThe train came up along the platform, and Harry stood there expecting\nto see Julia Brabazon's head projected from the first window that\ncaught his eye. It was of Julia Brabazon's head, and not of Lady\nOngar's, that he was thinking. But he saw no sign of her presence\nwhile the carriages were coming to a stand-still, and the platform\nwas covered with passengers before he discovered her whom he was\nseeking. At last he encountered in the crowd a man in livery, and\nfound from him that he was Lady Ongar's servant. \"I have come to meet\nLady Ongar,\" said Harry, \"and have got a carriage for her.\" Then the\nservant found his mistress, and Harry offered his hand to a tall\nwoman in black. She wore a black straw hat with a veil, but the veil\nwas so thick that Harry could not at all see her face.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Clavering?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"it is I. Your sister asked me to take rooms for\nyou, and as I was in town I thought I might as well meet you to see\nif you wanted anything. Can I get the luggage?\"\n\n\"Thank you;--the man will do that. He knows where the things are.\"\n\n\"I ordered a carriage;--shall I show him where it is? Perhaps you\nwill let me take you to it? They are so stupid here. They would not\nlet me bring it up.\"\n\n\"It will do very well I'm sure. It's very kind of you. The rooms are\nin Bolton Street. I have the number here. Oh! thank you.\" But she\nwould not take his arm. So he led the way, and stood at the door\nwhile she got into the carriage with her maid. \"I'd better show the\nman where you are now.\" This he did, and afterwards shook hands with\nher through the carriage window. This was all he saw of her, and the\nwords which have been repeated were all that were spoken. Of her face\nhe had not caught a glimpse.\n\nAs he went home to his lodgings he was conscious that the interview\nhad not been satisfactory. He could not say what more he wanted, but\nhe felt that there was something amiss. He consoled himself, however,\nby reminding himself that Florence Burton was the girl whom he had\nreally loved, and not Julia Brabazon. Lady Ongar had given him no\ninvitation to come and see her, and therefore he determined that he\nwould return home on the following day without going near Bolton\nStreet. He had pictured to himself beforehand the sort of description\nhe would give to Lady Clavering of her sister; but, seeing how things\nhad turned out, he made up his mind that he would say nothing of the\nmeeting. Indeed, he would not go up to the great house at all. He had\ndone Lady Clavering's commission,--at some little trouble and expense\nto himself, and there should be an end of it. Lady Ongar would not\nmention that she had seen him. He doubted, indeed, whether she would\nremember whom she had seen. For any good that he had done, or for\nany sentiment that there had been, his cousin Hugh's butler might as\nwell have gone to the train. In this mood he returned home, consoling\nhimself with the fitness of things which had given him Florence\nBurton instead of Julia Brabazon for a wife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE REV. SAMUEL SAUL.\n\n\nDuring Harry's absence in London, a circumstance had occurred at the\nrectory which had surprised some of them and annoyed others a good\ndeal. Mr. Saul, the curate, had made an offer to Fanny. The Rector\nand Fanny declared themselves to be both surprised and annoyed. That\nthe Rector was in truth troubled by the thing was very evident. Mrs.\nClavering said that she had almost suspected it,--that she was at any\nrate not surprised; as to the offer itself, of course she was sorry\nthat it should have been made, as it could not suit Fanny to accept\nit. Mary was surprised, as she had thought Mr. Saul to be wholly\nintent on other things; but she could not see any reason why the\noffer should be regarded as being on his part unreasonable.\n\n\"How can you say so, mamma?\" Such had been Fanny's indignant\nexclamation when Mrs. Clavering had hinted that Mr. Saul's proceeding\nhad been expected by her.\n\n\"Simply because I saw that he liked you, my dear. Men under such\ncircumstances have different ways of showing their liking.\"\n\nFanny, who had seen all of Mary's love-affair from the beginning to\nthe end, and who had watched the Reverend Edward Fielding in all\nhis very conspicuous manoeuvres, would not agree to this. Edward\nFielding from the first moment of his intimate acquaintance with Mary\nhad left no doubt of his intentions on the mind of any one. He had\ntalked to Mary and walked with Mary whenever he was allowed or found\nit possible to do so. When driven to talk to Fanny, he had always\ntalked about Mary. He had been a lover of the good, old, plainspoken\nstamp, about whom there had been no mistake. From the first moment of\nhis coming much about Clavering Rectory the only question had been\nabout his income. \"I don't think Mr. Saul ever said a word to me\nexcept about the poor people and the church-services,\" said Fanny.\n\"That was merely his way,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"Then he must be a\ngoose,\" said Fanny. \"I am very sorry if I have made him unhappy, but\nhe had no business to come to me in that way.\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall have to look for another curate,\" said the Rector.\nBut this was said in private to his wife.\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"With many men it\nwould be so; but I think you will find that he will take an answer,\nand that there will be an end of it.\"\n\nFanny, perhaps, had a right to be indignant, for certainly Mr. Saul\nhad given her no fair warning of his intention. Mary had for some\nmonths been intent rather on Mr. Fielding's church matters than\non those going on in her own parish, and therefore there had been\nnothing singular in the fact that Mr. Saul had said more on such\nmatters to Fanny than to her sister. Fanny was eager and active, and\nas Mr. Saul was very eager and very active, it was natural that they\nshould have had some interests in common. But there had been no\nprivate walkings, and no talkings that could properly be called\nprivate. There was a certain book which Fanny kept, containing the\nnames of all the poor people in the parish, to which Mr. Saul had\naccess equally with herself; but its contents were of a most prosaic\nnature, and when she had sat over it in the rectory drawing-room,\nwith Mr. Saul by her side, striving to extract more than twelve\npennies out of charity shillings, she had never thought that it would\nlead to a declaration of love.\n\nHe had never called her Fanny in his life,--not up to the moment\nwhen she declined the honour of becoming Mrs. Saul. The offer itself\nwas made in this wise. She had been at the house of old Widow Tubb,\nhalf-way between Cumberly Green and the little village of Clavering,\nstriving to make that rheumatic old woman believe that she had not\nbeen cheated by a general conspiracy of the parish in the matter of\na distribution of coal, when, just as she was about to leave the\ncottage, Mr. Saul came up. It was then past four, and the evening was\nbecoming dark, and there was, moreover, a slight drizzle of rain. It\nwas not a tempting evening for a walk of a mile and a half through\na very dirty lane; but Fanny Clavering did not care much for such\nthings, and was just stepping out into the mud and moisture, with her\ndress well looped up, when Mr. Saul accosted her.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll be very wet, Miss Clavering.\"\n\n\"That will be better than going without my cup of tea, Mr. Saul,\nwhich I should have to do if I stayed any longer with Mrs. Tubb. And\nI have got an umbrella.\"\n\n\"But it is so dark and dirty,\" said he.\n\n\"I'm used to that, as you ought to know.\"\n\n\"Yes; I do know it,\" said he, walking on with her. \"I do know that\nnothing ever turns you away from the good work.\"\n\nThere was something in the tone of his voice which Fanny did not\nlike. He had never complimented her before. They had been very\nintimate and had often scolded each other. Fanny would accuse him of\nexacting too much from the people, and he would retort upon her that\nshe coddled them. Fanny would often decline to obey him, and he would\nmake angry hints as to his clerical authority. In this way they had\nworked together pleasantly, without any of the awkwardness which on\nother terms would have arisen between a young man and a young woman.\nBut now that he began to praise her with some peculiar intention of\nmeaning in his tone, she was confounded. She had made no immediate\nanswer to him, but walked on rapidly through the mud and slush.\n\n\"You are very constant,\" said he; \"I have not been two years at\nClavering without finding that out.\" It was becoming worse and worse.\nIt was not so much his words which provoked her as the tone in which\nthey were uttered. And yet she had not the slightest idea of what\nwas coming. If, thoroughly admiring her devotion and mistaken as to\nher character, he were to ask her to become a Protestant nun, or\nsuggest to her that she should leave her home and go as nurse into a\nhospital, then there would have occurred the sort of folly of which\nshe believed him to be capable. Of the folly which he now committed,\nshe had not believed him to be capable.\n\nIt had come on to rain hard, and she held her umbrella low over her\nhead. He also was walking with an open umbrella in his hand, so that\nthey were not very close to each other. Fanny, as she stepped on\nimpetuously, put her foot into the depth of a pool, and splashed\nherself thoroughly.\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear,\" said she; \"this is very disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Miss Clavering,\" said he, \"I have been looking for an opportunity to\nspeak to you, and I do not know when I may find another so suitable\nas this.\" She still believed that some proposition was to be made to\nher which would be disagreeable, and perhaps impertinent,--but it\nnever occurred to her that Mr. Saul was in want of a wife.\n\n\"Doesn't it rain too hard for talking?\" she said.\n\n\"As I have begun I must go on with it now,\" he replied, raising his\nvoice a little, as though it were necessary that he should do so to\nmake her hear him through the rain and darkness. She moved a little\nfurther away from him with unthinking irritation; but still he went\non with his purpose. \"Miss Clavering, I know that I am ill-suited to\nplay the part of a lover;--very ill suited.\" Then she gave a start\nand again splashed herself sadly. \"I have never read how it is done\nin books, and have not allowed my imagination to dwell much on such\nthings.\"\n\n\"Mr. Saul, don't go on; pray don't.\" Now she did understand what was\ncoming.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Clavering, I must go on now; but not on that account would\nI press you to give me an answer to-day. I have learned to love you,\nand if you can love me in return, I will take you by the hand, and\nyou shall be my wife. I have found that in you which I have been\nunable not to love,--not to covet that I may bind it to myself as my\nown for ever. Will you think of this, and give me an answer when you\nhave considered it fully?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Mr. Saul proposes.]\n\n\nHe had not spoken altogether amiss, and Fanny, though she was very\nangry with him, was conscious of this. The time he had chosen might\nnot be considered suitable for a declaration of love, nor the place;\nbut having chosen them, he had, perhaps, made the best of them. There\nhad been no hesitation in his voice, and his words had been perfectly\naudible.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Saul, of course I can assure you at once,\" said Fanny.\n\"There need not be any consideration. I really have never thought--\"\nFanny, who knew her own mind on the matter thoroughly, was hardly\nable to express herself plainly and without incivility. As soon as\nthat phrase \"of course\" had passed her lips, she felt that it should\nnot have been spoken. There was no need that she should insult him\nby telling him that such a proposition from him could have but one\nanswer.\n\n\"No, Miss Clavering; I know you have never thought of it, and\ntherefore it would be well that you should take time. I have not been\nable to make manifest to you by little signs, as men do who are less\nawkward, all the love that I have felt for you. Indeed, could I have\ndone so, I should still have hesitated till I had thoroughly resolved\nthat I might be better with a wife than without one; and had resolved\nalso, as far as that might be possible for me, that you also would be\nbetter with a husband.\"\n\n\"Mr. Saul, really that should be for me to think of.\"\n\n\"And for me also. Can any man offer to marry a woman,--to bind a\nwoman for life to certain duties, and to so close an obligation,\nwithout thinking whether such bonds would be good for her as well as\nfor himself? Of course you must think for yourself;--and so have I\nthought for you. You should think for yourself, and you should think\nalso for me.\"\n\nFanny was quite aware that as regarded herself, the matter was one\nwhich required no more thinking. Mr. Saul was not a man with whom she\ncould bring herself to be in love. She had her own ideas as to what\nwas loveable in men, and the eager curate, splashing through the\nrain by her side, by no means came up to her standard of excellence.\nShe was unconsciously aware that he had altogether mistaken her\ncharacter, and given her credit for more abnegation of the world\nthan she pretended to possess, or was desirous of possessing. Fanny\nClavering was in no hurry to get married. I do not know that she\nhad even made up her mind that marriage would be a good thing for\nher; but she had an untroubled conviction that if she did marry, her\nhusband should have a house and an income. She had no reliance on her\nown power of living on a potato, and with one new dress every year.\nA comfortable home, with nice, comfortable things around her, ease\nin money matters, and elegance in life, were charms with which she\nhad not quarrelled, and, though she did not wish to be hard upon\nMr. Saul on account of his mistake, she did feel that in making his\nproposition he had blundered. Because she chose to do her duty as a\nparish clergyman's daughter, he thought himself entitled to regard\nher as devot\u00c3\u00a9e, who would be willing to resign everything to become\nthe wife of a clergyman, who was active, indeed, but who had not one\nshilling of income beyond his curacy. \"Mr. Saul,\" she said, \"I can\nassure you I need take no time for further thinking. It cannot be as\nyou would have it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have been abrupt. Indeed, I feel that it is so, though I\ndid not know how to avoid it.\"\n\n\"It would have made no difference. Indeed, indeed, Mr. Saul, nothing\nof that kind could have made a difference.\"\n\n\"Will you grant me this;--that I may speak to you again on the same\nsubject after six months?\"\n\n\"It cannot do any good.\"\n\n\"It will do this good;--that for so much time you will have had the\nidea before you.\" Fanny thought that she would have Mr. Saul himself\nbefore her, and that that would be enough. Mr. Saul, with his rusty\nclothes and his thick, dirty shoes, and his weak, blinking eyes,\nand his mind always set upon the one wish of his life, could not be\nmade to present himself to her in the guise of a lover. He was one\nof those men of whom women become very fond with the fondness of\nfriendship, but from whom young women seem to be as far removed in\nthe way of love as though they belonged to some other species. \"I\nwill not press you further,\" said he, \"as I gather by your tone that\nit distresses you.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry if I distress you, but really, Mr. Saul, I could give\nyou,--I never could give you any other answer.\"\n\nThen they walked on silently through the rain,--silently, without\na single word,--for more than half a mile, till they reached the\nrectory gate. Here it was necessary that they should, at any rate,\nspeak to each other, and for the last three hundred yards Fanny had\nbeen trying to find the words which would be suitable. But he was the\nfirst to break the silence. \"Good-night, Miss Clavering,\" he said,\nstopping and putting out his hand.\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Saul.\"\n\n\"I hope that there may be no difference in our bearing to each other,\nbecause of what I have to-day said to you?\"\n\n\"Not on my part;--that is, if you will forget it.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Clavering; I shall not forget it. If it had been a thing to\nbe forgotten, I should not have spoken. I certainly shall not forget\nit.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Mr. Saul.\"\n\n\"I shall not forget it even in the way that you mean. But still I\nthink you need not fear me, because you know that I love you. I think\nI can promise that you need not withdraw yourself from me, because of\nwhat has passed. But you will tell your father and your mother, and\nof course will be guided by them. And now, good-night.\" Then he went,\nand she was astonished at finding that he had had much the best of it\nin his manner of speaking and conducting himself. She had refused him\nvery curtly, and he had borne it well. He had not been abashed, nor\nhad he become sulky, nor had he tried to melt her by mention of his\nown misery. In truth he had done it very well,--only that he should\nhave known better than to make any such attempt at all.\n\nMr. Saul had been right in one thing. Of course she told her mother,\nand of course her mother told her father. Before dinner that evening\nthe whole affair was being debated in the family conclave. They\nall agreed that Fanny had had no alternative but to reject the\nproposition at once. That, indeed, was so thoroughly taken for\ngranted, that the point was not discussed. But there came to be\na difference between the Rector and Fanny on one side, and Mrs.\nClavering and Mary on the other. \"Upon my word,\" said the Rector,\n\"I think it was very impertinent.\" Fanny would not have liked to use\nthat word herself, but she loved her father for using it.\n\n\"I do not see that,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"He could not know what\nFanny's views in life might be. Curates very often marry out of the\nhouses of the clergymen with whom they are placed, and I do not see\nwhy Mr. Saul should be debarred from the privilege of trying.\"\n\n\"If he had got to like Fanny what else was he to do?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Oh, Mary, don't talk such nonsense,\" said Fanny. \"Got to like!\nPeople shouldn't get to like people unless there's some reason for\nit.\"\n\n\"What on earth did he intend to live on?\" demanded the Rector.\n\n\"Edward had nothing to live on, when you first allowed him to come\nhere,\" said Mary.\n\n\"But Edward had prospects, and Saul, as far as I know, has none. He\nhad given no one the slightest notice. If the man in the moon had\ncome to Fanny I don't suppose she would have been more surprised.\"\n\n\"Not half so much, papa.\"\n\nThen it was that Mrs. Clavering had declared that she was not\nsurprised,--that she had suspected it, and had almost made Fanny\nangry by saying so. When Harry came back two days afterwards, the\nfamily news was imparted to him, and he immediately ranged himself\non his father's side. \"Upon my word I think that he ought to be\nforbidden the house,\" said Harry. \"He has forgotten himself in making\nsuch a proposition.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Harry,\" said his mother. \"If he can be comfortable\ncoming here, there can be no reason why he should be uncomfortable.\nIt would be an injustice to him to ask him to go, and a great trouble\nto your father to find another curate that would suit him so well.\"\nThere could be no doubt whatever as to the latter proposition, and\ntherefore it was quietly argued that Mr. Saul's fault, if there had\nbeen a fault, should be condoned. On the next day he came to the\nrectory, and they were all astonished at the ease with which he bore\nhimself. It was not that he affected any special freedom of manner,\nor that he altogether avoided any change in his mode of speaking to\nthem. A slight blush came upon his sallow face as he first spoke to\nMrs. Clavering, and he hardly did more than say a single word to\nFanny. But he carried himself as though conscious of what he had\ndone, but in no degree ashamed of the doing it. The Rector's manner\nto him was stiff and formal;--seeing which Mrs. Clavering spoke to\nhim gently, and with a smile. \"I saw you were a little hard on him,\nand therefore I tried to make up for it,\" said she afterwards. \"You\nwere quite right,\" said the husband. \"You always are. But I wish he\nhad not made such a fool of himself. It will never be the same thing\nwith him again.\" Harry hardly spoke to Mr. Saul the first time he met\nhim, all of which Mr. Saul understood perfectly.\n\n\"Clavering,\" he said to Harry, a day or two after this, \"I hope there\nis to be no difference between you and me.\"\n\n\"Difference! I don't know what you mean by difference.\"\n\n\"We were good friends, and I hope that we are to remain so. No doubt\nyou know what has taken place between me and your sister.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--I have been told, of course.\"\n\n\"What I mean is, that I hope you are not going to quarrel with me on\nthat account? What I did, is it not what you would have done in my\nposition?--only you would have done it successfully?\"\n\n\"I think a fellow should have some income, you know.\"\n\n\"Can you say that you would have waited for income before you spoke\nof marriage?\"\n\n\"I think it might have been better that you should have gone to my\nfather.\"\n\n\"It may be that that is the rule in such things, but if so I do not\nknow it. Would she have liked that better?\"\n\n\"Well;--I can't say.\"\n\n\"You are engaged? Did you go to the young lady's family first?\"\n\n\"I can't say I did; but I think I had given them some ground to\nexpect it. I fancy they all knew what I was about. But it's over now,\nand I don't know that we need say anything more about it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Nothing can be said that would be of any use; but I\ndo not think I have done anything that you should resent.\"\n\n\"Resent is a strong word. I don't resent it, or, at any rate, I\nwon't; and there may be an end of it.\" After this, Harry was more\ngracious with Mr. Saul, having an idea that the curate had made some\nsort of apology for what he had done. But that, I fancy, was by\nno means Mr. Saul's view of the case. Had he offered to marry the\ndaughter of the Archbishop of Canterbury, instead of the daughter of\nthe Rector of Clavering, he would not have imagined that his doing so\nneeded an apology.\n\nThe day after his return from London Lady Clavering sent for Harry up\nto the house. \"So you saw my sister in London?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry blushing; \"as I was in town, I thought that I might\nas well meet her. But, as you said, Lady Ongar is able to do without\nmuch assistance of that kind. I only just saw her.\"\n\n\"Julia took it so kindly of you; but she seems surprised that you\ndid not come to her the following day. She thought you would have\ncalled.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no. I fancied that she would be too tired and too busy to\nwish to see any mere acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Ah, Harry, I see that she has angered you,\" said Lady Clavering;\n\"otherwise you would not talk about mere acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Angered me! How could she anger me? What I meant\nwas that at such a time she would probably wish to see no one but\npeople on business,--unless it was some one near to her, like\nyourself or Hugh.\"\n\n\"Hugh will not go to her.\"\n\n\"But you will do so; will you not?\"\n\n\"Before long I will. You don't seem to understand, Harry,--and,\nperhaps, it would be odd if you did,--that I can't run up to town and\nback as I please. I ought not to tell you this, I dare say, but one\nfeels as though one wanted to talk to some one about one's affairs.\nAt the present moment, I have not the money to go,--even if there\nwere no other reason.\" These last words she said almost in a whisper,\nand then she looked up into the young man's face, to see what he\nthought of the communication she had made him.\n\n\"Oh, money!\" he said. \"You could soon get money. But I hope it won't\nbe long before you go.\"\n\nOn the next morning but one a letter came by the post for him from\nLady Ongar. When he saw the handwriting, which he knew, his heart\nwas at once in his mouth, and he hesitated to open his letter at the\nbreakfast-table. He did open it and read it, but, in truth, he hardly\nunderstood it or digested it till he had taken it away with him up to\nhis own room. The letter, which was very short, was as follows:--\n\n\n   DEAR FRIEND,\n\n   I felt your kindness in coming to me at the station so\n   much!--the more, perhaps, because others, who owed me more\n   kindness, have paid me less. Don't suppose that I allude\n   to poor Hermione, for, in truth, I have no intention to\n   complain of her. I thought, perhaps, you would have come\n   to see me before you left London; but I suppose you were\n   hurried. I hear from Clavering that you are to be up about\n   your new profession in a day or two. Pray come and see\n   me before you have been many days in London. I shall\n   have so much to say to you! The rooms you have taken are\n   everything that I wanted, and I am so grateful!\n\n   Yours ever,\n\n   J. O.\n\n\nWhen Harry had read and had digested this, he became aware that he\nwas again fluttered. \"Poor creature!\" he said to himself; \"it is sad\nto think how much she is in want of a friend.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nSOME SCENES IN THE LIFE OF A COUNTESS.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nAbout the middle of January Harry Clavering went up to London, and\nsettled himself to work at Mr. Beilby's office. Mr. Beilby's office\nconsisted of four or five large chambers, overlooking the river from\nthe bottom of Adam Street in the Adelphi, and here Harry found a\ntable for himself in the same apartment with three other pupils. It\nwas a fine old room, lofty, and with large windows, ornamented on the\nceiling with Italian scrollwork, and a flying goddess in the centre.\nIn days gone by the house had been the habitation of some great\nrich man, who had there enjoyed the sweet breezes from the river\nbefore London had become the London of the present days, and when no\nembankment had been needed for the Thames. Nothing could be nicer\nthan this room, or more pleasant than the table and seat which he was\nto occupy near a window; but there was something in the tone of the\nother men towards him which did not quite satisfy him. They probably\ndid not know that he was a fellow of a college, and treated him\nalmost as they might have done had he come to them direct from King's\nCollege, in the Strand, or from the London University. Down at\nStratton, a certain amount of honour had been paid to him. They had\nknown there who he was, and had felt some deference for him. They had\nnot slapped him on the back, or poked him in the ribs, or even called\nhim old fellow, before some length of acquaintance justified such\nappellation. But up at Mr. Beilby's, in the Adelphi, one young man,\nwho was certainly his junior in age, and who did not seem as yet\nto have attained any high position in the science of engineering,\nmanifestly thought that he was acting in a friendly and becoming way\nby declaring the stranger to be a lad of wax on the second day of his\nappearance. Harry Clavering was not disinclined to believe that he\nwas a \"lad of wax,\" or \"a brick,\" or \"a trump,\" or \"no small beer.\"\nBut he desired that such complimentary and endearing appellations\nshould be used to him only by those who had known him long enough to\nbe aware that he deserved them. Mr. Joseph Walliker certainly was not\nas yet among this number.\n\nThere was a man at Mr. Beilby's who was entitled to greet him with\nendearing terms, and to be so greeted himself, although Harry had\nnever seen him till he attended for the first time at the Adelphi.\nThis was Theodore Burton, his future brother-in-law, who was now\nthe leading man in the London house;--the leading man as regarded\nbusiness, though he was not as yet a partner. It was understood that\nthis Mr. Burton was to come in when his father went out; and in\nthe meantime he received a salary of a thousand a year as managing\nclerk. A very hard-working, steady, intelligent man was Mr. Theodore\nBurton, with a bald head, a high forehead, and that look of constant\nwork about him which such men obtain. Harry Clavering could not\nbring himself to take a liking to him, because he wore cotton\ngloves and had an odious habit of dusting his shoes with his\npocket-handkerchief. Twice Harry saw him do this on the first day\nof their acquaintance, and he regretted it exceedingly. The cotton\ngloves too were offensive, as were also the thick shoes which had\nbeen dusted; but the dusting was the great sin.\n\nAnd there was something which did not quite please Harry in Mr.\nTheodore Burton's manner, though the gentleman had manifestly\nintended to be very kind to him. When Burton had been speaking to him\nfor a minute or two, it flashed across Harry's mind that he had not\nbound himself to marry the whole Burton family, and that, perhaps,\nhe must take some means to let that fact be known. \"Theodore,\" as\nhe had so often heard the younger Mr. Burton called by loving lips,\nseemed to claim him as his own, called him Harry, and upbraided\nhim with friendly warmth for not having come direct to his,--Mr.\nBurton's,--house in Onslow Crescent. \"Pray feel yourself at home\nthere,\" said Mr. Burton. \"I hope you'll like my wife. You needn't be\nafraid of being made to be idle if you spend your evenings there, for\nwe are all reading people. Will you come and dine to-day?\" Florence\nhad told him that she was her brother Theodore's favourite sister,\nand that Theodore as a husband and a brother, and a man, was perfect.\nBut Theodore had dusted his boots with his handkerchief, and Harry\nClavering would not dine with him on that day.\n\nAnd then it was painfully manifest to him that every one in the\noffice knew his destiny with reference to old Burton's daughter. He\nhad been one of the Stratton men, and no more than any other had he\ngone unscathed through the Stratton fire. He had been made to do the\nregular thing, as Granger, Scarness, and others had done it. Stratton\nwould be safer ground now, as Clavering had taken the last. That was\nthe feeling on the matter which seemed to belong to others. It was\nnot that Harry thought in this way of his own Florence. He knew well\nenough what a lucky fellow he was to have won such a girl. He was\nwell aware how widely his Florence differed from Carry Scarness. He\ndenied to himself indignantly that he had any notion of repenting\nwhat he had done. But he did wish that these private matters might\nhave remained private, and that all the men at Beilby's had not\nknown of his engagement. When Walliker, on the fourth day of their\nacquaintance, asked him if it was all right at Stratton, he made up\nhis mind that he hated Walliker, and that he would hate Walliker to\nthe last day of his life. He had declined the first invitation given\nto him by Theodore Burton; but he could not altogether avoid his\nfuture brother-in-law, and had agreed to dine with him on this day.\n\nOn that same afternoon Harry, when he left Mr. Beilby's office, went\ndirect to Bolton Street, that he might call on Lady Ongar. As he went\nthither he bethought himself that these Wallikers and the like had\nhad no such events in life as had befallen him! They laughed at him\nabout Florence Burton, little guessing that it had been his lot to\nlove, and to be loved by such a one as Julia Brabazon had been,--such\na one as Lady Ongar now was. But things had gone well with him. Julia\nBrabazon could have made no man happy, but Florence Burton would be\nthe sweetest, dearest, truest little wife that ever man took to his\nhome. He was thinking of this, and determined to think of it more and\nmore daily, as he knocked at Lady Ongar's door. \"Yes; her ladyship\nwas at home,\" said the servant whom he had seen on the railway\nplatform; and in a few moments' time he found himself in the\ndrawing-room which he had criticized so carefully when he was taking\nit for its present occupant.\n\nHe was left in the room for five or six minutes, and was able to make\na full mental inventory of its contents. It was very different in its\npresent aspect from the room which he had seen not yet a month since.\nShe had told him that the apartments had been all that she desired;\nbut since then everything had been altered, at least in appearance.\nA new piano had been brought in, and the chintz on the furniture was\nsurely new. And the room was crowded with small feminine belongings,\nindicative of wealth and luxury. There were ornaments about, and\npretty toys, and a thousand knickknacks which none but the rich can\npossess, and which none can possess even among the rich unless they\ncan give taste as well as money to their acquisition. Then he heard a\nlight step; the door opened, and Lady Ongar was there.\n\nHe expected to see the same figure that he had seen on the railway\nplatform, the same gloomy drapery, the same quiet, almost deathlike\ndemeanour, nay, almost the same veil over her features; but the Lady\nOngar whom he now saw was as unlike that Lady Ongar as she was unlike\nthat Julia Brabazon whom he had known in old days at Clavering Park.\nShe was dressed, no doubt, in black; nay, no doubt, she was dressed\nin weeds; but in spite of the black and in spite of the weeds there\nwas nothing about her of the weariness or of the solemnity of woe.\nHe hardly saw that her dress was made of crape, or that long white\npendants were hanging down from the cap which sat so prettily upon\nher head. But it was her face at which he gazed. At first he thought\nthat she could hardly be the same woman, she was to his eyes so much\nolder than she had been! And yet as he looked at her, he found that\nshe was as handsome as ever,--more handsome than she had ever been\nbefore. There was a dignity about her face and figure which became\nher well, and which she carried as though she knew herself to be in\nvery truth a countess. It was a face which bore well such signs of\nage as those which had come upon it. She seemed to be a woman fitter\nfor womanhood than for girlhood. Her eyes were brighter than of yore,\nand, as Harry thought, larger; and her high forehead and noble stamp\nof countenance seemed fitted for the dress and headgear which she\nwore.\n\n\"I have been expecting you,\" said she, stepping up to him. \"Hermione\nwrote me word that you were to come up on Monday. Why did you not\ncome sooner?\" There was a smile on her face as she spoke, and a\nconfidence in her tone which almost confounded him.\n\n\"I have had so many things to do,\" said he lamely.\n\n\"About your new profession. Yes, I can understand that. And so you\nare settled in London now? Where are you living;--that is, if you are\nsettled yet?\" In answer to this, Harry told her that he had taken\nlodgings in Bloomsbury Square, blushing somewhat as he named so\nunfashionable a locality. Old Mrs. Burton had recommended him to the\nhouse in which he was located, but he did not find it necessary to\nexplain that fact to Lady Ongar.\n\n\"I have to thank you for what you did for me,\" continued she. \"You\nran away from me in such a hurry on that night that I was unable to\nspeak to you. But to tell the truth, Harry, I was in no mood then to\nspeak to any one. Of course you thought that I treated you ill.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said he.\n\n\"Of course you did. If I thought you did not, I should be angry with\nyou now. But had it been to save my life I could not have helped\nit. Why did not Sir Hugh Clavering come to meet me? Why did not my\nsister's husband come to me?\" To this question Harry could make no\nanswer. He was still standing with his hat in his hand, and now\nturned his face away from her and shook his head.\n\n\"Sit down, Harry,\" she said, \"and let me talk to you like a\nfriend;--unless you are in a hurry to go away.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said he, seating himself.\n\n\"Or unless you, too, are afraid of me.\"\n\n\"Afraid of you, Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"Yes, afraid; but I don't mean you. I don't believe that you are\ncoward enough to desert a woman who was once your friend because\nmisfortune has overtaken her, and calumny has been at work with her\nname.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said he.\n\n\"No, Harry; I do not think it of you. But if Sir Hugh be not a\ncoward, why did he not come and meet me? Why has he left me to stand\nalone, now that he could be of service to me? I knew that money was\nhis god, but I have never asked him for a shilling and should not\nhave done so now. Oh, Harry, how wicked you were about that cheque!\nDo you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes; I remember.\"\n\n\"So shall I; always, always. If I had taken that money how often\nshould I have heard of it since?\"\n\n\"Heard of it?\" he asked. \"Do you mean from me?\"\n\n\"Yes; how often from you? Would you have dunned me, and told me of it\nonce a week? Upon my word, Harry, I was told of it more nearly every\nday. Is it not wonderful that men should be so mean?\"\n\nIt was clear to him now that she was talking of her husband who was\ndead, and on that subject he felt himself at present unable to speak\na word. He little dreamed at that moment how openly she would soon\nspeak to him of Lord Ongar and of Lord Ongar's faults!\n\n\"Oh, how I have wished that I had taken your money! But never mind\nabout that now, Harry. Wretched as such taunts were, they soon became\na small thing. But it has been cowardly in your cousin, Hugh; has it\nnot? If I had not lived with him as one of his family, it would not\nhave mattered. People would not have expected it. It was as though my\nown brother had cast me forth.\"\n\n\"Lady Clavering has been with you; has she not?\"\n\n\"Once, for half-an-hour. She came up for one day, and came here by\nherself, cowering as though she were afraid of me. Poor Hermy! She\nhas not a good time of it either. You lords of creation lead your\nslaves sad lives when it pleases you to change your billing and\ncooing for matter-of-fact masterdom and rule. I don't blame Hermy.\nI suppose she did all she could, and I did not utter one word of\nreproach of her. Nor should I to him. Indeed, if he came now the\nservant would deny me to him. He has insulted me, and I shall\nremember the insult.\"\n\nHarry Clavering did not clearly understand what it was that Lady\nOngar had desired of her brother-in-law,--what aid she had required;\nnor did he know whether it would be fitting for him to offer to act\nin Sir Hugh's place. Anything that he could do, he felt himself at\nthat moment willing to do, even though the necessary service should\ndemand some sacrifice greater than prudence could approve. \"If I had\nthought that anything was wanted, I should have come to you sooner,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Everything is wanted, Harry. Everything is wanted;--except that\ncheque for six hundred pounds which you sent me so treacherously. Did\nyou ever think what might have happened if a certain person had heard\nof that? All the world would have declared that you had done it for\nyour own private purposes;--all the world, except one.\"\n\nHarry, as he heard this, felt that he was blushing. Did Lady Ongar\nknow of his engagement with Florence Burton? Lady Clavering knew it,\nand might probably have told the tidings; but then, again, she might\nnot have told them. Harry at this moment wished that he knew how it\nwas. All that Lady Ongar said to him would come with so different\na meaning according as she did, or did not know that fact. But he\nhad no mind to tell her of the fact himself. He declared to himself\nthat he hoped she knew it, as it would serve to make them both more\ncomfortable together; but he did not think that it would do for him\nto bring forward the subject, neck and heels as it were. The proper\nthing would be that she should congratulate him, but this she did not\ndo. \"I certainly meant no ill,\" he said, in answer to the last words\nshe had spoken.\n\n\"You have never meant ill to me, Harry; though you know you have\nabused me dreadfully before now. I daresay you forget the hard names\nyou have called me. You men do forget such things.\"\n\n\"I remember calling you one name.\"\n\n\"Do not repeat it now, if you please. If I deserved it, it would\nshame me; and if I did not, it should shame you.\"\n\n\"No; I will not repeat it.\"\n\n\"Does it not seem odd, Harry, that you and I should be sitting,\ntalking together in this way?\" She was leaning now towards him,\nacross the table, and one hand was raised to her forehead while her\neyes were fixed intently upon his. The attitude was one which he\nfelt to express extreme intimacy. She would not have sat in that\nway, pressing back her hair from her brow, with all appearance of\nwidowhood banished from her face, in the presence of any but a dear\nand close friend. He did not think of this, but he felt that it was\nso, almost by instinct. \"I have such a tale to tell you,\" she said;\n\"such a tale!\"\n\n\n[Illustration: A friendly talk.]\n\n\nWhy should she tell it to him? Of course he asked himself this\nquestion. Then he remembered that she had no brother,--remembered\nalso that her brother-in-law had deserted her, and he declared to\nhimself that, if necessary, he would be her brother. \"I fear that you\nhave not been happy,\" said he, \"since I saw you last.\"\n\n\"Happy!\" she replied. \"I have lived such a life as I did not think\nany man or woman could be made to live on this side the grave. I will\nbe honest with you, Harry. Nothing but the conviction that it could\nnot be for long has saved me from destroying myself. I knew that he\nmust die!\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Ongar!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; that is the name he gave me; and because I consented to\ntake it from him, he treated me;--O heavens! how am I to find words\nto tell you what he did, and the way in which he treated me. A woman\ncould not tell it to a man. Harry, I have no friend that I trust but\nyou, but to you I cannot tell it. When he found that he had been\nwrong in marrying me, that he did not want the thing which he had\nthought would suit him, that I was a drag upon him rather than a\ncomfort,--what was his mode, do you think, of ridding himself of the\nburden?\" Clavering sat silent looking at her. Both her hands were now\nup to her forehead, and her large eyes were gazing at him till he\nfound himself unable to withdraw his own for a moment from her face.\n\"He strove to get another man to take me off his hands; and when he\nfound that he was failing,--he charged me with the guilt which he\nhimself had contrived for me.\"\n\n\"Lady Ongar!\"\n\n\"Yes; you may well stare at me. You may well speak hoarsely and look\nlike that. It may be that even you will not believe me;--but by the\nGod in whom we both believe, I tell you nothing but the truth. He\nattempted that and he failed,--and then he accused me of the crime\nwhich he could not bring me to commit.\"\n\n\"And what then?\"\n\n\"Yes; what then? Harry, I had a thing to do, and a life to live,\nthat would have tried the bravest; but I went through it. I stuck to\nhim to the last! He told me before he was dying,--before that last\nfrightful illness, that I was staying with him for his money. 'For\nyour money, my lord,' I said, 'and for my own name.' And so it was.\nWould it have been wise in me, after all that I had gone through, to\nhave given up that for which I had sold myself? I had been very poor,\nand had been so placed that poverty, even such poverty as mine, was\na curse to me. You know what I gave up because I feared that curse.\nWas I to be foiled at last, because such a creature as that wanted\nto shirk out of his bargain? I knew there were some who would say I\nhad been false. Hugh Clavering says so now, I suppose. But they never\nshould say I had left him to die alone in a foreign land.\"\n\n\"Did he ask you to leave him?\"\n\n\"No;--but he called me that name which no woman should hear and stay.\nNo woman should do so unless she had a purpose such as mine. He\nwanted back the price that he had paid, and I was determined to do\nnothing that should assist him in his meanness! And then, Harry, his\nlast illness! Oh, Harry, you would pity me if you could know all!\"\n\n\"It was his own intemperance!\"\n\n\"Intemperance! It was brandy,--sheer brandy. He brought himself to\nsuch a state that nothing but brandy would keep him alive, and in\nwhich brandy was sure to kill him;--and it did kill him. Did you ever\nhear of the horrors of drink?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have heard of such a state.\"\n\n\"I hope you may never live to see it. It is a sight that would stick\nby you for ever. But I saw it, and tended him through the whole, as\nthough I had been his servant. I remained with him when that man who\nopened the door for you could no longer endure the room. I was with\nhim when the strong woman from the hospital, though she could not\nunderstand his words, almost fainted at what she saw and heard. He\nwas punished, Harry. I need wish no farther vengeance on him, even\nfor all his cruelty, his injustice, his unmanly treachery. Is it\nnot fearful to think that any man should have the power of bringing\nhimself to such an end as that?\"\n\nHarry was thinking rather how fearful it was that a man should have\nit in his power to drag any woman through such a Gehenna as that\nwhich this lord had created. He felt that had Julia Brabazon been\nhis, as she had once promised him, he never would have allowed\nhimself to speak a harsh word to her, to have looked at her except\nwith loving eyes. But she had chosen to join herself to a man who had\ntreated her with a cruelty exceeding all that his imagination could\nhave conceived. \"It is a mercy that he has gone,\" said he at last.\n\n\"It is a mercy for both. Perhaps you can understand now something of\nmy married life. And through it all I had but one friend;--if I may\ncall him a friend who had come to terms with my husband, and was to\nhave been his agent in destroying me. But when this man understood\nfrom me that I was not what he had been taught to think me,--which my\nhusband had told him I was,--he relented.\"\n\n\"May I ask what was that man's name?\"\n\n\"His name is Pateroff. He is a Pole, but he speaks English like an\nEnglishman. In my presence he told Lord Ongar that he was false and\nbrutal. Lord Ongar laughed, with that little, low, sneering laughter\nwhich was his nearest approach to merriment, and told Count Pateroff\nthat that was of course his game before me. There, Harry,--I will\ntell you nothing more of it. You will understand enough to know what\nI have suffered; and if you can believe that I have not sinned--\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Ongar!\"\n\n\"Well, I will not doubt you again. But as far as I can learn you are\nnearly alone in your belief. What Hermy thinks I cannot tell, but she\nwill soon come to think as Hugh may bid her. And I shall not blame\nher. What else can she do, poor creature?\"\n\n\"I am sure she believes no ill of you.\"\n\n\"I have one advantage, Harry,--one advantage over her and some\nothers. I am free. The chains have hurt me sorely during my slavery;\nbut I am free, and the price of my servitude remains. He had written\nhome,--would you believe that?--while I was living with him he had\nwritten home to say that evidence should be collected for getting rid\nof me. And yet he would sometimes be civil, hoping to cheat me into\ninadvertencies. He would ask that man to dine, and then of a sudden\nwould be absent; and during this he was ordering that evidence should\nbe collected! Evidence, indeed! The same servants have lived with me\nthrough it all. If I could now bring forward evidence I could make it\nall clear as the day. But there needs no care for a woman's honour,\nthough a man may have to guard his by collecting evidence!\"\n\n\"But what he did cannot injure you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry, it has injured me; it has all but destroyed me. Have not\nreports reached even you? Speak out like a man, and say whether it is\nnot so?\"\n\n\"I have heard something.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have heard something! If you heard something of your sister\nwhere would you be? All the world would be a chaos to you till you\nhad pulled out somebody's tongue by the roots. Not injured me! For\ntwo years your cousin Hugh's house was my home. I met Lord Ongar in\nhis house. I was married from his house. He is my brother-in-law, and\nit so happens that of all men he is the nearest to me. He stands well\nbefore the world, and at this time could have done me real service.\nHow is it that he did not welcome me home;--that I am not now at his\nhouse with my sister; that he did not meet me so that the world might\nknow that I was received back among my own people? Why is it, Harry,\nthat I am telling this to you;--to you, who are nothing to me; my\nsister's husband's cousin; a young man, from your position not fit to\nbe my confidant? Why am I telling this to you, Harry?\"\n\n\"Because we are old friends,\" said he, wondering again at this moment\nwhether she knew of his engagement with Florence Burton.\n\n\"Yes, we are old friends, and we have always liked each other; but\nyou must know that, as the world judges, I am wrong to tell all this\nto you. I should be wrong,--only that the world has cast me out,\nso that I am no longer bound to regard it. I am Lady Ongar, and I\nhave my share of that man's money. They have given me up Ongar Park,\nhaving satisfied themselves that it is mine by right, and must be\nmine by law. But he has robbed me of every friend I had in the world,\nand yet you tell me he has not injured me!\"\n\n\"Not every friend.\"\n\n\"No, Harry, I will not forget you, though I spoke so slightingly\nof you just now. But your vanity need not be hurt. It is only the\nworld,--Mrs. Grundy, you know, that would deny me such friendship\nas yours; not my own taste or choice. Mrs. Grundy always denies us\nexactly those things which we ourselves like best. You are clever\nenough to understand that.\"\n\nHe smiled and looked foolish, and declared that he only offered his\nassistance because perhaps it might be convenient at the present\nmoment. What could he do for her? How could he show his friendship\nfor her now at once?\n\n\"You have done it, Harry, in listening to me and giving me your\nsympathy. It is seldom that we want any great thing from our friends.\nI want nothing of that kind. No one can hurt me much further now. My\nmoney and my rank are safe; and, perhaps, by degrees, acquaintances,\nif not friends, will form themselves round me again. At present, of\ncourse, I see no one; but because I see no one, I wanted some one to\nwhom I could speak. Poor Hermy is worse than no one. Good-by, Harry;\nyou look surprised and bewildered now, but you will soon get over\nthat. Don't be long before I see you again.\"\n\nThen, feeling that he was bidden to go, he wished her good-by, and\nwent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE HOUSE IN ONSLOW CRESCENT.\n\n\nHarry, as he walked away from the house in Bolton Street, hardly knew\nwhether he was on his heels or his head. Burton had told him not to\ndress--\"We don't give dress dinner parties, you know. It's all in the\nfamily way with us,\"--and Harry, therefore, went direct from Bolton\nStreet to Onslow Crescent. But, though he managed to keep the proper\ncourse down Piccadilly, he was in such confusion of mind that he\nhardly knew whither he was going. It seemed as though a new form of\nlife had been opened to him, and that it had been opened in such a\nway as almost necessarily to engulf him. It was not only that Lady\nOngar's history was so terrible, and her life so strange, but that he\nhimself was called upon to form a part of that history, and to join\nhimself in some sort to that life. This countess with her wealth, her\nrank, her beauty, and her bright intellect had called him to her, and\ntold him that he was her only friend. Of course he had promised his\nfriendship. How could he have failed to give such a promise to one\nwhom he had loved so well? But to what must such a promise lead, or\nrather to what must it not have led had it not been for Florence\nBurton? She was young, free, and rich. She made no pretence of regret\nfor the husband she had lost, speaking of him as though in truth she\nhardly regarded herself as his wife. And she was the same Julia whom\nhe had loved, who had loved him, who had jilted him, and in regret\nfor whom he had once resolved to lead a wretched, lonely life! Of\ncourse she must expect that he would renew it all;--unless, indeed,\nshe knew of his engagement. But if she knew it, why had she not\nspoken of it?\n\nAnd could it be that she had no friends,--that everybody had deserted\nher, that she was all alone in the world? As he thought of it all,\nthe whole thing seemed to him to be too terrible for reality. What a\ntragedy was that she had told him! He thought of the man's insolence\nto the woman whom he had married and sworn to love, then of his\ncruelty, his fiendish, hellish cruelty,--and lastly of his terrible\npunishment. \"I stuck to him through it all,\" she had said to him;\nand then he endeavoured to picture to himself that bedside by which\nJulia Brabazon, his Julia Brabazon, had remained firm, when hospital\nattendants had been scared by the horrors they had witnessed, and the\nnerves of a strong man,--of a man paid for such work, had failed him!\n\nThe truth of her word throughout he never doubted; and, indeed, no\nman or woman who heard her could have doubted. One hears stories told\nthat to oneself, the hearer, are manifestly false; and one hears\nstories as to the truth or falsehood of which one is in doubt; and\nstories again which seem to be partly true and partly untrue. But one\nalso hears that of the truth of which no doubt seems to be possible.\nSo it had been with the tale which Lady Ongar had told. It had been\nall as she had said; and had Sir Hugh heard it,--even Sir Hugh,\nwho doubted all men and regarded all women as being false beyond\ndoubt,--even he, I think, would have believed it.\n\nBut she had deserved the sufferings which had come upon her. Even\nHarry, whose heart was very tender towards her, owned as much as\nthat. She had sold herself, as she had said of herself more than\nonce. She had given herself to a man whom she regarded not at all,\neven when her heart belonged to another,--to a man whom she must have\nloathed and despised when she was putting her hand into his before\nthe altar. What scorn had there been upon her face when she spoke\nof the beginning of their married miseries! With what eloquence of\nexpression had she pronounced him to be vile, worthless, unmanly; a\nthing from which a woman must turn with speechless contempt! She had\nnow his name, his rank, and his money, but she was friendless and\nalone. Harry Clavering declared to himself that she had deserved\nit,--and, having so declared, forgave her all her faults. She\nhad sinned, and then had suffered; and, therefore, should now be\nforgiven. If he could do aught to ease her troubles, he would do\nit,--as a brother would for a sister.\n\nBut it would be well that she should know of his engagement. Then he\nthought of the whole interview, and felt sure that she must know it.\nAt any rate he told himself that he was sure. She could hardly have\nspoken to him as she had done, unless she had known. When last they\nhad been together, sauntering round the gardens at Clavering, he had\nrebuked her for her treachery to him. Now she came to him almost\nopen-armed, free, full of her cares, swearing to him that he was her\nonly friend! All this could mean but one thing,--unless she knew that\nthat one thing was barred by his altered position.\n\nBut it gratified him to think that she had chosen him for the\nrepository of her tale; that she had told her terrible history to\nhim. I fear that some small part of this gratification was owing\nto her rank and wealth. To be the one friend of a widowed countess,\nyoung, rich, and beautiful, was something much out of the common way.\nSuch confidence lifted him far above the Wallikers of the world. That\nhe was pleased to be so trusted by one that was beautiful, was, I\nthink, no disgrace to him;--although I bear in mind his condition\nas a man engaged. It might be dangerous, but that danger in such\ncase it would be his duty to overcome. But in order that it might\nbe overcome, it would certainly be well that she should know his\nposition.\n\nI fear he speculated as he went along as to what might have been his\ncondition in the world had he never seen Florence Burton. First he\nasked himself, whether, under any circumstances, he would have wished\nto marry a widow, and especially a widow by whom he had already been\njilted. Yes; he thought that he could have forgiven her even that, if\nhis own heart had not changed; but he did not forget to tell himself\nagain how lucky it was for him that his heart was changed. What\ncountess in the world, let her have what park she might, and any\nimaginable number of thousands a year, could be so sweet, so nice,\nso good, so fitting for him as his own Florence Burton? Then he\nendeavoured to reflect what happened when a commoner married the\nwidow of a peer. She was still called, he believed, by her old title,\nunless she should choose to abandon it. Any such arrangement was now\nout of the question; but he thought that he would prefer that she\nshould have been called Mrs. Clavering, if such a state of things had\ncome about. I do not know that he pictured to himself any necessity,\neither on her part or on his, of abandoning anything else that came\nto her from her late husband.\n\nAt half-past six, the time named by Theodore Burton, he found himself\nat the door in Onslow Crescent, and was at once shown up into the\ndrawing-room. He knew that Mr. Burton had a family, and he had\npictured to himself an untidy, ugly house, with an untidy, motherly\nwoman going about with a baby in her arms. Such would naturally be\nthe home of a man who dusted his shoes with his pocket-handkerchief.\nBut to his surprise he found himself in as pretty a drawing-room\nas he remembered to have seen; and seated on a sofa, was almost as\npretty a woman as he remembered. She was tall and slight, with large\nbrown eyes and well-defined eyebrows, with an oval face, and the\nsweetest, kindest mouth that ever graced a woman. Her dark brown\nhair was quite plain, having been brushed simply smooth across the\nforehead, and then collected in a knot behind. Close beside her, on\na low chair, sat a little fair-haired girl, about seven years old,\nwho was going through some pretence at needlework; and kneeling\non a higher chair, while she sprawled over the drawing-room table,\nwas another girl, some three years younger, who was engaged with a\npuzzle-box.\n\n\"Mr. Clavering,\" said she, rising from her chair; \"I am so glad to\nsee you, though I am almost angry with you for not coming to us\nsooner. I have heard so much about you; of course you know that.\"\nHarry explained that he had only been a few days in town, and\ndeclared that he was happy to learn that he had been considered worth\ntalking about.\n\n\"If you were worth accepting you were worth talking about.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I was neither,\" said he.\n\n\"Well; I am not going to flatter you yet. Only as I think our Flo is\nwithout exception the most perfect girl I ever saw, I don't suppose\nshe would be guilty of making a bad choice. Cissy, dear, this is Mr.\nClavering.\"\n\nCissy got up from her chair, and came up to him. \"Mamma says I am to\nlove you very much,\" said Cissy, putting up her face to be kissed.\n\n\"But I did not tell you to say I had told you,\" said Mrs. Burton,\nlaughing.\n\n\"And I will love you very much,\" said Harry, taking her up in his\narms.\n\n\"But not so much as Aunt Florence,--will you?\"\n\nThey all knew it. It was clear to him that everybody connected with\nthe Burtons had been told of the engagement, and that they all spoke\nof it openly, as they did of any other everyday family occurrence.\nThere was not much reticence among the Burtons. He could not but feel\nthis, though now, at the present moment, he was disposed to think\nspecially well of the family because Mrs. Burton and her children\nwere so nice.\n\n\"And this is another daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes; another future niece, Mr. Clavering. But I suppose I may call\nyou Harry; may I not? My name is Cecilia. Yes, that is Miss Pert.\"\n\n\"I'm not Miss Pert,\" said the little soft round ball of a girl from\nthe chair. \"I'm Sophy Burton. Oh! you musn't tittle.\"\n\nHarry found himself quite at home in ten minutes; and before Mr.\nBurton had returned, had been taken upstairs into the nursery to see\nTheodore Burton Junior in his cradle, Theodore Burton Junior being\nas yet only some few months old. \"Now you've seen us all,\" said Mrs.\nBurton, \"and we'll go downstairs and wait for my husband. I must\nlet you into a secret, too. We don't dine till past seven; you may\nas well remember that for the future. But I wanted to have you for\nhalf-an-hour to myself before dinner, so that I might look at you,\nand make up my mind about Flo's choice. I hope you won't be angry\nwith me?\"\n\n\"And how have you made up your mind?\"\n\n\"If you want to find that out, you must get it through Florence. You\nmay be quite sure I shall tell her; and, I suppose, I may be quite\nsure she will tell you. Does she tell you everything?\"\n\n\"I tell her everything,\" said Harry, feeling himself, however, to\nbe a little conscience-smitten at the moment, as he remembered his\ninterview with Lady Ongar. Things had occurred this very day which he\ncertainly could not tell her.\n\n\"Do;--do; always do that,\" said Mrs. Burton, laying her hand\naffectionately on his arm. \"There is no way so certain to bind a\nwoman to you, heart and soul, as to show her that you trust her in\neverything. Theodore tells me everything. I don't think there's a\ndrain planned under a railway-bank, but that he shows it me in some\nway; and I feel so grateful for it. It makes me know that I can never\ndo enough for him. I hope you'll be as good to Flo as he is to me.\"\n\n\"We can't both be perfect, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, well! of course you'll laugh at me. Theodore always laughs at me\nwhen I get on what he calls a high horse. I wonder whether you are as\nsensible as he is?\"\n\nHarry reflected that he never wore cotton gloves. \"I don't think I am\nvery sensible,\" said he. \"I do a great many foolish things, and the\nworst is, that I like them.\"\n\n\"So do I. I like so many foolish things.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\" said Cissy.\n\n\"I shall have that quoted against me, now, for the next six months,\nwhenever I am preaching wisdom in the nursery. But Florence is nearly\nas sensible as her brother.\"\n\n\"Much more so than I am.\"\n\n\"All the Burtons are full up to their eyes with good sense. And what\na good thing it is! Who ever heard of any of them coming to sorrow?\nWhatever they have to live on, they always have enough. Did you ever\nknow a woman who has done better with her children, or has known how\nto do better, than Theodore's mother? She is the dearest old woman.\"\nHarry had heard her called a very clever old woman by certain persons\nin Stratton, and could not but think of her matrimonial successes as\nher praises were thus sung by her daughter-in-law.\n\nThey went on talking, while Sophy sat in Harry's lap, till there was\nheard the sound of the key in the latch of the front-door, and the\nmaster of the house was known to be there. \"It's Theodore,\" said his\nwife, jumping up and going out to meet him. \"I'm so glad that you\nhave been here a little before him, because now I feel that I know\nyou. When he's here I shan't get in a word.\" Then she went down to\nher husband, and Harry was left to speculate how so very charming\na woman could ever have been brought to love a man who cleaned his\nboots with his pocket-handkerchief.\n\nThere were soon steps again upon the stairs, and Burton returned\nbringing with him another man whom he introduced to Harry as Mr.\nJones. \"I didn't know my brother was coming,\" said Mrs. Burton, \"but\nit will be very pleasant, as of course I shall want you to know\nhim.\" Harry became a little perplexed. How far might these family\nramifications be supposed to go? Would he be welcomed, as one of\nthe household, to the hearth of Mrs. Jones; and if of Mrs. Jones,\nthen of Mrs. Jones's brother? His mental inquiries, however, in\nthis direction, were soon ended by his finding that Mr. Jones was a\nbachelor.\n\nJones, it appeared, was the editor, or sub-editor, or co-editor, of\nsome influential daily newspaper. \"He is a night bird, Harry--,\" said\nMrs. Burton. She had fallen into the way of calling him Harry at\nonce, but he could not on that occasion bring himself to call her\nCecilia. He might have done so had not her husband been present, but\nhe was ashamed to do it before him. \"He is a night bird, Harry,\" said\nshe, speaking of her brother, \"and flies away at nine o'clock, that\nhe may go and hoot like an owl in some dark city haunt that he has.\nThen, when he is himself asleep at breakfast-time, his hootings are\nbeing heard round the town.\"\n\nHarry rather liked the idea of knowing an editor. Editors were, he\nthought, influential people, who had the world very much under their\nfeet,--being, as he conceived, afraid of no men, while other men are\nvery much afraid of them. He was glad enough to shake Jones by the\nhand, when he found that Jones was an editor. But Jones, though he\nhad the face and forehead of a clever man, was very quiet, and seemed\nalmost submissive to his sister and brother-in-law.\n\nThe dinner was plain, but good, and Harry after a while became happy\nand satisfied, although he had come to the house with something\nalmost like a resolution to find fault. Men, and women also, do\nfrequently go about in such a mood, having unconscionably from some\nsmall circumstance, prejudged their acquaintances, and made up their\nmind that their acquaintances should be condemned. Influenced in this\nway, Harry had not intended to pass a pleasant evening, and would\nhave stood aloof and been cold, had it been possible to him; but\nhe found that it was not possible; and after a little while he was\nfriendly and joyous, and the dinner went off very well. There was\nsome wild-fowl, and he was agreeably surprised as he watched the\nmental anxiety and gastronomic skill with which Burton went through\nthe process of preparing the gravy, with lemon and pepper, having\nin the room a little silver-pot and an apparatus of fire for the\noccasion. He would as soon have expected the Archbishop of Canterbury\nhimself to go through such an operation in the dining-room at Lambeth\nas the hard-working man of business whom he had known in the chambers\nat the Adelphi.\n\n\"Does he always do that, Mrs. Burton?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Always,\" said Burton, \"when I can get the materials. One doesn't\nbother oneself about a cold leg of mutton, you know, which is my\nusual dinner when we are alone. The children have it hot in the\nmiddle of the day.\"\n\n\"Such a thing never happened to him yet, Harry,\" said Mrs. Burton.\n\n\"Gently with the pepper,\" said the editor. It was the first word he\nhad spoken for some time.\n\n\"Be good enough to remember that, yourself, when you are writing your\narticle to-night.\"\n\n\"No, none for me, Theodore,\" said Mrs. Burton.\n\n\"Cissy!\"\n\n\"I have dined really. If I had remembered that you were going to\ndisplay your cookery, I would have kept some of my energy, but I\nforgot it.\"\n\n\"As a rule,\" said Burton, \"I don't think women recognize any\ndifference in flavours. I believe wild duck and hashed mutton would\nbe quite the same to my wife if her eyes were blinded. I should\nnot mind this, if it were not that they are generally proud of the\ndeficiency. They think it grand.\"\n\n\"Just as men think it grand not to know one tune from another,\" said\nhis wife.\n\nWhen dinner was over, Burton got up from his seat. \"Harry,\" said he,\n\"do you like good wine?\" Harry said that he did. Whatever women may\nsay about wild-fowl, men never profess an indifference to good wine,\nalthough there is a theory about the world, quite as incorrect as it\nis general, that they have given up drinking it. \"Indeed, I do,\" said\nHarry. \"Then I'll give you a bottle of port,\" said Burton, and so\nsaying he left the room.\n\n\"I'm very glad you have come to-day,\" said Jones, with much gravity.\n\"He never gives me any of that when I'm alone with him; and he never,\nby any means, brings it out for company.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to accuse him of drinking it alone, Tom?\" said his\nsister, laughing.\n\n\"I don't know when he drinks it; I only know when he doesn't.\"\n\nThe wine was decanted with as much care as had been given to the\nconcoction of the gravy, and the clearness of the dark liquid was\nscrutinized with an eye that was full of anxious care. \"Now, Cissy,\nwhat do you think of that? She knows a glass of good wine when she\ngets it, as well as you do, Harry; in spite of her contempt for the\nduck.\"\n\nAs they sipped the old port they sat round the dining-room fire, and\nHarry Clavering was forced to own to himself that he had never been\nmore comfortable.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Burton, stretching out his slippered feet, \"why can't it\nall be after-dinner, instead of that weary room at the Adelphi?\"\n\n\"And all old port?\" said Jones.\n\n\"Yes, and all old port. You are not such an ass as to suppose that a\nman in suggesting to himself a continuance of pleasure suggests to\nhimself also the evils which are supposed to accompany such pleasure.\nIf I took much of the stuff I should get cross and sick, and make a\nbeast of myself; but then what a pity it is that it should be so.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like much of it, I think,\" said his wife.\n\n\"That is it,\" said he. \"We are driven to work because work never\npalls on us, whereas pleasure always does. What a wonderful scheme\nit is when one looks at it all. No man can follow pleasure long\ncontinually. When a man strives to do so, he turns his pleasure at\nonce into business, and works at that. Come, Harry, we mustn't have\nanother bottle, as Jones would go to sleep among the type.\" Then they\nall went upstairs together. Harry, before he went away, was taken\nagain up into the nursery, and there kissed the two little girls in\ntheir cots. When he was outside the nursery door, on the top of the\nstairs, Mrs. Burton took him by the hand. \"You'll come to us often,\"\nsaid she, \"and make yourself at home here, will you not?\" Harry\ncould not but say that he would. Indeed he did so without hesitation,\nalmost with eagerness, for he had liked her and had liked her\nhouse. \"We think of you, you know,\" she continued, \"quite as one of\nourselves. How could it be otherwise when Flo is the dearest to us of\nall beyond our own?\"\n\n\"It makes me so happy to hear you say so,\" said he.\n\n\"Then come here and talk about her. I want Theodore to feel that you\nare his brother; it will be so important to you in the business that\nit should be so.\" After that he went away, and as he walked back\nalong Piccadilly, and then up through the regions of St. Giles to\nhis home in Bloomsbury Square, he satisfied himself that the life\nof Onslow Crescent was a better manner of life than that which was\nlikely to prevail in Bolton Street.\n\nWhen he was gone his character was of course discussed between the\nhusband and wife in Onslow Crescent. \"What do you think of him?\" said\nthe husband.\n\n\"I like him so much! He is so much nicer than you told me,--so much\npleasanter and easier; and I have no doubt he is as clever, though I\ndon't think he shows that at once.\"\n\n\"He is clever enough; there's no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"And did you not think he was pleasant?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was pleasant here. He is one of those men who get on best\nwith women. You'll make much more of him for awhile than I shall.\nHe'll gossip with you and sit idling with you for the hour together,\nif you'll let him. There's nothing wrong about him, and he'd like\nnothing better than that.\"\n\n\"You don't believe that he's idle by disposition? Think of all that\nhe has done already.\"\n\n\"That's just what is most against him. He might do very well with us\nif he had not got that confounded fellowship; but having got that, he\nthinks the hard work of life is pretty well over with him.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he can be so foolish as that, Theodore.\"\n\n\"I know well what such men are, and I know the evil that is done\nto them by the cramming they endure. They learn many names of\nthings,--high-sounding names, and they come to understand a great\ndeal about words. It is a knowledge that requires no experience\nand very little real thought. But it demands much memory; and when\nthey have loaded themselves in this way, they think that they are\ninstructed in all things. After all, what can they do that is of real\nuse to mankind? What can they create?\"\n\n\"I suppose they are of use.\"\n\n\"I don't know it. A man will tell you, or pretend to tell you,--for\nthe chances are ten to one that he is wrong,--what sort of lingo was\nspoken in some particular island or province six hundred years before\nChrist. What good will that do any one, even if he were right? And\nthen see the effect upon the men themselves! At four-and-twenty a\nyoung fellow has achieved some wonderful success, and calls himself\nby some outlandish and conceited name--a double first, or something\nof the kind. Then he thinks he has completed everything, and is too\nvain to learn anything afterwards. The truth is, that at twenty-four\nno man has done more than acquire the rudiments of his education. The\nsystem is bad from beginning to end. All that competition makes false\nand imperfect growth. Come, I'll go to bed.\"\n\nWhat would Harry have said if he had heard all this from the man who\ndusted his boots with his handkerchief?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTOO PRUDENT BY HALF.\n\n\nFlorence Burton thought herself the happiest girl in the world.\nThere was nothing wanting to the perfection of her bliss. She could\nperceive, though she never allowed her mind to dwell upon the fact,\nthat her lover was superior in many respects to the men whom her\nsisters had married. He was better educated, better looking, in fact\nmore fully a gentleman at all points than either Scarness or any of\nthe others. She liked her sisters' husbands very well, and in former\ndays, before Harry Clavering had come to Stratton, she had never\ntaught herself to think that she, if she married, would want anything\ndifferent from that which Providence had given to them. She had never\nthrown up her head, or even thrown up her nose, and told herself that\nshe would demand something better than that. But not the less was she\nalive to the knowledge that something better had come in her way, and\nthat that something better was now her own. She was very proud of her\nlover, and, no doubt, in some gently feminine way showed that she was\nso as she made her way about among her friends at Stratton. Any idea\nthat she herself was better educated, better looking, or more clever\nthan her elder sisters, and that, therefore, she was deserving of a\nhigher order of husband, had never entered her mind. The Burtons in\nLondon,--Theodore Burton and his wife,--who knew her well, and who,\nof all the family, were best able to appreciate her worth, had long\nbeen of opinion that she deserved some specially favoured lot in\nlife. The question with them would be, whether Harry Clavering was\ngood enough for her.\n\nEverybody at Stratton knew that she was engaged, and when they wished\nher joy she made no coy denials. Her sisters had all been engaged in\nthe same way, and their marriages had gone off in regular sequence to\ntheir engagements. There had never been any secret with them about\ntheir affairs. On this matter the practice is very various among\ndifferent people. There are families who think it almost indelicate\nto talk about marriage as a thing actually in prospect for any of\ntheir own community. An ordinary acquaintance would be considered to\nbe impertinent in even hinting at such a thing, although the thing\nwere an established fact. The engaged young ladies only whisper\nthe news through the very depths of their pink note-paper, and are\nsupposed to blush as they communicate the tidings by their pens, even\nin the retirement of their own rooms. But there are other families in\nwhich there is no vestige of such mystery, in which an engaged couple\nare spoken of together as openly as though they were already bound in\nsome sort of public partnership. In these families the young ladies\ntalk openly of their lovers, and generally prefer that subject of\nconversation to any other. Such a family,--so little mysterious,--so\nopen in their arrangements, was that of the Burtons at Stratton.\nThe reserve in the reserved families is usually atoned for by the\nmagnificence of the bridal arrangements, when the marriage is at last\nsolemnized; whereas, among the other set,--the people who have no\nreserve,--the marriage, when it comes, is customarily an affair\nof much less outward ceremony. They are married without blast of\ntrumpet, with very little profit to the confectioner, and do their\nhoneymoon, if they do it at all, with prosaic simplicity.\n\nFlorence had made up her mind that she would be in no hurry about\nit. Harry was in a hurry; but that was a matter of course. He was a\nquick-blooded, impatient, restless being. She was slower, and more\ngiven to consideration. It would be better that they should wait,\neven if it were for five or six years. She had no fear of poverty\nfor herself. She had lived always in a house in which money was\nmuch regarded, and among people who were of inexpensive habits.\nBut such had not been his lot, and it was her duty to think of the\nmode of life which might suit him. He would not be happy as a poor\nman,--without comforts around him, which would simply be comforts to\nhim though they would be luxuries to her. When her mother told her,\nshaking her head rather sorrowfully as she heard Florence talk, that\nshe did not like long engagements, Florence would shake hers too, in\nplayful derision, and tell her mother not to be so suspicious. \"It is\nnot you that are going to marry him, mamma.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; I know that. But long engagements never are good. And\nI can't think why young people should want so many things, now, that\nthey used to do without very well when I was married. When I went\ninto housekeeping, we only had one girl of fifteen to do everything;\nand we hadn't a nursemaid regular till Theodore was born; and there\nwere three before him.\"\n\nFlorence could not say how many maid-servants Harry might wish to\nhave under similar circumstances, but she was very confident that he\nwould want much more attendance than her father and mother had done,\nor even than some of her brothers and sisters. Her father, when he\nfirst married, would not have objected, on returning home, to find\nhis wife in the kitchen, looking after the progress of the dinner;\nnor even would her brother Theodore have been made unhappy by such a\ncircumstance. But Harry, she knew, would not like it; and therefore\nHarry must wait. \"It will do him good, mamma,\" said Florence. \"You\ncan't think that I mean to find fault with him; but I know that he is\nyoung in his ways. He is one of those men who should not marry till\nthey are twenty-eight, or thereabouts.\"\n\n\"You mean that he is unsteady?\"\n\n\"No,--not unsteady. I don't think him a bit unsteady; but he will be\nhappier single for a year or two. He hasn't settled down to like his\ntea and toast when he is tired of his work, as a married man should\ndo. Do you know that I am not sure that a little flirtation would not\nbe very good for him?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\"\n\n\"It should be very moderate, you know.\"\n\n\"But then, suppose it wasn't moderate. I don't like to see engaged\nyoung men going on in that way. I suppose I'm very old-fashioned; but\nI think when a young man is engaged, he ought to remember it and to\nshow it. It ought to make him a little serious, and he shouldn't be\ngoing about like a butterfly, that may do just as it pleases in the\nsunshine.\"\n\nDuring the three months which Harry remained in town before the\nEaster holidays he wrote more than once to Florence, pressing her to\nname an early day for their marriage. These letters were written, I\nthink, after certain evenings spent under favourable circumstances in\nOnslow Crescent, when he was full of the merits of domestic comfort,\nand perhaps also owed some of their inspiration to the fact that Lady\nOngar had left London without seeing him. He had called repeatedly in\nBolton Street, having been specially pressed to do so by Lady Ongar,\nbut he had only once found her at home, and then a third person\nhad been present. This third person had been a lady who was not\nintroduced to him, but he had learned from her speech that she was\na foreigner. On that occasion Lady Ongar had made herself gracious\nand pleasant, but nothing had passed which interested him, and, most\nunreasonably, he had felt himself to be provoked. When next he went\nto Bolton Street he found that Lady Ongar had left London. She had\ngone down to Ongar Park, and, as far as the woman at the house knew,\nintended to remain there till after Easter. Harry had some undefined\nidea that she should not have taken such a step without telling\nhim. Had she not declared to him that he was her only friend?\nWhen a friend is going out of town, leaving an only friend behind,\nthat friend ought to tell her only friend what she is going to do,\notherwise such a declaration of only-friendship means nothing. Such\nwas Harry Clavering's reasoning, and having so reasoned, he declared\nto himself that it did mean nothing, and was very pressing to\nFlorence Burton to name an early day. He had been with Cecilia,\nhe told her,--he had learned to call Mrs. Burton Cecilia in his\nletters,--and she quite agreed with him that their income would be\nenough. He was to have two hundred a year from his father, having\nbrought himself to abandon that high-toned resolve which he had made\nsome time since that he would never draw any part of his income from\nthe parental coffers. His father had again offered it, and he had\naccepted it. Old Mr. Burton was to add a hundred, and Harry was of\nopinion that they could do very well. Cecilia thought the same, he\nsaid, and therefore Florence surely would not refuse. But Florence\nreceived, direct from Onslow Crescent, Cecilia's own version of her\nthoughts, and did refuse. It may be surmised that she would have\nrefused even without assistance from Cecilia, for she was a young\nlady not of a fickle or changing disposition. So she wrote to Harry\nwith much care, and as her letter had some influence on the story to\nbe told, the reader shall read it,--if the reader so pleases.\n\n\n   Stratton. March, 186--.\n\n   DEAR HARRY,--\n\n   I received your letter this morning, and answer it at\n   once, because I know you will be impatient for an answer.\n   You are impatient about things,--are you not? But it was\n   a kind, sweet, dear, generous letter, and I need not tell\n   you now that I love the writer of it with all my heart. I\n   am so glad you like Cecilia. I think she is the perfection\n   of a woman. And Theodore is every bit as good as Cecilia,\n   though I know you don't think so, because you don't say\n   so. I am always happy when I am in Onslow Crescent. I\n   should have been there this spring, only that a certain\n   person who chooses to think that his claims on me are\n   stronger than those of any other person wishes me to go\n   elsewhere. Mamma wishes me to go to London also for a\n   week, but I don't want to be away from the old house too\n   much before the final parting comes at last.\n\n   And now about the final parting; for I may as well rush at\n   it at once. I need hardly tell you that no care for father\n   or mother shall make me put off my marriage. Of course I\n   owe everything to you now; and as they have approved it,\n   I have no right to think of them in opposition to you.\n   And you must not suppose that they ask me to stay. On the\n   contrary, mamma is always telling me that early marriages\n   are best. She has sent all the birds out of the nest but\n   one; and is impatient to see that one fly away, that\n   she may be sure that there is no lame one in the brood.\n   You must not therefore think that it is mamma; nor is it\n   papa, as regards himself,--though papa agrees with me in\n   thinking that we ought to wait a little.\n\n   Dear Harry, you must not be angry, but I am sure that we\n   ought to wait. We are, both of us, young, and why should\n   we be in a hurry? I know what you will say, and of course\n   I love you the more because you love me so well; but I\n   fancy that I can be quite happy if I can see you two or\n   three times in the year, and hear from you constantly.\n   It is so good of you to write such nice letters, and the\n   longer they are the better I like them. Whatever you put\n   in them, I like them to be full. I know I can't write nice\n   letters myself, and it makes me unhappy. Unless I have got\n   something special to say, I am dumb.\n\n   But now I have something special to say. In spite of all\n   that you tell me about Cecilia, I do not think it would do\n   for us to venture upon marrying yet. I know that you are\n   willing to sacrifice everything, but I ought not on that\n   account to accept a sacrifice. I could not bear to see\n   you poor and uncomfortable; and we should be very poor in\n   London now-a-days with such an income as we should have.\n   If we were going to live here at Stratton perhaps we might\n   manage, but I feel sure that it would be imprudent in\n   London. You ought not to be angry with me for saying\n   this, for I am quite as anxious to be with you as you\n   can possibly be to be with me; only I can bear to look\n   forward, and have a pleasure in feeling that all my\n   happiness is to come. I know I am right in this. Do write\n   me one little line to say that you are not angry with your\n   little girl.\n\n   I shall be quite ready for you by the 29th. I got such a\n   dear little note from Fanny the other day. She says that\n   you never write to them, and she supposes that I have the\n   advantage of all your energy in that way. I have told her\n   that I do get a good deal. My brother writes to me very\n   seldom, I know; and I get twenty letters from Cecilia for\n   one scrap that Theodore ever sends me. Perhaps some of\n   these days I shall be the chief correspondent with the\n   rectory. Fanny told me all about the dresses, and I have\n   my own quite ready. I've been bridesmaid to four of my own\n   sisters, so I ought to know what I'm about. I'll never\n   be bridesmaid to anybody again, after Fanny; but whom on\n   earth shall I have for myself? I think we must wait till\n   Cissy and Sophy are ready. Cissy wrote me word that you\n   were a darling man. I don't know how much of that came\n   directly from Cissy, or how much from Cecilia.\n\n   God bless you, dear, dearest Harry. Let me have one letter\n   before you come to fetch me, and acknowledge that I am\n   right, even if you say that I am disagreeable. Of course\n   I like to think that you want to have me; but, you see,\n   one has to pay the penalty of being civilized.--Ever and\n   always your own affectionate\n\n   FLORENCE BURTON.\n\n\nHarry Clavering was very angry when he got this letter. The primary\ncause of his anger was the fact that Florence should pretend to know\nwhat was better for him than he knew himself. If he was willing to\nencounter life in London on less than four hundred a year, surely\nshe might be contented to try the same experiment. He did not for a\nmoment suspect that she feared for herself, but he was indignant with\nher because of her fear for him. What right had she to accuse him\nof wanting to be comfortable? Had he not for her sake consented to\nbe very uncomfortable at that old house at Stratton? Was he not\nwilling to give up his fellowship, and the society of Lady Ongar,\nand everything else, for her sake? Had he not shown himself to be\nsuch a lover as there is not one in a hundred? And yet she wrote and\ntold him that it wouldn't do for him to be poor and uncomfortable!\nAfter all that he had done in the world, after all that he had gone\nthrough, it would be odd if, at this time of day, he did not know\nwhat was good for himself! It was in that way that he regarded\nFlorence's pertinacity.\n\nHe was rather unhappy at this period. It seemed to him that he was\nsomewhat slighted on both sides,--or, if I may say so, less thought\nof on both sides than he deserved. Had Lady Ongar remained in town,\nas she ought to have done, he would have solaced himself, and at the\nsame time have revenged himself upon Florence, by devoting some of\nhis spare hours to that lady. It was Lady Ongar's sudden departure\nthat had made him feel that he ought to rush at once into marriage.\nNow he had no consolation, except that of complaining to Mrs. Burton,\nand going frequently to the theatre. To Mrs. Burton he did complain a\ngreat deal, pulling her worsteds and threads about the while, sitting\nin idleness while she was working, just as Theodore Burton had\npredicted that he would do.\n\n\"I won't have you so idle, Harry,\" Mrs. Burton said to him one day.\n\"You know you ought to be at your office now.\" It must be admitted\non behalf of Harry Clavering, that they who liked him, especially\nwomen, were able to become intimate with him very easily. He had\ncomfortable, homely ways about him, and did not habitually give\nhimself airs. He had become quite domesticated at the Burtons' house\nduring the ten weeks that he had been in London, and knew his way\nto Onslow Crescent almost too well. It may, perhaps, be surmised\ncorrectly that he would not have gone there so frequently if Mrs.\nTheodore Burton had been an ugly woman.\n\n\"It's all her fault,\" said he, continuing to snip a piece of worsted\nwith a pair of scissors as he spoke. \"She's too prudent by half.\"\n\n\"Poor Florence!\"\n\n\"You can't but know that I should work three times as much if she had\ngiven me a different answer. It stands to reason any man would work\nunder such circumstances as that. Not that I am idle, I believe. I do\nas much as any other man about the place.\"\n\n\"I won't have my worsted destroyed all the same. Theodore says that\nFlorence is right.\"\n\n\"Of course he does; of course he'll say I'm wrong. I won't ask her\nagain,--that's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry! don't say that. You know you'll ask her. You would\nto-morrow, if she were here.\"\n\n\"You don't know me, Cecilia, or you would not say so. When I have\nmade up my mind to a thing, I am generally firm about it. She said\nsomething about two years, and I will not say a word to alter that\ndecision. If it be altered, it shall be altered by her.\"\n\nIn the meantime he punished Florence by sending her no special answer\nto her letter. He wrote to her as usual; but he made no reference to\nhis last proposal, nor to her refusal. She had asked him to tell her\nthat he was not angry, but he would tell her nothing of the kind. He\ntold her when and where and how he would meet her, and convey her\nfrom Stratton to Clavering; gave her some account of a play he had\nseen; described a little dinner-party in Onslow Crescent; and told\nher a funny story about Mr. Walliker and the office at the Adelphi.\nBut he said no word, even in rebuke, as to her decision about their\nmarriage. He intended that this should be felt to be severe, and took\npleasure in the pain that he would be giving. Florence, when she\nreceived her letter, knew that he was sore, and understood thoroughly\nthe working of his mind. \"I will comfort him when we are together,\"\nshe said to herself. \"I will make him reasonable when I see him.\"\nIt was not the way in which he expected that his anger would be\nreceived.\n\nOne day on his return home he found a card on his table which\nsurprised him very much. It contained a name but no address, but over\nthe name there was a pencil memorandum, stating that the owner of the\ncard would call again on his return to London after Easter. The name\non the card was that of Count Pateroff. He remembered the name well\nas soon as he saw it, though he had never thought of it since the\nsolitary occasion on which it had been mentioned to him. Count\nPateroff was the man who had been Lord Ongar's friend, and respecting\nwhom Lord Ongar had brought a false charge against his wife. Why\nshould Count Pateroff call on him? Why was he in England? Whence had\nhe learned the address in Bloomsbury Square? To that last question he\nhad no difficulty in finding an answer. Of course he must have heard\nit from Lady Ongar. Count Pateroff had now left London! Had he gone\nto Ongar Park? Harry Clavering's mind was instantly filled with\nsuspicion, and he became jealous in spite of Florence Burton. Could\nit be that Lady Ongar, not yet four months a widow, was receiving at\nher house in the country this man with whose name her own had been so\nfatally joined? If so, what could he think of such behaviour? He was\nvery angry. He knew that he was angry, but he did not at all know\nthat he was jealous. Was he not, by her own declaration to him, her\nonly friend; and as such could he entertain such a suspicion without\nanger? \"Her friend!\" he said to himself. \"Not if she has any dealings\nwhatever with that man after what she has told me of him!\" He\nremembered at last that perhaps the count might not be at Ongar Park;\nbut he must, at any rate, have had some dealing with Lady Ongar or\nhe would not have known the address in Bloomsbury Square. \"Count\nPateroff!\" he said, repeating the name, \"I shouldn't wonder if I\nhave to quarrel with that man.\" During the whole of that night he\nwas thinking of Lady Ongar. As regarded himself, he knew that he\nhad nothing to offer to Lady Ongar but a brotherly friendship; but,\nnevertheless, it was an injury to him that she should be acquainted\nintimately with any unmarried man but himself.\n\nOn the next day he was to go to Stratton, and in the morning a letter\nwas brought to him by the postman; a letter, or rather a very short\nnote. Guildford was the postmark, and he knew at once that it was\nfrom Lady Ongar.\n\n\n   DEAR MR. CLAVERING [the note said],--\n\n   I was so sorry to leave London without seeing you; I shall\n   be back by the end of April, and am keeping on the same\n   rooms. Come to me, if you can, on the evening of the 30th,\n   after dinner. He at last bade Hermy to write and ask me\n   to go to Clavering for the Easter week. Such a note! I'll\n   show it you when we meet. Of course I declined.\n\n   But I write on purpose to tell you that I have begged\n   Count Pateroff to see you. I have not seen him, but I\n   have had to write to him about things that happened in\n   Florence. He has come to England chiefly with reference to\n   the affairs of Lord Ongar. I want you to hear his story.\n   As far as I have known him he is a truth-telling man,\n   though I do not know that I am able to say much more in\n   his favour.\n\n   Ever yours, J. O.\n\n\nWhen he had read this he was quite an altered man. See Count\nPateroff! Of course he would see him. What task could be more\nfitting for a friend than this, of seeing such a man under such\ncircumstances. Before he left London he wrote a note for Count\nPateroff, to be given to the count by the people at the lodgings\nshould he call during Harry's absence from London. In this he\nexplained that he would be at Clavering for a fortnight, but\nexpressed himself ready to come up to London at a day's notice should\nCount Pateroff be necessitated again to leave London before the day\nnamed.\n\nAs he went about his business that day, and as he journeyed down to\nStratton, he entertained much kinder ideas about Lady Ongar than he\nhad previously done since seeing Count Pateroff's card.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nFLORENCE BURTON AT THE RECTORY.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nHarry Clavering went down to Stratton, slept one night at old Mr.\nBurton's house, and drove Florence over to Clavering,--twenty miles\nacross the country,--on the following day. This journey together\nhad been looked forward to with great delight by both of them, and\nFlorence, in spite of the snubbing which she had received from her\nlover because of her prudence, was very happy as she seated herself\nalongside of him in the vehicle which had been sent over from the\nrectory, and which he called a trap. Not a word had as yet been said\nbetween them as to that snubbing, nor was Harry minded that anything\nshould be said. He meant to carry on his revenge by being dumb on\nthat subject. But such was not Florence's intention. She desired not\nonly to have her own way in this matter, but desired also that he\nshould assent to her arrangements.\n\nIt was a charming day for such a journey. It was cold, but not cold\nenough to make them uncomfortable. There was a wind, but not wind\nenough to torment them. Once there came on a little shower, which\njust sufficed to give Harry an opportunity of wrapping his companion\nvery closely, but he had hardly completed the ceremony before the\nnecessity for it was over. They both agreed that this mode of\ntravelling was infinitely preferable to a journey by railroad, and I\nmyself should be of the same opinion if one could always make one's\njourneys under the same circumstances. And it must be understood that\nHarry, though no doubt he was still taking his revenge on Florence by\nabstaining from all allusion to her letter, was not disposed to make\nhimself otherwise disagreeable. He played his part of lover very\nwell, and Florence was supremely happy.\n\n\"Harry,\" she said, when the journey was more than half completed,\n\"you never told me what you thought of my letter.\"\n\n\"Which letter?\" But he knew very well which was the letter in\nquestion.\n\n\"My prudent letter,--written in answer to yours that was very\nimprudent.\"\n\n\"I thought there was nothing more to be said about it.\"\n\n\"Come, Harry, don't let there be any subject between us that we\ndon't care to think about and discuss. I know what you meant by not\nanswering me. You meant to punish me,--did you not, for having an\nopinion different from yours? Is not that true, Harry?\"\n\n\"Punish you,--no; I did not want to punish you. It was I that was\npunished, I think.\"\n\n\"But you know I was right. Was I not right?\"\n\n\"I think you were wrong, but I don't want to say anything more about\nit now.\"\n\n\"Ah, but, Harry, I want you to talk about it. Is it not everything\nto me,--everything in this world,--that you and I should agree about\nthis? I have nothing else to think of but you. I have nothing to hope\nfor but that I may live to be your wife. My only care in the world is\nmy care for you! Come, Harry, don't be glum with me.\"\n\n\"I am not glum.\"\n\n\"Speak a nice word to me. Tell me that you believe me when I say that\nit is not of myself I am thinking, but of you.\"\n\n\"Why can't you let me think for myself in this?\"\n\n\"Because you have got to think for me.\"\n\n\"And I think you'd do very well on the income we've got. If you'll\nconsent to marry, this summer, I won't be glum, as you call it, a\nmoment longer.\"\n\n\"No, Harry; I must not do that. I should be false to my duty to you\nif I did.\"\n\n\"Then it's no use saying anything more about it.\"\n\n\"Look here, Harry, if an engagement for two years is tedious to\nyou--\"\n\n\"Of course it is tedious. Is not waiting for anything always tedious?\nThere's nothing I hate so much as waiting.\"\n\n\"But listen to me,\" said she, gravely. \"If it is too tedious, if it\nis more than you think you can bear without being unhappy, I will\nrelease you from your engagement.\"\n\n\"Florence!\"\n\n\"Hear me to the end. It will make no change in me; and then if you\nlike to come to me again at the end of the two years, you may be sure\nof the way in which I shall receive you.\"\n\n\"And what good would that do?\"\n\n\"Simply this good, that you would not be bound in a manner that makes\nyou unhappy. If you did not intend that when you asked me to be your\nwife-- Oh, Harry, all I want is to make you happy. That is all that I\ncare for, all that I think about!\"\n\nHarry swore to her with ten thousand oaths that he would not release\nher from any part of her engagement with him, that he would give\nher no loophole of escape from him, that he intended to hold her so\nfirmly that if she divided herself from him, she should be accounted\namong women a paragon of falseness. He was ready, he said, to marry\nher to-morrow. That was his wish, his idea of what would be best for\nboth of them;--and after that, if not to-morrow, then on the next\nday, and so on till the day should come on which she should consent\nto become his wife. He went on also to say that he should continue to\ntorment her on the subject about once a week till he had induced her\nto give way; and then he quoted a Latin line to show that a constant\ndropping of water will hollow a stone. This was somewhat at variance\nwith a declaration he had made to Mrs. Burton, in Onslow Crescent,\nto the effect that he would never speak to Florence again upon the\nsubject; but then men do occasionally change their minds, and Harry\nClavering was a man who often changed his.\n\nFlorence, as he made the declaration above described, thought that\nhe played his part of lover very well, and drew herself a little\ncloser to him as she thanked him for his warmth. \"Dear Harry, you are\nso good and so kind, and I do love you so truly!\" In this way the\njourney was made very pleasantly, and when Florence was driven up to\nthe rectory door she was quite contented with her coachman.\n\nHarry Clavering, who is the hero of our story, will not, I fear, have\nhitherto presented himself to the reader as having much of the heroic\nnature in his character. It will, perhaps, be complained of him that\nhe is fickle, vain, easily led, and almost as easily led to evil as\nto good. But it should be remembered that hitherto he has been rather\nhardly dealt with in these pages, and that his faults and weaknesses\nhave been exposed almost unfairly. That he had such faults and was\nsubject to such weaknesses may be believed of him; but there may be\na question whether as much evil would not be known of most men, let\nthem be heroes or not be heroes, if their characters were, so to\nsay, turned inside out before our eyes. Harry Clavering, fellow of\nhis college, six feet high, with handsome face and person, and with\nplenty to say for himself on all subjects, was esteemed highly and\nregarded much by those who knew him, in spite of those little foibles\nwhich marred his character; and I must beg the reader to take the\nworld's opinion about him, and not to estimate him too meanly thus\nearly in this history of his adventures.\n\nIf this tale should ever be read by any lady who, in the course of\nher career, has entered a house under circumstances similar to those\nwhich had brought Florence Burton to Clavering rectory, she will\nunderstand how anxious must have been that young lady when she\nencountered the whole Clavering family in the hall. She had been\nblown about by the wind, and her cloaks and shawls were heavy on her,\nand her hat was a little out of shape,--from some fault on the part\nof Harry, as I believe,--and she felt herself to be a dowdy as she\nappeared among them. What would they think of her, and what would\nthey think of Harry in that he had chosen such an one to be his wife?\nMrs. Clavering had kissed her before she had seen that lady's face;\nand Mary and Fanny had kissed her before she knew which was which;\nand then a stout, clerical gentleman kissed her who, no doubt, was\nMr. Clavering, senior. After that, another clerical gentleman, very\nmuch younger and very much slighter, shook hands with her. He might\nhave kissed her, too, had he been so minded, for Florence was too\nconfused to be capable of making any exact reckoning in the matter.\nHe might have done so--that is, as far as Florence was concerned. It\nmay be a question whether Mary Clavering would not have objected;\nfor this clerical gentleman was the Rev. Edward Fielding, who was to\nbecome her husband in three days' time.\n\n\"Now, Florence,\" said Fanny, \"come upstairs into mamma's room and\nhave some tea, and we'll look at you. Harry, you needn't come. You've\nhad her to yourself for a long time, and can have her again in the\nevening.\"\n\nFlorence, in this way, was taken upstairs and found herself seated by\na fire, while three pairs of hands were taking from her her shawls\nand hat and cloak, almost before she knew where she was.\n\n\"It is so odd to have you here,\" said Fanny. \"We have only one\nbrother, so, of course, we shall make very much of you. Isn't she\nnice, mamma?\"\n\n\"I'm sure she is; very nice. But I shouldn't have told her so before\nher face, if you hadn't asked the question.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, mamma. You mustn't believe mamma when she pretends\nto be grand and sententious. It's only put on as a sort of company\nair, but we don't mean to make company of you.\"\n\n\"Pray don't,\" said Florence.\n\n\"I'm so glad you are come just at this time,\" said Mary. \"I think so\nmuch of having Harry's future wife at my wedding. I wish we were both\ngoing to be married the same day.\"\n\n\"But we are not going to be married for ever so long. Two years hence\nhas been the shortest time named.\"\n\n\"Don't be sure of that, Florence,\" said Fanny. \"We have all of us\nreceived a special commission from Harry to talk you out of that\nheresy; have we not, mamma?\"\n\n\"I think you had better not tease Florence about that immediately on\nher arrival. It's hardly fair.\" Then, when they had drunk their tea,\nFlorence was taken away to her own room, and before she was allowed\nto go downstairs she was intimate with both the girls, and had so\nfar overcome her awe of Harry's mother as to be able to answer her\nwithout confusion.\n\n\"Well, sir, what do you think of her?\" said Harry to his father, as\nsoon as they were alone.\n\n\"I have not had time to think much of her yet. She seems to be very\npretty. She isn't so tall as I thought she would be.\"\n\n\"No; she's not tall,\" said Harry, in a voice of disappointment.\n\n\"I've no doubt we shall like her very much. What money is she to\nhave?\"\n\n\"A hundred a year while her father lives.\"\n\n\"That's not much.\"\n\n\"Much or little, it made no difference with me. I should never have\nthought of marrying a girl for her money. It's a kind of thing that\nI hate. I almost wish she was to have nothing.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't refuse it if I were you.\"\n\n\"Of course, I shan't refuse it; but what I mean is that I never\nthought about it when I asked her to have me; and I shouldn't have\nbeen a bit more likely to ask her if she had ten times as much.\"\n\n\"A fortune with one's wife isn't a bad thing for a poor man, Harry.\"\n\n\"But a poor man must be poor in more senses than one when he looks\nabout to get a fortune in that way.\"\n\n\"I suppose you won't marry just yet,\" said the father. \"Including\neverything, you would not have five hundred a year, and that would be\nvery close work in London.\"\n\n\"It's not quite decided yet, sir. As far as I am myself concerned, I\nthink that people are a great deal too prudent about money. I believe\nI could live as a married man on a hundred a year, if I had no more;\nand as for London, I don't see why London should be more expensive\nthan any other place. You can get exactly what you want in London,\nand make your halfpence go farther there than anywhere else.\"\n\n\"And your sovereigns go quicker,\" said the rector.\n\n\"All that is wanted,\" said Harry, \"is the will to live on your\nincome, and a little firmness in carrying out your plans.\"\n\nThe rector of Clavering, as he heard all this wisdom fall from his\nson's lips, looked at Harry's expensive clothes, at the ring on his\nfinger, at the gold chain on his waistcoat, at the studs in his\nshirt, and smiled gently. He was by no means so clever a man as his\nson, but he knew something more of the world, and though not much\ngiven to general reading, he had read his son's character. \"A great\ndeal of firmness and of fortitude also is wanted for that kind\nof life,\" he said. \"There are men who can go through it without\nsuffering, but I would not advise any young man to commence it in a\nhurry. If I were you I should wait a year or two. Come, let's have a\nwalk; that is, if you can tear yourself away from your lady-love for\nan hour. If there is not Saul coming up the avenue! Take your hat,\nHarry, and we'll get out the other way. He only wants to see the\ngirls about the school, but if he catches us he'll keep us for an\nhour.\" Then Harry asked after Mr. Saul's love-affairs. \"I've not\nheard one single word about it since you went away,\" said the rector.\n\"It seems to have passed off like a dream. He and Fanny go on the\nsame as ever, and I suppose he knows that he made a fool of himself.\"\nBut in this matter the rector of Clavering was mistaken. Mr. Saul did\nnot by any means think that he had made a fool of himself.\n\n\"He has never spoken a word to me since,\" said Fanny to her brother\nthat evening; \"that is, not a word as to what occurred then. Of\ncourse it was very embarrassing at first, though I don't think he\nminded it much. He came after a day or two just the same as ever, and\nhe almost made me think that he had forgotten it.\"\n\n\"And he wasn't confused?\"\n\n\"Not at all. He never is. The only difference is that I think he\nscolds me more than he used to do.\"\n\n\"Scold you!\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes; he always scolded me if he thought there was anything\nwrong, especially about giving the children holidays. But he does it\nnow more than ever.\"\n\n\"And how do you bear it?\"\n\n\"In a half-and-half sort of way. I laugh at him, and then do as I'm\nbid. He makes everybody do what he bids them at Clavering,--except\npapa, sometimes. But he scolds him, too. I heard him the other day in\nthe library.\"\n\n\"And did my father take it from him?\"\n\n\"He did, in a sort of a way. I don't think papa likes him; but then\nhe knows, and we all know, that he is so good. He never spares\nhimself in anything. He has nothing but his curacy, and what he gives\naway is wonderful.\"\n\n\"I hope he won't take to scolding me,\" said Harry, proudly.\n\n\"As you don't concern yourself about the parish, I should say that\nyou're safe. I suppose he thinks mamma does everything right, for he\nnever scolds her.\"\n\n\"There is no talk of his going away.\"\n\n\"None at all. I think we should all be sorry, because he does so much\ngood.\"\n\nFlorence reigned supreme in the estimation of the rectory family all\nthe evening of her arrival and till after breakfast the next morning,\nbut then the bride elect was restored to her natural pre-eminence.\nThis, however, lasted only for two days, after which the bride was\ntaken away. The wedding was very nice, and pretty, and comfortable;\nand the people of Clavering were much better satisfied with it than\nthey had been with that other marriage which has been mentioned as\nhaving been celebrated in Clavering Church. The rectory family was\ngenerally popular, and everybody wished well to the daughter who\nwas being given away. When they were gone there was a breakfast at\nthe rectory, and speeches were made with much volubility. On such\nan occasion the rector was a great man, and Harry also shone in\nconspicuous rivalry with his father. But Mr. Saul's spirit was not so\nwell tuned to the occasion as that of the rector or his son, and when\nhe got upon his legs, and mournfully expressed a hope that his friend\nMr. Fielding might be enabled to bear the trials of this life with\nfortitude, it was felt by them all that the speaking had better be\nbrought to an end.\n\n\"You shouldn't laugh at him, Harry,\" Fanny said to her brother\nafterwards, almost seriously. \"One man can do one thing and one\nanother. You can make a speech better than he can, but I don't think\nyou could preach so good a sermon.\"\n\n\"I declare I think you're getting fond of him after all,\" said Harry.\nUpon hearing this Fanny turned away with a look of great offence. \"No\none but a brother,\" said she, \"would say such a thing as that to me,\nbecause I don't like to hear the poor man ridiculed without cause.\"\nThat evening, when they were alone, Fanny told Florence the whole\nstory about Mr. Saul. \"I tell you, you know, because you're like one\nof ourselves now. It has never been mentioned to any one out of the\nfamily.\"\n\nFlorence declared that the story would be sacred with her.\n\n\"I'm sure of that, dear, and therefore I like you to know it. Of\ncourse such a thing was quite out of the question. The poor fellow\nhas no means at all,--literally none. And then, independently of\nthat--\"\n\n\"I don't think I should ever bring myself to think of that as the\nfirst thing,\" said Florence.\n\n\"No, nor would I. If I really were attached to a man, I think I would\ntell him so, and agree to wait, either with hope or without it.\"\n\n\"Just so, Fanny.\"\n\n\"But there was nothing of that kind; and, indeed, he's the sort of\nman that no girl would think of being in love with,--isn't he? You\nsee he will hardly take the trouble to dress himself decently.\"\n\n\"I have only seen him at a wedding, you know.\"\n\n\"And for him he was quite bright. But you will see plenty of him if\nyou will go to the schools with me. And indeed he comes here a great\ndeal, quite as much as he did before that happened. He is so good,\nFlorence!\"\n\n\"Poor man!\"\n\n\"I can't in the least make out from his manner whether he has given\nup thinking about it. I suppose he has. Indeed, of course he has,\nbecause he must know that it would be of no sort of use. But he is\none of those men of whom you can never say whether they are happy or\nnot; and you never can be quite sure what may be in his mind.\"\n\n\"He is not bound to the place at all,--not like your father?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Fanny, thinking perhaps that Mr. Saul might find\nhimself to be bound to the place, though not exactly with bonds\nsimilar to those which kept her father there.\n\n\"If he found himself to be unhappy, he could go,\" said Florence.\n\n\"Oh, yes; he could go if he were unhappy,\" said Fanny. \"That is, he\ncould go if he pleased.\"\n\nLady Clavering had come to the wedding; but no one else had been\npresent from the great house. Sir Hugh, indeed, was not at home; but,\nas the rector truly observed, he might have been at home if he had so\npleased. \"But he is a man,\" said the father to the son, \"who always\ndoes a rude thing if it be in his power. For myself, I care nothing\nfor him, as he knows. But he thinks that Mary would have liked to\nhave seen him as the head of the family, and therefore he does not\ncome. He has greater skill in making himself odious than any man I\never knew. As for her, they say he's leading her a terrible life. And\nhe's becoming so stingy about money, too!\"\n\n\"I hear that Archie is very heavy on him.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that he would allow any man to be heavy on him, as\nyou call it. Archie has means of his own, and I suppose has not run\nthrough them yet. If Hugh has advanced him money, you may be sure\nthat he has security. As for Archie, he will come to an end very\nsoon, if what I hear is true. They tell me he is always at Newmarket,\nand that he always loses.\"\n\nBut though Sir Hugh was thus uncourteous to the rector and to the\nrector's daughter, he was so far prepared to be civil to his cousin\nHarry, that he allowed his wife to ask all the rectory family to dine\nup at the house, in honour of Harry's sweetheart. Florence Burton\nwas specially invited with Lady Clavering's sweetest smile. Florence,\nof course, referred the matter to her hostess, but it was decided\nthat they should all accept the invitation. It was given, personally,\nafter the breakfast, and it is not always easy to decline invitations\nso given. It may, I think, be doubted whether any man or woman has a\nright to give an invitation in this way, and whether all invitations\nso given should not be null and void, from the fact of the unfair\nadvantage that has been taken. The man who fires at a sitting bird is\nknown to be no sportsman. Now, the dinner-giver who catches his guest\nin an unguarded moment, and bags him when he has had no chance to\nrise upon his wing, does fire at a sitting bird. In this instance,\nhowever, Lady Clavering's little speeches were made only to Mrs.\nClavering and to Florence. She said nothing personally to the rector,\nand he therefore might have escaped. But his wife talked him over.\n\n\"I think you should go for Harry's sake,\" said Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"I don't see what good it will do Harry.\"\n\n\"It will show that you approve of the match.\"\n\n\"I don't approve or disapprove of it. He's his own master.\"\n\n\"But you do approve, you know, as you countenance it; and there\ncannot possibly be a sweeter girl than Florence Burton. We all like\nher, and I'm sure you seem to take to her thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Take to her; yes, I take to her very well. She's ladylike, and\nthough she's no beauty, she looks pretty, and is spirited. And I\ndaresay she's clever.\"\n\n\"And so good.\"\n\n\"If she's good, that's better than all. Only I don't see what they're\nto live on.\"\n\n\"But as she is here, you will go with us to the great house?\"\n\nMrs. Clavering never asked her husband anything in vain, and the\nrector agreed to go. He apologized for this afterwards to his son by\nexplaining that he did it as a duty. \"It will serve for six months,\"\nhe said. \"If I did not go there about once in six months, there would\nbe supposed to be a family quarrel, and that would be bad for the\nparish.\"\n\nHarry was to remain only a week at Clavering, and the dinner was to\ntake place the evening before he went away. On that morning he walked\nall round the park with Florence,--as he had before often walked with\nJulia,--and took that occasion of giving her a full history of the\nClavering family. \"We none of us like my cousin Hugh,\" he had said.\n\"But she is at least harmless, and she means to be good-natured. She\nis very unlike her sister, Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"So I should suppose, from what you have told me.\"\n\n\"Altogether an inferior being.\"\n\n\"And she has only one child.\"\n\n\"Only one,--a boy now two years old. They say he's anything but\nstrong.\"\n\n\"And Sir Hugh has one brother.\"\n\n\"Yes; Archie Clavering. I think Archie is a worse fellow even than\nHugh. He makes more attempts to be agreeable, but there is something\nin his eye which I always distrust. And then he is a man who does no\ngood in the world to anybody.\"\n\n\"He's not married?\"\n\n\"No; he's not married, and I don't suppose he ever will marry. It's\non the cards, Florence, that the future baronet may be--\" Then she\nfrowned on him, walked on quickly, and changed the conversation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nSIR HUGH AND HIS BROTHER ARCHIE.\n\n\nThere was a numerous gathering of Claverings in the drawing-room of\nthe Great House when the family from the rectory arrived comprising\nthree generations; for the nurse was in the room holding the heir\nin her arms. Mrs. Clavering and Fanny of course inspected the child\nat once, as they were bound to do, while Lady Clavering welcomed\nFlorence Burton. Archie spoke a word or two to his uncle, and Sir\nHugh vouchsafed to give one finger to his cousin Harry by way\nof shaking hands with him. Then there came a feeble squeak from\nthe infant, and there was a cloud at once upon Sir Hugh's brow.\n\"Hermione,\" he said, \"I wish you wouldn't have the child in here.\nIt's not the place for him. He's always cross. I've said a dozen\ntimes I wouldn't have him down here just before dinner.\" Then a sign\nwas made to the nurse, and she walked off with her burden. It was a\npoor, rickety, unalluring bairn, but it was all that Lady Clavering\nhad, and she would fain have been allowed to show it to her\nrelatives, as other mothers are allowed to do.\n\n\"Hugh,\" said his wife, \"shall I introduce you to Miss Burton?\"\n\nThen Sir Hugh came forward and shook hands with his new guest, with\nsome sort of apology for his remissness, while Harry stood by,\nglowering at him, with offence in his eye. \"My father is right,\"\nhe had said to himself when his cousin failed to notice Florence\non her first entrance into the room; \"he is impertinent as well as\ndisagreeable. I don't care for quarrels in the parish, and so I shall\nlet him know.\"\n\n\"Upon my word she's a doosed good-looking little thing,\" said Archie,\ncoming up to him, after having also shaken hands with her;--\"doosed\ngood-looking, I call her.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you think so,\" said Harry, drily.\n\n\"Let's see; where was it you picked her up? I did hear, but I\nforget.\"\n\n\"I picked her up, as you call it, at Stratton, where her father\nlives.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I know. He's the fellow that coached you in your new\nbusiness, isn't he? By-the-by, Harry, I think you've made a mess of\nit in changing your line. I'd have stuck to my governor's shop if I'd\nbeen you. You'd got through all the d----d fag of it, and there's the\nliving that has always belonged to a Clavering.\"\n\n\"What would your brother have said if I had asked him to give it to\nme?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't have given it of course. Nobody does give anything to\nanybody now-a-days. Livings are a sort of thing that people buy. But\nyou'd have got it under favourable circumstances.\"\n\n\"The fact is, Archie, I'm not very fond of the church, as a\nprofession.\"\n\n\"I should have thought it easy work. Look at your father. He keeps\na curate and doesn't take any trouble himself. Upon my word, if I'd\nknown as much then as I do now, I'd have had a shy for it myself.\nHugh couldn't have refused it to me.\"\n\n\"But Hugh can't give it while his uncle holds it.\"\n\n\"That would have been against me to be sure, and your governor's life\nis pretty nearly as good as mine. I shouldn't have liked waiting; so\nI suppose it's as well as it is.\"\n\nThere may perhaps have been other reasons why Archie Clavering's\nregrets that he did not take holy orders were needless. He had never\nsucceeded in learning anything that any master had ever attempted to\nteach him, although he had shown considerable aptitude in picking up\nacquirements for which no regular masters are appointed. He knew the\nfathers and mothers,--sires and dams I ought perhaps to say,--and\ngrandfathers and grandmothers, and so back for some generations,\nof all the horses of note living in his day. He knew also the\ncircumstances of all races,--what horses would run at them, and at\nwhat ages, what were the stakes, the periods of running, and the\nspecial interests of each affair. But not, on that account, should it\nbe thought that the turf had been profitable to him. That it might\nbecome profitable at some future time, was possible; but Captain\nArchibald Clavering had not yet reached the profitable stage in\nthe career of a betting man, though perhaps he was beginning to\nqualify himself for it. He was not bad-looking, though his face was\nunprepossessing to a judge of character. He was slight and well made,\nabout five feet nine in height, with light brown hair, which had\nalready left the top of his head bald, with slight whiskers, and a\nwell-formed moustache. But the peculiarity of his face was in his\neyes. His eyebrows were light-coloured and very slight, and this was\nmade more apparent by the skin above the eyes, which was loose and\nhung down over the outside corners of them, giving him a look of\ncunning which was disagreeable. He seemed always to be speculating,\ncounting up the odds, and calculating whether anything could be done\nwith the events then present before him. And he was always ready to\nmake a bet, being ever provided with a book for that purpose. He\nwould take the odds that the sun did not rise on the morrow, and\nwould either win the bet or wrangle in the losing of it. He would\nwrangle, but would do so noiselessly, never on such occasions\ndamaging his cause by a loud voice. He was now about thirty-three\nyears of age, and was two years younger than the baronet. Sir Hugh\nwas not a gambler like his brother, but I do not know that he\nwas therefore a more estimable man. He was greedy and anxious to\nincrease his store, never willing to lose that which he possessed,\nfond of pleasure, but very careful of himself in the enjoyment of\nit, handsome, every inch an English gentleman in appearance, and\ntherefore popular with men and women of his own class who were not\nnear enough to him to know him well, given to but few words, proud\nof his name, and rank, and place, well versed in the business of the\nworld, a match for most men in money matters, not ignorant, though he\nrarely opened a book, selfish, and utterly regardless of the feelings\nof all those with whom he came in contact. Such were Sir Hugh\nClavering and his brother the captain.\n\nSir Hugh took Florence in to dinner, and when the soup had been eaten\nmade an attempt to talk to her. \"How long have you been here, Miss\nBurton?\"\n\n\"Nearly a week,\" said Florence.\n\n\"Ah;--you came to the wedding; I was sorry I couldn't be here. It\nwent off very well, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Very well indeed, I think.\"\n\n\"They're tiresome things in general,--weddings. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no,--except that some person one loves is always being\ntaken away.\"\n\n\"You'll be the next person to be taken away yourself, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I must be the next person at home, because I am the last that is\nleft. All my sisters are married.\"\n\n\"And how many are there?\"\n\n\"There are five married.\"\n\n\"Good heavens--five!\"\n\n\"And they are all married to men in the same profession as Harry.\"\n\n\"Quite a family affair,\" said Sir Hugh. Harry, who was sitting on\nthe other side of Florence, heard this, and would have preferred\nthat Florence should have said nothing about her sisters. \"Why,\nHarry,\" said the baronet, \"if you will go into partnership with your\nfather-in-law and all your brothers-in-law you could stand against\nthe world.\"\n\n\"You might add my four brothers,\" said Florence, who saw no shame in\nthe fact that they were all engaged in the same business.\n\n\"Good heaven!\" exclaimed Sir Hugh, and after that he did not say much\nmore to Florence.\n\nThe rector had taken Lady Clavering in to dinner, and they two did\nmanage to carry on between them some conversation respecting the\nparish affairs. Lady Clavering was not active among the poor,--nor\nwas the rector himself, and perhaps neither of them knew how little\nthe other did; but they could talk Clavering talk, and the parson was\nwilling to take for granted his neighbour's good will to make herself\nagreeable. But Mrs. Clavering, who sat between Sir Hugh and Archie,\nhad a very bad time of it. Sir Hugh spoke to her once during the\ndinner, saying that he hoped she was satisfied with her daughter's\nmarriage; but even this he said in a tone that seemed to imply that\nany such satisfaction must rest on very poor grounds. \"Thoroughly\nsatisfied,\" said Mrs. Clavering, drawing herself up and looking very\nunlike the usual Mrs. Clavering of the rectory. After that there was\nno further conversation between her and Sir Hugh. \"The worst of him\nto me is always this,\" she said that evening to her husband, \"that he\nputs me so much out of conceit with myself. If I were with him long I\nshould begin to find myself the most disagreeable woman in England!\"\n\"Then pray don't be with him long,\" said the rector.\n\nBut Archie made conversation throughout dinner, and added greatly to\nMrs. Clavering's troubles by doing so. There was nothing in common\nbetween them, but still Archie went on laboriously with his work.\nIt was a duty which he recognized, and at which he would work hard.\nWhen he had used up Mary's marriage, a subject which he economized\ncarefully, so that he brought it down to the roast saddle of mutton,\nhe began upon Harry's match. When was it to be? Where were they to\nlive? Was there any money? What manner of people were the Burtons?\nPerhaps he might get over it? This he whispered very lowly, and it\nwas the question next in sequence to that about the money. When, in\nanswer to this, Mrs. Clavering with considerable energy declared that\nanything of that kind would be a misfortune of which there seemed\nto be no chance whatever, he recovered himself as he thought very\nskilfully. \"Oh, yes; of course; that's just what I meant;--a doosed\nnice girl I think her;--a doosed nice girl, all round.\" Archie's\nquestions were very laborious to his fellow-labourer in his\nconversation because he never allowed one of them to pass without an\nanswer. He always recognized the fact that he was working hard on\nbehalf of society, and, as he used to say himself, that he had no\nidea of pulling all the coach up the hill by his own shoulders.\nWhenever therefore he had made his effort he waited for his\ncompanion's, looking closely into her face, cunningly driving her on,\nso that she also should pull her share of the coach. Before dinner\nwas over Mrs. Clavering found the hill to be very steep, and the\ncoach to be very heavy. \"I'll bet you seven to one,\" said he,--and\nthis was his parting speech as Mrs. Clavering rose up at Lady\nClavering's nod,--\"I'll bet you seven to one, that the whole box and\ndice of them are married before me,--or at any rate as soon; and I\ndon't mean to remain single much longer, I can tell you.\" The \"box\nand dice of them\" was supposed to comprise Harry, Florence, Fanny,\nand Lady Ongar, of all of whom mention had been made, and that saving\nclause,--\"at any rate as soon,\"--was cunningly put in, as it had\noccurred to Archie that he perhaps might be married on the same day\nas one of those other persons. But Mrs. Clavering was not compelled\neither to accept or reject the bet, as she was already moving before\nthe terms had been fully explained to her.\n\nLady Clavering as she went out of the room stopped a moment behind\nHarry's chair and whispered a word to him. \"I want to speak to you\nbefore you go to-night.\" Then she passed on.\n\n\"What's that Hermione was saying?\" asked Sir Hugh, when he had shut\nthe door.\n\n\"She only told me that she wanted to speak to me.\"\n\n\"She has always got some cursed secret,\" said Sir Hugh. \"If there is\nanything I hate, it's a secret.\" Now this was hardly fair, for Sir\nHugh was a man very secret in his own affairs, never telling his\nwife anything about them. He kept two banker's accounts so that no\nbanker's clerk might know how he stood as regarded ready money, and\nhardly treated even his lawyer with confidence.\n\nHe did not move from his own chair, so that, after dinner, his uncle\nwas not next to him. The places left by the ladies were not closed\nup, and the table was very uncomfortable.\n\n\"I see they're going to have another week after this with the\nPytchley,\" said Sir Hugh to his brother.\n\n\"I suppose they will,--or ten days. Things ain't very early this\nyear.\"\n\n\"I think I shall go down. It's never any use trying to hunt here\nafter the middle of March.\"\n\n\"You're rather short of foxes, are you not?\" said the rector, making\nan attempt to join the conversation.\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know anything about it,\" said Sir Hugh.\n\n\"There are foxes at Clavering,\" said Archie, recommencing his duty.\n\"The hounds will be here on Saturday, and I'll bet three to one I\nfind a fox before twelve o'clock, or, say, half-past twelve,--that\nis, if they'll draw punctually and let me do as I like with the pack.\nI'll bet a guinea we find, and a guinea we run, and a guinea we kill;\nthat is, you know, if they'll really look for a fox.\"\n\nThe rector had been willing to fall into a little hunting talk for\nthe sake of society, but he was not prepared to go the length that\nArchie proposed to take him, and therefore the subject dropped.\n\n\"At any rate I shan't stay here after to-morrow,\" said Sir Hugh,\nstill addressing himself to his brother. \"Pass the wine, will you,\nHarry; that is, if your father is drinking any.\"\n\n\"No more wine for me,\" said the rector, almost angrily.\n\n\"Liberty Hall,\" said Sir Hugh; \"everybody does as they like about\nthat. I mean to have another bottle of claret. Archie, ring the bell,\nwill you?\" Captain Clavering, though he was further from the bell\nthan his elder brother, got up and did as he was bid. The claret\ncame, and was drunk almost in silence. The rector, though he had a\nhigh opinion of the cellar of the great house, would take none of\nthe new bottle, because he was angry. Harry filled his glass, and\nattempted to say something. Sir Hugh answered him by a monosyllable,\nand Archie offered to bet him two to one that he was wrong.\n\n\"I'll go into the drawing-room,\" said the rector, getting up.\n\n\"All right,\" said Sir Hugh; \"you'll find coffee there, I daresay. Has\nyour father given up wine?\" he asked, as soon as the door was closed.\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" said Harry.\n\n\"He used to take as good a whack as any man I know. The bishop hasn't\nput his embargo on that as well as the hunting, I hope?\" To this\nHarry made no answer.\n\n\"He's in the blues, I think,\" said Archie. \"Is there anything the\nmatter with him, Harry?\"\n\n\"Nothing as far as I know.\"\n\n\"If I were left at Clavering all the year, with nothing to do, as\nhe is, I think I should drink a good deal of wine,\" said Sir Hugh.\n\"I don't know what it is,--something in the air, I suppose,--but\neverybody always seems to me to be dreadfully dull here. You ain't\ntaking any wine either. Don't stop here out of ceremony, you know,\nif you want to go after Miss Burton.\" Harry took him at his word,\nand went after Miss Burton, leaving the brothers together over their\nclaret.\n\nThe two brothers remained drinking their wine, but they drank it in\nan uncomfortable fashion, not saying much to each other for the first\nten minutes after the other Claverings were gone. Archie was in some\ndegree afraid of his brother, and never offered to make any bets with\nhim. Hugh had once put a stop to this altogether. \"Archie,\" he had\nsaid, \"pray understand that there is no money to be made out of me,\nat any rate not by you. If you lost money to me, you wouldn't think\nit necessary to pay; and I certainly shall lose none to you.\" The\nhabit of proposing to bet had become with Archie so much a matter of\ncourse, that he did not generally intend any real speculation by his\noffers; but with his brother he had dropped even the habit. And he\nseldom began any conversation with Hugh unless he had some point\nto gain,--an advance of money to ask, or some favour to beg in the\nway of shooting, or the loan of a horse. On such occasions he would\ncommence the negotiation with his usual diplomacy, not knowing any\nother mode of expressing his wishes; but he was aware that his\nbrother would always detect his manoeuvres, and expose them before\nhe had got through his first preface; and, therefore, as I have said,\nhe was afraid of Hugh.\n\n\"I don't know what's come to my uncle of late,\" said Hugh, after a\nwhile. \"I think I shall have to drop them at the rectory altogether.\"\n\n\"He never had much to say for himself.\"\n\n\"But he has a mode of expressing himself without speaking, which I\ndo not choose to put up with at my table. The fact is they are going\nto the mischief at the rectory. His eldest girl has just married a\ncurate.\"\n\n\"Fielding has got a living.\"\n\n\"It's something very small then, and I suppose Fanny will marry that\nprig they have here. My uncle himself never does any of his own work,\nand now Harry is going to make a fool of himself. I used to think he\nwould fall on his legs.\"\n\n\"He is a clever fellow.\"\n\n\"Then why is he such a fool as to marry such a girl as this, without\nmoney, good looks, or breeding? It's well for you he is such a fool,\nor else you wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Julia always had a sneaking fondness for Harry, and if he had waited\nwould have taken him now. She was very near making a fool of herself\nwith him once, before Lord Ongar turned up.\"\n\nTo this Archie said nothing, but he changed colour, and it may almost\nbe said of him that he blushed. Why he was affected in so singular a\nmanner by his brother's words will be best explained by a statement\nof what took place in the back drawing-room a little later in the\nevening.\n\nWhen Harry reached the drawing-room he went up to Lady Clavering, but\nshe said nothing to him then of especial notice. She was talking\nto Mrs. Clavering while the rector was reading,--or pretending to\nread,--a review, and the two girls were chattering together in\nanother part of the room. Then they had coffee, and after awhile the\ntwo other men came in from their wine. Lady Clavering did not move at\nonce, but she took the first opportunity of doing so, when Sir Hugh\ncame up to Mrs. Clavering and spoke a word to her. A few minutes\nafter that Harry found himself closeted with Lady Clavering, in a\nlittle room detached from the others, though the doors between the\ntwo were open.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Lady Clavering, \"that Sir Hugh has asked Julia to\ncome here?\" Harry paused a moment, and then acknowledged that he did\nknow it.\n\n\"I hope you did not advise her to refuse.\"\n\n\"I advise her! Oh dear, no. She did not ask me anything about it.\"\n\n\"But she has refused. Don't you think she has been very wrong?\"\n\n\"It is hard to say,\" said Harry. \"You know I thought it very cruel\nthat Hugh did not receive her immediately on her return. If I had\nbeen him I should have gone to Paris to meet her.\"\n\n\"It's no good talking of that now, Harry. Hugh is hard, and we all\nknow that. Who feels it most, do you think; Julia or I? But as he has\ncome round, what can she gain by standing off? Will it not be the\nbest thing for her to come here?\"\n\n\"I don't know that she has much to gain by it.\"\n\n\"Harry,--do you know that we have a plan?\" \"Who is we?\" Harry asked;\nbut she went on without noticing his question. \"I tell you, because I\nbelieve you can help us more than any one, if you will. Only for your\nengagement with Miss Burton I should not mention it to you; and, but\nfor that, the plan would, I daresay, be of no use.\"\n\n\"What is the plan?\" said Harry, very gravely. A vague idea of\nwhat the plan might be had come across Harry's mind during Lady\nClavering's last speech.\n\n\"Would it not be a good thing if Julia and Archie were to be\nmarried?\" She asked the question in a quick, hesitating voice,\nlooking at first eagerly up into his face, and then turning away her\neyes, as though she were afraid of the answer she might read there.\n\"Of course I know that you were fond of her, but all that can be\nnothing now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harry, \"that can be nothing now.\"\n\n\"Then why shouldn't Archie have her? It would make us all so much\nmore comfortable together. I told Archie that I should speak to you,\nbecause I know that you have more weight with her than any of us; but\nHugh doesn't know that I mean it.\"\n\n\"Does Sir Hugh know of the,--the plan?\"\n\n\"It was he who proposed it. Archie will be very badly off when he has\nsettled with Hugh about all their money dealings. Of course Julia's\nmoney would be left in her own hands; there would be no intention to\ninterfere with that. But the position would be so good for him; and\nit would, you know, put him on his legs.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"it would put him on his legs, I daresay.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't it be so? She can't live alone by herself always.\nOf course she never could have really loved Lord Ongar.\"\n\n\"Never, I should think,\" said Harry.\n\n\"And Archie is good-natured, and good-tempered,\nand--and--and--good-looking. Don't you think so? I think it would\njust do for her. She'd have her own way, for he's not a bit like\nHugh, you know. He's not so clever as Hugh, but he is much more\ngood-natured. Don't you think it would be a good arrangement, Harry?\"\nThen again she looked up into his face anxiously.\n\nNothing in the whole matter surprised him more than her eagerness in\nadvocating the proposal. Why should she desire that her sister should\nbe sacrificed in this way? But in so thinking of it he forgot her own\nposition, and the need that there was to her for some friend to be\nnear to her,--for some comfort and assistance. She had spoken truly\nin saying that the plan had originated with her husband; but since it\nhad been suggested to her, she had not ceased to think of it, and to\nwish for it.\n\n\"Well, Harry, what do you say?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't see that I have anything to say.\"\n\n\"But I know you can help us. When I was with her the last time she\ndeclared that you were the only one of us she ever wished to see\nagain. She meant to include me then especially, but of course she was\nnot thinking of Archie. I know you can help us if you will.\"\n\n\"Am I to ask her to marry him?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that; I don't think that would do any good. But you\nmight persuade her to come here. I think she would come if you\nadvised her; and then, after a bit, you might say a good word for\nArchie.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I could not.\"\n\n\"Why not, Harry?\"\n\n\"Because I know he would not make her happy. What good would such a\nmarriage do her?\"\n\n\"Think of her position. No one will visit her unless she is first\nreceived here, or at any rate unless she comes to us in town. And\nthen it would be up-hill work. Do you know Lord Ongar had absolutely\ndetermined at one time to--to get a divorce?\"\n\n\"And do you believe that she was guilty?\"\n\n\"I don't say that. No; why should I believe anything against my own\nsister when nothing is proved. But that makes no difference, if the\nworld believes it. They say now that if he had lived three months\nlonger she never would have got the money.\"\n\n\"Then they say lies. Who is it says so? A parcel of old women who\ndelight in having some one to run down and backbite. It is all false,\nLady Clavering.\"\n\n\"But what does it signify, Harry? There she is, and you know how\npeople are talking. Of course it would be best for her to marry\nagain; and if she would take Archie,--Sir Hugh's brother, my\nbrother-in-law, nothing further would be said. She might go anywhere\nthen. As her sister, I feel sure that it is the best thing she could\ndo.\"\n\nHarry's brow became clouded, and there was a look of anger on his\nface as he answered her.\n\n\"Lady Clavering,\" he said, \"your sister will never marry my cousin\nArchie. I look upon the thing as impossible.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is, Harry, that you,--you yourself would not wish it.\"\n\n\"Why should I wish it?\"\n\n\"He is your own cousin.\"\n\n\"Cousin indeed! Why should I wish it, or why should I not wish it?\nThey are neither of them anything to me.\"\n\n\"She ought not to be anything to you.\"\n\n\"And she is nothing. She may marry Archie, if she pleases, for me. I\nshall not set her against him. But, Lady Clavering, you might as well\ntell him to get one of the stars. I don't think you can know your\nsister when you suppose such a match to be possible.\"\n\n\"Hermione!\" shouted Sir Hugh,--and the shout was uttered in a voice\nthat always caused Lady Clavering to tremble.\n\n\"I am coming,\" she said, rising from her chair. \"Don't set yourself\nagainst it, Harry,\" and then, without waiting to hear him further,\nshe obeyed her husband's summons. \"What the mischief keeps you in\nthere?\" he said. It seemed that things had not been going well in the\nlarger room. The rector had stuck to his review, taking no notice of\nSir Hugh when he entered. \"You seem to be very fond of your book, all\nof a sudden,\" Sir Hugh had said, after standing silent on the rug for\na few minutes.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said the rector,--\"just at present.\"\n\n\"It's quite new with you, then,\" said Sir Hugh, \"or else you're very\nmuch belied.\"\n\n\"Hugh,\" said Mr. Clavering, rising slowly from his chair, \"I don't\noften come into my father's house, but when I do, I wish to be\ntreated with respect. You are the only person in this parish that\never omits to do so.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" said Sir Hugh.\n\nThe two girls sat cowering in their seats, and poor Florence\nmust have begun to entertain an uncomfortable idea of her future\nconnexions. Archie made a frantic attempt to raise some conversation\nwith Mrs. Clavering about the weather. Mrs. Clavering, paying no\nattention to Archie whatever, looked at her husband with beseeching\neyes. \"Henry,\" she said, \"do not allow yourself to be angry; pray do\nnot. What is the use?\"\n\n\"None on earth,\" he said, returning to his book. \"No use on\nearth;--and worse than none in showing it.\"\n\nThen it was that Sir Hugh had made a diversion by calling to his\nwife. \"I wish you'd stay with us, and not go off alone with one\nperson in particular, in that way.\" Lady Clavering looked round and\nimmediately saw that things were unpleasant. \"Archie,\" she said,\n\"will you ring for tea?\" And Archie did ring. The tea was brought,\nand a cup was taken all round, almost in silence.\n\nHarry in the meantime remained by himself thinking of what he had\nheard from Lady Clavering. Archie Clavering marry Lady Ongar,--marry\nhis Julia! It was impossible. He could not bring himself even to\nthink of such an arrangement with equanimity. He was almost frantic\nwith anger as he thought of this proposition to restore Lady Ongar to\nthe position in the world's repute which she had a right to claim, by\nsuch a marriage as that. \"She would indeed be disgraced then,\" said\nHarry to himself. But he knew that it was impossible. He could see\nwhat would be the nature of Julia's countenance if Archie should ever\nget near enough to her to make his proposal! Archie indeed! There\nwas no one for whom, at that moment, he entertained so thorough a\ncontempt as he did for his cousin, Archie Clavering.\n\nLet us hope that he was no dog in the manger;--that the feelings\nwhich he now entertained for poor Archie would not have been roused\nagainst any other possible suitor who might have been named as a\nfitting husband for Lady Ongar. Lady Ongar could be nothing to him!\n\nBut I fear that he was a dog in the manger, and that any marriage\ncontemplated for Lady Ongar, either by herself or by others for her,\nwould have been distasteful to him,--unnaturally distasteful. He knew\nthat Lady Ongar could be nothing to him; and yet, as he came out of\nthe small room into the larger room, there was something sore about\nhis heart, and the soreness was occasioned by the thought that any\nsecond marriage should be thought possible for Lady Ongar. Florence\nsmiled on him as he went up to her, but I doubt whether she would\nhave smiled had she known all his heart.\n\nSoon after that Mrs. Clavering rose to return home, having swallowed\na peace-offering in the shape of a cup of tea. But though the tea\nhad quieted the storm then on the waters, there was no true peace in\nthe rector's breast. He shook hands cordially with Lady Clavering,\nwithout animosity with Archie, and then held out three fingers to the\nbaronet. The baronet held out one finger. Each nodded at the other,\nand so they parted. Harry, who knew nothing of what had happened, and\nwho was still thinking of Lady Ongar, busied himself with Florence,\nand they were soon out of the house, walking down the broad road from\nthe front door.\n\n\"I will never enter that house again, when I know that Hugh Clavering\nis in it,\" said the rector.\n\n\"Don't make rash assertions, Henry,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I hope it is not rash, but I make that assertion,\" he said. \"I will\nnever again enter that house as my nephew's guest. I have borne a\ngreat deal for the sake of peace, but there are things which a man\ncannot bear.\"\n\nThen, as they walked home, the two girls explained to Harry what had\noccurred in the larger room, while he was talking to Lady Clavering\nin the smaller one. But he said nothing to them of the subject of\nthat conversation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nLADY ONGAR TAKES POSSESSION.\n\n\nI do not know that there is in England a more complete gentleman's\nresidence than Ongar Park, nor could there be one in better repair,\nor more fit for immediate habitation than was that house when it came\ninto the hands of the young widow. The park was not large, containing\nabout sixty or seventy acres. But there was a home-farm attached to\nthe place, which also now belonged to Lady Ongar for her life, and\nwhich gave to the park itself an appearance of extent which it would\notherwise have wanted. The house, regarded as a nobleman's mansion,\nwas moderate in size, but it was ample for the requirements of any\nordinarily wealthy family. The dining-room, library, drawing-rooms,\nand breakfast-room, were all large and well-arranged. The hall was\nhandsome and spacious, and the bed-rooms were sufficiently numerous\nto make an auctioneer's mouth water. But the great charm of Ongar\nPark lay in the grounds immediately round the house, which sloped\ndown from the terrace before the windows to a fast-running stream\nwhich was almost hidden,--but was not hidden,--by the shrubs on its\nbank. Though the domain itself was small, the shrubberies and walks\nwere extensive. It was a place costly to maintain in its present\nperfect condition, but when that was said against it, all was said\nagainst it which its bitterest enemies could allege.\n\nBut Lady Ongar, with her large jointure, and with no external\nexpenses whatever, could afford this delight without imprudence.\nEverything in and about the place was her own, and she might live\nthere happily, even in the face of the world's frowns, if she could\nteach herself to find happiness in rural luxuries. On her immediate\nreturn to England, her lawyer had told her that he found there would\nbe opposition to her claim, and that an attempt would be made to keep\nthe house out of her hands. Lord Ongar's people would, he said, bribe\nher to submit to this by immediate acquiescence as to her income.\nBut she had declared that she would not submit,--that she would\nhave house and income and all; and she had been successful. \"Why\nshould I surrender what is my own?\" she had said, looking the lawyer\nfull in the face. The lawyer had not dared to tell her that her\nopponents,--Lord Ongar's heirs,--had calculated on her anxiety to\navoid exposure; but she knew that that was meant. \"I have nothing to\nfear from them,\" she said, \"and mean to claim what is my own by my\nsettlement.\" There had, in truth, been no ground for disputing her\nright, and the place was given up to her before she had been three\nmonths in England. She at once went down and took possession, and\nthere she was, alone, when her sister was communicating to Harry\nClavering her plan about Captain Archie.\n\nShe had never seen the place till she reached it on this occasion;\nnor had she ever seen, nor would she now probably ever see, Lord\nOngar's larger house, Courton Castle. She had gone abroad with him\nimmediately on their marriage, and now she had returned a widow to\ntake possession of his house. There she was in possession of it all.\nThe furniture in the rooms, the books in the cases, the gilded clocks\nand grand mirrors about the house, all the implements of wealthy\ncare about the gardens, the corn in the granaries and the ricks\nin the hay-yard, the horses in the stable, and the cows lowing in\nthe fields,--they were all hers. She had performed her part of the\nbargain, and now the price was paid to her into her hands. When she\narrived she did not know what was the extent of her riches in this\nworld's goods; nor, in truth, had she at once the courage to ask\nquestions on the subject. She saw cows, and was told of horses; and\nwords came to her gradually of sheep and oxen, of poultry, pigs, and\ngrowing calves. It was as though a new world had opened itself before\nher eyes, full of interest, and as though all that world were her\nown. She looked at it, and knew that it was the price of her bargain.\nUpon the whole she had been very lucky. She had, indeed, passed\nthrough a sharp agony,--an agony sharp almost to death; but the agony\nhad been short, and the price was in her hand.\n\nA close carriage had met her at the station, and taken her with her\nmaid to the house. She had so arranged that she had reached the\nstation after dark, and even then had felt that the eyes of many were\nupon her as she went out to her carriage, with her face covered by\na veil. She was all alone, and there would be no one at the house\nto whom she could speak;--but the knowledge that the carriage was\nher own perhaps consoled her. The housekeeper who received her was a\nstout, elderly, comfortable body, to whom she could perhaps say a few\nwords beyond those which might be spoken to an ordinary servant; but\nshe fancied at once that the housekeeper was cold to her, and solemn\nin her demeanour. \"I hope you have good fires, Mrs. Button.\" \"Yes,\nmy lady.\" \"I think I will have some tea; I don't want anything else\nto-night.\" \"Very well, my lady.\" Mrs. Button, maintaining a solemn\ncountenance, would not go beyond this; and yet Mrs. Button looked\nlike a woman who could have enjoyed a gossip, had the lady been a\nlady to her mind. Perhaps Mrs. Button did not like serving a lady as\nto whom such sad stories were told. Lady Ongar, as she thought of\nthis, drew herself up unconsciously, and sent Mrs. Button away from\nher.\n\nThe next morning, after an early breakfast, Lady Ongar went out. She\nwas determined that she would work hard; that she would understand\nthe farm; that she would know the labourers; that she would assist\nthe poor; that she would have a school; and, above all, that she\nwould make all the privileges of ownership her own. Was not the price\nin her hand, and would she not use it? She felt that it was very good\nthat something of the price had come to her thus in the shape of\nland, and beeves, and wide, heavy outside garniture. From them she\nwould pluck an interest which mere money could not have given her.\nShe was out early, therefore, that she might look round upon the\nthings that were her own.\n\nAnd there came upon her a feeling that she would not empty this sweet\ncup at one draught, that she would dally somewhat with the rich\nbanquet that was spread for her. She had many griefs to overcome,\nmuch sorrow to conquer, perhaps a long period of desolation to\nassuage, and she would not be prodigal of her resources. As she\nlooked around her while she walked, almost furtively, lest some\ngardener as he spied her might guess her thoughts and tell how my\nlady was revelling in her pride of possession,--it appeared to her\nthat those novelties in which she was to find her new interest were\nwithout end. There was not a tree there, not a shrub, not a turn in\nthe walks, which should not become her friend. She did not go far\nfrom the house, not even down to the water. She was husbanding her\nresources. But yet she lost herself amidst the paths, and tried to\nfind a joy in feeling that she had done so. It was all her own. It\nwas the price of what she had done; and the price was even now being\npaid into her hand,--paid with current coin and of full weight.\n\nAs she sat down alone to her breakfast, she declared to herself that\nthis should be enough for her,--that it should satisfy her. She had\nmade her bargain with her eyes open, and would not now ask for things\nwhich had not been stipulated in the contract. She was alone, and all\nthe world was turning its back on her. The relatives of her late\nhusband would, as a matter of course, be her enemies. Them she had\nnever seen, and that they should speak evil of her seemed to be only\nnatural. But her own relatives were removed from her by a gulf nearly\nequally wide. Of Brabazon cousins she had none nearer than the third\nor fourth degree of cousinship, and of them she had never taken heed,\nand expected no heed from them. Her set of friends would naturally\nhave been the same as her sister's, and would have been made up of\nthose she had known when she was one of Sir Hugh's family. But from\nSir Hugh she was divided now as widely as from the Ongar people,\nand,--for any purposes of society,--from her sister also. Sir Hugh\nhad allowed his wife to invite her to Clavering, but to this she\nwould not submit after Sir Hugh's treatment to her on her return.\nThough she had suffered much, her spirit was unbroken. Sir Hugh was,\nin truth, responsible for her reception in England. Had he come\nforward like a brother, all might have been well. But it was too late\nnow for Sir Hugh Clavering to remedy the evil he had done, and he\nshould be made to understand that Lady Ongar would not become a\nsuppliant to him for mercy. She was striving to think how \"rich she\nwas in horses, how rich in broidered garments and in gold,\" as she\nsat solitary over her breakfast; but her mind would run off to other\nthings, cumbering itself with unnecessary miseries and useless\nindignation. Had she not her price in her hand?\n\nWould she see the steward that morning? No,--not that morning. Things\noutside could go on for a while in their course as heretofore. She\nfeared to seem to take possession with pride, and then there was that\nconviction that it would be well to husband her resources. So she\nsent for Mrs. Button, and asked Mrs. Button to walk through the rooms\nwith her. Mrs. Button came, but again declined to accept her lady's\ncondescension. Every spot about the house, every room, closet, and\nwardrobe, she was ready to open with zeal; the furniture she was\nprepared to describe, if Lady Ongar would listen to her; but every\nword was spoken in a solemn voice, very far removed from gossiping.\nOnly once was Mrs. Button moved to betray any emotion. \"That, my\nlady, was my lord's mother's room, after my lord died,--my lord's\nfather that was; may God bless her.\" Then Lady Ongar reflected that\nfrom her husband she had never heard a word either of his father or\nhis mother. She wished that she could seat herself with that woman in\nsome small upstairs room, and then ask question after question about\nthe family. But she did not dare to make the attempt. She could not\nbring herself to explain to Mrs. Button that she had never known\nanything of the belongings of her own husband.\n\nWhen she had seen the upper part of the house, Mrs. Button offered to\nconvoy her through the kitchens and servants' apartments, but she\ndeclined this for the present. She had done enough for the day. So\nshe dismissed Mrs. Button, and took herself to the library. How often\nhad she heard that books afforded the surest consolation to the\ndesolate. She would take to reading; not on this special day, but as\nthe resource for many days and months, and years to come. But this\nidea had faded and become faint, before she had left the gloomy,\ndamp-feeling, chill room, in which some former Lord Ongar had stored\nthe musty volumes which he had thought fit to purchase. The library\ngave her no ease, so she went out again among the lawns and shrubs.\nFor some time to come her best resources must be those which she\ncould find outside the house.\n\nPeering about, she made her way behind the stables, which were\nattached to the house, to a farmyard gate, through which the way led\nto the head-quarters of the live-stock. She did not go through, but\nshe looked over the gate, telling herself that those barns and sheds,\nthat wealth of straw-yard, those sleeping pigs and idle dreaming\ncalves, were all her own. As she did so, her eye fell upon an old\nlabourer, who was sitting close to her, on a felled tree, under the\nshelter of a paling, eating his dinner. A little girl, some six years\nold, who had brought him his meal tied up in a handkerchief, was\ncrouching near his feet. They had both seen her before she had seen\nthem, and when she noticed them, were staring at her with all their\neyes. She and they were on the same side of the farmyard paling, and\nso she could reach them and speak to them without difficulty. There\nwas apparently no other person near enough to listen, and it occurred\nto her that she might at any rate make a friend of this old man. His\nname, he said, was Enoch Gubby, and the girl was his grandchild. Her\nname was Patty Gubby. Then Patty got up and had her head patted by\nher ladyship and received sixpence. They neither of them, however,\nknew who her ladyship was, and, as far as Lady Ongar could ascertain\nwithout a question too direct to be asked, had never heard of her.\nEnoch Gubby said he worked for Mr. Giles, the steward,--that was for\nmy lord, and as he was old and stiff with rheumatism he only got\neight shillings a week. He had a daughter, the mother of Patty, who\nworked in the fields, and got six shillings a week. Everything about\nthe poor Gubbys seemed to be very wretched and miserable. Sometimes\nhe could hardly drag himself about, he was so bad with the\nrheumatics. Then she thought that she would make one person happy,\nand told him that his wages should be raised to ten shillings a week.\nNo matter whether he earned it or not, or what Mr. Giles might say,\nhe should have ten shillings a week. Enoch Gubby bowed, and rubbed\nhis head, and stared, and was in truth thankful because of the\nsixpence in ready money; but he believed nothing about the ten\nshillings. He did not especially disbelieve, but simply felt\nconfident that he understood nothing that was said to him. That\nkindness was intended, and that the sixpence was there, he did\nunderstand.\n\n\n[Illustration: Was not the price in her hand?]\n\n\nBut Enoch Gubby got his weekly ten shillings, though Lady Ongar\nhardly realized the pleasure that she had expected from the\ntransaction. She sent that afternoon for Mr. Giles, the steward, and\ntold him what she had done. Mr. Giles did not at all approve, and\nspoke his disapproval very plainly, though he garnished his rebuke\nwith a great many \"my lady's.\" The old man was a hanger-on about the\nplace, and for years had received eight shillings a week, which he\nhad not half earned. \"Now he will have ten, that is all,\" said Lady\nOngar. Mr. Giles acknowledged that if her ladyship pleased, Enoch\nGubby must have the ten shillings, but declared that the business\ncould not be carried on in that way. Everybody about the place would\nexpect an addition, and those people who did earn what they received,\nwould think themselves cruelly used in being worse treated than Enoch\nGubby, who, according to Mr. Giles, was by no means the most worthy\nold man in the parish. And as for his daughter--oh! Mr. Giles could\nnot trust himself to talk about the daughter to her ladyship. Before\nhe left her, Lady Ongar was convinced that she had made a mistake.\nNot even from charity will pleasure come, if charity be taken up\nsimply to appease remorse.\n\nThe price was in her hand. For a fortnight the idea clung to her,\nthat gradually she would realize the joys of possession; but there\nwas no moment in which she could tell herself that the joy was hers.\nShe was now mistress of the geography of the place. There was no more\nlosing herself amidst the shrubberies, no thought of economizing her\nresources. Of Mr. Giles and his doings she still knew very little,\nbut the desire of knowing much had faded. The ownership of the\nhaystacks had become a thing tame to her, and the great cart-horses,\nas to every one of which she had intended to feel an interest, were\nmatters of indifference to her. She observed that since her arrival a\nnew name in new paint,--her own name,--was attached to the carts, and\nthat the letters were big and glaring. She wished that this had not\nbeen done, or, at any rate, that the letters had been smaller. Then\nshe began to think that it might be well for her to let the farm to\na tenant; not that she might thus get more money, but because she\nfelt that the farm would be a trouble. The apples had indeed quickly\nturned to ashes between her teeth!\n\nOn the first Sunday that she was at Ongar Park she went to the parish\nchurch. She had resolved strongly that she would do this, and she did\nit; but when the moment for starting came, her courage almost failed\nher. The church was but a few yards from her own gate, and she walked\nthere without any attendant. She had, however, sent word to the\nsexton to say that she would be there, and the old man was ready to\nshow her into the family pew. She wore a thick veil, and was dressed,\nof course, in all the deep ceremonious woe of widowhood. As she\nwalked up the centre of the church she thought of her dress, and told\nherself that all there would know how it had been between her and her\nhusband. She was pretending to mourn for the man to whom she had sold\nherself; for the man who through happy chance had died so quickly,\nleaving her with the price in her hand! All of course knew that, and\nall thought that they knew, moreover, that she had been foully false\nto her bargain, and had not earned the price! That, also, she told\nherself. But she went through it, and walked out of the church among\nthe village crowd with her head on high.\n\nThree days afterwards she wrote to the clergyman, asking him to call\non her. She had come, she said, to live in the parish, and hoped to\nbe able, with his assistance, to be of some use among the people.\nShe would hardly know how to act without some counsel from him. The\nschools might be all that was excellent, but if there was anything\nrequired she hoped he would tell her. On the following morning the\nclergyman called, and, with many thanks for her generosity, listened\nto her plans, and accepted her subsidies. But he was a married man,\nand he said nothing of his wife, nor during the next week did his\nwife come to call on her. She was to be left desolate by all, because\nmen had told lies of her!\n\nShe had the price in her hands, but she felt herself tempted to do as\nJudas did,--to go out and hang herself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA VISITOR CALLS AT ONGAR PARK.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nIt will be remembered that Harry Clavering, on returning one evening\nto his lodgings in Bloomsbury Square, had been much astonished at\nfinding there the card of Count Pateroff, a man of whom he had only\nheard, up to that moment, as the friend of the late Lord Ongar. At\nfirst he had been very angry with Lady Ongar, thinking that she and\nthis count were in some league together, some league of which he\nwould greatly disapprove; but his anger had given place to a new\ninterest when he learned direct from herself that she had not seen\nthe count, and that she was simply anxious that he, as her friend,\nshould have an interview with the man. He had then become very\neager in the matter, offering to subject himself to any amount of\ninconvenience so that he might effect that which Lady Ongar asked of\nhim. He was not, however, called upon to endure any special trouble\nor expense, as he heard nothing more from Count Pateroff till he had\nbeen back in London for two or three weeks.\n\nLady Ongar's statement to him had been quite true. It had been even\nmore than true; for when she had written she had not even heard\ndirectly from the count. She had learned by letter from another\nperson that Count Pateroff was in London, and had then communicated\nthe fact to her friend. This other person was a sister of the\ncount's, who was now living in London, one Madame Gordeloup,--Sophie\nGordeloup,--a lady whom Harry had found sitting in Lady Ongar's room\nwhen last he had seen her in Bolton Street. He had not then heard her\nname; nor was he aware then, or for some time subsequently, that\nCount Pateroff had any relative in London.\n\nLady Ongar had been a fortnight in the country before she received\nMadame Gordeloup's letter. In that letter the sister had declared\nherself to be most anxious that her brother should see Lady Ongar.\nThe letter had been in French, and had been very eloquent,--more\neloquent in its cause than any letter with the same object could have\nbeen if written by an Englishwoman in English; and the eloquence was\nless offensive than it might, under all concurrent circumstances,\nhave been had it reached Lady Ongar in English. The reader must not,\nhowever, suppose that the letter contained a word that was intended\nto support a lover's suit. It was very far indeed from that, and\nspoke of the count simply as a friend; but its eloquence went to show\nthat nothing that had passed should be construed by Lady Ongar as\noffering any bar to a fair friendship. What the world said!--Bah! Did\nnot she know,--she, Sophie,--and did not her friend know,--her friend\nJulie,--that the world was a great liar? Was it not even now telling\nwicked venomous lies about her friend Julie? Why mind what the world\nsaid, seeing that the world could not be brought to speak one word of\ntruth? The world indeed! Bah!\n\nBut Lady Ongar, though she was not as yet more than half as old as\nMadame Gordeloup, knew what she was about almost as well as that\nlady knew what Sophie Gordeloup was doing. Lady Ongar had known\nthe count's sister in France and Italy, having seen much of her\nin one of those sudden intimacies to which English people are\nsubject when abroad; and she had been glad to see Madame Gordeloup\nin London,--much more glad than she would have been had she been\nreceived there on her return by a crowd of loving native friends.\nBut not on that account was she prepared to shape her conduct in\naccordance with her friend Sophie's advice, and especially not\nso when that advice had reference to Sophie's brother. She had,\ntherefore, said very little in return to the lady's eloquence,\nanswering the letter on that matter very vaguely; but, having a\npurpose of her own, had begged that Count Pateroff might be asked to\ncall upon Harry Clavering. Count Pateroff did not feel himself to\ncare very much about Harry Clavering, but wishing to do as he was\nbidden, did leave his card in Bloomsbury Square.\n\nAnd why was Lady Ongar anxious that the young man who was her friend\nshould see the man who had been her husband's friend, and whose name\nhad been mixed with her own in so grievous a manner? She had called\nHarry her friend, and it might be that she desired to give this\nfriend every possible means of testing the truth of that story which\nshe herself had told. The reader, perhaps, will hardly have believed\nin Lady Ongar's friendship;--will, perhaps, have believed neither\nthe friendship nor the story. If so, the reader will have done her\nwrong, and will not have read her character aright. The woman was\nnot heartless because she had once, in one great epoch of her life,\nbetrayed her own heart; nor was she altogether false because she had\nonce lied; nor altogether vile, because she had once taught herself\nthat, for such an one as her, riches were a necessity. It might be\nthat the punishment of her sin could meet with no remission in this\nworld, but not on that account should it be presumed that there was\nno place for repentance left to her.\n\nAs she walked alone through the shrubberies at Ongar Park she thought\nmuch of those other paths at Clavering, and of the walks in which\nshe had not been alone; and she thought of that interview in the\ngarden when she had explained to Harry,--as she had then thought so\nsuccessfully,--that they two, each being poor, were not fit to love\nand marry each other. She had brooded over all that, too, during the\nlong hours of her sad journey home to England. She was thinking of\nit still when she had met him, and had been so cold to him on the\nplatform of the railway station, when she had sent him away angry\nbecause she had seemed to slight him. She had thought of it as she\nhad sat in her London room, telling him the terrible tale of her\nmarried life, while her eyes were fixed on his and her head was\nresting on her hands. Even then, at that moment, she was asking\nherself whether he believed her story, or whether, within his breast,\nhe was saying that she was vile and false. She knew that she had been\nfalse to him, and that he must have despised her when, with her easy\nphilosophy, she had made the best of her own mercenary perfidy. He\nhad called her a jilt to her face, and she had been able to receive\nthe accusation with a smile. Would he now call her something worse,\nand with a louder voice, within his own bosom? And if she could\nconvince him that to that accusation she was not fairly subject,\nmight the old thing come back again? Would he walk with her again,\nand look into her eyes as though he only wanted her commands to show\nhimself ready to be her slave? She was a widow, and had seen many\nthings, but even now she had not reached her six-and-twentieth year.\n\nThe apples at her rich country-seat had quickly become ashes between\nher teeth, but something of the juice of the fruit might yet reach\nher palate if he would come and sit with her at the table. As she\ncomplained to herself of the coldness of the world, she thought that\nshe would not care how cold might be all the world if there might be\nbut one whom she could love, and who would love her. And him she had\nloved. To him, in old days,--in days which now seemed to her to be\nvery old,--she had made confession of her love. Old as were those\ndays, it could not be but he should still remember them. She had\nloved him, and him only. To none other had she ever pretended love.\nFrom none other had love been offered to her. Between her and that\nwretched being to whom she had sold herself, who had been half dead\nbefore she had seen him, there had been no pretence of love. But\nHarry Clavering she had loved. Harry Clavering was a man, with all\nthose qualities which she valued, and also with those foibles which\nsaved him from being too perfect for so slight a creature as herself.\nHarry had been offended to the quick, and had called her a jilt; but\nyet it might be possible that he would return to her.\n\nIt should not be supposed that since her return to England she had\nhad one settled, definite object before her eyes with regard to\nthis renewal of her love. There had been times in which she had\nthought that she would go on with the life which she had prepared\nfor herself, and that she would make herself contented, if not happy,\nwith the price which had been paid to her. And there were other\ntimes, in which her spirits sank low within her, and she told herself\nthat no contentment was any longer possible to her. She looked at\nherself in the glass, and found herself to be old and haggard. Harry,\nshe said, was the last man in the world to sell himself for wealth,\nwhen there was no love remaining. Harry would never do as she\nhad done with herself! Not for all the wealth that woman ever\ninherited,--so she told herself,--would he link himself to one who\nhad made herself vile and tainted among women! In this, I think, she\ndid him no more than justice, though it may be that in some other\nmatters she rated his character too highly. Of Florence Burton she\nhad as yet heard nothing, though had she heard of her, it may well\nbe that she would not on that account have desisted. Such being her\nthoughts and her hopes, she had written to Harry, begging him to see\nthis man who had followed her,--she knew not why,--from Italy; and\nhad told the sister simply that she could not do as she was asked,\nbecause she was away from London, alone in a country house.\n\nAnd quite alone she was sitting one morning, counting up her misery,\nfeeling that the apples were, in truth, ashes, when a servant came to\nher, telling her that there was a gentleman in the hall desirous of\nseeing her. The man had the visitor's card in his hand, but before\nshe could read the name, the blood had mounted into her face as she\ntold herself that it was Harry Clavering. There was joy for a moment\nat her heart; but she must not show it,--not as yet. She had been\nbut four months a widow, and he should not have come to her in\nthe country. She must see him and in some way make him understand\nthis,--but she would be very gentle with him. Then her eye fell upon\nthe card, and she saw, with grievous disappointment, that it bore\nthe name of Count Pateroff. No;--she was not going to be caught in\nthat way. Let the result be what it might, she would not let Sophie\nGordeloup, or Sophie's brother, get the better of her by such a ruse\nas that! \"Tell the gentleman, with my compliments,\" she said, as she\nhanded back the card, \"that I regret it greatly, but I can see no\none now.\" Then the servant went away, and she sat wondering whether\nthe count would be able to make his way into her presence. She felt\nrather than knew that she had some reason to fear him. All that had\nbeen told of him and of her had been false. No accusation brought\nagainst her had contained one spark of truth. But there had been\nthings between Lord Ongar and this man which she would not care to\nhave told openly in England. And though, in his conduct to her,\nhe had been customarily courteous, and on one occasion had been\ngenerous, still she feared him. She would much rather that he should\nhave remained in Italy. And though, when all alone in Bolton Street,\nshe had in her desolation welcomed his sister Sophie, she would have\npreferred that Sophie should not have come to her, claiming to renew\ntheir friendship. But with the count she would hold no communion now,\neven though he should find his way into the room.\n\nA few minutes passed before the servant returned, and then he brought\na note with him. As the door opened Lady Ongar rose, ready to leave\nthe room by another passage; but she took the note and read it. It\nwas as follows:--\"I cannot understand why you should refuse to see\nme, and I feel aggrieved. My present purpose is to say a few words to\nyou on private matters connected with papers that belonged to Lord\nOngar. I still hope that you will admit me.--P.\" Having read these\nwords while standing, she made an effort to think what might be\nthe best course for her to follow. As for Lord Ongar's papers, she\ndid not believe in the plea. Lord Ongar could have had no papers\ninteresting to her in such a manner as to make her desirous of seeing\nthis man or of hearing of them in private. Lord Ongar, though she had\nnursed him to the hour of his death, earning her price, had been her\nbitterest enemy; and though there had been something about this count\nthat she had respected, she had known him to be a man of intrigue and\nafraid of no falsehoods in his intrigues,--a dangerous man, who might\nperhaps now and again do a generous thing, but one who would expect\npayment for his generosity. Besides, had he not been named openly\nas her lover? She wrote to him, therefore, as follows:--\"Lady Ongar\npresents her compliments to Count Pateroff, and finds it to be out\nof her power to see him at present.\" This answer the visitor took\nand walked away from the front door without showing any disgust\nto the servant, either by his demeanour or in his countenance. On\nthat evening she received from him a long letter, written at the\nneighbouring inn, expostulating with her as to her conduct towards\nhim, and saying in the last line, that it was \"impossible now that\nthey should be strangers to each other.\" \"Impossible that we should\nbe strangers,\" she said almost out loud. \"Why impossible? I know no\nsuch impossibility.\" After that she carefully burned both the letter\nand the note.\n\nShe remained at Ongar Park something over six weeks, and then, about\nthe beginning of May, she went back to London. No one had been to see\nher, except Mr. Sturm, the clergyman of the parish; and he, though\nsomething almost approaching to an intimacy had sprung up between\nthem, had never yet spoken to her of his wife. She was not quite\nsure whether her rank might not deter him,--whether under such\ncircumstances as those now in question, the ordinary social rules\nwere not ordinarily broken,--whether a countess should not call on a\nclergyman's wife first, although the countess might be the stranger;\nbut she did not dare to do as she would have done, had no blight\nattached itself to her name. She gave, therefore, no hint; she said\nno word of Mrs. Sturm, though her heart was longing for a kind word\nfrom some woman's mouth. But she allowed herself to feel no anger\nagainst the husband, and went through her parish work, thanking him\nfor his assistance.\n\nOf Mr. Giles she had seen very little, and since her misfortune with\nEnoch Gubby, she had made no further attempt to interfere with the\nwages of the persons employed. Into the houses of some of the poor\nshe had made her way, but she fancied that they were not glad to\nsee her. They might, perhaps, have all heard of her reputation,\nand Gubby's daughter may have congratulated herself that there was\nanother in the parish as bad as herself, or perhaps, happily, worse.\nThe owner of all the wealth around strove to make Mrs. Button become\na messenger of charity between herself and some of the poor; but Mrs.\nButton altogether declined the employment, although, as her mistress\nhad ascertained, she herself performed her own little missions of\ncharity with zeal. Before the fortnight was over, Lady Ongar was sick\nof her house and her park, utterly disregardful of her horses and\noxen, and unmindful even of the pleasant stream which in these spring\ndays rippled softly at the bottom of her gardens.\n\nShe had undertaken to be back in London early in May, by appointment\nwith her lawyer, and had unfortunately communicated the fact to\nMadame Gordeloup. Four or five days before she was due in Bolton\nStreet, her mindful Sophie, with unerring memory, wrote to her,\ndeclaring her readiness to do all and anything that the most diligent\nfriendship could prompt. Should she meet her dear Julie at the\nstation in London? Should she bring any special carriage? Should\nshe order any special dinner in Bolton Street? She herself would of\ncourse come to Bolton Street, if not allowed to be present at the\nstation. It was still chilly in the evenings, and she would have\nfires lit. Might she suggest a roast fowl and some bread sauce, and\nperhaps a sweetbread,--and just one glass of champagne? And might she\nshare the banquet? There was not a word in the note about the too\nobtrusive brother, either as to the offence committed by him, or the\noffence felt by him.\n\nThe little Franco-Polish woman was there in Bolton Street, of\ncourse,--for Lady Ongar had not dared to refuse her. A little, dry,\nbright woman she was, with quick eyes, and thin lips, and small nose,\nand mean forehead, and scanty hair drawn back quite tightly from her\nface and head; very dry, but still almost pretty with her quickness\nand her brightness. She was fifty, was Sophie Gordeloup, but she had\nso managed her years that she was as active on her limbs as most\nwomen are at twenty-five. And the chicken, and the bread-sauce, and\nthe sweetbread, and the champagne were there, all very good of their\nkind; for Sophie Gordeloup liked such things to be good, and knew how\nto indulge her own appetite, and to coax that of another person.\n\nSome little satisfaction Lady Ongar received from the fact that she\nwas not alone; but the satisfaction was not satisfactory. When Sophie\nhad left her at ten o'clock, running off by herself to her lodgings\nin Mount Street, Lady Ongar, after but one moment's thought, sat down\nand wrote a note to Harry Clavering.\n\n\n   DEAR HARRY,--I am back in town. Pray come and see me to-morrow\n   evening. Yours ever,\n\n   J. O.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nCOUNT PATEROFF AND HIS SISTER.\n\n\nAfter an interval of some weeks, during which Harry had been down\nat Clavering and had returned again to his work at the Adelphi,\nCount Pateroff called again in Bloomsbury Square;--but Harry was\nat Mr. Beilby's office. Harry at once returned the count's visit\nat the address given in Mount Street. Madame was at home, said the\nservant-girl, from which Harry was led to suppose that the count was\na married man; but Harry felt that he had no right to intrude upon\nmadame, so he simply left his card. Wishing, however, really to\nhave this interview, and having been lately elected at a club of\nwhich he was rather proud, he wrote to the count asking him to dine\nwith him at the Beaufort. He explained that there was a strangers'\nroom,--which Pateroff knew very well, having often dined at the\nBeaufort,--and said something as to a private little dinner for two,\nthereby apologizing for proposing to the count to dine without other\nguests. Pateroff accepted the invitation, and Harry, never having\ndone such a thing before, ordered his dinner with much nervousness.\n\nThe count was punctual, and the two men introduced themselves.\nHarry had expected to see a handsome foreigner, with black hair,\npolished whiskers, and probably a hook nose,--forty years of age or\nthereabouts, but so got up as to look not much more than thirty.\nBut his guest was by no means a man of that stamp. Excepting that\nthe count's age was altogether uncertain, no correctness of guess\non that matter being possible by means of his appearance, Harry's\npreconceived notion was wrong in every point. He was a fair man, with\na broad fair face, and very light blue eyes; his forehead was low,\nbut broad; he wore no whiskers, but bore on his lip a heavy moustache\nwhich was not grey, but perfectly white--white it was with years of\ncourse, but yet it gave no sign of age to his face. He was well made,\nactive, and somewhat broad in the shoulders, though rather below the\nmiddle height. But for a certain ease of manner which he possessed,\naccompanied by something of restlessness in his eye, any one would\nhave taken him for an Englishman. And his speech hardly betrayed that\nhe was not English. Harry, knowing that he was a foreigner, noticed\nnow and again some little acquired distinctness of speech which is\nhardly natural to a native; but otherwise there was nothing in his\ntongue to betray him.\n\n\"I am sorry that you should have had so much trouble,\" he said,\nshaking hands with Harry. Clavering declared that he had incurred no\ntrouble, and declared also that he would be only too happy to have\ntaken any trouble in obeying a behest from his friend Lady Ongar. Had\nhe been a Pole as was the count, he would not have forgotten to add\nthat he would have been equally willing to exert himself with the\nview of making the count's acquaintance; but being simply a young\nEnglishman, he was much too awkward for any such courtesy as that.\nThe count observed the omission, smiled, and bowed. Then he spoke of\nthe weather, and said that London was a magnificent city. Oh, yes,\nhe knew London well,--had known it these twenty years;--had been\nfor fifteen years a member of the Travellers';--he liked everything\nEnglish, except hunting. English hunting he had found to be dull\nwork. But he liked shooting for an hour or two. He could not rival,\nhe said, the intense energy of an Englishman, who would work all day\nwith his guns harder than ploughmen with their ploughs. Englishmen\nsported, he said, as though more than their bread,--as though their\nhonour, their wives, their souls, depended on it. It was very fine!\nHe often wished that he was an Englishman. Then he shrugged his\nshoulders.\n\nHarry was very anxious to commence a conversation about Lady Ongar,\nbut he did not know how at first to introduce her name. Count\nPateroff had come to him at Lady Ongar's request, and therefore, as\nhe thought, the count should have been the first to mention her. But\nthe count seemed to be enjoying his dinner without any thought either\nof Lady Ongar or of her late husband. At this time he had been down\nto Ongar Park, on that mission which had been, as we know, futile;\nbut he said no word of that to Harry. He seemed to enjoy his dinner\nthoroughly, and made himself very agreeable. When the wine was\ndiscussed he told Harry that a certain vintage of Moselle was very\nfamous at the Beaufort. Harry ordered the wine of course, and was\ndelighted to give his guest the best of everything; but he was a\nlittle annoyed at finding that the stranger knew his club better than\nhe knew it himself. Slowly the count ate his dinner, enjoying every\nmorsel that he took with that thoughtful, conscious pleasure which\nyoung men never attain in eating and drinking, and which men as they\ngrow older so often forget to acquire. But the count never forgot any\nof his own capacities for pleasure, and in all things made the most\nof his own resources. To be rich is not to have one or ten thousand a\nyear, but to be able to get out of that one or ten thousand all that\nevery pound, and every shilling, and every penny will give you. After\nthis fashion the count was a rich man.\n\n\"You don't sit after dinner here, I suppose,\" said the count, when\nhe had completed an elaborate washing of his mouth and moustache. \"I\nlike this club because we who are strangers have so charming a room\nfor our smoking. It is the best club in London for men who do not\nbelong to it.\"\n\nIt occurred to Harry that in the smoking-room there could be no\nprivacy. Three or four men had already spoken to the count, showing\nthat he was well known, giving notice, as it were, that Pateroff\nwould become a public man when once he was placed in a public circle.\nTo have given a dinner to the count, and to have spoken no word\nto him about Lady Ongar, would be by no means satisfactory to\nHarry's feelings, though, as it appeared, it might be sufficiently\nsatisfactory to the guest. Harry therefore suggested one bottle of\nclaret. The count agreed, expressing an opinion that the 51 Lafitte\nwas unexceptional. The 51 Lafitte was ordered, and Harry, as he\nfilled his glass, considered the way in which his subject should be\nintroduced.\n\n\"You knew Lord Ongar, I think, abroad?\"\n\n\"Lord Ongar,--abroad! Oh, yes, very well; and for many years here in\nLondon; and at Vienna; and very early in life at St. Petersburg. I\nknew Lord Ongar first in Russia when he was attached to the embassy\nas Frederic Courton. His father, Lord Courton, was then alive, as was\nalso his grandfather. He was a nice, good-looking lad then.\"\n\n\"As regards his being nice, he seems to have changed a good deal\nbefore he died.\" This the count noticed by simply shrugging his\nshoulders and smiling as he sipped his wine. \"By all that I can hear\nhe became a horrid brute when he married,\" said Harry, energetically.\n\n\"He was not pleasant when he was ill at Florence,\" said the count.\n\n\"She must have had a terrible time with him,\" said Harry.\n\nThe count put up his hands, again shrugged his shoulders, and then\nshook his head. \"She knew he was no longer an Adonis when he married\nher.\"\n\n\"An Adonis! No; she did not expect an Adonis; but she thought he\nwould have something of the honour and feelings of a man.\"\n\n\"She found it uncomfortable, no doubt. He did too much of this, you\nknow,\" said the count, raising his glass to his lips; \"and he didn't\ndo it with 51 Lafitte. That was Ongar's fault. All the world knew it\nfor the last ten years. No one knew it better than Hugh Clavering.\"\n\n\"But--\" said Harry, and then he stopped. He hardly knew what it was\nthat he wished to learn from the man, though he certainly did wish\nto learn something. He had thought that the count would himself have\ntalked about Lady Ongar and those Florentine days, but this he did\nnot seem disposed to do. \"Shall we have our cigars now?\" said Count\nPateroff.\n\n\"One moment, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly. There is no hurry.\"\n\n\"You will take no more wine?\"\n\n\"No more wine. I take my wine at dinner, as you saw.\"\n\n\"I want to ask you one special question,--about Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"I will say anything in her favour that you please. I am always ready\nto say anything in the favour of any lady, and, if needs be, to swear\nit. But anything against any lady nobody ever heard me say.\"\n\nHarry was sharp enough to perceive that any assertion made under\nsuch a stipulation was worse than nothing. It was as when a man, in\ndenying the truth of a statement, does so with an assurance that on\nthat subject he should consider himself justified in telling any\nnumber of lies. \"I did not write the book,--but you have no right to\nask the question; and I should say that I had not, even if I had.\"\nPateroff was speaking of Lady Ongar in this way, and Harry hated him\nfor doing so.\n\n\"I don't want you to say any good of her,\" said he, \"or any evil.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall say no evil of her.\"\n\n\"But I think you know that she has been most cruelly treated.\"\n\n\"Well, there is about seven--thousand--pounds a year, I think!\nSeven--thousand--a year! Not francs, but pounds! We poor foreigners\nlose ourselves in amazement when we hear about your English fortunes.\nSeven thousand pounds a year for a lady all alone, and a beau-tiful\nhouse! A house so beautiful, they tell me!\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it?\" said Harry; whereupon the count again\nshrugged his shoulders. \"What has that to do with it? Because the man\nwas rich he was not justified in ill-treating his wife. Did he not\nbring false accusations against her, in order that he might rob her\nafter his death of all that of which you think so much? Did he not\nbear false witness against her, to his own dishonour?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Did he not bear false witness against her?\"]\n\n\n\"She has got the money, I think,--and the beautiful house.\"\n\n\"But her name has been covered with lies.\"\n\n\"What can I do? Why do you ask me? I know nothing. Look here, Mr.\nClavering, if you want to make any inquiry you had better go to my\nsister. I don't see what good it will do, but she will talk to you by\nthe hour together, if you wish it. Let us smoke.\"\n\n\"Your sister?\"\n\n\"Yes, my sister. Madame Gordeloup is her name. Has not Lady Ongar\nmentioned my sister? They are inseparables. My sister lives in Mount\nStreet.\"\n\n\"With you?\"\n\n\"No, not with me; I do not live in Mount Street. I have my address\nsometimes at her house.\"\n\n\"Madame Gordeloup?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame Gordeloup. She is Lady Ongar's friend. She will talk to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Will you introduce me, Count Pateroff?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; it is not necessary. You can go to Mount Street, and she\nwill be delighted. There is the card. And now we will smoke.\" Harry\nfelt that he could not, with good-breeding, detain the count any\nlonger, and, therefore, rising from his chair, led the way into the\nsmoking-room. When there, the man of the world separated himself from\nhis young friend, of whose enthusiasm he had perhaps had enough, and\nwas soon engaged in conversation with sundry other men of his own\nstanding. Harry soon perceived that his guest had no further need\nof his countenance, and went home to Bloomsbury Square by no means\nsatisfied with his new acquaintance.\n\nOn the next day he dined in Onslow Crescent with the Burtons, and\nwhen there he said nothing about Lady Ongar or Count Pateroff. He\nwas not aware that he had any special reason for being silent on the\nsubject, but he made up his mind that the Burtons were people so far\nremoved in their sphere of life from Lady Ongar, that the subject\nwould not be suitable in Onslow Crescent. It was his lot in life to\nbe concerned with people of the two classes. He did not at all mean\nto say,--even to himself,--that he liked the Ongar class the better;\nbut still, as such was his lot, he must take it as it came, and\nentertain both subjects of interest, without any commingling of them\none with another. Of Lady Ongar and his early love he had spoken to\nFlorence at some length, but he did not find it necessary in his\nletters to tell her anything of Count Pateroff and his dinner at the\nBeaufort. Nor did he mention the dinner to his dear friend Cecilia.\nOn this occasion he made himself very happy in Onslow Crescent,\nplaying with the children, chatting with his friend, and enduring,\nwith a good grace, Theodore Burton's sarcasm, when that ever-studious\ngentleman told him that he was only fit to go about tied to a woman's\napron-string.\n\nOn the following day, about five o'clock, he called in Mount Street.\nHe had doubted much as to this, thinking that at any rate he ought,\nin the first place, to write and ask permission. But at last he\nresolved that he would take the count at his word, and presenting\nhimself at the door, he sent up his name. Madame Gordeloup was at\nhome, and in a few moments he found himself in the room in which the\nlady was sitting, and recognized her whom he had seen with Lady Ongar\nin Bolton Street. She got up at once, having glanced at the name upon\nthe card, and seemed to know all about him. She shook hands with him\ncordially, almost squeezing his hand, and bade him sit down near\nher on the sofa. \"She was so glad to see him, for her dear Julie's\nsake. Julie, as of course he knew, was at 'Ongere' Park. Oh! so\nhappy,\"--which, by the by, he did not know,--\"and would be up in the\ncourse of next week. So many things to do, of course, Mr. Clavering.\nThe house, and the servants, and the park, and the beautiful things\nof a large country establishment! But it was delightful, and Julie\nwas quite happy!\"\n\nNo people could be more unlike to each other than this brother and\nhis sister. No human being could have taken Madame Gordeloup for an\nEnglishwoman, though it might be difficult to judge, either from her\nlanguage or her appearance, of the nationality to which she belonged.\nShe spoke English with great fluency, but every word uttered declared\nher not to be English. And when she was most fluent she was most\nincorrect in her language. She was small, eager, and quick, and\nappeared quite as anxious to talk as her brother had been to hold\nhis tongue. She lived in a small room on the first floor of a small\nhouse; and it seemed to Harry that she lived alone. But he had\nnot been long there before she had told him all her history, and\nexplained to him most of her circumstances. That she kept back\nsomething is probable; but how many are there who can afford to tell\neverything?\n\nHer husband was still living, but he was at St. Petersburg. He was\na Frenchman by family, but had been born in Russia. He had been\nattached to the Russian embassy in London, but was now attached to\ndiplomacy in general in Russia. She did not join him because she\nloved England,--oh, so much! And, perhaps, her husband might come\nback again some day. She did not say that she had not seen him for\nten years, and was not quite sure whether he was dead or alive; but\nhad she made a clean breast in all things, she might have done so.\nShe said that she was a good deal still at the Russian embassy; but\nshe did not say that she herself was a paid spy. Nor do I say so now,\npositively; but that was the character given to her by many who knew\nher. She called her brother Edouard, as though Harry had known the\ncount all his life; and always spoke of Lady Ongar as Julie. She\nuttered one or two little hints which seemed to imply that she knew\neverything that had passed between \"Julie\" and Harry Clavering in\nearly days; and never mentioned Lord Ongar without some term of\nviolent abuse.\n\n\"Horrid wretch!\" she said, pausing over all the _r's_ in the name she\nhad called him. \"It began, you know, from the very first. Of course\nhe had been a fool. An old rou\u00c3\u00a9 is always a fool to marry. What does\nhe get, you know, for his money? A pretty face. He's tired of that\nas soon as it's his own. Is it not so, Mr. Clavering? But other\npeople ain't tired of it, and then he becomes jealous. But Lord Ongar\nwas not jealous. He was not man enough to be jealous. Hor-r-rid\nwr-retch!\" She then went on telling many things which, as he\nlistened, almost made Harry Clavering's hair stand on end, and which\nmust not be repeated here. She herself had met her brother in Paris,\nand had been with him when they encountered the Ongars in that\ncapital. According to her showing, they had, all of them, been\ntogether nearly from that time to the day of Lord Ongar's death. But\nHarry soon learned to feel that he could not believe all that the\nlittle lady told him.\n\n\"Edouard was always with him. Poor Edouard!\" she said. \"There was\nsome money matter between them about \u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9. When that wr-retch got\nto be so bad, he did not like parting with his money,--not even when\nhe had lost it! And Julie had been so good always! Julie and Edouard\nhad done everything for the nasty wr-retch.\" Harry did not at all\nlike this mingling of the name of Julie and Edouard, though it did\nnot for a moment fill his mind with any suspicion as to Lady Ongar.\nIt made him feel, however, that this woman was dangerous, and that\nher tongue might be very mischievous if she talked to others as she\ndid to him. As he looked at her,--and being now in her own room she\nwas not dressed with scrupulous care,--and as he listened to her, he\ncould not conceive what Lady Ongar had seen in her that she should\nhave made a friend of her. Her brother, the count, was undoubtedly\na gentleman in his manners and way of life, but he did not know by\nwhat name to call this woman, who called Lady Ongar Julie. She was\naltogether unlike any ladies whom he had known.\n\n\"You know that Julie will be in town next week?\"\n\n\"No; I did not know when she was to return.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; she has business with those people in South Audley Street\non Thursday. Poor dear! Those lawyers are so harassing! But when\npeople have seven--thousand--pounds a year, they must put up with\nlawyers.\" As she pronounced those talismanic words, which to her were\nalmost celestial, Harry perceived for the first time that there was\nsome sort of resemblance between her and the count. He could see that\nthey were brother and sister. \"I shall go to her directly she comes,\nand of course I will tell her how good you have been to come to\nme. And Edouard has been dining with you? How good of you. He told\nme how charming you are,\"--Harry was quite sure then that she was\nfibbing,--\"and that it was so pleasant! Edouard is very much attached\nto Julie; very much. Though, of course, all that was mere nonsense;\njust lies told by that wicked lord. Bah! what did he know?\" Harry by\nthis time was beginning to wish that he had never found his way to\nMount Street.\n\n\"Of course they were lies,\" he said roughly.\n\n\"Of course, mon cher. Those things always are lies, and so wicked!\nWhat good do they do?\"\n\n\"Lies never do any good,\" said Harry.\n\nTo so wide a proposition as this madame was not prepared to give an\nunconditional assent; she therefore shrugged her shoulders and once\nagain looked like her brother.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said. \"Julie is a happy woman now. Seven--thousand--pounds\na year! One does not know how to believe it; does one?\"\n\n\"I never heard the amount of her income,\" said Harry.\n\n\"It is all that,\" said the Franco-Pole, energetically, \"every franc\nof it, besides the house! I know it. She told me herself. Yes. What\nwoman would risk that, you know; and his life, you may say, as good\nas gone? Of course they were lies.\"\n\n\"I don't think you understand her, Madame Gordeloup.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I know her, so well. And love her--oh, Mr. Clavering, I\nlove her so dearly! Is she not charming? So beautiful you know, and\ngrand. Such a will, too! That is what I like in a woman. Such a\ncourage! She never flinched in those horrid days, never. And when he\ncalled her,--you know what,--she only looked at him, just looked at\nhim, miserable object. Oh, it was beautiful!\" And Madame Gordeloup,\nrising in her energy from her seat for the purpose, strove to throw\nupon Harry such another glance as the injured, insulted wife had\nthrown upon her foul-tongued, dying lord.\n\n\"She will marry,\" said Madame Gordeloup, changing her tone with a\nsuddenness that made Harry start; \"yes, she will marry of course.\nYour English widows always marry if they have money. They are wrong,\nand she will be wrong; but she will marry.\"\n\n\"I do not know how that may be,\" said Harry, looking foolish.\n\n\"I tell you I know she will marry, Mr. Clavering; I told Edouard so\nyesterday. He merely smiled. It would hardly do for him, she has so\nmuch will. Edouard has a will also.\"\n\n\"All men have, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; but there is a difference. A sum of money down, if a man is\nto marry, is better than a widow's dower. If she dies, you know, he\nlooks so foolish. And she is grand and will want to spend everything.\nIs she much older than you, Mr. Clavering? Of course I know Julie's\nage, though perhaps you do not. What will you give me to tell?\" And\nthe woman leered at him with a smile which made Harry think that she\nwas almost more than mortal. He found himself quite unable to cope\nwith her in conversation, and soon after this got up to take his\nleave. \"You will come again,\" she said. \"Do. I like you so much. And\nwhen Julie is in town, we shall be able to see her together, and I\nwill be your friend. Believe me.\"\n\nHarry was very far from believing her, and did not in the least\nrequire her friendship. Her friendship indeed! How could any decent\nEnglish man or woman wish for the friendship of such a creature as\nthat? It was thus that he thought of her as he walked away from Mount\nStreet, making heavy accusations, within his own breast, against Lady\nOngar as he did so. Julia! He repeated the name over to himself a\ndozen times, thinking that the flavour of it was lost since it had\nbeen contaminated so often by that vile tongue. But what concern was\nit of his? Let her be Julia to whom she would, she could never be\nJulia again to him. But she was his friend--Lady Ongar, and he told\nhimself plainly that his friend had been wrong in having permitted\nherself to hold any intimacy with such a woman as that. No doubt Lady\nOngar had been subjected to very trying troubles in the last months\nof her husband's life, but no circumstances could justify her, if she\ncontinued to endorse the false cordiality of that horribly vulgar\nand evil-minded little woman. As regarded the grave charges brought\nagainst Lady Ongar, Harry still gave no credit to them, still looked\nupon them as calumnies, in spite of the damning advocacy of Sophie\nand her brother; but he felt that she must have dabbled in very\ndirty water to have returned to England with such claimants on her\nfriendship as these. He had not much admired the count, but the\ncount's sister had been odious to him. \"I will be your friend.\nBelieve me.\" Harry Clavering stamped upon the pavement as he\nthought of the little Pole's offer to him. She be his friend! No,\nindeed;--not if there were no other friend for him in all London.\n\nSophie, too, had her thoughts about him. Sophie was very anxious\nin this matter, and was resolved to stick as close to her Julie as\npossible. \"I will be his friend or his enemy;--let him choose.\" That\nhad been Sophie's reflection on the matter when she was left alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nAN EVENING IN BOLTON STREET.\n\n\nTen days after his visit in Mount Street, Harry received the note\nwhich Lady Ongar had written to him on the night of her arrival in\nLondon. It was brought to Mr. Beilby's office by her own footman\nearly in the morning; but Harry was there at the time, and was thus\nable to answer it, telling Lady Ongar that he would come as she had\ndesired. She had commenced her letter \"Dear Harry,\" and he well\nremembered that when she had before written she had called him \"Dear\nMr. Clavering.\" And though the note contained only half-a-dozen\nordinary words, it seemed to him to be affectionate, and almost\nloving. Had she not been eager to see him, she would hardly thus have\nwritten to him on the very instant of her return. \"Dear Lady Ongar,\"\nhe wrote, \"I shall dine at my club, and be with you about eight.\nYours always, H. C.\" After that he could hardly bring himself to work\nsatisfactorily during the whole day. Since his interview with the\nFranco-Polish lady he had thought a good deal about himself, and had\nresolved to work harder and to love Florence Burton more devotedly\nthan ever. The nasty little woman had said certain words to him\nwhich had caused him to look into his own breast and to tell himself\nthat this was necessary. As the love was easier than the work, he\nbegan his new tasks on the following morning by writing a long and\nvery affectionate letter to his own Flo, who was still staying\nat Clavering rectory;--a letter so long and so affectionate that\nFlorence, in her ecstasy of delight, made Fanny read it, and confess\nthat, as a love-letter, it was perfect.\n\n\"It's great nonsense, all the same,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"It isn't nonsense at all,\" said Florence; \"and if it were, it would\nnot signify. Is it true? That's the question.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's true,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"And so am I,\" said Florence. \"I don't want any one to tell me that.\"\n\n\"Then why did you ask, you simpleton?\" Florence indeed was having\na happy time of it at Clavering rectory. When Fanny called her a\nsimpleton, she threw her arms round Fanny's neck and kissed her.\n\nAnd Harry kept his resolve about the work too, investigating plans\nwith a resolution to understand them which was almost successful.\nDuring those days he would remain at his office till past four\no'clock, and would then walk away with Theodore Burton, dining\nsometimes in Onslow Crescent, and going there sometimes in the\nevening after dinner. And when there he would sit and read; and\nonce when Cecilia essayed to talk to him, he told her to keep her\napron-strings to herself. Then Theodore laughed and apologized,\nand Cecilia said that too much work made Jack a dull boy; and then\nTheodore laughed again, stretching out his legs and arms as he\nrested a moment from his own study, and declared that, under those\ncircumstances, Harry never would be dull. And Harry, on those\nevenings, would be taken upstairs to see the bairns in their cots;\nand as he stood with their mother looking down upon the children,\npretty words would be said about Florence and his future life; and\nall was going merry as a marriage bell. But on that morning, when\nthe note had come from Lady Ongar, Harry could work no more to his\nsatisfaction. He scrawled upon his blotting-paper, and made no\nprogress whatsoever towards the understanding of anything. It was\nthe day on which, in due course, he would write to Florence; and he\ndid write to her. But Florence did not show this letter to Fanny,\nclaiming for it any meed of godlike perfection. It was a stupid,\nshort letter, in which he declared that he was very busy, and that\nhis head ached. In a postscript he told her that he was going to see\nLady Ongar that evening. This he communicated to her under an idea\nthat by doing so he made everything right. And I think that the\ntelling of it did relieve his conscience.\n\nHe left the office soon after three, having brought himself to\nbelieve in the headache, and sauntered down to his club. He found men\nplaying whist there, and, as whist might be good for his head, he\njoined them. They won his money, and scolded him for playing badly\ntill he was angry, and then he went out for a walk by himself. As he\nwent along Piccadilly, he saw Sophie Gordeloup coming towards him,\ntrotting along, with her dress held well up over her ankles, eager,\nquick, and, as he said to himself, clearly intent upon some mischief.\nHe endeavoured to avoid her by turning up the Burlington Arcade, but\nshe was too quick for him, and was walking up the arcade by his side\nbefore he had been able to make up his mind as to the best mode of\nridding himself of such a companion.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Clavering, I am so glad to see you. I was with Julie last\nnight. She was fagged, very much fagged; the journey, you know, and\nthe business. But yet so handsome! And we talked of you. Yes, Mr.\nClavering; and I told her how good you had been in coming to me. She\nsaid you were always good; yes, she did. When shall you see her?\"\n\nHarry Clavering was a bad hand at fibbing, and a bad hand also at\nleaving a question unanswered. When questioned in this way he did not\nknow what to do but to answer the truth. He would much rather not\nhave said that he was going to Bolton Street that evening, but he\ncould find no alternative. \"I believe I shall see her this evening,\"\nhe said, simply venturing to mitigate the evil of making the\ncommunication by rendering it falsely doubtful. There are men who fib\nwith so bad a grace and with so little tact that they might as well\nnot fib at all. They not only never arrive at success, but never even\nventure to expect it.\n\n\"Ah, this evening. Let me see. I don't think I can be there to-night;\nMadame Berenstoff receives at the embassy.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Harry, turning into Truefit's, the\nhairdresser's, shop.\n\n\"Ah, very well,\" said Sophie to herself; \"just so. It will be better,\nmuch better. He is simply one lout, and why should he have it all? My\nGod, what fools, what louts, are these Englishmen!\" Now having read\nSophie's thoughts so far, we will leave her to walk up the remainder\nof the arcade by herself.\n\nI do not know that Harry's visit to Truefit's establishment had been\nin any degree caused by his engagement for the evening. I fancy that\nhe had simply taken to ground at the first hole, as does a hunted\nfox. But now that he was there he had his head put in order, and\nthought that he looked the better for the operation. He then went\nback to his club, and when he sauntered into the card-room one old\ngentleman looked askance at him, as though inquiring angrily whether\nhe had come there to make fresh misery. \"Thank you; no,--I won't play\nagain,\" said Harry. Then the old gentleman was appeased, and offered\nhim a pinch of snuff. \"Have you seen the new book about whist?\" said\nthe old gentleman. \"It is very useful,--very useful. I'll send you a\ncopy if you will allow me.\" Then Harry left the room, and went down\nto dinner.\n\nIt was a little past eight when he knocked at Lady Ongar's door.\nI fear he had calculated that if he were punctual to the moment,\nshe would think that he thought the matter to be important. It was\nimportant to him, and he was willing that she should know that it was\nso. But there are degrees in everything, and therefore he was twenty\nminutes late. He was not the first man who has weighed the diplomatic\nadvantage of being after his time. But all those ideas went from him\nat once when she met him almost at the door of the room, and, taking\nhim by the hand, said that she was \"so glad to see him,--so very\nglad. Fancy, Harry, I haven't seen an old friend since I saw you\nlast. You don't know how hard all that seems.\"\n\n\"It is hard,\" said he; and when he felt the pressure of her hand, and\nsaw the brightness of her eye, and when her dress rustled against\nhim as he followed her to her seat, and he became sensible of the\ninfluence of her presence, all his diplomacy vanished, and he was\nsimply desirous of devoting himself to her service. Of course,\nany such devotion was to be given without detriment to that other\ndevotion which he owed to Florence Burton. But this stipulation,\nthough it was made, was made quickly, and with a confused brain.\n\n\"Yes,--it is hard,\" she said. \"Harry, sometimes I think I shall go\nmad. It is more than I can bear. I could bear it if it hadn't been my\nown fault,--all my own fault.\"\n\nThere was a suddenness about this which took him quite by surprise.\nNo doubt it had been her own fault. He also had told himself that;\nthough, of course, he would make no such charge to her. \"You have not\nrecovered yet,\" he said, \"from what you have suffered lately. Things\nwill look brighter to you after a while.\"\n\n\"Will they? Ah,--I do not know. But come, Harry; come and sit down,\nand let me get you some tea. There is no harm, I suppose, in having\nyou here,--is there?\"\n\n\"Harm, Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"Yes,--harm, Lady Ongar.\" As she repeated her own name after him,\nnearly in his tone, she smiled once again; and then she looked as she\nused to look in the old days, when she would be merry with him. \"It\nis hard to know what a woman may do, and what she may not. When my\nhusband was ill and dying, I never left his bedside. From the moment\nof my marrying him till his death, I hardly spoke to a man but in his\npresence; and when once I did, it was he that had sent him. And for\nall that people have turned their backs upon me. You and I were old\nfriends, Harry, and something more once,--were we not? But I jilted\nyou, as you were man enough to tell me. How I did respect you when\nyou dared to speak the truth to me. Men don't know women, or they\nwould be harder to them.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to be hard to you.\"\n\n\"If you had taken me by the shoulders and shaken me, and have\ndeclared that before God you would not allow such wickedness, I\nshould have obeyed you. I know I should.\" Harry thought of Florence,\nand could not bring himself to say that he wished it had been so.\n\"But where would you have been then, Harry? I was wrong and false and\na beast to marry that man; but I should not, therefore, have been\nright to marry you and ruin you. It would have been ruin, you know,\nand we should simply have been fools.\"\n\n\"The folly was very pleasant,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I will not deny that. But then the wisdom and the prudence\nafterwards! Oh, Harry, that was not pleasant. That was not pleasant!\nBut what was I saying? Oh! about the propriety of your being here. It\nis so hard to know what is proper. As I have been married, I suppose\nI may receive whom I please. Is not that the law?\"\n\n\"You may receive me, I should think. Your sister is my cousin's\nwife.\" Harry's matter-of-fact argument did as well as anything else,\nfor it turned her thought at the moment.\n\n\"My sister, Harry! If there was nothing to make us friends but our\nconnection through Sir Hugh Clavering, I do not know that I should be\nparticularly anxious to see you. How unmanly he has been, and how\ncruel.\"\n\n\"Very cruel,\" said Harry. Then he thought of Archie and Archie's\nsuit. \"But he is willing to change all that now. Hermione asked me\nthe other day to persuade you to go to Clavering.\"\n\n\"And have you come here to use your eloquence for that purpose? I\nwill never go to Clavering again, Harry, unless it should be yours\nand your wife should offer to receive me. Then I'd pack up for the\ndear, dull, solemn old place though I was on the other side of\nEurope.\"\n\n\"It will never be mine.\"\n\n\"Probably not, and probably, therefore, I shall never be there again.\nNo; I can forgive an injury, but not an insult,--not an insult such\nas that. I will not go to Clavering; so, Harry, you may save your\neloquence. Hermione I shall be glad to see whenever she will come\nto me. If you can persuade her to that, you will persuade her to a\ncharity.\"\n\n\"She goes nowhere, I think, without his--his--\"\n\n\"Without his permission. Of course she does not. That, I suppose, is\nall as it should be. And he is such a tyrant that he will give no\nsuch permission. He would tell her, I suppose, that her sister was no\nfit companion for her.\"\n\n\"He could not say that now, as he has asked you there.\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't know that. He would say one thing first and another\nafter, just as it would suit him. He has some object in wishing\nthat I should go there, I suppose.\" Harry, who knew the object, and\nwho was too faithful to betray Lady Clavering, even though he was\naltogether hostile to his cousin Archie's suit, felt a little proud\nof his position, but said nothing in answer to this. \"But I shall\nnot go; nor will I see him, or go to his house when he comes up to\nLondon. When do they come, Harry?\"\n\n\"He is in town now.\"\n\n\"What a nice husband, is he not? And when does Hermione come?\"\n\n\"I do not know; she did not say. Little Hughy is ill, and that may\nkeep her.\"\n\n\"After all, Harry, I may have to pack up and go to Clavering even\nyet,--that is, if the mistress of the house will have me.\"\n\n\"Never in the way you mean, Lady Ongar. Do not propose to kill all my\nrelations in order that I might have their property. Archie intends\nto marry, and have a dozen children.\"\n\n\"Archie marry! Who will have him? But such men as he are often in the\nway by marrying some cookmaid at last. Archie is Hugh's body-slave.\nFancy being body-slave to Hugh Clavering! He has two, and poor Hermy\nis the other; only he prefers not to have Hermy near him, which is\nlucky for her. Here is some tea. Let us sit down and be comfortable,\nand talk no more about our horrid relations. I don't know what made\nme speak of them. I did not mean it.\"\n\nHarry sat down and took the cup from her hand, as she had bidden the\nservant to leave the tray upon the table.\n\n\"So you saw Count Pateroff,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, and his sister.\"\n\n\"So she told me. What do you think of them?\" To this question Harry\nmade no immediate answer. \"You may speak out. Though I lived abroad\nwith such as them for twelve months, I have not forgotten the sweet\nscent of our English hedgerows, nor the wholesomeness of English\nhousehold manners. What do you think of them?\"\n\n\"They are not sweet or wholesome,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, Harry, you are so honest! Your honesty is beautiful. A spade\nwill ever be a spade with you.\"\n\nHe thought that she was laughing at him, and coloured.\n\n\"You pressed me to speak,\" he said, \"and I did but use your own\nwords.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you used them with such straightforward violence! Well, you\nshall use what words you please, and how you please, because a word\nof truth is so pleasant after living in a world of lies. I know you\nwill not lie to me, Harry. You never did.\"\n\nHe felt that now was the moment in which he should tell her of his\nengagement, but he let the moment pass without using it. And, indeed,\nit would have been hard for him to tell. In telling such a story he\nwould have been cautioning her that it was useless for her to love\nhim,--and this he could not bring himself to do. And he was not sure\neven now that she had not learned the fact from her sister. \"I hope\nnot,\" he said. In all that he was saying he knew that his words were\ntame and impotent in comparison with hers, which seemed to him to\nmean so much. But then his position was so unfortunate! Had it not\nbeen for Florence Burton he would have been long since at her feet;\nfor, to give Harry Clavering his due, he could be quick enough at\nswearing to a passion. He was one of those men to whom love-making\ncomes so readily that it is a pity that they should ever marry. He\nwas ever making love to women, usually meaning no harm. He made\nlove to Cecilia Burton over her children's beds, and that discreet\nmatron liked it. But it was a love-making without danger. It simply\nsignified on his part the pleasure he had in being on good terms with\na pretty woman. He would have liked to have made love in the same\nway to Lady Ongar; but that was impossible, and in all love-making\nwith Lady Ongar there must be danger. There was a pause after the\nexpression of his last hopes, during which he finished his tea, and\nthen looked at his boots.\n\n\"You do not ask me what I have been doing at my country-house.\"\n\n\"And what have you been doing there?\"\n\n\"Hating it.\"\n\n\"That is wrong.\"\n\n\"Everything is wrong that I do; everything must be wrong. That is the\nnature of the curse upon me.\"\n\n\"You think too much of all that now.\"\n\n\"Ah, Harry, that is so easily said. People do not think of such\nthings if they can help themselves. The place is full of him and his\nmemories; full of him, though I do not as yet know whether he ever\nput his foot in it. Do you know, I have a plan, a scheme, which\nwould, I think, make me happy for one half-hour. It is to give\neverything back to the family. Everything! money, house, and name;\nto call myself Julia Brabazon, and let the world call me what it\npleases. Then I would walk out into the streets, and beg some one\nto give me my bread. Is there one in all the wide world that would\ngive me a crust? Is there one, except yourself, Harry--one, except\nyourself?\"\n\nPoor Florence! I fear it fared badly with her cause at this moment.\nHow was it possible that he should not regret, that he should not\nlook back upon Stratton with something akin to sorrow? Julia had been\nhis first love, and to her he could have been always true. I fear he\nthought of this now. I fear that it was a grief to him that he could\nnot place himself close at her side, bid her do as she had planned,\nand then come to him, and share all his crusts. Had it been open to\nhim to play that part, he would have played it well, and would have\ngloried in the thoughts of her poverty. The position would have\nsuited him exactly. But Florence was in the way, and he could not do\nit. How was he to answer Lady Ongar? It was more difficult now than\never to tell her of Florence Burton.\n\nHis eyes were full of tears, and she accepted that as his excuse for\nnot answering her. \"I suppose they would say that I was a romantic\nfool. When the price has been taken one cannot cleanse oneself of the\nstain. With Judas, you know, it was not sufficient that he gave back\nthe money. Life was too heavy for him, and so he went out and hanged\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Julia,\" he said, getting up from his chair, and going over to where\nshe sat on a sofa, \"Julia, it is horrid to hear you speak of yourself\nin that way. I will not have it. You are not such a one as the\nIscariot.\" And as he spoke to her, he found her hand in his.\n\n\"I wish you had my burden, Harry, for one half day, so that you might\nknow its weight.\"\n\n\"I wish I could bear it for you--for life.\"\n\n\"To be always alone, Harry; to have none that come to me and scold\nme, and love me, and sometimes make me smile! You will scold me at\nany rate; will you not? It is terrible to have no one near one that\nwill speak to one with the old easiness of familiar affection. And\nthen the pretence of it where it does not, cannot, could not, exist!\nOh, that woman, Harry;--that woman who comes here and calls me Julie!\nAnd she has got me to promise too that I would call her Sophie! I\nknow that you despise me because she comes here. Yes; I can see it.\nYou said at once that she was not wholesome, with your dear outspoken\nhonesty.\"\n\n\"It was your word.\"\n\n\"And she is not wholesome, whosever word it was. She was there,\nhanging about him when he was so bad, before the worst came. She read\nnovels to him,--books that I never saw, and played \u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9 with him\nfor what she called gloves. I believe in my heart she was spying me,\nand I let her come and go as she would, because I would not seem to\nbe afraid of her. So it grew. And once or twice she was useful to\nme. A woman, Harry, wants to have a woman near her sometimes,--even\nthough it be such an unwholesome creature as Sophie Gordeloup. You\nmust not think too badly of me on her account.\"\n\n\"I will not;--I will not think badly of you at all.\"\n\n\"He is better, is he not? I know little of him or nothing, but he has\na more reputable outside than she has. Indeed I liked him. He had\nknown Lord Ongar well; and though he did not toady him nor was afraid\nof him, yet he was gentle and considerate. Once to me he said words\nthat I was called on to resent;--but he never repeated them, and I\nknow that he was prompted by him who should have protected me. It is\ntoo bad, Harry, is it not? Too bad almost to be believed by such as\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is very bad,\" said Harry.\n\n\"After that he was always courteous; and when the end came and things\nwere very terrible, he behaved well and kindly. He went in and out\nquietly, and like an old friend. He paid for everything, and was\nuseful. I know that even this made people talk;--yes, Harry, even at\nsuch a moment as that! But in spite of the talking I did better with\nhim then than I could have done without him.\"\n\n\"He looks like a man who could be kind if he chooses.\"\n\n\"He is one of those, Harry, who find it easy to be good-natured,\nand who are soft by nature, as cats are,--not from their heart, but\nthrough instinctive propensity to softness. When it suits them,\nthey scratch, even though they have been ever so soft before. Count\nPateroff is a cat. You, Harry, I think are a dog.\" She perhaps\nexpected that he would promise to her that he would be her dog,--a\ndog in constancy and affection; but he was still mindful in part of\nFlorence, and restrained himself.\n\n\"I must tell you something further,\" she said. \"And indeed it is this\nthat I particularly want to tell you. I have not seen him, you know,\nsince I parted with him at Florence.\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" said Harry.\n\n\"I thought I had told you. However, so it is. And now, listen:--He\ncame down to Ongar Park the other day while I was there, and sent\nin his card. When I refused to receive him, he wrote to me pressing\nhis visit. I still declined, and he wrote again. I burned his note,\nbecause I did not choose that anything from him should be in my\npossession. He told some story about papers of Lord Ongar. I have\nnothing to do with Lord Ongar's papers. Everything of which I knew\nwas sealed up in the count's presence and in mine, and was sent to\nthe lawyers for the executors. I looked at nothing; not at one word\nin a single letter. What could he have to say to me of Lord Ongar's\npapers?\"\n\n\"Or he might have written?\"\n\n\"At any rate he should not have come there, Harry. I would not see\nhim, nor, if I can help it, will I see him here. I will be open with\nyou, Harry. I think that perhaps it might suit him to make me his\nwife. Such an arrangement, however, would not suit me. I am not going\nto be frightened into marrying a man, because he has been falsely\ncalled my lover. If I cannot escape the calumny in any other way, I\nwill not escape it in that way.\"\n\n\"Has he said anything?\"\n\n\"No; not a word. I have not seen him since the day after Lord Ongar's\nfuneral. But I have seen his sister.\"\n\n\"And has she proposed such a thing?\"\n\n\"No, she has not proposed it. But she talks of it, saying that it\nwould not do. Then, when I tell her that of course it would not do,\nshe shows me all that would make it expedient. She is so sly and so\nfalse, that with all my eyes open I cannot quite understand her, or\nquite know what she is doing. I do not feel sure that she wishes it\nherself.\"\n\n\"She told me that it would not do.\"\n\n\"She did, did she? If she speaks of it again, tell her that she is\nright, that it will never do. Had he not come down to Ongar Park, I\nshould not have mentioned this to you. I should not have thought that\nhe had in truth any such scheme in his head. He did not tell you that\nhe had been there?\"\n\n\"He did not mention it. Indeed, he said very little about you at\nall.\"\n\n\"No, he would not. He is cautious. He never talks of anybody to\nanybody. He speaks only of the outward things of the world. Now,\nHarry, what you must do for me is this.\" As she was speaking to him\nshe was leaning again upon the table, with her forehead resting upon\nher hands. Her small widow's cap had become thus thrust back, and was\nnow nearly off her head, so that her rich brown hair was to be seen\nin its full luxuriance, rich and lovely as it had ever been. Could it\nbe that she felt,--half thought, half felt, without knowing that she\nthought it,--that while the signs of her widowhood were about her,\ntelling in their too plain language the tale of what she had been, he\ncould not dare to speak to her of his love? She was indeed a widow,\nbut not as are other widows. She had confessed, did hourly confess to\nherself, the guilt which she had committed in marrying that man; but\nthe very fact of such confessions, of such acknowledgment, absolved\nher from the necessity of any show of sorrow. When she declared how\nshe had despised and hated her late lord, she threw off mentally\nall her weeds. Mourning, the appearance even of mourning, became\nimpossible to her, and the cap upon her head was declared openly to\nbe a sacrifice to the world's requirements. It was now pushed back,\nbut I fancy that nothing like a thought on the matter had made itself\nplain to her mind. \"What you must do for me is this,\" she continued.\n\"You must see Count Pateroff again, and tell him from me,--as my\nfriend,--that I cannot consent to see him. Tell him that if he will\nthink of it, he must know the reason why.\"\n\n\"Of course he will know.\"\n\n\"Tell him what I say, all the same; and tell him that as I have\nhitherto had cause to be grateful to him for his kindness, so also\nI hope he will not put an end to that feeling by anything now, that\nwould not be kind. If there be papers of Lord Ongar's, he can take\nthem either to my lawyers, if that be fit, or to those of the family.\nYou can tell him that, can you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I can tell him.\"\n\n\"And have you any objection?\"\n\n\"None for myself. The question is,--would it not come better from\nsome one else?\"\n\n\"Because you are a young man, you mean? Whom else can I trust, Harry?\nTo whom can I go? Would you have me ask Hugh to do this? Or, perhaps\nyou think Archie Clavering would be a proper messenger. Who else have\nI got?\"\n\n\"Would not his sister be better?\"\n\n\"How should I know that she had told him? She would tell him her own\nstory,--what she herself wished. And whatever story she told, he\nwould not believe it. They know each other better than you and I know\nthem. It must be you, Harry, if you will do it.\"\n\n\"Of course I will do it. I will try and see him to-morrow. Where does\nhe live?\"\n\n\"How should I know? Perhaps nobody knows; no one, perhaps, of all\nthose with whom he associates constantly. They do not live after our\nfashion, do they, these foreigners? But you will find him at his\nclub, or hear of him at the house in Mount Street. You will do it;\neh, Harry?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"That is my good Harry. But I suppose you would do anything I asked\nyou. Ah, well; it is good to have one friend, if one has no more.\nLook, Harry! if it is not near eleven o'clock! Did you know that you\nhad been here nearly three hours? And I have given you nothing but a\ncup of tea!\"\n\n\"What else do you think I have wanted?\"\n\n\"At your club you would have had cigars and brandy-and-water, and\nbilliards, and broiled bones, and oysters, and tankards of beer.\nI know all about it. You have been very patient with me. If you go\nquick perhaps you will not be too late for the tankards and the\noysters.\"\n\n\"I never have any tankards or any oysters.\"\n\n\"Then it is cigars and brandy-and-water. Go quick, and perhaps you\nmay not be too late.\"\n\n\"I will go, but not there. One cannot change one's thoughts so\nsuddenly.\"\n\n\"Go, then; and do not change your thoughts. Go and think of me, and\npity me. Pity me for what I have got, but pity me most for what I\nhave lost.\" Harry did not say another word, but took her hand, and\nkissed it, and then left her.\n\nPity her for what she had lost! What had she lost? What did she mean\nby that? He knew well what she meant by pitying her for what she had\ngot. What had she lost? She had lost him. Did she intend to evoke his\npity for that loss? She had lost him. Yes, indeed. Whether or no the\nloss was one to regret, he would not say to himself; or rather, he,\nof course, declared that it was not; but such as it was, it had been\nincurred. He was now the property of Florence Burton, and, whatever\nhappened, he would be true to her.\n\nPerhaps he pitied himself also. If so, it is to be hoped that\nFlorence may never know of such pity. Before he went to bed, when\nhe was praying on his knees, he inserted it in his prayers that the\nGod in whom he believed might make him true in his faith to Florence\nBurton.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE RIVALS.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nLady Ongar sat alone, long into the night, when Harry Clavering had\nleft her. She sat there long, getting up occasionally from her seat,\nonce or twice attempting to write at her desk, looking now and then\nat a paper or two, and then at a small picture which she had, but\npassing the long hours in thinking,--in long, sad, solitary thoughts.\nWhat should she do with herself,--with herself, her title, and her\nmoney? Would it be still well that she should do something, that she\nshould make some attempt; or should she, in truth, abandon all, as\nthe arch-traitor did, and acknowledge that for her foot there could\nno longer be a resting-place on the earth? At six-and-twenty, with\nyouth, beauty, and wealth at her command, must she despair? But her\nyouth had been stained, her beauty had lost its freshness; and as\nfor her wealth, had she not stolen it? Did not the weight of the\ntheft sit so heavy on her, that her brightest thought was one which\nprompted her to abandon it?\n\nAs to that idea of giving up her income and her house, and calling\nherself again Julia Brabazon, though there was something in the\npoetry of it which would now and again for half an hour relieve her,\nyet she hardly proposed such a course to herself as a reality. The\nworld in which she had lived had taught her to laugh at romance,\nto laugh at it even while she liked its beauty; and she would tell\nherself that for such a one as her to do such a thing as this, would\nbe to insure for herself the ridicule of all who knew her name. What\nwould Sir Hugh say, and her sister? What Count Pateroff and the\nfaithful Sophie? What all the Ongar tribe, who would reap the rich\nharvest of her insanity? These latter would offer to provide her a\nplace in some convenient asylum, and the others would all agree that\nsuch would be her fitting destiny. She could bear the idea of walking\nforth, as she had said, penniless into the street, without a crust;\nbut she could not bear the idea of being laughed at when she got\nthere.\n\nTo her, in her position, her only escape was by marriage. It was the\nsolitude of her position which maddened her;--its solitude, or the\nnecessity of breaking that solitude by the presence of those who were\nodious to her. Whether it were better to be alone, feeding on the\nbitterness of her own thoughts, or to be comforted by the fulsome\nflatteries and odious falsenesses of Sophie Gordeloup, she could\nnot tell. She hated herself for her loneliness, but she hated\nherself almost worse for submitting herself to the society of\nSophie Gordeloup. Why not give all that she possessed to Harry\nClavering--herself, her income, her rich pastures and horses and\noxen, and try whether the world would not be better to her when she\nhad done so?\n\nShe had learned to laugh at romance, but still she believed in\nlove. While that bargain was going on as to her settlement, she had\nlaughed at romance, and had told herself that in this world worldly\nprosperity was everything. Sir Hugh then had stood by her with truth,\nfor he had well understood the matter, and could enter into it with\nzest. Lord Ongar, in his state of health, had not been in a position\nto make close stipulations as to the dower in the event of his\nproposed wife becoming a widow. \"No, no; we won't stand that,\" Sir\nHugh had said to the lawyers. \"We all hope, of course, that Lord\nOngar may live long; no doubt he'll turn over a new leaf, and die at\nninety. But in such a case as this the widow must not be fettered.\"\nThe widow had not been fettered, and Julia had been made to\nunderstand the full advantage of such an arrangement. But still she\nhad believed in love when she had bade farewell to Harry in the\ngarden. She had told herself then, even then, that she would have\nbetter liked to have taken him and his love,--if only she could have\nafforded it. He had not dreamed that on leaving him she had gone\nfrom him to her room, and taken out his picture,--the same that she\nhad with her now in Bolton Street,--and had kissed it, bidding him\nfarewell there with a passion which she could not display in his\npresence. And she had thought of his offer about the money over and\nover again. \"Yes,\" she would say; \"that man loved me. He would have\ngiven me all he had to relieve me, though nothing was to come to him\nin return.\" She had, at any rate, been loved once; and she almost\nwished that she had taken the money, that she might now have an\nopportunity of repaying it.\n\nAnd she was again free, and her old lover was again by her side. Had\nthat fatal episode in her life been so fatal that she must now regard\nherself as tainted and unfit for him? There was no longer anything to\nseparate them,--anything of which she was aware, unless it was that.\nAnd as for his love,--did he not look and speak as though he loved\nher still? Had he not pressed her hand passionately, and kissed it,\nand once more called her Julia? How should it be that he should not\nlove her? In such a case as his, love might have been turned to\nhatred or to enmity; but it was not so with him. He called himself\nher friend. How could there be friendship between them without love?\n\nAnd then she thought how much with her wealth she might do for him.\nWith all his early studies and his talent Harry Clavering was not\nthe man, she thought, to make his way in the world by hard work; but\nwith such an income as she could give him, he might shine among the\nproud ones of his nation. He should go into Parliament, and do great\nthings. He should be lord of all. It should all be his without a word\nof reserve. She had been mercenary once, but she would atone for that\nnow by open-handed, undoubting generosity. She herself had learned to\nhate the house and fields and widespread comforts of Ongar Park. She\nhad walked among it all alone, and despised. But it would be a glory\nto her to see him go forth, with Giles at his heels, boldly giving\nhis orders, changing this and improving that. He would be rebuked for\nno errors, let him do with Enoch Gubby and the rest of them what he\npleased! And then the parson's wife would be glad enough to come to\nher, and the house would be full of smiling faces. And it might be\nthat God would be good to her, and that she would have treasures, as\nother women had them, and that the flavour would come back to the\napples, and that the ashes would cease to grate between her teeth.\n\nShe loved him, and why should it not be so? She could go before God's\naltar with him without disgracing herself with a lie. She could put\nher hand in his, and swear honestly that she would worship him and\nobey him. She had been dishonest;--but if he would pardon her for\nthat, could she not reward him richly for such pardon? And it seemed\nto her that he had pardoned her. He had forgiven it all and was\ngracious to her,--coming at her beck and call, and sitting with her\nas though he liked her presence. She was woman enough to understand\nthis, and she knew that he liked it. Of course he loved her. How\ncould it be otherwise?\n\nBut yet he spoke nothing to her of his love. In the old days there\nhad been with him no bashfulness of that kind. He was not a man to\ntremble and doubt before a woman. In those old days he had been ready\nenough,--so ready, that she had wondered that one who had just come\nfrom his books should know so well how to make himself master of a\ngirl's heart. Nature had given him that art, as she does give it to\nsome, withholding it from many. But now he sat near her, dropping\nonce and again half words of love, hearing her references to the old\ntimes;--and yet he said nothing.\n\nBut how was he to speak of love to one who was a widow but of four\nmonths' standing? And with what face could he now again ask for her\nhand, knowing that it had been filled so full since last it was\nrefused to him? It was thus she argued to herself when she excused\nhim in that he did not speak to her. As to her widowhood, to herself\nit was a thing of scorn. Thinking of it, she cast her weepers from\nher, and walked about the room, scorning the hypocrisy of her dress.\nIt needed that she should submit herself to this hypocrisy before\nthe world; but he might know,--for had she not told him?--that the\nclothes she wore were no index of her feeling or of her heart. She\nhad been mean enough, base enough, vile enough, to sell herself\nto that wretched lord. Mean, base, and vile she had been, and she\nnow confessed it; but she was not false enough to pretend that she\nmourned the man as a wife mourns. Harry might have seen enough to\nknow, have understood enough to perceive, that he need not regard her\nwidowhood.\n\nAnd as to her money! If that were the stumbling-block, might it not\nbe well that the first overture should come from her? Could she not\nfind words to tell him that it might all be his? Could she not say to\nhim, \"Harry Clavering, all this is nothing in my hands. Take it into\nyour hands, and it will prosper.\" Then it was that she went to her\ndesk, and attempted to write to him. She did write to him a completed\nnote, offering herself and all that was hers for his acceptance. In\ndoing so, she strove hard to be honest and yet not over bold; to be\naffectionate and yet not unfeminine. Long she sat, holding her head\nwith one hand, while the other attempted to use the pen which would\nnot move over the paper. At length, quickly it flew across the sheet,\nand a few lines were there for her to peruse.\n\n\"Harry Clavering,\" she had written,\n\n\n   I know I am doing what men and women say no woman should\n   do. You may, perhaps, say so of me now; but if you do,\n   I know you so well, that I do not fear that others will\n   be able to repeat it. Harry, I have never loved any one\n   but you. Will you be my husband? You well know that I\n   should not make you this offer if I did not intend that\n   everything I have should be yours. It will be pleasant to\n   me to feel that I can make some reparation for the evil\n   I have done. As for love, I have never loved any one but\n   you. You yourself must know that well. Yours, altogether\n   if you will have it so,--JULIA.\n\n\nShe took the letter with her, back across the room to her seat by the\nfire, and took with her at the same time the little portrait; and\nthere she sat, looking at the one and reading the other. At last she\nslowly folded the note up into a thin wisp of paper, and, lighting\nthe end of it, watched it till every shred of it was burnt to an ash.\n\"If he wants me,\" she said, \"he can come and take me,--as other men\ndo.\" It was a fearful attempt, that which she had thought of making.\nHow could she have looked him in the face again had his answer to her\nbeen a refusal?\n\nAnother hour went by before she took herself to her bed, during\nwhich her cruelly-used maiden was waiting for her half asleep in\nthe chamber above; and during that time she tried to bring herself\nto some steady resolve. She would remain in London for the coming\nmonths, so that he might come to her if he pleased. She would remain\nthere, even though she were subject to the daily attacks of Sophie\nGordeloup. She hardly knew why, but in part she was afraid of Sophie.\nShe had done nothing of which Sophie knew the secret. She had no\ncause to tremble because Sophie might be offended. The woman had\nseen her in some of her saddest moments, and could indeed tell\nof indignities which would have killed some women. But these she\nhad borne, and had not disgraced herself in the bearing of them.\nBut still she was afraid of Sophie, and felt that she could not\nbring herself absolutely to dismiss her friend from her house.\nNevertheless, she would remain;--because Harry Clavering was in\nLondon and could come to her there. To her house at Ongar Park she\nwould never go again, unless she went as his wife. The place had\nbecome odious to her. Bad as was her solitude in London, with Sophie\nGordeloup to break it,--and perhaps with Sophie's brother to attack\nher, it was not so bad as the silent desolation of Ongar Park. Never\nagain would she go there, unless she went there, in triumph,--as\nHarry's wife. Having so far resolved she took herself at last to her\nroom, and dismissed her drowsy Phoebe to her rest.\n\nAnd now the reader must be asked to travel down at once into the\ncountry, that he may see how Florence Burton passed the same evening\nat Clavering Rectory. It was Florence's last night there, and on\nthe following morning she was to return to her father's house at\nStratton. Florence had not as yet received her unsatisfactory letter\nfrom Harry. That was to arrive on the following morning. At present\nshe was, as regarded her letters, under the influence of that one\nwhich had been satisfactory in so especial a degree. Not that the\ncoming letter,--the one now on its route,--was of a nature to disturb\nher comfort permanently, or to make her in any degree unhappy. \"Dear\nfellow; he must be careful, he is overworking himself.\" Even the\nunsatisfactory letter would produce nothing worse than this from her;\nbut now, at the moment of which I am writing, she was in a paradise\nof happy thoughts.\n\nHer visit to Clavering had been in every respect successful. She had\nbeen liked by every one, and every one in return had been liked by\nher. Mrs. Clavering had treated her as though she were a daughter.\nThe rector had made her pretty presents, had kissed her, and called\nher his child. With Fanny she had formed a friendship which was to\nendure for ever, let destiny separate them how it might. Dear Fanny!\nShe had had a wonderful interview respecting Fanny on this very day,\nand was at this moment disquieting her mind because she could not\ntell her friend what had happened without a breach of confidence!\nShe had learned a great deal at Clavering, though in most matters\nof learning she was a better instructed woman than they were whom\nshe had met. In general knowledge and in intellect she was Fanny's\nsuperior, though Fanny Clavering was no fool; but Florence, when she\ncame thither, had lacked something which living in such a house had\ngiven to her;--or, I should rather say, something had been given to\nher of which she would greatly feel the want, if it could be again\ntaken from her. Her mother was as excellent a woman as had ever sent\nforth a family of daughters into the world, and I do not know that\nany one ever objected to her as being ignorant, or specially vulgar;\nbut the house in Stratton was not like Clavering Rectory in the\nlittle ways of living, and this Florence Burton had been clever\nenough to understand. She knew that a sojourn under such a roof, with\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Clavering, must make her fitter to be Harry's\nwife; and, therefore, when they pressed her to come again in the\nautumn, she said that she thought she would. She could understand,\ntoo, that Harry was different in many things from the men who had\nmarried her sisters, and she rejoiced that it was so. Poor Florence!\nHad he been more like them it might have been safer for her.\n\nBut we must return for a moment to the wonderful interview which\nhas been mentioned. Florence, during her sojourn at Clavering, had\nbecome intimate with Mr. Saul, as well as with Fanny. She had given\nherself for the time heartily to the schools, and matters had so far\nprogressed with her that Mr. Saul had on one occasion scolded her\nsoundly. \"It's a great sign that he thinks well of you,\" Fanny had\nsaid. \"It was the only sign he ever gave me, before he spoke to\nme in that sad strain.\" On the afternoon of this, her last day at\nClavering, she had gone over to Cumberly Green with Fanny, to say\nfarewell to the children, and walked back by herself, as Fanny had\nnot finished her work. When she was still about half a mile from the\nrectory, she met Mr. Saul, who was on his way out to the Green. \"I\nknew I should meet you,\" he said, \"so that I might say good-by.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Mr. Saul,--for I am going in truth, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I wish you were staying. I wish you were going to remain with us.\nHaving you here is very pleasant, and you do more good here, perhaps,\nthan you will elsewhere.\"\n\n\"I will not allow that. You forget that I have a father and mother.\"\n\n\"Yes; and you will have a husband soon.\"\n\n\"No, not soon; some day, perhaps, if all goes well. But I mean to be\nback here often before that. I mean to be here in October, just for a\nlittle visit, if mamma can spare me.\"\n\n\"Miss Burton,\" he said, speaking in a very serious tone--. All his\ntones were serious, but that which he now adopted was more solemn\nthan usual. \"I wish to consult you on a certain matter, if you can\ngive me five minutes of your time.\"\n\n\"To consult me, Mr. Saul?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Burton. I am hard pressed at present, and I know no one\nelse of whom I can ask a certain question, if I cannot ask it of you.\nI think that you will answer me truly, if you answer me at all. I do\nnot think you would flatter me, or tell me an untruth.\"\n\n\"Flatter you! how could I flatter you?\"\n\n\"By telling me--; but I must ask you my question first. You and Fanny\nClavering are dear friends now. You tell each other everything.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Florence, doubting as to what she might best\nsay, but guessing something of that which was coming.\n\n\"She will have told you, perhaps, that I asked her to be my wife.\nDid she ever tell you that?\" Florence looked into his face for a\nfew moments without answering him, not knowing how to answer such a\nquestion. \"I know that she has told you,\" said he. \"I can see that it\nis so.\"\n\n\"She has told me,\" said Florence.\n\n\"Why should she not? How could she be with you so many hours, and not\ntell you that of which she could hardly fail to have the remembrance\noften present with her. If I were gone from here, if I were not\nbefore her eyes daily, it might be otherwise; but seeing me as she\ndoes from day to day, of course she has spoken of me to her friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Saul; she has told me of it.\"\n\n\"And now, will you tell me whether I may hope.\"\n\n\"Mr. Saul!\"\n\n\"I want you to betray no secret, but I ask you for your advice. Can I\nhope that she will ever return my love?\"\n\n\"How am I to answer you?\"\n\n\"With the truth. Only with the truth.\"\n\n\"I should say that she thinks that you have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Forgotten it! No, Miss Burton; she cannot think that. Do you believe\nthat men or women can forget such things as that? Can you ever forget\nher brother? Do you think people ever forget when they have loved?\nNo, I have not forgotten her. I have not forgotten that walk which\nwe had down this lane together. There are things which men never\nforget.\" Then he paused for an answer.\n\nFlorence was by nature steady and self-collected, and she at once\nfelt that she was bound to be wary before she gave him any answer.\nShe had half fancied once or twice that Fanny thought more of Mr.\nSaul than she allowed even herself to know. And Fanny, when she had\nspoken of the impossibility of such a marriage, had always based the\nimpossibility on the fact that people should not marry without the\nmeans of living,--a reason which to Florence, with all her prudence,\nwas not sufficient. Fanny might wait as she also intended to wait.\nLatterly, too, Fanny had declared more than once to Florence her\nconviction that Mr. Saul's passion had been a momentary insanity\nwhich had altogether passed away; and in these declarations Florence\nhad half fancied that she discovered some tinge of regret. If it were\nso, what was she now to say to Mr. Saul?\n\n\"You think then, Miss Burton,\" he continued, \"that I have no chance\nof success? I ask the question because if I felt certain that this\nwas so,--quite certain, I should be wrong to remain here. It has been\nmy first and only parish, and I could not leave it without bitter\nsorrow. But if I were to remain here hopelessly, I should become\nunfit for my work. I am becoming so, and shall be better away.\"\n\n\"But why ask me, Mr. Saul?\"\n\n\"Because I think that you can tell me.\"\n\n\"But why not ask herself? Who can tell you so truly as she can do?\"\n\n\"You would not advise me to do that if you were sure that she would\nreject me?\"\n\n\"That is what I would advise.\"\n\n\"I will take your advice, Miss Burton. Now, good-by, and may God\nbless you. You say you will be here in the autumn; but before the\nautumn I shall probably have left Clavering. If so our farewells\nwill be for very long, but I shall always remember our pleasant\nintercourse here.\" Then he went on towards Cumberly Green; and\nFlorence, as she walked into the vicarage grounds, was thinking that\nno girl had ever been loved by a more single-hearted, pure-minded\ngentleman than Mr. Saul.\n\nAs she sat alone in her bed-room, five or six hours after this\ninterview, she felt some regret that she should leave Clavering\nwithout a word to Fanny on the subject. Mr. Saul had exacted no\npromise of secrecy from her; he was not a man to exact such promises.\nBut she felt not the less that she would be betraying confidence to\nspeak, and it might even be that her speaking on the matter would do\nmore harm than good. Her sympathies were doubtless with Mr. Saul, but\nshe could not therefore say that she thought Fanny ought to accept\nhis love. It would be best to say nothing of the matter, and to allow\nMr. Saul to fight his own battle.\n\nThen she turned to her own matters, and there she found that\neverything was pleasant. How good the world had been to her to give\nher such a lover as Harry Clavering! She owned with all her heart the\nexcellence of being in love, when a girl might be allowed to call\nsuch a man her own. She could not but make comparisons between him\nand Mr. Saul, though she knew that she was making them on points that\nwere hardly worthy of her thoughts. Mr. Saul was plain, uncouth, with\nlittle that was bright about him except the brightness of his piety.\nHarry was like the morning star. He looked and walked and spoke as\nthough he were something more godlike than common men. His very\nvoice created joy, and the ring of his laughter was to Florence\nas the music of the heavens. What woman would not have loved Harry\nClavering? Even Julia Brabazon,--a creature so base that she had sold\nherself to such a thing as Lord Ongar for money and a title, but\nso grand in her gait and ways, so Florence had been told, that she\nseemed to despise the earth on which she trod,--even she had loved\nhim. Then as Florence thought of what Julia Brabazon might have had\nand of what she had lost, she wondered that there could be women born\nso sadly vicious.\n\nBut that woman's vice had given her her success, her joy, her great\ntriumph! It was surely not for her to deal hardly with the faults of\nJulia Brabazon,--for her who was enjoying all the blessings of which\nthose faults had robbed the other! Julia Brabazon had been her very\ngood friend.\n\nBut why had this perfect lover come to her, to one so small, so\ntrifling, so little in the world's account as she, and given to her\nall the treasure of his love? Oh, Harry,--dear Harry! what could\nshe do for him that would be a return good enough for such great\ngoodness? Then she took out his last letter, that satisfactory\nletter, that letter that had been declared to be perfect, and read it\nand read it again. No; she did not want Fanny or any one else to tell\nher that he was true. Honesty and truth were written on every line of\nhis face, were to be heard in every tone of his voice, could be seen\nin every sentence that came from his hand. Dear Harry; dearest Harry!\nShe knew well that he was true.\n\nThen she also sat down and wrote to him, on that her last night\nbeneath his father's roof,--wrote to him when she had nearly prepared\nherself for her bed; and honestly, out of her full heart, thanked him\nfor his love. There was no need that she should be coy with him now,\nfor she was his own. \"Dear Harry, when I think of all that you have\ndone for me in loving me and choosing me for your wife, I know that\nI can never pay you all that I owe you.\"\n\nSuch were the two rival claimants for the hand of Harry Clavering.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\"LET HER KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE.\"\n\n\nA week had passed since the evening which Harry had spent in Bolton\nStreet, and he had not again seen Lady Ongar. He had professed to\nhimself that his reason for not going there was the non-performance\nof the commission which Lady Ongar had given him with reference\nto Count Pateroff. He had not yet succeeded in catching the count,\nthough he had twice asked for him in Mount Street and twice at the\nclub in Pall Mall. It appeared that the count never went to Mount\nStreet, and was very rarely seen at the club. There was some other\nclub which he frequented, and Harry did not know what club. On both\nthe occasions of Harry's calling in Mount Street, the servant had\nasked him to go up and see madame; but he had declined to do so,\npleading that he was hurried. He was, however, driven to resolve that\nhe must go direct to Sophie, as otherwise he could find no means of\ndoing as he had promised. She probably might put him on the scent of\nher brother.\n\nBut there had been another reason why Harry had not gone to Bolton\nStreet, though he had not acknowledged it to himself. He did not\ndare to trust himself with Lady Ongar. He feared that he would be\nled on to betray himself and to betray Florence,--to throw himself\nat Julia's feet and sacrifice his honesty, in spite of all his\nresolutions to the contrary. He felt when there as the accustomed but\nrepentant dram-drinker might feel, when having resolved to abstain,\nhe is called upon to sit with the full glass offered before his lips.\nFrom such temptation as that the repentant dram-drinker knows that\nhe must fly. But though he did not go after the fire-water of Bolton\nStreet, neither was he able to satisfy himself with the cool fountain\nof Onslow Crescent. He was wretched at this time,--ill-satisfied with\nhimself and others, and was no fitting companion for Cecilia Burton.\nThe world, he thought, had used him ill. He could have been true to\nJulia Brabazon when she was well-nigh penniless. It was not for her\nmoney that he had regarded her. Had he been now a free man,--free\nfrom those chains with which he had fettered himself at Stratton,--he\nwould again have asked this woman for her love, in spite of her past\ntreachery; but it would have been for her love and not for her money\nthat he would have sought her. Was it his fault that he had loved\nher, that she had been false to him, and that she had now come back\nand thrown herself before him? Or had he been wrong because he had\nventured to think that he loved another when Julia had deserted him?\nOr could he help himself if he now found that his love in truth\nbelonged to her whom he had known first? The world had been very\ncruel to him, and he could not go to Onslow Crescent and behave there\nprettily, hearing the praises of Florence with all the ardour of a\ndiscreet lover.\n\nHe knew well what would have been his right course, and yet he did\nnot follow it. Let him but once communicate to Lady Ongar the fact of\nhis engagement, and the danger would be over, though much, perhaps,\nof the misery might remain. Let him write to her and mention the\nfact, bringing it up as some little immaterial accident, and she\nwould understand what he meant. But this he abstained from doing.\nThough he swore to himself that he would not touch the dram, he would\nnot dash down the full glass that was held to his lips. He went\nabout the town very wretchedly, looking for the count, and regarding\nhimself as a man specially marked out for sorrow by the cruel hand of\nmisfortune. Lady Ongar, in the meantime, was expecting him, and was\nwaxing angry and becoming bitter towards him because he came not.\n\nSir Hugh Clavering was now up in London, and with him was his brother\nArchie. Sir Hugh was a man who strained an income, that was handsome\nand sufficient for a country gentleman, to the very utmost, wanting\nto get out of it more than it could be made to give. He was not a man\nto be in debt, or indulge himself with present pleasures to be paid\nfor out of the funds of future years. He was possessed of a worldly\nwisdom which kept him from that folly, and taught him to appreciate\nfully the value of independence. But he was ever remembering how many\nshillings there are in a pound, and how many pence in a shilling. He\nhad a great eye to discount, and looked very closely into his bills.\nHe searched for cheap shops;--and some men began to say of him that\nhe had found a cheap establishment for such wines as he did not drink\nhimself! In playing cards and in betting he was very careful, never\nplaying high, never risking much, but hoping to turn something by the\nend of the year, and angry with himself if he had not done so. An\nunamiable man he was, but one whose heir would probably not quarrel\nwith him,--if only he would die soon enough. He had always had a\nhouse in town, a moderate house in Berkeley Square, which belonged\nto him and had belonged to his father before him. Lady Clavering\nhad usually lived there during the season; or, as had latterly been\nthe case, during only a part of the season. And now it had come to\npass, in this year, that Lady Clavering was not to come to London at\nall, and that Sir Hugh was meditating whether the house in Berkeley\nSquare might not be let. The arrangement would make the difference\nof considerably more than a thousand a year to him. For himself, he\nwould take lodgings. He had no idea of giving up London in the spring\nand early summer. But why keep up a house in Berkeley Square, as Lady\nClavering did not use it?\n\nHe was partly driven to this by a desire to shake off the burden of\nhis brother. When Archie chose to go to Clavering the house was open\nto him. That was the necessity of Sir Hugh's position, and he could\nnot avoid it unless he made it worth his while to quarrel with his\nbrother. Archie was obedient, ringing the bell when he was told,\nlooking after the horses, spying about, and perhaps saving as much\nmoney as he cost. But the matter was very different in Berkeley\nSquare. No elder brother is bound to find breakfast and bed for a\nyounger brother in London. And yet from his boyhood upwards Archie\nhad made good his footing in Berkeley Square. In the matter of the\nbreakfast, Sir Hugh had indeed of late got the better of him. The\nservants were kept on board wages, and there were no household\naccounts. But there was Archie's room, and Sir Hugh felt this to be a\nhardship.\n\nThe present was not the moment for actually driving forth the\nintruder, for Archie was now up in London, especially under his\nbrother's auspices. And if the business on which Captain Clavering\nwas now intent could be brought to a successful issue, the standing\nin the world of that young man would be very much altered. Then he\nwould be a brother of whom Sir Hugh might be proud; a brother who\nwould pay his way, and settle his points at whist if he lost them,\neven to a brother. If Archie could induce Lady Ongar to marry him, he\nwould not be called upon any longer to ring the bells and look after\nthe stable. He would have bells of his own, and stables too, and\nperhaps some captain of his own to ring them and look after them. The\nexpulsion, therefore, was not to take place till Archie should have\nmade his attempt upon Lady Ongar.\n\nBut Sir Hugh would admit of no delay, whereas Archie himself seemed\nto think that the iron was not yet quite hot enough for striking. It\nwould be better, he had suggested, to postpone the work till Julia\ncould be coaxed down to Clavering in the autumn. He could do the work\nbetter, he thought, down at Clavering than in London. But Sir Hugh\nwas altogether of a different opinion. Though he had already asked\nhis sister-in-law to Clavering, when the idea had first come up, he\nwas glad that she had declined the visit. Her coming might be very\nwell if she accepted Archie; but he did not want to be troubled with\nany renewal of his responsibility respecting her, if, as was more\nprobable, she should reject him. The world still looked askance at\nLady Ongar, and Hugh did not wish to take up the armour of a paladin\nin her favour. If Archie married her, Archie would be the paladin;\nthough, indeed, in that case, no paladin would be needed.\n\n\"She has only been a widow, you know, four months,\" said Archie,\npleading for delay. \"It won't be delicate, will it?\"\n\n\"Delicate!\" said Sir Hugh. \"I don't know whether there is much of\ndelicacy in it at all.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she isn't to be treated like any other woman. If you\nwere to die, you'd think it very odd if any fellow came up to Hermy\nbefore the season was over.\"\n\n\"Archie, you are a fool,\" said Sir Hugh; and Archie could see by his\nbrother's brow that Hugh was angry. \"You say things that for folly\nand absurdity are beyond belief. If you can't see the peculiarities\nof Julia's position, I am not going to point them out to you.\"\n\n\"She is peculiar, of course,--having so much money, and that place\nnear Guildford, all her own for her life. Of course it's peculiar.\nBut four months, Hugh!\"\n\n\"If it had been four days it need have made no difference. A home,\nwith some one to support her, is everything to her. If you wait till\nlots of fellows are buzzing round her you won't have a chance. You'll\nfind that by this time next year she'll be the top of the fashion;\nand if not engaged to you, she will be to some one else. I shouldn't\nbe surprised if Harry were after her again.\"\n\n\"He's engaged to that girl we saw down at Clavering.\"\n\n\"What matters that? Engagements can be broken as well as made. You\nhave this great advantage over every one, except him, that you can go\nto her at once without doing anything out of the way. That girl that\nHarry has in tow may perhaps keep him away for some time.\"\n\n\"I tell you what, Hugh, you might as well call with me the first\ntime.\"\n\n\"So that I may quarrel with her, which I certainly should do,--or,\nrather, she with me. No, Archie; if you're afraid to go alone, you'd\nbetter give it up.\"\n\n\"Afraid! I'm not afraid!\"\n\n\"She can't eat you. Remember that with her you needn't stand on your\np's and q's, as you would with another woman. She knows what she is\nabout, and will understand what she has to get as well as what she is\nexpected to give. All I can say is, that if she accepts you, Hermy\nwill consent that she shall go to Clavering as much as she pleases\ntill the marriage takes place. It couldn't be done, I suppose, till\nafter a year; and in that case she shall be married at Clavering.\"\n\nHere was a prospect for Julia Brabazon;--to be led to the same altar,\nat which she had married Lord Ongar, by Archie Clavering, twelve\nmonths after her first husband's death, and little more than two\nyears after her first wedding! The peculiarity of the position did\nnot quite make itself apparent either to Hugh or to Archie; but there\nwas one point which did suggest itself to the younger brother at that\nmoment.\n\n\"I don't suppose there was anything really wrong, eh?\"\n\n\"Can't say, I'm sure,\" said Sir Hugh.\n\n\"Because I shouldn't like--\"\n\n\"If I were you I wouldn't trouble myself about that. Judge not, that\nyou be not judged.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true, to be sure,\" said Archie; and on that point he\nwent forth satisfied.\n\nBut the job before him was a peculiar job, and that Archie well\nknew. In some inexplicable manner he put himself into the scales and\nweighed himself, and discovered his own weight with fair accuracy.\nAnd he put her into the scales, and he found that she was much\nthe heavier of the two. How he did this,--how such men as Archie\nClavering do do it,--I cannot say; but they do weigh themselves, and\nknow their own weight, and shove themselves aside as being too light\nfor any real service in the world. This they do, though they may\nfluster with their voices, and walk about with their noses in the\nair, and swing their canes, and try to look as large as they may.\nThey do not look large, and they know it; and consequently they ring\nthe bells, and look after the horses, and shove themselves on one\nside, so that the heavier weights may come forth and do the work.\nArchie Clavering, who had duly weighed himself, could hardly bring\nhimself to believe that Lady Ongar would be fool enough to marry him!\nSeven thousand a year, with a park and farm in Surrey, and give it\nall to him,--him, Archie Clavering, who had, so to say, no weight at\nall! Archie Clavering, for one, could not bring himself to believe\nit.\n\nBut yet Hermy, her sister, thought it possible; and though Hermy was,\nas Archie had found out by his invisible scales, lighter than Julia,\nstill she must know something of her sister's nature. And Hugh, who\nwas by no means light,--who was a man of weight, with money and\nposition and firm ground beneath his feet,--he also thought that\nit might be so. \"Faint heart never won a fair lady,\" said Archie\nto himself a dozen times, as he walked down to the Rag. The Rag\nwas his club, and there was a friend there whom he could consult\nconfidentially. No; faint heart never won a fair lady; but they\nwho repeat to themselves that adage, trying thereby to get courage,\nalways have faint hearts for such work. Harry Clavering never thought\nof the proverb when he went a-wooing.\n\nBut Captain Boodle of the Rag,--for Captain Boodle always lived at\nthe Rag when he was not at Newmarket, or at other racecourses, or in\nthe neighbourhood of Market Harborough,--Captain Boodle knew a thing\nor two, and Captain Boodle was his fast friend. He would go to Boodle\nand arrange the campaign with him. Boodle had none of that hectoring,\ndomineering way which Hugh never quite threw off in his intercourse\nwith his brother. And Archie, as he went along, resolved that when\nLady Ongar's money was his, and when he had a countess for his wife,\nhe would give his elder brother a cold shoulder.\n\nBoodle was playing pool at the Rag, and Archie joined him; but\npool is a game which hardly admits of confidential intercourse as\nto proposed wives, and Archie was obliged to remain quiet on that\nsubject all the afternoon. He cunningly, however, lost a little money\nto Boodle, for Boodle liked to win,--and engaged himself to dine\nat the same table with his friend. Their dinner they ate almost\nin silence,--unless when they abused the cook, or made to each\nother some pithy suggestion as to the expediency of this or that\ndelicacy,--bearing always steadily in view the cost as well as\ndesirability of the viands. Boodle had no shame in not having this\nor that because it was dear. To dine with the utmost luxury at the\nsmallest expense was a proficiency belonging to him, and of which he\nwas very proud.\n\nBut after a while the cloth was gone, and the heads of the two men\nwere brought near together over the small table. Boodle did not speak\na word till his brother captain had told his story, had pointed out\nall the advantages to be gained, explained in what peculiar way the\ncourse lay open to himself, and made the whole thing clear to his\nfriend's eye.\n\n\"They say she's been a little queer, don't they?\" said the friendly\ncounsellor.\n\n\"Of course people talk, you know.\"\n\n\"Talk, yes; they're talking a doosed sight, I should say. There's no\nmistake about the money, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, none,\" said Archie, shaking his head vigorously. \"Hugh managed\nall that for her, so I know it.\"\n\n\"She don't lose any of it because she enters herself for running\nagain, does she?\"\n\n\"Not a shilling. That's the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"Was you ever sweet on her before?\"\n\n\"What! before Ongar took her? O laws, no. She hadn't a rap, you\nknow;--and knew how to spend money as well as any girl in London.\"\n\n\"It's all to begin then, Clavvy; all the up-hill work to be done?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I don't know about up-hill, Doodles. What do you mean by\nup-hill?\"\n\n\"I mean that seven thousand a year ain't usually to be picked up\nmerely by trotting easy along the flat. And this sort of work is\nvery up-hill generally, I take it;--unless, you know, a fellow has a\nfancy for it. If a fellow is really sweet on a girl, he likes it, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"She's a doosed handsome woman, you know, Doodles.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, except that I suppose Ongar wouldn't\nhave taken her if she hadn't stood well on her pasterns, and had\nsome breeding about her. I never thought much of her sister,--your\nbrother's wife, you know,--that is in the way of looks. No doubt she\nruns straight, and that's a great thing. She won't go the wrong side\nof the post.\"\n\n\"As for running straight, let me alone for that.\"\n\n\"Well, now, Clavvy, I'll tell you what my ideas are. When a man's\ntrying a young filly, his hands can't be too light. A touch too much\nwill bring her on her haunches, or throw her out of her step. She\nshould hardly feel the iron in her mouth. That's the sort of work\nwhich requires a man to know well what he's about. But when I've got\nto do with a trained mare, I always choose that she shall know that\nI'm there! Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes; I understand you, Doodles.\"\n\n\"I always choose that she shall know that I'm there.\" And Captain\nBoodle, as he repeated these manly words with a firm voice, put out\nhis hands as though he were handling the horse's rein. \"Their mouths\nare never so fine then, and they generally want to be brought up\nto the bit, d'ye see?--up to the bit. When a mare has been trained\nto her work, and knows what she's at in her running, she's all the\nbetter for feeling a fellow's hands as she's going. She likes it\nrather. It gives her confidence, and makes her know where she is. And\nlook here, Clavvy, when she comes to her fences, give her her head;\nbut steady her first, and make her know that you're there. Damme;\nwhatever you do, let her know that you're there. There's nothing like\nit. She'll think all the more of the fellow that's piloting her. And\nlook here, Clavvy; ride her with spurs. Always ride a trained mare\nwith spurs. Let her know that they're on; and if she tries to get her\nhead, give 'em her. Yes, by George, give 'em her.\" And Captain Boodle\nin his energy twisted himself in his chair, and brought his heel\nround, so that it could be seen by Archie. Then he produced a sharp\nclick with his tongue, and made the peculiar jerk with the muscle\nof his legs, whereby he was accustomed to evoke the agility of his\nhorses. After that he looked triumphantly at his friend. \"Give 'em\nher, Clavvy, and she'll like you the better for it. She'll know then\nthat you mean it.\"\n\nIt was thus that Captain Boodle instructed his friend Archie\nClavering how to woo Lady Ongar; and Archie, as he listened to his\nfriend's words of wisdom, felt that he had learned a great deal.\n\"That's the way I'll do it, Doodles,\" he said, \"and upon my word I'm\nvery much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"That's the way, you may depend on it. Let her know that you're\nthere.--Let her know that you're there. She's done the filly work\nbefore, you see; and it's no good trying that again.\"\n\nCaptain Clavering really believed that he had learned a good deal,\nand that he now knew the way to set about the work before him. What\nsort of spurs he was to use, and how he was to put them on, I don't\nthink he did know; but that was a detail as to which he did not think\nit necessary to consult his adviser. He sat the whole evening in the\nsmoking-room, very silent, drinking slowly iced gin-and-water; and\nthe more he drank the more assured he felt that he now understood the\nway in which he was to attempt the work before him. \"Let her know\nI'm there,\" he said to himself, shaking his head gently, so that no\none should observe him; \"yes, let her know I'm there.\" At this time\nCaptain Boodle, or Doodles as he was familiarly called, had again\nascended to the billiard-room and was hard at work. \"Let her know\nthat I'm there,\" repeated Archie, mentally. Everything was contained\nin that precept. And he, with his hands before him on his knees, went\nthrough the process of steadying a horse with the snaffle-rein, just\ntouching the curb, as he did so, for security. It was but a motion of\nhis fingers and no one could see it, but it made him confident that\nhe had learned his lesson. \"Up to the bit,\" he repeated; \"by George,\nyes; up to the bit. There's nothing like it for a trained mare. Give\nher head, but steady her.\" And Archie, as the words passed across his\nmemory and were almost pronounced, seemed to be flying successfully\nover some prodigious fence. He leaned himself back a little in the\nsaddle, and seemed to hold firm with his legs. That was the way to\ndo it. And then the spurs! He would not forget the spurs. She should\nknow that he wore a spur, and that, if necessary, he would use it.\nThen he, too, gave a little click with his tongue, and an acute\nobserver might have seen the motion of his heel.\n\nTwo hours after that he was still sitting in the smoking-room,\nchewing the end of a cigar, when Doodles came down victorious from\nthe billiard-room. Archie was half asleep, and did not notice the\nentrance of his friend. \"Let her know that you're there,\" said\nDoodles, close into Archie Clavering's ear,--\"damme, let her know\nthat you're there.\" Archie started and did not like the surprise, or\nthe warm breath in his ear; but he forgave the offence for the wisdom\nof the words that had been spoken.\n\nThen he walked home by himself, repeating again and again the\ninvaluable teachings of his friend.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nCAPTAIN CLAVERING MAKES HIS FIRST ATTEMPT.\n\n\nDuring breakfast on the following day,--which means from the hour\nof one till two, for the glasses of iced gin-and-water had been\nmany,--Archie Clavering was making up his mind that he would begin at\nonce. He would go to Bolton Street on that day, and make an attempt\nto be admitted. If not admitted to-day he would make another attempt\nto-morrow, and, if still unsuccessful, he would write a letter; not a\nletter containing an offer, which according to Archie's ideas would\nnot be letting her know that he was there in a manner sufficiently\npotential,--but a letter in which he would explain that he had\nvery grave reasons for wishing to see his near and dear connexion,\nLady Ongar. Soon after two he sallied out, and he also went to a\nhairdresser's. He was aware that in doing so he was hardly obeying\nhis friend to the letter, as this sort of operation would come rather\nunder the head of handling a filly with a light touch; but he thought\nthat he could in this way, at any rate, do no harm, if he would only\nremember the instructions he had received when in the presence of the\ntrained mare. It was nearly three when he found himself in Bolton\nStreet, having calculated that Lady Ongar might be more probably\nfound at home then than at a later hour. But when he came to the\ndoor, instead of knocking, he passed by it. He began to remember that\nhe had not yet made up his mind by what means he would bring it about\nthat she should certainly know that he was there. So he took a little\nturn up the street, away from Piccadilly, through a narrow passage\nthat there is in those parts, and by some stables, and down into\nPiccadilly, and again to Bolton Street; during which little tour\nhe had made up his mind that it could hardly become his duty to\nteach her that great lesson on this occasion. She must undoubtedly\nbe taught to know that he was there, but not so taught on this, his\nfirst visit. That lesson should quickly precede his offer; and,\nalthough he had almost hoped in the interval between two of his\nbeakers of gin-and-water on the preceding evening that he might ride\nthe race and win it altogether during this very morning visit he was\nabout to make, in his cooler moments he had begun to reflect that\nthat would hardly be practicable. The mare must get a gallop before\nshe would be in a condition to be brought out. So Archie knocked at\nthe door, intending merely to give the mare a gallop if he should\nfind her in to-day.\n\nHe gave his name, and was shown at once up into Lady Ongar's\ndrawing-room. Lady Ongar was not there, but she soon came down, and\nentered the room with a smile on her face and with an outstretched\nhand. Between the man-servant who took the captain's name, and the\nmaid-servant who carried it up to her mistress,--but who did not see\nthe gentleman before she did so, there had arisen some mistake, and\nLady Ongar, as she came down from her chamber above expected that\nshe was to meet another man. Harry Clavering, she thought, had\ncome to her at last. \"I'll be down at once,\" Lady Ongar had said,\ndismissing the girl and then standing for a moment before her mirror\nas she smoothed her hair, obliterated as far as it might be possible\nthe ugliness of her cap, and shook out the folds of her dress. A\ncountess, a widow, a woman of the world who had seen enough to make\nher composed under all circumstances, one would say,--a trained mare\nas Doodles had called her,--she stood before her glass doubting\nand trembling like a girl, when she heard that Harry Clavering was\nwaiting for her below. We may surmise that she would have spared\nherself some of this trouble had she known the real name of her\nvisitor. Then, as she came slowly down the stairs, she reflected how\nshe would receive him. He had stayed away from her, and she would\nbe cold to him,--cold and formal as she had been on the railway\nplatform. She knew well how to play that part. Yes; it was his turn\nnow to show some eagerness of friendship, if there was ever to be\nanything more than friendship between them. But she changed all this\nas she put her hand upon the lock of the door. She would be honest\nto him,--honest and true. She was in truth glad to see him, and he\nshould know it. What cared she now for the common ways of women and\nthe usual coynesses of feminine coquetry? She told herself also, in\nlanguage somewhat differing from that which Doodles had used, that\nher filly days were gone by, and that she was now a trained mare. All\nthis passed through her mind as her hand was on the door; and then\nshe opened it, with a smiling face and ready hand, to find herself in\nthe presence of--Captain Archie Clavering.\n\nThe captain was sharp-sighted enough to observe the change in her\nmanner. The change, indeed, was visible enough, and was such that it\nat once knocked out of Archie's breast some portion of the courage\nwith which his friend's lessons had inspired him. The outstretched\nhand fell slowly to her side, the smile gave place to a look of\ncomposed dignity which made Archie at once feel that the fate which\ncalled upon him to woo a countess was in itself hard. And she walked\nslowly into the room before she spoke to him, or he to her.\n\n\"Captain Clavering!\" she said at last, and there was much more of\nsurprise than of welcome in her words as she uttered them.\n\n\"Yes, Lady On--, Julia, that is; I thought I might as well come and\ncall, as I found we weren't to see you at Clavering when we were all\nthere at Easter.\" When she had been living in his brother's house\nas one of the family he had called her Julia, as Hugh had done. The\nconnection between them had been close, and it had come naturally to\nhim to do so. He had thought much of this since his present project\nhad been initiated, and had strongly resolved not to lose the\nadvantage of his former familiarity. He had very nearly broken down\nat the onset, but, as the reader will have observed, had recovered\nhimself.\n\n\"You are very good,\" she said; and then as he had been some time\nstanding with his right hand presented to her, she just touched it\nwith her own.\n\n\"There's nothing I hate so much as stuff and nonsense,\" said Archie.\nTo this remark she simply bowed, remaining awfully quiet. Captain\nClavering felt that her silence was in truth awful. She had always\nbeen good at talking, and he had paused for her to say something; but\nwhen she bowed to him in that stiff manner,--\"doosed stiff she was;\ndoosed stiff, and impudent too,\" he told Doodles afterwards;--he knew\nthat he must go on himself. \"Stuff and nonsense is the mischief, you\nknow.\" Then she bowed again. \"There's been something the matter with\nthem all down at Clavering since you came home, Julia; but hang me if\nI can find out what it is!\" Still she was silent. \"It ain't Hermy;\nthat I must say. Hermy always speaks of you as though there had never\nbeen anything wrong.\" This assurance, we may say, must have been\nflattering to the lady whom he was about to court.\n\n\"Hermy was always too good to me,\" said Lady Ongar, smiling.\n\n\"By George, she always does. If there's anything wrong it's been with\nHugh; and, by George, I don't know what it is he was up to when you\nfirst came home. It wasn't my doing;--of course you know that.\"\n\n\"I never thought that anything was your doing, Captain Clavering.\"\n\n\"I think Hugh had been losing money; I do indeed. He was like a bear\nwith a sore head just at that time. There was no living in the house\nwith him. I daresay Hermy may have told you all about that.\"\n\n\"Hermione is not by nature so communicative as you are, Captain\nClavering.\"\n\n\"Isn't she? I should have thought between sisters--; but of course\nthat's no business of mine.\" Again she was silent, awfully silent,\nand he became aware that he must either get up and go away or carry\non the conversation himself. To do either seemed to be equally\ndifficult, and for a while he sat there almost gasping in his misery.\nHe was quite aware that as yet he had not made her know that he was\nthere. He was not there, as he well knew, in his friend Doodles'\nsense of the word. \"At any rate there isn't any good in quarrelling,\nis there, Julia?\" he said at last. Now that he had asked a question,\nsurely she must speak.\n\n\"There is great good sometimes I think,\" said she, \"in people\nremaining apart and not seeing each other. Sir Hugh Clavering has not\nquarrelled with me, that I am aware. Indeed, since my marriage there\nhave been no means of quarrelling between us. But I think it quite as\nwell that he and I should not come together.\"\n\n\"But he particularly wants you to go to Clavering.\"\n\n\"Has he sent you here as his messenger?\"\n\n\"Sent me! oh dear no; nothing of that sort. I have come altogether on\nmy own hook. If Hugh wants a messenger he must find some one else.\nBut you and I were always friends you know,\"--at this assertion she\nopened her large eyes widely, and simply smiled;--\"and I thought that\nperhaps you might be glad to see me if I called. That was all.\"\n\n\"You are very good, Captain Clavering.\"\n\n\"I couldn't bear to think that you should be here in London, and that\none shouldn't see anything of you or know anything about you. Tell\nme now; is there anything I can do for you? Do you want anybody to\nsettle anything for you in the city?\"\n\n\"I think not, Captain Clavering; thank you very much.\"\n\n\"Because I should be so happy; I should indeed. There's nothing I\nshould like so much as to make myself useful in some way. Isn't there\nanything now? There must be so much to be looked after,--about money\nand all that.\"\n\n\"My lawyer does all that, Captain Clavering.\"\n\n\"Those fellows are such harpies. There is no end to their charges;\nand all for doing things that would only be a pleasure to me.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't employ you in any matter that would suit your\ntastes.\"\n\n\"Can't you indeed, now?\" Then again there was a silence, and Captain\nClavering was beginning to think that he must go. He was willing\nto work hard at talking or anything else; but he could not work\nif no ground for starting were allowed to him. He thought he must\ngo, though he was aware that he had not made even the slightest\npreparation for future obedience to his friend's precepts. He began\nto feel that he had commenced wrongly. He should have made her know\nthat he was there from the first moment of her entrance into the\nroom. He must retreat now in order that he might advance with more\nforce on the next occasion. He had just made up his mind to this and\nwas doubting how he might best get himself out of his chair with the\npurpose of going, when sudden relief came in the shape of another\nvisitor. The door was thrown open and Madam Gordeloup was announced.\n\n\"Well, my angel,\" said the little woman, running up to her friend\nand kissing her on either side of her face. Then she turned round as\nthough she had only just seen the strange gentleman, and curtseyed to\nhim. Captain Clavering holding his hat in both his hands bowed to the\nlittle woman.\n\n\n[Illustration: Captain Clavering makes his first attempt.]\n\n\n\"My sister's brother-in-law, Captain Clavering,\" said Lady Ongar.\n\"Madam Gordeloup.\"\n\nCaptain Clavering bowed again. \"Ah, Sir Oo's brother,\" said Madam\nGordeloup. \"I am very glad to see Captain Clavering; and is your\nsister come?\"\n\n\"No; my sister is not come.\"\n\n\"Lady Clavering is not in town this spring,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Ah, not in town! Then I do pity her. There is only de one place to\nlive in, and that is London, for April, May, and June. Lady Clavering\nis not coming to London?\"\n\n\"Her little boy isn't quite the thing,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Not quite de ting?\" said the Franco-Pole in an inquiring voice, not\nexactly understanding the gentleman's language.\n\n\"My little nephew is ill, and my sister does not think it wise to\nbring him to London.\"\n\n\"Ah; that is a pity. And Sir Oo? Sir Oo is in London?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the captain; \"my brother has been up some time.\"\n\n\"And his lady left alone in the country? Poor lady! But your English\nladies like the country. They are fond of the fields and the daisies.\nSo they say; but I think often they lie. Me; I like the houses,\nand the people, and the pav\u00c3\u00a9. The fields are damp, and I love not\nrheumatism at all.\" Then the little woman shrugged her shoulders and\nshook herself. \"Tell us the truth, Julie; which do you like best, the\ntown or the country?\"\n\n\"Whichever I'm not in, I think.\"\n\n\"Ah, just so. Whichever you are not in at present. That is because\nyou are still idle. You have not settled yourself!\" At this reference\nto the possibility of Lady Ongar settling herself, Captain Clavering\npricked up his ears, and listened eagerly for what might come next.\nHe only knew of one way in which a young woman without a husband\ncould settle herself. \"You must wait, my dear, a little longer, just\na little longer, till the time of your trouble has passed by.\"\n\n\"Don't talk such nonsense, Sophie,\" said the countess.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, it is no nonsense. I am always telling her, Captain\nClavering, that she must go through this black, troublesome time as\nquick as she can; and then nobody will enjoy the town so much as de\nrich and beautiful Lady Ongar. Is it not so, Captain Clavering?\"\n\nArchie thought that the time had now come for him to say something\npretty, so that his love might begin to know that he was there. \"By\nGeorge, yes, there'll be nobody so much admired when she comes out\nagain. There never was anybody so much admired before,--before,--that\nis, when you were Julia Brabazon, you know; and I shouldn't wonder if\nyou didn't come out quite as strong as ever.\"\n\n\"As strong!\" said the Franco-Pole. \"A woman that has been married is\nalways more admired than a meess.\"\n\n\"Sophie, might I ask you and Captain Clavering to be a little less\npersonal?\"\n\n\"There is noting I hate so much as your meesses,\" continued Madame\nGordeloup; \"noting! Your English meesses give themselves such airs.\nNow in Paris, or in dear Vienna, or in St. Petersburg, they are not\nlike that at all. There they are nobodies--they are nobodies; but\nthen they will be something very soon, which is to be better. Your\nEnglish meess is so much and so grand; she never can be greater and\ngrander. So when she is a mamma, she lives down in the country by\nherself, and looks after de pills and de powders. I don't like that.\nI don't like that at all. No; if my husband had put me into the\ncountry to look after de pills and de powders, he should have had\nthem all, all--himself, when he came to see me.\" As she said this\nwith great energy, she opened her eyes wide, and looked full into\nArchie's face.\n\nCaptain Clavering, who was sitting with his hat in his two hands\nbetween his knees, stared at the little foreigner. He had heard\nbefore of women poisoning their husbands, but never had heard a woman\nadvocate the system as expedient. Nor had he often heard a woman\nadvocate any system with the vehemence which Madame Gordeloup now\ndisplayed on this matter, and with an allusion which was so very\npointed to the special position of his own sister-in-law. Did Lady\nOngar agree with her? He felt as though he should like to know his\nJulia's opinions on that matter.\n\n\"Sophie, Captain Clavering will think you are in earnest,\" said the\ncountess, laughing.\n\n\"So I am--in earnest. It is all wrong. You boil all the water out of\nde pot before you put the gigot into it. So the gigot is no good, is\ntough and dry, and you shut it up in an old house in the country.\nThen, to make matters pretty, you talk about de fields and de\ndaisies. I know. 'Thank you,' I should say. 'De fields and de daisies\nare so nice and so good! Suppose you go down, my love, and walk in de\nfields, and pick de daisies, and send them up to me by de railway!'\nYes, that is what I would say.\"\n\nCaptain Clavering was now quite in the dark, and began to regard the\nlittle woman as a lunatic. When she spoke of the pot and the gigot\nhe vainly endeavoured to follow her; and now that she had got among\nthe daisies he was more at a loss than ever. Fruit, vegetables, and\ncut flowers came up, he knew, to London regularly from Clavering,\nwhen the family was in town;--but no daisies. In France it must, he\nsupposed, be different. He was aware, however, of his ignorance, and\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"No one ever did try to shut you up, Sophie!\"\n\n\"No, indeed; M. Gordeloup knew better. What would he do if I were\nshut up? And no one will ever shut you up, my dear. If I were you,\nI would give no one a chance.\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" said the captain, almost passionately; \"don't say\nthat.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! but I do say it. Why should a woman who has got everything\nmarry again? If she wants de fields and de daisies she has got them\nof her own--yes, of her own. If she wants de town, she has got\nthat too. Jewels,--she can go and buy them. Coaches,--there they\nare. Parties,--one, two, three, every night, as many as she please.\nGentlemen who will be her humble slaves; such a plenty,--all London.\nOr, if she want to be alone, no one can come near her. Why should she\nmarry? No.\"\n\n\"But she might be in love with somebody,\" said the captain, in a\nsurprised but humble tone.\n\n\"Love! Bah! Be in love, so that she may be shut up in an old barrack\nwith de powders!\" The way in which that word barrack was pronounced,\nand the middle letters sounded, almost lifted the captain off his\nseat. \"Love is very pretty at seventeen, when the imagination is\ntelling a parcel of lies, and when life is one dream. To like\npeople,--oh, yes; to be very fond of your friends,--oh, yes; to be\nmost attached,--as I am to my Julie,\"--here she got hold of Lady\nOngar's hand,--\"it is the salt of life! But what you call love,\nbooing and cooing, with rhymes and verses about de moon, it is to go\nback to pap and panade, and what you call bibs. No; if a woman wants\na house, and de something to live on, let her marry a husband; or if\na man want to have children, let him marry a wife. But to be shut up\nin a country house, when everything you have got of your own,--I say\nit is bad.\"\n\nCaptain Clavering was heartily sorry that he had mentioned the fact\nof his sister-in-law being left at home at Clavering Park. It was\nmost unfortunate. How could he make it understood that if he were\nmarried he would not think of shutting his wife up at Ongar Park?\n\"Lady Clavering, you know, does come to London generally,\" he said.\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the little Franco-Pole.\n\n\"And as for me, I never should be happy, if I were married, unless I\nhad my wife with me everywhere,\" said Captain Clavering.\n\n\"Bah-ah-ah!\" ejaculated the lady.\n\nCaptain Clavering could not endure this any longer. He felt that the\nmanner of the lady was, to say the least of it, unpleasant, and he\nperceived that he was doing no good to his own cause. So he rose from\nhis chair and muttered some words with the intention of showing his\npurpose of departure.\n\n\"Good-by, Captain Clavering,\" said Lady Ongar. \"My love to my sister\nwhen you see her.\"\n\nArchie shook hands with her and then made his bow to Madame\nGordeloup.\n\n\"Au revoir, my friend,\" she said, \"and you remember all I say. It is\nnot good for de wife to be all alone in the country, while de husband\nwalk about in the town and make an eye to every lady he see.\" Archie\nwould not trust himself to renew the argument, but bowing again, made\nhis way off.\n\n\"He was come for one admirer,\" said Sophie, as soon as the door was\nclosed.\n\n\"An admirer of whom?\"\n\n\"Not of me;--oh, no; I was not in danger at all.\"\n\n\"Of me? Captain Clavering! Sophie, you get your head full of the\nstrangest nonsense.\"\n\n\"Ah; very well. You see. What will you give me if I am right? Will\nyou bet? Why had he got on his new gloves, and had his head all\nsmelling with stuff from de hairdresser? Does he come always perfumed\nlike that? Does he wear shiny little boots to walk about in de\nmorning, and make an eye always? Perhaps yes.\"\n\n\"I never saw his boots or his eyes.\"\n\n\"But I see them. I see many things. He come to have Ongere Park for\nhis own. I tell you, yes. Ten thousand will come to have Ongere Park.\nWhy not? To have Ongere Park and all de money a man will make himself\nsmell a great deal.\"\n\n\"You think much more about all that than is necessary.\"\n\n\"Do I, my dear? Very well. There are three already. There is Edouard,\nand there is this Clavering who you say is a captain; and there\nis the other Clavering who goes with his nose in the air, and who\nthink himself a clever fellow because he learned his lesson at\nschool and did not get himself whipped. He will be whipped yet some\nday,--perhaps.\"\n\n\"Sophie, hold your tongue. Captain Clavering is my sister's\nbrother-in-law, and Harry Clavering is my friend.\"\n\n\"Ah, friend! I know what sort of friend he wants to be. How much\nbetter to have a park and plenty of money than to work in a ditch and\nmake a railway! But he do not know the way with a woman. Perhaps he\nmay be more at home, as you say, in the ditch. I should say to him,\n'My friend, you will do well in de ditch if you work hard;--suppose\nyou stay there.'\"\n\n\"You don't seem to like my cousin, and if you please, we will talk no\nmore about him.\"\n\n\"Why should I not like him? He don't want to get any money from me.\"\n\n\"That will do, Sophie.\"\n\n\"Very well; it shall do for me. But this other man that come here\nto-day. He is a fool.\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"He did not learn his lesson without whipping.\"\n\n\"Nor with whipping either.\"\n\n\"No; he have learned nothing. He does not know what to do with his\nhat. He is a fool. Come, Julie, will you take me out for a drive. It\nis melancholy for you to go alone; I came to ask you for a drive.\nShall we go?\" And they did go, Lady Ongar and Sophie Gordeloup\ntogether. Lady Ongar, as she submitted, despised herself for her\nsubmission; but what was she to do? It is sometimes very difficult to\nescape from the meshes of friendship.\n\nCaptain Clavering, when he left Bolton Street, went down to his\nclub, having first got rid of his shining boots and new gloves. He\nsauntered up into the billiard-room knowing that his friend would be\nthere, and there he found Doodles with his coat off, the sleeves of\nhis shirt turned back, and armed with his cue. His brother captain,\nthe moment that he saw him, presented the cue at his breast. \"Does\nshe know you're there, old fellow; I say, does she know you're\nthere?\" The room was full of men, and the whole thing was done so\npublicly that Captain Clavering was almost offended.\n\n\"Come, Doodles, you go on with your game,\" said he; \"it's you to\nplay.\" Doodles turned to the table, and scientifically pocketed the\nball on which he played; then he laid his own ball close under the\ncushion, picked up a shilling and put it into his waistcoat pocket,\nholding a lighted cigar in his mouth the while, and then he came back\nto his friend. \"Well, Clavvy, how has it been?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing as yet, you know.\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've seen her, of course. I'm not the fellow to let the grass\ngrow under my feet. I've only just come from her house.\"\n\n\"Well, well?\"\n\n\"That's nothing much to tell the first day, you know.\"\n\n\"Did you let her know you were there? That's the chat. Damme, did you\nlet her know you were there?\"\n\nIn answer to this Archie attempted to explain that he was not as yet\nquite sure that he had been successful in that particular; but in\nthe middle of his story Captain Doodles was called off to exercise\nhis skill again, and on this occasion to pick up two shillings. \"I'm\nsorry for you, Griggs,\" he said, as a very young lieutenant, whose\nlast life he had taken, put up his cue with a look of ineffable\ndisgust, and whose shilling Doodles had pocketed; \"I'm sorry for you,\nvery; but a fellow must play the game, you know.\" Whereupon Griggs\nwalked out of the room with a gait that seemed to show that he had\nhis own ideas upon that matter, though he did not choose to divulge\nthem. Doodles instantly returned to his friend. \"With cattle of that\nkind it's no use trying the waiting dodge,\" said he. \"You should make\nyour running at once, and trust to bottom to carry you through.\"\n\n\"But there was a horrid little Frenchwoman came in!\"\n\n\"What; a servant?\"\n\n\"No; a friend. Such a creature! You should have heard her talk. A\nkind of confidential friend she seemed, who called her Julie. I had\nto go away and leave her there, of course.\"\n\n\"Ah! you'll have to tip that woman.\"\n\n\"What, with money?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder.\"\n\n\"It would come very expensive.\"\n\n\"A tenner now and then, you know. She would do your business for you.\nGive her a brooch first, and then offer to lend her the money. You'd\nfind she'll rise fast enough, if you're any hand for throwing a fly.\"\n\n\"Oh! I could do it, you know.\"\n\n\"Do it then, and let 'em both know that you're there. Yes, Parkyns,\nI'll divide. And, Clavvy, you can come in now in Griggs' place.\" Then\nCaptain Clavering stripped himself for the battle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE BLUE POSTS.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\n\"Oh; so you 'ave come to see me. I am so glad.\" With these words\nSophie Gordeloup welcomed Harry Clavering to her room in Mount Street\nearly one morning not long after her interview with Captain Archie\nin Lady Ongar's presence. On the previous evening Harry had received\na note from Lady Ongar, in which she upbraided him for having left\nunperformed her commission with reference to Count Pateroff. The\nletter had begun quite abruptly. \"I think it unkind of you that you\ndo not come to me. I asked you to see a certain person on my behalf,\nand you have not done so. Twice he has been here. Once I was in truth\nout. He came again the next evening at nine, and I was then ill,\nand had gone to bed. You understand it all, and must know how this\nannoys me. I thought you would have done this for me, and I thought I\nshould have seen you.--J.\" This note he found at his lodgings when he\nreturned home at night, and on the following morning he went in his\ndespair direct to Mount Street, on his way to the Adelphi. It was not\nyet ten o'clock when he was shown into Madame Gordeloup's presence,\nand as regarded her dress he did not find her to be quite prepared\nfor morning visitors. But he might well be indifferent on that\nmatter, as the lady seemed to disregard the circumstances altogether.\nOn her head she wore what he took to be a nightcap, though I will\nnot absolutely undertake to say that she had slept in that very\nhead-dress. There were frills to it, and a certain attempt at\nprettinesses had been made; but then the attempt had been made so\nlong ago, and the frills were so ignorant of starch and all frillish\npropensities, that it hardly could pretend to decency. A great white\nwrapper she also wore, which might not have been objectionable had\nit not been so long worn that it looked like a university college\nsurplice at the end of the long vacation. Her slippers had all the\nease which age could give them, and above the slippers, neatness, to\nsay the least of it, did not predominate. But Sophie herself seemed\nto be quite at her ease in spite of these deficiencies, and received\nour hero with an eager, pointed welcome, which I can hardly describe\nas affectionate, and which Harry did not at all understand.\n\n\"I have to apologize for troubling you,\" he began.\n\n\"Trouble, what trouble? Bah! You give me no trouble. It is you have\nthe trouble to come here. You come early and I have not got my\ncrinoline. If you are contented, so am I.\" Then she smiled, and sat\nherself down suddenly, letting herself almost fall into her special\ncorner in the sofa. \"Take a chair, Mr. Harry; then we can talk more\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"I want especially to see your brother. Can you give me his address?\"\n\n\"What? Edouard--certainly; Travellers' Club.\"\n\n\"But he is never there.\"\n\n\"He sends every day for his letters. You want to see him. Why?\"\n\nHarry was at once confounded, having no answer. \"A little private\nbusiness,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah; a little private business. You do not owe him a little money,\nI am afraid, or you would not want to see him. Ha, ha! You write to\nhim, and he will see you. There;--there is paper and pen and ink. He\nshall get your letter this day.\"\n\nHarry, nothing suspicious, did as he was bid, and wrote a note in\nwhich he simply told the count that he was specially desirous of\nseeing him.\n\n\"I will go to you anywhere,\" said Harry, \"if you will name a place.\"\n\nWe, knowing Madame Gordeloup's habits, may feel little doubt but that\nshe thought it her duty to become acquainted with the contents of the\nnote before she sent it out of her house, but we may also know that\nshe learned very little from it.\n\n\"It shall go, almost immediately,\" said Sophie, when the envelope was\nclosed.\n\nThen Harry got up to depart, having done his work. \"What, you are\ngoing in that way at once? You are in a hurry?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I am in a hurry, rather, Madame Gordeloup. I have got\nto be at my office, and I only just came up here to find out your\nbrother's address.\" Then he rose and went, leaving the note behind\nhim.\n\nThen Madame Gordeloup, speaking to herself in French, called Harry\nClavering a lout, a fool, an awkward overgrown boy, and a pig. She\ndeclared him to be a pig nine times over, then shook herself in\nviolent disgust, and after that betook herself to the letter.\n\nThe letter was at any rate duly sent to the count, for before Harry\nhad left Mr. Beilby's chambers on that day, Pateroff came to him\nthere. Harry sat in the same room with other men, and therefore went\nout to see his acquaintance in a little antechamber that was used\nfor such purposes. As he walked from one room to the other, he was\nconscious of the delicacy and difficulty of the task before him, and\nthe colour was high in his face as he opened the door. But when he\nhad done so, he saw that the count was not alone. A gentleman was\nwith him, whom he did not introduce to Harry, and before whom Harry\ncould not say that which he had to communicate.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said the count, \"but we are in railroad hurry. Nobody\never was in such a haste as I and my friend. You are not engaged\nto-morrow? No, I see. You dine with me and my friend at the Blue\nPosts. You know the Blue Posts?\"\n\nHarry said he did not know the Blue Posts.\n\n\"Then you shall know the Blue Posts. I will be your instructor. You\ndrink claret. Come and see. You eat beefsteaks. Come and try. You\nlove one glass of port wine with your cheese. No. But you shall\nlove it when you have dined with me at the Blue Posts. We will dine\naltogether after the English way;--which is the best way in the world\nwhen it is quite good. It is quite good at the Blue Posts;--quite\ngood! Seven o'clock. You are fined when a minute late; an extra glass\nof port wine a minute. Now I must go. Ah; yes. I am ruined already.\"\n\nThen Count Pateroff, holding his watch in his hand, bolted out of the\nroom before Harry could say a word to him.\n\nHe had nothing for it but to go to the dinner, and to the dinner he\nwent. On that same evening, the evening of the day on which he had\nseen Sophie and her brother, he wrote to Lady Ongar, using to her\nthe same manner of writing that she had used to him, and telling her\nthat he had done his best, that he had now seen him whom he had been\ndesired to see, but that he had not been able to speak to him. He\nwas, however, to dine with him on the following day,--and would call\nin Bolton Street as soon as possible after that interview.\n\nExactly at seven o'clock, Harry, having the fear of the threatened\nfine before his eyes, was at the Blue Posts; and there, standing in\nthe middle of the room, he saw Count Pateroff. With Count Pateroff\nwas the same gentleman whom Harry had seen at the Adelphi, and whom\nthe count now introduced as Colonel Schmoff; and also a little\nEnglishman with a knowing eye and a bull-dog neck, and whiskers\ncut very short and trim,--a horsey little man, whom the count also\nintroduced. \"Captain Boodle; says he knows a cousin of yours, Mr.\nClavering.\"\n\nThen Colonel Schmoff bowed, never yet having spoken a word in Harry's\nhearing, and our old friend Doodles with glib volubility told Harry\nhow intimate he was with Archie, and how he knew Sir Hugh, and how he\nhad met Lady Clavering, and how \"doosed\" glad he was to meet Harry\nhimself on this present occasion.\n\n\"And now, my boys, we'll set down,\" said the count. \"There's just a\nlittle soup, printanier; yes, they can make soup here; then a cut of\nsalmon; and after that the beefsteak. Nothing more. Schmoff, my boy,\ncan you eat beefsteak?\"\n\nSchmoff neither smiled nor spoke, but simply bowed his head gravely,\nand sitting down, arranged with slow exactness his napkin over his\nwaistcoat and lap.\n\n\"Captain Boodle, can you eat beefsteak,\" said the count; \"Blue Posts'\nbeefsteak?\"\n\n\"Try me,\" said Doodles. \"That's all. Try me.\"\n\n\"I will try you, and I will try Mr. Clavering. Schmoff would eat a\nhorse if he had not a bullock, and a piece of a jackass if he had not\na horse.\"\n\n\"I did eat a horse in Hamboro' once. We was besieged.\"\n\nSo much said Schmoff, very slowly, in a deep bass voice, speaking\nfrom the bottom of his chest, and frowning very heavily as he did so.\nThe exertion was so great that he did not repeat it for a\nconsiderable time.\n\n\"Thank God we are not besieged now,\" said the count, as the soup was\nhanded round to them. \"Ah, Albert, my friend, that is good soup; very\ngood soup. My compliments to the excellent Stubbs. Mr. Clavering, the\nexcellent Stubbs is the cook. I am quite at home here and they do\ntheir best for me. You need not fear you will have any of Schmoff's\nhorse.\"\n\nThis was all very pleasant, and Harry Clavering sat down to his\ndinner prepared to enjoy it; but there was a sense about him during\nthe whole time that he was being taken in and cheated, and that\nthe count would cheat him and actually escape away from him on\nthat evening without his being able to speak a word to him. They\nwere dining in a public room, at a large table which they had to\nthemselves, while others were dining at small tables round them.\nEven if Schmoff and Boodle had not been there, he could hardly have\ndiscussed Lady Ongar's private affairs in such a room as that. The\ncount had brought him there to dine in this way with a premeditated\npurpose of throwing him over, pretending to give him the meeting that\nhad been asked for, but intending that it should pass by and be of no\navail. Such was Harry's belief, and he resolved that, though he might\nhave to seize Pateroff by the tails of his coat, the count should not\nescape him without having been forced at any rate to hear what he had\nto say. In the meantime the dinner went on very pleasantly.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the count, \"there is no fish like salmon early in the\nyear; but not too early. And it should come alive from Grove, and be\ncooked by Stubbs.\"\n\n\"And eaten by me,\" said Boodle.\n\n\"Under my auspices,\" said the count, \"and then all is well. Mr.\nClavering, a little bit near the head? Not care about any particular\npart? That is wrong. Everybody should always learn what is the best\nto eat of everything, and get it if they can.\"\n\n\"By George, I should think so,\" said Doodles. \"I know I do.\"\n\n\"Not to know the bit out of the neck of the salmon from any other\nbit, is not to know a false note from a true one. Not to distinguish\na '51 wine from a '58, is to look at an arm or a leg on the canvas,\nand to care nothing whether it is in drawing, or out of drawing. Not\nto know Stubbs' beefsteak from other beefsteaks, is to say that every\nwoman is the same thing to you. Only, Stubbs will let you have his\nbeefsteak if you will pay him,--him or his master. With the beautiful\nwoman it is not always so;--not always. Do I make myself understood?\"\n\n\"Clear as mud,\" said Doodles. \"I'm quite along with you there. Why\nshould a man be ashamed of eating what's nice? Everybody does it.\"\n\n\"No, Captain Boodle; not everybody. Some cannot get it, and some do\nnot know it when it comes in their way. They are to be pitied. I do\npity them from the bottom of my heart. But there is one poor fellow\nI do pity more even than they.\"\n\nThere was something in the tone of the count's words,--a simple\npathos, and almost a melody, which interested Harry Clavering. No one\nknew better than Count Pateroff how to use all the inflexions of his\nvoice, and produce from the phrases he used the very highest interest\nwhich they were capable of producing. He now spoke of his pity in a\nway that might almost have made a sensitive man weep. \"Who is it that\nyou pity so much?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"The man who cannot digest,\" said the count, in a low clear voice.\nThen he bent down his head over the morsel of food on his plate,\nas though he were desirous of hiding a tear. \"The man who cannot\ndigest!\" As he repeated the words he raised his head again, and\nlooked round at all their faces.\n\n\"Yes, yes;--mein Gott, yes,\" said Schmoff, and even he appeared as\nthough he were almost moved from the deep quietude of his inward\nindifference.\n\n\"Ah; talk of blessings! What a blessing is digestion!\" said the\ncount. \"I do not know whether you have ever thought of it, Captain\nBoodle? You are young, and perhaps not. Or you, Mr. Clavering? It is\na subject worthy of your thoughts. To digest! Do you know what it\nmeans? It is to have the sun always shining, and the shade always\nready for you. It is to be met with smiles, and to be greeted with\nkisses. It is to hear sweet sounds, to sleep with sweet dreams, to\nbe touched ever by gentle, soft, cool hands. It is to be in paradise.\nAdam and Eve were in paradise. Why? Their digestion was good. Ah!\nthen they took liberties, eat bad fruit,--things they could not\ndigest. They what we call, ruined their constitutions, destroyed\ntheir gastric juices, and then they were expelled from paradise by an\nangel with a flaming sword. The angel with the flaming sword, which\nturned two ways, was indigestion! There came a great indigestion upon\nthe earth because the cooks were bad, and they called it a deluge.\nAh, I thank God there is to be no more deluges. All the evils come\nfrom this. Macbeth could not sleep. It was the supper, not the\nmurder. His wife talked and walked. It was the supper again. Milton\nhad a bad digestion because he is always so cross; and your Carlyle\nmust have the worst digestion in the world, because he never says\nany good of anything. Ah, to digest is to be happy! Believe me, my\nfriends, there is no other way not to be turned out of paradise by a\nfiery two-handed turning sword.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Schmoff; \"yes, it is true.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Doodles. \"And how well the count describes it,\ndon't he, Mr. Clavering? I never looked at it in that light; but,\nafter all, digestion is everything. What is a horse worth, if he\nwon't feed?\"\n\n\"I never thought much about it,\" said Harry.\n\n\"That is very good,\" said the great preacher. \"Not to think about it\never is the best thing in the world. You will be made to think about\nit if there be necessity. A friend of mine told me he did not know\nwhether he had a digestion. My friend, I said, you are like the\nhusbandmen; you do not know your own blessings. A bit more steak, Mr.\nClavering; see, it has come up hot, just to prove that you have the\nblessing.\"\n\nThere was a pause in the conversation for a minute or two, during\nwhich Schmoff and Doodles were very busy giving the required proof;\nand the count was leaning back in his chair, with a smile of\nconscious wisdom on his face, looking as though he were in deep\nconsideration of the subject on which he had just spoken with so much\neloquence. Harry did not interrupt the silence, as, foolishly, he was\nallowing his mind to carry itself away from the scene of enjoyment\nthat was present, and trouble itself with the coming battle which he\nwould be obliged to fight with the count. Schmoff was the first to\nspeak. \"When I was eating a horse at Hamboro'--\" he began.\n\n\"Schmoff,\" said the count, \"if we allow you to get behind the\nramparts of that besieged city, we shall have to eat that horse for\nthe rest of the evening. Captain Boodle, if you will believe me, I\neat that horse once for two hours. Ah, here is the port wine. Now,\nMr. Clavering, this is the wine for cheese;--'34. No man should drink\nabove two glasses of '34. If you want port after that, then have\n'20.\"\n\nSchmoff had certainly been hardly treated. He had scarcely spoken a\nword during dinner, and should, I think, have been allowed to say\nsomething of the flavour of the horse. It did not, however, appear\nfrom his countenance that he had felt, or that he resented the\ninterference; though he did not make any further attempt to enliven\nthe conversation.\n\nThey did not sit long over their wine, and the count, in spite of\nwhat he had said about the claret, did not drink any. \"Captain\nBoodle,\" he said, \"you must respect my weakness as well as my\nstrength. I know what I can do, and what I cannot. If I were a real\nhero, like you English,--which means, if I had an ostrich in my\ninside,--I would drink till twelve every night, and eat broiled\nbones till six every morning. But alas! the ostrich has not been\ngiven to me. As a common man I am pretty well, but I have no heroic\ncapacities. We will have a little chasse, and then we will smoke.\"\n\nHarry began to be very nervous. How was he to do it? It had become\nclearer and clearer to him through every ten minutes of the dinner,\nthat the count did not intend to give him any moment for private\nconversation. He felt that he was cheated and ill-used, and was\nwaxing angry. They were to go and smoke in a public room, and he\nknew, or thought he knew, what that meant. The count would sit there\ntill he went, and had brought the Colonel Schmoff with him, so that\nhe might be sure of some ally to remain by his side and ensure\nsilence. And the count, doubtless, had calculated that when Captain\nBoodle went, as he soon would go, to his billiards, he, Harry\nClavering, would feel himself compelled to go also. No! It should not\nresult in that way. Harry resolved that he would not go. He had his\nmission to perform and he would perform it, even if he were compelled\nto do so in the presence of Colonel Schmoff.\n\nDoodles soon went. He could not sit long with the simple\ngratification of a cigar, without gin-and-water or other comfort\nof that kind, even though the eloquence of Count Pateroff might be\nexcited in his favour. He was a man, indeed, who did not love to sit\nstill, even with the comfort of gin-and-water. An active little man\nwas Captain Boodle, always doing something or anxious to do something\nin his own line of business. Small speculations in money, so\nconcocted as to leave the risk against him smaller than the chance on\nhis side, constituted Captain Boodle's trade; and in that trade he\nwas indefatigable, ingenious, and, to a certain extent, successful.\nThe worst of the trade was this: that though he worked at it above\ntwelve hours a day, to the exclusion of all other interests in\nlife, he could only make out of it an income which would have been\nconsidered a beggarly failure at any other profession. When he netted\na pound a day he considered himself to have done very well; but he\ncould not do that every day in the week. To do it often required\nunremitting exertion. And then, in spite of all his care, misfortunes\nwould come. \"A cursed garron, of whom nobody had ever heard the name!\nIf a man mayn't take a liberty with such a brute as that, when is\nhe to take a liberty?\" So had he expressed himself plaintively,\nendeavouring to excuse himself, when on some occasion a race had been\nwon by some outside horse which Captain Boodle had omitted to make\nsafe in his betting-book. He was regarded by his intimate friends\nas a very successful man; but I think myself that his life was a\nmistake. To live with one's hands ever daubed with chalk from a\nbilliard-table, to be always spying into stables and rubbing against\ngrooms, to put up with the narrow lodgings which needy men encounter\nat race meetings, to be day after day on the rails running after\nplaters and steeplechasers, to be conscious on all occasions of the\nexpediency of selling your beast when you are hunting, to be counting\nup little odds at all your spare moments;--these things do not, I\nthink, make a satisfactory life for a young man. And for a man that\nis not young, they are the very devil! Better have no digestion when\nyou are forty than find yourself living such a life as that! Captain\nBoodle would, I think, have been happier had he contrived to get\nhimself employed as a tax-gatherer or an attorney's clerk.\n\nOn this occasion Doodles soon went, as had been expected, and Harry\nfound himself smoking with the two foreigners. Pateroff was no longer\neloquent, but sat with his cigar in his mouth as silent as Colonel\nSchmoff himself. It was evidently expected of Harry that he should\ngo.\n\n\"Count,\" he said at last, \"you got my note?\" There were seven or\neight persons sitting in the room besides the party of three to which\nHarry belonged.\n\n\"Your note, Mr. Clavering! which note? Oh, yes; I should not have had\nthe pleasure of seeing you here to-day but for that.\"\n\n\"Can you give me five minutes in private?\"\n\n\"What! now! here! this evening! after dinner? Another time I will\ntalk with you by the hour together.\"\n\n\"I fear I must trouble you now. I need not remind you that I could\nnot keep you yesterday morning; you were so much hurried.\"\n\n\"And now I am having my little moment of comfort! These special\nbusiness conversations after dinner are so bad for the digestion!\"\n\n\"If I could have caught you before dinner, Count Pateroff, I would\nhave done so.\"\n\n\"If it must be, it must. Schmoff, will you wait for me ten minutes?\nI will not be more than ten minutes.\" And the count as he made this\npromise looked at his watch. \"Waiter,\" he said, speaking in a sharp\ntone which Harry had not heard before, \"show this gentleman and\nme into a private room.\" Harry got up and led the way out, not\nforgetting to assure himself that he cared nothing for the sharpness\nof the count's voice.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Clavering, what is it?\" said the count, looking full into\nHarry's eye.\n\n\"I will tell you in two words.\"\n\n\"In one if you can.\"\n\n\"I came with a message to you from Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"Why are you a messenger from Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"I have known her long and she is connected with my family.\"\n\n\"Why does she not send her messages by Sir Hugh,--her\nbrother-in-law?\"\n\n\"It is hardly for you to ask that!\"\n\n\"Yes; it is for me to ask that. I have known Lady Ongar well, and\nhave treated her with kindness. I do not want to have messages by\nanybody. But go on. If you are a messenger, give your message.\"\n\n\"Lady Ongar bids me tell you that she cannot see you.\"\n\n\"But she must see me. She shall see me!\"\n\n\"I am to explain to you that she declines to do so. Surely, Count\nPateroff, you must understand--\"\n\n\"Ah, bah; I understand everything;--in such matters as these, better,\nperhaps, than you, Mr. Clavering. You have given your message. Now,\nas you are a messenger, will you give mine?\"\n\n\"That will depend altogether on its nature.\"\n\n\"Sir, I never send uncivil words to a woman, though sometimes I\nmay be tempted to speak them to a man; when, for instance, a man\ninterferes with me; do you understand? My message is this:--tell her\nladyship, with my compliments, that it will be better for her to see\nme,--better for her, and for me. When that poor lord died,--and he\nhad been, mind, my friend for many years before her ladyship had\nheard his name,--I was with him; and there were occurrences of which\nyou know nothing and need know nothing. I did my best then to be\ncourteous to Lady Ongar, which she returns by shutting her door in\nmy face. I do not mind that. I am not angry with a woman. But tell\nher that when she has heard what I now say to her by you, she will,\nI do not doubt, think better of it; and therefore I shall do myself\nthe honour of presenting myself at her door again. Good-night, Mr.\nClavering; au revoir; we will have another of Stubbs' little dinners\nbefore long.\" As he spoke these last words the count's voice was\nagain changed, and the old smile had returned to his face.\n\nHarry shook hands with him and walked away homewards, not without a\nfeeling that the count had got the better of him, even to the end.\nHe had, however, learned how the land lay, and could explain to Lady\nOngar that Count Pateroff now knew her wishes and was determined to\ndisregard them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nDESOLATION.\n\n\nIn the meantime there was grief down at the great house of Clavering;\nand grief, we must suppose also, at the house in Berkeley Square,\nas soon as the news from his country home had reached Sir Hugh\nClavering. Little Hughy, his heir, was dead. Early one morning, Mrs.\nClavering, at the rectory, received a message from Lady Clavering,\nbegging that she would go up to the house, and, on arriving there,\nshe found that the poor child was very ill. The doctor was then at\nClavering, and had recommended that a message should be sent to the\nfather in London, begging him to come down. This message had been\nalready despatched when Mrs. Clavering arrived. The poor mother was\nin a state of terrible agony, but at that time there was yet hope.\nMrs. Clavering then remained with Lady Clavering for two or three\nhours; but just before dinner on the same day another messenger came\nacross to say that hope was past, and that the child had gone. Could\nMrs. Clavering come over again, as Lady Clavering was in a sad way?\n\n\"You'll have your dinner first?\" said the rector.\n\n\"No, I think not. I shall wish to make her take something, and I can\ndo it better if I ask for tea for myself. I will go at once. Poor\ndear little boy.\"\n\n\"It was a blow I always feared,\" said the rector to his daughter as\nsoon as his wife had left them. \"Indeed, I knew that it was coming.\"\n\n\"And she was always fearing it,\" said Fanny. \"But I do not think he\ndid. He never seems to think that evil will come to him.\"\n\n\"He will feel this,\" said the rector.\n\n\"Feel it, papa! Of course he will feel it.\"\n\n\"I do not think he would,--not deeply, that is,--if there were four\nor five of them. He is a hard man;--the hardest man I ever knew. Who\never saw him playing with his own child, or with any other? Who ever\nheard him say a soft word to his wife? But he will be hit now, for\nthis child was his heir. He will be hit hard now, and I pity him.\"\n\nMrs. Clavering went across the park alone, and soon found herself in\nthe poor bereaved mother's room. She was sitting by herself, having\ndriven the old housekeeper away from her; and there were no traces\nof tears then on her face, though she had wept plentifully when Mrs.\nClavering had been with her in the morning. But there had come upon\nher suddenly a look of age, which nothing but such sorrow as this can\nproduce. Mrs. Clavering was surprised to see that she had dressed\nherself carefully since the morning, as was her custom to do daily,\neven when alone; and that she was not in her bedroom, but in a small\nsitting-room which she generally used when Sir Hugh was not at the\npark.\n\n\"My poor Hermione,\" said Mrs. Clavering, coming up to her, and taking\nher by the hand.\n\n\"Yes, I am poor; poor enough. Why have they troubled you to come\nacross again?\"\n\n\"Did you not send for me? But it was quite right, whether you sent or\nno. Of course I should come when I heard it. It cannot be good for\nyou to be all alone.\"\n\n\"I suppose he will be here to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes, if he got your message before three o'clock.\"\n\n\"Oh, he will have received it, and I suppose he will come. You think\nhe will come, eh?\"\n\n\"Of course he will come.\"\n\n\"I do not know. He does not like coming to the country.\"\n\n\"He will be sure to come now, Hermione.\"\n\n\"And who will tell him? Some one must tell him before he comes to\nme. Should there not be some one to tell him? They have sent another\nmessage.\"\n\n\"Hannah shall be at hand to tell him.\" Hannah was the old housekeeper\nwho had been in the family when Sir Hugh was born. \"Or, if you wish\nit, Henry shall come down and remain here. I am sure he will do so,\nif it will be a comfort.\"\n\n\"No; he would, perhaps, be rough to Mr. Clavering. He is so very\nhard. Hannah shall do it. Will you make her understand?\" Mrs.\nClavering promised that she would do this, wondering, as she did so,\nat the wretched, frigid immobility of the unfortunate woman before\nher. She knew Lady Clavering well;--knew her to be in many things\nweak, to be worldly, listless, and perhaps somewhat selfish; but she\nknew also that she had loved her child as mothers always love. Yet,\nat this moment, it seemed that she was thinking more of her husband\nthan of the bairn she had lost. Mrs. Clavering had sat down by her\nand taken her hand, and was still so sitting in silence when Lady\nClavering spoke again. \"I suppose he will turn me out of his house\nnow,\" she said.\n\n\"Who will do so? Hugh? Oh, Hermione, how can you speak in such a\nway?\"\n\n\"He scolded me before because my poor darling was not strong. My\ndarling! How could I help it? And he scolded me because there was\nnone other but he. He will turn me out altogether now. Oh, Mrs.\nClavering, you do not know how hard he is.\"\n\nAnything was better than this, and therefore Mrs. Clavering asked the\npoor woman to take her into the room where the little body lay in\nits little cot. If she could induce the mother to weep for the child,\neven that would be better than this hard persistent fear as to what\nher husband would say and do. So they both went and stood together\nover the little fellow whose short sufferings had thus been brought\nto an end. \"My poor dear, what can I say to comfort you?\" Mrs.\nClavering, as she asked this, knew well that no comfort could be\nspoken in words; but--if she could only make the sufferer weep!\n\n\"Comfort!\" said the mother. \"There is no comfort now, I believe,\nin anything. It is long since I knew any comfort;--not since Julia\nwent.\"\n\n\"Have you written to Julia?\"\n\n\"No; I have written to no one. I cannot write. I feel as though if it\nwere to bring him back again I could not write of it. My boy! my boy!\nmy boy!\" But still there was not a tear in her eye.\n\n\"I will write to Julia,\" said Mrs. Clavering; \"and I will read to you\nmy letter.\"\n\n\"No, do not read it me. What is the use? He has made her quarrel with\nme. Julia cares nothing now for me, or for my angel. Why should she\ncare? When she came home we would not see her. Of course she will not\ncare. Who is there that will care for me?\"\n\n\"Do not I care for you, Hermione?\"\n\n\"Yes, because you are here; because of the nearness of the houses.\nIf you lived far away you would not care for me. It is just the\ncustom of the thing.\" There was something so true in this that Mrs.\nClavering could make no answer to it. Then they turned to go back\ninto the sitting-room, and as they did so Lady Clavering lingered\nbehind for a moment; but when she was again with Mrs. Clavering her\ncheek was still dry.\n\n\"He will be at the station at nine,\" said Lady Clavering. \"They must\nsend the brougham for him, or the dog-cart. He will be very angry if\nhe is made to come home in the fly from the public-house.\" Then the\nelder lady left the room and gave orders that Sir Hugh should be met\nby his carriage. What must the wife think of her husband, when she\nfeared that he would be angered by little matters at such a time as\nthis! \"Do you think it will make him very unhappy?\" Lady Clavering\nasked.\n\n\"Of course it will make him unhappy. How should it be otherwise?\"\n\n\"He had said so often that the child would die. He will have got used\nto the fear.\"\n\n\"His grief will be as fresh now as though he had never thought so,\nand never said so.\"\n\n\"He is so hard; and then he has such will, such power. He will thrust\nit off from him and determine that it shall not oppress him. I know\nhim so well.\"\n\n\"We should all make some exertion like that in our sorrow, trusting\nto God's kindness to relieve us. You too, Hermione, should determine\nalso; but not yet, my dear. At first it is better to let sorrow have\nits way.\"\n\n\"But he will determine at once. You remember when Meeny went.\" Meeny\nhad been a little girl who had been born before the boy, and who had\ndied when little more than twelve months old. \"He did not expect\nthat; but then he only shook his head, and went out of the room. He\nhas never spoken to me one word of her since that. I think he has\nforgotten Meeny altogether,--even that she was ever here.\"\n\n\"He cannot forget the boy who was his heir.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is where it is. He will say words to me which would make\nyou weep if you could hear them. Yes, my darling was his heir. Archie\nwill marry now, and will have children, and his boy will be the heir.\nThere will be more division and more quarrels, for Hugh will hate his\nbrother now.\"\n\n\"I do not understand why.\"\n\n\"Because he is so hard. It is a pity he should ever have married, for\nhe wants nothing that a wife can do for him. He wanted a boy to come\nafter him in the estate, and now that glory has been taken from him.\nMrs. Clavering, I often wish that I could die.\"\n\nIt would be bootless here to repeat the words of wise and loving\ncounsel with which the elder of the two ladies endeavoured to comfort\nthe younger, and to make her understand what were the duties which\nstill remained to her, and which, if they were rightly performed,\nwould, in their performance, soften the misery of her lot. Lady\nClavering listened with that dull, useless attention which on such\noccasions sorrow always gives to the prudent counsels of friendship;\nbut she was thinking ever and always of her husband, and watching the\nmoment of his expected return. In her heart she wished that he might\nnot come on that evening. At last, at half-past nine, she exerted\nherself to send away her visitor.\n\n\"He will be here soon, if he comes to-night,\" Lady Clavering said,\n\"and it will be better that he should find me alone.\"\n\n\"Will it be better?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Cannot you see how he would frown and shake his head if\nyou were here? I would sooner be alone when he comes. Good-night. You\nhave been very kind to me; but you are always kind. Things are done\nkindly always at your house, because there is so much love there. You\nwill write to Julia for me. Good-night.\" Then Mrs. Clavering kissed\nher and went, thinking as she walked home in the dark to the rectory,\nhow much she had to be thankful in that these words had been true\nwhich her poor neighbour had spoken. Her house was full of love.\n\nFor the next half hour Lady Clavering sat alone listening with eager\near for the sound of her husband's wheels, and at last she had almost\ntold herself that the hour for his coming had gone by, when she heard\nthe rapid grating on the gravel as the dog-cart was driven up to\nthe door. She ran out on to the corridor, but her heart sank within\nher as she did so, and she took tightly hold of the balustrade to\nsupport herself. For a moment she had thought of running down to meet\nhim;--of trusting to the sadness of the moment to produce in him, if\nit were but for a minute, something of tender solicitude; but she\nremembered that the servants would be there, and knew that he would\nnot be soft before them. She remembered also that the housekeeper had\nreceived her instructions, and she feared to disarrange the settled\nprogramme. So she went back to the open door of the room, that her\nretreating step might not be heard by him as he should come up to\nher, and standing there she still listened. The house was silent\nand her ears were acute with sorrow. She could hear the movement of\nthe old woman as she gently, tremblingly, as Lady Clavering knew,\nmade her way down the hall to meet her master. Sir Hugh of course\nhad learned his child's fate already from the servant who had met\nhim; but it was well that the ceremony of such telling should be\nperformed. She felt the cold air come in from the opened front door,\nand she heard her husband's heavy quick step as he entered. Then she\nheard the murmur of Hannah's voice; but the first word she heard was\nin her husband's tones, \"Where is Lady Clavering?\" Then the answer\nwas given, and the wife, knowing that he was coming, retreated back\nto her chair.\n\nBut still he did not come quite at once. He was pulling off his coat\nand laying aside his hat and gloves. Then came upon her a feeling\nthat at such a time any other husband and wife would have been at\nonce in each other's arms. And at the moment she thought of all that\nthey had lost. To her her child had been all and everything. To him\nhe had been his heir and the prop of his house. The boy had been the\nonly link that had still bound them together. Now he was gone, and\nthere was no longer any link between them. He was gone and she had\nnothing left to her. He was gone, and the father was also alone\nin the world, without any heir and with no prop to his house. She\nthought of all this as she heard his step coming slowly up the\nstairs. Slowly he came along the passage, and though she dreaded his\ncoming it almost seemed as though he would never be there.\n\nWhen he had entered the room she was the first to speak. \"Oh, Hugh!\"\nshe exclaimed, \"oh, Hugh!\" He had closed the door before he uttered a\nword, and then he threw himself into a chair. There were candles near\nto him and she could see that his countenance also was altered. He\nhad indeed been stricken hard, and his half-stunned face showed the\nviolence of the blow. The harsh, cruel, selfish man had at last been\nmade to suffer. Although he had spoken of it and had expected it, the\ndeath of his heir hit him hard, as the rector had said.\n\n\"When did he die?\" asked the father.\n\n\"It was past four I think.\" Then there was again silence, and Lady\nClavering went up to her husband and stood close by his shoulder. At\nlast she ventured to put her hand upon him. With all her own misery\nheavy upon her, she was chiefly thinking at this moment how she might\nsoothe him. She laid her hand upon his shoulder, and by degrees she\nmoved it softly to his breast. Then he raised his own hand and with\nit moved hers from his person. He did it gently;--but what was the\nuse of such nonsense as that?\n\n\"The Lord giveth,\" said the wife, \"and the Lord taketh away.\" Hearing\nthis Sir Hugh made with his head a gesture of impatience. \"Blessed be\nthe name of the Lord,\" continued Lady Clavering. Her voice was low\nand almost trembling, and she repeated the words as though they were\na task which she had set herself.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.\"]\n\n\n\"That's all very well in its way,\" said he, \"but what's the special\nuse of it now? I hate twaddle. One must bear one's misfortune as one\nbest can. I don't believe that kind of thing ever makes it lighter.\"\n\n\"They say it does, Hugh.\"\n\n\"Ah! they say! Have they ever tried? If you have been living up to\nthat kind of thing all your life, it may be very well;--that is as\nwell at one time as another. But it won't give me back my boy.\"\n\n\"No, Hugh; he will never come back again; but we may think that he's\nin Heaven.\"\n\n\"If that is enough for you, let it be so. But don't talk to me of it.\nI don't like it. It doesn't suit me. I had only one, and he has gone.\nIt is always the way.\" He spoke of the child as having been his--not\nhis and hers. She felt this, and understood the want of affection\nwhich it conveyed; but she said nothing of it.\n\n\"Oh, Hugh; what could we do? It was not our fault.\"\n\n\"Who is talking of any fault? I have said nothing as to fault. He\nwas always poor and sickly. The Claverings, generally, have been so\nstrong. Look at myself, and Archie, and my sisters. Well, it cannot\nbe helped. Thinking of it will not bring him back again. You had\nbetter tell some one to get me something to eat. I came away, of\ncourse, without any dinner.\"\n\nShe herself had eaten nothing since the morning, but she neither\nspoke nor thought of that. She rang the bell, and going out into the\npassage gave the servant the order on the stairs.\n\n\"It is no good my staying here,\" he said. \"I will go and dress. It\nis the best not to think of such things,--much the best. People call\nthat heartless, of course, but then people are fools. If I were to\nsit still, and think of it for a week together, what good could I\ndo?\"\n\n\"But how not to think of it? that is the thing.\"\n\n\"Women are different, I suppose. I will dress and then go down to the\nbreakfast-room. Tell Saunders to get me a bottle of champagne. You\nwill be better also if you will take a glass of wine.\"\n\nIt was the first word he had spoken which showed any care for her,\nand she was grateful for it. As he arose to go, she came close to\nhim again, and put her hand very gently on his arm. \"Hugh,\" she said,\n\"will you not see him?\"\n\n\"What good will that do?\"\n\n\"I think you would regret it if you were to let them take him away\nwithout looking at him. He is so pretty as he lays in his little bed.\nI thought you would come with me to see him.\" He was more gentle with\nher than she had expected, and she led him away to the room which had\nbeen their own, and in which the child had died.\n\n\"Why here?\" he said, almost angrily, as he entered.\n\n\"I have had him here with me since you went.\"\n\n\"He should not be here now,\" he said, shuddering. \"I wish he had been\nmoved before I came. I will not have this room any more; remember\nthat.\" She led him up to the foot of the little cot, which stood\nclose by the head of her own bed, and then she removed a handkerchief\nwhich lay upon the child's face.\n\n\"Oh, Hugh! oh, Hugh!\" she said, and, throwing her arms round his\nneck, she wept violently upon his breast. For a few moments he did\nnot disturb her, but stood looking at his boy's face. \"Hugh, Hugh,\"\nshe repeated, \"will you not be kind to me? Do be kind to me. It is\nnot my fault that we are childless.\"\n\nStill he endured her for a few moments longer. He spoke no word to\nher, but he let her remain there, with her head upon his breast.\n\n\"Dear Hugh, I love you so truly!\"\n\n\"This is nonsense,\" said he, \"sheer nonsense.\" His voice was low and\nvery hoarse. \"Why do you talk of kindness now?\"\n\n\"Because I am so wretched.\"\n\n\"What have I done to make you wretched?\"\n\n\"I do not mean that; but if you will be gentle with me, it will\ncomfort me. Do not leave me here all alone, now my darling has been\ntaken from me.\"\n\nThen he shook her from him, not violently, but with a persistent\naction.\n\n\"Do you mean that you want to go up to town?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, no; not that.\"\n\n\"Then what is it you want? Where would you live, if not here?\"\n\n\"Anywhere you please, only that you should stay with me.\"\n\n\"All that is nonsense. I wonder that you should talk of such things\nnow. Come away from this, and let me go to my room. All this is trash\nand nonsense, and I hate it.\" She put back with careful hands the\npiece of cambric which she had moved, and then, seating herself on\na chair, wept violently, with her hands closed upon her face. \"That\ncomes of bringing me here,\" he said. \"Get up, Hermione. I will not\nhave you so foolish. Get up, I say. I will have the room closed till\nthe men come.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Get up, I say, and come away.\" Then she rose, and followed him out\nof the chamber, and when he went to change his clothes she returned\nto the room in which he had found her. There she sat and wept, while\nhe went down and dined and drank alone. But the old housekeeper\nbrought her up a morsel of food and a glass of wine, saying that her\nmaster desired that she would take it.\n\n\"I will not leave you, my lady, till you have done so,\" said Hannah.\n\"To fast so long must be bad always.\"\n\nThen she eat the food, and drank a drop of wine, and allowed the old\nwoman to take her away to the bed that had been prepared for her. Of\nher husband she saw no more for four days. On the next morning a note\nwas brought to her, in which Sir Hugh told her that he had returned\nto London. It was necessary, he said, that he should see his lawyer\nand his brother. He and Archie would return for the funeral. With\nreference to that he had already given orders.\n\nDuring the next three days, and till her husband's return, Lady\nClavering remained at the rectory, and in the comfort of Mrs.\nClavering's presence she almost felt that it would be well for her\nif those days could be prolonged. But she knew the hour at which\nher husband would return, and she took care to be at home when he\narrived. \"You will come and see him?\" she said to the rector, as she\nleft the parsonage. \"You will come at once;--in an hour or two?\"\nMr. Clavering remembered the circumstances of his last visit to the\nhouse, and the declaration he had then made that he would not return\nthere. But all that could not now be considered.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I will come across this evening. But you had better\ntell him, so that he need not be troubled to see me if he would\nrather be alone.\"\n\n\"Oh, he will see you. Of course he will see you. And you will not\nremember that he ever offended you?\"\n\nMrs. Clavering had written both to Julia and to Harry, and the day\nof the funeral had been settled. Harry had already communicated\nhis intention of coming down; and Lady Ongar had replied to Mrs.\nClavering's letter, saying that she could not now offer to go to\nClavering Park, but that if her sister would go elsewhere with\nher,--to some place, perhaps, on the sea-side,--she would be glad to\naccompany her; and she used many arguments in her letter to show that\nsuch an arrangement as this had better be made.\n\n\"You will be with my sister,\" she had said; \"and she will understand\nwhy I do not write to her myself, and will not think that it comes\nfrom coldness.\" This had been written before Lady Ongar saw Harry\nClavering.\n\nMr. Clavering, when he got to the great house, was immediately shown\ninto the room in which the baronet and his younger brother were\nsitting. They had, some time since, finished dinner, but the\ndecanters were still on the table before them. \"Hugh,\" said the\nrector, walking up to his elder nephew, briskly, \"I grieve for you.\nI grieve for you from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hugh, \"it has been a heavy blow. Sit down, uncle. There\nis a clean glass there; or Archie will fetch you one.\" Then Archie\nlooked out a clean glass and passed the decanter; but of this the\nrector took no direct notice.\n\n\"It has been a blow, my poor boy,--a heavy blow,\" said the rector.\n\"None heavier could have fallen. But our sorrows come from Heaven, as\ndo our blessings, and must be accepted.\"\n\n\"We are all like grass,\" said Archie, \"and must be cut down in\nour turns.\" Archie, in saying this, intended to put on his best\nbehaviour. He was as sincere as he knew how to be.\n\n\"Come, Archie, none of that,\" said his brother. \"It is my uncle's\ntrade.\"\n\n\"Hugh,\" said the rector, \"unless you can think of it so, you will\nfind no comfort.\"\n\n\"And I expect none, so there is an end of that. Different people\nthink of these things differently, you know, and it is of no more\nuse for me to bother you than it is for you to bother me. My boy has\ngone, and I know that he will not come back to me. I shall never have\nanother, and it is hard to bear. But, meaning no offence to you, I\nwould sooner be left to bear it in my own way. If I were to talk\nabout the grass as Archie did just now, it would be humbug, and I\nhate humbug. No offence to you. Take some wine, uncle.\"\n\nBut the rector could not drink wine in that presence, and therefore\nhe escaped as soon as he could. He spoke one word of intended comfort\nto Lady Clavering, and then returned to the rectory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nYES; WRONG;--CERTAINLY WRONG.\n\n\nHarry Clavering had heard the news of his little cousin's death\nbefore he went to Bolton Street to report the result of his\nnegotiation with the count. His mother's letter with the news had\ncome to him in the morning, and on the same evening he called on Lady\nOngar. She also had then received Mrs. Clavering's letter, and knew\nwhat had occurred at the park. Harry found her alone, having asked\nthe servant whether Madame Gordeloup was with his mistress. Had such\nbeen the case he would have gone away, and left his message untold.\n\nAs he entered the room his mind was naturally full of the tidings\nfrom Clavering. Count Pateroff and his message had lost some of\ntheir importance through this other event, and the emptiness of the\nchildless house was the first subject of conversation between him\nand Lady Ongar. \"I pity my sister greatly,\" said she. \"I feel for\nher as deeply as I should have done had nothing occurred to separate\nus;--but I cannot feel for him.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Harry.\n\n\"He is your cousin, and perhaps has been your friend?\"\n\n\"No, not especially. He and I have never pulled well together; but\nstill I pity him deeply.\"\n\n\"He is not my cousin, but I know him better than you do, Harry. He\nwill not feel much himself, and his sorrow will be for his heir, not\nfor his son. He is a man whose happiness does not depend on the life\nor death of any one. He likes some people, as he once liked me; but I\ndo not think that he ever loved any human being. He will get over it,\nand he will simply wish that Hermy may die, that he may marry another\nwife. Harry, I know him so well!\"\n\n\"Archie will marry now,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Yes; if he can get any one to have him. There are very few men who\ncan't get wives, but I can fancy Archie Clavering to be one of them.\nHe has not humility enough to ask the sort of girl who would be glad\nto take him. Now, with his improved prospects, he will want a royal\nprincess or something not much short of it. Money, rank, and blood\nmight have done before, but he'll expect youth, beauty, and wit now,\nas well as the other things. He may marry after all, for he is just\nthe man to walk out of a church some day with the cookmaid under his\narm as his wife.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he may find something between a princess and a cookmaid.\"\n\n\"I hope, for your sake, he may not;--neither a princess nor a\ncookmaid, nor anything between.\"\n\n\"He has my leave to marry to-morrow, Lady Ongar. If I had my wish,\nHugh should have his house full of children.\"\n\n\"Of course that is the proper thing to say, Harry.\"\n\n\"I won't stand that from you, Lady Ongar. What I say, I mean; and no\none knows that better than you.\"\n\n\"Won't you, Harry? From whom, then, if not from me? But come, I will\ndo you justice, and believe you to be simple enough to wish anything\nof the kind. The sort of castle in the air which you build, is not\none to be had by inheritance, but to be taken by storm. You must\nfight for it.\"\n\n\"Or work for it.\"\n\n\"Or win it in some way off your own bat; and no lord ever sat prouder\nin his castle than you sit in those that you build from day to\nday in your imagination. And you sally forth and do all manner\nof magnificent deeds. You help distressed damsels,--poor me, for\ninstance; and you attack enormous dragons;--shall I say that Sophie\nGordeloup is the latest dragon?--and you wish well to your enemies,\nsuch as Hugh and Archie; and you cut down enormous forests, which\nmeans your coming miracles as an engineer;--and then you fall\ngloriously in love. When is that last to be, Harry?\"\n\n\"I suppose, according to all precedent, that must be done with the\ndistressed damsel,\" he said,--fool that he was.\n\n\"No, Harry, no; you shall take your young fresh generous heart to a\nbetter market than that; not but that the distressed damsel will ever\nremember what might once have been.\"\n\nHe knew that he was playing on the edge of a precipice,--that he was\nfluttering as a moth round a candle. He knew that it behoved him\nnow at once to tell her all his tale as to Stratton and Florence\nBurton;--that if he could tell it now, the pang would be over and the\ndanger gone. But he did not tell it. Instead of telling it he thought\nof Lady Ongar's beauty, of his own early love, of what might have\nbeen his had he not gone to Stratton. I think he thought, if not of\nher wealth, yet of the power and place which would have been his were\nit now open to him to ask her for her hand. When he had declared that\nhe did not want his cousin's inheritance, he had spoken the simple\ntruth. He was not covetous of another's money. Were Archie to marry\nas many wives as Henry, and have as many children as Priam, it would\nbe no offence to him. His desires did not lie in that line. But in\nthis other case, the woman before him who would so willingly have\nendowed him with all that she possessed, had been loved by him before\nhe had ever seen Florence Burton. In all his love for Florence,--so\nhe now told himself, but so told himself falsely,--he had ever\nremembered that Julia Brabazon had been his first love, the love whom\nhe had loved with all his heart. But things had gone with him most\nunfortunately,--with a misfortune that had never been paralleled. It\nwas thus he was thinking instead of remembering that now was the time\nin which his tale should be told.\n\nLady Ongar, however, soon carried him away from the actual brink of\nthe precipice. \"But how about the dragon,\" said she, \"or rather about\nthe dragon's brother, at whom you were bound to go and tilt on my\nbehalf? Have you tilted, or are you a recreant knight?\"\n\n\"I have tilted,\" said he, \"but the he-dragon professes that he will\nnot regard himself as killed. In other words he declares that he will\nsee you.\"\n\n\"That he will see me?\" said Lady Ongar, and as she spoke there came\nan angry spot on each cheek. \"Does he send me that message as a\nthreat?\"\n\n\"He does not send it as a threat, but I think he partly means it so.\"\n\n\"He will find, Harry, that I will not see him; and that should he\nforce himself into my presence, I shall know how to punish such an\noutrage. If he sent me any message, let me know it.\"\n\n\"To tell the truth he was most unwilling to speak to me at all,\nthough he was anxious to be civil to me. When I had inquired for him\nsome time in vain, he came to me with another man, and asked me to\ndinner. So I went, and as there were four of us, of course I could\nnot speak to him then. He still had the other man, a foreigner--\"\n\n\"Colonel Schmoff, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes; Colonel Schmoff. He kept Colonel Schmoff by him, so as to guard\nhim from being questioned.\"\n\n\"That is so like him. Everything he does he does with some\ndesign,--with some little plan. Well, Harry, you might have ignored\nColonel Schmoff for what I should have cared.\"\n\n\"I got the count to come out into another room at last, and then he\nwas very angry,--with me, you know,--and talked of what he would do\nto men who interfered with him.\"\n\n\"You will not quarrel with him, Harry? Promise me that there shall be\nno nonsense of that sort,--no fighting.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; we were friends again very soon. But he bade me tell you\nthat there was something important for him to say and for you to\nhear, which was no concern of mine, and which required an interview.\"\n\n\"I do not believe him, Harry.\"\n\n\"And he said that he had once been very courteous to you--\"\n\n\"Yes; once insolent,--and once courteous. I have forgiven the one for\nthe other.\"\n\n\"He then went on to say that you made him a poor return for his\ncivility by shutting your door in his face, but that he did not\ndoubt you would think better of it when you had heard his message.\nTherefore, he said, he should call again. That, Lady Ongar, was the\nwhole of it.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you what his intention was, Harry?\" Again her face\nbecame red as she asked this question; but the colour which now came\nto her cheeks was rather that of shame than of anger.\n\n\"What was his intention?\"\n\n\"To make you believe that I am in his power; to make you think that\nhe has been my lover; to lower me in your eyes, so that you might\nbelieve all that others have believed,--all that Hugh Clavering has\npretended to believe. That has been his object, Harry, and perhaps\nyou will tell me what success he has had.\"\n\n\"Lady Ongar!\"\n\n\"You know the old story, that the drop which is ever dropping will\nwear the stone. And after all why should your faith in me be as hard\neven as a stone?\"\n\n\"Do you believe that what he said had any such effect?\"\n\n\"It is very hard to look into another person's heart; and the dearer\nand nearer that heart is to your own, the greater, I think, is the\ndifficulty. I know that man's heart,--what he calls his heart; but I\ndon't know yours.\"\n\nFor a moment or two Clavering made no answer, and then, when he did\nspeak, he went back from himself to the count.\n\n\"If what you surmise of him be true, he must be a very devil. He\ncannot be a man--\"\n\n\"Man or devil, what matters which he be? Which is the worst,\nHarry, and what is the difference? The Fausts of this day want no\nMephistopheles to teach them guile or to harden their hearts.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that there are such men. There may be one.\"\n\n\"One, Harry! What was Lord Ongar? What is your cousin Hugh? What is\nthis Count Pateroff? Are they not all of the same nature; hard as\nstone, desirous simply of indulging their own appetites, utterly\nwithout one generous feeling, incapable even of the idea of caring\nfor any one? Is it not so? In truth this count is the best of the\nthree I have named. With him a woman would stand a better chance than\nwith either of the others.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, if that was his motive, he is a devil.\"\n\n\"He shall be a devil if you say so. He shall be anything you please,\nso long as he has not made you think evil of me.\"\n\n\"No; he has not done that.\"\n\n\"Then I don't care what he has done, or what he may do. You would\nnot have me see him, would you?\" This she asked with a sudden energy,\nthrowing herself forward from her seat with her elbows on the table,\nand resting her face on her hands, as she had already done more than\nonce when he had been there; so that the attitude, which became her\nwell, was now customary in his eyes.\n\n\"You will hardly be guided by my opinion in such a matter.\"\n\n\"By whose, then, will I be guided? Nay, Harry, since you put me to a\npromise, I will make the promise. I will be guided by your opinion.\nIf you bid me see him, I will do it,--though, I own, it would be\ndistressing to me.\"\n\n\"Why should you see him, if you do not wish it?\"\n\n\"I know no reason. In truth there is no reason. What he says about\nLord Ongar is simply some part of his scheme. You see what his scheme\nis, Harry?\"\n\n\"What is his scheme?\"\n\n\"Simply this--that I should be frightened into becoming his wife. My\ndarling bosom friend Sophie, who, as I take it, has not quite managed\nto come to satisfactory terms with her brother,--and I have no doubt\nher price for assistance has been high,--has informed me more than\nonce that her brother desires to do me so much honour. The count,\nperhaps, thinks that he can manage such a bagatelle without any aid\nfrom his sister; and my dearest Sophie seems to feel that she can do\nbetter with me herself in my widowed state, than if I were to take\nanother husband. They are so kind and so affectionate; are they not?\"\n\nAt this moment tea was brought in, and Clavering sat for a time\nsilent with his cup in his hand. She, the meanwhile, had resumed the\nold position with her face upon her hands, which she had abandoned\nwhen the servant entered the room, and was now sitting looking at\nhim as he sipped his tea with his eyes averted from her. \"I cannot\nunderstand,\" at last he said, \"why you should persist in your\nintimacy with such a woman.\"\n\n\"You have not thought about it, Harry, or you would understand it. It\nis, I think, very easily understood.\"\n\n\"You know her to be treacherous, false, vulgar, covetous,\nunprincipled. You cannot like her. You say she is a dragon.\"\n\n\"A dragon to you, I said.\"\n\n\"You cannot pretend that she is a lady, and yet you put up with her\nsociety.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And now tell me what you would have me do.\"\n\n\"I would have you part from her.\"\n\n\"But how? It is so easy to say, part. Am I to bar my door against\nher when she has given me no offence? Am I to forget that she did me\ngreat service, when I sorely needed such services? Can I tell her to\nher face that she is all these things that you say of her, and that\ntherefore I will for the future dispense with her company? Or do you\nbelieve that people in this world associate only with those they love\nand esteem?\"\n\n\"I would not have one for my intimate friend whom I did not love and\nesteem.\"\n\n\"But, Harry, suppose that no one loved and esteemed you; that you had\nno home down at Clavering with a father that admires you and a mother\nthat worships you; no sisters that think you to be almost perfect,\nno comrades with whom you can work with mutual regard and emulation,\nno self-confidence, no high hopes of your own, no power of choosing\ncompanions whom you can esteem and love;--suppose with you it was\nSophie Gordeloup or none,--how would it be with you then?\"\n\nHis heart must have been made of stone if this had not melted it. He\ngot up and coming round to her stood over her. \"Julia,\" he said, \"it\nis not so with you.\"\n\n\"But it is so with Julia,\" she said. \"That is the truth. How am I\nbetter than her, and why should I not associate with her?\"\n\n\"Better than her! As women you are poles asunder.\"\n\n\"But as dragons,\" she said, smiling, \"we come together.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you have no one to love you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry; that is just what I do mean. I have none to love me. In\nplaying my cards I have won my stakes in money and rank, but have\nlost the amount ten times told in affection, friendship, and that\ngeneral unpronounced esteem which creates the fellowship of men and\nwomen in the world. I have a carriage and horses, and am driven about\nwith grand servants; and people, as they see me, whisper and say that\nis Lady Ongar, whom nobody knows. I can see it in their eyes till I\nfancy that I can hear their words.\"\n\n\"But it is all false.\"\n\n\"What is false? It is not false that I have deserved this. I have\ndone that which has made me a fitting companion for such a one as\nSophie Gordeloup, though I have not done that which perhaps these\npeople think.\"\n\nHe paused again before he spoke, still standing near her on the rug.\n\"Lady Ongar--\" he said.\n\n\"Nay, Harry; not Lady Ongar when we are together thus. Let me feel\nthat I have one friend who can dare to call me by my name,--from\nwhose mouth I shall be pleased to hear my name. You need not fear\nthat I shall think that it means too much. I will not take it as\nmeaning what it used to mean.\"\n\nHe did not know how to go on with his speech, or in truth what to\nsay to her. Florence Burton was still present to his mind, and from\nminute to minute he told himself that he would not become a villain.\nBut now it had come to that with him, that he would have given all\nthat he had in the world that he had never gone to Stratton. He\nsat down by her in silence, looking away from her at the fire,\nswearing to himself that he would not become a villain, and yet\nwishing, almost wishing, that he had the courage to throw his honour\noverboard. At last, half turning round towards her he took her hand,\nor rather took her first by the wrist till he could possess himself\nof her hand. As he did so he touched her hair and her cheek, and she\nlet her hand drop till it rested in his. \"Julia,\" he said, \"what can\nI do to comfort you?\" She did not answer him, but looked away from\nhim as she sat, across the table into vacancy. \"Julia,\" he said\nagain, \"is there anything that will comfort you?\" But still she did\nnot answer him.\n\nHe understood it all as well as the reader will understand it. He\nknew how it was with her, and was aware that he was at this instant\nfalse almost equally to her and to Florence. He knew that the\nquestion he had asked was one to which there could be made a true and\nsatisfactory answer, but that his safety lay in the fact that that\nanswer was all but impossible for her to give. Could she say, \"Yes,\nyou can comfort me. Tell me that you yet love me, and I will be\ncomforted?\" But he had not designed to bring her into such difficulty\nas this. He had not intended to be cruel. He had drifted into\ntreachery unawares, and was torturing her, not because he was wicked,\nbut because he was weak. He had held her hand now for some minute\nor two, but still she did not speak to him. Then he raised it and\npressed it warmly to his lips.\n\n\"No, Harry,\" she said, jumping from her seat and drawing her\nhand rapidly from him; \"no; it shall not be like that. Let it be\nLady Ongar again if the sound of the other name brings back too\nclosely the memory of other days. Let it be Lady Ongar again. I can\nunderstand that it will be better.\" As she spoke she walked away from\nhim across the room, and he followed her.\n\n\"Are you angry?\" he asked her.\n\n\"No, Harry; not angry. How should I be angry with you who alone are\nleft to me of my old friends? But, Harry, you must think for me, and\nspare me in my difficulty.\"\n\n\"Spare you, Julia?\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry, spare me; you must be good to me and considerate, and\nmake yourself like a brother to me. But people will know you are not\na brother, and you must remember all that, for my sake. But you must\nnot leave me or desert me. Anything that people might say would be\nbetter than that.\"\n\n\"Was I wrong to kiss your hand?\"\n\n\"Yes, wrong, certainly wrong;--that is, not wrong, but unmindful.\"\n\n\"I did it,\" he said, \"because I love you.\" And as he spoke the tears\nstood in both his eyes.\n\n\"Yes; you love me, and I you; but not with love that may show itself\nin that form. That was the old love, which I threw away, and which\nhas been lost. That was at an end when I--jilted you. I am not angry;\nbut you will remember that that love exists no longer? You will\nremember that, Harry?\"\n\nHe sat himself down in a chair in a far part of the room, and two\ntears coursed their way down his cheeks. She stood over him and\nwatched him as he wept. \"I did not mean to make you sad,\" she said.\n\"Come, we will be sad no longer. I understand it all. I know how\nit is with you. The old love is lost, but we will not the less be\nfriends.\" Then he rose suddenly from his chair, and taking her in his\narms, and holding her closely to his bosom, pressed his lips to hers.\n\nHe was so quick in this that she had not the power, even if she had\nthe wish, to restrain him. But she struggled in his arms, and held\nher face aloof from him as she gently rebuked his passion. \"No,\nHarry, no; not so,\" she said, \"it must not be so.\"\n\n\"Yes, Julia, yes; it shall be so; ever so,--always so.\" And he\nwas still holding her in his arms, when the door opened, and with\nstealthy, cat-like steps Sophie Gordeloup entered the room. Harry\nimmediately retreated from his position, and Lady Ongar turned upon\nher friend, and glared upon her with angry eyes.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the little Franco-Pole, with an expression of infinite\ndelight on her detestable visage, \"ah, my dears, is it not well that\nI thus announce myself?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Ongar, \"it is not well. It is anything but well.\"\n\n\"And why not well, Julie? Come, do not be foolish. Mr. Clavering is\nonly a cousin, and a very handsome cousin, too. What does it signify\nbefore me?\"\n\n\"It signifies nothing before you,\" said Lady Ongar.\n\n\"But before the servant, Julie--?\"\n\n\"It would signify nothing before anybody.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Julie, dear; that is nonsense.\"\n\n\"Nonsense or no nonsense, I would wish to be private when I please.\nWill you tell me, Madame Gordeloup, what is your pleasure at the\npresent moment?\"\n\n\"My pleasure is to beg your pardon and to say you must forgive your\npoor friend. Your fine man-servant is out, and Bessy let me in. I\ntold Bessy I would go up by myself, and that is all. If I have come\ntoo late I beg pardon.\"\n\n\"Not too late, certainly,--as I am still up.\"\n\n\"And I wanted to ask you about the pictures to-morrow? You said,\nperhaps you would go to-morrow,--perhaps not.\"\n\nClavering had found himself to be somewhat awkwardly situated\nwhile Madame Gordeloup was thus explaining the causes of her having\ncome unannounced into the room; as soon, therefore, as he found\nit practicable, he took his leave. \"Julia,\" he said, \"as Madame\nGordeloup is with you, I will now go.\"\n\n\"But you will let me see you soon?\"\n\n\"Yes, very soon; that is, as soon as I return from Clavering. I leave\ntown early to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Good-by, then,\" and she put out her hand to him frankly, smiling\nsweetly on him. As he felt the warm pressure of her hand he hardly\nknew whether to return it or to reject it. But he had gone too far\nnow for retreat, and he held it firmly for a moment in his own. She\nsmiled again upon him, oh! so passionately, and nodded her head at\nhim. He had never, he thought, seen a woman look so lovely, or more\nlight of heart. How different was her countenance now from that she\nhad worn when she told him, earlier on that fatal evening, of all the\nsorrows that made her wretched! That nod of hers said so much. \"We\nunderstand each other now,--do we not? Yes; although this spiteful\nwoman has for the moment come between us, we understand each other.\nAnd is it not sweet? Ah! the troubles of which I told you;--you,\nyou have cured them all.\" All that had been said plainly in her\nfarewell salutation, and Harry had not dared to contradict it by any\nexpression of his countenance.\n\n\"By, by, Mr. Clavering,\" said Sophie.\n\n\"Good evening, Madame Gordeloup,\" said Harry, turning upon her a look\nof bitter anger. Then he went, leaving the two women together, and\nwalked home to Bloomsbury Square,--not with the heart of a joyous\nthriving lover.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE DAY OF THE FUNERAL.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nHarry Clavering, when he walked away from Bolton Street after the\nscene in which he had been interrupted by Sophie Gordeloup, was\nnot in a happy frame of mind, nor did he make his journey down to\nClavering with much comfort to himself. Whether or no he was now to\nbe regarded as a villain, at any rate he was not a villain capable of\ndoing his villany without extreme remorse and agony of mind. It did\nnot seem to him to be even yet possible that he should be altogether\nuntrue to Florence. It hardly occurred to him to think that he could\nfree himself from the contract by which he was bound to her. No; it\nwas towards Lady Ongar that his treachery must be exhibited;--towards\nthe woman whom he had sworn to befriend, and whom he now, in his\ndistress, imagined to be the dearer to him of the two. He should,\naccording to his custom, have written to Florence a day or two before\nhe left London, and, as he went to Bolton Street, had determined to\ndo so that evening on his return home; but when he reached his rooms\nhe found it impossible to write such a letter. What could he say to\nher that would not be false? How could he tell her that he loved her,\nand speak as he was wont to do of his impatience, after that which\nhad just occurred in Bolton Street?\n\nBut what was he to do in regard to Julia? He was bound to let her\nknow at once what was his position, and to tell her that in treating\nher as he had treated her, he had simply insulted her. That look\nof gratified contentment with which she had greeted him as he\nwas leaving her, clung to his memory and tormented him. Of that\ncontentment he must now rob her, and he was bound to do so with as\nlittle delay as was possible. Early in the morning before he started\non his journey he did make an attempt, a vain attempt, to write, not\nto Florence but to Julia. The letter would not get itself written. He\nhad not the hardihood to inform her that he had amused himself with\nher sorrows, and that he had injured her by the exhibition of his\nlove. And then that horrid Franco-Pole, whose prying eyes Julia had\ndared to disregard, because she had been proud of his love! If she\nhad not been there, the case might have been easier. Harry, as he\nthought of this, forgot to remind himself that if Sophie had not\ninterrupted him he would have floundered on from one danger to\nanother till he would have committed himself more thoroughly even\nthan he had done, and have made promises which it would have been as\nshameful to break as it would be to keep them. But even as it was,\nhad he not made such promises? Was there not such a promise in that\nembrace, in the half-forgotten word or two which he had spoken while\nshe was in his arms, and in the parting grasp of his hand? He could\nnot write that letter then, on that morning, hurried as he was with\nthe necessity of his journey; and he started for Clavering resolving\nthat it should be written from his father's house.\n\nIt was a tedious, sad journey to him, and he was silent and out\nof spirits when he reached his home; but he had gone there for the\npurpose of his cousin's funeral, and his mood was not at first\nnoticed, as it might have been had the occasion been different. His\nfather's countenance wore that well-known look of customary solemnity\nwhich is found to be necessary on such occasions, and his mother was\nstill thinking of the sorrows of Lady Clavering, who had been at the\nrectory for the last day or two.\n\n\"Have you seen Lady Ongar since she heard of the poor child's death?\"\nhis mother asked.\n\n\"Yes, I was with her yesterday evening.\"\n\n\"Do you see her often?\" Fanny inquired.\n\n\"What do you call often? No; not often. I went to her last night\nbecause she had given me a commission. I have seen her three or four\ntimes altogether.\"\n\n\"Is she as handsome as she used to be?\" said Fanny.\n\n\"I cannot tell; I do not know.\"\n\n\"You used to think her very handsome, Harry.\"\n\n\"Of course she is handsome. There has never been a doubt about that;\nbut when a woman is in deep mourning one hardly thinks about her\nbeauty.\" Oh, Harry, Harry, how could you be so false?\n\n\"I thought young widows were always particularly charming,\" said\nFanny; \"and when one remembers about Lord Ongar one does not think of\nher being a widow so much as one would do if he had been different.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that,\" said he. He felt that he was\nstupid, and that he blundered in every word, but he could not help\nhimself. It was impossible that he should talk about Lady Ongar with\nproper composure. Fanny saw that the subject annoyed him and that\nit made him cross, and she therefore ceased. \"She wrote a very nice\nletter to your mother about the poor child, and about her sister,\"\nsaid the rector. \"I wish with all my heart that Hermione could go to\nher for a time.\"\n\n\"I fear that he will not let her,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"I do not\nunderstand it all, but Hermione says that the rancour between Hugh\nand her sister is stronger now than ever.\"\n\n\"And Hugh will not be the first to put rancour out of his heart,\"\nsaid the rector.\n\nOn the following day was the funeral and Harry went with his father\nand cousins to the child's grave. When he met Sir Hugh in the\ndining-room in the Great House the baronet hardly spoke to him. \"A\nsad occasion; is it not?\" said Archie; \"very sad; very sad.\" Then\nHarry could see that Hugh scowled at his brother angrily, hating his\nhumbug, and hating it the more because in Archie's case it was doubly\nhumbug. Archie was now heir to the property and to the title.\n\nAfter the funeral Harry went to see Lady Clavering, and again had to\nendure a conversation about Lady Ongar. Indeed, he had been specially\ncommissioned by Julia to press upon her sister the expediency of\nleaving Clavering for a while. This had been early on that last\nevening in Bolton Street, long before Madame Gordeloup had made her\nappearance. \"Tell her from me,\" Lady Ongar had said, \"that I will go\nanywhere that she may wish if she will go with me,--she and I alone;\nand, Harry, tell her this as though I meant it. I do mean it. She\nwill understand why I do not write myself. I know that he sees all\nher letters when he is with her.\" This task Harry was now to perform,\nand the result he was bound to communicate to Lady Ongar. The message\nhe might give; but delivering the answer to Lady Ongar would be\nanother thing.\n\nLady Clavering listened to what he said, but when he pressed her for\na reply she shook her head. \"And why not, Lady Clavering?\"\n\n\"People can't always leave their houses and go away, Harry.\"\n\n\"But I should have thought that you could have done so now;--that is,\nbefore long. Will Sir Hugh remain here at Clavering?\"\n\n\"He has not told me that he means to go.\"\n\n\"If he stays, I suppose you will stay; but if he goes up to London\nagain, I cannot see why you and your sister should not go away\ntogether. She mentioned Tenby as being very quiet, but she would be\nguided by you in that altogether.\"\n\n\"I do not think it will be possible, Harry. Tell her with my love,\nthat I am truly obliged to her, but that I do not think it will be\npossible. She is free, you know, to do what she pleases.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is free. But do you mean--?\"\n\n\"I mean, Harry, that I had better stay where I am. What is the use of\na scene, and of being refused at last? Do not say more about it, but\ntell her that it cannot be so.\" This Harry promised to do, and after\na while was rising to go, when she suddenly asked him a question. \"Do\nyou remember what I was saying about Julia and Archie when you were\nhere last?\"\n\n\"Yes; I remember.\"\n\n\"Well, would he have a chance? It seems that you see more of her now\nthan any one else.\"\n\n\"No chance at all, I should say.\" And Harry, as he answered, could\nnot repress a feeling of most unreasonable jealousy.\n\n\"Ah, you have always thought little of Archie. Archie's position is\nchanged now, Harry, since my darling was taken from me. Of course he\nwill marry, and Hugh, I think, would like him to marry Julia. It was\nhe proposed it. He never likes anything unless he has proposed it\nhimself.\"\n\n\"It was he proposed the marriage with Lord Ongar. Does he like that?\"\n\n\"Well; you know, Julia has got her money.\" Harry, as he heard this,\nturned away, sick at heart. The poor baby whose mother was now\nspeaking to him had only been buried that morning, and she was\nalready making fresh schemes for family wealth. Julia has got her\nmoney! That had seemed to her, even in her sorrow, to be sufficient\ncompensation for all that her sister had endured and was enduring.\nPoor soul! Harry did not reflect as he should have done, that in all\nher schemes she was only scheming for that peace which might perhaps\ncome to her if her husband were satisfied. \"And why should not Julia\ntake him?\" she asked.\n\n\"I cannot tell why, but she never will,\" said Harry, almost in anger.\nAt that moment the door was opened, and Sir Hugh came into the room.\n\"I did not know that you were here,\" Sir Hugh said, turning to the\nvisitor.\n\n\"I could not be down here without saying a few words to Lady\nClavering.\"\n\n\"The less said the better, I suppose, just at present,\" said Sir\nHugh. But there was no offence in the tone of his voice, or in his\ncountenance, and Harry took the words as meaning none.\n\n\"I was telling Lady Clavering that as soon as she can, she would be\nbetter if she left home for awhile.\"\n\n\"And why should you tell Lady Clavering that?\"\n\n\"I have told him that I would not go,\" said the poor woman.\n\n\"Why should she go, and where; and why have you proposed it? And how\ndoes it come to pass that her going or not going should be a matter\nof solicitude to you?\" Now, as Sir Hugh asked these questions of\nhis cousin, there was much of offence in his tone,--of intended\noffence,--and in his eye, and in all his bearing. He had turned his\nback upon his wife, and was looking full into Harry's face. \"Lady\nClavering, no doubt, is much obliged to you,\" he said, \"but why is it\nthat you specially have interfered to recommend her to leave her home\nat such a time as this?\"\n\nHarry had not spoken as he did to Sir Hugh without having made some\ncalculation in his own mind as to the result of what he was about\nto say. He did not, as regarded himself, care for his cousin or his\ncousin's anger. His object at present was simply that of carrying out\nLady Ongar's wish, and he had thought that perhaps Sir Hugh might not\nobject to the proposal which his wife was too timid to make to him.\n\n\"It was a message from her sister,\" said Harry, \"sent by me.\"\n\n\"Upon my word she is very kind. And what was the message,--unless it\nbe a secret between you three?\"\n\n\"I have had no secret, Hugh,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Let me hear what he has to say,\" said Sir Hugh.\n\n\"Lady Ongar thought that it might be well that her sister should\nleave Clavering for a short time, and has offered to go anywhere with\nher for a few weeks. That is all.\"\n\n\"And why the devil should Hermione leave her own house? And if\nshe were to leave it, why should she go with a woman that has\nmisconducted herself?\"\n\n\"Oh, Hugh!\" exclaimed Lady Clavering.\n\n\"Lady Ongar has never misconducted herself,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Are you her champion?\" asked Sir Hugh.\n\n\"As far as that, I am. She has never misconducted herself; and what\nis more, she has been cruelly used since she came home.\"\n\n\"By whom; by whom?\" said Sir Hugh, stepping close up to his cousin\nand looking with angry eyes into his face.\n\nBut Harry Clavering was not a man to be intimidated by the angry eyes\nof any man. \"By you,\" he said, \"her brother-in-law;--by you, who made\nup her wretched marriage, and who, of all others, were the most bound\nto protect her.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry, don't, don't!\" shrieked Lady Clavering.\n\n\"Hermione, hold your tongue,\" said the imperious husband; \"or,\nrather, go away and leave us. I have a word or two to say to Harry\nClavering, which had better be said in private.\"\n\n\"I will not go if you are going to quarrel.\"\n\n\"Harry,\" said Sir Hugh, \"I will trouble you to go downstairs before\nme. If you will step into the breakfast-room I will come to you.\"\n\nHarry Clavering did as he was bid, and in a few minutes was joined by\nhis cousin in the breakfast-room.\n\n\"No doubt you intended to insult me by what you said upstairs.\" The\nbaronet began in this way after he had carefully shut the door, and\nhad slowly walked up to the rug before the fire, and had there taken\nhis position.\n\n\"Not at all; I intended to take the part of an ill-used woman whom\nyou had calumniated.\"\n\n\"Now look here, Harry, I will have no interference on your part in\nmy affairs, either here or elsewhere. You are a very fine fellow, no\ndoubt, but it is not part of your business to set me or my house in\norder. After what you have just said before Lady Clavering you will\ndo well not to come here in my absence.\"\n\n\"Neither in your absence nor in your presence.\"\n\n\"As to the latter you may do as you please. And now touching my\nsister-in-law, I will simply recommend you to look after your own\naffairs.\"\n\n\"I shall look after what affairs I please.\"\n\n\"Of Lady Ongar and her life since her marriage I daresay you know as\nlittle as anybody in the world, and I do not suppose it likely that\nyou will learn much from her. She made a fool of you once, and it is\non the cards that she may do so again.\"\n\n\"You said just now that you would brook no interference in your\naffairs. Neither will I.\"\n\n\"I don't know that you have any affairs in which any one can\ninterfere. I have been given to understand that you are engaged\nto marry that young lady whom your mother brought here one day to\ndinner. If that be so, I do not see how you can reconcile it to\nyourself to become the champion, as you called it, of Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"I never said anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did.\"\n\n\"No; it was you who asked me whether I was her champion.\"\n\n\"And you said you were.\"\n\n\"So far as to defend her name when I heard it traduced by you.\"\n\n\"By heavens, your impudence is beautiful. Who knows her best, do you\nthink,--you or I? Whose sister-in-law is she? You have told me I was\ncruel to her. Now to that I will not submit, and I require you to\napologize to me.\"\n\n\"I have no apology to make, and nothing to retract.\"\n\n\"Then I shall tell your father of your gross misconduct, and shall\nwarn him that you have made it necessary for me to turn his son\nout of my house. You are an impertinent, overbearing puppy, and if\nyour name were not the same as my own, I would tell the grooms to\nhorsewhip you off the place.\"\n\n\"Which order, you know, the grooms would not obey. They would a deal\nsooner horsewhip you. Sometimes I think they will, when I hear you\nspeak to them.\"\n\n\"Now go!\"\n\n\"Of course I shall go. What would keep me here?\"\n\nSir Hugh then opened the door, and Harry passed through it, not\nwithout a cautious look over his shoulder, so that he might be on his\nguard if any violence were contemplated. But Hugh knew better than\nthat, and allowed his cousin to walk out of the room, and out of the\nhouse, unmolested.\n\nAnd this had happened on the day of the funeral! Harry Clavering had\nquarrelled thus with the father within a few hours of the moment in\nwhich they two had stood together over the grave of that father's\nonly child! As he thought of this while he walked across the park he\nbecame sick at heart. How vile, wretched and miserable was the world\naround him! How terribly vicious were the people with whom he was\ndealing! And what could he think of himself,--of himself, who was\nengaged to Florence Burton, and engaged also, as he certainly was,\nto Lady Ongar? Even his cousin had rebuked him for his treachery to\nFlorence; but what would his cousin have said had he known all? And\nthen what good had he done;--or rather what evil had he not done?\nIn his attempt on behalf of Lady Clavering had he not, in truth,\ninterfered without proper excuse, and fairly laid himself open to\nanger from his cousin? And he felt that he had been an ass, a fool,\na conceited ass, thinking that he could produce good, when his\ninterference could be efficacious only for evil. Why could he not\nhave held his tongue when Sir Hugh came in, instead of making that\nvain suggestion as to Lady Clavering? But even this trouble was but\nan addition to the great trouble that overwhelmed him. How was he to\nescape the position which he had made for himself in reference to\nLady Ongar? As he had left London he had promised to himself that\nhe would write to her that same night and tell her everything as to\nFlorence; but the night had passed, and the next day was nearly gone,\nand no such letter had been written.\n\nAs he sat with his father that evening, he told the story of his\nquarrel with his cousin. His father shrugged his shoulders and raised\nhis eyebrows. \"You are a bolder man than I am,\" he said. \"I certainly\nshould not have dared to advise Hugh as to what he should do with his\nwife.\"\n\n\"But I did not advise him. I only said that I had been talking to her\nabout it. If he were to say to you that he had been recommending my\nmother to do this or that, you would not take it amiss?\"\n\n\"But Hugh is a peculiar man.\"\n\n\"No man has a right to be peculiar. Every man is bound to accept such\nusage as is customary in the world.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose that it will signify much,\" said the rector. \"To\nhave your cousin's doors barred against you, either here or in\nLondon, will not injure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; it will not injure me; but I do not wish you to think that\nI have been unreasonable.\"\n\nThe night went by and so did the next day, and still the letter did\nnot get itself written. On the third morning after the funeral he\nheard that Sir Hugh had gone away; but he, of course, did not go up\nto the house, remembering well that he had been warned by the master\nnot to do so in the master's absence. His mother, however, went\nto Lady Clavering, and some intercourse between the families was\nrenewed. He had intended to stay but one day after the funeral, but\nat the end of a week he was still at the rectory. It was Whitsuntide\nhe said, and he might as well take his holiday as he was down there.\nOf course they were glad that he should remain with them, but they\ndid not fail to perceive that things with him were not altogether\nright; nor had Fanny failed to perceive that he had not once\nmentioned Florence's name since he had been at the rectory.\n\n\"Harry,\" she said, \"there is nothing wrong between you and Florence?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Harry,\" she said, \"there is nothing wrong between\nyou and Florence?\"]\n\n\n\"Wrong! what should there be wrong? What do you mean by wrong?\"\n\n\"I had a letter from her to-day and she asks where you are.\"\n\n\"Women expect such a lot of letter-writing! But I have been remiss I\nknow. I got out of my business way of doing things when I came down\nhere and have neglected it. Do you write to her to-morrow, and tell\nher that she shall hear from me directly I get back to town.\"\n\n\"But why should you not write to her from here?\"\n\n\"Because I can get you to do it for me.\"\n\nFanny felt that this was not at all like a lover, and not at all like\nsuch a lover as her brother had been. While Florence had been at\nClavering he had been most constant with his letters, and Fanny had\noften heard Florence boast of them as being perfect in their way. She\ndid not say anything further at the present moment, but she knew that\nthings were not altogether right. Things were by no means right. He\nhad written neither to Lady Ongar nor to Florence, and the longer\nhe put off the task the more burdensome did it become. He was now\ntelling himself that he would write to neither till he got back to\nLondon.\n\nOn the day before he went, there came to him a letter from Stratton.\nFanny was with him when he received it, and observed that he put\nit into his pocket without opening it. In his pocket he carried it\nunopened half the day, till he was ashamed of his own weakness. At\nlast, almost in despair with himself, he broke the seal and forced\nhimself to read it. There was nothing in it that need have alarmed\nhim. It contained hardly a word that was intended for a rebuke.\n\n\"I wonder why you should have been two whole weeks without writing,\"\nshe said. \"It seems so odd to me, because you have spoiled me by your\ncustomary goodness. I know that other men when they are engaged do\nnot trouble themselves with constant letter-writing. Even Theodore,\nwho according to Cecilia is perfect, would not write to her then very\noften; and now, when he is away, his letters are only three lines.\nI suppose you are teaching me not to be exacting. If so, I will kiss\nthe rod like a good child; but I feel it the more because the lesson\nhas not come soon enough.\"\n\nThen she went on in her usual strain, telling him of what she had\ndone, what she had read, and what she had thought. There was no\nsuspicion in her letter, no fear, no hint at jealousy. And she\nshould have no further cause for jealousy! One of the two must\nbe sacrificed, and it was most fitting that Julia should be the\nsacrifice. Julia should be sacrificed,--Julia and himself! But still\nhe could not write to Florence till he had written to Julia. He could\nnot bring himself to send soft, pretty, loving words to one woman\nwhile the other was still regarding him as her affianced lover.\n\n\"Was your letter from Florence this morning?\" Fanny asked him.\n\n\"Yes; it was.\"\n\n\"Had she received mine?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Of course she had. If you sent it by post of course\nshe got it.\"\n\n\"She might have mentioned it, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I daresay she did. I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry; you need not be cross with me because I love the girl\nwho is going to be your wife. You would not like it if I did not care\nabout her.\"\n\n\"I hate being called cross.\"\n\n\"Suppose I were to say that I hated your being cross. I'm sure I\ndo;--and you are going away to-morrow, too. You have hardly said a\nnice word to me since you have been home.\"\n\nHarry threw himself back into a chair almost in despair. He was not\nenough a hypocrite to say nice words when his heart within him was\nnot at ease. He could not bring himself to pretend that things were\npleasant.\n\n\"If you are in trouble, Harry, I will not go on teasing you.\"\n\n\"I am in trouble,\" he said.\n\n\"And cannot I help you?\"\n\n\"No; you cannot help me. No one can help me. But do not ask any\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry! is it about money?\"\n\n\"No, no; it has nothing to do with money.\"\n\n\"You have not really quarrelled with Florence?\"\n\n\"No; I have not quarrelled with her at all. But I will not answer\nmore questions. And, Fanny, do not speak of this to my father or\nmother. It will be over before long, and then, if possible, I will\ntell you.\"\n\n\"Harry, you are not going to fight with Hugh?\"\n\n\"Fight with Hugh! no. Not that I should mind it; but he is not fool\nenough for that. If he wanted fighting done, he would do it by\ndeputy. But there is nothing of that kind.\"\n\nShe asked him no more questions, and on the next morning he returned\nto London. On his table he found a note which he at once knew to be\nfrom Lady Ongar, and which had come only that afternoon.\n\n\"Come to me at once;--at once.\" That was all that the note contained.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nCUMBERLY LANE WITHOUT THE MUD.\n\n\nFanny Clavering, while she was inquiring of her brother about his\ntroubles, had not been without troubles of her own. For some days\npast she had been aware,--almost aware,--that Mr. Saul's love was not\namong the things that were past. I am not prepared to say that this\nconviction on her part was altogether an unalloyed trouble, or that\nthere might have been no faint touch of sadness, of silent melancholy\nabout her, had it been otherwise. But Mr. Saul was undoubtedly a\ntrouble to her; and Mr. Saul with his love in activity would be more\ntroublesome than Mr. Saul with his love in abeyance. \"It would be\nmadness either in him or in me,\" Fanny had said to herself very\noften; \"he has not a shilling in the world.\" But she thought no\nmore in these days of the awkwardness of his gait, or of his rusty\nclothes, or his abstracted manner; and for his doings as a clergyman\nher admiration had become very great. Her mother saw something of\nall this, and cautioned her; but Fanny's demure manner deceived Mrs.\nClavering. \"Oh, mamma, of course I know that anything of the kind\nmust be impossible; and I am sure he does not think of it himself any\nlonger.\" When she had said this, Mrs. Clavering had believed that\nit was all right. The reader must not suppose that Fanny had been a\nhypocrite. There had been no hypocrisy in her words to her mother. At\nthat moment the conviction that Mr. Saul's love was not among past\nevents had not reached her; and as regarded herself, she was quite\nsincere when she said that anything of the kind must be impossible.\n\nIt will be remembered that Florence Burton had advised Mr. Saul\nto try again, and that Mr. Saul had resolved that he would do\nso,--resolving, also, that should he try in vain he must leave\nClavering, and seek another home. He was a solemn, earnest,\nthoughtful man; to whom such a matter as this was a phase of life\nvery serious, causing infinite present trouble, nay, causing\ntribulation, and, to the same extent, capable of causing infinite\njoy. From day to day he went about his work, seeing her amidst his\nministrations almost daily. And never during these days did he say\na word to her of his love,--never since that day in which he had\nplainly pleaded his cause in the muddy lane. To no one but Florence\nBurton had he since spoken of it, and Florence had certainly been\ntrue to her trust; but, notwithstanding all that, Fanny's conviction\nwas very strong.\n\nFlorence had counselled Mr. Saul to try again, and Mr. Saul was\nprepared to make the attempt; but he was a man who allowed himself to\ndo nothing in a hurry. He thought much of the matter before he could\nprepare himself to recur to the subject; doubting, sometimes, whether\nhe would be right to do so without first speaking to Fanny's father;\ndoubting, afterwards, whether he might not best serve his cause by\nasking the assistance of Fanny's mother. But he resolved at last that\nhe would depend on himself alone. As to the rector, if his suit to\nFanny were a fault against Mr. Clavering as Fanny's father, that\nfault had been already committed. But Mr. Saul would not admit to\nhimself that it was a fault. I fancy that he considered himself to\nhave, as a gentleman, a right to address himself to any lady with\nwhom he was thrown into close contact. I fancy that he ignored all\nwant of worldly preparation,--never for a moment attempting to place\nhimself on a footing with men who were richer than himself, and, as\nthe world goes, brighter, but still feeling himself to be in no way\nlower than they. If any woman so lived as to show that she thought\nhis line better than their line, it was open to him to ask such woman\nto join her lot to his. If he failed, the misfortune was his; and\nthe misfortune, as he well knew, was one which it was hard to bear.\nAnd as to the mother, though he had learned to love Mrs. Clavering\ndearly,--appreciating her kindness to all those around her, her\nconduct to her husband, her solicitude in the parish, all her genuine\ngoodness, still he was averse to trust to her for any part of his\nsuccess. Though Mr. Saul was no knight, though he had nothing\nknightly about him, though he was a poor curate in very rusty clothes\nand with manner strangely unfitted for much communion with the outer\nworld, still he had a feeling that the spoil which he desired to\nwin should be won by his own spear, and that his triumph would lose\nhalf its glory if it were not achieved by his own prowess. He was\nno coward, either in such matter as this or in any other. When\ncircumstances demanded that he should speak he could speak his mind\nfreely, with manly vigour, and sometimes not without a certain manly\ngrace.\n\nHow did Fanny know that it was coming? She did know it, though he had\nsaid nothing to her beyond his usual parish communications. He was\noften with her in the two schools; often returned with her in the\nsweet spring evenings along the lane that led back to the rectory\nfrom Cumberly Green; often inspected with her the little amounts of\nparish charities and entries of pence collected from such parents as\ncould pay. He had never reverted to that other subject. But yet Fanny\nknew that it was coming, and when she had questioned Harry about his\ntroubles she had been thinking also of her own.\n\nIt was now the middle of May, and the spring was giving way to the\nearly summer almost before the spring had itself arrived. It is so, I\nthink, in these latter years. The sharpness of March prolongs itself\nalmost through April; and then, while we are still hoping for the\nspring, there falls upon us suddenly a bright, dangerous, delicious\ngleam of summer. The lane from Cumberly Green was no longer muddy,\nand Fanny could go backwards and forwards between the parsonage and\nher distant school without that wading for which feminine apparel\nis so unsuited. One evening, just as she had finished her work, Mr.\nSaul's head appeared at the school-door, and he asked her whether she\nwere about to return home. As soon as she saw his eye and heard his\nvoice, she feared that the day was come. She was prepared with no\nnew answer, and could only give the answer that she had given before.\nShe had always told herself that it was impossible; and as to all\nother questions, about her own heart or such like, she had put such\nquestions away from her as being unnecessary, and, perhaps, unseemly.\nThe thing was impossible, and should therefore be put away out of\nthought, as a matter completed and at an end. But now the time was\ncome, and she almost wished that she had been more definite in her\nown resolutions.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Saul, I have just done.\"\n\n\"I will walk with you, if you will let me.\" Then Fanny spoke some\nwords of experienced wisdom to two or three girls, in order that\nshe might show to them, to him, and to herself that she was quite\ncollected. She lingered in the room for a few minutes, and was very\nwise and very experienced. \"I am quite ready now, Mr. Saul.\" So\nsaying, she came forth upon the green lane, and he followed her.\n\nThey walked on in silence for a little way, and then he asked her\nsome question about Florence Burton. Fanny told him that she had\nheard from Stratton two days since, and that Florence was well.\n\n\"I liked her very much,\" said Mr. Saul.\n\n\"So did we all. She is coming here again in the autumn; so it will\nnot be very long before you see her again.\"\n\n\"How that may be I cannot tell, but if you see her that will be of\nmore consequence.\"\n\n\"We shall all see her, of course.\"\n\n\"It was here, in this lane, that I was with her last, and wished her\ngood-by. She did not tell you of my having parted with her, then?\"\n\n\"Not especially, that I remember.\"\n\n\"Ah, you would have remembered if she had told you; but she was quite\nright not to tell you.\" Fanny was now a little confused, so that she\ncould not exactly calculate what all this meant. Mr. Saul walked on\nby her side, and for some moments nothing was said. After a while\nhe recurred again to his parting from Florence. \"I asked her advice\non that occasion, and she gave it me clearly,--with a clear purpose\nand an assured voice. I like a person who will do that. You are sure\nthen that you are getting the truth out of your friend, even if it be\na simple negative, or a refusal to give any reply to the question\nasked.\"\n\n\"Florence Burton is always clear in what she says.\"\n\n\"I had asked her if she thought that I might venture to hope for a\nmore favourable answer if I urged my suit to you again.\"\n\n\"She cannot have said yes to that, Mr. Saul; she cannot have done\nso!\"\n\n\"She did not do so. She simply bade me ask yourself. And she was\nright. On such a matter there is no one to whom I can with propriety\naddress myself, but to yourself. Therefore I now ask you the\nquestion. May I venture to have any hope?\"\n\nHis voice was so solemn, and there was so much of eager seriousness\nin his face that Fanny could not bring herself to answer him with\nquickness. The answer that was in her mind was in truth this: \"How\ncan you ask me to try to love a man who has but seventy pounds a\nyear in the world, while I myself have nothing?\" But there was\nsomething in his demeanour,--something that was almost grand in its\ngravity,--which made it quite impossible that she should speak to\nhim in that tone. But he, having asked his question, waited for an\nanswer; and she was well aware that the longer she delayed it, the\nweaker became the ground on which she was standing.\n\n\"It is quite impossible,\" she said at last.\n\n\"If it really be so,--if you will say again that it is so after\nhearing me out to an end, I will desist. In that case I will desist\nand leave you,--and leave Clavering.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Saul, do not do that,--for papa's sake, and because of the\nparish.\"\n\n\"I would do much for your father, and as to the parish I love it\nwell. I do not think I can make you understand how well I love it.\nIt seems to me that I can never again have the same feeling for any\nplace that I have for this. There is not a house, a field, a green\nlane, that is not dear to me. It is like a first love. With some\npeople a first love will come so strongly that it makes a renewal\nof the passion impossible.\" He did not say that it would be so with\nhimself, but it seemed to her that he intended that she should so\nunderstand him.\n\n\"I do not see why you should leave Clavering,\" she said.\n\n\"If you knew the nature of my regard for yourself, you would see\nwhy it should be so. I do not say that there ought to be any such\nnecessity. If I were strong there would be no such need. But I am\nweak,--weak in this; and I could not hold myself under such control\nas is wanted for the work I have to do.\" When he had spoken of his\nlove for the place,--for the parish, there had been something of\npassion in his language; but now in the words which he spoke of\nhimself and of his feeling for her, he was calm and reasonable and\ntranquil, and talked of his going away from her as he might have\ntalked had some change of air been declared necessary for his health.\nShe felt that this was so, and was almost angry with him.\n\n\"Of course you must know what will be best for yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes; I know now what I must do, if such is to be your answer. I have\nmade up my mind as to that. I cannot remain at Clavering, if I am\ntold that I may never hope that you will become my wife.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Saul--\"\n\n\"Well; I am listening. But before you speak, remember how\nall-important your words will be to me.\"\n\n\"No; they cannot be all-important.\"\n\n\"As regards my present happiness and rest in this world they will\nbe so. Of course I know that nothing you can say or do will hurt me\nbeyond that. But you might help me even to that further and greater\nbliss. You might help me too in that,--as I also might help you.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Saul--\" she began again, and then, feeling that she must go\non, she forced herself to utter words which at the time she felt to\nbe commonplace. \"People cannot marry without an income. Mr. Fielding\ndid not think of such a thing till he had a living assured to him.\"\n\n\"But, independently of that, might I hope?\" She ventured for an\ninstant to glance at his face, and saw that his eyes were glistening\nwith a wonderful brightness.\n\n\"How can I answer you further? Is not that reason enough why such a\nthing should not be even discussed?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Clavering, it is not reason enough. If you were to tell\nme that you could never love me,--me, personally,--that you could\nnever regard me with affection, that would be reason why I should\ndesist;--why I should abandon all my hope here, and go away from\nClavering for ever. Nothing else can be reason enough. My being poor\nought not to make you throw me aside if you loved me. If it were so\nthat you loved me, I think you would owe it me to say so, let me be\never so poor.\"\n\n\"I do not like you the less because you are poor.\"\n\n\"But do you like me at all? Can you bring yourself to love me? Would\nyou make the effort if I had such an income as you thought necessary?\nIf I had such riches, could you teach yourself to regard me as him\nwhom you were to love better than all the world beside? I call upon\nyou to answer me that question truly; and if you tell me that it\ncould be so, I will not despair, and I will not go away.\"\n\nAs he said this they came to a turn in the road which brought the\nparsonage gate within their view. Fanny knew that she would leave him\nthere and go in alone, but she knew also that she must say something\nfurther to him before she could thus escape. She did not wish to give\nhim an assurance of her positive indifference to him,--and still less\ndid she wish to tell him that he might hope. It could not be possible\nthat such an engagement should be approved by her father, nor could\nshe bring herself to think that she could be quite contented with\na lover such as Mr. Saul. When he had first proposed to her she\nhad almost ridiculed his proposition in her heart. Even now there\nwas something in it that was almost ridiculous;--and yet there was\nsomething in it also that touched her as being sublime. The man was\nhonest, good, and true,--perhaps the best and truest man that she had\never known. She could not bring herself to say to him any word that\nshould banish him for ever from the place he loved so well.\n\n\"If you knew your own heart well enough to answer me, you should do\nso,\" he went on to say. \"If you do not, say so, and I will be content\nto wait your own time.\"\n\n\"It would be better, Mr. Saul, that you should not think of this any\nmore.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Clavering; that would not be better,--not for me; for it\nwould prove me to be utterly heartless. I am not heartless. I love\nyou dearly. I will not say that I cannot live without you; but it is\nmy one great hope as regards this world, that I should have you at\nsome future day as my own. It may be that I am too prone to hope; but\nsurely, if that were altogether beyond hope, you would have found\nwords to tell me so by this time.\" They had now come to the gateway,\nand he paused as she put her trembling hand upon the latch.\n\n\"I cannot say more to you now,\" she said.\n\n\"Then let it be so. But, Miss Clavering, I shall not leave this place\ntill you have said more than that. And I will speak the truth to you,\neven though it may offend you. I have more of hope now than I have\never had before,--more hope that you may possibly learn to love me.\nIn a few days I will ask you again whether I may be allowed to speak\nupon the subject to your father. Now I will say farewell, and may God\nbless you; and remember this,--that my only earthly wish and ambition\nis in your hands.\" Then he went on his way towards his own lodgings,\nand she entered the parsonage garden by herself.\n\nWhat should she now do, and how should she carry herself? She would\nhave gone to her mother at once, were it not that she could not\nresolve what words she would speak to her mother. When her mother\nshould ask her how she regarded the man, in what way should she\nanswer that question? She could not tell herself that she loved Mr.\nSaul; and yet, if she surely did not love him,--if such love were\nimpossible,--why had she not said as much to him? We, however, may\ndeclare that that inclination to ridicule his passion, to think\nof him as a man who had no right to love, was gone for ever. She\nconceded to him clearly that right, and knew that he had exercised it\nwell. She knew that he was good and true, and honest, and recognized\nin him also manly courage and spirited resolution. She would not tell\nherself that it was impossible that she should love him.\n\nShe went up at last to her room doubting, unhappy, and ill at ease.\nTo have such a secret long kept from her mother would make her life\nunendurable to her. But she felt that, in speaking to her mother,\nonly one aspect of the affair would be possible. Even though she\nloved him, how could she marry a curate whose only income was seventy\npounds a year?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nTHE RUSSIAN SPY.\n\n\nWhen the baby died at Clavering Park, somebody hinted that Sir Hugh\nwould certainly quarrel with his brother as soon as Archie should\nbecome the father of a presumptive heir to the title and property.\nThat such would be the case those who best knew Sir Hugh would not\ndoubt. That Archie should have that of which he himself had been\nrobbed, would of itself be enough to make him hate Archie. But,\nnevertheless, at this present time, he continued to instigate his\nbrother in that matter of the proposed marriage with Lady Ongar.\nHugh, as well as others, felt that Archie's prospects were now\nimproved, and that he could demand the hand of a wealthy lady\nwith more of seeming propriety than would have belonged to such a\nproposition while the poor child was living. No one would understand\nthis better than Lady Ongar, who knew so well all the circumstances\nof the family. The day after the funeral the two brothers returned to\nLondon together, and Hugh spoke his mind in the railway carriage. \"It\nwill be no good for you to hang on about Bolton Street, off and on,\nas though she were a girl of seventeen,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm quite up to that,\" said Archie. \"I must let her know I'm there\nof course. I understand all that.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you do it? I thought you meant to go to her at once\nwhen we were talking about it before in London.\"\n\n\"So I did go to her, and got on with her very well, too, considering\nthat I hadn't been there long when another woman came in.\"\n\n\"But you didn't tell her what you had come about?\"\n\n\"No; not exactly. You see it doesn't do to pop at once to a widow\nlike her. Ongar, you know, hasn't been dead six months. One has to be\na little delicate in these things.\"\n\n\"Believe me, Archie, you had better give up all notions of being\ndelicate, and tell her what you want at once,--plainly and fairly.\nYou may be sure that she will not think of her former husband, if you\ndon't.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't think about him at all.\"\n\n\"Who was the woman you say was there?\"\n\n\"That little Frenchwoman,--the sister of the man;--Sophie she calls\nher. Sophie Gordeloup is her name. They are bosom friends.\"\n\n\"The sister of that count?\"\n\n\"Yes; his sister. Such a woman for talking! She said ever so much\nabout your keeping Hermione down in the country.\"\n\n\"The devil she did. What business was that of hers? That is Julia's\ndoing.\"\n\n\"Well; no, I don't think so. Julia didn't say a word about it. In\nfact, I don't know how it came up. But you never heard such a woman\nto talk,--an ugly, old, hideous little creature! But the two are\nalways together.\"\n\n\"If you don't take care you'll find that Julia is married to the\ncount while you are thinking about it.\"\n\nThen Archie began to consider whether he might not as well tell\nhis brother of his present scheme with reference to Julia. Having\ndiscussed the matter at great length with his confidential friend,\nCaptain Boodle, he had come to the conclusion that his safest course\nwould be to bribe Madame Gordeloup, and creep into Julia's favour by\nthat lady's aid. Now, on his return to London, he was about at once\nto play that game, and had already provided himself with funds for\nthe purpose. The parting with ready money was a grievous thing to\nArchie, though in this case the misery would be somewhat palliated by\nthe feeling that it was a bon\u00c3\u00a2 fide sporting transaction. He would\nbe lessening the odds against himself by a judicious hedging of his\nbets. \"You must stand to lose something always by the horse you mean\nto win,\" Doodles had said to him, and Archie had recognized the\npropriety of the remark. He had, therefore, with some difficulty,\nprovided himself with funds, and was prepared to set about his\nhedging operations as soon as he could find Madame Gordeloup on his\nreturn to London. He had already ascertained her address through\nDoodles, and had ascertained by the unparalleled acuteness of his\nfriend that the lady was--a Russian spy. It would have been beautiful\nto have seen Archie's face when this information was whispered into\nhis ear, in private, at the club. It was as though he had then been\nmade acquainted with some great turf secret, unknown to the sporting\nworld in general.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, drawing a long breath, \"no;--by George, is she?\"\n\nThe same story had been told everywhere in London of the little woman\nfor the last half dozen years, whether truly or untruly I am not\nprepared to say; but it had not hitherto reached Archie Clavering;\nand now, on hearing it, he felt that he was becoming a participator\nin the deepest diplomatic secrets of Europe.\n\n\"By George,\" said he, \"is she really?\"\n\nAnd his respect for the little woman rose a thousand per cent.\n\n\"That's what she is,\" said Doodles, \"and it's a doosed fine thing\nfor you, you know! Of course you can make her safe, and that will be\neverything.\"\n\nArchie resolved at once that he would use the great advantage which\nchance and the ingenuity of his friend had thrown in his way; but\nthat necessity of putting money in his purse was a sore grievance\nto him, and it occurred to him that it would be a grand thing if\nhe could induce his brother to help him in this special matter. If\nhe could only make Hugh see the immense advantage of an alliance\nwith the Russian spy, Hugh could hardly avoid contributing to the\nexpense,--of course on the understanding that all such moneys were\nto be repaid when the Russian spy's work had been brought to a\nsuccessful result. Russian spy! There was in the very sound of the\nwords something so charming that it almost made Archie in love with\nthe outlay. A female Russian spy too! Sophie Gordeloup certainly\nretained but very few of the charms of womanhood, nor had her\npresence as a lady affected Archie with any special pleasure; but yet\nhe felt infinitely more pleased with the affair than he would have\nbeen had she been a man spy. The intrigue was deeper. His sense of\ndelight in the mysterious wickedness of the thing was enhanced by an\nadditional spice. It is not given to every man to employ the services\nof a political Russian lady-spy in his love-affairs! As he thought of\nit in all its bearings, he felt that he was almost a Talleyrand, or,\nat any rate, a Palmerston.\n\nShould he tell his brother? If he could represent the matter in such\na light to his brother as to induce Hugh to produce the funds for\npurchasing the Spy's services, the whole thing would be complete\nwith a completeness that has rarely been equalled. But he doubted.\nHugh was a hard man,--a hard, unimaginative man, and might possibly\naltogether refuse to believe in the Russian spy. Hugh believed in\nlittle but what he himself saw, and usually kept a very firm grasp\nupon his money.\n\n\"That Madame Gordeloup is always with Julia,\" Archie said, trying the\nway, as it were, before he told his plan.\n\n\"Of course she will help her brother's views.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. Some of these foreign women ain't like\nother women at all. They go deeper;--a doosed sight deeper.\"\n\n\"Into men's pockets, you mean.\"\n\n\"They play a deep game altogether. What do you suppose she is, now?\"\nThis question Archie asked in a whisper, bending his head forward\ntowards his brother, though there was no one else in the carriage\nwith them.\n\n\"What she is? A thief of some kind probably. I've no doubt she's up\nto any roguery.\"\n\n\"She's a--Russian spy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've heard of that for the last dozen years. All the ugly old\nFrenchwomen in London are Russian spies, according to what people\nsay; but the Russians know how to use their money better than that.\nIf they employ spies, they employ people who can spy something.\"\n\nArchie felt this to be cruel,--very cruel, but he said nothing\nfurther about it. His brother was stupid, pigheaded, obstinate, and\nquite unfitted by nature for affairs of intrigue. It was, alas,\ncertain that his brother would provide no money for such a purpose\nas that he now projected; but, thinking of this, he found some\nconsolation in the reflection that Hugh would not be a participator\nwith him in his great secret. When he should have bought the Russian\nspy, he and Doodles would rejoice together in privacy without any\nthird confederate. Triumviri might be very well; Archie also had\nheard of triumviri; but two were company, and three were none.\nThus he consoled himself when his pigheaded brother expressed his\ndisbelief in the Russian spy.\n\nThere was nothing more said between them in the railway carriage,\nand, as they parted at the door in Berkeley Square, Hugh swore to\nhimself that this should be the last season in which he would harbour\nhis brother in London. After this he must have a house of his own\nthere, or have no house at all. Then Archie went down to his club,\nand finally arranged with Doodles that the first visit to the Spy\nshould be made on the following morning. After much consultation it\nwas agreed between them that the way should be paved by a diplomatic\nnote. The diplomatic note was therefore written by Doodles and copied\nby Archie.\n\n\"Captain Clavering presents his compliments to Madame Gordeloup,\nand proposes to call upon her to-morrow morning at twelve o'clock,\nif that hour will be convenient. Captain Clavering is desirous\nof consulting Madame Gordeloup on an affair of much importance.\"\n\"Consult me!\" said Sophie to herself, when she got the letter. \"For\nwhat should he consult me? It is that stupid man I saw with Julie.\nAh, well; never mind. The stupid man shall come.\" The commissioner,\ntherefore, who had taken the letter to Mount Street, returned to the\nclub with a note in which Madame Gordeloup expressed her willingness\nto undergo the proposed interview. Archie felt that the letter,--a\nletter from a Russian spy addressed positively to himself,--gave him\nalready diplomatic rank, and he kept it as a treasure in his breast\ncoat-pocket.\n\nIt then became necessary that he and his friend should discuss the\nmanner in which the Spy should be managed. Doodles had his misgivings\nthat Archie would be awkward, and almost angered his friend by the\nrepetition of his cautions. \"You mustn't chuck your money at her\nhead, you know,\" said Doodles.\n\n\"Of course not; but when the time comes I shall slip the notes into\nher hand,--with a little pressure perhaps.\"\n\n\"It would be better to leave them near her on the table.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; a great deal. It's always done in that way.\"\n\n\"But perhaps she wouldn't see them,--or wouldn't know where they came\nfrom.\"\n\n\"Let her alone for that.\"\n\n\"But I must make her understand what I want of her,--in return, you\nknow. I ain't going to give her twenty pounds for nothing.\"\n\n\"You must explain that at first; tell her that you expect her aid,\nand that she will find you a grateful friend,--a grateful friend,\nsay;--mind you remember that.\"\n\n\"Yes; I'll remember that. I suppose it would be as good a way as\nany.\"\n\n\"It's the only way, unless you want her to ring for the servant to\nkick you out of the house. It's as well understood as A B C, among\nthe people who do these things. I should say take jewellery instead\nof money if she were anything but a Russian spy; but they understand\nthe thing so well, that you may go farther with them than with\nothers.\"\n\nArchie's admiration for Sophie became still higher as he heard this.\n\"I do like people,\" said he, \"who understand what's what, and no\nmistake.\"\n\n\"But even with her you must be very careful.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; that's a matter of course.\"\n\n\"When I was declaring for the last time that she would find me a\ngrateful friend, just at the word grateful, I would put down the four\nfivers on the table, smoothing them with my hand like that.\" Then\nDoodles acted the part, putting a great deal of emphasis on the word\ngrateful, as he went through the smoothing ceremony with two or three\nsheets of club notepaper. \"That's your game, you may be sure. If you\nput them into her hand she may feel herself obliged to pretend to be\nangry; but she can't be angry simply because you put your money on\nher table. Do you see that, old fellow?\" Archie declared that he did\nsee it very plainly. \"If she does not choose to undertake the job,\nshe'll merely have to tell you that you have left something behind\nyou.\"\n\n\"But there's no fear of that, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I can't say. Her hands may be full, you know, or she may think you\ndon't go high enough.\"\n\n\"But I mean to tip her again, of course.\"\n\n\"Again! I should think so. I suppose she must have about a couple of\nhundred before the end of next month if she's to do any good. After a\nbit you'll be able to explain that she shall have a sum down when the\nmarriage has come off.\"\n\n\"She won't take the money and do nothing; will she?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; they never sell you like that. It would spoil their own\nbusiness if they were to play that game. If you can make it worth\nher while, she'll do the work for you. But you must be careful;--do\nremember that.\" Archie shook his head, almost in anger, and then went\nhome for his night's rest.\n\nOn the next morning he dressed himself in his best, and presented\nhimself at the door in Mount Street, exactly as the clock struck\ntwelve. He had an idea that these people were very punctilious as\nto time. Who could say but that the French ambassador might have\nan appointment with Madame Gordeloup at half-past one,--or perhaps\nsome emissary from the Pope! He had resolved that he would not take\nhis left glove off his hand, and he had thrust the notes in under\nthe palm of his glove, thinking he could get at them easier from\nthere, should they be wanted in a moment, than he could do from his\nwaistcoat pocket. He knocked at the door, knowing that he trembled as\nhe did so, and felt considerable relief when he found himself to be\nalone in the room to which he was shown. He knew that men conversant\nwith intrigues always go to work with their eyes open, and,\ntherefore, at once, he began to look about him. Could he not put the\nmoney into some convenient hiding-place,--now at once? There, in one\ncorner, was the spot in which she would seat herself upon the sofa.\nHe saw plainly enough, as with the eye of a Talleyrand, the marks\nthereon of her constant sitting. So he seized the moment to place a\nchair suitable for himself, and cleared a few inches on the table\nnear to it, for the smoothing of the bank-notes,--feeling, while\nso employed, that he was doing great things. He had almost made up\nhis mind to slip one note between the pages of a book, not with any\nwell-defined plan as to the utility of such a measure, but because it\nseemed to be such a diplomatic thing to do! But while this grand idea\nwas still flashing backwards and forwards across his brain, the door\nopened, and he found himself in the presence of--the Russian spy.\n\nHe at once saw that the Russian spy was very dirty, and that she wore\na nightcap, but he liked her the better on that account. A female\nRussian spy should, he felt, differ much in her attire from other\nwomen. If possible, she should be arrayed in diamonds, and pearl\near-drops, with as little else upon her as might be; but failing\nthat costume, which might be regarded as the appropriate evening spy\ncostume,--a tumbled nightcap, and a dirty white wrapper, old cloth\nslippers, and objectionable stockings were just what they should be.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the lady, \"you are Captain Clavering. Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"I am Captain Clavering. I had the honour of meeting you at Lady\nOngar's.\"\n\n\"And now you wish to consult me on an affair of great importance.\nVery well. You may consult me. Will you sit down--there.\" And Madame\nGordeloup indicated to him a chair just opposite to herself, and\nfar removed from that convenient spot which Archie had prepared for\nthe smoothing of the bank-notes. Near to the place now assigned to\nhim there was no table whatever, and he felt that he would in that\nposition be so completely raked by the fire of her keen eyes, that he\nwould not be able to carry on his battle upon good terms. In spite,\ntherefore, of the lady's very plain instructions, he made an attempt\nto take possession of the chair which he had himself placed; but it\nwas an ineffectual attempt, for the Spy was very peremptory with him.\n\"There, Captain Clavering; there; there; you will be best there.\"\nThen he did as he was bid, and seated himself, as it were, quite out\nat sea, with nothing but an ocean of carpet around him, and with no\npossibility of manipulating his notes except under the raking fire of\nthose terribly sharp eyes. \"And now,\" said Madame Gordeloup, \"you can\ncommence to consult me. What is the business?\"\n\nAh; what was the business? That was now the difficulty? In discussing\nthe proper way of tendering the bank-notes, I fear the two captains\nhad forgotten the nicest point of the whole negotiation. How was he\nto tell her what it was that he wanted to do himself, and what that\nshe was to be required to do for him? It behoved him above all things\nnot to be awkward! That he remembered. But how not to be awkward?\n\"Well!\" she said; and there was something almost of crossness in her\ntone. Her time, no doubt, was valuable. The French ambassador might\neven now be coming. \"Well?\"\n\n\"I think, Madame Gordeloup, you know my brother's sister-in-law, Lady\nOngar?\"\n\n\"What, Julie? Of course I know Julie. Julie and I are dear friends.\"\n\n\"So I supposed. That is the reason why I have come to you.\"\n\n\"Well;--well;--well?\"\n\n\"Lady Ongar is a person whom I have known for a long time, and for\nwhom I have a great,--I may say a very deep regard.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes. What a jointure she has! and what a park! Thousands and\nthousands of pounds,--and so beautiful! If I was a man I should have\na very deep regard too. Yes.\"\n\n\"A most beautiful creature;--is she not?\"\n\n\"Ah; if you had seen her in Florence, as I used to see her, in the\nlong summer evenings! Her lovely hair was all loose to the wind, and\nshe would sit hour after hour looking, oh, at the stars! Have you\nseen the stars in Italy?\"\n\nCaptain Clavering couldn't say that he had, but he had seen them\nuncommon bright in Norway, when he had been fishing there.\n\n\"Or the moon?\" continued Sophie, not regarding his answer. \"Ah; that\nis to live! And he, her husband, the rich lord, he was dying,--in a\nlittle room just inside, you know. It was very melancholy, Captain\nClavering. But when she was looking at the moon, with her hair all\ndishevelled,\" and Sophie put her hands up to her own dirty nightcap,\n\"she was just like a Magdalen; yes, just the same;--just the same.\"\n\nThe exact strength of the picture, and the nature of the comparison\ndrawn, were perhaps lost upon Archie; and indeed, Sophie herself\nprobably trusted more to the tone of her words, than to any idea\nwhich they contained; but their tone was perfect, and she felt that\nif anything could make him talk, he would talk now.\n\n\"Dear me! you don't say so. I have always admired her very much,\nMadame Gordeloup.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThe French ambassador was probably in the next street already, and if\nArchie was to tell his tale at all he must do it now.\n\n\"You will keep my secret if I tell it you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Is it me you ask that? Did you ever hear of me that I tell a\ngentleman's secret? I think not. If you have a secret, and will trust\nme, that will be good; if you will not trust me,--that will be good\nalso.\"\n\n\"Of course I will trust you. That is why I have come here.\"\n\n\"Then out with it. I am not a little girl. You need not be bashful.\nTwo and two make four. I know that. But some people want them to make\nfive. I know that too. So speak out what you have to say.\"\n\n\"I am going to ask Lady Ongar to--to--to--marry me.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed; with all the thousands of pounds and the beautiful park!\nBut the beautiful hair is more than all the thousands of pounds. Is\nit not so?\"\n\n\"Well, as to that, they all go together, you know.\"\n\n\"And that is so lucky! If they was to be separated, which would you\ntake?\"\n\nThe little woman grinned as she asked this question, and Archie, had\nhe at all understood her character, might at once have put himself\non a pleasant footing with her; but he was still confused and ill at\nease, and only muttered something about the truth of his love for\nJulia.\n\n\"And you want to get her to marry you?\"\n\n\"Yes; that's just it.\"\n\n\"And you want me to help you?\"\n\n\"That's just it again.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, if you'll stick to me, you know, and see me through\nit, and all that kind of thing, you'll find in me a most grateful\nfriend;--indeed, a most grateful friend.\" And Archie, as from his\nposition he was debarred from attempting the smoothing process, began\nto work with his right forefinger under the glove on his left hand.\n\n\"What have you got there?\" said Madame Gordeloup, looking at him with\nall her eyes.\n\nCaptain Clavering instantly discontinued the work with his finger,\nand became terribly confused. Her voice on asking the question had\nbecome very sharp; and it seemed to him that if he brought out\nhis money in that awkward, barefaced way which now seemed to be\nnecessary, she would display all the wrath of which a Russian spy\ncould be capable. Would it not be better that he should let the money\nrest for the present, and trust to his promise of gratitude? Ah, how\nhe wished that he had slipped at any rate one note between the pages\nof a book.\n\n\"What have you got there?\" she demanded again, very sharply.\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"It is not nothing. What have you got there? If you have got nothing,\ntake off your glove. Come.\"\n\nCaptain Clavering became very red in the face, and was altogether\nat a loss what to say or do. \"Is it money you have got there?\" she\nasked. \"Let me see how much. Come.\"\n\n\"It is just a few bank-notes I put in here to be handy,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah; that is very handy, certainly. I never saw that custom before.\nLet me look.\" Then she took his hand, and with her own hooked finger\nclawed out the notes. \"Ah! five, ten, fifteen, twenty pounds. Twenty\npounds is not a great deal, but it is very nice to have even that\nalways handy. I was wanting so much money as that myself; perhaps you\nwill make it handy to me.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I shall be most happy. Nothing on earth would give me\nmore pleasure.\"\n\n\"Fifty pounds would give me more pleasure; just twice as much\npleasure.\" Archie had begun to rejoice greatly at the safe\ndisposition of the money, and to think how excellently well this spy\ndid her business; but now there came upon him suddenly an idea that\nspies perhaps might do their business too well. \"Twenty pounds in\nthis country goes a very little way; you are all so rich,\" said the\nSpy.\n\n\"By George, I ain't. I ain't rich, indeed.\"\n\n\"But you mean to be--with Julie's money?\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--yes; and you ought to know, Madame Gordeloup, that I am now\nthe heir to the family estate and title.\"\n\n\"Yes; the poor little baby is dead, in spite of the pills and the\npowders, the daisies and the buttercups! Poor little baby! I had a\nbaby of my own once, and that died also.\" Whereupon Madame Gordeloup,\nputting up her hand to her eyes, wiped away a real tear with the\nbank-notes which she still held. \"And I am to remind Julie that you\nwill be the heir?\"\n\n\"She will know all about that already.\"\n\n\"But I will tell her. It will be something to say, at any rate,--and\nthat, perhaps, will be the difficulty.\"\n\n\"Just so! I didn't look at it in that light before.\"\n\n\"And am I to propose it to her first?\"\n\n\"Well; I don't know. Perhaps as you are so clever, it might be as\nwell.\"\n\n\"And at once?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; at once. You see, Madame Gordeloup, there may be so\nmany buzzing about her.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and some of them perhaps will have more than twenty pounds\nhandy. Some will buzz better than that.\"\n\n\"Of course I didn't mean that for anything more than just a little\ncompliment to begin with.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah; just a little compliment for beginning. And when will it be\nmaking a progress and going on?\"\n\n\"Making a progress!\"\n\n\"Yes; when will the compliment become a little bigger? Twenty pounds!\nOh! it's just for a few gloves, you know; nothing more.\"\n\n\"Nothing more than that, of course,\" said poor Archie.\n\n\"Well; when will the compliment grow bigger? Let me see. Julie has\nseven thousands of pounds, what you call, per annum. And have you\nseen that beautiful park? Oh! And if you can make her to look at the\nmoon with her hair down,--oh! When will that compliment grow bigger?\nTwenty pounds! I am ashamed, you know.\"\n\n\"When will you see her, Madame Gordeloup?\"\n\n\"See her! I see her every day, always. I will be there to-day, and\nto-morrow, and the next day.\"\n\n\"You might say a word then at once,--this afternoon.\"\n\n\"What! for twenty pounds! Seven thousands of pounds per annum; and\nyou give me twenty pounds! Fie, Captain Clavering. It is only just\nfor me to speak to you,--this! That is all. Come; when will you bring\nme fifty?\"\n\n\"By George--fifty!\"\n\n\"Yes, fifty;--for another beginning. What; seven thousands of pounds\nper annum, and make difficulty for fifty pounds! You have a handy way\nwith your glove. Will you come with fifty pounds to-morrow?\" Archie,\nwith the drops of perspiration standing on his brow, and now desirous\nof getting out again into the street, promised that he would come\nagain on the following day with the required sum.\n\n\"Just for another beginning! And now, good-morning, Captain\nClavering. I will do my possible with Julie. Julie is very fond of\nme, and I think you have been right in coming here. But twenty pounds\nwas too little, even for a beginning.\" Mercenary wretch; hungry,\ngreedy, ill-conditioned woman,--altogether of the harpy breed! As\nArchie Clavering looked into her grey eyes, and saw there her greed\nand her hunger, his flesh crept upon his bones. Should he not succeed\nwith Julia, how much would this excellent lady cost him?\n\nAs soon as he was gone the excellent lady made an intolerable\ngrimace, shaking herself and shrugging her shoulders, and walking\nup and down the room with her dirty wrapper held close round her.\n\"Bah,\" she said. \"Bah!\" And as she thought of the heavy stupidity\nof her late visitor she shrugged herself and shook herself again\nviolently, and clutched up her robe still more closely. \"Bah!\" It was\nintolerable to her that a man should be such a fool, even though she\nwas to make money by him. And then, that such a man should conceive\nit to be possible that he should become the husband of a woman with\nseven thousand pounds a year! Bah!\n\nArchie, as he walked away from Mount Street, found it difficult\nto create a triumphant feeling within his own bosom. He had been\nawkward, slow, and embarrassed, and the Spy had been too much for\nhim. He was quite aware of that, and he was aware also that even the\nsagacious Doodles had been wrong. There had, at any rate, been no\nnecessity for making a difficulty about the money. The Russian spy\nhad known her business too well to raise troublesome scruples on\nthat point. That she was very good at her trade he was prepared to\nacknowledge; but a fear came upon him that he would find the article\ntoo costly for his own purposes. He remembered the determined tone\nin which she had demanded the fifty pounds merely as a further\nbeginning.\n\nAnd then he could not but reflect how much had been said at the\ninterview about money,--about money for her, and how very little had\nbeen said as to the assistance to be given,--as to the return to be\nmade for the money. No plan had been laid down, no times fixed, no\nfacilities for making love suggested to him. He had simply paid over\nhis twenty pounds, and been desired to bring another fifty. The other\nfifty he was to take to Mount Street on the morrow. What if she were\nto require fifty pounds every day, and declare that she could not\nstir in the matter for less? Doodles, no doubt, had told him that\nthese first-class Russian spies did well the work for which they\nwere paid; and no doubt, if paid according to her own tariff, Madame\nGordeloup would work well for him; but such a tariff as that was\naltogether beyond his means! It would be imperatively necessary that\nhe should come to some distinct settlement with her as to price. The\ntwenty pounds, of course, were gone; but would it not be better that\nhe should come to some final understanding with her before he gave\nher the further fifty? But then, as he thought of this, he was aware\nthat she was too clever to allow him to do as he desired. If he went\ninto that room with the fifty pounds in his pockets, or in his glove,\nor, indeed, anywhere about his person, she would have it from him,\nlet his own resolution to make a previous bargain be what it might.\nHis respect for the woman rose almost to veneration, but with the\nveneration was mixed a strong feeling of fear.\n\nBut, in spite of all this, he did venture to triumph a little when\nhe met Doodles at the club. He had employed the Russian spy, and had\npaid her twenty pounds, and was enrolled in the corps of diplomatic\nand mysterious personages, who do their work by mysterious agencies.\nHe did not tell Doodles anything about the glove, or the way in which\nthe money was taken from him; but he did say that he was to see the\nSpy again to-morrow, and that he intended to take with him another\npresent of fifty pounds.\n\n\"By George, Clavvy, you are going it!\" said Doodles, in a voice that\nwas delightfully envious to the ears of Captain Archie. When he heard\nthat envious tone he felt that he was entitled to be triumphant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\"WHAT WOULD MEN SAY OF YOU?\"\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\n\"Harry, tell me the truth,--tell me all the truth.\" Harry Clavering\nwas thus greeted when in obedience to the summons from Lady Ongar, he\nwent to her almost immediately on his return to London.\n\nIt will be remembered that he had remained at Clavering some days\nafter the departure of Hugh and Archie, lacking the courage to face\nhis misfortunes boldly. But though his delay had been cowardly, it\nhad not been easy to him to be a coward. He despised himself for not\nhaving written with warm, full-expressed affection to Florence and\nwith honest clear truth to Julia. Half his misery rose from this\nfeeling of self-abasement, and from the consciousness that he was\nweak,--piteously weak, exactly in that in which he had often boasted\nto himself that he was strong. But such inward boastings are not\naltogether bad. They preserve men from succumbing, and make at any\nrate some attempt to realize themselves. The man who tells himself\nthat he is brave, will struggle much before he flies; but the man who\nnever does so tell himself, will find flying easy unless his heart\nbe of nature very high. Now had come the moment either for flying,\nor not flying; and Harry swearing that he would stand his ground,\nresolutely took his hat and gloves, and made his way to Bolton Street\nwith a sore heart.\n\nBut as he went he could not keep himself from arguing the matter\nwithin his own breast. He knew what was his duty. It was his duty to\nstick to Florence, not only with his word and his hand, but with his\nheart. It was his duty to tell Lady Ongar that not only his word was\nat Stratton, but his heart also, and to ask her pardon for the wrong\nthat he had done her by that caress. For some ten minutes as he\nwalked through the streets his resolve was strong to do this manifest\nduty; but, gradually, as he thought of that caress, as he thought\nof the difficulties of the coming interview, as he thought of\nJulia's high-toned beauty,--perhaps something also of her wealth\nand birth,--and more strongly still as he thought of her love for\nhim, false, treacherous, selfish arguments offered themselves to his\nmind,--arguments which he knew to be false and selfish. Which of them\ndid he love? Could it be right for him to give his hand without his\nheart? Could it really be good for Florence,--poor injured Florence,\nthat she should be taken by a man who had ceased to regard her\nmore than all other women? Were he to marry her now, would not\nthat deceit be worse than the other deceit? Or, rather, would\nnot that be deceitful, whereas the other course would simply be\nunfortunate,--unfortunate through circumstances for which he was\nblameless? Damnable arguments! False, cowardly logic, by which all\nmale jilts seek to excuse their own treachery to themselves and to\nothers!\n\nThus during the second ten minutes of his walk, his line of conduct\nbecame less plain to him, and as he entered Piccadilly he was\nracked with doubts. But instead of settling them in his mind he\nunconsciously allowed himself to dwell upon the words with which he\nwould seek to excuse his treachery to Florence. He thought how he\nwould tell her,--not to her face with spoken words, for that he\ncould not do,--but with written skill, that he was unworthy of her\ngoodness, that his love for her had fallen off through his own\nunworthiness, and had returned to one who was in all respects less\nperfect than she, but who in old days, as she well knew, had been\nhis first love. Yes! he would say all this, and Julia, let her anger\nbe what it might, should know that he had said it. As he planned\nthis, there came to him a little comfort, for he thought there was\nsomething grand in such a resolution. Yes; he would do that, even\nthough he should lose Julia also.\n\nMiserable clap-trap! He knew in his heart that all his logic was\nfalse, and his arguments baseless. Cease to love Florence Burton! He\nhad not ceased to love her, nor is the heart of any man made so like\na weather-cock that it needs must turn itself hither and thither, as\nthe wind directs, and be altogether beyond the man's control. For\nHarry, with all his faults, and in spite of his present falseness,\nwas a man. No man ceases to love without a cause. No man need cease\nto love without a cause. A man may maintain his love, and nourish\nit, and keep it warm by honest manly effort, as he may his probity,\nhis courage, or his honour. It was not that he had ceased to love\nFlorence; but that the glare of the candle had been too bright for\nhim and he had scorched his wings. After all, as to that embrace of\nwhich he had thought so much, and the memory of which was so sweet to\nhim and so bitter,--it had simply been an accident. Thus, writing in\nhis mind that letter to Florence which he knew, if he were an honest\nman, he would never allow himself to write, he reached Lady Ongar's\ndoor without having arranged for himself any special line of conduct.\n\nWe must return for a moment to the fact that Hugh and Archie had\nreturned to town before Harry Clavering. How Archie had been engaged\non great doings, the reader, I hope, will remember; and he may\nas well be informed here that the fifty pounds were duly taken\nto Mount Street, and were extracted from him by the Spy without\nmuch difficulty. I do not know that Archie in return obtained any\nimmediate aid or valuable information from Sophie Gordeloup; but\nSophie did obtain some information from him which she found herself\nable to use for her own purposes. As his position with reference to\nlove and marriage was being discussed, and the position also of the\ndivine Julia, Sophie hinted her fear of another Clavering lover. What\ndid Archie think of his cousin Harry? \"Why; he's engaged to another\ngirl,\" said Archie, opening wide his eyes and his mouth, and becoming\nvery free with his information. This was a matter to which Sophie\nfound it worth her while to attend, and she soon learned from Archie\nall that Archie knew about Florence Burton. And this was all that\ncould be known. No secret had been made in the family of Harry's\nengagement. Archie told his fair assistant that Miss Burton had\nbeen received at Clavering Park openly as Harry's future wife, and,\n\"by Jove, you know, he can't be coming it with Julia after that,\nyou know.\" Sophie made a little grimace, but did not say much. She,\nremembering that she had caught Lady Ongar in Harry's arms, thought\nthat, \"by Jove,\" he might be coming it with Julia, even after Miss\nBurton's reception at Clavering Park. Then, too, she remembered\nsome few words that had passed between her and her dear Julia after\nHarry's departure on the evening of the embrace, and perceived that\nJulia was in ignorance of the very existence of Florence Burton, even\nthough Florence had been received at the Park. This was information\nworth having,--information to be used! Her respect for Harry rose\nimmeasurably. She had not given him credit for so much audacity,\nso much gallantry, and so much skill. She had thought him to be a\npigheaded Clavering, like the rest of them. He was not pigheaded;\nhe was a promising young man; she could have liked him and perhaps\naided him,--only that he had shown so strong a determination to\nhave nothing to do with her. Therefore the information should be\nused;--and: it was used.\n\nThe reader will now understand what was the truth which Lady Ongar\ndemanded from Harry Clavering. \"Harry, tell me the truth; tell me all\nthe truth.\" She had come forward to meet him in the middle of the\nroom when she spoke these words, and stood looking him in the face,\nnot having given him her hand.\n\n\"What truth?\" said Harry. \"Have I ever told you a lie?\" But he knew\nwell what was the truth required of him.\n\n\"Lies can be acted as well as told. Harry, tell me all at once. Who\nis Florence Burton; who and what?\" She knew it all, then, and things\nhad settled themselves for him without the necessity of any action\non his part. It was odd enough that she should not have learned it\nbefore, but at any rate she knew it now. And it was well that she\nshould have been told;--only how was he to excuse himself for that\nembrace? \"At any rate speak to me,\" she said, standing quite erect,\nand looking as a Juno might have looked. \"You will acknowledge at\nleast that I have a right to ask the question. Who is this Florence\nBurton?\"\n\n\"She is the daughter of Mr. Burton of Stratton.\"\n\n\"And is that all that you can tell me? Come, Harry, be braver than\nthat. I was not such a coward once with you. Are you engaged to marry\nher?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Ongar, I am.\"\n\n\"Then you have had your revenge on me, and now we are quits.\" So\nsaying, she stepped back from the middle of the room, and sat herself\ndown on her accustomed seat. He was left there standing, and it\nseemed as though she intended to take no further notice of him. He\nmight go if he pleased, and there would be an end of it all. The\ndifficulty would be over, and he might at once write to Florence in\nwhat language he liked. It would simply be a little episode in his\nlife, and his escape would not have been arduous.\n\nBut he could not go from her in that way. He could not bring himself\nto leave the room without some further word. She had spoken of\nrevenge. Was it not incumbent on him to explain to her that there\nhad been no revenge; that he had loved, and suffered, and forgiven\nwithout one thought of anger;--and that then he had unfortunately\nloved again? Must he not find some words in which to tell her that\nshe had been the light, and he simply the poor moth that had burned\nhis wings?\n\n\"No, Lady Ongar,\" said he, \"there has been no revenge.\"\n\n\"We will call it justice, if you please. At any rate I do not mean to\ncomplain.\"\n\n\"If you ever injured me--\" he began.\n\n\"I did injure you,\" said she, sharply.\n\n\"If you ever injured me, I forgave you freely.\"\n\n\"I did injure you--\" As she spoke she rose again from her seat,\nshowing how impossible to her was that tranquillity which she had\nattempted to maintain. \"I did injure you, but the injury came to you\nearly in life, and sat lightly on you. Within a few months you had\nlearned to love this young lady at the place you went to,--the first\nyoung lady you saw! I had not done you much harm, Harry. But that\nwhich you have done me cannot be undone.\"\n\n\"Julia,\" he said, coming up to her.\n\n\"No; not Julia. When you were here before I asked you to call me so,\nhoping, longing, believing,--doing more, so much more than I could\nhave done, but that I thought my love might now be of service to you.\nYou do not think that I had heard of this then?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"No. It is odd that I should not have known it, as I now hear that\nshe was at my sister's house; but all others have not been as silent\nas you have been. We are quits, Harry; that is all that I have to\nsay. We are quits now.\"\n\n\"I have intended to be true to you;--to you and to her.\"\n\n\"Were you true when you acted as you did the other night?\" He could\nnot explain to her how greatly he had been tempted. \"Were you true\nwhen you held me in your arms as that woman came in? Had you not made\nme think that I might glory in loving you, and that I might show her\nthat I scorned her when she thought to promise me her secrecy;--her\nsecrecy, as though I were ashamed of what she had seen. I was not\nashamed,--not then. Had all the world known it, I should not have\nbeen ashamed. 'I have loved him long,' I should have said, 'and\nhim only. He is to be my husband, and now at last I need not be\nashamed.'\" So much she spoke, standing up, looking at him with firm\nface, and uttering her syllables with a quick clear voice; but at the\nlast word there came a quiver in her tone, and the strength of her\ncountenance quailed, and there was a tear which made dim her eye, and\nshe knew that she could no longer stand before him. She endeavoured\nto seat herself with composure; but the attempt failed, and as she\nfell back upon the sofa he just heard the sob which had cost her so\ngreat and vain an effort to restrain. In an instant he was kneeling\nat her feet, and grasping at the hand with which she was hiding her\nface. \"Julia,\" he said, \"look at me; let us at any rate understand\neach other at last.\"\n\n\"No, Harry; there must be no more such knowledge,--no more such\nunderstanding. You must go from me, and come here no more. Had it not\nbeen for that other night, I would still have endeavoured to regard\nyou as a friend. But I have no right to such friendship. I have\nsinned and gone astray, and am a thing vile and polluted. I sold\nmyself, as a beast is sold, and men have treated me as I treated\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Have I treated you so?\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry; you, you. How did you treat me when you took me in your\narms and kissed me,--knowing, knowing that I was not to be your wife?\nO God, I have sinned. I have sinned, and I am punished.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said he, rising from his knees, \"it was not as you say.\"\n\n\"Then how was it, sir? Is it thus that you treat other women;--your\nfriends, those to whom you declare friendship? What did you mean me\nto think?\"\n\n\"That I loved you.\"\n\n\"Yes; with a love that should complete my disgrace,--that should\nfinish my degradation. But I had not heard of this Florence Burton;\nand, Harry, that night I was so happy in my bed. And in that next\nweek when you were down there for that sad ceremony, I was happy\nhere, happy and proud. Yes, Harry, I was so proud when I thought that\nyou still loved me,--loved me in spite of my past sin, that I almost\nforgot that I was polluted. You have made me remember it, and I shall\nnot forget it again.\"\n\nIt would have been better for him had he gone away at once. Now\nhe was sitting in a chair, sobbing violently, and pressing away\nthe tears from his cheeks with his hands. How could he make her\nunderstand that he had intended no insult when he embraced her? Was\nit not incumbent on him to tell her that the wrong he then did was\ndone to Florence Burton, and not to her? But his agony was too much\nfor him at present, and he could find no words in which to speak to\nher.\n\n\"I said to myself that you would come when the funeral was over, and\nI wept for poor Hermy as I thought that my lot was so much happier\nthan hers. But people have what they deserve, and Hermy, who has done\nno such wrong as I have done, is not crushed as I am crushed. It was\njust, Harry, that the punishment should come from you, but it has\ncome very heavily.\"\n\n\"Julia, it was not meant to be so.\"\n\n\"Well; we will let that pass. I cannot unsay, Harry, all that I have\nsaid;--all that I did not say, but which you must have thought and\nknown when you were here last. I cannot bid you believe that I do\nnot--love you.\"\n\n\"Not more tenderly or truly than I love you.\"\n\n\"Nay, Harry, your love to me can be neither true nor tender,--nor\nwill I permit it to be offered to me. You do not think I would rob\nthat girl of what is hers. Mine for you may be both tender and true;\nbut, alas, truth has come to me when it can avail me no longer.\"\n\n\"Julia, if you will say that you love me, it shall avail you.\"\n\n\"In saying that, you are continuing to ill-treat me. Listen to me\nnow. I hardly know when it began, for, at first, I did not expect\nthat you would forgive me and let me be dear to you as I used to be;\nbut as you sat here, looking up into my face in the old way, it came\non me gradually,--the feeling that it might be so; and I told myself\nthat if you would take me I might be of service to you, and I thought\nthat I might forgive myself at last for possessing this money if I\ncould throw it into your lap, so that you might thrive with it in\nthe world; and I said to myself that it might be well to wait awhile,\ntill I should see whether you really loved me; but then came that\nburst of passion, and though I knew that you were wrong, I was\nproud to feel that I was still so dear to you. It is all over. We\nunderstand each other at last, and you may go. There is nothing to be\nforgiven between us.\"\n\nHe had now resolved that Florence must go by the board. If Julia\nwould still take him she should be his wife, and he would face\nFlorence and all the Burtons, and his own family, and all the world\nin the matter of his treachery. What would he care what the world\nmight say? His treachery to Florence was a thing completed. Now, at\nthis moment, he felt himself to be so devoted to Julia as to make him\nregard his engagement to Florence as one which must, at all hazards,\nbe renounced. He thought of his mother's sorrow, of his father's\nscorn,--of the dismay with which Fanny would hear concerning him\na tale which she would believe to be so impossible; he thought of\nTheodore Burton, and the deep, unquenchable anger of which that\nbrother was capable, and of Cecilia and her outraged kindness; he\nthought of the infamy which would be attached to him, and resolved\nthat he must bear it all. Even if his own heart did not move him so\nto act, how could he hinder himself from giving comfort and happiness\nto this woman who was before him? Injury, wrong, and broken-hearted\nwretchedness, he could not prevent; but, therefore, this part was as\nopen to him as the other. Men would say that he had done this for\nLady Ongar's money; and the indignation with which he was able to\nregard this false accusation,--for his mind declared such accusation\nto be damnably false,--gave him some comfort. People might say of him\nwhat they pleased. He was about to do the best within his power. Bad,\nalas, was the best, but it was of no avail now to think of that.\n\n\"Julia,\" he said, \"between us at least there shall be nothing to be\nforgiven.\"\n\n\"There is nothing,\" said she.\n\n\"And there shall be no broken love. I am true to you now,--as ever.\"\n\n\"And, what, then, of your truth to Miss Florence Burton?\"\n\n\"It will not be for you to rebuke me with that. We have, both of us,\nplayed our game badly, but not for that reason need we both be ruined\nand broken-hearted. In your folly you thought that wealth was better\nthan love; and I, in my folly,--I thought that one love blighted\nmight be mended by another. When I asked Miss Burton to be my wife\nyou were the wife of another man. Now that you are free again I\ncannot marry Miss Burton.\"\n\n\"You must marry her, Harry.\"\n\n\"There shall be no must in such a case. You do not know her, and\ncannot understand how good, how perfect she is. She is too good to\ntake a hand without a heart.\"\n\n\"And what would men say of you?\"\n\n\"I must bear what men say. I do not suppose that I shall be all\nhappy,--not even with your love. When things have once gone wrong\nthey cannot be mended without showing the patches. But yet men stay\nthe hand of ruin for a while, tinkering here and putting in a nail\nthere, stitching and cobbling; and so things are kept together. It\nmust be so for you and me. Give me your hand, Julia, for I have never\ndeceived you, and you need not fear that I shall do so now. Give me\nyour hand, and say that you will be my wife.\"\n\n\"No, Harry; not your wife. I do not, as you say, know that perfect\ngirl, but I will not rob one that is so good.\"\n\n\"You are bound to me, Julia. You must do as I bid you. You have told\nme that you love me; and I have told you,--and I tell you now, that I\nlove none other as I love you;--have never loved any other as I have\nloved you. Give me your hand.\" Then, coming to her, he took her hand,\nwhile she sat with her face averted from him. \"Tell me that you will\nbe my wife.\" But she would not say the words. She was less selfish\nthan he, and was thinking,--was trying to think what might be best\nfor them all, but, above all, what might be best for him. \"Speak to\nme,\" he said, \"and acknowledge that you wronged me when you thought\nthat the expression of my love was an insult to you.\"\n\n\"It is easy to say, speak. What shall I say?\"\n\n\"Say that you will be my wife.\"\n\n\"No,--I will not say it.\" She rose again from her chair, and took\nher hand away from him. \"I will not say it. Go now and think over\nall that you have done; and I also will think of it. God help me.\nWhat evil comes, when evil has been done! But, Harry, I understand\nyou now, and I at least will blame you no more. Go and see Florence\nBurton; and if, when you see her, you find that you can love her,\ntake her to your heart, and be true to her. You shall never hear\nanother reproach from me. Go now, go; there is nothing more to be\nsaid.\"\n\nHe paused a moment as though he were going to speak, but he left the\nroom without another word. As he went along the passage and turned on\nthe stairs he saw her standing at the door of the room, looking at\nhim, and it seemed that her eyes were imploring him to be true to her\nin spite of the words that she had spoken. \"And I will be true to\nher,\" he said to himself. \"She was the first that I ever loved, and I\nwill be true to her.\"\n\nHe went out, and for an hour or two wandered about the town, hardly\nknowing whither his steps were taking him. There had been a tragic\nseriousness in what had occurred to him this evening, which seemed to\ncover him with care, and make him feel that his youth was gone from\nhim. At any former period of his life his ears would have tingled\nwith pride to hear such a woman as Lady Ongar speak of her love for\nhim in such terms as she had used; but there was no room now for\npride in his bosom. Now at least he thought nothing of her wealth or\nrank. He thought of her as a woman between whom and himself there\nexisted so strong a passion as to make it impossible that he should\nmarry another, even though his duty plainly required it. The grace\nand graciousness of his life were over; but love still remained to\nhim, and of that he must make the most. All others whom he regarded\nwould revile him, and now he must live for this woman alone. She had\nsaid that she had injured him. Yes, indeed, she had injured him! She\nhad robbed him of his high character, of his unclouded brow, of that\nself-pride which had so often told him that he was living a life\nwithout reproach among men. She had brought him to a state in which\nmisery must be his bedfellow, and disgrace his companion;--but still\nshe loved him, and to that love he would be true.\n\nAnd as to Florence Burton;--how was he to settle matters with her?\nThat letter for which he had been preparing the words as he went to\nBolton Street, before the necessity for it had become irrevocable,\ndid not now appear to him to be very easy. At any rate he did not\nattempt it on that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE MAN WHO DUSTED HIS BOOTS WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF.\n\n\nWhen Florence Burton had written three letters to Harry without\nreceiving a word in reply to either of them, she began to be\nseriously unhappy. The last of these letters, received by him after\nthe scene described in the last chapter, he had been afraid to read.\nIt still remained unopened in his pocket. But Florence, though she\nwas unhappy, was not even yet jealous. Her fears did not lie in that\ndirection, nor had she naturally any tendency to such uneasiness.\nHe was ill, she thought; or if not ill in health, then ill at ease.\nSome trouble afflicted him of which he could not bring himself to\ntell her the facts, and as she thought of this she remembered her own\nstubbornness on the subject of their marriage, and blamed herself in\nthat she was not now with him, to comfort him. If such comfort would\navail him anything now, she would be stubborn no longer. When the\nthird letter brought no reply she wrote to her sister-in-law, Mrs.\nBurton, confessing her uneasiness, and begging for comfort. Surely\nCecilia could not but see him occasionally,--or at any rate have the\npower of seeing him. Or Theodore might do so,--as of course he would\nbe at the office. If anything ailed him would Cecilia tell her all\nthe truth? But Cecilia, when she began to fear that something did ail\nhim, did not find it very easy to tell Florence all the truth.\n\nBut there was jealousy at Stratton, though Florence was not jealous.\nOld Mrs. Burton had become alarmed, and was ready to tear the eyes\nout of Harry Clavering's head if Harry should be false to her\ndaughter. This was a misfortune of which, with all her brood, Mrs.\nBurton had as yet known nothing. No daughter of hers had been misused\nby any man, and no son of hers had ever misused any one's daughter.\nHer children had gone out into the world steadily, prudently, making\nno brilliant marriages, but never falling into any mistakes. She\nheard of such misfortunes around her,--that a young lady here had\nloved in vain, and that a young lady there had been left to wear the\nwillow; but such sorrows had never visited her roof, and she was\ndisposed to think,--and perhaps to say,--that the fault lay chiefly\nin the imprudence of mothers. What if at last, when her work in this\nline had been so nearly brought to a successful close, misery and\ndisappointment should come also upon her lamb! In such case Mrs.\nBurton, we may say, was a ewe who would not see her lamb suffer\nwithout many bleatings and considerable exercise of her maternal\nenergies.\n\nAnd tidings had come to Mrs. Burton which had not as yet been allowed\nto reach Florence's ears. In the office at the Adelphi was one Mr.\nWalliker, who had a younger brother now occupying that desk in Mr.\nBurton's office which had belonged to Harry Clavering. Through\nBob Walliker, Mrs. Burton learned that Harry did not come to the\noffice even when it was known that he had returned to London from\nClavering;--and she also learned at last that the young men in the\noffice were connecting Harry Clavering's name with that of the rich\nand noble widow, Lady Ongar. Then Mrs. Burton wrote to her son\nTheodore, as Florence had written to Theodore's wife.\n\nMrs. Burton, though she had loved Harry dearly, and had perhaps in\nmany respects liked him better than any of her sons-in-law, had,\nnevertheless, felt some misgivings from the first. Florence was\nbrighter, better educated, and cleverer than her elder sisters, and\ntherefore when it had come to pass that she was asked in marriage\nby a man somewhat higher in rank and softer in manners than they\nwho had married her sisters, there had seemed to be some reason\nfor the change;--but Mrs. Burton had felt that it was a ground for\napprehension. High rank and soft manners may not always belong to a\ntrue heart. At first she was unwilling to hint this caution even to\nherself; but at last, as her suspicions grew, she spoke the words\nvery frequently, not only to herself but also to her husband. Why,\noh why, had she let into her house any man differing in mode of life\nfrom those whom she had known to be honest and good? How would her\ngray hairs be made to go in sorrow to the grave, if, after all her\nold prudence and all her old success, her last pet lamb should be\nreturned to the mother's side, ill-used, maimed, and blighted!\n\nTheodore Burton, when he received his mother's letter, had not seen\nHarry since his return from Clavering. He had been inclined to be\nvery angry with him for his long and unannounced absence from the\noffice. \"He will do no good,\" he had said to his wife. \"He does\nnot know what real work means.\" But his anger turned to disgust as\nregarded Harry, and almost to despair as regarded his sister, when\nHarry had been a week in town and yet had not shown himself at the\nAdelphi. But at this time Theodore Burton had heard no word of Lady\nOngar, though the clerks in the office had that name daily in their\nmouths. \"Cannot you go to him, Theodore?\" said his wife. \"It is\nvery easy to say go to him,\" he replied. \"If I made it my business\nI could, of course, go to him, and no doubt find him if I was\ndetermined to do so;--but what more could I do? I can lead a horse to\nthe water, but I cannot make him drink.\" \"You could speak to him of\nFlorence.\" \"That is such a woman's idea,\" said the husband. \"When\nevery proper incentive to duty and ambition has failed him, he is to\nbe brought into the right way by the mention of a girl's name!\" \"May\nI see him?\" Cecilia urged. \"Yes,--if you can catch him; but I do not\nadvise you to try.\"\n\nAfter that came the two letters for the husband and wife, each of\nwhich was shown to the other; and then for the first time did either\nof them receive the idea that Lady Ongar with her fortune might be a\ncause of misery to their sister. \"I don't believe a word of it,\" said\nCecilia, whose cheeks were burning, half with shame and half with\nanger. Harry had been such a pet with her,--had already been taken\nso closely to her heart as a brother! \"I should not have suspected\nhim of that kind of baseness,\" said Theodore, very slowly. \"He is\nnot base,\" said Cecilia. \"He may be idle and foolish, but he is not\nbase.\"\n\n\"I must at any rate go after him now,\" said Theodore. \"I don't\nbelieve this;--I won't believe it. I do not believe it. But if it\nshould be true--!\"\n\n\"Oh, Theodore.\"\n\n\"I do not think it is true. It is not the kind of weakness I have\nseen in him. He is weak and vain, but I should have said that he was\ntrue.\"\n\n\"I am sure he is true.\"\n\n\"I think so. I cannot say more than that I think so.\"\n\n\"You will write to your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And may I ask Florence to come up? Is it not always better that\npeople should be near to each other when they are engaged?\"\n\n\"You can ask her, if you like. I doubt whether she will come.\"\n\n\"She will come if she thinks that anything is amiss with him.\"\n\nCecilia wrote immediately to Florence, pressing her invitation in the\nstrongest terms that she could use. \"I tell you the whole truth,\" she\nsaid. \"We have not seen him, and this, of course, has troubled us\nvery greatly. I feel quite sure he would come to us if you were here;\nand this, I think, should bring you, if no other consideration does\nso. Theodore imagines that he has become simply idle, and that he\nis ashamed to show himself here because of that. It may be that he\nhas some trouble with reference to his own home, of which we know\nnothing. But if he has any such trouble, you ought to be made aware\nof it, and I feel sure that he would tell you if you were here.\" Much\nmore she said, arguing in the same way, and pressing Florence to come\nto London.\n\nMr. Burton did not at once send a reply to his mother, but he wrote\nthe following note to Harry:--\n\n\n   Adelphi ----, May, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR CLAVERING,--I have been sorry to notice your\n   continued absence from the office, and both Cecilia and I\n   have been very sorry that you have discontinued coming to\n   us. But I should not have written to you on this matter,\n   not wishing to interfere in your own concerns, had I not\n   desired to see you specially with reference to my sister.\n   As I have that to say to you concerning her which I can\n   hardly write, will you make an appointment with me here,\n   or at my house? Or, if you cannot do that, will you say\n   when I shall find you at home? If you will come and dine\n   with us we shall like that best, and leave you to name an\n   early day: to-morrow, or the next day, or the day after.\n\n   Very truly yours,\n\n   THEODORE BURTON.\n\n\nWhen Cecilia's letter reached Stratton, and another post came\nwithout any letter from Harry, poor Florence's heart sank low in her\nbosom. \"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Burton, who watched her daughter\nanxiously while she was reading the letter. Mrs. Burton had not\ntold Florence of her own letter to her son; and now, having herself\nreceived no answer, looked to obtain some reply from that which her\ndaughter-in-law had sent.\n\n\"Cecilia wants me to go to London,\" said Florence.\n\n\"Is there anything the matter that you should go just now?\"\n\n\"Not exactly the matter, mamma; but you can see the letter.\"\n\nMrs. Burton read it slowly, and felt sure that much was the matter.\nShe knew that Cecilia would have written in that strain only under\nthe influence of some great alarm. At first she was disposed to\nthink that she herself would go to London. She was eager to know the\ntruth,--eager to utter her loud maternal bleatings if any wrong were\nthreatened to her lamb. Florence might go with her, but she longed\nherself to be on the field of action. She felt that she could almost\nannihilate any man by her words and looks who would dare to ill-treat\na girl of hers.\n\n\"Well, mamma;--what do you think?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet, my dear. I will speak to your papa before dinner.\"\nBut as Mrs. Burton had been usually autocratic in the management of\nher own daughters, Florence was aware that her mother simply required\na little time before she made up her mind. \"It is not that I want to\ngo to London--for the pleasure of it, mamma.\"\n\n\"I know that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Nor yet merely to see him!--though of course I do long to see him!\"\n\n\"Of course you do;--why shouldn't you?\"\n\n\"But Cecilia is so very prudent, and she thinks that it will be\nbetter. And she would not have pressed it, unless Theodore had\nthought so too!\"\n\n\"I thought Theodore would have written to me!\"\n\n\"But he writes so seldom.\"\n\n\"I expected a letter from him now, as I had written to him.\"\n\n\"About Harry, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. I did not mention it, as I was aware I might make you\nuneasy. But I saw that you were unhappy at not hearing from him.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, do let me go.\"\n\n\"Of course you shall go if you wish it;--but let me speak to papa\nbefore anything is quite decided.\"\n\nMrs. Burton did speak to her husband, and it was arranged that\nFlorence should go up to Onslow Crescent. But Mrs. Burton, though\nshe had been always autocratic about her unmarried daughters, had\nnever been autocratic about herself. When she hinted that she also\nmight go, she saw that the scheme was not approved, and she at once\nabandoned it. \"It would look as if we were all afraid,\" said Mr.\nBurton, \"and after all what does it come to?--a young gentleman does\nnot write to his sweetheart for two or three weeks. I used to think\nmyself the best lover in the world if I wrote once a month.\"\n\n\"There was no penny post then, Mr. Burton.\"\n\n\"And I often wish there was none now,\" said Mr. Burton. That matter\nwas therefore decided, and Florence wrote back to her sister-in-law,\nsaying that she would go up to London on the third day from that. In\nthe meantime, Harry Clavering and Theodore Burton had met.\n\nHas it ever been the lot of any unmarried male reader of these pages\nto pass three or four days in London, without anything to do,--to\nhave to get through them by himself,--and to have that burden on\nhis shoulder, with the additional burden of some terrible, wearing\nmisery, away from which there seems to be no road, and out of which\nthere is apparently no escape? That was Harry Clavering's condition\nfor some few days after the evening which he last passed in the\ncompany of Lady Ongar,--and I will ask any such unmarried man\nwhether, in such a plight, there was for him any other alternative\nbut to wish himself dead? In such a condition, a man can simply walk\nthe streets by himself, and declare to himself that everything is\nbad, and rotten, and vile, and worthless. He wishes himself dead, and\ncalculates the different advantages of prussic acid and pistols. He\nmay the while take his meals very punctually at his club, may smoke\nhis cigars, and drink his bitter beer, or brandy-and-water;--but he\nis all the time wishing himself dead, and making that calculation as\nto the best way of achieving that desirable result. Such was Harry\nClavering's condition now. As for his office, the doors of that place\nwere absolutely closed against him, by the presence of Theodore\nBurton. When he attempted to read he could not understand a word,\nor sit for ten minutes with a book in his hand. No occupation was\npossible to him. He longed to go again to Bolton Street, but he did\nnot even do that. If there, he could act only as though Florence had\nbeen deserted for ever;--and if he so acted he would be infamous for\nlife. And yet he had sworn to Julia that such was his intention. He\nhardly dared to ask himself which of the two he loved. The misery of\nit all had become so heavy upon him, that he could take no pleasure\nin the thought of his love. It must always be all regret, all sorrow,\nand all remorse. Then there came upon him the letter from Theodore\nBurton, and he knew that it was necessary that he should see the\nwriter.\n\nNothing could be more disagreeable than such an interview, but he\ncould not allow himself to be guilty of the cowardice of declining\nit. Of a personal quarrel with Burton he was not afraid. He felt,\nindeed, that he might almost find relief in the capability of being\nhimself angry with any one. But he must positively make up his mind\nbefore such an interview. He must devote himself either to Florence\nor to Julia;--and he did not know how to abandon the one or the\nother. He had allowed himself to be so governed by impulse that he\nhad pledged himself to Lady Ongar, and had sworn to her that he would\nbe entirely hers. She, it is true, had not taken him altogether\nat his word, but not the less did he know,--did he think that he\nknew,--that she looked for the performance of his promise. And she\nhad been the first that he had sworn to love!\n\nIn his dilemma he did at last go to Bolton Street, and there found\nthat Lady Ongar had left town for three or four days. The servant\nsaid that she had gone, he believed, to the Isle of Wight; and that\nMadame Gordeloup had gone with her. She was to be back in town early\nin the following week. This was on a Thursday, and he was aware that\nhe could not postpone his interview with Burton till after Julia's\nreturn. So he went to his club, and nailing himself as it were to\nthe writing-table, made an appointment for the following morning. He\nwould be with Burton at the Adelphi at twelve o'clock. He had been\nin trouble, he said, and that trouble had kept him from the office\nand from Onslow Crescent. Having written this, he sent it off, and\nthen played billiards and smoked and dined, played more billiards\nand smoked and drank till the usual hours of the night had come.\nHe was not a man who liked such things. He had not become what he\nwas by passing his earlier years after this fashion. But his misery\nrequired excitement,--and billiards with tobacco were better than the\ndesolation of solitude.\n\nOn the following morning he did not breakfast till near eleven. Why\nshould he get up as long as it was possible to obtain the relief\nwhich was to be had from dozing? As far as possible he would not\nthink of the matter till he had put his hat upon his head to go\nto the Adelphi. But the time for taking his hat soon came; and he\nstarted on his short journey. But even as he walked, he could not\nthink of it. He was purposeless, as a ship without a rudder, telling\nhimself that he could only go as the winds might direct him. How\nhe did hate himself for his one weakness! And yet he hardly made\nan effort to overcome it. On one point only did he seem to have a\nresolve. If Burton attempted to use with him anything like a threat\nhe would instantly resent it.\n\nPunctually at twelve he walked into the outer office, and was told\nthat Mr. Burton was in his room.\n\n\"Halloa, Clavering,\" said Walliker, who was standing with his back to\nthe fire, \"I thought we had lost you for good and all. And here you\nare come back again!\"\n\nHarry had always disliked this man, and now hated him worse than\never. \"Yes; I am here,\" said he, \"for a few minutes; but I believe\nI need not trouble you.\"\n\n\"All right, old fellow,\" said Walliker; and then Harry passed through\ninto the inner room.\n\n\"I am very glad to see you, Harry,\" said Burton, rising and giving\nhis hand cordially to Clavering. \"And I am sorry to hear that you\nhave been in trouble. Is it anything in which we can help you?\"\n\n\"I hope,--Mrs. Burton is well,\" said Harry, hesitating.\n\n\"Pretty well.\"\n\n\"And the children?\"\n\n\"Quite well. They say you are a very bad fellow not to go and see\nthem.\"\n\n\"I believe I am a bad fellow,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Sit down, Harry. It will be best to come at the point at once;--will\nit not? Is there anything wrong between you and Florence?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by wrong?\"\n\n\"I should call it very wrong,--hideously wrong, if after all that\nhas passed between you, there should now be any doubt as to your\naffection for each other. If such doubt were now to arise with her,\nI should almost disown my sister.\"\n\n\"You will never have to blush for her.\"\n\n\"I think not. I thank God that hitherto there have been no such\nblushes among us. And I hope, Harry, that my heart may never have\nto bleed for her. Come, Harry, let me tell you all at once like an\nhonest man. I hate subterfuges and secrets. A report has reached the\nold people at home,--not Florence, mind,--that you are untrue to\nFlorence, and are passing your time with that lady who is the sister\nof your cousin's wife.\"\n\n\"What right have they to ask how I pass my time?\"\n\n\"Do not be unjust, Harry. If you simply tell me that your visits\nto that lady imply no evil to my sister, I, knowing you to be\na gentleman, will take your word for all that it can mean.\" He\npaused, and Harry hesitated and could not answer. \"Nay, dear\nfriend,--brother, as we both of us have thought you,--come once more\nto Onslow Crescent and kiss the bairns, and kiss Cecilia, too, and\nsit with us at our table, and talk as you used to do, and I will ask\nno further question;--nor will she. Then you will come back here to\nyour work, and your trouble will be gone, and your mind will be at\nease; and, Harry, one of the best girls that ever gave her heart into\na man's keeping will be there to worship you, and to swear when your\nback is turned that any one who says a word against you shall be no\nbrother and no sister and no friend of hers.\"\n\nAnd this was the man who had dusted his boots with his\npocket-handkerchief, and whom Harry had regarded as being on that\naccount hardly fit to be his friend! He knew that the man was noble,\nand good, and generous, and true;--and knew also that in all that\nBurton said he simply did his duty as a brother. But not on that\naccount was it the easier for him to reply.\n\n\"Say that you will come to us this evening,\" said Burton. \"Even if\nyou have an engagement, put it off.\"\n\n\"I have none,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Then say that you will come to us, and all will be well.\"\n\nHarry understood of course that his compliance with this invitation\nwould be taken as implying that all was right. It would be so easy to\naccept the invitation, and any other answer was so difficult! But yet\nhe would not bring himself to tell the lie.\n\n\"Burton,\" he said, \"I am in trouble.\"\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" The man's voice was now changed, and so was\nthe glance of his eye. There was no expression of anger,--none as\nyet; but the sweetness of his countenance was gone,--a sweetness that\nwas unusual to him, but which still was at his command when he needed\nit.\n\n\"I cannot tell you all here. If you will let me come to you this\nevening I will tell you everything,--to you and to Cecilia too. Will\nyou let me come?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Will you dine with us?\"\n\n\"No;--after dinner; when the children are in bed.\" Then he went,\nleaving on the mind of Theodore Burton an impression that though\nsomething was much amiss, his mother had been wrong in her fears\nrespecting Lady Ongar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nFRESHWATER GATE.\n\n\nCount Pateroff, Sophie's brother, was a man who, when he had taken a\nthing in hand, generally liked to carry it through. It may perhaps\nbe said that most men are of this turn of mind; but the count was,\nI think, especially eager in this respect. And as he was not one who\nhad many irons in the fire, who made either many little efforts, or\nany great efforts after things altogether beyond his reach, he was\njustified in expecting success. As to Archie's courtship, any one\nwho really knew the man and the woman, and who knew anything of the\nnature of women in general, would have predicted failure for him.\nEven with Doodle's aid he could not have a chance in the race. But\nwhen Count Pateroff entered himself for the same prize, those who\nknew him would not speak of his failure as a thing certain.\n\nThe prize was too great not to be attempted by so very prudent a\ngentleman. He was less impulsive in his nature than his sister, and\ndid not open his eyes and talk with watering mouth of the seven\nthousands of pounds a year; but in his quiet way he had weighed and\ncalculated all the advantages to be gained, had even ascertained at\nwhat rate he could insure the lady's life, and had made himself\ncertain that nothing in the deed of Lord Ongar's marriage-settlement\nentailed any pecuniary penalty on his widow's second marriage. Then\nhe had gone down, as we know, to Ongar Park, and as he had walked\nfrom the lodge to the house and back again, he had looked around him\ncomplacently, and told himself that the place would do very well.\nFor the English character, in spite of the pigheadedness of many\nEnglishmen, he had,--as he would have said himself,--much admiration,\nand he thought that the life of a country gentleman, with a nice\nplace of his own,--with such a very nice place of his own as was\nOngar Park,--and so very nice an income, would suit him well in his\ndeclining years.\n\nAnd he had certain advantages, certain aids towards his object, which\nhad come to him from circumstances;--as, indeed, he had also certain\ndisadvantages. He knew the lady, which was in itself much. He knew\nmuch of the lady's history, and had that cognisance of the saddest\ncircumstances of her life, which in itself creates an intimacy. It is\nnot necessary now to go back to those scenes which had disfigured the\nlast months of Lord Ongar's life, but the reader will understand that\nwhat had then occurred gave the count a possible footing as a suitor.\nAnd the reader will also understand the disadvantages which had at\nthis time already shown themselves in the lady's refusal to see the\ncount.\n\nIt may be thought that Sophie's standing with Lady Ongar would be\na great advantage to her brother; but I doubt whether the brother\ntrusted either the honesty or the discretion of his sister. He\nwould have been willing to purchase such assistance as she might\ngive,--not in Archie's pleasant way, with bank-notes hidden under his\nglove,--but by acknowledgments for services to be turned into solid\nremuneration when the marriage should have taken place, had he not\nfeared that Sophie might communicate the fact of such acknowledgments\nto the other lady,--making her own bargain in doing so. He had\ncalculated all this, and had come to the conclusion that he had\nbetter make no direct proposal to Sophie; and when Sophie made a\ndirect proposal to him, pointing out to him in glowing language all\nthe fine things which such a marriage would give him, he had hardly\nvouchsafed to her a word of answer. \"Very well,\" said Sophie to\nherself;--\"very well. Then we both know what we are about.\"\n\nSophie herself would have kept Lady Ongar from marrying any one had\nshe been able. Not even a brother's gratitude would be so serviceable\nto her as the generous kindness of a devoted friend. That she might\nbe able both to sell her services to a lover, and also to keep Julie\nfrom marrying, was a lucky combination of circumstances which did\nnot occur to her till Archie came to her with the money in his glove.\nThat complicated game she was now playing, and was aware that Harry\nClavering was the great stumbling-block in her way. A woman even less\nclever than Sophie would have perceived that Lady Ongar was violently\nattached to Harry; and Sophie, when she did see it, thought that\nthere was nothing left for her but to make her hay while the sun was\nyet shining. Then she heard the story of Florence Burton; and again\nshe thought that Fortune was on her side. She told the story of\nFlorence Burton,--with what result we know; and was quite sharp\nenough to perceive afterwards that the tale had had its intended\neffect,--even though her Julie had resolutely declined to speak\neither of Harry Clavering or of Florence Burton.\n\nCount Pateroff had again called in Bolton Street, and had again been\nrefused admittance. It was plain to him to see by the servant's\nmanner that it was intended that he should understand that he was\nnot to be admitted. Under such circumstances, it was necessary that\nhe must either abandon his pursuit, or that he must operate upon\nLady Ongar through some other feeling than her personal regard for\nhimself. He might, perhaps, have trusted much to his own eloquence if\nhe could have seen her; but how is a man to be eloquent in his wooing\nif he cannot see the lady whom he covets? There is, indeed, the penny\npost, but in these days of legal restraints, there is no other method\nof approaching an unwilling beauty. Forcible abduction is put an end\nto as regards Great Britain and Ireland. So the count had resort to\nthe post.\n\nHis letter was very long, and shall not, therefore, be given to the\nreader. He began by telling Lady Ongar that she owed it to him for\nthe good services he had done her, to read what he might say, and to\nanswer him. He then gave her various reasons why she should see him,\npleading, among other things, in language which she could understand,\nthough the words were purposely as ambiguous as they could be made,\nthat he had possessed and did possess the power of doing her a\ngrievous injury, and that he had abstained, and--hoped that he might\nbe able to abstain for the future. She knew that the words contained\nno threat,--that taken literally they were the reverse of a threat,\nand amounted to a promise,--but she understood also all that he had\nintended to imply. Long as his own letter was, he said nothing in it\nas to his suit, confining himself to a request that she should see\nhim. But with his letter he sent her an enclosure longer than the\nletter itself, in which his wishes were clearly explained.\n\nThis enclosure purported to be an expression of Lord Ongar's wishes\non many subjects, as they had been communicated to Count Pateroff\nin the latter days of the lord's life; but as the manuscript was\naltogether in the count's writing, and did not even pretend to\nhave been subjected to Lord Ongar's eye, it simply amounted to the\ncount's own story of their alleged conversations. There might have\nbeen no such conversations, or their tenour might have been very\ndifferent from that which the count represented, or the statements\nand opinions, if expressed at all by Lord Ongar, might have been\nexpressed at times when no statements or opinions coming from him\ncould be of any value. But as to these conversations, if they could\nhave been verified as having come from Lord Ongar's mouth when he was\nin full possession of such faculties as he possessed,--all that would\nhave amounted to nothing with Lady Ongar. To Lord Ongar alive she had\nowed obedience, and had been obedient. To Lord Ongar dead she owed no\nobedience, and would not be obedient.\n\nSuch would have been her feelings as to any document which could have\nreached her, purporting to contain Lord Ongar's wishes; but this\ndocument was of a nature which made her specially antagonistic to the\nexercise of any such marital authority from the grave. It was very\nlong, and went into small details,--details which were very small;\nbut the upshot of it all was a tendering of great thanks to Count\nPateroff, and the expression of a strong wish that the count should\nmarry his widow. \"O. said that this would be the only thing for J.'s\nname.\" \"O. said that this would be the safest course for his own\nhonour.\" \"O. said, as he took my hand, that in promising to take this\nstep I gave him great comfort.\" \"O. commissioned me to speak to J. in\nhis name to this effect.\" The O. was of course Lord Ongar, and the J.\nwas of course Julia. It was all in French, and went on in the same\nstrain for many pages. Lady Ongar answered the letter as follows:--\n\n\n   Lady Ongar presents her compliments to Count Pateroff, and\n   begs to return the enclosed manuscript, which is, to her,\n   perfectly valueless. Lady Ongar must still decline, and\n   now more strongly than before, to receive Count Pateroff.\n\n   Bolton Street, May 186--.\n\n\nShe was quite firm as she did this. She had no doubt at all on the\nmatter. She did not feel that she wanted to ask for any advice. But\nshe did feel that this count might still work her additional woe,\nthat her cup of sorrow might not even yet be full, and that she was\nsadly,--sadly in want of love and protection. For aught she knew, the\ncount might publish the whole statement, and people might believe\nthat those words came from her husband, and that her husband had\nunderstood what would be best for her fame and for his honour. The\nwhole thing was a threat, and not to save herself from any misery,\nwould she have succumbed to a menace; but still it was possible that\nthe threat might be carried out.\n\nShe was sorely in want of love and protection. At this time, when the\ncount's letter reached her, Harry had been with her; and we know what\nhad passed between them. She had bid him go to Florence,--and love\nFlorence,--and marry Florence,--and leave her in her desolation. That\nhad been her last command to him. But we all know what such commands\nmean. She had not been false in giving him these orders. She had\nintended it at the moment. The glow of self-sacrifice had been warm\nin her bosom,--and she had resolved to do without that which she\nwanted in order that another might have it. But when she thought\nof it afterwards in her loneliness, she told herself that Florence\nBurton could not want Harry's love as she wanted it. There could\nnot be such need to this girl, who possessed father and mother, and\nbrothers, and youth, as there was to her, who had no other arm on\nwhich she could lean, besides that of the one man for whom she had\nacknowledged her love, and who had also declared his passion for her.\nShe made no scheme to deprive Florence of her lover. In the long\nhours of her own solitude she never revoked, even within her own\nbosom, the last words she had said to Harry Clavering. But not the\nless did she hope that he might come to her again, and that she\nmight learn from him that he had freed himself from that unfortunate\nengagement into which her falseness to him had driven him.\n\nIt was after she had answered Count Pateroff's letter that she\nresolved to go out of town for three or four days. For some short\ntime she had been minded to go away altogether, and not to return\ntill after the autumn; but this scheme gradually diminished itself\nand fell away, till she determined that she would come back\nafter three or four days. Then came to her Sophie,--her devoted\nSophie,--Sophie whom she despised and hated; Sophie of whom she was\nso anxious to rid herself that in all her plans there was some little\nunder-plot to that effect; Sophie whom she knew to be dishonest to\nher in any way that might make dishonesty profitable; and before\nSophie had left her, Sophie had engaged herself to go with her dear\nfriend to the Isle of Wight! As a matter of course, Sophie was to\nbe franked on this expedition. On such expeditions Sophies are\nalways franked as a matter of course. And Sophie would travel with\nall imaginable luxury,--a matter to which Sophie was by no means\nindifferent, though her own private life was conducted with an\neconomy that was not luxurious. But, although all these good things\ncame in Sophie's way, she contrived to make it appear that she was\ndevoting herself in a manner that was almost sacrificial to the\nfriend of her bosom. At the same time Lady Ongar sent a few words,\nas a message, to the count by his sister. Lady Ongar, having told to\nMadame Gordeloup the story of the document which had reached her, and\nhaving described her own answer, was much commended by her friend.\n\n\"You are quite right, dear, quite. Of course I am fond of my brother.\nEdouard and I have always been the best of friends. But that does not\nmake me think you ought to give yourself to him. Bah! Why should a\nwoman give away everything? Edouard is a fine fellow. But what is\nthat? Fine fellows like to have all the money themselves.\"\n\n\"Will you tell him,--from me,\" said Lady Ongar, \"that I will take it\nas a kindness on his part if he will abstain from coming to my house.\nI certainly shall not see him with my own consent.\"\n\nSophie promised,--and probably gave the message; but when she also\ninformed Edouard of Lady Ongar's intended visit to the Isle of Wight,\ntelling him the day on which they were going and the precise spot,\nwith the name of the hotel at which they were to stay, she went a\nlittle beyond the commission which her dearest friend had given her.\n\nAt the western end of the Isle of Wight, and on the further shore,\nabout three miles from the point of the island which we call\nthe Needles, there is a little break in the cliff, known to all\nstay-at-home English travellers as Freshwater Gate. Here there is a\ncluster of cottages and two inns, and a few bathing-boxes, and ready\naccess by easy ascents to the breezy downs on either side, over which\nthe sea air blows with all its salt and wholesome sweetness. At one\nof these two inns Lady Ongar located herself and Sophie; and all\nFreshwater, and all Yarmouth, and all that end of the island were\nalive to the fact that the rich widowed countess respecting whom\nsuch strange tales were told, had come on a visit to these parts.\nInnkeepers like such visitors. The more venomous are the stories told\nagainst them, the more money are they apt to spend, and the less\nlikely are they to examine their bills. A rich woman altogether\nwithout a character is a mine of wealth to an innkeeper. In the\npresent case no such godsend had come in the way,--but there was\nsupposed to be a something a little odd, and the visitor was on that\naccount the more welcome.\n\nSophie was not the most delightful companion in the world for such\na place. London was her sphere, as she herself had understood when\ndeclaiming against those husbands who keep their wives in the\ncountry. And she had no love for the sea specially, regarding all\nwinds as nuisances excepting such as had been raised by her own\nefforts, and thinking that salt from a saltcellar was more convenient\nthan that brought to her on the breezes. It was now near the end of\nMay, but she had not been half an hour at the inn before she was loud\nin demanding a fire,--and when the fire came she was unwilling to\nleave it. Her gesture was magnificent when Lady Ongar proposed to\nher that she should bathe. What,--put her own dear little dry body,\nby her own will, into the cold sea! She shrugged herself, and shook\nherself, and without speaking a word declined with so much eloquence\nthat it was impossible not to admire her. Nor would she walk. On the\nfirst day, during the warmest part of the day, she allowed herself to\nbe taken out in a carriage belonging to the inn; but after her drive\nshe clung to the fire, and consumed her time with a French novel.\n\nNor was Lady Ongar much more comfortable in the Isle of Wight than\nshe had been in London. The old poet told us how Black Care sits\nbehind the horseman, and some modern poet will some day describe to\nus that terrible goddess as she takes her place with the stoker close\nto the fire of the locomotive engine. Sitting with Sophie opposite\nto her, Lady Ongar was not happy, even though her eye rested on the\nlines of that magnificent coast. Once indeed, on the evening of their\nfirst day, Sophie left her, and she was alone for nearly an hour.\nAh, how happy could she have been if Harry Clavering might have been\nthere with her. Perhaps a day might come in which Harry might bring\nher there. In such a case Atra Cura would be left behind, and then\nshe might be altogether happy. She sat dreaming of this for above an\nhour, and Sophie was still away. When Sophie returned, which she did\nall too soon, she explained that she had been in her bedroom. She had\nbeen very busy, and now had come down to make herself comfortable.\n\nOn the next evening Lady Ongar declared her intention of going up\non the downs by herself. They had dined at five, so that she might\nhave a long evening, and soon after six she started. \"If I do not\nbreak down I will get as far as the Needles,\" she said. Sophie, who\nhad heard that the distance was three miles, lifted up her hands in\ndespair. \"If you are not back before nine I shall send the people\nafter you.\" Consenting to this with a laugh, Lady Ongar made her way\nup to the downs, and walked steadily on towards the extreme point of\nthe island. To the Needles themselves she did not make her way. These\nrocks are now approached, as all the stay-at-home travellers know,\nthrough a fort, and down to the fort she did not go. But turning a\nlittle from the highest point of the hill towards the cliffs on her\nleft hand, she descended till she reached a spot from which she could\nlook down on the pebbly beach lying some three hundred feet below\nher, and on the soft shining ripple of the quiet waters as they\nmoved themselves with a pleasant sound on the long strand which lay\nstretched in a line from the spot beneath her out to the point of\nthe island. The evening was warm, and almost transparent in its\nclearness, and very quiet. There was no sound even of a breeze. When\nshe seated herself close upon the margin of the cliff, she heard the\nsmall waves moving the stones which they washed, and the sound was\nas the sound of little children's voices, very distant. Looking\ndown, she could see through the wonderful transparency of the water,\nand the pebbles below it were bright as diamonds, and the sands\nwere burnished like gold. And each tiny silent wavelet as it moved\nup towards the shore and lost itself at last in its own effort,\nstretched itself the whole length of the strand. Such brightness on\nthe sea-shore she had never seen before, nor had she ever listened as\nnow she listened to that infantine babble of the baby waves. She sat\nthere close upon the margin, on a seat of chalk which the winds had\nmade, looking, listening, and forgetting for a while that she was\nLady Ongar whom people did not know, who lived alone in the world\nwith Sophie Gordeloup for her friend,--and whose lover was betrothed\nto another woman. She had been there perhaps half-an-hour, and had\nlearned to be at home on her perch, sitting there in comfort, with no\ndesire to move, when a voice which she well knew at the first sound\nstartled her, and she rose quickly to her feet. \"Lady Ongar,\" said\nthe voice, \"are you not rather near the edge?\" As she turned round\nthere was Count Pateroff with his hand already upon her dress, so\nthat no danger might be produced by the suddenness of his speech.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Lady Ongar, are you not rather near the edge?\"]\n\n\n\"There is nothing to fear,\" she said, stepping back from her seat. As\nshe did so, he dropped his hand from her dress, and, raising it to\nhis head, lifted his hat from his forehead. \"You will excuse me, I\nhope, Lady Ongar,\" he said, \"for having taken this mode of speaking\nto you.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not excuse you; nor, further than I can help it,\nshall I listen to you.\"\n\n\"There are a few words which I must say.\"\n\n\"Count Pateroff, I beg that you will leave me. This is treacherous\nand unmanly,--and can do you no good. By what right do you follow me\nhere?\"\n\n\"I follow you for your own good, Lady Ongar; I do it that you may\nhear me say a few words that are necessary for you to hear.\"\n\n\"I will hear no words from you,--that is, none willingly. By this\ntime you ought to know me and to understand me.\" She had begun to\nwalk up the hill very rapidly, and for a moment or two he had thought\nthat she would escape him; but her breath had soon failed her, and\nshe found herself compelled to stand while he regained his place\nbeside her. This he had not done without an effort, and for some\nminutes they were both silent. \"It is very beautiful,\" at last he\nsaid, pointing away over the sea.\n\n\"Yes;--it is very beautiful,\" she answered. \"Why did you disturb me\nwhen I was so happy?\" But the count was still recovering his breath,\nand made no answer to this question. When, however, she attempted to\nmove on again, still breasting the hill, he put his hand upon her arm\nvery gently.\n\n\"Lady Ongar,\" he said, \"you must listen to me for a moment. Why not\ndo it without a quarrel?\"\n\n\"If you mean that I cannot escape from you, it is true enough.\"\n\n\"Why should you want to escape? Did I ever hurt you? Before this have\nI not protected you from injury?\"\n\n\"No;--never. You protect me!\"\n\n\"Yes;--I; from your husband, from yourself, and from the world. You\ndo not know,--not yet, all that I have done for you. Did you read\nwhat Lord Ongar had said?\"\n\n\"I read what it pleased you to write.\"\n\n\"What it pleased me! Do you pretend to think that Lord Ongar did not\nspeak as he speaks there? Do you not know that those were his own\nwords? Do you not recognize them? Ah, yes, Lady Ongar; you know them\nto be true.\"\n\n\"Their truth or falsehood is nothing to me. They are altogether\nindifferent to me either way.\"\n\n\"That would be very well if it were possible; but it is not. There;\nnow we are at the top, and it will be easier. Will you let me have\nthe honour to offer you my arm? No! Be it so; but I think you would\nwalk the easier. It would not be for the first time.\"\n\n\"That is a falsehood.\" As she spoke she stepped before him, and\nlooked into his face with eyes full of passion. \"That is a positive\nfalsehood. I never walked with a hand resting on your arm.\"\n\nThere came over his face the pleasantest smile as he answered her.\n\"You forget everything,\" he said;--\"everything. But it does not\nmatter. Other people will not forget. Julie, you had better take me\nfor your husband. You will be better as my wife, and happier, than\nyou can be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Look down there, Count Pateroff;--down to the edge. If my misery is\ntoo great to be borne, I can escape from it there on better terms\nthan you propose to me.\"\n\n\"Ah! That is what we call poetry. Poetry is very pretty, and in\nsaying this as you do, you make yourself divine. But to be dashed\nover the cliffs and broken on the rocks;--in prose it is not so\nwell.\"\n\n\"Sir, will you allow me to pass on while you remain; or will you let\nme rest here, while you return alone?\"\n\n\"No, Julie; not so. I have found you with too much difficulty. In\nLondon, you see, I could not find you. Here, for a minute, you must\nlisten to me. Do you not know, Julie, that your character is in my\nhands?\"\n\n\"In your hands? No;--never; thank God, never. But what if it were?\"\n\n\"Only this,--that I am forced to play the only game that you leave\nopen to me. Chance brought you and me together in such a way that\nnothing but marriage can be beneficial to either of us;--and I swore\nto Lord Ongar that it should be so. I mean that it shall be so,--or\nthat you shall be punished for your misconduct to him and to me.\"\n\n\"You are both insolent and false. But listen to me, since you are\nhere and I cannot avoid you. I know what your threats mean.\"\n\n\"I have never threatened you. I have promised you my aid, but have\nused no threats.\"\n\n\"Not when you tell me that I shall be punished? But to avoid no\npunishment, if any be in your power, will I ever willingly place\nmyself in your company. You may write of me what papers you please,\nand repeat of me whatever stories you may choose to fabricate, but\nyou will not frighten me into compliance by doing so. I have, at any\nrate, spirit enough to resist such attempts as that.\"\n\n\"As you are living at present, you are alone in the world!\"\n\n\"And I am content to remain alone.\"\n\n\"You are thinking, then, of no second marriage?\"\n\n\"If I were, does that concern you? But I will speak no further word\nto you. If you follow me into the inn, or persecute me further by\nforcing yourself upon me, I will put myself under the protection of\nthe police.\"\n\nHaving said this, she walked on as quickly as her strength would\npermit, while he walked by her side, urging upon her his old\narguments as to Lord Ongar's expressed wishes, as to his own efforts\non her behalf,--and at last as to the strong affection with which he\nregarded her. But she kept her promise, and said not a word in answer\nto it all. For more than an hour they walked side by side, and during\nthe greater part of that time not a syllable escaped from her.\nFrom moment to moment she kept her eye warily on him, fearing that\nhe might take her by the arm, or attempt some violence with her.\nBut he was too wise for this, and too fully conscious that no\nsuch proceeding on his part could be of any service to him. He\ncontinued, however, to speak to her words which she could not avoid\nhearing,--hoping rather than thinking that he might at last frighten\nher by a description of all the evil which it was within his power\nto do her. But in acting thus he showed that he knew nothing of her\ncharacter. She was not a woman whom any prospect of evil could\npossibly frighten into a distasteful marriage.\n\nWithin a few hundred yards of the hotel there is another fort, and at\nthis point the path taken by Lady Ongar led into the private grounds\nof the inn at which she was staying. Here the count left her, raising\nhis hat as he did so, and saying that he hoped to see her again\nbefore she left the island.\n\n\"If you do so,\" said she, \"it shall be in presence of those who can\nprotect me.\" And so they parted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nWHAT CECILIA BURTON DID FOR HER SISTER-IN-LAW.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nAs soon as Harry Clavering had made his promise to Mr. Burton, and\nhad declared that he would be in Onslow Crescent that same evening,\nhe went away from the offices at the Adelphi, feeling it to be quite\nimpossible that he should recommence his work there at that moment,\neven should it ever be within his power to do so. Nor did Burton\nexpect that he should stay. He understood, from what had passed, much\nof Harry's trouble, if not the whole of it; and though he did not\ndespair on behalf of his sister, he was aware that her lover had\nfallen into a difficulty, from which he could not extricate himself\nwithout great suffering and much struggling. But Burton was a man\nwho, in spite of something cynical on the surface of his character,\nbelieved well of mankind generally, and well also of men as\nindividuals. Even though Harry had done amiss, he might be saved. And\nthough Harry's conduct to Florence might have been bad, nay, might\nhave been false, still, as Burton believed, he was too good to be\ncast aside, or spurned out of the way, without some further attempt\nto save him.\n\nWhen Clavering had left him Burton went back to his work, and after\na while succeeded in riveting his mind on the papers before him. It\nwas a hard struggle with him, but he did it, and did not leave his\nbusiness till his usual hour. It was past five when he took down his\nhat and his umbrella, and, as I fear, dusted his boots before he\npassed out of the office on to the passage. As he went he gave sundry\ndirections to porters and clerks, as was his wont, and then walked\noff intent upon his usual exercise before he should reach his home.\n\nBut he had to determine on much with reference to Florence and\nHarry before he saw his wife. How was the meeting of the evening to\ntake place, and in what way should it be commenced? If there were\nindispensable cause for his anger, in what way should he show it, and\nif necessity for vengeance, how should his sister be avenged? There\nis nothing more difficult for a man than the redressing of injuries\ndone to a woman who is very near to him and very dear to him. The\nwhole theory of Christian meekness and forgiveness becomes broken to\npieces and falls to the ground, almost as an absurd theory, even at\nthe idea of such wrong. What man ever forgave an insult to his wife\nor an injury to his sister, because he had taught himself that to\nforgive trespasses is a religious duty? Without an argument, without\na moment's thought, the man declares to himself that such trespasses\nas those are not included in the general order. But what is he to do?\nThirty years since his course was easy, and unless the sinner were\na clergyman, he could in some sort satisfy his craving for revenge\nby taking a pistol in his hand, and having a shot at the offender.\nThat method was doubtless barbarous and unreasonable, but it was\nsatisfactory and sufficed. But what can he do now? A thoughtful,\nprudent, painstaking man, such as was Theodore Burton, feels that it\nis not given to him to attack another with his fists, to fly at his\nenemy's throat, and carry out his purpose after the manner of dogs.\nSuch a one has probably something round his heart which tells him\nthat if so attacked he could defend himself; but he knows that he has\nno aptitude for making such onslaught, and is conscious that such\ndeeds of arms would be unbecoming to him. In many, perhaps in most of\nsuch cases, he may, if he please, have recourse to the laws. But any\naid that the law can give him is altogether distasteful to him. The\nname of her that is so dear to him should be kept quiet as the grave\nunder such misfortune, not blazoned through ten thousand columns\nfor the amusement of all the crowd. There is nothing left for him\nbut to spurn the man,--not with his foot but with his thoughts;\nand the bitter consciousness that to such spurning the sinner\nwill be indifferent. The old way was barbarous certainly, and\nunreasonable,--but there was a satisfaction in it that has been often\nwanting since the use of pistols went out of fashion among us.\n\nAll this passed through Burton's mind as he walked home. One would\nnot have supposed him to be a man eager for bloodshed,--he with a\nwife whom he deemed to be perfect, with children who in his eyes\nwere gracious as young gods, with all his daily work which he loved\nas good workers always do; but yet, as he thought of Florence, as\nhe thought of the possibility of treachery on Harry's part, he\nregarded almost with dismay the conclusion to which he was forced\nto come,--that there could be no punishment. He might proclaim the\noffender to the world as false, and the world would laugh at the\nproclaimer, and shake hands with the offender. To sit together with\nsuch a man on a barrel of powder, or fight him over a handkerchief,\nseemed to him to be reasonable, nay salutary, under such a grievance.\nThere are sins, he felt, which the gods should punish with instant\nthunderbolts, and such sins as this were of such a nature. His\nFlorence,--pure, good, loving, true, herself totally void of all\nsuspicion, faultless in heart as well as mind, the flower of that\nBurton flock which had prospered so well,--that she should be\nsacrificed through the treachery of a man who, at his best, had\nscarcely been worthy of her! The thought of this was almost too much\nfor him, and he gnashed his teeth as he went on his way.\n\nBut yet he had not given up the man. Though he could not restrain\nhimself from foreshadowing the misery that would result from such\nbaseness, yet he told himself that he would not condemn before\ncondemnation was necessary. Harry Clavering might not be good enough\nfor Florence. What man was good enough for Florence? But still, if\nmarried, Harry, he thought, would not make a bad husband. Many a man\nwho is prone enough to escape from the bonds which he has undertaken\nto endure,--to escape from them before they are riveted,--is mild\nenough under their endurance, when they are once fastened upon him.\nHarry Clavering was not of such a nature that Burton could tell\nhimself that it would be well that his sister should escape even\nthough her way of escape must lie through the fire and water of\noutraged love. That Harry Clavering was a gentleman, that he was\nclever, that he was by nature affectionate, soft in manner, tender of\nheart, anxious to please, good-tempered, and of high ambition, Burton\nknew well; and he partly recognized the fact that Harry had probably\nfallen into his present fault more by accident than by design.\nClavering was not a skilled and practiced deceiver. At last, as he\ndrew near to his own door, he resolved on the line of conduct he\nwould pursue. He would tell his wife everything, and she should\nreceive Harry alone.\n\nHe was weary when he reached home, and was a little cross with his\nfatigue. Good man as he was, he was apt to be fretful on the first\nmoment of his return to his own house, hot with walking, tired with\nhis day's labour, and in want of his dinner. His wife understood this\nwell, and always bore with him at such moments, coming down to him\nin the dressing-room behind the back parlour, and ministering to\nhis wants. I fear he took some advantage of her goodness, knowing\nthat at such moments he could grumble and scold without danger of\ncontradiction. But the institution was established, and Cecilia never\nrebelled against its traditional laws. On the present day he had\nmuch to say to her, but even that he could not say without some few\nsymptoms of petulant weariness.\n\n\"I'm afraid you've had a terrible long day,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know what you call terribly long. I find the days terribly\nshort. I have had Harry with me, as I told you I should.\"\n\n\"Well, well. Say in one word, dear, that it is all right,--if it is\nso.\"\n\n\"But it is not all right. I wonder what on earth the men do to the\nboots, that I can never get a pair that do not hurt me in walking.\"\nAt this moment she was standing over him with his slippers.\n\n\"Will you have a glass of sherry before dinner, dear; you are so\ntired?\"\n\n\"Sherry--no!\"\n\n\"And what about Harry? You don't mean to say--\"\n\n\"If you'll listen, I'll tell you what I do mean to say.\" Then he\ndescribed to her as well as he could, what had really taken place\nbetween him and Harry Clavering at the office.\n\n\"He cannot mean to be false, if he is coming here,\" said the wife.\n\n\"He does not mean to be false; but he is one of those men who can be\nfalse without meaning it,--who allow themselves to drift away from\ntheir anchors, and to be carried out into seas of misery and trouble,\nbecause they are not careful in looking to their tackle. I think that\nhe may still be held to a right course, and therefore I have begged\nhim to come here.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you are right, Theodore. He is so good and so\naffectionate, and he made himself so much one of us!\"\n\n\"Yes; too easily by half. That is just the danger. But look\nhere, Cissy. I'll tell you what I mean to do. I will not see him\nmyself;--at any rate, not at first. Probably I had better not see him\nat all. You shall talk to him.\"\n\n\"By myself!\"\n\n\"Why not? You and he have always been great friends, and he is a man\nwho can speak more openly to a woman than to another man.\"\n\n\"And what shall I say as to your absence?\"\n\n\"Just the truth. Tell him that I am remaining in the dining-room\nbecause I think his task will be easier with you in my absence. He\nhas got himself into some mess with that woman.\"\n\n\"With Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"Yes; not that her name was mentioned between us, but I suppose it is\nso.\"\n\n\"Horrible woman;--wicked, wretched creature!\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that, nor, as I suppose, do you.\"\n\n\"My dear, you must have heard.\"\n\n\"But if I had,--and I don't know that I have,--I need not have\nbelieved. I am told that she married an old man who is now dead, and\nI suppose she wants a young husband.\"\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"If I were you, Cissy, I would say as little as might be about her.\nShe was an old friend of Harry's--\"\n\n\"She jilted him when he was quite a boy; I know that;--long before he\nhad seen our Florence.\"\n\n\"And she is connected with him through his cousin. Let her be ever so\nbad, I should drop that.\"\n\n\"You can't suppose, Theodore, that I want even to mention her name.\nI'm told that nobody ever visits her.\"\n\n\"She needn't be a bit the worse on that account. Whenever I hear that\nthere is a woman whom nobody visits, I always feel inclined to go and\npay my respects to her.\"\n\n\"Theodore, how can you say so?\"\n\n\"And that, I suppose, is just what Harry has done. If the world and\nhis wife had visited Lady Ongar, there would not have been all this\ntrouble now.\"\n\nMrs. Burton of course undertook the task which her husband assigned\nto her, though she did so with much nervous trepidation, and many\nfears lest the desired object should be lost through her own\nmaladroit management. With her, there was at least no doubt as to the\nthing to be done,--no hesitation as to the desirability of securing\nHarry Clavering for the Burton faction. Everything in her mind was\nto be forgiven to Harry, and he was to be received by them all with\nopen arms and loving caresses, if he would only abandon Lady Ongar\naltogether. To secure her lover for Florence, was Mrs. Burton's\nsingle and simple object. She raised no questions now within her\nown breast as to whether Harry would make a good husband. Any such\nquestion as that should have been asked and answered before he had\nbeen accepted at Stratton. The thing to be done now was to bring\nHarry and Florence together, and,--since such terrible dangers were\nintervening,--to make them man and wife with as little further delay\nas might be possible. The name of Lady Ongar was odious to her. When\nmen went astray in matters of love it was within the power of Cecilia\nBurton's heart to forgive them; but she could not pardon women that\nso sinned. This countess had once jilted Harry, and that was enough\nto secure her condemnation. And since that what terrible things had\nbeen said of her! And dear, uncharitable Cecilia Burton was apt to\nthink, when evil was spoken of women,--of women whom she did not\nknow,--that there could not be smoke without fire. And now this woman\nwas a widow with a large fortune, and wanted a husband! What business\nhad any widow to want a husband? It is so easy for wives to speak\nand think after that fashion when they are satisfied with their own\nventures.\n\nIt was arranged that when Harry came to the door, Mrs. Burton should\ngo up alone to the drawing-room and receive him there, remaining\nwith her husband in the dining-room till he should come. Twice while\nsitting downstairs after the cloth was gone she ran upstairs with the\navowed purpose of going into the nursery, but in truth that she might\nsee that the room was comfortable, that it looked pretty, and that\nthe chairs were so arranged as to be convenient. The two eldest\nchildren were with them in the parlour, and when she started on\nher second errand, Cissy reminded her that baby would be asleep.\nTheodore, who understood the little manoeuvre, smiled but said\nnothing, and his wife, who in such matters was resolute, went and\nmade her further little changes in the furniture. At last there\ncame the knock at the door,--the expected knock, a knock which told\nsomething of the hesitating unhappy mind of him who had rapped, and\nMrs. Burton started on her business. \"Tell him just simply why you\nare there alone,\" said her husband.\n\n\"Is it Harry Clavering?\" Cissy asked, \"and mayn't I go?\"\n\n\"It is Harry Clavering,\" her father said, \"and you may not go.\nIndeed, it is time you went somewhere else.\"\n\nIt was Harry Clavering. He had not spent a pleasant day since he had\nleft Mr. Beilby's offices in the morning, and, now that he had come\nto Onslow Crescent, he did not expect to spend a pleasant evening.\nWhen I declare that as yet he had not come to any firm resolution, I\nfear that he will be held as being too weak for the r\u00c3\u00b4le of hero even\nin such pages as these. Perhaps no terms have been so injurious to\nthe profession of the novelist as those two words, hero and heroine.\nIn spite of the latitude which is allowed to the writer in putting\nhis own interpretation upon these words, something heroic is still\nexpected; whereas, if he attempt to paint from Nature, how little\nthat is heroic should he describe! How many young men, subjected to\nthe temptations which had befallen Harry Clavering,--how many young\nmen whom you, delicate reader, number among your friends,--would have\ncome out from them unscathed? A man, you say, delicate reader, a true\nman can love but one woman,--but one at a time. So you say, and are\nso convinced; but no conviction was ever more false. When a true man\nhas loved with all his heart and all his soul,--does he cease to\nlove,--does he cleanse his heart of that passion when circumstances\nrun against him, and he is forced to turn elsewhere for his life's\ncompanion? Or is he untrue as a lover in that he does not waste his\nlife in desolation, because he has been disappointed? Or does his old\nlove perish and die away, because another has crept into his heart?\nNo; the first love, if that was true, is ever there; and should she\nand he meet after many years, though their heads be gray and their\ncheeks wrinkled, there will still be a touch of the old passion as\ntheir hands meet for a moment. Methinks that love never dies, unless\nit be murdered by downright ill-usage. It may be so murdered, but\neven ill-usage will more often fail than succeed in that enterprise.\nHow, then, could Harry fail to love the woman whom he had loved\nfirst, when she returned to him still young, still beautiful, and\ntold him, with all her charms and all her flattery, how her heart\nstood towards him?\n\nBut it is not to be thought that I excuse him altogether. A man,\nthough he may love many, should be devoted only to one. The man's\nfeeling to the woman whom he is to marry should be this:--that not\nfrom love only, but from chivalry, from manhood, and from duty, he\nwill be prepared always, and at all hazards, to defend her from every\nmisadventure, to struggle ever that she may be happy, to see that no\nwind blows upon her with needless severity, that no ravening wolf\nof a misery shall come near her, that her path be swept clean for\nher,--as clean as may be, and that her roof-tree be made firm upon a\nrock. There is much of this which is quite independent of love,--much\nof it that may be done without love. This is devotion, and it is this\nwhich a man owes to the woman who has once promised to be his wife,\nand has not forfeited her right. Doubtless Harry Clavering should\nhave remembered this at the first moment of his weakness in Lady\nOngar's drawing-room. Doubtless he should have known at once that\nhis duty to Florence made it necessary that he should declare his\nengagement,--even though, in doing so, he might have seemed to\ncaution Lady Ongar on that point on which no woman can endure a\ncaution. But the fault was hers, and the caution was needed. No doubt\nhe should not have returned to Bolton Street. He should not have\ncozened himself by trusting himself to her assurances of friendship;\nhe should have kept warm his love for the woman to whom his hand was\nowed, not suffering himself to make comparisons to her injury. He\nshould have been chivalric, manly, full of high duty. He should have\nbeen all this, and full also of love, and then he would have been a\nhero. But men as I see them are not often heroic.\n\nAs he entered the room he saw Mrs. Burton at once, and then looked\nround quickly for her husband. \"Harry,\" said she, \"I am so glad to\nsee you once again,\" and she gave him her hand, and smiled on him\nwith that sweet look which used to make him feel that it was pleasant\nto be near her. He took her hand and muttered some word of greeting,\nand then looked round again for Mr. Burton. \"Theodore is not here,\"\nshe said; \"he thought it better that you and I should have a little\ntalk together. He said you would like it best so; but perhaps I ought\nnot to tell you that.\"\n\n\"I do like it best so,--much best. I can speak to you as I could\nhardly speak to him.\"\n\n\"What is it, Harry, that ails you? What has kept you away from us?\nWhy do you leave poor Flo so long without writing to her? She will be\nhere on Monday. You will come and see her then; or perhaps you will\ngo with me and meet her at the station?\"\n\n\"Burton said that she was coming, but I did not understand that it\nwas so soon.\"\n\n\"You do not think it too soon, Harry; do you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harry, but his tone belied his assertion. At any rate\nhe had not pretended to display any of a lover's rapture at this\nprospect of seeing the lady whom he loved.\n\n\"Sit down, Harry. Why do you stand like that and look so comfortless?\nTheodore says that you have some trouble at heart. Is it a trouble\nthat you can tell to a friend such as I am?\"\n\n\"It is very hard to tell. Oh, Mrs. Burton, I am broken-hearted. For\nthe last two weeks I have wished that I might die.\"\n\n\"Do not say that, Harry; that would be wicked.\"\n\n\"Wicked or not, it is true. I have been so wretched that I have\nnot known how to hold myself. I could not bring myself to write to\nFlorence.\"\n\n\"But why not? You do not mean that you are false to Florence. You\ncannot mean that. Harry, say at once that it is not so, and I\nwill promise you her forgiveness, Theodore's forgiveness, all our\nforgiveness for anything else. Oh, Harry, say anything but that.\" In\nanswer to this Harry Clavering had nothing to say, but sat with his\nhead resting on his arm and his face turned away from her. \"Speak,\nHarry; if you are a man, say something. Is it so? If it be so, I\nbelieve that you will have killed her. Why do you not speak to me?\nHarry Clavering, tell me what is the truth.\"\n\nThen he told her all his story, not looking her once in the face,\nnot changing his voice, suppressing his emotion till he came to the\nhistory of the present days. He described to her how he had loved\nJulia Brabazon, and how his love had been treated by her; how he had\nsworn to himself, when he knew that she had in truth become that\nlord's wife, that for her sake he would keep himself from loving any\nother woman. Then he spoke of his first days at Stratton and of his\nearly acquaintance with Florence, and told her how different had been\nhis second love,--how it had grown gradually and with no check to his\nconfidence, till he felt sure that the sweet girl who was so often\nnear him would, if he could win her, be to him a source of joy for\nall his life. \"And so she shall,\" said Cecilia, with tears running\ndown her cheeks; \"she shall do so yet.\" And he went on with his tale,\nsaying how pleasant it had been for him to find himself at home in\nOnslow Crescent, how he had joyed in calling her Cecilia, and having\nher infants in his arms, as though they were already partly belonging\nto him. And he told her how he had met the young widow at the\nstation, having employed himself on her behalf at her sister's\ninstance; and how cold she had been to him, offending him by her\nsilence and sombre pride. \"False woman!\" exclaimed Mrs. Burton. \"Oh,\nCecilia, do not abuse her,--do not say a word till you know all.\" \"I\nknow that she is false,\" said Mrs. Burton, with vehement indignation.\n\"She is not false,\" said Harry; \"if there be falsehood, it is mine.\"\nThen he went on, and said how different she was when next he saw her.\nHow then he understood that her solemn and haughty manner had been\nalmost forced on her by the mode of her return, with no other friend\nto meet her. \"She has deserved no friend,\" said Mrs. Burton. \"You\nwrong her,\" said Harry; \"you do not know her. If any woman has been\never sinned against, it is she.\" \"But was she not false from the very\nfirst,--false, that she might become rich by marrying a man that she\ndid not love? Will you speak up for her after that? Oh, Harry, think\nof it.\"\n\n\"I will speak up for her,\" said Harry; and now it seemed for the\nfirst time that something of his old boldness had returned to him. \"I\nwill speak up for her, although she did as you say, because she has\nsuffered as few women have been made to suffer, and because she has\nrepented in ashes as few women are called on to repent.\" And now as\nhe warmed with his feeling for her, he uttered his words faster and\nwith less of shame in his voice. He described how he had gone again\nand again to Bolton Street, thinking no evil, till--till--till\nsomething of the old feeling had come back upon him. He meant to be\ntrue in his story, but I doubt whether he told all the truth. How\ncould he tell it all? How could he confess that the blaze of the\nwoman's womanhood, the flame of her beauty, and the fire engendered\nby her mingled rank and suffering, had singed him and burned him\nup, poor moth that he was? \"And then at last I learned,\" said he,\n\"that--that she had loved me more than I had believed.\"\n\n\"And is Florence to suffer because she has postponed her love of you\nto her love of money?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Burton, if you do not understand it now, I do not know that I\ncan tell you more. Florence alone in this matter is altogether good.\nLady Ongar has been wrong, and I have been wrong. I sometimes think\nthat Florence is too good for me.\"\n\n\"It is for her to say that, if it be necessary.\"\n\n\"I have told you all now, and you will know why I have not come to\nyou.\"\n\n\"No, Harry; you have not told me all. Have you told that--woman that\nshe should be your wife?\" To this question he made no immediate\nanswer, and she repeated it. \"Tell me; have you told her you would\nmarry her?\"\n\n\"I did tell her so.\"\n\n\"And you will keep your word to her?\" Harry, as he heard the words,\nwas struck with awe that there should be such vehemence, such anger,\nin the voice of so gentle a woman as Cecilia Burton. \"Answer me, sir,\ndo you mean to marry this--countess?\" But still he made no answer. \"I\ndo not wonder that you cannot speak,\" she said. \"Oh, Florence,--oh,\nmy darling; my lost, broken-hearted angel!\" Then she turned away her\nface and wept.\n\n\"Cecilia,\" he said, attempting to approach her with his hand, without\nrising from his chair.\n\n\"No, sir; when I desired you to call me so, it was because I thought\nyou were to be a brother. I did not think that there could be a thing\nso weak as you. Perhaps you had better go now, lest you should meet\nmy husband in his wrath, and he should spurn you.\"\n\nBut Harry Clavering still sat in his chair, motionless,--motionless,\nand without a word. After a while he turned his face towards her, and\neven in her own misery she was stricken by the wretchedness of his\ncountenance. Suddenly she rose quickly from her chair, and coming\nclose to him, threw herself on her knees before him. \"Harry,\" she\nsaid, \"Harry; it is not yet too late. Be our own Harry again; our\ndearest Harry. Say that it shall be so. What is this woman to you?\nWhat has she done for you, that for her you should throw aside such a\none as our Florence? Is she noble, and good, and pure and spotless as\nFlorence is? Will she love you with such love as Florence's? Will she\nbelieve in you as Florence believes? Yes, Harry, she believes yet.\nShe knows nothing of this, and shall know nothing, if you will only\nsay that you will be true. No one shall know, and I will remember it\nonly to remember your goodness afterwards. Think of it, Harry; there\ncan be no falseness to one who has been so false to you. Harry, you\nwill not destroy us all at one blow?\"\n\nNever before was man so supplicated to take into his arms youth and\nbeauty and feminine purity! And in truth he would have yielded, as\nindeed, what man would not have yielded,--had not Mrs. Burton been\ninterrupted in her prayers. The step of her husband was heard upon\nthe stairs, and she, rising from her knees, whispered quickly, \"Do\nnot tell him that it is settled. Let me tell him when you are gone.\"\n\n\"You two have been a long time together,\" said Theodore, as he came\nin.\n\n\"Why did you leave us, then, so long?\" said Mrs. Burton, trying\nto smile, though the signs of tears were, as she well knew, plain\nenough.\n\n\"I thought you would have sent for me.\"\n\n\"Burton,\" said Harry, \"I take it kindly of you that you allowed me to\nsee your wife alone.\"\n\n\"Women always understand these things best,\" said he.\n\n\"And you will come again to-morrow, Harry, and answer me my\nquestion?\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Florence will be here on Monday.\"\n\n\"And why should he not come when Florence is here?\" asked Theodore,\nin an angry tone.\n\n\"Of course he will come, but I want to see him again first. Do I not,\nHarry?\"\n\n\"I hate mysteries,\" said Burton.\n\n\"There shall be no mystery,\" said his wife. \"Why did you send him to\nme, but that there are some things difficult to discuss among three?\nWill you come to-morrow, Harry?\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow; but I will write to-morrow,--early to-morrow. I will\ngo now, and of course you will tell Burton everything that I have\nsaid. Good night.\" They both took his hand, and Cecilia pressed it\nas she looked with beseeching eyes into his face. What would she not\nhave done to secure the happiness of the sister whom she loved? On\nthis occasion she had descended low that she might do much.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nHOW DAMON PARTED FROM PYTHIAS.\n\n\nLady Ongar, when she left Count Pateroff at the little fort on the\ncliff and entered by herself the gardens belonging to the hotel, had\nlong since made up her mind that there should at last be a positive\nseverance between herself and her devoted Sophie. For half-an-hour\nshe had been walking in silence by the count's side; and though, of\ncourse, she had heard all that he had spoken, she had been able in\nthat time to consider much. It must have been through Sophie that the\ncount had heard of her journey to the Isle of Wight; and, worse than\nthat, Sophie must, as she thought, have instigated this pursuit. In\nthat she wronged her poor friend. Sophie had been simply paid by her\nbrother for giving such information as enabled him to arrange this\nmeeting. She had not even counselled him to follow Lady Ongar. But\nnow Lady Ongar, in blind wrath, determined that Sophie should be\nexpelled from her bosom. Lady Ongar would find this task of expulsion\nthe less difficult in that she had come to loathe her devoted\nfriend, and to feel it to be incumbent on her to rid herself of such\ndevotion. Now had arrived the moment in which it might be done.\n\nAnd yet there were difficulties. Two ladies living together in an inn\ncannot, without much that is disagreeable, send down to the landlord\nsaying that they want separate rooms, because they have taken it\ninto their minds to hate each other. And there would, moreover, be\nsomething awkward in saying to Sophie that, though she was discarded,\nher bill should be paid--for this last and only time. No; Lady Ongar\nhad already perceived that that would not do. She would not quarrel\nwith Sophie after that fashion. She would leave the Isle of Wight on\nthe following morning early, informing Sophie why she did so, and\nwould offer money to the little Franco-Pole, presuming that it might\nnot be agreeable to the Franco-Pole to be hurried away from her\nmarine or rural happiness so quickly. But in doing this she would be\ncareful to make Sophie understand that Bolton Street was to be closed\nagainst her for ever afterwards. With neither Count Pateroff nor his\nsister would she ever again willingly place herself in contact.\n\nIt was dark as she entered the house,--the walk out, her delay there,\nand her return having together occupied her three hours. She had\nhardly felt the dusk growing on her as she progressed steadily on her\nway, with that odious man beside her. She had been thinking of other\nthings, and her eyes had accustomed themselves gradually to the\nfading twilight. But now, when she saw the glimmer of the lamps from\nthe inn-windows, she knew that the night had come upon her, and she\nbegan to fear that she had been imprudent in allowing herself to be\nout so late,--imprudent, even had she succeeded in being alone. She\nwent direct to her own room, that, woman-like, she might consult her\nown face as to the effects of the insult she had received, and then\nhaving, as it were, steadied herself, and prepared herself for the\nscene that was to follow, she descended to the sitting-room and\nencountered her friend. The friend was the first to speak; and the\nreader will kindly remember that the friend had ample reason for\nknowing what companion Lady Ongar had been likely to meet upon the\ndowns.\n\n\"Julie, dear, how late you are,\" said Sophie, as though she were\nrather irritated in having been kept so long waiting for her tea.\n\n\"I am late,\" said Lady Ongar.\n\n\"And don't you think you are imprudent,--all alone, you know, dear;\njust a leetle imprudent.\"\n\n\"Very imprudent, indeed. I have been thinking of that now as I\ncrossed the lawn, and found how dark it was. I have been very\nimprudent; but I have escaped without much injury.\"\n\n\"Escaped! escaped what? Have you escaped a cold, or a drunken man?\"\n\n\"Both, as I think.\" Then she sat down, and, having rung the bell, she\nordered tea.\n\n\"There seems to be something very odd with you,\" said Sophie. \"I do\nnot quite understand you.\"\n\n\"When did you see your brother last?\" Lady Ongar asked.\n\n\"My brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, Count Pateroff. When did you see him last?\"\n\n\"Why do you want to know?\"\n\n\"Well, it does not signify, as of course you will not tell me. But\nwill you say when you will see him next?\"\n\n\"How can I tell?\"\n\n\"Will it be to-night?\"\n\n\"Julie, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Only this, that I wish you would make him understand that if he has\nanything to do concerning me, he might as well do it out of hand. For\nthe last hour--\"\n\n\"Then you have seen him?\"\n\n\"Yes; is not that wonderful? I have seen him.\"\n\n\"And why could you not tell him yourself what you had to say? He\nand I do not agree about certain things, and I do not like to carry\nmessages to him. And you have seen him here on this sacr\u00c3\u00a9 sea-coast?\"\n\n\"Exactly so; on this sacr\u00c3\u00a9 sea-coast. Is it not odd that he should\nhave known that I was here,--known the very inn we were at,--and\nknown, too, whither I was going to-night?\"\n\n\"He would learn that from the servants, my dear.\"\n\n\"No doubt. He has been good enough to amuse me with mysterious\nthreats as to what he would do to punish me if I would not--\"\n\n\"Become his wife?\" suggested Sophie.\n\n\"Exactly. It was very flattering on his part. I certainly do not\nintend to become his wife.\"\n\n\"Ah, you like better that young Clavering who has the other\nsweetheart. He is younger. That is true.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, yes. I like my cousin, Harry Clavering, much better\nthan I like your brother; but, as I take it, that has not much to\ndo with it. I was speaking of your brother's threats. I do not\nunderstand them; but I wish he could be made to understand that if he\nhas anything to do, he had better go and do it. As for marriage, I\nwould sooner marry the first ploughboy I could find in the fields.\"\n\n\"Julie,--you need not insult him.\"\n\n\"I will have no more of your Julie; and I will have no more of you.\"\nAs she said this she rose from her chair, and walked about the room.\n\"You have betrayed me, and there shall be an end of it.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: How Damon parted from Pythias.]\n\n\n\"Betrayed you! what nonsense you talk. In what have I betrayed you?\"\n\n\"You set him upon my track here, though you knew I desired to avoid\nhim.\"\n\n\"And is that all? I was coming here to this detestable island, and I\ntold my brother. That is my offence,--and then you talk of betraying!\nJulie, you sometimes are a goose.\"\n\n\"Very often, no doubt; but, Madame Gordeloup, if you please we will\nbe geese apart for the future.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly;--if you wish it.\"\n\n\"I do wish it.\"\n\n\"It cannot hurt me. I can choose my friends anywhere. The world is\nopen to me to go where I please into society. I am not at a loss.\"\n\nAll this Lady Ongar well understood, but she could bear it without\ninjury to her temper. Such revenge was to be expected from such a\nwoman. \"I do not want you to be at a loss,\" she said. \"I only want\nyou to understand that after what has this evening occurred between\nyour brother and me, our acquaintance had better cease.\"\n\n\"And I am to be punished for my brother?\"\n\n\"You said just now that it would be no punishment, and I was glad\nto hear it. Society is, as you say, open to you, and you will lose\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Of course society is open to me. Have I committed myself? I am not\ntalked about for my lovers by all the town. Why should I be at a\nloss? No.\"\n\n\"I shall return to London to-morrow by the earliest opportunity.\nI have already told them so, and have ordered a carriage to go to\nYarmouth at eight.\"\n\n\"And you leave me here, alone!\"\n\n\"Your brother is here, Madame Gordeloup.\"\n\n\"My brother is nothing to me. You know well that. He can come and he\ncan go when he please. I come here to follow you,--to be companion\nto you, to oblige you,--and now you say you go and leave me in this\ndetestable barrack. If I am here alone, I will be revenged.\"\n\n\"You shall go back with me if you wish it.\"\n\n\"At eight o'clock in the morning,--and see, it is now eleven; while\nyou have been wandering about alone with my brother in the dark! No;\nI will not go so early morning as that. To-morrow is Saturday--you\nwas to remain till Tuesday.\"\n\n\"You may do as you please. I shall go at eight to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Very well. You go at eight, very well. And who will pay for the\n'beels' when you are gone, Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"I have already ordered the bill up to-morrow morning. If you will\nallow me to offer you twenty pounds, that will bring you to London\nwhen you please to follow.\"\n\n\"Twenty pounds! What is twenty pounds? No; I will not have your\ntwenty pounds.\" And she pushed away from her the two notes which Lady\nOngar had already put upon the table. \"Who is to pay me for the loss\nof all my time? Tell me that. I have devoted myself to you. Who will\npay me for that?\"\n\n\"Not I, certainly, Madame Gordeloup.\"\n\n\"Not you! You will not pay me for my time;--for a whole year I have\nbeen devoted to you! You will not pay me, and you send me away in\nthis way? By Gar, you will be made to pay,--through the nose.\"\n\nAs the interview was becoming unpleasant, Lady Ongar took her candle\nand went away to bed, leaving the twenty pounds on the table. As she\nleft the room she knew that the money was there, but she could not\nbring herself to pick it up and restore it to her pocket. It was\nimprobable, she thought, that Madame Gordeloup would leave it to the\nmercy of the waiters; and the chances were that the notes would go\ninto the pocket for which they were intended.\n\nAnd such was the result. Sophie, when she was left alone, got up\nfrom her seat, and stood for some moments on the rug, making her\ncalculations. That Lady Ongar should be very angry about Count\nPateroff's presence Sophie had expected; but she had not expected\nthat her friend's anger would be carried to such extremity that she\nwould pronounce a sentence of banishment for life. But, perhaps,\nafter all, it might be well for Sophie herself that such sentence\nshould be carried out. This fool of a woman with her income, her\npark, and her rank, was going to give herself,--so said Sophie to\nherself,--to a young, handsome, proud pig of a fellow,--so Sophie\ncalled him,--who had already shown himself to be Sophie's enemy, and\nwho would certainly find no place for Sophie Gordeloup within his\nhouse. Might it not be well that the quarrel should be consummated\nnow,--such compensation being obtained as might possibly be\nextracted. Sophie certainly knew a good deal, which it might be for\nthe convenience of the future husband to keep dark--or convenient for\nthe future wife that the future husband should not know. Terms might\nbe yet had, although Lady Ongar had refused to pay anything beyond\nthat trumpery twenty pounds. Terms might be had; or, indeed, it might\nbe that Lady Ongar herself, when her anger was over, might sue for a\nreconciliation. Or Sophie,--and this idea occurred as Sophie herself\nbecame a little despondent after long calculation,--Sophie herself\nmight acknowledge herself to be wrong, begging pardon, and weeping\non her friend's neck. Perhaps it might be worth while to make some\nfurther calculation in bed. Then Sophie, softly drawing the notes\ntowards her as a cat might have done, and hiding them somewhere about\nher person, also went to her room.\n\nIn the morning Lady Ongar prepared herself for starting at eight\no'clock, and, as a part of that preparation, had her breakfast\nbrought to her upstairs. When the time was up, she descended to the\nsitting-room on the way to the carriage, and there she found Sophie\nalso prepared for a journey.\n\n\"I am going too. You will let me go?\" said Sophie.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lady Ongar. \"I proposed to you to do so yesterday.\"\n\n\"You should not be so hard upon your poor friend,\" said Sophie. This\nwas said in the hearing of Lady Ongar's maid and of two waiters,\nand Lady Ongar made no reply to it. When they were in the carriage\ntogether, the maid being then stowed away in a dickey or rumble\nbehind, Sophie again whined and was repentant. \"Julie, you should not\nbe so hard upon your poor Sophie.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that the hardest things said were spoken by you.\"\n\n\"Then I will beg your pardon. I am impulsive. I do not restrain\nmyself. When I am angry I say I know not what. If I said\nany words that were wrong, I will apologize, and beg to be\nforgiven,--there,--on my knees.\" And, as she spoke, the adroit little\nwoman contrived to get herself down upon her knees on the floor of\nthe carriage. \"There; say that I am forgiven; say that Sophie is\npardoned.\" The little woman had calculated that even should her\nJulie pardon her, Julie would hardly condescend to ask for the two\nten-pound notes.\n\nBut Lady Ongar had stoutly determined that there should be no further\nintimacy, and had reflected that a better occasion for a quarrel\ncould hardly be vouchsafed to her than that afforded by Sophie's\ntreachery in bringing her brother down to Freshwater. She was too\nstrong, and too much mistress of her will, to be cheated now out of\nher advantage. \"Madame Gordeloup, that attitude is absurd;--I beg you\nwill get up.\"\n\n\"Never; never till you have pardoned me.\" And Sophie crouched still\nlower, till she was all among the dressing-cases and little bags\nat the bottom of the carriage. \"I will not get up till you say the\nwords, 'Sophie, dear, I forgive you.'\"\n\n\"Then I fear you will have an uncomfortable drive. Luckily it will be\nvery short. It is only half-an-hour to Yarmouth.\"\n\n\"And I will kneel again on board the packet; and on the--what you\ncall, platform,--and in the railway carriage,--and in the street.\nI will kneel to my Julie everywhere, till she say, 'Sophie, dear,\nI forgive you!'\"\n\n\"Madame Gordeloup, pray understand me; between you and me there shall\nbe no further intimacy.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Certainly not. No further explanation is necessary, but our intimacy\nhas certainly come to an end.\"\n\n\"It has.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Julie!\"\n\n\"That is such nonsense. Madame Gordeloup, you are disgracing yourself\nby your proceedings.\"\n\n\"Oh! disgracing myself, am I?\" In saying this, Sophie picked herself\nup from among the dressing-cases, and recovered her seat. \"I am\ndisgracing myself! Well, I know very well whose disgrace is the most\ntalked about in the world, yours or mine. Disgracing myself;--and\nfrom you? What did your husband say of you himself?\"\n\nLady Ongar began to feel that even a very short journey might be too\nlong. Sophie was now quite up, and was wriggling herself on her seat,\nadjusting her clothes which her late attitude had disarranged, not in\nthe most graceful manner.\n\n\"You shall see,\" she continued. \"Yes, you shall see. Tell me of\ndisgrace! I have only disgraced myself by being with you. Ah,--very\nwell. Yes; I will get out. As for being quiet, I shall be quiet\nwhenever I like it. I know when to talk and when to hold my tongue.\nDisgrace!\" So saying, she stepped out of the carriage, leaning on the\narm of a boatman who had come to the door, and who had heard her last\nwords.\n\nIt may be imagined that all this did not contribute much to the\ncomfort of Lady Ongar. They were now on the little pier at Yarmouth,\nand in five minutes every one there knew who she was, and knew also\nthat there had been some disagreement between her and the little\nforeigner. The eyes of the boatmen, and of the drivers, and of the\nother travellers, and of the natives going over to the market at\nLymington, were all on her, and the eyes also of all the idlers of\nYarmouth who had congregated there to watch the despatch of the early\nboat. But she bore it well, seating herself, with her maid beside\nher, on one of the benches on the deck, and waiting there with\npatience till the boat should start. Sophie once or twice muttered\nthe word \"disgrace!\" but beyond that she remained silent.\n\nThey crossed over the little channel without a word, and without a\nword made their way up to the railway-station. Lady Ongar had been\ntoo confused to get tickets for their journey at Yarmouth, but had\npaid on board the boat for the passage of the three persons--herself,\nher maid, and Sophie. But, at the station at Lymington, the more\nimportant business of taking tickets for the journey to London became\nnecessary. Lady Ongar had thought of this on her journey across the\nwater, and, when at the railway-station, gave her purse to her maid,\nwhispering her orders. The girl took three first-class tickets, and\nthen going gently up to Madame Gordeloup, offered one to that lady.\n\"Ah, yes; very well; I understand,\" said Sophie, taking the ticket.\n\"I shall take this;\" and she held the ticket up in her hand, as\nthough she had some specially mysterious purpose in accepting it.\n\nShe got into the same carriage with Lady Ongar and her maid, but\nspoke no word on her journey up to London. At Basingstoke she had a\nglass of sherry, for which Lady Ongar's maid paid. Lady Ongar had\ntelegraphed for her carriage, which was waiting for her, but Sophie\nbetook herself to a cab. \"Shall I pay the cabman, ma'am?\" said the\nmaid. \"Yes,\" said Sophie, \"or stop. It will be half-a-crown. You had\nbetter give me the half-crown.\" The maid did so, and in this way the\ncareful Sophie added another shilling to her store,--over and above\nthe twenty pounds,--knowing well that the fare to Mount Street was\neighteen-pence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nDOODLES IN MOUNT STREET.\n\n\nCaptain Clavering and Captain Boodle had, as may be imagined,\ndiscussed at great length and with much frequency the results of the\nformer captain's negotiations with the Russian spy, and it had been\ndeclared strongly by the latter captain, and ultimately admitted by\nthe former, that those results were not satisfactory. Seventy pounds\nhad been expended, and, so to say, nothing had been accomplished.\nIt was in vain that Archie, unwilling to have it thought that he\nhad been worsted in diplomacy, argued that with these political\npersonages, and especially with Russian political personages, the\nambages were everything,--that the preliminaries were in fact the\nwhole, and that when they were arranged, the thing was done. Doodles\nproved to demonstration that the thing was not done, and that seventy\npounds was too much for mere preliminaries. \"My dear fellow,\" he\nsaid, speaking I fear with some scorn in his voice, \"where are you?\nThat's what I want to know. Where are you? Just nowhere.\" This was\ntrue. All that Archie had received from Madame Gordeloup in return\nfor his last payment, was an intimation that no immediate day could\nbe at present named for a renewal of his personal attack upon the\ncountess; but that a day might be named when he should next come to\nMount Street,--provision, of course, being made that he should come\nwith a due qualification under his glove. Now the original basis\non which Archie was to carry on his suit had been arranged to be\nthis,--that Lady Ongar should be made to know that he was there; and\nthe way in which Doodles had illustrated this precept by the artistic\nand allegorical use of his heel was still fresh in Archie's memory.\nThe meeting in which they had come to that satisfactory understanding\nhad taken place early in the spring, and now June was coming on, and\nthe countess certainly did not as yet know that her suitor was there!\nIf anything was to be done by the Russian spy it should be done\nquickly, and Doodles did not refrain from expressing his opinion that\nhis friend was \"putting his foot into it,\" and \"making a mull of the\nwhole thing.\" Now Archie Clavering was a man not eaten up by the vice\nof self-confidence, but prone rather to lean upon his friends and\nanxious for the aid of counsel in difficulty.\n\n\"What the devil is a fellow to do?\" he asked. \"Perhaps I had better\ngive it all up. Everybody says that she is as proud as Lucifer; and,\nafter all, nobody knows what rigs she has been up to.\"\n\nBut this was by no means the view which Doodles was inclined to take.\nHe was a man who in the field never gave up a race because he was\nthrown out at the start, having perceived that patience would achieve\nas much, perhaps, as impetuosity. He had ridden many a waiting\nrace, and had won some of them. He was never so sure of his hand at\nbilliards as when the score was strong against him. \"Always fight\nwhilst there's any fight left in you,\" was a maxim with him. He never\nsurrendered a bet as lost, till the evidence as to the facts was\nquite conclusive, and had taught himself to regard any chance, be it\never so remote, as a kind of property.\n\n\"Never say die,\" was his answer to Archie's remark. \"You see, Clavvy,\nyou have still a few good cards, and you can never know what a woman\nreally means till you have popped yourself. As to what she did when\nshe was away, and all that, you see when a woman has got seven\nthousand a year in her own right, it covers a multitude of sins.\"\n\n\"Of course, I know that.\"\n\n\"And why should a fellow be uncharitable? If a man is to believe all\nthat he hears, by George, they're all much of a muchness. For my part\nI never believe anything. I always suppose every horse will run to\nwin; and though there may be a cross now and again, that's the surest\nline to go upon. D'you understand me now?\" Archie said that of course\nhe understood him; but I fancy that Doodles had gone a little too\ndeep for Archie's intellect.\n\n\"I should say, drop this woman, and go at the widow yourself at\nonce.\"\n\n\"And lose all my seventy pounds for nothing!\"\n\n\"You're not soft enough to suppose that you'll ever get it back\nagain, I hope?\" Archie assured his friend that he was not soft enough\nfor any such hope as that, and then the two remained silent for a\nwhile, deeply considering the posture of the affair. \"I'll tell you\nwhat I'll do for you,\" said Doodles; \"and upon my word I think it\nwill be the best thing.\"\n\n\"And what's that?\"\n\n\"I'll go to this woman myself.\"\n\n\"What; to Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"No; but to the Spy, as you call her. Principals are never the best\nfor this kind of work. When a man has to pay the money himself he can\nnever make so good a bargain as another can make for him. That stands\nto reason. And I can be blunter with her about it than you can;--can\ngo straight at it, you know; and you may be sure of this, she won't\nget any money from me, unless I get the marbles for it.\"\n\n\"You'll take some with you, then?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; that is, if it's convenient. We were talking of going two\nor three hundred pounds, you know, and you've only gone seventy as\nyet. Suppose you hand me over the odd thirty. If she gets it out of\nme easy, tell me my name isn't Boodle.\"\n\nThere was much in this that was distasteful to Captain Clavering,\nbut at last he submitted, and handed over the thirty pounds to his\nfriend. Then there was considerable doubt whether the ambassador\nshould announce himself by a note, but it was decided at last that\nhis arrival should not be expected. If he did not find the lady at\nhome or disengaged on the first visit, or on the second, he might on\nthe third or the fourth. He was a persistent, patient little man,\nand assured his friend that he would certainly see Madame Gordeloup\nbefore a week had passed over their heads.\n\nOn the occasion of his first visit to Mount Street, Sophie Gordeloup\nwas enjoying her retreat in the Isle of Wight. When he called the\nsecond time she was in bed, the fatigue of her journey on the\nprevious day,--the day on which she had actually risen at seven\no'clock in the morning,--having oppressed her much. She had returned\nin the cab alone, and had occupied herself much on the same evening.\nNow that she was to be parted from her Julie, it was needful that she\nshould be occupied. She wrote a long letter to her brother,--much\nmore confidential than her letters to him had lately been,--telling\nhim how much she had suffered on his behalf, and describing to\nhim with great energy the perverseness, malignity, and general\npigheadedness of her late friend. Then she wrote an anonymous letter\nto Mrs. Burton, whose name and address she had learned, after having\nascertained from Archie the fact of Harry Clavering's engagement. In\nthis letter she described the wretched wiles by which that horrid\nwoman Lady Ongar was struggling to keep Harry and Miss Burton apart.\n\"It is very bad, but it is true,\" said the diligent little woman.\n\"She has been seen in his embrace; I know it.\" After that she dressed\nand went out into society,--the society of which she had boasted as\nbeing open to her,--to the house of some hanger-on of some embassy,\nand listened, and whispered, and laughed when some old sinner joked\nwith her, and talked poetry to a young man who was foolish and lame,\nbut who had some money, and got a glass of wine and a cake for\nnothing, and so was very busy; and on her return home calculated that\nher cab-hire for the evening had been judiciously spent. But her\ndiligence had been so great that when Captain Boodle called the next\nmorning at twelve o'clock she was still in bed. Had she been in dear\nParis, or in dearer Vienna, that would have not hindered her from\nreceiving the visit; but in pigheaded London this could not be done;\nand, therefore, when she had duly scrutinized Captain Boodle's card,\nand had learned from the servant that Captain Boodle desired to see\nherself on very particular business, she made an appointment with him\nfor the following day.\n\nOn the following day at the same hour Doodles came and was shown up\ninto her room. He had scrupulously avoided any smartness of apparel,\ncalculating that a Newmarket costume would be, of all dresses, the\nmost efficacious in filling her with an idea of his smartness;\nwhereas Archie had probably injured himself much by his polished\nleather boots, and general newness of clothing. Doodles, therefore,\nwore a cut-away coat, a coloured shirt with a fogle round his neck,\nold brown trowsers that fitted very tightly round his legs, and was\ncareful to take no gloves with him. He was a man with a small bullet\nhead, who wore his hair cut very short, and had no other beard than\na slight appendage on his lower chin. He certainly did possess a\nconsiderable look of smartness, and when he would knit his brows and\nnod his head, some men were apt to think that it was not easy to get\non the soft side of him.\n\nSophie on this occasion was not arrayed with that becoming negligence\nwhich had graced her appearance when Captain Clavering had called.\nShe knew that a visitor was coming, and the questionably white\nwrapper had been exchanged for an ordinary dress. This was regretted,\nrather than otherwise, by Captain Boodle, who had received from\nArchie a description of the lady's appearance, and who had been\nanxious to see the Spy in her proper and peculiar habiliments. It\nmust be remembered that Sophie knew nothing of her present visitor,\nand was altogether unaware that he was in any way connected with\nCaptain Clavering.\n\n\"You are Captain Boddle,\" she said, looking hard at Doodles, as he\nbowed to her on entering the room.\n\n\"Captain Boodle, ma'am; at your service.\"\n\n\"Oh, Captain Bood-dle; it is English name, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly, ma'am, certainly. Altogether English, I believe.\nOur Boodles come out of Warwickshire; small property near\nLeamington,--doosed small, I'm sorry to say.\"\n\nShe looked at him very hard, and was altogether unable to discover\nwhat was the nature or probable mode of life of the young man before\nher. She had lived much in England, and had known Englishmen of\nmany classes, but she could not remember that she had ever become\nconversant with such a one as he who was now before her. Was he a\ngentleman, or might he be a housebreaker? \"A doosed small property\nnear Leamington,\" she said, repeating the words after him. \"Oh!\"\n\n\"But my visit to you, ma'am, has nothing to do with that.\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with the small property.\"\n\n\"Nothing in life.\"\n\n\"Then, Captain Bood-dle, what may it have to do with?\"\n\nHereupon Doodles took a chair, not having been invited to go through\nthat ceremony. According to the theory created in her mind at the\ninstant, this man was not at all like an English captain. Captain\nis an unfortunate title, somewhat equivalent to the foreign\ncount,--unfortunate in this respect, that it is easily adopted by\nmany whose claims to it are very slight. Archie Clavering, with his\npolished leather boots, had looked like a captain,--had come up to\nher idea of a captain,--but this man! The more she regarded him, the\nstronger in her mind became the idea of the housebreaker.\n\n\"My business, ma'am, is of a very delicate nature,--of a nature very\ndelicate indeed. But I think that you and I, who understand the\nworld, may soon come to understand each other.\"\n\n\"Oh, you understand the world. Very well, sir. Go on.\"\n\n\"Now, ma'am, money is money, you know.\"\n\n\"And a goose is a goose; but what of that?\"\n\n\"Yes; a goose is a goose, and some people are not geese. Nobody,\nma'am, would think of calling you a goose.\"\n\n\"I hope not. It would be so uncivil, even an Englishman would not say\nit. Will you go on?\"\n\n\"I think you have the pleasure of knowing Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"Knowing who?\" said Sophie, almost shrieking.\n\n\"Lady Ongar.\"\n\nDuring the last day or two Sophie's mind had been concerned very\nmuch with her dear Julie, but had not been concerned at all with\nthe affairs of Captain Clavering, and, therefore, when Lady Ongar's\nname was mentioned, her mind went away altogether to the quarrel, and\ndid not once refer itself to the captain. Could it be that this was\nan attorney, and was it possible that Julie would be mean enough to\nmake claims upon her? Claims might be made for more than those twenty\npounds. \"And you,\" she said, \"do you know Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"I have not that honour myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have not; and do you want to be introduced?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,--not at present; at some future day I shall hope to\nhave the pleasure. But I am right in believing that she and you are\nvery intimate? Now what are you going to do for my friend Archie\nClavering?\"\n\n\"Oh-h-h!\" exclaimed Sophie.\n\n\"Yes. What are you going to do for my friend Archie Clavering?\nSeventy pounds, you know, ma'am, is a smart bit of money!\"\n\n\"A smart bit of money, is it? That is what you think on your leetle\nproperty down in Warwickshire.\"\n\n\"It isn't my property, ma'am, at all. It belongs to my uncle.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is your uncle that has the leetle property. And what had\nyour uncle to do with Lady Ongar? What is your uncle to your friend\nArchie?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, ma'am; nothing on earth.\"\n\n\"Then why do you tell me all this rigmarole about your uncle and his\nleetle property, and Warwickshire? What have I to do with your uncle?\nSir, I do not understand you,--not at all. Nor do I know why I have\nthe honour to see you here, Captain Bood-dle.\"\n\nEven Doodles, redoubtable as he was--even he, with all his smartness,\nfelt that he was overcome, and that this woman was too much for him.\nHe was altogether perplexed, as he could not perceive whether in all\nher tirade about the little property she had really misunderstood\nhim, and had in truth thought that he had been talking about his\nuncle, or whether the whole thing was cunning on her part. The\nreader, perhaps, will have a more correct idea of this lady than\nCaptain Boodle had been able to obtain. She had now risen from her\nsofa, and was standing as though she expected him to go; but he had\nnot as yet opened the budget of his business.\n\n\"I am here, ma'am,\" said he, \"to speak to you about my friend,\nCaptain Clavering.\"\n\n\"Then you can go back to your friend, and tell him I have nothing to\nsay. And, more than that, Captain Booddle\"--the woman intensified\nthe name in a most disgusting manner, with the evident purpose of\nannoying him; of that he had become quite sure--\"more than that, his\nsending you here is an impertinence. Will you tell him that?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, I will not.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are his laquais,\" continued the inexhaustible Sophie,\n\"and are obliged to come when he send you?\"\n\n\"I am no man's laquais, ma'am.\"\n\n\"If so, I do not blame you; or, perhaps, it is your way to make your\nlove third or fourth hand down in Warwickshire?\"\n\n\"Damn Warwickshire!\" said Doodles, who was put beyond himself.\n\n\"With all my heart. Damn Warwickshire.\" And the horrid woman grinned\nat him as she repeated his words. \"And the leetle property, and\nthe uncle, if you wish it; and the leetle nephew,--and the leetle\nnephew,--and the leetle nephew!\" She stood over him as she repeated\nthe last words with wondrous rapidity, and grinned at him, and\ngrimaced and shook herself, till Doodles was altogether bewildered.\nIf this was a Russian spy he would avoid such in future, and keep\nhimself for the milder acerbities of Newmarket, and the easier\nchaff of his club. He looked up into her face at the present moment,\nstriving to think of some words by which he might assist himself. He\nhad as yet performed no part of his mission, but any such performance\nwas now entirely out of the question. The woman had defied him, and\nhad altogether thrown Clavering overboard. There was no further\nquestion of her services, and therefore he felt himself to be quite\nentitled to twit her with the payment she had taken.\n\n\"And how about my friend's seventy pounds?\" said he.\n\n\"How about seventy pounds! a leetle man comes here and tells me he\nis a Booddle in Warwickshire, and says he has an uncle with a very\nleetle property, and asks me how about seventy pounds! Suppose I ask\nyou how about the policeman, what will you say then?\"\n\n\"You send for him and you shall hear what I say.\"\n\n\"No; not to take away such a leetle man as you. I send for a\npoliceman when I am afraid. Booddle in Warwickshire is not a terrible\nman. Suppose you go to your friend and tell him from me that he have\nchose a very bad Mercury in his affairs of love;--the worst Mercury\nI ever see. Perhaps the Warwickshire Mercuries are not very good. Can\nyou tell me, Captain Booddle, how they make love down in\nWarwickshire?\"\n\n\"And that is all the satisfaction I am to have?\"\n\n\"Who said you was to have satisfaction? Very little satisfaction I\nshould think you ever have, when you come as a Mercury.\"\n\n\"My friend means to know something about that seventy pounds.\"\n\n\"Seventy pounds! If you talk to me any more of seventy pounds, I will\nfly at your face.\" As she spoke this she jumped across at him as\nthough she were really on the point of attacking him with her nails,\nand he, in dismay, retreated to the door. \"You, and your seventy\npounds! Oh, you English! What mean mens you are! Oh! a Frenchman\nwould despise to do it. Yes; or a Russian or a Pole. But you,--you\nwant it all down in black and white, like a butcher's beel. You know\nnothing, and understand nothing, and can never speak, and can never\nhold your tongues. You have no head, but the head of a bull. A bull\ncan break all the china in a shop,--dash, smash, crash,--all the\npretty things gone in a minute! So can an Englishman. Your seventy\npounds! You will come again to me for seventy pounds, I think.\" In\nher energy she had acted the bull, and had exhibited her idea of the\ndashing, the smashing and the crashing, by the motion of her head and\nthe waving of her hands.\n\n\"And you decline to say anything about the seventy pounds?\" said\nDoodles, resolving that his courage should not desert him.\n\nWhereupon the divine Sophie laughed. \"Ha, ha, ha! I see you have not\ngot on any gloves, Captain Booddle.\"\n\n\"Gloves; no. I don't wear gloves.\"\n\n\"Nor your uncle with the leetle property in Warwickshire? Captain\nClavering, he wears a glove. He is a handy man.\" Doodles stared at\nher, understanding nothing of this. \"Perhaps it is in your waistcoat\npocket,\" and she approached him fearlessly, as though she were about\nto deprive him of his watch.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said he, retreating.\n\n\"Ah, you are not a handy man, like my friend the other captain, so\nyou had better go away. Yes; you had better go to Warwickshire. In\nWarwickshire, I suppose, they make ready for your Michaelmas dinners.\nYou have four months to get fat. Suppose you go away and get fat.\"\n\nDoodles understood nothing of her sarcasm, but began to perceive\nthat he might as well take his departure. The woman was probably a\nlunatic, and his friend Archie had no doubt been grossly deceived\nwhen he was sent to her for assistance. He had some faint idea that\nthe seventy pounds might be recovered from such a madwoman; but in\nthe recovery his friend would be exposed, and he saw that the money\nmust be abandoned. At any rate, he had not been soft enough to\ndispose of any more treasure.\n\n\"Good-morning, ma'am,\" he said, very curtly.\n\n\"Good-morning to you, Captain Booddle. Are you coming again another\nday?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You are very welcome to stay away. I like your friend the better.\nTell him to come and be handy with his glove. As for you,--suppose\nyou go to the leetle property.\"\n\nThen Captain Boodle went, and, as soon as he had made his way out\ninto the open street, stood still and looked around him, that by the\naspect of things familiar to his eyes he might be made certain that\nhe was in a world with which he was conversant. While in that room\nwith the Spy he had ceased to remember that he was in London,--his\nown London, within a mile of his club, within a mile of Tattersall's.\nHe had been, as it were, removed to some strange world in which the\ntact, and courage, and acuteness natural to him had not been of avail\nto him. Madame Gordeloup had opened a new world to him,--a new world\nof which he desired to make no further experience. Gradually he\nbegan to understand why he had been desired to prepare himself for\nMichaelmas eating. Gradually some idea about Archie's glove glimmered\nacross his brain. A wonderful woman certainly was the Russian spy,--a\nphenomenon which in future years he might perhaps be glad to remember\nthat he had seen in the flesh. The first race-horse which he might\never own and name himself he would certainly call the Russian spy.\nIn the meantime, as he slowly walked across Berkeley Square, he\nacknowledged to himself that she was not mad, and acknowledged also\nthat the less said about that seventy pounds the better. From thence\nhe crossed Piccadilly, and sauntered down St. James's Street into\nPall Mall, revolving in his mind how he would carry himself with\nClavvy. He, at any rate, had his ground for triumph. He had parted\nwith no money, and had ascertained by his own wit that no available\nassistance from that quarter was to be had in the matter which his\nfriend had in hand.\n\nIt was some hours after this when the two friends met, and at that\ntime Doodles was up to his eyes in chalk and the profitable delights\nof pool. But Archie was too intent on his business to pay much regard\nto his friend's proper avocation. \"Well, Doodles,\" he said, hardly\nwaiting till his ambassador had finished his stroke and laid his ball\nclose waxed to one of the cushions. \"Well; have you seen her?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I've seen her,\" said Doodles, seating himself on an exalted\nbench which ran round the room, while Archie, with anxious eyes,\nstood before him.\n\n\"Well?\" said Archie.\n\n\"She's a rum 'un. Thank 'ee, Griggs; you always stand to me like a\nbrick.\" This was said to a young lieutenant who had failed to hit the\ncaptain's ball, and now tendered him a shilling with a very bitter\nlook.\n\n\"She is queer,\" said Archie,--\"certainly.\"\n\n\"Queer! By George, I'll back her for the queerest bit of horseflesh\ngoing any way about these diggings. I thought she was mad at first,\nbut I believe she knows what she's about.\"\n\n\"She knows what she's about well enough. She's worth all the money if\nyou can only get her to work.\"\n\n\"Bosh, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"Why bosh? What's up now?\"\n\n\"Bosh! Bosh! Bosh! Me to play, is it?\" Down he went, and not finding\na good open for a hazard, again waxed himself to the cushion, to the\ninfinite disgust of Griggs, who did indeed hit the ball this time,\nbut in such a way as to make the loss of another life from Griggs'\noriginal three a matter of certainty. \"I don't think it's hardly\nfair,\" whispered Griggs to a friend, \"a man playing always for\nsafety. It's not the game I like, and I shan't play at the same table\nwith Doodles any more.\"\n\n\"It's all bosh,\" repeated Doodles, coming back to his seat. \"She\ndon't mean to do anything, and never did. I've found her out.\"\n\n\"Found out what?\"\n\n\"She's been laughing at you. She got your money out from under your\nglove, didn't she?\"\n\n\"Well, I did put it there.\"\n\n\"Of course you did. I knew that I should find out what was what if\nI once went there. I got it all out of her. But, by George, what a\nwoman she is! She swore at me to my very face.\"\n\n\"Swore at you! In French you mean?\"\n\n\"No; not in French at all, but damned me in downright English. By\nGeorge, how I did laugh!--me and everybody belonging to me. I'm\nblessed if she didn't.\"\n\n\"There was nothing like that about her when I saw her.\"\n\n\"You didn't turn her inside out as I've done; but stop half a\nmoment.\" Then he descended, chalked away at his cue hastily, pocketed\na shilling or two, and returned. \"You didn't turn her inside out as\nI've done. I tell you, Clavvy, there's nothing to be done there, and\nthere never was. If you'd kept on going yourself she'd have drained\nyou as dry,--as dry as that table. There's your thirty pounds back,\nand, upon my word, old fellow, you ought to thank me.\"\n\nArchie did thank him, and Doodles was not without his triumph. Of\nthe frequent references to Warwickshire which he had been forced\nto endure, he said nothing, nor yet of the reference to Michaelmas\ndinners; and, gradually, as he came to talk frequently to Archie of\nthe Russian spy, and perhaps also to one or two others of his more\nintimate friends, he began to convince himself that he really had\nwormed the truth out of Madame Gordeloup, and got altogether the\nbetter of that lady, in a very wonderful way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nHARRY CLAVERING'S CONFESSION.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nHarry Clavering, when he went away from Onslow Crescent, after his\ninterview with Cecilia Burton, was a wretched, pitiable man. He had\ntold the truth of himself, as far as he was able to tell it, to a\nwoman whom he thoroughly esteemed, and having done so was convinced\nthat she could no longer entertain any respect for him. He had laid\nbare to her all his weakness, and for a moment she had spurned him.\nIt was true that she had again reconciled herself to him, struggling\nto save both him and her sister from future misery,--that she had\neven condescended to implore him to be gracious to Florence, taking\nthat which to her mind seemed then to be the surest path to her\nobject; but not the less did he feel that she must despise him.\nHaving promised his hand to one woman,--to a woman whom he still\nprofessed that he loved dearly,--he had allowed himself to be cheated\ninto offering it to another. And he knew that the cheating had been\nhis own. It was he who had done the evil. Julia, in showing her\naffection for him, had tendered her love to a man whom she believed\nto be free. He had intended to walk straight. He had not allowed\nhimself to be enamoured of the wealth possessed by this woman who\nhad thrown herself at his feet. But he had been so weak that he had\nfallen in his own despite.\n\nThere is, I suppose, no young man possessed of average talents and\naverage education, who does not early in life lay out for himself\nsome career with more or less precision,--some career which is high\nin its tendencies and noble in its aspirations, and to which he is\nafterwards compelled to compare the circumstances of the life which\nhe shapes for himself. In doing this he may not attempt, perhaps, to\nlay down for himself any prescribed amount of success which he will\nendeavour to reach, or even the very pathway by which he will strive\nto be successful; but he will tell himself what are the vices which\nhe will avoid, and what the virtues which he will strive to attain.\nFew young men ever did this with more precision than it had been done\nby Harry Clavering, and few with more self-confidence. Very early\nin life he had been successful,--so successful as to enable him to\nemancipate himself not only from his father's absolute control, but\nalmost also from any interference on his father's part. It had seemed\nto be admitted that he was a better man than his father, better than\nthe other Claverings,--the jewel of the race, the Clavering to whom\nthe family would in future years look up, not as their actual head,\nbut as their strongest prop and most assured support. He had said to\nhimself that he would be an honest, truthful, hard-working man, not\ncovetous after money, though conscious that a labourer was worthy of\nhis hire, and conscious also that the better the work done the better\nshould be his wages. Then he had encountered a blow,--a heavy blow\nfrom a false woman,--and he had boasted to himself that he had borne\nit well, as a man should bear all blows. And now, after all these\nresolves and all these boastings, he found himself brought by his own\nweakness to such a pass that he hardly dared to look in the face any\nof his dearest and most intimate friends.\n\nHe was not remiss in telling himself all this. He did draw the\ncomparison ruthlessly between the character which he had intended\nto make his own and that which he now had justly earned. He did not\nexcuse himself. We are told to love others as ourselves, and it is\nhard to do so. But I think that we never hate others, never despise\nothers, as we are sometimes compelled by our own convictions and\nself-judgment to hate and to despise ourselves. Harry, as he walked\nhome on this evening, was lost in disgust at his own conduct. He\ncould almost have hit his head against the walls, or thrown himself\nbeneath the waggons as he passed them, so thoroughly was he ashamed\nof his own life. Even now, on this evening, he had escaped from\nOnslow Crescent,--basely escaped,--without having declared any\npurpose. Twice on this day he had escaped, almost by subterfuges;\nonce from Burton's office, and now again from Cecilia's presence. How\nlong was this to go on, or how could life be endurable to him under\nsuch circumstances?\n\nIn parting from Cecilia, and promising to write at once, and\npromising to come again in a few days, he had had some idea in his\nhead that he would submit his fate to the arbitrament of Lady Ongar.\nAt any rate he must, he thought, see her, and finally arrange with\nher what the fate of both of them should be, before he could make any\ndefinite statement of his purpose in Onslow Crescent. The last tender\nof his hand had been made to Julia, and he could not renew his former\npromises on Florence's behalf, till he had been absolved by Julia.\n\nThis may at any rate be pleaded on his behalf,--that in all the\nworkings of his mind at this time there was very little of personal\nvanity. Very personally vain he had been when Julia Brabazon,--the\nbeautiful and noble-born Julia,--had first confessed at Clavering\nthat she loved him; but that vanity had been speedily knocked on its\nhead by her conduct to him. Men when they are jilted can hardly be\nvain of the conquest which has led to such a result. Since that there\nhad been no vanity of that sort. His love to Florence had been open,\nhonest, and satisfactory, but he had not considered himself to have\nachieved a wonderful triumph at Stratton. And when he found that\nLord Ongar's widow still loved him,--that he was still regarded with\naffection by the woman who had formerly wounded him,--there was too\nmuch of pain, almost of tragedy, in his position, to admit of vanity.\nHe would say to himself that, as far as he knew his own heart, he\nthought he loved Julia the best; but, nevertheless, he thoroughly\nwished that she had not returned from Italy, or that he had not seen\nher when she had so returned.\n\nHe had promised to write, and that he would do this very night. He\nhad failed to make Cecilia Burton understand what he intended to do,\nhaving, indeed, hardly himself resolved; but before he went to bed\nhe would both resolve and explain to her his resolution. Immediately,\ntherefore, on his return home he sat down at his desk with the pen in\nhis hand and the paper before him.\n\nAt last the words came. I can hardly say that they were the product\nof any fixed resolve made before he commenced the writing. I think\nthat his mind worked more fully when the pen was in his hands than\nit had done during the hour through which he sat listless, doing\nnothing, struggling to have a will of his own, but failing. The\nletter when it was written was as follows:--\n\n\n   Bloomsbury Square, May, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST MRS. BURTON,--I said that I would write to-morrow,\n   but I am writing now, immediately on my return home.\n   Whatever else you may think of me, pray be sure of this,\n   that I am most anxious to make you know and understand my\n   own position at any rate as well as I do myself. I tried\n   to explain it to you when I was with you this evening, but\n   I fear that I failed; and when Mr. Burton came in I could\n   not say anything further.\n\n   I know that I have behaved very badly to your\n   sister,--very badly, even though she should never become\n   aware that I have done so. Not that that is possible, for\n   if she were to be my wife to-morrow I should tell her\n   everything. But badly as you must think of me, I have\n   never for a moment had a premeditated intention to deceive\n   her. I believe you do know on what terms I had stood with\n   Miss Brabazon before her marriage, and that when she\n   married, whatever my feelings might be, there was no\n   self-accusation. And after that you know all that took\n   place between me and Florence till the return of Lord\n   Ongar's widow. Up to that time everything had been fair\n   between us. I had told Florence of my former attachment,\n   and she probably thought but little of it. Such things are\n   so common with men! Some change happens as had happened\n   with me, and a man's second love is often stronger and\n   more worthy of a woman's acceptance than the first. At any\n   rate, she knew it, and there was, so far, an end of it.\n   And you understood, also, how very anxious I was to avoid\n   delay in our marriage. No one knows that better than\n   you,--not even Florence,--for I have talked it over with\n   you so often; and you will remember how I have begged you\n   to assist me. I don't blame my darling Florence. She was\n   doing what she deemed best; but oh, if she had only been\n   guided by what you once said to her!\n\n   Then Lord Ongar's widow returned; and dear Mrs. Burton,\n   though I fear you think ill of her, you must remember that\n   as far as you know, or I, she has done nothing wrong, has\n   been in no respect false, since her marriage. As to her\n   early conduct to me, she did what many women have done,\n   but what no woman should do. But how can I blame her,\n   knowing how terrible has been my own weakness! But as to\n   her conduct since her marriage, I implore you to believe\n   with me that she has been sinned against grievously, and\n   has not sinned. Well; as you know, I met her. It was\n   hardly unnatural that I should do so, as we are connected.\n   But whether natural or unnatural, foolish or wise, I went\n   to her often. I thought at first that she must know of\n   my engagement as her sister knew it well, and had met\n   Florence. But she did not know it; and so, having none\n   near her that she could love, hardly a friend but myself,\n   grievously wronged by the world and her own relatives,\n   thinking that with her wealth she could make some amends\n   to me for her former injury, she--. Dear Mrs. Burton, I\n   think you will understand it now, and will see that she at\n   least is free from blame.\n\n   I am not defending myself; of course all this should have\n   been without effect on me. But I had loved her so dearly!\n   I do love her still so dearly! Love like that does not\n   die. When she left me it was natural that I should seek\n   some one else to love. When she returned to me,--when I\n   found that in spite of her faults she had loved me through\n   it all, I--I yielded and became false and a traitor.\n\n   I say that I love her still; but I know well that Florence\n   is far the nobler woman of the two. Florence never\n   could have done what she did. In nature, in mind, in\n   acquirement, in heart, Florence is the better. The man who\n   marries Florence must be happy if any woman can make a man\n   happy. Of her of whom I am now speaking, I know well that\n   I cannot say that. How then, you will ask, can I be fool\n   enough, having had such a choice, to doubt between the\n   two! How is it that man doubts between vice and virtue,\n   between honour and dishonour, between heaven and hell?\n\n   But all this is nothing to you. I do not know whether\n   Florence would take me now. I am well aware that I have no\n   right to expect that she should. But if I understood you\n   aright this evening, she, as yet, has heard nothing of all\n   this. What must she think of me for not writing to her!\n   But I could not bring myself to write in a false spirit;\n   and how could I tell her all that I have now told to you?\n\n   I know that you wish that our engagement should go on.\n   Dear Mrs. Burton, I love you so dearly for wishing it! Mr.\n   Burton, when he shall have heard everything, will, I fear,\n   think differently. For me, I feel that I must see Lady\n   Ongar before I can again go to your house, and I write now\n   chiefly to tell you that this is what I have determined to\n   do. I believe she is now away, in the Isle of Wight, but\n   I will see her as soon as she returns. After that I will\n   either come to Onslow Crescent or send. Florence will be\n   with you then. She of course must know everything, and you\n   have my permission to show this letter to her if you think\n   well to do so.--Most sincerely and affectionately yours,\n\n   HARRY CLAVERING.\n\n\nThis he delivered himself the next morning at the door in Onslow\nCrescent, taking care not to be there till after Theodore Burton\nshould have gone from home. He left a card also, so that it might\nbe known, not only that he had brought it himself, but that he had\nintended Mrs. Burton to be aware of that fact. Then he went and\nwandered about, and passed his day in misery, as such men do when\nthey are thoroughly discontented with their own conduct. This was\nthe Saturday on which Lady Ongar returned with her Sophie from the\nIsle of Wight; but of that premature return Harry knew nothing, and\ntherefore allowed the Sunday to pass by without going to Bolton\nStreet. On the Monday morning he received a letter from home which\nmade it necessary,--or induced him to suppose it to be necessary,\nthat he should go home to Clavering, at any rate for one day. This he\ndid on the Monday, sending a line to Mrs. Burton to say whither he\nwas gone, and that he should be back by Wednesday night or Thursday\nmorning,--and imploring her to give his love to Florence, if she\nwould venture to do so. Mrs. Burton would know what must be his first\nbusiness in London on his return, and she might be sure he would come\nor send to Onslow Crescent as soon as that was over.\n\nHarry's letter,--the former and longer letter, Cecilia had read over,\ntill she nearly knew it by heart, before her husband's return. She\nwell understood that he would be very hard upon Harry. He had been\ninclined to forgive Clavering for what had been remiss,--to forgive\nthe silence, the absence from the office, and the want of courtesy\nto his wife, till Harry had confessed his sin;--but he could not\nendure that his sister should seek the hand of a man who had declared\nhimself to be in doubt whether he would take it, or that any one\nshould seek it for her, in her ignorance of all the truth. His wife,\non the other hand, simply looked to Florence's comfort and happiness.\nThat Florence should not suffer the pang of having been deceived and\nrejected was all in all to Cecilia. \"Of course she must know it some\nday,\" the wife had pleaded to her husband. \"He is not the man to\nkeep anything secret. But if she is told when he has returned to her,\nand is good to her, the happiness of the return will cure the other\nmisery.\" But Burton would not submit to this. \"To be comfortable at\npresent is not everything,\" he said. \"If the man be so miserably weak\nthat he does not even now know his own mind, Florence had better take\nher punishment, and be quit of him.\"\n\nCecilia had narrated to him with passable fidelity what had occurred\nupstairs, while he was sitting alone in the dining-room. That she,\nin her anger, had at one moment spurned Harry Clavering, and that\nin the next she had knelt to him, imploring him to come back to\nFlorence,--those two little incidents she did not tell to her\nhusband. Harry's adventures with Lady Ongar, as far as she knew them,\nshe described accurately. \"I can't make any apology for him; upon my\nlife I can't,\" said Burton. \"If I know what it is for a man to behave\nill, falsely, like a knave in such matters, he is so behaving.\" So\nTheodore Burton spoke as he took his candle to go away to his work;\nbut his wife had induced him to promise that he would not write to\nStratton or take any other step in the matter till they had waited\ntwenty-four hours for Harry's promised letter.\n\nThe letter came before the twenty-four hours were expired, and\nBurton, on his return home on the Saturday, found himself called upon\nto read and pass judgment upon Harry's confession. \"What right has he\nto speak of her as his darling Florence,\" he exclaimed, \"while he is\nconfessing his own knavery?\"\n\n\"But if she is his darling--?\" pleaded his wife.\n\n\"Trash! But the word from him in such a letter is simply an\nadditional insult. And what does he know about this woman who has\ncome back? He vouches for her, but what can he know of her? Just what\nshe tells him. He is simply a fool.\"\n\n\"But you cannot dislike him for believing her word.\"\n\n\"Cecilia,\" said he, holding down the letter as he spoke,--\"you are so\ncarried away by your love for Florence, and your fear lest a marriage\nwhich has been once talked of should not take place, that you shut\nyour eyes to this man's true character. Can you believe any good of\na man who tells you to your face that he is engaged to two women at\nonce?\"\n\n\"I think I can,\" said Cecilia, hardly venturing to express so\ndangerous an opinion above her breath.\n\n\"And what would you think of a woman who did so?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is so different! I cannot explain it, but you know that it\nis different.\"\n\n\"I know that you would forgive a man anything, and a woman nothing.\"\nTo this she submitted in silence, having probably heard the reproof\nbefore, and he went on to finish the letter. \"Not defending himself!\"\nhe exclaimed,--\"then why does he not defend himself? When a man tells\nme that he does not, or cannot defend himself, I know that he is a\nsorry fellow, without a spark of spirit.\"\n\n\"I don't think that of Harry. Surely that letter shows a spirit.\"\n\n\"Such a one as I should be ashamed to see in a dog. No man should\never be in a position in which he cannot defend himself. No man, at\nany rate, should admit himself to be so placed. Wish that he should\ngo on with his engagement! I do not wish it at all. I am sorry for\nFlorence. She will suffer terribly. But the loss of such a lover as\nthat is infinitely a lesser loss than would be the gain of such a\nhusband. You had better write to Florence, and tell her not to come.\"\n\n\"Oh, Theodore!\"\n\n\"That is my advice.\"\n\n\"But there is no post between this and Monday,\" said Cecilia\ntemporizing.\n\n\"Send her a message by the wires.\"\n\n\"You cannot explain this by a telegram, Theodore. Besides, why should\nshe not come? Her coming can do no harm. If you were to tell your\nmother now of all this, it would prevent the possibility of things\never being right.\"\n\n\"Things,--that is, this thing, never will be right,\" said he.\n\n\"But let us see. She will be here on Monday, and if you think it best\nyou can tell her everything. Indeed, she must be told when she is\nhere, for I could not keep it from her. I could not smile and talk to\nher about him and make her think that it is all right.\"\n\n\"Not you! I should be very sorry if you could.\"\n\n\"But I think I could make her understand that she should not decide\nupon breaking with him altogether.\"\n\n\"And I think I could make her understand that she ought to do so.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't do that, Theodore?\"\n\n\"I would if I thought it my duty.\"\n\n\"But at any rate, she must come, and we can talk of that to-morrow.\"\n\nAs to Florence's coming, Burton had given way, beaten, apparently,\nby that argument about the post. On the Sunday very little was said\nabout Harry Clavering. Cecilia studiously avoided the subject, and\nBurton had not so far decided on dropping Harry altogether, as to\nmake him anxious to express any such decision. After all, such\ndropping or not dropping must be the work of Florence herself. On the\nMonday morning Cecilia had a further triumph. On that day her husband\nwas very fully engaged,--having to meet a synod of contractors,\nsurveyors, and engineers, to discuss which of the remaining\nthoroughfares of London should not be knocked down by the coming\nrailways,--and he could not absent himself from the Adelphi. It was,\ntherefore, arranged that Mrs. Burton should go to the Paddington\nStation to meet her sister-in-law. She therefore would have the first\nword with Florence, and the earliest opportunity of impressing the\nnew-comer with her own ideas. \"Of course, you must say something to\nher of this man,\" said her husband, \"but the less you say the better.\nAfter all she must be left to judge for herself.\" In all matters\nsuch as this,--in all affairs of tact, of social intercourse, and\nof conduct between man and man, or man and woman, Mr. Burton was\napt to be eloquent in his domestic discussion, and sometimes almost\nsevere;--but the final arrangement of them was generally left to his\nwife. He enunciated principles of strategy,--much, no doubt, to her\nbenefit; but she actually fought the battles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nFLORENCE BURTON PACKS UP A PACKET.\n\n\nThough nobody had expressed to Florence at Stratton any fear of Harry\nClavering's perfidy, that young lady was not altogether easy in her\nmind. Weeks and weeks had passed, and she had not heard from him.\nHer mother was manifestly uneasy, and had announced some days before\nFlorence's departure, her surprise and annoyance in not having heard\nfrom her eldest son. When Florence inquired as to the subject of the\nexpected letter, her mother put the question aside, saying, with\na little assumed irritability, that of course she liked to get an\nanswer to her letters when she took the trouble to write them. And\nwhen the day for Florence's journey drew nigh, the old lady became\nmore and more uneasy,--showing plainly that she wished her daughter\nwas not going to London. But Florence, as she was quite determined to\ngo, said nothing to all this. Her father also was uneasy, and neither\nof them had for some days named her lover in her hearing. She knew\nthat there was something wrong, and felt that it was better that she\nshould go to London and learn the truth.\n\nNo female heart was ever less prone to suspicion than the heart of\nFlorence Burton. Among those with whom she had been most intimate\nnothing had occurred to teach her that men could be false, or women\neither. When she had heard from Harry Clavering the story of Julia\nBrabazon, she had, not making much accusation against the sinner in\nspeech, put Julia down in the books of her mind as a bold, bad woman\nwho could forget her sex, and sell her beauty and her womanhood\nfor money. There might be such a woman here and there, or such a\nman. There were murderers in the world,--but the bulk of mankind\nis not made subject to murderers. Florence had never considered\nthe possibility that she herself could become liable to such a\nmisfortune. And then, when the day came that she was engaged, her\nconfidence in the man chosen by her was unlimited. Such love as hers\nrarely suspects. He with whom she had to do was Harry Clavering, and\ntherefore she could not be deceived. Moreover she was supported by\na self-respect and a self-confidence which did not at first allow\nher to dream that a man who had once loved her would ever wish to\nleave her. It was to her as though a sacrament as holy as that of\nthe church had passed between them, and she could not easily bring\nherself to think that that sacrament had been as nothing to Harry\nClavering. But nevertheless there was something wrong, and when she\nleft her father's house at Stratton, she was well aware that she\nmust prepare herself for tidings that might be evil. She could bear\nanything, she thought, without disgracing herself; but there were\ntidings which might send her back to Stratton a broken woman, fit\nperhaps to comfort the declining years of her father and mother, but\nfit for nothing else.\n\nHer mother watched her closely as she sat at her breakfast that\nmorning, but much could not be gained by watching Florence Burton\nwhen Florence wished to conceal her thoughts. Many messages were sent\nto Theodore, to Cecilia, and to the children, messages to others of\nthe Burton clan who were in town, but not a word was said of Harry\nClavering. The very absence of his name was enough to make them\nall wretched, but Florence bore it as the Spartan boy bore the fox\nbeneath his tunic. Mrs. Burton could hardly keep herself from a burst\nof indignation; but she had been strongly warned by her husband, and\nrestrained herself till Florence was gone. \"If he is playing her\nfalse,\" said she, as soon as she was alone with her old husband,\n\"he shall suffer for it, though I have to tear his face with my own\nfingers.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear; nonsense.\"\n\n\"It is not nonsense, Mr. Burton. A gentleman, indeed! He is to be\nallowed to be dishonest to my girl because he is a gentleman! I wish\nthere was no such thing as a gentleman;--so I do. Perhaps there would\nbe more honest men then.\" It was unendurable to her that a girl of\nhers should be so treated.\n\nImmediately on the arrival of the train at the London platform,\nFlorence espied Cecilia, and in a minute was in her arms. There was a\nspecial tenderness in her sister-in-law's caress, which at once told\nFlorence that her fears had not been without cause. Who has not felt\nthe evil tidings conveyed by the exaggerated tenderness of a special\nkiss? But while on the platform and among the porters she said\nnothing of herself. She asked after Theodore and heard of the railway\nconfederacy with a shew of delight. \"He'd like to make a line from\nHyde Park Corner to the Tower of London,\" said Florence, with a\nsmile. Then she asked after the children, and specially for the\nbaby; but as yet she spoke no word of Harry Clavering. The trunk and\nthe bag were at last found; and the two ladies were packed into a\ncab, and had started. Cecilia, when they were seated, got hold of\nFlorence's hand, and pressed it warmly. \"Dearest,\" she said, \"I am\nso glad to have you with us once again.\" \"And now,\" said Florence,\nspeaking with a calmness that was almost unnatural, \"tell me all the\ntruth.\"\n\nAll the truth! What a demand it was. And yet Cecilia had expected\nthat none less would be made upon her. Of course Florence must have\nknown that there was something wrong. Of course she would ask as to\nher lover immediately upon her arrival. \"And now tell me all the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Oh, Florence!\"\n\n\"The truth, then, is very bad?\" said Florence, gently. \"Tell me first\nof all whether you have seen him. Is he ill?\"\n\n\"He was with us on Friday. He is not ill.\"\n\n\"Thank God for that. Has anything happened to him? Has he lost\nmoney?\"\n\n\"No; I have heard nothing about money.\"\n\n\"Then he is tired of me. Tell me at once, my own one. You know me\nso well. You know I can bear it. Don't treat me as though I were a\ncoward.\"\n\n\"No; it is not that. It is not that he is tired of you. If you had\nheard him speak of you on Friday,--that you were the noblest, purest,\ndearest, best of women--\" This was imprudent on her part; but what\nloving woman could at such a moment have endured to be prudent?\n\n\"Then what is it?\" asked Florence, almost sternly. \"Look here,\nCecilia; if it be anything touching himself or his own character, I\nwill put up with it, in spite of anything my brother may say. Though\nhe had been a murderer, if that were possible, I would not leave him.\nI will never leave him unless he leaves me. Where is he now, at this\nmoment?\"\n\n\"He is in town.\" Mrs. Burton had not received Harry's note, telling\nher of his journey to Clavering, before she had left home. Now at\nthis moment it was waiting for her in Onslow Crescent.\n\n\"And am I to see him? Cecilia, why cannot you tell me how it is? In\nsuch a case I should tell you,--should tell you everything at once;\nbecause I know that you are not a coward. Why cannot you do so to\nme?\"\n\n\"You have heard of Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"Heard of her;--yes. She treated Harry very badly before her\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"She has come back to London, a widow.\"\n\n\"I know she has. And Harry has gone back to her! Is that it? Do you\nmean to tell me that Harry and Lady Ongar are to be married?\"\n\n\"No; I cannot say that. I hope it is not so. Indeed, I do not think\nit.\"\n\n\"Then what have I to fear? Does she object to his marrying me? What\nhas she to do between us?\"\n\n\"She wishes that Harry should come back to her, and Harry has been\nunsteady. He has been with her often; and he has been very weak. It\nmay be all right yet, Flo; it may indeed,--if you can forgive his\nweakness.\"\n\nSomething of the truth had now come home to Florence, and she sat\nthinking of it long before she spoke again. This widow, she knew, was\nvery wealthy, and Harry had loved her before he had come to Stratton.\nHarry's first love had come back free,--free to wed again, and\nable to make the fortune of the man she might love and marry. What\nhad Florence to give to any man that could be weighed with this?\nLady Ongar was very rich. Florence had already heard all this from\nHarry,--was very rich, was clever, and was beautiful; and moreover\nshe had been Harry's first love. Was it reasonable that she with her\nlittle claims, her puny attractions, should stand in Harry's way when\nsuch a prize as that came across him! And as for his weakness;--might\nit not be strength, rather than weakness;--the strength of an old\nlove which he could not quell, now that the woman was free to take\nhim? For herself,--had she not known that she had only come second?\nAs she thought of him with his noble bride and that bride's great\nfortune, and of her own insignificance, her low birth, her doubtful\nprettiness,--prettiness that had ever been doubtful to herself, of\nher few advantages, she told herself that she had no right to stand\nupon her claims. \"I wish I had known it sooner,\" she said, in a voice\nso soft that Cecilia strained her ears to catch the words. \"I wish I\nhad known it sooner. I would not have come up to be in his way.\"\n\n\"But you will be in no one's way, Flo, unless it be in hers.\"\n\n\"And I will not be in hers,\" said Florence, speaking somewhat louder,\nand raising her head in pride as she spoke. \"I will be neither in\nhers nor in his. I think I will go back at once.\"\n\nCecilia upon this, ventured to look round at her, and saw that she\nwas very pale, but that her eyes were dry and her lips pressed close\ntogether. It had not occurred to Mrs. Burton that her sister-in-law\nwould take it in this way,--that she would express herself as being\nwilling to give way, and that she would at once surrender her lover\nto her rival. The married woman, she who was already happy with a\nhusband, having enlisted all her sympathies on the side of a marriage\nbetween Florence and Harry Clavering, could by no means bring herself\nto agree to this view. No one liked success better than Cecilia\nBurton, and to her success would consist in rescuing Harry from Lady\nOngar and securing him for Florence. In fighting this battle she had\nfound that she would have against her Lady Ongar--of course, and then\nher husband, and Harry himself too, as she feared; and now also she\nmust reckon Florence also among her opponents. But she could not\nendure the idea of failing in such a cause. \"Oh, Florence, I think\nyou are so wrong,\" she said.\n\n\"You would feel as I do, if you were in my place.\"\n\n\"But people cannot always judge best when they feel the most. What\nyou should think of is his happiness.\"\n\n\"So I do;--and of his future career.\"\n\n\"Career! I hate to hear of careers. Men do not want careers, or\nshould not want them. Could it be good for him to marry a woman who\nhas been false--who has done as she has, simply because she has made\nherself rich by her wickedness? Do you believe so much in riches\nyourself?\"\n\n\"If he loves her best, I will not blame him,\" said Florence. \"He knew\nher before he had seen me. He was quite honest and told me all the\nstory. It is not his fault if he still likes her the best.\"\n\nWhen they reached Onslow Crescent, the first half-hour was spent with\nthe children, as to whom Florence could not but observe that even\nfrom their mouths the name of Harry Clavering was banished. But she\nplayed with Cissy and Sophie, giving them their little presents from\nStratton; and sat with the baby in her lap, kissing his pink feet and\nmaking little soft noises for his behoof, sweetly as she might have\ndone if no terrible crisis in her own life had now come upon her. Not\na tear as yet had moistened her eyes, and Cecilia was partly aware\nthat Florence's weeping would be done in secret. \"Come up with me\ninto my own room;--I have something to show you,\" she said, as the\nnurse took the baby at last; and Cissy and Sophie were at the same\ntime sent away with their brother. \"As I came in I got a note from\nHarry, but, before you see that, I must show you the letter which\nhe wrote to me on Friday. He has gone down to Clavering,--on some\nbusiness,--for one day.\" Mrs. Burton, in her heart, could hardly\nacquit him of having run out of town at the moment to avoid the\narrival of Florence.\n\nThey went upstairs, and the note was, in fact, read before the\nletter. \"I hope there is nothing wrong at the parsonage,\" said\nFlorence.\n\n\"You see he says he will be back after one day.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he has gone to tell them,--of this change in his prospects.\"\n\n\"No, dear, no; you do not yet understand his feelings. Read his\nletter, and you will know more. If there is to be a change, he is at\nany rate too much ashamed of it to speak of it. He does not wish it\nhimself. It is simply this,--that she has thrown herself in his way,\nand he has not known how to avoid her.\"\n\nThen Florence read the letter very slowly, going over most of the\nsentences more than once, and struggling to learn from them what were\nreally the wishes of the writer. When she came to Harry's exculpation\nof Lady Ongar, she believed it thoroughly, and said so,--meeting,\nhowever, a direct contradiction on that point from her sister-in-law.\nWhen she had finished it, she folded it up and gave it back. \"Cissy,\"\nshe said, \"I know that I ought to go back. I do not want to see him,\nand I am glad that he has gone away.\"\n\n\"But you do not mean to give him up?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest.\"\n\n\"But you said you would never leave him, unless he left you.\"\n\n\"He has left me.\"\n\n\"No, Florence; not so. Do you not see what he says;--that he knows\nyou are the only woman that can make him happy?\"\n\n\"He has not said that; but if he had, it would make no matter.\nHe understands well how it is. He says that I could not take him\nnow,--even if he came to me; and I cannot. How could I? What! wish to\nmarry a man who does not love me, who loves another, when I know that\nI am regarded simply as a barrier between them; when by doing so I\nshould mar his fortunes? Cissy, dear, when you think of it, you will\nnot wish it.\"\n\n\"Mar his fortunes! It would make them. I do wish it,--and he wishes\nit too. I tell you that I had him here, and I know it. Why should you\nbe sacrificed?\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of self-denial, if no one can bear to suffer?\"\n\n\"But he will suffer too,--and all for her caprices! You cannot really\nthink that her money would do him any good. Who would ever speak to\nhim again, or even see him? What would the world say of him? Why, his\nown father and mother and sisters would disown him, if they are such\nas you say they are.\"\n\nFlorence would not argue it further, but went to her room, and\nremained there alone till Cecilia came to tell her that her brother\nhad returned. What weeping there may have been there, need not be\ntold. Indeed, as I think, there was not much, for Florence was a\ngirl whose education had not brought her into the way of hysterical\nsensations. The Burtons were an active, energetic people who\nsympathized with each other in labour and success,--and in endurance\nalso; but who had little sympathy to express for the weaknesses of\ngrief. When her children had stumbled in their play, bruising their\nlittle noses, and barking their little shins, Mrs. Burton, the elder,\nhad been wont to bid them rise, asking them what their legs were for,\nif they could not stand. So they had dried their own little eyes with\ntheir own little fists, and had learned to understand that the rubs\nof the world were to be borne in silence. This rub that had come to\nFlorence was of grave import, and had gone deeper than the outward\nskin; but still the old lesson had its effect.\n\nFlorence rose from the bed on which she was lying, and prepared to\ncome down. \"Do not commit yourself to him, as to anything,\" said\nCecilia.\n\n\"I understand what that means,\" Florence answered. \"He thinks as I\ndo. But never mind. He will not say much, and I shall say less. It is\nbad to talk of this to any man,--even to a brother.\"\n\nBurton also received his sister with that exceptional affection which\ndeclares pity for some overwhelming misfortune. He kissed her lips,\nwhich was rare with him, for he would generally but just touch her\nforehead, and he put his hand behind her waist and partly embraced\nher. \"Did Cissy manage to find you at the station?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--easily.\"\n\n\"Theodore thinks that a woman is no good for any such purpose as\nthat,\" said Cecilia. \"It is a wonder to him, no doubt, that we are\nnot now wandering about London in search of each other,--and of him.\"\n\n\"I think she would have got home quicker if I could have been there,\"\nsaid Burton.\n\n\"We were in a cab in one minute;--weren't we, Florence? The\ndifference would have been that you would have given a porter\nsixpence,--and I gave him a shilling, having bespoken him before.\"\n\n\"And Theodore's time was worth the sixpence, I suppose,\" said\nFlorence.\n\n\"That depends,\" said Cecilia. \"How did the synod go on?\"\n\n\"The synod made an ass of itself;--as synods always do. It is\nnecessary to get a lot of men together, for the show of the\nthing,--otherwise the world will not believe. That is the meaning of\ncommittees. But the real work must always be done by one or two men.\nCome;--I'll go and get ready for dinner.\"\n\nThe subject,--the one real subject, had thus been altogether avoided\nat this first meeting with the man of the house, and the evening\npassed without any allusion to it. Much was made of the children,\nand much was said of the old people at home; but still there was\na consciousness over them all that the one matter of importance\nwas being kept in the background. They were all thinking of Harry\nClavering, but no one mentioned his name. They all knew that they\nwere unhappy and heavy-hearted through his fault, but no one blamed\nhim. He had been received in that house with open arms, had been\nwarmed in their bosom, and had stung them; but though they were all\nsmarting from the sting, they uttered no complaint. Burton had made\nup his mind that it would be better to pass over the matter thus in\nsilence,--to say nothing further of Harry Clavering. A misfortune\nhad come upon them. They must bear it, and go on as before. Harry\nhad been admitted into the London office on the footing of a paid\nclerk,--on the same footing, indeed, as Burton himself, though with\na much smaller salary and inferior work. This position had been\naccorded to him of course through the Burton interest, and it was\nunderstood that if he chose to make himself useful, he could rise\nin the business as Theodore had risen. But he could only do so as\none of the Burtons. For the last three months he had declined to\ntake his salary, alleging that private affairs had kept him away\nfrom the office. It was to the hands of Theodore Burton himself that\nsuch matters came for management, and therefore there had been no\nnecessity for further explanation. Harry Clavering would of course\nleave the house, and there would be an end of him in the records of\nthe Burton family. He would have come and made his mark,--a terrible\nmark, and would have passed on. Those whom he had bruised by his\ncruelty, and knocked over by his treachery, must get to their feet\nagain as best they could, and say as little as might be of their\nfall. There are knaves in this world, and no one can suppose that\nhe has a special right to be exempted from their knavery because he\nhimself is honest. It is on the honest that the knaves prey. That\nwas Burton's theory in this matter. He would learn from Cecilia\nhow Florence was bearing herself; but to Florence herself he would\nsay little or nothing if she bore with patience and dignity, as he\nbelieved she would, the calamity which had befallen her.\n\nBut he must write to his mother. The old people at Stratton must not\nbe left in the dark as to what was going on. He must write to his\nmother, unless he could learn from his wife that Florence herself had\ncommunicated to them at home the fact of Harry's iniquity. But he\nasked no question as to this on the first night, and on the following\nmorning he went off, having simply been told that Florence had seen\nHarry's letter, that she knew all, and that she was carrying herself\nlike an angel.\n\n\"Not like an angel that hopes?\" said Theodore.\n\n\"Let her alone for a day or two,\" said Cecilia. \"Of course she must\nhave a few days to think of it. I need hardly tell you that you will\nnever have to be ashamed of your sister.\"\n\nThe Tuesday and the Wednesday passed by, and though Cecilia and\nFlorence when together discussed the matter, no change was made in\nthe wishes or thoughts of either of them. Florence, now that she was\nin town, had consented to remain till after Harry should return, on\nthe understanding that she should not be called upon to see him. He\nwas to be told that she forgave him altogether,--that his troth was\nreturned to him and that he was free, but that in such circumstances\na meeting between them could be of no avail. And then a little packet\nwas made up, which was to be given to him. How was it that Florence\nhad brought with her all his presents and all his letters? But there\nthey were in her box upstairs, and sitting by herself, with weary\nfingers, she packed them, and left them packed under lock and key,\naddressed by herself to Harry Clavering, Esq. Oh, the misery of\npacking such a parcel! The feeling with which a woman does it\nis never encountered by a man. He chucks the things together in\nwrath,--the lock of hair, the letters in the pretty Italian hand\nthat have taken so much happy care in the writing, the jewelled\nshirt-studs, which were first put in by the fingers that gave them.\nThey are thrown together, and given to some other woman to deliver.\nBut the girl lingers over her torture. She reads the letters again.\nShe thinks of the moments of bliss which each little toy has given.\nShe is loth to part with everything. She would fain keep some one\nthing,--the smallest of them all. She doubts,--till a feeling of\nmaidenly reserve constrains her at last, and the coveted trifle, with\ncareful, painstaking fingers, is put with the rest, and the parcel is\nmade complete, and the address is written with precision.\n\n\n[Illustration: Florence Burton makes up a packet.]\n\n\n\"Of course I cannot see him,\" said Florence. \"You will hand to him\nwhat I have to send to him; and you must ask him, if he has kept any\nof my letters, to return them.\" She said nothing of the shirt-studs,\nbut he would understand that. As for the lock of hair,--doubtless it\nhad been burned.\n\nCecilia said but little in answer to this. She would not as yet look\nupon the matter as Florence looked at it, and as Theodore did also.\nHarry was to be back in town on Thursday morning. He could not,\nprobably, be seen or heard of on that day, because of his visit to\nLady Ongar. It was absolutely necessary that he should see Lady Ongar\nbefore he could come to Onslow Terrace, with possibility of becoming\nonce more the old Harry Clavering whom they were all to love. But\nMrs. Burton would by no means give up all hope. It was useless to say\nanything to Florence, but she still hoped that good might come.\n\nAnd then, as she thought of it all, a project came into her head.\nAlas, and alas! Was she not too late with her project? Why had she\nnot thought of it on the Tuesday or early on the Wednesday, when it\nmight possibly have been executed? But it was a project which she\nmust have kept secret from her husband, of which he would by no means\nhave approved; and as she remembered this, she told herself that\nperhaps it was as well that things should take their own course\nwithout such interference as she had contemplated.\n\nOn the Thursday morning there came to her a letter in a strange hand.\nIt was from Clavering,--from Harry's mother. Mrs. Clavering wrote,\nas she said, at her son's request, to say that he was confined to\nhis bed, and could not be in London as soon as he expected. Mrs.\nBurton was not to suppose that he was really ill, and none of the\nfamily were to be frightened. From this Mrs. Burton learned that Mrs.\nClavering knew nothing of Harry's apostasy. The letter went on to\nsay that Harry would write as soon as he himself was able, and would\nprobably be in London early next week,--at any rate before the end\nof it. He was a little feverish, but there was no cause for alarm.\nFlorence, of course, could only listen and turn pale. Now at any rate\nshe must remain in London.\n\nMrs. Burton's project might, after all, be feasible; but then what if\nher husband should really be angry with her? That was a misfortune\nwhich never yet had come upon her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nSHOWING WHY HARRY CLAVERING WAS WANTED AT THE RECTORY.\n\n\nThe letter which had summoned Harry to the parsonage had been from\nhis mother, and had begged him to come to Clavering at once, as\ntrouble had come upon them from an unexpected source. His father\nhad quarrelled with Mr. Saul. The rector and the curate had had an\ninterview, in which there had been high words, and Mr. Clavering had\nrefused to see Mr. Saul again. Fanny also was in great trouble,--and\nthe parish was, as it were, in hot water. Mrs. Clavering thought that\nHarry had better run down to Clavering, and see Mr. Saul. Harry, not\nunwillingly, acceded to his mother's request, much wondering at the\nsource of this new misfortune. As to Fanny, she, as he believed, had\nheld out no encouragement to Mr. Saul's overtures. When Mr. Saul had\nproposed to her,--making that first offer of which Harry had been\naware,--nothing could have been more steadfast than her rejection\nof the gentleman's hand. Harry had regarded Mr. Saul as little less\nthan mad to think of such a thing, but, thinking of him as a man\nvery different in his ways and feelings from other men, had believed\nthat he might go on at Clavering comfortably as curate in spite of\nthat little accident. It appeared, however, that he was not going on\ncomfortably; but Harry, when he left London, could not quite imagine\nhow such violent discomfort should have arisen that the rector and\nthe curate should be unable to meet each other. If the reader will\nallow me, I will go back a little and explain this.\n\nThe reader already knows what Fanny's brother did not know,--namely,\nthat Mr. Saul had pressed his suit again, and had pressed it very\nstrongly; and he also knows that Fanny's reception of the second\noffer was very different from her reception of the first. She had\nbegun to doubt;--to doubt whether her first judgment as to Mr. Saul's\ncharacter had not been unjust,--to doubt whether, in addressing her,\nhe was not right, seeing that his love for her was so strong,--to\ndoubt whether she did not like him better than she had thought she\ndid,--to doubt whether an engagement with a penniless curate was\nin truth a position utterly to be reprehended and avoided. Young\npenniless curates must love somebody as well as young beneficed\nvicars and rectors. And then Mr. Saul pleaded his cause so well!\n\nShe did not at once speak to her mother on the matter, and the fact\nthat she had a secret made her very wretched. She had left Mr. Saul\nin doubt, giving him no answer, and he had said that he would ask her\nagain in a few days what was to be his fate. She hardly knew how to\ntell her mother of this till she had told herself what were her own\nwishes. She thoroughly desired to have her mother in her confidence,\nand promised herself that it should be so before Mr. Saul renewed his\nsuit. He was a man who was never hurried or impatient in his doings.\nBut Fanny put off the interview with her mother,--put off her own\nfinal resolution, till it was too late, and Mr. Saul came upon her\nagain, when she was but ill-prepared for him.\n\nA woman, when she doubts whether she loves or does not love, is\ninclined five parts out of six towards the man of whom she is\nthinking. When a woman doubts she is lost, the cynics say. I simply\nassert, being no cynic, that when a woman doubts she is won. The more\nFanny thought of Mr. Saul, the more she felt that he was not the man\nfor which she had first taken him,--that he was of larger dimensions\nas regarded spirit, manhood, and heart, and better entitled to a\nwoman's love. She would not tell herself that she was attached to\nhim; but in all her arguments with herself against him, she rested\nher objection mainly on the fact that he had but seventy pounds a\nyear. And then the threatened attack, the attack that was to be\nfinal, came upon her before she was prepared for it!\n\nThey had been together as usual during the intervening time. It was,\nindeed, impossible that they should not be together. Since she had\nfirst begun to doubt about Mr. Saul, she had been more diligent than\nheretofore in visiting the poor and in attending to her school, as\nthough she were recognizing the duty which would specially be hers if\nshe were to marry such a one as he. And thus they had been brought\ntogether more than ever. All this her mother had seen, and seeing,\nhad trembled; but she had not thought it wise to say anything till\nFanny should speak. Fanny was very good and very prudent. It could\nnot be but that Fanny should know how impossible must be such a\nmarriage. As to the rector, he had no suspicions on the matter. Saul\nhad made himself an ass on one occasion, and there had been an end of\nit. As a curate Saul was invaluable, and therefore the fact of his\nhaving made himself an ass had been forgiven him. It was thus that\nthe rector looked at it.\n\nIt was hardly more than ten days since the last walk in Cumberly Lane\nwhen Mr. Saul renewed the attack. He did it again on the same spot,\nand at the same hour of the day. Twice a week, always on the same\ndays, he was in the chapel up at this end of the parish, and on these\ndays he could always find Fanny on her way home. When he put his head\nin at the little school door and asked for her, her mind misgave her.\nHe had not walked home with her since, and though he had been in the\nschool with her often, had always left her there, going about his\nown business, as though he were by no means desirous of her company.\nNow the time had come, and Fanny felt that she was not prepared. But\nshe took up her hat, and went out to him, knowing that there was no\nescape.\n\n\"Miss Clavering,\" said he, \"have you thought of what I was saying to\nyou?\" To this she made no answer, but merely played with the point of\nthe parasol which she held in her hand. \"You cannot but have thought\nof it,\" he continued. \"You could not dismiss it altogether from your\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"I have thought about it, of course,\" she said.\n\n\"And what does your mind say? Or rather what does your heart say?\nBoth should speak, but I would sooner hear the heart first.\"\n\n\"I am sure, Mr. Saul, that it is quite impossible.\"\n\n\"In what way impossible?\"\n\n\"Papa would not allow it.\"\n\n\"Have you asked him?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no.\"\n\n\"Or Mrs. Clavering?\"\n\nFanny blushed as she remembered how she had permitted the days to go\nby without asking her mother's counsel. \"No; I have spoken to no one.\nWhy should I, when I knew that it is impossible?\"\n\n\"May I speak to Mr. Clavering?\" To this Fanny made no immediate\nanswer, and then Mr. Saul urged the question again. \"May I speak to\nyour father?\"\n\nFanny felt that she was assenting, even in that she did not answer\nsuch a question by an immediate refusal of her permission; and yet\nshe did not mean to assent. \"Miss Clavering,\" he said, \"if you regard\nme with affection, you have no right to refuse me this request.\nI tell you so boldly. If you feel for me that love which would\nenable you to accept me as your husband, it is your duty to tell me\nso,--your duty to me, to yourself, and to your God.\"\n\nFanny did not quite see the thing in this light, and yet she did\nnot wish to contradict him. At this moment she forgot that in order\nto put herself on perfectly firm ground, she should have gone back\nto the first hypothesis, and assured him that she did not feel any\nsuch regard for him. Mr. Saul, whose intellect was more acute, took\nadvantage of her here, and chose to believe that that matter of her\naffection was now conceded to him. He knew what he was doing well,\nand is open to a charge of some jesuitry. \"Mr. Saul,\" said Fanny,\nwith grave prudence, \"it cannot be right for people to marry when\nthey have nothing to live upon.\" When she had shown him so plainly\nthat she had no other piece left on the board to play than this, the\ngame may be said to have been won on his side.\n\n\"If that be your sole objection,\" said he, \"you cannot but think it\nright that I and your father should discuss it.\" To this she made no\nreply whatever, and they walked along the lane for a considerable way\nin silence. Mr. Saul would have been glad to have had the interview\nover now, feeling that at any future meeting he would have stronger\npower of assuming the position of an accepted lover than he would do\nnow. Another man would have desired to get from her lips a decided\nword of love,--to take her hand, perhaps, and to feel some response\nfrom it,--to go further than this, as is not unlikely, and plead for\nthe happy indulgences of an accepted lover. But Mr. Saul abstained,\nand was wise in abstaining. She had not so far committed herself, but\nthat she might even now have drawn back, had he pressed her too hard.\nFor hand-pressing, and the titillations of love-making, Mr. Saul was\nnot adapted; but he was a man who, having once loved, would love on\nto the end.\n\nThe way, however, was too long to be completed without further\nspeech. Fanny, as she walked, was struggling to find some words\nby which she might still hold her ground, but the words were not\nforthcoming. It seemed to herself that she was being carried away\nby this man, because she had suddenly lost her remembrance of all\nnegatives. The more she struggled the more she failed, and at last\ngave it up in despair. Let Mr. Saul say what he would, it was\nimpossible that they should be married. All his arguments about duty\nwere nonsense. It could not be her duty to marry a man who would have\nto starve in his attempt to keep her. She wished she had told him at\nfirst that she did not love him, but that seemed to be too late now.\nThe moment that she was in the house she would go to her mother and\ntell her everything.\n\n\"Miss Clavering,\" said he, \"I shall see your father to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she ejaculated.\n\n\"I shall certainly do so in any event. I shall either tell him that\nI must leave the parish,--explaining to him why I must go; or I\nshall ask him to let me remain here in the hope that I may become\nhis son-in-law. You will not now tell me that I am to go?\" Fanny\nwas again silent, her memory failing her as to either negative or\naffirmative that would be of service. \"To stay here hopeless would\nbe impossible to me. Now I am not hopeless. Now I am full of hope.\nI think I could be happy, though I had to wait as Jacob waited.\"\n\n\"And perhaps have Jacob's consolation,\" said Fanny. She was lost by\nthe joke and he knew it. A grim smile of satisfaction crossed his\nthin face as he heard it, and there was a feeling of triumph at his\nheart. \"I am hardly fitted to be a patriarch, as the patriarchs were\nof old,\" he said. \"Though the seven years should be prolonged to\nfourteen I do not think I should seek any Leah.\"\n\nThey were soon at the gate, and his work for that evening was done.\nHe would go home to his solitary room at a neighbouring farm-house,\nand sit in triumph as he eat his morsel of cold mutton by himself.\nHe, without any advantage of a person to back him, poor, friendless,\nhitherto conscious that he was unfitted to mix even in ordinary\nsocial life--he had won the heart of the fairest woman he had ever\nseen. \"You will give me your hand at parting,\" he said, whereupon she\ntendered it to him with her eyes fixed upon the ground. \"I hope we\nunderstand each other,\" he continued. \"You may at any rate understand\nthis, that I love you with all my heart and all my strength. If\nthings prosper with me, all my prosperity shall be for you. If there\nbe no prosperity for me, you shall be my only consolation in this\nworld. You are my Alpha and my Omega, my first and last, my beginning\nand end,--my everything, my all.\" Then he turned away and left her,\nand there had come no negative from her lips. As far as her lips were\nconcerned no negative was any longer possible to her.\n\nShe went into the house knowing that she must at once seek her\nmother; but she allowed herself first to remain for some half-hour\nin her own bedroom, preparing the words that she would use. The\ninterview she knew would be difficult,--much more difficult than it\nwould have been before her last walk with Mr. Saul; and the worst of\nit was that she could not quite make up her mind as to what it was\nthat she wished to say. She waited till she should hear her mother's\nstep on the stairs. At last Mrs. Clavering came up to dress, and then\nFanny, following her quickly into her bedroom, abruptly began.\n\n\"Mamma,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you very much.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear?\"\n\n\"But you mustn't be in a hurry, mamma.\" Mrs. Clavering looked at her\nwatch, and declaring that it still wanted three-quarters of an hour\nto dinner, promised that she would not be very much in a hurry.\n\n\"Mamma, Mr. Saul has been speaking to me again.\"\n\n\"Has he, my dear? You cannot, of course, help it if he chooses to\nspeak to you, but he ought to know that it is very foolish. It must\nend in his having to leave us.\"\n\n\"That is what he says, mamma. He says he must go away unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Unless I will consent that he shall remain here as--\"\n\n\"As your accepted lover. Is that it, Fanny?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"Then he must go, I suppose. What else can any of us say? I shall be\nsorry both for his sake and for your papa's.\" Mrs. Clavering as she\nsaid this looked at her daughter, and saw at once that this edict on\nher part did not settle the difficulty. There was that in Fanny's\nface which showed trouble and the necessity of further explanation.\n\"Is not that what you think yourself, my dear?\" Mrs. Clavering asked.\n\n\"I should be very sorry if he had to leave the parish on my account.\"\n\n\"We all shall feel that, dearest; but what can we do? I presume you\ndon't wish him to remain as your lover?\"\n\n\"I don't know, mamma,\" said Fanny.\n\nIt was then as Mrs. Clavering had feared. Indeed from the first word\nthat Fanny had spoken on the present occasion, she had almost been\nsure of the facts, as they now were. To her father it would appear\nwonderful that his daughter should have come to love such a man as\nMr. Saul, but Mrs. Clavering knew better than he how far perseverance\nwill go with women,--perseverance joined with high mental capacity,\nand with high spirit to back it. She was grieved but not surprised,\nand would at once have accepted the idea of Mr. Saul becoming her\nson-in-law, had not the poverty of the man been so much against him.\n\"Do you mean, my dear, that you wish him to remain here after what\nhe has said to you? That would be tantamount to accepting him. You\nunderstand that, Fanny;--eh, dear?\"\n\n\"I suppose it would, mamma.\"\n\n\"And is that what you mean? Come, dearest, tell me the whole of it.\nWhat have you said to him yourself? What has he been led to think\nfrom the answer you have given him to-day?\"\n\n\"He says that he means to see papa to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But is he to see him with your consent?\" Fanny had hitherto placed\nherself in the nook of a bow-window which looked out into the garden,\nand there, though she was near to the dressing-table at which her\nmother was sitting, she could so far screen herself as almost to hide\nher face when she was speaking. From this retreat her mother found it\nnecessary to withdraw her; so she rose, and going to a sofa in the\nroom, bade her daughter come and sit beside her. \"A doctor, my dear,\ncan never do any good,\" she said, \"unless the patient will tell him\neverything. Have you told Mr. Saul that he may see papa,--as coming\nfrom you, you know?\"\n\n\"No, mamma;--I did not tell him that. I told him that it would be\naltogether impossible, because we should be so poor.\"\n\n\"He ought to have known that himself.\"\n\n\"But I don't think he ever thinks of such things as that, mamma. I\ncan't tell you quite what he said, but it went to show that he didn't\nregard money at all.\"\n\n\"But that is nonsense; is it not, Fanny?\"\n\n\"What he means is, not that people if they are fond of each other\nought to marry at once when they have got nothing to live upon, but\nthat they ought to tell each other so and then be content to wait.\nI suppose he thinks that some day he may have a living.\"\n\n\"But, Fanny, are you fond of him;--and have you ever told him so?\"\n\n\"I have never told him so, mamma.\"\n\n\"But you are fond of him?\" To this question Fanny made no answer, and\nnow Mrs. Clavering knew it all. She felt no inclination to scold her\ndaughter, or even to point out in very strong language how foolish\nFanny had been in allowing a man to engage her affections merely by\nasking for them. The thing was a misfortune, and should have been\navoided by the departure of Mr. Saul from the parish after his first\ndeclaration of love. He had been allowed to remain for the sake of\nthe rector's comfort, and the best must now be made of it. That Mr.\nSaul must now go was certain, and Fanny must endure the weariness\nof an attachment with an absent lover to which her father would not\nconsent. It was very bad, but Mrs. Clavering did not think that\nshe could make it better by attempting to scold her daughter into\nrenouncing the man.\n\n\"I suppose you would like me to tell papa all this before Mr. Saul\ncomes to-morrow?\"\n\n\"If you think it best, mamma.\"\n\n\"And you mean, dear, that you would wish to accept him, only that he\nhas no income?\"\n\n\"I think so, mamma.\"\n\n\"Have you told him so?\"\n\n\"I did not tell him so, but he understands it.\"\n\n\"If you did not tell him so, you might still think of it again.\"\n\nBut Fanny had surrendered herself now, and was determined to make no\nfurther attempt at sending the garrison up to the wall. \"I am sure,\nmamma, that if he were well off, like Edward, I should accept him. It\nis only because he has no income.\"\n\n\"But you have not told him that?\"\n\n\"I would not tell him anything without your consent and papa's. He\nsaid he should go to papa to-morrow, and I could not prevent that.\nI did say that I knew it was quite impossible.\"\n\nThe mischief was done and there was no help for it. Mrs. Clavering\ntold her daughter that she would talk it all over with the rector\nthat night, so that Fanny was able to come down to dinner without\nfearing any further scene on that evening. But on the following\nmorning she did not appear at prayers, nor was she present at the\nbreakfast table. Her mother went to her early, and she immediately\nasked if it was considered necessary that she should see her father\nbefore Mr. Saul came. But this was not required of her. \"Papa says\nthat it is out of the question,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"I told him\nso myself,\" said Fanny, beginning to whimper. \"And there must be no\nengagements,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"No, mamma. I haven't engaged\nmyself. I told him it was impossible.\" \"And papa thinks that Mr.\nSaul must leave him,\" continued Mrs. Clavering. \"I knew papa would\nsay that;--but, mamma, I shall not forget him for that reason.\" To\nthis Mrs. Clavering made no reply, and Fanny was allowed to remain\nupstairs till Mr. Saul had come and gone.\n\nVery soon after breakfast Mr. Saul did come. His presence at the\nrectory was so common that the servants were not generally summoned\nto announce his arrivals, but his visits were made to Mrs. Clavering\nand Fanny more often than to the rector. On this occasion he rang the\nbell, and asked for Mr. Clavering, and was shown into the rector's\nso-called study, in a way that the maid-servant felt to be unusual.\nAnd the rector was sitting uncomfortably prepared for the visit, not\nhaving had his after-breakfast cigar. He had been induced to declare\nthat he was not, and would not be, angry with Fanny; but Mr. Saul\nwas left to such indignation as he thought it incumbent on himself\nto express. In his opinion, the marriage was impossible, not only\nbecause there was no money, but because Mr. Saul was Mr. Saul,\nand because Fanny Clavering was Fanny Clavering. Mr. Saul was a\ngentleman; but that was all that could be said of him. There is a\nclass of country clergymen in England, of whom Mr. Clavering was one,\nand his son-in-law, Mr. Fielding, another, which is so closely allied\nto the squirearchy, as to possess a double identity. Such clergymen\nare not only clergymen, but they are country gentlemen also. Mr.\nClavering regarded clergymen of his class,--of the country gentlemen\nclass, as being quite distinct from all others,--and as being, I may\nsay, very much higher than all others, without reference to any money\nquestion. When meeting his brother rectors and vicars, he had quite\na different tone in addressing them,--as they might belong to his\nclass, or to another. There was no offence in this. The clerical\ncountry gentlemen understood it all as though there were some secret\nsign or shibboleth between them; but the outsiders had no complaint\nto make of arrogance, and did not feel themselves aggrieved. They\nhardly knew that there was an inner clerical familiarity to which\nthey were not admitted. But now that there was a young curate from\nthe outer circle demanding Mr. Clavering's daughter in marriage, and\nthat without a shilling in his pocket, Mr. Clavering felt that the\neyes of the offender must be opened. The nuisance to him was very\ngreat, but this opening of Mr. Saul's eyes was a duty from which he\ncould not shrink.\n\nHe got up when the curate entered, and greeted his curate, as though\nhe were unaware of the purpose of the present visit. The whole burden\nof the story was to be thrown upon Mr. Saul. But that gentleman was\nnot long in casting the burden from his shoulders. \"Mr. Clavering,\"\nhe said, \"I have come to ask your permission to be a suitor for your\ndaughter's hand.\"\n\nThe rector was almost taken aback by the abruptness of the request.\n\"Quite impossible, Mr. Saul,\" he said--\"quite impossible. I am told\nby Mrs. Clavering that you were speaking to Fanny again about this\nyesterday, and I must say, that I think you have been behaving very\nbadly.\"\n\n\"In what way have I behaved badly?\"\n\n\"In endeavouring to gain her affections behind my back.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Clavering, how otherwise could I gain them? How otherwise\ndoes any man gain any woman's love? If you mean--\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Saul. I don't think that there is any necessity for\nan argument between you and me on this point. That you cannot marry\nMiss Clavering is so self-evident that it does not require to be\ndiscussed. If there were nothing else against it, neither of you\nhave got a penny. I have not seen my daughter since I heard of this\nmadness,--hear me out if you please, sir,--since I heard of this\nmadness, but her mother tells me that she is quite aware of that\nfact. Your coming to me with such a proposition is an absurdity if it\nis nothing worse. Now you must do one of two things, Mr. Saul. You\nmust either promise me that this shall be at an end altogether, or\nyou must leave the parish.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not promise you that my hopes as they regard your\ndaughter will be at an end.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Saul, the sooner you go the better.\"\n\nA dark cloud came across Mr. Saul's brow as he heard these last\nwords. \"That is the way in which you would send away your groom, if\nhe had offended you,\" he said.\n\n\"I do not wish to be unnecessarily harsh,\" said Mr. Clavering, \"and\nwhat I say to you now I say to you not as my curate, but as to a most\nunwarranted suitor for my daughter's hand. Of course I cannot turn\nyou out of the parish at a day's notice. I know that well enough. But\nyour feelings as a gentleman ought to make you aware that you should\ngo at once.\"\n\n\"And that is to be my only answer?\"\n\n\"What answer did you expect?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking so much lately of the answers I might get from\nyour daughter, that I have not made other calculations. Perhaps I had\nno right to expect any other than that you have now given me.\"\n\n\"Of course you had not. And now I ask you again to give her up.\"\n\n\"I shall not do that, certainly.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Saul, you must go; and, inconvenient as it will be to\nmyself,--terribly inconvenient, I must ask you to go at once. Of\ncourse I cannot allow you to meet my daughter any more. As long as\nyou remain she will be debarred from going to her school, and you\nwill be debarred from coming here.\"\n\n\"If I say that I will not seek her at the school?\"\n\n\"I will not have it. It is out of the question that you should remain\nin the parish. You ought to feel it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Clavering, my going,--I mean my instant going,--is a matter of\nwhich I have not yet thought. I must consider it before I give you an\nanswer.\"\n\n\"It ought to require no consideration,\" said Mr. Clavering, rising\nfrom his chair,--\"none at all; not a moment's. Heavens and earth!\nWhy, what did you suppose you were to live upon? But I won't\ndiscuss it. I will not say one more word upon a subject which is so\ndistasteful to me. You must excuse me if I leave you.\"\n\nMr. Saul then departed, and from this interview had arisen that state\nof things in the parish which had induced Mrs. Clavering to call\nHarry to their assistance. The rector had become more energetic on\nthe subject than any of them had expected. He did not actually forbid\nhis wife to see Mr. Saul, but he did say that Mr. Saul should not\ncome to the rectory. Then there arose a question as to the Sunday\nservices, and yet Mr. Clavering would have no intercourse with his\ncurate. He would have no intercourse with him unless he would fix an\nimmediate day for going, or else promise that he would think no more\nof Fanny. Hitherto he had done neither, and therefore Mrs. Clavering\nhad sent for her son.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nMR. SAUL'S ABODE.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nWhen Harry Clavering left London he was not well, though he did not\ncare to tell himself that he was ill. But he had been so harassed by\nhis position, was so ashamed of himself, and as yet so unable to see\nany escape from his misery, that he was sore with fatigue and almost\nworn out with trouble. On his arrival at the parsonage, his mother at\nonce asked him if he was ill, and received his petulant denial with\nan ill-satisfied countenance. That there was something wrong between\nhim and Florence she suspected, but at the present moment she was\nnot disposed to inquire into that matter. Harry's love-affairs had\nfor her a great interest, but Fanny's love-affairs at the present\nmoment were paramount in her bosom. Fanny, indeed, had become very\ntroublesome since Mr. Saul's visit to her father. On the evening\nof her conversation with her mother, and on the following morning,\nFanny had carried herself with bravery, and Mrs. Clavering had been\ndisposed to think that her daughter's heart was not wounded deeply.\nShe had admitted the impossibility of her marriage with Mr. Saul, and\nhad never insisted on the strength of her attachment. But no sooner\nwas she told that Mr. Saul had been banished from the house, than she\ntook upon herself to mope in the most love-lorn fashion, and behaved\nherself as though she were the victim of an all-absorbing passion.\nBetween her and her father no word on the subject had been spoken,\nand even to her mother she was silent, respectful, and subdued, as\nit becomes daughters to be who are hardly used when they are in love.\nNow, Mrs. Clavering felt that in this her daughter was not treating\nher well.\n\n\"But you don't mean to say that she cares for him?\" Harry said to his\nmother, when they were alone on the evening of his arrival.\n\n\"Yes, she cares for him, certainly. As far as I can tell, she cares\nfor him very much.\"\n\n\"It is the oddest thing I ever knew in my life. I should have said he\nwas the last man in the world for success of that kind.\"\n\n\"One never can tell, Harry. You see he is a very good young man.\"\n\n\"But girls don't fall in love with men because they're good, mother.\"\n\n\"I hope they do,--for that and other things together.\"\n\n\"But he has got none of the other things. What a pity it was that he\nwas let to stay here after he first made a fool of himself.\"\n\n\"It's too late to think of that now, Harry. Of course she can't marry\nhim. They would have nothing to live on. I should say that he has no\nprospect of a living.\"\n\n\"I can't conceive how a man can do such a wicked thing,\" said Harry,\nmoralizing, and forgetting for a moment his own sins. \"Coming into\na house like this, and in such a position, and then undermining a\ngirl's affections, when he must know that it is quite out of the\nquestion that he should marry her! I call it downright wicked. It is\ntreachery of the worst sort, and coming from a clergyman is of course\nthe more to be condemned. I shan't be slow to tell him my mind.\"\n\n\"You will gain nothing by quarrelling with him.\"\n\n\"But how can I help it, if I am to see him at all?\"\n\n\"I mean that I would not be rough with him. The great thing is\nto make him feel that he should go away as soon as possible, and\nrenounce all idea of seeing Fanny again. You see, your father will\nhave no conversation with him at all, and it is so disagreeable about\nthe services. They'll have to meet in the vestry-room on Sunday, and\nthey won't speak. Will not that be terrible? Anything will be better\nthan that he should remain here.\"\n\n\"And what will my father do for a curate?\"\n\n\"He can't do anything till he knows when Mr. Saul will go. He talks\nof taking all the services himself.\"\n\n\"He couldn't do it, mother. He must not think of it. However, I'll\nsee Saul the first thing to-morrow.\"\n\nThe next day was Tuesday, and Harry proposed to leave the rectory at\nten o'clock for Mr. Saul's lodgings. Before he did so, he had a few\nwords with his father, who professed even deeper animosity against\nMr. Saul than his son. \"After that,\" he said, \"I'll believe that a\ngirl may fall in love with any man! People say all manner of things\nabout the folly of girls; but nothing but this,--nothing short of\nthis,--would have convinced me that it was possible that Fanny\nshould have been such a fool. An ape of a fellow,--not made like a\nman,--with a thin hatchet face, and unwholesome stubbly chin. Good\nheavens!\"\n\n\"He has talked her into it.\"\n\n\"But he is such an ass. As far as I know him, he can't say Bo! to a\ngoose.\"\n\n\"There I think you are perhaps wrong.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I've never been able to get a word from him except\nabout the parish. He is the most uncompanionable fellow. There's\nEdward Fielding is as active a clergyman as Saul; but Edward Fielding\nhas something to say for himself.\"\n\n\"Saul is a cleverer man than Edward is; but his cleverness is of a\ndifferent sort.\"\n\n\"It is of a sort that is very invisible to me. But what does all that\nmatter? He hasn't got a shilling. When I was a curate, we didn't\nthink of doing such things as that.\" Mr. Clavering had only been a\ncurate for twelve months, and during that time had become engaged\nto his present wife with the consent of every one concerned. \"But\nclergymen were gentlemen then. I don't know what the Church will come\nto; I don't indeed.\"\n\nAfter this Harry went away upon his mission. What a farce it was that\nhe should be engaged to make straight the affairs of other people,\nwhen his own affairs were so very crooked! As he walked up to the\nold farmhouse in which Mr. Saul was living, he thought of this, and\nacknowledged to himself that he could hardly make himself in earnest\nabout his sister's affairs, because of his own troubles. He tried\nto fill himself with a proper feeling of dignified wrath and high\npaternal indignation against the poor curate; but under it all, and\nat the back of it all, and in front of it all, there was ever present\nto him his own position. Did he wish to escape from Lady Ongar; and\nif so, how was he to do it? And if he did not escape from Lady Ongar,\nhow was he ever to hold up his head again?\n\nHe had sent a note to Mr. Saul on the previous evening giving notice\nof his intended visit, and had received an answer, in which the\ncurate had promised that he would be at home. He had never before\nbeen in Mr. Saul's room, and as he entered it, felt more strongly\nthan ever how incongruous was the idea of Mr. Saul as a suitor to his\nsister. The Claverings had always had things comfortable around them.\nThey were a people who had ever lived on Brussels carpets, and had\nseated themselves in capacious chairs. Ormolu, damask hangings, and\nSevres china were not familiar to them; but they had never lacked\nanything that is needed for the comfort of the first-class clerical\nworld. Mr. Saul in his abode boasted but few comforts. He inhabited\na big bed-room, in which there was a vast fireplace and a very small\ngrate,--the grate being very much more modern than the fireplace.\nThere was a small rag of a carpet near the hearth, and on this stood\na large deal table,--a table made of unalloyed deal, without any\nmendacious paint, putting forward a pretence in the direction of\nmahogany. One wooden Windsor arm-chair--very comfortable in its\nway--was appropriated to the use of Mr. Saul himself, and two other\nsmall wooden chairs flanked the other side of the fireplace. In one\ndistant corner stood Mr. Saul's small bed, and in another distant\ncorner stood his small dressing-table. Against the wall stood a\nrickety deal press in which he kept his clothes. Other furniture\nthere was none. One of the large windows facing towards the farmyard\nhad been permanently closed, and in the wide embrasure was placed\na portion of Mr. Saul's library,--books which he had brought with\nhim from college; and on the ground under this closed window were\narranged the others, making a long row, which stretched from the\nbed to the dressing-table, very pervious, I fear, to the attacks of\nmice. The big table near the fireplace was covered with books and\npapers,--and, alas, with dust; for he had fallen into that terrible\nhabit which prevails among bachelors, of allowing his work to remain\never open, never finished, always confused,--with papers above books,\nand books above papers,--looking as though no useful product could\never be made to come forth from such chaotic elements. But there Mr.\nSaul composed his sermons, and studied his Bible, and followed up,\nno doubt, some special darling pursuit which his ambition dictated.\nBut there he did not eat his meals; that had been made impossible by\nthe pile of papers and dust; and his chop, therefore, or his broiled\nrasher, or bit of pig's fry was deposited for him on the little\ndressing-table, and there consumed.\n\nSuch was the solitary apartment of the gentleman who now aspired to\nthe hand of Miss Clavering; and for this accommodation, including\nattendance, he paid the reasonable sum of \u00c2\u00a310 per annum. He then\nhad \u00c2\u00a360 left, with which to feed himself, clothe himself like a\ngentleman,--a duty somewhat neglected,--and perform his charities!\n\nHarry Clavering, as he looked around him, felt almost ashamed of his\nsister. The walls were whitewashed, and stained in many places; and\nthe floor in the middle of the room seemed to be very rotten. What\nyoung man who has himself dwelt ever in comfort would like such a\nhouse for his sister? Mr. Saul, however, came forward with no marks\nof visible shame on his face, and greeted his visitor frankly with an\nopen hand. \"You came down from London yesterday, I suppose?\" said Mr.\nSaul.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Take a seat;\" and Mr. Saul suggested the arm-chair, but Harry\ncontented himself with one of the others. \"I hope Mrs. Clavering is\nwell?\" \"Quite well,\" said Harry, cheerfully. \"And your father,--and\nsister?\" \"Quite well, thank you,\" said Harry, very stiffly. \"I would\nhave come down to you at the rectory,\" said Mr. Saul, \"instead of\nbringing you up here; only, as you have heard, no doubt, I and your\nfather have unfortunately had a difference.\" This Mr. Saul said\nwithout any apparent effort, and then left Harry to commence the\nfurther conversation.\n\n\"Of course, you know what I'm come here about?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Not exactly; at any rate not so clearly but what I would wish you to\ntell me.\"\n\n\"You have gone to my father as a suitor for my sister's hand.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"Now you must know that that is altogether impossible,--a thing not\nto be even talked of.\"\n\n\"So your father says. I need not tell you that I was very sorry to\nhear him speak in that way.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, you can't really be in earnest? You can't\nsuppose it possible that he would allow such an engagement?\"\n\n\"As to the latter question, I have no answer to give; but I certainly\nwas,--and certainly am in earnest.\"\n\n\"Then I must say that I think you have a very erroneous idea of what\nthe conduct of a gentleman should be.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Clavering,\" said Mr. Saul, rising, and standing with\nhis back to the big fireplace. \"Don't allow yourself to say in a\nhurry words which you will afterwards regret. I do not think you can\nhave intended to come here and tell me that I am not a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I don't want to have an argument with you; but you must give it up;\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Give what up? If you mean give up your sister, I certainly shall\nnever do that. She may give me up, and if you have anything to say on\nthat head, you had better say it to her.\"\n\n\"What right can you have,--without a shilling in the world--?\"\n\n\"I should have no right to marry her in such a condition,--with your\nfather's consent or without it. It is a thing which I have never\nproposed to myself for a moment,--or to her.\"\n\n\"And what have you proposed to yourself?\"\n\nMr. Saul paused a moment before he spoke, looking down at the dusty\nheaps upon his table, as though hoping that inspiration might come\nto him from them. \"I will tell you what I have proposed,\" said he at\nlast, \"as nearly as I can put it into words. I propose to myself to\nhave the image in my heart of one human being whom I can love above\nall the world beside; I propose to hope that I, as others, may some\nday marry, and that she whom I so love may become my wife; I propose\nto bear with such courage as I can much certain delay, and probable\nabsolute failure in all this; and I propose also to expect,--no,\nhardly to expect,--that that which I will do for her, she will do for\nme. Now you know all my mind, and you may be sure of this, that I\nwill instigate your sister to no disobedience.\"\n\n\"Of course she will not see you again.\"\n\n\"I shall think that hard after what has passed between us; but I\ncertainly shall not endeavour to see her clandestinely.\"\n\n\"And under these circumstances, Mr. Saul, of course you must leave\nus.\"\n\n\"So your father says.\"\n\n\"But leave us at once, I mean. It cannot be comfortable that you and\nmy father should go on in the parish together in this way.\"\n\n\"What does your father mean by 'at once'?\"\n\n\"The sooner the better; say in two months' time at furthest.\"\n\n\"Very well. I will go in two months' time. I have no other home to go\nto, and no other means of livelihood; but as your father wishes it,\nI will go at the end of two months. As I comply with this, I hope my\nrequest to see your sister once before I go will not be refused.\"\n\n\"It could do no good, Mr. Saul.\"\n\n\"To me it would do great good,--and, as I think, no harm to her.\"\n\n\"My father, I am sure, will not allow it. Indeed, why should he? Nor,\nas I understand, would my sister wish it.\"\n\n\"Has she said so?\"\n\n\"Not to me; but she has acknowledged that any idea of a marriage\nbetween herself and you is quite impossible, and after that I'm sure\nshe'll have too much sense to wish for an interview. If there is\nanything further that I can do for you, I shall be most happy.\" Mr.\nSaul did not see that Harry Clavering could do anything for him,\nand then Harry took his leave. The rector, when he heard of the\narrangement, expressed himself as in some sort satisfied. One month\nwould have been better than two, but then it could hardly be expected\nthat Mr. Saul could take himself away instantly, without looking for\na hole in which to lay his head. \"Of course it is understood that\nhe is not to see her?\" the rector said. In answer to this, Harry\nexplained what had taken place, expressing his opinion that Mr. Saul\nwould, at any rate, keep his word. \"Interview, indeed!\" said the\nrector. \"It is the man's audacity that most astonishes me. It passes\nme to think how such a fellow can dare to propose such a thing. What\nis it that he expects as the end of it?\" Then Harry endeavoured to\nrepeat what Mr. Saul had said as to his own expectations, but he\nwas quite aware that he failed to make his father understand those\nexpectations as he had understood them when the words came from Mr.\nSaul's own mouth. Harry Clavering had acknowledged to himself that it\nwas impossible not to respect the poor curate.\n\nTo Mrs. Clavering, of course, fell the task of explaining to Fanny\nwhat had been done, and what was going to be done. \"He is to go away,\nmy dear, at the end of two months.\"\n\n\"Very well, mamma.\"\n\n\"And, of course, you and he are not to meet before that.\"\n\n\"Of course not, if you and papa say so.\"\n\n\"I have told your papa that it will only be necessary to tell you\nthis, and that then you can go to your school just as usual, if you\nplease. Neither papa nor I would doubt your word for a moment.\"\n\n\"But what can I do if he comes to me?\" asked Fanny, almost\nwhimpering.\n\n\"He has said that he will not, and we do not doubt his word either.\"\n\n\"That I am sure you need not. Whatever anybody may say, Mr. Saul is\nas much a gentleman as though he had the best living in the diocese.\nNo one ever knew him break his word,--not a hair's breadth,--or\ndo--anything else--that he ought--not to do.\" And Fanny, as she\npronounced this rather strong eulogium, began to sob. Mrs. Clavering\nfelt that Fanny was headstrong, and almost ill-natured, in speaking\nin this tone of her lover, after the manner in which she had been\ntreated; but there could be no use in discussing Mr. Saul's virtues,\nand therefore she let the matter drop. \"If you will take my advice,\"\nshe said, \"you will go about your occupations just as usual. You'll\nsoon recover your spirits in that way.\"\n\n\"I don't want to recover my spirits,\" said Fanny; \"but if you wish it\nI'll go on with the schools.\"\n\nIt was quite manifest now that Fanny intended to play the role of a\nbroken-hearted young lady, and to regard the absent Mr. Saul with\npassionate devotion. That this should be so Mrs. Clavering felt to be\nthe more cruel, because no such tendencies had been shown before the\npaternal sentence against Mr. Saul had been passed. Fanny in telling\nher own tale had begun by declaring that any such an engagement was\nan impossibility. She had not asked permission to have Mr. Saul for a\nlover. She had given no hint that she even hoped for such permission.\nBut now when that was done which she herself had almost dictated, she\ntook upon herself to live as though she were ill-used as badly as a\nheroine in a castle among the Apennines! And in this way she would\nreally become deeply in love with Mr. Saul;--thinking of all which\nMrs. Clavering almost regretted that the edict of banishment had gone\nforth. It would, perhaps, have been better to have left Mr. Saul to\ngo about the parish, and to have laughed Fanny out of her fancy. But\nit was too late now for that, and Mrs. Clavering said nothing further\non the subject to any one.\n\nOn the day following his visit to the farm house, Harry Clavering\nwas unwell,--too unwell to go back to London; and on the next day he\nwas ill in bed. Then it was that he got his mother to write to Mrs.\nBurton;--and then also he told his mother a part of his troubles.\nWhen the letter was written he was very anxious to see it, and was\ndesirous that it should be specially worded, and so written as to\nmake Mrs. Burton certain that he was in truth too ill to come to\nLondon, though not ill enough to create alarm. \"Why not simply let me\nsay that you are kept here for a day or two?\" asked Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"Because I promised that I would be in Onslow Terrace to-morrow, and\nshe must not think that I would stay away if I could avoid it.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Clavering closed the letter and directed it. When she had\ndone that, and put on it the postage-stamp, she asked in a voice that\nwas intended to be indifferent whether Florence was in London; and,\nhearing that she was so, expressed her surprise that the letter\nshould not be written to Florence.\n\n\"My engagement was with Mrs. Burton,\" said Harry.\n\n\"I hope there is nothing wrong between you and Florence?\" said his\nmother. To this question Harry made no immediate answer, and Mrs.\nClavering was afraid to press it. But after a while he recurred to\nthe subject himself. \"Mother,\" he said, \"things are wrong between\nFlorence and me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry;--what has she done?\"\n\n\"It is rather what have I done! As for her, she has simply trusted\nherself to a man who has been false to her.\"\n\n\"Dear Harry, do not say that. What is it that you mean? It is not\ntrue about Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"Then you have heard, mother. Of course I do not know what you have\nheard, but it can hardly be worse than the truth. But you must not\nblame her. Whatever fault there may be, is all mine.\" Then he told\nher much of what had occurred in Bolton Street. We may suppose that\nhe said nothing of that mad caress,--nothing, perhaps, of the final\npromise which he made to Julia as he last passed out of her presence;\nbut he did give her to understand that he had in some way returned to\nhis old passion for the woman whom he had first loved.\n\nI should describe Mrs. Clavering in language too highly eulogistic\nwere I to lead the reader to believe that she was altogether averse\nto such advantages as would accrue to her son from a marriage so\nbrilliant as that which he might now make with the grandly dowered\nwidow of the late earl. Mrs. Clavering by no means despised worldly\ngoods; and she had, moreover, an idea that her highly gifted son\nwas better adapted to the spending than to the making of money. It\nhad come to be believed at the rectory that though Harry had worked\nvery hard at college,--as is the case with many highly born young\ngentlemen,--and though he would, undoubtedly, continue to work hard\nif he were thrown among congenial occupations,--such as politics and\nthe like,--nevertheless, he would never excel greatly in any drudgery\nthat would be necessary for the making of money. There had been\nsomething to be proud of in this, but there had, of course, been more\nto regret. But now if Harry were to marry Lady Ongar, all trouble\non that score would be over. But poor Florence! When Mrs. Clavering\nallowed herself to think of the matter she knew that Florence's\nclaims should be held as paramount. And when she thought further and\nthought seriously, she knew also that Harry's honour and Harry's\nhappiness demanded that he should be true to the girl to whom his\nhand had been promised. And, then, was not Lady Ongar's name tainted?\nIt might be that she had suffered cruel ill-usage in this. It might\nbe that no such taint had been deserved. Mrs. Clavering could plead\nthe injured woman's cause when speaking of it without any close\nreference to her own belongings; but it would have been very grievous\nto her, even had there been no Florence Burton in the case, that her\nson should make his fortune by marrying a woman as to whose character\nthe world was in doubt.\n\nShe came to him late in the evening when his sister and father had\njust left him, and sitting with her hand upon his, spoke one word,\nwhich perhaps had more weight with Harry than any word that had yet\nbeen spoken. \"Have you slept, dear?\" she said.\n\n\"A little before my father came in.\"\n\n\"My darling,\" she said,--\"you will be true to Florence; will you\nnot?\" Then there was a pause. \"My own Harry, tell me that you will be\ntrue where your truth is due.\"\n\n\"I will, mother,\" he said.\n\n\"My own boy; my darling boy; my own true gentleman!\" Harry felt that\nhe did not deserve the praise; but praise undeserved, though it may\nbe satire in disguise, is often very useful.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nPARTING.\n\n\nOn the next day Harry was not better, but the doctor still said that\nthere was no cause for alarm. He was suffering from a low fever, and\nhis sister had better be kept out of his room. He would not sleep,\nand was restless, and it might be some time before he could return to\nLondon.\n\nEarly in the day the rector came into his son's bedroom, and told him\nand his mother, who was there, the news which he had just heard from\nthe great house. \"Hugh has come home,\" he said, \"and is going out\nyachting for the rest of the summer. They are going to Norway in Jack\nStuart's yacht. Archie is going with them.\" Now Archie was known to\nbe a great man in a yacht, cognizant of ropes, well up in booms and\nspars, very intimate with bolts, and one to whose hands a tiller came\nas naturally as did the saddle of a steeple-chase horse to the legs\nof his friend Doodles. \"They are going to fish,\" said the rector.\n\n\"But Jack Stuart's yacht is only a river-boat,--or just big enough\nfor Cowes harbour, but nothing more,\" said Harry, roused in his bed\nto some excitement by the news.\n\n\"I know nothing about Jack Stuart or his boat either,\" said the\nrector; \"but that's what they told me. He's down here, at any rate,\nfor I saw the servant that came with him.\"\n\n\"What a shame it is,\" said Mrs. Clavering,--\"a scandalous shame.\"\n\n\"You mean his going away?\" said the rector.\n\n\"Of course I do;--his leaving her here by herself, all alone. He can\nhave no heart;--after losing her child and suffering as she has done.\nIt makes me ashamed of my own name.\"\n\n\"You can't alter him, my dear. He has his good qualities and his\nbad,--and the bad ones are by far the more conspicuous.\"\n\n\"I don't know any good qualities he has.\"\n\n\"He does not get into debt. He will not destroy the property. He will\nleave the family after him as well off as it was before him,--and\nthough he is a hard man, he does nothing actively cruel. Think of\nLord Ongar, and then you'll remember that there are worse men than\nHugh. Not that I like him. I am never comfortable for a moment in his\npresence. I always feel that he wants to quarrel with me, and that I\nalmost want to quarrel with him.\"\n\n\"I detest him,\" said Harry, from beneath the bedclothes.\n\n\"You won't be troubled with him any more this summer, for he means to\nbe off in less than a week.\"\n\n\"And what is she to do?\" asked Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"Live here as she has done ever since Julia married. I don't see that\nit will make much difference to her. He's never with her when he's in\nEngland, and I should think she must be more comfortable without him\nthan with him.\"\n\n\"It's a great catch for Archie,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Archie Clavering is a fool,\" said Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"They say he understands a yacht,\" said the rector, who then left the\nroom.\n\nThe rector's news was all true. Sir Hugh Clavering had come down\nto the Park, and had announced his intention of going to Norway in\nJack Stuart's yacht. Archie also had been invited to join the party.\nSir Hugh intended to leave the Thames in about a week, and had not\nthought it necessary to give his wife any intimation of the fact,\ntill he told her himself of his intention. He took, I think, a\ndelight in being thus over-harsh in his harshness to her. He proved\nto himself thus not only that he was master, but that he would be\nmaster without any let or drawback, without compunctions, and even\nwithout excuses for his ill-conduct. There should be no plea put in\nby him in his absences, that he had only gone to catch a few fish,\nwhen his intentions had been other than piscatorial. He intended\nto do as he liked now and always,--and he intended that his wife\nshould know that such was his intention. She was now childless, and\ntherefore he had no other terms to keep with her than those which\nappertained to her necessities for bed and board. There was the\nhouse, and she might live in it; and there were the butchers and the\nbakers, and other tradesmen to supply her wants. Nay;--there were the\nold carriage and the old horses at her disposal, if they could be of\nany service to her. Such were Sir Hugh Clavering's ideas as to the\nbonds inflicted upon him by his marriage vows.\n\n\"I'm going to Norway next week.\" It was thus Sir Hugh communicated\nhis intention to his wife within five minutes of their first\ngreeting.\n\n\"To Norway, Hugh?\"\n\n\"Yes;--why not to Norway? I and one or two others have got some\nfishing there. Archie is going too. It will keep him from spending\nhis money;--or rather from spending money which isn't his.\"\n\n\"And for how long will you be gone?\"\n\nIt was part of Sir Hugh Clavering's theory as to these matters\nthat there should be no lying in the conduct of them. He would not\ncondescend to screen any part of his doings by a falsehood;--so he\nanswered this question with exact truth.\n\n\"I don't suppose we shall be back before October.\"\n\n\"Not before October?\"\n\n\"No. We are talking of putting in on the coast of Normandy somewhere;\nand probably may run down to Brittany. I shall be back, at any rate,\nfor the hunting. As for the partridges, the game has gone so much to\nthe devil here, that they are not worth coming for.\"\n\n\"You'll be away four months!\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall if I don't come back till October.\" Then he left\nher, calculating that she would have considered the matter before\nhe returned, and have decided that no good could come to her from\ncomplaint. She knew his purpose now, and would no doubt reconcile\nherself to it quickly;--perhaps with a few tears, which would not\nhurt him if he did not see them.\n\nBut this blow was almost more than Lady Clavering could bear,--was\nmore than she could bear in silence. Why she should have grudged her\nhusband his trip abroad, seeing that his presence in England could\nhardly have been a solace to her, it is hard to understand. Had he\nremained in England, he would rarely have been at Clavering Park; and\nwhen he was at the Park he would rarely have given her the benefit\nof his society. When they were together he was usually scolding her,\nor else sitting in gloomy silence, as though that phase of his life\nwas almost insupportable to him. He was so unusually disagreeable in\nhis intercourse with her, that his absence, one would think, must be\npreferable to his presence. But women can bear anything better than\ndesertion. Cruelty is bad, but neglect is worse than cruelty, and\ndesertion worse even than neglect. To be treated as though she were\nnot in existence, or as though her existence were a nuisance simply\nto be endured, and, as far as possible, to be forgotten, was more\nthan even Lady Clavering could bear without complaint. When her\nhusband left her, she sat meditating how she might turn against her\noppressor. She was a woman not apt for fighting,--unlike her sister,\nwho knew well how to use the cudgels in her own behalf; she was\ntimid, not gifted with a full flow of words, prone to sink and become\ndependent; but she,--even she,--with all these deficiencies,--felt\nthat she must make some stand against the outrage to which she was\nnow to be subjected.\n\n\"Hugh,\" she said, when next she saw him, \"you can't really mean that\nyou are going to leave me from this time till the winter?\"\n\n\"I said nothing about the winter.\"\n\n\"Well,--till October?\"\n\n\"I said that I was going, and I usually mean what I say.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe it, Hugh; I cannot bring myself to think that you\nwill be so cruel.\"\n\n\"Look here, Hermy, if you take to calling names I won't stand it.\"\n\n\"And I won't stand it, either. What am I to do? Am I to be here in\nthis dreadful barrack of a house all alone? How would you like it?\nWould you bear it for one month, let alone four or five? I won't\nremain here; I tell you that fairly.\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go?\"\n\n\"I don't want to go anywhere, but I'll go away somewhere and die;--I\nwill indeed. I'll destroy myself, or something.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"Yes; of course it's a joke to you. What have I done to deserve this?\nHave I ever done anything that you told me not? It's all because of\nHughy,--my darling,--so it is; and it's cruel of you, and not like a\nhusband; and it's not manly. It's very cruel. I didn't think anybody\nwould have been so cruel as you are to me.\" Then she broke down and\nburst into tears.\n\n\"Have you done, Hermy?\" said her husband.\n\n\"No; I've not done.\"\n\n\"Then go on again,\" said he.\n\nBut in truth she had done, and could only repeat her last accusation.\n\"You're very, very cruel.\"\n\n\"You said that before.\"\n\n\"And I'll say it again. I'll tell everybody; so I will. I'll tell\nyour uncle at the rectory, and he shall speak to you.\"\n\n\"Look here, Hermy; I can bear a deal of nonsense from you because\nsome women are given to talk nonsense; but if I find you telling\ntales about me out of this house, and especially to my uncle, or\nindeed to anybody, I'll let you know what it is to be cruel.\"\n\n\"You can't be worse than you are.\"\n\n\"Don't try me; that's all. And as I suppose you have now said all\nthat you've got to say, if you please we will regard that subject as\nfinished.\" The poor woman had said all that she could say, and had no\nfurther means of carrying on the war. In her thoughts she could do\nso; in her thoughts she could wander forth out of the gloomy house in\nthe night, and perish in the damp and cold, leaving a paper behind\nher to tell the world that her husband's cruelty had brought her to\nthat pass. Or she would go to Julia and leave him for ever. Julia,\nshe thought, would still receive her. But as to one thing she had\ncertainly made up her mind; she would go with her complaint to Mrs.\nClavering at the rectory, let her lord and master show his anger in\nwhatever form he might please.\n\nThe next day Sir Hugh himself made her a proposition which somewhat\nsoftened the aspect of affairs. This he did in his usual voice, with\nsomething of a smile on his face, and speaking as though he were\naltogether oblivious of the scenes of yesterday. \"I was thinking,\nHermy,\" he said, \"that you might have Julia down here while I am\naway.\"\n\n\"Have Julia here?\"\n\n\"Yes; why not? She'll come, I'm sure, when she knows that my back is\nturned.\"\n\n\"I've never thought about asking her,--at least not lately.\"\n\n\"No; of course. But you might as well do so now. It seems that she\nnever goes to Ongar Park, and, as far as I can learn, never will. I'm\ngoing to see her myself.\"\n\n\"You going to see her?\"\n\n\"Yes; Lord Ongar's people want to know whether she can be induced\nto give up the place; that is, to sell her interest in it. I have\npromised to see her. Do you write her a letter first, and tell her\nthat I want to see her; and ask her also to come here as soon as she\ncan leave London.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't the lawyers do it better than you?\"\n\n\"Well;--one would think so; but I am commissioned to make her a kind\nof apology from the whole Courton family. They fancy they've been\nhard upon her; and, by George, I believe they have. I may be able to\nsay a word for myself too. If she isn't a fool she'll put her anger\nin her pocket, and come down to you.\"\n\nLady Clavering liked the idea of having her sister with her, but she\nwas not quite meek enough to receive the permission now given her as\nfull compensation for the injury done. She said that she would do as\nhe had bidden her, and then went back to her own grievances. \"I don't\nsuppose Julia, even if she would come for a little time, would find\nit very pleasant to live in such a place as this, all alone.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't be all alone when you are with her,\" said Hugh,\ngruffly, and then again went out, leaving his wife to become used to\nher misfortune by degrees.\n\nIt was not surprising that Lady Clavering should dislike her solitude\nat Clavering Park house, nor surprising that Sir Hugh should find the\nplace disagreeable. The house was a large, square, stone building,\nwith none of the prettinesses of modern country-houses about it.\nThe gardens were away from the house, and the cold desolate flat\npark came up close around the windows. The rooms were large and\nlofty,--very excellent for the purpose of a large household, but\nwith nothing of that snug, pretty comfort which solitude requires for\nits solace. The furniture was old and heavy, and the hangings were\ndark in colour. Lady Clavering when alone there,--and she generally\nwas alone,--never entered the rooms on the ground-floor. Nor did she\never pass through the wilderness of a hall by which the front-door\nwas to be reached. Throughout more than half her days she never came\ndownstairs at all; but when she did so, preparatory to being dragged\nabout the parish lanes in the old family carriage, she was let out at\na small side-door; and so it came to pass that during the absences of\nthe lord of the mansion, the shutters were not even moved from any of\nthe lower windows. Under such circumstances there can be no wonder\nthat Lady Clavering regarded the place as a prison. \"I wish you could\ncome upon it unawares, and see how gloomy it is,\" she said to him.\n\"I don't think you'd stand it alone for two days, let alone all your\nlife.\"\n\n\"I'll shut it up altogether if you like,\" said he.\n\n\"And where am I to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"You can go to Moor Hall if you please.\" Now Moor Hall was a small\nhouse, standing on a small property belonging to Sir Hugh, in that\npart of Devonshire which lies north of Dartmoor, somewhere near the\nHolsworthy region, and which is perhaps as ugly, as desolate, and as\nremote as any part of England. Lady Clavering had heard much of Moor\nHall, and dreaded it as the heroine, made to live in the big grim\ncastle low down among the Apennines, dreads the smaller and grimmer\ncastle which is known to exist somewhere higher up in the mountains.\n\n\"Why couldn't I go to Brighton?\" said Lady Clavering boldly.\n\n\"Because I don't choose it,\" said Sir Hugh. After that she did go\nto the rectory, and told Mrs. Clavering all her troubles. She had\nwritten to her sister, having, however, delayed the doing of this for\ntwo or three days, and she had not at this time received an answer\nfrom Lady Ongar. Nor did she hear from her sister till after Sir Hugh\nhad left her. It was on the day before his departure that she went to\nthe rectory, finding herself driven to this act of rebellion by his\nthreat of Moor Hall. \"I will never go there unless I am dragged there\nby force,\" she said to Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"I don't think he means that,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"He only wants to\nmake you understand that you'd better remain at the Park.\"\n\n\"But if you knew what a house it is to be all alone in!\"\n\n\"Dear Hermione, I do know! But you must come to us oftener, and let\nus endeavour to make it better for you.\"\n\n\"But how can I do that? How can I come to his uncle's house, just\nbecause my own husband has made my own home so wretched that I cannot\nbear it. I'm ashamed to do that. I ought not to be telling you all\nthis, of course. I don't know what he'd do if he knew it; but it is\nso hard to bear it all without telling some one.\"\n\n\"My poor dear!\"\n\n\"I sometimes think I'll ask Mr. Clavering to speak to him, and to\ntell him at once that I will not submit to it any longer. Of course\nhe would be mad with rage, but if he were to kill me I should like it\nbetter than having to go on in this way. I'm sure he is only waiting\nfor me to die.\"\n\nMrs. Clavering said all that she could to comfort the poor woman, but\nthere was not much that she could say. She had strongly advocated the\nplan of having Lady Ongar at the Park, thinking perhaps that Harry\nwould be more safe while that lady was at Clavering, than he might\nperhaps be if she remained in London. But Mrs. Clavering doubted much\nwhether Lady Ongar would consent to make such a visit. She regarded\nLady Ongar as a hard, worldly, pleasure-seeking woman,--sinned\nagainst perhaps in much, but also sinning in much herself,--to whom\nthe desolation of the Park would be even more unendurable than it was\nto the elder sister. But of this, of course, she said nothing. Lady\nClavering left her, somewhat quieted, if not comforted; and went back\nto pass her last evening with her husband.\n\n\"Upon second thought, I'll go by the first train,\" he said, as he saw\nher for a moment before she went up to dress. \"I shall have to be off\nfrom here a little after six, but I don't mind that in summer.\" Thus\nshe was to be deprived of such gratification as there might have been\nin breakfasting with him on the last morning! It might be hard to say\nin what that gratification would have consisted. She must by this\ntime have learned that his presence gave her none of the pleasures\nusually expected from society. He slighted her in everything. He\nrarely vouchsafed to her those little attentions which all women\nexpect from all gentlemen. If he handed her a plate, or cut for her\na morsel of bread from the loaf, he showed by his manner and by his\nbrow that the doing so was a nuisance to him. At their meals he\nrarely spoke to her,--having always at breakfast a paper or a book\nbefore him, and at dinner devoting his attention to a dog at his\nfeet. Why should she have felt herself cruelly ill-used in this\nmatter of his last breakfast,--so cruelly ill-used that she wept\nafresh over it as she dressed herself,--seeing that she would lose so\nlittle? Because she loved the man;--loved him, though she now thought\nthat she hated him. We very rarely, I fancy, love those whose love\nwe have not either possessed or expected,--or at any rate for whose\nlove we have not hoped; but when it has once existed, ill-usage will\nseldom destroy it. Angry as she was with the man, ready as she was to\ncomplain of him, to rebel against him,--perhaps to separate herself\nfrom him for ever, nevertheless she found it to be a cruel grievance\nthat she should not sit at table with him on the morning of his\ngoing. \"Jackson shall bring me a cup of coffee as I'm dressing,\"\nhe said, \"and I'll breakfast at the club.\" She knew that there was\nno reason for this, except that breakfasting at his club was more\nagreeable to him than breakfasting with his wife.\n\nShe had got rid of her tears before she came down to dinner, but\nstill she was melancholy and almost lachrymose. This was the last\nnight, and she felt that something special ought to be said; but\nshe did not know what she expected, or what it was that she herself\nwished to say. I think that she was longing for an opportunity to\nforgive him,--only that he would not be forgiven. If he would have\nspoken one soft word to her, she would have accepted that one word as\nan apology; but no such word came. He sat opposite to her at dinner,\ndrinking his wine and feeding his dog; but he was no more gracious to\nher at this dinner than he had been on any former day. She sat there\npretending to eat, speaking a dull word now and then, to which his\nanswer was a monosyllable, looking out at him from under her eyes,\nthrough the candlelight, to see whether any feeling was moving him;\nand then having pretended to eat a couple of strawberries she left\nhim to himself. Still, however, this was not the last. There would\ncome some moment for an embrace,--for some cold half-embrace, in\nwhich he would be forced to utter something of a farewell.\n\nHe, when he was left alone, first turned his mind to the subject of\nJack Stuart and his yacht. He had on that day received a letter from\na noble friend,--a friend so noble that he was able to take liberties\neven with Sir Hugh Clavering,--in which his noble friend had told him\nthat he was a fool to trust himself on so long an expedition in Jack\nStuart's little boat. Jack, the noble friend said, knew nothing of\nthe matter, and as for the masters who were hired for the sailing of\nsuch crafts, their only object was to keep out as long as possible,\nwith an eye to their wages and perquisites. It might be all very well\nfor Jack Stuart, who had nothing in the world to lose but his life\nand his yacht; but his noble friend thought that any such venture\non the part of Sir Hugh was simply tomfoolery. But Sir Hugh was an\nobstinate man, and none of the Claverings were easily made afraid by\npersonal danger. Jack Stuart might know nothing about the management\nof a boat, but Archie did. And as for the smallness of the craft,--he\nknew of a smaller craft which had been out on the Norway coast during\nthe whole of the last season. So he drove that thought away from his\nmind, with no strong feelings of gratitude towards his noble friend.\n\nAnd then for a few moments he thought of his own home. What had his\nwife done for him, that he should put himself out of his way to do\nmuch for her? She had brought him no money. She had added nothing\neither by her wit, beauty, or rank to his position in the world.\nShe had given him no heir. What had he received from her that he\nshould endure her commonplace conversation, and washed-out, dowdy\nprettinesses? Perhaps some momentary feeling of compassion, some\ntwang of conscience, came across his heart, as he thought of it all;\nbut if so he checked it instantly, in accordance with the teachings\nof his whole life. He had made his reflections on all these things,\nand had tutored his mind to certain resolutions, and would not allow\nhimself to be carried away by any womanly softness. She had her\nhouse, her carriage, her bed, her board, and her clothes; and seeing\nhow very little she herself had contributed to the common fund, her\nhusband determined that in having those things she had all that she\nhad a right to claim. Then he drank a glass of sherry, and went into\nthe drawing-room with that hard smile upon his face, which he was\naccustomed to wear when he intended to signify to his wife that\nshe might as well make the best of existing things, and not cause\nunnecessary trouble, by giving herself airs or assuming that she was\nunhappy.\n\nHe had his cup of coffee, and she had her cup of tea, and she made\none or two little attempts at saying something special,--something\nthat might lead to a word or two as to their parting; but he was\ncareful and crafty, and she was awkward and timid,--and she failed.\nHe had hardly been there an hour, when looking at his watch he\ndeclared that it was ten o'clock, and that he would go to bed. Well;\nperhaps it might be best to bring it to an end, and to go through\nthis embrace, and have done with it! Any tender word that was to be\nspoken on either side, it was now clear to her, must be spoken in\nthat last farewell. There was a tear in her eye as she rose to kiss\nhim; but the tear was not there of her own good will, and she strove\nto get rid of it without his seeing it. As he spoke he also rose,\nand having lit for himself a bed-candle was ready to go. \"Good-by,\nHermy,\" he said, submitting himself, with the candle in his hand, to\nthe inevitable embrace.\n\n\"Good-by, Hugh; and God bless you,\" she said, putting her arms round\nhis neck. \"Pray,--pray take care of yourself.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. His position with the candle was awkward, and\nhe wished that it might be over.\n\n\n[Illustration: Husband and wife.]\n\n\nBut she had a word prepared which she was determined to utter,--poor\nweak creature that she was. She still had her arm round his\nshoulders, so that he could not escape without shaking her off, and\nher forehead was almost resting on his bosom. \"Hugh,\" she said, \"you\nmust not be angry with me for what I said to you.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he;--\"I won't.\"\n\n\"And, Hugh,\" said she; \"of course I can't like your going.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will,\" said he.\n\n\"No;--I can't like it; but, Hugh, I will not think ill of it any\nmore. Only be here as much as you can when you come home.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said he; then he kissed her forehead and escaped from\nher, and went his way, telling himself, as he went, that she was a\nfool.\n\nThat was the last he saw of her,--before his yachting commenced;\nbut she,--poor fool,--was up by times in the morning, and, peeping\nout between her curtains as the early summer sun glanced upon her\neyelids, saw him come forth from the porch and descend the great\nsteps, and get into his dog-cart and drive himself away. Then, when\nthe sound of the gig could be no longer heard, and when her eyes\ncould no longer catch the last expiring speck of his hat, the poor\nfool took herself to bed again and cried herself to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nCAPTAIN CLAVERING MAKES HIS LAST ATTEMPT.\n\n\nThe yachting scheme was first proposed to Archie by his brother Hugh.\n\"Jack says that he can make a berth for you, and you'd better come,\"\nsaid the elder brother, understanding that when his edict had thus\ngone forth, the thing was as good as arranged. \"Jack finds the boat\nand men, and I find the grub and wine,--and pay for the fishing,\"\nsaid Hugh; \"so you need not make any bones about it.\" Archie was not\ndisposed to make any bones about it as regarded his acceptance either\nof the berth or of the grub and wine, and as he would be expected to\nearn his passage by his work, there was no necessity for any scruple;\nbut there arose the question whether he had not got more important\nfish to fry. He had not as yet made his proposal to Lady Ongar, and\nalthough he now knew that he had nothing to hope from the Russian\nspy,--nevertheless he thought that he might as well try his own hand\nat the venture. His resolution on this head was always stronger after\ndinner than before, and generally became stronger and more strong\nas the evening advanced;--so that he usually went to bed with a\nfirm determination \"to pop,\" as he called it to his friend Doodles,\nearly on the next day; but distance affected him as well as the hour\nof the day, and his purpose would become surprisingly cool in the\nneighbourhood of Bolton Street. When, however, his brother suggested\nthat he should be taken altogether away from the scene of action, he\nthought of the fine income and of Ongar Park with pangs of regret,\nand ventured upon a mild remonstrance. \"But there's this affair of\nJulia, you know,\" said he.\n\n\"I thought that was all off,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"O dear, no; not off at all. I haven't asked her yet.\"\n\n\"I know you've not; and I don't suppose you ever will.\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall;--that is to say, I mean it. I was advised not to be\nin too much of a hurry; that is to say, I thought it best to let her\nsettle down a little after her first seeing me.\"\n\n\"To recover from her confusion?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly that. I don't suppose she was confused.\"\n\n\"I should say not. My idea is that you haven't a ghost of chance, and\nthat as you haven't done anything all this time, you need not trouble\nyourself now.\"\n\n\"But I have done something,\" said Archie, thinking of his seventy\npounds.\n\n\"You may as well give it up, for she means to marry Harry.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"But I tell you she does. While you've been thinking he's been doing.\nFrom what I hear he may have her to-morrow for the asking.\"\n\n\"But he's engaged to that girl whom they had with them down at the\nrectory,\" said Archie, in a tone which showed with what horror he\nshould regard any inconstancy towards Florence Burton on the part of\nHarry Clavering.\n\n\"What does that matter? You don't suppose he'll let seven thousand\na year slip through his fingers because he had promised to marry a\nlittle girl like her? If her people choose to proceed against him\nthey'll make him pay swinging damages; that is all.\"\n\nArchie did not like this idea at all, and became more than ever\nintent on his own matrimonial prospects. He almost thought that he\nhad a right to Lady Ongar's money, and he certainly did think that\na monstrous injustice was done to him by this idea of a marriage\nbetween her and his cousin. \"I mean to ask her as I've gone so far,\ncertainly,\" said he.\n\n\"You can do as you like about that.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course I can do as I like; but when a fellow has gone in for\na thing, he likes to see it through.\" He was still thinking of the\nseventy pounds which he had invested, and which he could now recover\nonly out of Lady Ongar's pocket.\n\n\"And you mean to say you won't come to Norway?\"\n\n\"Well; if she accepts me--\"\n\n\"If she accepts you,\" said Hugh, \"of course you can't come; but\nsupposing she don't?\"\n\n\"In that case, I might as well do that as anything else,\" said\nArchie. Whereupon Sir Hugh signified to Jack Stuart that Archie would\njoin the party, and went down to Clavering with no misgiving on that\nhead.\n\nSome few days after this there was another little dinner at the\nmilitary club, to which no one was admitted but Archie and his friend\nDoodles. Whenever these prandial consultations were held, Archie\npaid the bill. There were no spoken terms to that effect, but the\nregulation seemed to come naturally to both of them. Why should\nDoodles be taken from his billiards half-an-hour earlier than usual,\nand devote a portion of the calculating powers of his brain to\nArchie's service without compensation? And a richer vintage was\nneeded when so much thought was required, the burden of which Archie\nwould not of course allow to fall on his friend's shoulders. Were\nnot this explained, the experienced reader would regard the devoted\nfriendship of Doodles as exaggerated.\n\n\"I certainly shall ask her to-morrow,\" said Archie, looking with\na thoughtful cast of countenance through the club window into the\nstreet. \"It may be hurrying the matter a little, but I can't help\nthat.\" He spoke in a somewhat boastful tone, as though he were proud\nof himself and had forgotten that he had said the same words once or\ntwice before.\n\n\"Make her know that you're there; that's everything,\" said Doodles.\n\"Since I fathomed that woman in Mount Street, I've felt that you must\nmake the score off your own bat, if you're to make it at all.\"\n\n\"You did that well,\" said Archie, who knew that the amount of\npleasing encouragement which he might hope to get from his friend,\nmust depend on the praise which he himself should bestow. \"Yes; you\ncertainly did bowl her over uncommon well.\"\n\n\"That kind of thing just comes within my line,\" said Doodles, with\nconscious pride. \"Now, as to asking Lady Ongar downright to marry\nme,--upon my word I believe I should be half afraid of doing it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I've none of that kind of feeling,\" said Archie.\n\n\"It comes more in your way, I daresay,\" said Doodles. \"But for me,\nwhat I like is a little bit of management,--what I call a touch of\nthe diplomatic. You'll be able to see her to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I hope so. I shall go early,--that is, as soon as I've looked\nthrough the papers and written a few letters. Yes, I think she'll see\nme. And as for what Hugh says about Harry Clavering, why, d---- it,\nyou know, a fellow can't go on in that way; can he?\"\n\n\"Because of the other girl, you mean?\"\n\n\"He has had her down among all our people, just as though they were\ngoing to be married to-morrow. If a man is to do that kind of thing,\nwhat woman can be safe?\"\n\n\"I wonder whether she likes him?\" asked the crafty Doodles.\n\n\"She did like him, I fancy, in her calf days; but that means nothing.\nShe knows what she's at now, bless you, and she'll look to the\nfuture. It's my son who'll have the Clavering property and be the\nbaronet, not his. You see what a string to my bow that is.\"\n\nWhen this banquet was over, Doodles made something of a resolution\nthat it should be the last to be eaten on that subject. The matter\nhad lost its novelty, and the price paid to him was not sufficient to\nsecure his attention any longer. \"I shall be here to-morrow at four,\"\nhe said, as he rose from his chair with the view of retreating to the\nsmoking-room, \"and then we shall know all about it. Whichever way\nit's to be, it isn't worth your while keeping such a thing as that\nin hand any longer. I should say give her her chance to-morrow, and\nthen have done with it.\" Archie in reply to this declared that those\nwere exactly his sentiments, and then went away to prepare himself in\nsilence and solitude for the next day's work.\n\nOn the following day at two o'clock Lady Ongar was sitting alone\nin the front room on the ground-floor in Bolton Street. Of Harry\nClavering's illness she had as yet heard nothing, nor of his absence\nfrom London. She had not seen him since he had parted from her on\nthat evening when he had asked her to be his wife, and the last words\nshe had heard from his lips had made this request. She, indeed, had\nthen bade him be true to her rival,--to Florence Burton. She had told\nhim this in spite of her love,--of her love for him and of his for\nher. They two, she had said, could not now become man and wife;--but\nhe had not acknowledged the truth of what she had said. She could\nnot write to him. She could make no overtures. She could ask no\nquestions. She had no friend in whom she could place confidence. She\ncould only wait for him, till he should come to her or send to her,\nand let her know what was to be her fate.\n\nAs she now sat she held a letter in her hand which had just\nbeen brought to her from Sophie,--from her poor, famished, but\nindefatigable Sophie. Sophie she had not seen since they had parted\non the railway platform, and then the parting was supposed to be made\nin lasting enmity. Desolate as she was, she had congratulated herself\nmuch on her escape from Sophie's friendship, and was driven by no\nqualms of her heart to long for a renewal of the old ties. But it was\nnot so with the more affectionate Sophie; and Sophie therefore had\nwritten,--as follows:--\n\n\n   Mount Street--Friday morning.\n\n   DEAREST DEAREST JULIE,--My heart is so sad that I cannot\n   keep my silence longer. What; can such friendship as ours\n   has been be made to die all in a minute? Oh, no;--not\n   at least in my bosom, which is filled with love for my\n   Julie. And my Julie will not turn from her friend, who\n   has been so true to her,--ah, at such moments too,--oh,\n   yes, at such moments!--just for an angry word, or a little\n   indiscretion. What was it after all about my brother?\n   Bah! He is a fool; that is all. If you shall wish it,\n   I will never speak to him again. What is my brother to\n   me, compared to my Julie? My brother is nothing to me. I\n   tell him we go to that accursed island,--accursed island\n   because my Julie has quarrelled with me there,--and he\n   arranges himself to follow us. What could I do? I could\n   not tie him up by the leg in his London club. He is a man\n   whom no one can tie up by the leg. Mon Dieu, no. He is\n   very hard to tie up.\n\n   Do I wish him for your husband? Never! Why should I wish\n   him for your husband? If I was a man, my Julie, I should\n   wish you for myself. But I am not, and why should you not\n   have him whom you like the best? If I was you, with your\n   beauty and money and youth, I would have any man that\n   I liked,--everything. I know, of course,--for did I not\n   see? It is that young Clavering to whom your little\n   heart wishes to render itself;--not the captain who is a\n   fool,--such a fool! but the other who is not a fool, but\n   a fine fellow;--and so handsome! Yes; there is no doubt\n   as to that. He is beautiful as a Phoebus. [This was\n   good-natured on the part of Sophie, who, as the reader may\n   remember, hated Harry Clavering herself.]\n\n   Well,--why should he not be your own? As for your poor\n   Sophie, she would do all in her power to assist the friend\n   whom she love. There is that little girl,--yes; it is\n   true as I told you. But little girls cannot have all they\n   want always. He is a gay deceiver. These men who are so\n   beautiful as Phoebus are always deceivers. But you need\n   not be the one deceived;--you with your money and your\n   beauty and your--what you call rank. No, I think not; and\n   I think that little girl must put up with it, as other\n   little girls have done, since the men first learned how to\n   tell lies. That is my advice, and if you will let me I can\n   give you good assistance.\n\n   Dearest Julie, think of all this, and do not banish your\n   Sophie. I am so true to you, that I cannot live without\n   you. Send me back one word of permission, and I will come\n   to you, and kneel at your feet. And in the meantime, I am\n\n   Your most devoted friend,\n\n   SOPHIE.\n\n\nLady Ongar, on the receipt of this letter, was not at all changed in\nher purpose with reference to Madame Gordeloup. She knew well enough\nwhere her Sophie's heart was placed, and would yield to no further\npressure from that quarter; but Sophie's reasoning, nevertheless, had\nits effect. She, Lady Ongar, with her youth, her beauty, her wealth,\nand her rank, why should she not have that one thing which alone\ncould make her happy, seeing, as she did see, or as she thought she\nsaw, that in making herself happy she could do so much, could confer\nsuch great blessings on him she loved? She had already found that the\nmoney she had received as the price of herself had done very little\ntowards making her happy in her present state. What good was it to\nher that she had a carriage and horses and two footmen six feet high?\nOne pleasant word from lips that she could love,--from the lips of\nman or woman that she could esteem,--would be worth it all. She had\ngone down to her pleasant place in the country,--a place so pleasant\nthat it had a fame of its own among the luxuriantly pleasant seats of\nthe English country gentry; she had gone there, expecting to be happy\nin the mere feeling that it was all her own; and the whole thing had\nbeen to her so unutterably sad, so wretched in the severity of its\ndesolation, that she had been unable to endure her life amidst the\nshade of her own trees. All her apples hitherto had turned to ashes\nbetween her teeth, because her fate had forced her to attempt the\neating of them alone. But if she could give the fruit to him,--if she\ncould make the apples over, so that they should all be his, and not\nhers, then would there not come to her some of the sweetness of the\njuice of them?\n\nShe declared to herself that she would not tempt this man to be\nuntrue to his troth, were it not that in doing so she would so\ngreatly benefit himself. Was it not manifest that Harry Clavering was\na gentleman, qualified to shine among men of rank and fashion, but\nnot qualified to make his way by his own diligence? In saying this of\nhim, she did not know how heavy was the accusation that she brought\nagainst him; but what woman, within her own breast, accuses the\nman she loves? Were he to marry Florence Burton, would he not ruin\nhimself, and probably ruin her also? But she could give him all that\nhe wanted. Though Ongar Park to her alone was, with its rich pastures\nand spreading oaks and lowing cattle, desolate as the Dead Sea shore,\nfor him,--and for her with him,--would it not be the very paradise\nsuited to them? Would it not be the heaven in which such a Phoebus\nshould shine amidst the gyrations of his satellites? A Phoebus\ngoing about his own field in knickerbockers, and with attendant\nsatellites, would possess a divinity which, as she thought, might\nmake her happy. As she thought of all this, and asked herself these\nquestions, there was an inner conscience which told her that she\nhad no right to Harry's love or Harry's hand; but still she could\nnot cease to long that good things might come to her, though those\ngood things had not been deserved. Alas, good things not deserved\ntoo often lose their goodness when they come! As she was sitting\nwith Sophie's letter in her hand the door was opened, and Captain\nClavering was announced.\n\nCaptain Archibald Clavering was again dressed in his very best, but\nhe did not even yet show by his demeanour that aptitude for the\nbusiness now in hand of which he had boasted on the previous evening\nto his friend. Lady Ongar, I think, partly guessed the object of\nhis visit. She had perceived, or perhaps had unconsciously felt, on\nthe occasion of his former coming, that the visit had not been made\nsimply from motives of civility. She had known Archie in old days,\nand was aware that the splendour of his vestments had a significance.\nWell, if anything of that kind was to be done, the sooner it was done\nthe better.\n\n\"Julia,\" he said, as soon as he was seated, \"I hope I have the\npleasure of seeing you quite well?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, I thank you,\" said she.\n\n\"You have been out of town, I think?\" She told him that she had been\nin the Isle of Wight for a day or two, and then there was a short\nsilence. \"When I heard that you were gone,\" he said, \"I feared that\nperhaps you were ill!\"\n\n\"O dear, no; nothing of that sort.\"\n\n\"I am so glad,\" said Archie; and then he was silent again. He had,\nhowever, as he was aware, thrown a great deal of expression into his\ninquiries after her health, and he had now to calculate how he could\nbest use the standing-ground that he had made for himself.\n\n\"Have you seen my sister lately?\" she asked.\n\n\"Your sister? no. She is always at Clavering. I think it doosed wrong\nof Hugh, the way he goes on, keeping her down there, while he is up\nhere in London. It isn't at all my idea of what a husband ought to\ndo.\"\n\n\"I suppose she likes it,\" said Lady Ongar.\n\n\"Oh, if she likes it, that's a different thing, of course,\" said\nArchie. Then there was another pause.\n\n\"Don't you find yourself rather lonely here sometimes?\" he asked.\n\nLady Ongar felt that it would be better for all parties that it\nshould be over, and that it would not be over soon unless she could\nhelp him. \"Very lonely indeed,\" she said; \"but then I suppose that it\nis the fate of widows to be lonely.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" said Archie, briskly; \"--unless they are\nold and ugly, and that kind of thing. When a widow has become a widow\nafter she has been married ever so many years, why then I suppose she\nlooks to be left alone; and I suppose they like it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I can't say. I don't like it.\"\n\n\"Then you would wish to change?\"\n\n\"It is a very intricate subject, Captain Clavering, and one which I\ndo not think I am quite disposed to discuss at present. After a year\nor two, perhaps I shall go into society again. Most widows do, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"But I was thinking of something else,\" said Archie, working himself\nup to the point with great energy, but still with many signs that he\nwas ill at ease at his work. \"I was, by Jove!\"\n\n\"And of what were you thinking, Captain Clavering?\"\n\n\"I was thinking,--of course you know, Julia, that since poor little\nHughy's death, I am the next in for the title?\"\n\n\"Poor Hughy! I'm sure you are too generous to rejoice at that.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am. When two fellows offered me a dinner at the club on the\nscore of my chances, I wouldn't have it. But there's the fact;--isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that, I believe.\"\n\n\"None on earth; and the most of it is entailed, too; not that Hugh\nwould leave an acre away from the title. I'm as safe as wax as far\nas that is concerned. I don't suppose he ever borrowed a shilling or\nmortgaged an acre in his life.\"\n\n\"I should think he was a prudent man.\"\n\n\"We are both of us prudent. I will say that of myself, though I\noughtn't to say it. And now, Julia,--a few words are the best after\nall. Look here,--if you'll take me just as I am, I'm blessed if I\nshan't be the happiest fellow in all London. I shall indeed. I've\nalways been uncommon fond of you, though I never said anything about\nit in the old days, because,--because you see, what's the use of a\nman asking a girl to marry him if they haven't got a farthing between\nthem. I think it's wrong; I do indeed; but it's different now, you\nknow.\" It certainly was very different now.\n\n\"Captain Clavering,\" she said, \"I'm sorry you should have troubled\nyourself with such an idea as this.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Julia. It's no trouble; it's a pleasure.\"\n\n\"But such a thing as you mean never can take place.\"\n\n\"Yes, it can. Why can't it? I ain't in a hurry. I'll wait your own\ntime, and do just whatever you wish all the while. Don't say no\nwithout thinking about it, Julia.\"\n\n\"It is one of those things, Captain Clavering, which want no more\nthinking than what a woman can give to it at the first moment.\"\n\n\"Ah,--you think so now, because you're surprised a little.\"\n\n\"Well; I am surprised a little, as our previous intercourse was never\nof a nature to make such a proposition as this at all probable.\"\n\n\"That was merely because I didn't think it right,\" said Archie, who,\nnow that he had worked himself into the vein, liked the sound of his\nown voice. \"It was indeed.\"\n\n\"And I don't think it right now. You must listen to me for a moment,\nCaptain Clavering--for fear of a mistake. Believe me, any such plan\nas this is quite out of the question;--quite.\" In uttering that last\nword she managed to use a tone of voice which did make an impression\non him. \"I never can, under any circumstances, become your wife. You\nmight as well look upon that as altogether decided, because it will\nsave us both annoyance.\"\n\n\"You needn't be so sure yet, Julia.\"\n\n\"Yes, I must be sure. And unless you will promise me to drop the\nmatter, I must,--to protect myself,--desire my servants not to admit\nyou into the house again. I shall be sorry to do that, and I think\nyou will save me from the necessity.\"\n\nHe did save her from that necessity, and before he went he gave her\nthe required promise. \"That's well,\" said she, tendering him her\nhand; \"and now we shall part friends.\"\n\n\"I shall like to be friends,\" said he, in a crestfallen voice, and\nwith that he took his leave. It was a great comfort to him that he\nhad the scheme of Jack Stuart's yacht and the trip to Norway for his\nimmediate consolation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nWHAT LADY ONGAR THOUGHT ABOUT IT.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nMrs. Burton, it may perhaps be remembered, had formed in her heart\na scheme of her own--a scheme of which she thought with much\ntrepidation, and in which she could not request her husband's\nassistance, knowing well that he would not only not assist it, but\nthat he would altogether disapprove of it. But yet she could not put\nit aside from her thoughts, believing that it might be the means of\nbringing Harry Clavering and Florence together. Her husband had now\nthoroughly condemned poor Harry, and had passed sentence against\nhim,--not indeed openly to Florence herself, but very often in\nthe hearing of his wife. Cecilia, womanlike, was more angry with\ncircumstances than with the offending man,--with circumstances and\nwith the woman who stood in Florence's way. She was perfectly willing\nto forgive Harry, if Harry could only be made to go right at last. He\nwas good-looking and pleasant, and had nice ways in a house, and was\naltogether too valuable as a lover to be lost without many struggles.\nSo she kept to her scheme, and at last she carried it into execution.\n\nShe started alone from her house one morning, and getting into an\nomnibus at Brompton had herself put down on the rising ground in\nPiccadilly, opposite to the Green Park. Why she had hesitated to tell\nthe omnibus-man to stop at Bolton Street can hardly be explained; but\nshe had felt that there would be almost a declaration of guilt in\nnaming that locality. So she got out on the little hill, and walked\nup in front of the Prime Minister's house,--as it was then,--and of\nthe yellow palace built by one of our merchant princes, and turned\ninto the street that was all but interdicted to her by her own\nconscience. She turned up Bolton Street, and with a trembling hand\nknocked at Lady Ongar's door.\n\nFlorence in the meantime was sitting alone in Onslow Terrace. She\nknew now that Harry was ill at Clavering,--that he was indeed very\nill, though Mrs. Clavering had assured her that his illness was not\ndangerous. For Mrs. Clavering had written to herself,--addressing\nher with all the old familiarity and affection,--with a warmth of\naffection that was almost more than natural. It was clear that Mrs.\nClavering knew nothing of Harry's sins. Or, might it not be possible,\nCecilia had suggested, that Mrs. Clavering might have known, and have\nresolved potentially that those sins should be banished, and become\nground for some beautifully sincere repentance? Ah, how sweet it\nwould be to receive that wicked sheep back again into the sheepfold,\nand then to dock him a little of his wandering powers, to fix him\nwith some pleasant clog, to tie him down as a prudent domestic sheep\nshould be tied, and make him the pride of the flock! But all this\nhad been part of Cecilia's scheme, and of that scheme poor Florence\nknew nothing. According to Florence's view Mrs. Clavering's letter\nwas written under a mistake. Harry had kept his secret at home,\nand intended to keep it for the present. But there was the letter,\nand Florence felt that it was impossible for her to answer it\nwithout telling the whole truth. It was very painful to her to leave\nunanswered so kind a letter as that, and it was quite impossible that\nshe should write of Harry in the old strain. \"It will be best that I\nshould tell her the whole,\" Florence had said, \"and then I shall be\nsaved the pain of any direct communication with him.\" Her brother, to\nwhom Cecilia had repeated this, applauded his sister's resolution.\n\"Let her face it and bear it, and live it down,\" he had said. \"Let\nher do it at once, so that all this maudlin sentimentality may be at\nan end.\" But Cecilia would not accede to this, and as Florence was\nin truth resolved, and had declared her purpose plainly, Cecilia\nwas driven to the execution of her scheme more quickly than she had\nintended. In the meantime, Florence took out her little desk and\nwrote her letter. In tears and an agony of spirit which none can\nunderstand but women who have been driven to do the same, was it\nwritten. Could she have allowed herself to express her thoughts with\npassion, it would have been comparatively easy; but it behoved her to\nbe calm, to be very quiet in her words,--almost reticent even in the\nlanguage which she chose, and to abandon her claim not only without a\nreproach, but almost without an allusion to her love. Whilst Cecilia\nwas away, the letter was written, and re-written and copied; but Mrs.\nBurton was safe in this, that her sister-in-law had promised that the\nletter should not be sent till she had seen it.\n\nMrs. Burton, when she knocked at Lady Ongar's door, had a little note\nready for the servant between her fingers. Her compliments to Lady\nOngar, and would Lady Ongar oblige her by an interview. The note\ncontained simply that, and nothing more; and when the servant took it\nfrom her, she declared her intention of waiting in the hall till she\nhad received an answer. But she was shown into the dining-room, and\nthere she remained for a quarter of an hour, during which time she\nwas by no means comfortable. Probably Lady Ongar might refuse to\nreceive her; but should that not be the case,--should she succeed in\nmaking her way into that lady's presence, how should she find the\neloquence wherewith to plead her cause? At the end of the fifteen\nminutes, Lady Ongar herself opened the door and entered the room.\n\"Mrs. Burton,\" she said, smiling, \"I am really ashamed to have kept\nyou so long; but open confession, they say, is good for the soul, and\nthe truth is that I was not dressed.\" Then she led the way upstairs,\nand placed Mrs. Burton on a sofa, and placed herself in her own\nchair,--from whence she could see well, but in which she could not\nbe well seen,--and stretched out the folds of her morning dress\ngracefully, and made her visitor thoroughly understand that she was\nat home and at her ease.\n\nWe may, I think, surmise that Lady Ongar's open confession would do\nher soul but little good, as it lacked truth, which is the first\nrequisite for all confessions. Lady Ongar had been sufficiently\ndressed to receive any visitor, but had felt that some special\npreparation was necessary for the reception of the one who had\nnow come to her. She knew well who was Mrs. Burton, and surmised\naccurately the purpose for which Mrs. Burton had come. Upon the\nmanner in which she now carried herself might hang the decision of\nthe question which was so important to her,--whether that Phoebus\nin knickerbockers should or should not become lord of Ongar Park.\nTo effect success now, she must maintain an ascendancy during this\ncoming interview, and in the maintenance of all ascendancy, much\ndepends on the outward man or woman; and she must think a little of\nthe words she must use, and a little, too, of her own purpose. She\nwas fully minded to get the better of Mrs. Burton if that might be\npossible, but she was not altogether decided on the other point. She\nwished that Harry Clavering might be her own. She would have wished\nto pension off that Florence Burton with half her wealth, had such\npensioning been possible. But not the less did she entertain some\nhalf doubts whether it would not be well that she could abandon her\nown wishes, and give up her own hope of happiness. Of Mrs. Burton\npersonally she had known nothing, and having expected to see a\nsomewhat strong-featured and perhaps rather vulgar woman, and to hear\na voice painfully indicative of a strong mind, she was agreeably\nsurprised to find a pretty, mild lady, who from the first showed that\nshe was half afraid of what she herself was doing. \"I have heard your\nname, Mrs. Burton,\" said Lady Ongar, \"from our mutual friend, Mr.\nClavering, and I have no doubt you have heard mine from him also.\"\nThis she said in accordance with the little plan which during those\nfifteen minutes she had laid down for her own guidance.\n\nMrs. Burton was surprised, and at first almost silenced, by this\nopen mentioning of a name which she had felt that she would have\nthe greatest difficulty in approaching. She said, however, that it\nwas so. She had heard Lady Ongar's name from Mr. Clavering. \"We are\nconnected, you know,\" said Lady Ongar. \"My sister is married to\nhis first-cousin, Sir Hugh; and when I was living with my sister\nat Clavering, he was at the rectory there. That was before my own\nmarriage.\" She was perfectly easy in her manner, and flattered\nherself that the ascendancy was complete.\n\n\"I have heard as much from Mr. Clavering,\" said Cecilia.\n\n\"And he was very civil to me immediately on my return home. Perhaps\nyou may have heard that also. He took this house for me, and made\nhimself generally useful, as young men ought to do. I believe he is\nin the same office with your husband; is he not? I hope I may not\nhave been the means of making him idle?\"\n\nThis was all very well and very pretty, but Mrs. Burton was already\nbeginning to feel that she was doing nothing towards the achievement\nof her purpose. \"I suppose he has been idle,\" she said, \"but I did\nnot mean to trouble you about that.\" Upon hearing this, Lady Ongar\nsmiled. This supposition that she had really intended to animadvert\nupon Harry Clavering's idleness was amusing to her as she remembered\nhow little such idleness would signify if she could only have her\nway.\n\n\"Poor Harry!\" she said. \"I supposed his sins would be laid at my\ndoor. But my idea is, you know, that he never will do any good at\nsuch work as that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not;--that is, I really can't say. I don't think Mr. Burton\nhas ever expressed any such opinion; and if he had--\"\n\n\"If he had, you wouldn't mention it.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose I should, Lady Ongar;--not to a stranger.\"\n\n\"Harry Clavering and I are not strangers,\" said Lady Ongar, changing\nthe tone of her voice altogether as she spoke.\n\n\"No; I know that. You have known him longer than we have. I am aware\nof that.\"\n\n\"Yes; before he ever dreamed of going into your husband's business,\nMrs. Burton; long before he had ever been to--Stratton.\"\n\nThe name of Stratton was an assistance to Cecilia, and seemed to\nhave been spoken with the view of enabling her to commence her work.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"but nevertheless he did go to Stratton. He went\nto Stratton, and there he became acquainted with my sister-in-law,\nFlorence Burton.\"\n\n\"I am aware of it, Mrs. Burton.\"\n\n\"And he also became engaged to her.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that too. He has told me as much himself.\"\n\n\"And has he told you whether he means to keep, or to break that\nengagement?\"\n\n\"Ah, Mrs. Burton, is that question fair? Is it fair either to him, or\nto me? If he has taken me into his confidence and has not taken you,\nshould I be doing well to betray him? Or if there can be anything in\nsuch a secret specially interesting to myself, why should I be made\nto tell it to you?\"\n\n\"I think the truth is always the best, Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"Truth is always better than a lie;--so at least people say, though\nthey sometimes act differently; but silence may be better than\neither.\"\n\n\"This is a matter, Lady Ongar, in which I cannot be silent. I hope\nyou will not be angry with me for coming to you,--or for asking you\nthese questions--\"\n\n\"O dear, no.\"\n\n\"But I cannot be silent. My sister-in-law must at any rate know what\nis to be her fate.\"\n\n\"Then why do you not ask him?\"\n\n\"He is ill at present.\"\n\n\"Ill! Where is he ill? Who says he is ill?\" And Lady Ongar, though\nshe did not quite leave her chair, raised herself up and forgot all\nher preparations. \"Where is he, Mrs. Burton? I have not heard of his\nillness.\"\n\n\"He is at Clavering;--at the parsonage.\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing of this. What ails him? If he be really ill,\ndangerously ill, I conjure you to tell me. But pray tell me the\ntruth. Let there be no tricks in such a matter as this.\"\n\n\"Tricks, Lady Ongar!\"\n\n\"If Harry Clavering be ill, tell me what ails him. Is he in danger?\"\n\n\"His mother in writing to Florence says that he is not in danger; but\nthat he is confined to the house. He has been taken by some fever.\"\nOn that very morning Lady Ongar had received a letter from her\nsister, begging her to come to Clavering Park during the absence\nof Sir Hugh; but in the letter no word had been said as to Harry's\nillness. Had he been seriously, or at least dangerously ill, Hermione\nwould certainly have mentioned it. All this flashed across Julia's\nmind as these tidings about Harry reached her. If he were not really\nin danger, or even if he were, why should she betray her feeling\nbefore this woman? \"If there had been much in it,\" she said, resuming\nher former position and manners, \"I should no doubt have heard of it\nfrom my sister.\"\n\n\"We hear that it is not dangerous,\" continued Mrs. Burton; \"but he is\naway, and we cannot see him. And, in truth, Lady Ongar, we cannot see\nhim any more until we know that he means to deal honestly by us.\"\n\n\"Am I the keeper of his honesty?\"\n\n\"From what I have heard, I think you are. If you will tell me\nthat I have heard falsely, I will go away and beg your pardon for\nmy intrusion. But if what I have heard be true, you must not be\nsurprised that I show this anxiety for the happiness of my sister. If\nyou knew her, Lady Ongar, you would know that she is too good to be\nthrown aside with indifference.\"\n\n\"Harry Clavering tells me that she is an angel,--that she is\nperfect.\"\n\n\"And if he loves her, will it not be a shame that they should be\nparted?\"\n\n\"I said nothing about his loving her. Men are not always fond of\nperfection. The angels may be too angelic for this world.\"\n\n\"He did love her.\"\n\n\"So I suppose;--or at any rate he thought that he did.\"\n\n\"He did love her, and I believe he loves her still.\"\n\n\"He has my leave to do so, Mrs. Burton.\"\n\nCecilia, though she was somewhat afraid of the task which she had\nundertaken, and was partly awed by Lady Ongar's style of beauty and\ndemeanour, nevertheless felt that if she still hoped to do any good,\nshe must speak the truth out at once. She must ask Lady Ongar whether\nshe held herself to be engaged to Harry Clavering. If she did not do\nthis, nothing could come of the present interview.\n\n\"You say that, Lady Ongar, but do you mean it?\" she asked. \"We have\nbeen told that you also are engaged to marry Mr. Clavering.\"\n\n\"Who has told you so?\"\n\n\"We have heard it. I have heard it, and have been obliged to tell my\nsister that I had done so.\"\n\n\"And who told you? Did you hear it from Harry Clavering himself?\"\n\n\"I did. I heard it in part from him.\"\n\n\"Then why have you come beyond him to me? He must know. If he has\ntold you that he is engaged to marry me, he must also have told you\nthat he does not intend to marry Miss Florence Burton. It is not for\nme to defend him or to accuse him. Why do you come to me?\"\n\n\"For mercy and forbearance,\" said Mrs. Burton, rising from her seat\nand coming over to the side of the room in which Lady Ongar was\nseated.\n\n\n[Illustration: A plea for mercy.]\n\n\n\"And Miss Burton has sent you?\"\n\n\"No; she does not know that I am here; nor does my husband know it.\nNo one knows it. I have come to tell you that before God this man is\nengaged to become the husband of Florence Burton. She has learned to\nlove him, and has now no other chance of happiness.\"\n\n\"But what of his happiness?\"\n\n\"Yes; we are bound to think of that. Florence is bound to think of\nthat above all things.\"\n\n\"And so am I. I love him too;--as fondly, perhaps, as she can do. I\nloved him first, before she had even heard his name.\"\n\n\"But, Lady Ongar--\"\n\n\"Yes; you may ask the question if you will, and I will answer it\ntruly.\" They were both standing now and confronting each other. \"Or\nI will answer it without your asking it. I was false to him. I would\nnot marry him because he was poor; and then I married another because\nhe was rich. All that is true. But it does not make me love him the\nless now. I have loved him through it all. Yes; you are shocked, but\nit is true. I have loved him through it all. And what am I to do now,\nif he still loves me? I can give him wealth now.\"\n\n\"Wealth will not make him happy.\"\n\n\"It has not made me happy; but it may help to do so with him. But\nwith me at any rate there can be no doubt. It is his happiness to\nwhich I am bound to look. Mrs. Burton, if I thought that I could make\nhim happy, and if he would come to me, I would marry him to-morrow,\nthough I broke your sister's heart by doing so. But if I felt that\nshe could do so more than I, I would leave him to her, though I broke\nmy own. I have spoken to you very openly. Will she say as much as\nthat?\"\n\n\"She would act in that way. I do not know what she would say.\"\n\n\"Then let her do so, and leave him to be the judge of his own\nhappiness. Let her pledge herself that no reproaches shall come\nfrom her, and I will pledge myself equally. It was I who loved him\nfirst, and it is I who have brought him into this trouble. I owe him\neverything. Had I been true to him, he would never have thought of,\nnever have seen, Miss Florence Burton.\"\n\nAll that was, no doubt, true, but it did not touch the question of\nFlorence's right. The fact on which Mrs. Burton wished to insist, if\nonly she knew how, was this, that Florence had not sinned at all, and\nthat Florence therefore ought not to bear any part of the punishment.\nIt might be very true that Harry's fault was to be excused in part\nbecause of Lady Ongar's greater and primary fault;--but why should\nFlorence be the scapegoat?\n\n\"You should think of his honour as well as his happiness,\" said Mrs.\nBurton at last.\n\n\"That is rather severe, Mrs. Burton, considering that it is said\nto me in my own house. Am I so low as that, that his honour will\nbe tarnished if I become his wife?\" But she, in saying this, was\nthinking of things of which Mrs. Burton knew nothing.\n\n\"His honour will be tarnished,\" said she, \"if he do not marry her\nwhom he has promised to marry. He was welcomed by her father and\nmother to their house, and then he made himself master of her heart.\nBut it was not his till he had asked for it, and had offered his own\nand his hand in return for it. Is he not bound to keep his promise?\nHe cannot be bound to you after any such fashion as that. If you are\nsolicitous for his welfare, you should know that if he would live\nwith the reputation of a gentleman, there is only one course open to\nhim.\"\n\n\"It is the old story,\" said Lady Ongar; \"the old story! Has not\nsomebody said that the gods laugh at the perjuries of lovers? I do\nnot know that men are inclined to be much more severe than the gods.\nThese broken hearts are what women are doomed to bear.\"\n\n\"And that is to be your answer to me, Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"No; that is not my answer to you. That is the excuse that I make for\nHarry Clavering. My answer to you has been very explicit. Pardon me\nif I say that it has been more explicit than you had any right to\nexpect. I have told you that I am prepared to take any step that may\nbe most conducive to the happiness of the man whom I once injured,\nbut whom I have always loved. I will do this, let it cost myself what\nit may; and I will do this let the cost to any other woman be what\nit may. You cannot expect that I should love another woman better\nthan myself.\" She said this, still standing, not without something\nmore than vehemence in her tone. In her voice, in her manner, and\nin her eye there was that which amounted almost to ferocity. She\nwas declaring that some sacrifice must be made, and that she recked\nlittle whether it should be of herself or of another. As she would\nimmolate herself without hesitation, if the necessity should exist,\nso would she see Florence Burton destroyed without a twinge of\nremorse, if the destruction of Florence would serve the purpose\nwhich she had in view. You and I, O reader, may feel that the man\nfor whom all this was to be done was not worth the passion. He had\nproved himself to be very far from such worth. But the passion,\nnevertheless, was there, and the woman was honest in what she was\nsaying.\n\nAfter this Mrs. Burton got herself out of the room as soon as she\nfound an opening which allowed her to go. In making her farewell\nspeech, she muttered some indistinct apology for the visit which she\nhad been bold enough to make. \"Not at all,\" said Lady Ongar. \"You\nhave been quite right;--you are fighting your battle for the friend\nyou love bravely; and were it not that the cause of the battle must,\nI fear, separate us hereafter, I should be proud to know one who\nfights so well for her friends. And when all this is over and has\nbeen settled, in whatever way it may be settled, let Miss Burton know\nfrom me that I have been taught to hold her name and character in\nthe highest possible esteem.\" Mrs. Burton made no attempt at further\nspeech, but left the room with a low curtsey.\n\nTill she found herself out in the street, she was unable to think\nwhether she had done most harm or most good by her visit to Bolton\nStreet,--whether she had in any way served Florence, or whether she\nhad simply confessed to Florence's rival the extent of her sister's\nmisery. That Florence herself would feel the latter to be the case,\nwhen she should know it all, Mrs. Burton was well aware. Her own\nears had tingled with shame as Harry Clavering had been discussed\nas a grand prize for which her sister was contending with another\nwoman,--and contending with so small a chance of success. It was\nterrible to her that any woman dear to her should seem to seek for a\nman's love. And the audacity with which Lady Ongar had proclaimed her\nown feelings had been terrible also to Cecilia. She was aware that\nshe was meddling with things which were foreign to her nature, and\nwhich would be odious to her husband. But yet, was not the battle\nworth fighting? It was not to be endured that Florence should seek\nafter this thing; but, after all, the possession of the thing in\nquestion was the only earthly good that could give any comfort to\npoor Florence. Even Cecilia, with all her partiality for Harry,\nfelt that he was not worth the struggle; but it was for her now to\nestimate him at the price which Florence might put upon him,--not at\nher own price.\n\nBut she must tell Florence what had been done, and tell her on that\nvery day of her meeting with Lady Ongar. In no other way could she\nstop that letter which she knew that Florence would have already\nwritten to Mrs. Clavering. And could she now tell Florence that there\nwas ground for hope? Was it not the fact that Lady Ongar had spoken\nthe simple and plain truth when she had said that Harry must be\nallowed to choose the course which appeared to him to be the best for\nhim? It was hard, very hard, that it should be so. And was it not\ntrue also that men, as well as gods, excuse the perjuries of lovers?\nShe wanted to have back Harry among them as one to be forgiven\neasily, to be petted much, and to be loved always; but, in spite\nof the softness of her woman's nature, she wished that he might be\npunished sorely if he did not so return. It was grievous to her that\nhe should any longer have a choice in the matter. Heavens and earth!\nwas he to be allowed to treat a woman as he had treated Florence, and\nwas nothing to come of it? In spite both of gods and men, the thing\nwas so grievous to Cecilia Burton, that she could not bring herself\nto acknowledge that it was possible. Such things had not been done in\nthe world which she had known.\n\nShe walked the whole way home to Brompton, and had hardly perfected\nany plan when she reached her own door. If only Florence would allow\nher to write the letter to Mrs. Clavering, perhaps something might be\ndone in that way. So she entered the house prepared to tell the story\nof her morning's work.\n\nAnd she must tell it also to her husband in the evening! It had been\nhard to do the thing without his knowing of it beforehand; but it\nwould be impossible to her to keep the thing a secret from him, now\nthat it was done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nHOW TO DISPOSE OF A WIFE.\n\n\nWhen Sir Hugh came up to town there did not remain to him quite a\nweek before the day on which he was to leave the coast of Essex in\nJack Stuart's yacht for Norway, and he had a good deal to do in the\nmeantime in the way of provisioning the boat. Fortnum and Mason, no\ndoubt, would have done it all for him without any trouble on his\npart, but he was not a man to trust any Fortnum or any Mason as to\nthe excellence of the article to be supplied, or as to the price. He\ndesired to have good wine,--very good wine; but he did not desire to\npay a very high price. No one knew better than Sir Hugh that good\nwine cannot be bought cheap,--but things may be costly and yet not\ndear; or they may be both. To such matters Sir Hugh was wont to pay\nvery close attention himself. He had done something in that line\nbefore he left London, and immediately on his return he went to the\nwork again, summoning Archie to his assistance, but never asking\nArchie's opinion,--as though Archie had been his head-butler.\n\nImmediately on his arrival in London he cross-questioned his brother\nas to his marriage prospects. \"I suppose you are going with us?\" Hugh\nsaid to Archie, as he caught him in the hall of the house in Berkeley\nSquare on the morning after his arrival.\n\n\"O dear, yes,\" said Archie. \"I thought that was quite understood.\nI have been getting my traps together.\" The getting of his traps\ntogether had consisted in the ordering of a sailor's jacket with\nbrass buttons, and three pair of white duck trousers.\n\n\"All right,\" said Sir Hugh. \"You had better come with me into the\nCity this morning. I am going to Boxall's in Great Thames Street.\"\n\n\"Are you going to breakfast here?\" asked Archie.\n\n\"No; you can come to me at the Union in about an hour. I suppose you\nhave never plucked up courage to ask Julia to marry you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Archie.\n\n\"And what answer did you get?\" Archie had found himself obliged to\nrepudiate with alacrity the attack upon his courage which his brother\nhad so plainly made; but, beyond that, the subject was one which\nwas not pleasing to him. \"Well, what did she say to you?\" asked his\nbrother, who had no idea of sparing Archie's feelings in such a\nmatter.\n\n\"She said;--indeed I don't remember exactly what it was that she did\nsay.\"\n\n\"But she refused you?\"\n\n\"Yes;--she refused me. I think she wanted me to understand that I had\ncome to her too soon after Ongar's death.\"\n\n\"Then she must be an infernal hypocrite;--that's all.\" But of any\nhypocrisy in this matter the reader will acquit Lady Ongar, and will\nunderstand that Archie had merely lessened the severity of his own\nfall by a clever excuse. After that the two brothers went to Boxall's\nin the City, and Archie, having been kept fagging all day, was sent\nin the evening to dine by himself at his own club.\n\nSir Hugh also was desirous of seeing Lady Ongar, and had caused his\nwife to say as much in that letter which she wrote to her sister. In\nthis way an appointment had been made without any direct intercourse\nbetween Sir Hugh and his sister-in-law. They two had never met since\nthe day on which Sir Hugh had given her away in Clavering Church.\nTo Hugh Clavering, who was by no means a man of sentiment, this\nsignified little or nothing. When Lady Ongar had returned a widow,\nand when evil stories against her had been rife, he had thought it\nexpedient to have nothing to do with her. He did not himself care\nmuch about his sister-in-law's morals; but should his wife become\nmuch complicated with a sister damaged in character there might come\nof it trouble and annoyance. Therefore, he had resolved that Lady\nOngar should be dropped. But during the last few months things had\nin some respects changed. The Courton people,--that is to say, Lord\nOngar's family,--had given Hugh Clavering to understand that, having\nmade inquiry, they were disposed to acquit Lady Ongar, and to declare\ntheir belief that she was subject to no censure. They did not wish\nthemselves to know her, as no intimacy between them could now be\npleasant; but they had felt it to be incumbent on them to say as much\nas that to Sir Hugh. Sir Hugh had not even told his wife, but he had\ntwice suggested that Lady Ongar should be asked to Clavering Park. In\nanswer to both these invitations, Lady Ongar had declined to go to\nClavering Park.\n\nAnd now Sir Hugh had a commission on his hands from the same Courton\npeople, which made it necessary that he should see his sister-in-law,\nand Julia had agreed to receive him. To him, who was very hard in\nsuch matters, the idea of his visit was not made disagreeable by any\nremembrance of his own harshness to the woman whom he was going to\nsee. He cared nothing about that, and it had not occurred to him that\nshe would care much. But, in truth, she did care very much, and when\nthe hour was coming on which Sir Hugh was to appear, she thought\nmuch of the manner in which it would become her to receive him.\nHe had condemned her in that matter as to which any condemnation\nis an insult to a woman; and he had so condemned her, being her\nbrother-in-law and her only natural male friend. In her sorrow she\nshould have been able to lean upon him; but from the first, without\nany inquiry, he had believed the worst of her, and had withdrawn from\nher altogether his support, when the slightest support from him would\nhave been invaluable to her. Could she forgive this? Never; never!\nShe was not a woman to wish to forgive such an offence. It was an\noffence which it would be despicable in her to forgive. Many had\noffended her, some had injured her, one or two had insulted her; but\nto her thinking, no one had so offended her, had so injured her, had\nso grossly insulted her, as he had done. In what way then would it\nbecome her to receive him? Before his arrival she had made up her\nmind on this subject, and had resolved that she would, at least, say\nno word of her own wrongs.\n\n\"How do you do, Julia?\" said Sir Hugh, walking into the room with a\nstep which was perhaps unnaturally quick, and with his hand extended.\nLady Ongar had thought of that too. She would give much to escape\nthe touch of his hand, if it were possible; but she had told herself\nthat she would best consult her own dignity by declaring no actual\nquarrel. So she put out her fingers and just touched his palm.\n\n\"I hope Hermy is well?\" she said.\n\n\"Pretty well, thank you. She is rather lonely since she lost her poor\nlittle boy, and would be very glad if you would go to her.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that; but if she would come to me I should be\ndelighted.\"\n\n\"You see it would not suit her to be in London so soon after Hughy's\ndeath.\"\n\n\"I am not bound to London. I would go anywhere else,--except to\nClavering.\"\n\n\"You never go to Ongar Park, I am told.\"\n\n\"I have been there.\"\n\n\"But they say you do not intend to go again.\"\n\n\"Not at present, certainly. Indeed, I do not suppose I shall ever go\nthere. I do not like the place.\"\n\n\"That's just what they have told me. It is about that--partly--that I\nwant to speak to you. If you don't like the place, why shouldn't you\nsell your interest in it back to the family? They'd give you more\nthan the value for it.\"\n\n\"I do not know that I should care to sell it.\"\n\n\"Why not, if you don't mean to use the house? I might as well\nexplain at once what it is that has been said to me. John Courton,\nyou know, is acting as guardian for the young earl, and they don't\nwant to keep up so large a place as the Castle. Ongar Park would just\nsuit Mrs. Courton,\"--Mrs. Courton was the widowed mother of the young\nearl,--\"and they would be very happy to buy your interest.\"\n\n\"Would not such a proposition come best through a lawyer?\" said Lady\nOngar.\n\n\"The fact is this,--they think they have been a little hard on you.\"\n\n\"I have never accused them.\"\n\n\"But they feel it themselves, and they think that you might take it\nperhaps amiss if they were to send you a simple message through an\nattorney. Courton told me that he would not have allowed any such\nproposition to be made, if you had seemed disposed to use the place.\nThey wish to be civil, and all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Their civility or incivility is indifferent to me,\" said Julia.\n\n\"But why shouldn't you take the money?\"\n\n\"The money is equally indifferent to me.\"\n\n\"You mean then to say that you won't listen to it? Of course they\ncan't make you part with the place if you wish to keep it.\"\n\n\"Not more than they can make you sell Clavering Park. I do not,\nhowever, wish to be uncivil, and I will let you know through my\nlawyer what I think about it. All such matters are best managed by\nlawyers.\"\n\nAfter that Sir Hugh said nothing further about Ongar Park. He was\nwell aware, from the tone in which Lady Ongar answered him, that she\nwas averse to talk to him on that subject; but he was not conscious\nthat his presence was otherwise disagreeable to her, or that she\nwould resent any interference from him on any subject because he\nhad been cruel to her. So after a little while he began again about\nHermione. As the world had determined upon acquitting Lady Ongar,\nit would be convenient to him that the two sisters should be again\nintimate, especially as Julia was a rich woman. His wife did not like\nClavering Park, and he certainly did not like Clavering Park himself.\nIf he could once get the house shut up, he might manage to keep it\nshut for some years to come. His wife was now no more than a burden\nto him, and it would suit him well to put off the burden on to his\nsister-in-law's shoulders. It was not that he intended to have his\nwife altogether dependent on another person, but he thought that if\nthey two were established together, in the first instance merely as\na summer arrangement, such establishment might be made to assume\nsome permanence. This would be very pleasant to him. Of course he\nwould pay a portion of the expense,--as small a portion as might be\npossible,--but such a portion as might enable him to live with credit\nbefore the world.\n\n\"I wish I could think that you and Hermy might be together while I am\nabsent,\" he said.\n\n\"I shall be very happy to have her if she will come to me,\" Julia\nreplied.\n\n\"What,--here, in London? I am not quite sure that she wishes to come\nup to London at present.\"\n\n\"I have never understood that she had any objection to being in\ntown,\" said Lady Ongar.\n\n\"Not formerly, certainly; but now, since her boy's death--\"\n\n\"Why should his death make more difference to her than to you?\"\nTo this question Sir Hugh made no reply. \"If you are thinking of\nsociety, she could be nowhere safer from any such necessity than with\nme. I never go out anywhere. I have never dined out, or even spent an\nevening in company since Lord Ongar's death. And no one would come\nhere to disturb her.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"I don't quite know what you did mean. From different causes she and\nI are left pretty nearly equally without friends.\"\n\n\"Hermione is not left without friends,\" said Sir Hugh with a tone of\noffence.\n\n\"Were she not, she would not want to come to me. Your society is\nin London, to which she does not come, or in other country-houses\nthan your own, to which she is not taken. She lives altogether at\nClavering, and there is no one there, except your uncle.\"\n\n\"Whatever neighbourhood there is she has,--just like other women.\"\n\n\"Just like some other women, no doubt. I shall remain in town for\nanother month, and after that I shall go somewhere; I don't much care\nwhere. If Hermy will come to me as my guest I shall be most happy\nto have her. And the longer she will stay with me the better. Your\ncoming home need make no difference, I suppose.\"\n\nThere was a keenness of reproach in her tone as she spoke, which even\nhe could not but feel and acknowledge. He was very thick-skinned\nto such reproaches, and would have left this unnoticed had it been\npossible. Had she continued speaking he would have done so. But she\nremained silent, and sat looking at him, saying with her eyes the\nsame thing that she had already spoken with her words. Thus he was\ndriven to speak. \"I don't know,\" said he, \"whether you intend that\nfor a sneer.\"\n\nShe was perfectly indifferent whether or no she offended him. Only\nthat she had believed that the maintenance of her own dignity forbade\nit, she would have openly rebuked him, and told him that he was not\nwelcome in her house. No treatment from her could, as she thought,\nbe worse than he had deserved from her. His first enmity had injured\nher, but she could afford to laugh at his present anger. \"It is hard\nto talk to you about Hermy without what you are pleased to call a\nsneer. You simply wish to rid yourself of her.\"\n\n\"I wish no such thing, and you have no right to say so.\"\n\n\"At any rate you are ridding yourself of her society; and if under\nthose circumstances she likes to come to me I shall be glad to\nreceive her. Our life together will not be very cheerful, but neither\nshe nor I ought to expect a cheerful life.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair now with a cloud of anger upon his brow. \"I\ncan see how it is,\" said he; \"because everything has not gone smooth\nwith yourself you choose to resent it upon me. I might have expected\nthat you would not have forgotten in whose house you met Lord Ongar.\"\n\n\"No, Hugh; I forget nothing; neither when I met him, nor how I\nmarried him, nor any of the events that have happened since. My\nmemory, unfortunately, is very good.\"\n\n\"I did all I could for you, and should have been safe from your\ninsolence.\"\n\n\"You should have continued to stay away from me, and you would have\nbeen quite safe. But our quarrelling in this way is foolish. We can\nnever be friends,--you and I; but we need not be open enemies. Your\nwife is my sister, and I say again that if she likes to come to me,\nI shall be delighted to have her.\"\n\n\"My wife,\" said he, \"will go to the house of no person who is\ninsolent to me.\" Then he took his hat, and left the room without\nfurther word or sign of greeting. In spite of his calculations and\ncaution as to money,--in spite of his well-considered arrangements\nand the comfortable provision for his future ease which he had\nproposed to himself, he was a man who had not his temper so much\nunder control as to enable him to postpone his anger to his prudence.\nThat little scheme for getting rid of his wife was now at an end. He\nwould never permit her to go to her sister's house after the manner\nin which Julia had just treated him!\n\nWhen he was gone Lady Ongar walked about her own room smiling, and\nat first was well pleased with herself. She had received Archie's\noverture with decision, but at the same time with courtesy, for\nArchie was weak, and poor, and powerless. But she had treated Sir\nHugh with scorn, and had been enabled to do so without the utterance\nof any actual reproach as to the wrongs which she herself had endured\nfrom him. He had put himself in her power, and she had not thrown\naway the opportunity. She had told him that she did not want his\nfriendship, and would not be his friend; but she had done this\nwithout any loud abuse unbecoming to her either as a countess, a\nwidow, or a lady. For Hermione she was sorry. Hermione now could\nhardly come to her. But even as to that she did not despair. As\nthings were going on, it would become almost necessary that her\nsister and Sir Hugh should be parted. Both must wish it; and if this\nwere arranged, then Hermione should come to her.\n\nBut from this she soon came to think again about Harry Clavering. How\nwas that matter to be decided, and what steps would it become her to\ntake as to its decision? Sir Hugh had proposed to her that she should\nsell her interest in Ongar Park, and she had promised that she would\nmake known her decision on that matter through her lawyer. As she had\nbeen saying this she was well aware that she would never sell the\nproperty;--but she had already resolved that she would at once give\nit back, without purchase-money, to the Ongar family, were it not\nkept that she might hand it over to Harry Clavering as a fitting\nresidence for his lordship. If he might be there, looking after\nhis cattle, going about with the steward subservient at his heels,\nministering justice to the Enoch Gubbys and others, she would care\nnothing for the wants of any of the Courton people. But if such were\nnot to be the destiny of Ongar Park,--if there were to be no such\nAdam in that Eden,--then the mother of the little lord might take\nherself thither, and revel among the rich blessings of the place\nwithout delay, and with no difficulty as to price. As to price,;--had\nshe not already found the money-bag that had come to her to be too\nheavy for her hands?\n\nBut she could do nothing till that question was settled; and how was\nshe to settle it? Every word that had passed between her and Cecilia\nBurton had been turned over and over in her mind, and she could only\ndeclare to herself as she had then declared to her visitor, that it\nmust be as Harry should please. She would submit, if he required her\nsubmission; but she could not bring herself to take steps to secure\nher own misery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nFAREWELL TO DOODLES.\n\n\nAt last came the day on which the two Claverings were to go down\nto Harwich and put themselves on board Jack Stuart's yacht. The\nhall of the house in Berkeley Square was strewed with portmanteaus,\ngun-cases, and fishing-rods, whereas the wine and packets of\npreserved meat, and the bottled beer and fish in tins, and the large\nbox of cigars, and the prepared soups, had been sent down by Boxall,\nand were by this time on board the boat. Hugh and Archie were to\nleave London this day by train at 5 P.M., and were to sleep on board.\nJack Stuart was already there, having assisted in working the yacht\nround from Brightlingsea.\n\nOn that morning Archie had a farewell breakfast at his club with\nDoodles, and after that, having spent the intervening hours in the\nbilliard-room, a farewell luncheon. There had been something of\nmelancholy in this last day between the friends, originating partly\nin the failure of Archie's hopes as to Lady Ongar, and partly perhaps\nin the bad character which seemed to belong to Jack Stuart and his\ncraft. \"He has been at it for years, and always coming to grief,\"\nsaid Doodles. \"He is just like a man I know, who has been hunting\nfor the last ten years, and can't sit a horse at a fence yet. He has\nbroken every bone in his skin, and I don't suppose he ever saw a good\nthing to a finish. He never knows whether hounds are in cover, or\nwhere they are. His only idea is to follow another man's red coat\ntill he comes to grief;--and yet he will go on hunting. There are\nsome people who never will understand what they can do, and what\nthey can't.\" In answer to this, Archie reminded his friend that on\nthis occasion Jack Stuart would have the advantage of an excellent\ndry-nurse, acknowledged to be very great on such occasions. Would\nnot he, Archie Clavering, be there to pilot Jack Stuart and his\nboat? But, nevertheless, Doodles was melancholy, and went on telling\nstories about that unfortunate man who would continue to break his\nbones, though he had no aptitude for out-of-door sports. \"He'll be\ncarried home on a stretcher some day, you know,\" said Doodles.\n\n\"What does it matter if he is?\" said Archie, boldly, thinking of\nhimself and of the danger predicted for him. \"A man can only die\nonce.\"\n\n\"I call it quite a tempting of Providence,\" said Doodles.\n\nBut their conversation was chiefly about Lady Ongar and the Spy. It\nwas only on this day that Doodles had learned that Archie had in\ntruth offered his hand, and been rejected; and Captain Clavering was\nsurprised by the extent of his friend's sympathy. \"It's a doosed\ndisagreeable thing,--a very disagreeable thing indeed,\" said Doodles.\nArchie, who did not wish to be regarded as specially unfortunate,\ndeclined to look at the matter in this light; but Doodles insisted.\n\"It would cut me up like the very mischief,\" he said. \"I know that;\nand the worst of it is, that perhaps you wouldn't have gone on, only\nfor me. I meant it all for the best, old fellow. I did, indeed.\nThere; that's the game to you. I'm playing uncommon badly this\nmorning; but the truth is, I'm thinking of those women.\" Now as\nDoodles was playing for a little money, this was really civil on his\npart.\n\nAnd he would persevere in talking about the Spy, as though there\nwere something in his remembrance of the lady which attracted him\nirresistibly to the subject. He had always boasted that in his\ninterview with her he had come off with the victory, nor did he now\ncease to make such boasts; but still he spoke of her and her powers\nwith an awe which would have completely opened the eyes of any one a\nlittle more sharp on such matters than Archie Clavering. He was so\nintent on this subject that he sent the marker out of the room so\nthat he might discuss it with more freedom, and might plainly express\nhis views as to her influence on his friend's fate.\n\n\"By George! she's a wonderful woman. Do you know I can't help\nthinking of her at night. She keeps me awake;--she does, upon my\nhonour.\"\n\n\"I can't say she keeps me awake, but I wish I had my seventy pounds\nback again.\"\n\n\"Do you know, if I were you, I shouldn't grudge it. I should think it\nworth pretty nearly all the money to have had the dealing with her.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to go halves.\"\n\n\"Well, yes;--only that I ain't flush, I would. When one thinks of it,\nher absolutely taking the notes out of your waistcoat-pocket, upon my\nword it's beautiful! She'd have had it out of mine, if I hadn't been\ndoosed sharp.\"\n\n\"She understood what she was about, certainly.\"\n\n\"What I should like to know is this: did she or did she not tell Lady\nOngar what she was to do;--about you I mean? I daresay she did after\nall.\"\n\n\"And took my money for nothing?\"\n\n\"Because you didn't go high enough, you know.\"\n\n\"But that was your fault. I went as high as you told me.\"\n\n\"No, you didn't, Clavvy; not if you remember. But the fact is, I\ndon't suppose you could go high enough. I shouldn't be surprised if\nsuch a woman as that wanted--thousands! I shouldn't indeed. I shall\nnever forget the way in which she swore at me;--and how she abused me\nabout my family. I think she must have had some special reason for\ndisliking Warwickshire, she said such awful hard things about it.\"\n\n\"How did she know that you came from Warwickshire?\"\n\n\"She did know it. If I tell you something don't you say anything\nabout it. I have an idea about her.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I didn't mention it before, because I don't talk much of those sort\nof things. I don't pretend to understand them, and it is better to\nleave them alone.\"\n\n\"But what do you mean?\"\n\nDoodles looked very solemn as he answered. \"I think she's a\nmedium--or a media, or whatever it ought to be called.\"\n\n\"What! one of those spirit-rapping people?\" And Archie's hair almost\nstood on end as he asked the question.\n\n\"They don't rap now,--not the best of them, that is. That was the old\nway, and seems to have been given up.\"\n\n\"But what do you suppose she did?\"\n\n\"How did she know that the money was in your waistcoat-pocket, now?\nHow did she know that I came from Warwickshire? And then she had a\nway of going about the room as though she could have raised herself\noff her feet in a moment if she had chosen. And then her swearing,\nand the rest of it,--so unlike any other woman, you know.\"\n\n\"But do you think she could have made Julia hate me?\"\n\n\"Ah, I can't tell that. There are such lots of things going on\nnow-a-days that a fellow can understand nothing about! But I've no\ndoubt of this,--if you were to tie her up with ropes ever so, I don't\nin the least doubt but what she'd get out.\"\n\nArchie was awe-struck, and made two or three strokes after this; but\nthen he plucked up his courage and asked a question,--\n\n\"Where do you suppose they get it from, Doodles?\"\n\n\"That's just the question.\"\n\n\"Is it from--the devil, do you think?\" said Archie, whispering the\nname of the Evil One in a very low voice.\n\n\"Well, yes; I suppose that's most likely.\"\n\n\"Because they don't seem to do a great deal of harm with it after\nall. As for my money, she would have had that any way, for I intended\nto give it to her.\"\n\n\"There are people who think,\" said Doodles, \"that the spirits don't\ncome from anywhere, but are always floating about.\"\n\n\"And then one person catches them, and another doesn't?\" asked\nArchie.\n\n\"They tell me that it depends upon what the mediums or medias eat and\ndrink,\" said Doodles, \"and upon what sort of minds they have. They\nmust be cleverish people, I fancy, or the spirits wouldn't come to\nthem.\"\n\n\"But you never hear of any swell being a medium. Why don't the\nspirits go to a prime minister or some of those fellows? Only think\nwhat a help they'd be.\"\n\n\"If they come from the devil,\" suggested Doodles, \"he wouldn't let\nthem do any real good.\"\n\n\"I've heard a deal about them,\" said Archie, \"and it seems to me that\nthe mediums are always poor people, and that they come from nobody\nknows where. The Spy is a clever woman I daresay--\"\n\n\"There isn't much doubt about that,\" said the admiring Doodles.\n\n\"But you can't say she's respectable, you know. If I was a spirit I\nwouldn't go to a woman who wore such dirty stockings as she had on.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Clavvy. What does a spirit care about a woman's\nstockings?\"\n\n\"But why don't they ever go to the wise people? that's what I want\nto know.\" And as he asked the question boldly he struck his ball\nsharply, and, lo, the three balls rolled vanquished into three\ndifferent pockets. \"I don't believe about it,\" said Archie, as he\nreadjusted the score. \"The devil can't do such things as that or\nthere'd be an end of everything; and as to spirits in the air, why\nshould there be more spirits now than there were four-and-twenty\nyears ago?\"\n\n\"That's all very well, old fellow,\" said Doodles, \"but you and I\nain't clever enough to understand everything.\" Then that subject was\ndropped, and Doodles went back for a while to the perils of Jack\nStuart's yacht.\n\nAfter the lunch, which was in fact Archie's early dinner, Doodles\nwas going to leave his friend, but Archie insisted that his brother\ncaptain should walk with him up to Berkeley Square, and see the last\nof him into his cab. Doodles had suggested that Sir Hugh would be\nthere, and that Sir Hugh was not always disposed to welcome his\nbrother's friends to his own house after the most comfortable modes\nof friendship; but Archie explained that on such an occasion as this\nthere need be no fear on that head; he and his brother were going\naway together, and there was a certain feeling of jollity about the\ntrip which would divest Sir Hugh of his roughness. \"And besides,\"\nsaid Archie, \"as you will be there to see me off, he'll know that\nyou're not going to stay yourself.\" Convinced by this, Doodles\nconsented to walk up to Berkeley Square.\n\nSir Hugh had spent the greatest part of this day at home, immersed\namong his guns and rods, and their various appurtenances. He also had\nbreakfasted at his club, but had ordered his luncheon to be prepared\nfor him at home. He had arranged to leave Berkeley Square at four,\nand had directed that his lamb chops should be brought to him exactly\nat three. He was himself a little late in coming downstairs, and it\nwas ten minutes past the hour when he desired that the chops might be\nput on the table, saying that he himself would be in the drawing-room\nin time to meet them. He was a man solicitous about his lamb chops,\nand careful that the asparagus should be hot; solicitous also as\nto that bottle of Lafitte by which those comestibles were to be\naccompanied and which was, of its own nature, too good to be shared\nwith his brother Archie. But as he was on the landing, by the\ndrawing-room door, descending quickly, conscious that in obedience to\nhis orders the chops had been already served, he was met by a servant\nwho, with disturbed face and quick voice, told him that there was a\nlady waiting for him in the hall.\n\n\"D---- it!\" said Sir Hugh.\n\n\"She has just come, Sir Hugh, and says that she specially wants to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"Why the devil did you let her in?\"\n\n\"She walked in when the door was opened, Sir Hugh, and I couldn't\nhelp it. She seemed to be a lady, Sir Hugh, and I didn't like not to\nlet her inside the door.\"\n\n\"What's the lady's name?\" asked the master.\n\n\"It's a foreign name, Sir Hugh. She said she wouldn't keep you five\nminutes.\" The lamb chops, and the asparagus, and the Lafitte were in\nthe dining-room, and the only way to the dining-room lay through the\nhall to which the foreign lady had obtained an entrance. Sir Hugh,\nmaking such calculations as the moments allowed, determined that he\nwould face the enemy, and pass on to his banquet over her prostrate\nbody. He went quickly down into the hall, and there was encountered\nby Sophie Gordeloup, who, skipping over the gun-cases, and rushing\nthrough the portmanteaus, caught the baronet by the arm before he had\nbeen able to approach the dining-room door. \"Sir 'Oo,\" she said, \"I\nam so glad to have caught you. You are going away, and I have things\nto tell you which you must hear--yes; it is well for you I have\ncaught you, Sir 'Oo.\" Sir Hugh looked as though he by no means\nparticipated in this feeling, and saying something about his great\nhurry begged that he might be allowed to go to his food. Then he\nadded that, as far as his memory served him, he had not the honour of\nknowing the lady who was addressing him.\n\n\"You come in to your little dinner,\" said Sophie, \"and I will tell\nyou everything as you are eating. Don't mind me. You shall eat and\ndrink, and I will talk. I am Madame Gordeloup,--Sophie Gordeloup.\nAh,--you know the name now. Yes. That is me. Count Pateroff is my\nbrother. You know Count Pateroff? He knowed Lord Ongar, and I knowed\nLord Ongar. We know Lady Ongar. Ah,--you understand now that I can\nhave much to tell. It is well you was not gone without seeing me? Eh;\nyes! You shall eat and drink, but suppose you send that man into the\nkitchen!\"\n\nSir Hugh was so taken by surprise that he hardly knew how to act on\nthe spur of the moment. He certainly had heard of Madame Gordeloup,\nthough he had never before seen her. For years past her name had been\nfamiliar to him in London, and when Lady Ongar had returned as a\nwidow it had been, to his thinking, one of her worst offences that\nthis woman had been her friend. Under ordinary circumstances his\njudgment would have directed him to desire the servant to put her out\ninto the street as an impostor, and to send for the police if there\nwas any difficulty. But it certainly might be possible that this\nwoman had something to tell with reference to Lady Ongar which it\nwould suit his purposes to hear. At the present moment he was not\nvery well inclined to his sister-in-law, and was disposed to hear\nevil of her. So he passed on into the dining-room and desired Madame\nGordeloup to follow him. Then he closed the room door, and standing\nup with his back to the fireplace, so that he might be saved from the\nnecessity of asking her to sit down, he declared himself ready to\nhear anything that his visitor might have to say.\n\n\"But you will eat your dinner, Sir 'Oo? You will not mind me. I shall\nnot care.\"\n\n\"Thank you, no;--if you will just say what you have got to say, I\nwill be obliged to you.\"\n\n\"But the nice things will be so cold! Why should you mind me? Nobody\nminds me.\"\n\n\"I will wait, if you please, till you have done me the honour of\nleaving me.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,--you Englishmen are so cold and ceremonious. But Lord\nOngar was not with me like that. I knew Lord Ongar so well.\"\n\n\"Lord Ongar was more fortunate than I am.\"\n\n\"He was a poor man who did kill himself. Yes. It was always that\nbottle of Cognac. And there was other bottles was worser still. Never\nmind; he has gone now, and his widow has got the money. It is she\nhas been a fortunate woman! Sir 'Oo, I will sit down here in the\narm-chair.\" Sir Hugh made a motion with his hand, not daring to\nforbid her to do as she was minded. \"And you, Sir 'Oo;--will not you\nsit down also?\"\n\n\"I will continue to stand if you will allow me.\"\n\n\"Very well; you shall do as most pleases you. As I did walk here, and\nshall walk back, I will sit down.\"\n\n\"And now if you have anything to say, Madame Gordeloup,\" said Sir\nHugh, looking at the silver covers which were hiding the chops and\nthe asparagus, and looking also at his watch, \"perhaps you will be\ngood enough to say it.\"\n\n\"Anything to say! Yes, Sir 'Oo, I have something to say. It is a pity\nyou will not sit at your dinner.\"\n\n\"I will not sit at my dinner till you have left me. So now, if you\nwill be pleased to proceed--\"\n\n\"I will proceed. Perhaps you don't know that Lord Ongar died in these\narms?\" And Sophie, as she spoke, stretched out her skinny hands, and\nput herself as far as possible into the attitude in which it would be\nmost convenient to nurse the head of a dying man upon her bosom. Sir\nHugh, thinking to himself that Lord Ongar could hardly have received\nmuch consolation in his fate from this incident, declared that he had\nnot heard the fact before. \"No; you have not heard it. She have tell\nnothing to her friends here. He die abroad, and she has come back\nwith all the money; but she tell nothing to anybody here, so I must\ntell.\"\n\n\"But I don't care how he died, Madame Gordeloup. It is nothing to\nme.\"\n\n\"But yes, Sir 'Oo. The lady, your wife, is the sister to Lady Ongar.\nIs not that so? Lady Ongar did live with you before she was married.\nIs not that so? Your brother and your cousin both wishes to marry her\nand have all the money. Is not that so? Your brother has come to me\nto help him, and has sent the little man out of Warwickshire. Is not\nthat so?\"\n\n\"What the d---- is all that to me?\" said Sir Hugh, who did not quite\nunderstand the story as the lady was telling it.\n\n\"I will explain, Sir 'Oo, what the d---- it is to you; only I wish\nyou were eating the nice things on the table. This Lady Ongar is\ntreating me very bad. She treat my brother very bad too. My brother\nis Count Pateroff. We have been put to--oh, such expenses for her!\nIt have nearly ruined me. I make a journey to your London here\naltogether for her. Then, for her, I go down to that accursed little\nisland;--what you call it?--where she insult me. Oh! all my time\nis gone. Your brother and your cousin, and the little man out of\nWarwickshire, all coming to my house,--just as it please them.\"\n\n\"But what is this to me?\" shouted Sir Hugh.\n\n\"A great deal to you,\" screamed back Madame Gordeloup. \"You see I\nknow everything,--everything. I have got papers.\"\n\n\"What do I care for your papers? Look here, Madame Gordeloup, you had\nbetter go away.\"\n\n\"Not yet, Sir 'Oo; not yet. You are going away to Norway--I know; and\nI am ruined before you come back.\"\n\n\"Look here, madame; do you mean that you want money from me?\"\n\n\"I want my rights, Sir 'Oo. Remember, I know everything;--everything;\noh, such things! If they were all known,--in the newspapers, you\nunderstand, or that kind of thing, that lady in Bolton Street would\nlose all her money to-morrow. Yes. There is uncles to the little\nlord; yes! Ah, how much would they give me, I wonder? They would not\ntell me to go away.\"\n\nSophie was perhaps justified in the estimate she had made of Sir\nHugh's probable character from the knowledge which she had acquired\nof his brother Archie; but, nevertheless, she had fallen into a great\nmistake. There could hardly have been a man then in London less\nlikely to fall into her present views than Sir Hugh Clavering. Not\nonly was he too fond of his money to give it away without knowing why\nhe did so; but he was subject to none of that weakness by which some\nmen are prompted to submit to such extortions. Had he believed her\nstory, and had Lady Ongar been really dear to him, he would never\nhave dealt with such a one as Madame Gordeloup otherwise than through\nthe police.\n\n\"Madame Gordeloup,\" said he, \"if you don't immediately take yourself\noff, I shall have you put out of the house.\"\n\nHe would have sent for a constable at once, had he not feared that by\ndoing so, he would retard his journey.\n\n\"What!\" said Sophie, whose courage was as good as his own. \"Me put\nout of the house! Who shall touch me?\"\n\n\"My servant shall; or if that will not do, the police. Come, walk.\"\nAnd he stepped over towards her as though he himself intended to\nassist in her expulsion by violence.\n\n\"Well, you are there; I see you; and what next?\" said Sophie. \"You,\nand your valk! I can tell you things fit for you to know, and you\nsay, Valk. If I valk, I will valk to some purpose. I do not often\nvalk for nothing when I am told--Valk!\" Upon this, Sir Hugh rang the\nbell with some violence. \"I care nothing for your bells, or for your\nservants, or for your policemen. I have told you that your sister owe\nme a great deal of money, and you say,--Valk. I vill valk.\" Thereupon\nthe servant came into the room, and Sir Hugh, in an angry voice,\ndesired him to open the front door. \"Yes,--open vide,\" said Sophie,\nwho, when anger came upon her, was apt to drop into a mode of\nspeaking English which she was able to avoid in her cooler moments.\n\"Sir 'Oo, I am going to valk, and you shall hear of my valking.\"\n\n\"Am I to take that as a threat?\" said he.\n\n\"Not a tret at all,\" said she; \"only a promise. Ah, I am good to keep\nmy promises! Yes, I make a promise. Your poor wife,--down with the\ndaises; I know all, and she shall hear too. That is another promise.\nAnd your brother, the captain. Oh! here he is, and the little man\nout of Warwickshire.\" She had got up from her chair, and had moved\ntowards the door with the intention of going; but just as she was\npassing out into the hall, she encountered Archie and Doodles. Sir\nHugh, who had been altogether at a loss to understand what she had\nmeant by the man out of Warwickshire, followed her into the hall, and\nbecame more angry than before at finding that his brother had brought\na friend to his house at so very inopportune a moment. The wrath in\nhis face was so plainly expressed that Doodles could perceive it, and\nwished himself away. The presence also of the Spy was not pleasant\nto the gallant captain. Was the wonderful woman ubiquitous, that\nhe should thus encounter her again, and that so soon after all the\nthings that he had spoken of her on this morning? \"How do you do,\ngentlemen?\" said Sophie. \"There is a great many boxes here, and I\nwith my crinoline have not got room.\" Then she shook hands, first\nwith Archie, and then with Doodles; and asked the latter why he\nwas not as yet gone to Warwickshire. Archie, in almost mortal fear,\nlooked up into his brother's face. Had his brother learned the story\nof that seventy pounds? Sir Hugh was puzzled beyond measure at\nfinding that the woman knew the two men; but having still an eye to\nhis lamb chops, was chiefly anxious to get rid of Sophie and Doodles\ntogether.\n\n\"This is my friend Boodle,--Captain Boodle,\" said Archie, trying to\nput a bold face upon the crisis. \"He has come to see me off.\"\n\n\"Very kind of him,\" said Sir Hugh. \"Just make way for this lady, will\nyou? I want to get her out of the house if I can. Your friend seems\nto know her; perhaps he'll be good enough to give her his arm.\"\n\n\"Who;--I?\" said Doodles. \"No; I don't know her particularly. I did\nmeet her once before, just once,--in a casual way.\"\n\n\"Captain Booddle and me is very good friends,\" said Sophie. \"He come\nto my house and behave himself very well; only he is not so handy a\nman as your brother, Sir 'Oo.\"\n\nArchie trembled, and he trembled still more when his brother, turning\nto him, asked him if he knew the woman.\n\n\"Yes; he know the woman very well,\" said Sophie. \"Why do you not\ncome any more to see me? You send your little friend; but I like you\nbetter yourself. You come again when you return, and all that shall\nbe made right.\"\n\nBut still she did not go. She had now seated herself on a gun-case\nwhich was resting on a portmanteau, and seemed to be at her ease. The\ntime was going fast, and Sir Hugh, if he meant to eat his chops, must\neat them at once.\n\n\"See her out of the hall, into the street,\" he said to Archie; \"and\nif she gives trouble, send for the police. She has come here to get\nmoney from me by threats, and only that we have no time, I would have\nher taken to the lock-up house at once.\" Then Sir Hugh retreated into\nthe dining-room and shut the door.\n\n\"Lock-up-ouse!\" said Sophie, scornfully. \"What is dat?\"\n\n\"He means a prison,\" said Doodles.\n\n\"Prison! I know who is most likely be in a prison. Tell me of a\nprison! Is he a minister of state that he can send out order for me\nto be made prisoner? Is there lettres de cachet now in England? I\nthink not. Prison, indeed!\"\n\n\"But really, Madame Gordeloup, you had better go; you had, indeed,\"\nsaid Archie.\n\n\"You, too--you bid me go? Did I bid you go when you came to me? Did I\nnot tell you, sit down? Was I not polite? Did I send for a police? or\ntalk of lock-up-ouse to you? No. It is English that do these things;\nonly English.\"\n\nArchie felt that it was incumbent on him to explain that his visit\nto her house had been made under other circumstances,--that he had\nbrought money instead of seeking it; and had, in fact, gone to her\nsimply in the way of her own trade. He did begin some preliminaries\nto this explanation; but as the servant was there, and as his brother\nmight come out from the dining-room,--and as also he was aware that\nhe could hardly tell the story much to his own advantage, he stopped\nabruptly, and, looking piteously at Doodles, implored him to take the\nlady away.\n\n\"Perhaps you wouldn't mind just seeing her into Mount Street,\" said\nArchie.\n\n\"Who; I?\" said Doodles, electrified.\n\n\"It is only just round the corner,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Yes, Captain Booddle, we will go,\" said Sophie. \"This is a bad\nhouse; and your Sir 'Oo,--I do not like him at all. Lock-up, indeed!\nI tell you he shall very soon be locked up himself. There is what you\ncall Davy's locker. I know;--yes.\"\n\nDoodles also trembled when he heard this anathema, and thought once\nmore of the character of Jack Stuart and his yacht.\n\n\"Pray go with her,\" said Archie.\n\n\"But I had come to see you off.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Archie. \"He is in such a taking, you know. God\nbless you, old fellow; good-by! I'll write and tell you what fish we\nget, and mind you tell me what Turriper does for the Bedfordshire.\nGood-by, Madame Gordeloup--good-by.\"\n\nThere was no escape for him, so Doodles put on his hat and prepared\nto walk away to Mount Street with the Spy under his arm,--the Spy\nas to whose avocations, over and beyond those of her diplomatic\nprofession, he had such strong suspicions! He felt inclined to be\nangry with his friend, but the circumstances of his parting hardly\nadmitted of any expression of anger.\n\n\"Good-by, Clavvy,\" he said. \"Yes; I'll write; that is, if I've got\nanything to say.\"\n\n\"Take care of yourself, captain,\" said Sophie.\n\n\"All right,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Mind you come and see me when you come back,\" said Sophie.\n\n\"Of course I will,\" said Archie.\n\n\"And we'll make that all right for you yet. Gentlemen, when they have\nso much to gain, shouldn't take a No too easy. You come with your\nhandy glove, and we'll see about it again.\" Then Sophie walked off\nleaning upon the arm of Captain Boodle, and Archie stood at the door\nwatching them till they turned out of sight round the corner of the\nsquare. At last he saw them no more, and then he returned to his\nbrother.\n\nAnd as we shall see Doodles no more,--or almost no more,--we will now\nbid him adieu civilly. The pair were not ill-matched, though the lady\nperhaps had some advantage in acuteness, given to her no doubt by the\nexperience of a longer life. Doodles, as he walked along two sides\nof the square with the fair burden on his arm, felt himself to be\nin some sort proud of his position, though it was one from which he\nwould not have been sorry to escape, had escape been possible. A\nremarkable phenomenon was the Spy, and to have walked round Berkeley\nSquare with such a woman leaning on his arm, might in coming years be\nan event to remember with satisfaction. In the meantime he did not\nsay much to her, and did not quite understand all that she said to\nhim. At last he came to the door which he well remembered, and then\nhe paused. He did not escape even then. After a while the door was\nopened, and those who were passing might have seen Captain Boodle,\nslowly and with hesitating steps, enter the narrow passage before the\nlady. Then Sophie followed, and closed the door behind her. As far as\nthis story goes, what took place at that interview cannot be known.\nLet us bid farewell to Doodles, and wish him a happy escape.\n\n\"How did you come to know that woman?\" said Hugh to his brother, as\nsoon as Archie was in the dining-room.\n\n\"She was a friend of Julia's,\" said Archie.\n\n\"You haven't given her money?\" Hugh asked.\n\n\"O dear, no,\" said Archie.\n\nImmediately after that they got into their cab; the things were\npitched on the top; and,--for a while,--we may bid adieu to them\nalso.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nSHEWING HOW MRS. BURTON FOUGHT HER BATTLE.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\n\"Florence, I have been to Bolton Street and I have seen Lady Ongar.\"\nThose were the first words which Cecilia Burton spoke to her\nsister-in-law, when she found Florence in the drawing-room on her\nreturn from the visit which she had made to the countess. Florence\nhad still before her the desk on which she had been writing; and\nthe letter in its envelope addressed to Mrs. Clavering, but as yet\nunclosed, was lying beneath her blotting-paper. Florence, who had\nnever dreamed of such an undertaking on Cecilia's part, was astounded\nat the tidings which she heard. Of course her first effort was made\nto learn from her sister's tone and countenance what had been the\nresult of this interview;--but she could learn nothing from either.\nThere was no radiance as of joy in Mrs. Burton's face, nor was there\nwritten there anything of despair. Her voice was serious and almost\nsolemn, and her manner was very grave;--but that was all. \"You have\nseen her?\" said Florence, rising up from her chair.\n\n\"Yes, dear. I may have done wrong. Theodore, I know, will say so. But\nI thought it best to try to learn the truth before you wrote to Mrs.\nClavering.\"\n\n\"And what is the truth? But perhaps you have not learned it?\"\n\n\"I think I have learned all that she could tell me. She has been very\nfrank.\"\n\n\"Well;--what is the truth? Do not suppose, dearest, that I cannot\nbear it. I hope for nothing now. I only want to have this settled,\nthat I may be at rest.\"\n\nUpon this Mrs. Burton took the suffering girl in her arms and\ncaressed her tenderly. \"My love,\" said she, \"it is not easy for us to\nbe at rest. You cannot be at rest as yet.\"\n\n\"I can. I will be so, when I know that this is settled. I do not wish\nto interfere with his fortune. There is my letter to his mother, and\nnow I will go back to Stratton.\"\n\n\"Not yet, dearest; not yet,\" said Mrs. Burton, taking the letter\nin her hand, but refraining from withdrawing it at once from the\nenvelope. \"You must hear what I have heard to-day.\"\n\n\"Does she say that she loves him?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--she loves him. We must not doubt that.\"\n\n\"And he;--what does she say of him?\"\n\n\"She says what you also must say, Florence;--though it is hard that\nit should be so. It must be as he shall decide.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Florence, withdrawing herself from the arm that was still\naround her. \"No; it shall not be as he may choose to decide. I will\nnot so submit myself to him. It is enough as it is. I will never see\nhim more;--never. To say that I do not love him would be untrue, but\nI will never see him again.\"\n\n\"Stop, dear; stop. What if it be no fault of his?\"\n\n\"No fault of his that he went to her when we--we--we--he and I--were,\nas we were, together!\"\n\n\"Of course there has been some fault; but, Flo dearest, listen to me.\nYou know that I would ask you to do nothing from which a woman should\nshrink.\"\n\n\"I know that you would give your heart's blood for me;--but nothing\nwill be of avail now. Do not look at me with melancholy eyes like\nthat. Cissy, it will not kill me. It is only the doubt that kills\none.\"\n\n\"I will not look at you with melancholy eyes, but you must listen to\nme. She does not herself know what his intention is.\"\n\n\"But I know it,--and I know my own. Read my letter, Cissy. There is\nnot one word of anger in it, nor will I ever utter a reproach. He\nknew her first. If he loved her through it all, it was a pity he\ncould not be constant to his love, even though she was false to him.\"\n\n\"But you won't hear me, Flo. As far as I can learn the truth,--as\nI myself most firmly believe,--when he went to her on her return\nto England, he had no other intention than that of visiting an old\nfriend.\"\n\n\"But what sort of friend, Cissy?\"\n\n\"He had no idea then of being untrue to you. But when he saw her the\nold intimacy came back. That was natural. Then he was dazzled by her\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"Is she then so beautiful?\"\n\n\"She is very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Let him go to her,\" said Florence, tearing herself away from her\nsister's arm, and walking across the room with a quick and almost\nangry step. \"Let her have him. Cissy, there shall be an end of it.\nI will not condescend to solicit his love. If she is such as you say,\nand if beauty with him goes for everything,--what chance could there\nbe for such as me?\"\n\n\"I did not say that beauty with him went for everything.\"\n\n\"Of course it does. I ought to have known that it would be so with\nsuch a one as him. And then she is rich also,--wonderfully rich! What\nright can I have to think of him?\"\n\n\"Florence, you are unjust. You do not even suspect that it is her\nmoney.\"\n\n\"To me it is the same thing. I suppose that a woman who is so\nbeautiful has a right to everything. I know that I am plain, and I\nwill be--content--in future--to think no more--\" Poor Florence, when\nshe had got as far as that, broke down, and could go on no further\nwith the declaration which she had been about to make as to her\nfuture prospects. Mrs. Burton, taking advantage of this, went on with\nher story, struggling, not altogether unsuccessfully, to assume a\ncalm tone of unimpassioned reason.\n\n\"As I said before, he was dazzled--\"\n\n\"Dazzled!--oh!\"\n\n\"But even then he had no idea of being untrue to you.\"\n\n\"No; he was untrue without an idea. That is worse.\"\n\n\"Florence, you are perverse, and are determined to be unfair. I must\nbeg that you will hear me to the end, so that then you may be able to\njudge what course you ought to follow.\" This Mrs. Burton said with\nthe air of a great authority; after which she continued in a voice\nsomething less stern--\"He thought of doing no injury to you when he\nwent to see her; but something of the feeling of his old love grew\nupon him when he was in her company, and he became embarrassed by his\nposition before he was aware of his own danger. He might, of course,\nhave been stronger.\" Here Florence exhibited a gesture of strong\nimpatience, though she did not speak. \"I am not going to defend him\naltogether, but I think you must admit that he was hardly tried. Of\ncourse I cannot say what passed between them, but I can understand\nhow easily they might recur to the old scenes;--how naturally she\nwould wish for a renewal of the love which she had been base enough\nto betray! She does not, however, consider herself as at present\nengaged to him. That you may know for certain. It may be that she has\nasked him for such a promise, and that he has hesitated. If so, his\nstaying away from us, and his not writing to you, can be easily\nunderstood.\"\n\n\"And what is it you would have me do?\"\n\n\"He is ill now. Wait till he is well. He would have been here before\nthis, had not illness prevented him. Wait till he comes.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that, Cissy. Wait I must, but I cannot wait without\noffering him, through his mother, the freedom which I have so much\nreason to know that he desires.\"\n\n\"We do not know that he desires it. We do not know that his mother\neven suspects him of any fault towards you. Now that he is there,--at\nhome,--away from Bolton Street--\"\n\n\"I do not care to trust to such influences as that, Cissy. If he\ncould not spend this morning with her in her own house, and then as\nhe left her feel that he preferred me to her, and to all the world,\nI would rather be as I am than take his hand. He shall not marry me\nfrom pity, nor yet from a sense of duty. We know the old story,--how\nthe devil would be a monk when he was sick. I will not accept his\nsick-bed allegiance, or have to think that I owe my husband to a\nmother's influence over him while he is ill.\"\n\n\"You will make me think, Flo, that you are less true to him than she\nis.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is so. Let him have what good such truth as hers can do\nhim. For me, I feel that it is my duty to be true to myself. I will\nnot condescend to indulge my heart at the cost of my pride as a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Oh, Florence, I hate that word pride.\"\n\n\"You would not hate it for yourself, in my place.\"\n\n\"You need take no shame to love him.\"\n\n\"Have I taken shame to love him?\" said Florence, rising again from\nher chair. \"Have I been missish or coy about my love? From the moment\nin which I knew that it was a pleasure to myself to regard him as my\nfuture husband, I have spoken of my love as being always proud of it.\nI have acknowledged it as openly as you can do yours for Theodore. I\nacknowledge it still, and will never deny it. Take shame that I have\nloved him! No. But I should take to myself great shame should I ever\nbe brought so low as to ask him for his love, when once I had learned\nto think that he had transferred it from myself to another woman.\"\nThen she walked the length of the room, backwards and forwards, with\nhasty steps, not looking at her sister-in-law, whose eyes were now\nfilled with tears. \"Come, Cissy,\" she then said, \"we will make an end\nof this. Read my letter if you choose to read it,--though indeed it\nis not worth the reading, and then let me send it to the post.\"\n\nMrs. Burton now opened the letter and read it very slowly. It was\nstern and almost unfeeling in the calmness of the words chosen;\nbut in those words her proposed marriage with Harry Clavering was\nabsolutely abandoned. \"I know,\" she said, \"that your son is more\nwarmly attached to another lady than he is to me, and under those\ncircumstances, for his sake as well as for mine, it is necessary\nthat we should part. Dear Mrs. Clavering, may I ask you to make him\nunderstand that he and I are never to recur to the past? If he will\nsend me back any letters of mine,--should any have been kept,--and\nthe little present which I once gave him, all will have been done\nwhich need be done, and all have been said which need be said. He\nwill receive in a small parcel his own letters and the gifts which\nhe has made me.\" There was in this a tone of completeness,--as of\na business absolutely finished,--of a judgment admitting no appeal,\nwhich did not at all suit Mrs. Burton's views. A letter, quite as\nbecoming on the part of Florence, might, she thought, be written,\nwhich would still leave open a door for reconciliation. But Florence\nwas resolved, and the letter was sent.\n\nThe part which Mrs. Burton had taken in this conversation had\nsurprised even herself. She had been full of anger with Harry\nClavering,--as wrathful with him as her nature permitted her to be;\nand yet she had pleaded his cause with all her eloquence, going\nalmost so far in her defence of him as to declare that he was\nblameless. And in truth she was prepared to acquit him of blame,--to\ngive him full absolution without penance,--if only he could be\nbrought back again into the fold. Her wrath against him would be very\nhot should he not so return;--but all should be more than forgiven\nif he would only come back, and do his duty with affectionate and\npatient fidelity. Her desire was, not so much that justice should\nbe done, as that Florence should have the thing coveted, and that\nFlorence's rival should not have it. According to the arguments,\nas arranged by her feminine logic, Harry Clavering would be all\nright or all wrong according as he might at last bear himself. She\ndesired success, and, if she could only be successful, was prepared\nto forgive everything. And even yet she would not give up the\nbattle, though she admitted to herself that Florence's letter to\nMrs. Clavering made the contest more difficult than ever. It might,\nhowever, be that Mrs. Clavering would be good enough, just enough,\ntrue enough, clever enough, to know that such a letter as this,\ncoming from such a girl and written under such circumstances, should\nbe taken as meaning nothing. Most mothers would wish to see their\nsons married to wealth, should wealth throw itself in their way;--but\nMrs. Clavering, possibly, might not be such a mother as that.\n\nIn the meantime there was before her the terrible necessity of\nexplaining to her husband the step which she had taken without his\nknowledge, and of which she knew that she must tell him the history\nbefore she could sit down to dinner with him in comfort. \"Theodore,\"\nshe said, creeping in out of her own chamber to his dressing-room,\nwhile he was washing his hands, \"you mustn't be angry with me, but\nI have done something to-day.\"\n\n\"And why must I not be angry with you?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. You mustn't be angry--especially about\nthis,--because I don't want you to be.\"\n\n\"That's conclusive,\" said he. It was manifest to her that he was in a\ngood humour, which was a great blessing. He had not been tried with\nhis work as he was often wont to be, and was therefore willing to be\nplayful.\n\n\"What do you think I've done?\" said she. \"I have been to Bolton\nStreet and have seen Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I have, Theodore, indeed.\"\n\nMr. Burton had been rubbing his face vehemently with a rough towel at\nthe moment in which the communication had been made to him, and so\nstrongly was he affected by it that he was stopped in his operation\nand brought to a stand in his movement, looking at his wife over the\ntowel as he held it in both his hands. \"What on earth has made you do\nsuch a thing as that?\" he said.\n\n\"I thought it best. I thought that I might hear the truth,--and so\nI have. I could not bear that Florence should be sacrificed whilst\nanything remained undone that was possible.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me that you were going?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear; I thought it better not. Of course I ought to have\ntold you, but in this instance I thought it best just to go without\nthe fuss of mentioning it.\"\n\n\"What you really mean is, that if you had told me I should have asked\nyou not to go.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And you were determined to have your own way.\"\n\n\"I don't think, Theodore, I care so much about my own way as some\nwomen do. I am sure I always think your opinion is better than my\nown;--that is, in most things.\"\n\n\"And what did Lady Ongar say to you?\" He had now put down the towel,\nand was seated in his arm-chair, looking up into his wife's face.\n\n\"It would be a long story to tell you all that she said.\"\n\n\"Was she civil to you?\"\n\n\"She was not uncivil. She is a handsome, proud woman, prone to\nspeak out what she thinks and determined to have her own way when\nit is possible; but I think that she intended to be civil to me\npersonally.\"\n\n\"What is her purpose now?\"\n\n\"Her purpose is clear enough. She means to marry Harry Clavering if\nshe can get him. She said so. She made no secret of what her wishes\nare.\"\n\n\"Then, Cissy, let her marry him, and do not let us trouble ourselves\nfurther in the matter.\"\n\n\"But Florence, Theodore! Think of Florence!\"\n\n\"I am thinking of her, and I think that Harry Clavering is not worth\nher acceptance. She is as the traveller that fell among thieves.\nShe is hurt and wounded, but not dead. It is for you to be the Good\nSamaritan, but the oil which you should pour into her wounds is not\na renewed hope as to that worthless man. Let Lady Ongar have him. As\nfar as I can see, they are fit for each other.\"\n\nThen she went through with him, diligently, all the arguments\nwhich she had used with Florence, palliating Harry's conduct, and\nexplaining the circumstances of his disloyalty, almost as those\ncircumstances had in truth occurred. \"I think you are too hard on\nhim,\" she said. \"You can't be too hard on falsehood,\" he replied.\n\"No, not while it exists. But you would not be angry with a man for\never, because he should once have been false? But we do not know that\nhe is false.\" \"Do we not?\" said he. \"But never mind; we must go to\ndinner now. Does Florence know of your visit?\" Then, before she would\nallow him to leave his room, she explained to him what had taken\nplace between herself and Florence, and told him of the letter that\nhad been written to Mrs. Clavering. \"She is right,\" said he. \"That\nway out of her difficulty is the best that is left to her.\" But,\nnevertheless, Mrs. Burton was resolved that she would not as yet\nsurrender.\n\nTheodore Burton, when he reached the drawing-room, went up to his\nsister and kissed her. Such a sign of the tenderness of love was\nnot common with him, for he was one of those who are not usually\ndemonstrative in their affection. At the present moment he said\nnothing of what was passing in his mind, nor did she. She simply\nraised her face to meet his lips, and pressed his hand as she held\nit. What need was there of any further sign between them than this?\nThen they went to dinner, and their meal was eaten almost in silence.\nAlmost every moment Cecilia's eye was on her sister-in-law. A careful\nobserver, had there been one there, might have seen this; but, while\nthey remained together downstairs, there occurred among them nothing\nelse to mark that all was not well with them.\n\nNor would the brother have spoken a word during the evening on the\nsubject that was so near to all their hearts had not Florence led the\nway. When they were at tea, and when Cecilia had already made up her\nmind that there was to be no further discussion that night, Florence\nsuddenly broke forth.\n\n\"Theodore,\" she said, \"I have been thinking much about it, and I\nbelieve I had better go home, to Stratton, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Cecilia, eagerly.\n\n\"I believe it will be better that I should,\" continued Florence. \"I\nsuppose it is very weak in me to own it; but I am unhappy, and, like\nthe wounded bird, I feel that it will be well that I should hide\nmyself.\"\n\nCecilia was at her feet in a moment. \"Dearest Flo,\" she said. \"Is not\nthis your home as well as Stratton?\"\n\n\"When I am able to be happy it is. Those who have light hearts may\nhave more homes than one; but it is not so with those whose hearts\nare heavy. I think it will be best for me to go.\"\n\n\"You shall do exactly as you please,\" said her brother. \"In such a\nmatter I will not try to persuade you. I only wish that we could tend\nto comfort you.\"\n\n\"You do comfort me. If I know that you think I am doing right, that\nwill comfort me more than anything. Absolute and immediate comfort is\nnot to be had when one is sorrowful.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said her brother. \"Sorrow should not be killed too\nquickly. I always think that those who are impervious to grief must\nbe impervious also to happiness. If you have feelings capable of the\none, you must have them capable also of the other!\"\n\n\"You should wait, at any rate, till you get an answer from Mrs.\nClavering,\" said Cecilia.\n\n\"I do not know that she has any answer to send to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; she must answer you, if you will think of it. If she\naccepts what you have said--\"\n\n\"She cannot but accept it.\"\n\n\"Then she must reply to you. There is something which you have asked\nher to send to you; and I think you should wait, at any rate, till\nit reaches you here. Mind I do not think her answer will be of that\nnature; but it is clear that you should wait for it whatever it may\nbe.\" Then Florence, with the concurrence of her brother's opinion,\nconsented to remain in London for a few days, expecting the answer\nwhich would be sent by Mrs. Clavering;--and after that no further\ndiscussion took place as to her trouble.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE SHEEP RETURNS TO THE FOLD.\n\n\nHarry Clavering had spoken solemn words to his mother, during his\nillness, which both he and she regarded as a promise that Florence\nshould not be deserted by him. After that promise nothing more was\nsaid between them on the subject for a few days. Mrs. Clavering was\ncontented that the promise had been made, and Harry himself, in the\nweakness consequent upon his illness, was willing enough to accept\nthe excuse which his illness gave him for postponing any action in\nthe matter. But the fever had left him, and he was sitting up in his\nmother's room, when Florence's letter reached the parsonage,--and,\nwith the letter, the little parcel which she herself had packed up so\ncarefully. On the day before that a few words had passed between the\nrector and his wife, which will explain the feelings of both of them\nin the matter.\n\n\"Have you heard,\" said he,--speaking in a voice hardly above a\nwhisper, although no third person was in the room,--\"that Harry is\nagain thinking of making Julia his wife?\"\n\n\"He is not thinking of doing so,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"They who say\nso, do him wrong.\"\n\n\"It would be a great thing for him as regards money.\"\n\n\"But he is engaged,--and Florence Burton has been received here as\nhis future wife. I could not endure to think that it should be so. At\nany rate, it is not true.\"\n\n\"I only tell you what I heard,\" said the rector, gently sighing,\npartly in obedience to his wife's implied rebuke, and partly at the\nthought that so grand a marriage should not be within his son's\nreach. The rector was beginning to be aware that Harry would hardly\nmake a fortune at the profession which he had chosen, and that a rich\nmarriage would be an easy way out of all the difficulties which such\na failure promised. The rector was a man who dearly loved easy ways\nout of difficulties. But in such matters as these his wife he knew\nwas imperative and powerful, and he lacked the courage to plead for a\ncause that was prudent, but ungenerous.\n\nWhen Mrs. Clavering received the letter and parcel on the next\nmorning, Harry Clavering was still in bed. With the delightful\nprivilege of a convalescent invalid, he was allowed in these days\nto get up just when getting up became more comfortable than lying\nin bed, and that time did not usually come till eleven o'clock was\npast;--but the postman reached the Clavering parsonage by nine. The\nletter, as we know, was addressed to Mrs. Clavering herself, as\nwas also the outer envelope which contained the packet; but the\npacket itself was addressed in Florence's clear handwriting to Harry\nClavering, Esq. \"That is a large parcel to come by post, mamma,\" said\nFanny.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; but it is something particular.\"\n\n\"It's from some tradesman, I suppose?\" said the rector.\n\n\"No; it's not from a tradesman,\" said Mrs. Clavering. But she said\nnothing further, and both husband and daughter perceived that it was\nnot intended that they should ask further questions.\n\nFanny, as usual, had taken her brother his breakfast, and Mrs.\nClavering did not go up to him till that ceremony had been completed\nand removed. Indeed it was necessary that she should study Florence's\nletter in her own room before she could speak to him about it. What\nthe parcel contained she well knew, even before the letter had been\nthoroughly read; and I need hardly say that the treasure was sacred\nin her hands. When she had finished the perusal of the letter there\nwas a tear,--a gentle tear, in each eye. She understood it all, and\ncould fathom the strength and weakness of every word which Florence\nhad written. But she was such a woman,--exactly such a woman,--as\nCecilia Burton had pictured to herself. Mrs. Clavering was good\nenough, great enough, true enough, clever enough to know that Harry's\nlove for Florence should be sustained, and his fancy for Lady Ongar\novercome. At no time would she have been proud to see her son\nprosperous only in the prosperity of a wife's fortune; but she would\nhave been thoroughly ashamed of him, had he resolved to pursue such\nprosperity under his present circumstances.\n\nBut her tears,--though they were there in the corners of her\neyes,--were not painful tears. Dear Florence! She was suffering\nbitterly now. This very day would be a day of agony to her. There\nhad been for her, doubtless, many days of agony during the past\nmonth. That the letter was true in all its words Mrs. Clavering did\nnot doubt. That Florence believed that all was over between her and\nHarry, Mrs. Clavering was as sure as Florence had intended that she\nshould be. But all should not be over, and the days of agony should\nsoon be at an end. Her boy had promised her, and to her he had always\nbeen true. And she understood, too, the way in which these dangers\nhad come upon him, and her judgment was not heavy upon her son;--her\ngracious boy, who had ever been so good to her! It might be that he\nhad been less diligent at his work than he should have been,--that\non that account further delay would still be necessary; but Florence\nwould forgive that, and he had promised that Florence should not be\ndeserted.\n\nThen she took the parcel in her hands, and considered all its\ncircumstances,--how precious had once been its contents, and how\nprecious doubtless they still were, though they had been thus\nrepudiated! And she thought of the moments,--nay, rather of the\nhours,--which had been passed in the packing of that little packet.\nShe well understood how a girl would linger over such dear pain,\ntouching the things over and over again, allowing herself to read\nmorsels of the letters at which she had already forbidden herself\neven to look,--till every word had been again seen and weighed, again\ncaressed and again abjured. She knew how those little trinkets would\nhave been fondled! How salt had been the tears that had fallen on\nthem, and how carefully the drops would have been removed. Every fold\nin the paper of the two envelopes, with the little morsels of wax\njust adequate for their purpose, told of the lingering painful care\nwith which the work had been done. Ah! the parcel should go back at\nonce with words of love that should put an end to all that pain! She,\nwho had sent these loved things away, should have her letters again,\nand should touch her little treasures with fingers that should take\npleasure in the touching. She should again read her lover's words\nwith an enduring delight. Mrs. Clavering understood it all, as though\nshe also were still a girl with a lover of her own.\n\nHarry was beginning to think that the time had come in which getting\nup would be more comfortable than lying in bed, when his mother\nknocked at his door and entered his room. \"I was just going to make a\nmove, mother,\" he said, having reached that stage of convalescence in\nwhich some shame comes upon the idler.\n\n\"But I want to speak to you first, my dear,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"I\nhave got a letter for you, or rather a parcel.\" Harry held out his\nhand, and taking the packet, at once recognized the writing of the\naddress.\n\n\"You know from whom it comes, Harry?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, mother.\"\n\n\"And do you know what it contains?\" Harry, still holding the packet,\nlooked at it, but said nothing. \"I know,\" said his mother; \"for\nshe has written and told me. Will you see her letter to me?\" Again\nHarry held out his hand, but his mother did not at once give him the\nletter. \"First of all, my dear, let us know that we understand each\nother. This dear girl,--to me she is inexpressibly dear,--is to be\nyour wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother;--it shall be so.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: The sheep returns to the fold.]\n\n\n\"That is my own boy! Harry, I have never doubted you;--have never\ndoubted that you would be right at last. Now you shall see her\nletter. But you must remember that she has had cause to make her\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"I will remember.\"\n\n\"Had you not been ill, everything would of course have been all right\nbefore now.\" As to the correctness of this assertion the reader\nprobably will have doubts of his own. Then she handed him the letter,\nand sat on his bed-side while he read it. At first he was startled,\nand made almost indignant at the firmness of the girl's words. She\ngave him up as though it were a thing quite decided, and uttered no\nexpression of her own regret in doing so. There was no soft woman's\nwail in her words. But there was in them something which made him\nunconsciously long to get back the thing which he had so nearly\nthrown away from him. They inspired him with a doubt whether he might\nyet succeed, which very doubt greatly increased his desire. As he\nread the letter for the second time, Julia became less beautiful\nin his imagination, and the charm of Florence's character became\nstronger.\n\n\"Well, dear?\" said his mother, when she saw that he had finished the\nsecond reading of the epistle.\n\nHe hardly knew how to express, even to his mother, all his\nfeelings,--the shame that he felt, and with the shame something of\nindignation that he should have been so repulsed. And of his love,\ntoo, he was afraid to speak. He was willing enough to give the\nrequired assurance, but after that he would have preferred to have\nbeen left alone. But his mother could not leave him without some\nfurther word of agreement between them as to the course which they\nwould pursue.\n\n\"Will you write to her, mother, or shall I?\"\n\n\"I shall write, certainly,--by to-day's post. I would not leave her\nan hour, if I could help it, without an assurance of your unaltered\naffection.\"\n\n\"I could go to town to-morrow, mother;--could I not?\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow, Harry. It would be foolish. Say on Monday.\"\n\n\"And you will write to-day?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I will send a line also,--just a line.\"\n\n\"And the parcel?\"\n\n\"I have not opened it yet.\"\n\n\"You know what it contains. Send it back at once, Harry;--at once.\nIf I understand her feelings, she will not be happy till she gets it\ninto her hands again. We will send Jem over to the post-office, and\nhave it registered.\"\n\nWhen so much was settled, Mrs. Clavering went away about the affairs\nof her house, thinking as she did so of the loving words with which\nshe would strive to give back happiness to Florence Burton.\n\nHarry, when he was alone, slowly opened the parcel. He could not\nresist the temptation of doing this, and of looking again at the\nthings which she had sent back to him. And he was not without an\nidea,--perhaps a hope--that there might be with them some short\nnote,--some scrap containing a few words for himself. If he had\nany such hope he was disappointed. There were his own letters,\nall scented with lavender from the casket in which they had been\npreserved; there was the rich bracelet which had been given with some\nlittle ceremony, and the cheap brooch which he had thrown to her as\na joke, and which she had sworn that she would value the most of all\nbecause she could wear it every day; and there was the pencil-case\nwhich he had fixed on to her watch-chain, while her fingers were\ntouching his fingers, caressing him for his love while her words were\nrebuking him for his awkwardness. He remembered it all as the things\nlay strewed upon his bed. And he re-read every word of his own words.\n\"What a fool a man makes of himself,\" he said to himself at last,\nwith something of the cheeriness of laughter about his heart. But as\nhe said so he was quite ready to make himself a fool after the same\nfashion again,--if only there were not in his way that difficulty of\nrecommencing. Had it been possible for him to write again at once in\nthe old strain,--without any reference to his own conduct during the\nlast month, he would have begun his fooling without waiting to finish\nhis dressing.\n\n\"Did you open the parcel?\" his mother asked him, some hour or so\nbefore it was necessary that Jem should be started on his mission.\n\n\"Yes; I thought it best to open it.\"\n\n\"And have you made it up again?\"\n\n\"Not yet, mother.\"\n\n\"Put this with it, dear.\" And his mother gave him a little jewel, a\ncupid in mosaic surrounded by tiny diamonds, which he remembered her\nto wear ever since he had first noticed the things she had worn. \"Not\nfrom me, mind. I give it to you. Come;--will you trust me to pack\nthem?\" Then Mrs. Clavering again made up the parcel, and added the\ntrinket which she had brought with her.\n\nHarry at last brought himself to write a few words. \"Dearest, dearest\nFlorence,--They will not let me out, or I would go to you at once.\nMy mother has written, and though I have not seen her letter, I know\nwhat it contains. Indeed, indeed you may believe it all. May I not\nventure to return the parcel? I do send it back and implore you to\nkeep it. I shall be in town, I think, on Monday, and will go to\nOnslow Crescent,--instantly. Your own, H. C.\" Then there was scrawled\na postscript which was worth all the rest put together,--was better\nthan his own note, better than his mother's letter, better than the\nreturned packet. \"I love no one better than you;--no one half so\nwell,--neither now, nor ever did.\" These words, whether wholly true\nor only partially so, were at least to the point; and were taken by\nCecilia Burton, when she heard of them, as a confession of faith that\ndemanded instant and plenary absolution.\n\nThe trouble which had called Harry down to Clavering remained, I\nregret to say, almost in full force now that his prolonged visit\nhad been brought so near its close. Mr. Saul, indeed, had agreed\nto resign his curacy, and was already on the look-out for similar\nemployment in some other parish. And since his interview with Fanny's\nfather he had never entered the rectory, or spoken to Fanny. Fanny\nhad promised that there should be no such speaking, and indeed no\ndanger of that kind was feared. Whatever Mr. Saul might do he would\ndo openly,--nay, audaciously. But though there existed this security,\nnevertheless things as regarded Fanny were very unpleasant. When Mr.\nSaul had commenced his courtship, she had agreed with her family in\nalmost ridiculing the idea of such a lover. There had been a feeling\nwith her as with the others that poor Mr. Saul was to be pitied. Then\nshe had come to regard his overtures as matters of grave import,--not\nindeed avowing to her mother anything so strong as a return of his\naffection, but speaking of his proposal as one to which there was\nno other objection than that of a want of money. Now, however, she\nwent moping about the house as though she were a victim of true love,\ncondemned to run unsmoothly for ever; as though her passion for Mr.\nSaul were too much for her, and she were waiting in patience till\ndeath should relieve her from the cruelty of her parents. She never\ncomplained. Such victims never do complain. But she moped and was\nwretched, and when her mother questioned her, struggling to find out\nhow strong this feeling might in truth be, Fanny would simply make\nher dutiful promises,--promises which were wickedly dutiful,--that\nshe would never mention the name of Mr. Saul any more. Mr. Saul in\nthe meantime went about his parish duties with grim energy, supplying\nthe rector's shortcomings without a word. He would have been glad\nto preach all the sermons and read all the services during these\nsix months, had he been allowed to do so. He was constant in\nthe schools,--more constant than ever in his visitings. He was\nvery courteous to Mr. Clavering when the necessities of their\nposition brought them together. For all this Mr. Clavering hated\nhim,--unjustly. For a man placed as Mr. Saul was placed a line of\nconduct exactly level with that previously followed is impossible,\nand it was better that he should become more energetic in his duties\nthan less so. It will be easily understood that all these things\ninterfered much with the general happiness of the family at the\nrectory at this time.\n\nThe Monday came, and Harry Clavering, now convalescent and simply\ninteresting from the remaining effects of his illness, started on his\njourney for London. There had come no further letters from Onslow\nTerrace to the parsonage, and, indeed, owing to the intervention of\nSunday, none could have come unless Florence had written by return\nof post. Harry made his journey, beginning it with some promise of\nhappiness to himself,--but becoming somewhat uneasy as his train drew\nnear to London. He had behaved badly, and he knew that in the first\nplace he must own that he had done so. To men such a necessity is\nalways grievous. Women not unfrequently like the task. To confess,\nsubmit, and be accepted as confessing and submitting, comes naturally\nto the feminine mind. The cry of peccavi sounds soft and pretty when\nmade by sweet lips in a loving voice. But a man who can own that he\nhas done amiss without a pang,--who can so own it to another man,\nor even to a woman,--is usually but a poor creature. Harry must now\nmake such confession, and therefore he became uneasy. And then, for\nhim, there was another task behind the one which he would be called\nupon to perform this evening,--a task which would have nothing of\npleasantness in it to redeem its pain. He must confess not only to\nFlorence,--where his confession might probably have its reward,--but\nhe must confess also to Julia. This second confession would, indeed,\nbe a hard task to him. That, however, was to be postponed till the\nmorrow. On this evening he had pledged himself that he would go\ndirect to Onslow Terrace; and this he did as soon after he had\nreached his lodgings as was possible. It was past six when he reached\nLondon, and it was not yet eight when, with palpitating heart, he\nknocked at Mr. Burton's door.\n\nI must take the reader back with me for a few minutes, in order\nthat we may see after what fashion the letters from Clavering were\nreceived by the ladies in Onslow Terrace. On that day Mr. Burton had\nbeen required to go out of London by one of the early trains, and had\nnot been in the house when the postman came. Nothing had been said\nbetween Cecilia and Florence as to their hopes or fears in regard to\nan answer from Clavering;--nothing at least since that conversation\nin which Florence had agreed to remain in London for yet a few days;\nbut each of them was very nervous on the matter. Any answer, if sent\nat once from Clavering, would arrive on this morning; and therefore,\nwhen the well-known knock was heard, neither of them was able to\nmaintain her calmness perfectly. But yet nothing was said, nor did\neither of them rise from her seat at the breakfast-table. Presently\nthe girl came in with apparently a bundle of letters, which she was\nstill sorting when she entered the room. There were two or three for\nMr. Burton, two for Cecilia, and then two besides the registered\npacket for Florence. For that a receipt was needed, and as Florence\nhad seen the address and recognized the writing, she was hardly able\nto give her signature. As soon as the maid was gone, Cecilia could\nkeep her seat no longer. \"I know those are from Clavering,\" she said,\nrising from her chair, and coming round to the side of the table.\nFlorence instinctively swept the packet into her lap, and, leaning\nforward, covered the letters with her hands. \"Oh, Florence, let us\nsee them; let us see them at once. If we are to be happy let us know\nit.\" But Florence paused, still leaning over her treasures, and\nhardly daring to show her burning face. Even yet it might be that she\nwas rejected. Then Cecilia went back to her seat, and simply looked\nat her sister with beseeching eyes. \"I think I'll go upstairs,\"\nsaid Florence. \"Are you afraid of me, Flo?\" Cecilia answered\nreproachfully. \"Let me see the outside of them.\" Then Florence\nbrought them round the table, and put them into her sister's hands.\n\"May I open this one from Mrs. Clavering?\" Florence nodded her head.\nThen the seal was broken, and in one minute the two women were crying\nin each other's arms. \"I was quite sure of it,\" said Cecilia, through\nher tears,--\"perfectly sure. I never doubted it for a moment. How\ncould you have talked of going to Stratton?\" At last Florence got\nherself away up to the window, and gradually mustered courage to\nbreak the envelope of her lover's letter. It was not at once that she\nshowed the postscript to Cecilia, nor at once that the packet was\nopened. That last ceremony she did perform in the solitude of her\nown room. But before the day was over the postscript had been shown,\nand the added trinket had been exhibited. \"I remember it well,\" said\nFlorence. \"Mrs. Clavering wore it on her forehead when we dined at\nLady Clavering's.\" Mrs. Burton in all this saw something of the\ngentle persuasion which the mother had used, but of that she said\nnothing. That he should be back again, and should have repented, was\nenough for her.\n\nMr. Burton was again absent when Harry Clavering knocked in person\nat the door; but on this occasion his absence had been specially\narranged by him with a view to Harry's comfort. \"He won't want to\nsee me this evening,\" he had said. \"Indeed you'll all get on a\ngreat deal better without me.\" He therefore had remained away from\nhome, and, not being a club man, had dined most uncomfortably at an\neating-house. \"Are the ladies at home?\" Harry asked, when the door\nwas opened. Oh, yes; they were at home. There was no danger that they\nshould be found out on such an occasion as this. The girl looked\nat him pleasantly, calling him by his name as she answered him, as\nthough she too desired to show him that he had again been taken into\nfavour,--into her favour as well as that of her mistress.\n\nHe hardly knew what he was doing as he ran up the steps to the\ndrawing-room. He was afraid of what was to come; but nevertheless\nhe rushed at his fate as some young soldier rushes at the trench\nin which he feels that he may probably fall. So Harry Clavering\nhurried on, and before he had looked round upon the room which he had\nentered, found his fate with Florence on his bosom.\n\nAlas, alas! I fear that justice was outraged in the welcome that\nHarry received on that evening. I have said that he would be called\nupon to own his sins, and so much, at least, should have been\nrequired of him. But he owned no sin! I have said that a certain\ndegradation must attend him in that first interview after his\nreconciliation. Instead of this the hours that he spent that evening\nin Onslow Terrace were hours of one long ovation. He was, as it were,\nput upon a throne as a king who had returned from his conquest, and\nthose two women did him honour, almost kneeling at his feet. Cecilia\nwas almost as tender with him as Florence, pleading to her own false\nheart the fact of his illness as his excuse. There was something of\nthe pallor of the sick-room left with him,--a slight tenuity in his\nhands and brightness in his eye which did him yeoman's service. Had\nhe been quite robust, Cecilia might have felt that she could not\njustify to herself the peculiar softness of her words. After the\nfirst quarter of an hour he was supremely happy. His awkwardness had\ngone, and as he sat with his arm round Florence's waist, he found\nthat the little pencil-case had again been attached to her chain, and\nas he looked down upon her he saw that the cheap brooch was again on\nher breast. It would have been pretty, could an observer have been\nthere, to see the skill with which they both steered clear of any\nword or phrase which could be disagreeable to him. One might have\nthought that it would have been impossible to avoid all touch of a\nrebuke. The very fact that he was forgiven would seem to imply some\nfault that required pardon. But there was no hint at any fault.\nThe tact of women excels the skill of men; and so perfect was the\ntact of these women that not a word was said which wounded Harry's\near. He had come again into their fold, and they were rejoiced and\nshowed their joy. He who had gone astray had repented, and they were\nbeautifully tender to the repentant sheep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nRESTITUTION.\n\n\nHarry stayed a little too long with his love,--a little longer at\nleast than had been computed, and in consequence met Theodore Burton\nin the Crescent as he was leaving it. This meeting could hardly be\nmade without something of pain, and perhaps it was well for Harry\nthat he should have such an opportunity as this for getting over it\nquickly. But when he saw Mr. Burton under the bright gas-lamp he\nwould very willingly have avoided him, had it been possible.\n\n\"Well, Harry?\" said Burton, giving his hand to the repentant sheep.\n\n\"How are you, Burton?\" said Harry, trying to speak with an\nunconcerned voice. Then in answer to an inquiry as to his health, he\ntold of his own illness, speaking of that confounded fever having\nmade him very low. He intended no deceit, but he made more of the\nfever than was necessary.\n\n\"When will you come back to the shop?\" Burton asked. It must be\nremembered that though the brother could not refuse to welcome back\nto his home his sister's lover, still he thought that the engagement\nwas a misfortune. He did not believe in Harry as a man of business,\nand had almost rejoiced when Florence had been so nearly quit of him.\nAnd now there was a taint of sarcasm in his voice as he asked as to\nHarry's return to the chambers in the Adelphi.\n\n\"I can hardly quite say as yet,\" said Harry, still pleading his\nillness. \"They were very much against my coming up to London so\nsoon. Indeed I should not have done it had I not felt so very--very\nanxious to see Florence. I don't know, Burton, whether I ought to say\nanything to you about that.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have said what you had to say to the women?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I think they understand me completely, and I hope that I\nunderstand them.\"\n\n\"In that case I don't know that you need say anything to me. Come to\nthe Adelphi as soon as you can; that's all. I never think myself that\na man becomes a bit stronger after an illness by remaining idle.\"\nThen Harry passed on, and felt that he had escaped easily in that\ninterview.\n\nBut as he walked home he was compelled to think of the step which he\nmust next take. When he had last seen Lady Ongar he had left her with\na promise that Florence was to be deserted for her sake. As yet that\npromise would by her be supposed to be binding. Indeed he had thought\nit to be binding on himself till he had found himself under his\nmother's influence at the parsonage. During his last few weeks in\nLondon he had endured an agony of doubt; but in his vacillations\nthe pendulum had always veered more strongly towards Bolton Street\nthan to Onslow Crescent. Now the swinging of the pendulum had ceased\naltogether. From henceforth Bolton Street must be forbidden ground\nto him, and the sheepfold in Onslow Crescent must be his home till\nhe should have established a small peculiar fold for himself. But,\nas yet, he had still before him the task of communicating his\nfinal decision to the lady in Bolton Street. As he walked home he\ndetermined that he had better do so in the first place by letter,\nand so eager was he as to the propriety of doing this at once, that\non his return to his lodgings he sat down, and wrote the letter\nbefore he went to his bed. It was not very easily written. Here, at\nany rate, he had to make those confessions of which I have before\nspoken;--confessions which it may be less difficult to make with\npen and ink than with spoken words, but which when so made are more\ndegrading. The word that is written is a thing capable of permanent\nlife, and lives frequently to the confusion of its parent. A man\nshould make his confessions always by word of mouth if it be\npossible. Whether such a course would have been possible to Harry\nClavering may be doubtful. It might have been that in a personal\nmeeting the necessary confession would not have got itself adequately\nspoken. Thinking, perhaps, of this he wrote his letter as follows on\nthat night.\n\n\n   Bloomsbury Square, July, 186--.\n\n\nThe date was easily written, but how was he to go on after that? In\nwhat form of affection or indifference was he to address her whom he\nhad at that last meeting called his own, his dearest Julia? He got\nout of his difficulty in the way common to ladies and gentlemen under\nsuch stress, and did not address her by any name or any epithet.\nThe date he allowed to remain, and then he went away at once to the\nmatter of his subject.\n\n\n   I feel that I owe it you at once to tell you what has\n   been my history during the last few weeks. I came up from\n   Clavering to-day, and have since that been with Mrs. and\n   Miss Burton. Immediately on my return from them I sit down\n   to write you.\n\n\nAfter having said so much, Harry probably felt that the rest of his\nletter would be surplusage. Those few words would tell her all that\nit was required that she should know. But courtesy demanded that he\nshould say more, and he went on with his confession.\n\n\n   You know that I became engaged to Miss Burton soon after\n   your own marriage. I feel now that I should have told you\n   this when we first met; but yet, had I done so, it would\n   have seemed as though I told it with a special object. I\n   don't know whether I make myself understood in this. I can\n   only hope that I do so.\n\n\nUnderstood! Of course she understood it all. She required no\nblundering explanation from him to assist her intelligence.\n\n\n   I wish now that I had mentioned it. It would have been\n   better for both of us. I should have been saved much pain;\n   and you, perhaps, some uneasiness.\n\n   I was called down to Clavering a few weeks ago, about some\n   business in the family, and then became ill,--so that I\n   was confined to my bed instead of returning to town. Had\n   it not been for this I should not have left you so long in\n   suspense,--that is if there has been suspense. For myself,\n   I have to own that I have been very weak,--worse than\n   weak, I fear you will think. I do not know whether your\n   old regard for me will prompt you to make any excuse for\n   me, but I am well sure that I can make none for myself\n   which will not have suggested itself to you, without\n   my urging it. If you choose to think that I have been\n   heartless,--or rather, if you are able so to think of me,\n   no words of mine, written or spoken now, will remove that\n   impression from your mind.\n\n   I believe that I need write nothing further. You will\n   understand from what I have said all that I should have\n   to say were I to refer at length to that which has passed\n   between us. All that is over now, and it only remains for\n   me to express a hope that you may be happy. Whether we\n   shall ever see each other again who shall say?--but if we\n   do I trust that we may not meet as enemies. May God bless\n   you here and hereafter.\n\n   HARRY CLAVERING.\n\n\nWhen the letter was finished Harry sat for a while by his open\nwindow looking at the moon, over the chimney-pots of his square, and\nthinking of his career in life as it had hitherto been fulfilled. The\ngreat promise of his earlier days had not been kept. His plight in\nthe world was now poor enough, though his hopes had been so high! He\nwas engaged to be married, but had no income on which to marry. He\nhad narrowly escaped great wealth. Ah!--It was hard for him to think\nof that without a regret; but he did strive so to think of it. Though\nhe told himself that it would have been evil for him to have depended\non money which had been procured by the very act which had been to\nhim an injury,--to have dressed himself in the feathers which had\nbeen plucked from Lord Ongar's wings,--it was hard for him to think\nof all that he had missed, and rejoice thoroughly that he had missed\nit. But he told himself that he so rejoiced, and endeavoured to be\nglad that he had not soiled his hands with riches which never would\nhave belonged to the woman he had loved had she not earned them by\nbeing false to him. Early on the following morning he sent off his\nletter, and then, putting himself into a cab, bowled down to Onslow\nCrescent. The sheepfold now was very pleasant to him when the head\nshepherd was away, and so much gratification it was natural that he\nshould allow himself.\n\nThat evening, when he came from his club, he found a note from Lady\nOngar. It was very short, and the blood rushed to his face as he felt\nashamed at seeing with how much apparent ease she had answered him.\nHe had written with difficulty, and had written awkwardly. But there\nwas nothing awkward in her words.\n\n\n   DEAR HARRY,--We are quits now. I do not know why we should\n   ever meet as enemies. I shall never feel myself to be an\n   enemy of yours. I think it would be well that we should\n   see each other, and if you have no objection to seeing me,\n   I will be at home any evening that you may call. Indeed\n   I am at home always in the evening. Surely, Harry, there\n   can be no reason why we should not meet. You need not fear\n   that there will be danger in it.\n\n   Will you give my compliments to Miss Florence Burton, with\n   my best wishes for her happiness? Your Mrs. Burton I have\n   seen,--as you may have heard, and I congratulate you on\n   your friend.\n\n   Yours always, J. O.\n\n\nThe writing of this letter seemed to have been easy enough, and\ncertainly there was nothing in it that was awkward; but I think that\nthe writer had suffered more in the writing than Harry had done in\nproducing his longer epistle. But she had known how to hide her\nsuffering, and had used a tone which told no tale of her wounds. We\nare quits now, she had said, and she had repeated the words over and\nover again to herself as she walked up and down her room. Yes! they\nwere quits now,--if the reflection of that fact could do her any\ngood. She had ill-treated him in her early days; but, as she had\ntold herself so often, she had served him rather than injured him by\nthat ill-treatment. She had been false to him; but her falsehood had\npreserved him from a lot which could not have been fortunate. With\nsuch a clog as she would have been round his neck,--with such a wife,\nwithout a shilling of fortune, how could he have risen in the world?\nNo! Though she had deceived him, she had served him. Then,--after\nthat,--had come the tragedy of her life, the terrible days in\nthinking of which she still shuddered, the days of her husband and\nSophie Gordeloup,--that terrible deathbed, those attacks upon her\nhonour, misery upon misery, as to which she never now spoke a word to\nany one, and as to which she was resolved that she never would speak\nagain. She had sold herself for money, and had got the price; but\nthe punishment of her offence had been very heavy. And now, in these\nlatter days, she had thought to compensate the man she had loved for\nthe treachery with which she had used him. That treachery had been\nserviceable to him, but not the less should the compensation be very\nrich. And she would love him too. Ah, yes; she had always loved him!\nHe should have it all now,--everything, if only he would consent to\nforget that terrible episode in her life, as she would strive to\nforget it. All that should remain to remind them of Lord Ongar would\nbe the wealth that should henceforth belong to Harry Clavering.\nSuch had been her dream, and Harry had come to her with words of\nlove which made it seem to be a reality. He had spoken to her words\nof love which he was now forced to withdraw, and the dream was\ndissipated. It was not to be allowed to her to escape her penalty so\neasily as that! As for him, they were now quits. That being the case,\nthere could be no reason why they should quarrel.\n\nBut what now should she do with her wealth, and especially how should\nshe act in respect to that place down in the country? Though she had\nlearned to hate Ongar Park during her solitary visit there, she had\nstill looked forward to the pleasure the property might give her,\nwhen she should be able to bestow it upon Harry Clavering. But that\nhad been part of her dream, and the dream was now over. Through it\nall she had been conscious that she might hardly dare to hope that\nthe end of her punishment should come so soon,--and now she knew that\nit was not to come. As far as she could see, there was no end to the\npunishment in prospect for her. From her first meeting with Harry\nClavering on the platform of the railway station his presence, or\nher thoughts of him, had sufficed to give some brightness to her\nlife,--had enabled her to support the friendship of Sophie Gordeloup,\nand also to support her solitude when poor Sophie had been banished.\nBut now she was left without any resource. As she sat alone,\nmeditating on all this, she endeavoured to console herself with the\nreflection that, after all, she was the one whom Harry loved,--whom\nHarry would have chosen, had he been free to choose. But the comfort\nto be derived from that was very poor. Yes; he had loved her\nonce,--nay, perhaps he loved her still. But when that love was her\nown she had rejected it. She had rejected it, simply declaring to\nhim, to her friends, and to the world at large, that she preferred to\nbe rich. She had her reward, and, bowing her head upon her hands, she\nacknowledged that the punishment was deserved.\n\nHer first step after writing her note to Harry was to send for Mr.\nTurnbull, her lawyer. She had expected to see Harry on the evening of\nthe day on which she had written, but instead of that she received a\nnote from him in which he said that he would come to her before long.\nMr. Turnbull was more instant in obeying her commands, and was with\nher on the morning after he received her injunction. He was almost\na perfect stranger to her, having only seen her once and that for a\nfew moments after her return to England. Her marriage settlements\nhad been prepared for her by Sir Hugh's attorney; but during her\nsojourn in Florence it had become necessary that she should have\nsome one in London to look after her own affairs, and Mr. Turnbull\nhad been recommended to her by lawyers employed by her husband. He\nwas a prudent, sensible man, who recognized it to be his imperative\ninterest to look after his client's interest. And he had done his\nduty by Lady Ongar in that trying time immediately after her return.\nAn offer had then been made by the Courton family to give Julia her\nincome without opposition if she would surrender Ongar Park. To this\nshe had made objections with indignation, and Mr. Turnbull, though he\nhad at first thought that she would be wise to comply with the terms\nproposed, had done her work for her with satisfactory expedition.\nSince those days she had not seen him, but now she had summoned him,\nand he was with her in Bolton Street.\n\n\"I want to speak to you, Mr. Turnbull,\" she said, \"about that place\ndown in Surrey. I don't like it.\"\n\n\"Not like Ongar Park?\" he said. \"I have always heard that it is so\ncharming.\"\n\n\"It is not charming to me. It is a sort of property that I don't\nwant, and I mean to give it up.\"\n\n\"Lord Ongar's uncles would buy your interest in it, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"Exactly. They have sent to me, offering to do so. My brother-in-law,\nSir Hugh Clavering, called on me with a message from them saying\nso. I thought that he was very foolish to come, and so I told him.\nSuch things should be done by one's lawyers. Don't you think so, Mr.\nTurnbull?\" Mr. Turnbull smiled as he declared that, of course, he,\nbeing a lawyer, was of that opinion. \"I am afraid they will have\nthought me uncivil,\" continued Julia, \"as I spoke rather brusquely to\nSir Hugh Clavering. I am not inclined to take any steps through Sir\nHugh Clavering; but I do not know that I have any reason to be angry\nwith the little lord's family.\"\n\n\"Really, Lady Ongar, I think not. When your ladyship returned there\nwas some opposition thought of for a while, but I really do not think\nit was their fault.\"\n\n\"No; it was not their fault.\"\n\n\"That was my feeling at the time; it was indeed.\"\n\n\"It was the fault of Lord Ongar,--of my husband. As regards all\nthe Courtons I have no word of complaint to make. It is not to be\nexpected,--it is not desirable that they and I should be friends.\nIt is impossible, after what has passed, that there should be such\nfriendship. But they have never injured me, and I wish to oblige\nthem. Had Ongar Park suited me I should, doubtless, have kept it; but\nit does not suit me, and they are welcome to have it back again.\"\n\n\"Has a price been named, Lady Ongar?\"\n\n\"No price need be named. There is to be no question of a price. Lord\nOngar's mother is welcome to the place,--or rather to such interest\nas I have in it.\"\n\n\"And to pay a rent?\" suggested Mr. Turnbull.\n\n\"To pay no rent! Nothing would induce me to let the place, or to sell\nmy right in it. I will have no bargain about it. But as nothing also\nwill induce me to live there, I am not such a dog in the manger as to\nwish to keep it. If you will have the kindness to see Mr. Courton's\nlawyer and to make arrangements about it.\"\n\n\"But, Lady Ongar; what you call your right in the estate is worth\nover twenty thousand pounds. It is indeed. You could borrow twenty\nthousand pounds on the security of it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to borrow twenty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"No, no; exactly. Of course you don't. But I point out that fact to\nshow the value. You would be making a present of that sum of money\nto people who do not want it,--who have no claim upon you. I really\ndon't see how they could take it.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Courton wishes to have the place very much.\"\n\n\"But, my lady, she has never thought of getting it without paying\nfor it. Lady Ongar, I really cannot advise you to take any such step\nas that. Indeed, I cannot. I should be wrong, as your lawyer, if\nI did not point out to you that such a proceeding would be quite\nromantic,--quite so; what the world would call Quixotic. People don't\nexpect such things as that. They don't, indeed.\"\n\n\"People don't often have such reasons as I have,\" said Lady Ongar.\nMr. Turnbull sat silent for a while, looking as though he were\nunhappy. The proposition made to him was one which, as a lawyer, he\nfelt to be very distasteful to him. He knew that his client had no\nmale friends in whom she confided, and he felt that the world would\nblame him if he allowed this lady to part with her property in the\nway she had suggested. \"You will find that I am in earnest,\" she\ncontinued, smiling. \"And you may as well give way to my vagaries with\na good grace.\"\n\n\"They would not take it, Lady Ongar.\"\n\n\"At any rate we can try them. If you will make them understand that\nI don't at all want the place, and that it will go to rack and ruin\nbecause there is no one to live there, I am sure they will take it.\"\n\nThen Mr. Turnbull again sat silent and unhappy, thinking with what\nwords he might best bring forward his last and strongest argument\nagainst this rash proceeding.\n\n\"Lady Ongar,\" he said, \"in your peculiar position there are double\nreasons why you should not act in this way.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Turnbull? What is my peculiar position?\"\n\n\"The world will say that you have restored Ongar Park because you\nwere afraid to keep it. Indeed, Lady Ongar, you had better let it\nremain as it is.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for what the world says,\" she exclaimed, rising\nquickly from her chair;--\"nothing; nothing!\"\n\n\"You should really hold by your rights; you should, indeed. Who can\npossibly say what other interests may be concerned? You may marry,\nand live for the next fifty years, and have a family. It is my duty,\nLady Ongar, to point out these things to you.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are quite right, Mr. Turnbull,\" she said, struggling\nto maintain a quiet demeanour. \"You, of course, are only doing your\nduty. But whether I marry or whether I remain as I am, I shall give\nup this place. And as for what the world, as you call it, may say, I\nwill not deny that I cared much for that on my immediate return. What\npeople said then made me very unhappy. But I care nothing for it now.\nI have established my rights, and that has been sufficient. To me\nit seems that the world, as you call it, has been civil enough in\nits usage of me lately. It is only of those who should have been my\nfriends that I have a right to complain. If you will please to do\nthis thing for me, I will be obliged to you.\"\n\n\"If you are quite determined about it--\"\n\n\"I am quite determined. What is the use of the place to me? I never\nshall go there. What is the use even of the money that comes to me?\nI have no purpose for it. I have nothing to do with it.\"\n\nThere was something in her tone as she said this which well filled\nhim with pity.\n\n\"You should remember,\" he said, \"how short a time it is since you\nbecame a widow. Things will be different with you soon.\"\n\n\"My clothes will be different, if you mean that,\" she answered; \"but\nI do not know that there will be any other change in me. But I am\nwrong to trouble you with all this. If you will let Mr. Courton's\nlawyer know, with my compliments to Mrs. Courton, that I have heard\nthat she would like to have the place, and that I do not want it, I\nwill be obliged to you.\" Mr. Turnbull having by this time perceived\nthat she was quite in earnest, took his leave, having promised to do\nher bidding.\n\nIn this interview she had told her lawyer only a part of the plan\nwhich was now running in her head. As for giving up Ongar Park, she\ntook to herself no merit for that. The place had been odious to her\never since she had endeavoured to establish herself there and had\nfound that the clergyman's wife would not speak to her,--that even\nher own housekeeper would hardly condescend to hold converse with\nher. She felt that she would be a dog in the manger to keep the place\nin her own possession. But she had thoughts beyond this,--resolutions\nonly as yet half-formed as to a wider surrender. She had disgraced\nherself, ruined herself, robbed herself of all happiness by the\nmarriage she had made. Her misery had not been simply the misery of\nthat lord's lifetime. As might have been expected, that was soon\nover. But an enduring wretchedness had come after that from which\nshe saw no prospect of escape. What was to be her future life, left\nas she was and would be, in desolation? If she were to give it all\nup,--all the wealth that had been so ill-gotten,--might there not\nthen be some hope of comfort for her?\n\nShe had been willing enough to keep Lord Ongar's money, and use it\nfor the purposes of her own comfort, while she had still hoped that\ncomfort might come from it. The remembrance of all that she had to\ngive had been very pleasant to her, as long as she had hoped that\nHarry Clavering would receive it at her hands. She had not at once\nfelt that the fruit had all turned to ashes. But now,--now that Harry\nwas gone from her,--now that she had no friend left to her whom she\ncould hope to make happy by her munificence,--the very knowledge of\nher wealth was a burden to her. And as she thought of her riches in\nthese first days of her desertion, as she had indeed been thinking\nsince Cecilia Burton had been with her, she came to understand that\nshe was degraded by their acquisition. She had done that which had\nbeen unpardonably bad, and she felt like Judas when he stood with the\nprice of his treachery in his hand. He had given up his money, and\nwould not she do as much? There had been a moment in which she had\nnearly declared all her purpose to the lawyer, but she was held back\nby the feeling that she ought to make her plans certain before she\ncommunicated them to him.\n\nShe must live. She could not go out and hang herself as Judas had\ndone. And then there was her title and rank, of which she did not\nknow whether it was within her power to divest herself. She sorely\nfelt the want of some one from whom in her present need she might\nask counsel; of some friend to whom she could trust to tell her in\nwhat way she might now best atone for the evil she had done. Plans\nran through her head which were thrown aside almost as soon as made,\nbecause she saw that they were impracticable. She even longed in\nthese days for her sister's aid, though of old she had thought but\nlittle of Hermy as a counsellor. She had no friend whom she might\nask;--unless she might still ask Harry Clavering.\n\nIf she did not keep it all might she still keep something,--enough\nfor decent life,--and yet comfort herself with the feeling that she\nhad expiated her sin? And what would be said of her when she had made\nthis great surrender? Would not the world laugh at her instead of\npraising her,--that world as to which she had assured Mr. Turnbull\nthat she did not care what its verdict about her might be? She had\nmany doubts. Ah! why had not Harry Clavering remained true to her?\nBut her punishment had come upon her with all its severity, and she\nacknowledged to herself now that it was not to be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nLADY ONGAR'S REVENGE.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nAt last came the night which Harry had fixed for his visit to Bolton\nStreet. He had looked forward certainly with no pleasure to the\ninterview, and now that the time for it had come, was disposed to\nthink that Lady Ongar had been unwise in asking for it. But he had\npromised that he would go, and there was no possible escape.\n\nHe dined that evening in Onslow Crescent, where he was now again\nestablished with all his old comfort. He had again gone up to the\nchildren's nursery with Cecilia, had kissed them all in their cots,\nand made himself quite at home in the establishment. It was with them\nthere as though there had been no dreadful dream about Lady Ongar. It\nwas so altogether with Cecilia and Florence, and even Mr. Burton was\nallowing himself to be brought round to a charitable view of Harry's\ncharacter. Harry on this day had gone to the chambers in the Adelphi\nfor an hour, and walking away with Theodore Burton had declared his\nintention of working like a horse. \"If you were to say like a man,\nit would perhaps be better,\" said Burton. \"I must leave you to say\nthat,\" answered Harry; \"for the present I will content myself with\nthe horse.\" Burton was willing to hope, and allowed himself once more\nto fall into his old pleasant way of talking about the business as\nthough there were no other subject under the sun so full of manifold\ninterest. He was very keen at the present moment about Metropolitan\nrailways, and was ridiculing the folly of those who feared that the\nrailway projectors were going too fast. \"But we shall never get any\nthanks,\" he said. \"When the thing has been done, and thanks are our\ndue, people will look upon all our work so much as a matter of course\nthat it will never occur to them to think that they owe us anything.\nThey will have forgotten all their cautions, and will take what they\nget as though it were simply their due. Nothing astonishes me so\nmuch as the fear people feel before a thing is done when I join it\nwith their want of surprise or admiration afterwards.\" In this way\neven Theodore Burton had resumed his terms of intimacy with Harry\nClavering.\n\nHarry had told both Cecilia and Florence of his intended visit to\nBolton Street, and they had all become very confidential on the\nsubject. In most such cases we may suppose that a man does not say\nmuch to one woman of the love which another woman has acknowledged\nfor himself. Nor was Harry Clavering at all disposed to make any\nsuch boast. But in this case, Lady Ongar herself had told everything\nto Mrs. Burton. She had declared her passion, and had declared\nalso her intention of making Harry her husband if he would take her.\nEverything was known, and there was no possibility of sparing Lady\nOngar's name.\n\n\"If I had been her I would not have asked for such a meeting,\"\nCecilia said. The three were at this time sitting together, for Mr.\nBurton rarely joined them in their conversation.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Florence. \"I do not see why she and Harry should\nnot remain as friends.\"\n\n\"They might be friends without meeting now,\" said Cecilia.\n\n\"Hardly. If the awkwardness were not got over at once it would never\nbe got over. I almost think she is right, though if I were her\nI should long to have it over.\" That was Florence's judgment in\nthe matter. Harry sat between them, like a sheep as he was, very\nmeekly,--not without some enjoyment of his sheepdom, but still\nfeeling that he was a sheep. At half-past eight he started up, having\nalready been told that a cab was waiting for him at the door. He\npressed Cecilia's hand as he went, indicating his feeling that he had\nbefore him an affair of some magnitude, and then of course had a\nword or two to say to Florence in private on the landing. Oh, those\ndelicious private words, the need for which comes so often during\nthose short halcyon days of one's lifetime! They were so pleasant\nthat Harry would fain have returned to repeat them after he was\nseated in his cab; but the inevitable wheels carried him onwards with\ncruel velocity, and he was in Bolton Street before the minutes had\nsufficed for him to collect his thoughts.\n\n\n[Illustration: Harry sat between them, like a sheep as he was, very\nmeekly.]\n\n\nLady Ongar, when he entered the room, was sitting in her accustomed\nchair, near a little work-table which she always used, and did not\nrise to meet him. It was a pretty chair, soft and easy, made with\na back for lounging, but with no arms to impede the circles of a\nlady's hoop. Harry knew the chair well and had spoken of its graceful\ncomfort in some of his visits to Bolton Street. She was seated there\nwhen he entered; and though he was not sufficiently experienced in\nthe secrets of feminine attire to know at once that she had dressed\nherself with care, he did perceive that she was very charming, not\nonly by force of her own beauty, but by the aid also of her dress.\nAnd yet she was in deep mourning,--in the deepest mourning; nor was\nthere anything about her of which complaint might fairly be made by\nthose who do complain on such subjects. Her dress was high round\nher neck, and the cap on her head was indisputably a widow's cap;\nbut enough of her brown hair was to be seen to tell of its rich\nloveliness; and the black dress was so made as to show the full\nperfection of her form; and with it all there was that graceful\nfeminine brightness that care and money can always give, and\nwhich will not come without care and money. It might be well, she\nhad thought, to surrender her income, and become poor and dowdy\nhereafter, but there could be no reason why Harry Clavering should\nnot be made to know all that he had lost.\n\n\"Well, Harry,\" she said, as he stepped up to her and took her offered\nhand. \"I am glad that you have come that I may congratulate you.\nBetter late than never; eh, Harry?\"\n\nHow was he to answer her when she spoke to him in this strain? \"I\nhope it is not too late,\" he said, hardly knowing what the words were\nwhich were coming from his mouth.\n\n\"Nay; that is for you to say. I can do it heartily, Harry, if you\nmean that. And why not? Why should I not wish you happy? I have\nalways liked you,--have always wished for your happiness. You believe\nthat I am sincere when I congratulate you;--do you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; you are always sincere.\"\n\n\"I have always been so to you. As to any sincerity beyond that we\nneed say nothing now. I have always been your good friend,--to the\nbest of my ability. Ah, Harry; you do not know how much I have\nthought of your welfare; how much I do think of it. But never mind\nthat. Tell me something now of this Florence Burton of yours. Is she\ntall?\" I believe that Lady Ongar, when she asked this question, knew\nwell that Florence was short of stature.\n\n\"No; she is not tall,\" said Harry.\n\n\"What,--a little beauty? Upon the whole I think I agree with your\ntaste. The most lovely women that I have ever seen have been small,\nbright, and perfect in their proportions. It is very rare that a tall\nwoman has a perfect figure.\" Julia's own figure was quite perfect.\n\"Do you remember Constance Vane? Nothing ever exceeded her beauty.\"\nNow Constance Vane,--she at least who had in those days been\nConstance Vane, but who now was the stout mother of two or three\nchildren,--had been a waxen doll of a girl, whom Harry had known, but\nhad neither liked nor admired. But she was highly bred, and belonged\nto the cream of English fashion; she had possessed a complexion as\npure in its tints as are the interior leaves of a blush rose,--and\nshe had never had a thought in her head, and hardly ever a word on\nher lips. She and Florence Burton were as poles asunder in their\ndifferences. Harry felt this at once, and had an indistinct notion\nthat Lady Ongar was as well aware of the fact as was he himself. \"She\nis not a bit like Constance Vane,\" he said.\n\n\"Then what is she like? If she is more beautiful than what Miss Vane\nused to be, she must be lovely indeed.\"\n\n\"She has no pretensions of that kind,\" said Harry, almost sulkily.\n\n\"I have heard that she was so very beautiful!\" Lady Ongar had never\nheard a word about Florence's beauty;--not a word. She knew nothing\npersonally of Florence beyond what Mrs. Burton had told her. But who\nwill not forgive her the little deceit that was necessary to her\nlittle revenge?\n\n\"I don't know how to describe her,\" said Harry. \"I hope the time may\nsoon come when you will see her, and be able to judge for yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope so too. It shall not be my fault if I do not like her.\"\n\n\"I do not think you can fail to like her. She is very clever, and\nthat will go further with you than mere beauty. Not but what I think\nher very,--very pretty.\"\n\n\"Ah,--I understand. She reads a great deal, and that sort of thing.\nYes; that is very nice. But I shouldn't have thought that that\nwould have taken you. You used not to care much for talent and\nlearning,--not in women I mean.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Harry, looking very foolish.\n\n\"But a contrast is what you men always like. Of course I ought not\nto say that, but you will know of what I am thinking. A clever,\nhighly-educated woman like Miss Burton will be a much better\ncompanion to you than I could have been. You see I am very frank,\nHarry.\" She wished to make him talk freely about himself, his future\ndays, and his past days, while he was simply anxious to say on these\nsubjects as little as possible. Poor woman! The excitement of having\na passion which she might indulge was over with her,--at any rate for\nthe present. She had played her game and had lost wofully; but before\nshe retired altogether from the gaming-table she could not keep\nherself from longing for a last throw of the dice.\n\n\"These things, I fear, go very much by chance,\" said Harry.\n\n\"You do not mean me to suppose that you are taking Miss Burton by\nchance. That would be as uncomplimentary to her as to yourself.\"\n\n\"Chance, at any rate, has been very good to me in this instance.\"\n\n\"Of that I am sure. Do not suppose that I am doubting that. It is\nnot only the paradise that you have gained, but the pandemonium\nthat you have escaped!\" Then she laughed slightly, but the laughter\nwas uneasy, and made her angry with herself. She had especially\ndetermined to be at ease during this meeting, and was conscious that\nany falling off in that respect on her part would put into his hands\nthe power which she was desirous of exercising.\n\n\"You are determined to rebuke me, I see,\" said he. \"If you choose to\ndo so, I am prepared to bear it. My defence, if I have a defence, is\none that I cannot use.\"\n\n\"And what would be your defence?\"\n\n\"I have said that I cannot use it.\"\n\n\"As if I did not understand it all! What you mean to say is\nthis,--that when your good stars sent you in the way of Florence\nBurton, you had been ill-treated by her who would have made your\npandemonium for you, and that she therefore,--she who came first and\nbehaved so badly--can have no right to find fault with you in that\nyou have obeyed your good stars and done so well for yourself. That\nis what you call your defence. It would be perfect, Harry,--perfect,\nif you had only whispered to me a word of Miss Burton when I first\nsaw you after my return home. It is odd to me that you should not\nhave written to me and told me when I was abroad with my husband.\nIt would have comforted me to have known that the wound which I had\ngiven had been cured;--that is, if there was a wound.\"\n\n\"You know that there was a wound.\"\n\n\"At any rate, it was not mortal. But when are such wounds mortal?\nWhen are they more than skin-deep?\"\n\n\"I can say nothing as to that now.\"\n\n\"No, Harry; of course you can say nothing. Why should you be made\nto say anything? You are fortunate and happy, and have all that you\nwant. I have nothing that I want.\"\n\nThere was a reality in the tone of sorrow in which this was spoken\nwhich melted him at once;--and the more so in that there was so much\nin her grief which could not but be flattering to his vanity. \"Do not\nsay that, Lady Ongar,\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"But I do say it. What have I got in the world that is worth having?\nMy possessions are ever so many thousands a year,--and a damaged\nname.\"\n\n\"I deny that. I deny it altogether. I do not think that there is one\nwho knows of your story who believes ill of you.\"\n\n\"I could tell you of one, Harry, who thinks very ill of me;--nay, of\ntwo; and they are both in this room. Do you remember how you used to\nteach me that terribly conceited bit of Latin,--Nil conscire sibi? Do\nyou suppose that I can boast that I never grow pale as I think of my\nown fault? I am thinking of it always, and my heart is ever becoming\npaler and paler. And as to the treatment of others;--I wish I could\nmake you know what I suffered when I was fool enough to go to that\nplace in Surrey. The coachman who drives me no doubt thinks that I\npoisoned my husband, and the servant who let you in just now supposes\nme to be an abandoned woman because you are here.\"\n\n\"You will be angry with me, perhaps, if I say that these feelings are\nmorbid and will die away. They show the weakness which has come from\nthe ill-usage you have suffered.\"\n\n\"You are right in part, no doubt. I shall become hardened to it all,\nand shall fall into some endurable mode of life in time. But I can\nlook forward to nothing. What future have I? Was there ever any one\nso utterly friendless as I am? Your kind cousin has done that for\nme;--and yet he came here to me the other day, smiling and talking as\nthough he were sure that I should be delighted by his condescension.\nI do not think that he will ever come again.\"\n\n\"I did not know you had seen him.\"\n\n\"Yes; I saw him;--but I did not find much relief from his visit. We\nwon't mind that, however. We can talk about something better than\nHugh Clavering during the few minutes that we have together;--can we\nnot? And so Miss Burton is very learned and very clever?\"\n\n\"I did not quite say that.\"\n\n\"But I know she is. What a comfort that will be to you! I am not\nclever, and I never should have become learned. Oh, dear! I had but\none merit, Harry;--I was fond of you.\"\n\n\"And how did you show it?\" He did not speak these words, because he\nwould not triumph over her, nor was he willing to express that regret\non his own part which these words would have implied;--but it was\nimpossible for him to avoid a thought of them. He remained silent,\ntherefore, taking up some toy from the table into his hands, as\nthough that would occupy his attention.\n\n\"But what a fool I am to talk of it;--am I not? And I am worse\nthan a fool. I was thinking of you when I stood up in church to be\nmarried;--thinking of that offer of your little savings. I used to\nthink of you at every harsh word that I endured;--of your modes of\nlife when I sat through those terrible nights by that poor creature's\nbed;--of you when I knew that the last day was coming. I thought of\nyou always, Harry, when I counted up my gains. I never count them\nup now. Ah, how I thought of you when I came to this house in the\ncarriage which you had provided for me, when I had left you at the\nstation almost without speaking a word to you! I should have been\nmore gracious had I not had you in my thoughts throughout my whole\njourney home from Florence. And after that I had some comfort in\nbelieving that the price of my shame might make you rich without\nshame. Oh, Harry, I have been disappointed! You will never understand\nwhat I felt when first that evil woman told me of Miss Burton.\"\n\n\"Oh, Julia, what am I to say?\"\n\n\"You can say nothing; but I wonder that you had not told me.\"\n\n\"How could I tell you? Would it not have seemed that I was vain\nenough to have thought of putting you on your guard?\"\n\n\"And why not? But never mind. Do not suppose that I am rebuking you.\nAs I said in my letter, we are quits now, and there is no place for\nscolding on either side. We are quits now; but I am punished and you\nare rewarded.\"\n\nOf course he could not answer this. Of course he was hard pressed\nfor words. Of course he could neither acknowledge that he had been\nrewarded, nor assert that a share of the punishment of which she\nspoke had fallen upon him also. This was the revenge with which she\nhad intended to attack him. That she should think that he had in\ntruth been punished and not rewarded, was very natural. Had he been\nless quick in forgetting her after her marriage, he would have had\nhis reward without any punishment. If such were her thoughts, who\nshall quarrel with her on that account?\n\n\"I have been very frank with you,\" she continued. \"Indeed, why should\nI not be so? People talk of a lady's secret, but my secret has been\nno secret from you? That I was made to tell it under,--under,--what I\nwill call an error,--was your fault; and it is that that has made us\nquits.\"\n\n\"I know that I have behaved badly to you.\"\n\n\"But then unfortunately you know also that I had deserved bad\ntreatment. Well; we will say no more about it. I have been very\ncandid with you, but then I have injured no one by my candour. You\nhave not said a word to me in reply; but then your tongue is tied\nby your duty to Miss Burton,--your duty and your love together, of\ncourse. It is all as it should be, and now I will have done. When are\nyou to be married, Harry?\"\n\n\"No time has been fixed. I am a very poor man, you know.\"\n\n\"Alas, alas,--yes. When mischief is done, how badly all the things\nturn out. You are poor and I am rich, and yet we cannot help each\nother.\"\n\n\"I fear not.\"\n\n\"Unless I could adopt Miss Burton, and be a sort of mother to her.\nYou would shrink, however, from any such guardianship on my part. But\nyou are clever, Harry, and can work when you please, and will make\nyour way. If Miss Burton keeps you waiting now by any prudent fear on\nher part, I shall not think so well of her as I am inclined to do.\"\n\n\"The Burtons are all prudent people.\"\n\n\"Tell her, from me, with my love,--not to be too prudent. I thought\nto be prudent, and see what has come of it.\"\n\n\"I will tell her what you say.\"\n\n\"Do, please; and, Harry, look here. Will she accept a little present\nfrom me? You, at any rate, for my sake, will ask her to do so. Give\nher this,--it is only a trifle,\"--and she put her hand on a small\njeweller's box, which was close to her arm upon the table, \"and tell\nher,--of course she knows all our story, Harry?\"\n\n\"Yes; she knows it all.\"\n\n\"Tell her that she whom you have rejected sends it with her kindest\nwishes to her whom you have taken.\"\n\n\"No; I will not tell her that.\"\n\n\"Why not? It is all true. I have not poisoned the little ring, as the\nladies would have done some centuries since. They were grander then\nthan we are now, and perhaps hardly worse, though more cruel. You\nwill bid her take it,--will you not?\"\n\n\"I am sure she will take it without bidding on my part.\"\n\n\"And tell her not to write me any thanks. She and I will both\nunderstand that that had better be omitted. If, when I shall see her\nat some future time as your wife, it shall be on her finger, I shall\nknow that I am thanked.\" Then Harry rose to go. \"I did not mean by\nthat to turn you out, but perhaps it may be as well. I have no more\nto say,--and as for you, you cannot but wish that the penance should\nbe over.\" Then he pressed her hand, and with some muttered farewell,\nbade her adieu. Again she did not rise from her chair, but nodding at\nhim with a sweet smile, let him go without another word.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nSHEWING WHAT HAPPENED OFF HELIGOLAND.\n\n\nDuring the six weeks after this, Harry Clavering settled down to\nhis work at the chambers in the Adelphi with exemplary diligence.\nFlorence, having remained a fortnight in town after Harry's return\nto the sheepfold, and having accepted Lady Ongar's present,--not\nwithout a long and anxious consultation with her sister-in-law on\nthe subject,--had returned in fully restored happiness to Stratton.\nMrs. Burton was at Ramsgate with the children, and Mr. Burton was in\nRussia with reference to a line of railway which was being projected\nfrom Moscow to Astracan. It was now September, and Harry, in his\nletters home, declared that he was the only person left in London.\nIt was hard upon him,--much harder than it was upon the Wallikers\nand other young men whom fate retained in town, for Harry was a man\ngiven to shooting,--a man accustomed to pass the autumnal months in a\ncountry house. And then, if things had chanced to go one way instead\nof another, he would have had his own shooting down at Ongar Park\nwith his own friends,--admiring him at his heels; or if not so this\nyear, he would have been shooting elsewhere with the prospect of\nthese rich joys for years to come. As it was, he had promised to\nstick to the shop, and was sticking to it manfully. Nor do I think\nthat he allowed his mind to revert to those privileges which might\nhave been his at all more frequently than any of my readers would\nhave done in his place. He was sticking to the shop, and though he\ngreatly disliked the hot desolation of London in those days, being\nabsolutely afraid to frequent his club at such a period of the\nyear,--and though he hated Walliker mortally,--he was fully resolved\nto go on with his work. Who could tell what might be his fate?\nPerhaps in another ten years he might be carrying that Russian\nrailway on through the deserts of Siberia. Then there came to him\nsuddenly tidings which disturbed all his resolutions, and changed the\nwhole current of his life.\n\nAt first there came a telegram to him from the country, desiring\nhim to go down at once to Clavering, but not giving him any reason.\nAdded to the message were these words,--\"We are all well at the\nparsonage;\"--words evidently added in thoughtfulness. But before he\nhad left the office there came to him there a young man from the bank\nat which his cousin Hugh kept his account, telling him the tidings\nto which the telegram no doubt referred. Jack Stuart's boat had been\nlost, and his two cousins had gone to their graves beneath the sea!\nThe master of the boat, and Stuart himself, with a boy, had been\nsaved. The other sailors whom they had with them, and the ship's\nsteward, had perished with the Claverings. Stuart, it seemed, had\ncaused tidings of the accident to be sent to the rector of Clavering\nand to Sir Hugh's bankers. At the bank they had ascertained that\ntheir late customer's cousin was in town, and their messenger had\nthereupon been sent, first to Bloomsbury Square, and from thence to\nthe Adelphi.\n\nHarry had never loved his cousins. The elder he had greatly disliked,\nand the younger he would have disliked had he not despised him. But\nnot the less on that account was he inexpressibly shocked when he\nfirst heard what had happened. The lad said that there could, as he\nimagined, be no mistake. The message had come, as he believed, from\nHolland, but of that he was not certain. There could, however, be no\ndoubt about the fact. It distinctly stated that both brothers had\nperished. Harry had known when he received the message from home,\nthat no train would take him till three in the afternoon, and had\ntherefore remained at the office; but he could not remain now. His\nhead was confused, and he could hardly bring himself to think how\nthis matter would affect himself. When he attempted to explain his\nabsence to an old serious clerk there, he spoke of his own return\nto the office as certain. He should be back, he supposed, in a week\nat the furthest. He was thinking then of his promises to Theodore\nBurton, and had not begun to realize the fact that his whole destiny\nin life would be changed. He said something, with a long face, of\nthe terrible misfortune which had occurred, but gave no hint that\nthat misfortune would be important in its consequences to himself. It\nwas not till he had reached his lodgings in Bloomsbury Square that\nhe remembered that his own father was now the baronet, and that he\nwas his father's heir. And then for a moment he thought about the\nproperty. He believed that it was entailed, but even of that he was\nnot certain. But if it were unentailed, to whom could his cousin have\nleft it? He endeavoured, however, to expel such thoughts from his\nmind, as though there was something ungenerous in entertaining them.\nHe tried to think of the widow, but even in doing that he could not\ntell himself that there was much ground for genuine sorrow. No wife\nhad ever had less joy from her husband's society than Lady Clavering\nhad had from that of Sir Hugh. There was no child to mourn the\nloss,--no brother, no unmarried sister. Sir Hugh had had friends,--as\nfriendship goes with such men; but Harry could not but doubt whether\namong them all there would be one who would feel anything like true\ngrief for his loss. And it was the same with Archie. Who in the world\nwould miss Archie Clavering? What man or woman would find the world\nto be less bright because Archie Clavering was sleeping beneath the\nwaves? Some score of men at his club would talk of poor Clavvy for\na few days,--would do so without any pretence at the tenderness\nof sorrow; and then even of Archie's memory there would be an end.\nThinking of all this as he was carried down to Clavering, Harry could\nnot but acknowledge that the loss to the world had not been great;\nbut, even while telling himself this, he would not allow himself to\ntake comfort in the prospect of his heirship. Once, perhaps, he did\nspeculate how Florence should bear her honours as Lady Clavering; but\nthis idea he swept away from his thoughts as quickly as he was able.\n\nThe tidings had reached the parsonage very late on the previous\nnight; so late that the rector had been disturbed in his bed to\nreceive them. It was his duty to make known to Lady Clavering the\nfact that she was a widow, but this he could not do till the next\nmorning. But there was little sleep that night for him or for his\nwife! He knew well enough that the property was entailed. He felt\nwith sufficient strength what it was to become a baronet at a sudden\nblow, and to become also the owner of the whole Clavering property.\nHe was not slow to think of the removal to the great house, of the\naltered prospects of his son, and of the mode of life which would\nbe fitting for himself in future. Before the morning came he had\nmeditated who should be the future rector of Clavering, and had\nmade some calculations as to the expediency of resuming his hunting.\nNot that he was a heartless man,--or that he rejoiced at what had\nhappened. But a man's ideas of generosity change as he advances in\nage, and the rector was old enough to tell himself boldly that this\nthing that had happened could not be to him a cause of much grief. He\nhad never loved his cousins, or pretended to love them. His cousin's\nwife he did love, after a fashion, but in speaking to his own wife\nof the way in which this tragedy would affect Hermione, he did not\nscruple to speak of her widowhood as a period of coming happiness.\n\n\"She will be cut to pieces,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"She was attached\nto him as earnestly as though he had treated her always well.\"\n\n\"I believe it; but not the less will she feel her release,\nunconsciously; and her life, which has been very wretched, will\ngradually become easy to her.\"\n\nEven Mrs. Clavering could not deny that this would be so, and then\nthey reverted to matters which more closely concerned themselves. \"I\nsuppose Harry will marry at once now,\" said the mother.\n\n\"No doubt;--it is almost a pity; is it not?\" The rector,--as we will\nstill call him,--was thinking that Florence was hardly a fitting wife\nfor his son with his altered prospects. Ah, what a grand thing it\nwould have been if the Clavering property and Lady Ongar's jointure\ncould have gone together!\n\n\"Not a pity at all,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"You will find that\nFlorence will make him a very happy man.\"\n\n\"I dare say;--I dare say. Only he would hardly have taken her had\nthis sad accident happened before he saw her. But if she will make\nhim happy that is everything. I have never thought much about\nmoney myself. If I find any comfort in these tidings it is for his\nsake, not for my own. I would sooner remain as I am.\" This was not\naltogether untrue, and yet he was thinking of the big house and the\nhunting.\n\n\"What will be done about the living?\" It was early in the morning\nwhen Mrs. Clavering asked this question. She had thought much about\nthe living during the night. And so had the rector;--but his thoughts\nhad not run in the same direction as hers. He made no immediate\nanswer, and then she went on with her question. \"Do you think that\nyou will keep it in your own hands?\"\n\n\"Well,--no; why should I? I am too idle about it as it is. I should\nbe more so under these altered circumstances.\"\n\n\"I am sure you would do your duty if you resolved to keep it, but I\ndon't see why you should do so.\"\n\n\"Clavering is a great deal better than Humbleton,\" said the rector.\nHumbleton was the name of the parish held by Mr. Fielding, his\nson-in-law.\n\nBut the idea here put forward did not suit the idea which was running\nin Mrs. Clavering's mind. \"Edward and Mary are very well off,\" she\nsaid. \"His own property is considerable, and I don't think they want\nanything. Besides, he would hardly like to give up a family living.\"\n\n\"I might ask him at any rate.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of Mr. Saul,\" said Mrs. Clavering boldly.\n\n\"Of Mr. Saul!\" The image of Mr. Saul, as rector of Clavering,\nperplexed the new baronet egregiously.\n\n\"Well;--yes. He is an excellent; clergyman. No one can deny that.\"\nThen there was silence between them for a few moments. \"In that case\nhe and Fanny would of course marry. It is no good concealing the fact\nthat she is very fond of him.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I can't understand it,\" said the rector.\n\n\"It is so,--and as to the excellence of his character there can be\nno doubt.\" To this the rector made no answer, but went away into his\ndressing-room, that he might prepare himself for his walk across the\npark to the great house. While they were discussing who should be the\nfuture incumbent of the living, Lady Clavering was still sleeping in\nunconsciousness of her fate. Mr. Clavering greatly dreaded the task\nwhich was before him, and had made a little attempt to induce his\nwife to take the office upon herself; but she had explained to him\nthat it would be more seemly that he should be the bearer of the\ntidings. \"It would seem that you were wanting in affection for her if\nyou do not go yourself,\" his wife had said to him. That the rector of\nClavering was master of himself and of his own actions, no one who\nknew the family ever denied, but the instances in which he declined\nto follow his wife's advice were not many.\n\nIt was about eight o'clock when he went across the park. He had\nalready sent a messenger with a note to beg that Lady Clavering\nwould be up to receive him. As he would come very early, he had said,\nperhaps she would see him in her own room. The poor lady had, of\ncourse, been greatly frightened by this announcement; but this fear\nhad been good for her, as they had well understood at the rectory;\nthe blow, dreadfully sudden as it must still be, would be somewhat\nless sudden under this preparation. When Mr. Clavering reached\nthe house the servant was in waiting to show him upstairs to the\nsitting-room which Lady Clavering usually occupied when alone. She\nhad been there waiting for him for the last half-hour.\n\n\"Mr. Clavering, what is it?\" she exclaimed, as he entered with\ntidings of death written on his visage. \"In the name of heaven, what\nis it? You have something to tell me of Hugh.\"\n\n\"Dear Hermione,\" he said, taking her by the hand.\n\n\"What is it? Tell me at once. Is he still alive?\"\n\nThe rector still held her by the hand, but spoke no word. He had been\ntrying as he came across the park to arrange the words in which he\nshould tell his tale, but now it was told without any speech on his\npart.\n\n\"He is dead. Why do you not speak? Why are you so cruel?\"\n\n\"Dearest Hermione, what am I to say to comfort you?\"\n\nWhat he might say after this was of little moment, for she had\nfainted. He rang the bell, and then, when the servants were\nthere,--the old housekeeper and Lady Clavering's maid,--he told to\nthem, rather than to her, what had been their master's fate.\n\n\"And Captain Archie?\" asked the housekeeper.\n\nThe rector shook his head, and the housekeeper knew that the rector\nwas now the baronet. Then they took the poor widow to her own\nroom,--should I not rather call her, as I may venture to speak the\ntruth, the enfranchised slave than the poor widow?--and the rector,\ntaking up his hat, promised that he would send his wife across to\ntheir mistress. His morning's task had been painful, but it had been\neasily accomplished. As he walked home among the oaks of Clavering\nPark, he told himself, no doubt, that they were now all his own.\n\nThat day at the rectory was very sombre, if it was not actually sad.\nThe greater part of the morning Mrs. Clavering passed with the widow,\nand sitting near her sofa she wrote sundry letters to those who were\nconnected with the family. The longest of these was to Lady Ongar,\nwho was now at Tenby; and in that there was a pressing request from\nHermione that her sister would come to her at Clavering Park. \"Tell\nher,\" said Lady Clavering, \"that all her anger must be over now.\" But\nMrs. Clavering said nothing of Julia's anger. She merely urged the\nrequest that Julia would come to her sister. \"She will be sure to\ncome,\" said Mrs. Clavering. \"You need have no fear on that head.\"\n\n\"But how can I invite her here, when the house is not my own?\"\n\n\"Pray do not talk in that way, Hermione. The house will be your own\nfor any time that you may want it. Your husband's relations are your\ndear friends; are they not?\" But this allusion to her husband brought\nher to another fit of hysterical tears. \"Both of them gone,\" she\nsaid. \"Both of them gone!\" Mrs. Clavering knew well that she was not\nalluding to the two brothers, but to her husband and to her baby. Of\npoor Archie no one had said a word,--beyond that one word spoken by\nthe housekeeper. For her, it had been necessary that she should know\nwho was now the master of Clavering Park.\n\nTwice in the day Mrs. Clavering went over to the big house, and on\nher second return, late in the evening, she found her son. When she\narrived, there had already been some few words on the subject between\nhim and his father.\n\n\"You have heard of it, Harry?\"\n\n\"Yes; a clerk came to me from the banker's.\"\n\n\"Dreadful; is it not? Quite terrible to think of!\"\n\n\"Indeed it is, sir. I was never so shocked in my life.\"\n\n\"He would go in that cursed boat, though I know that he was advised\nagainst it,\" said the father, holding up his hands and shaking his\nhead. \"And now both of them gone;--both gone at once!\"\n\n\"How does she bear it?\"\n\n\"Your mother is with her now. When I went in the morning,--I had\nwritten a line, and she expected bad news,--she fainted. Of course,\nI could do nothing. I can hardly say that I told her. She asked the\nquestion, and then saw by my face that her fears were well-founded.\nUpon my word, I was glad when she did faint;--it was the best thing\nfor her.\"\n\n\"It must have been very painful for you.\"\n\n\"Terrible;--terrible;\" and the rector shook his head. \"It will make a\ngreat difference in your prospects, Harry.\"\n\n\"And in your life, sir! So to say, you are as young a man as myself.\"\n\n\"Am I? I believe I was about as young when you were born. But I don't\nthink at all about myself in this matter. I am too old to care to\nchange my manner of living. It won't affect me very much. Indeed, I\nhardly know yet how it may affect me. Your mother thinks I ought to\ngive up the living. If you were in orders, Harry--\"\n\n\"I'm very glad, sir, that I am not.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. And there is no need; certainly, there is no need. You\nwill be able to do pretty nearly what you like about the property. I\nshall not care to interfere.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will, sir. It feels strange now, but you will soon get used\nto it. I wonder whether he left a will.\"\n\n\"It can't make any difference to you, you know. Every acre of the\nproperty is entailed. She has her settlement. Eight hundred a year,\nI think it is. She'll not be a rich woman like her sister. I wonder\nwhere she'll live. As far as that goes, she might stay at the house,\nif she likes it. I'm sure your mother wouldn't object.\"\n\nHarry on this occasion asked no question about the living, but he\nalso had thought of that. He knew well that his mother would befriend\nMr. Saul, and he knew also that his father would ultimately take his\nmother's advice. As regarded himself he had no personal objection to\nMr. Saul, though he could not understand how his sister should feel\nany strong regard for such a man.\n\nEdward Fielding would make a better neighbour at the parsonage, and\nthen he thought whether an exchange might not be made. After that,\nand before his mother's return from the great house, he took a stroll\nthrough the park with Fanny. Fanny altogether declined to discuss any\nof the family prospects, as they were affected by the accident which\nhad happened. To her mind the tragedy was so terrible that she could\nonly feel its tragic element. No doubt she had her own thoughts about\nMr. Saul as connected with it. \"What would he think of this sudden\ndeath of the two brothers? How would he feel it? If she could be\nallowed to talk to him on the matter, what would he say of their\nfate here and hereafter? Would he go to the great house to offer the\nconsolations of religion to the widow?\" Of all this she thought much;\nbut no picture of Mr. Saul as rector of Clavering, or of herself as\nmistress in her mother's house, presented itself to her mind. Harry\nfound her to be a dull companion, and he, perhaps, consoled himself\nwith some personal attention to the oak trees. The trees loomed\nlarger upon him now than they had ever done before.\n\nOn the third day the rector went up to London, leaving Harry at the\nparsonage. It was necessary that lawyers should be visited, and\nthat such facts as to the loss should be proved as were capable of\nproof. There was no doubt at all as to the fate of Sir Hugh and his\nbrother. The escape of Mr. Stuart and of two of those employed by him\nprevented the possibility of a doubt. The vessel had been caught in a\ngale off Heligoland, and had foundered. They had all striven to get\ninto the yacht's boat, but those who had succeeded in doing so had\ngone down. The master of the yacht had seen the two brothers perish.\nThose who were saved had been picked up off the spars to which they\nhad attached themselves. There was no doubt in the way of the new\nbaronet, and no difficulty.\n\nNor was there any will made either by Sir Hugh or his brother. Poor\nArchie had nothing to leave, and that he should have left no will was\nnot remarkable. But neither had there been much in the power of Sir\nHugh to bequeath, nor was there any great cause for a will on his\npart. Had he left a son, his son would have inherited everything. He\nhad, however, died childless, and his wife was provided for by her\nsettlement. On his marriage he had made the amount settled as small\nas his wife's friends would accept, and no one who knew the man\nexpected that he would increase the amount after his death. Having\nbeen in town for three days the rector returned,--being then in full\npossession of the title; but this he did not assume till after the\nsecond Sunday from the date of the telegram which brought the news.\n\nIn the meantime Harry had written to Florence, to whom the tidings\nwere as important as to any one concerned. She had left London very\ntriumphant,--quite confident that she had nothing now to fear from\nLady Ongar or from any other living woman, having not only forgiven\nHarry his sins, but having succeeded also in persuading herself\nthat there had been no sins to forgive,--having quarrelled with her\nbrother half-a-dozen times in that he would not accept her arguments\non this matter. He too would forgive Harry,--had forgiven him; was\nquite ready to omit all further remark on the matter; but could not\nbring himself when urged by Florence to admit that her Apollo had\nbeen altogether godlike. Florence had thus left London in triumph,\nbut she had gone with a conviction that she and Harry must remain\napart for some indefinite time, which probably must be measured by\nyears. \"Let us see at the end of two years,\" she had said; and Harry\nhad been forced to be content. But how would it be with her now?\n\nHarry of course began his letter by telling her of the catastrophe,\nwith the usual amount of epithets. It was very terrible, awful,\nshocking,--the saddest thing that had ever happened! The poor widow\nwas in a desperate state, and all the Claverings were nearly beside\nthemselves. But when this had been duly said, he allowed himself\nto go into their own home question. \"I cannot fail,\" he wrote, \"to\nthink of this chiefly as it concerns you,--or rather, as it concerns\nmyself in reference to you. I suppose I shall leave the business now.\nIndeed, my father seems to think that my remaining there would be\nabsurd, and my mother agrees with him. As I am the only son, the\nproperty will enable me to live easily without a profession. When I\nsay 'me,' of course you will understand what 'me' means. The better\npart of 'me' is so prudent, that I know she will not accept this\nview of things without ever so much consideration, and, therefore,\nshe must come to Clavering to hear it discussed by the elders. For\nmyself, I cannot bear to think that I should take delight in the\nresults of this dreadful misfortune; but how am I to keep myself from\nbeing made happy by the feeling that we may now be married without\nfurther delay? After all that has passed, nothing will make me happy\nor even permanently comfortable till I can call you fairly my own. My\nmother has already said that she hopes you will come here in about a\nfortnight,--that is, as soon as we shall have fallen tolerably into\nour places again; but she will write herself before that time. I\nhave written a line to your brother addressed to the office, which I\nsuppose will find him. I have written also to Cecilia. Your brother,\nno doubt, will hear the news first through the French newspapers.\"\nThen he said a little, but a very little, as to their future modes\nof life, just intimating to her, and no more, that her destiny might\nprobably call upon her to be the mother of a future baronet.\n\nThe news had reached Clavering on a Saturday. On the following Sunday\nevery one in the parish had no doubt heard of it, but nothing on the\nsubject was said in church on that day. The rector remained at home\nduring the morning, and the whole service was performed by Mr. Saul.\nBut on the second Sunday Mr. Fielding had come over from Humbleton,\nand he preached a sermon on the loss which the parish had sustained\nin the sudden death of the two brothers. It is, perhaps, well that\nsuch sermons should be preached. The inhabitants of Clavering would\nhave felt that their late lords had been treated like dogs, had no\nword been said of them in the house of God. The nature of their fate\nhad forbidden even the common ceremony of a burial service. It is\nwell that some respect should be maintained from the low in station\ntowards those who are high, even when no respect has been deserved.\nAnd, for the widow's sake, it was well that some notice should be\ntaken in Clavering of this death of the head of the Claverings. But\nI should not myself have liked the duty of preaching an eulogistic\nsermon on the lives and death of Hugh Clavering and his brother\nArchie. What had either of them ever done to merit a good word from\nany man, or to earn the love of any woman? That Sir Hugh had been\nloved by his wife had come from the nature of the woman, not at all\nfrom the qualities of the man. Both of the brothers had lived on\nthe unexpressed theory of consuming, for the benefit of their own\nbacks and their own bellies, the greatest possible amount of those\ngood things which fortune might put in their way. I doubt whether\neither of them had ever contributed anything willingly to the comfort\nor happiness of any human being. Hugh, being powerful by nature\nand having a strong will, had tyrannized over all those who were\nsubject to him. Archie, not gifted as was his brother, had been\nmilder, softer, and less actively hateful; but his principle of\naction had been the same. Everything for himself! Was it not well\nthat two such men should be consigned to the fishes, and that the\nworld,--especially the Clavering world, and that poor widow, who\nnow felt herself to be so inexpressibly wretched when her period of\ncomfort was in truth only commencing,--was it not well that the world\nand Clavering should be well quit of them? That idea is the one which\none would naturally have felt inclined to put into one's sermon on\nsuch an occasion; and then to sing some song of rejoicing;--either to\ndo that, or to leave the matter alone.\n\nBut not so are such sermons preached; and not after that fashion\ndid the young clergyman who had married the first-cousin of these\nClaverings buckle himself to the subject. He indeed had, I think, but\nlittle difficulty, either inwardly with his conscience, or outwardly\nwith his subject. He possessed the power of a pleasant, easy flow of\nwords, and of producing tears, if not from other eyes, at any rate\nfrom his own. He drew a picture of the little ship amidst the storm,\nand of God's hand as it moved in its anger upon the waters; but of\nthe cause of that divine wrath and its direction he said nothing.\nThen, of the suddenness of death and its awfulness he said much, not\ninsisting as he did so on the necessity of repentance for salvation,\nas far as those two poor sinners were concerned. No, indeed;--how\ncould any preacher have done that? But he improved the occasion by\ntelling those around him that they should so live as to be ever ready\nfor the hand of death. If that were possible, where then indeed would\nbe the victory of the grave? And at last he came to the master and\nlord whom they had lost. Even here there was no difficulty for him.\nThe heir had gone first, and then the father and his brother. Who\namong them would not pity the bereaved mother and the widow? Who\namong them would not remember with affection the babe whom they had\nseen at that font, and with respect the landlord under whose rule\nthey had lived? How pleasant it must be to ask those questions which\nno one can rise to answer! Farmer Gubbins as he sat by, listening\nwith what power of attention had been vouchsafed to him, felt himself\nto be somewhat moved, but soon released himself from the task, and\nallowed his mind to run away into other ideas. The rector was a\nkindly man and a generous. The rector would allow him to enclose that\nlittle bit of common land, that was to be taken in, without adding\nanything to his rent. The rector would be there on audit days, and\nthings would be very pleasant. Farmer Gubbins, when the slight\nmurmuring gurgle of the preacher's tears was heard, shook his\nown head by way of a responsive wail; but at that moment he was\ncongratulating himself on the coming comfort of the new reign. Mr.\nFielding, however, got great credit for his sermon; and it did,\nprobably, more good than harm,--unless, indeed, we should take into\nour calculation, in giving our award on this subject, the permanent\nutility of all truth, and the permanent injury of all falsehood.\n\nMr. Fielding remained at the parsonage during the greater part of\nthe following week, and then there took place a great deal of family\nconversation respecting the future incumbent of the living. At these\nfamily conclaves, however, Fanny was not asked to be present. Mrs.\nClavering, who knew well how to do such work, was gradually bringing\nher husband round to endure the name of Mr. Saul. Twenty times had\nhe asserted that he could not understand it; but, whether or no such\nunderstanding might ever be possible, he was beginning to recognize\nit as true that the thing not understood was a fact. His daughter\nFanny was positively in love with Mr. Saul, and that to such an\nextent that her mother believed her happiness to be involved in it.\n\"I can't understand it;--upon my word I can't,\" said the rector for\nthe last time, and then he gave way. There was now the means of\ngiving an ample provision for the lovers, and that provision was to\nbe given.\n\nMr. Fielding shook his head,--not in this instance as to Fanny's\npredilection for Mr. Saul; though in discussing that matter with his\nown wife he had shaken his head very often; but he shook it now with\nreference to the proposed change. He was very well where he was. And\nalthough Clavering was better than Humbleton, it was not so much\nbetter as to induce him to throw his own family over by proposing to\nsend Mr. Saul among them. Mr. Saul was an excellent clergyman, but\nperhaps his uncle, who had given him his living, might not like Mr.\nSaul. Thus it was decided in these conclaves that Mr. Saul was to be\nthe future rector of Clavering.\n\nIn the meantime poor Fanny moped,--wretched in her solitude,\nanticipating no such glorious joys as her mother was preparing for\nher; and Mr. Saul was preparing with energy for his departure into\nforeign parts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nIS SHE MAD?\n\n\nLady Ongar was at Tenby when she received Mrs. Clavering's letter,\nand had not heard of the fate of her brother-in-law till the news\nreached her in that way. She had gone down to a lodging at Tenby\nwith no attendant but one maid, and was preparing herself for the\ngreat surrender of her property which she meditated. Hitherto she had\nheard nothing from the Courtons or their lawyer as to the offer she\nhad made about Ongar Park; but the time had been short, and lawyers'\nwork, as she knew, was never done in a hurry. She had gone to Tenby,\nflying, in truth, from the loneliness of London to the loneliness\nof the sea-shore,--but expecting she knew not what comfort from the\nchange. She would take with her no carriage, and there would, as she\nthought, be excitement even in that. She would take long walks by\nherself;--she would read;--nay, if possible, she would study and\nbring herself to some habits of industry. Hitherto she had failed in\neverything, but now she would try if some mode of success might not\nbe open to her. She would ascertain, too, on what smallest sum she\ncould live respectably and without penury, and would keep only so\nmuch out of Lord Ongar's wealth.\n\nBut hitherto her life at Tenby had not been successful. Solitary days\nwere longer there even than they had been in London. People stared\nat her more; and, though she did not own it to herself, she missed\ngreatly the comforts of her London house. As for reading, I doubt\nwhether she did much better by the seaside than she had done in the\ntown. Men and women say that they will read, and think so,--those,\nI mean, who have acquired no habit of reading,--believing the work\nto be, of all works, the easiest. It may be work, they think, but of\nall works it must be the easiest of achievement. Given the absolute\nfaculty of reading, the task of going through the pages of a book\nmust be, of all tasks, the most certainly within the grasp of the\nman or woman who attempts it! Alas, no;--if the habit be not there,\nof all tasks it is the most difficult. If a man have not acquired\nthe habit of reading till he be old, he shall sooner in his old age\nlearn to make shoes than learn the adequate use of a book. And worse\nagain;--under such circumstances the making of shoes shall be more\npleasant to him than the reading of a book. Let those who are not\nold,--who are still young, ponder this well. Lady Ongar, indeed, was\nnot old, by no means too old to clothe herself in new habits. But\neven she was old enough to find that the doing so was a matter of\nmuch difficulty. She had her books around her; but, in spite of her\nbooks, she was sadly in want of some excitement when the letter from\nClavering came to her relief.\n\nIt was indeed a relief. Her brother-in-law dead, and he also who had\nso lately been her suitor! These two men whom she had so lately seen\nin lusty health,--proud with all the pride of outward life,--had\nboth, by a stroke of the winds, been turned into nothing. A terrible\nretribution had fallen upon her enemy,--for as her enemy she had\never regarded Hugh Clavering since her husband's death. She took\nno joy in this retribution. There was no feeling of triumph at her\nheart in that he had perished. She did not tell herself that she\nwas glad,--either for her own sake or for her sister's. But mingled\nwith the awe she felt there was a something of unexpressed and\ninexpressible relief. Her present life was very grievous to her,--and\nnow had occurred that which would open to her new hopes and a new\nmode of living. Her brother-in-law had oppressed her by his very\nexistence, and now he was gone. Had she had no brother-in-law who\nought to have welcomed her, her return to England would not have been\nterrible to her as it had been. Her sister would be now restored\nto her, and her solitude would probably be at an end. And then the\nvery excitement occasioned by the news was salutary to her. She was,\nin truth, shocked. As she said to her maid, she felt it to be very\ndreadful. But, nevertheless, the day on which she received those\ntidings was less wearisome to her than any other of the days that she\nhad passed at Tenby.\n\nPoor Archie! Some feeling of a tear, some half-formed drop that\nwas almost a tear, came to her eye as she thought of his fate. How\nfoolish he had always been, how unintelligent, how deficient in all\nthose qualities which recommend men to women! But the very memory\nof his deficiencies created something like a tenderness in his\nfavour. Hugh was disagreeable, nay hateful, by reason of the power\nwhich he possessed; whereas Archie was not hateful at all, and was\ndisagreeable simply because nature had been a niggard to him. And\nthen he had professed himself to be her lover. There had not been\nmuch in this; for he had come, of course, for her money; but even\nwhen that is the case a woman will feel something for the man who\nhas offered to link his lot with hers. Of all those to whom the fate\nof the two brothers had hitherto been matter of moment, I think that\nLady Ongar felt more than any other for the fate of poor Archie.\n\nAnd how would it affect Harry Clavering? She had desired to give\nHarry all the good things of the world, thinking that they would\nbecome him well,--thinking that they would become him very well as\nreaching him from her hand. Now he would have them all, but would\nnot have them from her. Now he would have them all, and would share\nthem with Florence Burton. Ah,--if she could have been true to\nhim in those early days,--in those days when she had feared his\npoverty,--would it not have been well now with her also? The measure\nof her retribution was come full home to her at last! Sir Harry\nClavering! She tried the name and found that it sounded very well.\nAnd she thought of the figure of the man and of his nature, and she\nknew that he would bear it with a becoming manliness. Sir Harry\nClavering would be somebody in his county,--would be a husband of\nwhom his wife would be proud as he went about among his tenants and\nhis gamekeepers,--and perhaps on wider and better journeys, looking\nup the voters of his neighbourhood. Yes; happy would be the wife of\nSir Harry Clavering. He was a man who would delight in sharing his\nhouse, his hopes, his schemes and councils with his wife. He would\nfind a companion in his wife. He would do honour to his wife, and\nmake much of her. He would like to see her go bravely. And then, if\nchildren came, how tender he would be to them! Whether Harry could\never have become a good head to a poor household might be doubtful,\nbut no man had ever been born fitter for the position which he was\nnow called upon to fill. It was thus that Lady Ongar thought of Harry\nClavering as she owned to herself that the full measure of her just\nretribution had come home to her.\n\nOf course she would go at once to Clavering Park. She wrote to her\nsister saying so, and the next day she started. She started so\nquickly on her journey that she reached the house not very many hours\nafter her own letter. She was there when the rector started for\nLondon, and there when Mr. Fielding preached his sermon; but she did\nnot see Mr. Clavering before he went, nor was she present to hear the\neloquence of the younger clergyman. Till after that Sunday the only\nmember of the family she had seen was Mrs. Clavering, who spent some\nperiod of every day up at the great house. Mrs. Clavering had not\nhitherto seen Lady Ongar since her return, and was greatly astonished\nat the change which so short a time had made. \"She is handsomer\nthan ever she was,\" Mrs. Clavering said to the rector; \"but it is\nthat beauty which some women carry into middle life, and not the\nloveliness of youth.\" Lady Ongar's manner was cold and stately when\nfirst she met Mrs. Clavering. It was on the morning of her marriage\nwhen they had last met,--when Julia Brabazon was resolving that she\nwould look like a countess, and that to be a countess should be\nenough for her happiness. She could not but remember this now, and\nwas unwilling at first to make confession of her failure by any\nmeekness of conduct. It behoved her to be proud, at any rate till she\nshould know how this new Lady Clavering would receive her. And then\nit was more than probable that this new Lady Clavering knew all that\nhad taken place between her and Harry. It behoved her, therefore, to\nhold her head on high.\n\nBut before the week was over, Mrs. Clavering,--for we will still call\nher so,--had broken Lady Ongar's spirit by her kindness; and the poor\nwoman who had so much to bear had brought herself to speak of the\nweight of her burden. Julia had, on one occasion, called her Lady\nClavering, and for the moment this had been allowed to pass without\nobservation. The widowed lady was then present, and no notice of the\nname was possible. But soon afterwards Mrs. Clavering made her little\nrequest on the subject. \"I do not quite know what the custom may be,\"\nshe said, \"but do not call me so just yet. It will only be reminding\nHermy of her bereavement.\"\n\n\"She is thinking of it always,\" said Julia.\n\n\"No doubt she is; but still the new name would wound her. And,\nindeed, it perplexes me also. Let it come by-and-by, when we are more\nsettled.\"\n\nLady Ongar had truly said that her sister was as yet always thinking\nof her bereavement. To her now it was as though the husband she had\nlost had been a paragon among men. She could only remember of him his\nmanliness, his power,--a dignity of presence which he possessed,--and\nthe fact that to her he had been everything. She thought of that\nlast and vain caution which she had given him, when with her hardly\npermitted last embrace she had besought him to take care of himself.\nShe did not remember now how coldly that embrace had been received,\nhow completely those words had been taken as meaning nothing, how he\nhad left her not only without a sign of affection, but without an\nattempt to repress the evidences of his indifference. But she did\nremember that she had had her arm upon his shoulder, and tried to\nthink of that embrace as though it had been sweet to her. And she did\nremember how she had stood at the window, listening to the sounds of\nthe wheels which took him off, and watching his form as long as her\neye could rest upon it. Ah! what falsehoods she told herself now of\nher love to him, and of his goodness to her; pious falsehoods which\nwould surely tend to bring some comfort to her wounded spirit.\n\nBut her sister could hardly bear to hear the praises of Sir Hugh.\nWhen she found how it was to be, she resolved that she would bear\nthem,--bear them, and not contradict them; but her struggle in doing\nso was great, and was almost too much for her.\n\n\"He had judged me and condemned me,\" she said at last, \"and\ntherefore, as a matter of course, we were not such friends when we\nlast met as we used to be before my marriage.\"\n\n\"But, Julia, there was much for which you owed him gratitude.\"\n\n\"We will say nothing about that now, Hermy.\"\n\n\"I do not know why your mouth should be closed on such a subject\nbecause he has gone. I should have thought that you would be glad to\nacknowledge his kindness to you. But you were always hard.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am hard.\"\n\n\"And twice he asked you to come here since you returned,--but you\nwould not come.\"\n\n\"I have come now, Hermy, when I have thought that I might be of use.\"\n\n\"He felt it when you would not come before. I know he did.\" Lady\nOngar could not but think of the way in which he had manifested his\nfeelings on the occasion of his visit to Bolton Street. \"I never\ncould understand why you were so bitter.\"\n\n\"I think, dear, we had better not discuss that. I also have had much\nto bear,--I, as well as you. What you have borne has come in no wise\nfrom your own fault.\"\n\n\"No, indeed; I did not want him to go. I would have given anything to\nkeep him at home.\"\n\nHer sister had not been thinking of the suffering which had come\nto her from the loss of her husband, but of her former miseries.\nThis, however, she did not explain. \"No,\" Lady Ongar continued to\nsay. \"You have nothing for which to blame yourself, whereas I have\nmuch,--indeed everything. If we are to remain together, as I hope we\nmay, it will be better for us both that bygones should be bygones.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that I am never to speak of Hugh?\"\n\n\"No;--I by no means intend that. But I would rather that you should\nnot refer to his feelings towards me. I think he did not quite\nunderstand the sort of life that I led while my husband was alive,\nand that he judged me amiss. Therefore I would have bygones be\nbygones.\"\n\nThree or four days after this, when the question of leaving Clavering\nPark was being mooted, the elder sister started a difficulty as to\nmoney matters. An offer had been made to her by Mrs. Clavering to\nremain at the great house, but this she had declined, alleging that\nthe place would be distasteful to her after her husband's death.\nShe, poor soul, did not allege that it had been made distasteful to\nher for ever by the solitude which she had endured there during her\nhusband's lifetime! She would go away somewhere, and live as best\nshe might upon her jointure. It was not very much, but it would be\nsufficient. She did not see, she said, how she could live with her\nsister, because she did not wish to be dependent. Julia, of course,\nwould live in a style to which she could make no pretence.\n\nMrs. Clavering, who was present,--as was also Lady Ongar,--declared\nthat she saw no such difficulty. \"Sisters together,\" she said, \"need\nhardly think of a difference in such matters.\"\n\nThen it was that Lady Ongar first spoke to either of them of her\nhalf-formed resolution about her money, and then too, for the first\ntime, did she come down altogether from that high horse on which\nshe had been, as it were, compelled to mount herself while in Mrs.\nClavering's presence. \"I think I must explain,\" said she, \"something\nof what I mean to do,--about my money that is. I do not think that\nthere will be much difference between me and Hermy in that respect.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense,\" said her sister, fretfully.\n\n\"There will be a difference in income certainly,\" said Mrs.\nClavering, \"but I do not see that that need create any uncomfortable\nfeeling.\"\n\n\"Only one doesn't like to be dependent,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"You shall not be asked to give up any of your independence,\" said\nJulia, with a smile,--a melancholy smile, that gave but little sign\nof pleasantness within. Then on a sudden her face became stern and\nhard. \"The fact is,\" she said, \"I do not intend to keep Lord Ongar's\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Not to keep your income!\" said Hermione.\n\n\"No;--I will give it back to them,--or at least the greater part of\nit. Why should I keep it?\"\n\n\"It is your own,\" said Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"Yes; legally it is my own. I know that. And when there was some\nquestion whether it should not be disputed I would have fought for it\nto the last shilling. Somebody,--I suppose it was the lawyer,--wanted\nto keep from me the place in Surrey. I told them then that I would\nnot abandon my right to an inch of it. But they yielded,--and now I\nhave given them back the house.\"\n\n\"You have given it back!\" said her sister.\n\n\"Yes;--I have said they may have it. It is of no use to me. I hate\nthe place.\"\n\n\"You have been very generous,\" said Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"But that will not affect your income,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"No;--that would not affect my income.\" Then she paused, not knowing\nhow to go on with the story of her purpose.\n\n\"If I may say so, Lady Ongar,\" said Mrs. Clavering, \"I would not, if\nI were you, take any steps in so important a matter without advice.\"\n\n\"Who is there that can advise me? Of course the lawyer tells me that\nI ought to keep it all. It is his business to give such advice as\nthat. But what does he know of what I feel? How can he understand me?\nHow, indeed, can I expect that any one shall understand me?\"\n\n\"But it is possible that people should misunderstand you,\" said Mrs.\nClavering.\n\n\"Exactly. That is just what he says. But, Mrs. Clavering, I care\nnothing for that. I care nothing for what anybody says or thinks.\nWhat is it to me what they say?\"\n\n\"I should have thought it was everything,\" said her sister.\n\n\"No,--it is nothing;--nothing at all.\" Then she was again silent, and\nwas unable to express herself. She could not bring herself to declare\nin words that self-condemnation of her own conduct which was now\nweighing so heavily upon her. It was not that she wished to keep back\nher own feelings, either from her sister or from Mrs. Clavering; but\nthat the words in which to express them were wanting to her.\n\n\"And have they accepted the house?\" Mrs. Clavering asked.\n\n\"They must accept it. What else can they do? They cannot make me call\nit mine if I do not choose. If I refuse to take the income which Mr.\nCourton's lawyer pays in to my bankers', they cannot compel me to\nhave it.\"\n\n\"But you are not going to give that up too?\" said her sister.\n\n\"I am. I will not have his money,--not more than enough to keep me\nfrom being a scandal to his family. I will not have it. It is a\ncurse to me, and has been from the first. What right have I to all\nthat money, because,--because,--because--\" She could not finish her\nsentence, but turned away from them, and walked by herself to the\nwindow.\n\nLady Clavering looked at Mrs. Clavering as though she thought that\nher sister was mad. \"Do you understand her?\" said Lady Clavering in\na whisper.\n\n\"I think I do,\" said the other. \"I think I know what is passing in\nher mind.\" Then she followed Lady Ongar across the room, and taking\nher gently by the arm tried to comfort her,--to comfort her, and to\nargue with her as to the rashness of that which she proposed to do.\nShe endeavoured to explain to the poor woman how it was that she\nshould at this moment be wretched, and anxious to do that which, if\ndone, would put it out of her power afterwards to make herself useful\nin the world. It shocked the prudence of Mrs. Clavering,--this idea\nof abandoning money, the possession of which was questioned by no\none. \"They do not want it, Lady Ongar,\" she said.\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it,\" answered the other.\n\n\"And nobody has any suspicion but what it is honourably and fairly\nyour own.\"\n\n\"But does anybody ever think how I got it?\" said Lady Ongar, turning\nsharply round upon Mrs. Clavering. \"You,--you,--you,--do you dare to\ntell me what you think of the way in which it became mine? Could you\nbear it, if it had become yours after such a fashion? I cannot bear\nit, and I will not.\" She was now speaking with so much violence that\nher sister was awed into silence, and Mrs. Clavering herself found a\ndifficulty in answering her.\n\n\"Whatever may have been the past,\" said she, \"the question now is how\nto do the best for the future.\"\n\n\"I had hoped,\" continued Lady Ongar without noticing what was said to\nher, \"I had hoped to make everything straight by giving his money to\nanother. You know to whom I mean, and so does Hermy. I thought, when\nI returned, that bad as I had been I might still do some good in the\nworld. But it is as they tell us in the sermons. One cannot make good\ncome out of evil. I have done evil, and nothing but evil has come\nfrom the evil which I have done. Nothing but evil will come from it.\nAs for being useful in the world,--I know of what use I am! When\nwomen hear how wretched I have been they will be unwilling to sell\nthemselves as I did.\" Then she made her way to the door, and left the\nroom, going out with quiet steps, and closing the lock behind her\nwithout a sound.\n\n\"I did not know that she was such as that,\" said Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"Nor did I. She has never spoken in that way before.\"\n\n\"Poor soul! Hermione, you see there are those in the world whose\nsufferings are worse than yours.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Lady Clavering. \"She never lost what I have\nlost,--never.\"\n\n\"She has lost what I am sure you never will lose, her own\nself-esteem. But, Hermy, you should be good to her. We must all be\ngood to her. Will it not be better that you should stay with us for a\nwhile,--both of you?\"\n\n\"What, here at the park?\"\n\n\"We will make room for you at the rectory, if you would like it.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I will go away. I shall be better away. I suppose she will\nnot be like that often; will she?\"\n\n\"She was much moved just now.\"\n\n\"And what does she mean about her income? She cannot be in earnest.\"\n\n\"She is in earnest now.\"\n\n\"And cannot it be prevented? Only think,--if after all she were to\ngive up her jointure! Mrs. Clavering, you do not think she is mad; do\nyou?\"\n\nMrs. Clavering said what she could to comfort the elder and weaker\nsister on this subject, explaining to her that the Courtons would not\nbe at all likely to take advantage of any wild generosity on the part\nof Lady Ongar, and then she walked home across the park, meditating\non the character of the two sisters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nMADAME GORDELOUP RETIRES FROM BRITISH DIPLOMACY.\n\n\n[Illustration.]\n\nThe reader must be asked to accompany me once more to that room in\nMount Street in which poor Archie practised diplomacy, and whither\nthe courageous Doodles was carried prisoner in those moments in which\nhe was last seen of us. The Spy was now sitting alone before her\ndesk, scribbling with all her energy,--writing letters on foreign\npolicy, no doubt, to all the courts of Europe, but especially to that\nRussian court to which her services were more especially due. She was\nhard at work, when there came the sound of a step upon the stairs.\nThe practised ear of the Spy became erect, and she at once knew who\nwas her visitor. It was not one with whom diplomacy would much avail,\nor who was likely to have money ready under his glove for her behoof.\n\"Ah, Edouard, is that you? I am glad you have come,\" she said, as\nCount Pateroff entered the room.\n\n\"Yes, it is I. I got your note yesterday.\"\n\n\"You are good,--very good. You are always good.\" Sophie as she said\nthis went on very rapidly with her letter,--so rapidly that her hand\nseemed to run about the paper wildly. Then she flung down her pen,\nand folded the paper on which she had been writing with marvellous\nquickness. There was an activity about the woman, in all her\nmovements, which was wonderful to watch. \"There,\" she said, \"that is\ndone; now we can talk. Ah! I have nearly written off my fingers this\nmorning.\" Her brother smiled, but said nothing about the letters. He\nnever allowed himself to allude in any way to her professional\nduties.\n\n\"So you are going to St. Petersburg?\" he said.\n\n\"Well,--yes, I think. Why should I remain here spending money with\nboth hands and through the nose?\" At this idea, the brother again\nsmiled pleasantly. He had never seen his sister to be culpably\nextravagant as she now described herself. \"Nothing to get and\neverything to lose,\" she went on saying.\n\n\"You know your own affairs best,\" he answered.\n\n\"Yes; I know my own affairs. If I remained here, I should be taken\naway to that black building there;\" and she pointed in the direction\nof the workhouse, which fronts so gloomily upon Mount Street. \"You\nwould not come to take me out.\"\n\nThe count smiled again. \"You are too clever for that, Sophie, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is well for a woman to be clever, or she must starve,--yes,\nstarve! Such a one as I must starve in this accursed country, if I\nwere not what you call, clever.\" The brother and sister were talking\nin French, and she spoke now almost as rapidly as she had written.\n\"They are beasts and fools, and as awkward as bulls,--yes, as bulls.\nI hate them. I hate them all. Men, women, children,--they are all\nalike. Look at the street out there. Though it is summer, I shiver\nwhen I look out at its blackness. It is the ugliest nation! And they\nunderstand nothing. Oh, how I hate them!\"\n\n\"They are not without merit. They have got money.\"\n\n\"Money,--yes. They have got money; and they are so stupid, you\nmay take it from under their eyes. They will not see you. But of\ntheir own hearts, they will give you nothing. You see that black\nbuilding,--the workhouse. I call it Little England. It is just the\nsame. The naked, hungry, poor wretches lie at the door, and the great\nfat beadles swell about like turkey-cocks inside.\"\n\n\"You have been here long enough to know, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Yes; I have been here long,--too long. I have made my life a\nwilderness, staying here in this country of barracks. And what have\nI got for it? I came back because of that woman, and she has thrown\nme over. That is your fault,--yours,--yours!\"\n\n\"And you have sent for me to tell me that again?\"\n\n\"No, Edouard. I sent for you that you might see your sister once\nmore,--that I might once more see my brother.\" This she said\nleaning forward on the table, on which her arms rested, and looking\nsteadfastly into his face with eyes moist,--just moist, with a tear\nin each. Whether Edouard was too unfeeling to be moved by this\nshow of affection, or whether he gave more credit to his sister's\nhistrionic powers than to those of her heart, I will not say; but he\nwas altogether irresponsive to her appeal. \"You will be back again\nbefore long,\" he said.\n\n\"Never! I shall come back to this accursed country never again. No;\nI am going once and for all. I will soil myself with the mud of its\ngutters no more. I came for the sake of Julie; and now,--how has she\ntreated me?\" Edouard shrugged his shoulders. \"And you,--how has she\ntreated you?\"\n\n\"Never mind me.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I must mind you. Only that you would not let me manage, it\nmight be yours now,--yes, all. Why did you come down to that accursed\nisland?\"\n\n\"It was my way to play my game. Leave that alone, Sophie.\" And there\ncame a frown over the brother's brow.\n\n\"Your way to play your game! Yes; and what has become of mine? You\nhave destroyed mine; but you think nothing of that. After all that I\nhave gone through, to have nothing; and through you,--my brother! Ah,\nthat is the hardest of all,--when I was putting all things in train\nfor you!\"\n\n\"You are always putting things in train. Leave your trains alone,\nwhere I am concerned.\"\n\n\"But why did you come to that place in the accursed island? I am\nruined by that journey. Yes; I am ruined. You will not help me to get\na shilling from her,--not even for my expenses.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. You are clever enough to do your own work without my\naid.\"\n\n\"And is that all from a brother? Well! And now that they have drowned\nthemselves,--the two Claverings,--the fool and the brute; and she can\ndo what she pleases--\"\n\n\"She could always do as she pleased since Lord Ongar died.\"\n\n\"Yes; but she is more lonely than ever now. That cousin who is the\ngreatest fool of all, who might have had everything,--mon Dieu! yes,\neverything;--she would have given it all to him with a sweep of her\nhand, if he would have taken it. He is to marry himself to a little\nbrown girl, who has not a shilling. No one but an Englishman could\nmake follies so abominable as these. Ah, I am sick,--I am sick when\nI remember it!\" And Sophie gave unmistakeable signs of a grief which\ncould hardly have been self-interested. But in truth she suffered\npain at seeing a good game spoilt. It was not that she had any wish\nfor Harry Clavering's welfare. Had he gone to the bottom of the sea\nin the same boat with his cousins, the tidings of his fate would have\nbeen pleasurable to her rather than otherwise. But when she saw such\ncards thrown away as he had held in his hand, she encountered that\nsort of suffering which a good player feels when he sits behind the\nchair of one who plays up to his adversary's trump, and makes no\ntricks of his own kings and aces.\n\n\"He may marry himself to the devil, if he please;--it is nothing to\nme,\" said the count.\n\n\"But she is there;--by herself,--at that place;--what is it called?\nTen--bie. Will you not go now, when you can do no harm?\"\n\n\"No; I will not go now.\"\n\n\"And in a year she will have taken some other one for her husband.\"\n\n\"What is that to me? But look here, Sophie, for you may as well\nunderstand me at once. If I were ever to think of Lady Ongar again as\nmy wife, I should not tell you.\"\n\n\"And why not tell me,--your sister?\"\n\n\"Because it would do me no good. If you had not been there she would\nhave been my wife now.\"\n\n\"Edouard!\"\n\n\"What I say is true. But I do not want to reproach you because of\nthat. Each of us was playing his own game; and your game was not my\ngame. You are going now, and if I play my game again I can play it\nalone.\"\n\nUpon hearing this Sophie sat awhile in silence, looking at him. \"You\nwill play it alone?\" she said at last. \"You would rather do that?\"\n\n\"Much rather, if I play any game at all.\"\n\n\"And you will give me something to go?\"\n\n\"Not one sou.\"\n\n\"You will not;--not a sou?\"\n\n\"Not half a sou,--for you to go or stay. Sophie, are you not a fool\nto ask me for money?\"\n\n\"And you are a fool,--a fool who knows nothing. You need not look at\nme like that. I am not afraid. I shall remain here. I shall stay and\ndo as the lawyer tells me. He says that if I bring my action she must\npay me for my expenses. I will bring my action. I am not going to\nleave it all to you. No. Do you remember those days in Florence?\nI have not been paid yet, but I will be paid. One hundred and\nseventy-five thousand francs a year,--and after all I am to have none\nof it! Say;--should it become yours, will you do something for your\nsister?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all;--nothing. Sophie, do you think I am fool enough to\nbargain in such a matter?\"\n\n\"Then I will stay. Yes;--I will bring my action. All the world shall\nhear, and they shall know how you have destroyed me and yourself.\nAh;--you think I am afraid; that I will not spend my money. I will\nspend all,--all,--all; and I will be revenged.\"\n\n\"You may go or stay; it is the same thing to me. Now, if you please,\nI will take my leave.\" And he got up from his chair to leave her.\n\n\"It is the same thing to you?\"\n\n\"Quite the same.\"\n\n\"Then I will stay, and she shall hear my name every day of\nher life;--every hour. She shall be so sick of me and of you,\nthat,--that--that-- Oh, Edouard!\" This last appeal was made to him\nbecause he was already at the door, and could not be stopped in any\nother way.\n\n\"What else have you to say, my sister?\"\n\n\"Oh, Edouard, what would I not give to see all those riches yours?\nHas it not been my dearest wish? Edouard, you are ungrateful. All men\nare ungrateful.\" Now, having succeeded in stopping him, she buried\nher face in the corner of the sofa and wept plentifully. It must be\npresumed that her acting before her brother must have been altogether\nthrown away; but the acting was, nevertheless, very good.\n\n\"If you are in truth going to St. Petersburg,\" he said, \"I will bid\nyou adieu now. If not,--au revoir.\"\n\n\"I am going. Yes, Edouard, I am. I cannot bear this country longer.\nMy heart is being torn to pieces. All my affections are outraged.\nYes, I am going;--perhaps on Monday;--perhaps on Monday week. But\nI go in truth. My brother, adieu.\" Then she got up, and putting a\nhand on each of his shoulders, lifted up her face to be kissed. He\nembraced her in the manner proposed, and turned to leave her. But\nbefore he went she made to him one other petition, holding him by the\narm as she did so. \"Edouard, you can lend me twenty napoleons till I\nam at St. Petersburg?\"\n\n\"No, Sophie; no.\"\n\n\"Not lend your sister twenty napoleons!\"\n\n\"No, Sophie. I never lend money. It is a rule.\"\n\n\"Will you give me five? I am so poor. I have almost nothing.\"\n\n\"Things are not so bad with you as that, I hope?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; they are very bad. Since I have been in this accursed\ncity,--now, this time, what have I got? Nothing,--nothing. She was to\nbe all in all to me,--and she has given me nothing! It is very bad to\nbe so poor. Say that you will give me five napoleons;--O my brother!\"\nShe was still hanging by his arm, and, as she did so, she looked up\ninto his face with tears in her eyes. As he regarded her, bending\ndown his face over hers, a slight smile came upon his countenance.\nThen he put his hand into his pocket, and taking out his purse,\nhanded to her five sovereigns.\n\n\"Only five?\" she said.\n\n\"Only five,\" he answered.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, O my brother.\" Then she kissed him again, and\nafter that he went. She accompanied him to the top of the stairs,\nand from thence showered blessings on his head, till she heard the\nlock of the door closed behind him. When he was altogether gone she\nunlocked an inner drawer in her desk, and, taking out an uncompleted\nrouleau of gold, added her brother's sovereigns thereto. The sum he\nhad given her was exactly wanted to make up the required number of\ntwenty-five. She counted them half-a-dozen times, to be quite sure,\nand then rolled them carefully in paper, and sealed the little packet\nat each end. \"Ah,\" she said, speaking to herself, \"they are very\nnice. Nothing else English is nice, but only these.\" There were many\nrolls of money there before her in the drawer of the desk;--some ten,\nperhaps, or twelve. These she took out one after another, passing\nthem lovingly through her fingers, looking at the little seals at the\nends of each, weighing them in her hand as though to make sure that\nno wrong had been done to them in her absence, standing them up one\nagainst another to see that they were of the same length. We may be\nquite sure that Sophie Gordeloup brought no sovereigns with her to\nEngland when she came over with Lady Ongar after the earl's death,\nand that the hoard before her contained simply the plunder which she\nhad collected during this her latest visit to the \"accursed\" country\nwhich she was going to leave.\n\nBut before she started she was resolved to make one more attempt upon\nthat mine of wealth which, but a few weeks ago, had seemed to be\nopen before her. She had learned from the servants in Bolton Street\nthat Lady Ongar was with Lady Clavering, at Clavering Park, and she\naddressed a letter to her there. This letter she wrote in English,\nand she threw into her appeal all the pathos of which she was\ncapable.--\n\n\n   Mount Street, October, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST JULIE,--I do not think you would wish me to go\n   away from this country for ever,--for ever, without\n   one word of farewell to her I love so fondly. Yes; I\n   have loved you with all my heart,--and now I am going\n   away,--for ever. Shall we not meet each other once, and\n   have one embrace? No trouble will be too much to me for\n   that. No journey will be too long. Only say, Sophie, come\n   to your Julie.\n\n   I must go, because I am so poor. Yes; I cannot live longer\n   here without having the means. I am not ashamed to say to\n   my Julie, who is rich, that I am poor. No; nor would I be\n   ashamed to wait on my Julie like a slave if she would let\n   me. My Julie was angry with me, because of my brother! Was\n   it my fault that he came upon us in our little retreat,\n   where we was so happy? Oh, no. I told him not to come. I\n   knew his coming was for nothing,--nothing at all. I knew\n   where was the heart of my Julie!--my poor Julie! But he\n   was not worth that heart, and the pearl was thrown before\n   a pig. But my brother--! Ah, he has ruined me. Why am I\n   separated from my Julie but for him? Well; I can go away,\n   and in my own countries there are those who will not wish\n   to be separated from Sophie Gordeloup.\n\n   May I now tell my Julie in what condition is her poor\n   friend? She will remember how it was that my feet brought\n   me to England,--to England, to which I had said farewell\n   for ever,--to England, where people must be rich like my\n   Julie before they can eat and drink. I thought nothing\n   then but of my Julie. I stopped not on the road to make\n   merchandise,--what you call a bargain,--about my coming.\n   No; I came at once, leaving all things,--my little\n   affairs,--in confusion, because my Julie wanted me to\n   come! It was in the winter. Oh, that winter! My poor bones\n   shall never forget it. They are racked still with the\n   pains which your savage winds have given them. And now it\n   is autumn. Ten months have I been here, and I have eaten\n   up my little substance. Oh, Julie, you, who are so rich,\n   do not know what is the poverty of your Sophie!\n\n   A lawyer have told me,--not a French lawyer, but an\n   English,--that somebody should pay me everything. He says\n   the law would give it me. He have offered me the money\n   himself,--just to let him make an action. But I have\n   said,--No. No; Sophie will not have an action with her\n   Julie. She would scorn that; and so the lawyer went away.\n   But if my Julie will think of this, and will remember her\n   Sophie,--how much she have expended, and now at last there\n   is nothing left. She must go and beg among her friends.\n   And why? Because she have loved her Julie too well. You,\n   who are so rich, would miss it not at all. What would\n   two,--three hundred pounds be to my Julie?\n\n   Shall I come to you? Say so; say so, and I will go at\n   once, if I did crawl on my knees. Oh, what a joy to see\n   my Julie! And do not think I will trouble you about money.\n   No; your Sophie will be too proud for that. Not a word\n   will I say, but to love you. Nothing will I do, but to\n   print one kiss on my Julie's forehead, and then to retire\n   for ever; asking God's blessing for her dear head.\n\n   Thine,--always thine,\n\n   SOPHIE.\n\n\nLady Ongar, when she received this letter, was a little perplexed by\nit, not feeling quite sure in what way she might best answer it. It\nwas the special severity of her position that there was no one to\nwhom, in such difficulties, she could apply for advice. Of one thing\nshe was quite sure,--that, willingly, she would never again see\nher devoted Sophie. And she knew that the woman deserved no money\nfrom her; that she had deserved none, but had received much. Every\nassertion in her letter was false. No one had wished her to come,\nand the expense of her coming had been paid for her over and over\nagain. Lady Ongar knew that she had money,--and knew also that she\nwould have had immediate recourse to law, if any lawyer would have\nsuggested to her with a probability of success that he could get more\nfor her. No doubt she had been telling her story to some attorney, in\nthe hope that money might thus be extracted, and had been dragging\nher Julie's name through the mud, telling all she knew of that\nwretched Florentine story. As to all that Lady Ongar had no doubt;\nand yet she wished to send the woman money!\n\nThere are services for which one is ready to give almost any\namount of money payment,--if only one can be sure that that money\npayment will be taken as sufficient recompence for the service\nin question. Sophie Gordeloup had been useful. She had been very\ndisagreeable,--but she had been useful. She had done things which\nnobody else could have done, and she had done her work well. That she\nhad been paid for her work over and over again, there was no doubt;\nbut Lady Ongar was willing to give her yet further payment, if only\nthere might be an end of it. But she feared to do this, dreading\nthe nature and cunning of the little woman,--lest she should take\nsuch payment as an acknowledgment of services for which secret\ncompensation must be made,--and should then proceed to further\nthreats. Thinking much of all this, Julie at last wrote to her Sophie\nas follows:--\n\n\n   Lady Ongar presents her compliments to Madame Gordeloup,\n   and must decline to see Madame Gordeloup again after what\n   has passed. Lady Ongar is very sorry to hear that Madame\n   Gordeloup is in want of funds. Whatever assistance Lady\n   Ongar might have been willing to afford, she now feels\n   that she is prohibited from giving any by the allusion\n   which Madame Gordeloup has made to legal advice. If Madame\n   Gordeloup has legal demands on Lady Ongar which are\n   said by a lawyer to be valid, Lady Ongar would strongly\n   recommend Madame Gordeloup to enforce them.\n\n   Clavering Park, October, 186--.\n\n\nThis she wrote, acting altogether on her own judgment, and sent off\nby return of post. She almost wept at her own cruelty after the\nletter was gone, and greatly doubted her own discretion. But of whom\ncould she have asked advice? Could she have told all the story of\nMadame Gordeloup to the rector or to the rector's wife? The letter\nno doubt was a discreet letter; but she greatly doubted her own\ndiscretion, and when she received her Sophie's rejoinder, she hardly\ndared to break the envelope.\n\nPoor Sophie! Her Julie's letter nearly broke her heart. For sincerity\nlittle credit was due to her;--but some little was perhaps due. That\nshe should be called Madame Gordeloup, and have compliments presented\nto her by the woman,--by the countess with whom and with whose\nhusband she had been on such closely familiar terms, did in truth\nwound some tender feelings within her bosom. Such love as she had\nbeen able to give, she had given to her Julie. That she had always\nbeen willing to rob her Julie, to make a milch-cow of her Julie, to\nsell her Julie, to threaten her Julie, to quarrel with her Julie\nif aught might be done in that way,--to expose her Julie; nay, to\ndestroy her Julie if money was to be so made;--all this did not\nhinder her love. She loved her Julie, and was broken-hearted that her\nJulie should have written to her in such a strain.\n\nBut her feelings were much more acute when she came to perceive that\nshe had damaged her own affairs by the hint of a menace which she\nhad thrown out. Business is business, and must take precedence of\nall sentiment and romance in this hard world in which bread is so\nnecessary. Of that Madame Gordeloup was well aware. And therefore,\nhaving given herself but two short minutes to weep over her Julie's\nhardness, she applied her mind at once to the rectification\nof the error she had made. Yes; she had been wrong about the\nlawyer,--certainly wrong. But then these English people were so\npig-headed! A slight suspicion of a hint, such as that she had made,\nwould have been taken by a Frenchman, by a Russian, by a Pole, as\nmeaning no more than it meant. \"But these English are bulls; the men\nand the women are all like bulls,--bulls!\"\n\nShe at once sat down and wrote another letter; another in such an\necstasy of eagerness to remove the evil impressions which she had\nmade, that she wrote it almost with the natural effusion of her\nheart.--\n\n\n   DEAR FRIEND,--Your coldness kills me,--kills me! But\n   perhaps I have deserved it. If I said there were legal\n   demands I did deserve it. No; there are none. Legal\n   demands! Oh, no. What can your poor friend demand legally?\n   The lawyer--he knows nothing; he was a stranger. It was my\n   brother spoke to him. What should I do with a lawyer? Oh,\n   my friend, do not be angry with your poor servant. I write\n   now not to ask for money,--but for a kind word; for one\n   word of kindness and love to your Sophie before she have\n   gone for ever! Yes; for ever. Oh, Julie, oh, my angel;\n   I would lie at your feet and kiss them if you were here.\n   Yours till death, even though you should still be hard to\n   me,\n\n   SOPHIE.\n\n\nTo this appeal Lady Ongar sent no direct answer, but she commissioned\nMr. Turnbull, her lawyer, to call upon Madame Gordeloup and pay to\nthat lady one hundred pounds, taking her receipt for the same. Lady\nOngar, in her letter to the lawyer, explained that the woman in\nquestion had been useful in Florence; and explained also that she\nmight pretend that she had further claims. \"If so,\" said Lady Ongar,\n\"I wish you to tell her that she can prosecute them at law if she\npleases. The money I now give her is a gratuity made for certain\nservices rendered in Florence during the illness of Lord Ongar.\" This\ncommission Mr. Turnbull executed, and Sophie Gordeloup, when taking\nthe money, made no demand for any further payment.\n\nFour days after this a little woman, carrying a very big bandbox in\nher hands, might have been seen to scramble with difficulty out of\na boat in the Thames up the side of a steamer bound from thence for\nBoulogne. And after her there climbed up an active little man, who,\nwith peremptory voice, repulsed the boatman's demand for further\npayment. He also had a bandbox on his arm,--belonging, no doubt, to\nthe little woman. And it might have been seen that the active little\nman, making his way to the table at which the clerk of the boat\nwas sitting, out of his own purse paid the passage-money for two\npassengers,--through to Paris. And the head and legs and neck of that\nlittle man were like to the head and legs and neck of--our friend\nDoodles, alias Captain Boodle, of Warwickshire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nSHOWING HOW THINGS SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE RECTORY.\n\n\nWhen Harry's letter, with the tidings of the fate of his cousins,\nreached Florence at Stratton, the whole family was, not unnaturally,\nthrown into great excitement. Being slow people, the elder Burtons\nhad hardly as yet realized the fact that Harry was again to be\naccepted among the Burton Penates as a pure divinity. Mrs. Burton,\nfor some weeks past, had grown to be almost sublime in her wrath\nagainst him. That a man should live and treat her daughter as\nFlorence was about to be treated! Had not her husband forbidden\nsuch a journey, as being useless in regard to the expenditure,\nshe would have gone up to London that she might have told Harry\nwhat she thought of him. Then came the news that Harry was again a\ndivinity,--an Apollo, whom the Burton Penates ought only to be too\nproud to welcome to a seat among them!\n\nAnd now came this other news that this Apollo was to be an Apollo\nindeed! When the god first became a god again, there was still a\ncloud upon the minds of the elder Burtons as to the means by which\nthe divinity was to be sustained. A god in truth, but a god with so\nvery moderate an annual income;--unless indeed those old Burtons made\nit up to an extent which seemed to them to be quite unnatural! There\nwas joy among the Burtons, of course, but the joy was somewhat dimmed\nby these reflections as to the slight means of their Apollo. A lover\nwho was not an Apollo might wait; but, as they had learned already,\nthere was danger in keeping such a god as this suspended on the\ntenter-hooks of expectation.\n\nBut now there came the further news! This Apollo of theirs had really\na place of his own among the gods of Olympus. He was the eldest son\nof a man of large fortune, and would be a baronet! He had already\ndeclared that he would marry at once;--that his father wished him to\ndo so, and that an abundant income would be forthcoming. As to his\neagerness for an immediate marriage, no divinity in or out of the\nheavens could behave better. Old Mrs. Burton, as she went through\nthe process of taking him again to her heart, remembered that that\nvirtue had been his, even before the days of his backsliding had\ncome. A warm-hearted, eager, affectionate divinity,--with only this\nagainst him, that he wanted some careful looking after in these, his\nunsettled days. \"I really do think that he'll be as fond of his own\nfireside as any other man, when he has once settled down,\" said Mrs.\nBurton.\n\nIt will not, I hope, be taken as a blot on the character of this\nmother that she was much elated at the prospect of the good things\nwhich were to fall to her daughter's lot. For herself she desired\nnothing. For her daughters she had coveted only good, substantial,\npainstaking husbands, who would fear God and mind their business.\nWhen Harry Clavering had come across her path and had demanded a\ndaughter from her, after the manner of the other young men who had\nlearned the secrets of their profession at Stratton, she had desired\nnothing more than that he and Florence should walk in the path which\nhad been followed by her sisters and their husbands. But then had\ncome that terrible fear; and now had come these golden prospects.\nThat her daughter should be Lady Clavering, of Clavering Park! She\ncould not but be elated at the thought of it. She would not live to\nsee it, but the consciousness that it would be so was pleasant to her\nin her old age. Florence had ever been regarded as the flower of the\nflock, and now she would be taken up into high places,--according to\nher deserts.\n\nFirst had come the letter from Harry, and then, after an interval\nof a week, another letter from Mrs. Clavering, pressing her dear\nFlorence to go to the parsonage. \"We think that at present we all\nought to be together,\" said Mrs. Clavering, \"and therefore we want\nyou to be with us.\" It was very flattering. \"I suppose I ought to go,\nmamma?\" said Florence. Mrs. Burton was of opinion that she certainly\nought to go. \"You should write to her ladyship at once,\" said Mrs.\nBurton, mindful of the change which had taken place. Florence,\nhowever, addressed her letter, as heretofore, to Mrs. Clavering,\nthinking that a mistake on that side would be better than a mistake\non the other. It was not for her to be over-mindful of the rank with\nwhich she was about to be connected. \"You won't forget your old\nmother now that you are going to be so grand?\" said Mrs. Burton, as\nFlorence was leaving her.\n\n\"You only say that to laugh at me,\" said Florence. \"I expect no\ngrandness, and I am sure you expect no forgetfulness.\"\n\nThe solemnity consequent upon the first news of the accident had worn\nitself off, and Florence found the family at the parsonage happy and\ncomfortable. Mrs. Fielding was still there, and Mr. Fielding was\nexpected again after the next Sunday. Fanny also was there, and\nFlorence could see during the first half-hour that she was very\nradiant. Mr. Saul, however, was not there, and it may as well be said\nat once that Mr. Saul as yet knew nothing of his coming fortune.\nFlorence was received with open arms by them all, and by Harry with\narms which were almost too open. \"I suppose it may be in about three\nweeks from now?\" he said at the first moment in which he could have\nher to himself.\n\n\"Oh, Harry,--no,\" said Florence.\n\n\"No;--why no? That's what my mother proposes.\"\n\n\"In three weeks!--She could not have said that. Nobody has begun to\nthink of such a thing yet at Stratton.\"\n\n\"They are so very slow at Stratton!\"\n\n\"And you are so very fast at Clavering! But, Harry, we don't know\nwhere we are going to live.\"\n\n\"We should go abroad at first, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And what then? That would only be for a month or so.\"\n\n\"Only for a month? I mean for all the winter,--and the spring. Why\nnot? One can see nothing in a month. If we are back for the shooting\nnext year that would do,--and then of course we should come here. I\nshould say next winter,--that is the winter after the next,--we might\nas well stay with them at the big house, and then we could look about\nus, you know. I should like a place near to this, because of the\nhunting!\"\n\nFlorence, when she heard all this, became aware that in talking\nabout a month she had forgotten herself. She had been accustomed to\nholidays of a month's duration,--and to honeymoon trips fitted to\nsuch vacations. A month was the longest holiday ever heard of in the\nchambers in the Adelphi,--or at the house in Onslow Crescent. She had\nforgotten herself. It was not to be the lot of her husband to earn\nhis bread, and fit himself to such periods as business might require.\nThen Harry went on describing the tour which he had arranged;--which\nas he said he only suggested. But it was quite apparent that in\nthis matter he intended to be paramount. Florence indeed made no\nobjection. To spend a fortnight in Paris;--to hurry over the Alps\nbefore the cold weather came; to spend a month in Florence, and then\ngo on to Rome;--it would all be very nice. But she declared that it\nwould suit the next year better than this.\n\n\"Suit ten thousand fiddlesticks,\" said Harry.\n\n\"But it is October now.\"\n\n\"And therefore there is no time to lose.\"\n\n\"I haven't a dress in the world but the one I have on, and a few\nothers like it. Oh, Harry, how can you talk in that way?\"\n\n\"Well, say four weeks then from now. That will make it the seventh of\nNovember, and we'll only stay a day or two in Paris. We can do Paris\nnext year,--in May. If you'll agree to that, I'll agree.\"\n\nBut Florence's breath was taken away from her, and she could agree to\nnothing. She did agree to nothing till she had been talked into doing\nso by Mrs. Clavering.\n\n\"My dear,\" said her future mother-in-law, \"what you say is\nundoubtedly true. There is no absolute necessity for hurrying. It is\nnot an affair of life and death. But you and Harry have been engaged\nquite long enough now, and I really don't see why you should put it\noff. If you do as he asks you, you will just have time to make\nyourselves comfortable before the cold weather begins.\"\n\n\"But mamma will be so surprised.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she will wish it, my dear. You see Harry is a young man of\nthat sort,--so impetuous I mean, you know, and so eager,--and so--you\nknow what I mean,--that the sooner he is married the better. You\ncan't but take it as a compliment, Florence, that he is so eager.\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"And you should reward him. Believe me it will be best that it should\nnot be delayed.\" Whether or no Mrs. Clavering had present in her\nimagination the possibility of any further danger that might result\nfrom Lady Ongar, I will not say, but if so, she altogether failed in\ncommunicating her idea to Florence.\n\n\"Then I must go home at once,\" said Florence, driven almost to bewail\nthe terrors of her position.\n\n\"You can write home at once and tell your mother. You can tell her\nall that I say, and I am sure she will agree with me. If you wish it,\nI will write a line to Mrs. Burton myself.\" Florence said that she\nwould wish it. \"And we can begin, you know, to get your things ready\nhere. People don't take so long about all that now-a-days as they\nused to do.\" When Mrs. Clavering had turned against her, Florence\nknew that she had no hope, and surrendered, subject to the approval\nof the higher authorities at Stratton. The higher authorities at\nStratton approved also, of course, and Florence found herself fixed\nto a day with a suddenness that bewildered her. Immediately,--almost\nas soon as the consent had been extorted from her,--she began to be\nsurrounded with incipient preparation for the event, as to which,\nabout three weeks since, she had made up her mind that it would never\ncome to pass.\n\nOn the second day of her arrival, in the privacy of her bedroom,\nFanny communicated to her the decision of her family in regard to\nMr. Saul. But she told the story at first as though this decision\nreferred to the living only,--as though the rectory were to be\nconferred on Mr. Saul without any burden attached to it. \"He has\nbeen here so long, dear,\" said Fanny, \"and understands the people so\nwell.\"\n\n\"I am so delighted,\" said Florence.\n\n\"I am sure it is the best thing papa could do;--that is if he quite\nmakes up his mind to give up the parish himself.\"\n\nThis troubled Florence, who did not know that a baronet could hold a\nliving.\n\n\"I thought he must give up being a clergyman now that Sir Hugh is\ndead?\"\n\n\"O dear, no.\" And then Fanny, who was great on ecclesiastical\nsubjects, explained it all. \"Even though he were to be a peer,\nhe could hold a living if he pleased. A great many baronets are\nclergymen, and some of them do hold preferments. As to papa, the\ndoubt has been with him whether he would wish to give up the work.\nBut he will preach sometimes, you know; though of course he will not\nbe able to do that unless Mr. Saul lets him. No one but the rector\nhas a right to his own pulpit except the bishop; and he can preach\nthree times a year if he likes it.\"\n\n\"And suppose the bishop wanted to preach four times?\"\n\n\"He couldn't do it; at least, I believe not. But you see he never\nwants to preach at all,--not in such a place as this,--so that does\nnot signify.\"\n\n\"And will Mr. Saul come and live here, in this house?\"\n\n\"Some day I suppose he will,\" said Fanny, blushing.\n\n\"And you, dear?\"\n\n\"I don't know how that may be.\"\n\n\"Come, Fanny.\"\n\n\"Indeed I don't, Florence, or I would tell you. Of course Mr. Saul\nhas asked me. I never had any secret with you about that; have I?\"\n\n\"No; you were very good.\"\n\n\"Then he asked me again; twice again. And then there came,--oh, such\na quarrel between him and papa. It was so terrible. Do you know, I\nbelieve they wouldn't speak in the vestry! Not but what each of them\nhas the highest possible opinion of the other. But of course Mr. Saul\ncouldn't marry on a curacy. When I think of it it really seems that\nhe must have been mad.\"\n\n\"But you don't think him so mad now, dear?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know a word about it yet; not a word. He hasn't been in\nthe house since, and papa and he didn't speak,--not in a friendly\nway,--till the news came of poor Hugh's being drowned. Then he came\nup to papa, and, of course, papa took his hand. But he still thinks\nhe is going away.\"\n\n\"And when is he to be told that he needn't go?\"\n\n\"That is the difficulty. Mamma will have to do it, I believe. But\nwhat she will say, I'm sure I for one can't think.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clavering will have no difficulty.\"\n\n\"You mustn't call her Mrs. Clavering.\"\n\n\"Lady Clavering then.\"\n\n\"That's a great deal worse. She's your mamma now,--not quite so much\nas she is mine, but the next thing to it.\"\n\n\"She'll know what to say to Mr. Saul.\"\n\n\"But what is she to say?\"\n\n\"Well, Fanny,--you ought to know that. I suppose you do--love him?\"\n\n\"I have never told him so.\"\n\n\"But you will?\"\n\n\"It seems so odd. Mamma will have to-- Suppose he were to turn round\nand say he didn't want me?\"\n\n\"That would be awkward.\"\n\n\"He would in a minute if that was what he felt. The idea of having\nthe living would not weigh with him a bit.\"\n\n\"But when he was so much in love before, it won't make him out of\nlove;--will it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Fanny. \"At any rate, mamma is to see him\nto-morrow, and after that I suppose;--I'm sure I don't know,--but I\nsuppose he'll come to the rectory as he used to do.\"\n\n\"How happy you must be,\" said Florence, kissing her. To this Fanny\nmade some unintelligible demur. It was undoubtedly possible that,\nunder the altered circumstances of the case, so strange a being as\nMr. Saul might have changed his mind.\n\nThere was a great trial awaiting Florence Burton. She had to be taken\nup to call on the ladies at the great house,--on the two widowed\nladies who were still remaining there when she came to Clavering.\nIt was only on the day before her arrival that Harry had seen Lady\nOngar. He had thought much of the matter before he went across to\nthe house, doubting whether it would not be better to let Julia go\nwithout troubling her with a further interview. But he had not then\nseen even Lady Clavering since the tidings of her bereavement had\ncome, and he felt that it would not be well that he should let his\ncousin's widow leave Clavering without offering her his sympathy. And\nit might be better, also, that he should see Julia once again, if\nonly that he might show himself capable of meeting her without the\nexhibition of any peculiar emotion. He went, therefore, to the house,\nand having asked for Lady Clavering, saw both the sisters together.\nHe soon found that the presence of the younger one was a relief to\nhim. Lady Clavering was so sad, and so peevish in her sadness,--so\nbroken-spirited, so far as yet from recognizing the great\nenfranchisement that had come to her, that with her alone he would\nhave found himself almost unable to express the sympathy which he\nfelt. But with Lady Ongar he had no difficulty. Lady Ongar, her\nsister being with them in the room, talked to him easily, as though\nthere had never been anything between them to make conversation\ndifficult. That all words between them should, on such an occasion\nas this, be sad, was a matter of course; but it seemed to Harry that\nJulia had freed herself from all the effects of that feeling which\nhad existed between them, and that it would become him to do this\nas effectually as she had done it. Such an idea, at least, was in\nhis mind for a moment; but when he left her she spoke one word\nwhich dispelled it. \"Harry,\" she said, \"you must ask Miss Burton\nto come across and see me. I hear that she is to be at the rectory\nto-morrow.\" Harry of course said that he would send her. \"She will\nunderstand why I cannot go to her, as I should do,--but for poor\nHermy's position. You will explain this, Harry.\" Harry, blushing up\nto his forehead, declared that Florence would require no explanation,\nand that she would certainly make the visit as proposed. \"I wish to\nsee her, Harry,--so much. And if I do not see her now, I may never\nhave another chance.\"\n\nIt was nearly a week after this that Florence went across to\nthe great house with Mrs. Clavering and Fanny. I think that she\nunderstood the nature of the visit she was called upon to make,\nand no doubt she trembled much at the coming ordeal. She was going\nto see her great rival,--her rival, who had almost been preferred\nto her,--nay, who had been preferred to her for some short space\nof time, and whose claims as to beauty and wealth were so greatly\nsuperior to her own. And this woman whom she was to see had been the\nfirst love of the man whom she now regarded as her own,--and would\nhave been about to be his wife at this moment had it not been for her\nown treachery to him. Was she so beautiful as people said? Florence,\nin the bottom of her heart, wished that she might have been saved\nfrom this interview.\n\nThe three ladies from the rectory found the two ladies at the great\nhouse sitting together in the small drawing-room. Florence was\nso confused that she could hardly bring herself to speak to Lady\nClavering, or so much as to look at Lady Ongar. She shook hands with\nthe elder sister, and knew that her hand was then taken by the other.\nJulia at first spoke a very few words to Mrs. Clavering, and Fanny\nsat herself down beside Hermione. Florence took a chair at a little\ndistance, and was left there for a few minutes without notice. For\nthis she was very thankful, and by degrees was able to fix her eyes\non the face of the woman whom she so feared to see, and yet on whom\nshe so desired to look. Lady Clavering was a mass of ill-arranged\nwidow's weeds. She had assumed in all its grotesque ugliness those\nparaphernalia of outward woe which women have been condemned to wear,\nin order that for a time they may be shorn of all the charms of\ntheir sex. Nothing could be more proper or unbecoming than the heavy,\ndrooping, shapeless blackness in which Lady Clavering had enveloped\nherself. But Lady Ongar, though also a widow, though as yet a\nwidow of not twelve months' standing, was dressed,--in weeds, no\ndoubt,--but in weeds which had been so cultivated that they were as\ngood as flowers. She was very beautiful. Florence owned to herself\nas she sat there in silence, that Lady Ongar was the most beautiful\nwoman that she had ever seen. But hers was not the beauty by which,\nas she would have thought, Harry Clavering would have been attracted.\nLady Ongar's form, bust, and face were, at this period of her life,\nalmost majestic; whereas the softness and grace of womanhood were the\ncharms which Harry loved. He had sometimes said to Florence that, to\nhis taste, Cecilia Burton was almost perfect as a woman. And there\ncould be no contrast greater than that between Cecilia Burton and\nLady Ongar. But Florence did not remember that the Julia Brabazon of\nthree years since had not been the same as the Lady Ongar whom now\nshe saw.\n\nWhen they had been there some minutes Lady Ongar came and sat beside\nFlorence, moving her seat as though she were doing the most natural\nthing in the world. Florence's heart came to her mouth, but she made\na resolution that she would, if possible, bear herself well. \"You\nhave been at Clavering before, I think?\" said Lady Ongar. Florence\nsaid that she had been at the parsonage during the last Easter.\n\"Yes,--I heard that you dined here with my brother-in-law.\" This she\nsaid in a low voice, having seen that Lady Clavering was engaged with\nFanny and Mrs. Clavering. \"Was it not terribly sudden?\"\n\n\"Terribly sudden,\" said Florence.\n\n\"The two brothers! Had you not met Captain Clavering?\"\n\n\"Yes,--he was here when I dined with your sister.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow! Is it not odd that they should have gone, and that\ntheir friend, whose yacht it was, should have been saved? They say,\nhowever, that Mr. Stuart behaved admirably, begging his friends to\nget into the boat first. He stayed by the vessel when the boat was\ncarried away, and he was saved in that way. But he meant to do the\nbest he could for them. There's no doubt of that.\"\n\n\"But how dreadful his feelings must be!\"\n\n\"Men do not think so much of these things as we do. They have so much\nmore to employ their minds. Don't you think so?\" Florence did not at\nthe moment quite know what she thought about men's feelings, but said\nthat she supposed that such was the case. \"But I think that after\nall they are juster than we are,\" continued Lady Ongar,--\"juster and\ntruer, though not so tender-hearted. Mr. Stuart, no doubt, would have\nbeen willing to drown himself to save his friends, because the fault\nwas in some degree his. I don't know that I should have been able to\ndo so much.\"\n\n\"In such a moment it must have been so difficult to think of what\nought to be done.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; and there is but little good in speculating upon it\nnow. You know this place, do you not;--the house, I mean, and the\ngardens?\"\n\n\"Not very well.\" Florence, as she answered this question, began again\nto tremble. \"Take a turn with me, and I will show you the garden. My\nhat and cloak are in the hall.\" Then Florence got up to accompany\nher, trembling very much inwardly. \"Miss Burton and I are going\nout for a few minutes,\" said Lady Ongar, addressing herself to Mrs.\nClavering. \"We will not keep you waiting very long.\"\n\n\"We are in no hurry,\" said Mrs. Clavering. Then Florence was carried\noff, and found herself alone with her conquered rival.\n\n\"Not that there is much to show you,\" said Lady Ongar; \"indeed\nnothing; but the place must be of more interest to you than to any\none else; and if you are fond of that sort of thing, no doubt you\nwill make it all that is charming.\"\n\n\"I am very fond of a garden,\" said Florence.\n\n\"I don't know whether I am. Alone, by myself, I think I should care\nnothing for the prettiest Eden in all England. I don't think I\nwould care for a walk through the Elysian fields by myself. I am a\nchameleon, and take the colour of those with whom I live. My future\ncolours will not be very bright as I take it. It's a gloomy place\nenough; is it not? But there are fine trees, you see, which are the\nonly things which one cannot by any possibility command. Given good\ntrees, taste and money may do anything very quickly; as I have no\ndoubt you'll find.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose I shall have much to do with it--at present.\"\n\n\"I should think that you will have everything to do with it. There,\nMiss Burton; I brought you here to show you this very spot, and to\nmake to you my confession here,--and to get from you, here, one word\nof confidence, if you will give it me.\" Florence was trembling now\noutwardly as well as inwardly. \"You know my story; as far, I mean, as\nI had a story once, in conjunction with Harry Clavering?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Lady Ongar and Florence.]\n\n\n\"I think I do,\" said Florence.\n\n\"I am sure you do,\" said Lady Ongar. \"He has told me that you do; and\nwhat he says is always true. It was here, on this spot, that I gave\nhim back his troth to me, and told him that I would have none of his\nlove, because he was poor. That is barely two years ago. Now he is\npoor no longer. Now, had I been true to him, a marriage with him\nwould have been, in a prudential point of view, all that any woman\ncould desire. I gave up the dearest heart, the sweetest temper, ay,\nand the truest man that, that-- Well, you have won him instead, and\nhe has been the gainer. I doubt whether I ever should have made him\nhappy; but I know that you will do so. It was just here that I parted\nfrom him.\"\n\n\"He has told me of that parting,\" said Florence.\n\n\"I am sure he has. And, Miss Burton, if you will allow me to say one\nword further,--do not be made to think any ill of him because of what\nhappened the other day.\"\n\n\"I think no ill of him,\" said Florence proudly.\n\n\"That is well. But I am sure you do not. You are not one to think\nevil, as I take it, of anybody; much less of him whom you love. When\nhe saw me again, free as I am, and when I saw him, thinking him also\nto be free, was it strange that some memory of old days should come\nback upon us? But the fault, if fault there has been, was mine.\"\n\n\"I have never said that there was any fault.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Burton; but others have said so. No doubt I am foolish\nto talk to you in this way; and I have not yet said that which I\ndesired to say. It is simply this;--that I do not begrudge you your\nhappiness. I wished the same happiness to be mine; but it is not\nmine. It might have been, but I forfeited it. It is past; and I will\npray that you may enjoy it long. You will not refuse to receive my\ncongratulations?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I will not.\"\n\n\"Or to think of me as a friend of your husband's?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"That is all then. I have shown you the gardens, and now we may\ngo in. Some day, perhaps, when you are Lady Paramount here, and\nyour children are running about the place, I may come again to see\nthem;--if you and he will have me.\"\n\n\"I hope you will, Lady Ongar. In truth, I hope so.\"\n\n\"It is odd enough that I said to him once that I would never go to\nClavering Park again till I went there to see his wife. That was long\nbefore those two poor brothers perished,--before I had ever heard of\nFlorence Burton. And yet, indeed, it was not very long ago. It was\nsince my husband died. But that was not quite true, for here I am,\nand he has not yet got a wife. But it was odd; was it not?\"\n\n\"I cannot think what should have made you say that.\"\n\n\"A spirit of prophecy comes on one sometimes, I suppose. Well; shall\nwe go in? I have shown you all the wonders of the garden, and told\nyou all the wonders connected with it of which I know aught. No doubt\nthere would be other wonders, more wonderful, if one could ransack\nthe private history of all the Claverings for the last hundred years.\nI hope, Miss Burton, that any marvels which may attend your career\nhere may be happy marvels.\" She then took Florence by the hand, and\ndrawing close to her, stooped over and kissed her. \"You will think me\na fool, of course,\" said she; \"but I do not care for that.\" Florence\nnow was in tears, and could make no answer in words; but she pressed\nthe hand which she still held, and then followed her companion back\ninto the house. After that, the visit was soon brought to an end, and\nthe three ladies from the rectory returned across the park to their\nhouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nFlorence Burton had taken upon herself to say that Mrs. Clavering\nwould have no difficulty in making to Mr. Saul the communication\nwhich was now needed before he could be received at the rectory, as\nthe rector's successor and future son-in-law; but Mrs. Clavering\nwas by no means so confident of her own powers. To her it seemed as\nthough the undertaking which she had in hand, was one surrounded with\ndifficulties. Her husband, when the matter was being discussed, at\nonce made her understand that he would not relieve her by an offer\nto perform the task. He had been made to break the bad news to Lady\nClavering, and, having been submissive in that matter, felt himself\nable to stand aloof altogether as to this more difficult embassy.\n\"I suppose it would hardly do to ask Harry to see him again,\" Mrs.\nClavering had said. \"You would do it much better, my dear,\" the\nrector had replied. Then Mrs. Clavering had submitted in her turn;\nand when the scheme was fully matured, and the time had come in\nwhich the making of the proposition could no longer be delayed with\nprudence, Mr. Saul was summoned by a short note. \"Dear Mr. Saul,--If\nyou are disengaged would you come to me at the rectory at eleven\nto-morrow?--Yours ever, M. C.\" Mr. Saul of course said that he would\ncome. When the to-morrow had arrived and breakfast was over, the\nrector and Harry took themselves off, somewhere about the grounds of\nthe great house,--counting up their treasures of proprietorship, as\nwe can fancy that men so circumstanced would do,--while Mary Fielding\nwith Fanny and Florence retired upstairs, so that they might be\nwell out of the way. They knew, all of them, what was about to be\ndone, and Fanny behaved herself like a white lamb decked with bright\nribbons for the sacrificial altar. To her it was a sacrificial\nmorning,--very sacred, very solemn, and very trying to the nerves.\n\"I don't think that any girl was ever in such a position before,\" she\nsaid to her sister. \"A great many girls would be glad to be in the\nsame position,\" Mrs. Fielding replied. \"Do you think so? To me there\nis something almost humiliating in the idea that he should be asked\nto take me.\" \"Fiddlestick, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Fielding.\n\nMr. Saul came, punctual as the church clock,--of which he had the\nregulating himself,--and was shown into the rectory dining-room,\nwhere Mrs. Clavering was sitting alone. He looked, as he ever did,\nserious, composed, ill-dressed, and like a gentleman. Of course he\nmust have supposed that the present rector would make some change\nin his mode of living, and could not be surprised that he should\nhave been summoned to the rectory;--but he was surprised that the\nsummons should have come from Mrs. Clavering, and not from the\nrector himself. It appeared to him that the old enmity must be very\nenduring, if, even now, Mr. Clavering could not bring himself to see\nhis curate on a matter of business.\n\n\"It seems a long time since we have seen you here, Mr. Saul,\" said\nMrs. Clavering.\n\n\"Yes;--when I have remembered how often I used to be here, my absence\nhas seemed long and strange.\"\n\n\"It has been a source of great grief to me.\"\n\n\"And to me, Mrs. Clavering.\"\n\n\"But, as circumstances then were, in truth it could not be avoided.\nCommon prudence made it necessary. Don't you think so, Mr. Saul?\"\n\n\"If you ask me I must answer according to my own ideas. Common\nprudence should not have made it necessary,--at least not according\nto my view of things. Common prudence, with different people, means\nsuch different things! But I am not going to quarrel with your ideas\nof common prudence, Mrs. Clavering.\"\n\nMrs. Clavering had begun badly, and was aware of it. She should have\nsaid nothing about the past. She had foreseen, from the first, the\ndanger of doing so, but had been unable to rush at once into the\ngolden future. \"I hope we shall have no more quarrelling at any\nrate,\" she said.\n\n\"There shall be none on my part. Only, Mrs. Clavering, you must not\nsuppose from my saying so that I intend to give up my pretensions.\nA word from your daughter would make me do so, but no words from any\none else.\"\n\n\"She ought to be very proud of such constancy on your part, Mr. Saul,\nand I have no doubt she will be.\" Mr. Saul did not understand this,\nand made no reply to it. \"I don't know whether you have heard that\nMr. Clavering intends to--give up the living.\"\n\n\"I have not heard it. I have thought it probable that he would do\nso.\"\n\n\"He has made up his mind that he will. The fact is, that if he held\nit, he must neglect either that or the property.\" We will not stop\nat this moment to examine what Mr. Saul's ideas must have been as to\nthe exigencies of the property, which would leave no time for the\nperformance of such clerical duties as had fallen for some years past\nto the share of the rector himself. \"He hopes that he may be allowed\nto take some part in the services,--but he means to resign the\nliving.\"\n\n\"I suppose that will not much affect me for the little time that I\nhave to remain.\"\n\n\"We think it will affect you,--and hope that it may. Mr. Clavering\nwishes you to accept the living.\"\n\n\"To accept the living?\" And for a moment even Mr. Saul looked as\nthough he were surprised.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Saul.\"\n\n\"To be rector of Clavering?\"\n\n\"If you see no objection to such an arrangement.\"\n\n\"It is a most munificent offer,--but as strange as it is munificent.\nUnless indeed--\" And then some glimpse of the truth made its way into\nthe chinks of Mr. Saul's mind.\n\n\"Mr. Clavering would, no doubt, have made the offer to you himself,\nhad it not been that I can, perhaps, speak to you about dear Fanny\nbetter than he could do. Though our prudence has not been quite to\nyour mind, you can at any rate understand that we might very much\nobject to her marrying you when there was nothing for you to live on,\neven though we had no objection to yourself personally.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Clavering did object on both grounds.\"\n\n\"I was not aware that he had done so; but, if so, no such objection\nis now made by him,--or by me. My idea is that a child should\nbe allowed to consult her own heart, and to indulge her own\nchoice,--provided that in doing so she does not prepare for herself\na life of indigence, which must be a life of misery; and of course\nproviding also that there be no strong personal objection.\"\n\n\"A life of indigence need not be a life of misery,\" said Mr. Saul,\nwith that obstinacy which formed so great a part of his character.\n\n\"Well, well.\"\n\n\"I am very indigent, but I am not at all miserable. If we are to be\nmade miserable by that, what is the use of all our teaching?\"\n\n\"But, at any rate, a competence is comfortable.\"\n\n\"Too comfortable!\" As Mr. Saul made this exclamation, Mrs. Clavering\ncould not but wonder at her daughter's taste. But the matter had gone\ntoo far now for any possibility of receding.\n\n\"You will not refuse it, I hope, as it will be accompanied by what\nyou say you still desire.\"\n\n\"No; I will not refuse it. And may God give her and me grace so to\nuse the riches of this world that they become not a stumbling-block\nto us, and a rock of offence. It is possible that the camel should be\nmade to go through the needle's eye. It is possible.\"\n\n\"The position, you know, is not one of great wealth.\"\n\n\"It is to me, who have barely hitherto had the means of support. Will\nyou tell your husband from me that I will accept, and endeavour not\nto betray the double trust he proposes to confer on me. It is much\nthat he should give to me his daughter. She shall be to me bone of my\nbone, and flesh of my flesh. If God will give me his grace thereto, I\nwill watch over her, so that no harm shall come nigh her. I love her\nas the apple of my eye; and I am thankful,--very thankful that the\nrich gift should be made to me.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you love her, Mr. Saul.\"\n\n\"But,\" continued he, not marking her interruption, \"that other trust\nis one still greater, and requiring a more tender care and even a\ncloser sympathy. I shall feel that the souls of these people will be,\nas it were, in my hand, and that I shall be called upon to give an\naccount of their welfare. I will strive,--I will strive. And she,\nalso, will be with me, to help me.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Clavering described this scene to her husband, he shook his\nhead; and there came over his face a smile, in which there was much\nof melancholy, as he said, \"Ah, yes,--that is all very well now. He\nwill settle down as other men do, I suppose, when he has four or five\nchildren around him.\" Such were the ideas which the experience of\nthe outgoing and elder clergyman taught him to entertain as to the\necstatic piety of his younger brother.\n\nIt was Mrs. Clavering who suggested to Mr. Saul that perhaps he would\nlike to see Fanny. This she did when her story had been told, and he\nwas preparing to leave her. \"Certainly, if she will come to me.\"\n\n\"I will make no promise,\" said Mrs. Clavering, \"but I will see.\" Then\nshe went upstairs to the room where the girls were sitting, and the\nsacrificial lamb was sent down into the drawing-room. \"I suppose if\nyou say so, mamma--\"\n\n\"I think, my dear, that you had better see him. You will meet then\nmore comfortably afterwards.\" So Fanny went into the drawing-room,\nand Mr. Saul was sent to her there. What passed between them all\nreaders of these pages will understand. Few young ladies, I fear,\nwill envy Fanny Clavering her lover; but they will remember that Love\nwill still be lord of all; and they will acknowledge that he had done\nmuch to deserve the success in life which had come in his way.\n\nIt was long before the old rector could reconcile himself either\nto the new rector or his new son-in-law. Mrs. Clavering had now\nso warmly taken up Fanny's part, and had so completely assumed a\nmother's interest in her coming marriage, that Mr. Clavering, or Sir\nHenry, as we may now call him, had found himself obliged to abstain\nfrom repeating to her the wonder with which he still regarded his\ndaughter's choice. But to Harry he could still be eloquent on the\nsubject. \"Of course it's all right now,\" he said. \"He's a very good\nyoung man, and nobody would work harder in the parish. I always\nthought I was very lucky to have such an assistant. But upon my word\nI cannot understand Fanny; I cannot indeed.\"\n\n\"She has been taken by the religious side of her character,\" said\nHarry.\n\n\"Yes, of course. And no doubt it is very gratifying to me to see that\nshe thinks so much of religion. It should be the first consideration\nwith all of us at all times. But she has never been used to men like\nMr. Saul.\"\n\n\"Nobody can deny that he is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes; he is a gentleman. God forbid that I should say he was not;\nespecially now that he is going to marry your sister. But-- I don't\nknow whether you quite understand what I mean?\"\n\n\"I think I do. He isn't quite one of our sort.\"\n\n\"How on earth she can ever have brought herself to look at him in\nthat light!\"\n\n\"There's no accounting for tastes, sir. And, after all, as he's to\nhave the living, there will be nothing to regret.\"\n\n\"No; nothing to regret. I suppose he'll be up at the other house\noccasionally. I never could make anything of him when he dined at the\nrectory; perhaps he'll be better there. Perhaps, when he's married,\nhe'll get into the way of drinking a glass of wine like anybody else.\nDear Fanny; I hope she'll be happy. That's everything.\" In answer to\nthis Harry took upon himself to assure his father that Fanny would\nbe happy; and then they changed the conversation, and discussed the\nalterations which they would make in reference to the preservation of\npheasants.\n\nMr. Saul and Fanny remained long together on that occasion, and when\nthey parted he went off about his work, not saying a word to any\nother person in the house, and she betook herself as fast as her feet\ncould carry her to her own room. She said not a word either to her\nmother, or to her sister, or to Florence as to what had passed at\nthat interview; but, when she was first seen by any of them, she\nwas very grave in her demeanour, and very silent. When her father\ncongratulated her, which he did with as much cordiality as he was\nable to assume, she kissed him and thanked him for his care and\nkindness; but even this she did almost solemnly. \"Ah, I see how it\nis to be,\" said the old rector to his wife. \"There are to be no more\ncakes and ale in the parish.\" Then his wife reminded him of what he\nhimself had said of the change which would take place in Mr. Saul's\nways when he should have a lot of children running about his feet.\n\"Then I can only hope that they'll begin to run about very soon,\"\nsaid the old rector.\n\nTo her sister, Mary Fielding, Fanny said little or nothing of her\ncoming marriage, but to Florence, who, as regarded that event, was\nin the same position as herself, she frequently did express her\nfeelings,--declaring how awful to her was the responsibility of\nthe thing she was about to do. \"Of course that's quite true,\" said\nFlorence, \"but it doesn't make one doubt that one is right to marry.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Fanny. \"When I think of it, it does almost make\nme doubt.\"\n\n\"Then if I were Mr. Saul I would not let you think of it at all.\"\n\n\"Ah;--that shows that you do not understand him. He would be the\nfirst to advise me to hesitate if he thought that,--that--that;--I\ndon't know that I can quite express what I mean.\"\n\n\"Under those circumstances Mr. Saul won't think\nthat,--that--that--that--\"\n\n\"Oh, Florence, it is too serious for laughing. It is indeed.\" Then\nFlorence also hoped that a time might come, and that shortly, in\nwhich Mr. Saul might moderate his views,--though she did not express\nherself exactly as the rector had done.\n\nImmediately after this Florence went back to Stratton, in order that\nshe might pass what remained to her of her freedom with her mother\nand father, and that she might prepare herself for her wedding. The\naffair with her was so much hurried that she had hardly time to give\nher mind to those considerations which were weighing so heavily\non Fanny's mind. It was felt by all the Burtons,--especially by\nCecilia,--that there was need for extension of their views in regard\nto millinery, seeing that Florence was to marry the eldest son\nand heir of a baronet. And old Mrs. Burton was awed almost into\nquiescence by the reflections which came upon her when she thought\nof the breakfast, and of the presence of Sir Henry Clavering. She at\nonce summoned her daughter-in-law from Ramsgate to her assistance,\nand felt that all her experience, gathered from the wedding\nbreakfasts of so many elder daughters, would hardly carry her through\nthe difficulties of the present occasion.\n\nThe two widowed sisters were still at the great house when Sir Henry\nClavering with Harry and Fanny went to Stratton, but they left it on\nthe following day. The father and son went up together to bid them\nfarewell, on the eve of their departure, and to press upon them,\nover and over again, the fact that they were still to regard the\nClaverings of Clavering Park as their nearest relations and friends.\nThe elder sister simply cried when this was said to her,--cried\neasily with plenteous tears, till the weeds which enveloped her\nseemed to be damp from the ever-running fountain. Hitherto, to\nweep had been her only refuge; but I think that even this had\nalready become preferable to her former life. Lady Ongar assured Sir\nHenry, or Mr. Clavering, as he was still called till after their\ndeparture,--that she would always remember and accept his kindness.\n\"And you will come to us?\" said he. \"Certainly; when I can make Hermy\ncome. She will be better when the summer is here. And then, after\nthat, we will think about it.\" On this occasion she seemed to be\nquite cheerful herself, and bade Harry farewell with all the frank\naffection of an old friend.\n\n\"I have given up the house in Bolton Street,\" she said to him.\n\n\"And where do you mean to live?\"\n\n\"Anywhere; just as it may suit Hermy. What difference does it make?\nWe are going to Tenby now, and though Tenby seems to me to have as\nfew attractions as any place I ever knew, I daresay we shall stay\nthere, simply because we shall be there. That is the consideration\nwhich weighs most with such old women as we are. Good-by, Harry.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Julia. I hope that I may yet see you,--you and Hermy, happy\nbefore long.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about happiness, Harry. There comes a dream of it\nsometimes,--such as you have got now. But I will answer for this: you\nshall never hear of my being down-hearted. At least not on my own\naccount,\" she added in a whisper. \"Poor Hermy may sometimes drag me\ndown. But I will do my best. And, Harry, tell your wife that I shall\nwrite to her occasionally,--once a year, or something like that; so\nthat she need not be afraid. Good-by, Harry.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Julia.\" And so they parted.\n\nImmediately on her arrival at Tenby, Lady Ongar communicated to Mr.\nTurnbull her intention of giving back to the Courton family, not only\nthe place called Ongar Park, but also the whole of her income with\nthe exception of eight hundred a year, so that in that respect she\nmight be equal to her sister. This brought Mr. Turnbull down to\nTenby, and there was interview after interview between the countess\nand the lawyer. The proposition, however, was made to the Courtons,\nand was absolutely refused by them. Ongar Park was accepted on behalf\nof the mother of the present earl; but as regarded the money, the\nwidow of the late earl was assured by the elder surviving brother\nthat no one doubted her right to it, or would be a party to accepting\nit from her. \"Then,\" said Lady Ongar, \"it will accumulate in my\nhands, and I can leave it as I please in my will.\"\n\n\"As to that, no one can control you,\" said her brother-in-law--who\nwent to Tenby to see her; \"but you must not be angry, if I advise\nyou not to make any such resolution. Such hoards never have good\nresults.\" This good result, however, did come from the effort which\nthe poor broken-spirited woman was making,--that an intimacy, and at\nlast a close friendship, was formed between her and the relatives of\nher deceased lord.\n\nAnd now my story is done. My readers will easily understand what\nwould be the future life of Harry Clavering and his wife after the\ncompletion of that tour in Italy, and the birth of the heir,--the\npreparations for which made the tour somewhat shorter than Harry had\nintended. His father, of course, gave up to him the shooting, and\nthe farming of the home farm,--and after a while, the management of\nthe property. Sir Henry preached occasionally,--believing himself to\npreach much oftener than he did,--and usually performed some portion\nof the morning service.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Theodore Burton, in answer to some comfortable remark\nfrom his wife; \"Providence has done very well for Florence. And\nProvidence has done very well for him also;--but Providence was\nmaking a great mistake when she expected him to earn his bread.\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CLAVERINGS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 15766-8.txt or 15766-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/5\/7\/6\/15766\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":868,"split":"train"}
