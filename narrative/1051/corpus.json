He matriculated as a student at Oxford University, an institution which he found at a low ebb.\nTo the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.\nOf one of his tutors Gibbon says that he \"well remembered that he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to perform.\" Gibbon's father took alarm on learning that he had converted to Roman Catholicism and, in order to bring him back to the Protestant fold, sent him to live with a Calvinist minister in Lausanne. Gibbon made good use of his time in Switzerland, meeting Voltaire and other literary figures, and perfecting his command of the French language. He also fell in love with a Swiss girl, Suzanne Curchod, but his wish to marry her was implacably opposed by his father. \"I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son.\" On returning to England he published his first work, the Essai sur l'\u0102\u0160tude de la litt\u0102\u0160rature. The next major event Gibbon mentions was his taking a commission in the Hampshire militia, an experience which he tells us was later to be of advantage to him:\nThe discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.\nHe then details his travels through France and on to Lausanne, where he formed a friendship with John Holroyd, later Lord Sheffield, which was to last for the rest of his life. Gibbon crossed the Alps into Italy and eventually reached Rome. He had for some time wanted to begin writing a history, without being able to choose a subject, but now, he tells us, the exciting experience of walking in the footsteps of the heroes of antiquity gave him a new idea:\nIt was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.\nAfter returning to England Gibbon engaged in several other literary exercises before finally beginning to write his Roman history. The Memoirs now give a detailed account of the years he spent producing its successive volumes, and of the many hostile criticisms his work attracted. These labours were diversified by his experiences as a Member of Parliament, and his writing, at the request of the Government, a \"M\u0102\u0160moire justificatif\" asserting the justice of British hostilities against France at the time of the American Revolutionary War. During the course of writing the Decline and Fall Gibbon moved back to Lausanne. Gibbon's Memoirs end with a survey of the factors he considered had combined to bring him a happy and productive life.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Memoirs of My Life and Writings, by Edward Gibbon\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Truth, naked unblushing truth, the first virtue of\nmore serious history, must be the sole recommendation of this\npersonal narrative.  The style shall be simple and familiar; but\nstyle is the image of character; and the habits of correct writing\nmay produce, without labour or design, the appearance of art and\nstudy.  My own amusement is my motive, and will be my reward: and if\nthese sheets are communicated to some discreet and indulgent\nfriends, they will be secreted from the public eye till the author\nshall be removed beyond the reach of criticism or ridicule.\n\nA lively desire of knowing and of recording our ancestors so\ngenerally prevails, that it must depend on the influence of some\ncommon principle in the minds of men.  We seem to have lived in the\npersons of our forefathers; it is the labour and reward of vanity to\nextend the term of this ideal longevity.  Our imagination is always\nactive to enlarge the narrow circle in which Nature has confined us.\nFifty or an hundred years may be allotted to an individual, but we\nstep forward beyond death with such hopes as religion and philosophy\nwill suggest; and we fill up the silent vacancy that precedes our\nbirth, by associating ourselves to the authors of our existence.\nOur calmer judgment will rather tend to moderate, than to suppress,\nthe pride of an ancient and worthy race.  The satirist may laugh,\nthe philosopher may preach; but Reason herself will respect the\nprejudices and habits, which have been consecrated by the experience\nof mankind.\n\nWherever the distinction of birth is allowed to form a superior\norder in the state, education and example should always, and will\noften, produce among them a dignity of sentiment and propriety of\nconduct, which is guarded from dishonour by their own and the public\nesteem.  If we read of some illustrious line so ancient that it has\nno beginning, so worthy that it ought to have no end, we sympathize\nin its various fortunes; nor can we blame the generous enthusiasm,\nor even the harmless vanity, of those who are allied to the honours\nof its name.  For my own part, could I draw my pedigree from a\ngeneral, a statesman, or a celebrated author, I should study their\nlives with the diligence of filial love.  In the investigation of\npast events, our curiosity is stimulated by the immediate or\nindirect reference to ourselves; but in the estimate of honour we\nshould learn to value the gifts of Nature above those of Fortune; to\nesteem in our ancestors the qualities that best promote the\ninterests of society; and to pronounce the descendant of a king less\ntruly noble than the offspring of a man of genius, whose writings\nwill instruct or delight the latest posterity.  The family of\nConfucius is, in my opinion, the most illustrious in the world.\nAfter a painful ascent of eight or ten centuries, our barons and\nprinces of Europe are lost in the darkness of the middle ages; but,\nin the vast equality of the empire of China, the posterity of\nConfucius have maintained, above two thousand two hundred years,\ntheir peaceful honours and perpetual succession.  The chief of the\nfamily is still revered, by the sovereign and the people, as the\nlively image of the wisest of mankind.  The nobility of the Spencers\nhas been illustrated and enriched by the trophies of Marlborough;\nbut I exhort them to consider the \"Fairy Queen\" as the most precious\njewel of their coronet.  I have exposed my private feelings, as I\nshall always do, without scruple or reserve.  That these sentiments\nare just, or at least natural, I am inclined to believe, since I do\nnot feel myself interested in the cause; for I can derive from my\nancestors neither glory nor shame.\n\nYet a sincere and simple narrative of my own life may amuse some of\nmy leisure hours; but it will subject me, and perhaps with justice,\nto the imputation of vanity.  I may judge, however, from the\nexperience both of past and of the present times, that the public\nare always curious to know the men, who have left behind them any\nimage of their minds: the most scanty accounts of such men are\ncompiled with diligence, and perused with eagerness; and the student\nof every class may derive a lesson, or an example, from the lives\nmost similar to his own.  My name may hereafter be placed among the\nthousand articles of a Biographic Britannica; and I must be\nconscious, that no one is so well qualified, as myself, to describe\nthe series of my thoughts and actions.  The authority of my masters,\nof the grave Thuanus, and the philosophic Hume, might be sufficient\nto justify my design; but it would not be difficult to produce a\nlong list of ancients and moderns, who, in various forms, have\nexhibited their own portraits.  Such portraits are often the most\ninteresting, and sometimes the only interesting parts of their\nwritings; and if they be sincere, we seldom complain of the\nminuteness or prolixity of these personal memorials.  The lives of\nthe younger Pliny, of Petrarch, and of Erasmus, are expressed in the\nepistles, which they themselves have given to the world.  The essays\nof Montaigne and Sir William Temple bring us home to the houses and\nbosoms of the authors: we smile without contempt at the headstrong\npassions of Benevenuto Cellini, and the gay follies of Colley\nCibber.  The confessions of St. Austin and Rousseau disclose the\nsecrets of the human heart; the commentaries of the learned Huet\nhave survived his evangelical demonstration; and the memoirs of\nGoldoni are more truly dramatic than his Italian comedies.  The\nheretic and the churchman are strongly marked in the characters and\nfortunes of Whiston and Bishop Newton; and even the dullness of\nMichael de Marolles and Anthony Wood acquires some value from the\nfaithful representation of men and manners.  That I am equal or\nsuperior to some of these, the effects of modesty or affectation\ncannot force me to dissemble.\n\nMy family is originally derived from the county of Kent.  The\nSouthern district, which borders on Sussex and the sea, was formerly\noverspread with the great forest Anderida, and even now retains the\ndenomination of the Weald or Woodland.  In this district, and in the\nhundred and parish of Rolvenden, the Gibbons were possessed of lands\nin the year one thousand three hundred and twenty-six; and the elder\nbranch of the family, without much increase or diminution of\nproperty, still adheres to its native soil.  Fourteen years after\nthe first appearance of his name, John Gibbon is recorded as the\nMarmorarius or architect of King Edward the Third: the strong and\nstately castle of Queensborough, which guarded the entrance of the\nMedway, was a monument of his skill; and the grant of an hereditary\ntoll on the passage from Sandwich to Stonar, in the Isle of Thanet,\nis the reward of no vulgar artist.  In the visitations of the\nheralds, the Gibbons are frequently mentioned; they held the rank of\nesquire in an age, when that title was less promiscuously assumed:\none of them, under the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was captain of the\nmilitia of Kent; and a free school, in the neighbouring town of\nBenenden, proclaims the charity and opulence of its founder.  But\ntime, or their own obscurity, has cast a veil of oblivion over the\nvirtues and vices of my Kentish ancestors; their character or\nstation confined them to the labours and pleasures of a rural life:\nnor is it in my power to follow the advice of the poet, in an\ninquiry after a name,--\n\n     \"Go! search it there, where to be born, and die,\n     Of rich and poor makes all the history.\"\n\nSo recent is the institution of our parish registers.  In the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, a younger branch of the\nGibbons of Rolvenden migrated from the country to the city; and from\nthis branch I do not blush to descend.  The law requires some\nabilities; the church imposes some restraints; and before our army\nand navy, our civil establishments, and India empire, had opened so\nmany paths of fortune, the mercantile profession was more frequently\nchosen by youths of a liberal race and education, who aspired to\ncreate their own independence.  Our most respectable families have\nnot disdained the counting-house, or even the shop; their names are\nenrolled in the Livery and Companies of London; and in England, as\nwell as in the Italian commonwealths, heralds have been compelled to\ndeclare that gentility is not degraded by the exercise of trade.\n\nThe armorial ensigns which, in the times of chivalry, adorned the\ncrest and shield of the soldier, are now become an empty decoration,\nwhich every man, who has money to build a carriage, may paint\naccording to his fancy on the panels.  My family arms are the same,\nwhich were borne by the Gibbons of Kent in an age, when the College\nof Heralds religiously guarded the distinctions of blood and name: a\nlion rampant gardant, between three schallop-shells argent, on a\nfield azure.  I should not however have been tempted to blazon my\ncoat of arms, were it not connected with a whimsical anecdote. About\nthe reign of James the First, the three harmless schallop-shells\nwere changed by Edmund Gibbon esq. into three ogresses, or female\ncannibals, with a design of stigmatizing three ladies, his\nkinswomen, who had provoked him by an unjust law-suit.  But this\nsingular mode of revenge, for which he obtained the sanction of Sir\nWilliam Seagar, king at arms, soon expired with its author; and, on\nhis own monument in the Temple church, the monsters vanish, and the\nthree schallop-shells resume their proper and hereditary place.\n\nOur alliances by marriage it is not disgraceful to mention.  The\nchief honour of my ancestry is James Fiens, Baron Say and Scale, and\nLord High Treasurer of England, in the reign of Henry the Sixth;\nfrom whom by the Phelips, the Whetnalls, and the Cromers, I am\nlineally descended in the eleventh degree.  His dismission and\nimprisonment in the Tower were insufficient to appease the popular\nclamour; and the Treasurer, with his son-in-law Cromer, was\nbeheaded(1450), after a mock trial by the Kentish insurgents.  The\nblack list of his offences, as it is exhibited in Shakespeare,\ndisplays the ignorance and envy of a plebeian tyrant.  Besides the\nvague reproaches of selling Maine and Normandy to the Dauphin, the\nTreasurer is specially accused of luxury, for riding on a\nfoot-cloth; and of treason, for speaking French, the language of our\nenemies: \"Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the\nrealm,\" says Jack Cade to the unfortunate Lord, \"in erecting a\ngrammar-school; and whereas before our forefathers had no other\nbooks than the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be\nused; and, contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou hast\nbuilt a paper-mill.  It will be proved to thy face, that thou hast\nmen about thee, who usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such\nabominable words, as no Christian ear can endure to hear.\"  Our\ndramatic poet is generally more attentive to character than to\nhistory; and I much fear that the art of printing was not introduced\ninto England, till several years after Lord Say's death; but of some\nof these meritorious crimes I should hope to find my ancestor\nguilty; and a man of letters may be proud of his descent from a\npatron and martyr of learning.\n\nIn the beginning of the last century Robert Gibbon Esq. of Rolvenden\nin Kent (who died in 1618), had a son of the same name of Robert,\nwho settled in London, and became a member of the Cloth-workers'\nCompany.  His wife was a daughter of the Edgars, who flourished\nabout four hundred years in the county of Suffolk, and produced an\neminent and wealthy serjeant-at-law, Sir Gregory Edgar, in the reign\nof Henry the Seventh.  Of the sons of Robert Gibbon, (who died in\n1643,) Matthew did not aspire above the station of a linen-draper in\nLeadenhall-street; but John has given to the public some curious\nmemorials of his existence, his character, and his family.  He was\nborn on Nov. 3d, 1629; his education was liberal, at a grammar-school,\nand afterwards in Jesus College at Cambridge; and he\ncelebrates the retired content which he enjoyed at Allesborough, in\nWorcestershire, in the house of Thomas Lord Coventry, where John\nGibbon was employed as a domestic tutor, the same office which Mr.\nHobbes exercised in the Devonshire family.  But the spirit of my\nkinsman soon immerged into more active life: he visited foreign\ncountries as a soldier and a traveller, acquired the knowledge of\nthe French and Spanish languages, passed some time in the Isle of\nJersey, crossed the Atlantic, and resided upwards of a twelvemonth\n(1659) in the rising colony of Virginia.  In this remote province\nhis taste, or rather passion, for heraldry found a singular\ngratification at a war-dance of the native Indians.  As they moved\nin measured steps, brandishing their tomahawks, his curious eye\ncontemplated their little shields of bark, and their naked bodies,\nwhich were painted with the colours and symbols of his favourite\nscience.  \"At which I exceedingly wondered; and concluded that\nheraldry was ingrafted _naturally_ into the sense of human race.  If\nso, it deserves a greater esteem than now-a-days is put upon it.\"\nHis return to England after the Restoration was soon followed by his\nmarriage his settlement in a house in St. Catherine's Cloister, near\nthe Tower, which devolved to my grandfather and his introduction\ninto the Heralds' College (in 1671) by the style and title of\nBlue-mantle Pursuivant at Arms.  In this office he enjoyed near\nfifty years the rare felicity of uniting, in the same pursuit, his\nduty and inclination: his name is remembered in the College, and\nmany of his letters are still preserved.  Several of the most\nrespectable characters of the age, Sir William Dugdale, Mr. Ashmole,\nDr. John Betts, and Dr. Nehemiah Grew, were his friends; and in the\nsociety of such men, John Gibbon may be recorded without disgrace as\nthe member of an astrological club.  The study of hereditary honours\nis favourable to the Royal prerogative; and my kinsman, like most of\nhis family, was a high Tory both in church and state.  In the latter\nend of the reign of Charles the Second, his pen was exercised in the\ncause of the Duke of York: the Republican faction he most cordially\ndetested; and as each animal is conscious of its proper arms, the\nheralds' revenge was emblazoned on a most diabolical escutcheon.\nBut the triumph of the Whig government checked the preferment of\nBlue-mantle; and he was even suspended from his office, till his\ntongue could learn to pronounce the oath of abjuration.  His life\nwas prolonged to the age of ninety: and, in the expectation of the\ninevitable though uncertain hour, he wishes to preserve the\nblessings of health, competence, and virtue.  In the year 1682 he\npublished in London his Introductio ad Latinam Blasoniam, an\noriginal attempt, which Camden had desiderated, to define, in a\nRoman idiom, the terms and attributes of a Gothic institution.  It\nis not two years since I acquired, in a foreign land, some domestic\nintelligence of my own family; and this intelligence was conveyed to\nSwitzerland from the heart of Germany.  I had formed an acquaintance\nwith Mr. Langer, a lively and ingenious scholar, while he resided at\nLausanne as preceptor to the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick.  On his\nreturn to his proper station of Librarian to the Ducal Library of\nWolfenbuttel, he accidentally found among some literary rubbish a\nsmall old English volume of heraldry, inscribed with the name of\nJohn Gibbon.  From the title only Mr. Langer judged that it might be\nan acceptable present to his friend--and he judged rightly.  His\nmanner is quaint and affected; his order is confused: but he\ndisplays some wit, more reading, and still more enthusiasm: and if\nan enthusiast be often absurd, he is never languid.  An English text\nis perpetually interspersed with Latin sentences in prose and verse;\nbut in his own poetry he claims an exemption from the laws of\nprosody.  Amidst a profusion of genealogical knowledge, my kinsman\ncould not be forgetful of his own name; and to him I am indebted for\nalmost the whole of my information concerning the Gibbon family.\nFrom this small work the author expected immortal fame.\n\nSuch are the hopes of authors! In the failure of those hopes John\nGibbon has not been the first of his profession, and very possibly\nmay not be the last of his name.  His brother Matthew Gibbon, the\ndraper, had one daughter and two sons--my grandfather Edward, who\nwas born in the year 1666, and Thomas, afterwards Dean of Carlisle.\nAccording to the mercantile creed, that the best book is a\nprofitable ledger, the writings of John the herald would be much\nless precious than those of his nephew Edward: but an author\nprofesses at least to write for the public benefit; and the slow\nbalance of trade can be pleasing to those persons only, to whom it\nis advantageous.  The successful industry of my grandfather raised\nhim above the level of his immediate ancestors; he appears to have\nlaunched into various and extensive dealings: even his opinions were\nsubordinate to his interest; and I find him in Flanders clothing\nKing William's troops, while he would have contracted with more\npleasure, though not perhaps at a cheaper rate, for the service of\nKing James.  During his residence abroad, his concerns at home were\nmanaged by his mother Hester, an active and notable woman.  Her\nsecond husband was a widower of the name of Acton: they united the\nchildren of their first nuptials.  After his marriage with the\ndaughter of Richard Acton, goldsmith in Leadenhall-street, he gave\nhis own sister to Sir Whitmore Acton, of Aldenham; and I am thus\nconnected, by a triple alliance, with that ancient and loyal family\nof Shropshire baronets.  It consisted about that time of seven\nbrothers, all of gigantic stature; one of whom, a pigmy of six feet\ntwo inches, confessed himself the last and least of the seven;\nadding, in the true spirit of party, that such men were not born\nsince the Revolution.  Under the Tory administration of the four\nlast years of Queen Anne (1710-1714) Mr. Edward Gibbon was appointed\none of the Commissioners of the Customs; he sat at that Board with\nPrior; but the merchant was better qualified for his station than\nthe poet; since Lord Bolingbroke has been heard to declare, that he\nhad never conversed with a man, who more clearly understood the\ncommerce and finances of England.  In the year 1716 he was elected\none of the Directors of the South Sea Company; and his books\nexhibited the proof that, before his acceptance of this fatal\noffice, he had acquired an independent fortune of sixty thousand\npounds.\n\nBut his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year twenty,\nand the labours of thirty years were blasted in a single day.  Of\nthe use or abuse of the South Sea scheme, of the guilt or innocence\nof my grandfather and his brother Directors, I am neither a\ncompetent nor a disinterested judge.  Yet the equity of modern times\nmust condemn the violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would have\ndisgraced the cause of justice, and would render injustice still\nmore odious.  No sooner had the nation awakened from its golden\ndream, than a popular and even a parliamentary clamour demanded\ntheir victims: but it was acknowledged on all sides that the South\nSea Directors, however guilty, could not be touched by any known\nlaws of the land.  The speech of Lord Molesworth, the author of the\nState of Denmark, may shew the temper, or rather the intemperance,\nof the House of Commons.  \"Extraordinary crimes (exclaimed that\nardent Whig) call aloud for extraordinary remedies.  The Roman\nlawgivers had not foreseen the possible existence of a parricide;\nbut as soon as the first monster appeared, he was sewn in a sack,\nand cast headlong into the river; and I shall be content to inflict\nthe same treatment on the authors of our present ruin.\" His motion\nwas not literally adopted; but a bill of pains and penalties was\nintroduced, a retroactive statute, to punish the offences, which did\nnot exist at the time they were committed.  Such a pernicious\nviolation of liberty and law can be excused only by the most\nimperious necessity; nor could it be defended on this occasion by\nthe plea of impending danger or useful example.  The legislature\nrestrained the persons of the Directors, imposed an exorbitant\nsecurity for their appearance, and marked their characters with a\nprevious note of ignominy: they were compelled to deliver, upon\noath, the strict value of their estates; and were disabled from\nmaking any transfer or alienation of any part of their property.\nAgainst a bill of pains and penalties it is the common right of\nevery subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar: they prayed to\nbe heard; their prayer was refused; and their oppressors, who\nrequired no evidence, would listen to no defence.  It had been at\nfirst proposed that one-eighth of their respective estates should be\nallowed for the future support of the Directors; but it was\nspeciously urged, that in the various shades of opulence and guilt\nsuch an unequal proportion would be too light for many, and for some\nmight possibly be too heavy.  The character and conduct of each man\nwere separately weighed; but, instead of the calm solemnity of a\njudicial inquiry, the fortune and honour of three and thirty\nEnglishmen were made the topic of hasty conversation, the sport of a\nlawless majority; and the basest member of the committee, by a\nmalicious word or, a silent vote, might indulge his general spleen\nor personal animosity.  Injury was aggravated by insult, and insult\nwas embittered by pleasantry.  Allowances of twenty pounds, or one\nshilling, were facetiously moved.  A vague report that a Director\nhad formerly been concerned in another project, by which some\nunknown persons had lost their money, was admitted as a proof of his\nactual guilt.  One man was ruined because he had dropped a foolish\nspeech, that his horses should feed upon gold; another because he\nwas grown so proud, that, one day at the Treasury, he had refused a\ncivil answer to persons much above him.  All were condemned, absent\nand unheard, in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which swept away\nthe greatest part of their substance.  Such bold oppression can\nscarcely be shielded by the omnipotence of parliament; and yet it\nmaybe seriously questioned, whether the judges of the South Sea\nDirectors were the true and legal representatives of their country.\nThe first parliament of George the First had been chosen (1715) for\nthree years: the term had elapsed, their trust was expired; and the\nfour additional years (1718-1722), during which they continued to\nsit, were derived not from the people, but from themselves; from the\nstrong measure of the septennial bill, which can only be paralleled\nby il serar di consiglio of the Venetian history.  Yet candour will\nown that to the same parliament every Englishman is deeply indebted:\nthe septennial act, so vicious in its origin, has been sanctioned by\ntime, experience, and the national consent.  Its first operation\nsecured the House of Hanover on the throne, and its permanent\ninfluence maintains the peace and stability of government.  As often\nas a repeal has been moved in the House of Commons, I have given in\nits defence a clear and conscientious vote.  My grandfather could\nnot expect to be treated with more lenity than his companions.  His\nTory principles and connections rendered him obnoxious to the ruling\npowers: his name is reported in a suspicious secret; and his\nwell-known abilities could not plead the excuse of ignorance or\nerror.  In the first proceedings against the South Sea Directors,\nMr. Gibbon is one of the few who were taken into custody; and, in\nthe final sentence, the measure of his fine proclaims him eminently\nguilty.  The total estimate which he delivered on oath to the House\nof Commons amounted to 106,543 pounds 5 shillings and 6 pence,\nexclusive of antecedent settlements.  Two different allowances of\n15,000 pounds and of 10,000 pounds were moved for Mr. Gibbon; but,\non the question being put, it was carried without a division for the\nsmaller sum. On these ruins, with the skill and credit, of which\nparliament had not been able to despoil him, my grandfather at a\nmature age erected the edifice of a new fortune: the labours of\nsixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have reason to believe that\nthe second structure was not much inferior to the first.  He had\nrealized a very considerable property in Sussex, Hampshire,\nBuckinghamshire, and the New River Company; and had acquired a\nspacious house, with gardens and lands, at Putney, in Surrey, where\nhe resided in decent hospitality.  He died in December 1736, at the\nage of seventy; and by his last will, at the expense of Edward, his\nonly son, (with whose marriage he was not perfectly reconciled,)\nenriched his two daughters, Catherine and Hester.  The former became\nthe wife of Mr. Edward Elliston, an East India captain: their\ndaughter and heiress Catherine was married in the year 1756 to\nEdward Eliot, Esq. (now lord Eliot), of Port Eliot, in the county of\nCornwall; and their three sons are my nearest male relations on the\nfather's side.  A life of devotion and celibacy was the choice of my\naunt, Mrs. Hester Gibbon, who, at the age of eighty-five, still\nresides in a hermitage at Cliffe, in Northamptonshire; having long\nsurvived her spiritual guide and faithful companion Mr. William Law,\nwho, at an advanced age, about the year 1761, died in her house.  In\nour family he had left the reputation of a worthy and pious man, who\nbelieved all that he professed, and practised all that he enjoined.\nThe character of a non-juror, which he maintained to the last, is a\nsufficient evidence of his principles in church and state; and the\nsacrifice of interest to conscience will be always respectable.  His\ntheological writings, which our domestic connection has tempted me\nto peruse, preserve an imperfect sort of life, and I can pronounce\nwith more confidence and knowledge on the merits of the author.  His\nlast compositions are darkly tinctured by the incomprehensible\nvisions of Jacob Behmen; and his discourse on the absolute\nunlawfulness of stage entertainments is sometimes quoted for a\nridiculous intemperance of sentiment and language.--\"The actors and\nspectators must all be damned: the playhouse is the porch of Hell,\nthe place of the Devil's abode, where he holds his filthy court of\nevil spirits: a play is the Devil's triumph, a sacrifice performed\nto his glory, as much as in the heathen temples of Bacchus or Venus,\n&c., &c.\" But these sallies of religious frenzy must not extinguish\nthe praise, which is due to Mr. William Law as a wit and a scholar.\nHis argument on topics of less absurdity is specious and acute, his\nmanner is lively, his style forcible and clear; and, had not his\nvigorous mind been clouded by enthusiasm, he might be ranked with\nthe most agreeable and ingenious writers of the times.  While the\nBangorian controversy was a fashionable theme, he entered the lists\non the subject of Christ's kingdom, and the authority of the\npriesthood: against the plain account of the sacrament of the Lord's\nSupper he resumed the combat with Bishop Hoadley, the object of Whig\nidolatry, and Tory abhorrence; and at every weapon of attack and\ndefence the non-juror, on the ground which is common to both,\napproves himself at least equal to the prelate.  On the appearance\nof the Fable of the Bees, he drew his pen against the licentious\ndoctrine that private vices are public benefits, and morality as\nwell as religion must join in his applause.  Mr. Law's master-work,\nthe Serious Call, is still read as a popular and powerful book of\ndevotion.  His precepts are rigid, but they are founded on the\ngospel; his satire is sharp, but it is drawn from the knowledge of\nhuman life; and many of his portraits are not unworthy of the pen of\nLa Bruyere.  If he finds a spark of piety in his reader's mind, he\nwill soon kindle it to a flame; and a philosopher must allow that he\nexposes, with equal severity and truth, the strange contradiction\nbetween the faith and practice of the Christian world.  Under the\nnames of Flavia and Miranda he has admirably described my two aunts\nthe heathen and the Christian sister.\n\nMy father, Edward Gibbon, was born in October, 1707: at the age of\nthirteen he could scarcely feel that he was disinherited by act of\nparliament; and, as he advanced towards manhood, new prospects of\nfortune opened to his view.  A parent is most attentive to supply in\nhis children the deficiencies, of which he is conscious in himself:\nmy grandfather's knowledge was derived from a strong understanding,\nand the experience of the ways of men; but my father enjoyed the\nbenefits of a liberal education as a scholar and a gentleman.  At\nWestminster School, and afterwards at Emanuel College in Cambridge,\nhe passed through a regular course of academical discipline; and the\ncare of his learning and morals was intrusted to his private tutor,\nthe same Mr. William Law.  But the mind of a saint is above or below\nthe present world; and while the pupil proceeded on his travels, the\ntutor remained at Putney, the much-honoured friend and spiritual\ndirector of the whole family.  My father resided sometime at Paris\nto acquire the fashionable exercises; and as his temper was warm and\nsocial, he indulged in those pleasures, for which the strictness of\nhis former education had given him a keener relish.  He afterwards\nvisited several provinces of France; but his excursions were neither\nlong nor remote; and the slender knowledge, which he had gained of\nthe French language, was gradually obliterated.  His passage through\nBesancon is marked by a singular consequence in the chain of human\nevents.  In a dangerous illness Mr. Gibbon was attended, at his own\nrequest, by one of his kinsmen of the name of Acton, the younger\nbrother of a younger brother, who had applied himself to the study\nof physic.  During the slow recovery of his patient, the physician\nhimself was attacked by the malady of love: he married his mistress,\nrenounced his country and religion, settled at Besancon, and became\nthe father of three sons; the eldest of whom, General Acton, is\nconspicuous in Europe as the principal Minister of the king of the\nTwo Sicilies.  By an uncle whom another stroke of fortune had\ntransplanted to Leghorn, he was educated in the naval service of the\nEmperor; and his valour and conduct in the command of the Tuscan\nfrigates protected the retreat of the Spaniards from Algiers.  On my\nfather's return to England he was chosen, in the general election of\n1734, to serve in parliament for the borough of Petersfield; a\nburgage tenure, of which my grandfather possessed a weighty share,\ntill he alienated (I know not why) such important property.  In the\nopposition to Sir Robert Walpole and the Pelhams, prejudice and\nsociety connected his son with the Tories,--shall I say Jacobites?\nor, as they were pleased to style themselves, the country gentlemen?\nwith them he gave many a vote; with them he drank many a bottle.\nWithout acquiring the fame of an orator or a statesman, he eagerly\njoined in the great opposition, which, after a seven years' chase,\nhunted down Sir Robert Walpole: and in the pursuit of an unpopular\nminister, he gratified a private revenge against the oppressor of\nhis family in the South Sea persecution.\n\nI was born at Putney, in the county of Surrey, April 27th, O. S., in\nthe year one thousand seven hundred and thirty-seven; the first\nchild of the marriage of Edward Gibbon, esq., and of Judith Porten.\n[Note: The union to which I owe my birth was a marriage of\ninclination and esteem.  Mr. James Porten, a merchant of London,\nresided with his family at Putney, in a house adjoining to the\nbridge and churchyard, where I have passed many happy hours of my\nchildhood.  He left one son (the late Sir Stanier Porten) and three\ndaughters; Catherine, who preserved her maiden name, and of whom I\nshall hereafter speak; another daughter married Mr. Darrel of\nRichmond, and left two sons, Edward and Robert: the youngest of the\nthree sisters was Judith, my mother.]  My lot might have been that\nof a slave, a savage, or a peasant; nor can I reflect without\npleasure on the bounty of Nature, which cast my birth in a free and\ncivilized country, in an age of science and philosophy, in a family\nof honourable rank, and decently endowed with the gifts of fortune.\nFrom my birth I have enjoyed the right of primogeniture; but I was\nsucceeded by five brothers and one sister, all of whom were snatched\naway in their infancy.  My five brothers, whose names may be found\nin the parish register of Putney, I shall not pretend to lament: but\nfrom my childhood to the present hour I have deeply and sincerely\nregretted my sister, whose life was somewhat prolonged, and whom I\nremember to have been an amiable infant.  The relation of a brother\nand a sister, especially if they do not marry, appears to me of a\nvery singular nature.  It is a familiar and tender friendship with a\nfemale, much about our own age; an affection perhaps softened by the\nsecret influence of sex, and the sole species of Platonic love that\ncan be indulged with truth, and without danger.\n\nAt the general election of 1741, Mr. Gibbon and Mr. Delme stood an\nexpensive and successful contest at Southampton, against Mr. Dummer\nand Mr. Henly, afterwards Lord Chancellor and Earl of Northington.\nThe Whig candidates had a majority of the resident voters; but the\ncorporation was firm in the Tory interest: a sudden creation of one\nhundred and seventy new freemen turned the scale; and a supply was\nreadily obtained of respectable volunteers, who flocked from all\nparts of England to support the cause of their political friends.\nThe new parliament opened with the victory of an opposition, which\nwas fortified by strong clamour and strange coalitions.  From the\nevent of the first divisions, Sir Robert Walpole perceived that he\ncould no longer lead a majority in the House of Commons, and\nprudently resigned (after a dominion of one-and-twenty years) the\nguidance of the state (1742).  But the fall of an unpopular minister\nwas not succeeded, according to general expectation, by a millennium\nof happiness and virtue: some courtiers lost their places, some\npatriots lost their characters, Lord Orford's offences vanished with\nhis power; and after a short vibration, the Pelham government was\nfixed on the old basis of the Whig aristocracy.  In the year 1745,\nthe throne and the constitution were attacked by a rebellion, which\ndoes not reflect much honour on the national spirit; since the\nEnglish friends of the Pretender wanted courage to join his\nstandard, and his enemies (the bulk of the people) allowed him to\nadvance into the heart of the kingdom.  Without daring, perhaps\nwithout desiring, to aid the rebels, my father invariably adhered to\nthe Tory opposition.  In the most critical season he accepted, for\nthe service of the party, the office of alderman in the city of\nLondon: but the duties were so repugnant to his inclination and\nhabits, that he resigned his gown at the end of a few months.  The\nsecond parliament in which he sat was prematurely dissolved (1747):\nand as he was unable or unwilling to maintain a second contest for\nSouthampton, the life of the senator expired in that dissolution.\n\nThe death of a new-born child before that of its parents may seem an\nunnatural, but it is strictly a probable, event: since of any given\nnumber the greater part are extinguished before their ninth year,\nbefore they possess the faculties of the mind or body.  Without\naccusing the profuse waste or imperfect workmanship of Nature, I\nshall only observe, that this unfavourable chance was multiplied\nagainst my infant existence.  So feeble was my constitution, so\nprecarious my life, that, in the baptism of each of my brothers, my\nfather's prudence successively repeated my Christian name of Edward,\nthat, in case of the departure of the eldest son, this patronymic\nappellation might be still perpetuated in the family.\n\n          --Uno avulso non deficit alter.\n\nTo preserve and to rear so frail a being, the most tender assiduity\nwas scarcely sufficient, and my mother's attention was somewhat\ndiverted by an exclusive passion for her husband, and by the\ndissipation of the world, in which his taste and authority obliged\nher to mingle.  But the maternal office was supplied by my aunt,\nMrs. Catherine Porten; at whose name I feel a tear of gratitude\ntrickling down my cheek.  A life of celibacy transferred her vacant\naffection to her sister's first child; my weakness excited her pity;\nher attachment was fortified by labour and success: and if there be\nany, as I trust there are some, who rejoice that I live, to that\ndear and excellent woman they must hold themselves indebted.  Many\nanxious and solitary days did she consume in the patient trial of\nevery mode of relief and amusement.  Many wakeful nights did she sit\nby my bedside in trembling expectation that each hour would be my\nlast.  Of the various and frequent disorders of my childhood my own\nrecollection is dark.  Suffice it to say, that while every\npractitioner, from Sloane and Ward to the Chevalier Taylor, was\nsuccessively summoned to torture or relieve me, the care of my mind\nwas too frequently neglected for that of my health: compassion\nalways suggested an excuse for the indulgence of the master, or the\nidleness of the pupil; and the chain of my education was broken, as\noften as I was recalled from the school of learning to the bed of\nsickness.\n\nAs soon as the use of speech had prepared my infant reason for the\nadmission of knowledge, I was taught the arts of reading, writing,\nand arithmetic.  So remote is the date, so vague is the memory of\ntheir origin in myself, that, were not the error corrected by\nanalogy, I should be tempted to conceive them as innate.  In my\nchildhood I was praised for the readiness with which I could\nmultiply and divide, by memory alone, two sums of several figures;\nsuch praise encouraged my growing talent; and had I persevered in\nthis line of application, I might have acquired some fame in\nmathematical studies.\n\nAfter this previous institution at home, or at a day school at\nPutney, I was delivered at the age of seven into the hands of Mr.\nJohn Kirkby, who exercised about eighteen months the office of my\ndomestic tutor.  His learning and virtue introduced him to my\nfather; and at Putney he might have found at least a temporary\nshelter, had not an act of indiscretion driven him into the world.\nOne day reading prayers in the parish church, he most unluckily\nforgot the name of King George: his patron, a loyal subject,\ndismissed him with some reluctance, and a decent reward; and how the\npoor man ended his days I have never been able to learn.  Mr. John\nKirkby is the author of two small volumes; the Life of Automathes\n(London, 1745), and an English and Latin Grammar (London, 1746);\nwhich, as a testimony of gratitude, he dedicated (Nov. 5th, 1745) to\nmy father.  The books are before me: from them the pupil may judge\nthe preceptor; and, upon the whole, his judgment will not be\nunfavourable.  The grammar is executed with accuracy and skill, and\nI know not whether any better existed at the time in our language:\nbut the Life of Automathes aspires to the honours of a philosophical\nfiction.  It is the story of a youth, the son of a ship-wrecked\nexile, who lives alone on a desert island from infancy to the age of\nmanhood.  A hind is his nurse; he inherits a cottage, with many\nuseful and curious instruments; some ideas remain of the education\nof his two first years; some arts are borrowed from the beavers of a\nneighbouring lake; some truths are revealed in supernatural visions.\nWith these helps, and his own industry, Automathes becomes a\nself-taught though speechless philosopher, who had investigated with\nsuccess his own mind, the natural world, the abstract sciences, and\nthe great principles of morality and religion.  The author is not\nentitled to the merit of invention, since he has blended the English\nstory of Robinson Crusoe with the Arabian romance of Hai Ebn\nYokhdan, which he might have read in the Latin version of Pocock.\nIn the Automathes I cannot praise either the depth of thought or\nelegance of style; but the book is not devoid of entertainment or\ninstruction; and among several interesting passages, I would select\nthe discovery of fire, which produces by accidental mischief the\ndiscovery of conscience.  A man who had thought so much on the\nsubjects of language and education was surely no ordinary preceptor:\nmy childish years, and his hasty departure, prevented me from\nenjoying the full benefit of his lessons; but they enlarged my\nknowledge of arithmetic, and left me a clear impression of the\nEnglish and Latin rudiments.\n\nIn my ninth year (Jan., 1746), in a lucid interval of comparative\nhealth, my father adopted the convenient and customary mode of\nEnglish education; and I was sent to Kingston-upon-Thames, to a\nschool of about seventy boys, which was kept by Dr. Wooddeson and\nhis assistants.  Every time I have since passed over Putney Common,\nI have always noticed the spot where my mother, as we drove along in\nthe coach, admonished me that I was now going into the world, and\nmust learn to think and act for myself.  The expression may appear\nludicrous; yet there is not, in the course of life, a more\nremarkable change than the removal of a child from the luxury and\nfreedom of a wealthy house, to the frugal diet and strict\nsubordination of a school; from the tenderness of parents, and the\nobsequiousness of servants, to the rude familiarity of his equals,\nthe insolent tyranny of his seniors, and the rod, perhaps, of a\ncruel and capricious pedagogue.  Such hardships may steel the mind\nand body against the injuries of fortune; but my timid reserve was\nastonished by the crowd and tumult of the school; the want of\nstrength and activity disqualified me for the sports of the\nplay-field; nor have I forgotten how often in the year forty-six I\nwas reviled and buffeted for the sins of my Tory ancestors.  By the\ncommon methods of discipline, at the expence of many tears and some\nblood, I purchased the knowledge of the Latin syntax: and not long\nsince I was possessed of the dirty volumes of Phaedrus and Cornelius\nNepos, which I painfully construed and darkly understood.  The\nchoice of these authors is not injudicious.  The lives of Cornelius\nNepos, the friend of Atticus and Cicero, are composed in the style\nof the purest age: his simplicity is elegant, his brevity copious;\nhe exhibits a series of men and manners; and with such\nillustrations, as every pedant is not indeed qualified to give, this\nclassic biographer may initiate a young student in the history of\nGreece and Rome.  The use of fables or apologues has been approved\nin every age from ancient India to modern Europe.  They convey in\nfamiliar images the truths of morality and prudence; and the most\nchildish understanding (I advert to the scruples of Rousseau) will\nnot suppose either that beasts do speak, or that men may lie.  A\nfable represents the genuine characters of animals; and a skilful\nmaster might extract from Pliny and Buffon some pleasing lessons of\nnatural history, a science well adapted to the taste and capacity of\nchildren.  The Latinity of Phaedrus is not exempt from an alloy of\nthe silver age; but his manner is concise, terse, and sententious;\nthe Thracian slave discreetly breathes the spirit of a freeman; and\nwhen the text is found, the style is perspicuous.  But his fables,\nafter a long oblivion, were first published by Peter Pithou, from a\ncorrupt manuscript.  The labours of fifty editors confess the\ndefects of the copy, as well as the value of the original; and the\nschool-boy may have been whipped for misapprehending a passage,\nwhich Bentley could not restore, and which Burman could not explain.\n\nMy studies were too frequently interrupted by sickness; and after a\nreal or nominal residence at Kingston School of near two years, I\nwas finally recalled (Dec., 1747) by my mother's death, in her\nthirty-eighth year.  I was too young to feel the importance of my\nloss; and the image of her person and conversation is faintly\nimprinted in my memory.  The affectionate heart of my aunt,\nCatherine Porten, bewailed a sister and a friend; but my poor father\nwas inconsolable, and the transport of grief seemed to threaten his\nlife or his reason.  I can never forget the scene of our first\ninterview, some weeks after the fatal event; the awful silence, the\nroom hung with black, the mid-day tapers, his sighs and tears; his\npraises of my mother, a saint in heaven; his solemn adjuration that\nI would cherish her memory and imitate her virtues; and the fervor\nwith which he kissed and blessed me as the sole surviving pledge of\ntheir loves.  The storm of passion insensibly subsided into calmer\nmelancholy.  At a convivial meeting of his friends, Mr. Gibbon might\naffect or enjoy a gleam of cheerfulness; but his plan of happiness\nwas for ever destroyed: and after the loss of his companion he was\nleft alone in a world, of which the business and pleasures were to\nhim irksome or insipid.  After some unsuccessful trials he renounced\nthe tumult of London and the hospitality of Putney, and buried\nhimself in the rural or rather rustic solitude of Beriton; from\nwhich, during several years, he seldom emerged.\n\nAs far back as I can remember, the house, near Putney-bridge and\nchurchyard, of my maternal grandfather appears in the light of my\nproper and native home.  It was there that I was allowed to spend\nthe greatest part of my time, in sickness or in health, during my\nschool vacations and my parents' residence in London, and finally\nafter my mother's death.  Three months after that event, in the\nspring of 1748, the commercial ruin of her father, Mr. James Porten,\nwas accomplished and declared.  He suddenly absconded: but as his\neffects were not sold, nor the house evacuated, till the Christmas\nfollowing, I enjoyed during the whole year the society of my aunt,\nwithout much consciousness of her impending fate.  I feel a\nmelancholy pleasure in repeating my obligations to that excellent\nwoman, Mrs. Catherine Porten, the true mother of my mind as well as\nof my health.  Her natural good sense was improved by the perusal of\nthe best books in the English language; and if her reason was\nsometimes clouded by prejudice, her sentiments were never disguised\nby hypocrisy or affectation.  Her indulgent tenderness, the\nfrankness of her temper, and my innate rising curiosity, soon\nremoved all distance between us: like friends of an equal age, we\nfreely conversed on every topic, familiar or abstruse; and it was\nher delight and reward to observe the first shoots of my young\nideas.  Pain and languor were often soothed by the voice of\ninstruction and amusement; and to her kind lessons I ascribe my\nearly and invincible love of reading, which I would not exchange for\nthe treasures of India.  I should perhaps be astonished, were it\npossible to ascertain the date, at which a favourite tale was\nengraved, by frequent repetition, in my memory: the Cavern of the\nWinds; the Palace of Felicity; and the fatal moment, at the end of\nthree months or centuries, when Prince Adolphus is overtaken by\nTime, who had worn out so many pair of wings in the pursuit.  Before\nI left Kingston school I was well acquainted with Pope's Homer and\nthe Arabian Nights Entertainments, two books which will always\nplease by the moving picture of human manners and specious miracles:\nnor was I then capable of discerning that Pope's translation is a\nportrait endowed with every merit, excepting that of likeness to the\noriginal.  The verses of Pope accustomed my ear to the sound of\npoetic harmony: in the death of Hector, and the shipwreck of\nUlysses, I tasted the new emotions of terror and pity; and seriously\ndisputed with my aunt on the vices and virtues of the heroes of the\nTrojan war.  From Pope's Homer to Dryden's Virgil was an easy\ntransition; but I know not how, from some fault in the author, the\ntranslator, or the reader, the pious Aeneas did not so forcibly\nseize on my imagination; and I derived more pleasure from Ovid's\nMetamorphoses, especially in the fall of Phaeton, and the speeches\nof Ajax and Ulysses.  My grand-father's flight unlocked the door of\na tolerable library; and I turned over many English pages of poetry\nand romance, of history and travels.  Where a title attracted my\neye, without fear or awe I snatched the volume from the shelf; and\nMrs. Porten, who indulged herself in moral and religious\nspeculations, was more prone to encourage than to check a curiosity\nabove the strength of a boy.  This year (1748), the twelfth of my\nage, I shall note as the most propitious to the growth of my\nintellectual stature.\n\nThe relics of my grandfather's fortune afforded a bare annuity for\nhis own maintenance; and his daughter, my worthy aunt, who had\nalready passed her fortieth year, was left destitute.  Her noble\nspirit scorned a life of obligation and dependence; and after\nrevolving several schemes, she preferred the humble industry of\nkeeping a boarding-house for Westminster-school, where she\nlaboriously earned a competence for her old age.  This singular\nopportunity of blending the advantages of private and public\neducation decided my father.  After the Christmas holidays in\nJanuary, 1749, I accompanied Mrs. Porten to her new house in\nCollege-street; and was immediately entered in the school of which\nDr. John Nicoll was at that time head-master.  At first I was alone:\nbut my aunt's resolution was praised; her character was esteemed;\nher friends were numerous and active: in the course of some years\nshe became the mother of forty or fifty boys, for the most part of\nfamily and fortune; and as her primitive habitation was too narrow,\nshe built and occupied a spacious mansion in Dean's Yard.  I shall\nalways be ready to join in the common opinion that our public\nschools, which have produced so many eminent characters, are the\nbest adapted to the genius and constitution of the English people.\nA boy of spirit may acquire a previous and practical experience of\nthe world; and his playfellows may be the future friends of his\nheart or his interest.  In a free intercourse with his equals, the\nhabits of truth, fortitude, and prudence will insensibly be matured.\nBirth and riches are measured by the standard of personal merit; and\nthe mimic scene of a rebellion has displayed, in their true colours,\nthe ministers and patriots of the rising generation.  Our seminaries\nof learning do not exactly correspond with the precept of a Spartan\nking, \"that the child should be instructed in the arts, which will\nbe useful to the man;\" since a finished scholar may emerge from the\nhead of Westminster or Eton, in total ignorance of the business and\nconversation of English gentlemen in the latter end of the\neighteenth century.  But these schools may assume the merit of\nteaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek\nlanguages: they deposit in the hands of a disciple the keys of two\nvaluable chests; nor can he complain, if they are afterwards lost or\nneglected by his own fault.  The necessity of leading in equal ranks\nso many unequal powers of capacity and application, will prolong to\neight or ten years the juvenile studies, which might be despatched\nin half that time by the skilful master of a single pupil.  Yet even\nthe repetition of exercise and discipline contributes to fix in a\nvacant mind the verbal science of grammar and prosody: and the\nprivate or voluntary student, who possesses the sense and spirit of\nthe classics, may offend, by a false quantity, the scrupulous ear of\na well-flogged critic.  For myself, I must be content with a very\nsmall share of the civil and literary fruits of a public school.  In\nthe space of two years (1749, 1750), interrupted by danger and\ndebility, I painfully climbed into the third form; and my riper age\nwas left to acquire the beauties of the Latin, and the rudiments of\nthe Greek tongue.  Instead of audaciously mingling in the sports,\nthe quarrels, and the connections of our little world, I was still\ncherished at home under the maternal wing of my aunt; and my removal\nfrom Westminster long preceded the approach of manhood.\n\nThe violence and variety of my complaint, which had excused my\nfrequent absence from Westminster School, at length engaged Mrs.\nPorten, with the advice of physicians, to conduct me to Bath: at the\nend of the Michaelmas vacation (1750) she quitted me with\nreluctance, and I remained several months under the care of a trusty\nmaid-servant.  A strange nervous affection, which alternately\ncontracted my legs, and produced, without any visible symptoms, the\nmost excruciating pain, was ineffectually opposed by the various\nmethods of bathing and pumping.  From Bath I was transported to\nWinchester, to the house of a physician; and after the failure of\nhis medical skill, we had again recourse to the virtues of the Bath\nwaters.  During the intervals of these fits, I moved with my father\nto Beriton and Putney; and a short unsuccessful trial was attempted\nto renew my attendance at Westminster School.  But my infirmities\ncould not be reconciled with the hours and discipline of a public\nseminary; and instead of a domestic tutor, who might have watched\nthe favourable moments, and gently advanced the progress of my\nlearning, my father was too easily content with such occasional\nteachers as the different places of my residence could supply.  I\nwas never forced, and seldom was I persuaded, to admit these\nlessons: yet I read with a clergyman at Bath some odes of Horace,\nand several episodes of Virgil, which gave me an imperfect and\ntransient enjoyment of the Latin poets.  It might now be apprehended\nthat I should continue for life an illiterate cripple; but, as I\napproached my sixteenth year, Nature displayed in my favour her\nmysterious energies: my constitution was fortified and fixed; and my\ndisorders, instead of growing with my growth and strengthening with\nmy strength, most wonderfully vanished.  I have never possessed or\nabused the insolence of health: but since that time few persons have\nbeen more exempt from real or imaginary ills; and, till I am\nadmonished by the gout, the reader will no more be troubled with the\nhistory of my bodily complaints.  My unexpected recovery again\nencouraged the hope of my education; and I was placed at Esher, in\nSurrey, in the house of the Reverend Mr. Philip Francis, in a\npleasant spot, which promised to unite the various benefits of air,\nexercise, and study (Jan.,1752).  The translator of Horace might\nhave taught me to relish the Latin poets, had not my friends\ndiscovered in a few weeks, that he preferred the pleasures of\nLondon, to the instruction of his pupils.  My father's perplexity at\nthis time, rather than his prudence, was urged to embrace a singular\nand desperate measure.  Without preparation or delay he carried me\nto Oxford; and I was matriculated in the university as a gentleman\ncommoner of Magdalen college, before I had accomplished the\nfifteenth year of my age (April 3, 1752).\n\nThe curiosity, which had been implanted in my infant mind, was still\nalive and active; but my reason was not sufficiently informed to\nunderstand the value, or to lament the loss, of three precious years\nfrom my entrance at Westminster to my admission at Oxford.  Instead\nof repining at my long and frequent confinement to the chamber or\nthe couch, I secretly rejoiced in those infirmities, which delivered\nme from the exercises of the school, and the society of my equals.\nAs often as I was tolerably exempt from danger and pain, reading,\nfree desultory reading, was the employment and comfort of my\nsolitary hours.  At Westminster, my aunt sought only to amuse and\nindulge me; in my stations at Bath and Winchester, at Beriton and\nPutney, a false compassion respected my sufferings; and I was\nallowed, without controul or advice, to gratify the wanderings of an\nunripe taste.  My indiscriminate appetite subsided by degrees in the\nhistoric line: and since philosophy has exploded all innate ideas\nand natural propensities, I must ascribe this choice to the\nassiduous perusal of the Universal History, as the octavo volumes\nsuccessively appeared.  This unequal work, and a treatise of Hearne,\nthe Ductor historicus, referred and introduced me to the Greek and\nRoman historians, to as many at least as were accessible to an\nEnglish reader.  All that I could find were greedily devoured, from\nLittlebury's lame Herodotus, and Spelman's valuable Xenophon, to the\npompous folios of Gordon's Tacitus, and a ragged Procopius of the\nbeginning of the last century.  The cheap acquisition of so much\nknowledge confirmed my dislike to the study of languages; and I\nargued with Mrs. Porten, that, were I master of Greek and Latin, I\nmust interpret to myself in English the thoughts of the original,\nand that such extemporary versions must be inferior to the elaborate\ntranslations of professed scholars; a silly sophism, which could not\neasily be confuted by a person ignorant of any other language than\nher own.  From the ancient I leaped to the modern world: many crude\nlumps of Speed, Rapin, Mezeray, Davila, Machiavel, Father Paul,\nBower, &c., I devoured like so many novels; and I swallowed with the\nsame voracious appetite the descriptions of India and China, of\nMexico and Peru.\n\nMy first introduction to the historic scenes, which have since\nengaged so many years of my life, must be ascribed to an accident.\nIn the summer of 1751, I accompanied my father on a visit to Mr.\nHoare's, in Wiltshire; but I was less delighted with the beauties of\nStourhead, than with discovering in the library a common book, the\nContinuation of Echard's Roman History, which is indeed executed\nwith more skill and taste than the previous work.  To me the reigns\nof the successors of Constantine were absolutely new; and I was\nimmersed in the passage of the Goths over the Danube, when the\nsummons of the dinner-bell reluctantly dragged me from my\nintellectual feast.  This transient glance served rather to irritate\nthan to appease my curiosity; and as soon as I returned to Bath I\nprocured the second and third volumes of Howel's History of the\nWorld, which exhibit the Byzantine period on a larger scale.\nMahomet and his Saracens soon fixed my attention; and some instinct\nof criticism directed me to the genuine sources.  Simon Ockley, an\noriginal in every sense, first opened my eyes; and I was led from\none book to another, till I had ranged round the circle of Oriental\nhistory.  Before I was sixteen, I had exhausted all that could be\nlearned in English of the Arabs and Persians, the Tartars and Turks;\nand the same ardour urged me to guess at the French of D'Herbelot,\nand to construe the barbarous Latin of Pocock's Abulfaragius.  Such\nvague and multifarious reading could not teach me to think, to\nwrite, or to act; and the only principle that darted a ray of light\ninto the indigested chaos, was an early and rational application to\nthe order of time and place.  The maps of Cellarius and Wells\nimprinted in my mind the picture of ancient geography: from\nStranchius I imbibed the elements of chronology: the Tables of\nHelvicus and Anderson, the Annals of Usher and Prideaux,\ndistinguished the connection of events, and engraved the multitude\nof names and dates in a clear and indelible series.  But in the\ndiscussion of the first ages I overleaped the bounds of modesty and\nuse.  In my childish balance I presumed to weigh the systems of\nScaliger and Petavius, of Marsham and Newton, which I could seldom\nstudy in the originals; and my sleep has been disturbed by the\ndifficulty of reconciling the Septuagint with the Hebrew\ncomputation.  I arrived at Oxford with a stock of erudition, that\nmight have puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance, of which a\nschool-boy would have been ashamed.\n\nAt the conclusion of this first period of my life, I am tempted to\nenter a protest against the trite and lavish praise of the happiness\nof our boyish years, which is echoed with so much affectation in the\nworld.  That happiness I have never known, that time I have never\nregretted; and were my poor aunt still alive, she would bear\ntestimony to the early and constant uniformity of my sentiments.  It\nwill indeed be replied, that I am not a competent judge; that\npleasure is incompatible with pain; that joy is excluded from\nsickness; and that the felicity of a schoolboy consists in the\nperpetual motion of thoughtless and playful agility, in which I was\nnever qualified to excel.  My name, it is most true, could never be\nenrolled among the sprightly race, the idle progeny of Eton or\nWestminster,\n\n          \"Who foremost may delight to cleave,\n          With pliant arm, the glassy wave,\n          Or urge the flying ball.\"\n\nThe poet may gaily describe the short hours of recreation; but he\nforgets the daily tedious labours of the school, which is approached\neach morning with anxious and reluctant steps.\n\nA traveller, who visits Oxford or Cambridge, is surprised and\nedified by the apparent order and tranquillity that prevail in the\nseats of the English muses.  In the most celebrated universities of\nHolland, Germany, and Italy, the students, who swarm from different\ncountries, are loosely dispersed in private lodgings at the houses\nof the burghers: they dress according to their fancy and fortune;\nand in the intemperate quarrels of youth and wine, their swords,\nthough less frequently than of old, are sometimes stained with each\nother's blood.  The use of arms is banished from our English\nuniversities; the uniform habit of the academics, the square cap,\nand black gown, is adapted to the civil and even clerical\nprofession; and from the doctor in divinity to the under-graduate,\nthe degrees of learning and age are externally distinguished.\nInstead of being scattered in a town, the students of Oxford and\nCambridge are united in colleges; their maintenance is provided at\ntheir own expense, or that of the founders; and the stated hours of\nthe hall and chapel represent the discipline of a regular, and, as\nit were, a religious community.  The eyes of the traveller are\nattracted by the size or beauty of the public edifices; and the\nprincipal colleges appear to be so many palaces, which a liberal\nnation has erected and endowed for the habitation of science.  My\nown introduction to the university of Oxford forms a new aera in my\nlife; and at the distance of forty years I still remember my first\nemotions of surprise and satisfaction.  In my fifteenth year I felt\nmyself suddenly raised from a boy to a man: the persons, whom I\nrespected as my superiors in age and academical rank, entertained me\nwith every mark of attention and civility; and my vanity was\nflattered by the velvet cap and silk gown, which distinguish a\ngentleman commoner from a plebeian student.  A decent allowance,\nmore money than a schoolboy had ever seen, was at my own disposal;\nand I might command, among the tradesmen of Oxford, an indefinite\nand dangerous latitude of credit.  A key was delivered into my\nhands, which gave me the free use of a numerous and learned library;\nmy apartment consisted of three elegant and well-furnished rooms in\nthe new building, a stately pile, of Magdalen College; and the\nadjacent walks, had they been frequented by Plato's disciples, might\nhave been compared to the Attic shade on the banks of the Ilissus.\nSuch was the fair prospect of my entrance (April 3, 1752) into the\nuniversity of Oxford.\n\nA venerable prelate, whose taste and erudition must reflect honour\non the society in which they were formed, has drawn a very\ninteresting picture of his academical life.--\"I was educated (says\nBishop Lowth) in the UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD.  I enjoyed all the\nadvantages, both public and private, which that famous seat of\nlearning so largely affords.  I spent many years in that illustrious\nsociety, in a well-regulated course of useful discipline and\nstudies, and in the agreeable and improving commerce of gentlemen\nand of scholars; in a society where emulation without envy, ambition\nwithout jealousy, contention without animosity, incited industry,\nand awakened genius; where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a\ngenuine freedom of thought, were raised, encouraged, and pushed\nforward by example, by commendation, and by authority.  I breathed\nthe same atmosphere that the HOOKERS, the CHILLINGWORTHS, and the\nLOCKES had breathed before; whose benevolence and humanity were as\nextensive as their vast genius and comprehensive knowledge; who\nalways treated their adversaries with civility and respect; who made\ncandour, moderation, and liberal judgment as much the rule and law\nas the subject of their discourse.  And do you reproach me with my\neducation in this place, and with my relation to this most\nrespectable body, which I shall always esteem my greatest advantage\nand my highest honour?\" I transcribe with pleasure this eloquent\npassage, without examining what benefits or what rewards were\nderived by Hooker, or Chillingworth, or Locke, from their academical\ninstitution; without inquiring, whether in this angry controversy\nthe spirit of Lowth himself is purified from the intolerant zeal,\nwhich Warburton had ascribed to the genius of the place.  It may\nindeed be observed, that the atmosphere of Oxford did not agree with\nMr. Locke's constitution; and that the philosopher justly despised\nthe academical bigots, who expelled his person and condemned his\nprinciples.  The expression of gratitude is a virtue and a pleasure:\na liberal mind will delight to cherish and celebrate the memory of\nits parents; and the teachers of science are the parents of the\nmind.  I applaud the filial piety, which it is impossible for me to\nimitate; since I must not confess an imaginary debt, to assume the\nmerit of a just or generous retribution.  To the university of\nOxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully\nrenounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother.\nI spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved the\nfourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life: the\nreader will pronounce between the school and the scholar; but I\ncannot affect to believe that Nature had disqualified me for all\nliterary pursuits.  The specious and ready excuse of my tender age,\nimperfect preparation, and hasty departure, may doubtless be\nalleged; nor do I wish to defraud such excuses of their proper\nweight.  Yet in my sixteenth year I was not devoid of capacity or\napplication; even my childish reading had displayed an early though\nblind propensity for books; and the shallow flood might have been\ntaught to flow in a deep channel and a clear stream.  In the\ndiscipline of a well-constituted academy, under the guidance of\nskilful and vigilant professors, I should gradually have risen from\ntranslations to originals, from the Latin to the Greek classics,\nfrom dead languages to living science: my hours would have been\noccupied by useful and agreeable studies, the wanderings of fancy\nwould have been restrained, and I should have escaped the\ntemptations of idleness, which finally precipitated my departure\nfrom Oxford.\n\nPerhaps in a separate annotation I may coolly examine the fabulous\nand real antiquities of our sister universities, a question which\nhas kindled such fierce and foolish disputes among their fanatic\nsons.  In the meanwhile it will be acknowledged that these venerable\nbodies are sufficiently old to partake of all the prejudices and\ninfirmities of age.  The schools of Oxford and Cambridge were\nfounded in a dark age of false and barbarous science; and they are\nstill tainted with the vices of their origin.  Their primitive\ndiscipline was adapted to the education of priests and monks; and\nthe government still remains in the hands of the clergy, an order of\nmen whose manners are remote from the present world, and whose eyes\nare dazzled by the light of philosophy.  The legal incorporation of\nthese societies by the charters of popes and kings had given them a\nmonopoly of the public instruction; and the spirit of monopolists is\nnarrow, lazy, and oppressive; their work is more costly and less\nproductive than that of independent artists; and the new\nimprovements so eagerly grasped by the competition of freedom, are\nadmitted with slow and sullen reluctance in those proud\ncorporations, above the fear of a rival, and below the confession of\nan error.  We may scarcely hope that any reformation will be a\nvoluntary act; and so deeply are they rooted in law and prejudice,\nthat even the omnipotence of parliament would shrink from an inquiry\ninto the state and abuses of the two universities.\n\nThe use of academical degrees, as old as the thirteenth century, is\nvisibly borrowed from the mechanic corporations; in which an\napprentice, after serving his time, obtains a testimonial of his\nskill, and a licence to practise his trade and mystery.  It is not\nmy design to depreciate those honours, which could never gratify or\ndisappoint my ambition; and I should applaud the institution, if the\ndegrees of bachelor or licentiate were bestowed as the reward of\nmanly and successful study: if the name and rank of doctor or master\nwere strictly reserved for the professors of science, who have\napproved their title to the public esteem.\n\nIn all the universities of Europe, excepting our own, the languages\nand sciences are distributed among a numerous list of effective\nprofessors: the students, according to their taste, their calling,\nand their diligence, apply themselves to the proper masters; and in\nthe annual repetition of public and private lectures, these masters\nare assiduously employed.  Our curiosity may inquire what number of\nprofessors has been instituted at Oxford? (for I shall now confine\nmyself to my own university;) by whom are they appointed, and what\nmay be the probable chances of merit or incapacity; how many are\nstationed to the three faculties, and how many are left for the\nliberal arts? what is the form, and what the substance, of their\nlessons? But all these questions are silenced by one short and\nsingular answer, \"That in the University of Oxford, the greater part\nof the public professors have for these many years given up\naltogether even the pretence of teaching.\" Incredible as the fact\nmay appear, I must rest my belief on the positive and impartial\nevidence of a master of moral and political wisdom, who had himself\nresided at Oxford.  Dr. Adam Smith assigns as the cause of their\nindolence, that, instead of being paid by voluntary contributions,\nwhich would urge them to increase the number, and to deserve the\ngratitude of their pupils, the Oxford professors are secure in the\nenjoyment of a fixed stipend, without the necessity of labour, or\nthe apprehension of controul.  It has indeed been observed, nor is\nthe observation absurd, that excepting in experimental sciences,\nwhich demand a costly apparatus and a dexterous hand, the many\nvaluable treatises, that have been published on every subject of\nlearning, may now supersede the ancient mode of oral instruction.\nWere this principle true in its utmost latitude, I should only infer\nthat the offices and salaries, which are become useless, ought\nwithout delay to be abolished.  But there still remains a material\ndifference between a book and a professor; the hour of the lecture\nenforces attendance; attention is fixed by the presence, the voice,\nand the occasional questions of the teacher; the most idle will\ncarry something away; and the more diligent will compare the\ninstructions, which they have heard in the school, with the volumes,\nwhich they peruse in their chamber.  The advice of a skilful\nprofessor will adapt a course of reading to every mind and every\nsituation; his authority will discover, admonish, and at last\nchastise the negligence of his disciples; and his vigilant inquiries\nwill ascertain the steps of their literary progress.  Whatever\nscience he professes he may illustrate in a series of discourses,\ncomposed in the leisure of his closet, pronounced on public\noccasions, and finally delivered to the press.  I observe with\npleasure, that in the university of Oxford Dr. Lowth, with equal\neloquence and erudition, has executed this task in his incomparable\nPraelections on the Poetry of the Hebrews.\n\nThe college of St. Mary Magdalen was founded in the fifteenth\ncentury by Wainfleet, bishop of Winchester; and now consists of a\npresident, forty fellows, and a number of inferior students.  It is\nesteemed one of the largest and most wealthy of our academical\ncorporations, which may be compared to the Benedictine abbeys of\nCatholic countries; and I have loosely heard that the estates\nbelonging to Magdalen College, which are leased by those indulgent\nlandlords at small quit-rents and occasional fines, might be raised,\nin the hands of private avarice, to an annual revenue of nearly\nthirty thousand pounds.  Our colleges are supposed to be schools of\nscience, as well as of education; nor is it unreasonable to expect\nthat a body of literary men, devoted to a life of celibacy, exempt\nfrom the care of their own subsistence, and amply provided with\nbooks, should devote their leisure to the prosecution of study, and\nthat some effects of their studies should be manifested to the\nworld.  The shelves of their library groan under the weight of the\nBenedictine folios, of the editions of the fathers, and the\ncollections of the middle ages, which have issued from the single\nabbey of St. Germain de Prez at Paris.  A composition of genius must\nbe the offspring of one mind; but such works of industry, as may be\ndivided among many hands, and must be continued during many years,\nare the peculiar province of a laborious community.  If I inquire\ninto the manufactures of the monks of Magdalen, if I extend the\ninquiry to the other colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, a silent\nblush, or a scornful frown, will be the only reply.  The fellows or\nmonks of my time were decent easy men, who supinely enjoyed the\ngifts of the founder; their days were filled by a series of uniform\nemployments; the chapel and the hall, the coffee-house and the\ncommon room, till they retired, weary and well satisfied, to a long\nslumber.  From the toil of reading, or thinking, or writing, they\nhad absolved their conscience; and the first shoots of learning and\ningenuity withered on the ground, without yielding any fruits to the\nowners or the public.  As a gentleman commoner, I was admitted to\nthe society of the fellows, and fondly expected that some questions\nof literature would be the amusing and instructive topics of their\ndiscourse.  Their conversation stagnated in a round of college\nbusiness, Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal:\ntheir dull and deep potations excused the brisk intemperance of\nyouth; and their constitutional toasts were not expressive of the\nmost lively loyalty for the house of Hanover.  A general election\nwas now approaching: the great Oxfordshire contest already blazed\nwith all the malevolence of party-zeal.  Magdalen College was\ndevoutly attached to the old interest! and the names of Wenman and\nDashwood were more frequently pronounced, than those of Cicero and\nChrysostom.  The example of the senior fellows could not inspire the\nunder-graduates with a liberal spirit or studious emulation; and I\ncannot describe, as I never knew, the discipline of college.  Some\nduties may possibly have been imposed on the poor scholars, whose\nambition aspired to the peaceful honours of a fellowship (ascribi\nquietis ordinibus-- --Deorum); but no independent members were\nadmitted below the rank of a gentleman commoner, and our velvet cap\nwas the cap of liberty.  A tradition prevailed that some of our\npredecessors had spoken Latin declamations in the hall; but of this\nancient custom no vestige remained: the obvious methods of public\nexercises and examinations were totally unknown; and I have never\nheard that either the president or the society interfered in the\nprivate economy of the tutors and their pupils.\n\nThe silence of the Oxford professors, which deprives the youth of\npublic instruction, is imperfectly supplied by the tutors, as they\nare styled, of the several colleges.  Instead of confining\nthemselves to a single science, which had satisfied the ambition of\nBurman or Bernoulli, they teach, or promise to teach, either history\nor mathematics, or ancient literature, or moral philosophy; and as\nit is possible that they may be defective in all, it is highly\nprobable that of some they will be ignorant.  They are paid, indeed,\nby voluntary contributions; but their appointment depends on the\nhead of the house: their diligence is voluntary, and will\nconsequently be languid, while the pupils themselves, or their\nparents, are not indulged in the liberty of choice or change.  The\nfirst tutor into whose hands I was resigned appears to have been one\nof the best of the tribe: Dr. Waldegrave was a learned and pious\nman, of a mild disposition, strict morals, and abstemious life, who\nseldom mingled in the politics or the jollity of the college.  But\nhis knowledge of the world was confined to the university; his\nlearning was of the last, rather than the present age; his temper\nwas indolent; his faculties, which were not of the first rate, had\nbeen relaxed by the climate, and he was satisfied, like his fellows,\nwith the slight and superficial discharge of an important trust.  As\nsoon as my tutor had sounded the insufficiency of his pupil in\nschool-learning, he proposed that we should read every morning from\nten to eleven the comedies of Terence.  The sum of my improvement in\nthe university of Oxford is confined to three or four Latin plays;\nand even the study of an elegant classic, which might have been\nillustrated by a comparison of ancient and modern theatres, was\nreduced to a dry and literal interpretation of the author's text.\nDuring the first weeks I constantly attended these lessons in my\ntutor's room; but as they appeared equally devoid of profit and\npleasure I was once tempted to try the experiment of a formal\napology.  The apology was accepted with a smile.  I repeated the\noffence with less ceremony; the excuse was admitted with the same\nindulgence: the slightest motive of laziness or indisposition, the\nmost trifling avocation at home or abroad, was allowed as a worthy\nimpediment; nor did my tutor appear conscious of my absence or\nneglect.  Had the hour of lecture been constantly filled, a single\nhour was a small portion of my academic leisure.  No plan of study\nwas recommended for my use; no exercises were prescribed for his\ninspection; and, at the most precious season of youth, whole days\nand weeks were suffered to elapse without labour or amusement,\nwithout advice or account.  I should have listened to the voice of\nreason and of my tutor; his mild behaviour had gained my confidence.\nI preferred his society to that of the younger students; and in our\nevening walks to the top of Heddington-hill, we freely conversed on\na variety of subjects.  Since the days of Pocock and Hyde, Oriental\nlearning has always been the pride of Oxford, and I once expressed\nan inclination to study Arabic.  His prudence discouraged this\nchildish fancy; but he neglected the fair occasion of directing the\nardour of a curious mind.  During my absence in the summer vacation,\nDr. Waldegrave accepted a college living at Washington in Sussex,\nand on my return I no longer found him at Oxford.  From that time I\nhave lost sight of my first tutor; but at the end of thirty years\n(1781) he was still alive; and the practice of exercise and\ntemperance had entitled him to a healthy old age.\n\nThe long recess between the Trinity and Michaelmas terms empties the\ncolleges of Oxford, as well as the courts of Westminster.  I spent,\nat my father's house at Beriton in Hampshire, the two months of\nAugust and September.  It is whimsical enough, that as soon as I\nleft Magdalen College, my taste for books began to revive; but it\nwas the same blind and boyish taste for the pursuit of exotic\nhistory.  Unprovided with original learning, unformed in the habits\nof thinking, unskilled in the arts of composition, I resolved to\nwrite a book.  The title of this first Essay, The Age of Sesostris,\nwas perhaps suggested by Voltaire's Age of Lewis XIV. which was new\nand popular; but my sole object was to investigate the probable date\nof the life and reign of the conqueror of Asia.  I was then\nenamoured of Sir John Marsham's Canon Chronicus; an elaborate work,\nof whose merits and defects I was not yet qualified to judge.\nAccording to his specious, though narrow plan, I settled my hero\nabout the time of Solomon, in the tenth century before the Christian\nera.  It was therefore incumbent on me, unless I would adopt Sir\nIsaac Newton's shorter chronology, to remove a formidable objection;\nand my solution, for a youth of fifteen, is not devoid of ingenuity.\nIn his version of the Sacred Books, Manetho, high priest has\nidentified Sethosis, or Sesostris, with the elder brother of Danaus,\nwho landed in Greece, according to the Parian Marble, fifteen\nhundred and ten years before Christ.  But in my supposition the high\npriest is guilty of a voluntary error; flattery is the prolific\nparent of falsehood.  Manetho's History of Egypt is dedicated to\nPtolemy Philadelphus, who derived a fabulous or illegitimate\npedigree from the Macedonian kings of the race of Hercules.  Danaus\nis the ancestor of Hercules; and after the failure of the elder\nbranch, his descendants, the Ptolemies, are the sole representatives\nof the royal family, and may claim by inheritance the kingdom which\nthey hold by conquest.  Such were my juvenile discoveries; at a\nriper age I no longer presume to connect the Greek, the Jewish, and\nthe Egyptian antiquities, which are lost in a distant cloud.  Nor is\nthis the only instance, in which the belief and knowledge of the\nchild are superseded by the more rational ignorance of the man.\nDuring my stay at Beriton, my infant-labour was diligently\nprosecuted, without much interruption from company or country\ndiversions; and I already heard the music of public applause.  The\ndiscovery of my own weakness was the first symptom of taste.  On my\nreturn to Oxford, the Age of Sesostris was wisely relinquished; but\nthe imperfect sheets remained twenty years at the bottom of a\ndrawer, till, in a general clearance of papers (Nov., 1772,) they\nwere committed to the flames.\n\nAfter the departure of Dr. Waldegrave, I was transferred, with his\nother pupils, to his academical heir, whose literary character did\nnot command the respect of the college.  Dr--- well remembered that\nhe had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to\nperform.  Instead of guiding the studies, and watching over the\nbehaviour of his disciple, I was never summoned to attend even the\nceremony of a lecture; and, excepting one voluntary visit to his\nrooms, during the eight months of his titular office, the tutor and\npupil lived in the same college as strangers to each other.  The\nwant of experience, of advice, and of occupation, soon betrayed me\ninto some improprieties of conduct, ill-chosen company, late hours,\nand inconsiderate expense.  My growing debts might be secret; but my\nfrequent absence was visible and scandalous: and a tour to Bath, a\nvisit into Buckingham-shire, and four excursions to London in the\nsame winter, were costly and dangerous frolics.  They were, indeed,\nwithout a meaning, as without an excuse.  The irksomeness of a\ncloistered life repeatedly tempted me to wander; but my chief\npleasure was that of travelling; and I was too young and bashful to\nenjoy, like a Manly Oxonian in Town, the pleasures of London.  In\nall these excursions I eloped from Oxford; I returned to college; in\na few days I eloped again, as if I had been an independent stranger\nin a hired lodging, without once hearing the voice of admonition,\nwithout once feeling the hand of control.  Yet my time was lost, my\nexpenses were multiplied, my behaviour abroad was unknown; folly as\nwell as vice should have awakened the attention of my superiors, and\nmy tender years would have justified a more than ordinary degree of\nrestraint and discipline.\n\nIt might at least be expected, that an ecclesiastical school should\ninculcate the orthodox principles of religion.  But our venerable\nmother had contrived to unite the opposite extremes of bigotry and\nindifference: an heretic, or unbeliever, was a monster in her eyes;\nbut she was always, or often, or sometimes, remiss in the spiritual\neducation of her own children.  According to the statutes of the\nuniversity, every student, before he is matriculated, must subscribe\nhis assent to the thirty-nine articles of the church of England,\nwhich are signed by more than read, and read by more than believe\nthem.  My insufficient age excused me, however, from the immediate\nperformance of this legal ceremony; and the vice-chancellor directed\nme to return, as soon as I should have accomplished my fifteenth\nyear; recommending me, in the mean while, to the instruction of my\ncollege.  My college forgot to instruct: I forgot to return, and was\nmyself forgotten by the first magistrate of the university.  Without\na single lecture, either public or private, either christian or\nprotestant, without any academical subscription, without any\nepiscopal confirmation, I was left by the dim light of my catechism\nto grope my way to the chapel and communion-table, where I was\nadmitted, without a question, how far, or by what means, I might be\nqualified to receive the sacrament.  Such almost incredible neglect\nwas productive of the worst mischiefs.  From my childhood I had been\nfond of religious disputation: my poor aunt has been often puzzled\nby the mysteries which she strove to believe; nor had the elastic\nspring been totally broken by the weight of the atmosphere of\nOxford.  The blind activity of idleness urged me to advance without\narmour into the dangerous mazes of controversy; and at the age of\nsixteen, I bewildered myself in the errors of the church of Rome.\n\nThe progress of my conversion may tend to illustrate, at least, the\nhistory of my own mind.  It was not long since Dr. Middleton's free\ninquiry had founded an alarm in the theological world: much ink and\nmuch gall had been spilt in the defence of the primitive miracles;\nand the two dullest of their champions were crowned with academic\nhonours by the university of Oxford.  The name of Middleton was\nunpopular; and his proscription very naturally led me to peruse his\nwritings, and those of his antagonists.  His bold criticism, which\napproaches the precipice of infidelity, produced on my mind a\nsingular effect; and had I persevered in the communion of Rome, I\nshould now apply to my own fortune the prediction of the Sibyl,\n\n               --Via prima salutis,\n          Quod minime reris, Graia, pandetur ab urbe.\n\nThe elegance of style and freedom of argument were repelled by a\nshield of prejudice.  I still revered the character, or rather the\nnames, of the saints and fathers whom Dr. Middleton exposes; nor\ncould he destroy my implicit belief, that the gift of miraculous\npowers was continued in the church, during the first four or five\ncenturies of Christianity.  But I was unable to resist the weight of\nhistorical evidence, that within the same period most of the leading\ndoctrines of popery were already introduced in theory and practice:\nnor was my conclusion absurd, that miracles are the test of truth,\nand that the church must be orthodox and pure, which was so often\napproved by the visible interposition of the Deity.  The marvellous\ntales which are so boldly attested by the Basils and Chrysostoms,\nthe Austins and Jeroms, compelled me to embrace the superior merits\nof celibacy, the institution of the monastic life, the use of the\nsign of the cross, of holy oil, and even of images, the invocation\nof saints, the worship of relics, the rudiments of purgatory in\nprayers for the dead, and the tremendous mystery of the sacrifice of\nthe body and blood of Christ, which insensibly swelled into the\nprodigy of transubstantiation.  In these dispositions, and already\nmore than half a convert, I formed an unlucky intimacy with a young\ngentleman of our college, whose name I shall spare.  With a\ncharacter less resolute, Mr.--- had imbibed the same religious\nopinions; and some Popish books, I know not through what channel,\nwere conveyed into his possession.  I read, I applauded, I believed\nthe English translations of two famous works of Bossuet, Bishop of\nMeaux, the Exposition of the Catholic Doctrine, and the History of\nthe Protestant Variations, achieved my conversion, and I surely fell\nby a noble hand.  I have since examined the originals with a more\ndiscerning eye, and shall not hesitate to pronounce, that Bossuet is\nindeed a master of all the weapons of controversy.  In the\nExposition, a specious apology, the orator assumes, with consummate\nart, the tone of candour and simplicity; and the ten-horned monster\nis transformed, at his magic touch, into the milk-white hind, who\nmust be loved as soon as she is seen.  In the History, a bold and\nwell-aimed attack, he displays, with a happy mixture of narrative\nand argument, the faults and follies, the changes and contradictions\nof our first reformers; whose variations (as he dexterously\ncontends) are the mark of historical error, while the perpetual\nunity of the catholic church is the sign and test of infallible\ntruth.  To my present feelings it seems incredible that I should\never believe that I believed in transubstantiation.  But my\nconqueror oppressed me with the sacramental words, \"Hoc est corpus\nmeum,\" and dashed against each other the figurative half-meanings of\nthe protestant sects: every objection was resolved into omnipotence;\nand after repeating at St. Mary's the Athanasian creed, I humbly\nacquiesced in the mystery of the real presence.\n\n     \"To take up half on trust, and half to try,\n     Name it not faith, but bungling bigotry,\n     Both knave and fool, the merchant we may call,\n     To pay great sums, and to compound the small,\n     For who would break with Heaven, and would not break for all?\"\n\nNo sooner had I settled my new religion than I resolved to profess\nmyself a catholic.  Youth is sincere and impetuous; and a momentary\nglow of enthusiasm had raised me above all temporal considerations.\n\nBy the keen protestants, who would gladly retaliate the example of\npersecution, a clamour is raised of the increase of popery: and they\nare always loud to declaim against the toleration of priests and\njesuits, who pervert so many of his majesty's subjects from their\nreligion and allegiance.  On the present occasion, the fall of one\nor more of her sons directed this clamour against the university:\nand it was confidently affirmed that popish missionaries were\nsuffered, under various disguises, to introduce themselves into the\ncolleges of Oxford.  But justice obliges me to declare, that, as far\nas relates to myself, this assertion is false; and that I never\nconversed with a priest, or even with a papist, till my resolution\nfrom books was absolutely fixed.  In my last excursion to London, I\naddressed myself to Mr. Lewis, a Roman catholic bookseller in\nRussell-street, Covent Garden, who recommended me to a priest, of\nwhose name and order I am at present ignorant.  In our first\ninterview he soon discovered that persuasion was needless.  After\nsounding the motives and merits of my conversion he consented to\nadmit me into the pale of the church; and at his feet on the eighth\nof June 1753, I solemnly, though privately, abjured the errors of\nheresy.  The seduction of an English youth of family and fortune was\nan act of as much danger as glory; but he bravely overlooked the\ndanger, of which I was not then sufficiently informed.  \"Where a\nperson is reconciled to the see of Rome, or procures others to be\nreconciled, the offence (says Blackstone) amounts to high treason.\"\nAnd if the humanity of the age would prevent the execution of this\nsanguinary statute, there were other laws of a less odious cast,\nwhich condemned the priest to perpetual imprisonment, and\ntransferred the proselyte's estate to his nearest relation.  An\nelaborate controversial epistle, approved by my director, and\naddressed to my father, announced and justified the step which I had\ntaken.  My father was neither a bigot nor a philosopher; but his\naffection deplored the loss of an only son; and his good sense was\nastonished at my strange departure from the religion of my country.\nIn the first sally of passion he divulged a secret which prudence\nmight have suppressed, and the gates of Magdalen College were for\never shut against my return.  Many years afterwards, when the name\nof Gibbon was become as notorious as that of Middleton, it was\nindustriously whispered at Oxford, that the historian had formerly\n\"turned papist;\" my character stood exposed to the reproach of\ninconstancy; and this invidious topic would have been handled\nwithout mercy by my opponents, could they have separated my cause\nfrom that of the university.  For my own part, I am proud of an\nhonest sacrifice of interest to conscience.  I can never blush, if\nmy tender mind was entangled in the sophistry that seduced the acute\nand manly understandings of CHILLINGWORTH and BAYLE, who afterwards\nemerged from superstition to scepticism.\n\nWhile Charles the First governed England, and was himself governed\nby a catholic queen, it cannot be denied that the missionaries of\nRome laboured with impunity and success in the court, the country,\nand even the universities.  One of the sheep,\n\n          --Whom the grim wolf with privy paw\n          Daily devours apace, and nothing said,\n\nis Mr. William Chillingworth, Master of Arts, and Fellow of Trinity\nCollege, Oxford; who, at the ripe age of twenty-eight years, was\npersuaded to elope from Oxford, to the English seminary at Douay in\nFlanders.  Some disputes with Fisher, a subtle jesuit, might first\nawaken him from the prejudices of education; but he yielded to his\nown victorious argument, \"that there must be somewhere an infallible\njudge; and that the church of Rome is the only Christian society\nwhich either does or can pretend to that character.\"  After a short\ntrial of a few months, Mr. Chillingworth was again tormented by\nreligious scruples: he returned home, resumed his studies,\nunravelled his mistakes, and delivered his mind from the yoke of\nauthority and superstition.  His new creed was built on the\nprinciple, that the Bible is our sole judge, and private reason our\nsole interpreter: and he ably maintains this principle in the\nReligion of a Protestant, a book which, after startling the doctors\nof Oxford, is still esteemed the most solid defence of the\nReformation.  The learning, the virtue, the recent merits of the\nauthor, entitled him to fair preferment: but the slave had now\nbroken his fetters; and the more he weighed, the less was he\ndisposed to subscribe to the thirty-nine articles of the church of\nEngland.  In a private letter he declares, with all the energy of\nlanguage, that he could not subscribe to them without subscribing to\nhis own damnation; and that if ever he should depart from this\nimmoveable resolution, he would allow his friends to think him a\nmadman, or an atheist.  As the letter is without a date, we cannot\nascertain the number of weeks or months that elapsed between this\npassionate abhorrence and the Salisbury Register, which is still\nextant.  \"Ego Gulielmus Chillingworth,...... omnibus hisce\narticulis....... et singulis in iisdem contentis volens, et ex\nanimo subscribo, et consensum meum iisdem praebeo.  20 die Julii\n1638.\"  But, alas! the chancellor and prebendary of Sarum soon\ndeviated from his own subscription: as he more deeply scrutinized\nthe article of the Trinity, neither scripture nor the primitive\nfathers could long uphold his orthodox belief; and he could not but\nconfess, \"that the doctrine of Arius is either the truth, or at\nleast no damnable heresy.\"  From this middle region of the air, the\ndescent of his reason would naturally rest on the firmer ground of\nthe Socinians: and if we may credit a doubtful story, and the\npopular opinion, his anxious inquiries at last subsided in\nphilosophic indifference.  So conspicuous, however, were the candour\nof his nature and the innocence of his heart, that this apparent\nlevity did not affect the reputation of Chillingworth.  His frequent\nchanges proceeded from too nice an inquisition into truth.  His\ndoubts grew out of himself; he assisted them with all the strength\nof his reason: he was then too hard for himself; but finding as\nlittle quiet and repose in those victories, he quickly recovered, by\na new appeal to his own judgment: so that in all his sallies and\nretreats, he was in fact his own convert.\n\nBayle was the son of a Calvinist minister in a remote province of\nFrance, at the foot of the Pyrenees.  For the benefit of education,\nthe protestants were tempted to risk their children in the catholic\nuniversities; and in the twenty-second year of his age, young Bayle\nwas seduced by the arts and arguments of the jesuits of Toulouse.\nHe remained about seventeen months (Mar. 19 1669--Aug. 19 1670) in\ntheir hands, a voluntary captive: and a letter to his parents, which\nthe new convert composed or subscribed (April 15 1670), is darkly\ntinged with the spirit of popery.  But Nature had designed him to\nthink as he pleased, and to speak as he thought: his piety was\noffended by the excessive worship of creatures; and the study of\nphysics convinced him of the impossibility of transubstantiation,\nwhich is abundantly refuted by the testimony of our senses.  His\nreturn to the communion of a falling sect was a bold and\ndisinterested step, that exposed him to the rigour of the laws; and\na speedy flight to Geneva protected him from the resentment of his\nspiritual tyrants, unconscious as they were of the full value of the\nprize, which they had lost.  Had Bayle adhered to the catholic\nchurch, had he embraced the ecclesiastical profession, the genius\nand favour of such a proselyte might have aspired to wealth and\nhonours in his native country: but the hypocrite would have found\nless happiness in the comforts of a benefice, or the dignity of a\nmitre, than he enjoyed at Rotterdam in a private state of exile,\nindigence, and freedom.  Without a country, or a patron, or a\nprejudice, he claimed the liberty and subsisted by the labours of\nhis pen: the inequality of his voluminous works is explained and\nexcused by his alternately writing for himself, for the booksellers,\nand for posterity; and if a severe critic would reduce him to a\nsingle folio, that relic, like the books of the Sibyl, would become\nstill more valuable.  A calm and lofty spectator of the religious\ntempest, the philosopher of Rotterdam condemned with equal firmness\nthe persecution of Lewis the Fourteenth, and the republican maxims\nof the Calvinists; their vain prophecies, and the intolerant bigotry\nwhich sometimes vexed his solitary retreat.  In reviewing the\ncontroversies of the times, he turned against each other the\narguments of the disputants; successively wielding the arms of the\ncatholics and protestants, he proves that neither the way of\nauthority, nor the way of examination can afford the multitude any\ntest of religious truth; and dexterously concludes that custom and\neducation must be the sole grounds of popular belief.  The ancient\nparadox of Plutarch, that atheism is less pernicious than\nsuperstition, acquires a tenfold vigor, when it is adorned with the\ncolours of his wit, and pointed with the acuteness of his logic.\nHis critical dictionary is a vast repository of facts and opinions;\nand he balances the false religions in his sceptical scales, till\nthe opposite quantities (if I may use the language of algebra)\nannihilate each other.  The wonderful power which he so boldly\nexercised, of assembling doubts and objections, had tempted him\njocosely to assume the title of the {Greek expression} Zeus, the\ncloud-compelling Jove; and in a conversation with the ingenious Abbe\n(afterwards Cardinal) de Polignac, he freely disclosed his universal\nPyrrhonism.  \"I am most truly (said Bayle) a protestant; for I\nprotest indifferently against all systems and all sects.\"\n\nThe academical resentment, which I may possibly have provoked, will\nprudently spare this plain narrative of my studies, or rather of my\nidleness; and of the unfortunate event which shortened the term of\nmy residence at Oxford.  But it may be suggested, that my father was\nunlucky in the choice of a society, and the chance of a tutor. It\nwill perhaps be asserted, that in the lapse of forty years many\nimprovements have taken place in the college and in the university.\nI am not unwilling to believe, that some tutors might have been\nfound more active than Dr. Waldgrave, and less contemptible than\nDr.****.  About the same time, and in the same walk, a Bentham was\nstill treading in the footsteps of a Burton, whose maxims he had\nadopted, and whose life he had published.  The biographer indeed\npreferred the school-logic to the new philosophy, Burgursdicius to\nLocke; and the hero appears, in his own writings, a stiff and\nconceited pedant.  Yet even these men, according to the measure of\ntheir capacity, might be diligent and useful; and it is recorded of\nBurton, that he taught his pupils what he knew; some Latin, some\nGreek, some ethics and metaphysics; referring them to proper masters\nfor the languages and sciences of which he was ignorant.  At a more\nrecent period, many students have been attracted by the merit and\nreputation of Sir William Scott, then a tutor in University College,\nand now conspicuous in the profession of the civil law: my personal\nacquaintance with that gentleman has inspired me with a just esteem\nfor his abilities and knowledge; and I am assured that his lectures\non history would compose, were they given to the public, a most\nvaluable treatise.  Under the auspices of the present Archbishop of\nYork, Dr. Markham, himself an eminent scholar, a more regular\ndiscipline has been introduced, as I am told, at Christ Church; a\ncourse of classical and philosophical studies is proposed, and even\npursued, in that numerous seminary: learning has been made a duty, a\npleasure, and even a fashion; and several young gentlemen do honour\nto the college in which they have been educated.  According to the\nwill of the donor, the profit of the second part of Lord Clarendon's\nHistory has been applied to the establishment of a riding-school,\nthat the polite exercises might be taught, I know not with what\nsuccess, in the university.  The Vinerian professorship is of far\nmore serious importance; the laws of his country are the first\nscience of an Englishman of rank and fortune, who is called to be a\nmagistrate, and may hope to be a legislator.  This judicious\ninstitution was coldly entertained by the graver doctors, who\ncomplained (I have heard the complaint) that it would take the young\npeople from their books: but Mr. Viner's benefaction is not\nunprofitable, since it has at least produced the excellent\ncommentaries of Sir William Blackstone.\n\nAfter carrying me to Putney, to the house of his friend Mr. Mallet,\nby whose philosophy I was rather scandalized than reclaimed, it was\nnecessary for my father to form a new plan of education, and to\ndevise some method which, if possible, might effect the cure of my\nspiritual malady.  After much debate it was determined, from the\nadvice and personal experience of Mr. Eliot (now Lord Eliot) to fix\nme, during some years, at Lausanne in Switzerland.  Mr. Frey, a\nSwiss gentleman of Basil, undertook the conduct of the journey: we\nleft London the 19th of June, crossed the sea from Dover to Calais,\ntravelled post through several provinces of France, by the direct\nroad of St. Quentin, Rheims, Langres, and Besancon, and arrived the\n30th of June at Lausanne, where I was immediately settled under the\nroof and tuition of Mr. Pavilliard, a Calvinist minister.\n\nThe first marks of my father's displeasure rather astonished than\nafflicted me: when he threatened to banish, and disown, and\ndisinherit a rebellious son, I cherished a secret hope that he would\nnot be able or willing to effect his menaces; and the pride of\nconscience encouraged me to sustain the honourable and important\npart which I was now acting.  My spirits were raised and kept alive\nby the rapid motion of my journey, the new and various scenes of the\nContinent, and the civility of Mr. Frey, a man of sense, who was not\nignorant of books or the world.  But after he had resigned me into\nPavilliard's hands, and I was fixed in my new habitation, I had\nleisure to contemplate the strange and melancholy prospect before\nme.  My first complaint arose from my ignorance of the language.  In\nmy childhood I had once studied the French grammar, and I could\nimperfectly understand the easy prose of a familiar subject.  But\nwhen I was thus suddenly cast on a foreign land, I found myself\ndeprived of the use of speech and of hearing; and, during some\nweeks, incapable not only of enjoying the pleasures of conversation,\nbut even of asking or answering a question in the common intercourse\nof life.  To a home-bred Englishman every object, every custom was\noffensive; but the native of any country might have been disgusted\nwith the general aspect of his lodging and entertainment.  I had now\nexchanged my elegant apartment in Magdalen College, for a narrow,\ngloomy street, the most unfrequented of an unhandsome town, for an\nold inconvenient house, and for a small chamber ill-contrived and\nill-furnished, which, on the approach of Winter, instead of a\ncompanionable fire, must be warmed by the dull invisible heat of a\nstove.  From a man I was again degraded to the dependence of a\nschoolboy.  Mr. Pavilliard managed my expences, which had been\nreduced to a diminutive state: I received a small monthly allowance\nfor my pocket-money; and helpless and awkward as I have ever been, I\nno longer enjoyed the indispensable comfort of a servant.  My\ncondition seemed as destitute of hope, as it was devoid of pleasure:\nI was separated for an indefinite, which appeared an infinite term\nfrom my native country; and I had lost all connexion with my\ncatholic friends.  I have since reflected with surprise, that as the\nRomish clergy of every part of Europe maintain a close\ncorrespondence with each other, they never attempted, by letters or\nmessages, to rescue me from the hands of the heretics, or at least\nto confirm my zeal and constancy in the profession of the faith.\nSuch was my first introduction to Lausanne; a place where I spent\nnearly five years with pleasure and profit, which I afterwards\nrevisited without compulsion, and which I have finally selected as\nthe most grateful retreat for the decline of my life.\n\nBut it is the peculiar felicity of youth that the most unpleasing\nobjects and events seldom make a deep or lasting impression; it\nforgets the past, enjoys the present, and anticipates the future. At\nthe flexible age of sixteen I soon learned to endure, and gradually\nto adopt, the new forms of arbitrary manners: the real hardships of\nmy situation were alienated by time.  Had I been sent abroad in a\nmore splendid style, such as the fortune and bounty of my father\nmight have supplied, I might have returned home with the same stock\nof language and science, which our countrymen usually import from\nthe Continent. An exile and a prisoner as I was, their example\nbetrayed me into some irregularities of wine, of play, and of idle\nexcursions: but I soon felt the impossibility of associating with\nthem on equal terms; and after the departure of my first\nacquaintance, I held a cold and civil correspondence with their\nsuccessors.  This seclusion from English society was attended with\nthe most solid benefits.  In the Pays de Vaud, the French language\nis used with less imperfection than in most of the distant provinces\nof France: in Pavilliard's family, necessity compelled me to listen\nand to speak; and if I was at first disheartened by the apparent\nslowness, in a few months I was astonished by the rapidity of my\nprogress.  My pronunciation was formed by the constant repetition of\nthe same sounds; the variety of words and idioms, the rules of\ngrammar, and distinctions of genders, were impressed in my memory\nease and freedom were obtained by practice; correctness and elegance\nby labour; and before I was recalled home, French, in which I\nspontaneously thought, was more familiar than English to my ear, my\ntongue, and my pen.  The first effect of this opening knowledge was\nthe revival of my love of reading, which had been chilled at Oxford;\nand I soon turned over, without much choice, almost all the French\nbooks in my tutor's library.  Even these amusements were productive\nof real advantage: my taste and judgment were now somewhat riper.  I\nwas introduced to a new mode of style and literature: by the\ncomparison of manners and opinions, my views were enlarged, my\nprejudices were corrected, and a copious voluntary abstract of the\nHistoire de l'Eglise et de l'Empire, by le Sueur, may be placed in a\nmiddle line between my childish and my manly studies.  As soon as I\nwas able to converse with the natives, I began to feel some\nsatisfaction in their company my awkward timidity was polished and\nemboldened; and I frequented, for the first time, assemblies of men\nand women.  The acquaintance of the Pavilliards prepared me by\ndegrees for more elegant society. I was received with kindness and\nindulgence in the best families of Lausanne; and it was in one of\nthese that I formed an intimate and lasting connection with Mr.\nDeyverdun, a young man of an amiable temper and excellent\nunderstanding.  In the arts of fencing and dancing, small indeed was\nmy proficiency; and some months were idly wasted in the\nriding-school.  My unfitness to bodily exercise reconciled me to a\nsedentary life, and the horse, the favourite of my countrymen, never\ncontributed to the pleasures of my youth.\n\nMy obligations to the lessons of Mr. Pavilliard, gratitude will not\nsuffer me to forget: he was endowed with a clear head and a warm\nheart; his innate benevolence had assuaged the spirit of the church;\nhe was rational, because he was moderate: in the course of his\nstudies he had acquired a just though superficial knowledge of most\nbranches of literature; by long practice, he was skilled in the arts\nof teaching; and he laboured with assiduous patience to know the\ncharacter, gain the affection, and open the mind of his English\npupil.  As soon as we began to understand each other, he gently led\nme, from a blind and undistinguishing love of reading, into the path\nof instruction.  I consented with pleasure that a portion of the\nmorning hours should be consecrated to a plan of modern history and\ngeography, and to the critical perusal of the French and Latin\nclassics; and at each step I felt myself invigorated by the habits\nof application and method.  His prudence repressed and dissembled\nsome youthful sallies; and as soon as I was confirmed in the habits\nof industry and temperance, he gave the reins into my own hands.\nHis favourable report of my behaviour and progress gradually\nobtained some latitude of action and expence; and he wished to\nalleviate the hardships of my lodging and entertainment.  The\nprinciples of philosophy were associated with the examples of taste;\nand by a singular chance, the book, as well as the man, which\ncontributed the most effectually to my education, has a stronger\nclaim on my gratitude than on my admiration.  Mr. De Crousaz, the\nadversary of Bayle and Pope, is not distinguished by lively fancy or\nprofound reflection; and even in his own country, at the end of a\nfew years, his name and writings are almost obliterated.  But his\nphilosophy had been formed in the school of Locke, his divinity in\nthat of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious life, several\ngenerations of pupils were taught to think, and even to write; his\nlessons rescued the academy of Lausanne from Calvinistic prejudice;\nand he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit among\nthe clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud.  His system of logic,\nwhich in the last editions has swelled to six tedious and prolix\nvolumes, may be praised as a clear and methodical abridgment of the\nart of reasoning, from our simple ideas to the most complex\noperations of the human understanding.  This system I studied, and\nmeditated, and abstracted, till I have obtained the free command of\nan universal instrument, which I soon presumed to exercise on my\ncatholic opinions.  Pavilliard was not unmindful that his first\ntask, his most important duty, was to reclaim me from the errors of\npopery.  The intermixture of sects has rendered the Swiss clergy\nacute and learned on the topics of controversy; and I have some of\nhis letters in which he celebrates the dexterity of his attack, and\nmy gradual concessions after a firm and well-managed defence.  I was\nwilling, and I am now willing, to allow him a handsome share of the\nhonour of my conversion: yet I must observe, that it was principally\neffected by my private reflections; and I still remember my solitary\ntransport at the discovery of a philosophical argument against the\ndoctrine of transubstantiation: that the text of scripture, which\nseems to inculcate the real presence, is attested only by a single\nsense--our sight; while the real presence itself is disproved\nby three of our senses--the sight, the touch, and the taste.  The\nvarious articles of the Romish creed disappeared like a dream; and\nafter a full conviction, on Christmas-day, 1754, I received the\nsacrament in the church of Lausanne.  It was here that I suspended\nmy religious inquiries, acquiescing with implicit belief in the\ntenets and mysteries, which are adopted by the general consent of\ncatholics and protestants.\n\nSuch, from my arrival at Lausanne, during the first eighteen or\ntwenty months (July 1753--March 1755), were my useful studies, the\nfoundation of all my future improvements.  But every man who rises\nabove the common level has received two educations: the first from\nhis teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself.\nHe will not, like the fanatics of the last age, define the moment of\ngrace; but he cannot forget the aera of his life, in which his mind\nhas expanded to its proper form and dimensions.  My worthy tutor had\nthe good sense and modesty to discern how far he could be useful: as\nsoon as he felt that I advanced beyond his speed and measure, he\nwisely left me to my genius; and the hours of lesson were soon lost\nin the voluntary labour of the whole morning, and sometimes of the\nwhole day.  The desire of prolonging my time, gradually confirmed\nthe salutary habit of early rising, to which I have always adhered,\nwith some regard to seasons and situations; but it is happy for my\neyes and my health, that my temperate ardour has never been seduced\nto trespass on the hours of the night.  During the last three years\nof my residence at Lausanne, I may assume the merit of serious and\nsolid application; but I am tempted to distinguish the last eight\nmonths of the year 1755, as the period of the most extraordinary\ndiligence and rapid progress.  In my French and Latin translations I\nadopted an excellent method, which, from my own success, I would\nrecommend to the imitation of students.  I chose some classic\nwriter, such as Cicero and Vertot, the most approved for purity and\nelegance of style.  I translated, for instance, an epistle of Cicero\ninto French; and after throwing it aside, till the words and phrases\nwere obliterated from my memory, I re-translated my French into such\nLatin as I could find; and then compared each sentence of my\nimperfect version, with the ease, the grace, the propriety of the\nRoman orator.  A similar experiment was made on several pages of the\nRevolutions of Vertot; I turned them into Latin, returned them after\na sufficient interval into my own French, and again scrutinized the\nresemblance or dissimilitude of the copy and the original.  By\ndegrees I was less ashamed, by degrees I was more satisfied with\nmyself; and I persevered in the practice of these double\ntranslations, which filled several books, till I had acquired the\nknowledge or both idioms, and the command at least of a correct\nstyle.  This useful exercise of writing was accompanied and\nsucceeded by the more pleasing occupation of reading the best\nauthors.  The perusal of the Roman classics was at once my exercise\nand reward.  Dr. Middleton's History, which I then appreciated above\nits true value, naturally directed the to the writings of Cicero.\nThe most perfect editions, that of Olivet, which may adorn the\nshelves of the rich, that of Ernesti, which should lie on the table\nof the learned, were not in my power.  For the familiar epistles I\nused the text and English commentary of Bishop Ross: but my general\nedition was that of Verburgius, published at Amsterdam in two large\nvolumes in folio, with an indifferent choice of various notes.  I\nread, with application and pleasure, all the epistles, all the\norations, and the most important treatises of rhetoric and\nphilosophy; and as I read, I applauded the observation of\nQuintilian, that every student may judge of his own proficiency, by\nthe satisfaction which he receives from the Roman orator.  I tasted\nthe beauties of language, I breathed the spirit of freedom, and I\nimbibed from his precepts and examples the public and private sense\nof a man.  Cicero in Latin, and Xenophon in Greek, are indeed the\ntwo ancients whom I would first propose to a liberal scholar; not\nonly for the merit of their style and sentiments, but for the\nadmirable lessons, which may be applied almost to every situation of\npublic and private life.  Cicero's Epistles may in particular afford\nthe models of every form of correspondence, from the careless\neffusions of tenderness and friendship, to the well guarded\ndeclaration of discreet and dignified resentment.  After finishing\nthis great author, a library of eloquence and reason, I formed a\nmore extensive plan of reviewing the Latin classics, under the four\ndivisions of, 1. historians, 2. Poets, 3. orators, and 4.\nphilosophers, in a chronological series, from the days of Plautus\nand Sallust, to the decline of the language and empire of Rome: and\nthis plan, in the last twenty-seven months of my residence at\nLausanne (Jan. 1756--April 1758), I nearly accomplished.  Nor was\nthis review, however rapid, either hasty or superficial.  I indulged\nmyself in a second and even a third perusal of Terence, Virgil,\nHorace, Tacitus, &c.; and studied to imbibe the sense and spirit\nmost congenial to my own.  I never suffered a difficult or corrupt\npassage to escape, till I had viewed it in every light of which it\nwas susceptible: though often disappointed, I always consulted the\nmost learned or ingenious commentators, Torrentius and Dacier on\nHorace, Catrou and Servius on Virgil, Lipsius on Tacitus, Meziriac\non Ovid, &c.; and in the ardour of my inquiries, I embraced a large\ncircle of historical and critical erudition.  My abstracts of each\nbook were made in the French language: my observations often\nbranched into particular essays; and I can still read, without\ncontempt, a dissertation of eight folio pages on eight lines\n(287-294) of the fourth Georgic of Virgil.  Mr. Deyverdun, my\nfriend, whose name will be frequently repeated, had joined with\nequal zeal, though not with equal perseverance, in the same\nundertaking.  To him every thought, every composition, was instantly\ncommunicated; with him I enjoyed the benefits of a free conversation\non the topics of our common studies.\n\nBut it is scarcely possible for a mind endowed with any active\ncuriosity to be long conversant with the Latin classics, without\naspiring to know the Greek originals, whom they celebrate as their\nmasters, and of whom they so warmly recommend the study and\nimitation;\n\n          --Vos exemplaria Graeca\n          Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.\n\nIt was now that I regretted the early years which had been wasted in\nsickness or idleness, or mere idle reading; that I condemned the\nperverse method of our schoolmasters, who, by first teaching the\nmother-language, might descend with so much ease and perspicuity to\nthe origin and etymology of a derivative idiom.  In the nineteenth\nyear of my age I determined to supply this defect; and the lessons\nof Pavilliard again contributed to smooth the entrance of the way,\nthe Greek alphabet, the grammar, and the pronunciation according to\nthe French accent.  At my earnest request we presumed to open the\nIliad; and I had the pleasure of beholding, though darkly and\nthrough a glass, the true image of Homer, whom I had long since\nadmired in an English dress.  After my tutor had left me to myself,\nI worked my way through about half the Iliad, and afterwards\ninterpreted alone a large portion of Xenophon and Herodotus.  But my\nardour, destitute of aid and emulation, was gradually cooled, and,\nfrom the barren task of searching words in a lexicon, I withdrew to\nthe free and familiar conversation of Virgil and Tacitus.  Yet in my\nresidence at Lausanne I had laid a solid foundation, which enabled\nme, in a more propitious season, to prosecute the study of Grecian\nliterature.\n\nFrom a blind idea of the usefulness of such abstract science, my\nfather had been desirous, and even pressing, that I should devote\nsome time to the mathematics; nor could I refuse to comply with so\nreasonable a wish.  During two winters I attended the private\nlectures of Monsieur de Traytorrens, who explained the elements of\nalgebra and geometry, as far as the conic sections of the Marquis de\nl'Hopital, and appeared satisfied with my diligence and improvement.\nBut as my childish propensity for numbers and calculations was\ntotally extinct, I was content to receive the passive impression of\nmy Professor's lectures, without any active exercise of my own\npowers. As soon as I understood the principles, I relinquished for\never the pursuit of the mathematics; nor can I lament that I\ndesisted, before my mind was hardened by the habit of rigid\ndemonstration, so destructive of the finer feelings of moral\nevidence, which must, however, determine the actions and opinions of\nour lives.  I listened with more pleasure to the proposal of\nstudying the law of nature and nations, which was taught in the\nacademy of Lausanne by Mr. Vicat, a professor of some learning and\nreputation.  But instead of attending his public or private course,\nI preferred in my closet the lessons of his masters, and my own\nreason. Without being disgusted by Grotius or Puffendorf, I studied\nin their writings the duties of a man, the rights of a citizen, the\ntheory of justice (it is, alas! a theory), and the laws of peace and\nwar, which have had some influence on the practice of modern Europe.\nMy fatigues were alleviated by the good sense of their commentator\nBarbeyrac.  Locke's Treatise of Government instructed me in the\nknowledge of Whig principles, which are rather founded in reason\nthan experience; but my delight was in the frequent perusal of\nMontesquieu, whose energy of style, and boldness of hypothesis, were\npowerful to awaken and stimulate the genius of the age.  The logic\nof De Crousaz had prepared me to engage with his master Locke and\nhis antagonist Bayle; of whom the former may be used as a bridle,\nand the latter applied as a spur, to the curiosity of a young\nphilosopher.  According to the nature of their respective works, the\nschools of argument and objection, I carefully went through the\nEssay on Human Understanding, and occasionally consulted the most\ninteresting articles of the Philosophic Dictionary.  In the infancy\nof my reason I turned over, as an idle amusement, the most serious\nand important treatise: in its maturity, the most trifling\nperformance could exercise my taste or judgment, and more than once\nI have been led by a novel into a deep and instructive train of\nthinking.  But I cannot forbear to mention three particular books,\nsince they may have remotely contributed to form the historian of\nthe Roman empire.  1. From the Provincial Letters of Pascal, which\nalmost every year I have perused with new pleasure, I learned to\nmanage the weapon of grave and temperate irony, even on subjects of\necclesiastical solemnity.  2. The Life of Julian, by the Abbe de la\nBleterie, first introduced me to the man and the times; and I should\nbe glad to recover my first essay on the truth of the miracle which\nstopped the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem.  3. In Giannone's\nCivil History of Naples I observed with a critical eye the progress\nand abuse of sacerdotal power, and the revolutions of Italy in the\ndarker ages.  This various reading, which I now conducted with\ndiscretion, was digested, according to the precept and model of Mr.\nLocke, into a large common-place book; a practice, however, which I\ndo not strenuously recommend.  The action of the pen will doubtless\nimprint an idea on the mind as well as on the paper: but I much\nquestion whether the benefits of this laborious method are adequate\nto the waste of time; and I must agree with Dr. Johnson, (Idler, No.\n74.) \"that what is twice read, is commonly better remembered, than\nwhat is transcribed.\"\n\nDuring two years, if I forget some boyish excursions of a day or a\nweek, I was fixed at Lausanne; but at the end of the third summer,\nmy father consented that I should make the tour of Switzerland with\nPavilliard: and our short absence of one month (Sept. 21st--Oct.\n20th, 1755) was a reward and relaxation of my assiduous studies.\nThe fashion of climbing the mountains and reviewing the Glaciers,\nhad not yet been introduced by foreign travellers, who seek the\nsublime beauties of nature.  But the political face of the country\nis not less diversified by the forms and spirit of so many various\nrepublics, from the jealous government of the few to the licentious\nfreedom of the many.  I contemplated with pleasure the new prospects\nof men and manners; though my conversation with the natives would\nhave been more free and instructive, had I possessed the German, as\nwell as the French language.  We passed through most of the\nprincipal towns of Switzerland; Neufchatel, Bienne, Soleurre, Arau,\nBaden, Zurich, Basil, and Berne.  In every place we visited the\nchurches, arsenals, libraries, and all the most eminent persons; and\nafter my return, I digested my notes in fourteen or fifteen sheets\nof a French journal, which I dispatched to my father, as a proof\nthat my time and his money had not been mis-spent.  Had I found this\njournal among his papers, I might be tempted to select some\npassages; but I will not transcribe the printed accounts, and it may\nbe sufficient to notice a remarkable spot, which left a deep and\nlasting impression on my memory.  From Zurich we proceeded to the\nBenedictine Abbey of Einfidlen, snore commonly styled Our Lady of\nthe Hermits.  I was astonished by the profuse ostentation of riches\nin the poorest corner of Europe; amidst a savage scene of woods and\nmountains, a palace appears to have been erected by magic; and it\nwas erected by the potent magic of religion.  A crowd of palmers and\nvotaries was prostrate before the altar.  The title and worship of\nthe Mother of God provoked my indignation; and the lively naked\nimage of superstition suggested to me, as in the same place it had\ndone to Zuinglius, the most pressing argument for the reformation of\nthe church.  About two years after this tour, I passed at Geneva a\nuseful and agreeable month; but this excursion, and short visits in\nthe Pays de Vaud, did not materially interrupt my studious and\nsedentary life at Lausanne.\n\nMy thirst of improvement, and the languid state of science at\nLausanne, soon prompted me to solicit a literary correspondence with\nseveral men of learning, whom I had not an opportunity of personally\nconsulting.  1. In the perusal of Livy, (xxx. 44,) I had been\nstopped by a sentence in a speech of Hannibal, which cannot be\nreconciled by any torture with his character or argument.  The\ncommentators dissemble, or confess their perplexity.  It occurred to\nme, that the change of a single letter, by substituting otio instead\nof odio, might restore a clear and consistent sense; but I wished to\nweigh my emendation in scales less partial than my own.  I addressed\nmyself to M. Crevier, the successor of Rollin, and a professor in\nthe university of Paris, who had published a large and valuable\nedition of Livy.  His answer was speedy and polite; he praised my\ningenuity, and adopted my conjecture.  2. I maintained a Latin\ncorrespondence, at first anonymous, and afterwards in my own name,\nwith Professor Breitinger of Zurich, the learned editor of a\nSeptuagint Bible.  In our frequent letters we discussed many\nquestions of antiquity, many passages of the Latin classics.  I\nproposed my interpretations and amendments.  His censures, for he\ndid not spare my boldness of conjecture, were sharp and strong; and\nI was encouraged by the consciousness of my strength, when I could\nstand in free debate against a critic of such eminence and\nerudition.  3. I corresponded on similar topics with the celebrated\nProfessor Matthew Gesner, of the university of Gottingen; and he\naccepted, as courteously as the two former, the invitation of an\nunknown youth.  But his abilities might possibly be decayed; his\nelaborate letters were feeble and prolix; and when I asked his\nproper direction, the vain old man covered half a sheet of paper\nwith the foolish enumeration of his titles and offices.  4. These\nProfessors of Paris, Zurich, and Gottingen, were strangers, whom I\npresumed to address on the credit of their name; but Mr. Allamand,\nMinister at Bex, was my personal friend, with whom I maintained a\nmore free and interesting correspondence.  He was a master of\nlanguage, of science, and, above all, of dispute; and his acute and\nflexible logic could support, with equal address, and perhaps with\nequal indifference, the adverse sides of every possible question.\nHis spirit was active, but his pen had been indolent.  Mr. Allamand\nhad exposed himself to much scandal and reproach, by an anonymous\nletter (1745) to the Protestants of France; in which he labours to\npersuade them that public worship is the exclusive right and duty of\nthe state, and that their numerous assemblies of dissenters and\nrebels were not authorized by the law or the gospel.  His style is\nanimated, his arguments specious; and if the papist may seem to lurk\nunder the mask of a protestant, the philosopher is concealed under\nthe disguise of a papist.  After some trials in France and Holland,\nwhich were defeated by his fortune or his character, a genius that\nmight have enlightened or deluded the world, was buried in a country\nliving, unknown to fame, and discontented with mankind.  Est\nsacrificulus in pago, et rusticos decipit.  As often as private or\necclesiastical business called him to Lausanne, I enjoyed the\npleasure and benefit of his conversation, and we were mutually\nflattered by our attention to each other.  Our correspondence, in\nhis absence, chiefly turned on Locke's metaphysics, which he\nattacked, and I defended; the origin of ideas, the principles of\nevidence, and the doctrine of liberty;\n\n          And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.\n\nBy fencing with so skilful a master, I acquired some dexterity in\nthe use of my philosophic weapons; but I was still the slave of\neducation and prejudice.  He had some measures to keep; and I much\nsuspect that he never showed me the true colours of his secret\nscepticism.\n\nBefore I was recalled from Switzerland, I had the satisfaction of\nseeing the most extraordinary man of the age; a poet, an historian,\na philosopher, who has filled thirty quartos, of prose and verse,\nwith his various productions, often excellent, and always\nentertaining.  Need I add the name of Voltaire? After forfeiting, by\nhis own misconduct, the friendship of the first of kings, he\nretired, at the age of sixty, with a plentiful fortune, to a free\nand beautiful country, and resided two winters (1757 and 1758) in\nthe town or neighbourhood of Lausanne.  My desire of beholding\nVoltaire, whom I then rated above his real magnitude, was easily\ngratified.  He received me with civility as an English youth; but I\ncannot boast of any peculiar notice or distinction, Virgilium vidi\ntantum.\n\nThe ode which he composed on his first arrival on the banks of the\nLeman Lake, O Maison d'Aristippe! O Jardin d'Epicure, &c. had been\nimparted as a secret to the gentleman by whom I was introduced.  He\nallowed me to read it twice; I knew it by heart; and as my\ndiscretion was not equal to my memory, the author was soon\ndispleased by the circulation of a copy.  In writing this trivial\nanecdote, I wished to observe whether my memory was impaired, and I\nhave the comfort of finding that every line of the poem is still\nengraved in fresh and indelible characters.  The highest\ngratification which I derived from Voltaire's residence at Lausanne,\nwas the uncommon circumstance of hearing a great poet declaim his\nown productions on the stage.  He had formed a company of gentlemen\nand ladies, some of whom were not destitute of talents.  A decent\ntheatre was framed at Monrepos, a country-house at the end of a\nsuburb; dresses and scenes were provided at the expense of the\nactors; and the author directed the rehearsals with the zeal and\nattention of paternal love.  In two successive winters his tragedies\nof Zayre, Alzire, Zulime, and his sentimental comedy of the Enfant\nProdigue, were played at the theatre of Monrepos.  Voltaire\nrepresented the characters best adapted to his years, Lusignan,\nAlvarez, Benassar, Euphemon.  His declamation was fashioned to the\npomp and cadence of the old stage; and he expressed the enthusiasm\nof poetry, rather than the feelings of nature.  My ardour, which\nsoon became conspicuous, seldom failed of procuring me a ticket.\nThe habits of pleasure fortified my taste for the French theatre,\nand that taste has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic\ngenius of Shakespeare, which is inculcated from our infancy as the\nfirst duty of an Englishman.  The wit and philosophy of Voltaire,\nhis table and theatre, refined, in a visible degree, the manners of\nLausanne; and, however addicted to study, I enjoyed my share of the\namusements of society.  After the representation of Monrepos I\nsometimes supped with the actors.  I was now familiar in some, and\nacquainted in many houses; and my evenings were generally devoted to\ncards and conversation, either in private parties or numerous\nassemblies.\n\nI hesitate, from the apprehension of ridicule, when I approach the\ndelicate subject of my early love.  By this word I do not mean the\npolite attention, the gallantry, without hope or design, which has\noriginated in the spirit of chivalry, and is interwoven with the\ntexture of French manners.  I understand by this passion the union\nof desire, friendship, and tenderness, which is inflamed by a single\nfemale, which prefers her to the rest of her sex, and which seeks\nher possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our being.  I\nneed not blush at recollecting the object of my choice; and though\nmy love was disappointed of success, I am rather proud that I was\nonce capable of feeling such a pure and exalted sentiment.  The\npersonal attractions of Mademoiselle Susan Curchod were embellished\nby the virtues and talents of the mind.  Her fortune was humble, but\nher family was respectable.  Her mother, a native of France, had\npreferred her religion to her country.  The profession of her father\ndid not extinguish the moderation and philosophy of his temper, and\nhe lived content with a small salary and laborious duty, in the\nobscure lot of minister of Crassy, in the mountains that separate\nthe Pays de Vaud from the county of Burgundy.  In the solitude of a\nsequestered village he bestowed a liberal, and even learned,\neducation on his only daughter.  She surpassed his hopes by her\nproficiency in the sciences and languages; and in her short visits\nto some relations at Lausanne, the wit, the beauty, and erudition of\nMademoiselle Curchod were the theme of universal applause.  The\nreport of such a prodigy awakened my curiosity; I saw and loved.  I\nfound her learned without pedantry, lively in conversation, pure in\nsentiment, and elegant in manners; and the first sudden emotion was\nfortified by the habits and knowledge of a more familiar\nacquaintance.  She permitted me to make her two or three visits at\nher father's house.  I passed some happy days there, in the\nmountains of Burgundy, and her parents honourably encouraged the\nconnection.  In a calm retirement the gay vanity of youth no longer\nfluttered in her bosom; she listened to the voice of truth and\npassion, and I might presume to hope that I had made some impression\non a virtuous heart.  At Crassy and Lausanne I indulged my dream of\nfelicity: but on my return to England, I soon discovered that my\nfather would not hear of this strange alliance, and that without his\nconsent I was myself destitute and helpless.  After a painful\nstruggle I yielded to my fate: I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a\nson; my wound was insensibly healed by time, absence, and the habits\nof a new life.  My cure was accelerated by a faithful report of the\ntranquillity and cheerfulness of the lady herself, and my love\nsubsided in friendship and esteem.  The minister of Crassy soon\nafterwards died; his stipend died with him: his daughter retired to\nGeneva, where, by teaching young ladies, she earned a hard\nsubsistence for herself and her mother; but in her lowest distress\nshe maintained a spotless reputation, and a dignified behaviour.  A\nrich banker of Paris, a citizen of Geneva, had the good fortune and\ngood sense to discover and possess this inestimable treasure; and in\nthe capital of taste and luxury she resisted the temptations of\nwealth, as she had sustained the hardships of indigence.  The genius\nof her husband has exalted him to the most conspicuous station in\nEurope.  In every change of prosperity and disgrace he has reclined\non the bosom of a faithful friend; and Mademoiselle Curchod is now\nthe wife of M. Necker, the minister, and perhaps the legislator, of\nthe French monarchy.\n\nWhatsoever have been the fruits of my education, they must be\nascribed to the fortunate banishment which placed me at Lausanne.  I\nhave sometimes applied to my own fate the verses of Pindar, which\nremind an Olympic champion that his victory was the consequence of\nhis exile; and that at home, like a domestic fowl, his days might\nhave rolled away inactive or inglorious.\n[Greek omitted]\n\n          Thus, like the crested bird of Mars, at home\n               Engag'd in foul domestic jars,\n               And wasted with intestine wars,\n          Inglorious hadst thou spent thy vig'rous bloom;\n               Had not sedition's civil broils\n               Expell'd thee from thy native Crete,\n               And driv'n thee with more glorious toils\n          Th' Olympic crown in Pisa's plain to meet.\n                         West's Pindar.\n\nIf my childish revolt against the religion of my country had not\nstripped me in time of my academic gown, the five important years,\nso liberally improved in the studies and conversation of Lausanne,\nwould have been steeped in port and prejudice among the monks of\nOxford.  Had the fatigue of idleness compelled me to read, the path\nof learning would not have been enlightened by a ray of philosophic\nfreedom.  I should have grown to manhood ignorant of the life and\nlanguage of Europe, and my knowledge of the world would have been\nconfined to an English cloister.  But my religious error fixed me at\nLausanne, in a state of banishment and disgrace.  The rigid course\nof discipline and abstinence, to which I was condemned, invigorated\nthe constitution of my mind and body; poverty and pride estranged me\nfrom my countrymen.  One mischief, however, and in their eyes a\nserious and irreparable mischief, was derived from the success of my\nSwiss education; I had ceased to be an Englishman.  At the flexible\nperiod of youth, from the age of sixteen to twenty-one, my opinions,\nhabits, and sentiments were cast in a foreign mould; the faint and\ndistant remembrance of England was almost obliterated; my native\nlanguage was grown less familiar; and I should have cheerfully\naccepted the offer of a moderate independence on the terms of\nperpetual exile.  By the good sense and temper of Pavilliard my yoke\nwas insensibly lightened: he left me master of my time and actions;\nbut he could neither change my situation, nor increase my allowance,\nand with the progress of my years and reason I impatiently sighed\nfor the moment of my deliverance.  At length, in the spring of the\nyear 1758, my father signified his permission and his pleasure that\nI should immediately return home.  We were then in the midst of a\nwar: the resentment of the French at our taking their ships without\na declaration, had rendered that polite nation somewhat peevish and\ndifficult.  They denied a passage to English travellers, and the\nroad through Germany was circuitous, toilsome, and perhaps in the\nneighbourhood of the armies, exposed to some danger.  In this\nperplexity, two Swiss officers of my acquaintance in the Dutch\nservice, who were returning to their garrisons, offered to conduct\nme through France as one of their companions; nor did we\nsufficiently reflect that my borrowed name and regimentals might\nhave been considered, in case of a discovery, in a very serious\nlight.  I took my leave of Lausanne on April 11 1758, with a mixture\nof joy and regret, in the firm resolution revisiting, as a man, the\npersons and places which had been so dear to my youth.  We travelled\nslowly, but pleasantly, in a hired coach, over the hills of\nFranche-compte and the fertile province of Lorraine, and passed,\nwithout accident or inquiry, through several fortified towns of the\nFrench frontier: from thence we entered the wild Ardennes of the\nAustrian dutchy of Luxemburg; and after crossing the Meuse at Liege,\nwe traversed the heaths of Brabant, and reached, on April 26, our\nDutch garrison of Bois le Duc.  In our passage through Nancy, my eye\nwas gratified by the aspect of a regular and beautiful city, the\nwork of Stanislaus, who, after the storms of Polish royalty, reposed\nin the love and gratitude of his new subjects of Lorraine.  In our\nhalt at Maestricht I visited Mr. de Beaufort, a learned critic, who\nwas known to me by his specious arguments against the five first\ncenturies of the Roman History.  After dropping my regimental\ncompanions, I stepped aside to visit Rotterdam and the Hague.  I\nwished to have observed a country, the monument of freedom and\nindustry; but my days were numbered, and a longer delay would have\nbeen ungraceful.  I hastened to embark at the Brill, landed the next\nday at Harwich, and proceeded to London, where my father awaited my\narrival.  The whole term of my first absence from England was four\nyears ten months and fifteen days.\n\nIn the prayers of the church our personal concerns are judiciously\nreduced to the threefold distinction of mind, body, and estate.  The\nsentiments of the mind excite and exercise our social sympathy.  The\nreview of my moral and literary character is the most interesting to\nmyself and to the public; and I may expatiate, without reproach, on\nmy private studies; since they have produced the public writings,\nwhich can alone entitle me to the esteem and friendship of my\nreaders.  The experience of the world inculcates a discreet reserve\non the subject of our person and estate, and we soon learn that a\nfree disclosure of our riches or poverty would provoke the malice of\nenvy, or encourage the insolence of contempt.\n\nThe only person in England whom I was impatient to see was my aunt\nPorten, the affectionate guardian of my tender years.  I hastened to\nher house in College-street, Westminster; and the evening was spent\nin the effusions of joy and confidence.  It was not without some awe\nand apprehension that I approached the presence of my father.  My\ninfancy, to speak the truth, had been neglected at home; the\nseverity of his look and language at our last parting still dwelt on\nmy memory; nor could I form any notion of his character, or my\nprobable reception.  They were both more agreeable than I could\nexpect.  The domestic discipline of our ancestors has been relaxed\nby the philosophy and softness of the age; and if my father\nremembered that he had trembled before a stern parent, it was only\nto adopt with his own son an opposite mode of behaviour.  He\nreceived me as a man and a friend; all constraint was banished at\nour first interview, and we ever afterwards continued on the same\nterms of easy and equal politeness. He applauded the success of my\neducation; every word and action was expressive of the most cordial\naffection; and our lives would have passed without a cloud, if his\noeconomy had been equal to his fortune, or if his fortune had been\nequal to his desires.  During my absence he had married his second\nwife, Miss Dorothea Patton, who was introduced to me with the most\nunfavourable prejudice.  I considered his second marriage as an act\nof displeasure, and I was disposed to hate the rival of my mother.\nBut the injustice was in my own fancy, and the imaginary monster was\nan amiable and deserving woman.  I could not be mistaken in the\nfirst view of her understanding, her knowledge, and the elegant\nspirit of her conversation: her polite welcome, and her assiduous\ncare to study and gratify my wishes, announced at least that the\nsurface would be smooth; and my suspicions of art and falsehood were\ngradually dispelled by the full discovery of her warm and exquisite\nsensibility. After some reserve on my side, our minds associated in\nconfidence and friendship; and as Mrs. Gibbon had neither children\nnor the hopes of children, we more easily adopted the tender names\nand genuine characters of mother and of son.  By the indulgence of\nthese parents, I was left at liberty to consult my taste or reason\nin the choice of place, of company, and of amusements; and my\nexcursions were bounded only by the limits of the island, and the\nmeasure of my income.  Some faint efforts were made to procure me\nthe employment of secretary to a foreign embassy; and I listened to\na scheme which would again have transported me to the continent.\nMrs. Gibbon, with seeming wisdom, exhorted me to take chambers in\nthe Temple, and devote my leisure to the study of the law.  I cannot\nrepent of having neglected her advice.  Few men, without the spur of\nnecessity, have resolution to force their way, through the thorns\nand thickets of that gloomy labyrinth.  Nature had not endowed me\nwith the bold and ready eloquence which makes itself heard amidst\nthe tumult of the bar; and I should probably have been diverted from\nthe labours of literature, without acquiring the fame or fortune of\na successful pleader.  I had no need to call to my aid the regular\nduties of a profession; every day, every hour, was agreeably filled;\nnor have I known, like so many of my countrymen, the tediousness of\nan idle life.\n\nOf the two years (May 1758-May 1760,) between my return to England\nand the embodying of the Hampshire militia, I passed about nine\nmonths in London, and the remainder in the country.  The metropolis\naffords many amusements, which are open to all.  It is itself an\nastonishing and perpetual spectacle to the curious eye; and each\ntaste, each sense may be gratified by the variety of objects which\nwill occur in the long circuit of a morning walk.  I assiduously\nfrequented the theatres at a very propitious aera of the stage, when\na constellation of excellent actors, both in tragedy and comedy, was\neclipsed by the meridian brightness of Garrick in the maturity of\nhis judgment, and vigour of his performance.  The pleasures of a\ntown-life are within the reach of every man who is regardless of his\nhealth, his money, and his company.  By the contagion of example I\nwas sometimes seduced; but the better habits, which I had formed at\nLausanne, induced me to seek a more elegant and rational society;\nand if my search was less easy and successful than I might have\nhoped, I shall at present impute the failure to the disadvantages of\nmy situation and character.  Had the rank and fortune of my parents\ngiven them an annual establishment in London, their own house would\nhave introduced me to a numerous and polite circle of acquaintance.\nBut my father's taste had always preferred the highest and the\nlowest company, for which he was equally qualified; and after a\ntwelve years' retirement, he was no longer in the memory of the\ngreat with whom he had associated.  I found myself a stranger in the\nmidst of a vast and unknown city; and at my entrance into life I was\nreduced to some dull family parties, and some scattered connections,\nwhich were not such as I should have chosen for myself.  The most\nuseful friends of my father were the Mallets: they received me with\ncivility and kindness at first on his account, and afterwards on my\nown; and (if I may use Lord Chesterfield's words) I was soon\ndomesticated in their house.  Mr. Mallet, a name among the English\npoets, is praised by an unforgiving enemy, for the ease and elegance\nof his conversation, and his wife was not destitute of wit or\nlearning.  By his assistance I was introduced to Lady Hervey, the\nmother of the present earl of Bristol.  Her age and infirmities\nconfined her at home; her dinners were select; in the evening her\nhouse was open to the best company of both sexes and all nations;\nnor was I displeased at her preference and affectation of the\nmanners, the language, and the literature of France.  But my\nprogress in the English world was in general left to my own efforts,\nand those efforts were languid and slow.  I had not been endowed by\nart or nature with those happy gifts of confidence and address,\nwhich unlock every door and every bosom; nor would it be reasonable\nto complain of the just consequences of my sickly childhood, foreign\neducation, and reserved temper.  While coaches were rattling through\nBond-street, I have passed many a solitary evening in my lodging\nwith my books.  My studies were sometimes interrupted by a sigh,\nwhich I breathed towards Lausanne; and on the approach of Spring, I\nwithdrew without reluctance from the noisy and extensive scene of\ncrowds without company, and dissipation without pleasure.  In each\nof the twenty-five years of my acquaintance with London (1758-1783)\nthe prospect gradually brightened; and this unfavourable picture\nmost properly belongs to the first period after my return from\nSwitzerland.\n\nMy father's residence in Hampshire, where I have passed many light,\nand some heavy hours, was at Beriton, near Petersfield, one mile\nfrom the Portsmouth road, and at the easy distance of fifty-eight\nmiles from London.  An old mansion, in a state of decay, had been\nconverted into the fashion and convenience of a modern house: and if\nstrangers had nothing to see, the inhabitants had little to desire.\nThe spot was not happily chosen, at the end of the village and the\nbottom of the hill: but the aspect of the adjacent grounds was\nvarious and cheerful; the downs commanded a noble prospect, and the\nlong hanging woods in sight of the house could not perhaps have been\nimproved by art or expence.  My father kept in his own hands the\nwhole of the estate, and even rented some additional land; and\nwhatsoever might be the balance of profit and loss, the farm\nsupplied him with amusement and plenty.  The produce maintained a\nnumber of men and horses, which were multiplied by the intermixture\nof domestic and rural servants; and in the intervals of labour the\nfavourite team, a handsome set of bays or greys, was harnessed to\nthe coach.  The oeconomy of the house was regulated by the taste and\nprudence of Mrs. Gibbon.  She prided herself in the elegance of her\noccasional dinners; and from the uncleanly avarice of Madame\nPavilliard, I was suddenly transported to the daily neatness and\nluxury of an English table.  Our immediate neighbourhood was rare\nand rustic; but from the verge of our hills, as far as Chichester\nand Goodwood, the western district of Sussex was interspersed with\nnoble seats and hospitable families, with whom we cultivated a\nfriendly, and might have enjoyed a very frequent, intercourse.  As\nmy stay at Buriton was always voluntary, I was received and\ndismissed with smiles; but the comforts of my retirement did not\ndepend on the ordinary pleasures of the country.  My father could\nnever inspire me with his love and knowledge of farming.  I never\nhandled a gun, I seldom mounted an horse; and my philosophic walks\nwere soon terminated by a shady bench, where I was long detained by\nthe sedentary amusement of reading or meditation.  At home I\noccupied a pleasant and spacious apartment; the library on the same\nfloor was soon considered as my peculiar domain; and I might say\nwith truth, that I was never less alone than when by myself.  My\nsole complaint, which I piously suppressed, arose from the kind\nrestraint imposed on the freedom of my time.  By the habit of early\nrising I always secured a sacred portion of the day, and many\nscattered moments were stolen and employed by my studious industry.\nBut the family hours of breakfast, of dinner, of tea, and of supper,\nwere regular and long: after breakfast Mrs. Gibbon expected my\ncompany in her dressing-room; after tea my father claimed my\nconversation and the perusal of the newspapers; and in the midst of\nan interesting work I was often called down to receive the visit of\nsome idle neighbours.  Their dinners and visits required, in due\nseason, a similar return; and I dreaded the period of the full moon,\nwhich was usually reserved for our more distant excursions.  I could\nnot refuse attending my father, in the summer of 1759, to the races\nat Stockbridge, Reading, and Odiam, where he had entered a horse for\nthe hunter's plate; and I was not displeased with the sight of our\nOlympic games, the beauty of the spot, the fleetness of the horses,\nand the gay tumult of the numerous spectators.  As soon as the\nmilitia business was agitated, many days were tediously consumed in\nmeetings of deputy-lieutenants at Petersfield, Alton, and\nWinchester.  In the close of the same year, 1759, Sir Simeon (then\nMr.) Stewart attempted an unsuccessful contest for the county of\nSouthampton, against Mr. Legge, Chancellor of the Exchequer: a\nwell-known contest, in which Lord Bute's influence was first exerted\nand censured.  Our canvas at Portsmouth and Gosport lasted several\ndays; but the interruption of my studies was compensated in some\ndegree by the spectacle of English manners, and the acquisition of\nsome practical knowledge.\n\nIf in a more domestic or more dissipated scene my application was\nsomewhat relaxed, the love of knowledge was inflamed and gratified\nby the command of books; and I compared the poverty of Lausanne with\nthe plenty of London.  My father's study at Buriton was stuffed with\nmuch trash of the last age, with much high church divinity and\npolitics, which have long since gone to their proper place: yet it\ncontained some valuable editions of the classics and the fathers,\nthe choice, as it should seem, of Mr. Law; and many English\npublications of the times had been occasionally added.  From this\nslender beginning I have gradually formed a numerous and select\nlibrary, the foundation of my works, and the best comfort of my\nlife, both at home and abroad.  On the receipt of the first quarter,\na large share of my allowance was appropriated to my literary wants.\nI cannot forget the joy with which I exchanged a bank-note of twenty\npounds for the twenty volumes of the Memoirs of the Academy of\nInscriptions; nor would it have been easy, by any other expenditure\nof the same sum, to have procured so large and lasting a fund of\nrational amusement.  At a time when I most assiduously frequented\nthis school of ancient literature, I thus expressed my opinion of a\nlearned and various collection, which since the year 1759 has been\ndoubled in magnitude, though not in merit--\"Une de ces societes, qui\nont mieux immortalise Louis XIV. qu un ambition souvent pernicieuse\naux hommes, commengoit deja ces recherches qui reunissent la\njustesse de l'esprit, l'amenete & l'eruditlon: ou l'on voit iant des\ndecouvertes, et quelquefois, ce qui ne cede qu'a peine aux\ndecouvertes, une ignorance modeste et savante.\" The review of my\nlibrary must be reserved for the period of its maturity; but in this\nplace I may allow myself to observe, that I am not conscious of\nhaving ever bought a book from a motive of ostentation, that every\nvolume, before it was deposited on the shelf, was either read or\nsufficiently examined, and that I soon adopted the tolerating maxim\nof the elder Pliny, \"nullum esse librum tam malum ut non ex aliqua\nparte prodesset.\" I could not yet find leisure or courage to renew\nthe pursuit of the Greek language, excepting by reading the lessons\nof the Old and New Testament every Sunday, when I attended the\nfamily to church.  The series of my Latin authors was less\nstrenuously completed; but the acquisition, by inheritance or\npurchase, of the best editions of Cicero, Quintilian, Livy, Tacitus,\nOvid, &c. afforded a fair prospect, which I seldom neglected.  I\npersevered in the useful method of abstracts and observations; and a\nsingle example may suffice, of a note which had almost swelled into\na work.  The solution of a passage of Livy (xxxviii. 38,) involved\nme in the dry and dark treatises of Greaves, Arbuthnot, Hooper,\nBernard, Eisenschmidt, Gronovius, La Barre, Freret, &c.; and in my\nFrench essay (chap. 20,) I ridiculously send the reader to my own\nmanuscript remarks on the weights, coins, and measures of the\nancients, which were abruptly terminated by the militia drum.\n\nAs I am now entering on a more ample field of society and study, I\ncan only hope to avoid a vain and prolix garrulity, by overlooking\nthe vulgar crowd of my acquaintance, and confining myself to such\nintimate friends among books and men, as are best entitled to my\nnotice by their own merit and reputation, or by the deep impression\nwhich they have left on my mind.  Yet I will embrace this occasion\nof recommending to the young student a practice, which about this\ntime I myself adopted.  After glancing my eye over the design and\norder of a new book, I suspended the perusal till I had finished the\ntask of self examination, till I had revolved, in a solitary walk,\nall that I knew or believed, or had thought on the subject of the\nwhole work, or of some particular chapter: I was then qualified to\ndiscern how much the author added to my original stock; and I was\nsometimes satisfied by the agreement, I was sometimes armed by the\nopposition of our ideas.  The favourite companions of my leisure\nwere our English writers since the Revolution: they breathe the\nspirit of reason and liberty; and they most seasonably contributed\nto restore the purity of my own language, which had been corrupted\nby the long use of a foreign idiom.  By the judicious advice of Mr.\nMallet, I was directed to the writings of Swift and Addison; wit and\nsimplicity are their common attributes: but the style of Swift is\nsupported by manly original vigour; that of Addison is adorned by\nthe female graces of elegance and mildness.  The old reproach, that\nno British altars had been raised to the muse of history, was\nrecently disproved by the first performances of Robertson and Hume,\nthe histories of Scotland and of the Stuarts.  I will assume the\npresumption of saying, that I was not unworthy to read them: nor\nwill I disguise my different feelings in the repeated perusals.  The\nperfect composition, the nervous language, the well-turned periods\nof Dr. Robertson, inflamed me to the ambitious hope that I might one\nday tread in his footsteps: the calm philosophy, the careless,\ninimitable beauties of his friend and rival, often forced me to\nclose the volume with a mixed sensation of delight and despair.\n\nThe design of my first work, the Essay on the Study of Literature,\nwas suggested by a refinement of vanity, the desire of justifying\nand praising the object of a favourite pursuit.  In France, to which\nmy ideas were confined, the learning and language of Greece and Rome\nwere neglected by a philosophic age.  The guardian of those studies,\nthe Academy of Inscriptions, was degraded to the lowest rank among\nthe three royal societies of Paris: the new appellation of Erudits\nwas contemptuously applied to the successors of Lipsius and\nCasaubon; and I was provoked to hear (see M. d'Alembert Discours\npreliminaire a l'Encyclopedie) that the exercise of the memory,\ntheir sole merit, had been superseded by the nobler faculties of the\nimagination and the judgment.  I was ambitious of proving by my own\nexample, as well as by my precepts, that all the faculties of the\nmind may be exercised and displayed by the study of ancient\nliterature: I began to select and adorn the various proofs and\nillustrations which had offered themselves in reading the classics;\nand the first pages or chapters of my essay were composed before my\ndeparture from Lausanne.  The hurry of the journey, and of the first\nweeks of my English life, suspended all thoughts of serious\napplication: but my object was ever before my eyes; and no more than\nten days, from the first to the eleventh of July, were suffered to\nelapse after my summer establishment at Buriton.  My essay was\nfinished in about six weeks; and as soon as a fair copy had been\ntranscribed by one of the French prisoners at Petersfield, I looked\nround for a critic and judge of my first performance.  A writer can\nseldom be content with the doubtful recompense of solitary\napprobation; but a youth ignorant of the world, and of himself, must\ndesire to weigh his talents in some scales less partial than his\nown: my conduct was natural, my motive laudable, my choice of Dr.\nMaty judicious and fortunate.  By descent and education Dr. Maty,\nthough born in Holland, might be considered as a Frenchman; but he\nwas fixed in London by the practice of physic, and an office in the\nBritish Museum.  His reputation was justly founded on the eighteen\nvolumes of the Journal Britannique, which he had supported, almost\nalone, with perseverance and success.  This humble though useful\nlabour, which had once been dignified by the genius of Bayle and the\nlearning of Le Clerc, was not disgraced by the taste, the knowledge,\nand the judgment of Maty: he exhibits a candid and pleasing view of\nthe state of literature in England during a period of six years\n(January 1750--December 1755); and, far different from his angry\nson, he handles the rod of criticism with the tenderness and\nreluctance of a parent.  The author of the Journal Britannique\nsometimes aspires to the character of a poet and philosopher: his\nstyle is pure and elegant; and in his virtues, or even in his\ndefects, he may be ranked as one of the last disciples of the school\nof Fontenelle.  His answer to my first letter was prompt and polite:\nafter a careful examination he returned my manuscript, with some\nanimadversion and much applause; and when I visited London in the\nensuing winter, we discussed the design and execution in several\nfree and familiar conversations.  In a short excursion to Buriton I\nreviewed my essay, according to his friendly advice; and after\nsuppressing a third, adding a third, and altering a third, I\nconsummated my first labour by a short preface, which is dated Feb.\n3, 1759.  Yet I still shrunk from the press with the terrors of\nvirgin modesty: the manuscript was safely deposited in my desk; and\nas my attention was engaged by new objects, the delay might have\nbeen prolonged till I had fulfilled the precept of Horace, \"nonumque\nprematur in annum.\" Father Sirmond, a learned jesuit, was still more\nrigid, since he advised a young friend to expect the mature age of\nfifty, before he gave himself or his writings to the public (Olivet\nHist. de l'Acad. Francoise, tom. ii. p. 143).  The counsel was\nsingular; but it is still more singular that it should have been\napproved by the example of the author. Sirmond was himself\nfifty-five years of age when he published (in 1614) his first work,\nan edition of Sidonius Apollinaris, with many valuable annotations:\n(see his life, before the great edition of his works in five volumes\nfolio, Paris, 1696, e Typographia Regia).\n\nTwo years elapsed in silence: but in the spring of 1761 I yielded to\nthe authority of a parent, and complied, like a pious son, with the\nwish of my own heart.  My private resolves were influenced by the\nstate of Europe.  About this time the belligerent powers had made\nand accepted overtures of peace; our English plenipotentiaries were\nnamed to assist at the Congress of Augsburg, which never met: I\nwished to attend them as a gentleman or a secretary; and my father\nfondly believed that the proof of some literary talents might\nintroduce me to public notice, and second the recommendations of my\nfriends.  After a last revisal I consulted with Mr. Mallet and Dr.\nMaty, who approved the design and promoted the execution.  Mr.\nMallet, after hearing me read my manuscript, received it from my\nhands, and delivered it into those of Becket, with whom he made an\nagreement in my name; an easy agreement: I required only a certain\nnumber of copies; and, without transferring my property, I devolved\non the bookseller the charges and profits of the edition.  Dr. Maty\nundertook, in my absence, to correct the sheets: he inserted,\nwithout my knowledge, an elegant and flattering epistle to the\nauthor; which is composed, however, with so much art, that, in case\nof a defeat, his favourable report might have been ascribed to the\nindulgence of a friend for the rash attempt of a young English\ngentleman.  The work was printed and published, under the title of\nEssai sur l'Etude de la Litterature, a Londres, chez T. Becket et P.\nA. de Hondt, 1761, in a small volume in duodecimo: my dedication to\nmy father, a proper and pious address, was composed the\ntwenty-eighth of May: Dr. Maty's letter is dated June 16; and I\nreceived the first copy (June 23) at Alresford, two days before I\nmarched with the Hampshire militia.  Some weeks afterwards, on the\nsame ground, I presented my book to the late Duke of York, who\nbreakfasted in Colonel Pitt's tent.  By my father's direction, and\nMallet's advice, many literary gifts were distributed to several\neminent characters in England and France; two books were sent to the\nCount de Caylus, and the Duchesse d'Aiguillon, at Paris: I had\nreserved twenty copies for my friends at Lausanne, as the first\nfruits of my education, and a grateful token of my remembrance: and\non all these persons I levied an unavoidable tax of civility and\ncompliment.  It is not surprising that a work, of which the style\nand sentiments were so totally foreign, should have been more\nsuccessful abroad than at home.  I was delighted by the copious\nextracts, the warm commendations, and the flattering predictions of\nthe journals of France and Holland: and the next year (1762) a new\nedition (I believe at Geneva) extended the fame, or at least the\ncirculation, of the work.  In England it was received with cold\nindifference, little read, and speedily forgotten: a small\nimpression was slowly dispersed; the bookseller murmured, and the\nauthor (had his feelings been more exquisite) might have wept over\nthe blunders and baldness of the English translation.  The\npublication of my History fifteen years afterwards revived the\nmemory of my first performance, and the Essay was eagerly sought in\nthe shops.  But I refused the permission which Becket solicited of\nreprinting it: the public curiosity was imperfectly satisfied by a\npirated copy of the booksellers of Dublin; and when a copy of the\noriginal edition has been discovered in a sale, the primitive value\nof half-a-crown has risen to the fanciful price of a guinea or\nthirty shillings.\n\nI have expatiated on the petty circumstances and period of my first\npublication, a memorable aera in the life of a student, when he\nventures to reveal the measure of his mind: his hopes and fears are\nmultiplied by the idea of self-importance, and he believes for a\nwhile that the eyes of mankind are fixed on his person and\nperformance.  Whatever may be my present reputation, it no longer\nrests on the merit of this first essay; and at the end of\ntwenty-eight years I may appreciate my juvenile work with the\nimpartiality, and almost with the indifference, of a stranger.  In\nhis answer to Lady Hervey, the Count de Caylus admires, or affects\nto admire, \"les livres sans nombre que Mr. Gibbon a lus et tres bien\nlus.\" But, alas! my stock of erudition at that time was scanty and\nsuperficial; and if I allow myself the liberty of naming the Greek\nmasters, my genuine and personal acquaintance was confined to the\nLatin classics.  The most serious defect of my Essay is a kind of\nobscurity and abruptness which always fatigues, and may often elude,\nthe attention of the reader.  Instead of a precise and proper\ndefinition of the title itself, the sense of the word Litterature is\nloosely and variously applied: a number of remarks and examples,\nhistorical, critical, philosophical, are heaped on each other\nwithout method or connection; and if we except some introductory\npages, all the remaining chapters might indifferently be reversed or\ntransposed. The obscure passages is often affected, brevis esse\nlaboro, obscurus fio; the desire of expressing perhaps a common idea\nwith sententious and oracular brevity: alas! how fatal has been the\nimitation of Montesquieu! But this obscurity sometimes proceeds from\na mixture of light and darkness in the author's mind; from a partial\nray which strikes upon an angle, instead of spreading itself over\nthe surface of an object.  After this fair confession I shall\npresume to say, that the Essay does credit to a young writer of two\nand twenty years of age, who had read with taste, who thinks with\nfreedom, and who writes in a foreign language with spirit and\nelegance.  The defence of the early History of Rome and the new\nChronology of Sir Isaac Newton form a specious argument.  The\npatriotic and political design of the Georgics is happily conceived;\nand any probable conjecture, which tends to raise the dignity of the\npoet and the poem, deserves to be adopted, without a rigid scrutiny.\nSome dawnings of a philosophic spirit enlighten the general remarks\non the study of history and of man.  I am not displeased with the\ninquiry into the origin and nature of the gods of polytheism, which\nmight deserve the illustration of a riper judgment.  Upon the whole,\nI may apply to the first labour of my pen the speech of a far\nsuperior artist, when he surveyed the first productions of his\npencil.  After viewing some portraits which he had painted in his\nyouth, my friend Sir Joshua Reynolds acknowledged to me, that he was\nrather humbled than flattered by the comparison with his present\nworks; and that after so much time and study, he had conceived his\nimprovement to be much greater than he found it to have been.\n\nAt Lausanne I composed the first chapters of my Essay in French, the\nfamiliar language of my conversation and studies, in which it was\neasier for me to write than in my mother tongue.  After my return to\nEngland I continued the same practice, without any affectation, or\ndesign of repudiating (as Dr. Bentley would say) my vernacular\nidiom.  But I should have escaped some Anti-gallican clamour, had I\nbeen content with the more natural character of an English author.\nI should have been more consistent had I rejected Mallet's advice,\nof prefixing an English dedication to a French book; a confusion of\ntongues that seemed to accuse the ignorance of my patron.  The use\nof a foreign dialect might be excused by the hope of being employed\nas a negociator, by the desire of being generally understood on the\ncontinent; but my true motive was doubtless the ambition of new and\nsingular fame, an Englishman claiming a place among the writers of\nFrance.  The latin tongue had been consecrated by the service of the\nchurch, it was refined by the imitation of the ancients; and in the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries the scholars of Europe enjoyed the\nadvantage, which they have gradually resigned, of conversing and\nwriting in a common and learned idiom.  As that idiom was no longer\nin any country the vulgar speech, they all stood on a level with\neach other; yet a citizen of old Rome might have smiled at the best\nLatinity of the Germans and Britons; and we may learn from the\nCiceronianus of Erasmus, how difficult it was found to steer a\nmiddle course between pedantry and barbarism.  The Romans themselves\nhad sometimes attempted a more perilous task, of writing in a living\nlanguage, and appealing to the taste and judgment of the natives.\nThe vanity of Tully was doubly interested in the Greek memoirs of\nhis own consulship; and if he modestly supposes that some Latinisms\nmight be detected in his style, he is confident of his own skill in\nthe art of Isocrates and Aristotle; and he requests his friend\nAtticus to disperse the copies of his work at Athens, and in the\nother cities of Greece, (Ad Atticum, i. 19. ii. i.) But it must not\nbe forgotten, that from infancy to manhood Cicero and his\ncontemporaries had read and declaimed, and composed with equal\ndiligence in both languages; and that he was not allowed to frequent\na Latin school till he had imbibed the lessons of the Greek\ngrammarians and rhetoricians.  In modern times, the language of\nFrance has been diffused by the merit of her writers, the social\nmanners of the natives, the influence of the monarchy, and the exile\nof the protestants.  Several foreigners have seized the opportunity\nof speaking to Europe in this common dialect, and Germany may plead\nthe authority of Leibnitz and Frederick, of the first of her\nphilosophers, and the greatest of her kings.  The just pride and\nlaudable prejudice of England has restrained this communication of\nidioms; and of all the nations on this side of the Alps, my\nCountrymen are the least practised, and least perfect in the\nexercise of the French tongue.  By Sir William Temple and Lord\nChesterfield it was only used on occasions of civility and business,\nand their printed letters will not be quoted as models of\ncomposition.  Lord Bolingbroke may have published in French a sketch\nof his Reflections on Exile: but his reputation now reposes on the\naddress of Voltaire, \"Docte sermones utriusque linguae;\" and by his\nEnglish dedication to Queen Caroline, and his Essay on Epic Poetry,\nit should seem that Voltaire himself wished to deserve a return of\nthe same compliment.  The exception of Count Hamilton cannot fairly\nbe urged; though an Irishman by birth, he was educated in France\nfrom his childhood.  Yet I am surprised that a long residence in\nEngland, and the habits of domestic conversation, did not affect the\nease and purity of his inimitable style; and I regret the omission\nof his English verses, which might have afforded an amusing object\nof comparison.  I might therefore assume the primus ego in patriam,\n&c.; but with what success I have explored this untrodden path must\nbe left to the decision of my French readers.  Dr. Maty, who might\nhimself be questioned as a foreigner, has secured his retreat at my\nexpense.  \"Je ne crois pas que vous vous piquiez d'etre moins facile\na reconnoitre pour un Anglois que Lucullus pour un Romain.\"  My\nfriends at Paris have been more indulgent, they received me as a\ncountryman, or at least as a provincial; but they were friends and\nParisians.  The defects which Maty insinuates, \"Ces traits saillans,\nces figures hardies, ce sacrifice de la regle au sentiment, et de la\ncadence a la force,\" are the faults of the youth, rather than of the\nstranger: and after the long and laborious exercise of my own\nlanguage, I am conscious that my French style has been ripened and\nimproved.\n\nI have already hinted, that the publication of my essay was delayed\ntill I had embraced the military profession.  I shall now amuse\nmyself with the recollection of an active scene, which bears no\naffinity to any other period of my studious and social life.\n\nIn the outset of a glorious war, the English people had been\ndefended by the aid of German mercenaries.  A national militia has\nbeen the cry of every patriot since the Revolution; and this\nmeasure, both in parliament and in the field, was supported by the\ncountry gentlemen or Tories, who insensibly transferred their\nloyalty to the house of Hanover: in the language of Mr. Burke, they\nhave changed the idol, but they have preserved the idolatry.  In the\nact of offering our names and receiving our commissions, as major\nand captain in the Hampshire regiment, (June 12, 1759,) we had not\nsupposed that we should be dragged away, my father from his farm,\nmyself from my books, and condemned, during two years and a half,\n(May 10, 1760--December 23, 1762,) to a wandering life of military\nservitude.  But a weekly or monthly exercise of thirty thousand\nprovincials would have left them useless and ridiculous; and after\nthe pretence of an invasion had vanished, the popularity of Mr. Pitt\ngave a sanction to the illegal step of keeping them till the end of\nthe war under arms, in constant pay and duty, and at a distance from\ntheir respective homes.  When the King's order for our embodying\ncame down, it was too late to retreat, and too soon to repent.  The\nSouth battalion of the Hampshire militia was a small independent\ncorps of four hundred and seventy-six, officers and men, commanded\nby lieutenant-colonel Sir Thomas Worsley, who, after a prolix and\npassionate contest, delivered us from the tyranny of the lord\nlieutenant, the Duke of Bolton.  My proper station, as first\ncaptain, was at the head of my own, and afterwards of the grenadier,\ncompany; but in the absence, or even in the presence, of the two\nfield officers, I was entrusted by my friend and my father with the\neffective labour of dictating the orders, and exercising the\nbattalion.  With the help of an original journal, I could write the\nhistory of my bloodless and inglorious campaigns; but as these\nevents have lost much of their importance in my own eyes, they shall\nbe dispatched in a few words.  From Winchester, the first place of\nassembly, (June 4, 1760,) we were removed, at our own request, for\nthe benefit of a foreign education.  By the arbitrary, and often\ncapricious, orders of the War-office, the battalion successively\nmarched to the pleasant and hospitable Blandford (June 17); to\nHilsea barracks, a seat of disease and discord (Sept. 1); to\nCranbrook in the weald of Kent (Dec. 11); to the sea-coast of Dover\n(Dec. 27); to Winchester camp (June 25, 1761); to the populous and\ndisorderly town of Devizes (Oct. 23); to Salisbury (Feb. 28, 1762);\nto our beloved Blandford a second time (March 9); and finally, to\nthe fashionable resort of Southampton (June 2); where the colours\nwere fixed till our final dissolution. (Dec. 23).  On the beach at\nDover we had exercised in sight of the Gallic shores.  But the most\nsplendid and useful scene of our life was a four months' encampment\non Winchester Down, under the command of the Earl of Effingham.  Our\narmy consisted of the thirty-fourth regiment of foot and six militia\ncorps.  The consciousness of our defects was stimulated by friendly\nemulation.  We improved our time and opportunities in morning and\nevening field-days; and in the general reviews the South Hampshire\nwere rather a credit than a disgrace to the line.  In our subsequent\nquarters of the Devizes and Blandford, we advanced with a quick step\nin our military studies; the ballot of the ensuing summer renewed\nour vigour and youth; and had the militia subsisted another year, we\nmight have contested the prize with the most perfect of our\nbrethren.\n\nThe loss of so many busy and idle hours was not compensated by any\nelegant pleasure; and my temper was insensibly soured by the society\nof out rustic officers.  In every state there exists, however, a\nbalance of good and evil.  The habits of a sedentary life were\nusefully broken by the duties of an active profession: in the\nhealthful exercise of the field I hunted with a battalion, instead\nof a pack; and at that time I was ready, at any hour of the day or\nnight, to fly from quarters to London, from London to quarters, on\nthe slightest call of private or regimental business.  But my\nprincipal obligation to the militia, was the making me an\nEnglishman, and a soldier.  After my foreign education, with my\nreserved temper, I should long have continued a stranger in my\nnative country, had I not been shaken in this various scene of new\nfaces and new friends: had not experience forced me to feel the\ncharacters of our leading men, the state of parties, the forms of\noffice, and the operation of our civil and military system.  In this\npeaceful service I imbibed the rudiments of the language, and\nscience of tactics, which opened a new field of study and\nobservation.  I diligently read, and meditated, the Memoires\nMilitaires of Quintus Icilius, (Mr. Guichardt,) the only writer who\nhas united the merits of a professor and a veteran.  The discipline\nand evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the\nphalanx and the legion; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers\n(the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the\nRoman empire.\n\nA youth of any spirit is fired even by the play of arms, and in the\nfirst sallies of my enthusiasm I had seriously attempted to embrace\nthe regular profession of a soldier.  But this military fever was\ncooled by the enjoyment of our mimic Bellona, who soon unveiled to\nmy eyes her naked deformity.  How often did I sigh for my proper\nstation in society and letters.  How often (a proud comparison) did\nI repeat the complaint of Cicero in the command of a provincial\narmy: \"Clitellae bovi sunt impositae.   Est incredibile quam me\nnegotii taedeat.  Non habet satis magnum campum ille tibi non\nignotus cursus animi; et industriae meae praeclara opera cessat.\nLucem, libros, urbem, domum, vos desidero.  Sed feram, ut potero;\nsit modo annuum.  Si prorogatur, actum est.\"--Epist. ad Atticum,\nlib. v. 15.  From a service without danger I might indeed have\nretired without disgrace; but as often as I hinted a wish of\nresigning, my fetters were riveted by the friendly intreaties of the\ncolonel, the parental authority of the major, and my own regard for\nthe honour and welfare of the battalion.  When I felt that my\npersonal escape was impracticable, I bowed my neck to the yoke: my\nservitude was protracted far beyond the annual patience of Cicero;\nand it was not till after the preliminaries of peace that I received\nmy discharge, from the act of government which disembodied the\nmilitia.\n\nWhen I complain of the loss of time, justice to myself and to the\nmilitia must throw the greatest part of that reproach on the first\nseven or eight months, while I was obliged to learn as well as to\nteach.  The dissipation of Blandford, and the disputes of\nPortsmouth, consumed the hours which were not employed in the field;\nand amid the perpetual hurry of an inn, a barrack, or a guard-room,\nall literary ideas were banished from my mind.  After this long\nfast, the longest which I have ever known, I once more tasted at\nDover the pleasures of reading and thinking; and the hungry appetite\nwith which I opened a volume of Tully's philosophical works is still\npresent to my memory.  The last review of my Essay before its\npublication, had prompted me to investigate the nature of the gods;\nmy inquiries led me to the Historie Critique du Manicheisme of\nBeausobre, who discusses many deep questions of Pagan and Christian\ntheology: and from this rich treasury of facts and opinions, I\ndeduced my own consequences, beyond the holy circle of the author.\nAfter this recovery I never relapsed into indolence; and my example\nmight prove, that in the life most averse to study, some hours may\nbe stolen, some minutes may be snatched.  Amidst the tumult of\nWinchester camp I sometimes thought and read in my tent; in the more\nsettled quarters of the Devizes, Blandford, and Southampton, I\nalways secured a separate lodging, and the necessary books; and in\nthe summer of 1762, while the new militia was raising, I enjoyed at\nBuriton two or three months of literary repose.  In forming a new\nplan of study, I hesitated between the mathematics and the Greek\nlanguage; both of which I had neglected since my return from\nLausanne.  I consulted a learned and friendly mathematician, Mr.\nGeorge Scott, a pupil of de Moivre; and his map of a country which I\nhave never explored, may perhaps be more serviceable to others.  As\nsoon as I had given the preference to Greek, the example of Scaliger\nand my own reason determined me on the choice of Homer, the father\nof poetry, and the Bible of the ancients: but Scaliger ran through\nthe Iliad in one and twenty days; and I was not dissatisfied with my\nown diligence for performing the same labour in an equal number of\nweeks.  After the first difficulties were surmounted, the language\nof nature and harmony soon became easy and familiar, and each day I\nsailed upon the ocean with a brisker gale and a more steady course.\n\n     {Passage in Greek}\n\n     Ilias, A 481.\n\n    --Fair wind, and blowing fresh,\n    Apollo sent them; quick they rear'd the mast,\n    Then spread th'unsullied canvas to the gale,\n    And the wind fill'd it.  Roar'd the sable flood\n    Around the bark, that ever as she went\n    Dash'd wide the brine, and scudded swift away.\n    COWPER'S Homer.\n\nIn the study of a poet who has since become the most intimate of my\nfriends, I successively applied many passages and fragments of Greek\nwriters; and among these I shall notice a life of Homer, in the\nOposcula Mythologica of Gale, several books of the geography of\nStrabo, and the entire treatise of Longinus, which, from the title\nand the style, is equally worthy of the epithet of sublime.  My\ngrammatical skill was improved, my vocabulary was enlarged; and in\nthe militia I acquired a just and indelible knowledge of the first\nof languages.  On every march, in every journey, Horace was always\nin my pocket, and often in my hand: but I should not mention his two\ncritical epistles, the amusement of a morning, had they not been\naccompanied by the elaborate commentary of Dr. Hurd, now Bishop of\nWorcester.  On the interesting subjects of composition and imitation\nof epic and dramatic poetry, I presumed to think for myself; and\nthirty close-written pages in folio could scarcely comprise my full\nand free discussion of the sense of the master and the pedantry of\nthe servant.\n\nAfter his oracle Dr. Johnson, my friend Sir Joshua Reynolds denies\nall original genius, any natural propensity of the mind to one art\nor science rather than another.  Without engaging in a metaphysical\nor rather verbal dispute, I know, by experience, that from my early\nyouth I aspired to the character of an historian.  While I served in\nthe militia, before and after the publication of my essay, this idea\nripened in my mind; nor can I paint in more lively colours the\nfeelings of the moment, than by transcribing some passages, under\ntheir respective dates, from a journal which I kept at that time.\nBeriton, April 14, 1761.  (In a short excursion from Dover.)--\n\n\"Having thought of several subjects for an historical composition, I\nchose the expedition of Charles VIII. of France into Italy.  I read\ntwo memoirs of Mr. de Foncemagne in the Academy of Inscriptions\n(tom. xvii. p. 539-607.), and abstracted them.  I likewise finished\nthis day a dissertation, in which I examine the right of Charles\nVIII. to the crown of Naples, and the rival claims of the House of\nAnjou and Arragon: it consists of ten folio pages, besides large\nnotes.\"\n\nBeriton, August 4, 1761.  (In a week's excursion from Winchester\ncamp.)--\"After having long revolved subjects for my intended\nhistorical essay, I renounced my first thought of the expedition of\nCharles VIII. as too remote from us, and rather an introduction to\ngreat events, than great and important in itself.  I successively\nchose and rejected the crusade of Richard the First, the barons'\nwars against John and Henry the Third, the History of Edward the\nBlack Prince, the lives and comparisons of Henry V. and the Emperor\nTitus, the life of Sir Philip Sidney, and that of the Marquis of\nMontrose.  At length I have fixed on Sir Walter Raleigh for my hero.\nHis eventful story is varied by the characters of the soldier and\nsailor, the courtier and historian; and it may afford such a fund of\nmaterials as I desire, which have not yet been properly\nmanufactured.  At present I cannot attempt the execution of this\nwork.  Free leisure, and the opportunity of consulting many books,\nboth printed and manuscript, are as necessary as they are impossible\nto be attained in my present way of life.  However, to acquire a\ngeneral insight into my subject and resources, I read the life of\nSir Walter Raleigh by Dr. Birch, his copious article in the General\nDictionary by the same hand, and the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and\nJames the First in Hume's History of England.\"\n\nBeriton, January 1762.  (In a month's absence from the Devizes.)--\n\n\"During this interval of repose, I again turned my thoughts to Sir\nWalter Raleigh, and looked more closely into my materials.  I read\nthe two volumes in quarto of the Bacon Papers, published by Dr.\nBirch; the Fragmenta Regalia of Sir Robert Naunton, Mallet's Life of\nLord Bacon, and the political treatises of that great man in the\nfirst volume of his works, with many of his letters in the second;\nSir William Monson's Naval Tracts, and the elaborate life of Sir\nWalter Raleigh, which Mr. Oldys has prefixed to the best edition of\nhis History of the World.  My subject opens upon me, and in general\nimproves upon a nearer prospect.\"\n\nBeriton, July 26, 1762.  (During my summer residence.)--\"I am afraid\nof being reduced to drop my hero; but my time has not, however, been\nlost in the research of his story, and of a memorable aera of our\nEnglish annals.  The life of Sir Walter Raleigh, by Oldys, is a very\npoor performance; a servile panegyric, or flat apology, tediously\nminute, and composed in a dull and affected style.  Yet the author\nwas a man of diligence and learning, who had read everything\nrelative to his subject, and whose ample collections are arranged\nwith perspicuity and method.  Excepting some anecdotes lately\nrevealed in the Sidney and Bacon Papers, I know not what I should be\nable to add.  My ambition (exclusive of the uncertain merit of style\nand sentiment) must be confined to the hope of giving a good\nabridgment of Oldys.  I have even the disappointment of finding some\nparts of this copious work very dry and barren; and these parts are\nunluckily some of the most characteristic: Raleigh's colony of\nVirginia, his quarrels with Essex, the true secret of his\nconspiracy, and, above all, the detail of his private life, the most\nessential and important to a biographer.  My best resource would be\nin the circumjacent history of the times, and perhaps in some\ndigressions artfully introduced, like the fortunes of the\nPeripatetic philosophy in the portrait of Lord Bacon.  But the\nreigns of Elizabeth and James the First are the periods of English\nhistory, which have been the most variously illustrated: and what\nnew lights could I reflect on a subject, which has exercised the\naccurate industry of Birch, the lively and curious acuteness of\nWalpole, the critical spirit of Hurd, the vigorous sense of Mallet\nand Robertson, and the impartial philosophy of Hume? Could I even\nsurmount these obstacles, I should shrink with terror from the\nmodern history of England, where every character is a problem, and\nevery reader a friend or an enemy; where a writer is supposed to\nhoist a flag of party, and is devoted to damnation by the adverse\nfaction.  Such would be my reception at home: and abroad, the\nhistorian of Raleigh must encounter an indifference far more bitter\nthan censure or reproach.  The events of his life are interesting:\nbut his character is ambiguous, his actions are obscure, his\nwritings are English, and his fame is confined to the narrow limits\nof our language and our island.  I must embrace a safer and more\nextensive theme.\n\n\"There is one which I should prefer to all others, The History of\nthe Liberty of the Swiss, of that independence which a brave people\nrescued from the House of Austria, defended against a Dauphin of\nFrance, and finally sealed with the blood of Charles of Burgundy.\nFrom such a theme, so full of public spirit, of military glory, of\nexamples of virtue, of lessons of government, the dullest stranger\nwould catch fire; what might not I hope, whose talents, whatsoever\nthey may be, would be inflamed with the zeal of patriotism.  But the\nmaterials of this history are inaccessible to me, fast locked in the\nobscurity of an old barbarous German dialect, of which I am totally\nignorant, and which I cannot resolve to learn for this sole and\npeculiar purpose.\n\n\"I have another subject in view, which is the contrast of the former\nhistory: the one a poor, warlike, virtuous republic, which emerges\ninto glory and freedom; the other a commonwealth, soft, opulent, and\ncorrupt; which, by just degrees, is precipitated from the abuse to\nthe loss of her liberty: both lessons are, perhaps, equally\ninstructive.  This second subject is, The History of the Republic of\nFlorence under the House of Medicis: a period of one hundred and\nfifty years, which rises or descends from the dregs of the\nFlorentine democracy, to the title and dominion of Cosmo de Medicis\nin the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.  I might deduce a chain of\nrevolutions not unworthy of the pen of Vertot; singular men, and\nsingular events; the Medicis four times expelled, and as often\nrecalled; and the Genius of Freedom reluctantly yielding to the arms\nof Charles V. and the policy of Cosmo.  The character and fate of\nSavanerola, and the revival of arts and letters in Italy, will be\nessentially connected with the elevation of the family and the fall\nof the republic.  The Medicis (stirps quasi fataliter nata ad\ninstauranda vel fovenda studia (Lipsius ad Germanos et Galles,\nEpist. viii.)) were illustrated by the patronage of learning; and\nenthusiasm was the most formidable weapon of their adversaries.  On\nthis splendid subject I shall most probably fix; but when, or where,\nor how will it be executed? I behold in a dark and doubtful\nperspective.\"\n\n     Res alta terra, et caligine mersas.\n\nThe youthful habits of the language and manners of France had left\nin my mind an ardent desire of revisiting the Continent on a larger\nand more liberal plan.  According to the law of custom, and perhaps\nof reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English\ngentleman: my father had consented to my wish, but I was detained\nabove four years by my rash engagement in the militia.  I eagerly\ngrasped the first moments of freedom: three or four weeks in\nHampshire and London were employed in the preparations of my\njourney, and the farewell visits of friendship and civility: my last\nact in town was to applaud Mallet's new tragedy of Elvira; a\npost-chaise conveyed me to Dover, the packet to Boulogne, and such\nwas my diligence, that I reached Paris on Jan. 28, 1763, only\nthirty-six days after the disbanding of the militia.  Two or three\nyears were loosely defined for the term of my absence; and I was\nleft at liberty to spend that time in such places and in such a\nmanner as was most agreeable to my taste and judgment.\n\nIn this first visit I passed three months and a half, (Jan. 28-May\n9,) and a much longer space might have been agreeably filled,\nwithout any intercourse with the natives.  At home we are content to\nmove in the daily round of pleasure and business; and a scene which\nis always present is supposed to be within our knowledge, or at\nleast within our power.  But in a foreign country, curiosity is our\nbusiness and our pleasure; and the traveller, conscious of his\nignorance, and covetous of his time, is diligent in the search and\nthe view of every object that can deserve his attention.  I devoted\nmany hours of the morning to the circuit of Paris and the\nneighbourhood, to the visit of churches and palaces conspicuous by\ntheir architecture, to the royal manufactures, collections of books\nand pictures, and all the various treasures of art, of learning, and\nof luxury.  An Englishman may hear without reluctance, that in these\ncurious and costly articles Paris is superior to London; since the\nopulence of the French capital arises from the defects of its\ngovernment and religion.  In the absence of Louis XIV. and his\nsuccessors, the Louvre has been left unfinished: but the millions\nwhich have been lavished on the sands of Versailles, and the morass\nof Marli, could not be supplied by the legal allowance of a British\nking.  The splendour of the French nobles is confined to their town\nresidence; that of the English is more usefully distributed in their\ncountry seats; and we should be astonished at our own riches, if the\nlabours of architecture, the spoils of Italy and Greece, which are\nnow scattered from Inverary to Wilton, were accumulated in a few\nstreets between Marylebone and Westminster.  All superfluous\nornament is rejected by the cold frugality of the protestants; but\nthe catholic superstition, which is always the enemy of reason, is\noften the parent of the arts.  The wealthy communities of priests\nand monks expend their revenues in stately edifices; and the parish\nchurch of St. Sulpice, one of the noblest structures in Paris, was\nbuilt and adorned by the private industry of a late cure.  In this\noutset, and still more in the sequel of my tour, my eye was amused;\nbut the pleasing vision cannot be fixed by the pen; the particular\nimages are darkly seen through the medium of five-and-twenty years,\nand the narrative of my life must not degenerate into a book of\ntravels.\n\nBut the principal end of my journey was to enjoy the society of a\npolished and amiable people, in whose favour I was strongly\nprejudiced, and to converse with some authors, whose conversation,\nas I fondly imagined, must be far more pleasing and instructive than\ntheir writings.  The moment was happily chosen.  At the close of a\nsuccessful war the British name was respected on the continent.\n\n                    Clarum et venerabile nomen\n               Gentibus.\n\nOur opinions, our fashions, even our games, were adopted in France,\na ray of national glory illuminated each individual, and every\nEnglishman was supposed to be born a patriot and a philosopher.  For\nmyself, I carried a personal recommendation; my name and my Essay\nwere already known; the compliment of having written in the French\nlanguage entitled me to some returns of civility and gratitude.  I\nwas considered as a man of letters, who wrote for amusement.  Before\nmy departure I had obtained from the Duke de Nivernois, Lady Hervey,\nthe Mallets, Mr. Walpole, &c. many letters of recommendation to\ntheir private or literary friends.  Of these epistles the reception\nand success were determined by the character and situation of the\npersons by whom and to whom they were addressed: the seed was\nsometimes cast on a barren rock, and it sometimes multiplied an\nhundred fold in the production of new shoots, spreading branches,\nand exquisite fruit.  But upon the whole, I had reason to praise the\nnational urbanity, which from the court has diffused its gentle\ninfluence to the shop, the cottage, and the schools.  Of the men of\ngenius of the age, Montesquieu and Fontenelle were no more; Voltaire\nresided on his own estate near Geneva; Rousseau in the preceding\nyear had been driven from his hermitage of Montmorency; and I blush\nat my having neglected to seek, in this journey, the acquaintance of\nBuffon.  Among the men of letters whom I saw, D'Alembert and Diderot\nheld the foremost rank in merit, or at least in fame.  I shall\ncontent myself with enumerating the well-known names of the Count de\nCaylus, of the Abbe de la Bleterie, Barthelemy, Reynal, Arnaud, of\nMessieurs de la Condamine, du Clos, de Ste Palaye, de Bougainville,\nCaperonnier, de Guignes, Suard, &c. without attempting to\ndiscriminate the shades of their characters, or the degrees of our\nconnection.  Alone, in a morning visit, I commonly found the artists\nand authors of Paris less vain, and more reasonable, than in the\ncircles of their equals, with whom they mingle in the houses of the\nrich.  Four days in a week, I had place, without invitation, at the\nhospitable tables of Mesdames Geoffrin and du Bocage, of the\ncelebrated Helvetius, and of the Baron d'Olbach.  In these symposia\nthe pleasures of the table were improved by lively and liberal\nconversation; the company was select, though various and voluntary.\n\nThe society of Madame du Bocage was more soft and moderate than that\nof her rivals, and the evening conversations of M. de Foncemagne\nwere supported by the good sense and learning of the principal\nmembers of the Academy of Inscriptions.  The opera and the Italians\nI occasionally visited; but the French theatre, both in tragedy and\ncomedy, was my daily and favourite amusement.  Two famous actresses\nthen divided the public applause.  For my own part, I preferred the\nconsummate art of the Claron, to the intemperate sallies of the\nDumesnil, which were extolled by her admirers, as the genuine voice\nof nature and passion.  Fourteen weeks insensibly stole away; but\nhad I been rich and independent, I should have prolonged, and\nperhaps have fixed, my residence at Paris.\n\nBetween the expensive style of Paris and of Italy it was prudent to\ninterpose some months of tranquil simplicity; and at the thoughts of\nLausanne I again lived in the pleasures and studies of my early\nyouth.  Shaping my course through Dijon and Besancon, in the last of\nwhich places I was kindly entertained by my cousin Acton, I arrived\nin the month of May 1763 on the banks of the Leman Lake.  It had\nbeen my intention to pass the Alps in the autumn, but such are the\nsimple attractions of the place, that the year had almost expired\nbefore my departure from Lausanne in the ensuing spring.  An absence\nof five years had not made much alteration in manners, or even in\npersons.  My old friends, of both sexes, hailed my voluntary return;\nthe most genuine proof of my attachment.  They had been flattered by\nthe present of my book, the produce of their soil; and the good\nPavilliard shed tears of joy as he embraced a pupil, whose literary\nmerit he might fairly impute to his own labours.  To my old list I\nadded some new acquaintance, and among the strangers I shall\ndistinguish Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg, the brother of the reigning\nDuke, at whose country-house, near Lausanne, I frequently dined: a\nwandering meteor, and at length a falling star, his light and\nambitious spirit had successively dropped from the firmament of\nPrussia, of France, and of Austria; and his faults, which he styled\nhis misfortunes, had driven him into philosophic exile in the Pays\nde Vaud.  He could now moralize on the vanity of the world, the\nequality of mankind, and the happiness of a private station.  His\naddress was affable and polite, and as he had shone in courts and\narmies, his memory could supply, and his eloquence could adorn, a\ncopious fund of interesting anecdotes.  His first enthusiasm was\nthat of charity and agriculture; but the sage gradually lapsed in\nthe saint, and Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg is now buried in a\nhermitage near Mayence, in the last stage of mystic devotion.  By\nsome ecclesiastical quarrel, Voltaire had been provoked to withdraw\nhimself from Lausanne, and retire to his castle at Ferney, where I\nagain visited the poet and the actor, without seeking his more\nintimate acquaintance, to which I might now have pleaded a better\ntitle.  But the theatre which he had founded, the actors whom he had\nformed, survived the loss of their master; and, recent from Paris, I\nattended with pleasure at the representation of several tragedies\nand comedies.  I shall not descend to specify particular names and\ncharacters; but I cannot forget a private institution, which will\ndisplay the innocent freedom of Swiss manners.  My favourite society\nhad assumed, from the age of its members, the proud denomination of\nthe spring (la society du printems).  It consisted of fifteen or\ntwenty young unmarried ladies, of genteel, though not of the very\nfirst families; the eldest perhaps about twenty, all agreeable,\nseveral handsome, and two or three of exquisite beauty.  At each\nother's houses they assembled almost every day, without the\ncontroul, or even the presence, of a mother or an aunt; they were\ntrusted to their own prudence, among a crowd of young men of every\nnation in Europe.  They laughed, they sung, they danced, they played\nat cards, they acted comedies; but in the midst of this careless\ngaiety, they respected themselves, and were respected by the men;\nthe invisible line between liberty and licentiousness was never\ntransgressed by a gesture, a word, or a look, and their virgin\nchastity was never sullied by the breath of scandal or suspicion.  A\nsingular institution, expressive of the innocent simplicity of Swiss\nmanners.  After having tasted the luxury of England and Paris, I\ncould not have returned with satisfaction to the coarse and homely\ntable of Madame Pavilliard; nor was her husband offended that I now\nentered myself as a pensionaire, or boarder, in the elegant house of\nMr. De Mesery, which may be entitled to a short remembrance, as it\nhas stood above twenty years, perhaps, without a parallel in Europe.\nThe house in which we lodged was spacious and convenient, in the\nbest street, and commanding, from behind, a noble prospect over the\ncountry and the Lake.  Our table was served with neatness and\nplenty; the boarders were select; we had the liberty of inviting any\nguests at a stated price; and in the summer the scene was\noccasionally transferred to a pleasant villa, about a league from\nLausanne.  The characters of Master and Mistress were happily suited\nto each other, and to their situation.  At the age of seventy-five,\nMadame de Mesery, who has survived her husband, is still a graceful,\nI had almost said, a handsome woman.  She was alike qualified to\npreside in her kitchen and her drawing-room; and such was the equal\npropriety of her conduct, that of two or three hundred foreigners,\nnone ever failed in respect, none could complain of her neglect, and\nnone could ever boast of her favour.  Mesery himself, of the noble\nfamily of De Crousaz, was a man of the world, a jovial companion,\nwhose easy manners and natural sallies maintained the cheerfulness\nof his house.  His wit could laugh at his own ignorance: he\ndisguised, by an air of profusion, a strict attention to his\ninterest; and in this situation he appeared like a nobleman who\nspent his fortune and entertained his friends.  In this agreeable\nsociety I resided nearly eleven months (May 1763--April 1764); and\nin this second visit to Lausanne, among a crowd of my English\ncompanions, I knew and esteemed Mr. Holroyd (now Lord Sheffield);\nand our mutual attachment was renewed and fortified in the\nsubsequent stages of our Italian journey.  Our lives are in the\npower of chance, and a slight variation on either side, in time or\nplace, might have deprived me of a friend, whose activity in the\nardour of youth was always prompted by a benevolent heart, and\ndirected by a strong understanding.\n\nIf my studies at Paris had been confined to the study of the world,\nthree or four months would not have been unprofitably spent.  My\nvisits, however superficial, to the Academy of Medals and the public\nlibraries, opened a new field of inquiry; and the view of so many\nmanuscripts of different ages and characters induced me to consult\nthe two great Benedictine works, the Diplomatica of Mabillon, and\nthe Palaeographia of Montfaucon.  I studied the theory without\nattaining the practice of the art: nor should I complain of the\nintricacy of Greek abbreviations and Gothic alphabets, since every\nday, in a familiar language, I am at a loss to decipher the\nhieroglyphics of a female note.  In a tranquil scene, which revived\nthe memory of my first studies, idleness would have been less\npardonable: the public libraries of Lausanne and Geneva liberally\nsupplied me with books; and if many hours were lost in dissipation,\nmany more were employed in literary labour.  In the country, Horace\nand Virgil, Juvenal and Ovid, were my assiduous companions but, in\ntown, I formed and executed a plan of study for the use of my\nTransalpine expedition: the topography of old Rome, the ancient\ngeography of Italy, and the science of medals.  1. I diligently\nread, almost always with my pen in my hand, the elaborate treatises\nof Nardini, Donatus, &c., which fill the fourth volume of the Roman\nAntiquities of Graevius.  2. I next undertook and finished the\nItalia Antiqua of Cluverius, a learned native of Prussia, who had\nmeasured, on foot, every spot, and has compiled and digested every\npassage of the ancient writers.  These passages in Greek or Latin\nauthors I perused in the text of Cluverius, in two folio volumes:\nbut I separately read the descriptions of Italy by Strabo, Pliny,\nand Pomponius Mela, the Catalogues of the Epic poets, the\nItineraries of Wesseling's Antoninus, and the coasting Voyage of\nRutilius Numatianus; and I studied two kindred subjects in the\nMeasures Itineraires of d'Anville, and the copious work of Bergier,\nHistoire des grands Chemins de I'Empire Romain.  From these\nmaterials I formed a table of roads and distances reduced to our\nEnglish measure; filled a folio common-place book with my\ncollections and remarks on the geography of Italy; and inserted in\nmy journal many long and learned notes on the insulae and\npopulousness of Rome, the social war, the passage of the Alps by\nHannibal, &c.  3. After glancing my eye over Addison's agreeable\ndialogues, I more seriously read the great work of Ezechiel Spanheim\nde Praestantia et Usu Numismatum, and applied with him the medals of\nthe kings and emperors, the families and colonies, to the\nillustration of ancient history.  And thus was I armed for my\nItalian journey.\n\nI shall advance with rapid brevity in the narrative of this tour, in\nwhich somewhat more than a year (April 1764-May 1765) was agreeably\nemployed.  Content with tracing my line of march, and slightly\ntouching on my personal feelings, I shall waive the minute\ninvestigation of the scenes which have been viewed by thousands, and\ndescribed by hundreds, of our modern travellers.  ROME is the great\nobject of our pilgrimage: and 1st, the journey; 2d, the residence;\nand 3d, the return; will form the most proper and perspicuous\ndivision.  1. I climbed Mount Cenis, and descended into the plain of\nPiedmont, not on the back of an elephant, but on a light osier seat,\nin the hands of the dextrous and intrepid chairmen of the Alps.  The\narchitecture and government of Turin presented the same aspect of\ntame and tiresome uniformity: but the court was regulated with\ndecent and splendid oeconomy; and I was introduced to his Sardinian\nmajesty Charles Emanuel, who, after the incomparable Frederic, held\nthe second rank (proximus longo tamen intervallo) among the kings of\nEurope.  The size and populousness of Milan could not surprise an\ninhabitant of London: but the fancy is amused by a visit to the\nBoromean Islands, an enchanted palace, a work of the fairies in the\nmidst of a lake encompassed with mountains, and far removed from the\nhaunts of men.  I was less amused by the marble palaces of Genoa,\nthan by the recent memorials of her deliverance (in December 1746)\nfrom the Austrian tyranny; and I took a military survey of every\nscene of action within the inclosure of her double walls.  My steps\nwere detained at Parma and Modena, by the precious relics of the\nFarnese and Este collections: but, alas! the far greater part had\nbeen already transported, by inheritance or purchase, to Naples and\nDresden.  By the road of Bologna and the Apennine I at last reached\nFlorence, where I reposed from June to September, during the heat of\nthe summer months.  In the Gallery, and especially in the Tribune, I\nfirst acknowledged, at the feet of the Venus of Medicis, that the\nchisel may dispute the pre-eminence with the pencil, a truth in the\nfine arts which cannot on this side of the Alps be felt or\nunderstood.  At home I had taken some lessons of Italian on the spot\nI read, with a learned native, the classics of the Tuscan idiom: but\nthe shortness of my time, and the use of the French language,\nprevented my acquiring any facility of speaking; and I was a silent\nspectator in the conversations of our envoy, Sir Horace Mann, whose\nmost serious business was that of entertaining the English at his\nhospitable table.  After leaving Florence, I compared the solitude\nof Pisa with the industry of Lucca and Leghorn, and continued my\njourney through Sienna to Rome, where I arrived in the beginning of\nOctober.  2. My temper is not very susceptible of enthusiasm; and\nthe enthusiasm which I do not feel, I have ever scorned to affect.\nBut, at the distance of twenty-five years, I can neither forget nor\nexpress the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first\napproached and entered the eternal city.  After a sleepless night, I\ntrod, with a lofty step, the ruins of the Forum; each memorable spot\nwhere Romulus stood, or Tully spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once\npresent to my eye; and several days of intoxication were lost or\nenjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation.\nMy guide was Mr. Byers, a Scotch antiquary of experience and taste;\nbut, in the daily labour of eighteen weeks, the powers of attention\nwere sometimes fatigued, till I was myself qualified, in a last\nreview, to select and study the capital works of ancient and modern\nart.  Six weeks were borrowed for my tour of Naples, the most\npopulous of cities, relative to its size, whose luxurious\ninhabitants seem to dwell on the confines of paradise and hell-fire.\nI was presented to the boy-king by our new envoy, Sir William\nHamilton; who, wisely diverting his correspondence from the\nSecretary of State to the Royal Society and British Museum, has\nelucidated a country of such inestimable value to the naturalist and\nantiquarian.  On my return, I fondly embraced, for the last time,\nthe miracles of Rome; but I departed without kissing the feet of\nRezzonico (Clement XIII.), who neither possessed the wit of his\npredecessor Lambertini, nor the virtues of his successor Ganganelli.\n3. In my pilgrimage from Rome to Loretto I again crossed the\nApennine; from the coast of the Adriatic I traversed a fruitful and\npopulous country, which could alone disprove the paradox of\nMontesquieu, that modern Italy is a desert.  Without adopting the\nexclusive prejudice of the natives, I sincerely admire the paintings\nof the Bologna school.  I hastened to escape from the sad solitude\nof Ferrara, which in the age of Caesar was still more desolate.  The\nspectacle of Venice afforded some hours of astonishment; the\nuniversity of Padua is a dying taper: but Verona still boasts her\namphitheatre, and his native Vicenza is adorned by the classic\narchitecture of Palladio: the road of Lombardy and Piedmont (did\nMontesquieu find them without inhabitants?) led me back to Milan,\nTurin, and the passage of Mount Cenis, where I again crossed the\nAlps in my way to Lyons.\n\nThe use of foreign travel has been often debated as a general\nquestion; but the conclusion must be finally applied to the\ncharacter and circumstances of each individual.  With the education\nof boys, where or how they may pass over some juvenile years with\nthe least mischief to themselves or others, I have no concern.  But\nafter supposing the previous and indispensable requisites of age,\njudgment, a competent knowledge of men and books, and a freedom from\ndomestic prejudices, I will briefly describe the qualifications\nwhich I deem most essential to a traveller.  He should be endowed\nwith an active, indefatigable vigour of mind and body, which can\nseize every mode of conveyance, and support, with a careless smile,\nevery hardship of the road, the weather, or the inn.  The benefits\nof foreign travel will correspond with the degrees of these\nqualifications; but, in this sketch, those to whom I am known will\nnot accuse me of framing my own panegyric.  It was at Rome, on the\n15th of October 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the\nCapitol, while the bare-footed fryars were singing vespers in the\ntemple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of\nthe city first started to my mind.  But my original plan was\ncircumscribed to the decay of the city rather than of the empire:\nand though my reading and reflections began to point towards that\nobject, some years elapsed, and several avocations intervened,\nbefore I was seriously engaged in the execution of that laborious\nwork.\n\nI had not totally renounced the southern provinces of France, but\nthe letters which I found at Lyons were expressive of some\nimpatience.  Rome and Italy had satiated my curious appetite, and I\nwas now ready to return to the peaceful retreat of my family and\nbooks.  After a happy fortnight I reluctantly left Paris, embarked\nat Calais, again landed at Dover, after an interval of two years and\nfive months, and hastily drove through the summer dust and solitude\nof London.  On June 25 1765 I arrived at my father's house: and the\nfive years and a half between my travels and my father's death\n(1770) are the portion of my life which I passed with the least\nenjoyment, and which I remember with the least satisfaction.  Every\nspring I attended the monthly meeting and exercise of the militia at\nSouthampton; and by the resignation of my father, and the death of\nSir Thomas Worsley, I was successively promoted to the rank of major\nand lieutenant-colonel commandant; but I was each year more\ndisgusted with the inn, the wine, the company, and the tiresome\nrepetition of annual attendance and daily exercise.  At home, the\noeconomy of the family and farm still maintained the same creditable\nappearance.  My connection with Mrs. Gibbon was mellowed into a warm\nand solid attachment: my growing years abolished the distance that\nmight yet remain between a parent and a son, and my behaviour\nsatisfied my father, who was proud of the success, however imperfect\nin his own life-time, of my literary talents.  Our solitude was soon\nand often enlivened by the visit of the friend of my youth, Mr.\nDeyverdun, whose absence from Lausanne I had sincerely lamented.\nAbout three years after my first departure, he had emigrated from\nhis native lake to the banks of the Oder in Germany.  The res\naugusta domi, the waste of a decent patrimony, by an improvident\nfather, obliged him, like many of his countrymen, to confide in his\nown industry; and he was entrusted with the education of a young\nprince, the grandson of the Margrave of Schavedt, of the Royal\nFamily of Prussia.  Our friendship was never cooled, our\ncorrespondence was sometimes interrupted; but I rather wished than\nhoped to obtain Mr. Deyverdun for the companion of my Italian tour.\nAn unhappy, though honourable passion, drove him from his German\ncourt; and the attractions of hope and curiosity were fortified by\nthe expectation of my speedy return to England.  During four\nsuccessive summers he passed several weeks or months at Beriton, and\nour free conversations, on every topic that-could interest the heart\nor understanding, would have reconciled me to a desert or a prison.\nIn the winter months of London my sphere of knowledge and action was\nsomewhat enlarged, by the many new acquaintance which I had\ncontracted in the militia and abroad; and I must regret, as more\nthan an acquaintance, Mr. Godfrey Clarke of Derbyshire, an amiable\nand worthy young man, who was snatched away by an untimely death.  A\nweekly convivial meeting was established by myself and travellers,\nunder the name of the Roman Club.\n\nThe renewal, or perhaps the improvement, of my English life was\nembittered by the alteration of my own feelings.  At the age of\ntwenty-one I was, in my proper station of a youth, delivered from\nthe yoke of education, and delighted with the comparative state of\nliberty and affluence.  My filial obedience was natural and easy;\nand in the gay prospect of futurity, my ambition did not extend\nbeyond the enjoyment of my books, my leisure, and my patrimonial\nestate, undisturbed by the cares of a family and the duties of a\nprofession.  But in the militia I was armed with power; in my\ntravels, I was exempt from controul; and as I approached, as I\ngradually passed my thirtieth year, I began to feel the desire of\nbeing master to my own house.  The most gentle authority will\nsometimes frown without reason, the most cheerful submission will\nsometimes murmur without cause; and such is the law of our imperfect\nnature, that we must either command or obey; that our personal\nliberty is supported by the obsequiousness of our own dependants.\nWhile so many of my acquaintance were married or in parliament, or\nadvancing with a rapid step in the various roads of honour and\nfortune, I stood alone, immoveable and insignificant; for after the\nmonthly meeting of 1770, I had even withdrawn myself from the\nmilitia, by the resignation of an empty and barren commission.  My\ntemper is not susceptible of envy, and the view of successful merit\nhas always excited my warmest applause.  The miseries of a vacant\nlife were never known to a man whose hours were insufficient for the\ninexhaustible pleasures of study.  But I lamented that at the proper\nage I had not embraced the lucrative pursuits of the law or of\ntrade, the chances of civil office or India adventure, or even the\nfat slumbers of the church; and my repentance became more lively as\nthe loss of time was more irretrievable.  Experience shewed me the\nuse of grafting my private consequence on the importance of a great\nprofessional body; the benefits of those firm connections which are\ncemented by hope and interest, by gratitude and emulation, by the\nmutual exchange of services and favours.  From the emoluments of a\nprofession I might have derived an ample fortune, or a competent\nincome, instead of being stinted to the same narrow allowance, to be\nincreased only by an event which I sincerely deprecated.  The\nprogress and the knowledge of our domestic disorders aggravated my\nanxiety, and I began to apprehend that I might be left in my old age\nwithout the fruits either of industry or inheritance.\n\nIn the first summer after my return, whilst I enjoyed at Beriton the\nsociety of my friend Deyverdun, our daily conversations expatiated\nover the field of ancient and modern literature; and we freely\ndiscussed my studies, my first Essay, and my future projects.  The\nDecline and Fall of Rome I still contemplated at an awful distance:\nbut the two historical designs which had balanced my choice were\nsubmitted to his taste: and in the parallel between the Revolutions\nof Florence and Switzerland, our common partiality for a country\nwhich was his by birth, and mine by adoption, inclined the scale in\nfavour of the latter.  According to the plan, which was soon\nconceived and digested, I embraced a period of two hundred years,\nfrom the association of the three peasants of the Alps to the\nplenitude and prosperity of the Helvetic body in the sixteenth\ncentury.  I should have described the deliverance and victory of the\nSwiss, who have never shed the blood of their tyrants but in a field\nof battle; the laws and manners of the confederate states; the\nsplendid trophies of the Austrian, Burgundian, and Italian wars; and\nthe wisdom of a nation, which, after some sallies of martial\nadventure, has been content to guard the blessings of peace with the\nsword of freedom.\n\n          --Manus haec inimica tyrannis\n          Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem.\n\nMy judgment, as well as my enthusiasm, was satisfied with the\nglorious theme; and the assistance of Deyverdun seemed to remove an\ninsuperable obstacle.  The French or Latin memorials, of which I was\nnot ignorant, are inconsiderable in number and weight; but in the\nperfect acquaintance of my friend with the German language, I found\nthe key of a more valuable collection.  The most necessary books\nwere procured; he translated, for my use, the folio volume of\nSchilling, a copious and contemporary relation of the war of\nBurgundy; we read and marked the most interesting parts of the great\nchronicle of Tschudi; and by his labour, or that of an inferior\nassistant, large extracts were made from the History of Lauffer and\nthe Dictionary of Lew: yet such was the distance and delay, that two\nyears elapsed in these preparatory steps; and it was late in the\nthird summer (1767) before I entered, with these slender materials,\non the more agreeable task of composition.  A specimen of my\nHistory, the first book, was read the following winter in a literary\nsociety of foreigners in London; and as the author was unknown, I\nlistened, without observation, to the free strictures, and\nunfavourable sentence, of my judges.  The momentary sensation was\npainful; but their condemnation was ratified by my cooler thoughts.\nI delivered my imperfect sheets to the flames,--and for ever\nrenounced a design in which some expence, much labour, and more time\nhad been so vainly consumed.  I cannot regret the loss of a slight\nand superficial essay, for such the work must have been in the hands\nof a stranger, uninformed by the scholars and statesmen, and remote\nfrom the libraries and archives of the Swiss republics.  My ancient\nhabits, and the presence of Deyverdun, encouraged me to write in\nFrench for the continent of Europe; but I was conscious myself that\nmy style, above prose and below poetry, degenerated into a verbose\nand turgid declamation.  Perhaps I may impute the failure to the\ninjudicious choice of a foreign language.  Perhaps I may suspect\nthat the language itself is ill adapted to sustain the vigour and\ndignity of an important narrative.  But if France, so rich in\nliterary merit, had produced a great original historian, his genius\nwould have formed and fixed the idiom to the proper tone, the\npeculiar model of historical eloquence.\n\nIt was in search of some liberal and lucrative employment that my\nfriend Deyverdun had visited England.  His remittances from home\nwere scanty and precarious.  My purse was always open, but it was\noften empty; and I bitterly felt the want of riches and power, which\nmight have enabled me to correct the errors of his fortune.  His\nwishes and qualifications solicited the station of the travelling\ngovernor of some wealthy pupil; but every vacancy provoked so many\neager candidates, that for a long time I struggled without success;\nnor was it till after much application that I could even place him\nas a clerk in the office of the secretary of state.  In a residence\nof several years he never acquired the just pronunciation and\nfamiliar use of the English tongue, but he read our most difficult\nauthors with ease and taste: his critical knowledge of our language\nand poetry was such as few foreigners have possessed; and few of our\ncountrymen could enjoy the theatre of Shakspeare and Garrick with\nmore exquisite feeling and discernment.  The consciousness of his\nown strength, and the assurance of my aid, emboldened him to imitate\nthe example of Dr. Maty, whose Journal Britannique was esteemed and\nregretted; and to improve his model, by uniting with the\ntransactions of literature a philosophic view of the arts and\nmanners of the British nation.  Our journal for the year 1767, under\nthe title of Memoires Literaires de la Grand Bretagne, was soon\nfinished, and sent to the press.  For the first article, Lord\nLyttelton's History of Henry II., I must own myself responsible; but\nthe public has ratified my judgment of that voluminous work, in\nwhich sense and learning are not illuminated by a ray of genius.\nThe next specimen was the choice of my friend, the Bath Guide, a\nlight and whimsical performance, of local, and even verbal,\npleasantry.  I started at the attempt: he smiled at my fears: his\ncourage was justified by success; and a master of both languages\nwill applaud the curious felicity with which he has transfused into\nFrench prose the spirit, and even the humour, of the English verse.\nIt is not my wish to deny how deeply I was interested in these\nMemoirs, of which I need not surely be ashamed; but at the distance\nof more than twenty years, it would be impossible for me to\nascertain the respective shares of the two associates.  A long and\nintimate communication of ideas had cast our sentiments and style in\nthe same mould.  In our social labours we composed and corrected by\nturns; and the praise which I might honestly bestow, would fall\nperhaps on some article or passage most properly my own.  A second\nvolume (for the year 1768) was published of these Memoirs.  I will\npresume to say, that their merit was superior to their reputation;\nbut it is not less true, that they were productive of more\nreputation than emolument.  They introduced my friend to the\nprotection, and myself to the acquaintance, of the Earl of\nChesterfield, whose age and infirmities secluded him from the world;\nand of Mr. David Hume, who was under-secretary to the office in\nwhich Deyverdun was more humbly employed.  The former accepted a\ndedication,(April 12, 1769,) and reserved the author for the future\neducation of his successor: the latter enriched the Journal with a\nreply to Mr. Walpole's Historical Doubts, which he afterwards shaped\ninto the form of a note.  The materials of the third volume were\nalmost completed, when I recommended Deyverdun as governor to Sir\nRichard Worsley, a youth, the son of my old Lieutenant-colonel, who\nwas lately deceased.  They set forwards on their travels; nor did\nthey return to England till some time after my father's death.\n\nMy next publication was an accidental sally of love and resentment;\nof my reverence for modest genius, and my aversion for insolent\npedantry.  The sixth book of the AEneid is the most pleasing and\nperfect composition of Latin poetry.  The descent of AEneas and the\nSibyl to the infernal regions, to the world of spirits, expands an\nawful and boundless prospect, from the nocturnal gloom of the\nCumaean grot,\n\n          Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram,\n\nto the meridian brightness of the Elysian fields;\n\n          Largior hic campos aether et lumine vestit\n          Purpureo--\n\nfrom the dreams of simple Nature, to the dreams, alas! of Egyptian\ntheology, and the philosophy of the Greeks.  But the final\ndismission of the hero through the ivory gate, whence\n\n          Falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes,\n\nseems to dissolve the whole enchantment, and leaves the reader in a\nstate of cold and anxious scepticism.  This most lame and impotent\nconclusion has been variously imputed to the taste or irreligion of\nVirgil; but, according to the more elaborate interpretation of\nBishop Warburton, the descent to hell is not a false, but a mimic\nscene; which represents the initiation of AEneas, in the character\nof a law-giver, to the Eleusinian mysteries.  This hypothesis, a\nsingular chapter in the Divine Legation of Moses, had been admitted\nby many as true; it was praised by all as ingenious; nor had it been\nexposed, in a space of thirty years, to a fair and critical\ndiscussion.  The learning and the abilities of the author had raised\nhim to a just eminence; but he reigned the dictator and tyrant of\nthe world of literature.  The real merit of Warburton was degraded\nby the pride and presumption with which he pronounced his infallible\ndecrees; in his polemic writings he lashed his antagonists without\nmercy or moderation; and his servile flatterers, (see the base and\nmalignant Essay on the Delicacy of Friendship,) exalting the master\ncritic far above Aristotle and Longinus, assaulted every modest\ndissenter who refused to consult the oracle, and to adore the idol.\nIn a land of liberty, such despotism must provoke a general\nopposition, and the zeal of opposition is seldom candid or\nimpartial.  A late professor of Oxford, (Dr. Lowth,) in a pointed\nand polished epistle, (Aug. 31, 1765,) defended himself, and\nattacked the Bishop; and, whatsoever might be the merits of an\ninsignificant controversy, his victory was clearly established by\nthe silent confusion of Warburton and his slaves.  I too, without\nany private offence, was ambitious of breaking a lance against the\ngiant's shield; and in the beginning of the year 1770, my Critical\nObservations on the Sixth Book of the AEneid were sent, without my\nname, to the press.  In this short Essay, my first English\npublication, I aimed my strokes against the person and the\nhypothesis of Bishop Warburton.  I proved, at least to my own\nsatisfaction, that the ancient lawgivers did not invent the\nmysteries, and that AEneas was never invested with the office of\nlawgiver: that there is not any argument, any circumstance, which\ncan melt a fable into allegory, or remove the scene from the Lake\nAvernus to the Temple of Ceres: that such a wild supposition is\nequally injurious to the poet and the man: that if Virgil was not\ninitiated he could not, if he were, he would not, reveal the secrets\nof the initiation: that the anathema of Horace (vetabo qui Cereris\nsacrum vulgarit, &c.) at once attests his own ignorance and the\ninnocence of his friend.  As the Bishop of Gloucester and his party\nmaintained a discreet silence, my critical disquisition was soon\nlost among the pamphlets of the day; but the public coldness was\noverbalanced to my feelings by the weighty approbation of the last\nand best editor of Virgil, Professor Heyne of Gottingen, who\nacquiesces in my confutation, and styles the unknown author, doctus\n- - - et elegantissimus Britannus.  But I cannot resist the\ntemptation of transcribing the favourable judgment of Mr. Hayley,\nhimself a poet and a scholar \"An intricate hypothesis, twisted into\na long and laboured chain of quotation and argument, the\nDissertation on the Sixth Book of Virgil, remained some time\nunrefuted.  - - - At length, a superior, but anonymous, critic\narose, who, in one of the most judicious and spirited essays that\nour nation has produced, on a point of classical literature,\ncompletely overturned this ill-founded edifice, and exposed the\narrogance and futility of its assuming architect.\" He even\ncondescends to justify an acrimony of style, which had been gently\nblamed by the more unbiassed German; \"Paullo acrius quam velis - - -\nperstrinxit.\"  But I cannot forgive myself the contemptuous\ntreatment of a span who, with all his faults, was entitled to my\nesteem; [Note: The Divine Legation of Moses is a monument, already\ncrumbling in the dust, of the vigour and weakness of the human mind.\nIf Warburton's new argument proved anything, it would be a\ndemonstration against the legislator, who left his people without\nthe knowledge of a future state.  But some episodes of the work, on\nthe Greek philosophy, the hieroglyphics of Egypt, &c. are entitled\nto the praise of learning, imagination, and discernment.] and I can\nless forgive, in a personal attack, the cowardly concealment of my\nname and character.\n\nIn the fifteen years between my Essay on the Study of Literature and\nthe first volume of the Decline and Fall, (1761-1776,) this\ncriticism on Warburton, and some articles in the journal, were my\nsole publications.  It is more especially incumbent on me to mark\nthe employment, or to confess the waste of time, from my travels to\nmy father's death, an interval in which I was not diverted by any\nprofessional duties from the labours and pleasures of a studious\nlife.  1. As soon as I was released from the fruitless task of the\nSwiss revolutions, (1768,) I began gradually to advance from the\nwish to the hope, from the hope to the design, from the design to\nthe execution, of my historical work, of whose limits and extent I\nhad yet a very inadequate notion.  The Classics, as low as Tacitus,\nthe younger Pliny, and Juvenal, were my old and familiar companions.\nI insensibly plunged into the ocean of the Augustan history; and in\nthe descending series I investigated, with my pen almost always in\nmy hand, the original records, both Greek and Latin, from Dion\nCassius to Ammianus Marcellinus, from the reign of Trajan to the\nlast age of the Western Caesars.  The subsidiary rays of medals, and\ninscriptions of geography and chronology, were thrown on their\nproper objects; and I applied the collections of Tillemont, whose\ninimitable accuracy almost assumes the character of genius, to fix\nand arrange within my reach the loose and scattered atoms of\nhistorical information.  Through the darkness of the middle ages I\nexplored my way in the Annals and Antiquities of Italy of the\nlearned Muratori; and diligently compared them with the parallel or\ntransverse lines of Sigonius and Maffei, Baronius and Pagi, till I\nalmost grasped the ruins of Rome in the fourteenth century, without\nsuspecting that this final chapter must be attained by the labour of\nsix quartos and twenty years.  Among the books which I purchased,\nthe Theodocian Code, with the commentary of James Godefroy, must be\ngratefully remembered.  I used it (and much I used it) as a work of\nhistory, rather than of jurisprudence: but in every light it may be\nconsidered as a full and capacious repository of the political state\nof the empire in the fourth and fifth centuries.  As I believed, and\nas I still believe, that the propagation of the Gospel, and the\ntriumph of the church, are inseparably connected with the decline of\nthe Roman monarchy, I weighed the causes and effects of the\nrevolution, and contrasted the narratives and apologies of the\nChristians themselves, with the glances of candour or enmity which\nthe Pagans have cast on the rising sects, The Jewish and Heathen\ntestimonies, as they are collected and illustrated by Dr. Lardner,\ndirected, without superseding, my search of the originals; and in an\nample dissertation on the miraculous darkness of the passion, I\nprivately withdrew my conclusions from the silence of an unbelieving\nage.  I have assembled the preparatory studies, directly or\nindirectly relative to my history; but, in strict equity, they must\nbe spread beyond this period of my life, over the two summers (1771\nand 1772) that elapsed between my father's death and my settlement\nin London.  2. In a free conversation with books and men, it would\nbe endless to enumerate the names and characters of all who are\nintroduced to our acquaintance; but in this general acquaintance we\nmay select the degrees of friendship and esteem, according to the\nwise maxim, Multum legere potius quam multa.  I reviewed, again and\nagain, the immortal works of the French and English, the Latin and\nItalian classics.  My Greek studies (though less assiduous than I\ndesigned) maintained and extended my knowledge of that incomparable\nidiom.  Homer and Xenophon were still my favourite authors; and I\nhad almost prepared for the press an Essay on the Cyropoedia, which,\nin my own judgment, is not unhappily laboured.  After a certain age,\nthe new publications of merit are the sole food of the many; and the\nmust austere student will be often tempted to break the line, for\nthe sake of indulging his own curiosity, and of providing the topics\nof fashionable currency.  A more respectable motive maybe assigned\nfor the third perusal of Blackstone's Commentaries, and a copious\nand critical abstract of that English work was my first serious\nproduction in my native language.  3. My literary leisure was much\nless complete and independent than it might appear to the eye of a\nstranger.  In the hurry of London I was destitute of books; in the\nsolitude of Hampshire I was not master of my time.  My quiet was\ngradually disturbed by our domestic anxiety, and I should be ashamed\nof my unfeeling philosophy, had I found much time or taste for study\nin the last fatal summer (1770) of my father's decay and\ndissolution.\n\nThe disembodying of the militia at the close of the war (1763) had\nrestored the Major (a new Cincinnatus) to a life of agriculture.\nHis labours were useful, his pleasures innocent, his wishes\nmoderate; and my father seemed to enjoy the state of happiness which\nis celebrated by poets and philosophers, as the most agreeable to\nnature, and the least accessible to fortune.\n\n          Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis\n          (Ut prisca gens mortalium)\n          Paterna rura bubus exercet suis,\n          Solutus omni foenore.\n               HOR. Epod. ii.\n\n          Like the first mortals, blest is he,\n          From debts, and usury, and business free,\n          With his own team who ploughs the soil,\n          Which grateful once confessed his father's toil.\n               FRANCIS.\n\nBut the last indispensable condition, the freedom from debt, was\nwanting to my father's felicity; and the vanities of his youth were\nseverely punished by the solicitude and sorrow of his declining age.\nThe first mortgage, on my return from Lausanne, (1758,) had afforded\nhim a partial and transient relief.  The annual demand of interest\nand allowance was a heavy deduction from his income; the militia was\na source of expence, the farm in his hands was not a profitable\nadventure, he was loaded with the costs and damages of an obsolete\nlaw-suit; and each year multiplied the number, and exhausted the\npatience, of his creditors.  Under these painful circumstances, I\nconsented to an additional mortgage, to the sale of Putney, and to\nevery sacrifice that could alleviate his distress.  But he was no\nlonger capable of a rational effort, and his reluctant delays\npostponed not the evils themselves, but the remedies of those evils\n(remedia malorum potius quam mala differebat).  The pangs of shame,\ntenderness, and self-reproach, incessantly preyed on his vitals; his\nconstitution was broken; he lost his strength and his sight; the\nrapid progress of a dropsy admonished him of his end, and he sunk\ninto the grave on Nov. 10, 1770, in the sixty-fourth year of his\nage.  A family tradition insinuates that Mr. William Law had drawn\nhis pupil in the light and inconstant character of Flatus, who is\never confident, and ever disappointed in the chace of happiness.\nBut these constitutional failing were happily compensated by the\nvirtues of the head and heart, by the warmest sentiments of honour\nand humanity.  His graceful person, polite address, gentle manners,\nand unaffected cheerfulness, recommended him to the favour of every\ncompany; and in the change of times and opinions, his liberal spirit\nhad long since delivered him from the zeal and prejudice of a Tory\neducation.  I submitted to the order of Nature; and my grief was\nsoothed by the conscious satisfaction that I had discharged all the\nduties of filial piety.\n\nAs soon as I had paid the last solemn duties to my father, and\nobtained, from time and reason, a tolerable composure of mind, I\nbegan to form the plan of an independent life, most adapted to my\ncircumstances and inclination.  Yet so intricate was the net, my\nefforts were so awkward and feeble, that nearly two years (Nov.\n1770-Oct. 1772) were suffered to elapse before I could disentangle\nmyself from the management of the farm, and transfer my residence\nfrom Beriton to a house in London.  During this interval I continued\nto divide my year between town and the country; but my new situation\nwas brightened by hope; my stay in London was prolonged into the\nsummer; and the uniformity of the summer was occasionally broken by\nvisits and excursions at a distance from home.  The gratification of\nmy desires (they were not immoderate) has been seldom disappointed\nby the want of money or credit; my pride was never insulted by the\nvisit of an importunate tradesman; and my transient anxiety for the\npast or future has been dispelled by the studious or social\noccupation of the present hour.  My conscience does not accuse me of\nany act of extravagance or injustice, and the remnant of my estate\naffords an ample and honourable provision for my declining age.  I\nshall not expatiate on my oeconomical affairs, which cannot be\ninstructive or amusing to the reader.  It is a rule of prudence, as\nwell as of politeness, to reserve such confidence for the ear of a\nprivate friend, without exposing our situation to the envy or pity\nof strangers; for envy is productive of hatred, and pity borders too\nnearly on contempt.  Yet I may believe, and even assert, that in\ncircumstances more indigent or more wealthy, I should never have\naccomplished the task, or acquired the fame, of an historian; that\nmy spirit would have been broken by poverty and contempt, and that\nmy industry might have been relaxed in the labour and luxury of a\nsuperfluous fortune.\n\nI had now attained the first of earthly blessings, independence: I\nwas the absolute master of my hours and actions: nor was I deceived\nin the hope that the establishment of my library in town would allow\nme to divide the day between study and society.  Each year the\ncircle of my acquaintance, the number of my dead and living\ncompanions, was enlarged.  To a lover of books, the shops and sales\nof London present irresistible temptations; and the manufacture of\nmy history required a various and growing stock of materials.  The\nmilitia, my travels, the House of Commons, the fame of an author,\ncontributed to multiply my connections: I was chosen a member of the\nfashionable clubs; and, before I left England in 1783, there were\nfew persons of any eminence in the literary or political world to\nwhom I was a stranger.  [Note: From the mixed, though polite,\ncompany of Boodle's, White's, and Brooks's, I must honourably\ndistinguish a weekly society, which was instituted in the year 1764,\nand which still continues to flourish, under the title of the\nLiterary Club. (Hawkins's Life of Johnson, p.415. Boswell's Tour to\nthe Hebrides, p 97.)  The names of Dr. Johnson, Mr. Burke, Mr.\nTopham Beauclerc, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldsmith, Sir Joshua Reynolds,\nMr. Colman, Sir William Jones, Dr. Percy, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr.\nAdam Smith, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Dunning, Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Warton,\nand his brother Mr. Thomas Warton, Dr. Burney, &c., form a large and\nluminous constellation of British stars.] It would most assuredly be\nin my power to amuse the reader with a gallery of portraits and a\ncollection of anecdotes.  But I have always condemned the practice\nof transforming a private memorial into a vehicle of satire or\npraise.  By my own choice I passed in town the greatest part of the\nyear; but whenever I was desirous of breathing the air of the\ncountry, I possessed an hospitable retreat at Sheffield-place in\nSussex, in the family of my valuable friend Mr. Holroyd, whose\ncharacter, under the name of Lord Sheffield, has since been more\nconspicuous to the public.\n\nNo sooner was I settled in my house and library, than I undertook\nthe composition of the first volume of my History.  At the outset\nall was dark and doubtful; even the title of the work, the true aera\nof the Decline and Fall of the Empire, the limits of the\nintroduction, the division of the chapters, and the order of the\nnarrative; and I was often tempted to cast away the labour of seven\nyears.  The style of an author should be the image of his mind, but\nthe choice and command of language is the fruit of exercise.  Many\nexperiments were made before I could hit the middle tone between a\ndull chronicle and a rhetorical declamation: three times did I\ncompose the first chapter, and twice the second and third, before I\nwas tolerably satisfied with their effect.  In the remainder of the\nway I advanced with a more equal and easy pace; but the fifteenth\nand sixteenth chapters have been reduced by three successive\nrevisals, from a large volume to their present size; and they might\nstill be compressed, without any loss of facts or sentiments.  An\nopposite fault may be imputed to the concise and superficial\nnarrative of the first reigns from Commodus to Alexander; a fault of\nwhich I have never heard, except from Mr. Hume in his last journey\nto London.  Such an oracle might have been consulted and obeyed with\nrational devotion; but I was soon disgusted with the modest practice\nof reading the manuscript to my friends.  Of such friends some will\npraise from politeness, and some will criticise from vanity.  The\nauthor himself is the best judge of his own performance; no one has\nso deeply meditated on the subject; no one is so sincerely\ninterested in the event.\n\nBy the friendship of Mr. (now Lord) Eliot, who had married my first\ncousin, I was returned at the general election for the borough of\nLiskeard.  I took my seat at the beginning of the memorable contest\nbetween Great Britain and America, and supported, with many a\nsincere and silent vote, the rights, though not, perhaps, the\ninterest, of the mother country.  After a fleeting illusive hope,\nprudence condemned me to acquiesce in the humble station of a mute.\nI was not armed by Nature and education with the intrepid energy of\nmind and voice.\n\n     Vincentem strepitus, et natum rebus agendis.\n\nTimidity was fortified by pride, and even the success of my pen\ndiscouraged the trial of my voice.  But I assisted at the debates of\na free assembly; I listened to the attack and defence of eloquence\nand reason; I had a near prospect of the characters, views, and\npassions of the first men of the age.  The cause of government was\nably vindicated by Lord North, a statesman of spotless integrity, a\nconsummate master of debate, who could wield, with equal dexterity,\nthe arms of reason and of ridicule.  He was seated on the\nTreasury-bench between his Attorney and Solicitor General, the two\npillars of the law and state, magis pares quam similes; and the\nminister might indulge in a short slumber, whilst he was upholden on\neither hand by the majestic sense of Thurlow, and the skilful\neloquence of Wedderburne.  From the adverse side of the house an\nardent and powerful opposition was supported, by the lively\ndeclamation of Barre, the legal acuteness of Dunning, the profuse\nand philosophic fancy of Burke, and the argumentative vehemence of\nFox, who in the conduct of a party approved himself equal to the\nconduct of an empire.  By such men every operation of peace and war,\nevery principle of justice or policy, every question of authority\nand freedom, was attacked and defended; and the subject of the\nmomentous contest was the union or separation of Great Britain and\nAmerica.  The eight sessions that I sat in parliament were a school\nof civil prudence, the first and most essential virtue of an\nhistorian.\n\nThe volume of my History, which had been somewhat delayed by the\nnovelty and tumult of a first session, was now ready for the press.\nAfter the perilous adventure had been declined by my friend Mr.\nElmsly, I agreed, upon easy terms, with Mr. Thomas Cadell, a\nrespectable bookseller, and Mr. William Strahan, an eminent printer;\nand they undertook the care and risk of the publication, which\nderived more credit from the name of the shop than from that of the\nauthor.  The last revisal of the proofs was submitted to my\nvigilance; and many blemishes of style, which had been invisible in\nthe manuscript, were discovered and corrected in the printed sheet.\nSo moderate were our hopes, that the original impression had been\nstinted to five hundred, till the number was doubled by the\nprophetic taste of Mr. Strahan.  During this awful interval I was\nneither elated by the ambition of fame, nor depressed by the\napprehension of contempt.  My diligence and accuracy were attested\nby my own conscience.  History is the most popular species of\nwriting, since it can adapt itself to the highest or the lowest\ncapacity.  I had chosen an illustrious subject.  Rome is familiar to\nthe school-boy and the statesman; and my narrative was deduced from\nthe last period of classical reading.  I had likewise flattered\nmyself, that an age of light and liberty would receive, without\nscandal, an inquiry into the human causes of the progress and\nestablishment of Christianity.\n\nI am at a loss how to describe the success of the work, without\nbetraying the vanity of the writer.  The first impression was\nexhausted in a few days; a second and third edition were scarcely\nadequate to the demand; and the bookseller's property was twice\ninvaded by the pirates of Dublin.  My book was on every table, and\nalmost on every toilette; the historian was crowned by the taste or\nfashion of the day; nor was the general voice disturbed by the\nbarking of any profane critic.  The favour of mankind is most freely\nbestowed on a new acquaintance of any original merit; and the mutual\nsurprise of the public and their favourite is productive of those\nwarm sensibilities, which at a second meeting can no longer be\nrekindled.  If I listened to the music of praise, I was more\nseriously satisfied with the approbation of my judges.  The candour\nof Dr. Robertson embraced his disciple.  A letter from Mr. Hume\noverpaid the labour of ten years, but I have never presumed to\naccept a place in the triumvirate of British historians.\n\nThat curious and original letter will amuse the reader, and his\ngratitude should shield my free communication from the reproach of\nvanity.\n\n\"DEAR SIR, EDINBURGH, 18th March 1776.\n\n\"As I ran through your volume of history with great avidity and\nimpatience, I cannot forbear discovering somewhat of the same\nimpatience in returning you thanks for your agreeable present, and\nexpressing the satisfaction which the performance has given me.\nWhether I consider the dignity of your style, the depth of your\nmatter, or the extensiveness of your learning, I must regard the\nwork as equally the object of esteem; and I own that if I had not\npreviously had the happiness of your personal acquaintance, such a\nperformance from an Englishman in our age would have given me some\nsurprise.  You may smile at this sentiment; but as it seems to me\nthat your countrymen, for almost a whole generation, have given\nthemselves up to barbarous and absurd faction, and have totally\nneglected all polite letters, I no longer expected any valuable\nproduction ever to come from them.  I know it will give you pleasure\n(as it did me) to find that all the men of letters in this place\nconcur in the admiration of your work, and in their anxious desire\nof your continuing it.\n\n\"When I heard of your undertaking, (which was some time ago,) I own\nI was a little curious to see how you would extricate yourself from\nthe subject of your two last chapters.  I think you have observed a\nvery prudent temperament; but it was impossible to treat the subject\nso as not to give grounds of suspicion against you, and you may\nexpect that a clamour will arise.  This, if anything, will retard\nyour success with the public; for in every other respect your work\nis calculated to be popular.  But among many other marks of decline,\nthe prevalence of superstition in England prognosticates the fall of\nphilosophy and decay of taste; and though nobody be more capable\nthan you to revive them, you will probably find a struggle in your\nfirst advances.\n\n\"I see you entertain a great doubt with regard to the authenticity\nof the poems of Ossian.  You are certainly right in so doing.  It is\nindeed strange that any men of sense could have imagined it\npossible, that above twenty thousand verses, along with numberless\nhistorical facts, could have been preserved by oral tradition during\nfifty generations, by the rudest, perhaps, of all the European\nnations, the most necessitous, the most turbulent, and the most\nunsettled.  Where a supposition is so contrary to common sense, any\npositive evidence of it ought never to be regarded.  Men run with\ngreat avidity to give their evidence in favour of what flatters\ntheir passions and their national prejudices.  You are therefore\nover and above indulgent to us in speaking of the matter with\nhesitation.\n\n\"I must inform you that we all are very anxious to hear that you\nhave fully collected the materials for your second volume, and that\nyou are even considerably advanced in the composition of it.  I\nspeak this more in the name of my friends than in my own; as I\ncannot expect to live so long as to see the publication of it.  Your\nensuing volume will be more delicate than the preceding, but I trust\nin your prudence for extricating you from the difficulties; and, in\nall events, you have courage to despise the clamour of bigots.\nI am, with great regard,\n\n\"Dear Sir, &c.\n\n \"DAVID HUME.\"\n\nSome weeks afterwards I had the melancholy pleasure of seeing Mr.\nHume in his passage through London; his body feeble, his mind firm.\nOn Aug. 25 of the same year (1776) he died, at Edinburgh, the death\nof a philosopher.\n\nMy second excursion to Paris was determined by the pressing\ninvitation of M. and Madame Necker, who had visited England in the\npreceding summer.  On my arrival I found M. Necker Director-general\nof the finances, in the first bloom of power and popularity.  His\nprivate fortune enabled him to support a liberal establishment, and\nhis wife, whose talents and virtues I had long admired, was\nadmirably qualified to preside in the conversation of her table and\ndrawing-room.  As their friend, I was introduced to the best company\nof both sexes; to the foreign ministers of all nations, and to the\nfirst names and characters of France; who distinguished me by such\nmarks of civility and kindness, as gratitude will not suffer me to\nforget, and modesty will not allow me to enumerate.  The fashionable\nsuppers often broke into the morning hours; yet I occasionally\nconsulted the Royal Library, and that of the Abbey of St. Germain,\nand in the free use of their books at home I had always reason to\npraise the liberality of those institutions.  The society of men of\nletters I neither courted nor declined; but I was happy in the\nacquaintance of M. de Buffon, who united with a sublime genius the\nmost amiable simplicity of mind and manners.  At the table of my old\nfriend, M. de Foncemagne, I was involved in a dispute with the Abbe\nde Mably; and his jealous irascible spirit revenged itself on a work\nwhich he was incapable of reading in the original.\n\nAs I might be partial in my own cause, I shall transcribe the words\nof an unknown critic, observing only, that this dispute had been\npreceded by another on the English constitution, at the house of the\nCountess de Froulay, an old Jansenist lady.\n\n\"Vous etiez chez M. de Foncemagne, mon cher Theodon, le jour que M.\nl'Abbe de Mably et M. Gibbon y dinerent en grande compagnie.  La\nconversation roula presque entierement sur l'histoire.  L'Abbe etant\nun profond politique, la tourna sur l'administration, quand on fut\nau desert: et comme par caractere, par humeur, par l'habitude\nd'admirer Tite Live, il ne prise que le systeme republicain, il se\nmit a vanter l'excellence des republiques; bien persuade que le\nsavant Anglois l'approuveroit en tout, et admireroit la profondeur\nde genie qui avoit fait deviner tous ces avantages a un Francois.\nMais M. Gibbon, instruit par l'experience des inconveniens d'un\ngouvernement populaire, ne fut point du tout de son avis, et il prit\ngenereusement la defense du gouvernement monarchique.  L'Abbe voulut\nle convaincre par Tite Live, et par quelques argumens tires de\nPlutarque en faveur des Spartiates.  M. Gibbon, doue de la memoire\nla plus heureuse, et ayant tous les faits presens a la pensee,\ndomina bien-tot la conversation; I'Abbe se facha, il s'emporta, il\ndit des choses dures; l'Anglois, conservant le phlegme de son pays,\nprenoit ses avantages, et pressoit l'Abbe avec d'autant plus de\nsucces que la colere le troubloit de plus en plus.  La conversation\ns'echauffoit, et M. de Foncemagne la rompit en se levant de table,\net en passant dans le salon, ou personne ne fut tente de la\nrenouer.\"--Supplement de la Maniere d'ecrire l'Histoire, p. 125,\n&c. [Note: Of the voluminous writings of the Abbe de Mably, (see his\nEloge by the Abbe Brizard,) the Principes du droit public de\nl'Europe, and the first part of the Observ. sur l'Hist. de France,\nmay be deservedly praised; and even the Maniere d'ecrire l'Hist.\ncontains several useful precepts and judicious remarks.  Mably was a\nlover of virtue and freedom; but his virtue was austere, and his\nfreedom was impatient of an equal.  Kings, magistrates, nobles, and\nsuccessful writers were the objects of his contempt, or hatred, or\nenvy; but his illiberal abuse of Voltaire, Hume, Buffon, the Abbe\nReynal, Dr. Robertson, and tutti quanti can be injurious only to\nhimself.]\n\nNearly two years had elapsed between the publication of my first and\nthe commencement of my second volume; and the causes must be\nassigned of this long delay.  1. After a short holiday, I indulged\nmy curiosity in some studies of a very different nature, a course of\nanatomy, which was demonstrated by Doctor Hunter; and some lessons\nof chymistry, which were delivered by Mr. Higgins.  The principles\nof these sciences, and a taste for books of natural history,\ncontributed to multiply my ideas and images; and the anatomist and\nchymist may sometimes track me in their own snow.  2. I dived,\nperhaps too deeply, into the mud of the Arian controversy; and many\ndays of reading, thinking, and writing were consumed in the pursuit\nof a phantom.  3. It is difficult to arrange, with order and\nperspicuity, the various transactions of the age of Constantine; and\nso much was I displeased with the first essay, that I committed to\nthe flames above fifty sheets.  4. The six months of Paris and\npleasure must be deducted from the account.  But when I resumed my\ntask I felt my improvement; I was now master of my style and\nsubject, and while the measure of my daily performance was enlarged,\nI discovered less reason to cancel or correct.  It has always been\nmy practice to cast a long paragraph in a single mould, to try it by\nmy ear, to deposit it in my memory, but to suspend the action of the\npen till I had given the last  polish to my work.  Shall I add, that\nI never found my mind more vigorous, not my composition more happy,\nthan in the winter hurry of society and parliament?\n\nHad I believed that the majority of English readers were so fondly\nattached even to the name and shadow of Christianity; had I foreseen\nthat the pious, the timid, and the prudent, would feel, or affect to\nfeel, with such exquisite sensibility; I might, perhaps, have\nsoftened the two invidious chapters, which would create many\nenemies, and conciliate few friends.  But the shaft was shot, the\nalarm was sounded, and I could only rejoice, that if the voice of\nour priests was clamorous and bitter, their hands were disarmed from\nthe powers of persecution.  I adhered to the wise resolution of\ntrusting myself and my writings to the candour of the public, till\nMr. Davies of Oxford presumed to attack, not the faith, but the\nfidelity, of the historian.  My Vindication, expressive of less\nanger than contempt, amused for a moment the busy and idle\nmetropolis; and the most rational part of the laity, and even of the\nclergy, appear to have been satisfied of my innocence and accuracy.\nI would not print this Vindication in quarto, lest it should be\nbound  and preserved with the history itself.  At the distance of\ntwelve years,  I calmly affirm my judgment of Davies, Chelsum, &c.\nA victory over  such antagonists was a sufficient humiliation.\nThey, however, were  rewarded in this world.  Poor Chelsum was\nindeed neglected; and I dare not boast the making Dr. Watson a\nbishop; he is a prelate of a large mind and liberal spirit: but I\nenjoyed the pleasure of giving a Royal pension to Mr. Davies, and of\ncollating Dr. Apthorpe to an archiepiscopal living.  Their success\nencouraged the zeal of Taylor the Arian, [Note: The stupendous\ntitle, Thoughts on the Causes of the grand Apostacy, at first\nagitated my nerves, till I discovered that it was the apostacy of\nthe whole church, since the Council of Nice, from Mr. Taylor's\nprivate religion.  His book is a thorough mixture of high enthusiasm\nand low buffoonery, and the Millennium is a fundamental article of\nhis creed.] and Milner the Methodist, [Note: From his grammar-school\nat Kingston upon Hull, Mr. Joseph Milner pronounces an anathema\nagainst all rational religion.  His faith is a divine taste, a\nspiritual inspiration; his church is a mystic and invisible body:\nthe natural Christians, such as Mr. Locke, who believe and interpret\nthe Scriptures, are, in his judgment, no better than profane\ninfidels.] with many others, whom it would  be difficult to\nremember, and tedious to rehearse.  The list of my adversaries,\nhowever, was graced with the more respectable names of Dr.\nPriestley, Sir David Dalrymple, and Dr. White; and every polemic, of\neither university, discharged his sermon or pamphlet against the\nimpenetrable silence of the Roman historian.  In his History of the\nCorruptions of Christianity, Dr. Priestley threw down his two\ngauntlets to Bishop Hurd and Mr. Gibbon.  I declined the challenge\nin a letter, exhorting my opponent to enlighten the world by his\nphilosophical discoveries, and to remember that the merit of his\npredecessor Servetus is now reduced to a single passage, which\nindicates the smaller circulation of the blood through the lungs,\nfrom and to the heart.  Instead of listening to this friendly\nadvice, the dauntless philosopher of Birmingham continued to fire\naway his double battery against those who believed too little, and\nthose who believed too much.  From my replies he has nothing to hope\nor fear: but his Socinian shield has repeatedly been pierced by the\nspear of Horsley, and his trumpet of sedition may at length awaken\nthe magistrates of a free country.  The profession and rank of Sir\nDavid Dalrymple (now a Lord of Session) has given a more decent\ncolour to his style.  But he scrutinized each separate passage of\nthe two chapters with the dry minuteness of a special pleader; and\nas he was always solicitous to make, he may have succeeded sometimes\nin finding, a flaw.  In his Annals of Scotland, he has shewn himself\na diligent collector and an accurate critic.  I have praised, and I\nstill praise, the eloquent sermons which were preached in St. Mary's\npulpit at Oxford by Dr. White.  If he assaulted me with some degree\nof illiberal acrimony, in such a place, and before such an audience,\nhe was obliged to speak the language of the country.  I smiled at a\npassage in one of his private letters to Mr. Badcock; \"The part\nwhere we encounter Gibbon must be brilliant and striking.\"  In a\nsermon preached before the university of Cambridge, Dr. Edwards\ncomplimented a work, \"which can only perish with the language\nitself;\" and esteems the author a formidable enemy.  He is, indeed,\nastonished that more learning and ingenuity has not been shewn in\nthe defence of Israel; that the prelates and dignitaries of the\nchurch (alas, good man!) did not vie with each other, whose stone\nshould sink the deepest in the forehead of this Goliath.\n\n\"But the force of truth will oblige us to confess, that in the\nattacks which have been levelled against our sceptical historian, we\ncan discover but slender traces of profound and exquisite erudition,\nof solid criticism and accurate investigation; but we are too\nfrequently disgusted by vague and inconclusive reasoning; by\nunseasonable banter and senseless witticisms; by imbittered bigotry\nand enthusiastic jargon; by futile cavils and illiberal invectives.\nProud and elated by the weakness of his antagonists, he condescends\nnot to handle the sword of controversy.\"--Monthly Review, Oct. 1790.\n\nLet me frankly own that I was startled at the first discharge of\necclesiastical ordnance; but as soon as I found that this empty\nnoise was mischievous only in the intention, my fear was converted\ninto indignation; and every feeling of indignation or curiosity has\nlong since subsided in pure and placid indifference.\n\nThe prosecution of my history was soon afterwards checked by another\ncontroversy of a very different kind.  At the request of the Lord\nChancellor, and of Lord Weymouth, then Secretary of State, I\nvindicated, against the French manifesto, the justice of the British\narms.  The whole correspondence of Lord Stormont, our late\nambassador at Paris, was submitted to my inspection, and the Memoire\nJustificatif, which I composed in French, was first approved by the\nCabinet Ministers, and then delivered as a State paper to the courts\nof  Europe.  The style and manner are praised by Beaumarchais\nhimself, who, in his private quarrel, attempted a reply; but he\nflatters me, by ascribing the memoir to Lord Stormont; and the\ngrossness of his invective betrays the loss of temper and of wit; he\nacknowledged, Oeuv. de Beaumarchais, iii. 299, 355, that le style ne\nseroit pas sans grace,  ni la logique sans justesse, &c. if the\nfacts were true which he  undertakes to disprove.  For these facts\nmy credit is not pledged; I spoke as a lawyer from my brief, but the\nveracity of Beaumarchais may be estimated from the assertion that\nFrance, by the treaty of Paris  (1763) was limited to a certain\nnumber of ships of war.  On the application of the Duke of Choiseul,\nhe was obliged to retract this daring falsehood.\n\nAmong the honourable connections which I had formed, I may justly\nbe proud of the friendship of Mr. Wedderburne, at that time\nAttorney-General, who now illustrates the title of Lord Loughborough,\nand the office of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.  By his strong\nrecommendation, and the favourable disposition of Lord North, I was\nappointed one of the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations;\nand my private income was enlarged by a clear addition of between\nseven and eight hundred pounds a-year.  The fancy of an hostile\norator may paint, in the strong colours of ridicule, \"the perpetual\nvirtual adjournment, and the unbroken sitting vacation of the Board\nof Trade.\" [Note: I can never forget the delight with which that\ndiffusive and ingenious orator, Mr. Burke, was heard by all sides of\nthe house, and even by those whose existence he proscribed. (Speech\non the Bill of Reform, p. 72-80.)  The Lords of Trade blushed at\ntheir insignificancy, and Mr. Eden's appeal to the 2,500 volumes of\nour Reports, served only to excite a general laugh.  I take this\nopportunity of certifying the correctness of Mr. Burke's printed\nspeeches, which I have heard and read.]  But it must be allowed that\nour duty was not intolerably severe, and that I enjoyed many days\nand weeks of repose, without being called away from my library to\nthe office.  My acceptance of a place provoked some of the leaders\nof opposition, with whom I had lived in habits of intimacy; and I\nwas most unjustly accused of deserting a party, in which I had never\nenlisted.\n\nThe aspect of the next session of parliament was stormy and\nperilous; county meetings, petitions, and committees of\ncorrespondence, announced the public discontent; and instead of\nvoting with a triumphant majority, the friends of government were\noften exposed to a struggle, and sometimes to a defeat.  The House\nof Commons adopted Mr. Dunning's motion, \"That the influence of the\nCrown had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished:\"\nand Mr. Burke's bill of reform was framed with skill, introduced\nwith eloquence, and  supported by numbers.  Our late president, the\nAmerican Secretary of State, very narrowly escaped the sentence of\nproscription; but the unfortunate Board of Trade was abolished in\nthe committee by a small majority (207 to 199) of eight votes.  The\nstorm, however, blew over for a time; a large defection of country\ngentlemen eluded the sanguine hopes of the patriots: the Lords of\nTrade were revived; administration recovered their strength and\nspirit; and the flames of London, which were kindled by a\nmischievous madman, admonished all thinking men of the danger of an\nappeal to the people.  In the premature dissolution which followed\nthis session of parliament I lost my seat.  Mr. Elliot was now\ndeeply engaged in the measures of opposition, and the electors of\nLeskeard are commonly of the same opinion as Mr. Elliot.\n\nIn this interval of my senatorial life, I published the second and\nthird volumes of the Decline and Fall.  My ecclesiastical history\nstill breathed the same spirit of freedom; but protestant zeal is\nmore indifferent to the characters and controversies of the fourth\nand fifth centuries.  My obstinate silence had damped the ardour of\nthe polemics.  Dr. Watson, the most candid of my adversaries,\nassured me that he had no thoughts of renewing the attack, and my\nimpartial balance of the virtues and vices of Julian was generally\npraised.  This truce was interrupted only by some animadversions of\nthe Catholics of Italy, and by some angry letters from Mr. Travis,\nwho made me personally responsible for condemning, with the best\ncritics, the spurious text of the three heavenly witnesses.\n\nThe piety or prudence of my Italian translator has provided an\nantidote against the poison of his original.  The 5th and 7th\nvolumes are armed with five letters from an anonymous divine to his\nfriends, Foothead and Kirk, two English students at Rome: and this\nmeritorious service is commended by Monsignor Stoner, a prelate of\nthe same nation, who discovers much venom in the fluid and nervous\nstyle of Gibbon.  The critical essay at the end of the third volume\nwas furnished by the Abbate Nicola Spedalieri, whose zeal has\ngradually swelled to a more solid confutation in two quarto\nvolumes.--Shall I be excused for not having read them?\n\nThe brutal insolence of Mr. Travis's challenge can only be excused\nby the absence of learning, judgment, and humanity; and to that\nexcuse be has the fairest or foulest pretension.  Compared with\nArchdeacon Travis, Chelsum and Davies assume the title of\nrespectable enemies.\n\nThe bigoted advocate of popes and monks may be turned over even to\nthe bigots of Oxford; and the wretched Travis still smarts under the\nlash of the merciless Porson.  I consider Mr. Porson's answer to\nArchdeacon Travis as the most acute and accurate piece of criticism\nwhich has appeared since the days of Bentley.  His strictures are\nfounded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened with wit;\nand his adversary neither deserves nor finds any quarter at his\nhands.  The evidence of the three heavenly witnesses would now be\nrejected in any court of justice: but prejudice is blind, authority\nis deaf, and our vulgar bibles will ever be polluted by this\nspurious text, \"sedet aeternumqne sedebit.\" The more learned\necclesiastics will indeed have the secret satisfaction of\nreprobating in the closet what they read in the church.\n\nI perceived, and without surprise, the coldness and even prejudice\nof the town; nor could a whisper escape my ear, that, in the\njudgment of many readers, my continuation was much inferior to the\noriginal attempts.  An author who cannot ascend will always appear\nto sink; envy was now prepared for my reception, and the zeal of my\nreligious,  was fortified by the motive of my political, enemies.\nBishop Newton, in writing his own life, was at full liberty to\ndeclare how much he himself and two eminent brethren were disgusted\nby Mr. G.'s prolixity, tediousness, and affectation.  But the old\nman should not have indulged his zeal in a false and feeble charge\nagainst the historian, who had faithfully and even cautiously\nrendered Dr. Burnet's meaning by the alternative of sleep or repose.\nThat philosophic divine supposes, that, in the period between death\nand the resurrection, human souls exist without a body, endowed with\ninternal consciousness, but destitute of all active or passive\nconnection with the external world.  \"Secundum communem dictionem\nsacrae scripturae, mors dicitur somnus, et morientes dicuntur\nabdormire, quod innuere mihi videtur statum mortis esse statum\nquietis, silentii, et {Greek expression}.\" (De Statu Mortuorum, ch.\nv. p. 98.)\n\nI was however encouraged by some domestic and foreign testimonies of\napplause; and the second and third volumes insensibly rose in sale\nand reputation to a level with the first.  But the public is seldom\nwrong; and I am inclined to believe that, especially in the\nbeginning, they are more prolix and less entertaining than the\nfirst: my efforts had not been relaxed by success, and I had rather\ndeviated into the opposite fault of minute and superfluous\ndiligence.  On the Continent, my name and writings were slowly\ndiffused; a French translation of the first volume had disappointed\nthe booksellers of Paris; and a passage in the third was construed\nas a personal reflection on the reigning monarch.  [Note: It may not\nbe generally known that Louis XVI. is a great reader, and a reader\nof English books.  On perusing a passage of my History which seems\nto compare him to Arcadius or Honorius, he expressed his resentment\nto the Prince of B------, from whom the intelligence was conveyed to\nme.  I shall neither disclaim the allusion, nor examine the\nlikeness; but the situation of the late King of France excludes all\nsuspicion of flattery; and I am ready to declare that the concluding\nobservations of my third volume were written before his accession to\nthe throne.]\n\nBefore I could apply for a seat at the general election the list was\nalready full; but Lord North's promise was sincere, his\nrecommendation was effectual, and I was soon chosen on a vacancy for\nthe borough of Lymington, in Hampshire.  In the first session of the\nnew parliament, administration stood their ground; their final\noverthrow was reserved for the second.  The American war had once\nbeen the favourite of the country: the pride of England was\nirritated by the resistance of her colonies, and the executive power\nwas driven by national clamour into the most vigorous and coercive\nmeasures.  But the length of a fruitless contest, the loss of\narmies, the accumulation of debt and taxes, and the hostile\nconfederacy of France, Spain, and Holland, indisposed the public to\nthe American war, and the persons by whom it was conducted; the\nrepresentatives of the people, followed, at a slow distance, the\nchanges of their opinion; and the ministers who refused to bend,\nwere broken by the tempest.  As soon as Lord North had lost, or was\nabout to lose, a majority in the House of Commons, he surrendered\nhis office, and retired to a private station, with the tranquil\nassurance of a clear conscience and a cheerful temper: the old\nfabric was dissolved, and the posts of government were occupied by\nthe victorious and veteran troops of opposition.  The lords of trade\nwere not immediately dismissed, but the board itself was abolished\nby Mr. Burke's bill, which decency had compelled the patriots to\nrevive; and I was stripped of a convenient salary, after having\nenjoyed it about three years.\n\nSo flexible is the title of my History, that the final aera might be\nfixed at my own choice; and I long hesitated whether I should be\ncontent with the three volumes, the fall of the Western empire,\nwhich fulfilled my first engagement with the public.  In this\ninterval of suspense, nearly a twelvemonth, I returned by a natural\nimpulse to the Greek authors of antiquity; I read with new pleasure\nthe Iliad and the Odyssey, the Histories of Herodotus, Thucydides,\nand Xenophon, a large portion of the tragic and comic theatre of\nAthens, and many interesting dialogues of the Socratic school.  Yet\nin the luxury of freedom I began to wish for the daily task, the\nactive pursuit, which gave a value to every book, and an object to\nevery inquiry; the preface of a new edition announced my design, and\nI dropped without reluctance from the age of Plato to that of\nJustinian.  The original texts of Procopius and Agathias supplied\nthe events and even the characters of his reign: but a laborious\nwinter was devoted to the Codes, the Pandects, and the modern\ninterpreters, before I presumed to form an abstract of the civil\nlaw.  My skill was improved by practice, my diligence perhaps was\nquickened by the loss of office; and, excepting the last chapter, I\nhad finished the fourth volume before I sought a retreat on the\nbanks of the Leman Lake.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this narrative to expatiate on the public\nor secret history of the times: the schism which followed the death\nof the Marquis of Rockingham, the appointment of the Earl of\nShelburne, the resignation of Mr. Fox, and his famous coalition with\nLord North.  But I may assert, with some degree of assurance, that\nin their political conflict those great antagonists had never felt\nany personal animosity to each other, that their reconciliation was\neasy and sincere, and that their friendship has never been clouded\nby the shadow of suspicion or jealousy.  The most violent or venal\nof their respective followers embraced this fair occasion of revolt,\nbut their alliance still commanded a majority in the House of\nCommons; the peace was censured, Lord Shelburne resigned, and the\ntwo friends knelt on the same cushion to take the oath of secretary\nof state.  From a principle of gratitude I adhered to the coalition:\nmy vote was counted in the day of battle, but I was overlooked in\nthe division of the spoil.  There were many claimants more deserving\nand importunate than myself: the board of trade could not be\nrestored; and, while the list of places was curtailed, the number of\ncandidates was doubled.  An easy dismission to a secure seat at the\nboard of customs or excise was promised on the first vacancy: but\nthe chance was distant and doubtful; nor could I solicit with much\nardour an ignoble servitude, which would have robbed me of the most\nvaluable of my studious hours: at the same time the tumult of\nLondon, and the attendance on parliament, were grown more irksome;\nand, without some additional income, I could not long or prudently\nmaintain the style of expence to which I was accustomed.\n\nFrom my early acquaintance with Lausanne I had always cherished a\nsecret wish, that the school of my youth might become the retreat of\nmy declining age.  A moderate fortune would secure the blessings of\nease, leisure, and independence: the country, the people, the\nmanners, the language, were congenial to my taste; and I might\nindulge the hope of passing some years in the domestic society of a\nfriend.  After travelling with several English, Mr. Deyverdun was\nnow settled at home, in a pleasant habitation, the gift of his\ndeceased aunt: we had long been separated, we had long been silent;\nyet in my first letter I exposed, with the most perfect confidence,\nmy situation, my sentiments, and my designs.  His immediate answer\nwas a warm and joyful acceptance: the picture of our future life\nprovoked my impatience; and the terms of arrangement were short and\nsimple, as he possessed the property, and I undertook the expence of\nour common house.  Before I could break my English chain, it was\nincumbent on me to struggle with the feelings of my heart, the\nindolence of my temper, and the opinion of the world, which\nunanimously condemned this voluntary banishment.  In the disposal of\nmy effects, the library, a sacred deposit, was alone excepted: as my\npost-chaise moved over Westminster-bridge I bid a long farewell to\nthe \"fumum et opes strepitumque Romae.\" My journey by the direct\nroad through France was not attended with any accident, and I\narrived at Lausanne nearly twenty years after my second departure.\nWithin less than three months the coalition struck on some hidden\nrocks: had I remained on board, I should have perished in the\ngeneral shipwreck.\n\nSince my establishment at Lausanne, more than seven years have\nelapsed; and if every day has not been equally soft and serene, not\na day, not a moment, has occurred in which I have repented of my\nchoice.  During my absence, a long portion of human life, many\nchanges had happened: my elder acquaintance had left the stage;\nvirgins were ripened into matrons, and children were grown to the\nage of manhood.  But the same manners were transmitted from one\ngeneration to another: my friend alone was an inestimable treasure;\nmy name was not totally forgotten, and all were ambitious to welcome\nthe arrival of a stranger and the return of a fellow-citizen.  The\nfirst winter was given to a general embrace, without any nice\ndiscrimination of persons and characters.  After a more regular\nsettlement, a more accurate survey, I discovered three solid and\npermanent benefits of my new situation.  1. My personal freedom had\nbeen somewhat impaired by the House of Commons and the Board of\nTrade; but I was now delivered from the chain of duty and\ndependence, from the hopes and fears of political adventure: my\nsober mind was no longer intoxicated by the fumes of party, and I\nrejoiced in my escape, as often as I read of the midnight debates\nwhich preceded the dissolution of parliament.  2. My English\noeconomy had been that of a solitary bachelor, who might afford some\noccasional dinners.  In Switzerland I enjoyed at every meal, at\nevery hour, the free and pleasant conversation of the friend of my\nyouth; and my daily table was always provided for the reception of\none or two extraordinary guests.  Our importance in society is less\na positive than a relative weight: in London I was lost in the\ncrowd; I ranked with the first families of Lausanne, and my style of\nprudent expence enabled me to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal\ncivilities.  3. Instead of a small house between a street and a\nstable-yard, I began to occupy a spacious and convenient mansion,\nconnected on the north side with the city, and open on the south to\na beautiful and boundless horizon.  A garden of four acres had been\nlaid out by the taste of Mr. Deyverdun: from the garden a rich\nscenery of meadows and vineyards descends to the Leman Lake, and the\nprospect far beyond the Lake is crowned by the stupendous mountains\nof Savoy.  My books and my acquaintance had been first united in\nLondon; but this happy position of my library in town and country\nwas finally reserved for Lausanne.  Possessed of every comfort in\nthis triple alliance, I could not be tempted to change my habitation\nwith the changes of the seasons.\n\nMy friends had been kindly apprehensive that I should not be able to\nexist in a Swiss town at the foot of the Alps, after having so long\nconversed with the first men of the first cities of the world.  Such\nlofty connections may attract the curious, and gratify the vain; but\nI am too modest, or too proud, to rate my own value by that of my\nassociates; and whatsoever may be the fame of learning or genius,\nexperience has shown the that the cheaper qualifications of\npoliteness and good sense are of more useful currency in the\ncommerce of life.  By many, conversation is esteemed as a theatre or\na school: but, after the morning has been occupied by the labours of\nthe library, I wish to unbend rather than to exercise my mind; and\nin the interval between tea and supper I am far from disdaining the\ninnocent amusement of a game at cards.  Lausanne is peopled by a\nnumerous gentry, whose companionable idleness is seldom disturbed by\nthe pursuits of avarice or ambition: the women, though confined to a\ndomestic education, are endowed for the most part with more taste\nand knowledge than their husbands and brothers: but the decent\nfreedom of both sexes is equally remote from the extremes of\nsimplicity and refinement.  I shall add as a misfortune rather than\na merit, that the situation and beauty of the Pays de Vaud, the long\nhabits of the English, the medical reputation of Dr. Tissot, and the\nfashion of viewing the mountains and Glaciers, have opened us on all\nsides to the incursions of foreigners.  The visits of Mr. and Madame\nNecker, of Prince Henry of Prussia, and of Mr. Fox, may form some\npleasing exceptions; but, in general, Lausanne has appeared most\nagreeable in my eyes, when we have been abandoned to our own\nsociety.  I had frequently seen Mr. Necker, in the summer of 1784,\nat a country house near Lausanne, where he composed his Treatise on\nthe Administration of the Finances.  I have since, in October 1790,\nvisited him in his present residence, the castle and barony of\nCopet, near Geneva.  Of the merits and measures of that statesman\nvarious opinions may be entertained; but all impartial men must\nagree in their esteem of his integrity and patriotism.\n\nIn August 1784, Prince Henry of Prussia, in his way to Paris, passed\nthree days at Lausanne.  His military conduct has been praised by\nprofessional men; his character has been vilified by the wit and\nmalice of a daemon (Mem. Secret de la Cour de Berlin); but I was\nflattered by his affability, and entertained by his conversation.\n\nIn his tour of Switzerland (Sept. 1788) Mr. Fox gave me two days of\nfree and private society.  He seemed to feel, and even to envy, the\nhappiness of my situation; while I admired the powers of a superior\nman, as they are blended in his attractive character with the\nsoftness and simplicity of a child.  Perhaps no human being was ever\nmore perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or\nfalsehood.\n\nMy transmigration from London to Lausanne could not be effected\nwithout interrupting the course of my historical labours.  The hurry\nof my departure, the joy of my arrival, the delay of my tools,\nsuspended their progress; and a full twelvemonth was lost before I\ncould resume the thread of regular and daily industry.  A number of\nbooks most requisite and least common had been previously selected;\nthe academical library of Lausanne, which I could use as my own,\ncontained at least the fathers and councils; and I have derived some\noccasional succour from the public collections of Berne and Geneva.\nThe fourth volume was soon terminated, by an abstract of the\ncontroversies of the Incarnation, which the learned Dr. Prideaux was\napprehensive of exposing to profane eyes.  It had been the original\ndesign of the learned Dean Prideaux to write the history of the ruin\nof the Eastern Church.  In this work it would have been necessary,\nnot only to unravel all those controversies which the Christians\nmade about the hypostatical union, but also to unfold all the\nniceties and subtle notions which each sect entertained concerning\nit.  The pious historian was apprehensive of exposing that\nincomprehensible mystery to the cavils and objections of\nunbelievers: and he durst not, \"seeing the nature of this book,\nventure it abroad in so wanton and lewd an age\" (Preface to the Life\nof Mahomet, p. 10).\n\nIn the fifth and sixth volumes the revolutions of the empire and the\nworld are most rapid, various, and instructive; and the Greek or\nRoman historians are checked by the hostile narratives of the\nbarbarians of the East and the West.  [Note: I have followed the\njudicious precept of the Abbe de Mably, (Maniere d'ecrire l'Hist.,\np. 110,) who advises the historian not to dwell too minutely on the\ndecay of the eastern empire; but to consider the barbarian\nconquerors as a more worthy subject of his narrative.  \"Fas est et\nab hoste doceri.\"]\n\nIt was not till after many designs, and many trials, that I\npreferred, as I still prefer, the method of grouping my picture by\nnations; and the seeming neglect of chronological order is surely\ncompensated by the superior merits of interest and perspicuity.  The\nstyle of the first volume is, in my opinion, somewhat crude and\nelaborate; in the second and third it is ripened into ease,\ncorrectness, and numbers; but in the three last I may have been\nseduced by the facility of my pen, and the constant habit of\nspeaking one language and writing another may have infused some\nmixture of Gallic idioms.  Happily for my eyes, I have always closed\nmy studies with the day, and commonly with the morning; and a long,\nbut temperate, labour has been accomplished, without fatiguing\neither the mind or body; but when I computed the remainder of my\ntime and my task, it was apparent that, according to the season of\npublication, the delay of a month would be productive of that of a\nyear.  I was now straining for the goal, and in the last winter many\nevenings were borrowed from the social pleasures of Lausanne.  I\ncould now wish that a pause, an interval, had been allowed for a\nserious revisal.\n\nI have presumed to mark the moment of conception: I shall now\ncommemorate the hour of my final deliverance.  It was on the day, or\nrather night, of the 27th of June, 1787, between the hours of eleven\nand twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page, in a\nsummer house in my garden.  After laying down my pen, I took several\nturns in a berceau, or covered walk of acacias, which commands a\nprospect of the country, the lake, and the mountains.  The air was\ntemperate, the sky was serene, the silver orb of the moon was\nreflected from the waters, and all nature was silent.  I will not\ndissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom,\nand, perhaps, the establishment of my fame.  But my pride was soon\nhumbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by the idea\nthat I had taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable\ncompanion, and that whatsoever might be the future fate of my\nHistory, the life of the historian must be short and precarious.  I\nwill add two facts, which have seldom occurred in the composition of\nsix, or at least of five quartos.  1. My first rough manuscript,\nwithout any intermediate copy, has been sent to the press.  2. Not a\nsheet has been seen by any human eyes, excepting those of the author\nand the printer: the faults and the merits are exclusively my own.\n\nI cannot help recollecting a much more extraordinary fact, which is\naffirmed of himself by Retif de la Bretorme, a voluminous and\noriginal writer of French novels.  He laboured, and may still\nlabour, in the humble office of corrector to a printing-house; but\nthis office enabled him to transport an entire volume from his mind\nto the press; and his work was given to the public without ever\nhaving been written with a pen.\n\nAfter a quiet residence of four years, during which I had never\nmoved ten miles from Lausanne, it was not without some reluctance\nand terror, that I undertook, in a journey of two hundred leagues,\nto cross the mountains and the sea.  Yet this formidable adventure\nwas achieved without danger or fatigue; and at the end of a\nfortnight I found myself in Lord Sheffield's house and library,\nsafe, happy, and at home.  The character of my friend (Mr. Holroyd)\nhad recommended him to a seat in parliament for Coventry, the\ncommand of a regiment of light dragoons, and an Irish peerage.  The\nsense and spirit of his political writings have decided the public\nopinion on the great questions of our commercial interest with\nAmerica and Ireland.\n\nThe sale of his Observations on the American States was diffusive,\ntheir effect beneficial; the Navigation Act, the palladium of\nBritain, was defended, and perhaps saved, by his pen; and he proves,\nby the weight of fact and argument, that the mother-country may\nsurvive and flourish after the loss of America.  My friend has never\ncultivated the arts of composition; but his materials are copious\nand correct, and he leaves on his paper the clear impression of an\nactive and vigorous mind.  His \"Observations on the Trade,\nManufactures, and present State of Ireland,\" were intended to guide\nthe industry, to correct the prejudices, and to assuage the passions\nof a country which seemed to forget that she could be free and\nprosperous only by a friendly connection with Great Britain.  The\nconcluding observations are written with so much ease and spirit,\nthat they may be read by those who are the least interested in the\nsubject.\n\nHe fell (in 1784) with the unpopular coalition; but his merit has\nbeen acknowledged at the last general election, 1790, by the\nhonourable invitation and free choice of the city of Bristol.\nDuring the whole time of my residence in England I was entertained\nat Sheffield-Place and in Downing-Street by his hospitable kindness;\nand the most pleasant period was that which I passed in the domestic\nsociety of the family.  In the larger circle of the metropolis I\nobserved the country and the inhabitants with the knowledge, and\nwithout the prejudices, of an Englishman; but I rejoiced in the\napparent increase of wealth and prosperity, which might be fairly\ndivided between the spirit of the nation and the wisdom of the\nminister.  All party-resentment was now lost in oblivion: since I\nwas no man's rival, no man was my enemy.  I felt the dignity of\nindependence, and as I asked no more, I was satisfied with the\ngeneral civilities of the world.  The house in London which I\nfrequented with most pleasure and assiduity was that of Lord North.\nAfter the loss of power and of sight, he was still happy in himself\nand his friends; and my public tribute of gratitude and esteem could\nno longer be suspected of any interested motive.  Before my\ndeparture from England, I was present at the august spectacle of Mr.\nHastings's trial in Westminster Hall.  It is not my province to\nabsolve or condemn the Governor of India; but Mr. Sheridan's\neloquence demanded my applause; nor could I hear without emotion the\npersonal compliment which he paid me in the presence of the British\nnation.\n\nFrom this display of genius, which blazed four successive days, I\nshall stoop to a very mechanical circumstance.  As I was waiting in\nthe managers' box, I had the curiosity to inquire of the short-hand\nwriter, how many words a ready and rapid orator might pronounce in\nan hour? From 7000 to 7500 was his answer.  The medium of 7200 will\nafford 120 words in a minute, and two words in each second.  But\nthis computation will only apply to the English language.\n\nAs the publication of my three last volumes was the principal\nobject, so it was the first care of my English journey.  The\nprevious arrangements with the bookseller and the printer were\nsettled in my passage through London, and the proofs, which I\nreturned more correct, were transmitted every post from the press to\nSheffield-Place.  The length of the operation, and the leisure of\nthe country, allowed some time to review my manuscript.  Several\nrare and useful books, the Assises de Jerusalem, Ramusius de Bello\nConstantinopolitano, the Greek Acts of the Synod of Florence, the\nStatuta Urbis Romae, &c. were procured, and introduced in their\nproper places the supplements which they afforded.  The impression\nof the fourth volume had consumed three months.  Our common interest\nrequired that we should move with a quicker pace; and Mr. Strahan\nfulfilled his engagement, which few printers could sustain, of\ndelivering every week three thousand copies of nine sheets.  The day\nof publication was, however, delayed, that it might coincide with\nthe fifty-first anniversary of my own birthday; the double festival\nwas celebrated by a cheerful literary dinner at Mr. Cadell's house;\nand I seemed to blush while they read an elegant compliment from Mr.\nHayley, whose poetical talents had more than once been employed in\nthe praise of his friend.  Before Mr. Hayley inscribed with my name\nhis epistles on history, I was not acquainted with that amiable man\nand elegant poet.  He afterwards thanked me in verse for my second\nand third volumes; and in the summer of 1781, the Roman Eagle, (a\nproud title) accepted the invitation of the English Sparrow, who\nchirped in the groves of Eartham, near Chichester.  As most of the\nformer purchasers were naturally desirous of completing their sets,\nthe sale of the quarto edition was quick and easy; and an octavo\nsize was printed, to satisfy at a cheaper rate the public demand.\nThe conclusion of my work was generally read, and variously judged.\nThe style has been exposed to much academical criticism; a religious\nclamour was revived, and the reproach of indecency has been loudly\nechoed by the rigid censors of morals.  I never could understand the\nclamour that has been raised against the indecency of my three last\nvolumes.  1. An equal degree of freedom in the former part,\nespecially in the first volume, had passed without reproach.  2. I\nam justified in painting the manners of the times; the vices of\nTheodora form an essential feature in the reign and character of\nJustinian.  3. My English text is chaste, and all licentious\npassages are left in the obscurity of a learned language.  Le Latin\ndans ses mots brave l'honnetete, says the correct Boileau, in a\ncountry and idiom more scrupulous than our own.  Yet, upon the\nwhole, the History of the Decline and Fall seems to have struck\nroot, both at home and abroad, and may, perhaps, a hundred years\nhence still continue to be abused.  I am less flattered by Mr.\nPorson's high encomium on the style and spirit of my history, than I\nam satisfied with his honourable testimony to my attention,\ndiligence, and accuracy; those humble virtues, which religious zeal\nhad most audaciously denied.  The sweetness of his praise is\ntempered by a reasonable mixture of acid.  As the book may not be\ncommon in England, I shall transcribe my own character from the\nBibliotheca Historica of Meuselius, a learned and laborious German.\n\"Summis aevi nostri historicis Gibbonus sine dubio adnumerandus est.\nInter capitolii ruinas stans primum hujus operis scribendi concilium\ncepit.  Florentissimos vitae annos colligendo et laborando eidem\nimpendit.  Enatum inde monumentum aere perennius, licet passim\nappareant sinistre dicta, minus perfecta, veritati non satis\nconsentanea.  Videmus quidem ubique fere studium scrutandi\nveritatemque scribendi maximum: tamen sine Tillemontio duce ubi\nscilicet hujus historia finitur saepius noster titubat atque\nhallucinatur.

The first volume had been\nfeebly, though faithfully, translated into French by M. Le Clerc de\nSeptchenes, a young gentleman of a studious character and liberal\nfortune.  After his decease the work was continued by two\nmanufacturers of Paris, M. M. Desmuniers and Cantwell: but the\nformer is now an active member in the national assembly, and the\nundertaking languishes in the hands of his associate.  The superior\nmerit of the interpreter, or his language, inclines me to prefer the\nItalian version: but I wish that it were in my power to read the\nGerman, which is praised by the best judges.  The Irish pirates are\nat once my friends and my enemies,   But I cannot be displeased with\nthe too numerous and correct impressions which have been published\nfor the use of the continent at Basil in Switzerland. [Note: Of\ntheir 14 8vo. vols. the two last include the whole body of the\nnotes.  The public importunity had forced me to remove them from the\nend of the volume to the bottom of the page; but I have often\nrepented of my compliance.] The conquests of our language and\nliterature are not confined to Europe alone, and a writer who\nsucceeds in London, is speedily read on the banks of the Delaware\nand the Ganges.\n\nIn the preface of the fourth volume, while I gloried in the name of\nan Englishman, I announced my approaching return to the\nneighbourhood of the Lake of Lausanne.  This last trial confirmed my\nassurance that I had wisely chosen for my own happiness; nor did I\nonce, in a year's visit, entertain a wish of settling in my native\ncountry.  Britain is the free and fortunate island; but where is the\nspot in which I could unite the comforts and beauties of my\nestablishment at Lausanne? The tumult of London astonished my eyes\nand ears; the amusements of public places were no longer adequate to\nthe trouble; the clubs and assemblies were filled with new faces and\nyoung men; and our best society, our long and late dinners, would\nsoon have been prejudicial to my health.  Without any share in the\npolitical wheel, I must be idle and insignificant: yet the most\nsplendid temptations would not have enticed me to engage a second\ntime in the servitude of Parliament or office.  At Tunbridge, some\nweeks after the publication of my History, I reluctantly quitted\nLord and Lady Sheffield, and, with a young Swiss friend, M. Wilhelm.\nde Severy, whom I had introduced to the English world, I pursued the\nroad of Dover and Lausanne.  My habitation was embellished in my\nabsence, and the last division of books, which followed my steps,\nincreased my chosen library to the number of between six and seven\nthousand volumes.  My seraglio was ample, my choice was free, my\nappetite was keen.  After a full repast on Homer and Aristophanes, I\ninvolved myself in the philosophic maze of the writings of Plato, of\nwhich the dramatic is, perhaps, more interesting than the\nargumentative part: but I stepped aside into every path of inquiry\nwhich reading or reflection accidentally opened.\n\nAlas! the joy of my return, and my studious ardour, were soon damped\nby the melancholy state of my friend Mr. Deyverdun.  His health and\nspirits had long suffered a gradual decline, a succession of\napoplectic fits announced his dissolution; and before he expired,\nthose who loved him could not wish for the continuance of his life.\nThe voice of reason might congratulate his deliverance, but the\nfeelings of nature and friendship could be subdued only by time: his\namiable character was still alive in my remembrance; each room, each\nwalk, was imprinted with our common footsteps; and I should blush at\nmy own philosophy, if a long interval of study had not preceded and\nfollowed the death of my friend.  By his last will he left to me the\noption of purchasing his house and garden, or of possessing them\nduring my life, on the payment either of a stipulated price, or of\nan easy retribution to his kinsman and heir.  I should probably have\nbeen tempted by the daemon of property, if some legal difficulties\nhad not been started against my title; a contest would have been\nvexatious, doubtful, and invidious; and the heir most gratefully\nsubscribed an agreement, which rendered my life-possession more\nperfect, and his future condition more advantageous.  Yet I had\noften revolved the judicious lines in which Pope answers the\nobjections of his longsighted friend:\n\n          Pity to build without or child or wife;\n          Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life\n          Well, if the use be mine, does it concern one,\n          Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?\n\nThe certainty of my tenure has allowed me to lay out a considerable\nsum in improvements and alterations: they have been executed with\nskill and taste; and few men of letters, perhaps, in Europe, are so\ndesirably lodged as myself.  But I feel, and with the decline of\nyears I shall more painfully feel, that I am alone in Paradise.\nAmong the circle of my acquaintance at Lausanne, I have gradually\nacquired the solid and tender friendship of a respectable family,\nthe family of de Severy: the four persons of whom it is composed are\nall endowed with the virtues best adapted to their age and\nsituation; and I am encouraged to love the parents as a brother, and\nthe children as a father.  Every day we seek and find the\nopportunities of meeting: yet even this valuable connection cannot\nsupply the loss of domestic society.\n\nWithin the last two or three years our tranquillity has been clouded\nby the disorders of France: many families at Lausanne were alarmed\nand affected by the terrors of an impending bankruptcy; but the\nrevolution, or rather the dissolution of the kingdom has been heard\nand felt in the adjacent lands.\n\nI beg leave to subscribe my assent to Mr. Burke's creed on the\nrevolution of France.  I admire his eloquence, I approve his\npolitics, I adore his chivalry, and I can almost excuse his\nreverence for church establishments.  I have sometimes thought of\nwriting a dialogue of the dead, in which Lucian, Erasmus, and\nVoltaire should mutually acknowledge the danger of exposing an old\nsuperstition to the contempt of the blind and fanatic multitude.\n\nA swarm of emigrants of both sexes, who escaped from the public\nruin, has been attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the\nlanguage of Lausanne; and our narrow habitations in town and country\nare now occupied by the first names and titles of the departed\nmonarchy.  These noble fugitives are entitled to our pity; they may\nclaim our esteem, but they cannot, in their present state of mind\nand fortune, much contribute to our amusement.  Instead of looking\ndown as calm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our\ndomestic harmony is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party\nspirit: our ladies and gentlemen assume the character of self-taught\npoliticians; and the sober dictates of wisdom and experience are\nsilenced by the clamour of the triumphant democrates.  The fanatic\nmissionaries of sedition have scattered the seeds of discontent in\nour cities and villages, which had flourished above two hundred and\nfifty years without fearing the approach of war, or feeling the\nweight of government.  Many individuals, and some communities,\nappear to be infested with the Gallic phrenzy, the wild theories of\nequal and boundless freedom; but I trust that the body of the people\nwill be faithful to their sovereign and to themselves; and I am\nsatisfied that the failure or success of a revolt would equally\nterminate in the ruin of the country.  While the aristocracy of\nBerne protects the happiness, it is superfluous to enquire whether\nit be founded in the rights of man: the oeconomy of the state is\nliberally supplied without the aid of taxes; and the magistrates\nmust reign with prudence and equity, since they are unarmed in the\nmidst of an armed nation.\n\nThe revenue of Berne, excepting some small duties, is derived from\nchurch lands, tithes, feudal rights, and interest of money.  The\nrepublic has nearly 500,000 pounds sterling in the English funds,\nand the amount of their treasure is unknown to the citizens\nthemselves.  For myself (may the omen be averted) I can only\ndeclare, that the first stroke of a rebel drum would be the signal\nof my immediate departure.\n\nWhen I contemplate the common lot of mortality, I must acknowledge\nthat I have drawn a high prize in the lottery of life.  The far\ngreater part of the globe is overspread with barbarism or slavery:\nin the civilized world, the most numerous class is condemned to\nignorance and poverty; and the double fortune of my birth in a free\nand enlightened country, in an honourable and wealthy family, is the\nlucky chance of an unit against millions.  The general probability\nis about three to one, that a new-born infant will not live to\ncomplete his fiftieth year.  [Note: Buffon, Supplement a l'Hist.\nnaturelle, vii. p, 158-164, of a given number of new-born infants,\none half, by the fault of nature or man, is extinguished before the\nage of puberty and reason,--a melancholy calculation!]  I have now\npassed that age, and may fairly estimate the present value of my\nexistence in the three-fold division of mind, body, and estate.\n\n1. The first and indispensable requisite of happiness is a clear\nconscience, unsullied by the reproach or remembrance of an unworthy\naction.\n\n                    --Hic murus aheneus esto,\n          Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.\n\nI am endowed with a cheerful temper, a moderate sensibility, and a\nnatural disposition to repose rather than to activity: some\nmischievous appetites and habits have perhaps been corrected by\nphilosophy or time.  The love of study, a passion which derives\nfresh vigour from enjoyment, supplies each day, each hour, with a\nperpetual source of independent and rational pleasure; and I am not\nsensible of any decay of the mental faculties.  The original soil\nhas been highly improved by cultivation; but it may be questioned,\nwhether some flowers of fancy, some grateful errors, have not been\neradicated with the weeds of prejudice.  2. Since I have escaped\nfrom the long perils of my childhood, the serious advice of a\nphysician has seldom been requisite.  \"The madness of superfluous\nhealth\" I have never known; but my tender constitution has been\nfortified by time, and the inestimable gift of the sound and\npeaceful slumbers of infancy may be imputed both to the mind and\nbody.  3. I have already described the merits of my society and\nsituation; but these enjoyments would be tasteless or bitter if\ntheir possession were not assured by an annual and adequate supply.\nAccording to the scale of Switzerland, I am a rich man; and I am\nindeed rich, since my income is superior to my expence, and my\nexpence is equal to my wishes.  My friend Lord Sheffield has kindly\nrelieved me from the cares to which my taste and temper are most\nadverse: shall I add, that since the failure of my first wishes, I\nhave never entertained any serious thoughts of a matrimonial\nconnection?\n\nI am disgusted with the affectation of men of letters, who complain\nthat they have renounced a substance for a shadow; and that their\nfame (which sometimes is no insupportable weight) affords a poor\ncompensation for envy, censure, and persecution.  [Note: M.\nd'Alembert relates, that as he was walking in the gardens of Sans\nSouci with the King of Prussia, Frederic said to him, \"Do you see\nthat old woman, a poor weeder, asleep on that sunny bank? she is\nprobably a more happy being than either of us.\"  The king and the\nphilosopher may speak for themselves; for my part I do not envy the\nold woman.]  My own experience, at least, has taught me a very\ndifferent lesson: twenty happy years have been animated by the\nlabour of my History; and its success has given me a name, a rank, a\ncharacter, in the world, to which I should not otherwise have been\nentitled.  The freedom of my writings has indeed provoked an\nimplacable tribe; but, as I was safe from the stings, I was soon\naccustomed to the buzzing of the hornets: my nerves are not\ntremblingly alive, and my literary temper is so happily framed, that\nI am less sensible of pain than of pleasure.  The rational pride of\nan author may be offended, rather than flattered, by vague\nindiscriminate praise; but he cannot, he should not, be indifferent\nto the fair testimonies of private and public esteem.  Even his\nmoral sympathy may be gratified by the idea, that now, in the\npresent hour, he is imparting some degree of amusement or knowledge\nto his friends in a distant land: that one day his mind will be\nfamiliar to the grand-children of those who are yet unborn.  I\ncannot boast of the friendship or favour of princes; the patronage\nof English literature has long since been devolved on our\nbooksellers, and the measure of their liberality is the least\nambiguous test of our common success.  Perhaps the golden mediocrity\nof my fortune has contributed to fortify my application.\n\nThe present is a fleeting moment, the past is no more; and our\nprospect of futurity is dark and doubtful.  This day may possibly be\nmy last: but the laws of probability, so true in general, so\nfallacious in particular, still allow about fifteen years. [Mr.\nBuffon, from our disregard of the possibility of death within the\nfour and twenty hours, concludes that a chance, which falls below or\nrises above ten thousand to one, will never affect the hopes or\nfears of a reasonable man.  The fact is true, but our courage is the\neffect of thoughtlessness, rather than of reflection.  If a public\nlottery were drawn for, the choice of an immediate victim, and if\nour name were inscribed on ore of the ten thousand tickets, should\nwe be perfectly easy?]  I shall soon enter into the period which, as\nthe most agreeable of my long life, was selected by the judgment and\nexperience of the sage Fontenelle.  His choice is approved by the\neloquent historian of nature, who fixes our moral happiness to the\nmature season in which our passions are supposed to be calmed, our\nduties fulfilled, our ambition satisfied, our fame and fortune\nestablished on a solid basis (see Buffon).  In private conversation,\nthat great and amiable man added the weight of his own experience;\nand this autumnal felicity might be exemplified in the lives of\nVoltaire, Hume, and many other men of letters.  I am far more\ninclined to embrace than to dispute this comfortable doctrine.  I\nwill not suppose any premature decay of the mind or body; but I must\nreluctantly observe that two causes, the abbreviation of time, and\nthe failure of hope, will always tinge with a browner shade the\nevening of life.\n\n\n[POSTSCRIPT by Lord Sheffield]\nWHEN I first undertook to prepare Mr. Gibbon's Memoirs for the\nPress, I supposed that it would be necessary to introduce some\ncontinuation of them, from the time when they cease, namely, soon\nafter his return to Switzerland in the year 1788; but the\nexamination of his correspondence with me suggested, that the best\ncontinuation would be the publication of his letters from that time\nto his death.  I shall thus give more satisfaction, by employing the\nlanguage of Mr. Gibbon, instead of my own; and the public will see\nhim in a new and (I think) an admirable light, as a writer of\nletters.  By the insertion of a few occasional sentences, I shall\nobviate the disadvantages that are apt to arise from an interrupted\nnarration.  A prejudiced or a fastidious critic may condemn,\nperhaps, some parts of the letters as trivial; but many readers, I\nflatter myself, will be gratified by discovering even in these my\nfriend's affectionate feelings, and his character in familiar life.\nHis letters in general bear a strong resemblance to the style and\nturn of his conversation; the characteristics of which were\nvivacity, elegance, and precision, with knowledge astonishingly\nextensive and correct.  He never ceased to be instructive and\nentertaining; and in general there was a vein of pleasantry in his\nconversation which prevented its becoming languid, even during a\nresidence of many months with a family in the country.\n\nIt has been supposed that he always arranged what he intended to\nsay, before he spoke; his quickness in conversation contradicts this\nnotion: but it is very true, that before he sat down to write a note\nor letter, he completely arranged in his mind what he meant to\nexpress.  He pursued the same method in respect to other\ncomposition; and he occasionally would walk several times about his\napartment before he had rounded a period to his taste.  He has\npleasantly remarked to me, that it sometimes cost him many a turn\nbefore he could throw a sentiment into a form that gratified his own\ncriticism.  His systematic habit of arrangement in point of style,\nassisted, in his instance, by an excellent memory and correct\njudgment, is much to be recommended to those who aspire to any\nperfection in writing.\n\nAlthough the Memoirs extend beyond the time of Mr. Gibbon's return\nto Lausanne, I shall insert a few Letters, written immediately after\nhis arrival there, and combine them so far as to include even the\nlast note which he wrote a few days previously to his death.  Some\nof them contain few incidents; but they connect and carry on the\naccount either of his opinions or of his employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Memoirs of My Life and Writings, by Edward Gibbon\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MEMOIRS OF MY LIFE AND WRITINGS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6031.txt or 6031.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/0\/3\/6031\/\n\nProduced by P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1051,"split":"train"}
