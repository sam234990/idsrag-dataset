The gender of the narrator is never known, but it is evident that the narrator is a middle class observer. As the narrator looks out the windowpane, an old story comes to mind; a story of the house that the narrator is living in. The narrator cautions the reader to have an objective mind, and to not be quick to judge the character in the story he\/she is about to tell the reader. The narrator begins to introduce Deborah, Wolfe's cousin. She is described as a meek woman who works hard, and has a hump in her back. Deborah finds out from Janey, that Hugh did not take lunch to work, and she decides to walk many miles in the rain to take a lunch for Wolfe. As she walks up to the mills, Deborah begins to describe it as if it were hell, but she keeps going for Wolfe. When she arrives Wolfe is talking amongst friends and he recognizes her. The narrator explains his affection for her, but also describes his affection as loveless and sympathetic. Hugh finds no time to eat his dinner and goes back to do a day of labor in the mills. Deborah, who is exhausted, stays with Hugh and rests until his shift is over. In the meantime, the narrator further explains that Wolfe does not belong in the environment of the iron mill workers. He is known as \"Molly Wolfe\" by other workers because of his manner and background in education.\nWhen Wolfe is working he spots men that do not look like workers. He sees Clarke, the son of Kirby, Doctor May who is a physician, and another two men that he does not recognize. These men stop by to look at the working men, and as they are talking and observing, they spot a weird object that has the shape of a human. As they get closer, they see that it is an odd shaped statue built with korl. They begin to analyze it and wonder who created such a statue, one of the workers points at Wolfe and the men go to him. They ask him why he built such a statue and what it represents. All Hugh says is that \"She be hungry\". The men begin to talk about the injustice of labor force, and one goes as far as to say that Hugh can get out of the meager job he is in, but that he unfortunately cannot help. The men leave, but not before Deborah steals one of their wallets, which has a check for a substantial amount inside. They go back home and Wolfe feels like he is a failure and feels anger towards his economical situation.\nOnce home, Deborah confesses to stealing from Mitchell, and shamefully gives the money to Wolfe to do with it what he pleases. Wolfe decides to keep the money believing he is deserving of it because after all they are all deserving in God's eyes. The narrator transitions to a different scene with Dr. May reading the newspaper and seeing that Wolfe was put in jail for stealing from Mitchell. The story goes back to Hugh and he is in prison with Deborah. The narrator explains how terrible their situation is, and goes on to give detail of Wolfe's mental disintegration. Hugh ends up losing his mind and killing himself in prison. The story ends with a quaker woman who comes to bless and help with the body of Hugh. She talks to Deborah and promises her that she will give Hugh a proper burial, and come back for her when she is released from jail.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Life in the Iron-Mills, by Rebecca Harding Davis\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The sky\nsank down before dawn, muddy, flat, immovable. The air is thick, clammy\nwith the breath of crowded human beings. It stifles me. I open the\nwindow, and, looking out, can scarcely see through the rain the grocer's\nshop opposite, where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing Lynchburg\ntobacco in their pipes. I can detect the scent through all the foul\nsmells ranging loose in the air.\n\nThe idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke. It rolls sullenly in slow folds\nfrom the great chimneys of the iron-foundries, and settles down in\nblack, slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves, smoke on\nthe dingy boats, on the yellow river,--clinging in a coating of greasy\nsoot to the house-front, the two faded poplars, the faces of the\npassers-by. The long train of mules, dragging masses of pig-iron through\nthe narrow street, have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides.\nHere, inside, is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from\nthe mantel-shelf; but even its wings are covered with smoke, clotted\nand black. Smoke everywhere! A dirty canary chirps desolately in a\ncage beside me. Its dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old\ndream,--almost worn out, I think.\n\nFrom the back-window I can see a narrow brick-yard sloping down to\nthe river-side, strewed with rain-butts and tubs. The river, dull and\ntawny-colored, (la belle riviere!) drags itself sluggishly along, tired\nof the heavy weight of boats and coal-barges. What wonder? When I was a\nchild, I used to fancy a look of weary, dumb appeal upon the face of the\nnegro-like river slavishly bearing its burden day after day. Something\nof the same idle notion comes to me to-day, when from the street-window\nI look on the slow stream of human life creeping past, night and\nmorning, to the great mills. Masses of men, with dull, besotted faces\nbent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin\nand muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes; stooping all night\nover boiling caldrons of metal, laired by day in dens of drunkenness and\ninfamy; breathing from infancy to death an air saturated with fog and\ngrease and soot, vileness for soul and body. What do you make of a case\nlike that, amateur psychologist? You call it an altogether serious thing\nto be alive: to these men it is a drunken jest, a joke,--horrible to\nangels perhaps, to them commonplace enough. My fancy about the river was\nan idle one: it is no type of such a life. What if it be stagnant and\nslimy here? It knows that beyond there waits for it odorous sunlight,\nquaint old gardens, dusky with soft, green foliage of apple-trees, and\nflushing crimson with roses,--air, and fields, and mountains. The future\nof the Welsh puddler passing just now is not so pleasant. To be stowed\naway, after his grimy work is done, in a hole in the muddy graveyard,\nand after that, not air, nor green fields, nor curious roses.\n\nCan you see how foggy the day is? As I stand here, idly tapping the\nwindowpane, and looking out through the rain at the dirty back-yard and\nthe coalboats below, fragments of an old story float up before me,--a\nstory of this house into which I happened to come to-day. You may think\nit a tiresome story enough, as foggy as the day, sharpened by no sudden\nflashes of pain or pleasure.--I know: only the outline of a dull life,\nthat long since, with thousands of dull lives like its own, was vainly\nlived and lost: thousands of them, massed, vile, slimy lives, like those\nof the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water-butt.--Lost? There is a\ncurious point for you to settle, my friend, who study psychology in a\nlazy, dilettante way. Stop a moment. I am going to be honest. This is\nwhat I want you to do. I want you to hide your disgust, take no heed\nto your clean clothes, and come right down with me,--here, into the\nthickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia. I want you to hear this\nstory. There is a secret down here, in this nightmare fog, that has lain\ndumb for centuries: I want to make it a real thing to you. You, Egoist,\nor Pantheist, or Arminian, busy in making straight paths for your feet\non the hills, do not see it clearly,--this terrible question which men\nhere have gone mad and died trying to answer. I dare not put this secret\ninto words. I told you it was dumb. These men, going by with drunken\nfaces and brains full of unawakened power, do not ask it of Society or\nof God. Their lives ask it; their deaths ask it. There is no reply. I\nwill tell you plainly that I have a great hope; and I bring it to you\nto be tested. It is this: that this terrible dumb question is its own\nreply; that it is not the sentence of death we think it, but, from the\nvery extremity of its darkness, the most solemn prophecy which the world\nhas known of the Hope to come. I dare make my meaning no clearer, but\nwill only tell my story. It will, perhaps, seem to you as foul and dark\nas this thick vapor about us, and as pregnant with death; but if your\neyes are free as mine are to look deeper, no perfume-tinted dawn will be\nso fair with promise of the day that shall surely come.\n\nMy story is very simple,--Only what I remember of the life of one\nof these men,--a furnace-tender in one of Kirby & John's\nrolling-mills,--Hugh Wolfe. You know the mills? They took the great\norder for the lower Virginia railroads there last winter; run usually\nwith about a thousand men. I cannot tell why I choose the half-forgotten\nstory of this Wolfe more than that of myriads of these furnace-hands.\nPerhaps because there is a secret, underlying sympathy between that\nstory and this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshine,--or\nperhaps simply for the reason that this house is the one where the\nWolfes lived. There were the father and son,--both hands, as I said,\nin one of Kirby & John's mills for making railroad-iron,--and Deborah,\ntheir cousin, a picker in some of the cotton-mills. The house was rented\nthen to half a dozen families. The Wolfes had two of the cellar-rooms.\nThe old man, like many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills, was\nWelsh,--had spent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines. You may\npick the Welsh emigrants, Cornish miners, out of the throng passing the\nwindows, any day. They are a trifle more filthy; their muscles are not\nso brawny; they stoop more. When they are drunk, they neither yell, nor\nshout, nor stagger, but skulk along like beaten hounds. A pure,\nunmixed blood, I fancy: shows itself in the slight angular bodies and\nsharply-cut facial lines. It is nearly thirty years since the Wolfes\nlived here. Their lives were like those of their class: incessant\nlabor, sleeping in kennel-like rooms, eating rank pork and molasses,\ndrinking--God and the distillers only know what; with an occasional\nnight in jail, to atone for some drunken excess. Is that all of their\nlives?--of the portion given to them and these their duplicates swarming\nthe streets to-day?--nothing beneath?--all? So many a political reformer\nwill tell you,--and many a private reformer, too, who has gone among\nthem with a heart tender with Christ's charity, and come out outraged,\nhardened.\n\nOne rainy night, about eleven o'clock, a crowd of half-clothed women\nstopped outside of the cellar-door. They were going home from the\ncotton-mill.\n\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" said one, a mulatto, steadying herself against the\ngas-post. She needed the post to steady her. So did more than one of\nthem.\n\n\"Dah's a ball to Miss Potts' to-night. Ye'd best come.\"\n\n\"Inteet, Deb, if hur'll come, hur'll hef fun,\" said a shrill Welsh voice\nin the crowd.\n\nTwo or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman,\nwho was groping for the latch of the door.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No? Where's Kit Small, then?\"\n\n\"Begorra! on the spools. Alleys behint, though we helped her, we dud.\nAn wid ye! Let Deb alone! It's ondacent frettin' a quite body. Be the\npowers, an we'll have a night of it! there'll be lashin's o' drink,--the\nVargent be blessed and praised for't!\"\n\nThey went on, the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight, and drag\nthe woman Wolfe off with them; but, being pacified, she staggered away.\n\nDeborah groped her way into the cellar, and, after considerable\nstumbling, kindled a match, and lighted a tallow dip, that sent a yellow\nglimmer over the room. It was low, damp,--the earthen floor covered with\na green, slimy moss,--a fetid air smothering the breath. Old Wolfe lay\nasleep on a heap of straw, wrapped in a torn horse-blanket. He was a\npale, meek little man, with a white face and red rabbit-eyes. The woman\nDeborah was like him; only her face was even more ghastly, her lips\nbluer, her eyes more watery. She wore a faded cotton gown and a\nslouching bonnet. When she walked, one could see that she was deformed,\nalmost a hunchback. She trod softly, so as not to waken him, and went\nthrough into the room beyond. There she found by the half-extinguished\nfire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes, which she put\nupon a broken chair with a pint-cup of ale. Placing the old candlestick\nbeside this dainty repast, she untied her bonnet, which hung limp and\nwet over her face, and prepared to eat her supper. It was the first\nfood that had touched her lips since morning. There was enough of it,\nhowever: there is not always. She was hungry,--one could see that easily\nenough,--and not drunk, as most of her companions would have been\nfound at this hour. She did not drink, this woman,--her face told that,\ntoo,--nothing stronger than ale. Perhaps the weak, flaccid wretch had\nsome stimulant in her pale life to keep her up,--some love or hope, it\nmight be, or urgent need. When that stimulant was gone, she would take\nto whiskey. Man cannot live by work alone. While she was skinning the\npotatoes, and munching them, a noise behind her made her stop.\n\n\"Janey!\" she called, lifting the candle and peering into the darkness.\n\"Janey, are you there?\"\n\nA heap of ragged coats was heaved up, and the face of a young girl\nemerged, staring sleepily at the woman.\n\n\"Deborah,\" she said, at last, \"I'm here the night.\"\n\n\"Yes, child. Hur's welcome,\" she said, quietly eating on.\n\nThe girl's face was haggard and sickly; her eyes were heavy with sleep\nand hunger: real Milesian eyes they were, dark, delicate blue, glooming\nout from black shadows with a pitiful fright.\n\n\"I was alone,\" she said, timidly.\n\n\"Where's the father?\" asked Deborah, holding out a potato, which the\ngirl greedily seized.\n\n\"He's beyant,--wid Haley,--in the stone house.\" (Did you ever hear the\nword tail from an Irish mouth?) \"I came here. Hugh told me never to stay\nme-lone.\"\n\n\"Hugh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA vexed frown crossed her face. The girl saw it, and added quickly,--\n\n\"I have not seen Hugh the day, Deb. The old man says his watch lasts\ntill the mornin'.\"\n\nThe woman sprang up, and hastily began to arrange some bread and flitch\nin a tin pail, and to pour her own measure of ale into a bottle. Tying\non her bonnet, she blew out the candle.\n\n\"Lay ye down, Janey dear,\" she said, gently, covering her with the old\nrags. \"Hur can eat the potatoes, if hur's hungry.\n\n\"Where are ye goin', Deb? The rain's sharp.\"\n\n\"To the mill, with Hugh's supper.\"\n\n\"Let him bide till th' morn. Sit ye down.\"\n\n\"No, no,\"--sharply pushing her off. \"The boy'll starve.\"\n\nShe hurried from the cellar, while the child wearily coiled herself up\nfor sleep. The rain was falling heavily, as the woman, pail in hand,\nemerged from the mouth of the alley, and turned down the narrow street,\nthat stretched out, long and black, miles before her. Here and there a\nflicker of gas lighted an uncertain space of muddy footwalk and gutter;\nthe long rows of houses, except an occasional lager-bier shop, were\nclosed; now and then she met a band of millhands skulking to or from\ntheir work.\n\nNot many even of the inhabitants of a manufacturing town know the vast\nmachinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed, that\ngoes on unceasingly from year to year. The hands of each mill are\ndivided into watches that relieve each other as regularly as the\nsentinels of an army. By night and day the work goes on, the unsleeping\nengines groan and shriek, the fiery pools of metal boil and surge. Only\nfor a day in the week, in half-courtesy to public censure, the fires are\npartially veiled; but as soon as the clock strikes midnight, the great\nfurnaces break forth with renewed fury, the clamor begins with fresh,\nbreathless vigor, the engines sob and shriek like \"gods in pain.\"\n\nAs Deborah hurried down through the heavy rain, the noise of these\nthousand engines sounded through the sleep and shadow of the city like\nfar-off thunder. The mill to which she was going lay on the river, a\nmile below the city-limits. It was far, and she was weak, aching from\nstanding twelve hours at the spools. Yet it was her almost nightly walk\nto take this man his supper, though at every square she sat down to\nrest, and she knew she should receive small word of thanks.\n\nPerhaps, if she had possessed an artist's eye, the picturesque oddity\nof the scene might have made her step stagger less, and the path seem\nshorter; but to her the mills were only \"summat deilish to look at by\nnight.\"\n\nThe road leading to the mills had been quarried from the solid rock,\nwhich rose abrupt and bare on one side of the cinder-covered road, while\nthe river, sluggish and black, crept past on the other. The mills for\nrolling iron are simply immense tent-like roofs, covering acres of\nground, open on every side. Beneath these roofs Deborah looked in on a\ncity of fires, that burned hot and fiercely in the night. Fire in every\nhorrible form: pits of flame waving in the wind; liquid metal-flames\nwrithing in tortuous streams through the sand; wide caldrons filled\nwith boiling fire, over which bent ghastly wretches stirring the\nstrange brewing; and through all, crowds of half-clad men, looking\nlike revengeful ghosts in the red light, hurried, throwing masses of\nglittering fire. It was like a street in Hell. Even Deborah muttered, as\nshe crept through, \"looks like t' Devil's place!\" It did,--in more ways\nthan one.\n\nShe found the man she was looking for, at last, heaping coal on a\nfurnace. He had not time to eat his supper; so she went behind the\nfurnace, and waited. Only a few men were with him, and they noticed her\nonly by a \"Hyur comes t'hunchback, Wolfe.\"\n\nDeborah was stupid with sleep; her back pained her sharply; and her\nteeth chattered with cold, with the rain that soaked her clothes and\ndripped from her at every step. She stood, however, patiently holding\nthe pail, and waiting.\n\n\"Hout, woman! ye look like a drowned cat. Come near to the fire,\"--said\none of the men, approaching to scrape away the ashes.\n\nShe shook her head. Wolfe had forgotten her. He turned, hearing the man,\nand came closer.\n\n\"I did no' think; gi' me my supper, woman.\"\n\nShe watched him eat with a painful eagerness. With a woman's quick\ninstinct, she saw that he was not hungry,--was eating to please her. Her\npale, watery eyes began to gather a strange light.\n\n\"Is't good, Hugh? T' ale was a bit sour, I feared.\"\n\n\"No, good enough.\" He hesitated a moment. \"Ye're tired, poor lass! Bide\nhere till I go. Lay down there on that heap of ash, and go to sleep.\"\n\nHe threw her an old coat for a pillow, and turned to his work. The\nheap was the refuse of the burnt iron, and was not a hard bed; the\nhalf-smothered warmth, too, penetrated her limbs, dulling their pain and\ncold shiver.\n\nMiserable enough she looked, lying there on the ashes like a limp,\ndirty rag,--yet not an unfitting figure to crown the scene of hopeless\ndiscomfort and veiled crime: more fitting, if one looked deeper into the\nheart of things, at her thwarted woman's form, her colorless life, her\nwaking stupor that smothered pain and hunger,--even more fit to be a\ntype of her class. Deeper yet if one could look, was there nothing worth\nreading in this wet, faded thing, halfcovered with ashes? no story of a\nsoul filled with groping passionate love, heroic unselfishness, fierce\njealousy? of years of weary trying to please the one human being whom\nshe loved, to gain one look of real heart-kindness from him? If\nanything like this were hidden beneath the pale, bleared eyes, and dull,\nwashed-out-looking face, no one had ever taken the trouble to read its\nfaint signs: not the half-clothed furnace-tender, Wolfe, certainly. Yet\nhe was kind to her: it was his nature to be kind, even to the very rats\nthat swarmed in the cellar: kind to her in just the same way. She knew\nthat. And it might be that very knowledge had given to her face its\napathy and vacancy more than her low, torpid life. One sees that\ndead, vacant look steal sometimes over the rarest, finest of women's\nfaces,--in the very midst, it may be, of their warmest summer's day; and\nthen one can guess at the secret of intolerable solitude that lies hid\nbeneath the delicate laces and brilliant smile. There was no warmth, no\nbrilliancy, no summer for this woman; so the stupor and vacancy had time\nto gnaw into her face perpetually. She was young, too, though no one\nguessed it; so the gnawing was the fiercer.\n\nShe lay quiet in the dark corner, listening, through the monotonous din\nand uncertain glare of the works, to the dull plash of the rain in the\nfar distance, shrinking back whenever the man Wolfe happened to look\ntowards her. She knew, in spite of all his kindness, that there was that\nin her face and form which made him loathe the sight of her. She felt by\ninstinct, although she could not comprehend it, the finer nature of\nthe man, which made him among his fellow-workmen something unique, set\napart. She knew, that, down under all the vileness and coarseness of his\nlife, there was a groping passion for whatever was beautiful and pure,\nthat his soul sickened with disgust at her deformity, even when his\nwords were kindest. Through this dull consciousness, which never left\nher, came, like a sting, the recollection of the dark blue eyes and\nlithe figure of the little Irish girl she had left in the cellar. The\nrecollection struck through even her stupid intellect with a vivid glow\nof beauty and of grace. Little Janey, timid, helpless, clinging to Hugh\nas her only friend: that was the sharp thought, the bitter thought, that\ndrove into the glazed eyes a fierce light of pain. You laugh at it? Are\npain and jealousy less savage realities down here in this place I am\ntaking you to than in your own house or your own heart,--your heart,\nwhich they clutch at sometimes? The note is the same, I fancy, be the\noctave high or low.\n\nIf you could go into this mill where Deborah lay, and drag out from the\nhearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives, taking it as a\nsymptom of the disease of their class, no ghost Horror would terrify\nyou more. A reality of soul-starvation, of living death, that meets you\nevery day under the besotted faces on the street,--I can paint nothing\nof this, only give you the outside outlines of a night, a crisis in the\nlife of one man: whatever muddy depth of soul-history lies beneath you\ncan read according to the eyes God has given you.\n\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him as a spaniel its master, bent over the\nfurnace with his iron pole, unconscious of her scrutiny, only stopping\nto receive orders. Physically, Nature had promised the man but little.\nHe had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man, his\nmuscles were thin, his nerves weak, his face ( a meek, woman's face)\nhaggard, yellow with consumption. In the mill he was known as one of\nthe girl-men: \"Molly Wolfe\" was his sobriquet. He was never seen in\nthe cockpit, did not own a terrier, drank but seldom; when he did,\ndesperately. He fought sometimes, but was always thrashed, pommelled to\na jelly. The man was game enough, when his blood was up: but he was no\nfavorite in the mill; he had the taint of school-learning on him,--not\nto a dangerous extent, only a quarter or so in the free-school in fact,\nbut enough to ruin him as a good hand in a fight.\n\nFor other reasons, too, he was not popular. Not one of themselves, they\nfelt that, though outwardly as filthy and ash-covered; silent, with\nforeign thoughts and longings breaking out through his quietness in\ninnumerable curious ways: this one, for instance. In the neighboring\nfurnace-buildings lay great heaps of the refuse from the ore after the\npig-metal is run. Korl we call it here: a light, porous substance, of\na delicate, waxen, flesh-colored tinge. Out of the blocks of this korl,\nWolfe, in his off-hours from the furnace, had a habit of chipping and\nmoulding figures,--hideous, fantastic enough, but sometimes strangely\nbeautiful: even the mill-men saw that, while they jeered at him. It was\na curious fancy in the man, almost a passion. The few hours for rest he\nspent hewing and hacking with his blunt knife, never speaking, until his\nwatch came again,--working at one figure for months, and, when it was\nfinished, breaking it to pieces perhaps, in a fit of disappointment. A\nmorbid, gloomy man, untaught, unled, left to feed his soul in grossness\nand crime, and hard, grinding labor.\n\nI want you to come down and look at this Wolfe, standing there among the\nlowest of his kind, and see him just as he is, that you may judge him\njustly when you hear the story of this night. I want you to look back,\nas he does every day, at his birth in vice, his starved infancy; to\nremember the heavy years he has groped through as boy and man,--the\nslow, heavy years of constant, hot work. So long ago he began, that he\nthinks sometimes he has worked there for ages. There is no hope that it\nwill ever end. Think that God put into this man's soul a fierce thirst\nfor beauty,--to know it, to create it; to be--something, he knows not\nwhat,--other than he is. There are moments when a passing cloud, the sun\nglinting on the purple thistles, a kindly smile, a child's face, will\nrouse him to a passion of pain,--when his nature starts up with a mad\ncry of rage against God, man, whoever it is that has forced this vile,\nslimy life upon him. With all this groping, this mad desire, a great\nblind intellect stumbling through wrong, a loving poet's heart, the man\nwas by habit only a coarse, vulgar laborer, familiar with sights and\nwords you would blush to name. Be just: when I tell you about this\nnight, see him as he is. Be just,--not like man's law, which seizes on\none isolated fact, but like God's judging angel, whose clear, sad\neye saw all the countless cankering days of this man's life, all the\ncountless nights, when, sick with starving, his soul fainted in him,\nbefore it judged him for this night, the saddest of all.\n\nI called this night the crisis of his life. If it was, it stole on him\nunawares. These great turning-days of life cast no shadow before, slip\nby unconsciously. Only a trifle, a little turn of the rudder, and the\nship goes to heaven or hell.\n\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him, dug into the furnace of melting iron\nwith his pole, dully thinking only how many rails the lump would yield.\nIt was late,--nearly Sunday morning; another hour, and the heavy work\nwould be done, only the furnaces to replenish and cover for the next\nday. The workmen were growing more noisy, shouting, as they had to do,\nto be heard over the deep clamor of the mills. Suddenly they grew less\nboisterous,--at the far end, entirely silent. Something unusual had\nhappened. After a moment, the silence came nearer; the men stopped their\njeers and drunken choruses. Deborah, stupidly lifting up her head,\nsaw the cause of the quiet. A group of five or six men were slowly\napproaching, stopping to examine each furnace as they came. Visitors\noften came to see the mills after night: except by growing less noisy,\nthe men took no notice of them. The furnace where Wolfe worked was near\nthe bounds of the works; they halted there hot and tired: a walk over\none of these great foundries is no trifling task. The woman, drawing out\nof sight, turned over to sleep. Wolfe, seeing them stop, suddenly roused\nfrom his indifferent stupor, and watched them keenly. He knew some\nof them: the overseer, Clarke,--a son of Kirby, one of the\nmill-owners,--and a Doctor May, one of the town-physicians. The other\ntwo were strangers. Wolfe came closer. He seized eagerly every chance\nthat brought him into contact with this mysterious class that shone down\non him perpetually with the glamour of another order of being. What made\nthe difference between them? That was the mystery of his life. He had\na vague notion that perhaps to-night he could find it out. One of the\nstrangers sat down on a pile of bricks, and beckoned young Kirby to his\nside.\n\n\"This is hot, with a vengeance. A match, please?\"--lighting his cigar.\n\"But the walk is worth the trouble. If it were not that you must have\nheard it so often, Kirby, I would tell you that your works look like\nDante's Inferno.\"\n\nKirby laughed.\n\n\"Yes. Yonder is Farinata himself in the burning tomb,\"--pointing to some\nfigure in the shimmering shadows.\n\n\"Judging from some of the faces of your men,\" said the other, \"they bid\nfair to try the reality of Dante's vision, some day.\"\n\nYoung Kirby looked curiously around, as if seeing the faces of his hands\nfor the first time.\n\n\"They're bad enough, that's true. A desperate set, I fancy. Eh, Clarke?\"\n\nThe overseer did not hear him. He was talking of net profits just\nthen,--giving, in fact, a schedule of the annual business of the firm to\na sharp peering little Yankee, who jotted down notes on a paper laid on\nthe crown of his hat: a reporter for one of the city-papers, getting up\na series of reviews of the leading manufactories. The other gentlemen\nhad accompanied them merely for amusement. They were silent until the\nnotes were finished, drying their feet at the furnaces, and sheltering\ntheir faces from the intolerable heat. At last the overseer concluded\nwith--\n\n\"I believe that is a pretty fair estimate, Captain.\"\n\n\"Here, some of you men!\" said Kirby, \"bring up those boards. We may as\nwell sit down, gentlemen, until the rain is over. It cannot last much\nlonger at this rate.\"\n\n\"Pig-metal,\"--mumbled the reporter,--\"um! coal facilities,--um! hands\nemployed, twelve hundred,--bitumen,--um!--all right, I believe, Mr.\nClarke;--sinking-fund,--what did you say was your sinking-fund?\"\n\n\"Twelve hundred hands?\" said the stranger, the young man who had first\nspoken. \"Do you control their votes, Kirby?\"\n\n\"Control? No.\" The young man smiled complacently. \"But my father brought\nseven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November.\nNo force-work, you understand,--only a speech or two, a hint to form\nthemselves into a society, and a bit of red and blue bunting to make\nthem a flag. The Invincible Roughs,--I believe that is their name. I\nforget the motto: 'Our country's hope,' I think.\"\n\nThere was a laugh. The young man talking to Kirby sat with an amused\nlight in his cool gray eye, surveying critically the half-clothed\nfigures of the puddlers, and the slow swing of their brawny muscles. He\nwas a stranger in the city,--spending a couple of months in the\nborders of a Slave State, to study the institutions of the South,--a\nbrother-in-law of Kirby's,--Mitchell. He was an amateur gymnast,--hence\nhis anatomical eye; a patron, in a blase' way, of the prize-ring; a man\nwho sucked the essence out of a science or philosophy in an indifferent,\ngentlemanly way; who took Kant, Novalis, Humboldt, for what they were\nworth in his own scales; accepting all, despising nothing, in heaven,\nearth, or hell, but one-idead men; with a temper yielding and brilliant\nas summer water, until his Self was touched, when it was ice, though\nbrilliant still. Such men are not rare in the States.\n\nAs he knocked the ashes from his cigar, Wolfe caught with a quick\npleasure the contour of the white hand, the blood-glow of a red ring he\nwore. His voice, too, and that of Kirby's, touched him like music,--low,\neven, with chording cadences. About this man Mitchell hung the\nimpalpable atmosphere belonging to the thoroughbred gentleman, Wolfe,\nscraping away the ashes beside him, was conscious of it, did obeisance\nto it with his artist sense, unconscious that he did so.\n\nThe rain did not cease. Clarke and the reporter left the mills; the\nothers, comfortably seated near the furnace, lingered, smoking\nand talking in a desultory way. Greek would not have been more\nunintelligible to the furnace-tenders, whose presence they soon forgot\nentirely. Kirby drew out a newspaper from his pocket and read aloud some\narticle, which they discussed eagerly. At every sentence, Wolfe listened\nmore and more like a dumb, hopeless animal, with a duller, more stolid\nlook creeping over his face, glancing now and then at Mitchell, marking\nacutely every smallest sign of refinement, then back to himself, seeing\nas in a mirror his filthy body, his more stained soul.\n\nNever! He had no words for such a thought, but he knew now, in all the\nsharpness of the bitter certainty, that between them there was a great\ngulf never to be passed. Never!\n\nThe bell of the mills rang for midnight. Sunday morning had dawned.\nWhatever hidden message lay in the tolling bells floated past these men\nunknown. Yet it was there. Veiled in the solemn music ushering the risen\nSaviour was a key-note to solve the darkest secrets of a world gone\nwrong,--even this social riddle which the brain of the grimy puddler\ngrappled with madly to-night.\n\nThe men began to withdraw the metal from the caldrons. The mills were\ndeserted on Sundays, except by the hands who fed the fires, and those\nwho had no lodgings and slept usually on the ash-heaps. The three\nstrangers sat still during the next hour, watching the men cover the\nfurnaces, laughing now and then at some jest of Kirby's.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Mitchell, \"I like this view of the works better than\nwhen the glare was fiercest? These heavy shadows and the amphitheatre\nof smothered fires are ghostly, unreal. One could fancy these red\nsmouldering lights to be the half-shut eyes of wild beasts, and the\nspectral figures their victims in the den.\"\n\nKirby laughed. \"You are fanciful. Come, let us get out of the den. The\nspectral figures, as you call them, are a little too real for me to\nfancy a close proximity in the darkness,--unarmed, too.\"\n\nThe others rose, buttoning their overcoats, and lighting cigars.\n\n\"Raining, still,\" said Doctor May, \"and hard. Where did we leave the\ncoach, Mitchell?\"\n\n\"At the other side of the works.--Kirby, what's that?\"\n\nMitchell started back, half-frightened, as, suddenly turning a corner,\nthe white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness,--a woman, white,\nof giant proportions, crouching on the ground, her arms flung out in\nsome wild gesture of warning.\n\n\"Stop! Make that fire burn there!\" cried Kirby, stopping short.\n\nThe flame burst out, flashing the gaunt figure into bold relief.\n\nMitchell drew a long breath.\n\n\"I thought it was alive,\" he said, going up curiously.\n\nThe others followed.\n\n\"Not marble, eh?\" asked Kirby, touching it.\n\nOne of the lower overseers stopped.\n\n\"Korl, Sir.\"\n\n\"Who did it?\"\n\n\"Can't say. Some of the hands; chipped it out in off-hours.\"\n\n\"Chipped to some purpose, I should say. What a flesh-tint the stuff has!\nDo you see, Mitchell?\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe had stepped aside where the light fell boldest on the figure, looking\nat it in silence. There was not one line of beauty or grace in it: a\nnude woman's form, muscular, grown coarse with labor, the powerful limbs\ninstinct with some one poignant longing. One idea: there it was in the\ntense, rigid muscles, the clutching hands, the wild, eager face, like\nthat of a starving wolf's. Kirby and Doctor May walked around it,\ncritical, curious. Mitchell stood aloof, silent. The figure touched him\nstrangely.\n\n\"Not badly done,\" said Doctor May, \"Where did the fellow learn that\nsweep of the muscles in the arm and hand? Look at them! They are\ngroping, do you see?--clutching: the peculiar action of a man dying of\nthirst.\"\n\n\"They have ample facilities for studying anatomy,\" sneered Kirby,\nglancing at the half-naked figures.\n\n\"Look,\" continued the Doctor, \"at this bony wrist, and the strained\nsinews of the instep! A working-woman,--the very type of her class.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" muttered Mitchell.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded May, \"What does the fellow intend by the figure? I\ncannot catch the meaning.\"\n\n\"Ask him,\" said the other, dryly, \"There he stands,\"--pointing to Wolfe,\nwho stood with a group of men, leaning on his ash-rake.\n\nThe Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind-hearted men\nput on, when talking to these people.\n\n\"Mr. Mitchell has picked you out as the man who did this,--I'm sure I\ndon't know why. But what did you mean by it?\"\n\n\"She be hungry.\"\n\nWolfe's eyes answered Mitchell, not the Doctor.\n\n\"Oh-h! But what a mistake you have made, my fine fellow! You have given\nno sign of starvation to the body. It is strong,--terribly strong. It\nhas the mad, half-despairing gesture of drowning.\"\n\nWolfe stammered, glanced appealingly at Mitchell, who saw the soul of\nthe thing, he knew. But the cool, probing eyes were turned on himself\nnow,--mocking, cruel, relentless.\n\n\"Not hungry for meat,\" the furnace-tender said at last.\n\n\"What then? Whiskey?\" jeered Kirby, with a coarse laugh.\n\nWolfe was silent a moment, thinking.\n\n\"I dunno,\" he said, with a bewildered look. \"It mebbe. Summat to make\nher live, I think,--like you. Whiskey ull do it, in a way.\"\n\nThe young man laughed again. Mitchell flashed a look of disgust\nsomewhere,--not at Wolfe.\n\n\"May,\" he broke out impatiently, \"are you blind? Look at that woman's\nface! It asks questions of God, and says, 'I have a right to know,' Good\nGod, how hungry it is!\"\n\nThey looked a moment; then May turned to the mill-owner:--\n\n\"Have you many such hands as this? What are you going to do with them?\nKeep them at puddling iron?\"\n\nKirby shrugged his shoulders. Mitchell's look had irritated him.\n\n\"Ce n'est pas mon affaire. I have no fancy for nursing infant geniuses.\nI suppose there are some stray gleams of mind and soul among these\nwretches. The Lord will take care of his own; or else they can work out\ntheir own salvation. I have heard you call our American system a ladder\nwhich any man can scale. Do you doubt it? Or perhaps you want to banish\nall social ladders, and put us all on a flat table-land,--eh, May?\"\n\nThe Doctor looked vexed, puzzled. Some terrible problem lay hid in this\nwoman's face, and troubled these men. Kirby waited for an answer, and,\nreceiving none, went on, warming with his subject.\n\n\"I tell you, there's something wrong that no talk of 'Liberte' or\n'Egalite' will do away. If I had the making of men, these men who do\nthe lowest part of the world's work should be machines,--nothing\nmore,--hands. It would be kindness. God help them! What are taste,\nreason, to creatures who must live such lives as that?\" He pointed to\nDeborah, sleeping on the ash-heap. \"So many nerves to sting them to\npain. What if God had put your brain, with all its agony of touch, into\nyour fingers, and bid you work and strike with that?\"\n\n\"You think you could govern the world better?\" laughed the Doctor.\n\n\"I do not think at all.\"\n\n\"That is true philosophy. Drift with the stream, because you cannot dive\ndeep enough to find bottom, eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" rejoined Kirby. \"I do not think. I wash my hands of all\nsocial problems,--slavery, caste, white or black. My duty to my\noperatives has a narrow limit,--the pay-hour on Saturday night. Outside\nof that, if they cut korl, or cut each other's throats, (the more\npopular amusement of the two,) I am not responsible.\"\n\nThe Doctor sighed,--a good honest sigh, from the depths of his stomach.\n\n\"God help us! Who is responsible?\"\n\n\"Not I, I tell you,\" said Kirby, testily. \"What has the man who pays\nthem money to do with their souls' concerns, more than the grocer or\nbutcher who takes it?\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Mitchell's cynical voice, \"look at her! How hungry she\nis!\"\n\nKirby tapped his boot with his cane. No one spoke. Only the dumb face of\nthe rough image looking into their faces with the awful question, \"What\nshall we do to be saved?\" Only Wolfe's face, with its heavy weight\nof brain, its weak, uncertain mouth, its desperate eyes, out of which\nlooked the soul of his class,--only Wolfe's face turned towards Kirby's.\nMitchell laughed,--a cool, musical laugh.\n\n\"Money has spoken!\" he said, seating himself lightly on a stone with the\nair of an amused spectator at a play. \"Are you answered?\"--turning to\nWolfe his clear, magnetic face.\n\nBright and deep and cold as Arctic air, the soul of the man lay tranquil\nbeneath. He looked at the furnace-tender as he had looked at a rare\nmosaic in the morning; only the man was the more amusing study of the\ntwo.\n\n\"Are you answered? Why, May, look at him! 'De profundis clamavi.' Or, to\nquote in English, 'Hungry and thirsty, his soul faints in him.' And so\nMoney sends back its answer into the depths through you, Kirby! Very\nclear the answer, too!--I think I remember reading the same words\nsomewhere: washing your hands in Eau de Cologne, and saying, 'I am\ninnocent of the blood of this man. See ye to it!'\"\n\nKirby flushed angrily.\n\n\"You quote Scripture freely.\"\n\n\"Do I not quote correctly? I think I remember another line, which may\namend my meaning? 'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these,\nye did it unto me.' Deist? Bless you, man, I was raised on the milk of\nthe Word. Now, Doctor, the pocket of the world having uttered its\nvoice, what has the heart to say? You are a philanthropist, in a small\nWay,--n'est ce pas? Here, boy, this gentleman can show you how to cut\nkorl better,--or your destiny. Go on, May!\"\n\n\"I think a mocking devil possesses you to-night,\" rejoined the Doctor,\nseriously.\n\nHe went to Wolfe and put his hand kindly on his arm. Something of a\nvague idea possessed the Doctor's brain that much good was to be done\nhere by a friendly word or two: a latent genius to be warmed into life\nby a waited-for sunbeam. Here it was: he had brought it. So he went on\ncomplacently:\n\n\"Do you know, boy, you have it in you to be a great sculptor, a great\nman? do you understand?\" (talking down to the capacity of his hearer:\nit is a way people have with children, and men like Wolfe,)--\"to live a\nbetter, stronger life than I, or Mr. Kirby here? A man may make himself\nanything he chooses. God has given you stronger powers than many\nmen,--me, for instance.\"\n\nMay stopped, heated, glowing with his own magnanimity. And it was\nmagnanimous. The puddler had drunk in every word, looking through the\nDoctor's flurry, and generous heat, and self-approval, into his will,\nwith those slow, absorbing eyes of his.\n\n\"Make yourself what you will. It is your right.\n\n\"I know,\" quietly. \"Will you help me?\"\n\nMitchell laughed again. The Doctor turned now, in a passion,--\n\n\"You know, Mitchell, I have not the means. You know, if I had, it is in\nmy heart to take this boy and educate him for\"--\n\n\"The glory of God, and the glory of John May.\"\n\nMay did not speak for a moment; then, controlled, he said,--\n\n\"Why should one be raised, when myriads are left?--I have not the money,\nboy,\" to Wolfe, shortly.\n\n\"Money?\" He said it over slowly, as one repeats the guessed answer to a\nriddle, doubtfully. \"That is it? Money?\"\n\n\"Yes, money,--that is it,\" said Mitchell, rising, and drawing his\nfurred coat about him. \"You've found the cure for all the world's\ndiseases.--Come, May, find your good-humor, and come home. This\ndamp wind chills my very bones. Come and preach your Saint-Simonian\ndoctrines' to-morrow to Kirby's hands. Let them have a clear idea of the\nrights of the soul, and I'll venture next week they'll strike for higher\nwages. That will be the end of it.\"\n\n\"Will you send the coach-driver to this side of the mills?\" asked Kirby,\nturning to Wolfe.\n\nHe spoke kindly: it was his habit to do so. Deborah, seeing the puddler\ngo, crept after him. The three men waited outside. Doctor May walked up\nand down, chafed. Suddenly he stopped.\n\n\"Go back, Mitchell! You say the pocket and the heart of the world\nspeak without meaning to these people. What has its head to say? Taste,\nculture, refinement? Go!\"\n\nMitchell was leaning against a brick wall. He turned his head\nindolently, and looked into the mills. There hung about the place a\nthick, unclean odor. The slightest motion of his hand marked that he\nperceived it, and his insufferable disgust. That was all. May said\nnothing, only quickened his angry tramp.\n\n\"Besides,\" added Mitchell, giving a corollary to his answer, \"it would\nbe of no use. I am not one of them.\"\n\n\"You do not mean\"--said May, facing him.\n\n\"Yes, I mean just that. Reform is born of need, not pity. No vital\nmovement of the people's has worked down, for good or evil; fermented,\ninstead, carried up the heaving, cloggy mass. Think back through\nhistory, and you will know it. What will this lowest deep--thieves,\nMagdalens, negroes--do with the light filtered through ponderous Church\ncreeds, Baconian theories, Goethe schemes? Some day, out of their bitter\nneed will be thrown up their own light-bringer,--their Jean Paul, their\nCromwell, their Messiah.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" was the Doctor's inward criticism. However, in practice, he\nadopted the theory; for, when, night and morning, afterwards, he prayed\nthat power might be given these degraded souls to rise, he glowed at\nheart, recognizing an accomplished duty.\n\nWolfe and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach\ndrove off. The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank, generous way,\ntelling him to \"take care of himself, and to remember it was his right\nto rise.\" Mitchell had simply touched his hat, as to an equal, with a\nquiet look of thorough recognition. Kirby had thrown Deborah some money,\nwhich she found, and clutched eagerly enough. They were gone now, all\nof them. The man sat down on the cinder-road, looking up into the murky\nsky.\n\n\"'T be late, Hugh. Wunnot hur come?\"\n\nHe shook his head doggedly, and the woman crouched out of his sight\nagainst the wall. Do you remember rare moments when a sudden\nlight flashed over yourself, your world, God? when you stood on a\nmountain-peak, seeing your life as it might have been, as it is? one\nquick instant, when custom lost its force and every-day usage? when your\nfriend, wife, brother, stood in a new light? your soul was bared, and\nthe grave,--a foretaste of the nakedness of the Judgment-Day? So it came\nbefore him, his life, that night. The slow tides of pain he had borne\ngathered themselves up and surged against his soul. His squalid daily\nlife, the brutal coarseness eating into his brain, as the ashes into\nhis skin: before, these things had been a dull aching into his\nconsciousness; to-night, they were reality. He griped the filthy red\nshirt that clung, stiff with soot, about him, and tore it savagely from\nhis arm. The flesh beneath was muddy with grease and ashes,--and the\nheart beneath that! And the soul? God knows.\n\nThen flashed before his vivid poetic sense the man who had left\nhim,--the pure face, the delicate, sinewy limbs, in harmony with all he\nknew of beauty or truth. In his cloudy fancy he had pictured a Something\nlike this. He had found it in this Mitchell, even when he idly\nscoffed at his pain: a Man all-knowing, all-seeing, crowned by Nature,\nreigning,--the keen glance of his eye falling like a sceptre on other\nmen. And yet his instinct taught him that he too--He! He looked at\nhimself with sudden loathing, sick, wrung his hands With a cry, and then\nwas silent. With all the phantoms of his heated, ignorant fancy, Wolfe\nhad not been vague in his ambitions. They were practical, slowly built\nup before him out of his knowledge of what he could do. Through years\nhe had day by day made this hope a real thing to himself,--a clear,\nprojected figure of himself, as he might become.\n\nAble to speak, to know what was best, to raise these men and women\nworking at his side up with him: sometimes he forgot this defined hope\nin the frantic anguish to escape, only to escape,--out of the wet, the\npain, the ashes, somewhere, anywhere,--only for one moment of free air\non a hill-side, to lie down and let his sick soul throb itself out in\nthe sunshine. But to-night he panted for life. The savage strength of\nhis nature was roused; his cry was fierce to God for justice.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he said to Deborah, with a low, bitter laugh, striking his\npuny chest savagely. \"What am I worth, Deb? Is it my fault that I am no\nbetter? My fault? My fault?\"\n\nHe stopped, stung with a sudden remorse, seeing her hunchback shape\nwrithing with sobs. For Deborah was crying thankless tears, according to\nthe fashion of women.\n\n\"God forgi' me, woman! Things go harder Wi' you nor me. It's a worse\nshare.\"\n\nHe got up and helped her to rise; and they went doggedly down the muddy\nstreet, side by side.\n\n\"It's all wrong,\" he muttered, slowly,--\"all wrong! I dunnot understan'.\nBut it'll end some day.\"\n\n\"Come home, Hugh!\" she said, coaxingly; for he had stopped, looking\naround bewildered.\n\n\"Home,--and back to the mill!\" He went on saying this over to himself,\nas if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair.\n\nShe followed him through the fog, her blue lips chattering with cold.\nThey reached the cellar at last. Old Wolfe had been drinking since she\nwent out, and had crept nearer the door. The girl Janey slept heavily in\nthe corner. He went up to her, touching softly the worn white arm with\nhis fingers. Some bitterer thought stung him, as he stood there. He\nwiped the drops from his forehead, and went into the room beyond, livid,\ntrembling. A hope, trifling, perhaps, but very dear, had died just then\nout of the poor puddler's life, as he looked at the sleeping, innocent\ngirl,--some plan for the future, in which she had borne a part. He gave\nit up that moment, then and forever. Only a trifle, perhaps, to us: his\nface grew a shade paler,--that was all. But, somehow, the man's soul, as\nGod and the angels looked down on it, never was the same afterwards.\n\nDeborah followed him into the inner room. She carried a candle, which\nshe placed on the floor, closing the door after her. She had seen the\nlook on his face, as he turned away: her own grew deadly. Yet, as she\ncame up to him, her eyes glowed. He was seated on an old chest, quiet,\nholding his face in his hands.\n\n\"Hugh!\" she said, softly.\n\nHe did not speak.\n\n\"Hugh, did hur hear what the man said,--him with the clear voice? Did\nhur hear? Money, money,--that it wud do all?\"\n\nHe pushed her away,--gently, but he was worn out; her rasping tone\nfretted him.\n\n\"Hugh!\"\n\nThe candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls,\nand the woman standing there. He looked at her. She was young, in\ndeadly earnest; her faded eyes, and wet, ragged figure caught from their\nfrantic eagerness a power akin to beauty.\n\n\"Hugh, it is true! Money ull do it! Oh, Hugh, boy, listen till me! He\nsaid it true! It is money!\"\n\n\"I know. Go back! I do not want you here.\"\n\n\"Hugh, it is t' last time. I'll never worrit hur again.\"\n\nThere were tears in her voice now, but she choked them back:\n\n\"Hear till me only to-night! If one of t' witch people wud come, them we\nheard oft' home, and gif hur all hur wants, what then? Say, Hugh!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean money.\"\n\nHer whisper shrilled through his brain.\n\n\"If one oft' witch dwarfs wud come from t' lane moors to-night, and gif\nhur money, to go out,--OUT, I say,--out, lad, where t' sun shines, and\nt' heath grows, and t' ladies walk in silken gownds, and God stays\nall t' time,--where t'man lives that talked to us to-night, Hugh\nknows,--Hugh could walk there like a king!\"\n\nHe thought the woman mad, tried to check her, but she went on, fierce in\nher eager haste.\n\n\"If I were t' witch dwarf, if I had t' money, wud hur thank me? Wud hur\ntake me out o' this place wid hur and Janey? I wud not come into the\ngran' house hur wud build, to vex hur wid t' hunch,--only at night, when\nt' shadows were dark, stand far off to see hur.\"\n\nMad? Yes! Are many of us mad in this way?\n\n\"Poor Deb! poor Deb!\" he said, soothingly.\n\n\"It is here,\" she said, suddenly, jerking into his hand a small roll. \"I\ntook it! I did it! Me, me!--not hur! I shall be hanged, I shall be burnt\nin hell, if anybody knows I took it! Out of his pocket, as he leaned\nagainst t' bricks. Hur knows?\"\n\nShe thrust it into his hand, and then, her errand done, began to gather\nchips together to make a fire, choking down hysteric sobs.\n\n\"Has it come to this?\"\n\nThat was all he said. The Welsh Wolfe blood was honest. The roll was a\nsmall green pocket-book containing one or two gold pieces, and a check\nfor an incredible amount, as it seemed to the poor puddler. He laid it\ndown, hiding his face again in his hands.\n\n\"Hugh, don't be angry wud me! It's only poor Deb,--hur knows?\"\n\nHe took the long skinny fingers kindly in his.\n\n\"Angry? God help me, no! Let me sleep. I am tired.\"\n\nHe threw himself heavily down on the wooden bench, stunned with pain and\nweariness. She brought some old rags to cover him.\n\nIt was late on Sunday evening before he awoke. I tell God's truth, when\nI say he had then no thought of keeping this money. Deborah had hid it\nin his pocket. He found it there. She watched him eagerly, as he took it\nout.\n\n\"I must gif it to him,\" he said, reading her face.\n\n\"Hur knows,\" she said with a bitter sigh of disappointment. \"But it is\nhur right to keep it.\"\n\nHis right! The word struck him. Doctor May had used the same. He washed\nhimself, and went out to find this man Mitchell. His right! Why did this\nchance word cling to him so obstinately? Do you hear the fierce devils\nwhisper in his ear, as he went slowly down the darkening street?\n\nThe evening came on, slow and calm. He seated himself at the end of\nan alley leading into one of the larger streets. His brain was clear\nto-night, keen, intent, mastering. It would not start back, cowardly,\nfrom any hellish temptation, but meet it face to face. Therefore the\ngreat temptation of his life came to him veiled by no sophistry, but\nbold, defiant, owning its own vile name, trusting to one bold blow for\nvictory.\n\nHe did not deceive himself. Theft! That was it. At first the word\nsickened him; then he grappled with it. Sitting there on a broken\ncart-wheel, the fading day, the noisy groups, the church-bells' tolling\npassed before him like a panorama, while the sharp struggle went on\nwithin. This money! He took it out, and looked at it. If he gave it\nback, what then? He was going to be cool about it.\n\nPeople going by to church saw only a sickly mill-boy watching them\nquietly at the alley's mouth. They did not know that he was mad, or they\nwould not have gone by so quietly: mad with hunger; stretching out his\nhands to the world, that had given so much to them, for leave to live\nthe life God meant him to live. His soul within him was smothering to\ndeath; he wanted so much, thought so much, and knew--nothing. There was\nnothing of which he was certain, except the mill and things there.\nOf God and heaven he had heard so little, that they were to him what\nfairy-land is to a child: something real, but not here; very far off.\nHis brain, greedy, dwarfed, full of thwarted energy and unused powers,\nquestioned these men and women going by, coldly, bitterly, that night.\nWas it not his right to live as they,--a pure life, a good, true-hearted\nlife, full of beauty and kind words? He only wanted to know how to\nuse the strength within him. His heart warmed, as he thought of it. He\nsuffered himself to think of it longer. If he took the money?\n\nThen he saw himself as he might be, strong, helpful, kindly. The night\ncrept on, as this one image slowly evolved itself from the crowd of\nother thoughts and stood triumphant. He looked at it. As he might be!\nWhat wonder, if it blinded him to delirium,--the madness that underlies\nall revolution, all progress, and all fall?\n\nYou laugh at the shallow temptation? You see the error underlying\nits argument so clearly,--that to him a true life was one of full\ndevelopment rather than self-restraint? that he was deaf to the higher\ntone in a cry of voluntary suffering for truth's sake than in the\nfullest flow of spontaneous harmony? I do not plead his cause. I only\nwant to show you the mote in my brother's eye: then you can see clearly\nto take it out.\n\nThe money,--there it lay on his knee, a little blotted slip of paper,\nnothing in itself; used to raise him out of the pit, something straight\nfrom God's hand. A thief! Well, what was it to be a thief? He met the\nquestion at last, face to face, wiping the clammy drops of sweat\nfrom his forehead. God made this money--the fresh air, too--for his\nchildren's use. He never made the difference between poor and rich. The\nSomething who looked down on him that moment through the cool gray sky\nhad a kindly face, he knew,--loved his children alike. Oh, he knew that!\n\nThere were times when the soft floods of color in the crimson and purple\nflames, or the clear depth of amber in the water below the bridge, had\nsomehow given him a glimpse of another world than this,--of an infinite\ndepth of beauty and of quiet somewhere,--somewhere, a depth of quiet\nand rest and love. Looking up now, it became strangely real. The sun had\nsunk quite below the hills, but his last rays struck upward, touching\nthe zenith. The fog had risen, and the town and river were steeped in\nits thick, gray damp; but overhead, the sun-touched smoke-clouds opened\nlike a cleft ocean,--shifting, rolling seas of crimson mist, waves of\nbillowy silver veined with blood-scarlet, inner depths unfathomable of\nglancing light. Wolfe's artist-eye grew drunk with color. The gates of\nthat other world! Fading, flashing before him now! What, in that world\nof Beauty, Content, and Right, were the petty laws, the mine and thine,\nof mill-owners and mill hands?\n\nA consciousness of power stirred within him. He stood up. A man,--he\nthought, stretching out his hands,--free to work, to live, to love!\nFree! His right! He folded the scrap of paper in his hand. As his\nnervous fingers took it in, limp and blotted, so his soul took in the\nmean temptation, lapped it in fancied rights, in dreams of improved\nexistences, drifting and endless as the cloud-seas of color. Clutching\nit, as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of\npossession, he went aimlessly down the street. It was his watch at the\nmill. He need not go, need never go again, thank God!--shaking off the\nthought with unspeakable loathing.\n\nShall I go over the history of the hours of that night? how the\nman wandered from one to another of his old haunts, with a\nhalf-consciousness of bidding them farewell,--lanes and alleys and\nback-yards where the mill-hands lodged,--noting, with a new eagerness,\nthe filth and drunkenness, the pig-pens, the ash-heaps covered with\npotato-skins, the bloated, pimpled women at the doors, with a new\ndisgust, a new sense of sudden triumph, and, under all, a new, vague\ndread, unknown before, smothered down, kept under, but still there? It\nleft him but once during the night, when, for the second time in his\nlife, he entered a church. It was a sombre Gothic pile, where the\nstained light lost itself in far-retreating arches; built to meet the\nrequirements and sympathies of a far other class than Wolfe's. Yet\nit touched, moved him uncontrollably. The distances, the shadows, the\nstill, marble figures, the mass of silent kneeling worshippers, the\nmysterious music, thrilled, lifted his soul with a wonderful pain.\nWolfe forgot himself, forgot the new life he was going to live, the mean\nterror gnawing underneath. The voice of the speaker strengthened the\ncharm; it was clear, feeling, full, strong. An old man, who had lived\nmuch, suffered much; whose brain was keenly alive, dominant; whose heart\nwas summer-warm with charity. He taught it to-night. He held up Humanity\nin its grand total; showed the great world-cancer to his people. Who\ncould show it better? He was a Christian reformer; he had studied the\nage thoroughly; his outlook at man had been free, world-wide, over all\ntime. His faith stood sublime upon the Rock of Ages; his fiery zeal\nguided vast schemes by which the Gospel was to be preached to all\nnations. How did he preach it to-night? In burning, light-laden words he\npainted Jesus, the incarnate Life, Love, the universal Man: words\nthat became reality in the lives of these people,--that lived again in\nbeautiful words and actions, trifling, but heroic. Sin, as he defined\nit, was a real foe to them; their trials, temptations, were his. His\nwords passed far over the furnace-tender's grasp, toned to suit another\nclass of culture; they sounded in his ears a very pleasant song in an\nunknown tongue. He meant to cure this world-cancer with a steady eye\nthat had never glared with hunger, and a hand that neither poverty nor\nstrychnine-whiskey had taught to shake. In this morbid, distorted heart\nof the Welsh puddler he had failed.\n\nEighteen centuries ago, the Master of this man tried reform in the\nstreets of a city as crowded and vile as this, and did not fail.\nHis disciple, showing Him to-night to cultured hearers, showing the\nclearness of the God-power acting through Him, shrank back from one\ncoarse fact; that in birth and habit the man Christ was thrown up from\nthe lowest of the people: his flesh, their flesh; their blood, his\nblood; tempted like them, to brutalize day by day; to lie, to steal: the\nactual slime and want of their hourly life, and the wine-press he trod\nalone.\n\nYet, is there no meaning in this perpetually covered truth? If the son\nof the carpenter had stood in the church that night, as he stood with\nthe fishermen and harlots by the sea of Galilee, before His Father and\ntheir Father, despised and rejected of men, without a place to lay His\nhead, wounded for their iniquities, bruised for their transgressions,\nwould not that hungry mill-boy at least, in the back seat, have \"known\nthe man\"? That Jesus did not stand there.\n\nWolfe rose at last, and turned from the church down the street. He\nlooked up; the night had come on foggy, damp; the golden mists had\nvanished, and the sky lay dull and ash-colored. He wandered again\naimlessly down the street, idly wondering what had become of the\ncloud-sea of crimson and scarlet. The trial-day of this man's life\nwas over, and he had lost the victory. What followed was mere drifting\ncircumstance,--a quicker walking over the path,--that was all. Do you\nwant to hear the end of it? You wish me to make a tragic story out of\nit? Why, in the police-reports of the morning paper you can find a dozen\nsuch tragedies: hints of shipwrecks unlike any that ever befell on the\nhigh seas; hints that here a power was lost to heaven,--that there a\nsoul went down where no tide can ebb or flow. Commonplace enough the\nhints are,--jocose sometimes, done up in rhyme.\n\nDoctor May a month after the night I have told you of, was reading to\nhis wife at breakfast from this fourth column of the morning-paper:\nan unusual thing,--these police-reports not being, in general, choice\nreading for ladies; but it was only one item he read.\n\n\"Oh, my dear! You remember that man I told you of, that we saw at\nKirby's mill?--that was arrested for robbing Mitchell? Here he is; just\nlisten:--'Circuit Court. Judge Day. Hugh Wolfe, operative in Kirby &\nJohn's Loudon Mills. Charge, grand larceny. Sentence, nineteen years\nhard labor in penitentiary. Scoundrel! Serves him right! After all our\nkindness that night! Picking Mitchell's pocket at the very time!\"\n\nHis wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people,\nand then they began to talk of something else.\n\nNineteen years! How easy that was to read! What a simple word for Judge\nDay to utter! Nineteen years! Half a lifetime!\n\nHugh Wolfe sat on the window-ledge of his cell, looking out. His ankles\nWere ironed. Not usual in such cases; but he had made two desperate\nefforts to escape. \"Well,\" as Haley, the jailer, said, \"small blame\nto him! Nineteen years' imprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look\nforward to.\" Haley was very good-natured about it, though Wolfe had\nfought him savagely.\n\n\"When he was first caught,\" the jailer said afterwards, in telling the\nstory, \"before the trial, the fellow was cut down at once,--laid there\non that pallet like a dead man, with his hands over his eyes. Never saw\na man so cut down in my life. Time of the trial, too, came the queerest\ndodge of any customer I ever had. Would choose no lawyer. Judge gave him\none, of course. Gibson it Was. He tried to prove the fellow crazy; but\nit wouldn't go. Thing was plain as daylight: money found on him. 'T was\na hard sentence,--all the law allows; but it was for 'xample's sake.\nThese mill-hands are gettin' onbearable. When the sentence was read, he\njust looked up, and said the money was his by rights, and that all the\nworld had gone wrong. That night, after the trial, a gentleman came to\nsee him here, name of Mitchell,--him as he stole from. Talked to him for\nan hour. Thought he came for curiosity, like. After he was gone, thought\nWolfe was remarkable quiet, and went into his cell. Found him very low;\nbed all bloody. Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs. He was\nas weak as a cat; yet if ye'll b'lieve me, he tried to get a-past me and\nget out. I just carried him like a baby, and threw him on the pallet.\nThree days after, he tried it again: that time reached the wall. Lord\nhelp you! he fought like a tiger,--giv' some terrible blows. Fightin'\nfor life, you see; for he can't live long, shut up in the stone crib\ndown yonder. Got a death-cough now. 'T took two of us to bring him down\nthat day; so I just put the irons on his feet. There he sits, in there.\nGoin' to-morrow, with a batch more of 'em. That woman, hunchback, tried\nwith him,--you remember?--she's only got three years. 'Complice. But\nshe's a woman, you know. He's been quiet ever since I put on irons:\ngiv' up, I suppose. Looks white, sick-lookin'. It acts different on 'em,\nbein' sentenced. Most of 'em gets reckless, devilish-like. Some prays\nawful, and sings them vile songs of the mills, all in a breath. That\nwoman, now, she's desper't'. Been beggin' to see Hugh, as she calls him,\nfor three days. I'm a-goin' to let her in. She don't go with him. Here\nshe is in this next cell. I'm a-goin' now to let her in.\"\n\nHe let her in. Wolfe did not see her. She crept into a corner of the\ncell, and stood watching him. He was scratching the iron bars of\nthe window with a piece of tin which he had picked up, with an idle,\nuncertain, vacant stare, just as a child or idiot would do.\n\n\"Tryin' to get out, old boy?\" laughed Haley. \"Them irons will need a\ncrow-bar beside your tin, before you can open 'em.\"\n\nWolfe laughed, too, in a senseless way.\n\n\"I think I'll get out,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe his brain's touched,\" said Haley, when he came out.\n\nThe puddler scraped away with the tin for half an hour. Still Deborah\ndid not speak. At last she ventured nearer, and touched his arm.\n\n\"Blood?\" she said, looking at some spots on his coat with a shudder.\n\nHe looked up at her, \"Why, Deb!\" he said, smiling,--such a bright,\nboyish smile, that it Went to poor Deborah's heart directly, and she\nsobbed and cried out loud.\n\n\"Oh, Hugh, lad! Hugh! dunnot look at me, when it wur my fault! To think\nI brought hur to it! And I loved hur so! Oh lad, I dud!\"\n\nThe confession, even In this wretch, came with the woman's blush through\nthe sharp cry.\n\nHe did not seem to hear her,--scraping away diligently at the bars with\nthe bit of tin.\n\nWas he going mad? She peered closely into his face. Something she saw\nthere made her draw suddenly back,--something which Haley had not seen,\nthat lay beneath the pinched, vacant look it had caught since the trial,\nor the curious gray shadow that rested on it. That gray shadow,--yes,\nshe knew what that meant. She had often seen it creeping over women's\nfaces for months, who died at last of slow hunger or consumption. That\nmeant death, distant, lingering: but this--Whatever it was the woman\nsaw, or thought she saw, used as she was to crime and misery, seemed to\nmake her sick with a new horror. Forgetting her fear of him, she caught\nhis shoulders, and looked keenly, steadily, into his eyes.\n\n\"Hugh!\" she cried, in a desperate whisper,--\"oh, boy, not that! for\nGod's sake, not that!\"\n\nThe vacant laugh went off his face, and he answered her in a muttered\nword or two that drove her away. Yet the words were kindly enough.\nSitting there on his pallet, she cried silently a hopeless sort of\ntears, but did not speak again. The man looked up furtively at her now\nand then. Whatever his own trouble was, her distress vexed him with a\nmomentary sting.\n\nIt was market-day. The narrow window of the jail looked down directly on\nthe carts and wagons drawn up in a long line, where they had unloaded.\nHe could see, too, and hear distinctly the clink of money as it changed\nhands, the busy crowd of whites and blacks shoving, pushing one another,\nand the chaffering and swearing at the stalls. Somehow, the sound, more\nthan anything else had done, wakened him up,--made the whole real to\nhim. He was done with the world and the business of it. He let the tin\nfall, and looked out, pressing his face close to the rusty bars. How\nthey crowded and pushed! And he,--he should never walk that pavement\nagain! There came Neff Sanders, one of the feeders at the mill, with\na basket on his arm. Sure enough, Nyeff was married the other week. He\nwhistled, hoping he would look up; but he did not. He wondered if Neff\nremembered he was there,--if any of the boys thought of him up there,\nand thought that he never was to go down that old cinder-road again.\nNever again! He had not quite understood it before; but now he did. Not\nfor days or years, but never!--that was it.\n\nHow clear the light fell on that stall in front of the market! and how\nlike a picture it was, the dark-green heaps of corn, and the crimson\nbeets, and golden melons! There was another with game: how the light\nflickered on that pheasant's breast, with the purplish blood dripping\nover the brown feathers! He could see the red shining of the drops, it\nwas so near. In one minute he could be down there. It was just a step.\nSo easy, as it seemed, so natural to go! Yet it could never be--not in\nall the thousands of years to come--that he should put his foot on that\nstreet again! He thought of himself with a sorrowful pity, as of some\none else. There was a dog down in the market, walking after his master\nwith such a stately, grave look!--only a dog, yet he could go backwards\nand forwards just as he pleased: he had good luck! Why, the very vilest\ncur, yelping there in the gutter, had not lived his life, had been free\nto act out whatever thought God had put into his brain; while he--No, he\nwould not think of that! He tried to put the thought away, and to listen\nto a dispute between a countryman and a woman about some meat; but it\nwould come back. He, what had he done to bear this?\n\nThen came the sudden picture of what might have been, and now. He knew\nwhat it was to be in the penitentiary, how it went with men there. He\nknew how in these long years he should slowly die, but not until soul\nand body had become corrupt and rotten,--how, when he came out, if he\nlived to come, even the lowest of the mill-hands would jeer him,--how\nhis hands would be weak, and his brain senseless and stupid. He believed\nhe was almost that now. He put his hand to his head, with a puzzled,\nweary look. It ached, his head, with thinking. He tried to quiet\nhimself. It was only right, perhaps; he had done wrong. But was there\nright or wrong for such as he? What was right? And who had ever taught\nhim? He thrust the whole matter away. A dark, cold quiet crept through\nhis brain. It was all wrong; but let it be! It was nothing to him more\nthan the others. Let it be!\n\nThe door grated, as Haley opened it.\n\n\"Come, my woman! Must lock up for t' night. Come, stir yerself!\"\n\nShe went up and took Hugh's hand.\n\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" he said, carelessly.\n\nShe had not hoped he would say more; but the tired pain on her mouth\njust then was bitterer than death. She took his passive hand and kissed\nit.\n\n\"Hur'll never see Deb again!\" she ventured, her lips growing colder and\nmore bloodless.\n\nWhat did she say that for? Did he not know it? Yet he would not be\nimpatient with poor old Deb. She had trouble of her own, as well as he.\n\n\"No, never again,\" he said, trying to be cheerful.\n\nShe stood just a moment, looking at him. Do you laugh at her, standing\nthere, with her hunchback, her rags, her bleared, withered face, and the\ngreat despised love tugging at her heart?\n\n\"Come, you!\" called Haley, impatiently.\n\nShe did not move.\n\n\"Hugh!\" she whispered.\n\nIt was to be her last word. What was it?\n\n\"Hugh, boy, not THAT!\"\n\nHe did not answer. She wrung her hands, trying to be silent, looking in\nhis face in an agony of entreaty. He smiled again, kindly.\n\n\"It is best, Deb. I cannot bear to be hurted any more.\n\n\"Hur knows,\" she said, humbly.\n\n\"Tell my father good-bye; and--and kiss little Janey.\"\n\nShe nodded, saying nothing, looked in his face again, and went out of\nthe door. As she went, she staggered.\n\n\"Drinkin' to-day?\" broke out Haley, pushing her before him. \"Where the\nDevil did you get it? Here, in with ye!\" and he shoved her into her\ncell, next to Wolfe's, and shut the door.\n\nAlong the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor,\nthrough which she could see the light from Wolfe's. She had discovered\nit days before. She hurried in now, and, kneeling down by it, listened,\nhoping to hear some sound. Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the\nbars. He was at his old amusement again. Something in the noise jarred\non her ear, for she shivered as she heard it. Hugh rasped away at the\nbars. A dull old bit of tin, not fit to cut korl with.\n\nHe looked out of the window again. People were leaving the market now.\nA tall mulatto girl, following her mistress, her basket on her head,\ncrossed the street just below, and looked up. She was laughing; but,\nwhen she caught sight of the haggard face peering out through the bars,\nsuddenly grew grave, and hurried by. A free, firm step, a clear-cut\nolive face, with a scarlet turban tied on one side, dark, shining eyes,\nand on the head the basket poised, filled with fruit and flowers, under\nwhich the scarlet turban and bright eyes looked out half-shadowed. The\npicture caught his eye. It was good to see a face like that. He would\ntry to-morrow, and cut one like it. To-morrow! He threw down the tin,\ntrembling, and covered his face with his hands. When he looked up again,\nthe daylight was gone.\n\nDeborah, crouching near by on the other side of the wall, heard no\nnoise. He sat on the side of the low pallet, thinking. Whatever was the\nmystery which the woman had seen on his face, it came out now slowly,\nin the dark there, and became fixed,--a something never seen on his face\nbefore. The evening was darkening fast. The market had been over for an\nhour; the rumbling of the carts over the pavement grew more infrequent:\nhe listened to each, as it passed, because he thought it was to be for\nthe last time. For the same reason, it was, I suppose, that he strained\nhis eyes to catch a glimpse of each passer-by, wondering who they were,\nwhat kind of homes they were going to, if they had children,--listening\neagerly to every chance word in the street, as if--(God be merciful to\nthe man! what strange fancy was this?)--as if he never should hear human\nvoices again.\n\nIt was quite dark at last. The street was a lonely one. The last\npassenger, he thought, was gone. No,--there was a quick step: Joe Hill,\nlighting the lamps. Joe was a good old chap; never passed a fellow\nwithout some joke or other. He remembered once seeing the place where\nhe lived with his wife. \"Granny Hill\" the boys called her. Bedridden she\nWas; but so kind as Joe was to her! kept the room so clean!--and the old\nwoman, when he was there, was laughing at some of \"t' lad's foolishness.\"\nThe step was far down the street; but he could see him place the ladder,\nrun up, and light the gas. A longing seized him to be spoken to once\nmore.\n\n\"Joe!\" he called, out of the grating. \"Good-bye, Joe!\"\n\nThe old man stopped a moment, listening uncertainly; then hurried\non. The prisoner thrust his hand out of the window, and called again,\nlouder; but Joe was too far down the street. It was a little thing; but\nit hurt him,--this disappointment.\n\n\"Good-bye, Joe!\" he called, sorrowfully enough.\n\n\"Be quiet!\" said one of the jailers, passing the door, striking on it\nwith his club.\n\nOh, that was the last, was it?\n\nThere was an inexpressible bitterness on his face, as he lay down on the\nbed, taking the bit of tin, which he had rasped to a tolerable degree\nof sharpness, in his hand,--to play with, it may be. He bared his arms,\nlooking intently at their corded veins and sinews. Deborah, listening in\nthe next cell, heard a slight clicking sound, often repeated. She shut\nher lips tightly, that she might not scream; the cold drops of sweat\nbroke over her, in her dumb agony.\n\n\"Hur knows best,\" she muttered at last, fiercely clutching the boards\nwhere she lay.\n\nIf she could have seen Wolfe, there was nothing about him to frighten\nher. He lay quite still, his arms outstretched, looking at the pearly\nstream of moonlight coming into the window. I think in that one hour\nthat came then he lived back over all the years that had gone before.\nI think that all the low, vile life, all his wrongs, all his starved\nhopes, came then, and stung him with a farewell poison that made him\nsick unto death. He made neither moan nor cry, only turned his worn\nface now and then to the pure light, that seemed so far off, as one that\nsaid, \"How long, O Lord? how long?\"\n\nThe hour was over at last. The moon, passing over her nightly path,\nslowly came nearer, and threw the light across his bed on his feet. He\nwatched it steadily, as it crept up, inch by inch, slowly. It seemed to\nhim to carry with it a great silence. He had been so hot and tired there\nalways in the mills! The years had been so fierce and cruel! There was\ncoming now quiet and coolness and sleep. His tense limbs relaxed, and\nsettled in a calm languor. The blood ran fainter and slow from his\nheart. He did not think now with a savage anger of what might be and was\nnot; he was conscious only of deep stillness creeping over him. At first\nhe saw a sea of faces: the mill-men,--women he had known, drunken and\nbloated,--Janey's timid and pitiful-poor old Debs: then they floated\ntogether like a mist, and faded away, leaving only the clear, pearly\nmoonlight.\n\nWhether, as the pure light crept up the stretched-out figure, it brought\nwith It calm and peace, who shall say? His dumb soul was alone with\nGod in judgment. A Voice may have spoken for it from far-off Calvary,\n\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!\" Who dare say?\nFainter and fainter the heart rose and fell, slower and slower the moon\nfloated from behind a cloud, until, when at last its full tide of white\nsplendor swept over the cell, it seemed to wrap and fold into a deeper\nstillness the dead figure that never should move again. Silence deeper\nthan the Night! Nothing that moved, save the black, nauseous stream of\nblood dripping slowly from the pallet to the floor!\n\nThere was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day. The coroner\nand his jury, the local editors, Kirby himself, and boys with their\nhands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side, jammed\ninto the corners. Coming and going all day. Only one woman. She\ncame late, and outstayed them all. A Quaker, or Friend, as they call\nthemselves. I think this woman Was known by that name in heaven. A\nhomely body, coarsely dressed in gray and white. Deborah (for Haley had\nlet her in) took notice of her. She watched them all--sitting on the\nend of the pallet, holding his head in her arms with the ferocity of a\nwatch-dog, if any of them touched the body. There was no meekness, no\nsorrow, in her face; the stuff out of which murderers are made, instead.\nAll the time Haley and the woman were laying straight the limbs and\ncleaning the cell, Deborah sat still, keenly watching the Quaker's face.\nOf all the crowd there that day, this woman alone had not spoken to\nher,--only once or twice had put some cordial to her lips. After they\nall were gone, the woman, in the same still, gentle way, brought a vase\nof wood-leaves and berries, and placed it by the pallet, then opened the\nnarrow window. The fresh air blew in, and swept the woody fragrance over\nthe dead face, Deborah looked up with a quick wonder.\n\n\"Did hur know my boy wud like it? Did hur know Hugh?\"\n\n\"I know Hugh now.\"\n\nThe white fingers passed in a slow, pitiful way over the dead, worn\nface. There was a heavy shadow in the quiet eyes.\n\n\"Did hur know where they'll bury Hugh?\" said Deborah in a shrill tone,\ncatching her arm.\n\nThis had been the question hanging on her lips all day.\n\n\"In t' town-yard? Under t' mud and ash? T' lad'll smother, woman! He wur\nborn in t' lane moor, where t' air is frick and strong. Take hur out,\nfor God's sake, take hur out where t' air blows!\"\n\nThe Quaker hesitated, but only for a moment. She put her strong arm\naround Deborah and led her to the window.\n\n\"Thee sees the hills, friend, over the river? Thee sees how the\nlight lies warm there, and the winds of God blow all the day? I live\nthere,--where the blue smoke is, by the trees. Look at me,\" She turned\nDeborah's face to her own, clear and earnest, \"Thee will believe me? I\nwill take Hugh and bury him there to-morrow.\"\n\nDeborah did not doubt her. As the evening wore on, she leaned against\nthe iron bars, looking at the hills that rose far off, through the thick\nsodden clouds, like a bright, unattainable calm. As she looked, a shadow\nof their solemn repose fell on her face; its fierce discontent faded\ninto a pitiful, humble quiet. Slow, solemn tears gathered in her eyes:\nthe poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where Hugh was to\nrest, the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than\never before. The Quaker watched her keenly. She came to her at last, and\ntouched her arm.\n\n\"When thee comes back,\" she said, in a low, sorrowful tone, like one\nwho speaks from a strong heart deeply moved with remorse or pity, \"thee\nshall begin thy life again,--there on the hills. I came too late; but\nnot for thee,--by God's help, it may be.\"\n\nNot too late. Three years after, the Quaker began her work. I end my\nstory here. At evening-time it was light. There is no need to tire\nyou with the long years of sunshine, and fresh air, and slow, patient\nChrist-love, needed to make healthy and hopeful this impure body and\nsoul. There is a homely pine house, on one of these hills, whose windows\noverlook broad, wooded slopes and clover-crimsoned meadows,--niched into\nthe very place where the light is warmest, the air freest. It is the\nFriends' meeting-house. Once a week they sit there, in their grave,\nearnest way, waiting for the Spirit of Love to speak, opening their\nsimple hearts to receive His words. There is a woman, old, deformed, who\ntakes a humble place among them: waiting like them: in her gray dress,\nher worn face, pure and meek, turned now and then to the sky. A woman\nmuch loved by these silent, restful people; more silent than they, more\nhumble, more loving. Waiting: with her eyes turned to hills higher\nand purer than these on which she lives, dim and far off now, but to be\nreached some day. There may be in her heart some latent hope to meet\nthere the love denied her here,--that she shall find him whom she lost,\nand that then she will not be all-unworthy. Who blames her? Something\nis lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the\nother,--something pure and beautiful, which might have been and was not:\na hope, a talent, a love, over which the soul mourns, like Esau deprived\nof his birthright. What blame to the meek Quaker, if she took her lost\nhope to make the hills of heaven more fair?\n\nNothing remains to tell that the poor Welsh puddler once lived, but this\nfigure of the mill-woman cut in korl. I have it here in a corner of my\nlibrary. I keep it hid behind a curtain,--it is such a rough, ungainly\nthing. Yet there are about it touches, grand sweeps of outline, that\nshow a master's hand. Sometimes,--to-night, for instance,--the\ncurtain is accidentally drawn back, and I see a bare arm stretched out\nimploringly in the darkness, and an eager, wolfish face watching mine: a\nwan, woful face, through which the spirit of the dead korl-cutter looks\nout, with its thwarted life, its mighty hunger, its unfinished work. Its\npale, vague lips seem to tremble with a terrible question. \"Is this the\nEnd?\" they say,--\"nothing beyond? no more?\" Why, you tell me you have\nseen that look in the eyes of dumb brutes,--horses dying under the lash.\nI know.\n\nThe deep of the night is passing while I write. The gas-light wakens\nfrom the shadows here and there the objects which lie scattered through\nthe room: only faintly, though; for they belong to the open sunlight. As\nI glance at them, they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming\nday. A half-moulded child's head; Aphrodite; a bough of forest-leaves;\nmusic; work; homely fragments, in which lie the secrets of all eternal\ntruth and beauty. Prophetic all! Only this dumb, woful face seems to\nbelong to and end with the night. I turn to look at it. Has the power\nof its desperate need commanded the darkness away? While the room is yet\nsteeped in heavy shadow, a cool, gray light suddenly touches its head\nlike a blessing hand, and its groping arm points through the broken\ncloud to the far East, where, in the flickering, nebulous crimson, God\nhas set the promise of the Dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Life in the Iron-Mills, by Rebecca Harding Davis\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LIFE IN THE IRON-MILLS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 876.txt or 876.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/8\/7\/876\/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":285,"split":"train"}
