{"ori_id":"29b3a0b4e9bd807c59912ec69f4617e1fa5c6a3e","title":"The Way of the World","context":"The Way of the World\n Act 1 is set in a chocolate house where Mirabell and Fainall have just finished playing cards. A footman comes and tells Mirabell that Waitwell (Mirabell's male servant) and Foible (Lady Wishfort's female servant) were married that morning. Mirabell tells Fainall about his love of Millamant and is encouraged to marry her. Witwoud and Petulant appear and Mirabell is informed that should Lady Wishfort marry, he will lose \u00a36000 of Millamant's inheritance.He will only get this money if he can make Lady Wishfort consent to his and Millamant's marriage.\nAct 2 is set in St. James\u2019 Park. Mrs. Fainall and Mrs. Marwood are discussing their hatred of men. Fainall appears and accuses Mrs. Marwood (with whom he is having an affair) of loving Mirabell (which she does). Meanwhile, Mrs. Fainall (Mirabell's former lover) tells Mirabell that she hates her husband, and they begin to plot to deceive Lady Wishfort into giving her consent to the marriage. Millamant appears in the park and, angry about the previous night (when Mirabell was confronted by Lady Wishfort), she tells Mirabell of her displeasure in his plan, which she only has a vague idea about. After she leaves, the newly wed servants appear and Mirabell reminds them of their roles in the plan.\nActs 3, 4 and 5 are all set in the home of Lady Wishfort. We are introduced to Lady Wishfort who is encouraged by Foible to marry the supposed Sir Rowland \u2013 Mirabell's supposed uncle \u2013 so that Mirabell will lose his inheritance. Sir Rowland is, however, Waitwell in disguise, and the plan is to entangle Lady Wishfort in a marriage which cannot go ahead, because it would be bigamy, not to mention a social disgrace (Waitwell is only a serving man, Lady Wishfort an aristocrat). Mirabell will offer to help her out of the embarrassing situation if she consents to his marriage. Later, Mrs. Fainall discusses this plan with Foible, but this is overheard by Mrs. Marwood. She later tells the plan to Fainall, who decides that he will take his wife's money and go away with Mrs. Marwood.\nMirabell and Millamant, equally strong-willed, discuss in detail the conditions under which they would accept each other in marriage (otherwise known as the \"proviso scene\"), showing the depth of their feeling for each other. Mirabell finally proposes to Millamant and, with Mrs. Fainall's encouragement (almost consent, as Millamant knows of their previous relations), Millamant accepts. Mirabell leaves as Lady Wishfort arrives, and she lets it be known that she wants Millamant to marry her nephew, Sir Wilfull Witwoud, who has just arrived from the countryside. Lady Wishfort later gets a letter telling her about the Sir Rowland plot. Sir Rowland takes the letter and accuses Mirabell of trying to sabotage their wedding. Lady Wishfort agrees to let Sir Rowland bring a marriage contract that night.\nBy Act 5, Lady Wishfort has found out the plot, and Fainall has had Waitwell arrested. Mrs. Fainall tells Foible that her previous affair with Mirabell is now public knowledge. Lady Wishfort appears with Mrs. Marwood, whom she thanks for unveiling the plot. Fainall then appears and uses the information of Mrs. Fainall's previous affair with Mirabell and Millamant's contract to marry him to blackmail Lady Wishfort, telling that she should never marry and that she is to transfer her fortune to him. Lady Wishfort offers Mirabell her consent to the marriage if he can save her fortune and honour. Mirabell calls on Waitwell who brings a contract from the time before the marriage of the Fainalls in which Mrs. Fainall gives all her property to Mirabell. This neutralises the blackmail attempts, after which Mirabell restores Mrs. Fainall's property to her possession and then is free to marry Millamant with the full \u00a36000 inheritance.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Way of the World, by William Congreve\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions \nwhatsoever.

One\nwho has at any time had the honour of your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation,\ncannot be supposed to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to\nyour perusal.  Yet it were to incur the imputation of too much\nsufficiency to pretend to such a merit as might abide the test of your\nlordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s censure.\n\nWhatever value may be wanting to this play while yet it is mine, will be\nsufficiently made up to it when it is once become your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and it\nis my security, that I cannot have overrated it more by my dedication\nthan your lordship will dignify it by your patronage.\n\nThat it succeeded on the stage was almost beyond my expectation; for but\nlittle of it was prepared for that general taste which seems now to be\npredominant in the palates of our audience.\n\nThose characters which are meant to be ridiculed in most of our comedies\nare of fools so gross, that in my humble opinion they should rather\ndisturb than divert the well-natured and reflecting part of an audience;\nthey are rather objects of charity than contempt, and instead of moving\nour mirth, they ought very often to excite our compassion.\n\nThis reflection moved me to design some characters which should appear\nridiculous not so much through a natural folly (which is incorrigible,\nand therefore not proper for the stage) as through an affected wit: a wit\nwhich, at the same time that it is affected, is also false.  As there is\nsome difficulty in the formation of a character of this nature, so there\nis some hazard which attends the progress of its success upon the stage:\nfor many come to a play so overcharged with criticism, that they very\noften let fly their censure, when through their rashness they have\nmistaken their aim.  This I had occasion lately to observe: for this play\nhad been acted two or three days before some of these hasty judges could\nfind the leisure to distinguish betwixt the character of a Witwoud and a\nTruewit.\n\nI must beg your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pardon for this digression from the true\ncourse of this epistle; but that it may not seem altogether impertinent,\nI beg that I may plead the occasion of it, in part of that excuse of\nwhich I stand in need, for recommending this comedy to your protection.\nIt is only by the countenance of your lordship, and the _few_ so\nqualified, that such who write with care and pains can hope to be\ndistinguished: for the prostituted name of poet promiscuously levels all\nthat bear it.\n\nTerence, the most correct writer in the world, had a Scipio and a Lelius,\nif not to assist him, at least to support him in his reputation.  And\nnotwithstanding his extraordinary merit, it may be their countenance was\nnot more than necessary.\n\nThe purity of his style, the delicacy of his turns, and the justness of\nhis characters, were all of them beauties which the greater part of his\naudience were incapable of tasting.  Some of the coarsest strokes of\nPlautus, so severely censured by Horace, were more likely to affect the\nmultitude; such, who come with expectation to laugh at the last act of a\nplay, and are better entertained with two or three unseasonable jests\nthan with the artful solution of the fable.\n\nAs Terence excelled in his performances, so had he great advantages to\nencourage his undertakings, for he built most on the foundations of\nMenander: his plots were generally modelled, and his characters ready\ndrawn to his hand.  He copied Menander; and Menander had no less light in\nthe formation of his characters from the observations of Theophrastus, of\nwhom he was a disciple; and Theophrastus, it is known, was not only the\ndisciple, but the immediate successor of Aristotle, the first and\ngreatest judge of poetry.  These were great models to design by; and the\nfurther advantage which Terence possessed towards giving his plays the\ndue ornaments of purity of style, and justness of manners, was not less\nconsiderable from the freedom of conversation which was permitted him\nwith Lelius and Scipio, two of the greatest and most polite men of his\nage.  And, indeed, the privilege of such a conversation is the only\ncertain means of attaining to the perfection of dialogue.\n\nIf it has happened in any part of this comedy that I have gained a turn\nof style or expression more correct, or at least more corrigible, than in\nthose which I have formerly written, I must, with equal pride and\ngratitude, ascribe it to the honour of your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admitting me into\nyour conversation, and that of a society where everybody else was so well\nworthy of you, in your retirement last summer from the town: for it was\nimmediately after, that this comedy was written.  If I have failed in my\nperformance, it is only to be regretted, where there were so many not\ninferior either to a Scipio or a Lelius, that there should be one wanting\nequal in capacity to a Terence.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, poetry is almost the only art which has not yet\nlaid claim to your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patronage.  Architecture and painting, to\nthe great honour of our country, have flourished under your influence and\nprotection.  In the meantime, poetry, the eldest sister of all arts, and\nparent of most, seems to have resigned her birthright, by having\nneglected to pay her duty to your lordship, and by permitting others of a\nlater extraction to prepossess that place in your esteem, to which none\ncan pretend a better title.  Poetry, in its nature, is sacred to the good\nand great: the relation between them is reciprocal, and they are ever\npropitious to it.  It is the privilege of poetry to address them, and it\nis their prerogative alone to give it protection.\n\nThis received maxim is a general apology for all writers who consecrate\ntheir labours to great men: but I could wish, at this time, that this\naddress were exempted from the common pretence of all dedications; and\nthat as I can distinguish your lordship even among the most deserving, so\nthis offering might become remarkable by some particular instance of\nrespect, which should assure your lordship that I am, with all due sense\nof your extreme worthiness and humanity, my lord, your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most\nobedient and most obliged humble servant,\n\n                                                           WILL. CONGREVE.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE.\n\n\n                         Spoken by MR. BETTERTON.\n\n   OF those few fools, who with ill stars are curst,\n   Sure scribbling fools, called poets, fare the worst:\n   For they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a sort of fools which fortune makes,\n   And, after she has made \u00e2\u0080\u0099em fools, forsakes.\n   With Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oafs \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis quite a diff\u00e2\u0080\u0099rent case,\n   For Fortune favours all her idiot race.\n   In her own nest the cuckoo eggs we find,\n   O\u00e2\u0080\u0099er which she broods to hatch the changeling kind:\n   No portion for her own she has to spare,\n   So much she dotes on her adopted care.\n\n   Poets are bubbles, by the town drawn in,\n   Suffered at first some trifling stakes to win:\n   But what unequal hazards do they run!\n   Each time they write they venture all they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve won:\n   The Squire that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buttered still, is sure to be undone.\n   This author, heretofore, has found your favour,\n   But pleads no merit from his past behaviour.\n   To build on that might prove a vain presumption,\n   Should grants to poets made admit resumption,\n   And in Parnassus he must lose his seat,\n   If that be found a forfeited estate.\n\n   He owns, with toil he wrought the following scenes,\n   But if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re naught ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er spare him for his pains:\n   Damn him the more; have no commiseration\n   For dulness on mature deliberation.\n   He swears he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not resent one hissed-off scene,\n   Nor, like those peevish wits, his play maintain,\n   Who, to assert their sense, your taste arraign.\n   Some plot we think he has, and some new thought;\n   Some humour too, no farce\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fault.\n   Satire, he thinks, you ought not to expect;\n   For so reformed a town who dares correct?\n   To please, this time, has been his sole pretence,\n   He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not instruct, lest it should give offence.\n   Should he by chance a knave or fool expose,\n   That hurts none here, sure here are none of those.\n   In short, our play shall (with your leave to show it)\n   Give you one instance of a passive poet,\n   Who to your judgments yields all resignation:\n   So save or damn, after your own discretion.\n\n\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c3\u0086.\n\n                                 MEN.\nFAINALL, in love with Mrs. Marwood,              _Mr. Betterton_.\nMIRABELL, in love with Mrs. Millamant,           _Mr. Verbruggen_.\nWITWOUD, follower of Mrs. Millamant,             _Mr. Bowen_.\nPETULANT, follower of Mrs. Millamant,            _Mr. Bowman_.\nSIR WILFULL WITWOUD, half brother to Witwoud,    _Mr. Underhill_.\nand nephew to Lady Wishfort,\nWAITWELL, servant to Mirabell,                   _Mr. Bright_.\n                                WOMEN.\nLADY WISHFORT, enemy to Mirabell, for having     _Mrs. Leigh_.\nfalsely pretended love to her,\nMRS.

No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you your revenge another time, when you are not so\nindifferent; you are thinking of something else now, and play too\nnegligently: the coldness of a losing gamester lessens the pleasure of\nthe winner.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d no more play with a man that slighted his ill fortune\nthan I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make love to a woman who undervalued the loss of her reputation.\n\nMIRA.  You have a taste extremely delicate, and are for refining on your\npleasures.\n\nFAIN.  Prithee, why so reserved?  Something has put you out of humour.\n\nMIRA.  Not at all: I happen to be grave to-day, and you are gay; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall.\n\nFAIN.  Confess, Millamant and you quarrelled last night, after I left\nyou; my fair cousin has some humours that would tempt the patience of a\nStoic.  What, some coxcomb came in, and was well received by her, while\nyou were by?\n\nMIRA.  Witwoud and Petulant, and what was worse, her aunt, your wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmother, my evil genius\u00e2\u0080\u0094or to sum up all in her own name, my old Lady\nWishfort came in.\n\nFAIN.  Oh, there it is then: she has a lasting passion for you, and with\nreason.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What, then my wife was there?\n\nMIRA.  Yes, and Mrs. Marwood and three or four more, whom I never saw\nbefore; seeing me, they all put on their grave faces, whispered one\nanother, then complained aloud of the vapours, and after fell into a\nprofound silence.\n\nFAIN.  They had a mind to be rid of you.\n\nMIRA.  For which reason I resolved not to stir.  At last the good old\nlady broke through her painful taciturnity with an invective against long\nvisits.  I would not have understood her, but Millamant joining in the\nargument, I rose and with a constrained smile told her, I thought nothing\nwas so easy as to know when a visit began to be troublesome; she reddened\nand I withdrew, without expecting her reply.\n\nFAIN.  You were to blame to resent what she spoke only in compliance with\nher aunt.\n\nMIRA.  She is more mistress of herself than to be under the necessity of\nsuch a resignation.\n\nFAIN.  What? though half her fortune depends upon her marrying with my\nlady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approbation?\n\nMIRA.  I was then in such a humour, that I should have been better\npleased if she had been less discreet.\n\nFAIN.  Now I remember, I wonder not they were weary of you; last night\nwas one of their cabal-nights: they have \u00e2\u0080\u0099em three times a week and meet\nby turns at one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartments, where they come together like the\ncoroner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inquest, to sit upon the murdered reputations of the week.  You\nand I are excluded, and it was once proposed that all the male sex should\nbe excepted; but somebody moved that to avoid scandal there might be one\nman of the community, upon which motion Witwoud and Petulant were\nenrolled members.\n\nMIRA.  And who may have been the foundress of this sect?  My Lady\nWishfort, I warrant, who publishes her detestation of mankind, and full\nof the vigour of fifty-five, declares for a friend and ratafia; and let\nposterity shift for itself, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll breed no more.\n\nFAIN.  The discovery of your sham addresses to her, to conceal your love\nto her niece, has provoked this separation.  Had you dissembled better,\nthings might have continued in the state of nature.\n\nMIRA.  I did as much as man could, with any reasonable conscience; I\nproceeded to the very last act of flattery with her, and was guilty of a\nsong in her commendation.  Nay, I got a friend to put her into a lampoon,\nand compliment her with the imputation of an affair with a young fellow,\nwhich I carried so far, that I told her the malicious town took notice\nthat she was grown fat of a sudden; and when she lay in of a dropsy,\npersuaded her she was reported to be in labour.  The devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, if an\nold woman is to be flattered further, unless a man should endeavour\ndownright personally to debauch her: and that my virtue forbade me.  But\nfor the discovery of this amour, I am indebted to your friend, or your\nwife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend, Mrs. Marwood.\n\nFAIN.  What should provoke her to be your enemy, unless she has made you\nadvances which you have slighted?  Women do not easily forgive omissions\nof that nature.\n\nMIRA.  She was always civil to me, till of late.  I confess I am not one\nof those coxcombs who are apt to interpret a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good manners to her\nprejudice, and think that she who does not refuse \u00e2\u0080\u0099em everything can\nrefuse \u00e2\u0080\u0099em nothing.\n\nFAIN.  You are a gallant man, Mirabell; and though you may have cruelty\nenough not to satisfy a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longing, you have too much generosity not\nto be tender of her honour.  Yet you speak with an indifference which\nseems to be affected, and confesses you are conscious of a negligence.\n\nMIRA.  You pursue the argument with a distrust that seems to be\nunaffected, and confesses you are conscious of a concern for which the\nlady is more indebted to you than is your wife.\n\nFAIN.  Fie, fie, friend, if you grow censorious I must leave you:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nlook upon the gamesters in the next room.\n\nMIRA.  Who are they?\n\nFAIN.  Petulant and Witwoud.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bring me some chocolate.\n\nMIRA.  Betty, what says your clock?\n\nBET.  Turned of the last canonical hour, sir.\n\nMIRA.  How pertinently the jade answers me!  Ha! almost one a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clock!\n[_Looking on his watch_.]  Oh, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099are come!\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                         MIRABELL _and_ FOOTMAN.\n\nMIRA.  Well, is the grand affair over?  You have been something tedious.\n\nSERV.  Sir, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such coupling at Pancras that they stand behind one\nanother, as \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere in a country-dance.  Ours was the last couple to lead\nup; and no hopes appearing of dispatch, besides, the parson growing\nhoarse, we were afraid his lungs would have failed before it came to our\nturn; so we drove round to Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Place, and there they were riveted in a\ntrice.\n\nMIRA.  So, so; you are sure they are married?\n\nSERV.  Married and bedded, sir; I am witness.\n\nMIRA.  Have you the certificate?\n\nSERV.  Here it is, sir.\n\nMIRA.  Has the tailor brought Waitwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothes home, and the new\nliveries?\n\nSERV.  Yes, sir.\n\nMIRA.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well.  Do you go home again, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear, and adjourn the\nconsummation till farther order; bid Waitwell shake his ears, and Dame\nPartlet rustle up her feathers, and meet me at one a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clock by Rosamond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npond, that I may see her before she returns to her lady.  And, as you\ntender your ears, be secret.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                        MIRABELL, FAINALL, BETTY.\n\nFAIN.  Joy of your success, Mirabell; you look pleased.\n\nMIRA.  Ay; I have been engaged in a matter of some sort of mirth, which\nis not yet ripe for discovery.  I am glad this is not a cabal-night.  I\nwonder, Fainall, that you who are married, and of consequence should be\ndiscreet, will suffer your wife to be of such a party.\n\nFAIN.  Faith, I am not jealous.  Besides, most who are engaged are women\nand relations; and for the men, they are of a kind too contemptible to\ngive scandal.\n\nMIRA.  I am of another opinion: the greater the coxcomb, always the more\nthe scandal; for a woman who is not a fool can have but one reason for\nassociating with a man who is one.\n\nFAIN.  Are you jealous as often as you see Witwoud entertained by\nMillamant?\n\nMIRA.  Of her understanding I am, if not of her person.\n\nFAIN.  You do her wrong; for, to give her her due, she has wit.\n\nMIRA.  She has beauty enough to make any man think so, and complaisance\nenough not to contradict him who shall tell her so.\n\nFAIN.  For a passionate lover methinks you are a man somewhat too\ndiscerning in the failings of your mistress.\n\nMIRA.  And for a discerning man somewhat too passionate a lover, for I\nlike her with all her faults; nay, like her for her faults.  Her follies\nare so natural, or so artful, that they become her, and those\naffectations which in another woman would be odious serve but to make her\nmore agreeable.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell thee, Fainall, she once used me with that\ninsolence that in revenge I took her to pieces, sifted her, and separated\nher failings: I studied \u00e2\u0080\u0099em and got \u00e2\u0080\u0099em by rote.  The catalogue was so\nlarge that I was not without hopes, one day or other, to hate her\nheartily.  To which end I so used myself to think of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, that at length,\ncontrary to my design and expectation, they gave me every hour less and\nless disturbance, till in a few days it became habitual to me to remember\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099em without being displeased.  They are now grown as familiar to me as my\nown frailties, and in all probability in a little time longer I shall\nlike \u00e2\u0080\u0099em as well.\n\nFAIN.  Marry her, marry her; be half as well acquainted with her charms\nas you are with her defects, and, my life on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, you are your own man\nagain.\n\nMIRA.  Say you so?\n\nFAIN.  Ay, ay; I have experience.  I have a wife, and so forth.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                          [_To them_] MESSENGER.\n\nMESS.  Is one Squire Witwoud here?\n\nBET.  Yes; what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your business?\n\nMESS.  I have a letter for him, from his brother Sir Wilfull, which I am\ncharged to deliver into his own hands.\n\nBET.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the next room, friend.  That way.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n                        MIRABELL, FAINALL, BETTY.\n\nMIRA.  What, is the chief of that noble family in town, Sir Wilfull\nWitwoud?\n\nFAIN.  He is expected to-day.  Do you know him?\n\nMIRA.  I have seen him; he promises to be an extraordinary person.  I\nthink you have the honour to be related to him.\n\nFAIN.  Yes; he is half-brother to this Witwoud by a former wife, who was\nsister to my Lady Wishfort, my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother.  If you marry Millamant,\nyou must call cousins too.\n\nMIRA.  I had rather be his relation than his acquaintance.\n\nFAIN.  He comes to town in order to equip himself for travel.\n\nMIRA.  For travel!  Why the man that I mean is above forty.\n\nFAIN.  No matter for that; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis for the honour of England that all Europe\nshould know we have blockheads of all ages.\n\nMIRA.  I wonder there is not an act of parliament to save the credit of\nthe nation and prohibit the exportation of fools.\n\nFAIN.  By no means, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis better as \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis better to trade with a\nlittle loss, than to be quite eaten up with being overstocked.\n\nMIRA.  Pray, are the follies of this knight-errant and those of the\nsquire, his brother, anything related?\n\nFAIN.  Not at all: Witwoud grows by the knight like a medlar grafted on a\ncrab.  One will melt in your mouth and t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other set your teeth on edge;\none is all pulp and the other all core.\n\nMIRA.  So one will be rotten before he be ripe, and the other will be\nrotten without ever being ripe at all.\n\nFAIN.  Sir Wilfull is an odd mixture of bashfulness and obstinacy.  But\nwhen he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drunk, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as loving as the monster in The Tempest, and much\nafter the same manner.  To give bother his due, he has something of\ngood-nature, and does not always want wit.\n\nMIRA.  Not always: but as often as his memory fails him and his\ncommonplace of comparisons.  He is a fool with a good memory and some few\nscraps of other folks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wit.  He is one whose conversation can never be\napproved, yet it is now and then to be endured.  He has indeed one good\nquality: he is not exceptious, for he so passionately affects the\nreputation of understanding raillery that he will construe an affront\ninto a jest, and call downright rudeness and ill language satire and\nfire.\n\nFAIN.  If you have a mind to finish his picture, you have an opportunity\nto do it at full length.  Behold the original.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] WITWOUD.\n\nWIT.  Afford me your compassion, my dears; pity me, Fainall, Mirabell,\npity me.\n\nMIRA.  I do from my soul.\n\nFAIN.  Why, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nWIT.  No letters for me, Betty?\n\nBET.  Did not a messenger bring you one but now, sir?\n\nWIT.  Ay; but no other?\n\nBET.  No, sir.\n\nWIT.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very hard.  A messenger, a mule, a beast of\nburden, he has brought me a letter from the fool my brother, as heavy as\na panegyric in a funeral sermon, or a copy of commendatory verses from\none poet to another.  And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as sure a forerunner of the\nauthor as an epistle dedicatory.\n\nMIRA.  A fool, and your brother, Witwoud?\n\nWIT.  Ay, ay, my half-brother.  My half-brother he is, no nearer, upon\nhonour.\n\nMIRA.  Then \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis possible he may be but half a fool.\n\nWIT.  Good, good, Mirabell, _le dr\u00c3\u00b4le_!  Good, good, hang him, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk of him.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fainall, how does your lady?  Gad, I say anything in\nthe world to get this fellow out of my head.  I beg pardon that I should\nask a man of pleasure and the town a question at once so foreign and\ndomestic.  But I talk like an old maid at a marriage, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I\nsay: but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best woman in the world.\n\nFAIN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis well you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you say, or else your commendation\nwould go near to make me either vain or jealous.\n\nWIT.  No man in town lives well with a wife but Fainall.  Your judgment,\nMirabell?\n\nMIRA.  You had better step and ask his wife, if you would be credibly\ninformed.\n\nWIT.  Mirabell!\n\nMIRA.  Ay.\n\nWIT.  My dear, I ask ten thousand pardons.  Gad, I have forgot what I was\ngoing to say to you.\n\nMIRA.  I thank you heartily, heartily.\n\nWIT.  No, but prithee excuse me:\u00e2\u0080\u0094my memory is such a memory.\n\nMIRA.  Have a care of such apologies, Witwoud; for I never knew a fool\nbut he affected to complain either of the spleen or his memory.\n\nFAIN.  What have you done with Petulant?\n\nWIT.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reckoning his money; my money it was: I have no luck to-day.\n\nFAIN.  You may allow him to win of you at play, for you are sure to be\ntoo hard for him at repartee: since you monopolise the wit that is\nbetween you, the fortune must be his of course.\n\nMIRA.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find that Petulant confesses the superiority of wit to be\nyour talent, Witwoud.\n\nWIT.  Come, come, you are malicious now, and would breed debates.\nPetulant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my friend, and a very honest fellow, and a very pretty fellow,\nand has a smattering\u00e2\u0080\u0094faith and troth, a pretty deal of an odd sort of a\nsmall wit: nay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do him justice.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m his friend, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong him.\nAnd if he had any judgment in the world, he would not be altogether\ncontemptible.  Come, come, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t detract from the merits of my friend.\n\nFAIN.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take your friend to be over-nicely bred?\n\nWIT.  No, no, hang him, the rogue has no manners at all, that I must own;\nno more breeding than a bum-baily, that I grant you:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis pity; the\nfellow has fire and life.\n\nMIRA.  What, courage?\n\nWIT.  Hum, faith, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know as to that, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say as to that.  Yes,\nfaith, in a controversy he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll contradict anybody.\n\nMIRA.  Though \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere a man whom he feared or a woman whom he loved.\n\nWIT.  Well, well, he does not always think before he speaks.  We have all\nour failings; you are too hard upon him, you are, faith.  Let me excuse\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can defend most of his faults, except one or two; one he has,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the truth on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if he were my brother I could not acquit him\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\nindeed I could wish were otherwise.\n\nMIRA.  Ay, marry, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that, Witwoud?\n\nWIT.  Oh, pardon me.  Expose the infirmities of my friend?  No, my dear,\nexcuse me there.\n\nFAIN.  What, I warrant he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsincere, or \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis some such trifle.\n\nWIT.  No, no; what if he be?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis no matter for that, his wit will\nexcuse that.  A wit should no more be sincere than a woman constant: one\nargues a decay of parts, as t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other of beauty.\n\nMIRA.  Maybe you think him too positive?\n\nWIT.  No, no; his being positive is an incentive to argument, and keeps\nup conversation.\n\nFAIN.  Too illiterate?\n\nWIT.  That?  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his happiness.  His want of learning gives him the\nmore opportunities to show his natural parts.\n\nMIRA.  He wants words?\n\nWIT.  Ay; but I like him for that now: for his want of words gives me the\npleasure very often to explain his meaning.\n\nFAIN.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impudent?\n\nWIT.  No that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not it.\n\nMIRA.  Vain?\n\nWIT.  No.\n\nMIRA.  What, he speaks unseasonable truths sometimes, because he has not\nwit enough to invent an evasion?\n\nWIT.  Truths?  Ha, ha, ha!  No, no, since you will have it, I mean he\nnever speaks truth at all, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.  He will lie like a chambermaid,\nor a woman of quality\u00e2\u0080\u0099s porter.  Now that is a fault.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                          [_To them_] COACHMAN.\n\nCOACH.  Is Master Petulant here, mistress?\n\nBET.  Yes.\n\nCOACH.  Three gentlewomen in a coach would speak with him.\n\nFAIN.  O brave Petulant!  Three!\n\nBET.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell him.\n\nCOACH.  You must bring two dishes of chocolate and a glass of cinnamon\nwater.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                       MIRABELL, FAINALL, WITWOUD.\n\nWIT.  That should be for two fasting strumpets, and a bawd troubled with\nwind.  Now you may know what the three are.\n\nMIRA.  You are very free with your friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquaintance.\n\nWIT.  Ay, ay; friendship without freedom is as dull as love without\nenjoyment or wine without toasting: but to tell you a secret, these are\ntrulls whom he allows coach-hire, and something more by the week, to call\non him once a day at public places.\n\nMIRA.  How!\n\nWIT.  You shall see he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to \u00e2\u0080\u0099em because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more company\nhere to take notice of him.  Why, this is nothing to what he used to\ndo:\u00e2\u0080\u0094before he found out this way, I have known him call for himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFAIN.  Call for himself?  What dost thou mean?\n\nWIT.  Mean?  Why he would slip you out of this chocolate-house, just when\nyou had been talking to him.  As soon as your back was turned\u00e2\u0080\u0094whip he was\ngone; then trip to his lodging, clap on a hood and scarf and a mask, slap\ninto a hackney-coach, and drive hither to the door again in a trice;\nwhere he would send in for himself; that I mean, call for himself, wait\nfor himself, nay, and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, not finding himself, sometimes leave a\nletter for himself.\n\nMIRA.  I confess this is something extraordinary.  I believe he waits for\nhimself now, he is so long a coming; oh, I ask his pardon.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n               PETULANT, MIRABELL, FAINALL, WITWOUD, BETTY.\n\nBET.  Sir, the coach stays.\n\nPET.  Well, well, I come.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sbud, a man had as good be a professed\nmidwife as a professed whoremaster, at this rate; to be knocked up and\nraised at all hours, and in all places.  Pox on \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye\nhear, tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099em I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come.  Let \u00e2\u0080\u0099em snivel and cry their hearts out.\n\nFAIN.  You are very cruel, Petulant.\n\nPET.  All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one, let it pass.  I have a humour to be cruel.\n\nMIRA.  I hope they are not persons of condition that you use at this\nrate.\n\nPET.  Condition?  Condition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dried fig, if I am not in humour.  By\nthis hand, if they were your\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\u00e2\u0080\u0094your what-d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee-call-\u00e2\u0080\u0099ems themselves,\nthey must wait or rub off, if I want appetite.\n\nMIRA.  What-d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee-call-\u00e2\u0080\u0099ems!  What are they, Witwoud?\n\nWIT.  Empresses, my dear.  By your what-d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee-call-\u00e2\u0080\u0099ems he means Sultana\nQueens.\n\nPET.  Ay, Roxolanas.\n\nMIRA.  Cry you mercy.\n\nFAIN.  Witwoud says they are\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nPET.  What does he say th\u00e2\u0080\u0099are?\n\nWIT.  I?  Fine ladies, I say.\n\nPET.  Pass on, Witwoud.  Harkee, by this light, his relations\u00e2\u0080\u0094two\nco-heiresses his cousins, and an old aunt, who loves cater-wauling better\nthan a conventicle.\n\nWIT.  Ha, ha, ha!  I had a mind to see how the rogue would come off.  Ha,\nha, ha!  Gad, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be angry with him, if he had said they were my\nmother and my sisters.\n\nMIRA.  No?\n\nWIT.  No; the rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wit and readiness of invention charm me, dear\nPetulant.\n\nBET.  They are gone, sir, in great anger.\n\nPET.  Enough, let \u00e2\u0080\u0099em trundle.  Anger helps complexion, saves paint.\n\nFAIN.  This continence is all dissembled; this is in order to have\nsomething to brag of the next time he makes court to Millamant, and swear\nhe has abandoned the whole sex for her sake.\n\nMIRA.  Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?  I\nshall cut your throat, sometime or other, Petulant, about that business.\n\nPET.  Ay, ay, let that pass.  There are other throats to be cut.\n\nMIRA.  Meaning mine, sir?\n\nPET.  Not I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know nothing.  But there are uncles and\nnephews in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they may be rivals.  What then?  All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one for\nthat.\n\nMIRA.  How?  Harkee, Petulant, come hither.  Explain, or I shall call\nyour interpreter.\n\nPET.  Explain?  I know nothing.  Why, you have an uncle, have you not,\nlately come to town, and lodges by my Lady Wishfort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\n\nMIRA.  True.\n\nPET.  Why, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough.  You and he are not friends; and if he should\nmarry and have a child, yon may be disinherited, ha!\n\nMIRA.  Where hast thou stumbled upon all this truth?\n\nPET.  All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one for that; why, then, say I know something.\n\nMIRA.  Come, thou art an honest fellow, Petulant, and shalt make love to\nmy mistress, thou shalt, faith.  What hast thou heard of my uncle?\n\nPET.  I?  Nothing, I.  If throats are to be cut, let swords clash.\nSnug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the word; I shrug and am silent.\n\nMIRA.  Oh, raillery, raillery!  Come, I know thou art in the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsecrets.  What, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a cabalist; I know you stayed at Millamant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last\nnight after I went.  Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?  Tell\nme; if thou hadst but good nature equal to thy wit, Petulant, Tony\nWitwoud, who is now thy competitor in fame, would show as dim by thee as\na dead whiting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye by a pearl of orient; he would no more be seen by\nthee than Mercury is by the sun: come, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure thou wo\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me.\n\nPET.  If I do, will you grant me common sense, then, for the future?\n\nMIRA.  Faith, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do what I can for thee, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pray that heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n may\ngrant it thee in the meantime.\n\nPET.  Well, harkee.\n\nFAIN.  Petulant and you both will find Mirabell as warm a rival as a\nlover.\n\nWIT.  Pshaw, pshaw, that she laughs at Petulant is plain.  And for my\npart, but that it is almost a fashion to admire her, I should\u00e2\u0080\u0094harkee\u00e2\u0080\u0094to\ntell you a secret, but let it go no further between friends, I shall\nnever break my heart for her.\n\nFAIN.  How?\n\nWIT.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handsome; but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sort of an uncertain woman.\n\nFAIN.  I thought you had died for her.\n\nWIT.  Umh\u00e2\u0080\u0094no\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFAIN.  She has wit.\n\nWIT.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis what she will hardly allow anybody else.  Now, demme, I should\nhate that, if she were as handsome as Cleopatra.  Mirabell is not so sure\nof her as he thinks for.\n\nFAIN.  Why do you think so?\n\nWIT.  We stayed pretty late there last night, and heard something of an\nuncle to Mirabell, who is lately come to town, and is between him and the\nbest part of his estate.  Mirabell and he are at some distance, as my\nLady Wishfort has been told; and you know she hates Mirabell worse than a\nquaker hates a parrot, or than a fishmonger hates a hard frost.  Whether\nthis uncle has seen Mrs. Millamant or not, I cannot say; but there were\nitems of such a treaty being in embryo; and if it should come to life,\npoor Mirabell would be in some sort unfortunately fobbed, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith.\n\nFAIN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis impossible Millamant should hearken to it.\n\nWIT.  Faith, my dear, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a woman and a kind of a\nhumorist.\n\nMIRA.  And this is the sum of what you could collect last night?\n\nPET.  The quintessence.  Maybe Witwoud knows more; he stayed longer.\nBesides, they never mind him; they say anything before him.\n\nMIRA.  I thought you had been the greatest favourite.\n\nPET.  Ay, t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate; but not in public, because I make remarks.\n\nMIRA.  You do?\n\nPET.  Ay, ay, pox, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m malicious, man.  Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soft, you know, they are\nnot in awe of him.  The fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well bred, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you call a\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye-call-\u00e2\u0080\u0099em\u00e2\u0080\u0094a fine gentleman, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silly withal.\n\nMIRA.  I thank you, I know as much as my curiosity requires.  Fainall,\nare you for the Mall?\n\nFAIN.  Ay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a turn before dinner.\n\nWIT.  Ay, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all walk in the park; the ladies talked of being there.\n\nMIRA.  I thought you were obliged to watch for your brother Sir Wilfull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narrival.\n\nWIT.  No, no, he comes to his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, my Lady Wishfort; pox on him, I\nshall be troubled with him too; what shall I do with the fool?\n\nPET.  Beg him for his estate, that I may beg you afterwards, and so have\nbut one trouble with you both.\n\nWIT.  O rare Petulant, thou art as quick as fire in a frosty morning;\nthou shalt to the Mall with us, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be very severe.\n\nPET.  Enough; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a humour to be severe.\n\nMIRA.  Are you?  Pray then walk by yourselves.  Let not us be accessory\nto your putting the ladies out of countenance with your senseless\nribaldry, which you roar out aloud as often as they pass by you, and when\nyou have made a handsome woman blush, then you think you have been\nsevere.\n\nPET.  What, what?  Then let \u00e2\u0080\u0099em either show their innocence by not\nunderstanding what they hear, or else show their discretion by not\nhearing what they would not be thought to understand.\n\nMIRA.  But hast not thou then sense enough to know that thou ought\u00e2\u0080\u0099st to\nbe most ashamed thyself when thou hast put another out of countenance?\n\nPET.  Not I, by this hand: I always take blushing either for a sign of\nguilt or ill-breeding.\n\nMIRA.  I confess you ought to think so.  You are in the right, that you\nmay plead the error of your judgment in defence of your practice.\n\n   Where modesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ill manners, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis but fit\n   That impudence and malice pass for wit.\n\n\n\n\nACT II.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                           _St. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park_.\n\n                     MRS. FAINALL _and_ MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Ay, ay, dear Marwood, if we will be happy, we must find the\nmeans in ourselves, and among ourselves.  Men are ever in extremes;\neither doting or averse.  While they are lovers, if they have fire and\nsense, their jealousies are insupportable: and when they cease to love\n(we ought to think at least) they loathe, they look upon us with horror\nand distaste, they meet us like the ghosts of what we were, and as from\nsuch, fly from us.\n\nMRS. MAR.  True, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis an unhappy circumstance of life that love should\never die before us, and that the man so often should outlive the lover.\nBut say what you will, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis better to be left than never to have been\nloved.  To pass our youth in dull indifference, to refuse the sweets of\nlife because they once must leave us, is as preposterous as to wish to\nhave been born old, because we one day must be old.  For my part, my\nyouth may wear and waste, but it shall never rust in my possession.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Then it seems you dissemble an aversion to mankind only in\ncompliance to my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humour.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Certainly.  To be free, I have no taste of those insipid dry\ndiscourses with which our sex of force must entertain themselves apart\nfrom men.  We may affect endearments to each other, profess eternal\nfriendships, and seem to dote like lovers; but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not in our natures\nlong to persevere.  Love will resume his empire in our breasts, and every\nheart, or soon or late, receive and readmit him as its lawful tyrant.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Bless me, how have I been deceived!  Why, you profess a\nlibertine.\n\nMRS. MAR.  You see my friendship by my freedom.  Come, be as sincere,\nacknowledge that your sentiments agree with mine.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Never.\n\nMRS. MAR.  You hate mankind?\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Heartily, inveterately.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Your husband?\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Most transcendently; ay, though I say it, meritoriously.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Give me your hand upon it.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  There.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I join with you; what I have said has been to try you.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Is it possible?  Dost thou hate those vipers, men?\n\nMRS. MAR.  I have done hating \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, and am now come to despise \u00e2\u0080\u0099em; the\nnext thing I have to do is eternally to forget \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  There spoke the spirit of an Amazon, a Penthesilea.\n\nMRS. MAR.  And yet I am thinking sometimes to carry my aversion further.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  How?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Faith, by marrying; if I could but find one that loved me very\nwell, and would be throughly sensible of ill usage, I think I should do\nmyself the violence of undergoing the ceremony.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  You would not make him a cuckold?\n\nMRS. MAR.  No; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make him believe I did, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as bad.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Why had not you as good do it?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Oh, if he should ever discover it, he would then know the\nworst, and be out of his pain; but I would have him ever to continue upon\nthe rack of fear and jealousy.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Ingenious mischief!  Would thou wert married to Mirabell.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Would I were.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  You change colour.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Because I hate him.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  So do I; but I can hear him named.  But what reason have you\nto hate him in particular?\n\nMRS. MAR.  I never loved him; he is, and always was, insufferably proud.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  By the reason you give for your aversion, one would think it\ndissembled; for you have laid a fault to his charge, of which his enemies\nmust acquit him.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Oh, then it seems you are one of his favourable enemies.\nMethinks you look a little pale, and now you flush again.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Do I?  I think I am a little sick o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the sudden.\n\nMRS. MAR.  What ails you?\n\nMRS. FAIN.  My husband.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see him?  He turned short upon me\nunawares, and has almost overcome me.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                   [_To them_] FAINALL _and_ MIRABELL.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Ha, ha, ha! he comes opportunely for you.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  For you, for he has brought Mirabell with him.\n\nFAIN.  My dear.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  My soul.\n\nFAIN.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look well to-day, child.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think so?\n\nMIRA.  He is the only man that does, madam.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  The only man that would tell me so at least, and the only man\nfrom whom I could hear it without mortification.\n\nFAIN.  Oh, my dear, I am satisfied of your tenderness; I know you cannot\nresent anything from me; especially what is an effect of my concern.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Mr. Mirabell, my mother interrupted you in a pleasant\nrelation last night: I would fain hear it out.\n\nMIRA.  The persons concerned in that affair have yet a tolerable\nreputation.  I am afraid Mr. Fainall will be censorious.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  He has a humour more prevailing than his curiosity, and will\nwillingly dispense with the hearing of one scandalous story, to avoid\ngiving an occasion to make another by being seen to walk with his wife.\nThis way, Mr. Mirabell, and I dare promise you will oblige us both.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                          FAINALL, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nFAIN.  Excellent creature!  Well, sure, if I should live to be rid of my\nwife, I should be a miserable man.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Ay?\n\nFAIN.  For having only that one hope, the accomplishment of it of\nconsequence must put an end to all my hopes, and what a wretch is he who\nmust survive his hopes!  Nothing remains when that day comes but to sit\ndown and weep like Alexander when he wanted other worlds to conquer.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Will you not follow \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?\n\nFAIN.  Faith, I think not,\n\nMRS. MAR.  Pray let us; I have a reason.\n\nFAIN.  You are not jealous?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Of whom?\n\nFAIN.  Of Mirabell.\n\nMRS. MAR.  If I am, is it inconsistent with my love to you that I am\ntender of your honour?\n\nFAIN.  You would intimate then, as if there were a fellow-feeling between\nmy wife and him?\n\nMRS. MAR.  I think she does not hate him to that degree she would be\nthought.\n\nFAIN.  But he, I fear, is too insensible.\n\nMRS. MAR.  It may be you are deceived.\n\nFAIN.  It may be so.  I do not now begin to apprehend it.\n\nMRS. MAR.  What?\n\nFAIN.  That I have been deceived, madam, and you are false.\n\nMRS. MAR.  That I am false?  What mean you?\n\nFAIN.  To let you know I see through all your little arts.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come, you both\nlove him, and both have equally dissembled your aversion.  Your mutual\njealousies of one another have made you clash till you have both struck\nfire.  I have seen the warm confession red\u00e2\u0080\u0099ning on your cheeks, and\nsparkling from your eyes.\n\nMRS. MAR.  You do me wrong.\n\nFAIN.  I do not.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas for my ease to oversee and wilfully neglect the\ngross advances made him by my wife, that by permitting her to be engaged,\nI might continue unsuspected in my pleasures, and take you oftener to my\narms in full security.  But could you think, because the nodding husband\nwould not wake, that e\u00e2\u0080\u0099er the watchful lover slept?\n\nMRS. MAR.  And wherewithal can you reproach me?\n\nFAIN.  With infidelity, with loving another, with love of Mirabell.\n\nMRS. MAR.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis false.  I challenge you to show an instance that can\nconfirm your groundless accusation.  I hate him.\n\nFAIN.  And wherefore do you hate him?  He is insensible, and your\nresentment follows his neglect.  An instance?  The injuries you have done\nhim are a proof: your interposing in his love.  What cause had you to\nmake discoveries of his pretended passion?  To undeceive the credulous\naunt, and be the officious obstacle of his match with Millamant?\n\nMRS. MAR.  My obligations to my lady urged me: I had professed a\nfriendship to her, and could not see her easy nature so abused by that\ndissembler.\n\nFAIN.  What, was it conscience then?  Professed a friendship!  Oh, the\npious friendships of the female sex!\n\nMRS. MAR.  More tender, more sincere, and more enduring, than all the\nvain and empty vows of men, whether professing love to us or mutual faith\nto one another.\n\nFAIN.  Ha, ha, ha! you are my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend too.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Shame and ingratitude!  Do you reproach me?  You, you upbraid\nme?  Have I been false to her, through strict fidelity to you, and\nsacrificed my friendship to keep my love inviolate?  And have you the\nbaseness to charge me with the guilt, unmindful of the merit?  To you it\nshould be meritorious that I have been vicious.  And do you reflect that\nguilt upon me which should lie buried in your bosom?\n\nFAIN.  You misinterpret my reproof.  I meant but to remind you of the\nslight account you once could make of strictest ties when set in\ncompetition with your love to me.\n\nMRS. MAR.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis false, you urged it with deliberate malice.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas spoke\nin scorn, and I never will forgive it.\n\nFAIN.  Your guilt, not your resentment, begets your rage.  If yet you\nloved, you could forgive a jealousy: but you are stung to find you are\ndiscovered.\n\nMRS. MAR.  It shall be all discovered.  You too shall be discovered; be\nsure you shall.  I can but be exposed.  If I do it myself I shall prevent\nyour baseness.\n\nFAIN.  Why, what will you do?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Disclose it to your wife; own what has past between us.\n\nFAIN.  Frenzy!\n\nMRS. MAR.  By all my wrongs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll publish to the world the\ninjuries you have done me, both in my fame and fortune: with both I\ntrusted you, you bankrupt in honour, as indigent of wealth.\n\nFAIN.  Your fame I have preserved.  Your fortune has been bestowed as the\nprodigality of your love would have it, in pleasures which we both have\nshared.  Yet, had not you been false I had e\u00e2\u0080\u0099er this repaid it.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis\ntrue\u00e2\u0080\u0094had you permitted Mirabell with Millamant to have stolen their\nmarriage, my lady had been incensed beyond all means of reconcilement:\nMillamant had forfeited the moiety of her fortune, which then would have\ndescended to my wife.  And wherefore did I marry but to make lawful prize\nof a rich widow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealth, and squander it on love and you?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Deceit and frivolous pretence!\n\nFAIN.  Death, am I not married?  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretence?  Am I not imprisoned,\nfettered?  Have I not a wife?  Nay, a wife that was a widow, a young\nwidow, a handsome widow, and would be again a widow, but that I have a\nheart of proof, and something of a constitution to bustle through the\nways of wedlock and this world.  Will you yet be reconciled to truth and\nme?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Impossible.  Truth and you are inconsistent.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hate you, and\nshall for ever.\n\nFAIN.  For loving you?\n\nMRS. MAR.  I loathe the name of love after such usage; and next to the\nguilt with which you would asperse me, I scorn you most.  Farewell.\n\nFAIN.  Nay, we must not part thus.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Let me go.\n\nFAIN.  Come, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I care not.  Let me go.  Break my hands, do\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d leave \u00e2\u0080\u0099em to\nget loose.\n\nFAIN.  I would not hurt you for the world.  Have I no other hold to keep\nyou here?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Well, I have deserved it all.\n\nFAIN.  You know I love you.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Poor dissembling!  Oh, that\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, it is not yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFAIN.  What?  What is it not?  What is it not yet?  It is not yet too\nlate\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. MAR.  No, it is not yet too late\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have that comfort.\n\nFAIN.  It is, to love another.\n\nMRS. MAR.  But not to loathe, detest, abhor mankind, myself, and the\nwhole treacherous world.\n\nFAIN.  Nay, this is extravagance.  Come, I ask your pardon.  No tears\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwas to blame, I could not love you and be easy in my doubts.  Pray\nforbear\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe you; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done you wrong; and any way,\nevery way will make amends: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hate my wife yet more, damn her, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\npart with her, rob her of all she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll retire somewhere,\nanywhere, to another world; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry thee\u00e2\u0080\u0094be pacified.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, they\ncome: hide your face, your tears.  You have a mask: wear it a moment.\nThis way, this way: be persuaded.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                       MIRABELL _and_ MRS. FAINALL.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  They are here yet.\n\nMIRA.  They are turning into the other walk.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  While I only hated my husband, I could bear to see him; but\nsince I have despised him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too offensive.\n\nMIRA.  Oh, you should hate with prudence.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Yes, for I have loved with indiscretion.\n\nMIRA.  You should have just so much disgust for your husband as may be\nsufficient to make you relish your lover.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  You have been the cause that I have loved without bounds, and\nwould you set limits to that aversion of which you have been the\noccasion?  Why did you make me marry this man?\n\nMIRA.  Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dangerous actions?  To\nsave that idol, reputation.  If the familiarities of our loves had\nproduced that consequence of which you were apprehensive, where could you\nhave fixed a father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name with credit but on a husband?  I knew Fainall\nto be a man lavish of his morals, an interested and professing friend, a\nfalse and a designing lover, yet one whose wit and outward fair behaviour\nhave gained a reputation with the town, enough to make that woman stand\nexcused who has suffered herself to be won by his addresses.  A better\nman ought not to have been sacrificed to the occasion; a worse had not\nanswered to the purpose.  When you are weary of him you know your remedy.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I ought to stand in some degree of credit with you, Mirabell.\n\nMIRA.  In justice to you, I have made you privy to my whole design, and\nput it in your power to ruin or advance my fortune.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Whom have you instructed to represent your pretended uncle?\n\nMIRA.  Waitwell, my servant.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  He is an humble servant to Foible, my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woman, and may\nwin her to your interest.\n\nMIRA.  Care is taken for that.  She is won and worn by this time.  They\nwere married this morning.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Who?\n\nMIRA.  Waitwell and Foible.  I would not tempt my servant to betray me by\ntrusting him too far.  If your mother, in hopes to ruin me, should\nconsent to marry my pretended uncle, he might, like Mosca in the _Fox_,\nstand upon terms; so I made him sure beforehand.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  So, if my poor mother is caught in a contract, you will\ndiscover the imposture betimes, and release her by producing a\ncertificate of her gallant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former marriage.\n\nMIRA.  Yes, upon condition that she consent to my marriage with her\nniece, and surrender the moiety of her fortune in her possession.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  She talked last night of endeavouring at a match between\nMillamant and your uncle.\n\nMIRA.  That was by Foible\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction and my instruction, that she might\nseem to carry it more privately.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Well, I have an opinion of your success, for I believe my\nlady will do anything to get an husband; and when she has this, which you\nhave provided for her, I suppose she will submit to anything to get rid\nof him.\n\nMIRA.  Yes, I think the good lady would marry anything that resembled a\nman, though \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere no more than what a butler could pinch out of a\nnapkin.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Female frailty!  We must all come to it, if we live to be\nold, and feel the craving of a false appetite when the true is decayed.\n\nMIRA.  An old woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appetite is depraved like that of a girl.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the\ngreen-sickness of a second childhood, and, like the faint offer of a\nlatter spring, serves but to usher in the fall, and withers in an\naffected bloom.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your mistress.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n              [_To them_] MRS. MILLAMANT, WITWOUD, MINCING.\n\nMIRA.  Here she comes, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith, full sail, with her fan spread and\nstreamers out, and a shoal of fools for tenders.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ha, no, I cry her mercy.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I see but one poor empty sculler, and he tows her woman after\nhim.\n\nMIRA.  You seem to be unattended, madam.  You used to have the _beau\nmonde_ throng after you, and a flock of gay fine perukes hovering round\nyou.\n\nWIT.  Like moths about a candle.  I had like to have lost my comparison\nfor want of breath.\n\nMILLA.  Oh, I have denied myself airs to-day.  I have walked as fast\nthrough the crowd\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWIT.  As a favourite just disgraced, and with as few followers.\n\nMILLA.  Dear Mr. Witwoud, truce with your similitudes, for I am as sick\nof \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWIT.  As a physician of a good air.  I cannot help it, madam, though \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\nagainst myself.\n\nMILLA.  Yet again!  Mincing, stand between me and his wit.\n\nWIT.  Do, Mrs. Mincing, like a screen before a great fire.  I confess I\ndo blaze to-day; I am too bright.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  But, dear Millamant, why were you so long?\n\nMILLA.  Long!  Lord, have I not made violent haste?  I have asked every\nliving thing I met for you; I have enquired after you, as after a new\nfashion.\n\nWIT.  Madam, truce with your similitudes.\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, you met her husband, and\ndid not ask him for her.\n\nMIRA.  By your leave, Witwoud, that were like enquiring after an old\nfashion to ask a husband for his wife.\n\nWIT.  Hum, a hit, a hit, a palpable hit; I confess it.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  You were dressed before I came abroad.\n\nMILLA.  Ay, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.  Oh, but then I had\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mincing, what had I?  Why\nwas I so long?\n\nMINC.  O mem, your laship stayed to peruse a packet of letters.\n\nMILLA.  Oh, ay, letters\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had letters\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am persecuted with letters\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hate\nletters.  Nobody knows how to write letters; and yet one has \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, one\ndoes not know why.  They serve one to pin up one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair.\n\nWIT.  Is that the way?  Pray, madam, do you pin up your hair with all\nyour letters?  I find I must keep copies.\n\nMILLA.  Only with those in verse, Mr. Witwoud.  I never pin up my hair\nwith prose.  I think I tried once, Mincing.\n\nMINC.  O mem, I shall never forget it.\n\nMILLA.  Ay, poor Mincing tift and tift all the morning.\n\nMINC.  Till I had the cramp in my fingers, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll vow, mem.  And all to no\npurpose.  But when your laship pins it up with poetry, it fits so\npleasant the next day as anything, and is so pure and so crips.\n\nWIT.  Indeed, so crips?\n\nMINC.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re such a critic, Mr. Witwoud.\n\nMILLA.  Mirabell, did you take exceptions last night?  Oh, ay, and went\naway.  Now I think on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m angry\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, now I think on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased:\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I\nbelieve I gave you some pain.\n\nMIRA.  Does that please you?\n\nMILLA.  Infinitely; I love to give pain.\n\nMIRA.  You would affect a cruelty which is not in your nature; your true\nvanity is in the power of pleasing.\n\nMILLA.  Oh, I ask your pardon for that.  One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cruelty is one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power,\nand when one parts with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cruelty one parts with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power, and\nwhen one has parted with that, I fancy one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old and ugly.\n\nMIRA.  Ay, ay; suffer your cruelty to ruin the object of your power, to\ndestroy your lover\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then how vain, how lost a thing you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be!  Nay,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis true; you are no longer handsome when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost your lover: your\nbeauty dies upon the instant.  For beauty is the lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis he\nbestows your charms:\u00e2\u0080\u0094your glass is all a cheat.  The ugly and the old,\nwhom the looking-glass mortifies, yet after commendation can be flattered\nby it, and discover beauties in it: for that reflects our praises rather\nthan your face.\n\nMILLA.  Oh, the vanity of these men!  Fainall, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear him?  If they\ndid not commend us, we were not handsome!  Now you must know they could\nnot commend one if one was not handsome.  Beauty the lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift!  Lord,\nwhat is a lover, that it can give?  Why, one makes lovers as fast as one\npleases, and they live as long as one pleases, and they die as soon as\none pleases; and then, if one pleases, one makes more.\n\nWIT.  Very pretty.  Why, you make no more of making of lovers, madam,\nthan of making so many card-matches.\n\nMILLA.  One no more owes one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty to a lover than one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wit to an\necho.  They can but reflect what we look and say: vain empty things if we\nare silent or unseen, and want a being.\n\nMIRA.  Yet, to those two vain empty things, you owe two the greatest\npleasures of your life.\n\nMILLA.  How so?\n\nMIRA.  To your lover you owe the pleasure of hearing yourselves praised,\nand to an echo the pleasure of hearing yourselves talk.\n\nWIT.  But I know a lady that loves talking so incessantly, she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give\nan echo fair play; she has that everlasting rotation of tongue that an\necho must wait till she dies before it can catch her last words.\n\nMILLA.  Oh, fiction; Fainall, let us leave these men.\n\nMIRA.  Draw off Witwoud.  [_Aside to_ MRS. FAINALL.]\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Immediately; I have a word or two for Mr. Witwoud.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                    MRS. MILLAMANT, MIRABELL, MINCING.\n\nMIRA.  I would beg a little private audience too.  You had the tyranny to\ndeny me last night, though you knew I came to impart a secret to you that\nconcerned my love.\n\nMILLA.  You saw I was engaged.\n\nMIRA.  Unkind!  You had the leisure to entertain a herd of fools: things\nwho visit you from their excessive idleness, bestowing on your easiness\nthat time which is the incumbrance of their lives.  How can you find\ndelight in such society?  It is impossible they should admire you; they\nare not capable; or, if they were, it should be to you as a\nmortification: for, sure, to please a fool is some degree of folly.\n\nMILLA.  I please myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Besides, sometimes to converse with fools is for\nmy health.\n\nMIRA.  Your health!  Is there a worse disease than the conversation of\nfools?\n\nMILLA.  Yes, the vapours; fools are physic for it, next to assafoetida.\n\nMIRA.  You are not in a course of fools?\n\nMILLA.  Mirabell, if you persist in this offensive freedom you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ndisplease me.  I think I must resolve after all not to have you:\u00e2\u0080\u0094we\nshan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree.\n\nMIRA.  Not in our physic, it may be.\n\nMILLA.  And yet our distemper in all likelihood will be the same; for we\nshall be sick of one another.  I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t endure to be reprimanded nor\ninstructed; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis so dull to act always by advice, and so tedious to be\ntold of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faults, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear it.  Well, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you,\nMirabell\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m resolved\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think\u00e2\u0080\u0094you may go\u00e2\u0080\u0094ha, ha, ha!  What would you give\nthat you could help loving me?\n\nMIRA.  I would give something that you did not know I could not help it.\n\nMILLA.  Come, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look grave then.  Well, what do you say to me?\n\nMIRA.  I say that a man may as soon make a friend by his wit, or a\nfortune by his honesty, as win a woman with plain-dealing and sincerity.\n\nMILLA.  Sententious Mirabell!  Prithee don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look with that violent and\ninflexible wise face, like Solomon at the dividing of the child in an old\ntapestry hanging!\n\nMIRA.  You are merry, madam, but I would persuade you for a moment to be\nserious.\n\nMILLA.  What, with that face?  No, if you keep your countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\nimpossible I should hold mine.  Well, after all, there is something very\nmoving in a lovesick face.  Ha, ha, ha!  Well I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t laugh; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\npeevish.  Heigho!  Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be melancholy, as melancholy as a\nwatch-light.  Well, Mirabell, if ever you will win me, woo me now.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nay,\nif you are so tedious, fare you well: I see they are walking away.\n\nMIRA.  Can you not find in the variety of your disposition one moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMILLA.  To hear you tell me Foible\u00e2\u0080\u0099s married, and your plot like to\nspeed?  No.\n\nMIRA.  But how you came to know it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMILLA.  Without the help of the devil, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine; unless she\nshould tell me herself.  Which of the two it may have been, I will leave\nyou to consider; and when you have done thinking of that, think of me.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                            MIRABELL _alone_.\n\nMIRA.  I have something more.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gone!  Think of you?  To think of a\nwhirlwind, though \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere in a whirlwind, were a case of more steady\ncontemplation, a very tranquillity of mind and mansion.  A fellow that\nlives in a windmill has not a more whimsical dwelling than the heart of a\nman that is lodged in a woman.  There is no point of the compass to which\nthey cannot turn, and by which they are not turned, and by one as well as\nanother; for motion, not method, is their occupation.  To know this, and\nyet continue to be in love, is to be made wise from the dictates of\nreason, and yet persevere to play the fool by the force of instinct.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh,\nhere come my pair of turtles.  What, billing so sweetly?  Is not\nValentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day over with you yet?\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                       [_To him_] WAITWELL, FOIBLE.\n\nMIRA.  Sirrah, Waitwell, why, sure, you think you were married for your\nown recreation and not for my conveniency.\n\nWAIT.  Your pardon, sir.  With submission, we have indeed been solacing\nin lawful delights; but still with an eye to business, sir.  I have\ninstructed her as well as I could.  If she can take your directions as\nreadily as my instructions, sir, your affairs are in a prosperous way.\n\nMIRA.  Give you joy, Mrs. Foible.\n\nFOIB.  O\u00e2\u0080\u0094las, sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so ashamed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid my lady has been in a\nthousand inquietudes for me.  But I protest, sir, I made as much haste as\nI could.\n\nWAIT.  That she did indeed, sir.  It was my fault that she did not make\nmore.\n\nMIRA.  That I believe.\n\nFOIB.  But I told my lady as you instructed me, sir, that I had a\nprospect of seeing Sir Rowland, your uncle, and that I would put her\nladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture in my pocket to show him, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sure to say\nhas made him so enamoured of her beauty, that he burns with impatience to\nlie at her ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet and worship the original.\n\nMIRA.  Excellent Foible!  Matrimony has made you eloquent in love.\n\nWAIT.  I think she has profited, sir.  I think so.\n\nFOIB.  You have seen Madam Millamant, sir?\n\nMIRA.  Yes.\n\nFOIB.  I told her, sir, because I did not know that you might find an\nopportunity; she had so much company last night.\n\nMIRA.  Your diligence will merit more.  In the meantime\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_gives money_]\n\nFOIB.  O dear sir, your humble servant.\n\nWAIT.  Spouse\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMIRA.  Stand off, sir, not a penny.  Go on and prosper, Foible.  The\nlease shall be made good and the farm stocked, if we succeed.\n\nFOIB.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t question your generosity, sir, and you need not doubt of\nsuccess.  If you have no more commands, sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure my\nlady is at her toilet, and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dress till I come.  Oh dear, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure\nthat [_looking out_] was Mrs. Marwood that went by in a mask; if she has\nseen me with you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell my lady.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make haste home and\nprevent her.  Your servant, Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u0094B\u00e2\u0080\u0099w\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, Waitwell.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                           MIRABELL, WAITWELL.\n\nWAIT.  Sir Rowland, if you please.  The jade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so pert upon her\npreferment she forgets herself.\n\nMIRA.  Come, sir, will you endeavour to forget yourself\u00e2\u0080\u0094and transform\ninto Sir Rowland?\n\nWAIT.  Why, sir, it will be impossible I should remember myself.\nMarried, knighted, and attended all in one day!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis enough to make any\nman forget himself.  The difficulty will be how to recover my\nacquaintance and familiarity with my former self, and fall from my\ntransformation to a reformation into Waitwell.  Nay, I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be quite\nthe same Waitwell neither\u00e2\u0080\u0094for now I remember me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m married, and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe my own man again.\n\n   Ay, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my grief; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sad change of life:\n   To lose my title, and yet keep my wife.\n\n\n\n\nACT III.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                    _A room in Lady Wishfort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house_.\n\n              LADY WISHFORT _at her toilet_, PEG _waiting_.\n\nLADY.  Merciful!  No news of Foible yet?\n\nPEG.  No, madam.\n\nLADY.  I have no more patience.  If I have not fretted myself till I am\npale again, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no veracity in me.  Fetch me the red\u00e2\u0080\u0094the red, do you\nhear, sweetheart?  An errant ash colour, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person.  Look you how\nthis wench stirs!  Why dost thou not fetch me a little red?  Didst thou\nnot hear me, Mopus?\n\nPEG.  The red ratafia, does your ladyship mean, or the cherry brandy?\n\nLADY.  Ratafia, fool?  No, fool.  Not the ratafia, fool\u00e2\u0080\u0094grant me\npatience!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean the Spanish paper, idiot; complexion, darling.  Paint,\npaint, paint, dost thou understand that, changeling, dangling thy hands\nlike bobbins before thee?  Why dost thou not stir, puppet?  Thou wooden\nthing upon wires!\n\nPEG.  Lord, madam, your ladyship is so impatient.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I cannot come at the\npaint, madam: Mrs. Foible has locked it up, and carried the key with her.\n\nLADY.  A pox take you both.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fetch me the cherry brandy then.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                              LADY WISHFORT.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m as pale and as faint, I look like Mrs. Qualmsick, the curate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always breeding.  Wench, come, come, wench, what art thou doing?\nSipping?  Tasting?  Save thee, dost thou not know the bottle?\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n            LADY WISHFORT, PEG _with a bottle and china cup_.\n\nPEG.  Madam, I was looking for a cup.\n\nLADY.  A cup, save thee, and what a cup hast thou brought!  Dost thou\ntake me for a fairy, to drink out of an acorn?  Why didst thou not bring\nthy thimble?  Hast thou ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er a brass thimble clinking in thy pocket with\na bit of nutmeg?  I warrant thee.  Come, fill, fill.  So, again.  See who\nthat is.  [_One knocks_.]  Set down the bottle first.  Here, here, under\nthe table:\u00e2\u0080\u0094what, wouldst thou go with the bottle in thy hand like a\ntapster?  As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person, this wench has lived in an inn upon the road,\nbefore she came to me, like Maritornes the Asturian in Don Quixote.  No\nFoible yet?\n\nPEG.  No, madam; Mrs. Marwood.\n\nLADY.  Oh, Marwood: let her come in.  Come in, good Marwood.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                        [_To them_] MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised to find your ladyship in _d\u00c3\u00a9shabill\u00c3\u00a9_ at this\ntime of day.\n\nLADY.  Foible\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lost thing; has been abroad since morning, and never\nheard of since.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I saw her but now, as I came masked through the park, in\nconference with Mirabell.\n\nLADY.  With Mirabell?  You call my blood into my face with mentioning\nthat traitor.  She durst not have the confidence.  I sent her to\nnegotiate an affair, in which if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m detected I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m undone.  If that\nwheedling villain has wrought upon Foible to detect me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ruined.  O my\ndear friend, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a wretch of wretches if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m detected.\n\nMRS. MAR.  O madam, you cannot suspect Mrs. Foible\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrity.\n\nLADY.  Oh, he carries poison in his tongue that would corrupt integrity\nitself.  If she has given him an opportunity, she has as good as put her\nintegrity into his hands.  Ah, dear Marwood, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrity to an\nopportunity?  Hark!  I hear her.  Dear friend, retire into my closet,\nthat I may examine her with more freedom\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pardon me, dear friend, I\ncan make bold with you\u00e2\u0080\u0094there are books over the chimney\u00e2\u0080\u0094Quarles and Pryn,\nand the _Short View of the Stage_, with Bunyan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works to entertain\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Go, you thing, and send her in.  [_To_ PEG.]\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n                          LADY WISHFORT, FOIBLE.\n\nLADY.  O Foible, where hast thou been?  What hast thou been doing?\n\nFOIB.  Madam, I have seen the party.\n\nLADY.  But what hast thou done?\n\nFOIB.  Nay, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis your ladyship has done, and are to do; I have only\npromised.  But a man so enamoured\u00e2\u0080\u0094so transported!  Well, if worshipping\nof pictures be a sin\u00e2\u0080\u0094poor Sir Rowland, I say.\n\nLADY.  The miniature has been counted like.  But hast thou not betrayed\nme, Foible?  Hast thou not detected me to that faithless Mirabell?  What\nhast thou to do with him in the park?  Answer me, has he got nothing out\nof thee?\n\nFOIB.  So, the devil has been beforehand with me; what shall I say?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Alas,\nmadam, could I help it, if I met that confident thing?  Was I in fault?\nIf you had heard how he used me, and all upon your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you would not suspect my fidelity.  Nay, if that had been the\nworst I could have borne: but he had a fling at your ladyship too, and\nthen I could not hold; but, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith I gave him his own.\n\nLADY.  Me?  What did the filthy fellow say?\n\nFOIB.  O madam, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a shame to say what he said, with his taunts and his\nfleers, tossing up his nose.  Humh, says he, what, you are a-hatching\nsome plot, says he, you are so early abroad, or catering, says he,\nferreting for some disbanded officer, I warrant.  Half pay is but thin\nsubsistence, says he.  Well, what pension does your lady propose?  Let me\nsee, says he, what, she must come down pretty deep now, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsuperannuated, says he, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  Ods my life, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have him\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have him murdered.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have him\npoisoned.  Where does he eat?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry a drawer to have him poisoned\nin his wine.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send for Robin from Locket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094immediately.\n\nFOIB.  Poison him?  Poisoning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too good for him.  Starve him, madam,\nstarve him; marry Sir Rowland, and get him disinherited.  Oh, you would\nbless yourself to hear what he said.\n\nLADY.  A villain; superannuated?\n\nFOIB.  Humh, says he, I hear you are laying designs against me too, says\nhe, and Mrs. Millamant is to marry my uncle (he does not suspect a word\nof your ladyship); but, says he, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fit you for that, I warrant you,\nsays he, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hamper you for that, says he, you and your old frippery\ntoo, says he, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll handle you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  Audacious villain!  Handle me?  Would he durst?  Frippery?  Old\nfrippery?  Was there ever such a foul-mouthed fellow?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be married\nto-morrow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be contracted to-night.\n\nFOIB.  The sooner the better, madam.\n\nLADY.  Will Sir Rowland be here, say\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou?  When, Foible?\n\nFOIB.  Incontinently, madam.  No new sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife expects the return of\nher husband after knighthood with that impatience in which Sir Rowland\nburns for the dear hour of kissing your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand after dinner.\n\nLADY.  Frippery?  Superannuated frippery?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll frippery the villain;\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reduce him to frippery and rags, a tatterdemalion!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope to see him\nhung with tatters, like a Long Lane pent-house, or a gibbet thief.  A\nslander-mouthed railer!  I warrant the spendthrift prodigal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in debt as\nmuch as the million lottery, or the whole court upon a birthday.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nspoil his credit with his tailor.  Yes, he shall have my niece with her\nfortune, he shall.\n\nFOIB.  He?  I hope to see him lodge in Ludgate first, and angle into\nBlackfriars for brass farthings with an old mitten.\n\nLADY.  Ay, dear Foible; thank thee for that, dear Foible.  He has put me\nout of all patience.  I shall never recompose my features to receive Sir\nRowland with any economy of face.  This wretch has fretted me that I am\nabsolutely decayed.  Look, Foible.\n\nFOIB.  Your ladyship has frowned a little too rashly, indeed, madam.\nThere are some cracks discernible in the white vernish.\n\nLADY.  Let me see the glass.  Cracks, say\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou?  Why, I am arrantly\nflayed: I look like an old peeled wall.  Thou must repair me, Foible,\nbefore Sir Rowland comes, or I shall never keep up to my picture.\n\nFOIB.  I warrant you, madam: a little art once made your picture like\nyou, and now a little of the same art must make you like your picture.\nYour picture must sit for you, madam.\n\nLADY.  But art thou sure Sir Rowland will not fail to come?  Or will a\nnot fail when he does come?  Will he be importunate, Foible, and push?\nFor if he should not be importunate I shall never break decorums.  I\nshall die with confusion if I am forced to advance\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh no, I can never\nadvance; I shall swoon if he should expect advances.  No, I hope Sir\nRowland is better bred than to put a lady to the necessity of breaking\nher forms.  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be too coy neither\u00e2\u0080\u0094I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give him despair.  But a\nlittle disdain is not amiss; a little scorn is alluring.\n\nFOIB.  A little scorn becomes your ladyship.\n\nLADY.  Yes, but tenderness becomes me best\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sort of a dyingness.  You\nsee that picture has a sort of a\u00e2\u0080\u0094ha, Foible?  A swimmingness in the eyes.\nYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look so.  My niece affects it; but she wants features.  Is Sir\nRowland handsome?  Let my toilet be removed\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dress above.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nreceive Sir Rowland here.  Is he handsome?  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer me.  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be surprised.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be taken by surprise.\n\nFOIB.  By storm, madam.  Sir Rowland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brisk man.\n\nLADY.  Is he?  Oh, then, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll importune, if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brisk man.  I shall\nsave decorums if Sir Rowland importunes.  I have a mortal terror at the\napprehension of offending against decorums.  Oh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brisk\nman.  Let my things be removed, good Foible.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                          MRS. FAINALL, FOIBLE.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  O Foible, I have been in a fright, lest I should come too\nlate.  That devil, Marwood, saw you in the park with Mirabell, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nafraid will discover it to my lady.\n\nFOIB.  Discover what, madam?\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Nay, nay, put not on that strange face.  I am privy to the\nwhole design, and know that Waitwell, to whom thou wert this morning\nmarried, is to personate Mirabell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncle, and, as such winning my lady,\nto involve her in those difficulties from which Mirabell only must\nrelease her, by his making his conditions to have my cousin and her\nfortune left to her own disposal.\n\nFOIB.  O dear madam, I beg your pardon.  It was not my confidence in your\nladyship that was deficient; but I thought the former good correspondence\nbetween your ladyship and Mr. Mirabell might have hindered his\ncommunicating this secret.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Dear Foible, forget that.\n\nFOIB.  O dear madam, Mr. Mirabell is such a sweet winning gentleman.  But\nyour ladyship is the pattern of generosity.  Sweet lady, to be so good!\nMr. Mirabell cannot choose but be grateful.  I find your ladyship has his\nheart still.  Now, madam, I can safely tell your ladyship our success:\nMrs. Marwood had told my lady, but I warrant I managed myself.  I turned\nit all for the better.  I told my lady that Mr. Mirabell railed at her.\nI laid horrid things to his charge, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll vow; and my lady is so incensed\nthat she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be contracted to Sir Rowland to-night, she says; I warrant I\nworked her up that he may have her for asking for, as they say of a Welsh\nmaidenhead.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  O rare Foible!\n\nFOIB.  Madam, I beg your ladyship to acquaint Mr. Mirabell of his\nsuccess.  I would be seen as little as possible to speak to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094besides,\nI believe Madam Marwood watches me.  She has a month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind; but I know\nMr. Mirabell can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abide her.  [_Calls_.]  John, remove my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toilet.\nMadam, your servant.  My lady is so impatient, I fear she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come for me,\nif I stay.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go with you up the back stairs, lest I should meet her.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                          MRS. MARWOOD _alone_.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Indeed, Mrs. Engine, is it thus with you?  Are you become a\ngo-between of this importance?  Yes, I shall watch you.  Why this wench\nis the _passe-partout_, a very master-key to everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong box.  My\nfriend Fainall, have you carried it so swimmingly?  I thought there was\nsomething in it; but it seems it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over with you.  Your loathing is not\nfrom a want of appetite then, but from a surfeit.  Else you could never\nbe so cool to fall from a principal to be an assistant, to procure for\nhim!  A pattern of generosity, that I confess.  Well, Mr. Fainall, you\nhave met with your match.\u00e2\u0080\u0094O man, man!  Woman, woman!  The devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ass:\nif I were a painter, I would draw him like an idiot, a driveller with a\nbib and bells.  Man should have his head and horns, and woman the rest of\nhim.  Poor, simple fiend!  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Madam Marwood has a month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, but he\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abide her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twere better for him you had not been his confessor\nin that affair, without you could have kept his counsel closer.  I shall\nnot prove another pattern of generosity; he has not obliged me to that\nwith those excesses of himself, and now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have none of him.  Here\ncomes the good lady, panting ripe, with a heart full of hope, and a head\nfull of care, like any chymist upon the day of projection.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                        [_To her_] LADY WISHFORT.\n\nLADY.  O dear Marwood, what shall I say for this rude forgetfulness?  But\nmy dear friend is all goodness.\n\nMRS. MAR.  No apologies, dear madam.  I have been very well entertained.\n\nLADY.  As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person, I am in a very chaos to think I should so forget\nmyself.  But I have such an olio of affairs, really I know not what to\ndo.  [_Calls_.]  Foible!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I expect my nephew Sir Wilfull ev\u00e2\u0080\u0099ry moment\ntoo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, Foible!\u00e2\u0080\u0094He means to travel for improvement.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Methinks Sir Wilfull should rather think of marrying than\ntravelling at his years.  I hear he is turned of forty.\n\nLADY.  Oh, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in less danger of being spoiled by his travels.  I am\nagainst my nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marrying too young.  It will be time enough when he\ncomes back, and has acquired discretion to choose for himself.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Methinks Mrs. Millamant and he would make a very fit match.\nHe may travel afterwards.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a thing very usual with young gentlemen.\n\nLADY.  I promise you I have thought on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094and since \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis your judgment,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll think on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t again.  I assure you I will; I value your judgment\nextremely.  On my word, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll propose it.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] FOIBLE.\n\nLADY.  Come, come, Foible\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had forgot my nephew will be here before\ndinner\u00e2\u0080\u0094I must make haste.\n\nFOIB.  Mr. Witwoud and Mr. Petulant are come to dine with your ladyship.\n\nLADY.  Oh dear, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear till I am dressed.  Dear Marwood, shall I\nbe free with you again, and beg you to entertain \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make all\nimaginable haste.  Dear friend, excuse me.\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n                  MRS. MARWOOD, MRS. MILLAMANT, MINCING.\n\nMILLA.  Sure, never anything was so unbred as that odious man.  Marwood,\nyour servant.\n\nMRS. MAR.  You have a colour; what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nMILLA.  That horrid fellow Petulant has provoked me into a flame\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have\nbroke my fan\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mincing, lend me yours.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Is not all the powder out of my\nhair?\n\nMRS. MAR.  No.  What has he done?\n\nMILLA.  Nay, he has done nothing; he has only talked.  Nay, he has said\nnothing neither; but he has contradicted everything that has been said.\nFor my part, I thought Witwoud and he would have quarrelled.\n\nMINC.  I vow, mem, I thought once they would have fit.\n\nMILLA.  Well, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a lamentable thing, I swear, that one has not the\nliberty of choosing one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquaintance as one does one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothes.\n\nMRS. MAR.  If we had that liberty, we should be as weary of one set of\nacquaintance, though never so good, as we are of one suit, though never\nso fine.  A fool and a doily stuff would now and then find days of grace,\nand be worn for variety.\n\nMILLA.  I could consent to wear \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, if they would wear alike; but fools\nnever wear out.  They are such _drap de Berri_ things!  Without one could\ngive \u00e2\u0080\u0099em to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chambermaid after a day or two.\n\nMRS. MAR.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twere better so indeed.  Or what think you of the playhouse?\nA fine gay glossy fool should be given there, like a new masking habit,\nafter the masquerade is over, and we have done with the disguise.  For a\nfool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit is always a disguise, and never admitted by a woman of wit,\nbut to blind her affair with a lover of sense.  If you would but appear\nbarefaced now, and own Mirabell, you might as easily put off Petulant and\nWitwoud as your hood and scarf.  And indeed \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis time, for the town has\nfound it, the secret is grown too big for the pretence.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis like Mrs.\nPrimly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great belly: she may lace it down before, but it burnishes on\nher hips.  Indeed, Millamant, you can no more conceal it than my Lady\nStrammel can her face, that goodly face, which in defiance of her\nRhenish-wine tea will not be comprehended in a mask.\n\nMILLA.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my death, Marwood, you are more censorious than a\ndecayed beauty, or a discarded toast:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mincing, tell the men they may come\nup.  My aunt is not dressing here; their folly is less provoking than\nyour malice.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n                      MRS. MILLAMANT, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nMILLA.  The town has found it?  What has it found?  That Mirabell loves\nme is no more a secret than it is a secret that you discovered it to my\naunt, or than the reason why you discovered it is a secret.\n\nMRS. MAR.  You are nettled.\n\nMILLA.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mistaken.  Ridiculous!\n\nMRS. MAR.  Indeed, my dear, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tear another fan, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmitigate those violent airs.\n\nMILLA.  O silly!  Ha, ha, ha!  I could laugh immoderately.  Poor\nMirabell!  His constancy to me has quite destroyed his complaisance for\nall the world beside.  I swear I never enjoined it him to be so coy.  If\nI had the vanity to think he would obey me, I would command him to show\nmore gallantry: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis hardly well-bred to be so particular on one hand and\nso insensible on the other.  But I despair to prevail, and so let him\nfollow his own way.  Ha, ha, ha!  Pardon me, dear creature, I must laugh;\nha, ha, ha!  Though I grant you \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a little barbarous; ha, ha, ha!\n\nMRS. MAR.  What pity \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis so much fine raillery, and delivered with so\nsignificant gesture, should be so unhappily directed to miscarry.\n\nMILLA.  Heh?  Dear creature, I ask your pardon.  I swear I did not mind\nyou.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Mr. Mirabell and you both may think it a thing impossible,\nwhen I shall tell him by telling you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMILLA.  Oh dear, what?  For it is the same thing, if I hear it.  Ha, ha,\nha!\n\nMRS. MAR.  That I detest him, hate him, madam.\n\nMILLA.  O madam, why, so do I.  And yet the creature loves me, ha, ha,\nha!  How can one forbear laughing to think of it?  I am a sibyl if I am\nnot amazed to think what he can see in me.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my death, I think\nyou are handsomer, and within a year or two as young.  If you could but\nstay for me, I should overtake you\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that cannot be.  Well, that\nthought makes me melancholic.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sad.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Your merry note may be changed sooner than you think.\n\nMILLA.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye say so?  Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m resolved I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a song to keep up my\nspirits.\n\n\n\nSCENE XII.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] MINCING.\n\nMINC.  The gentlemen stay but to comb, madam, and will wait on you.\n\nMILLA.  Desire Mrs. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is in the next room, to sing the song I would\nhave learnt yesterday.  You shall hear it, madam.  Not that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any\ngreat matter in it\u00e2\u0080\u0094but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis agreeable to my humour.\n\n                                  SONG.\n                         Set by Mr. JOHN ECCLES.\n\n                                    I\n\n   Love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but the frailty of the mind\n   When \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not with ambition joined;\n   A sickly flame, which if not fed expires,\n   And feeding, wastes in self-consuming fires.\n\n                                    II\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis not to wound a wanton boy\n   Or am\u00e2\u0080\u0099rous youth, that gives the joy;\n   But \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the glory to have pierced a swain\n   For whom inferior beauties sighed in vain.\n\n                                   III\n\n   Then I alone the conquest prize,\n   When I insult a rival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes;\n   If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delight in love, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis when I see\n   That heart, which others bleed for, bleed for me.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII.\n\n\n                      [_To them_] PETULANT, WITWOUD.\n\nMILLA.  Is your animosity composed, gentlemen?\n\nWIT.  Raillery, raillery, madam; we have no animosity.  We hit off a\nlittle wit now and then, but no animosity.  The falling out of wits is\nlike the falling out of lovers:\u00e2\u0080\u0094we agree in the main, like treble and\nbass.  Ha, Petulant?\n\nPET.  Ay, in the main.  But when I have a humour to contradict\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWIT.  Ay, when he has a humour to contradict, then I contradict too.\nWhat, I know my cue.  Then we contradict one another like two\nbattledores; for contradictions beget one another like Jews.\n\nPET.  If he says black\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I have a humour to say \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis blue\u00e2\u0080\u0094let\nthat pass\u00e2\u0080\u0094all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one for that.  If I have a humour to prove it, it must be\ngranted.\n\nWIT.  Not positively must.  But it may; it may.\n\nPET.  Yes, it positively must, upon proof positive.\n\nWIT.  Ay, upon proof positive it must; but upon proof presumptive it only\nmay.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a logical distinction now, madam.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I perceive your debates are of importance, and very learnedly\nhandled.\n\nPET.  Importance is one thing and learning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another; but a debate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\ndebate, that I assert.\n\nWIT.  Petulant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an enemy to learning; he relies altogether on his parts.\n\nPET.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no enemy to learning; it hurts not me.\n\nMRS. MAR.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sign, indeed, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no enemy to you.\n\nPET.  No, no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no enemy to anybody but them that have it.\n\nMILLA.  Well, an illiterate man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my aversion; I wonder at the impudence\nof any illiterate man to offer to make love.\n\nWIT.  That I confess I wonder at, too.\n\nMILLA.  Ah, to marry an ignorant that can hardly read or write!\n\nPET.  Why should a man be any further from being married, though he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nread, than he is from being hanged?  The ordinary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paid for setting the\npsalm, and the parish priest for reading the ceremony.  And for the rest\nwhich is to follow in both cases, a man may do it without book.  So all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\none for that.\n\nMILLA.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear the creature?  Lord, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begone.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV.\n\n\nSIR WILFULL WITWOUD _in a riding dress_, MRS. MARWOOD, PETULANT, WITWOUD,\n                                 FOOTMAN.\n\nWIT.  In the name of Bartlemew and his Fair, what have we here?\n\nMRS. MAR.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis your brother, I fancy.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know him?\n\nWIT.  Not I:\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes, I think it is he.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve almost forgot him; I have not\nseen him since the revolution.\n\nFOOT.  Sir, my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dressing.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, if you please to walk\nin, in the meantime.\n\nSIR WIL.  Dressing!  What, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but morning here, I warrant, with you in\nLondon; we should count it towards afternoon in our parts down in\nShropshire:\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, then, belike my aunt han\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dined yet.  Ha, friend?\n\nFOOT.  Your aunt, sir?\n\nSIR WIL.  My aunt, sir?  Yes my aunt, sir, and your lady, sir; your lady\nis my aunt, sir.  Why, what dost thou not know me, friend?  Why, then,\nsend somebody hither that does.  How long hast thou lived with thy lady,\nfellow, ha?\n\nFOOT.  A week, sir; longer than anybody in the house, except my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwoman.\n\nSIR WIL.  Why, then, belike thou dost not know thy lady, if thou seest\nher.  Ha, friend?\n\nFOOT.  Why, truly, sir, I cannot safely swear to her face in a morning,\nbefore she is dressed.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis like I may give a shrewd guess at her by\nthis time.\n\nSIR WIL.  Well, prithee try what thou canst do; if thou canst not guess,\nenquire her out, dost hear, fellow?  And tell her her nephew, Sir Wilfull\nWitwoud, is in the house.\n\nFOOT.  I shall, sir.\n\nSIR WIL.  Hold ye, hear me, friend, a word with you in your ear: prithee\nwho are these gallants?\n\nFOOT.  Really, sir, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell; here come so many here, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis hard to\nknow \u00e2\u0080\u0099em all.\n\n\n\nSCENE XV.\n\n\n          SIR WILFULL WITWOUD, PETULANT, WITWOUD, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nSIR WIL.  Oons, this fellow knows less than a starling: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think a\nknows his own name.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Mr. Witwoud, your brother is not behindhand in forgetfulness.\nI fancy he has forgot you too.\n\nWIT.  I hope so.  The devil take him that remembers first, I say.\n\nSIR WIL.  Save you, gentlemen and lady.\n\nMRS. MAR.  For shame, Mr. Witwoud; why won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak to him?\u00e2\u0080\u0094And you,\nsir.\n\nWIT.  Petulant, speak.\n\nPET.  And you, sir.\n\nSIR WIL.  No offence, I hope?  [_Salutes_ MARWOOD.]\n\nMRS. MAR.  No, sure, sir.\n\nWIT.  This is a vile dog, I see that already.  No offence?  Ha, ha, ha.\nTo him, to him, Petulant, smoke him.\n\nPET.  It seems as if you had come a journey, sir; hem, hem.  [_Surveying\nhim round_.]\n\nSIR WIL.  Very likely, sir, that it may seem so.\n\nPET.  No offence, I hope, sir?\n\nWIT.  Smoke the boots, the boots, Petulant, the boots; ha, ha, ha!\n\nSIR WILL.  Maybe not, sir; thereafter as \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis meant, sir.\n\nPET.  Sir, I presume upon the information of your boots.\n\nSIR WIL.  Why, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like you may, sir: if you are not satisfied with the\ninformation of my boots, sir, if you will step to the stable, you may\nenquire further of my horse, sir.\n\nPET.  Your horse, sir!  Your horse is an ass, sir!\n\nSIR WIL.  Do you speak by way of offence, sir?\n\nMRS. MAR.  The gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merry, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all, sir.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Slife, we shall have\na quarrel betwixt an horse and an ass, before they find one another\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You must not take anything amiss from your friends, sir.  You are\namong your friends here, though it\u00e2\u0080\u0094may be you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it.  If I am not\nmistaken, you are Sir Wilfull Witwoud?\n\nSIR WIL.  Right, lady; I am Sir Wilfull Witwoud, so I write myself; no\noffence to anybody, I hope? and nephew to the Lady Wishfort of this\nmansion.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know this gentleman, sir?\n\nSIR WIL.  Hum!  What, sure \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not\u00e2\u0080\u0094yea by\u00e2\u0080\u0099r lady but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099sheart, I\nknow not whether \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis or no.  Yea, but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis, by the Wrekin.  Brother\nAntony!  What, Tony, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith!  What, dost thou not know me?  By\u00e2\u0080\u0099r lady,\nnor I thee, thou art so becravated and so beperiwigged.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, why\ndost not speak?  Art thou o\u00e2\u0080\u0099erjoyed?\n\nWIT.  Odso, brother, is it you?  Your servant, brother.\n\nSIR WIL.  Your servant?  Why, yours, sir.  Your servant again\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099sheart,\nand your friend and servant to that\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_puff_] and a flap-dragon for\nyour service, sir, and a hare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot and a hare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scut for your service,\nsir, an you be so cold and so courtly!\n\nWIT.  No offence, I hope, brother?\n\nSIR WIL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, sir, but there is, and much offence.  A pox, is this\nyour inns o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations,\nyour elders, and your betters?\n\nWIT.  Why, brother Wilfull of Salop, you may be as short as a Shrewsbury\ncake, if you please.  But I tell you \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not modish to know relations in\ntown.  You think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the country, where great lubberly brothers\nslabber and kiss one another when they meet, like a call of sergeants.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis not the fashion here; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not, indeed, dear brother.\n\nSIR WIL.  The fashion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fool and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fop, dear brother.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve suspected this\u00e2\u0080\u0094by\u00e2\u0080\u0099r lady I conjectured you were a fop, since you\nbegan to change the style of your letters, and write in a scrap of paper\ngilt round the edges, no bigger than a subpoena.  I might expect this\nwhen you left off \u00e2\u0080\u0098Honoured brother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hoping you are in good\nhealth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and so forth, to begin with a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rat me, knight, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sick of a\nlast night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debauch.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Ods heart, and then tell a familiar tale of a\ncock and a bull, and a whore and a bottle, and so conclude.  You could\nwrite news before you were out of your time, when you lived with honest\nPumple-Nose, the attorney of Furnival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inn.  You could intreat to be\nremembered then to your friends round the Wrekin.  We could have Gazettes\nthen, and Dawks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Letter, and the Weekly Bill, till of late days.\n\nPET.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Slife, Witwoud, were you ever an attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clerk?  Of the family\nof the Furnivals?  Ha, ha, ha!\n\nWIT.  Ay, ay, but that was but for a while.  Not long, not long; pshaw, I\nwas not in my own power then.  An orphan, and this fellow was my\nguardian; ay, ay, I was glad to consent to that man to come to London.\nHe had the disposal of me then.  If I had not agreed to that, I might\nhave been bound prentice to a feltmaker in Shrewsbury: this fellow would\nhave bound me to a maker of felts.\n\nSIR WIL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, and better than to be bound to a maker of fops, where,\nI suppose, you have served your time, and now you may set up for\nyourself.\n\nMRS. MAR.  You intend to travel, sir, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m informed?\n\nSIR WIL.  Belike I may, madam.  I may chance to sail upon the salt seas,\nif my mind hold.\n\nPET.  And the wind serve.\n\nSIR WIL.  Serve or not serve, I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask license of you, sir, nor the\nweathercock your companion.  I direct my discourse to the lady, sir.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis like my aunt may have told you, madam?  Yes, I have settled my\nconcerns, I may say now, and am minded to see foreign parts.  If an how\nthat the peace holds, whereby, that is, taxes abate.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I thought you had designed for France at all adventures.\n\nSIR WIL.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell that; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like I may, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like I may not.  I\nam somewhat dainty in making a resolution, because when I make it I keep\nit.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand shill I, shall I, then; if I say\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  But I\nhave thoughts to tarry a small matter in town, to learn somewhat of your\nlingo first, before I cross the seas.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gladly have a spice of your\nFrench as they say, whereby to hold discourse in foreign countries.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an academy in town for that use.\n\nSIR WIL.  There is?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis like there may.\n\nMRS. MAR.  No doubt you will return very much improved.\n\nWIT.  Yes, refined like a Dutch skipper from a whale-fishing.\n\n\n\nSCENE XVI.\n\n\n                 [_To them_] LADY WISHFORT _and_ FAINALL.\n\nLADY.  Nephew, you are welcome.\n\nSIR WIL.  Aunt, your servant.\n\nFAIN.  Sir Wilfull, your most faithful servant.\n\nSIR WIL.  Cousin Fainall, give me your hand.\n\nLADY.  Cousin Witwoud, your servant; Mr. Petulant, your servant.  Nephew,\nyou are welcome again.  Will you drink anything after your journey,\nnephew, before you eat?  Dinner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost ready.\n\nSIR WIL.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very well, I thank you, aunt.  However, I thank you for\nyour courteous offer.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, I was afraid you would have been in the\nfashion too, and have remembered to have forgot your relations.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyour cousin Tony, belike, I mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call him brother for fear of offence.\n\nLADY.  Oh, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rallier, nephew.  My cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wit: and your great\nwits always rally their best friends to choose.  When you have been\nabroad, nephew, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand raillery better.  [FAINALL _and_ MRS.\nMARWOOD _talk apart_.]\n\nSIR WIL.  Why, then, let him hold his tongue in the meantime, and rail\nwhen that day comes.\n\n\n\nSCENE XVII.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] MINCING.\n\nMINC.  Mem, I come to acquaint your laship that dinner is impatient.\n\nSIR WIL.  Impatient?  Why, then, belike it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay till I pull off my\nboots.  Sweetheart, can you help me to a pair of slippers?  My man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with\nhis horses, I warrant.\n\nLADY.  Fie, fie, nephew, you would not pull off your boots here?  Go down\ninto the hall:\u00e2\u0080\u0094dinner shall stay for you.  My nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little unbred:\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pardon him, madam.  Gentlemen, will you walk?  Marwood?\n\nMRS. MAR.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll follow you, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u0094before Sir Wilfull is ready.\n\n\n\nSCENE XVIII.\n\n\n                          MRS. MARWOOD, FAINALL.\n\nFAIN.  Why, then, Foible\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bawd, an errant, rank match-making bawd.\nAnd I, it seems, am a husband, a rank husband, and my wife a very errant,\nrank wife,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all in the way of the world.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, to be a cuckold by\nanticipation, a cuckold in embryo!  Sure I was born with budding antlers\nlike a young satyr, or a citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child, \u00e2\u0080\u0099sdeath, to be out-witted, to\nbe out-jilted, out-matrimonied.  If I had kept my speed like a stag,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twere somewhat, but to crawl after, with my horns like a snail, and be\noutstripped by my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis scurvy wedlock.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Then shake it off: you have often wished for an opportunity to\npart, and now you have it.  But first prevent their plot:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the half of\nMillamant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune is too considerable to be parted with to a foe, to\nMirabell.\n\nFAIN.  Damn him, that had been mine\u00e2\u0080\u0094had you not made that fond discovery.\nThat had been forfeited, had they been married.  My wife had added lustre\nto my horns by that increase of fortune: I could have worn \u00e2\u0080\u0099em tipt with\ngold, though my forehead had been furnished like a deputy-lieutenant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhall.\n\nMRS. MAR.  They may prove a cap of maintenance to you still, if you can\naway with your wife.  And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no worse than when you had her:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I dare\nswear she had given up her game before she was married.\n\nFAIN.  Hum!  That may be\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. MAR.  You married her to keep you; and if you can contrive to have\nher keep you better than you expected, why should you not keep her longer\nthan you intended?\n\nFAIN.  The means, the means?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Discover to my lady your wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct; threaten to part with\nher.  My lady loves her, and will come to any composition to save her\nreputation.  Take the opportunity of breaking it just upon the discovery\nof this imposture.  My lady will be enraged beyond bounds, and sacrifice\nniece, and fortune and all at that conjuncture.  And let me alone to keep\nher warm: if she should flag in her part, I will not fail to prompt her.\n\nFAIN.  Faith, this has an appearance.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry I hinted to my lady to endeavour a match between\nMillamant and Sir Wilfull; that may be an obstacle.\n\nFAIN.  Oh, for that matter, leave me to manage him; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll disable him for\nthat, he will drink like a Dane.  After dinner I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set his hand in.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Well, how do you stand affected towards your lady?\n\nFAIN.  Why, faith, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking of it.  Let me see.  I am married\nalready; so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over.  My wife has played the jade with me; well,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over too.  I never loved her, or if I had, why that would have\nbeen over too by this time.  Jealous of her I cannot be, for I am\ncertain; so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an end of jealousy.  Weary of her I am and shall be.\nNo, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no end of that; no, no, that were too much to hope.  Thus far\nconcerning my repose.  Now for my reputation: as to my own, I married not\nfor it; so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of the question.  And as to my part in my\nwife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, she had parted with hers before; so, bringing none to me, she\ncan take none from me: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis against all rule of play that I should lose\nto one who has not wherewithal to stake.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Besides you forget, marriage is honourable.\n\nFAIN.  Hum!  Faith, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well thought on: marriage is honourable,\nas you say; and if so, wherefore should cuckoldom be a discredit, being\nderived from so honourable a root?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Nay, I know not; if the root be honourable, why not the\nbranches?\n\nFAIN.  So, so; why this point\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear.  Well, how do we proceed?\n\nMRS. MAR.  I will contrive a letter which shall be delivered to my lady\nat the time when that rascal who is to act Sir Rowland is with her.  It\nshall come as from an unknown hand\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the less I appear to know of the\ntruth the better I can play the incendiary.  Besides, I would not have\nFoible provoked if I could help it, because, you know, she knows some\npassages.  Nay, I expect all will come out.  But let the mine be sprung\nfirst, and then I care not if I am discovered.\n\nFAIN.  If the worst come to the worst, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn my wife to grass.  I\nhave already a deed of settlement of the best part of her estate, which I\nwheedled out of her, and that you shall partake at least.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I hope you are convinced that I hate Mirabell now?  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nno more jealous?\n\nFAIN.  Jealous?  No, by this kiss.  Let husbands be jealous, but let the\nlover still believe: or if he doubt, let it be only to endear his\npleasure, and prepare the joy that follows, when he proves his mistress\ntrue.  But let husbands\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doubts convert to endless jealousy; or if they\nhave belief, let it corrupt to superstition and blind credulity.  I am\nsingle and will herd no more with \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  True, I wear the badge, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ndisown the order.  And since I take my leave of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, I care not if I\nleave \u00e2\u0080\u0099em a common motto to their common crest.\n\n   All husbands must or pain or shame endure;\n   The wise too jealous are, fools too secure.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                            _Scene Continues_.\n\n                       LADY WISHFORT _and_ FOIBLE.\n\nLADY.  Is Sir Rowland coming, say\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou, Foible?  And are things in\norder?\n\nFOIB.  Yes, madam.  I have put wax-lights in the sconces, and placed the\nfootmen in a row in the hall, in their best liveries, with the coachman\nand postillion to fill up the equipage.\n\nLADY.  Have you pulvilled the coachman and postillion, that they may not\nstink of the stable when Sir Rowland comes by?\n\nFOIB.  Yes, madam.\n\nLADY.  And are the dancers and the music ready, that he may be\nentertained in all points with correspondence to his passion?\n\nFOIB.  All is ready, madam.\n\nLADY.  And\u00e2\u0080\u0094well\u00e2\u0080\u0094and how do I look, Foible?\n\nFOIB.  Most killing well, madam.\n\nLADY.  Well, and how shall I receive him?  In what figure shall I give\nhis heart the first impression?  There is a great deal in the first\nimpression.  Shall I sit?  No, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll walk,\u00e2\u0080\u0094ay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll walk from\nthe door upon his entrance, and then turn full upon him.  No, that will\nbe too sudden.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lie,\u00e2\u0080\u0094ay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lie down.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll receive him in my\nlittle dressing-room; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a couch\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes, yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give the first\nimpression on a couch.  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie neither, but loll and lean upon one\nelbow, with one foot a little dangling off, jogging in a thoughtful way.\nYes; and then as soon as he appears, start, ay, start and be surprised,\nand rise to meet him in a pretty disorder.  Yes; oh, nothing is more\nalluring than a levee from a couch in some confusion.  It shows the foot\nto advantage, and furnishes with blushes and re-composing airs beyond\ncomparison.  Hark!  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a coach.\n\nFOIB.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis he, madam.\n\nLADY.  Oh dear, has my nephew made his addresses to Millamant?  I ordered\nhim.\n\nFOIB.  Sir Wilfull is set in to drinking, madam, in the parlour.\n\nLADY.  Ods my life, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send him to her.  Call her down, Foible; bring\nher hither.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send him as I go.  When they are together, then come to\nme, Foible, that I may not be too long alone with Sir Rowland.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                  MRS. MILLAMANT, MRS. FAINALL, FOIBLE.\n\nFOIB.  Madam, I stayed here to tell your ladyship that Mr. Mirabell has\nwaited this half hour for an opportunity to talk with you; though my\nlady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders were to leave you and Sir Wilfull together.  Shall I tell\nMr. Mirabell that you are at leisure?\n\nMILLA.  No.  What would the dear man have?  I am thoughtful and would\namuse myself; bid him come another time.\n\n   There never yet was woman made,\n   Nor shall, but to be cursed.\n\n                                          [_Repeating and walking about_.]\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard!\n\nMRS. FAIN.  You are very fond of Sir John Suckling to-day, Millamant, and\nthe poets.\n\nMILLA.  He?  Ay, and filthy verses.  So I am.\n\nFOIB.  Sir Wilfull is coming, madam.  Shall I send Mr. Mirabell away?\n\nMILLA.  Ay, if you please, Foible, send him away, or send him hither,\njust as you will, dear Foible.  I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see him.  Shall I?  Ay, let\nthe wretch come.\n\n   Thyrsis, a youth of the inspired train.\n\n                                                             [_Repeating_]\n\nDear Fainall, entertain Sir Wilfull:\u00e2\u0080\u0094thou hast philosophy to undergo a\nfool; thou art married and hast patience.  I would confer with my own\nthoughts.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I am obliged to you that you would make me your proxy in this\naffair, but I have business of my own.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                         [_To them_] SIR WILFULL.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  O Sir Wilfull, you are come at the critical instant.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyour mistress up to the ears in love and contemplation; pursue your\npoint, now or never.\n\nSIR WIL.  Yes, my aunt will have it so.  I would gladly have been\nencouraged with a bottle or two, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m somewhat wary at first,\nbefore I am acquainted.  [_This while_ MILLAMANT _walks about repeating\nto herself_.]  But I hope, after a time, I shall break my mind\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is,\nupon further acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So for the present, cousin, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my\nleave.  If so be you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be so kind to make my excuse, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll return to my\ncompany\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Oh, fie, Sir Wilfull!  What, you must not be daunted.\n\nSIR WIL.  Daunted?  No, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not it; it is not so much for that\u00e2\u0080\u0094for if\nso be that I set on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  But only for the present, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\nsufficient till further acquaintance, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\u00e2\u0080\u0094your servant.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Nay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you shall never lose so favourable an\nopportunity, if I can help it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave you together and lock the\ndoor.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                         SIR WILFULL, MILLAMANT.\n\nSIR WIL.  Nay, nay, cousin.  I have forgot my gloves.  What d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye do?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, a has locked the door indeed, I think.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nay, cousin Fainall, open\nthe door.  Pshaw, what a vixen trick is this?  Nay, now a has seen me\ntoo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cousin, I made bold to pass through as it were\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think this door\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nenchanted.\n\nMILLA.  [_repeating_]:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n   I prithee spare me, gentle boy,\n   Press me no more for that slight toy.\n\nSIR WIL.  Anan?  Cousin, your servant.\n\nMILLA.  That foolish trifle of a heart\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSir Wilfull!\n\nSIR WIL.  Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094your servant.  No offence, I hope, cousin?\n\nMILLA.  [_repeating_]:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n      I swear it will not do its part,\n   Though thou dost thine, employ\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thy power and art.\n\nNatural, easy Suckling!\n\nSIR WIL.  Anan?  Suckling?  No such suckling neither, cousin, nor\nstripling: I thank heaven I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no minor.\n\nMILLA.  Ah, rustic, ruder than Gothic.\n\nSIR WIL.  Well, well, I shall understand your lingo one of these days,\ncousin; in the meanwhile I must answer in plain English.\n\nMILLA.  Have you any business with me, Sir Wilfull?\n\nSIR WIL.  Not at present, cousin.  Yes, I made bold to see, to come and\nknow if that how you were disposed to fetch a walk this evening; if so be\nthat I might not be troublesome, I would have sought a walk with you.\n\nMILLA.  A walk?  What then?\n\nSIR WIL.  Nay, nothing.  Only for the walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.\n\nMILLA.  I nauseate walking: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a country diversion; I loathe the\ncountry and everything that relates to it.\n\nSIR WIL.  Indeed!  Hah!  Look ye, look ye, you do?  Nay, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like you\nmay.  Here are choice of pastimes here in town, as plays and the like,\nthat must be confessed indeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMILLA.  Ah, _l\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00a9tourdi_!  I hate the town too.\n\nSIR WIL.  Dear heart, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much.  Hah! that you should hate \u00e2\u0080\u0099em both!\nHah! \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like you may!  There are some can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relish the town, and others\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t away with the country, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like you may be one of those, cousin.\n\nMILLA.  Ha, ha, ha!  Yes, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis like I may.  You have nothing further to\nsay to me?\n\nSIR WIL.  Not at present, cousin.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis like when I have an opportunity\nto be more private\u00e2\u0080\u0094I may break my mind in some measure\u00e2\u0080\u0094I conjecture you\npartly guess.  However, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as time shall try.  But spare to speak and\nspare to speed, as they say.\n\nMILLA.  If it is of no great importance, Sir Wilfull, you will oblige me\nto leave me: I have just now a little business.\n\nSIR WIL.  Enough, enough, cousin.  Yes, yes, all a case.  When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ndisposed, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disposed.  Now\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as well as another time; and\nanother time as well as now.  All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one for that.  Yes, yes; if your\nconcerns call you, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no haste: it will keep cold as they say.\nCousin, your servant.  I think this door\u00e2\u0080\u0099s locked.\n\nMILLA.  You may go this way, sir.\n\nSIR WIL.  Your servant; then with your leave I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll return to my company.\n\nMILLA.  Ay, ay; ha, ha, ha!\n\n                  Like Ph\u00c5\u0093bus sung the no less am\u00e2\u0080\u0099rous boy.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n                        MRS. MILLAMANT, MIRABELL.\n\nMIRA.  Like Daphne she, as lovely and as coy.\n\nDo you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious?  Or is\nthis pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end,\nand my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?\n\nMILLA.  Vanity!  No\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fly and be followed to the last moment; though I\nam upon the very verge of matrimony, I expect you should solicit me as\nmuch as if I were wavering at the grate of a monastery, with one foot\nover the threshold.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be solicited to the very last; nay, and\nafterwards.\n\nMIRA.  What, after the last?\n\nMILLA.  Oh, I should think I was poor and had nothing to bestow if I were\nreduced to an inglorious ease, and freed from the agreeable fatigues of\nsolicitation.\n\nMIRA.  But do not you know that when favours are conferred upon instant\nand tedious solicitation, that they diminish in their value, and that\nboth the giver loses the grace, and the receiver lessens his pleasure?\n\nMILLA.  It may be in things of common application, but never, sure, in\nlove.  Oh, I hate a lover that can dare to think he draws a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air\nindependent on the bounty of his mistress.  There is not so impudent a\nthing in nature as the saucy look of an assured man confident of success:\nthe pedantic arrogance of a very husband has not so pragmatical an air.\nAh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never marry, unless I am first made sure of my will and\npleasure.\n\nMIRA.  Would you have \u00e2\u0080\u0099em both before marriage?  Or will you be contented\nwith the first now, and stay for the other till after grace?\n\nMILLA.  Ah, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be impertinent.  My dear liberty, shall I leave thee?\nMy faithful solitude, my darling contemplation, must I bid you then\nadieu?  Ay-h, adieu.  My morning thoughts, agreeable wakings, indolent\nslumbers, all ye _douceurs_, ye _sommeils du matin_, adieu.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ndo\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis more than impossible\u00e2\u0080\u0094positively, Mirabell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lie a-bed in a\nmorning as long as I please.\n\nMI RA.  Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get up in a morning as early as I please.\n\nMILLA.  Ah!  Idle creature, get up when you will.  And d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe called names after I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m married; positively I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be called names.\n\nMIRA.  Names?\n\nMILLA.  Ay, as wife, spouse, my dear, joy, jewel, love, sweetheart, and\nthe rest of that nauseous cant, in which men and their wives are so\nfulsomely familiar\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall never bear that.  Good Mirabell, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let us\nbe familiar or fond, nor kiss before folks, like my Lady Fadler and Sir\nFrancis; nor go to Hyde Park together the first Sunday in a new chariot,\nto provoke eyes and whispers, and then never be seen there together\nagain, as if we were proud of one another the first week, and ashamed of\none another ever after.  Let us never visit together, nor go to a play\ntogether, but let us be very strange and well-bred.  Let us be as strange\nas if we had been married a great while, and as well-bred as if we were\nnot married at all.\n\nMIRA.  Have you any more conditions to offer?  Hitherto your demands are\npretty reasonable.\n\nMILLA.  Trifles; as liberty to pay and receive visits to and from whom I\nplease; to write and receive letters, without interrogatories or wry\nfaces on your part; to wear what I please, and choose conversation with\nregard only to my own taste; to have no obligation upon me to converse\nwith wits that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like, because they are your acquaintance, or to be\nintimate with fools, because they may be your relations.  Come to dinner\nwhen I please, dine in my dressing-room when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m out of humour, without\ngiving a reason.  To have my closet inviolate; to be sole empress of my\ntea-table, which you must never presume to approach without first asking\nleave.  And lastly, wherever I am, you shall always knock at the door\nbefore you come in.  These articles subscribed, if I continue to endure\nyou a little longer, I may by degrees dwindle into a wife.\n\nMIRA.  Your bill of fare is something advanced in this latter account.\nWell, have I liberty to offer conditions:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that when you are dwindled into\na wife, I may not be beyond measure enlarged into a husband?\n\nMILLA.  You have free leave: propose your utmost, speak and spare not.\n\nMIRA.  I thank you.  _Imprimis_, then, I covenant that your acquaintance\nbe general; that you admit no sworn confidant or intimate of your own\nsex; no she friend to screen her affairs under your countenance, and\ntempt you to make trial of a mutual secrecy.  No decoy-duck to wheedle\nyou a _fop-scrambling_ to the play in a mask, then bring you home in a\npretended fright, when you think you shall be found out, and rail at me\nfor missing the play, and disappointing the frolic which you had to pick\nme up and prove my constancy.\n\nMILLA.  Detestable _imprimis_!  I go to the play in a mask!\n\nMIRA.  _Item_, I article, that you continue to like your own face as long\nas I shall, and while it passes current with me, that you endeavour not\nto new coin it.  To which end, together with all vizards for the day, I\nprohibit all masks for the night, made of oiled skins and I know not\nwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0094hog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones, hare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gall, pig water, and the marrow of a roasted\ncat.  In short, I forbid all commerce with the gentlewomen in\nwhat-d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye-call-it court.  _Item_, I shut my doors against all bawds with\nbaskets, and pennyworths of muslin, china, fans, atlases, etc.  _Item_,\nwhen you shall be breeding\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMILLA.  Ah, name it not!\n\nMIRA.  Which may be presumed, with a blessing on our endeavours\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMILLA.  Odious endeavours!\n\nMIRA.  I denounce against all strait lacing, squeezing for a shape, till\nyou mould my boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head like a sugar-loaf, and instead of a man-child,\nmake me father to a crooked billet.  Lastly, to the dominion of the\ntea-table I submit; but with proviso, that you exceed not in your\nprovince, but restrain yourself to native and simple tea-table drinks, as\ntea, chocolate, and coffee.  As likewise to genuine and authorised\ntea-table talk, such as mending of fashions, spoiling reputations,\nrailing at absent friends, and so forth.  But that on no account you\nencroach upon the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prerogative, and presume to drink healths, or\ntoast fellows; for prevention of which, I banish all foreign forces, all\nauxiliaries to the tea-table, as orange-brandy, all aniseed, cinnamon,\ncitron, and Barbadoes waters, together with ratafia and the most noble\nspirit of clary.  But for cowslip-wine, poppy-water, and all dormitives,\nthose I allow.  These provisos admitted, in other things I may prove a\ntractable and complying husband.\n\nMILLA.  Oh, horrid provisos!  Filthy strong waters!  I toast fellows,\nodious men!  I hate your odious provisos.\n\nMIRA.  Then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re agreed.  Shall I kiss your hand upon the contract?  And\nhere comes one to be a witness to the sealing of the deed.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                        [_To them_] MRS. FAINALL.\n\nMILLA.  Fainall, what shall I do?  Shall I have him?  I think I must have\nhim.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Ay, ay, take him, take him, what should you do?\n\nMILLA.  Well then\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my death I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a horrid fright\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fainall, I\nshall never say it.  Well\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll endure you.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Fie, fie, have him, and tell him so in plain terms: for I am\nsure you have a mind to him.\n\nMILLA.  Are you?  I think I have; and the horrid man looks as if he\nthought so too.  Well, you ridiculous thing you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have you.  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe kissed, nor I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be thanked.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Here, kiss my hand though, so hold\nyour tongue now; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a word.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Mirabell, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a necessity for your obedience: you have\nneither time to talk nor stay.  My mother is coming; and in my conscience\nif she should see you, would fall into fits, and maybe not recover time\nenough to return to Sir Rowland, who, as Foible tells me, is in a fair\nway to succeed.  Therefore spare your ecstasies for another occasion, and\nslip down the back stairs, where Foible waits to consult you.\n\nMILLA.  Ay, go, go.  In the meantime I suppose you have said something to\nplease me.\n\nMIRA.  I am all obedience.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                      MRS. MILLAMANT, MRS. FAINALL.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Yonder Sir Wilfull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drunk, and so noisy that my mother has\nbeen forced to leave Sir Rowland to appease him; but he answers her only\nwith singing and drinking.  What they may have done by this time I know\nnot, but Petulant and he were upon quarrelling as I came by.\n\nMILLA.  Well, if Mirabell should not make a good husband, I am a lost\nthing: for I find I love him violently.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  So it seems; for you mind not what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said to you.  If you\ndoubt him, you had best take up with Sir Wilfull.\n\nMILLA.  How can you name that superannuated lubber? foh!\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                   [_To them_] WITWOUD _from drinking_.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  So, is the fray made up that you have left \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?\n\nWIT.  Left \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?  I could stay no longer.  I have laughed like ten\nChrist\u00e2\u0080\u0099nings.  I am tipsy with laughing\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I had stayed any longer I\nshould have burst,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I must have been let out and pieced in the sides like\nan unsized camlet.  Yes, yes, the fray is composed; my lady came in like\na _noli prosequi_, and stopt the proceedings.\n\nMILLA.  What was the dispute?\n\nWIT.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the jest: there was no dispute.  They could neither of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\nspeak for rage; and so fell a sputt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ring at one another like two roasting\napples.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                      [_To them_] PETULANT _drunk_.\n\nWIT.  Now, Petulant?  All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over, all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well?  Gad, my head begins to\nwhim it about.  Why dost thou not speak?  Thou art both as drunk and as\nmute as a fish.\n\nPET.  Look you, Mrs. Millamant, if you can love me, dear Nymph, say it,\nand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the conclusion\u00e2\u0080\u0094pass on, or pass off\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.\n\nWIT.  Thou hast uttered volumes, folios, in less than decimo sexto, my\ndear Lacedemonian.  Sirrah, Petulant, thou art an epitomiser of words.\n\nPET.  Witwoud,\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are an annihilator of sense.\n\nWIT.  Thou art a retailer of phrases, and dost deal in remnants of\nremnants, like a maker of pincushions; thou art in truth (metaphorically\nspeaking) a speaker of shorthand.\n\nPET.  Thou art (without a figure) just one half of an ass, and Baldwin\nyonder, thy half-brother, is the rest.  A Gemini of asses split would\nmake just four of you.\n\nWIT.  Thou dost bite, my dear mustard-seed; kiss me for that.\n\nPET.  Stand off\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kiss no more males\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have kissed your Twin yonder in\na humour of reconciliation till he [_hiccup_] rises upon my stomach like\na radish.\n\nMILLA.  Eh! filthy creature; what was the quarrel?\n\nPET.  There was no quarrel; there might have been a quarrel.\n\nWIT.  If there had been words enow between \u00e2\u0080\u0099em to have expressed\nprovocation, they had gone together by the ears like a pair of castanets.\n\nPET.  You were the quarrel.\n\nMILLA.  Me?\n\nPET.  If I have a humour to quarrel, I can make less matters conclude\npremises.  If you are not handsome, what then?  If I have a humour to\nprove it?  If I shall have my reward, say so; if not, fight for your face\nthe next time yourself\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go sleep.\n\nWIT.  Do, wrap thyself up like a woodlouse, and dream revenge.  And, hear\nme, if thou canst learn to write by to-morrow morning, pen me a\nchallenge.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll carry it for thee.\n\nPET.  Carry your mistress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monkey a spider; go flea dogs and read\nromances.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to bed to my maid.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horridly drunk\u00e2\u0080\u0094how came you all in this pickle?\n\nWIT.  A plot, a plot, to get rid of the knight\u00e2\u0080\u0094your husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice; but\nhe sneaked off.\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n    SIR WILFULL, _drunk_, LADY WISHFORT, WITWOUD, MRS. MILLAMANT, MRS.\n                                 FAINALL.\n\nLADY.

As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ashamed of you.  Fogh!  How you\nstink of wine!  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think my niece will ever endure such a Borachio?\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an absolute Borachio.\n\nSIR WIL.  Borachio?\n\nLADY.  At a time when you should commence an amour, and put your best\nfoot foremost\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSIR WIL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, an you grutch me your liquor, make a bill.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Give me\nmore drink, and take my purse.  [_Sings_]:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n      Prithee fill me the glass,\n      Till it laugh in my face,\n   With ale that is potent and mellow;\n      He that whines for a lass\n      Is an ignorant ass,\n   For a bumper has not its fellow.\n\nBut if you would have me marry my cousin, say the word, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nWilfull will do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the word.

My nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little overtaken, cousin, but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis drinking your\nhealth.  O\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my word, you are obliged to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSIR WIL.  _In vino veritas_, aunt.  If I drunk your health to-day,\ncousin,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am a Borachio.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But if you have a mind to be married, say the\nword and send for the piper; Wilfull will do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  If not, dust it away,\nand let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other round.  Tony\u00e2\u0080\u0094ods-heart, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tony?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an\nhonest fellow, but he spits after a bumper, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fault.\n\n   We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll drink and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 done, boys,\n   Put the glass then around with the sun, boys,\n   Let Apollo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example invite us;\n      For he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drunk every night,\n      And that makes him so bright,\n   That he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able next morning to light us.\n\nThe sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good pimple, an honest soaker, he has a cellar at your\nantipodes.  If I travel, aunt, I touch at your antipodes\u00e2\u0080\u0094your antipodes\nare a good rascally sort of topsy-turvy fellows.  If I had a bumper I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nstand upon my head and drink a health to \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  A match or no match,\ncousin with the hard name; aunt, Wilfull will do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  If she has her\nmaidenhead let her look to \u00e2\u0080\u0099t; if she has not, let her keep her own\ncounsel in the meantime, and cry out at the nine months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 end.\n\nMILLA.  Your pardon, madam, I can stay no longer.  Sir Wilfull grows very\npowerful.  Egh! how he smells!  I shall be overcome if I stay.  Come,\ncousin.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n         LADY WISHFORT, SIR WILFULL WITWOUD, MR. WITWOUD, FOIBLE.\n\nLADY.  Smells?  He would poison a tallow-chandler and his family.\nBeastly creature, I know not what to do with him.  Travel, quotha; ay,\ntravel, travel, get thee gone, get thee but far enough, to the Saracens,\nor the Tartars, or the Turks\u00e2\u0080\u0094for thou art not fit to live in a Christian\ncommonwealth, thou beastly pagan.\n\nSIR WIL.  Turks?  No; no Turks, aunt.  Your Turks are infidels, and\nbelieve not in the grape.  Your Mahometan, your Mussulman is a dry\nstinkard.  No offence, aunt.  My map says that your Turk is not so honest\na man as your Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0094I cannot find by the map that your Mufti is\northodox, whereby it is a plain case that orthodox is a hard word, aunt,\nand [_hiccup_] Greek for claret.  [_Sings_]:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n   To drink is a Christian diversion,\n   Unknown to the Turk or the Persian.\n      Let Mahometan fools\n      Live by heathenish rules,\n   And be damned over tea-cups and coffee.\n      But let British lads sing,\n      Crown a health to the King,\n   And a fig for your Sultan and Sophy.\n\nAh, Tony!  [FOIBLE _whispers_ LADY W.]\n\nLADY.  Sir Rowland impatient?  Good lack! what shall I do with this\nbeastly tumbril?  Go lie down and sleep, you sot, or as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have you bastinadoed with broomsticks.  Call up the wenches with\nbroomsticks.\n\nSIR WIL.  Ahey!  Wenches?  Where are the wenches?\n\nLADY.  Dear Cousin Witwoud, get him away, and you will bind me to you\ninviolably.  I have an affair of moment that invades me with some\nprecipitation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You will oblige me to all futurity.\n\nWIT.  Come, knight.  Pox on him, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to say to him.  Will\nyou go to a cock-match?\n\nSIR WIL.  With a wench, Tony?  Is she a shake-bag, sirrah?  Let me bite\nyour cheek for that.\n\nWIT.  Horrible!  He has a breath like a bagpipe.  Ay, ay; come, will you\nmarch, my Salopian?\n\nSIR WIL.  Lead on, little Tony.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll follow thee, my Anthony, my\nTantony.  Sirrah, thou shalt be my Tantony, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be thy pig.\n\n                    And a fig for your Sultan and Sophy.\n\nLADY.  This will never do.  It will never make a match,\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least before\nhe has been abroad.\n\n\n\nSCENE XII.\n\n\n         LADY WISHFORT, WAITWELL _disguised as for_ SIR ROWLAND.\n\nLADY.  Dear Sir Rowland, I am confounded with confusion at the\nretrospection of my own rudeness,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have more pardons to ask than the\npope distributes in the year of jubilee.  But I hope where there is\nlikely to be so near an alliance, we may unbend the severity of decorum,\nand dispense with a little ceremony.\n\nWAIT.  My impatience, madam, is the effect of my transport; and till I\nhave the possession of your adorable person, I am tantalised on the rack,\nand do but hang, madam, on the tenter of expectation.\n\nLADY.  You have excess of gallantry, Sir Rowland, and press things to a\nconclusion with a most prevailing vehemence.  But a day or two for\ndecency of marriage\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWAIT.  For decency of funeral, madam!  The delay will break my heart\u00e2\u0080\u0094or\nif that should fail, I shall be poisoned.  My nephew will get an inkling\nof my designs and poison me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I would willingly starve him before I\ndie\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would gladly go out of the world with that satisfaction.  That\nwould be some comfort to me, if I could but live so long as to be\nrevenged on that unnatural viper.\n\nLADY.  Is he so unnatural, say you?  Truly I would contribute much both\nto the saving of your life and the accomplishment of your revenge.  Not\nthat I respect myself; though he has been a perfidious wretch to me.\n\nWAIT.  Perfidious to you?\n\nLADY.  O Sir Rowland, the hours that he has died away at my feet, the\ntears that he has shed, the oaths that he has sworn, the palpitations\nthat he has felt, the trances and the tremblings, the ardours and the\necstasies, the kneelings and the risings, the heart-heavings and the\nhand-gripings, the pangs and the pathetic regards of his protesting\neyes!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, no memory can register.\n\nWAIT.  What, my rival?  Is the rebel my rival?  A dies.\n\nLADY.  No, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill him at once, Sir Rowland: starve him gradually,\ninch by inch.\n\nWAIT.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  In three weeks he shall be barefoot; in a month out at\nknees with begging an alms; he shall starve upward and upward, \u00e2\u0080\u0099till he\nhas nothing living but his head, and then go out in a stink like a\ncandle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end upon a save-all.\n\nLADY.  Well, Sir Rowland, you have the way,\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are no novice in the\nlabyrinth of love,\u00e2\u0080\u0094you have the clue.  But as I am a person, Sir Rowland,\nyou must not attribute my yielding to any sinister appetite or\nindigestion of widowhood; nor impute my complacency to any lethargy of\ncontinence.  I hope you do not think me prone to any iteration of\nnuptials?\n\nWAIT.  Far be it from me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  If you do, I protest I must recede, or think that I have made a\nprostitution of decorums, but in the vehemence of compassion, and to save\nthe life of a person of so much importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWAIT.  I esteem it so\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  Or else you wrong my condescension\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWAIT.  I do not, I do not\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  Indeed you do.\n\nWAIT.  I do not, fair shrine of virtue.\n\nLADY.  If you think the least scruple of causality was an ingredient\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nWAIT.  Dear madam, no.  You are all camphire and frankincense, all\nchastity and odour.\n\nLADY.  Or that\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] FOIBLE.\n\nFOIB.  Madam, the dancers are ready, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one with a letter, who\nmust deliver it into your own hands.\n\nLADY.  Sir Rowland, will you give me leave?  Think favourably, judge\ncandidly, and conclude you have found a person who would suffer racks in\nhonour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause, dear Sir Rowland, and will wait on you incessantly.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV.\n\n\n                            WAITWELL, FOIBLE.\n\nWAIT.  Fie, fie!  What a slavery have I undergone; spouse, hast thou any\ncordial?  I want spirits.\n\nFOIB.  What a washy rogue art thou, to pant thus for a quarter of an\nhour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lying and swearing to a fine lady?\n\nWAIT.  Oh, she is the antidote to desire.  Spouse, thou wilt fare the\nworse for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  I shall have no appetite to iteration of nuptials\u00e2\u0080\u0094this\neight-and-forty hours.  By this hand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be a chairman in the\ndog-days than act Sir Rowland till this time to-morrow.\n\n\n\nSCENE XV.\n\n\n                    [_To them_] LADY _with a letter_.\n\nLADY.  Call in the dancers; Sir Rowland, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sit, if you please, and\nsee the entertainment.  [_Dance_.]  Now, with your permission, Sir\nRowland, I will peruse my letter.  I would open it in your presence,\nbecause I would not make you uneasy.  If it should make you uneasy, I\nwould burn it\u00e2\u0080\u0094speak if it does\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you may see, the superscription is\nlike a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.\n\nFOIB.  By heaven!  Mrs. Marwood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, I know it,\u00e2\u0080\u0094my heart aches\u00e2\u0080\u0094get it from\nher!  [_To him_.]\n\nWAIT.  A woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand?  No madam, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand: I see that\nalready.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somebody whose throat must be cut.\n\nLADY.  Nay, Sir Rowland, since you give me a proof of your passion by\nyour jealousy, I promise you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make a return by a frank communication.\nYou shall see it\u00e2\u0080\u0094we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open it together.  Look you here.  [_Reads_.]\n_Madam_, _though unknown to you_ (look you there, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis from nobody that I\nknow.)  _I have that honour for your character_, _that I think myself\nobliged to let you know you are abused_.  _He who pretends to be Sir\nRowland is a cheat and a rascal_.  O heavens! what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this?\n\nFOIB.  Unfortunate; all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruined.\n\nWAIT.  How, how, let me see, let me see.  [_Reading_.]  _A rascal_, _and\ndisguised and suborned for that imposture_\u00e2\u0080\u0094O villainy! O villainy!\u00e2\u0080\u0094_by\nthe contrivance of_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  I shall faint, I shall die.  Oh!\n\nFOIB.  Say \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis your nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.  Quickly, his plot, swear, swear it!\n[_To him_.]\n\nWAIT.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a villain!  Madam, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you perceive it?  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see\nit?\n\nLADY.  Too well, too well.  I have seen too much.\n\nWAIT.  I told you at first I knew the hand.  A woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand?  The rascal\nwrites a sort of a large hand: your Roman hand.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I saw there was a throat\nto be cut presently.  If he were my son, as he is my nephew, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pistol\nhim.\n\nFOIB.  O treachery!  But are you sure, Sir Rowland, it is his writing?\n\nWAIT.  Sure?  Am I here?  Do I live?  Do I love this pearl of India?  I\nhave twenty letters in my pocket from him in the same character.\n\nLADY.  How?\n\nFOIB.  Oh, what luck it is, Sir Rowland, that you were present at this\njuncture!  This was the business that brought Mr. Mirabell disguised to\nMadam Millamant this afternoon.  I thought something was contriving, when\nhe stole by me and would have hid his face.\n\nLADY.  How, how?  I heard the villain was in the house indeed; and now I\nremember, my niece went away abruptly when Sir Wilfull was to have made\nhis addresses.\n\nFOIB.  Then, then, madam, Mr. Mirabell waited for her in her chamber; but\nI would not tell your ladyship to discompose you when you were to receive\nSir Rowland.\n\nWAIT.  Enough, his date is short.\n\nFOIB.  No, good Sir Rowland, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t incur the law.\n\nWAIT.  Law?  I care not for law.  I can but die, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis in a good\ncause.  My lady shall be satisfied of my truth and innocence, though it\ncost me my life.\n\nLADY.  No, dear Sir Rowland, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight: if you should be killed I must\nnever show my face; or hanged,\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, consider my reputation, Sir Rowland.\nNo, you shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go in and examine my niece; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make her\nconfess.  I conjure you, Sir Rowland, by all your love not to fight.\n\nWAIT.  I am charmed, madam; I obey.  But some proof you must let me give\nyou: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go for a black box, which contains the writings of my whole\nestate, and deliver that into your hands.\n\nLADY.  Ay, dear Sir Rowland, that will be some comfort; bring the black\nbox.\n\nWAIT.  And may I presume to bring a contract to be signed this night?\nMay I hope so far?\n\nLADY.  Bring what you will; but come alive, pray come alive.  Oh, this is\na happy discovery.\n\nWAIT.  Dead or alive I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come\u00e2\u0080\u0094and married we will be in spite of\ntreachery; ay, and get an heir that shall defeat the last remaining\nglimpse of hope in my abandoned nephew.  Come, my buxom widow:\n\n   E\u00e2\u0080\u0099er long you shall substantial proof receive\n   That I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an arrant knight\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFOIB.  Or arrant knave.\n\n\n\n\nACT V.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                            _Scene continues_.\n\n                       LADY WISHFORT _and_ FOIBLE.\n\nLADY.  Out of my house, out of my house, thou viper, thou serpent that I\nhave fostered, thou bosom traitress that I raised from nothing!  Begone,\nbegone, begone, go, go; that I took from washing of old gauze and weaving\nof dead hair, with a bleak blue nose, over a chafing-dish of starved\nembers, and dining behind a traver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rag, in a shop no bigger than a\nbird-cage.  Go, go, starve again, do, do!\n\nFOIB.  Dear madam, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beg pardon on my knees.\n\nLADY.  Away, out, out, go set up for yourself again, do; drive a trade,\ndo, with your threepennyworth of small ware, flaunting upon a packthread,\nunder a brandy-seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bulk, or against a dead wall by a balladmonger.\nGo, hang out an old frisoneer-gorget, with a yard of yellow colberteen\nagain, do; an old gnawed mask, two rows of pins, and a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fiddle; a\nglass necklace with the beads broken, and a quilted night-cap with one\near.  Go, go, drive a trade.  These were your commodities, you\ntreacherous trull; this was the merchandise you dealt in, when I took you\ninto my house, placed you next myself, and made you governant of my whole\nfamily.  You have forgot this, have you, now you have feathered your\nnest?\n\nFOIB.  No, no, dear madam.  Do but hear me, have but a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npatience\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll confess all.  Mr. Mirabell seduced me; I am not the first\nthat he has wheedled with his dissembling tongue.  Your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own\nwisdom has been deluded by him; then how should I, a poor ignorant,\ndefend myself?  O madam, if you knew but what he promised me, and how he\nassured me your ladyship should come to no damage, or else the wealth of\nthe Indies should not have bribed me to conspire against so good, so\nsweet, so kind a lady as you have been to me.\n\nLADY.  No damage?  What, to betray me, to marry me to a cast serving-man;\nto make me a receptacle, an hospital for a decayed pimp?  No damage?  O\nthou frontless impudence, more than a big-bellied actress!\n\nFOIB.  Pray do but hear me, madam; he could not marry your ladyship,\nmadam.  No indeed, his marriage was to have been void in law; for he was\nmarried to me first, to secure your ladyship.  He could not have bedded\nyour ladyship, for if he had consummated with your ladyship, he must have\nrun the risk of the law, and been put upon his clergy.  Yes indeed, I\nenquired of the law in that case before I would meddle or make.\n\nLADY.  What?  Then I have been your property, have I?  I have been\nconvenient to you, it seems, while you were catering for Mirabell; I have\nbeen broker for you?  What, have you made a passive bawd of me?  This\nexceeds all precedent.  I am brought to fine uses, to become a botcher of\nsecond-hand marriages between Abigails and Andrews!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll couple you.\nYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll baste you together, you and your Philander.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Place\nyou, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person.  Your turtle is in custody already.  You shall coo\nin the same cage, if there be constable or warrant in the parish.\n\nFOIB.  Oh, that ever I was born!  Oh, that I was ever married!  A bride?\nAy, I shall be a Bridewell bride.  Oh!\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                          MRS. FAINALL, FOIBLE.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Poor Foible, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nFOIB.  O madam, my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone for a constable; I shall be had to a\njustice, and put to Bridewell to beat hemp.  Poor Waitwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone to\nprison already.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Have a good heart, Foible: Mirabell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone to give security\nfor him.  This is all Marwood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and my husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing.\n\nFOIB.  Yes, yes; I know it, madam: she was in my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closet, and\noverheard all that you said to me before dinner.  She sent the letter to\nmy lady, and that missing effect, Mr. Fainall laid this plot to arrest\nWaitwell, when he pretended to go for the papers; and in the meantime\nMrs. Marwood declared all to my lady.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Was there no mention made of me in the letter?  My mother\ndoes not suspect my being in the confederacy?  I fancy Marwood has not\ntold her, though she has told my husband.\n\nFOIB.  Yes, madam; but my lady did not see that part.  We stifled the\nletter before she read so far.  Has that mischievous devil told Mr.\nFainall of your ladyship then?\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Ay, all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out: my affair with Mirabell, everything\ndiscovered.  This is the last day of our living together; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my\ncomfort.\n\nFOIB.  Indeed, madam, and so \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a comfort, if you knew all.  He has\nbeen even with your ladyship; which I could have told you long enough\nsince, but I love to keep peace and quietness by my good will.  I had\nrather bring friends together than set \u00e2\u0080\u0099em at distance.  But Mrs. Marwood\nand he are nearer related than ever their parents thought for.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Say\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou so, Foible?  Canst thou prove this?\n\nFOIB.  I can take my oath of it, madam; so can Mrs. Mincing.  We have had\nmany a fair word from Madam Marwood to conceal something that passed in\nour chamber one evening when you were at Hyde Park, and we were thought\nto have gone a-walking.  But we went up unawares\u00e2\u0080\u0094though we were sworn to\nsecrecy too: Madam Marwood took a book and swore us upon it: but it was\nbut a book of poems.  So long as it was not a bible oath, we may break it\nwith a safe conscience.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  This discovery is the most opportune thing I could wish.\nNow, Mincing?\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] MINCING.\n\nMINC.  My lady would speak with Mrs. Foible, mem.  Mr. Mirabell is with\nher; he has set your spouse at liberty, Mrs. Foible, and would have you\nhide yourself in my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closet till my old lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger is abated.\nOh, my old lady is in a perilous passion at something Mr. Fainall has\nsaid; he swears, and my old lady cries.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fearful hurricane, I\nvow.  He says, mem, how that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune made over to\nhim, or he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be divorced.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Does your lady or Mirabell know that?\n\nMINC.  Yes mem; they have sent me to see if Sir Wilfull be sober, and to\nbring him to them.  My lady is resolved to have him, I think, rather than\nlose such a vast sum as six thousand pound.  Oh, come, Mrs. Foible, I\nhear my old lady.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Foible, you must tell Mincing that she must prepare to vouch\nwhen I call her.\n\nFOIB.  Yes, yes, madam.\n\nMINC.  Oh, yes mem, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll vouch anything for your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service, be\nwhat it will.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                MRS. FAINALL, LADY WISHFORT, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nLADY.  O my dear friend, how can I enumerate the benefits that I have\nreceived from your goodness?  To you I owe the timely discovery of the\nfalse vows of Mirabell; to you I owe the detection of the impostor Sir\nRowland.  And now you are become an intercessor with my son-in-law, to\nsave the honour of my house and compound for the frailties of my\ndaughter.  Well, friend, you are enough to reconcile me to the bad world,\nor else I would retire to deserts and solitudes, and feed harmless sheep\nby groves and purling streams.  Dear Marwood, let us leave the world, and\nretire by ourselves and be shepherdesses.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Let us first dispatch the affair in hand, madam.  We shall\nhave leisure to think of retirement afterwards.  Here is one who is\nconcerned in the treaty.\n\nLADY.  O daughter, daughter, is it possible thou shouldst be my child,\nbone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh, and as I may say, another me, and\nyet transgress the most minute particle of severe virtue?  Is it possible\nyou should lean aside to iniquity, who have been cast in the direct mould\nof virtue?  I have not only been a mould but a pattern for you, and a\nmodel for you, after you were brought into the world.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand your ladyship.\n\nLADY.  Not understand?  Why, have you not been naught?  Have you not been\nsophisticated?  Not understand?  Here I am ruined to compound for your\ncaprices and your cuckoldoms.  I must pawn my plate and my jewels, and\nruin my niece, and all little enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I am wronged and abused, and so are you.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a false\naccusation, as false as hell, as false as your friend there; ay, or your\nfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend, my false husband.\n\nMRS. MAR.  My friend, Mrs. Fainall?  Your husband my friend, what do you\nmean?\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I know what I mean, madam, and so do you; and so shall the\nworld at a time convenient.\n\nMRS. MAR.  I am sorry to see you so passionate, madam.  More temper would\nlook more like innocence.  But I have done.  I am sorry my zeal to serve\nyour ladyship and family should admit of misconstruction, or make me\nliable to affronts.  You will pardon me, madam, if I meddle no more with\nan affair in which I am not personally concerned.\n\nLADY.  O dear friend, I am so ashamed that you should meet with such\nreturns.  You ought to ask pardon on your knees, ungrateful creature; she\ndeserves more from you than all your life can accomplish.  Oh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nleave me destitute in this perplexity!  No, stick to me, my good genius.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I tell you, madam, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re abused.  Stick to you?  Ay, like a\nleech, to suck your best blood; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll drop off when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full.  Madam,\nyou shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pawn a bodkin, nor part with a brass counter, in composition\nfor me.  I defy \u00e2\u0080\u0099em all.  Let \u00e2\u0080\u0099em prove their aspersions: I know my own\ninnocence, and dare stand a trial.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n                       LADY WISHFORT, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nLADY.  Why, if she should be innocent, if she should be wronged after\nall, ha?  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to think, and I promise you, her education\nhas been unexceptionable.  I may say it, for I chiefly made it my own\ncare to initiate her very infancy in the rudiments of virtue, and to\nimpress upon her tender years a young odium and aversion to the very\nsight of men; ay, friend, she would ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shrieked if she had but seen a\nman till she was in her teens.  As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a person, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis true.  She was\nnever suffered to play with a male child, though but in coats.  Nay, her\nvery babies were of the feminine gender.  Oh, she never looked a man in\nthe face but her own father or the chaplain, and him we made a shift to\nput upon her for a woman, by the help of his long garments, and his sleek\nface, till she was going in her fifteen.\n\nMRS. MAR.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas much she should be deceived so long.\n\nLADY.  I warrant you, or she would never have borne to have been\ncatechised by him, and have heard his long lectures against singing and\ndancing and such debaucheries, and going to filthy plays, and profane\nmusic meetings, where the lewd trebles squeak nothing but bawdy, and the\nbasses roar blasphemy.  Oh, she would have swooned at the sight or name\nof an obscene play-book\u00e2\u0080\u0094and can I think after all this that my daughter\ncan be naught?  What, a whore?  And thought it excommunication to set her\nfoot within the door of a playhouse.  O dear friend, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it.\nNo, no; as she says, let him prove it, let him prove it.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Prove it, madam?  What, and have your name prostituted in a\npublic court; yours and your daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation worried at the bar by\na pack of bawling lawyers?  To be ushered in with an _Oh yes_ of scandal,\nand have your case opened by an old fumbling leacher in a quoif like a\nman midwife; to bring your daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infamy to light; to be a theme for\nlegal punsters and quibblers by the statute; and become a jest, against a\nrule of court, where there is no precedent for a jest in any record, not\neven in Doomsday Book.  To discompose the gravity of the bench, and\nprovoke naughty interrogatories in more naughty law Latin; while the good\njudge, tickled with the proceeding, simpers under a grey beard, and\nfidges off and on his cushion as if he had swallowed cantharides, or sate\nupon cow-itch.\n\nLADY.  Oh, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis very hard!\n\nMRS. MAR.  And then to have my young revellers of the Temple take notes,\nlike prentices at a conventicle; and after talk it over again in Commons,\nor before drawers in an eating-house.\n\nLADY.  Worse and worse.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Nay, this is nothing; if it would end here \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere well.  But\nit must after this be consigned by the shorthand writers to the public\npress; and from thence be transferred to the hands, nay, into the throats\nand lungs, of hawkers, with voices more licentious than the loud\nflounder-man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  And this you must hear till you are stunned; nay, you\nmust hear nothing else for some days.\n\nLADY.  Oh \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis insupportable.  No, no, dear friend, make it up, make it\nup; ay, ay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll compound.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give up all, myself and my all, my niece\nand her all, anything, everything, for composition.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Nay, madam, I advise nothing, I only lay before you, as a\nfriend, the inconveniences which perhaps you have overseen.  Here comes\nMr. Fainall; if he will be satisfied to huddle up all in silence, I shall\nbe glad.  You must think I would rather congratulate than condole with\nyou.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                  FAINALL, LADY WISHFORT, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nLADY.  Ay, ay, I do not doubt it, dear Marwood.  No, no, I do not doubt\nit.\n\nFAIN.  Well, madam, I have suffered myself to be overcome by the\nimportunity of this lady, your friend, and am content you shall enjoy\nyour own proper estate during life, on condition you oblige yourself\nnever to marry, under such penalty as I think convenient.\n\nLADY.  Never to marry?\n\nFAIN.  No more Sir Rowlands,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the next imposture may not be so timely\ndetected.\n\nMRS. MAR.  That condition, I dare answer, my lady will consent to,\nwithout difficulty; she has already but too much experienced the\nperfidiousness of men.  Besides, madam, when we retire to our pastoral\nsolitude, we shall bid adieu to all other thoughts.\n\nLADY.  Ay, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true; but in case of necessity, as of health, or some\nsuch emergency\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFAIN.  Oh, if you are prescribed marriage, you shall be considered; I\nwill only reserve to myself the power to choose for you.  If your physic\nbe wholesome, it matters not who is your apothecary.  Next, my wife shall\nsettle on me the remainder of her fortune, not made over already; and for\nher maintenance depend entirely on my discretion.\n\nLADY.  This is most inhumanly savage: exceeding the barbarity of a\nMuscovite husband.\n\nFAIN.  I learned it from his Czarish Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retinue, in a winter\nevening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference over brandy and pepper, amongst other secrets of\nmatrimony and policy, as they are at present practised in the northern\nhemisphere.  But this must be agreed unto, and that positively.  Lastly,\nI will be endowed, in right of my wife, with that six thousand pound,\nwhich is the moiety of Mrs. Millamant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune in your possession, and\nwhich she has forfeited (as will appear by the last will and testament of\nyour deceased husband, Sir Jonathan Wishfort) by her disobedience in\ncontracting herself against your consent or knowledge, and by refusing\nthe offered match with Sir Wilfull Witwoud, which you, like a careful\naunt, had provided for her.\n\nLADY.  My nephew was _non compos_, and could not make his addresses.\n\nFAIN.  I come to make demands\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear no objections.\n\nLADY.  You will grant me time to consider?\n\nFAIN.  Yes, while the instrument is drawing, to which you must set your\nhand till more sufficient deeds can be perfected: which I will take care\nshall be done with all possible speed.  In the meanwhile I will go for\nthe said instrument, and till my return you may balance this matter in\nyour own discretion.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                       LADY WISHFORT, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nLADY.  This insolence is beyond all precedent, all parallel.  Must I be\nsubject to this merciless villain?\n\nMRS. MAR.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis severe indeed, madam, that you should smart for your\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wantonness.\n\nLADY.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas against my consent that she married this barbarian, but she\nwould have him, though her year was not out.  Ah! her first husband, my\nson Languish, would not have carried it thus.  Well, that was my choice,\nthis is hers; she is matched now with a witness\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall be mad, dear\nfriend; is there no comfort for me?  Must I live to be confiscated at\nthis rebel-rate?  Here come two more of my Egyptian plagues too.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                 [_To them_] MRS. MILLAMANT, SIR WILFULL.\n\nSIR WIL.  Aunt, your servant.\n\nLADY.  Out, caterpillar, call not me aunt; I know thee not.\n\nSIR WIL.  I confess I have been a little in disguise, as they say.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart! and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  What would you have?  I hope I committed\nno offence, aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if I did I am willing to make satisfaction; and what\ncan a man say fairer?  If I have broke anything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pay for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, an it\ncost a pound.  And so let that content for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past, and make no more\nwords.  For what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come, to pleasure you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m willing to marry my\ncousin.  So, pray, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all be friends, she and I are agreed upon the\nmatter before a witness.\n\nLADY.  How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this, dear niece?  Have I any comfort?  Can this be true?\n\nMILLA.  I am content to be a sacrifice to your repose, madam, and to\nconvince you that I had no hand in the plot, as you were misinformed.  I\nhave laid my commands on Mirabell to come in person, and be a witness\nthat I give my hand to this flower of knighthood; and for the contract\nthat passed between Mirabell and me, I have obliged him to make a\nresignation of it in your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence.  He is without and waits\nyour leave for admittance.\n\nLADY.  Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear I am something revived at this testimony of your\nobedience; but I cannot admit that traitor,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I fear I cannot fortify\nmyself to support his appearance.  He is as terrible to me as a Gorgon:\nif I see him I swear I shall turn to stone, petrify incessantly.\n\nMILLA.  If you disoblige him he may resent your refusal, and insist upon\nthe contract still.  Then \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the last time he will be offensive to you.\n\nLADY.  Are you sure it will be the last time?  If I were sure of\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0094shall I never see him again?\n\nMILLA.  Sir Wilfull, you and he are to travel together, are you not?\n\nSIR WIL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, the gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a civil gentleman, aunt, let him come\nin; why, we are sworn brothers and fellow-travellers.  We are to be\nPylades and Orestes, he and I.  He is to be my interpreter in foreign\nparts.  He has been overseas once already; and with proviso that I marry\nmy cousin, will cross \u00e2\u0080\u0099em once again, only to bear me company.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call him in,\u00e2\u0080\u0094an I set on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t once, he shall come in; and see who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhinder him.  [_Goes to the door and hems_.]\n\nMRS. MAR.  This is precious fooling, if it would pass; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know the\nbottom of it.\n\nLADY.  O dear Marwood, you are not going?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Not far, madam; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll return immediately.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n          LADY WISHFORT, MRS. MILLAMANT, SIR WILFULL, MIRABELL.\n\nSIR WIL.  Look up, man, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stand by you; \u00e2\u0080\u0099sbud, an she do frown, she\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill you.  Besides\u00e2\u0080\u0094harkee, she dare not frown desperately, because\nher face is none of her own.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, an she should, her forehead would\nwrinkle like the coat of a cream cheese; but mum for that,\nfellow-traveller.\n\nMIRA.  If a deep sense of the many injuries I have offered to so good a\nlady, with a sincere remorse and a hearty contrition, can but obtain the\nleast glance of compassion.  I am too happy.  Ah, madam, there was a\ntime\u00e2\u0080\u0094but let it be forgotten.  I confess I have deservedly forfeited the\nhigh place I once held, of sighing at your feet; nay, kill me not by\nturning from me in disdain, I come not to plead for favour.  Nay, not for\npardon: I am a suppliant only for pity:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am going where I never shall\nbehold you more.\n\nSIR WIL.  How, fellow-traveller?  You shall go by yourself then.\n\nMIRA.  Let me be pitied first, and afterwards forgotten.  I ask no more.\n\nSIR WIL.  By\u00e2\u0080\u0099r lady, a very reasonable request, and will cost you\nnothing, aunt.  Come, come, forgive and forget, aunt.  Why you must an\nyou are a Christian.\n\nMIRA.  Consider, madam; in reality you could not receive much prejudice:\nit was an innocent device, though I confess it had a face of\nguiltiness\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was at most an artifice which love contrived\u00e2\u0080\u0094and errors\nwhich love produces have ever been accounted venial.  At least think it\nis punishment enough that I have lost what in my heart I hold most dear,\nthat to your cruel indignation I have offered up this beauty, and with\nher my peace and quiet; nay, all my hopes of future comfort.\n\nSIR WIL.  An he does not move me, would I may never be o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the quorum.  An\nit were not as good a deed as to drink, to give her to him again, I would\nI might never take shipping.  Aunt, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive quickly, I shall\nmelt, I can tell you that.  My contract went no farther than a little\nmouth-glue, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly dry; one doleful sigh more from my\nfellow-traveller and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis dissolved.\n\nLADY.  Well, nephew, upon your account.  Ah, he has a false insinuating\ntongue.  Well, sir, I will stifle my just resentment at my nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrequest.  I will endeavour what I can to forget, but on proviso that you\nresign the contract with my niece immediately.\n\nMIRA.  It is in writing and with papers of concern; but I have sent my\nservant for it, and will deliver it to you, with all acknowledgments for\nyour transcendent goodness.\n\nLADY.  Oh, he has witchcraft in his eyes and tongue; when I did not see\nhim I could have bribed a villain to his assassination; but his\nappearance rakes the embers which have so long lain smothered in my\nbreast.  [_Aside_.]\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n                    [_To them_] FAINALL, MRS. MARWOOD.\n\nFAIN.  Your date of deliberation, madam, is expired.  Here is the\ninstrument; are you prepared to sign?\n\nLADY.  If I were prepared, I am not impowered.  My niece exerts a lawful\nclaim, having matched herself by my direction to Sir Wilfull.\n\nFAIN.  That sham is too gross to pass on me, though \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis imposed on you,\nmadam.\n\nMILLA.  Sir, I have given my consent.\n\nMIRA.  And, sir, I have resigned my pretensions.\n\nSIR WIL.  And, sir, I assert my right; and will maintain it in defiance\nof you, sir, and of your instrument.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, an you talk of an\ninstrument sir, I have an old fox by my thigh shall hack your instrument\nof ram vellum to shreds, sir.  It shall not be sufficient for a Mittimus\nor a tailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s measure; therefore withdraw your instrument, sir, or, by\u00e2\u0080\u0099r\nlady, I shall draw mine.\n\nLADY.  Hold, nephew, hold.\n\nMILLA.  Good Sir Wilfull, respite your valour.\n\nFAIN.  Indeed?  Are you provided of your guard, with your single\nbeef-eater there?  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m prepared for you, and insist upon my first\nproposal.  You shall submit your own estate to my management, and\nabsolutely make over my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to my sole use, as pursuant to the purport\nand tenor of this other covenant.  I suppose, madam, your consent is not\nrequisite in this case; nor, Mr. Mirabell, your resignation; nor, Sir\nWilfull, your right.  You may draw your fox if you please, sir, and make\na bear-garden flourish somewhere else; for here it will not avail.  This,\nmy Lady Wishfort, must be subscribed, or your darling daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turned\nadrift, like a leaky hulk to sink or swim, as she and the current of this\nlewd town can agree.\n\nLADY.  Is there no means, no remedy, to stop my ruin?  Ungrateful wretch!\nDost thou not owe thy being, thy subsistance, to my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune?\n\nFAIN.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll answer you when I have the rest of it in my possession.\n\nMIRA.  But that you would not accept of a remedy from my hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094I own I\nhave not deserved you should owe any obligation to me; or else, perhaps,\nI could devise\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nLADY.  Oh, what? what?  To save me and my child from ruin, from want,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forgive all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past; nay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll consent to anything to come, to\nbe delivered from this tyranny.\n\nMIRA.  Ay, madam; but that is too late, my reward is intercepted.  You\nhave disposed of her who only could have made me a compensation for all\nmy services.  But be it as it may, I am resolved I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll serve you; you\nshall not be wronged in this savage manner.\n\nLADY.  How?  Dear Mr. Mirabell, can you be so generous at last?  But it\nis not possible.  Harkee, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break my nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s match; you shall have my\nniece yet, and all her fortune, if you can but save me from this imminent\ndanger.\n\nMIRA.  Will you?  I take you at your word.  I ask no more.  I must have\nleave for two criminals to appear.\n\nLADY.  Ay, ay, anybody, anybody.\n\nMIRA.  Foible is one, and a penitent.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n                [_To them_] MRS. FAINALL, FOIBLE, MINCING.\n\nMRS. MAR.  O my shame!  [MIRABELL _and_ LADY _go to_ MRS. FAINALL _and_\nFOIBLE.]  These currupt things are brought hither to expose me.  [_To_\nFAINALL.]\n\nFAIN.  If it must all come out, why let \u00e2\u0080\u0099em know it, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis but the way of\nthe world.  That shall not urge me to relinquish or abate one tittle of\nmy terms; no, I will insist the more.\n\nFOIB.  Yes, indeed, madam; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my bible-oath of it.\n\nMINC.  And so will I, mem.\n\nLADY.  O Marwood, Marwood, art thou false?  My friend deceive me?  Hast\nthou been a wicked accomplice with that profligate man?\n\nMRS. MAR.  Have you so much ingratitude and injustice to give credit,\nagainst your friend, to the aspersions of two such mercenary trulls?\n\nMINC.  Mercenary, mem?  I scorn your words.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis true we found you and\nMr. Fainall in the blue garret; by the same token, you swore us to\nsecrecy upon Messalinas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poems.  Mercenary?  No, if we would have been\nmercenary, we should have held our tongues; you would have bribed us\nsufficiently.\n\nFAIN.  Go, you are an insignificant thing.  Well, what are you the better\nfor this?  Is this Mr. Mirabell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expedient?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be put off no longer.\nYou, thing, that was a wife, shall smart for this.  I will not leave thee\nwherewithal to hide thy shame: your body shall be naked as your\nreputation.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  I despise you and defy your malice.  You have aspersed me\nwrongfully\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have proved your falsehood.  Go, you and your treacherous\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwill not name it, but starve together.  Perish.\n\nFAIN.  Not while you are worth a groat, indeed, my dear.  Madam, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nfooled no longer.\n\nLADY.  Ah, Mr. Mirabell, this is small comfort, the detection of this\naffair.\n\nMIRA.  Oh, in good time.  Your leave for the other offender and penitent\nto appear, madam.\n\n\n\nSCENE XII.\n\n\n              [_To them_] WAITWELL _with a box of writings_.\n\nLADY.  O Sir Rowland!  Well, rascal?\n\nWAIT.  What your ladyship pleases.  I have brought the black box at last,\nmadam.\n\nMIRA.  Give it me.  Madam, you remember your promise.\n\nLADY.  Ay, dear sir.\n\nMIRA.  Where are the gentlemen?\n\nWAIT.  At hand, sir, rubbing their eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094just risen from sleep.\n\nFAIN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this to me?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not wait your private concerns.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII.\n\n\n                      [_To them_] PETULANT, WITWOUD.\n\nPET.  How now?  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?  Whose hand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out?\n\nWIT.  Hey day!  What, are you all got together, like players at the end\nof the last act?\n\nMIRA.  You may remember, gentlemen, I once requested your hands as\nwitnesses to a certain parchment.\n\nWIT.  Ay, I do, my hand I remember\u00e2\u0080\u0094Petulant set his mark.\n\nMIRA.  You wrong him; his name is fairly written, as shall appear.  You\ndo not remember, gentlemen, anything of what that parchment contained?\n[_Undoing the box_.]\n\nWIT.  No.\n\nPET.  Not I.  I writ; I read nothing.\n\nMIRA.  Very well, now you shall know.  Madam, your promise.\n\nLADY.  Ay, ay, sir, upon my honour.\n\nMIRA.  Mr. Fainall, it is now time that you should know that your lady,\nwhile she was at her own disposal, and before you had by your\ninsinuations wheedled her out of a pretended settlement of the greatest\npart of her fortune\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFAIN.  Sir!  Pretended?\n\nMIRA.  Yes, sir.  I say that this lady, while a widow, having, it seems,\nreceived some cautions respecting your inconstancy and tyranny of temper,\nwhich from her own partial opinion and fondness of you she could never\nhave suspected\u00e2\u0080\u0094she did, I say, by the wholesome advice of friends and of\nsages learned in the laws of this land, deliver this same as her act and\ndeed to me in trust, and to the uses within mentioned.  You may read if\nyou please [_holding out the parchment_], though perhaps what is written\non the back may serve your occasions.\n\nFAIN.  Very likely, sir.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here?  Damnation!  [_Reads_] _A Deed of\nConveyance of the whole estate real of Arabella Languish_, _widow_, _in\ntrust to Edward Mirabell_.  Confusion!\n\nMIRA.  Even so, sir: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the way of the world, sir; of the widows of the\nworld.  I suppose this deed may bear an elder date than what you have\nobtained from your lady.\n\nFAIN.  Perfidious fiend!  Then thus I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be revenged.  [_Offers to run\nat_ MRS. FAINALL.]\n\nSIR WIL.  Hold, sir; now you may make your bear-garden flourish somewhere\nelse, sir.\n\nFAIN.  Mirabell, you shall hear of this, sir; be sure you shall.  Let me\npass, oaf.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Madam, you seem to stifle your resentment.  You had better\ngive it vent.\n\nMRS. MAR.  Yes, it shall have vent, and to your confusion, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll perish\nin the attempt.\n\n\n\nSCENE _the Last_.\n\n\n   LADY WISHFORT, MRS. MILLAMANT, MIRABELL, MRS. FAINALL, SIR WILFULL,\n              PETULANT, WITWOUD, FOIBLE, MINCING, WAITWELL.\n\nLADY.  O daughter, daughter, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis plain thou hast inherited thy mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nprudence.\n\nMRS. FAIN.  Thank Mr. Mirabell, a cautious friend, to whose advice all is\nowing.\n\nLADY.  Well, Mr. Mirabell, you have kept your promise, and I must perform\nmine.  First, I pardon for your sake Sir Rowland there and Foible.  The\nnext thing is to break the matter to my nephew, and how to do that\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMIRA.  For that, madam, give yourself no trouble; let me have your\nconsent.  Sir Wilfull is my friend: he has had compassion upon lovers,\nand generously engaged a volunteer in this action, for our service, and\nnow designs to prosecute his travels.\n\nSIR WIL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, aunt, I have no mind to marry.  My cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine\nlady, and the gentleman loves her and she loves him, and they deserve one\nanother; my resolution is to see foreign parts.  I have set on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and\nwhen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m set on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I must do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  And if these two gentlemen would travel\ntoo, I think they may be spared.\n\nPET.  For my part, I say little.  I think things are best off or on.\n\nWIT.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099gad, I understand nothing of the matter: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a maze yet, like\na dog in a dancing school.\n\nLADY.  Well, sir, take her, and with her all the joy I can give you.\n\nMILLA.  Why does not the man take me?  Would you have me give myself to\nyou over again?\n\nMIRA.  Ay, and over and over again.  [_Kisses her hand_.]  I would have\nyou as often as possibly I can.  Well, heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n grant I love you not too\nwell; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all my fear.\n\nSIR WIL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sheart, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have time enough to toy after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re married,\nor, if you will toy now, let us have a dance in the meantime; that we who\nare not lovers may have some other employment besides looking on.\n\nMIRA.  With all my heart, dear Sir Wilfull.  What shall we do for music?\n\nFOIB.  Oh, sir, some that were provided for Sir Rowland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entertainment\nare yet within call.  [_A dance_.]\n\nLADY.  As I am a person, I can hold out no longer: I have wasted my\nspirits so to-day already that I am ready to sink under the fatigue; and\nI cannot but have some fears upon me yet, that my son Fainall will pursue\nsome desperate course.\n\nMIRA.  Madam, disquiet not yourself on that account: to my knowledge his\ncircumstances are such he must of force comply.  For my part I will\ncontribute all that in me lies to a reunion.  In the meantime, madam\n[_to_ MRS. FAINALL], let me before these witnesses restore to you this\ndeed of trust: it may be a means, well managed, to make you live easily\ntogether.\n\n   From hence let those be warned, who mean to wed,\n   Lest mutual falsehood stain the bridal-bed:\n   For each deceiver to his cost may find\n   That marriage frauds too oft are paid in kind.\n\n                                                          [_Exeunt Omnes_.\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\n\n                       Spoken by MRS. BRACEGIRDLE.\n\n   AFTER our Epilogue this crowd dismisses,\n   I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking how this play\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be pulled to pieces.\n   But pray consider, e\u00e2\u0080\u0099er you doom its fall,\n   How hard a thing \u00e2\u0080\u0099twould be to please you all.\n   There are some critics so with spleen diseased,\n   They scarcely come inclining to be pleased:\n   And sure he must have more than mortal skill\n   Who pleases anyone against his will.\n   Then, all bad poets we are sure are foes,\n   And how their number\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swelled the town well knows\n   In shoals, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve marked \u00e2\u0080\u0099em judging in the pit;\n   Though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on no pretence for judgment fit,\n   But that they have been damned for want of wit.\n   Since when, they, by their own offences taught,\n   Set up for spies on plays, and finding fault.\n   Others there are whose malice we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prevent:\n   Such, who watch plays, with scurrilous intent\n   To mark out who by characters are meant:\n   And though no perfect likeness they can trace,\n   Yet each pretends to know the copied face.\n   These, with false glosses, feed their own ill-nature,\n   And turn to libel what was meant a satire.\n   May such malicious fops this fortune find,\n   To think themselves alone the fools designed:\n   If any are so arrogantly vain,\n   To think they singly can support a scene,\n   And furnish fool enough to entertain.\n   For well the learned and the judicious know,\n   That satire scorns to stoop so meanly low,\n   As any one abstracted fop to show.\n   For, as when painters form a matchless face,\n   They from each fair one catch some diff\u00e2\u0080\u0099rent grace,\n   And shining features in one portrait blend,\n   To which no single beauty must pretend:\n   So poets oft do in one piece expose\n   Whole _belles assembl\u00c3\u00a9es_ of coquettes and beaux.\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WAY OF THE WORLD***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 1292-0.txt or 1292-0.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/2\/9\/1292\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1166,"split":"test"}
